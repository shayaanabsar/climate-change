“you _might_ wear that.” “not world, world. cross last thing would wear trinket.” dorothea shuddered slightly. “then think wicked wear it,” said celia, uneasily. “no, dear, no,” said dorothea,

“ah, pigeon-holes do. tried pigeon-holes, everything get mixed pigeon-holes: never know whether paper z.” “i wish would let sort paper you, uncle,” said dorothea. “i would letter all, make list

young lady flighty.” dorothea felt hurt. mr. casaubon would think uncle special reason delivering opinion, whereas remark lay mind lightly broken wing insect among fragment there, chance current sent

melancholy-looking: sort house must children, many flowers, open windows, little vista bright things, make seem joyous home. latter end autumn, sparse remnant yellow leaf falling slowly athwart dark evergreen stillness without sunshine, house air autumnal decline, mr. casaubon, presented himself, bloom could thrown relief background. “oh dear!” celia said herself, “i sure freshitt hall would

oppression her, seemed cheerful cast picture grange, uncle long ago brought home travels—they probably among idea taken one time. poor dorothea severe classical nudity smirking

unfortunate marriage. never saw her.” dorothea wondered little, felt would indelicate ask information mr. casaubon proffer, turned window admire view. sun lately pierced gray, avenue lime cast

saw mr. casaubon gone away, said easy staccato, always seemed contradict suspicion malicious intent— “do know, dorothea, saw one quite young coming one walks.” “is astonishing, celia?” “there may young gardener, know—why not?” said mr. brooke. “i told casaubon gardener.” “no, gardener,” said celia; “a gentleman sketch-book. light-brown curls. saw back. quite young.” “the curate’s son, perhaps,” said mr. brooke. “ah, casaubon again, tucker him. going introduce tucker. don’t know tucker yet.” mr. tucker middle-aged curate, one “inferior clergy,” usually wanting sons. introduction, conversation lead question family, startling apparition youthfulness forgotten every one celia. inwardly declined believe light-brown curl slim figure could relationship mr. tucker, old musty-looking would expected mr. casaubon’s curate be; doubtless excellent man would go heaven (for celia wished unprincipled), corner mouth unpleasant. celia thought dismalness time spend bridesmaid lowick, curate probably pretty little child could like, irrespective principle. mr. tucker invaluable walk; perhaps mr. casaubon without foresight head, curate able answer dorothea’s question villager parishioners. everybody, assured her, well lowick: cottager double cottage low rent kept pig, strip garden back well tended. small boy wore excellent corduroy, girl went tidy servants, little straw-plaiting home: loom here, dissent; though public disposition rather towards laying money towards spirituality, much vice. speckled fowl numerous mr. brooke observed, “your farmer leave barley woman glean, see. poor folk might fowl pot, good french king used wish people. french eat good many fowls—skinny fowls, know.” “i think cheap wish his,” said dorothea, indignantly. “are king monster wish like must reckoned royal virtue?” “and wished skinny fowl,” said celia, “that would nice. perhaps wished fat fowls.” “yes, word dropped text, perhaps subauditum; is, present king’s mind, uttered,” said mr. casaubon, smiling bending head towards celia, immediately dropped backward little, could bear mr. casaubon blink her. dorothea sank silence way back house. felt disappointment, yet ashamed, nothing lowick; next minute mind glanced possibility, would preferred, finding home would parish larger share world’s misery, might active duty it. then, recurring future actually her, made picture complete devotion mr. casaubon’s aim would await new duties. many might reveal higher knowledge gained companionship. mr. tucker soon left them, clerical work would allow lunch hall; re-entering garden little gate, mr. casaubon said— “you seem little sad, dorothea. trust pleased seen.” “i feeling something perhaps foolish wrong,” answered dorothea, usual openness—“almost wishing people wanted done here. known way

lowick, leave yearning unfulfilled.” “indeed, believe that,” said dorothea, earnestly. “do suppose sad.” “that well. but, tired, take another way house came.” dorothea tired, little circuit made towards fine yew-tree, chief hereditary glory ground side house. approached it, figure, conspicuous dark background evergreens, seated bench, sketching old tree. mr. brooke, walking front celia, turned head, said— “who youngster, casaubon?” come near mr. casaubon answered— “that young relative mine, second cousin: grandson, fact,” added, looking dorothea, “of lady whose portrait noticing, aunt julia.” young man laid sketch-book risen. bushy light-brown curls, well youthfulness, identified celia’s apparition. “dorothea, let introduce cousin, mr. ladislaw. will, miss brooke.” cousin close now, that, lifted hat, dorothea could see pair gray eye rather near together, delicate irregular nose little ripple it, hair falling backward; mouth chin prominent, threatening aspect belonged

deprecation appeal her. “you know, uncle, never see beauty picture say much praised. language understand. suppose relation picture nature ignorant feel—just see greek sentence stand mean nothing me.” dorothea looked mr. casaubon, bowed head towards her, mr. brooke said, smiling nonchalantly— “bless me, now, different people are! bad style teaching, know—else thing girls—sketching, fine art on. took drawing plans; don’t understand _morbidezza_, kind thing. come house, hope, show way,” continued, turning young ladislaw, recalled preoccupation observing dorothea. ladislaw made mind must

turned, young ladislaw sat go sketching, face broke expression amusement increased went drawing, till last threw back head laughed aloud. partly reception artistic production tickled him; partly notion grave cousin lover girl; partly mr. brooke’s definition place might held impediment indolence. mr. ladislaw’s sense ludicrous lit feature agreeably: pure enjoyment comicality, mixture sneering self-exaltation. “what nephew going himself, casaubon?” said mr. brooke, went on. “my cousin, mean—not nephew.” “yes, yes, cousin. way career, know.” “the answer question painfully doubtful. leaving

“go her!” burst out, sharp edge voice. “do think would turn look me, value word ever uttered dirty feather?—explain! man explain expense woman?” “you tell please,” said rosamond tremor. “do suppose

crowd—to sure denounced solely good us. pitiable lot man could call martyr even though persuade men stoned ugly passion incarnate—who know stoned, professing right, man professed be. consciousness bulstrode withering made preparation departing middlemarch, going end stricken life sad refuge, indifference new faces. duteous merciful constancy wife delivered one dread, could hinder presence still tribunal shrank confession desired advocacy. equivocation death raffle sustained conception omniscience prayed to, yet terror upon would let expose judgment full confession wife: act washed diluted inward argument motive, seemed comparatively easy win invisible pardon—what name would call by? ever silently call act murder could bear. felt shrouded doubt: got strength face sense could yet feel warranted pronouncing worst condemnation him. time, perhaps—when dying—he would tell all: deep shadow time, held hand gathering darkness, might listen without recoiling touch. perhaps: concealment

feeling held matter course every one would avoid connection husband. silent time; tear fell one other, chin trembling wiped away. bulstrode, sitting opposite her, ached sight grief-worn face, two month bright blooming. aged keep sad company withered features. urged effort comforting her, said— “there another means, harriet, might service brother’s family, like act it. would, think, beneficial

vie, la fraîcheur de vielles amour prolongées. il existe un embaumement d’amour. c’est de daphnis chloé que sont faits philémon baucis. cette vieillesse-là, ressemblance du soir avec l’aurore.”—victor hugo: _l’homme qui rit_. mrs. garth, hearing caleb enter passage tea-time, opened parlor-door said, “there are, caleb. dinner?” (mr. garth’s meal much subordinated “business.”) “oh yes, good dinner—cold mutton don’t know what. mary?” “in garden letty, think.” “fred come yet?” “no. going without taking tea, caleb?” said mrs. garth, seeing absent-minded husband putting hat taken off. “no, no; i’m going mary minute.” mary grassy corner garden, swing loftily hung two pear-trees. pink kerchief tied head, making little poke shade eye level sunbeams, giving glorious swing letty, laughed screamed wildly. seeing father, mary left swing went meet him, pushing back pink kerchief smiling afar involuntary smile loving pleasure. “i came look you, mary,” said mr. garth. “let u walk bit.” mary knew quite well father something particular say: eyebrow made pathetic angle, tender gravity voice: thing sign letty’s age. put arm within his, turned row nut-trees. “it sad married, mary,” said father, looking her, end stick held hand. “not sad while, father—i mean merry,” said mary, laughingly. “i single merry four-and-twenty year more: suppose quite long that.” then, little pause, said, gravely, bending face father’s, “if contented fred?” caleb screwed mouth turned head aside wisely. “now, father, praise last wednesday. said uncommon notion stock, good eye things.” “did i?” said caleb, rather slyly. “yes, put down, date, _anno domini_, everything,” said mary. “you like thing neatly booked. behavior you, father, really good; deep respect you; impossible better temper fred has.” “ay, ay; want coax thinking fine match.” “no, indeed, father. don’t love fine match.” “what for, then?” “oh, dear, always loved him. never like scolding one else well; point thought husband.” “your mind quite settled, then, mary?” said caleb, returning first tone. “there’s wish come since thing going late?” (caleb meant great deal vague phrase;) “because, better late never. woman must force heart—she’ll man good that.” “my feeling changed, father,” said mary, calmly. “i shall constant fred long constant me. don’t think either u could spare other, like one else better, however much might admire them. would make great difference us—like seeing old place altered, changing name everything. must wait long while; fred know that.” instead speaking immediately, caleb stood still screwed stick grassy walk. said, emotion voice, “well, i’ve got bit news. think fred going live stone court, managing land there?” “how ever be, father?” said mary, wonderingly. “he would manage aunt bulstrode. poor woman begging praying. want lad good, might fine thing him. saving, might gradually buy stock, turn farming.” “oh, fred would happy! good believe.” “ah, mind you,” said caleb, turning head warningly, “i must take _my_ shoulders, responsible, see everything; grieve mother bit, though mayn’t say so. fred need careful.” “perhaps much, father,” said mary, checked joy. “there would happiness bringing fresh trouble.” “nay, nay; work delight, child, doesn’t vex mother. then, fred get married,” caleb’s voice shook perceptibly, “he’ll steady saving; you’ve got mother’s cleverness, mine too, woman’s sort way; you’ll keep order. he’ll coming by-and-by, wanted tell first, think you’d like tell _him_ yourself. that, could talk well him, could go business nature things.” “oh, dear good father!” cried mary, putting hand round father’s neck, bent head placidly, willing caressed. “i wonder girl think father best man world!” “nonsense, child; you’ll think husband better.” “impossible,” said mary, relapsing usual tone; “husbands inferior class men, require keeping order.” entering house letty, run join them, mary saw fred orchard-gate, went meet him. “what fine clothes wear, extravagant youth!” said mary, fred stood still raised hat playful formality. “you learning economy.” “now bad, mary,” said fred. “just look edge coat-cuffs! dint good brushing look respectable. saving three suits—one wedding-suit.” “how droll look!—like gentleman old fashion-book.” “oh no, keep two years.” “two years! reasonable, fred,” said mary, turning walk. “don’t encourage flattering expectations.” “why not? one life better unflattering ones. can’t married two years, truth quite bad enough comes.” “i heard story young gentleman encouraged flattering expectations, harm.” “mary, you’ve got something discouraging tell me, shall bolt; shall go house mr. garth. spirits. father cut up—home like itself. can’t bear bad news.” “should call bad news told live stone court, manage farm, remarkably prudent, save money every year till stock furniture own, distinguished agricultural character, mr. borthrop trumbull says—rather stout, fear, greek latin sadly weather-worn?” “you don’t mean anything except nonsense, mary?” said fred, coloring slightly nevertheless. “that father told may happen, never talk nonsense,” said mary, looking fred now, grasped hand walked, till rather hurt her; would complain. “oh, could tremendously good fellow then, mary, could married directly.” “not fast, sir; know would rather defer marriage years? would leave time misbehave, liked one else better, excuse jilting you.” “pray don’t joke, mary,” said fred, strong feeling. “tell seriously true, happy it—because love best.” “it true, fred, happy it—because love best,” said mary, tone obedient recitation. lingered door-step steep-roofed porch, fred almost whisper said— “when first engaged, umbrella-ring, mary, used to—” spirit joy began laugh decidedly mary’s eyes, fatal ben came running door brownie yapping behind him, and, bouncing them, said— “fred mary! ever coming in?—or may eat cake?” finale. every limit beginning well ending. quit young life long company them, desire know befell after-years? fragment life, however typical, sample even web: promise may kept, ardent outset may followed declension; latent power may find long-waited opportunity; past error may urge grand retrieval. marriage, bourne many narratives, still great beginning, adam eve, kept honeymoon eden, first little one among thorn thistle wilderness. still beginning home epic—the gradual conquest irremediable loss complete union make advancing year climax, age harvest sweet memory common. set out, like crusader old, glorious equipment hope enthusiasm get broken way, wanting patience world. cared fred vincy mary garth like know two made failure, achieved solid mutual happiness. fred surprised neighbor various ways. became rather distinguished side county theoretic practical farmer, produced work “cultivation green crop economy cattle-feeding” high congratulation agricultural meetings. middlemarch admiration reserved: person inclined believe merit fred’s authorship due wife, since never expected fred vincy write turnip mangel-wurzel. mary wrote little book boys, called “stories great men, taken plutarch,” printed published gripp & co., middlemarch, every one town willing give credit work fred, observing university, “where ancient studied,” might clergyman chosen. way made clear middlemarch never deceived, need praise anybody writing book, since always done somebody else. moreover, fred remained unswervingly steady. year marriage told mary happiness half owing farebrother, gave strong pull-up right moment. cannot say never misled hopefulness: yield crop profit cattle sale usually fell estimate; always prone believe could make money purchase horse turned badly—though this, mary observed, course fault horse, fred’s judgment. kept love horsemanship, rarely allowed day’s hunting; so, remarkable submitted laughed cowardliness fences, seeming see mary boy sitting five-barred gate, showing curly head hedge ditch. three boys: mary discontented brought forth men-children only; fred wished girl like her, said, laughingly, “that would great trial mother.” mrs. vincy declining years, diminished lustre housekeeping, much comforted perception two least fred’s boy real vincys, “feature garths.” mary secretly rejoiced youngest three much father must wore round jacket, showed marvellous nicety aim playing marbles, throwing stone bring mellow pears. ben letty garth, uncle aunt well teens, disputed much whether nephew niece desirable; ben contending clear girl good le boys, else would always petticoats, showed little meant for; whereupon letty, argued much books, got angry replying god made coat skin adam eve alike—also occurred east men wore petticoats. latter argument, obscuring majesty former, one many, ben answered contemptuously, “the spooneys they!” immediately appealed mother whether boy better girls. mrs. garth pronounced alike naughty, boy undoubtedly stronger, could run faster, throw precision greater distance. oracular sentence ben well satisfied, minding naughtiness; letty took ill, feeling superiority stronger muscles. fred never became rich—his hopefulness led expect that; gradually saved enough become owner stock furniture stone court, work mr. garth put hand carried plenty “bad times” always present farmers. mary, matronly days, became solid figure mother; but, unlike her, gave boy little formal teaching, mrs. garth alarmed lest never well grounded grammar geography. nevertheless, found quite forward enough went school; perhaps, liked nothing well mother. fred riding home winter evening pleasant vision beforehand bright hearth wainscoted parlor, sorry men could mary wife; especially mr. farebrother. “he ten time worthier was,” fred could say her, magnanimously. “to sure was,” mary answered; “and reason could better without me. you—i shudder think would been—a curate debt horse-hire cambric pocket-handkerchiefs!” inquiry might possibly found fred mary still inhabit stone court—that creeping plant still
