(1)   Please do not provide an estimate of both CO2 emissions and CO2 removals.  You should estimate “net” emissions of CO2 and place a single number in either the CO2
emissions or CO2 removals column, as appropriate.  Please note that for the purposes of reporting, the signs for uptake are always (-) and for emissions (+).
