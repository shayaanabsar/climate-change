ANNEX 1
MANAGING UNCERTAINTIES
Uncertainties are inevitable in any estimate of national emissions or removals.
Some important causes of uncertainty are:
•
differing interpretations of source and sink category or other definitions,
assumptions, units etc.
•
use of simplified representations with "averaged" values, especially emission
factors and related assumptions to represent characteristics of a given
population
•
uncertainty in the basic socio-economic activity data which drives the
calculations
•
inherent uncertainty in the scientific understanding of the basic processes
leading to emissions and removals.
A major objective of the IPCC methodology is to help national experts reduce
uncertainty in their greenhouse gas inventories to the minimum level possible.
However, the approach also recognises that significant uncertainties will remain
despite these efforts, and that these uncertainties will vary widely:
•
between different greenhouse gases
•
between source categories for each gas
•
between countries reporting the same gases and sources (depending on
approach, levels of detail, use of default or country specific data etc.)
It is important to provide as thorough an understanding as possible of the
uncertainties involved when estimates are provided for scientific or policy uses. A
simple method for expressing the confidence or uncertainty of point estimates
qualitatively is given elsewhere in the Reporting Instructions. However it is more
useful to express uncertainty quantitatively and systematically in the form of
well developed confidence intervals. This Annex provides some initial suggestions
for developing quantitative uncertainty information. However, at present, it is
only possible to provide a conceptual framework which relies on users to supply
statistical data or equivalent expert judgement. IPCC/OECD consider the
consistent  estimation of uncertainty to be critically important, and will make it
the focus of future work. Individual experts are encouraged to estimate
uncertainty ranges as well as possible and to report results with their inventories.
This will be of assistance with the ongoing work of developing methods.

Chapter 1 Understanding the Common Reporting Framework.
E s t i m a t i o n  M e t h o d o l o g y
The IPCC/OECD programme has sought consensus among researchers,
sectoral interest groups and national technical experts on the best
practicable default estimation procedures for priority gases and sources.
These default methodologies are described in Volume 2 of the Guidelines,
the Greenhouse Gas Inventory Workbook. By using these methods countries
can minimise variations or uncertainties in national estimates which would
be introduced by a choice of methodology. However, it must be recognised
that default methods represent a compromise between the level of detail
which would be needed to create the most accurate estimates for each
country and the input data likely to be available or readily obtainable in
most countries. In many cases, the simplest default methods are
simplifications with general default values which introduce large
uncertainties into a national estimate. Within many of the default methods
different optional levels of detail are provided to reflect whether users have
detailed data for their national situation or have to rely strictly on general
default values. There may be considerable variation in how well the general
default values represent conditions of the actual population of source
activities in a particular country. For example, the uncertainty relating to
default carbon emission coefficients for the global population of fossil fuel
combustion sources may be characterised as quite low (5-10 per cent) in
the IPCC methodology; but national experts for a particular country may
know that the characteristics of such fuels in their country vary widely from
global average values. In such a country, use of default values would
introduce a larger uncertainty. Thus, even for the simplest application of the
default methods, it is not possible to provide general uncertainty values for
all countries.
The Reference Manual provides more options, including ways of doing
calculations at greater levels of detail and, in some cases, alternative
methodologies. Users of the IPCC Guidelines may use their own methodologies
if they believe these will provide more accurate results for their national
situation. Alternative methods should be carefully documented and results
reported in the standard IPCC source and sink categories. Documentation of
alternative methods may involve presentation of new empirical data which may
in turn provide a basis for the improvement of the default procedures and data.
However, whichever methods are used - default methods, more detailed
versions of default methods, or entirely different methods - users should
determine as far as possible the ranges of uncertainty introduced by the
emission factors and other input assumptions used, whatever their source.
S o c i o - e c o n o m i c  A c t i v i t y  D a t a
The IPCC default methodologies identify activity data from international
socio-economic data series wherever possible. International compilations of
socio-economic activity data do not generally include quantitative
uncertainty estimates around country-level data summaries. Some of the
national sources that provide data to the international series may have

quantified uncertainty for their own national data. As with uncertainty in
methodology and emission factors, the inventory developers must judge the
quality of activity data used in their own national inventory.

Current scientific understanding of the various human-induced processes
which lead to emissions and removals of greenhouse gases to and from the
atmosphere is incomplete. In some cases, where substantial measurement
data exist and have been thoroughly analysed, this understanding provides a
basis for accurate calculations of global and national emissions. In many
cases, however, data and analysis have not attained this state. This variation
affects the uncertainty inherent in the various components of the default
methods, as well as the estimates using other methodologies. Table A1-1
provides an illustrative assessment of the relative uncertainties in the
scientific basis for global emission estimates for some key components of
the IPCC methodology. The overall uncertainty ranges shown here are
based on an interpretation of the uncertainty information presented by the
IPCC (1992). The allocation of overall uncertainty to the emission factor
and activity data components has been made for illustrative purposes only
on the basis of judgement by the IPCC/OECD technical staff. These values
should not be used for estimating uncertainty for a particular national
inventory. They are provided to assist users of the Guidelines to consider
relative uncertainties in the basic science underlying different components
of their inventories.

A1.2 Procedures for Quantifying
Uncertainty
E s t i m a t i n g  U n c e r t a i n t y  o f  C o m p o n e n t s
To estimate uncertainty by source category and gas for a national inventory,
it is necessary to develop information like that shown in Table A1-1, but
specific to the individual country, methodology and data sources used. In
scientific and process control literature the 95 per cent (± 2) confidence
limit is often regarded as appropriate for range definition. Where there is
sufficient information to define the underlying probability distribution for
conventional statistical analysis, a 95 per cent confidence interval should be
calculated as a definition of the range. Uncertainty ranges can be estimated
using classical analysis (see Robinson) or the Monte Carlo technique (in
Eggleston, 1993). Otherwise the range will have to be assessed by national
experts.

If possible ranges should be developed separately for

(column 3 of Table A1-1).

C o m b i n i n g  U n c e r t a i n t i e s
It is necessary to derive the overall uncertainty arising from the
combination of emission factor and activity data uncertainty. IPCC/OECD
suggest that emission factor and activity data ranges are regarded as
estimates of the 95 per cent confidence interval, expressed as a percentage
of the point estimate, around each of two independent components (either
from statistically based calculations or informal ex ante judgements).
On this interpretation (for quoted ranges extending not more than 60 per
cent above or below the point estimate) the appropriate measure of overall
percentage uncertainty UT for the emissions estimate would be given by the
square root of the sum of the squares of the percentage uncertainties
associated with the emission factor (UE) and the activity data (UA). That is,
for each source category:

For individual uncertainties greater than 60 per cent the sum of squares
procedure is not valid. All that can be done is to combine limiting values to
define an overall range, though this leads to upper and lower limiting values
which are asymmetrical about the central estimate2.
Estimated total emission for each gas is of course the summation Σ Ci
where Ci is the central estimate of the emission of the gas in the source
category. The appropriate measure of uncertainty in total emissions in
emissions units (not percentages) is then:

where UT,i is the overall percentage uncertainty for the source category of
the gas from Table A1-1. Source categories for which symmetrical limiting
values cannot be defined (because UE or UA exceeds 60 per cent)
cannot sensibly be treated in this way. The uncertainty might be handled  by
reporting that total emissions from gas X are estimated to be Y Mt, of
which Y1 Mt had an estimated uncertainty of ± E1 Mt and Y2 Mt had a range
of uncertainty between - L Mt and + U Mt.
                                                  
     1 The 60% limit is imposed because the rule suggested for UT requires σ
to be less than about 30% of the central estimate, and we are interpreting
the quoted range as ±2σ
     2 If uncertainties due to the emission factor and the activity data are
± E% and ± A% respectively, and the upper and the lower limits of overall
uncertainty are U% and L% respectively, then  U% = (E+A+E.A/100) and
L% = (E+A-E.A/100).

A1.3 Implications
If the assumptions in Table A1.1 are correct then typical uncertainties in
national emissions estimates range between:
•
± 10% for CO2 from fossil fuels although this may be lower for some
countries with good data and where source categories are well defined
(IPCC, 1993;  von Hippel et al., 1993)
•
± 20% and ± 100% for individual methane sources (though the overall
error might be ± 30%)
•
perhaps two orders of magnitude for estimates of nitrous oxide from
agricultural soils
These uncertainties will affect the level of quantitative understanding of
atmospheric cycles of greenhouse gases that can be derived using the
summation of inventories.
The situation is less critical for monitoring emissions mitigation options,
because the profile of the emissions time series will be relatively insensitive
to revisions to the emissions estimation methodology. However very
different levels of uncertainty for different gases will be inevitable for some
time to come, and this will need to be recognised in any move towards a
comprehensive approach to greenhouse gas mitigation.
