Executive Summary
This chapter takes sustainable development as the starting point 
and focus for analysis. It considers the broad and multifaceted 
bi-directional interplay between sustainable development, including 
its focus on eradicating poverty and reducing inequality in their 
multidimensional aspects, and climate actions in a 1.5°C warmer world. 
These fundamental connections are embedded in the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs). The chapter also examines synergies 
and trade-offs of adaptation and mitigation options with sustainable 
development and the SDGs and offers insights into possible pathways, 
especially climate-resilient development pathways towards a 1.5°C 
warmer world.
Sustainable Development, Poverty and Inequality 
in a 1.5°C Warmer World
Limiting global warming to 1.5°C rather than 2°C above pre-
industrial levels would make it markedly easier to achieve many 
aspects of sustainable development, with greater potential to 
eradicate poverty and reduce inequalities (medium evidence, 
high agreement). Impacts avoided with the lower temperature 
limit could reduce the number of people exposed to climate risks and 
vulnerable to poverty by 62 to 457 million, and lessen the risks of 
poor people to experience food and water insecurity, adverse health 
impacts, and economic losses, particularly in regions that already face 
development challenges (medium evidence, medium agreement). 
{5.2.2, 5.2.3} Avoided impacts expected to occur between 1.5°C and 
2°C warming would also make it easier to achieve certain SDGs, such as 
those that relate to poverty, hunger, health, water and sanitation, cities 
and ecosystems (SDGs 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 14 and 15) (medium evidence, 
high agreement). {5.2.3, Table 5.2 available at the end of the chapter}
Compared to current conditions, 1.5°C of global warming would 
nonetheless pose heightened risks to eradicating poverty, 
reducing inequalities and ensuring human and ecosystem well-
being (medium evidence, high agreement). Warming of 1.5°C is 
not considered ‘safe’ for most nations, communities, ecosystems and 
sectors and poses significant risks to natural and human systems as 
compared to the current warming of 1°C (high confidence). {Cross-
Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 5} The impacts of 1.5°C of warming would 
disproportionately affect disadvantaged and vulnerable populations 
through food insecurity, higher food prices, income losses, lost 
livelihood opportunities, adverse health impacts and population 
displacements (medium evidence, high agreement). {5.2.1} Some of 
the worst impacts on sustainable development are expected to be 
felt among agricultural and coastal dependent livelihoods, indigenous 
people, children and the elderly, poor labourers, poor urban dwellers in 
African cities, and people and ecosystems in the Arctic and Small Island 
Developing States (SIDS) (medium evidence, high agreement). {5.2.1, 
Box 5.3, Chapter 3, Box 3.5, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 4}
Climate Adaptation and Sustainable Development
Prioritization of sustainable development and meeting the 
SDGs is consistent with efforts to adapt to climate change (high 
confidence). Many strategies for sustainable development enable 
transformational adaptation for a 1.5°C warmer world, provided 
attention is paid to reducing poverty in all its forms and to promoting 
equity and participation in decision-making (medium evidence, high 
agreement). As such, sustainable development has the potential 
to significantly reduce systemic vulnerability, enhance adaptive 
capacity, and promote livelihood security for poor and disadvantaged 
populations (high confidence). {5.3.1}
Synergies between adaptation strategies and the SDGs are 
expected to hold true in a 1.5°C warmer world, across sectors 
and contexts (medium evidence, medium agreement). Synergies 
between adaptation and sustainable development are significant 
for agriculture and health, advancing SDGs 1 (extreme poverty), 
2 (hunger), 3 (healthy lives and well-being) and 6 (clean water) (robust 
evidence, medium agreement). {5.3.2} Ecosystem- and community-
based adaptation, along with the incorporation of indigenous and 
local knowledge, advances synergies with SDGs 5 (gender equality), 
10 (reducing inequalities) and 16 (inclusive societies), as exemplified 
in drylands and the Arctic (high evidence, medium agreement). {5.3.2, 
Box 5.1, Cross-Chapter Box 10 in Chapter 4}
Adaptation strategies can result in trade-offs with and among 
the SDGs (medium evidence, high agreement). Strategies that 
advance one SDG may create negative consequences for other 
SDGs, for instance SDGs 3 (health) versus 7 (energy consumption) 
and agricultural adaptation and SDG 2 (food security) versus SDGs 3 
(health), 5 (gender equality), 6 (clean water), 10 (reducing inequalities), 
14 (life below water) and 15 (life on the land) (medium evidence, 
medium agreement). {5.3.2}
Pursuing place-specific adaptation pathways towards a 1.5°C 
warmer world has the potential for significant positive outcomes 
for well-being in countries at all levels of development (medium 
evidence, high agreement). Positive outcomes emerge when 
adaptation pathways (i) ensure a diversity of adaptation options based 
on people’s values and the trade-offs they consider acceptable, (ii) 
maximize synergies with sustainable development through inclusive, 
participatory and deliberative processes, and (iii) facilitate equitable 
transformation. Yet such pathways would be difficult to achieve 
without redistributive measures to overcome path dependencies, 
uneven power structures, and entrenched social inequalities (medium 
evidence, high agreement). {5.3.3}
Mitigation and Sustainable Development
The deployment of mitigation options consistent with 1.5°C 
pathways leads to multiple synergies across a range of 
sustainable development dimensions. At the same time, the 
rapid pace and magnitude of change that would be required 
to limit warming to 1.5°C, if not carefully managed, would lead 
to trade-offs with some sustainable development dimensions 
(high confidence). The number of synergies between mitigation 
response options and sustainable development exceeds the number 
of trade-offs in energy demand and supply sectors; agriculture, forestry 
and other land use (AFOLU); and for oceans (very high confidence). 
{Figure 5.2, Table 5.2 available at the end of the chapter} The 1.5°C 
Chapter 5 
Sustainable Development, Poverty Eradication and Reducing Inequalities

pathways indicate robust synergies, particularly for the SDGs 3 (health), 
7 (energy), 12 (responsible consumption and production) and 14 
(oceans) (very high confidence). {5.4.2, Figure 5.3} For SDGs 1 (poverty), 
2 (hunger), 6 (water) and 7 (energy), there is a risk of trade-offs or 
negative side effects from stringent mitigation actions compatible with 
1.5°C of warming (medium evidence, high agreement). {5.4.2}
Appropriately designed mitigation actions to reduce energy 
demand can advance multiple SDGs simultaneously. Pathways 
compatible with 1.5°C that feature low energy demand show the 
most pronounced synergies and the lowest number of trade-offs 
with respect to sustainable development and the SDGs (very high 
confidence). Accelerating energy efficiency in all sectors has synergies 
with SDGs 7 (energy), 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure), 
11 (sustainable cities and communities), 12 (responsible consumption 
and production), 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), and 
17 (partnerships for the goals) (robust evidence, high agreement). 
{5.4.1, Figure 5.2, Table 5.2} Low-demand pathways, which would 
reduce or completely avoid the reliance on bioenergy with carbon 
capture and storage (BECCS) in 1.5°C pathways, would result in 
significantly reduced pressure on food security, lower food prices and 
fewer people at risk of hunger (medium evidence, high agreement). 
{5.4.2, Figure 5.3}
The impacts of carbon dioxide removal options on SDGs depend 
on the type of options and the scale of deployment (high 
confidence). If poorly implemented, carbon dioxide removal (CDR) 
options such as bioenergy, BECCS and AFOLU would lead to trade-
offs. Appropriate design and implementation requires considering 
local people’s needs, biodiversity and other sustainable development 
dimensions (very high confidence). {5.4.1.3, Cross-Chapter Box 7 in 
Chapter 3}
The design of the mitigation portfolios and policy instruments 
to limit warming to 1.5°C will largely determine the overall 
synergies and trade-offs between mitigation and sustainable 
development (very high confidence). Redistributive policies 
that shield the poor and vulnerable can resolve trade-offs for 
a range of SDGs (medium evidence, high agreement). Individual 
mitigation options are associated with both positive and negative 
interactions with the SDGs (very high confidence). {5.4.1} However, 
appropriate choices across the mitigation portfolio can help to 
maximize positive side effects while minimizing negative side effects 
(high confidence). {5.4.2, 5.5.2} Investment needs for complementary 
policies resolving trade-offs with a range of SDGs are only a small 
fraction of the overall mitigation investments in 1.5°C pathways 
(medium evidence, high agreement). {5.4.2, Figure 5.4} Integration of 
mitigation with adaptation and sustainable development compatible 
with 1.5°C warming requires a systems perspective (high confidence). 
{5.4.2, 5.5.2}
Mitigation consistent with 1.5°C of warming create high risks 
for sustainable development in countries with high dependency 
on fossil fuels for revenue and employment generation (high 
confidence). These risks are caused by the reduction of global demand 
affecting mining activity and export revenues and challenges to rapidly 
decrease high carbon intensity of the domestic economy (robust 
evidence, high agreement). {5.4.1.2, Box 5.2} Targeted policies that 
promote diversification of the economy and the energy sector could 
ease this transition (medium evidence, high agreement). {5.4.1.2, 
Box 5.2}
Sustainable Development Pathways to 1.5°C
Sustainable development broadly supports and often enables 
the fundamental societal and systems transformations that 
would be required for limiting warming to 1.5°C above pre-
industrial levels (high confidence). Simulated pathways that 
feature the most sustainable worlds (e.g., Shared Socio-Economic 
Pathways (SSP) 1) are associated with relatively lower mitigation and 
adaptation challenges and limit warming to 1.5°C at comparatively 
lower mitigation costs. In contrast, development pathways with high 
fragmentation, inequality and poverty (e.g., SSP3) are associated with 
comparatively higher mitigation and adaptation challenges. In such 
pathways, it is not possible to limit warming to 1.5°C for the vast 
majority of the integrated assessment models (medium evidence, 
high agreement). {5.5.2} In all SSPs, mitigation costs substantially 
increase in 1.5°C pathways compared to 2°C pathways. No pathway 
in the literature integrates or achieves all 17 SDGs (high confidence). 
{5.5.2} Real-world experiences at the project level show that the 
actual integration between adaptation, mitigation and sustainable 
development is challenging as it requires reconciling trade-offs across 
sectors and spatial scales (very high confidence). {5.5.1}
Without societal transformation and rapid implementation 
of ambitious greenhouse gas reduction measures, pathways 
to limiting warming to 1.5°C and achieving sustainable 
development will be exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, 
to achieve (high confidence). The potential for pursuing such 
pathways differs between and within nations and regions, due to 
different development trajectories, opportunities and challenges (very 
high confidence). {5.5.3.2, Figure 5.1} Limiting warming to 1.5°C 
would require all countries and non-state actors to strengthen their 
contributions without delay. This could be achieved through sharing 
efforts based on bolder and more committed cooperation, with support 
for those with the least capacity to adapt, mitigate and transform 
(medium evidence, high agreement). {5.5.3.1, 5.5.3.2} Current 
efforts towards reconciling low-carbon trajectories and reducing 
inequalities, including those that avoid difficult trade-offs associated 
with transformation, are partially successful yet demonstrate notable 
obstacles (medium evidence, medium agreement). {5.5.3.3, Box 5.3, 
Cross-Chapter Box 13 in this chapter}
Social justice and equity are core aspects of climate-resilient 
development pathways for transformational social change. 
Addressing challenges and widening opportunities between 
and within countries and communities would be necessary 
to achieve sustainable development and limit warming to 
1.5°C, without making the poor and disadvantaged worse off 
(high confidence). Identifying and navigating inclusive and socially 
acceptable pathways towards low-carbon, climate-resilient futures is a 
challenging yet important endeavour, fraught with moral, practical and 
political difficulties and inevitable trade-offs (very high confidence). 
{5.5.2, 5.5.3.3, Box 5.3} It entails deliberation and problem-solving

processes to negotiate societal values, well-being, risks and resilience 
and to determine what is desirable and fair, and to whom (medium 
evidence, high agreement). Pathways that encompass joint, iterative 
planning and transformative visions, for instance in Pacific SIDS 
like Vanuatu and in urban contexts, show potential for liveable and 
sustainable futures (high confidence). {5.5.3.1, 5.5.3.3, Figure 5.5, 
Box 5.3, Cross-Chapter Box 13 in this chapter}
The fundamental societal and systemic changes to achieve 
sustainable development, eradicate poverty and reduce 
inequalities while limiting warming to 1.5°C would require 
meeting a set of institutional, social, cultural, economic and 
technological conditions (high confidence). The coordination 
and monitoring of policy actions across sectors and spatial scales 
is essential to support sustainable development in 1.5°C warmer 
conditions (very high confidence). {5.6.2, Box 5.3} External funding 
and technology transfer better support these efforts when they 
consider recipients’ context-specific needs (medium evidence, high 
agreement). {5.6.1} Inclusive processes can facilitate transformations 
by ensuring participation, transparency, capacity building and iterative 
social learning (high confidence). {5.5.3.3, Cross-Chapter Box 13, 
5.6.3} Attention to power asymmetries and unequal opportunities 
for development, among and within countries, is key to adopting 
1.5°C-compatible development pathways that benefit all populations 
(high confidence). {5.5.3, 5.6.4, Box 5.3} Re-examining individual and 
collective values could help spur urgent, ambitious and cooperative 
change (medium evidence, high agreement). {5.5.3, 5.6.5}

5.1 
Scope and Delineations
This chapter takes sustainable development as the starting point and 
focus for analysis, considering the broader bi-directional interplay 
and multifaceted interactions between development patterns and 
climate actions in a 1.5°C warmer world and in the context of 
eradicating poverty and reducing inequality. It assesses the impacts 
of keeping temperatures at or below 1.5°C of global warming above 
pre-industrial levels on sustainable development and compares the 
impacts avoided at 1.5°C compared to 2°C (Section 5.2). It then 
examines the interactions, synergies and trade-offs of adaptation 
(Section 5.3) and mitigation (Section 5.4) measures with sustainable 
development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The 
chapter offers insights into possible pathways towards a 1.5°C 
warmer world, especially through climate-resilient development 
pathways providing a comprehensive vision across different contexts 
(Section 5.5). The chapter also identifies the conditions that would be 
needed to simultaneously achieve sustainable development, poverty 
eradication, the reduction of inequalities, and the 1.5°C climate 
objective (Section 5.6).
5.1.1 
Sustainable Development, SDGs, Poverty 
Eradication and Reducing Inequalities
Chapter 1 (see Cross-Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 1) defines sustainable 
development as ‘development that meets the needs of the present 
and future generations’ through balancing economic, social and 
environmental considerations, and then introduces the United Nations 
(UN) 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which sets out 
17 ambitious goals for sustainable development for all countries by 
2030. These SDGs are: no poverty (SDG 1), zero hunger (SDG 2), good 
health and well-being (SDG 3), quality education (SDG 4), gender 
equality (SDG 5), clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), affordable and 
clean energy (SDG 7), decent work and economic growth (SDG 8), 
industry, innovation and infrastructure (SDG 9), reduced inequalities 
(SDG 10), sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11), responsible 
consumption and production (SDG 12), climate action (SDG 13), life 
below water (SDG 14), life on land (SDG 15), peace, justice and strong 
institutions (SDG 16) and partnerships for the goals (SDG 17).
The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) included extensive discussion 
of links between climate and sustainable development, especially in 
Chapter 13 (Olsson et al., 2014) and Chapter 20 (Denton et al., 2014) 
in Working Group II and Chapter 4 (Fleurbaey et al., 2014) in Working 
Group III. However, the AR5 preceded the 2015 adoption of the SDGs 
and the literature that argues for their fundamental links to climate 
(Wright et al., 2015; Salleh, 2016; von Stechow et al., 2016; Hammill 
and Price-Kelly, 2017; ICSU, 2017; Maupin, 2017; Gomez-Echeverri, 
2018).
The SDGs build on efforts under the UN Millennium Development Goals 
to reduce poverty, hunger, and other deprivations. According to the UN, 
the Millennium Development Goals were successful in reducing poverty 
and hunger and improving water security (UN, 2015a). However, critics 
argued that they failed to address within-country disparities, human 
rights and key environmental concerns, focused only on developing 
countries, and had numerous measurement and attribution problems 
(Langford et al., 2013; Fukuda-Parr et al., 2014). While improvements 
in water security, slums and health may have reduced some aspects 
of climate vulnerability, increases in incomes were linked to rising 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and thus to a trade-off between 
development and climate change (Janetos et al., 2012; UN, 2015a; 
Hubacek et al., 2017).
While the SDGs capture many important aspects of sustainable 
development, including the explicit goals of poverty eradication 
and reducing inequality, there are direct connections from 
climate to other measures of sustainable development including 
multidimensional poverty, equity, ethics, human security, well-
being and climate-resilient development (Bebbington and 
Larrinaga, 2014; Robertson, 2014; Redclift and Springett, 2015; 
Barrington-Leigh, 2016; Helliwell et al., 2018; Kirby and O’Mahony, 
2018) (see Glossary). The UN proposes sustainable development 
as ‘eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, combating 
inequality within and among countries, preserving the planet, 
creating sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth and 
fostering social inclusion’ (UN, 2015b). There is robust evidence 
of the links between climate change and poverty (see Chapter 1, 
Cross-Chapter Box 4). The AR5 concluded with high confidence 
that disruptive levels of climate change would preclude reducing 
poverty (Denton et al., 2014; Fleurbaey et al., 2014). International 
organizations have since stated that climate changes ‘undermine 
the ability of all countries to achieve sustainable development’ (UN, 
2015b) and can reverse or erase improvements in living conditions 
and decades of development (Hallegatte et al., 2016).
Climate warming has unequal impacts on different people and places 
as a result of differences in regional climate changes, vulnerabilities 
and impacts, and these differences then result in unequal impacts 
on sustainable development and poverty (Section 5.2). Responses to 
climate change also interact in complex ways with goals of poverty 
reduction. The benefits of adaptation and mitigation projects and 
funding may accrue to some and not others, responses may be costly 
and unaffordable to some people and countries, and projects may 
disadvantage some individuals, groups and development initiatives 
(Sections 5.3 and 5.4, Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 4).
5.1.2 
Pathways to 1.5°C
Pathways to 1.5°C (see Chapter 1, Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1, 
Glossary) include ambitious reductions in emissions and strategies for 
adaptation that are transformational, as well as complex interactions 
with sustainable development, poverty eradication and reducing 
inequalities. The AR5 WGII introduced the concept of climate-
resilient development pathways (CRDPs) (see Glossary) which 
combine adaptation and mitigation to reduce climate change and 
its impacts, and emphasize the importance of addressing structural 
and intersecting inequalities, marginalization and multidimensional 
poverty to ‘transform […] the development pathways themselves 
towards greater social and environmental sustainability, equity, 
resilience, and justice’ (Olsson et al., 2014). This chapter assesses 
literature on CRDPs relevant to 1.5°C global warming (Section 5.5.3), 
to understand better the possible societal and systems transformations 
(see Glossary) that reduce inequality and increase well-being

(Figure 5.1). It also summarizes the knowledge on conditions to 
achieve such transformations, including changes in technologies, 
culture, values, financing and institutions that support low-carbon 
and resilient pathways and sustainable development (Section 5.6).
Figure 5.1 |  Climate-resilient development pathways (CRDPs) (green arrows) between a current world in which countries and communities exist at different levels of 
development (A) and future worlds that range from climate-resilient (bottom) to unsustainable (top) (D). CRDPs involve societal transformation rather than business-as-usual 
approaches, and all pathways involve adaptation and mitigation choices and trade-offs (B). Pathways that achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 and beyond, 
strive for net zero emissions around mid-21st century, and stay within the global 1.5°C warming target by the end of the 21st century, while ensuring equity and well-being for 
all, are best positioned to achieve climate-resilient futures (C). Overshooting on the path to 1.5°C will make achieving CRDPs and other sustainable trajectories more difficult; 
yet, the limited literature does not allow meaningful estimates.
5.1.3 
Types of Evidence 
A variety of sources of evidence are used to assess the interactions 
of sustainable development and the SDGs with the causes, impacts 
and responses to climate change of 1.5°C warming. This chapter builds 
on Chapter 3 to assess the sustainable development implications of 
impacts at 1.5°C and 2°C, and on Chapter 4 to examine the implications 
of response measures. Scientific and grey literature, with a post-
AR5 focus, and data that evaluate, measure and model sustainable 
development–climate links from various perspectives, quantitatively 
and qualitatively, across scales, and through well-documented case 
studies are assessed.
Literature that explicitly links 1.5°C global warming to sustainable 
development across scales remains scarce; yet we find relevant insights 
in many recent publications on climate and development that assess 
impacts across warming levels, the effects of adaptation and mitigation 
response measures, and interactions with the SDGs. Relevant evidence 
also stems from emerging literature on possible pathways, overshoot 
and enabling conditions (see Glossary) for integrating sustainable 
development, poverty eradication and reducing inequalities in the 
context of 1.5°C.
5.2 
Poverty, Equality and Equity Implications 
of a 1.5°C Warmer World
Climate change could lead to significant impacts on extreme poverty 
by 2030 (Hallegatte et al., 2016; Hallegatte and Rozenberg, 2017). 
The AR5 concluded, with very high confidence, that climate change 
and climate variability worsen existing poverty and exacerbate 
inequalities, especially for those disadvantaged by gender, age, race, 
class, caste, indigeneity and (dis)ability (Olsson et al., 2014). New 
literature on these links is substantial, showing that the poor will 
continue to experience climate change severely, and climate change 
will exacerbate poverty (very high confidence) (Fankhauser and 
Stern, 2016; Hallegatte et al., 2016; O’Neill et al., 2017a; Winsemius 
et al., 2018). The understanding of regional impacts and risks of 
1.5°C global warming and interactions with patterns of societal

vulnerability and poverty remains limited. Yet identifying and 
addressing poverty and inequality is at the core of staying within 
a safe and just space for humanity (Raworth, 2017; Bathiany et al., 
2018). Building on relevant findings from Chapter 3 (see Section 3.4), 
this section examines anticipated impacts and risks of 1.5°C and 
higher warming on sustainable development, poverty, inequality and 
equity (see Glossary).
5.2.1 
Impacts and Risks of a 1.5°C Warmer World: 
Implications for Poverty and Livelihoods
Global warming of 1.5°C will have consequences for sustainable 
development, poverty and inequalities. This includes residual risks, 
limits to adaptation, and losses and damages (Cross-Chapter Box 12 
in this chapter; see Glossary). Some regions have already experienced 
a 1.5°C warming, with impacts on food and water security, health and 
other components of sustainable development (medium evidence, 
medium agreement) (see Chapter 3, Section 3.4). Climate change is also 
already affecting poorer subsistence communities through decreases 
in crop production and quality, increases in crop pests and diseases, 
and disruption to culture (Savo et al., 2016). It disproportionally affects 
children and the elderly and can increase gender inequality (Kaijser 
and Kronsell, 2014; Vinyeta et al., 2015; Carter et al., 2016; Hanna and 
Oliva, 2016; Li et al., 2016).
At 1.5°C warming, compared to current conditions, further negative 
consequences are expected for poor people, and inequality and 
vulnerability (medium evidence, high agreement). Hallegatte and 
Rozenberg (2017) report that by 2030 (roughly approximating a 1.5°C 
warming), 122 million additional people could experience extreme 
poverty, based on a ‘poverty scenario’ of limited socio-economic 
progress, comparable to the Shared Socio-Economic Pathway (SSP) 
4 (inequality), mainly due to higher food prices and declining health, 
with substantial income losses for the poorest 20% across 92 countries. 
Pretis et al. (2018) estimate negative impacts on economic growth 
in lower-income countries at 1.5°C warming, despite uncertainties. 
Impacts are likely to occur simultaneously across livelihood, food, 
human, water and ecosystem security (limited evidence, high 
agreement) (Byers et al., 2018), but the literature on interacting and 
cascading effects remains scarce (Hallegatte et al., 2014; O’Neill et 
al., 2017b; Reyer et al., 2017a, b).
Chapter 3 outlines future impacts and risks for ecosystems and 
human systems, many of which could also undermine sustainable 
development and efforts to eradicate poverty and hunger, and 
to protect health and ecosystems. Chapter 3 findings (see Section 
3.5.2.1) suggest increasing Reasons for Concern from moderate to 
high at a warming of 1.1° to 1.6°C, including for indigenous people 
and their livelihoods, and ecosystems in the Arctic (O’Neill et al., 
2017b). In 2050, based on the Hadley Centre Climate Prediction 
Model 3 (HadCM3) and the Special Report on Emission Scenarios A1b 
scenario (roughly comparable to 1.5°C warming), 450 million more 
flood-prone people would be exposed to doubling in flood frequency, 
and global flood risk would increase substantially (Arnell and 
Gosling, 2016). For droughts, poor people are expected to be more 
exposed (85% in population terms) in a warming scenario greater 
than 1.5°C for several countries in Asia and southern and western 
Africa (Winsemius et al., 2018). In urban Africa, a 1.5°C warming 
could expose many households to water poverty and increased 
flooding (Pelling et al., 2018). At 1.5ºC warming, fisheries-dependent 
and coastal livelihoods, of often disadvantaged populations, would 
suffer from the loss of coral reefs (see Chapter 3, Box 3.4).
Global heat stress is projected to increase in a 1.5°C warmer world, 
and by 2030, compared to 1961–1990, climate change could be 
responsible for additional annual deaths of 38,000 people from heat 
stress, particularly among the elderly, and 48,000 from diarrhoea, 
60,000 from malaria, and 95,000 from childhood undernutrition (WHO, 
2014). Each 1°C increase could reduce work productivity by 1 to 3% 
for people working outdoors or without air conditioning, typically the 
poorer segments of the workforce (Park et al., 2015).
The regional variation in the ‘warming experience at 1.5°C’ (see Chapter 
1, Section 1.3.1) is large (see Chapter 3, Section 3.3.2). Declines in crop 
yields are widely reported for Africa (60% of observations), with serious 
consequences for subsistence and rain-fed agriculture and food security 
(Savo et al., 2016). In Bangladesh, by 2050, damages and losses are 
expected for poor households dependent on freshwater fish stocks due 
to lack of mobility, limited access to land and strong reliance on local 
ecosystems (Dasgupta et al., 2017). Small Island Developing States 
(SIDS) are expected to experience challenging conditions at 1.5°C 
warming due to increased risk of internal migration and displacement 
and limits to adaptation (see Chapter 3, Box 3.5, Cross-Chapter Box 
12 in this chapter). An anticipated decline of marine fisheries of 
3 million metric tonnes per degree warming would have serious 
regional impacts for the Indo-Pacific region and the Arctic (Cheung et 
al., 2016).
5.2.2 
Avoided Impacts of 1.5°C versus 2°C 
Warming for Poverty and Inequality
Avoided impacts between 1.5°C and 2°C warming are expected to 
have significant positive implications for sustainable development, 
and reducing poverty and inequality. Using the SSPs (see Chapter 1, 
Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1, Section 5.5.2), Byers et al. (2018) 
model the number of people exposed to multi-sector climate risks 
and vulnerable to poverty (income < $10/day), comparing 2°C and 
1.5°C; the respective declines are from 86 million to 24 million for 
SSP1 (sustainability), from 498 million to 286 million for SSP2 (middle 
of the road), and from 1220 million to 763 million for SSP3 (regional 
rivalry), which suggests overall 62–457 million fewer people exposed 
and vulnerable at 1.5°C warming. Across the SSPs, the largest 
populations exposed and vulnerable are in South Asia (Byers et 
al., 2018). The avoided impacts on poverty at 1.5°C relative to 2°C 
are projected to depend at least as much or more on development 
scenarios than on warming (Wiebe et al., 2015; Hallegatte and 
Rozenberg, 2017).
Limiting warming to 1.5°C is expected to reduce the number of people 
exposed to hunger, water stress and disease in Africa (Clements, 
2009). It is also expected to limit the number of poor people exposed 
to floods and droughts at higher degrees of warming, especially in 
African and Asian countries (Winsemius et al., 2018). Challenges for 
poor populations – relating to food and water security, clean energy

453
access and environmental well-being – are projected to be less at 
1.5°C, particularly for vulnerable people in Africa and Asia (Byers et 
al., 2018). The overall projected socio-economic losses compared to the 
present day are less at 1.5°C (8% loss of gross domestic product per 
capita) compared to 2°C (13%), with lower-income countries projected 
to experience greater losses, which may increase economic inequality 
between countries (Pretis et al., 2018).
5.2.3 
Risks from 1.5°C versus 2°C Global Warming 
and the Sustainable Development Goals
The risks that can be avoided by limiting global warming to 1.5ºC rather 
than 2°C have many complex implications for sustainable development 
(ICSU, 2017; Gomez-Echeverri, 2018). There is high confidence that 
constraining warming to 1.5°C rather than 2°C would reduce risks 
for unique and threatened ecosystems, safeguarding the services they 
provide for livelihoods and sustainable development and making 
adaptation much easier (O’Neill et al., 2017b), particularly in Central 
America, the Amazon, South Africa and Australia (Schleussner et al., 
2016; O’Neill et al., 2017b; Reyer et al., 2017b; Bathiany et al., 2018).
In places that already bear disproportionate economic and social 
challenges to their sustainable development, people will face lower 
risks at 1.5°C compared to 2°C. These include North Africa and 
the Levant (less water scarcity), West Africa (less crop loss), South 
America and Southeast Asia (less intense heat), and many other 
coastal nations and island states (lower sea level rise, less coral reef 
loss) (Schleussner et al., 2016; Betts et al., 2018). The risks for food, 
water and ecosystems, particularly in subtropical regions such as 
Central America and countries such as South Africa and Australia, 
are expected to be lower at 1.5°C than at 2°C warming (Schleussner 
et al., 2016). Fewer people would be exposed to droughts and 
heat waves and the associated health impacts in countries such as 
Australia and India (King et al., 2017; Mishra et al., 2017). 
Limiting warming to 1.5°C would make it markedly easier to achieve 
the SDGs for poverty eradication, water access, safe cities, food 
security, healthy lives and inclusive economic growth, and would help 
to protect terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity (medium evidence, 
high agreement) (Table 5.2 available at the end of the chapter). For 
example, limiting species loss and expanding climate refugia will 
make it easier to achieve SDG 15 (see Chapter 3, Section 3.4.3). One 
indication of how lower temperatures benefit the SDGs is to compare 
the impacts of Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 (lower 
emissions) and RCP8.5 (higher emissions) on the SDGs (Ansuategi 
et al., 2015). A low emissions pathway allows for greater success in 
achieving SDGs for reducing poverty and hunger, providing access 
to clean energy, reducing inequality, ensuring education for all and 
making cities more sustainable. Even at lower emissions, a medium 
risk of failure exists to meet goals for water and sanitation, and marine 
and terrestrial ecosystems.
Action on climate change (SDG 13), including slowing the rate of 
warming, would help reach the goals for water, energy, food and 
land (SDGs 6, 7, 2 and 15) (Obersteiner et al., 2016; ICSU, 2017) 
and contribute to poverty eradication (SDG 1) (Byers et al., 2018). 
Although the literature that connects 1.5°C to the SDGs is limited, a 
pathway that stabilizes warming at 1.5°C by the end of the century is 
expected to increase the chances of achieving the SDGs by 2030, with 
greater potential to eradicate poverty, reduce inequality and foster 
equity (limited evidence, medium agreement). There are no studies 
on overshoot and dimensions of sustainable development, although 
literature on 4°C of warming suggests the impacts would be severe 
(Reyer et al., 2017b).

Introduction
Residual climate-related risks, limits to adaptation, and loss and damage (see Glossary) are increasingly assessed in the scientific 
literature (van der Geest and Warner, 2015; Boyd et al., 2017; Mechler et al., 2019). The AR5 (IPCC, 2013; Oppenheimer et al., 2014) 
documented impacts that have been detected and attributed to climate change, projected increasing climate-related risks with con-
tinued global warming, and recognized barriers and limits to adaptation. It recognized that adaptation is constrained by biophysi-
cal, institutional, financial, social and cultural factors, and that the interaction of these factors with climate change can lead to soft 
adaptation limits (adaptive actions currently not available) and hard adaptation limits (adaptive actions appear infeasible leading 
to unavoidable impacts) (Klein et al., 2014).
Loss and damage: concepts and perspectives
‘Loss and Damage’ (L&D) has been discussed in international climate negotiations for three decades (INC, 1991; Calliari, 2016; 
Vanhala and Hestbaek, 2016). A work programme on L&D was established as part of the Cancun Adaptation Framework in 2010 
supporting developing countries particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts (UNFCCC, 2011a). In 2013, the Conference of 
the Parties (COP) 19 established the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage (WIM) as a formal part of the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) architecture (UNFCCC, 2014). It acknowledges that L&D ‘includes, 
and in some cases involves more than, that which can be reduced by adaptation’ (UNFCCC, 2014). The Paris Agreement recognized 
‘the importance of averting, minimizing and addressing loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change’ 
through Article 8 (UNFCCC, 2015).
There is no one definition of L&D in climate policy, and analysis of policy documents and stakeholder views has demonstrated ambi-
guity (Vanhala and Hestbaek, 2016; Boyd et al., 2017). UNFCCC documents suggest that L&D is associated with adverse impacts 
of climate change on human and natural systems, including impacts from extreme events and slow-onset processes (UNFCCC, 
2011b, 2014, 2015). Some documents focus on impacts in developing or particularly vulnerable countries (UNFCCC, 2011b, 2014). 
They refer to economic (loss of assets and crops) and non-economic (biodiversity, culture, health) impacts, the latter also being an 
action area under the WIM workplan, and irreversible and permanent loss and damage. Lack of clarity of what the term addresses 
(avoidance through adaptation and mitigation, unavoidable losses, climate risk management, existential risk) was expressed among 
stakeholders, with further disagreement ensuing about what constitutes anthropogenic climate change versus natural climate vari-
ability (Boyd et al., 2017).
Limits to adaptation and residual risks
The AR5 described adaptation limits as points beyond which actors’ objectives are compromised by intolerable risks threatening key 
objectives such as good health or broad levels of well-being, thus requiring transformative adaptation for overcoming soft limits 
(see Chapter 4, Sections 4.2.2.3, 4.5.3 and Cross-Chapter Box 9, Section 5.3.1) (Dow et al., 2013; Klein et al., 2014). The AR5 WGII 
risk tables, based on expert judgment, depicted the potential for, and the limits of, additional adaptation to reduce risk. Near-term 
(2030–2040) risks can be used as a proxy for 1.5°C warming by the end of the century and compared to longer-term (2080–2100) 
risks associated with an approximate 2°C warming. Building on the AR5 risk approach, Cross-Chapter Box 12, Figure 1 provides a 
stylised application example to poverty and inequality.

Limits to adaptation, residual risks, and losses in a 1.5°C warmer world
The literature on risks at 1.5°C (versus 2°C and more) and potentials for adaptation remains limited, particularly for specific regions, 
sectors, and vulnerable and disadvantaged populations. Adaptation potential at 1.5°C and 2°C is rarely assessed explicitly, making 
an assessment of residual risk challenging. Substantial progress has been made since the AR5 to assess which climate change 
impacts on natural and human systems can be attributed to anthropogenic emissions (Hansen and Stone, 2016) and to examine 
the influence of anthropogenic emissions on extreme weather events (NASEM, 2016), and on consequent impacts on human life 
(Mitchell et al., 2016), but less so on monetary losses and risks (Schaller et al., 2016). There has also been some limited research to 
examine local-level limits to adaptation (Warner and Geest, 2013; Filho and Nalau, 2018). What constitutes losses and damages 
is context-dependent and often requires place-based research into what people value and consider worth protecting (Barnett et 
al., 2016; Tschakert et al., 2017). Yet assessments of non-material and intangible losses are particularly challenging, such as loss 
of sense of place, belonging, identity, and damage to emotional and mental well-being (Serdeczny et al., 2017; Wewerinke-Singh, 
2018a). Warming of 1.5°C is not considered ‘safe’ for most nations, communities, ecosystems and sectors, and poses significant risks 
to natural and human systems as compared to the current warming of 1°C (high confidence) (see Chapter 3, Section 3.4, Box 3.4, 
Box 3.5, Table 3.5, Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 3). Table 5.2, drawing on findings from Chapters 3, 4 and 5, presents examples 
of soft and hard limits in natural and human systems in the context of 1.5°C and 2°C of warming.
Cross-Chapter Box 12, Figure 1 |  Stylized reduced risk levels due to avoided impacts between 2°C and 1.5°C warming (in solid red-orange), additional 
avoided impacts with adaptation under 2°C (striped orange) and under 1.5°C (striped yellow), and unavoidable impacts (losses) with no or very limited 
potential for adaptation (grey), extracted from the AR5 WGII risk tables (Field et al., 2014), and underlying chapters by Adger et al. (2014) and Olsson et al. 
(2014). For some systems and sectors (A), achieving 1.5°C could reduce risks to low (with adaptation) from very high (without adaptation) and high (with 
adaptation) under 2°C. For other areas (C), no or very limited adaptation potential is anticipated, suggesting limits, with the same risks for 1.5°C and 2°C. 
Other risks are projected to be medium under 2°C with further potential for reduction, especially with adaptation, to very low levels (B).

Approaches and policy options to address residual risk and loss and damage 
Conceptual and applied work since the AR5 has highlighted the synergies and differences with adaptation and disaster risk reduction 
policies (van der Geest and Warner, 2015; Thomas and Benjamin, 2017), suggesting more integration of existing mechanisms, yet 
careful consideration is advised for slow-onset and potentially irreversible impacts and risk (Mechler and Schinko, 2016). Scholarship 
on justice and equity has provided insight on compensatory, distributive and procedural equity considerations for policy and practice 
to address loss and damage (Roser et al., 2015; Wallimann-Helmer, 2015; Huggel et al., 2016). A growing body of legal literature 
considers the role of litigation in preventing and addressing loss and damage and finds that litigation risks for governments and 
business are bound to increase with improved understanding of impacts and risks as climate science evolves (high confidence) 
(Mayer, 2016; Banda and Fulton, 2017; Marjanac and Patton, 2018; Wewerinke-Singh, 2018b). Policy proposals include international 
support for experienced losses and damages (Crosland et al., 2016; Page and Heyward, 2017), addressing climate displacement, 
donor-supported implementation of regional public insurance systems (Surminski et al., 2016) and new global governance systems 
under the UNFCCC (Biermann and Boas, 2017).

5.3 
Climate Adaptation and 
Sustainable Development
Adaptation will be extremely important in a 1.5°C warmer world 
since substantial impacts will be felt in every region (high confidence) 
(Chapter 3, Section 3.3), even if adaptation needs will be lower than 
in a 2°C warmer world (see Chapter 4, Sections 4.3.1 to 4.3.5, 4.5.3, 
Cross-Chapter Box 10 in Chapter 4). Climate adaptation options 
comprise structural, physical, institutional and social responses, with 
their effectiveness depending largely on governance (see Glossary), 
political will, adaptive capacities and availability of finance (see 
Chapter 4, Sections 4.4.1 to 4.4.5) (Betzold and Weiler, 2017; Sonwa 
et al., 2017; Sovacool et al., 2017). Even though the literature is scarce 
on the expected impacts of future adaptation measures on sustainable 
development specific to warming experiences of 1.5°C, this section 
assesses available literature on how (i) prioritising sustainable 
development enhances or impedes climate adaptation efforts 
(Section 5.3.1); (ii) climate adaptation measures impact sustainable 
development and the SDGs in positive (synergies) or negative (trade-
offs) ways (Section 5.3.2); and (iii) adaptation pathways towards a 1.5°C 
warmer world affect sustainable development, poverty and inequalities 
(Section 5.3.3). The section builds on Chapter 4 (see Section 4.3.5) 
regarding available adaptation options to reduce climate vulnerability 
and build resilience (see Glossary) in the context of 1.5°C-compatible 
trajectories, with emphasis on sustainable development implications.
5.3.1 
Sustainable Development in Support 
of Climate Adaptation
Making sustainable development a priority, and meeting the SDGs, 
is consistent with efforts to adapt to climate change (very high 
confidence). Sustainable development is effective in building adaptive 
capacity if it addresses poverty and inequalities, social and economic 
exclusion, and inadequate institutional capacities (Noble et al., 2014; 
Abel et al., 2016; Colloff et al., 2017). Four ways in which sustainable 
development leads to effective adaptation are described below. 
First, sustainable development enables transformational adaptation 
(see Chapter 4, Section 4.2.2.2) when an integrated approach is 
adopted, with inclusive, transparent decision-making, rather than 
addressing current vulnerabilities as stand-alone climate problems 
(Mathur et al., 2014; Arthurson and Baum, 2015; Shackleton et al., 
2015; Lemos et al., 2016; Antwi-Agyei et al., 2017b). Ending poverty 
in its multiple dimensions (SDG 1) is often a highly effective form of 
climate adaptation (Fankhauser and McDermott, 2014; Leichenko 
and Silva, 2014; Hallegatte and Rozenberg, 2017). However, ending 
poverty is not sufficient, and the positive outcome as an adaptation 
strategy depends on whether increased household wealth is actually 
directed towards risk reduction and management strategies (Nelson 
et al., 2016), as shown in urban municipalities (Colenbrander et al., 
2017; Rasch, 2017) and agrarian communities (Hashemi et al., 2017), 
and whether finance for adaptation is made available (Section 5.6.1).
Second, local participation is effective when wider socio-economic 
barriers are addressed via multiscale planning (McCubbin et al., 
2015; Nyantakyi-Frimpong and Bezner-Kerr, 2015; Toole et al., 2016). 
This is the case, for instance, when national education efforts (SDG 4) 
(Muttarak and Lutz, 2014; Striessnig and Loichinger, 2015) and 
indigenous knowledge (Nkomwa et al., 2014; Pandey and Kumar, 2018) 
enhance information sharing, which also builds resilience (Santos et al., 
2016; Martinez-Baron et al., 2018) and reduces risks for maladaptation 
(Antwi-Agyei et al., 2018; Gajjar et al., 2018).
Third, development promotes transformational adaptation when 
addressing social inequalities (Section 5.5.3, 5.6.4), as in SDGs 
4, 5, 16 and 17 (O’Brien, 2016; O’Brien, 2017). For example, SDG 5 
supports measures that reduce women’s vulnerabilities and allow 
women to benefit from adaptation (Antwi-Agyei et al., 2015; Van Aelst 
and Holvoet, 2016; Cohen, 2017). Mobilization of climate finance, 
carbon taxation and environmentally motivated subsidies can reduce 
inequalities (SDG 10), advance climate mitigation and adaptation 
(Chancel and Picketty, 2015), and be conducive to strengthening and 
enabling environments for resilience building (Nhamo, 2016; Halonen 
et al., 2017).
Fourth, when sustainable development promotes livelihood security, 
it enhances the adaptive capacities of vulnerable communities and 
households. Examples include SDG 11 supporting adaptation in cities 
Sustainable Development, Poverty Eradication and Reducing Inequalities 
Chapter 5

to reduce harm from disasters (Kelman, 2017; Parnell, 2017); access to 
water and sanitation (SDG 6) with strong institutions (SDG 16) (Rasul 
and Sharma, 2016); SDG 2 and its targets that promote adaptation 
in agricultural and food systems (Lipper et al., 2014); and targets for 
SDG 3 such as reducing infectious diseases and providing health cover 
are consistent with health-related adaptation (ICSU, 2017; Gomez-
Echeverri, 2018).
Sustainable development has the potential to significantly reduce 
systemic vulnerability, enhance adaptive capacity and promote 
livelihood security for poor and disadvantaged populations (high 
confidence). Transformational adaptation (see Chapter 4, Sections 
4.2.2.2 and 4.5.3) would require development that takes into 
consideration multidimensional poverty and entrenched inequalities, 
local cultural specificities and local knowledge in decision-making, 
thereby making it easier to achieve the SDGs in a 1.5°C warmer world 
(medium evidence, high agreement).
5.3.2 
Synergies and Trade-Offs between Adaptation 
Options and Sustainable Development
There are short-, medium-, and long-term positive impacts (synergies) 
and negative impacts (trade-offs) between the dual goals of keeping 
temperatures below 1.5°C global warming and achieving sustainable 
development. The extent of synergies between development and 
adaptation goals will vary by the development process adopted for a 
particular SDG and underlying vulnerability contexts (medium evidence, 
high agreement). Overall, the impacts of adaptation on sustainable 
development, poverty eradication and reducing inequalities in general, 
and the SDGs specifically, are expected to be largely positive, given 
that the inherent purpose of adaptation is to lower risks. Building on 
Chapter 4 (see Section 4.3.5), this section examines synergies and 
trade-offs between adaptation and sustainable development for some 
key sectors and approaches.
Agricultural adaptation: The most direct synergy is between SDG 2 
(zero hunger) and adaptation in cropping, livestock and food systems, 
designed to maintain or increase production (Lipper et al., 2014; 
Rockström et al., 2017). Farmers with effective adaptation strategies 
tend to enjoy higher food security and experience lower levels of 
poverty (FAO, 2015; Douxchamps et al., 2016; Ali and Erenstein, 2017). 
Vermeulen et al. (2016) report strong positive returns on investment 
across the world from agricultural adaptation with side benefits for 
environment and economic well-being. Well-adapted agricultural 
systems contribute to safe drinking water, health, biodiversity and 
equity goals (DeClerck et al., 2016; Myers et al., 2017). Climate-smart 
agriculture has synergies with food security, though it can be biased 
towards technological solutions, may not be gender sensitive, and can 
create specific challenges for institutional and distributional aspects 
(Lipper et al., 2014; Arakelyan et al., 2017; Taylor, 2017).
At the same time, adaptation options increase risks for human 
health, oceans and access to water if fertiliser and pesticides are used 
without regulation or when irrigation reduces water availability for 
other purposes (Shackleton et al., 2015; Campbell et al., 2016). When 
agricultural insurance and climate services overlook the poor, inequality 
may rise (Dinku et al., 2014; Carr and Owusu-Daaku, 2015; Georgeson 
et al., 2017a; Carr and Onzere, 2018). Agricultural adaptation measures 
may increase workloads, especially for women, while changes in crop 
mix can result in loss of income or culturally inappropriate food (Carr 
and Thompson, 2014; Thompson-Hall et al., 2016; Bryan et al., 2017), 
and they may benefit farmers with more land to the detriment of land-
poor farmers, as seen in the Mekong River Basin (see Chapter 3, Cross-
Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 3).
Adaptation to protect human health: Adaptation options in the health 
sector are expected to reduce morbidity and mortality (Arbuthnott 
et al., 2016; Ebi and Otmani del Barrio, 2017). Heat-early-warning 
systems help lower injuries, illnesses and deaths (Hess and Ebi, 2016), 
with positive impacts for SDG 3. Institutions better equipped to 
share information, indicators for detecting climate-sensitive diseases, 
improved provision of basic health care services and coordination 
with other sectors also improve risk management, thus reducing 
adverse health outcomes (Dasgupta et al., 2016; Dovie et al., 2017). 
Effective adaptation creates synergies via basic public health measures 
(K.R. Smith et al., 2014; Dasgupta, 2016) and health infrastructure 
protected from extreme weather events (Watts et al., 2015). Yet trade-
offs can occur when adaptation in one sector leads to negative impacts 
in another sector. Examples include the creation of urban wetlands 
through flood control measures which can breed mosquitoes, and 
migration eroding physical and mental well-being, hence adversely 
affecting SDG 3 (K.R. Smith et al., 2014; Watts et al., 2015). Similarly, 
increased use of air conditioning enhances resilience to heat stress 
(Petkova et al., 2017), yet it can result in higher energy consumption, 
undermining SDG 13.
Coastal adaptation: Adaptation to sea level rise remains essential 
in coastal areas even under a climate stabilization scenario of 1.5°C 
(Nicholls et al., 2018). Coastal adaptation to restore ecosystems (for 
instance by planting mangrove forests) supports SDGs for enhancing 
life and livelihoods on land and oceans (see Chapter 4, Sections 
4.3.2.3). Synergistic outcomes between development and relocation 
of coastal communities are enhanced by participatory decision-making 
and settlement designs that promote equity and sustainability (van der 
Voorn et al., 2017). Limits to coastal adaptation may rise, for instance 
in low-lying islands in the Pacific, Caribbean and Indian Ocean, with 
attendant implications for loss and damage (see Chapter 3 Box 3.5, 
Chapter 4, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 4, Cross-Chapter Box 12 in 
Chapter 5, Box 5.3).
Migration as adaptation: Migration has been used in various contexts 
to protect livelihoods from challenges related to climate change 
(Marsh, 2015; Jha et al., 2017), including through remittances (Betzold 
and Weiler, 2017). Synergies between migration and the achievement 
of sustainable development depend on adaptive measures and 
conditions in both sending and receiving regions (Fatima et al., 2014; 
McNamara, 2015; Entzinger and Scholten, 2016; Ober and Sakdapolrak, 
2017; Schwan and Yu, 2017). Adverse developmental impacts arise 
when vulnerable women or the elderly are left behind or if migration 
is culturally disruptive (Wilkinson et al., 2016; Albert et al., 2017; Islam 
and Shamsuddoha, 2017).
Ecosystem-based adaptation: Ecosystem-based adaptation (EBA) can 
offer synergies with sustainable development (Morita and Matsumoto, 
Chapter 5 
Sustainable Development, Poverty Eradication and Reducing Inequalities
5
458
2015; Ojea, 2015; Szabo et al., 2015; Brink et al., 2016; Butt et al., 
2016; Conservation International, 2016; Huq et al., 2017), although 
assessments remain difficult (see Chapter 4, Section 4.3.2.2) (Doswald 
et al., 2014). Examples include mangrove restoration reducing 
coastal vulnerability, protecting marine and terrestrial ecosystems, 
and increasing local food security, as well as watershed management 
reducing flood risks and improving water quality (Chong, 2014). 
In drylands, EBA practices, combined with community-based 
adaptation, have shown how to link adaptation with mitigation to 
improve livelihood conditions of poor farmers (Box 5.1). Synergistic 
developmental outcomes arise where EBA is cost effective, inclusive 
of indigenous and local knowledge and easily accessible by the poor 
(Ojea, 2015; Daigneault et al., 2016; Estrella et al., 2016). Payment for 
ecosystem services can provide incentives to land owners and natural 
resource managers to preserve environmental services with synergies 
with SDGs 1 and 13 (Arriagada et al., 2015), when implementation 
challenges are overcome (Calvet-Mir et al., 2015; Wegner, 2016; Chan 
et al., 2017). Trade-offs include loss of other economic land use types, 
tension between biodiversity and adaptation priorities, and conflicts 
over governance (Wamsler et al., 2014; Ojea, 2015).
Community-based adaptation: Community-based adaptation (CBA) 
(see Chapter 4, Sections 4.3.3.2) enhances resilience and sustainability 
of adaptation plans (Ford et al., 2016; Fernandes-Jesus et al., 2017; 
Grantham and Rudd, 2017; Gustafson et al., 2017). Yet negative 
impacts occur if it fails to fairly represent vulnerable populations 
and to foster long-term social resilience (Ensor, 2016; Taylor Aiken 
et al., 2017). Mainstreaming CBA into planning and decision-making 
enables the attainment of SDGs 5, 10 and 16 (Archer et al., 2014; 
Reid and Huq, 2014; Vardakoulias and Nicholles, 2014; Cutter, 2016; 
Kim et al., 2017). Incorporating multiple forms of indigenous and 
local knowledge is an important element of CBA, as shown for 
instance in the Arctic region (see Chapter 4, Section 4.3.5.5, Box 4.3, 
Cross-Chapter Box 9) (Apgar et al., 2015; Armitage, 2015; Pearce 
et al., 2015; Chief et al., 2016; Cobbinah and Anane, 2016; Ford et 
al., 2016). Indigenous and local knowledge can be synergistic with 
achieving SDGs 2, 6 and 10 (Ayers et al., 2014; Lasage et al., 2015; 
Regmi and Star, 2015; Berner et al., 2016; Chief et al., 2016; Murtinho, 
2016; Reid, 2016).
There are clear synergies between adaptation options and several 
SDGs, such as poverty eradication, elimination of hunger, clean water 
and health (robust evidence, high agreement), as well-integrated 
adaptation supports sustainable development (Eakin et al., 2014; 
Weisser et al., 2014; Adam, 2015; Smucker et al., 2015). Substantial 
synergies are observed in the agricultural and health sectors, and 
in ecosystem-based adaptations. However, particular adaptation 
strategies can lead to adverse consequences for developmental 
outcomes (medium evidence, high agreement). Adaptation strategies 
that advance one SDG can result in trade-offs with other SDGs; for 
instance, agricultural adaptation to enhance food security (SDG 2) 
causing negative impacts for health, equality and healthy ecosystems 
(SDGs 3, 5, 6, 10, 14 and 15), and resilience to heat stress increasing 
energy consumption (SDGs 3 and 7) and high-cost adaptation 
in resource-constrained contexts (medium evidence, medium 
agreement).
5.3.3 
Adaptation Pathways towards a 1.5°C Warmer 
World and Implications for Inequalities
In a 1.5°C warmer world, adaptation measures and options would 
need to be intensified, accelerated and scaled up. This entails not only 
the right ‘mix’ of options (asking ‘right for whom and for what?’) but 
also a forward-looking understanding of dynamic trajectories, that is 
adaptation pathways (see Chapter 1, Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 
1), best understood as decision-making processes over sets of potential 
action sequenced over time (Câmpeanu and Fazey, 2014; Wise et al., 
2014). Given the scarcity of literature on adaptation pathways that 
navigate place-specific warming experiences at 1.5°C, this section 
presents insights into current local decision-making for adaptation 
futures. This grounded evidence shows that choices between possible 
pathways, at different scales and for different groups of people, are 
shaped by uneven power structures and historical legacies that create 
their own, often unforeseen change (Fazey et al., 2016; Bosomworth 
et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2017; Murphy et al., 2017; Pelling et al., 2018). 
Pursuing a place-specific adaptation pathway approach towards a 
1.5°C warmer world harbours the potential for significant positive 
outcomes, with synergies for well-being possibilities to ‘leap-frog the 
SDGs’ (J.R.A. Butler et al., 2016), in countries at all levels of development 
(medium evidence, high agreement). It allows for identifying local, 
socially salient tipping points before they are crossed, based on what 
people value and trade-offs that are acceptable to them (Barnett et al., 
2014, 2016; Gorddard et al., 2016; Tschakert et al., 2017). Yet evidence 
also reveals adverse impacts that reinforce rather than reduce existing 
social inequalities and hence may lead to poverty traps (medium 
evidence, high agreement) (Nagoda, 2015; Warner et al., 2015; Barnett 
et al., 2016; J.R.A. Butler et al., 2016; Godfrey-Wood and Naess, 2016; 
Pelling et al., 2016; Albert et al., 2017; Murphy et al., 2017).
Past development trajectories as well as transformational adaptation 
plans can constrain adaptation futures by reinforcing dominant 
political-economic structures and processes, and narrowing option 
spaces; this leads to maladaptive pathways that preclude alternative, 
locally relevant and sustainable development initiatives and increase 
vulnerabilities (Warner and Kuzdas, 2017; Gajjar et al., 2018). Such 
dominant pathways tend to validate the practices, visions and 
values of existing governance regimes and powerful members of a 
community while devaluing those of less privileged stakeholders. 
Examples from Romania, the Solomon Islands and Australia illustrate 
such pathway dynamics in which individual economic gains and 
prosperity matter more than community cohesion and solidarity; this 
discourages innovation, exacerbates inequalities and further erodes 
adaptive capacities of the most vulnerable (Davies et al., 2014; Fazey 
et al., 2016; Bosomworth et al., 2017). In the city of London, United 
Kingdom, the dominant adaptation and disaster risk management 
pathway promotes resilience that emphasizes self-reliance; yet it 
intensifies the burden on low-income citizens, the elderly, migrants 
and others unable to afford flood insurance or protect themselves 
against heat waves (Pelling et al., 2016). Adaptation pathways in the 
Bolivian Altiplano have transformed subsistence farmers into world-
leading quinoa producers, but loss of social cohesion and traditional 
values, dispossession and loss of ecosystem services now constitute 
undesirable trade-offs (Chelleri et al., 2016).

A narrow view of adaptation decision-making, for example focused on 
technical solutions, tends to crowd out more participatory processes 
(Lawrence and Haasnoot, 2017; Lin et al., 2017), obscures contested 
values and reinforces power asymmetries (Bosomworth et al., 2017; 
Singh, 2018). A situated and context-specific understanding of 
adaptation pathways that galvanizes diverse knowledge, values and 
joint initiatives helps to overcome dominant path dependencies, avoid 
trade-offs that intensify inequities and challenge policies detached 
from place (Fincher et al., 2014; Wyborn et al., 2015; Murphy et al., 
2017; Gajjar et al., 2018). These insights suggest that adaptation 
pathway approaches to prepare for 1.5°C warmer futures would be 
difficult to achieve without considerations for inclusiveness, place-
specific trade-off deliberations, redistributive measures and procedural 
justice mechanisms to facilitate equitable transformation (medium 
evidence, high agreement).
Box 5.1 |  Ecosystem- and Community-Based Practices in Drylands
Drylands face severe challenges in building climate resilience (Fuller and Lain, 2017), yet small-scale farmers can play a crucial 
role as agents of change through ecosystem- and community-based practices that combine adaptation, mitigation and sustainable 
development.
Farmer managed natural regeneration (FMNR) of trees in cropland is practised in 18 countries across sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast 
Asia, Timor-Leste, India and Haiti and has, for example, permitted the restoration of over five million hectares of land in the Sahel 
(Niang et al., 2014; Bado et al., 2016). In Ethiopia, the Managing Environmental Resources to Enable Transitions programme, 
which entails community-based watershed rehabilitation in rural landscapes, supported around 648,000 people, resulting in 
the rehabilitation of 25,400,000 hectares of land in 72 severely food-insecure districts across Ethiopia between 2012 and 2015 
(Gebrehaweria et al., 2016). In India, local farmers have benefitted from watershed programmes across different agro-ecological 
regions (Singh et al., 2014; Datta, 2015).
These low-cost, flexible community-based practices represent low-regrets adaptation and mitigation strategies. These strategies 
often contribute to strengthened ecosystem resilience and biodiversity, increased agricultural productivity and food security, 
reduced household poverty and drudgery for women, and enhanced agency and social capital (Niang et al., 2014; Francis et al., 
2015; Kassie et al., 2015; Mbow et al., 2015; Reij and Winterbottom, 2015; Weston et al., 2015; Bado et al., 2016; Dumont et al., 
2017). Small check dams in dryland areas and conservation agriculture can significantly increase agricultural output (Kumar et al., 
2014; Agoramoorthy and Hsu, 2016; Pradhan et al., 2018). Mitigation benefits have also been quantified (Weston et al., 2015); for 
example, FMNR of more than five million hectares in Niger has sequestered 25–30 Mtonnes of carbon over 30 years (Stevens et 
al., 2014).
However, several constraints hinder scaling-up efforts: inadequate attention to the socio-technical processes of innovation (Grist 
et al., 2017; Scoones et al., 2017), difficulties in measuring the benefits of an innovation (Coe et al., 2017), farmers’ inability to 
deal with long-term climate risk (Singh et al., 2017), and difficulties for matching practices with agro-ecological conditions and 
complementary modern inputs (Kassie et al., 2015). Key conditions to overcome these challenges include: developing agroforestry 
value chains and markets (Reij and Winterbottom, 2015) and adaptive planning and management (Gray et al., 2016). Others include 
inclusive processes giving greater voice to women and marginalized groups (MRFCJ, 2015a; UN Women and MRFCJ, 2016; Dumont 
et al., 2017), strengthening community land and forest rights (Stevens et al., 2014; Vermeulen et al., 2016), and co-learning among 
communities of practice at different scales (Coe et al., 2014; Reij and Winterbottom, 2015; Sinclair, 2016; Binam et al., 2017; Dumont 
et al., 2017; Epule et al., 2017). 
5.4 
Mitigation and Sustainable Development
The AR5 WGIII examined the potential of various mitigation options 
for specific sectors (energy supply, industry, buildings, transport, and 
agriculture, forestry, and other land use; AFOLU); it provided a narrative 
of dimensions of sustainable development and equity as a framing for 
evaluating climate responses and policies, respectively, in Chapters 4, 
7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 (IPCC, 2014a). This section builds on the analyses of 
Chapters 2 and 4 of this report to re-assess mitigation and sustainable 
development in the context of 1.5°C global warming as well as the 
SDGs.
5.4.1 
Synergies and Trade-Offs between Mitigation 
Options and Sustainable Development
Adopting stringent climate mitigation options can generate multiple 
positive non-climate benefits that have the potential to reduce the 
costs of achieving sustainable development (IPCC, 2014b; Ürge-
Vorsatz et al., 2014, 2016; Schaeffer et al., 2015; von Stechow et al., 
2015). Understanding the positive impacts (synergies) but also the 
negative impacts (trade-offs) is key for selecting mitigation options 
and policy choices that maximize the synergies between mitigation 
and developmental actions (Hildingsson and Johansson, 2015; Nilsson 
Chapter 5 
Sustainable Development, Poverty Eradication and Reducing Inequalities
5
460
et al., 2016; Delponte et al., 2017; van Vuuren et al., 2017b; McCollum 
et al., 2018b). Aligning mitigation response options to sustainable 
development objectives can ensure public acceptance (IPCC, 2014a), 
encourage faster action (Lechtenboehmer and Knoop, 2017) and 
support the design of equitable mitigation (Holz et al., 2018; Winkler 
et al., 2018) that protect human rights (MRFCJ, 2015b) (Section 5.5.3).
This sub-section assesses available literature on the interactions of 
individual mitigation options (see Chapter 2, Section 2.3.1.2, Chapter 
4, Sections 4.2 and 4.3) with sustainable development and the SDGs 
and underlying targets. Table 5.2 presents an assessment of these 
synergies and trade-offs and the strength of the interaction using an 
SDG-interaction score (see Glossary) (McCollum et al., 2018b), with 
evidence and agreements levels. Figure 5.2 presents the information 
of Table 5.2, showing gross (not net) interactions with the SDGs. This 
detailed assessment of synergies and trade-offs of individual mitigation 
options with the SDGs (Table 5.2 a–d and Figure 5.2) reveals that the 
number of synergies exceeds that of trade-offs. Mitigation response 
options in the energy demand sector, AFOLU and oceans have more 
positive interactions with a larger number of SDGs compared to those 
on the energy supply side (robust evidence, high agreement).
5.4.1.1 Energy Demand: Mitigation Options to Accelerate 
Reduction in Energy Use and Fuel Switch
For mitigation options in the energy demand sectors, the number 
of synergies with all sixteen SDGs exceeds the number of trade-offs 
(Figure 5.2 and Table 5.2) (robust evidence, high agreement). Most 
of the interactions are of a reinforcing nature, hence facilitating the 
achievement of the goals.
Accelerating energy efficiency in all sectors, which is a necessary 
condition for a 1.5°C warmer world (see Chapters 2 and 4), has 
synergies with a large number of SDGs (robust evidence, high 
agreement) (Figure 5.2 and Table 5.2). The diffusion of efficient 
equipment and appliances across end use sectors has synergies with 
international partnership (SDG 17) and participatory and transparent 
institutions (SDG 16) because innovations and deployment of new 
technologies require transnational capacity building and knowledge 
sharing. Resource and energy savings support sustainable production 
and consumption (SDG 12), energy access (SDG 7), innovation and 
infrastructure development (SDG 9) and sustainable city development 
(SDG 11). Energy efficiency supports the creation of decent jobs by new 
service companies providing services for energy efficiency, but the net 
employment effect of efficiency improvement remains uncertain due to 
macro-economic feedback (SDG 8) (McCollum et al., 2018b).
In the buildings sector, accelerating energy efficiency by way of, 
for example, enhancing the use of efficient appliances, refrigerant 
transition, insulation, retrofitting and low- or zero-energy buildings 
generates benefits across multiple SDG targets. For example, 
improved cook stoves make fuel endowments last longer and 
hence reduce deforestation (SDG 15), support equal opportunity by 
reducing school absences due to asthma among children (SDGs 3 
and 4) and empower rural and indigenous women by reducing drudgery 
(SDG 5) (robust evidence, high agreement) (Derbez et al., 2014; Lucon 
et al., 2014; Maidment et al., 2014; Scott et al., 2014; Cameron et al., 
2015; Fay et al., 2015; Liddell and Guiney, 2015; Shah et al., 2015; 
Sharpe et al., 2015; Wells et al., 2015; Willand et al., 2015; Hallegatte 
et al., 2016; Kusumaningtyas and Aldrian, 2016; Berrueta et al., 2017; 
McCollum et al., 2018a).
In energy-intensive processing industries, 1.5ºC-compatible trajectories 
require radical technology innovation through maximum electrification, 
shift to other low emissions energy carriers such as hydrogen or 
biomass, integration of carbon capture and storage (CCS) and 
innovations for carbon capture and utilization (CCU) (see Chapter 4, 
Section 4.3.4.5). These transformations have strong synergies with 
innovation and sustainable industrialization (SDG 9), supranational 
partnerships (SDGs 16 and 17) and sustainable production (SDG 12). 
However, possible trade-offs due to risks of CCS-based carbon 
leakage, increased electricity demands, and associated price impacts 
affecting energy access and poverty (SDGs 7 and 1) would need careful 
regulatory attention (Wesseling et al., 2017). In the mining industry, 
energy efficiency can be synergetic or face trade-offs with sustainable 
management (SDG 6), depending on the option retained for water 
management (Nguyen et al., 2014). Substitution and recycling are 
also an important driver of 1.5ºC-compatible trajectories in industrial 
systems (see Chapter 4, Section 4.3.4.2). Structural changes and 
reorganization of economic activities in industrial park/clusters 
following the principles of industrial symbiosis (circular economy) 
improves the overall sustainability by reducing energy and waste 
(Fan et al., 2017; Preston and Lehne, 2017) and reinforces responsible 
production and consumption (SDG 12) through recycling, water use 
efficiency (SDG 6), energy access (SDG 7) and ecosystem protection 
and restoration (SDG 15) (Karner et al., 2015; Zeng et al., 2017).
In the transport sector, deep electrification may trigger increases of 
electricity prices and adversely affect poor populations (SDG 1), unless 
pro-poor redistributive policies are in place (Klausbruckner et al., 2016). In 
cities, governments can lay the foundations for compact, connected low-
carbon cities, which are an important component of 1.5ºC-compatible 
transformations (see Chapter 4, Section 4.3.3) and show synergies with 
sustainable cities (SDG 11) (Colenbrander et al., 2016).
Behavioural responses are important determinants of the ultimate 
outcome of energy efficiency on emission reductions and energy access 
(SDG 7) and their management requires a detailed understanding 
of the drivers of consumption and the potential for and barriers to 
absolute reductions (Fuchs et al., 2016). Notably, the rebound effect 
tends to offset the benefits of efficiency for emissions reductions 
through growing demand for energy services (Sorrell, 2015; Suffolk and 
Poortinga, 2016). However, high rebound can help in providing faster 
access to affordable energy (SDG 7.1) where the goal is to reduce energy 
poverty and unmet energy demand (see Chapter 2, Section 2.4.3) 
(Chakravarty et al., 2013). Comprehensive policy design – including 
rebound supressing policies, such as carbon pricing and policies that 
encourage awareness building and promotional material design – is 
needed to tap the full potential of energy savings, as applicable to a 
1.5°C warming context (Chakravarty and Tavoni, 2013; IPCC, 2014b; 
Karner et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015; Altieri et al., 2016; Santarius 
et al., 2016) and to address policy-related trade-offs and welfare-

al., 2013; Chakravarty and Roy, 2016; Gillingham et al., 2016).

Other behavioural responses will affect the interplay between energy 
efficiency and sustainable development. Building occupants reluctant 
to change their habits may miss out on welfare-enhancing energy 
efficiency opportunities (Zhao et al., 2017). Preferences for new 
products and premature obsolescence for appliances is expected to 
adversely affect sustainable consumption and production (SDG 12) with 
ramifications for resource use efficiency (Echegaray, 2016). Changes 
in user behaviour towards increased physical activity, less reliance on 
motorized travel over short distances and the use of public transport 
would help to decarbonize the transport sector in a synergetic manner 
with SDGs 3, 11 and 12 (Shaw et al., 2014; Ajanovic, 2015; Chakrabarti 
and Shin, 2017), while reducing inequality in access to basic facilities 
(SDG 10) (Lucas and Pangbourne, 2014; Kagawa et al., 2015). However, 
infrastructure design and regulations would need to ensure road safety 
and address risks of road accidents for pedestrians (Hwang et al., 
2017; Khreis et al., 2017) to ensure sustainable infrastructure growth 
in human settlements (SDGs 9 and 11) (Lin et al., 2015; SLoCaT, 2017).
5.4.1.2 Energy Supply: Accelerated Decarbonization 
Decreasing the share of coal in energy supply in line with 1.5ºC-compatible 
scenarios (see Chapter 2, Section 2.4.2) reduces adverse impacts of 
upstream supply-chain activities, in particular air and water pollution and 
coal mining accidents, and enhances health by reducing air pollution, 
notably in cities, showing synergies with SDGs 3, 11 and 12 (Yang et al., 
2016; UNEP, 2017).
Fast deployment of renewables such as solar, wind, hydro and modern 
biomass, together with the decrease of fossil fuels in energy supply (see 
Chapter 2, Section 2.4.2.1), is aligned with the doubling of renewables 
in the global energy mix (SDG 7.2). Renewables could also support 
progress on SDGs 1, 10, 11 and 12 and supplement new technology 
(robust evidence, high agreement) (Chaturvedi and Shukla, 2014; Rose 
et al., 2014; Smith and Sagar, 2014; Riahi et al., 2015; IEA, 2016; van 
Vuuren et al., 2017a; McCollum et al., 2018a). However, some trade-
offs with the SDGs can emerge from offshore installations, particularly 
SDG 14 in local contexts (McCollum et al., 2018a). Moreover, trade-
offs between renewable energy production and affordability (SDG 7) 
(Labordena et al., 2017) and other environmental objectives would 
need to be scrutinised for potential negative social outcomes. Policy 
interventions through regional cooperation-building (SDG 17) and 
institutional capacity (SDG 16) can enhance affordability (SDG 7) 
(Labordena et al., 2017). The deployment of small-scale renewables, or 
off-grid solutions for people in remote areas (Sánchez and Izzo, 2017), 
has strong potential for synergies with access to energy (SDG 7), but 
the actualization of these potentials requires measures to overcome 
technology and reliability risks associated with large-scale deployment 
of renewables (Giwa et al., 2017; Heard et al., 2017). Bundling energy-
efficient appliances and lighting with off-grid renewables can lead 
to substantial cost reduction while increasing reliability (IEA, 2017). 
Low-income populations in industrialized countries are often left out of 
renewable energy generation schemes, either because of high start-up 
costs or lack of home ownership (UNRISD, 2016).
Nuclear energy, the share of which increases in most of the 
1.5ºC-compatible pathways (see Chapter 2, Section 2.4.2.1), can increase 
the risks of proliferation (SDG 16), have negative environmental effects 
(e.g., for water use; SDG 6) and have mixed effects for human health 
when replacing fossil fuels (SDGs 7 and 3) (see Table 5.2). The use of 
fossil CCS, which plays an important role in deep mitigation pathways 
(see Chapter 2, Section 2.4.2.3), implies continued adverse impacts 
of upstream supply-chain activities in the coal sector, and because of 
lower efficiency of CCS coal power plants (SDG 12), upstream impacts 
and local air pollution are likely to be exacerbated (SDG 3). Furthermore, 
there is a non-negligible risk of carbon dioxide leakage from geological 
storage and the carbon dioxide transport infrastructure (SDG 3) 
(Table 5.2).
Economies dependent upon fossil fuel-based energy generation and/or 
export revenue are expected to be disproportionally affected by future 
restrictions on the use of fossil fuels under stringent climate goals and 
higher carbon prices; this includes impacts on employment, stranded 
assets, resources left underground, lower capacity use and early phasing 
out of large infrastructure already under construction (robust evidence, 
high agreement) (Box 5.2) (Johnson et al., 2015; McGlade and Ekins, 
2015; UNEP, 2017; Spencer et al., 2018). Investment in coal continues 
to be attractive in many countries as it is a mature technology and 
provides cheap energy supplies, large-scale employment and energy 
security (Jakob and Steckel, 2016; Vogt-Schilb and Hallegatte, 2017; 
Spencer et al., 2018). Hence, accompanying policies and measures 
would be required to ease job losses and correct for relatively higher 
prices of alternative energy (Oosterhuis and Ten Brink, 2014; Oei and 
Mendelevitch, 2016; Garg et al., 2017; HLCCP, 2017; Jordaan et al., 
2017; OECD, 2017; UNEP, 2017; Blondeel and van de Graaf, 2018; 
Green, 2018). Research on historical transitions shows that managing 
the impacts on workers through retraining programmes is essential 
in order to align the phase-down of mining industries with meeting 
ambitious climate targets, and the objectives of a ‘just transition’ 
(Galgóczi, 2014; Caldecott et al., 2017; Healy and Barry, 2017). This 
aspect is even more important in developing countries where the 
mining workforce is largely semi- or unskilled (Altieri et al., 2016; Tung, 
2016). Ambitious emissions reduction targets can unlock very strong 
decoupling potentials in industrialized fossil exporting economies 
(Hatfield-Dodds et al., 2015).

Box 5.2 |  Challenges and Opportunities of Low-Carbon Pathways in Gulf Cooperative Council Countries
The Gulf Cooperative Council (GCC) region (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates) is characterized 
by high dependency on hydrocarbon resources (natural oil and gas), with high risks of socio-economic impacts of policies and 
response measures to address climate change. The region is also vulnerable to the decrease of the global demand and price of 
hydrocarbons as a result of climate change response measures. The projected declining use of oil and gas under low emissions 
pathways creates risks of significant economic losses for the GCC region (e.g., Waisman et al., 2013; Van de Graaf and Verbruggen, 
2015; Al-Maamary et al., 2016; Bauer et al., 2016), given that natural gas and oil revenues contributed to about 70% of government 
budgets and > 35% of the gross domestic product in 2010 (Callen et al., 2014).
The current high energy intensity of the domestic economies (Al-Maamary et al., 2017), triggered mainly by low domestic energy 
prices (Alshehry and Belloumi, 2015), suggests specific challenges for aligning mitigation towards 1.5°C-consistent trajectories, 
which would require strong energy efficiency and economic development for the region.
The region’s economies are highly reliant on fossil fuel for their domestic activities. Yet the renewables deployment potentials are 
large, deployment is already happening (Cugurullo, 2013; IRENA, 2016) and positive economic benefits can be envisaged (Sgouridis 
et al., 2016). Nonetheless, the use of renewables is currently limited by economics and structural challenges (Lilliestam and Patt, 
2015; Griffiths, 2017a). Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is also envisaged with concrete steps towards implementation (Alsheyab, 
2017; Ustadi et al., 2017); yet the real potential of this technology in terms of scale and economic dimensions is still uncertain.
Beyond the above mitigation-related challenges, the region’s human societies and fragile ecosystems are highly vulnerable to the 
impacts of climate change, such as water stress (Evans et al., 2004; Shaffrey et al., 2009), desertification (Bayram and Öztürk, 2014), 
sea level rise affecting vast low coastal lands, and high temperature and humidity with future levels potentially beyond adaptive 
capacities (Pal and Eltahir, 2016). A low-carbon pathway that manages climate-related risks within the context of sustainable 
development requires an approach that jointly addresses both types of vulnerabilities (Al Ansari, 2013; Lilliestam and Patt, 2015; 
Babiker, 2016; Griffiths, 2017b).
The Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) for GCC countries identified energy efficiency, deployment of renewables and 
technology transfer to enhance agriculture, food security, protection of marine resources, and management of water and costal zones 
(Babiker, 2016). Strategic vision documents, such as Saudi Arabia’s ‘Vision 2030’, identify emergent opportunities for energy price 
reforms, energy efficiency, turning emissions into valuable products, and deployment of renewables and other clean technologies, if 
accompanied with appropriate policies to manage the transition and in the context of economic diversification (Luomi, 2014; Atalay 
et al., 2016; Griffiths, 2017b; Howarth et al., 2017).
5.4.1.3 Land-based agriculture, forestry and ocean: mitigation 
response options and carbon dioxide removal
In the AFOLU sector, dietary change towards global healthy diets, that 
is, a shift from over-consumption of animal-related to plant-related 
diets, and food waste reduction (see Chapter 4, Section 4.3.2.1) are 
in synergy with SDGs 2 and 6, and SDG 3 through lower consumption 
of animal products and reduced losses and waste throughout the food 
system, contributing to achieving SDGs 12 and 15 (Bajželj et al., 2014; 
Bustamante et al., 2014; Tilman and Clark, 2014; Hiç et al., 2016).
Power dynamics play an important role in achieving behavioural change 
and sustainable consumption (Fuchs et al., 2016). In forest management 
(see Chapter 4, Section 4.3.2.2), encouraging responsible sourcing of 
forest products and securing indigenous land tenure has the potential to 
increase economic benefits by creating decent jobs (SDG 8), maintaining 
biodiversity (SDG 15), facilitating innovation and upgrading technology 
(SDG 9), and encouraging responsible and just decision-making 
(SDG 16) (medium evidence, high agreement) (Ding et al., 2016; WWF, 
2017).
Emerging evidence indicates that future mitigation efforts that would 
be required to reach stringent climate targets, particularly those 
associated with carbon dioxide removal (CDR) (e.g., afforestation and 
reforestation and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage; BECCS), 
may also impose significant constraints upon poor and vulnerable 
communities (SDG 1) via increased food prices and competition for 
arable land, land appropriation and dispossession (Cavanagh and 
Benjaminsen, 2014; Hunsberger et al., 2014; Work, 2015; Muratori et 
al., 2016; Smith et al., 2016; Burns and Nicholson, 2017; Corbera et 
al., 2017) with disproportionate negative impacts upon rural poor and 
indigenous populations (SDG 1) (robust evidence, high agreement) 
(Section 5.4.2.2, Table 5.2, Figure 5.2) (Grubert et al., 2014; Grill et al., 
2015; Zhang and Chen, 2015; Fricko et al., 2016; Johansson et al., 2016; 
Aha and Ayitey, 2017; De Stefano et al., 2017; Shi et al., 2017). Crops 
for bioenergy may increase irrigation needs and exacerbate water 
stress with negative associated impacts on SDGs 6 and 10 (Boysen et 
al., 2017).

coastal (mangrove) and marine (seaweed) vegetative ecosystems 
encourages: integrated water resource management (SDG 6) (Vierros, 
2017); promotes life on land (SDG 15) (Potouroglou et al., 2017); poverty 
reduction (SDG 1) (Schirmer and Bull, 2014; Lamb et al., 2016); and food 
security (SDG 2) (Ahmed et al., 2017a, b; Duarte et al., 2017; Sondak et 
al., 2017; Vierros, 2017; Zhang et al., 2017).

5.4.2 
Sustainable Development Implications of 
1.5°C and 2°C Mitigation Pathways
While previous sections have focused on individual mitigation options 
and their interaction with sustainable development and the SDGs, 
this section takes a systems perspective. Emphasis is on quantitative 
pathways depicting path-dependent evolutions of human and 
natural systems over time. Specifically, the focus is on fundamental 
transformations and thus stringent mitigation policies consistent with 
1.5°C or 2°C, and the differential synergies and trade-offs with respect 
to the various sustainable development dimensions.
Both 1.5°C and 2°C pathways would require deep cuts in greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions and large-scale changes of energy supply and 
demand, as well as in agriculture and forestry systems (see Chapter 
2, Section 2.4). For the assessment of the sustainable development 
implications of these pathways, this chapter draws upon studies that 
show the aggregated impact of mitigation for multiple sustainable 
development dimensions (Grubler et al., 2018; McCollum et al., 
2018b; Rogelj et al., 2018) and across multiple integrated assessment 
modelling (IAM) frameworks. Often these tools are linked to 
disciplinary models covering specific SDGs in more detail (Cameron 
et al., 2016; Rao et al., 2017; Grubler et al., 2018; McCollum et al., 
Chapter 5 
Sustainable Development, Poverty Eradication and Reducing Inequalities

464
2018b). Using multiple IAMs and disciplinary models is important 
for a robust assessment of the sustainable development implications 
of different pathways. Emphasis is on multi-regional studies, which 
can be aggregated to the global scale. The recent literature on 1.5°C 
mitigation pathways has begun to provide quantifications for a range 
of sustainable development dimensions, including air pollution and 
health, food security and hunger, energy access, water security, and 
multidimensional poverty and equity.
5.4.2.1 Air pollution and health
GHGs and air pollutants are typically emitted by the same sources. 
Hence, mitigation strategies that reduce GHGs or the use of fossil fuels 
typically also reduce emissions of pollutants, such as particulate matter 
(e.g., PM2.5 and PM10), black carbon (BC), sulphur dioxide (SO2), 
nitrogen oxides (NOx) and other harmful species (Clarke et al., 2014) 
(Figure 5.3), causing adverse health and ecosystem effects at various 
scales (Kusumaningtyas and Aldrian, 2016).
Mitigation pathways typically show that there are significant synergies 
for air pollution, and that the synergies increase with the stringency of 
the mitigation policies (Amann et al., 2011; Rao et al., 2016; Klimont 
et al., 2017; Shindell et al., 2017; Markandya et al., 2018). Recent 
multimodel comparisons indicate that mitigation pathways consistent 
with 1.5°C would result in higher synergies with air pollution compared 
to pathways that are consistent with 2°C (Figures 5.4 and 5.5). Shindell 
et al. (2018) indicate that health benefits worldwide over the century 
of 1.5°C pathways could be in the range of 110 to 190 million fewer 
premature deaths compared to 2°C pathways. The synergies for air 
pollution are highest in the developing world, particularly in Asia. In 
addition to significant health benefits, there are also economic benefits 
from mitigation, reducing the investment needs in air pollution control 
technologies by about 35% globally (or about 100 billion USD2010 per 
year to 2030 in 1.5°C pathways; McCollum et al., 2018b) (Figure 5.4).
5.4.2.2 Food security and hunger
Stringent climate mitigation pathways in line with ‘well below 2°C’ or 
‘1.5°C’ goals often rely on the deployment of large-scale land-related 
measures, like afforestation and/or bioenergy supply (Popp et al., 2014; 
Rose et al., 2014; Creutzig et al., 2015). These land-related measures 
can compete with food production and hence raise food security 
concerns (Section 5.4.1.3) (P. Smith et al., 2014). Mitigation studies 
indicate that so-called ‘single-minded’ climate policy, aiming solely 
at limiting warming to 1.5°C or 2°C without concurrent measures in 
the food sector, can have negative impacts for global food security 
(Hasegawa et al., 2015; McCollum et al., 2018b). Impacts of 1.5°C 
mitigation pathways can be significantly higher than those of 2°C 
pathways (Figures 5.4 and 5.5). An important driver of the food security 
impacts in these scenarios is the increase of food prices and the effect 
of mitigation on disposable income and wealth due to GHG pricing. A 
recent study indicates that, on aggregate, the price and income effects 
on food may be bigger than the effect due to competition over land 
between food and bioenergy (Hasegawa et al., 2015). 
In order to address the issue of trade-offs with food security, mitigation 
policies would need to be designed in a way that shields the population 
at risk of hunger, including through the adoption of different 
complementary measures, such as food price support. The investment 
needs of complementary food price policies are found to be globally 
relatively much smaller than the associated mitigation investments 
of 1.5°C pathways (Figure 5.3) (McCollum et al., 2018b). Besides 
food support price, other measures include improving productivity 
and efficiency of agricultural production systems (FAO and NZAGRC, 
2017a, b; Frank et al., 2017) and programmes focusing on forest land-
use change (Havlík et al., 2014). All these lead to additional benefits of 
mitigation, improving resilience and livelihoods.
Van Vuuren et al. (2018) and Grubler et al. (2018) show that 1.5°C 
pathways without reliance on BECCS can be achieved through a 
fundamental transformation of the service sectors which would 
significantly reduce energy and food demand (see Chapter 2, Sections 
2.1.1, 2.3.1 and 2.4.3). Such low energy demand (LED) pathways 
would result in significantly reduced pressure on food security, lower 
food prices and fewer people at risk of hunger. Importantly, the trade-
offs with food security would be reduced by the avoided impacts in the 
agricultural sector due to the reduced warming associated with the 
1.5°C pathways (see Chapter 3, Section 3.5). However, such feedbacks 
are not comprehensively captured in the studies on mitigation.
5.4.2.3 Lack of energy access/energy poverty
A lack of access to clean and affordable energy (especially for cooking) 
is a major policy concern in many countries, especially in those in South 
Asia and Africa where major parts of the population still rely primarily 
on solid fuels for cooking (IEA and World Bank, 2017). Scenario studies 
which quantify the interactions between climate mitigation and energy 
access indicate that stringent climate policy which would affect energy 
prices could significantly slow down the transition to clean cooking 
fuels, such as liquefied petroleum gas or electricity (Cameron et al., 
2016).
Estimates across six different IAMs (McCollum et al., 2018b) indicate 
that, in the absence of compensatory measures, the number of people 
without access to clean cooking fuels may increase. Redistributional 
measures, such as subsidies on cleaner fuels and stoves, could 
compensate for the negative effects of mitigation on energy access. 
Investment costs of the redistributional measures in 1.5°C pathways 
(on average around 120 billion USD2010 per year to 2030; Figure 5.4) 
are much smaller than the mitigation investments of 1.5°C pathways 
(McCollum et al., 2018b). The recycling of revenues from climate policy 
might act as a means to help finance the costs of providing energy 
access to the poor (Cameron et al., 2016).
5.4.2.4 Water security
Transformations towards low emissions energy and agricultural 
systems can have major implications for freshwater demand as well as 
water pollution. The scaling up of renewables and energy efficiency as 
depicted by low emissions pathways would, in most instances, lower 
water demands for thermal energy supply facilities (‘water-for-energy’) 
compared to fossil energy technologies, and thus reinforce targets 
related to water access and scarcity (see Chapter 4, Section 4.2.1). 
However, some low-carbon options such as bioenergy, centralized solar

effects are estimated for the effect of mitigation and do not include benefits from avoided impacts (see Chapter 3, Section 3.5). Low energy demand (LED) denotes estimates 
from a pathway with extremely low energy demand reaching 1.5°C without bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). Panel (b) presents the resulting full range

compared to the baseline. Note that the figure shows gross impacts of mitigation and does not include feedbacks due to avoided impacts. The realization of the side effects 
will critically depend on local circumstances and implementation practice. Trade-offs across many sustainable development dimensions can be reduced through complementary/
re-distributional measures. The figure is not comprehensive and focuses on those sustainable development dimensions for which quantifications across models are available.

power, nuclear and hydropower technologies could, if not managed 
properly, have counteracting effects that compound existing water-
related problems in a given locale (Byers et al., 2014; Fricko et al., 2016; 
IEA, 2016; Fujimori et al., 2017a; Wang, 2017; McCollum et al., 2018a).
Under stringent mitigation efforts, the demand for bioenergy can 
result in a substantial increase of water demand for irrigation, thereby 
potentially contributing to water scarcity in water-stressed regions 
(Berger et al., 2015; Bonsch et al., 2016; Jägermeyr et al., 2017). 
However, this risk can be reduced by prioritizing rain-fed production of 
bioenergy (Hayashi et al., 2015, 2018; Bonsch et al., 2016), but might 
have adverse effects for food security (Boysen et al., 2017).
Reducing food and energy demand without compromising the needs 
of the poor emerges as a robust strategy for both water conservation 
and GHG emissions reductions (von Stechow et al., 2015; IEA, 2016; 
Parkinson et al., 2016; Grubler et al., 2018). The results underscore the 
importance of an integrated approach when developing water, energy 
and climate policy (IEA, 2016).
Estimates across different models for the impacts of stringent 
mitigation pathways on energy-related water uses seem ambiguous. 
Some pathways show synergies (Mouratiadou et al., 2018) while 
others indicate trade-offs and thus increases of water use due to 
mitigation (Fricko et al., 2016). The synergies depend on the adopted 
policy implementation or mitigation strategies and technology 
portfolio. A number of adaptation options exist (e.g., dry cooling), 
which can effectively reduce electricity-related water trade-offs (Fricko 
et al., 2016; IEA, 2016). Similarly, irrigation water use will depend on 
the regions where crops are produced, the sources of bioenergy (e.g., 
agriculture vs. forestry) and dietary change induced by climate policy. 
Overall, and also considering other water-related SDGs, including 
access to safe drinking water and sanitation as well as waste-water 
treatment, investments into the water sector seem to be only modestly 
affected by stringent climate policy compatible with 1.5°C (Figure 5.4) 
(McCollum et al., 2018b).
In summary, the assessment of mitigation pathways shows that to 
meet the 1.5°C target, a wide range of mitigation options would need 
to be deployed (see Chapter 2, Sections 2.3 and 2.4). While pathways 
aiming at 1.5°C are associated with high synergies for some sustainable 
development dimensions (such as human health and air pollution, forest 
preservation), the rapid pace and magnitude of the required changes 
would also lead to increased risks for trade-offs for other sustainable 
development dimensions (particularly food security) (Figures 5.4 and 
5.5). Synergies and trade-offs are expected to be unevenly distributed 
between regions and nations (Box 5.2), though little literature has 
formally examined such distributions under 1.5°C-consistent mitigation 
scenarios. Reducing these risks requires smart policy designs and 
mechanisms that shield the poor and redistribute the burden so that the 
most vulnerable are not disproportionately affected. Recent scenario 
analyses show that associated investments for reducing the trade-offs 
for, for example, food, water and energy access to be significantly lower 
than the required mitigation investments (McCollum et al., 2018b). 
Fundamental transformation of demand, including efficiency and 
behavioural changes, can help to significantly reduce the reliance on 
risky technologies, such as BECCS, and thus reduce the risk of potential

the median investment in 1.5°C pathways across results from different models, and 
solid bars for 2°C pathways, respectively. Whiskers on bars represent minima and

investments across mitigation options compared to the baseline. Negative mitigation 
investments (grey bars) denote disinvestment (reduced investment needs) into 
fossil fuel sectors compared to the baseline. Investments for different sustainable 
development dimensions denote the investment needs for complementary measures 
in order to avoid trade-offs (negative impacts) of mitigation. Negative sustainable 
development investments for air pollution indicate cost savings, and thus synergies 
of mitigation for air pollution control costs. The values compare to about 2 trillion

trade-offs between mitigation and other sustainable development 
dimensions (von Stechow et al., 2015; Grubler et al., 2018; van Vuuren 
et al., 2018). Reliance on demand-side measures only, however, would 
not be sufficient for meeting stringent targets, such as 1.5°C and 2°C 
(Clarke et al., 2014).

Sustainable Development 
Pathways to 1.5°C 
This section assesses what is known in the literature on development 
pathways that are sustainable and climate-resilient and relevant to 
a 1.5°C warmer world. Pathways, transitions from today’s world to 
achieving a set of future goals (see Chapter 1, Section 1.2.3, Cross-
Chapter Box 1), follow broadly two main traditions: first, as integrated 
pathways describing the required societal and systems transformations, 
combining quantitative modelling and qualitative narratives at multiple 
spatial scales (global to sub-national); and second, as country- and 
community-level, solution-oriented trajectories and decision-making 
processes about context- and place-specific opportunities, challenges 
and trade-offs. These two notions of pathways offer different, though 
complementary, insights into the nature of 1.5°C-relevant trajectories 
and the short-term actions that enable long-term goals. Both highlight 
to varying degrees the urgency, ethics and equity dimensions of 
possible trajectories and society- and system-wide transformations, yet 
at different scales, building on Chapter 2 (see Section 2.4) and Chapter 
4 (see Section 4.5).

5.5.1 
Integration of Adaptation, Mitigation 
and Sustainable Development
Insights into climate-compatible development (see Glossary) 
illustrate how integration between adaptation, mitigation and 
sustainable development works in context-specific projects, how 
synergies are achieved and what challenges are encountered during 
implementation (Stringer et al., 2014; Suckall et al., 2014; Antwi-Agyei 
et al., 2017a; Bickersteth et al., 2017; Kalafatis, 2017; Nunan, 2017). 
The operationalization of climate-compatible development, including 
climate-smart agriculture and carbon-forestry projects (Lipper et al., 
2014; Campbell et al., 2016; Quan et al., 2017), shows multilevel 
and multisector trade-offs involving ‘winners’ and ‘losers’ across 
governance levels (high confidence) (Kongsager and Corbera, 2015; 
Naess et al., 2015; Karlsson et al., 2017; Tanner et al., 2017; Taylor, 
2017; Wood, 2017; Ficklin et al., 2018). Issues of power, participation, 
values, equity, inequality and justice transcend case study examples of 
attempted integrated approaches (Nunan, 2017; Phillips et al., 2017; 
Stringer et al., 2017; Wood, 2017), also reflected in policy frameworks 
for integrated outcomes (Stringer et al., 2014; Di Gregorio et al., 2017; 
Few et al., 2017; Tanner et al., 2017).
Ultimately, reconciling trade-offs between development needs and 
emissions reductions towards a 1.5°C warmer world requires a 
dynamic view of the interlinkages between adaptation, mitigation 
and sustainable development (Nunan, 2017). This entails recognition 
of the ways in which development contexts shape the choice and 
effectiveness of interventions, limit the range of responses afforded 
to communities and governments, and potentially impose injustices 
upon vulnerable groups (UNRISD, 2016; Thornton and Comberti, 2017). 
A variety of approaches, both quantitative and qualitative, exist to 
examine possible sustainable development pathways under which 
climate and sustainable development goals can be achieved, and 
synergies and trade-offs for transformation identified (Sections 5.3 
and 5.4).
5.5.2 
Pathways for Adaptation, Mitigation 
and Sustainable Development 
This section focuses on the growing body of pathways literature 
describing the dynamic and systemic integration of mitigation 
and adaptation with sustainable development in the context of a 
1.5°C warmer world. These studies are critically important for the 
identification of ‘enabling’ conditions under which climate and the 
SDGs can be achieved, and thus help the design of transformation 
strategies that maximize synergies and avoid potential trade-offs 
(Sections 5.3 and 5.4). Full integration of sustainable development 
dimensions is, however, challenging, given their diversity and the need 
for high temporal, spatial and social resolution to address local effects, 
including heterogeneity related to poverty and equity (von Stechow 
et al., 2015). Research on long-term climate change mitigation and 
adaptation pathways has covered individual SDGs to different degrees. 
Interactions between climate and other SDGs have been explored for 
SDGs 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 12, 14 and 15 (Clarke et al., 2014; Abel et al., 2016; 
von Stechow et al., 2016; Rao et al., 2017), while interactions with 
SDGs 1, 5, 11 and 16 remain largely underexplored in integrated long-
term scenarios (Zimm et al., 2018).
Quantitative pathways studies now better represent ‘nexus’ 
approaches to assess sustainable development dimensions. In such 
approaches (see Chapter 4, Section 4.3.3.8), a subset of sustainable 
development dimensions are investigated together because of their 
close relationships (Welsch et al., 2014; Conway et al., 2015; Keairns 
et al., 2016; Parkinson et al., 2016; Rasul and Sharma, 2016; Howarth 
and Monasterolo, 2017). Compared to single-objective climate–SDG 
assessments (Section 5.4.2), nexus solutions attempt to integrate 
complex interdependencies across diverse sectors in a systems 
approach for consistent analysis. Recent pathways studies show how 
water, energy and climate (SDGs 6, 7 and 13) interact (Parkinson et al., 
2016; McCollum et al., 2018b) and call for integrated water–energy 
investment decisions to manage systemic risks. For instance, the 
provision of bioenergy, important in many 1.5°C-consistent pathways, 
can help resolve ‘nexus challenges’ by alleviating energy security 
concerns, but can also have adverse ‘nexus impacts’ on food security, 
water use and biodiversity (Lotze-Campen et al., 2014; Bonsch et al., 
2016). Policies that improve resource use efficiency across sectors can 
maximize synergies for sustainable development (Bartos and Chester, 
2014; McCollum et al., 2018b; van Vuuren et al., 2018). Mitigation 
compatible with 1.5°C can significantly reduce impacts and adaptation 
needs in the nexus sectors compared to 2°C (Byers et al., 2018). In 
order to avoid trade-offs due to high carbon pricing of 1.5°C pathways, 
regulation in specific areas may complement price-based instruments. 
Such combined policies generally lead also to more early action 
maximizing synergies and avoiding some of the adverse climate effects 
for sustainable development (Bertram et al., 2018).
The comprehensive analysis of climate change in the context of 
sustainable development requires suitable reference scenarios that 
lend themselves to broader sustainable development analyses. 
The Shared Socio-Economic Pathways (SSPs) (Chapter 1, Cross-
Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1) (O’Neill et al., 2017a; Riahi et al., 2017) 
constitute an important first step in providing a framework for 
the integrated assessment of adaptation and mitigation and their 
climate–development linkages (Ebi et al., 2014). The five underlying 
SSP narratives (O’Neill et al., 2017a) map well into some of the key 
SDG dimensions, with one of the pathways (SSP1) explicitly depicting 
sustainability as the main theme (van Vuuren et al., 2017b).
To date, no pathway in the literature proves to achieve all 17 SDGs 
because several targets are not met or not sufficiently covered in the 
analysis, hence resulting in a sustainability gap (Zimm et al., 2018). 
The SSPs facilitate the systematic exploration of different sustainable 
dimensions under ambitious climate objectives. SSP1 proves to be in 
line with eight SDGs (3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13 and 15) and several of their 
targets in a 2°C warmer world (van Vuuren et al., 2017b; Zimm et al., 
2018). However, important targets for SDGs 1, 2 and 4 (i.e., people 
living in extreme poverty, people living at the risk of hunger and gender 
gap in years of schooling) are not met in this scenario.
The SSPs show that sustainable socio-economic conditions will play a 
key role in reaching stringent climate targets (Riahi et al., 2017; Rogelj 
et al., 2018). Recent modelling work has examined 1.5°C-consistent, 
stringent mitigation scenarios for 2100 applied to the SSPs, using 
six different IAMs. Despite the limitations of these models, which 
are coarse approximations of reality, robust trends can be identified 
Chapter 5 
Sustainable Development, Poverty Eradication and Reducing Inequalities
5
468
(Rogelj et al., 2018). SSP1 – which depicts broader ‘sustainability’ as 
well as enhancing equity and poverty reductions – is the only pathway 
where all models could reach 1.5°C and is associated with the lowest 
mitigation costs across all SSPs. A decreasing number of models was 
successful for SSP2, SSP4 and SSP5, respectively, indicating distinctly 
higher risks of failure due to high growth and energy intensity as 
well as geographical and social inequalities and uneven regional 
development. And reaching 1.5°C has even been found infeasible in 
the less sustainable SSP3 – ‘regional rivalry’ (Fujimori et al., 2017b; 
Riahi et al., 2017). All these conclusions hold true if a 2°C objective is 
considered (Calvin et al., 2017; Fujimori et al., 2017b; Popp et al., 2017; 
Riahi et al., 2017). Rogelj et al. (2018) also show that fewer scenarios 
are, however, feasible across different SSPs in case of 1.5°C, and 
mitigation costs substantially increase in 1.5°C pathways compared 
to 2°C pathways.
There is a wide range of SSP-based studies focusing on the connections 
between adaptation/impacts and different sustainable development 
dimensions (Hasegawa et al., 2014; Ishida et al., 2014; Arnell et al., 
2015; Bowyer et al., 2015; Burke et al., 2015; Lemoine and Kapnick, 
2016; Rozenberg and Hallegatte, 2016; Blanco et al., 2017; Hallegatte 
and Rozenberg, 2017; O’Neill et al., 2017a; Rutledge et al., 2017; 
Byers et al., 2018). New methods for projecting inequality and poverty 
(downscaled to sub-national rural and urban levels as well as spatially 
explicit levels) have enabled advanced SSP-based assessments of 
locally sustainable development implications of avoided impacts 
and related adaptation needs. For instance, Byers et al. (2018) find 
that, in a 1.5°C warmer world, a focus on sustainable development 
can reduce the climate risk exposure of populations vulnerable to 
poverty by more than an order of magnitude (Section 5.2.2). Moreover, 
aggressive reductions in between-country inequality may decrease 
the emissions intensity of global economic growth (Rao and Min, 
2018). This is due to the higher potential for decoupling of energy 
from income growth in lower-income countries, due to high potential 
for technological advancements that reduce the energy intensity of 
growth of poor countries – critical also for reaching 1.5°C in a socially 
and economically equitable way. Participatory downscaling of SSPs in 
several European Union countries and in Central Asia shows numerous 
possible pathways of solutions to the 2°C–1.5°C goal, depending on 
differential visions (Tàbara et al., 2018). Other participatory applications 
of the SSPs, for example in West Africa (Palazzo et al., 2017) and the 
southeastern United States (Absar and Preston, 2015), illustrate the 
potentially large differences in adaptive capacity within regions and 
between sectors.
Harnessing the full potential of the SSP framework to inform sustainable 
development requires: (i) further elaboration and extension of the 
current SSPs to cover sustainable development objectives explicitly; (ii) 
the development of new or variants of current narratives that would 
facilitate more SDG-focused analyses with climate as one objective 
(among other SDGs) (Riahi et al., 2017); (iii) scenarios with high regional 
resolution (Fujimori et al., 2017b); (iv) a more explicit representation 
of institutional and governance change associated with the SSPs 
(Zimm et al., 2018); and (v) a scale-up of localized and spatially explicit 
vulnerability, poverty and inequality estimates, which have emerged 
in recent publications based on the SSPs (Byers et al., 2018) and are 
essential to investigate equity dimensions (Klinsky and Winkler, 2018).
5.5.3 
Climate-Resilient Development Pathways
This section assesses the literature on pathways as solution-
oriented trajectories and decision-making processes for attaining 
transformative visions for a 1.5°C warmer world. It builds on climate-
resilient development pathways (CRDPs) introduced in the AR5 
(Section 5.1.2) (Olsson et al., 2014) as well as growing literature 
(e.g., Eriksen et al., 2017; Johnson, 2017; Orindi et al., 2017; Kirby and 
O’Mahony, 2018; Solecki et al., 2018) that uses CRDPs as a conceptual 
and aspirational idea for steering societies towards low-carbon, 
prosperous and ecologically safe futures. Such a notion of pathways 
foregrounds decision-making processes at local to national levels to 
situate transformation, resilience, equity and well-being in the complex 
reality of specific places, nations and communities (Harris et al., 2017; 
Ziervogel et al., 2017; Fazey et al., 2018; Gajjar et al., 2018; Klinsky and 
Winkler, 2018; Patterson et al., 2018; Tàbara et al., 2018).
Pathways compatible with 1.5°C warming are not merely scenarios 
to envision possible futures but processes of deliberation and 
implementation that address societal values, local priorities and 
inevitable trade-offs. This includes attention to politics and power that 
perpetuate business-as-usual trajectories (O’Brien, 2016; Harris et al., 
2017), the politics that shape sustainability and capabilities of everyday 
life (Agyeman et al., 2016; Schlosberg et al., 2017), and ingredients 
for community resilience and transformative change (Fazey et al., 
2018). Chartering CRDPs encourages locally situated and problem-
solving processes to negotiate and operationalize resilience ‘on the 
ground’ (Beilin and Wilkinson, 2015; Harris et al., 2017; Ziervogel et 
al., 2017). This entails contestation, inclusive governance and iterative 
engagement of diverse populations with varied needs, aspirations, 
agency and rights claims, including those most affected, to deliberate 
trade-offs in a multiplicity of possible pathways (high confidence) (see 
Figure 5.5) (Stirling, 2014; Vale, 2014; Walsh-Dilley and Wolford, 2015; 
Biermann et al., 2016; J.R.A. Butler et al., 2016; O’Brien, 2016, 2018; 
Harris et al., 2017; Jones and Tanner, 2017; Mapfumo et al., 2017; 
Rosenbloom, 2017; Gajjar et al., 2018; Klinsky and Winkler, 2018; Lyon, 
2018; Tàbara et al., 2018).
5.5.3.1 Transformations, equity and well-being
Most literature related to CRDPs invokes the concept of transformation, 
underscoring the need for urgent and far-reaching changes in practices, 
institutions and social relations in society. Transformations towards a 
1.5°C warmer world would need to address considerations for equity 
and well-being, including in trade-off decisions (see Figure 5.1).
To attain the anticipated transformations, all countries as well as non-
state actors would need to strengthen their contributions, through 
bolder and more committed cooperation and equitable effort-sharing 
(medium evidence, high agreement) (Rao, 2014; Frumhoff et al., 2015; 
Ekwurzel et al., 2017; Millar et al., 2017; Shue, 2017; Holz et al., 2018; 
Robinson and Shine, 2018). Sustaining decarbonization rates at a 
1.5°C-compatible level would be unprecedented and not possible 
without rapid transformations to a net-zero-emissions global economy 
by mid-century or the later half of the century (see Chapters 2 and 
4). Such efforts would entail overcoming technical, infrastructural, 
institutional and behavioural barriers across all sectors and levels

of society (Pfeiffer et al., 2016; Seto et al., 2016) and defeating path 
dependencies, including poverty traps (Boonstra et al., 2016; Enqvist 
et al., 2016; Lade et al., 2017; Haider et al., 2018). Transformation also 
entails ensuring that 1.5°C-compatible pathways are inclusive and 
desirable, build solidarity and alliances, and protect vulnerable groups, 
including against disruptions of transformation (Patterson et al., 2018).
There is growing emphasis on the role of equity, fairness and justice (see 
Glossary) regarding context-specific transformations and pathways 
to a 1.5°C warmer world (medium evidence, high agreement) (Shue, 
2014; Thorp, 2014; Dennig et al., 2015; Moellendorf, 2015; Klinsky et 
al., 2017b; Roser and Seidel, 2017; Sealey-Huggins, 2017; Klinsky and 
Winkler, 2018; Robinson and Shine, 2018). Consideration for what is 
equitable and fair suggests the need for stringent decarbonization 
and up-scaled adaptation that do not exacerbate social injustices, 
locally and at national levels (Okereke and Coventry, 2016), uphold 
human rights (Robinson and Shine, 2018), are socially desirable and 
acceptable (von Stechow et al., 2016; Rosenbloom, 2017), address 
values and beliefs (O’Brien, 2018), and overcome vested interests 
(Normann, 2015; Patterson et al., 2016). Attention is often drawn to 
huge disparities in the cost, benefits, opportunities and challenges 
involved in transformation within and between countries, and the 
fact that the suffering of already poor, vulnerable and disadvantaged 
populations may be worsened, if care to protect them is not taken 
(Holden et al., 2017; Klinsky and Winkler, 2018; Patterson et al., 2018).
Well-being for all (Dearing et al., 2014; Raworth, 2017) is at the 
core of an ecologically safe and socially just space for humanity, 
including health and housing, peace and justice, social equity, gender 
equality and political voices (Raworth, 2017). It is in alignment with 
transformative social development (UNRISD, 2016) and the 2030 
Agenda of ‘leaving no one behind’. The social conditions to enable well-
being for all are to reduce entrenched inequalities within and between 
countries (Klinsky and Winkler, 2018); rethink prevailing values, ethics 
and behaviours (Holden et al., 2017); allow people to live a life in 
dignity while avoiding actions that undermine capabilities (Klinsky 
and Golub, 2016); transform economies (Popescu and Ciurlau, 2016; 
Tàbara et al., 2018); overcome uneven consumption and production 
patterns (Dearing et al., 2014; Häyhä et al., 2016; Raworth, 2017) and 
conceptualize development as well-being rather than mere economic 
growth (medium evidence, high agreement) (Gupta and Pouw, 2017).
5.5.3.2 Development trajectories, sharing 
of efforts and cooperation
The potential for pursuing sustainable and climate-resilient development 
pathways towards a 1.5°C warmer world differs between and within 
nations, due to differential development achievements and trajectories, 
and opportunities and challenges (very high confidence) (Figure 5.1). 
There are clear differences between high-income countries where 
social achievements are high, albeit often with negative effects on 
the environment, and most developing nations where vulnerabilities 
to climate change are high and social support and life satisfaction 
are low, especially in the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) (Sachs et 
al., 2017; O’Neill et al., 2018). Differential starting points for CRDPs 
between and within countries, including path dependencies (Figure 
5.5), call for sensitivity to context (Klinsky and Winkler, 2018). For the 
developing world, limiting warming to 1.5°C also means potentially

470
severely curtailed development prospects (Okereke and Coventry, 
2016) and risks to human rights from both climate action and inaction 
to achieve this goal (Robinson and Shine, 2018) (Section 5.2). Within-
country development differences remain, despite efforts to ensure 
inclusive societies (Gupta and Arts, 2017; Gupta and Pouw, 2017). Cole 
et al. (2017), for instance, show how differences between provinces in 
South Africa constitute barriers to sustainable development trajectories 
and for operationalising nation-level SDGs, across various dimensions 
of social deprivation and environmental stress, reflecting historic 
disadvantages.
Moreover, various equity and effort- or burden-sharing approaches to 
climate stabilization in the literature describe how to sketch national 
potentials for a 1.5°C warmer world (e.g., Anand, 2004; CSO Equity 
Review, 2015; Meinshausen et al., 2015; Okereke and Coventry, 2016; 
Bexell and Jönsson, 2017; Otto et al., 2017; Pan et al., 2017; Robiou du 
Pont et al., 2017; Holz et al., 2018; Kartha et al., 2018; Winkler et al., 
2018;). Many approaches build on the AR5 ‘responsibility – capacity –
need’ assessment (Clarke et al., 2014), complement other proposed 
national-level metrics for capabilities, equity and fairness (Heyward 
and Roser, 2016; Klinsky et al., 2017a), or fall under the wider umbrella 
of fair share debates on responsibility, capability and the right to 
development in climate policy (Fuglestvedt and Kallbekken, 2016). 
Importantly, different principles and methodologies generate different 
calculated contributions, responsibilities and capacities (Skeie et al., 
2017).
The notion of nation-level fair shares is now also discussed in the 
context of limiting global warming to 1.5°C and the Nationally 
Determined Contributions (NDCs) (see Chapter 4, Cross-Chapter Box 
11 in Chapter 4) (CSO Equity Review, 2015; Mace, 2016; Pan et al., 
2017; Robiou du Pont et al., 2017; Holz et al., 2018; Kartha et al., 2018; 
Winkler et al., 2018). A study by Pan et al. (2017) concluded that all 
countries would need to contribute to ambitious emissions reductions 
and that current pledges for 2030 by seven out of eight high-emitting 
countries would be insufficient to meet 1.5°C. Emerging literature on 
justice-centred pathways to 1.5°C points towards ambitious emissions 
reductions domestically and committed cooperation internationally 
whereby wealthier countries support poorer ones, technologically, 
financially and otherwise to enhance capacities (Okereke and Coventry, 
2016; Holz et al., 2018; Robinson and Shine, 2018; Shue, 2018). These 
findings suggest that equitable and 1.5°C-compatible pathways would 
require fast action across all countries at all levels of development 
rather than late accession of developing countries (as assumed under 
SSP3, see Chapter 2), with external support for prompt mitigation and 
resilience-building efforts in the latter (medium evidence, medium 
agreement).
Scientific advances since the AR5 now also make it possible to determine 
contributions to climate change for non-state actors (see Chapter 4, 
Section 4.4.1) and their potential to contribute to CRDPs (medium 
evidence, medium agreement). These non-state actors includes cities 
(Bulkeley et al., 2013, 2014; Byrne et al., 2016), businesses (Heede, 
2014; Frumhoff et al., 2015; Shue, 2017), transnational initiatives 
(Castro, 2016; Andonova et al., 2017) and industries. Recent work 
demonstrates the contributions of 90 industrial carbon producers to 
global temperature and sea level rise, and their responsibilities to 
contribute to investments in and support for mitigation and adaptation 
(Heede, 2014; Ekwurzel et al., 2017; Shue, 2017) (Sections 5.6.1 and 
5.6.2).
At the level of groups and individuals, equity in pursuing climate 
resilience for a 1.5°C warmer world means addressing disadvantage, 
inequities and empowerment that shape transformative processes 
and pathways (Fazey et al., 2018), and deliberate efforts to strengthen 
the capabilities, capacities and well-being of poor, marginalized and 
vulnerable people (Byrnes, 2014; Tokar, 2014; Harris et al., 2017; 
Klinsky et al., 2017a; Klinsky and Winkler, 2018). Community-driven 
CRDPs can flag potential negative impacts of national trajectories on 
disadvantaged groups, such as low-income families and communities 
of colour (Rao, 2014). They emphasize social equity, participatory 
governance, social inclusion and human rights, as well as innovation, 
experimentation and social learning (see Glossary) (medium evidence, 
high agreement) (Sections 5.5.3.3 and 5.6).
5.5.3.3 Country and community strategies and experiences 
There are many possible pathways towards climate-resilient futures 
(O’Brien, 2018; Tàbara et al., 2018). Literature depicting different 
sustainable development trajectories in line with CRDPs is growing, with 
some of it being specific to 1.5°C global warming. Most experiences 
to date are at local and sub-national levels (Cross-Chapter Box 13 in 
this chapter), while state-level efforts align largely with green economy 
trajectories or planning for climate resilience (Box 5.3). Due to the fact 
that these strategies are context-specific, the literature is scarce on 
comparisons, efforts to scale up and systematic monitoring.
States can play an enabling or hindering role in a transition to a 1.5°C 
warmer world (Patterson et al., 2018). The literature on strategies to 
reconcile low-carbon trajectories with sustainable development and 
ecological sustainability through green growth, inclusive growth, 
de-growth, post-growth and development as well-being shows low 
agreement (see Chapter 4, Section 4.5). Efforts that align best with 
CRDPs are described as ‘transformational’ and ‘strong’ (Ferguson, 
2015). Some view ‘thick green’ perspectives as enabling equity, 
democracy and agency building (Lorek and Spangenberg, 2014; Stirling, 
2014; Ehresman and Okereke, 2015; Buch-Hansen, 2018), others show 
how green economy and sustainable development pathways can align 
(Brown et al., 2014; Georgeson et al., 2017b), and how a green economy 
can help link the SDGs with NDCs, for instance in Mongolia, Kenya and 
Sweden (Shine, 2017). Others still critique the continuous reliance on 
market mechanisms (Wanner, 2014; Brockington and Ponte, 2015) and 
disregard for equity and distributional and procedural justice (Stirling, 
2014; Bell, 2015).
Country-level pathways and achievements vary significantly (robust 
evidence, medium agreement). For instance, the Scandinavian countries 
rank at the top of the Global Green Economy Index (Dual Citizen LLC, 
2016), although they also tend to show high spill-over effects (Holz et al., 
2018) and transgress their biophysical boundaries (O’Neill et al., 2018). 
State-driven efforts in non-member countries of the Organisation for 
Economic Co-operation and Development include Ethiopia’s ‘Climate-
resilient Green Economy Strategy’, Mozambique’s ‘Green Economy 
Action Plan’ and Costa Rica’s ecosystem- and conservation-driven 
Sustainable Development, Poverty Eradication and Reducing Inequalities

green transition paths. China and India have adopted technology and 
renewables pathways (Brown et al., 2014; Death, 2014, 2015, 2016; 
Khanna et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2015; Kim and Thurbon, 2015; Wang 
et al., 2015; Weng et al., 2015). Brazil promotes low per capita GHG 
emissions, clean energy sources, green jobs, renewables and sustainable 
transportation, while slowing rates of deforestation (see Chapter 4, Box 
4.7) (Brown et al., 2014; La Rovere, 2017). Yet concerns remain regarding 
persistent inequalities, ecosystem monetization, lack of participation 
in green-style projects (Brown et al., 2014) and labour conditions and 
risk of displacement in the sugarcane ethanol sector (McKay et al., 
2016). Experiences with low-carbon development pathways in LDCs 
highlight the crucial role of identifying synergies across scale, removing 
institutional barriers and ensuring equity and fairness in distributing 
benefits as part of the right to development (Rai and Fisher, 2017).
In small islands states, for many of which climate change hazards and 
impacts at 1.5°C pose significant risks to sustainable development (see 
Chapter 3 Box 3.5, Chapter 4 Box 4.3, Box 5.3), examples of CRDPs 
have emerged since the AR5. This includes the SAMOA Pathway: SIDS 
Accelerated Modalities of Action (see Chapter 4, Box 4.3) (UNGA, 2014; 
Government of Kiribati, 2016; Steering Committee on Partnerships for 
SIDS and UN DESA, 2016; Lefale et al., 2017) and the Framework for 
Resilient Development in the Pacific, a leading example of integrated 
regional climate change adaptation planning for mitigation and 
sustainable development, disaster risk management and low-carbon 
economies (SPC, 2016). Small islands of the Pacific vary significantly 
in their capacity and resources to support effective integrated planning 
(McCubbin et al., 2015; Barnett and Walters, 2016; Cvitanovic et al., 
2016; Hemstock et al., 2017; Robinson and Dornan, 2017). Vanuatu (Box 
5.3) has developed a significant coordinated national adaptation plan 
to advance the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, respond to 
the Paris Agreement and reduce the risk of disasters in line with the 
Sendai targets (UNDP, 2016; Republic of Vanuatu, 2017).
Box 5.3 |  Republic of Vanuatu – National Planning for Development and Climate Resilience
The Republic of Vanuatu is leading Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS) to develop a nationally coordinated plan for climate-
resilient development in the context of high exposure to hazard risk (MoCC, 2016; UNU-EHS, 2016). The majority of the population 
depends on subsistence, rain-fed agriculture and coastal fisheries for food security (Sovacool et al., 2017). Sea level rise, increased 
prolonged drought, water shortages, intense storms, cyclone events and degraded coral reef environments threaten human security 
in a 1.5°C warmer world (see Chapter 3, Box 3.5) (SPC, 2015; Aipira et al., 2017). Given Vanuatu’s long history of climate hazards 
and disasters, local adaptive capacity is relatively high, despite barriers to the use of local knowledge and technology, and low rates 
of literacy and women’s participation (McNamara and Prasad, 2014; Aipira et al., 2017; Granderson, 2017). However, the adaptive 
capacity of Vanuatu and other SIDS is increasingly constrained due to more frequent severe weather events (see Chapter 3, Box 
3.5, Chapter 4, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 4) (Gero et al., 2013; Kuruppu and Willie, 2015; SPC, 2015; Sovacool et al., 2017).
Vanuatu has developed a national sustainable development plan for 2016–2030: the People’s Plan (Republic of Vanuatu, 2016). 
This coordinated, inclusive plan of action on economy, environment and society aims to strengthen adaptive capacity and resilience 
to climate change and disasters. It emphasizes rights of all Ni-Vanuatu, including women, youth, the elderly and vulnerable groups 
(Nalau et al., 2016). Vanuatu has also developed a Coastal Adaptation Plan (Republic of Vanuatu, 2016), an integrated Climate 
Change and Disaster Risk Reduction Policy (2016–2030) (SPC, 2015) and the first South Pacific National Advisory Board on Climate 
Change & Disaster Risk Reduction (SPC, 2015; UNDP, 2016).
Vanuatu aims to integrate planning at multiple scales, and increase climate resilience by supporting local coping capacities and 
iterative processes of planning for sustainable development and integrated risk assessment (Aipira et al., 2017; Eriksson et al., 
2017; Granderson, 2017). Climate-resilient development is also supported by non-state partnerships, for example, the ‘Yumi stap 
redi long climate change’–the Vanuatu non-governmental organization Climate Change Adaptation Program (Maclellan, 2015). 
This programme focuses on equitable governance, with particular attention to supporting women’s voices in decision-making 
through allied programmes addressing domestic violence, and rights-based education to reduce social marginalization; alongside 
institutional reforms for greater transparency, accountability and community participation in decision-making (Davies, 2015; 
Maclellan, 2015; Sterrett, 2015; Ensor, 2016; UN Women, 2016).
Power imbalances embedded in the political economy of development (Nunn et al., 2014), gender discrimination (Aipira et al., 2017) 
and the priorities of climate finance (Cabezon et al., 2016) may marginalize the priorities of local communities and influence how 
local risks are understood, prioritised and managed (Kuruppu and Willie, 2015; Baldacchino, 2017; Sovacool et al., 2017). However, 
the experience of the low death toll after Cyclone Pam suggests effective use of local knowledge in planning and early warning may 
support resilience at least in the absence of storm surge flooding (Handmer and Iveson, 2017; Nalau et al., 2017). Nevertheless, the 
very severe infrastructure damage of Cyclone Pam 2015 highlights the limits of individual Pacific SIDS efforts and the need for global 
and regional responses to a 1.5°C warmer world (see Chapter 3, Box 3.5, Chapter 4, Box 4.3) (Dilling et al., 2015; Ensor, 2016; Shultz 
et al., 2016; Rey et al., 2017).

Sustainable Development, Poverty Eradication and Reducing Inequalities

Communities, towns and cities also contribute to low-carbon pathways, 
sustainable development and fair and equitable climate resilience, 
often focused on processes of power, learning and contestation as entry 
points to more localised CRDPs (medium evidence, high agreement) 
(Cross-Chapter Box 13 in this chapter, Box 5.2). In the Scottish Borders 
Climate Resilient Communities Project (United Kingdom), local flood 
management is linked with national policies to foster cross-scalar 
and inclusive governance, with attention to systemic disadvantages, 
shocks and stressors, capacity building, learning for change and climate 
narratives to inspire hope and action, all of which are essential for 
community resilience in a 1.5°C warmer world (Fazey et al., 2018). 
Narratives and storytelling are vital for realizing place-based 1.5°C 
futures as they create space for agency, deliberation, co-constructing 
meaning, imagination and desirable and dignified pathways (Veland 
et al., 2018). Engagement with possible futures, identity and self-
reliance is also documented for Alaska, where warming has already 
exceeded 1.5°C and indigenous communities invest in renewable 
energy, greenhouses for food security and new fishing practices to 
overcome loss of sea ice, flooding and erosion (Chapin et al., 2016; 
Fazey et al., 2018). The Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network 
facilitates shared learning dialogues, risk-to-resilience workshops, and 
iterative, consultative planning in flood-prone cities in India; vulnerable 
communities, municipal governmental agents, entrepreneurs and 
technical experts negotiate different visions, trade-offs and local politics 
to identify desirable pathways (Harris et al., 2017).
Transforming our societies and systems to limit global warming to 
1.5°C and ensuring equity and well-being for human populations 
and ecosystems in a 1.5°C warmer world would require ambitious 
and well-integrated adaptation–mitigation–development pathways 
that deviate fundamentally from high-carbon, business-as-usual 
futures (Okereke and Coventry, 2016; Arts, 2017; Gupta and Arts, 
2017; Sealey-Huggins, 2017). Identifying and negotiating socially 
acceptable, inclusive and equitable pathways towards climate-
resilient futures is a challenging, yet important, endeavour, fraught 
with complex moral, practical and political difficulties and inevitable 
trade-offs (very high confidence). The ultimate questions are: what 
futures do we want (Bai et al., 2016; Tàbara et al., 2017; Klinsky and 
Winkler, 2018; O’Brien, 2018; Veland et al., 2018), whose resilience 
matters, for what, where, when and why (Meerow and Newell, 2016), 
and ‘whose vision … is being pursued and along which pathways’ 
(Gillard et al., 2016).

Global Urbanization in a 1.5°C Warmer World
The concentration of economic activity, dense social networks, human resource capacity, investment in infrastructure and buildings, 
relatively nimble local governments, close connection to surrounding rural and natural environments, and a tradition of innovation 
provide urban areas with transformational potential (see Chapter 4, Section 4.3.3) (Castán Broto, 2017). In this sense, the urbanization 
megatrend that will take place over the next three decades, and add approximately 2 billion people to the global urban population 
(UN, 2014), offers opportunities for efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C.
Cities can also, however, concentrate the risks of flooding, landslides, fire and infectious and parasitic disease that are expected to 
heighten in a 1.5°C warmer world (Chapter 3). In African and Asian countries where urbanization rates are highest, these risks could 
expose and amplify pre-existing stresses related to poverty, exclusion, and governance (Gore, 2015; Dodman et al., 2017; Jiang and 
O’Neill, 2017; Pelling et al., 2018; Solecki et al., 2018). Through its impact on economic development and investment, urbanization 
often leads to increased consumption and environmental degradation and enhanced vulnerability and risk (Rosenzweig et al., 2018). 
In the absence of innovation, the combination of urbanization and urban economic development could contribute 226 GtCO2 in 
emissions by 2050 (Bai et al., 2018). At the same time, some new urban developments are demonstrating combined carbon and 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) benefits (Wiktorowicz et al., 2018), and it is in towns and cities that building renovation rates 
can be most easily accelerated to support the transition to 1.5°C pathways (Kuramochi et al., 2018), including through voluntary 
programmes (Van der Heijden, 2018).
Urban transformations and emerging climate-resilient development pathways
The 1.5°C pathways require action in all cities and urban contexts. Recent literature emphasizes the need to deliberate and negotiate 
how resilience and climate-resilient pathways can be fostered in the context of people’s daily lives, including the failings of everyday 
development such as unemployment, inadequate housing and a growing informal sector and settlements (informality), in order

to acknowledge local priorities and foster transformative learning (Vale, 2014; Shi et al., 2016; Harris et al., 2017; Ziervogel et al., 
2017; Fazey et al., 2018; Macintyre et al., 2018). Enhancing deliberate transformative capacities in urban contexts also entails new 
and relational forms of envisioning agency, equity, resilience, social cohesion and well-being (Section 5.5.3) (Gillard et al., 2016; 
Ziervogel et al., 2016). Two examples of urban transformation are explored here.
The built environment, spatial planning, infrastructure, energy services, mobility and urban–rural linkages necessary in rapidly 
growing cities in South Asia and Africa in the next three decades present mitigation, adaptation and development opportunities 
that are crucial for a 1.5°C world (Newman et al., 2017; Lwasa et al., 2018; Teferi and Newman, 2018). Realizing these opportunities 
would require the structural challenges of poverty, weak and contested local governance, and low levels of local government 
investment to be addressed on an unprecedented scale (Wachsmuth et al., 2016; Chu et al., 2017; van Noorloos and Kloosterboer, 
2017; Pelling et al., 2018).
Urban governance is critical to ensuring that the necessary urban transitions deliver economic growth and equity (Hughes et al., 
2018). The proximity of local governments to citizens and their needs can make them powerful agents of climate action (Melica et 
al., 2018), but urban governance is enhanced when it involves multiple actors (Ziervogel et al., 2016; Pelling et al., 2018), supportive 
national governments (Tait and Euston-Brown, 2017), and sub-national climate networks (see Chapter 4, Section 4.4.1). Governance 
is complicated for the urban population currently living in informality. This population is expected to triple, to three billion, by 
2050 (Satterthwaite et al., 2018), placing a significant portion of the world’s population beyond the direct reach of formal climate 
mitigation and adaptation policies (Revi et al., 2014). How to address the co-evolved and structural conditions that lead to urban 
informality and associated vulnerability to 1.5°C of warming is a central question for this report. Brown and McGranahan (2016) 
cite evidence that the informal urban ‘green economy’ that has emerged out of necessity in the absence of formal service provisions 
is frequently low-carbon and resource-efficient.
Realising the potential for low carbon transitions in informal urban settlements would require an express recognition of the unpaid-
for contributions of women in the informal economy, and new partnerships between the state and communities (Ziervogel et al., 
2017; Pelling et al., 2018; Satterthwaite et al., 2018). There is no guarantee that these partnerships will evolve or cohere into the 
type of service delivery and climate governance system that could steer the change on a scale required to limit to warming to 1.5°C 
(Jaglin, 2014). However, work by transnational networks, such as Shack/Slum Dwellers International, C40, the Global Covenant 
of Mayors, and the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives, as well as efforts to combine in-country planning for 
Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) (Andonova et al., 2017; Fuhr et al., 2018) with those taking place to support the New 
Urban Agenda and National Urban Policies, represent one step towards realizing the potential (Tait and Euston-Brown, 2017). 
So too do ‘old urban agendas’, such as slum upgrading and universal water and sanitation provision (McGranahan et al., 2016; 
Satterthwaite, 2016; Satterthwaite et al., 2018).
Transition Towns (TTs) are a type of urban transformation that have emerged mainly in high-income countries. The grassroots TT 
movement (origin in the United Kingdom) combines adaptation, mitigation and just transitions, mainly at the level of communities 
and small towns. It now has more than 1,300 registered local initiatives in more than 40 countries (Grossmann and Creamer, 
2017), many of them in the United Kingdom, the United States, and other high-income countries. TTs are described as ‘progressive 
localism’ (Cretney et al., 2016), aiming to foster a ‘communitarian ecological citizenship’ that goes beyond changes in consumption 
and lifestyle (Kenis, 2016). They aspire to promote equitable communities resilient to the impacts of climate change, peak oil and 
unstable global markets; re-localization of production and consumption; and transition pathways to a post-carbon future (Feola and 
Nunes, 2014; Evans and Phelan, 2016; Grossmann and Creamer, 2017).
TT initiatives typically pursue lifestyle-related low-carbon living and economies, food self-sufficiency, energy efficiency through 
renewables, construction with locally sourced material and cottage industries (Barnes, 2015; Staggenborg and Ogrodnik, 2015; 
Taylor Aiken, 2016). Social and iterative learning through the collective involves dialogue, deliberation, capacity building, citizen 
science engagements, technical re-skilling to increase self-reliance, for example canning and preserving food and permaculture, 
future visioning and emotional training to share difficulties and loss (Feola and Nunes, 2014; Barnes, 2015; Boke, 2015; Taylor Aiken, 
2015; Kenis, 2016; Mehmood, 2016; Grossmann and Creamer, 2017).
Important conditions for successful transition groups include flexibility, participatory democracy, care ethics, inclusiveness and 
consensus-building, assuming bridging or brokering roles, and community alliances and partnerships (Feola and Nunes, 2014; 
Mehmood, 2016; Taylor Aiken, 2016; Grossmann and Creamer, 2017). Smaller scale rural initiatives allow for more experimentation

474
(Cretney et al., 2016), while those in urban centres benefit from stronger networks and proximity to power structures (North and 
Longhurst, 2013; Nicolosi and Feola, 2016). Increasingly, TTs recognize the need to participate in policymaking (Kenis and Mathijs, 
2014; Barnes, 2015).
Despite high self-ratings of success, some TT initiatives are too inwardly focused and geographically isolated (Feola and Nunes, 
2014), while others have difficulties in engaging marginalized, non-white, non-middle-class community members (Evans and 
Phelan, 2016; Nicolosi and Feola, 2016; Grossmann and Creamer, 2017). In the United Kingdom, expectations of innovations 
growing in scale (Taylor Aiken, 2015) and carbon accounting methods required by funding bodies (Taylor Aiken, 2016) 
undermine local resilience building. Tension between explicit engagements with climate change action and efforts to appeal 
to more people have resulted in difficult trade-offs and strained member relations (Grossmann and Creamer, 2017) though the 
contribution to changing an urban culture that prioritizes climate change is sometimes underestimated (Wiktorowicz et al., 2018). 
 
Urban actions that can highlight the 1.5°C agenda include individual actions within homes (Werfel, 2017; Buntaine and Prather, 
2018); demonstration zero carbon developments (Wiktorowicz et al., 2018); new partnerships between communities, government 
and business to build mass transit and electrify transport (Glazebrook and Newman, 2018); city plans to include climate outcomes 
(Millard-Ball, 2013); and support for transformative change across political, professional and sectoral divides (Bai et al., 2018).

Conditions for Achieving Sustainable 
Development, Eradicating Poverty 
and Reducing Inequalities in 
1.5°C Warmer Worlds
This chapter has described the fundamental, urgent and systemic 
transformations that would be needed to achieve sustainable 
development, eradicate poverty and reduce inequalities in a 1.5°C 
warmer world, in various contexts and across scales. In particular, it 
has highlighted the societal dimensions, putting at the centre people’s 
needs and aspirations in their specific contexts. Here we synthesize 
some of the most pertinent enabling conditions (see Glossary) to 
support these profound transformations. These conditions are closely 
interlinked and connected by the overarching concept of governance, 
which broadly includes institutional, socio-economic, cultural and 
technological elements (see Chapter 1, Cross-Chapter Box 4 in 
Chapter 1).
5.6.1 
Finance and Technology Aligned with Local Needs
Significant gaps in green investment constrain transitions to a low-
carbon economy aligned with development objectives (Volz et al., 
2015; Campiglio, 2016). Hence, unlocking new forms of public, private 
and public–private financing is essential to support environmental 
sustainability of the economic system (Croce et al., 2011; Blyth et al., 
2015; Falcone et al., 2018) (see Chapter 4, Section 4.4.5). To avoid risks 
of undesirable trade-offs with the SDGs caused by national budget 
constraints, improved access to international climate finance is essential 
for supporting adaptation, mitigation and sustainable development, 
especially for LDCs and SIDS (medium evidence, high agreement) 
(Shine and Campillo, 2016; Wood, 2017). Care needs to be taken when 
international donors or partnership arrangements influence project 
financing structures (Kongsager and Corbera, 2015; Purdon, 2015; 
Phillips et al., 2017; Ficklin et al., 2018). Conventional climate funding 
schemes, especially the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), have 
shown positive effects on sustainable development but also adverse 
consequences, for example, on adaptive capacities of rural households 
and uneven distribution of costs and benefits, often exacerbating 
inequalities (robust evidence, high agreement) (Aggarwal, 2014; 
Brohé, 2014; He et al., 2014; Schade and Obergassel, 2014; Smits and 
Middleton, 2014; Wood et al., 2016a; Horstmann and Hein, 2017; 
Kreibich et al., 2017). Close consideration of recipients’ context-
specific needs when designing financial support helps to overcome 
these limitations as it better aligns community needs, national policy 
objectives and donors’ priorities; puts the emphasis on the increase of 
transparency and predictability of support; and fosters local capacity 
building (medium evidence, high agreement) (Barrett, 2013; Boyle et 
al., 2013; Shine and Campillo, 2016; Ley, 2017; Sánchez and Izzo, 2017).
The development and transfer of technologies is another enabler for 
developing countries to contribute to the requirements of the 1.5°C 
objective while achieving climate resilience and their socio-economic 
development goals (see Chapter 4, Section 4.4.4). International-
level governance would be needed to boost domestic innovation 
and the deployment of new technologies, such as negative emission 
technologies, towards the 1.5°C objective (see Chapter 4, Section 4.3.7), 
but the alignment with local needs depends on close consideration 
of the specificities of the domestic context in countries at all levels 
of development (de Coninck and Sagar, 2015; IEA, 2015; Parikh et al., 
2018). Technology transfer supporting development in developing 
countries would require an understanding of local and national actors 
and institutions (de Coninck and Puig, 2015; de Coninck and Sagar, 
2017; Michaelowa et al., 2018), careful attention to the capacities in 
the entire innovation chain (Khosla et al., 2017; Olawuyi, 2017) and 
transfer of not only equipment but also knowledge (medium evidence, 
high agreement) (Murphy et al., 2015).
5.6.2 
Integration of Institutions 
Multilevel governance in climate change has emerged as a key enabler 
for systemic transformation and effective governance (see Chapter 4, 
Sustainable Development, Poverty Eradication and Reducing Inequalities 
Chapter 5
5
475
Section 4.4.1). On the one hand, low-carbon and climate-resilient 
development actions are often well aligned at the lowest scale 
possible (Suckall et al., 2015; Sánchez and Izzo, 2017), and informal, 
local institutions are critical in enhancing the adaptive capacity 
of countries and marginalized communities (Yaro et al., 2015). On 
the other hand, international and national institutions can provide 
incentives for projects to harness synergies and avoid trade-offs 
(Kongsager et al., 2016).
Governance approaches that coordinate and monitor multiscale 
policy actions and trade-offs across sectoral, local, national, regional 
and international levels are therefore best suited to implement goals 
towards 1.5°C warmer conditions and sustainable development (Ayers 
et al., 2014; Stringer et al., 2014; von Stechow et al., 2016; Gwimbi, 
2017; Hayward, 2017; Maor et al., 2017; Roger et al., 2017; Michaelowa 
et al., 2018). Vertical and horizontal policy integration and coordination 
is essential to take into account the interplay and trade-offs between 
sectors and spatial scales (Duguma et al., 2014; Naess et al., 2015; von 
Stechow et al., 2015; Antwi-Agyei et al., 2017a; Di Gregorio et al., 2017; 
Runhaar et al., 2018), enable the dialogue between local communities 
and institutional bodies (Colenbrander et al., 2016), and involve non-
state actors such as business, local governments and civil society 
operating across different scales (robust evidence, high agreement) 
(Hajer et al., 2015; Labriet et al., 2015; Hale, 2016; Pelling et al., 2016; 
Kalafatis, 2017; Lyon, 2018).
5.6.3 
Inclusive Processes
Inclusive governance processes are critical for preparing for a 1.5°C 
warmer world (Fazey et al., 2018; O’Brien, 2018; Patterson et al., 2018). 
These processes have been shown to serve the interests of diverse 
groups of people and enhance empowerment of often excluded 
stakeholders, notably women and youth (MRFCJ, 2015a; Dumont et 
al., 2017). They also enhance social- and co-learning which, in turn, 
facilitates accelerated and adaptive management and the scaling up 
of capacities for resilience building (Ensor and Harvey, 2015; Reij and 
Winterbottom, 2015; Tschakert et al., 2016; Binam et al., 2017; Dumont 
et al., 2017; Fazey et al., 2018; Lyon, 2018; O’Brien, 2018), and provides 
opportunities to blend indigenous, local and scientific knowledge 
(robust evidence, high agreement) (see Chapter 4, Section 4.3.5.5, 
Box 4.3, Section 5.3) (Antwi-Agyei et al., 2017a; Coe et al., 2017; 
Thornton and Comberti, 2017) . Such co-learning has been effective 
in improving deliberative decision-making processes that incorporate 
different values and world views (Cundill et al., 2014; C. Butler et al., 
2016; Ensor, 2016; Fazey et al., 2016; Gorddard et al., 2016; Aipira et 
al., 2017; Chung Tiam Fook, 2017; Maor et al., 2017), and create space 
for negotiating diverse interests and preferences (robust evidence, high 
agreement) (O’Brien et al., 2015; Gillard et al., 2016; DeCaro et al., 
2017; Harris et al., 2017; Lahn, 2018).
5.6.4 
Attention to Issues of Power and Inequality 
Societal transformations to limit global warming to 1.5°C and strive 
for equity and well-being for all are not power neutral (Section 5.5.3). 
Development preferences are often shaped by powerful interests that 
determine the direction and pace of change, anticipated benefits and 
beneficiaries, and acceptable and unacceptable trade-offs (Newell et 
al., 2014; Fazey et al., 2016; Tschakert et al., 2016; Winkler and Dubash, 
2016; Wood et al., 2016b; Karlsson et al., 2017; Quan et al., 2017; 
Tanner et al., 2017). Each development pathway, including legacies and 
path dependencies, creates its own set of opportunities and challenges 
and winners and losers, both within and across countries (Figure 5.5) 
(robust evidence, high agreement) (Mathur et al., 2014; Phillips et al., 
2017; Stringer et al., 2017; Wood, 2017; Ficklin et al., 2018; Gajjar et 
al., 2018).
Addressing the uneven distribution of power is critical to ensure 
that societal transformation towards a 1.5°C warmer world does 
not exacerbate poverty and vulnerability or create new injustices but 
rather encourages equitable transformational change (Patterson et 
al., 2018). Equitable outcomes are enhanced when they pay attention 
to just outcomes for those negatively affected by change (Newell et 
al., 2014; Dilling et al., 2015; Naess et al., 2015; Sovacool et al., 2015; 
Cervigni and Morris, 2016; Keohane and Victor, 2016) and promote 
human rights, increase equality and reduce power asymmetries within 
societies (robust evidence, high agreement) (UNRISD, 2016; Robinson 
and Shine, 2018).
5.6.5 
Reconsidering Values 
The profound transformations that would be needed to integrate 
sustainable development and 1.5°C-compatible pathways call for 
examining the values, ethics, attitudes and behaviours that underpin 
societies (Hartzell-Nichols, 2017; O’Brien, 2018; Patterson et al., 2018). 
Infusing values that promote sustainable development (Holden et al., 
2017), overcome individual economic interests and go beyond economic 
growth (Hackmann, 2016), encourage desirable and transformative 
visions (Tàbara et al., 2018), and care for the less fortunate (Howell 
and Allen, 2017) is part and parcel of climate-resilient and sustainable 
development pathways. This entails helping societies and individuals 
to strive for sufficiency in resource consumption within planetary 
boundaries alongside sustainable and equitable well-being (O’Neill 
et al., 2018). Navigating 1.5°C societal transformations, characterized 
by action from local to global, stresses the core commitment to 
social justice, solidarity and cooperation, particularly regarding the 
distribution of responsibilities, rights and mutual obligations between 
nations (medium evidence, high agreement) (Patterson et al., 2018; 
Robinson and Shine, 2018).
5.7 
Synthesis and Research Gaps
The assessment in Chapter 5 illustrates that limiting global warming 
to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels is fundamentally connected with 
achieving sustainable development, poverty eradication and reducing 
inequalities. It shows that avoided impacts between 1.5°C and 2°C 
temperature stabilization would make it easier to achieve many aspects 
of sustainable development, although important risks would remain 
at 1.5°C (Section 5.2). Synergies between adaptation and mitigation 
response measures with sustainable development and the SDGs can 
often be enhanced when attention is paid to well-being and equity 
while, when unaddressed, poverty and inequalities may be exacerbated 
(Section 5.3 and 5.4). Climate-resilient development pathways (CRDPs)

open up routes towards socially desirable futures that are sustainable 
and liveable, but concrete evidence reveals complex trade-offs along 
a continuum of different pathways, highlighting the role of societal 
values, internal contestations and political dynamics (Section 5.5). The 
transformations towards sustainable development in a 1.5°C warmer 
world, in all contexts, involve fundamental societal and systemic 
changes over time and across scale, and a set of enabling conditions 
without which the dual goal is difficult if not impossible to achieve 
(Sections 5.5 and 5.6).
This assessment is supported by growing knowledge on the linkages 
between a 1.5°C warmer world and different dimensions of sustainable 
development. However, several gaps in the literature remain:
Limited evidence exists that explicitly examines the real-world 
implications of a 1.5°C warmer world (and overshoots) as well as 
avoided impacts between 1.5°C versus 2°C for the SDGs and sustainable 
development more broadly. Few projections are available for 
households, livelihoods and communities. And literature on differential 
localized impacts and their cross-sector interacting and cascading 
effects with multidimensional patterns of societal vulnerability, poverty 
and inequalities remains scarce. Hence, caution is needed when global-
level conclusions about adaptation and mitigation measures in a 1.5°C 
warmer world are applied to sustainable development in local, national 
and regional settings.
Limited literature has systematically evaluated context-specific 
synergies and trade-offs between and across adaptation and mitigation 
response measures in 1.5°C-compatible pathways and the SDGs. This 
hampers the ability to inform decision-making and fair and robust policy 
packages adapted to different local, regional or national circumstances. 
More research is required to understand how trade-offs and synergies 
will intensify or decrease, differentially across geographic regions and 
time, in a 1.5°C warmer world and as compared to higher temperatures.
Limited availability of interdisciplinary studies also poses a challenge 
for connecting the socio-economic transformations and the governance 
aspects of low emissions, climate-resilient transformations. For 
example, it remains unclear how governance structures enable or 
hinder different groups of people and countries to negotiate pathway 
options, values and priorities.
The literature does not demonstrate the existence of 1.5°C-compatible 
pathways achieving the ‘universal and indivisible’ agenda of the 
17 SDGs, and hence does not show whether and how the nature 
and pace of changes that would be required to meet 1.5°C climate 
stabilization could be fully synergetic with all the SDGs.
The literature on low emissions and CRDPs in local, regional and national 
contexts is growing. Yet the lack of standard indicators to monitor such 
pathways makes it difficult to compare evidence grounded in specific 
contexts with differential circumstances, and therefore to derive 
generic lessons on the outcome of decisions on specific indicators. This 
knowledge gap poses a challenge for connecting local-level visions 
with global-level trajectories to better understand key conditions for 
societal and systems transformations that reconcile urgent climate 
action with well-being for all.

FAQ 5.1 | What are the Connections between Sustainable Development and Limiting Global  
 
Warming to 1.5°C above Pre-Industrial Levels?
Summary: Sustainable development seeks to meet the needs of people living today without compromising the 
needs of future generations, while balancing social, economic and environmental considerations. The 17 UN 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) include targets for eradicating poverty; ensuring health, energy and food 
security; reducing inequality; protecting ecosystems; pursuing sustainable cities and economies; and a goal for 
climate action (SDG 13). Climate change affects the ability to achieve sustainable development goals, and limiting 
warming to 1.5°C will help meet some sustainable development targets. Pursuing sustainable development will 
influence emissions, impacts and vulnerabilities. Responses to climate change in the form of adaptation and 
mitigation will also interact with sustainable development with positive effects, known as synergies, or negative 
effects, known as trade-offs. Responses to climate change can be planned to maximize synergies and limit trade-
offs with sustainable development.
For more than 25 years, the United Nations (UN) and other international organizations have embraced the 
concept of sustainable development to promote well-being and meet the needs of today’s population without 
compromising the needs of future generations. This concept spans economic, social and environmental objectives 
including poverty and hunger alleviation, equitable economic growth, access to resources, and the protection of 
water, air and ecosystems. Between 1990 and 2015, the UN monitored a set of eight Millennium Development 
Goals (MDGs). They reported progress in reducing poverty, easing hunger and child mortality, and improving 
access to clean water and sanitation. But with millions remaining in poor health, living in poverty and facing 
serious problems associated with climate change, pollution and land-use change, the UN decided that more 
needed to be done. In 2015, the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were endorsed as part of the 2030 
Agenda for Sustainable Development. The 17 SDGs (Figure FAQ 5.1) apply to all countries and have a timeline 
for success by 2030. The SDGs seek to eliminate extreme poverty and hunger; ensure health, education, peace, 
safe water and clean energy for all; promote inclusive and sustainable consumption, cities, infrastructure and 
economic growth; reduce inequality including gender inequality; combat climate change and protect oceans and 
terrestrial ecosystems.
Climate change and sustainable development are fundamentally connected. Previous IPCC reports found that 
climate change can undermine sustainable development, and that well-designed mitigation and adaptation 
responses can support poverty alleviation, food security, healthy ecosystems, equality and other dimensions of 
sustainable development. Limiting global warming to 1.5°C would require mitigation actions and adaptation 
measures to be taken at all levels. These adaptation and mitigation actions would include reducing emissions and 
increasing resilience through technology and infrastructure choices, as well as changing behaviour and policy. 
 
 
These actions can interact with sustainable development objectives in positive ways that strengthen sustainable 
development, known as synergies. Or they can interact in negative ways, where sustainable development is 
hindered or reversed, known as trade-offs.
An example of a synergy is sustainable forest management, which can prevent emissions from deforestation 
and take up carbon to reduce warming at reasonable cost. It can work synergistically with other dimensions of 
sustainable development by providing food (SDG 2) and clean water (SDG 6) and protecting ecosystems (SDG 15). 
Other examples of synergies are when climate adaptation measures, such as coastal or agricultural projects, 
empower women and benefit local incomes, health and ecosystems.
An example of a trade-off can occur if ambitious climate change mitigation compatible with 1.5°C changes 
land use in ways that have negative impacts on sustainable development. An example could be turning natural 
forests, agricultural areas, or land under indigenous or local ownership to plantations for bioenergy production. 
If not managed carefully, such changes could undermine dimensions of sustainable development by threatening 
food and water security, creating conflict over land rights and causing biodiversity loss. Another trade-off could 
occur for some countries, assets, workers and infrastructure already in place if a switch is made from fossil fuels to 
other energy sources without adequate planning for such a transition. Trade-offs can be minimized if effectively 
managed, as when care is taken to improve bioenergy crop yields to reduce harmful land-use change or where 
workers are retrained for employment in lower carbon sectors.

FAQ 5.1 (continued) 
Limiting temperature increase to 1.5°C can make it much easier to achieve the SDGs, but it is also possible that 
pursuing the SDGs could result in trade-offs with efforts to limit climate change. There are trade-offs when 
people escaping from poverty and hunger consume more energy or land and thus increase emissions, or if 
goals for economic growth and industrialization increase fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. 
Conversely, efforts to reduce poverty and gender inequalities and to enhance food, health and water security can 
reduce vulnerability to climate change. Other synergies can occur when coastal and ocean ecosystem protection 
reduces the impacts of climate change on these systems. The sustainable development goal of affordable and 
clean energy (SDG 7) specifically targets access to renewable energy and energy efficiency, which are important 
to ambitious mitigation and limiting warming to 1.5°C.
The link between sustainable development and limiting global warming to 1.5°C is recognized by the SDG for 
climate action (SDG 13), which seeks to combat climate change and its impacts while acknowledging that the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is the primary international, intergovernmental 
forum for negotiating the global response to climate change.
The challenge is to put in place sustainable development policies and actions that reduce deprivation, alleviate 
poverty and ease ecosystem degradation while also lowering emissions, reducing climate change impacts and 
facilitating adaptation. It is important to strengthen synergies and minimize trade-offs when planning climate 
change adaptation and mitigation actions. Unfortunately, not all trade-offs can be avoided or minimized, but 
careful planning and implementation can build the enabling conditions for long-term sustainable development.
FAQ 5.1, Figure 1 |  Climate change action is one of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and is connected to sustainable development 
more broadly. Actions to reduce climate risk can interact with other sustainable development objectives in positive ways (synergies) and negative ways (trade-offs).

Frequently Asked Questions 
FAQ 5.2 | What are the Pathways to Achieving Poverty Reduction and Reducing Inequalities  
 
while Reaching a 1.5°C World?
Summary: There are ways to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Of the pathways that 
exist, some simultaneously achieve sustainable development. They entail a mix of measures that lower emissions 
and reduce the impacts of climate change, while contributing to poverty eradication and reducing inequalities. 
Which pathways are possible and desirable will differ between and within regions and nations. This is due to 
the fact that development progress to date has been uneven and climate-related risks are unevenly distributed. 
Flexible governance would be needed to ensure that such pathways are inclusive, fair and equitable to avoid 
poor and disadvantaged populations becoming worse off. Climate-resilient development pathways (CRDPs) offer 
possibilities to achieve both equitable and low-carbon futures.
Issues of equity and fairness have long been central to climate change and sustainable development. Equity, 
like equality, aims to promote justness and fairness for all. This is not necessarily the same as treating everyone 
equally, since not everyone comes from the same starting point. Often used interchangeably with fairness and 
justice, equity implies implementing different actions in different places, all with a view to creating an equal 
world that is fair for all and where no one is left behind.
The Paris Agreement states that it ‘will be implemented to reflect equity… in the light of different national 
circumstances’ and calls for ‘rapid reductions’ of greenhouse gases to be achieved ‘on the basis of equity, and in 
the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty’. Similarly, the UN SDGs include targets 
to reduce poverty and inequalities, and to ensure equitable and affordable access to health, water and energy 
for all.
Equity and fairness are important for considering pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C in a way that is liveable 
for every person and species. They recognize the uneven development status between richer and poorer nations, 
the uneven distribution of climate impacts (including on future generations) and the uneven capacity of different 
nations and people to respond to climate risks. This is particularly true for those who are highly vulnerable to 
climate change, such as indigenous communities in the Arctic, people whose livelihoods depend on agriculture 
or coastal and marine ecosystems, and inhabitants of small island developing states. The poorest people will 
continue to experience climate change through the loss of income and livelihood opportunities, hunger, adverse 
health effects and displacement.
Well-planned adaptation and mitigation measures are essential to avoid exacerbating inequalities or creating 
new injustices. Pathways that are compatible with limiting warming to 1.5°C and aligned with the SDGs consider 
mitigation and adaptation options that reduce inequalities in terms of who benefits, who pays the costs and who 
is affected by possible negative consequences. Attention to equity ensures that disadvantaged people can secure 
their livelihoods and live in dignity, and that those who experience mitigation or adaptation costs have financial 
and technical support to enable fair transitions.
CRDPs describe trajectories that pursue the dual goal of limiting warming to 1.5°C while strengthening sustainable 
development. This includes eradicating poverty as well as reducing vulnerabilities and inequalities for regions, 
countries, communities, businesses and cities. These trajectories entail a mix of adaptation and mitigation 
measures consistent with profound societal and systems transformations. The goals are to meet the short-term 
SDGs, achieve longer-term sustainable development, reduce emissions towards net zero around the middle of 
the century, build resilience and enhance human capacities to adapt, all while paying close attention to equity 
and well-being for all.
The characteristics of CRDPs will differ across communities and nations, and will be based on deliberations with 
a diverse range of people, including those most affected by climate change and by possible routes towards 
transformation. For this reason, there are no standard methods for designing CRDPs or for monitoring their 
progress towards climate-resilient futures. However, examples from around the world demonstrate that flexible 
and inclusive governance structures and broad participation often help support iterative decision-making, 
continuous learning and experimentation. Such inclusive processes can also help to overcome weak institutional 
arrangements and power structures that may further exacerbate inequalities.

FAQ 5.2 (continued)
Ambitious actions already underway around the world can offer insight into CRDPs for limiting warming to 1.5°C. 
For example, some countries have adopted clean energy and sustainable transport while creating environmentally 
friendly jobs and supporting social welfare programmes to reduce domestic poverty. Other examples teach us 
about different ways to promote development through practices inspired by community values. For instance, 
Buen Vivir, a Latin American concept based on indigenous ideas of communities living in harmony with nature, 
is aligned with peace; diversity; solidarity; rights to education, health, and safe food, water, and energy; and 
well-being and justice for all. The Transition Movement, with origins in Europe, promotes equitable and resilient 
communities through low-carbon living, food self-sufficiency and citizen science. Such examples indicate that 
pathways that reduce poverty and inequalities while limiting warming to 1.5°C are possible and that they can 
provide guidance on pathways towards socially desirable, equitable and low-carbon futures.
FAQ 5.2, Figure 1 |  Climate-resilient development pathways (CRDPs) describe trajectories that pursue the dual goals of limiting warming to 1.5°C while 
strengthening sustainable development. Decision-making that achieves the SDGs, lowers greenhouse gas emissions and limits global warming could help lead to 
a climate-resilient world, within the context of enhancing adaptation.

Access to modern energy forms (electricity, clean stoves, high-quality 
lighting) is fundamental to human development since the energy 
services made possible by them help alleviate chronic and persistent 
poverty. Strength of the impact varies in the literature. (Quote from 
McCollum et al., 2018)
Modern energy access is critical to enhance agricultural 
yields/productivity, decrease post-harvest losses and mechanize agri-
processing – all of which can aid food security. However, large-scale 
bioenergy and food production may compete for scarce land and other 
inputs (e.g., water, fertilizers), depending on how and where biomass 
supplies are grown and the indirect land use change impacts that result. 
If not implemented thoughtfully, this could lead to higher food prices 
globally, and thus reduce access to affordable food for the poor. 
Enhanced agricultural productivities can ameliorate the situation by 
allowing as much bioenergy to be produced on as little land as possible.
Access to modern energy services can contribute to fewer injuries and 
diseases related to traditional solid fuel collection and burning, as well 
as utilization of kerosene lanterns. Access to modern energy services 
can facilitate improved health care provision, medicine and vaccine 
storage, utilization of powered medical equipment, and dissemination of 
health-related information and education. Such services can also enable 
thermal comfort in homes and contribute to food preservation and 
safety. (Quote from McCollum et al., 2018)
Access to modern energy is necessary for schools to have quality 
lighting and thermal comfort, as well as modern information and 
communication technologies. Access to modern lighting and energy 
allows for studying after sundown and frees constraints on time 
management that allow for higher school enrolment rates and better 
literacy outcomes. (Quote from McCollum et al., 2018)

Equal Access to Educational Institutions (4.1/4.2/4.3/4.5)
Energy efficiency interventions lead to cost savings which are realized 
due to reduced energy bills that further lead to poverty reduction. 
Participants with low incomes experience greater benefits. 'Energy 
efficiency and biomass strategies benefitted the poor more than wind 
and solar, whose benefits are captured by industry. Carbon mitigation 
can increase or decrease inequalities. The distributional costs of new 
energy policies (e.g., supporting renewables and energy efficiency) are 
dependent on instrument design. If costs fall disproportionately on the 
poor, then this could impair progress towards universal energy access 
and, by extension, counteract the fight to eliminate poverty. (Quote from 
McCollum et al., 2018).
Using the improved stoves supports local food security and has 
significantly impacted on food security. By making fuel last longer, the 
improved stoves help improve food security and also provide a better 
buffer against fuel shortages induced by climate change-related events 
such as droughts, floods or hurricanes (Berrueta et al. 2017).
Efficient stoves improve health, especially for indigenous and poor rural 
communities. Household energy efficiency has positive health impacts 
on children’s respiratory health, weight and susceptibility to illness, and 
the mental health of adults. Household energy efficiency improves 
winter warmth, lowers relative humidity with benefits for cardiovascular 
and respiratory health. Further improved indoor air quality by thermal 
regulation and occupant comfort are realised. However, in one instance, 
negative health impacts (asthma) of increased household energy 
efficiency were also noted when housing upgrades took place without 
changes in occupant behaviours. Home occupants reported warmth as 
the most important aspect of comfort which was largely temperature-
related and low in energy costs. Residents living in the deprived areas 
expect improved warmth in their properties after energy efficiency 
measures are employed.
Household energy efficiency measures reduce school absences for 
children with asthma due to indoor pollution.

Equal Right to Economic Resources Access Basic Services 
(1.1/1.4/1.a/1.b)
The costs of daily mobility can have important economic stress impacts, 
not only impacting carless families with low-mobility, but in countries 
with high
levels of car dependence, the costs of motoring can be burdensome,
raising questions of affordability for households with limited economic
resources. During economic crisis, public transport authorities may react 
by reducing levels of service and increasing fares, likely exacerbating the 
situation for low-income households.
Dodson et al., 2004; Cascajo et al., 2017
Decarbonization of public buses in Sweden is receiving attention more 
than efficiency improvement. With more electrification, electricity prices 
go up and affordability can worsen for the poor unless redistributive 
policies are in place.
Xylia and Silveira, 2017
Locally relevant policies targeting traffic reductions and ambitious 
diffusion of electric vehicles results in measured changes in non-climatic 
exposure for population, including ambient air pollution, physical 
activity and noise. The transition to low-carbon equitable and 
sustainable transport can be fostered by numerous short- and medium-
term strategies that would benefit energy security, health, productivity 
and sustainability. An evidence-based approach that takes into account 
GHG emissions, ambient air pollutants, economic factors (affordability, 
cost optimization), social factors (poverty alleviations, public health 
benefits) and political acceptability is needed to tackle these challenges.

Road Traffic Accidents (3.4/3.6)
Active travel modes, such as walking and cycling, represent strategies 
not only for boosting energy efficiency but also, potentially, for 
improving health and well-being (e.g., lowering rates of diabetes, 
obesity, heart disease, dementia and some cancers). However, a risk 
associated with these measures is that they could increase rates of road 
traffic accidents, if the existing infrastructure is unsatisfactory. Overall 
health effects will depend on the severity of the injuries sustained from 
these potential accidents relative to the health benefits accruing from 
increased exercise (McCollum et al., 2018).
Ensure Access to Safe Nutritious Food (2.1/2.2) 
Low-income community residents (non-white) who lack local access to 
affordable, quality sources of nutrition have to travel outside their 
immediate neighbourhood to find better sources of food to feed 
themselves and their families. Lack of locally available healthy food 
often exacerbates the rates of obesity in many of these communities 
since it is often difficult or expensive to travel long distances on a 
regular basis to shop for food.

Reduce Illnesses from Hazardous Air Pollution (3.9)
Increasingly volatile global oil prices have raised concerns for the 
vulnerability of households to fuel price increases. Pricing measures as a 
key component of sustainable transport policy need to consider equity. 
Pro-poor mitigation policies are needed to reduce climate impact and 
reduce threat; for example, investing more and better in infrastructure 
by leveraging private resources and using designs that account for 
future climate change and the related uncertainty. Communities in poor 
areas cope with and adapt to multiple-stressors including climate 
change. Coping strategies provide short-term relief but in the long-term 
may negatively affect development goals. And responses generate a 
trade-off between adaptation, mitigation and development. For African 
cities with slums, due to high commuting costs, many walk to work 
places which limit access. In Latin America triple informality leading to 
low productivity and living standards.
21 projects aiming at resilient transport infrastructure development to 
improve access (e.g., C40 Cities Clean Bus Declaration, UITP Declaration 
on Climate Leadership, Cycling Delivers on the Global Goals, Global 
Sidewalk Challenge) do not substantially contribute to realizing the 
(indirect) transport targets with mostly a rural focus: agricultural 
productivity (SDG 2) and access to safe drinking water (SDG 6).
Projects aiming at resilient transport infrastructure development (e.g., 
C40 Cities Clean Bus Declaration, UITP Declaration on Climate 
Leadership, Cycling Delivers on the Global Goals, Global Sidewalk 
Challenge) are targeted at reducing air pollution; electric vehicles using 
electricity from renewables or low carbon sources combined with e-
mobility options such as trolley buses, metros, trams and electro buses, 
as well as promoting walking and biking, especially for short distances, 
need consideration.

Poor road quality affects school travel safety, so collaborative efforts

the traffic problems that children currently face walking to school, and 
then to better situate schools and control the roadways and land uses 
around them in the future.

Poverty and Development (1.1/1.2/1.3/1.4)
Deployment of renewable energy and improvements in energy efficiency 
globally will aid climate change mitigation efforts, and this, in turn, can 
help to reduce the exposure of the world’s poor to climate-related 
extreme events, negative health impacts and other environmental 
shocks (McCollum et al., 2018).
Promoting most types of renewables and boosting efficiency greatly aids 
the achievement of targets to reduce local air pollution and improve air 
quality; however, the order of magnitude of the effects, both in terms of 
avoided emissions and monetary valuation, varies significantly between 
different parts of the world. Benefits would especially accrue to those 
living in the dense urban centres of rapidly developing countries. 
Utilization of biomass and biofuels might not lead to any air pollution 
benefits, however, depending on the control measures applied. In 
addition, household air quality can be significantly improved through 
lowered particulate emissions from access to modern energy services 
(McCollum et al., 2018).
Decentralized renewable energy systems (e.g., home- or village-scale 
solar power) can support education and vocational training.

Large-scale bioenergy production could lead to the creation of 
agricultural jobs, as well as higher farm wages and more diversified 
income streams for farmers. Modern energy access can make marginal 
lands more cultivable, thus potentially generating on-farm jobs and 
incomes; on the other hand, greater farm mechanization can also 
displace labour. However, large-scale bioenergy production could alter 
the structure of global agricultural markets in a way that is, potentially, 
unfavourable to small-scale food producers. See SDG2 (McCollum et al., 
2018).

Replacing coal by biomass can reduce adverse impacts of upstream 
supply-chain activities, in particular local air and water pollution, and 
prevent coal mining accidents. Improvements to local air pollution in 
power generation compared to coal-fired power plants depend on the 
technology and fuel of biomass power plants, but could be significant 
when switching from outdated coal combustion technologies to state-of-
the-art biogas power generation.

Replacing Coal
Disease and Mortality (3.1/3.2/3.3/3.4)
The use of fossil CCS implies continued adverse impacts of upstream 
supply-chain activities in the coal sector, and because of lower efficiency 
of CCS coal power plants, upstream impacts and local air pollution are 
likely to be exacerbated. Furthermore, there is a non-negligible risk of 
CO2 leakage from geological storage or the CO2 transport infrastructure 
from source to sequestration location.

et al., 2010; Koornneef et al., 2011; Singh et al., 2011; Siirila et al., 
2012; Atchley et al., 2013; Corsten et al., 2013; IPCC, 2014
See effects of increased bioenergy use.
See increased use of biomass effects. In addition, the concern that more 
bioenergy (for BECCS) necessarily leads to unacceptably high food prices 
is not founded on large agreement in the literature. AR5, for example, 
finds a significantly lower effect of large-scale bioenergy deployment on 
food prices by mid-century than the effect of climate change on crop 
yields. Also, Muratori et al. (2016) show that BECCS reduces the upward 
pressure on food crop prices by lowering carbon prices and lowering the 
total biomass demand in climate change mitigation scenarios. On the 
other hand, competition for land use may increase food prices and 
thereby increase risk of hunger. Use of agricultural residue for bioenergy 
can reduce soil carbon, thereby threatening agricultural productivity.
See positive impacts of increased biomass use. At the same time, there 
is a non-negligible risk of CO2 leakage both from geological formations 
as well as from the transportation infrastructure from source to 
sequestration locations.

Disease and Mortality (3.1/3.2/3.3/3.4)
In spite of the industry's overall safety track record, a non-negligible risk 
for accidents in nuclear power plants and waste treatment facilities 
remains. The long-term storage of nuclear waste is a politically fraught 
subject, with no large-scale long-term storage operational worldwide. 
Negative impacts from upstream uranium mining and milling are 
comparable to those of coal, hence replacing fossil fuel combustion by 
nuclear power would be neutral in that aspect. Increased occurrence of 
childhood leukaemia in populations living within 5 km of nuclear power 
plants was identified by some studies, even though a direct causal 
relation to ionizing radiation could not be established and other studies 
could not confirm any correlation (low evidence/agreement on this 
issue).

Greenhouse Gas Reduction from Improved Livestock 
Production and Manure Management Systems
Many CSA interventions aim to improve rural livelihoods, thereby 
contributing to poverty alleviation. Agroforestry or integrated 
crop–livestock–biogas systems can substitute costly, external inputs, 
saving on household expenditures – or even lead to the selling of some 
of the products, providing the farmer with extra income, leading to 
increased adaptive capacity (Bogdanski, 2012).

Cutting livestock consumption can increase food security for some if 
land grows food not feed, but can also undermine livelihoods and 
culture where livestock has long been the best use of land, such as in 
parts of Sub-Saharan Africa.
Curbing consumer waste of major food crops (i.e., wheat, rice and 
vegetables) and meats (i.e., beef, pork and poultry) in China, USA and 
India alone could feed ~413 million people per year (West et al., 2014). 
One billion extra people could be fed if food crop losses could be halved 
(Kummu et al., 2012). Reducing waste, especially from meat and dairy, 
could play a role in delivering food security and reduce the need for 
sustainable intensification (Smith, 2013). Dietary change toward global 
healthy diets could improve nutritional health, food security and reduce 
emissions.
Consume fewer foods with low nutritional value, e.g., alcohol (Garnett, 
2011). Demand-side measures aimed at reducing the proportion of 
livestock products in human diets, where the consumption of animal 
products is higher than recommended, are associated with multiple 
health benefits, especially in industrialized countries (Bustamante et al., 
2014).

With mixed-farming systems farmers can not only mitigate risks by 
producing a multitude of commodities, but they can also increase the 
productivity of both crops and animals in a more profitable and 
sustainable way.
Fostering transitions towards more productive livestock production 
systems targeting land-use change appears to be the most efficient lever 
to deliver food availability outcomes.  Genomic selection should be able 
to at least double the rate of genetic gain in the dairy industry. Given 
the prevalence of mixed crop–livestock systems in many parts of the 
world, closer integration of crops and livestock in such systems can give 
rise to increased productivity and increased soil fertility (Thornton, 
2010). Managing the indirect effects of livestock systems intensification 
is critical for the sustainability of the global food system: such as 
improving productivity and the close link to land sparing (Herrero and 
Thornton,  2013). In East Africa pastoralists have shifted from cows to 
camels, which are better adapted to survive periods of water scarcity 
and able to consistently provide more milk  (Steenwerth et al., 2014). 
Scenarios where zero human-edible concentrate feed is used for 
livestock, soil erosion potential reduces by 12%.
Biodigestion, which has positive public health aspects, particularly 
where toilets are coupled with the biodigester; anaerobic conditions kill 
pathogenic organisms as well as digestive toxins. Separation processes 
can improve or worsen health risks related to food crops or to livestock.

Ensure Inclusive and Quality Education (4.4/4.7)
Safe application of biotechnology, both conventional and modern 
methods, can help to improve agricultural productivity, improving crop 
adaptability and thereby catering to food security. Reducing tillage, 
eliminating fallow and keeping the soil covered with residue, cover 
crops or perennial vegetation helps prevent soil erosion and has the 
potential to increase soil organic matter. Efficient land-management 
techniques can help in increasing crop yields, and so food security issues 
can be addressed. Yield projections are actually higher for developing 
countries than for developed countries, reflecting the fact that they have 
more 'catch-up' potential (Evenson, 1999). Action is needed throughout 
the food system on moderating demand, reducing waste, improving 
governance and producing more food (Godfray and Garnett, 2014). 
Improving cropland management is the key to increase crop productivity 
without further degrading soil and water resources (Branca et al., 2011). 
CSA practices increase productivity and prioritize food security.
Growing crops such as cassava, sorghum and millet, even in harsh 
conditions, is important to the diets of very poor people. Policy 
scenarios show that reduced research support, delayed industrialization, 
delayed biotechnology and climate change will delay progress in 
reducing childhood malnutrition. The global effects are small, but local 
effects for some countries, e.g., Bangladesh and Nigeria, are significant 
(Evenson, 1999).
Science-based action within CSA is required to integrate data sets and 
sound metrics for testing hypotheses about feedback regarding climate, 
weather data products and agricultural productivity, such as the 
nonlinearity of temperature effects on crop yield and the assessment of 
trade-offs and synergies that arise from different agricultural 
intensification strategies (Steenwerth et al., 2014). Low commodity 
prices have led to declining investment in research and development, 
farmer education, etc. (Lamb et al., 2016).

employment; traditional management systems provide benefits for blue

could help capture the benefits derived from multiple ecosystem services 
beyond carbon sequestration.

Partnerships between local forest managers, community enterprises and 
private sector companies can support local economies and livelihoods, 
and boost regional and national economic growth.
Food security may lead to the conversion of productive land under 
forest, including community forests, into agricultural production. In a 
similar fashion, the production of biomass for energy purposes (SDG 7) 
may reduce land available for food production and/or for community 
forest activities . Efforts by the Government of Zambia to reduce 
emissions by REDD+ have contributed erosion control, ecotourism and 
pollination valued at 2.5% of the country's GDP.
Local forest users learn to understand laws, regulations and policies

Clean Development Mechanism  (CDM) can have different implications 
on local community livelihoods. For example, willingness to adopt 
afforestation is influenced in particular by Australian landholder’s 
perceptions of its potential to provide a diversified income stream, and 
its impacts on flexibility of land management ; land sparing would have 
far reaching implications for the UK countryside and would affect 
landowners and rural communities ; and livelihoods could be threatened 
if subsistence agriculture is targeted .
CDM can have different implications on local to regional food security 
and local  community livelihoods.

Knowledge and Skills Needed to Promote SD (4.7)
There is need for skill in managing in-house energy efficiency. 
Sometimes ESCOs also help. Energy audits, but many times absence of 
skill acts as barrier for energy efficiency improvement. In many 
countries, especially developing countries, these act as barriers.

Global Partnership (17.6/17.7)
A driving force for energy efficiency is collaboration among companies, 
networks, experience sharing and management tools. Sharing among 
countries can help accelerate managerial action. Absence of

innovation investments are happening in brown fields. Such large 
innovation investments need strong collaboration among 
partners/competitors which can be facilitated by public funds. They 
happen at national and supranational scales and across sectors, needs

Enhance Policy Coherence for Sustainable Development 
(17.4)
Implementing refrigerant transition and energy efficiency improvement 
policies in parallel for room ACs, roughly doubles the benefit of either 
policy implemented in isolation.
Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment (5.1/5.4)
Empowerment and Inclusion (10.1/10.2/10.3/10.4)
Environmental Justice (16.7)
Efficient stoves lead to empowerment of rural and indigenous women. 
Energy efficiency measures and the provision of energy access can free 
up resources that can then be put towards other productive uses (e.g., 
educational and employment opportunities), especially for women and 
children in poor, rural areas. The distributional costs of new energy 
policies are dependent on instrument design. If costs fall 
disproportionately on the poor, then this could work against the 
promotion of social, economic and political equality for all. The impacts 
of energy efficiency measures and policies on inequality can be both 
positive, if they reduce energy costs, or negative, if mandatory standards 
increase the need for purchasing more expensive equipment and 
appliances.

The equity impacts of climate change mitigation measures for transport, 
and indeed of transport policy intervention overall, are poorly 
understood by policymakers. This is in large part because standard 
assessment of these impacts is not a statutory requirement of current 
policymaking. Managing transport energy demand growth will have to 
be advanced alongside efforts in passenger travel towards reducing the 
deep inequalities in access to transport services that currently affect the 
poor worldwide. Free provision of roads and parking spaces converts 
vast amounts of public land and capital into under-priced space for cars, 
in extreme cases like Los Angeles, USA, roads and streets free for 
parking and driving are 20% of land area; as governments give drivers 
free land, people drive more than they would otherwise. High levels of 
car dependence and the costs of motoring can be burdensome, and lead 
to increasing debt, raising questions of affordability for households with 
limited resources, particularly low-income houses located in suburban 
areas
With behavioural change towards walking for short distances, 
pedestrian safety on the road might reduce, unless public policy is 
appropriately formulated. Prevalence of high levels of triple forms of 
informality, in jobs, housing and transportation, are responsible for low 
productivity and low standards of living, and are a major challenge for 
policies targeting urban growth in Latin America.
Projects aiming at resilient transport infrastructure development (e.g., 
C40 Cities Clean Bus Declaration, UITP Declaration on Climate 
Leadership, Cycling Delivers on the Global Goals, Global Sidewalk 
Challenge) are happening through multi-stakeholder coalitions.
The  woman's average trip to work differs markedly from the  man's 
average trip. Working-poor women rely on extensive social networks 
creating communities of spatial necessity, bartering for basic needs to 
overcome transportation constraints. Women earn lower wages and so 
are less likely to justify longer commutes. Many women need to manage 
dual roles as workers and mothers. Women tend to perform multi-
purpose commuting, combining both work and household needs .

In transport mitigation it is necessary to conduct needs assessments and 
stakeholder consultation to determine plausible challenges, prior to 
introducing desired planning reforms. Further, the involved personnel 
should actively engage transport-based stakeholders during policy 
identification and its implementation to achieve the desired results. User 
behaviour and stakeholder integration are key for successful transport 
policy implementation.

International Cooperation (All Goals)
International cooperation (in policy) and collaboration (in science) is 
required for the protection of shared resources. Fragmented approaches 
have been shown to be more costly. Specific to SDG7, to achieve the 
targets for energy access, renewables and efficiency, it will be critical 
that all countries: (i) are able to mobilize the necessary financial 
resources (e.g., via taxes on fossil energy, sustainable financing, foreign 
direct investment, financial transfers from industrialized to developing 
countries); (ii) are willing to disseminate knowledge and share 
innovative technologies between each other; (iii) follow recognized 
international trade rules while at the same time ensuring that the least 
developed countries are able to take part in that trade; (iv) respect each 
other’s policy space and decisions; (v) forge new partnerships between 
their public and private entities and within civil society; and (vi) support 
the collection of high-quality, timely and reliable data relevant to 
furthering their missions. There is some disagreement in the literature 
on the effect of some of the above strategies, such as free trade. 
Regarding international agreements, 'no-regrets options', where all 
sides gain through cooperation, are seen as particularly beneficial (e.g., 
nuclear test ban treaties) (McCollum et al., 2018).

Decentralized renewable energy systems (e.g., home- or village-scale 
solar power) can reduce the burden on girls and women of procuring 
traditional biomass.
Decentralized renewable energy systems (e.g., home- or village-scale 
solar power) can enable a more participatory, democratic process for 
managing energy-related decisions within communities.
The energy justice framework serves as an important decision-making 
tool in order to understand how different principles of justice can inform 
energy systems and policies. Islar et al. (2017) state that off-grid and 
micro-scale energy development offers an alternative path to fossil-fuel 
use and top-down resource management as they democratize the grid 
and increase marginalized communities' access to renewable energy, 
education and health care.

Agriculture and Livestock
Behavioural Response: Sustainable Healthy 
Diets and Reduced Food Waste
Responsible Decision-making (16.7)
Improve Domestic Capacity for Tax Collection (17.1)
To minimize the economic and social cost, policies should target 
emissions at their source—on the supply side—rather than on the 
demand side as supply-side policies have lower calorie cost than 
demand-side policies. The role of livestock system transitions in 
emission reductions depends on the level of the carbon price and which 
emissions sector is targeted by the policies.
The role of livestock system transitions in emission reductions depends 
on the level of the carbon price and which emissions sector is targeted 
by the policies (Havlík et al., 2014). Mechanisms for affecting 
behavioural change in livestock systems need to be better understood by 
implementing combinations of incentives and taxes simultaneously in 
different parts of the world (Herrero and Thornton, 2013).

Appropriate incentives to reduce food waste may require some policy 
innovation and experimentation, but a strong commitment for devising 
and monitoring them seems essential. 
A financial incentive to minimize waste could be created through 
effective taxation (e.g., by taxing foods with the highest wastage rates, 
or by increasing taxes on waste disposal). Decision makers should try to 
integrate agricultural, environmental and nutritional objectives through 
appropriate policy measures to achieve sustainable healthy diets 
coupled with reduction in food waste. It is surprising that politicians and 
policymakers demonstrate little regarding the need to have strategies to 
reduce meat consumption and to encourage more sustainable eating 
practices.

(17.1/ 17.3/17.5/17.17)
Action is needed throughout the food system for improving governance 
and producing more food (Godfray and Garnett, 2014). CSA requires 
policy intervention for careful adjustment of agricultural practices to 
natural conditions, a knowledge-intensive approach, huge financial 
investment, etc., so having strong institutional frameworks is very 
important. The main source of climate finance for CSA in developing 
countries is the public sector. Lack of institutional capacity (as a means 
for securing creation of equal institutions among social groups and 
individuals) can reduce feasibility of AFOLU mitigation measures in the 
near future, especially in areas where small-scale farmers or forest users 
are the main stakeholders (Bustamante et al., 2014).
CSA requires more careful adjustment of agricultural practices to natural 
conditions, a knowledge-intensive approach, huge financial investment 
and policy and institutional innovation, etc. Besides private investment, 
quality of public investment is also important (Behnass et al., 2014). 
Sources of climate finance for CSA in developing countries include 
bilateral donors and multilateral financial institutions, besides public 
sector finance. CSA is committed to new ways of engaging in 
participatory research and partnerships with producers (Steenwerth et 
al., 2014).

 Equal Access, Empowerment of Women (5.5)
Many programmes for CSA have been used to empower women and to 
improve gender equality. Women often have an especially important 
role to play in adaptation, because of their gendered indigenous 
knowledge on matters such as agriculture (Terry, 2009). Without access 
to land, credit and agricultural technologies, women farmers face major 
constraints in their capacity to diversify into alternative livelihoods 
(Demetriades and Esplen, 2008).
Denton, 2002; Nelson et al., 2002; Morton, 2007; Demetriades and 
Esplen, 2009; Terry, 2009; Bernier et al., 2013; Jost et al., 2016
Empower Economic and Political Inclusion of All, Irrespective 
of Sex (10.2)
In many rural societies women are side-lined from decisions regarding 
agriculture even when male household heads are absent, and they often 
lack access to important inputs such as irrigation water, credit, tools 
and fertilizer. To be effective, agricultural mitigation strategies need to 
take these and other aspects of local gender relations into account 
(Terry, 2009). Women's key role in maintaining biodiversity, through 
conserving and domesticating wild edible plant seed, and in food crop 
breeding, is not sufficiently recognized in agricultural and economic 
policymaking; nor is the importance of biodiversity to sustainable rural 
livelihoods in the face of predicted climate changes (Nelson et al., 
2002).
Nelson et al., 2002; Demetriades and Esplen, 2009; Terry, 2009
Most of the animal farming activities such as fodder collection and 
feeding are performed by women. Alongside the considerable 
involvement and contribution of women, gender inequalities are 
pervasive in Indian villages in terms of accessing natural resources, 
extension services, marketing opportunities and financial services as 
well as in exercising their decision-making powers. Therefore, there is a 
need to correct gender bias in the farming sector. Efforts are needed to 
increase the capacity of women to negotiate with confidence and meet 
their strategic needs. Access to and control and management of small 
ruminants, grazing areas and feed resources empower women and lead 
to an overall positive impact on the welfare of the household.

 Equal Access to Economic Resources, Promote Empowerment 
of Women (5.5/5.a/5.b)
Livestock ownership is increasing women’s decision-making and 
economic power within both the household and the community. Access 
to and control and management of small ruminants, grazing areas and 
feed resources empower women and lead to an overall positive impact 
on the welfare of the household.

Opportunities for Women (5.1/5.5)
Many women in developing countries are already prominently engaged 
in economic sectors related to climate adaptation and mitigation efforts 
such as agriculture, renewable energy and forest management and are 
important drivers and leaders in climate responses that are innovative 
and effective, benefitting not only their families but also their wider 
communities. Women’s participation in the decision-making process of 
forest management, for example, has been shown to increase rates of 
reforestation while decreasing the illegal extraction of forest products.

Women have been less involved in REDD+ initiative (pilot project) 
design decisions and processes than men. Girls and women have an 
important role in forestry activities, related to fuel-wood, forest-food 
and pharmaceutical. Their empowerment contributes to sustainable 
forestry as well as reducing inequality .
Urges developed countries to support, through multilateral and bilateral 
channels, the  development of REDD+ national strategies or action plans 
and implementation . Girls and women have an important role in 
forestry activities, related to fuel-wood, forest-food and medicine. Their 
empowerment contributes to sustainable forestry as well as reducing 
inequality .
Institutional building (National Forest Monitoring Systems, Safeguard 
Information Systems, etc.), with full and effective participation of all 
relevant countries . REDD+ actions also deliver non-carbon benefits (e.g. 
local socioeconomic benefits, governance improvements). Forest 
governance is another central aspect in recent studies, including the 
debate on decentralization of forest management, logging concessions 
in public-owned commercially valuable forests and timber certification, 
primarily in temperate forests .
To provide finance and technology to developing countries to support 
emissions reductions. Be supported  by adequate and predictable 
financial and technology support, including support for capacity building 
. Partnerships in the form of significant aid money from, e.g., Norway, 
other bilateral donors and the World Bank’s Forest Carbon Partnership 
Facility (FCPF) are forthcoming . Estimates of opportunity cost for 
REDD+ are very low. Lower costs and/or higher carbon prices could 
combine to protect more forests, including those with lower carbon 
content. Conversely, where the cost of action is high, a large amount of 
additional funding would be required for the forest to be protected 
(Miles and Kapos, 2008). Forest governance is another central aspect in 
recent studies, including debate on decentralization of forest 
management, logging concessions in public-owned commercially 
valuable forests and timber certification, primarily in temperate forests . 
Partnerships between local forest managers, community enterprises and 
private sector companies can support local economies and livelihoods 
and boost regional and national economic growth .

Epstein and Theuer, 2017
Land-related mitigation, such as biofuel production, as well as 
conservation and reforestation action can increase competition for land 
and natural resources, so these measures should be accompanied by 
complementary policies. (Quoted from Epstein and Theur, 2017)
Financing at the national and international level is required to grow 
more seedlings/sapling, restore land, create awareness and education 
factsheets, provide training to local communities regarding the benefits 
of afforestation and reforestation. Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol 
further sets a Clean Development Mechanism through which countries 
in Annex I earn ‘certified emissions reductions’ through projects 
implemented in developing countries (Montanarella and Alva, 2015). 
Afforestation and reforestation in India are being carried out under 
various programmes, namely social forestry initiated in the early 1980s, 
the Joint Forest Management Programme initiated in 1990, afforestation 
under National Afforestation and Eco-development Board programmes 
since 1992, and private farmer and industry initiated plantation forestry. 
If the current rate of afforestation and reforestation is assumed to 
continue, the carbon stock could increase by 11% by 2030 
(Ravindranath et al 2008)
Women’s participation in the decision-making process of forest 
management, for example, has been shown to increase rates of 
reforestation while decreasing the illegal extraction of forest products.
Responsible Decision-making (16.7)
Finance and Trade (17.1/17.10)
Indonesian factories may seek advantages through non-price 
competition—perhaps by highlighting decent working conditions or the 
existence of a union—or to see trade associations or government 
agencies promoting the country as a responsible sourcing location 
(Bartley, 2010). In the absence of domestic legal instruments providing 
incentives to improve sustainability of sourcing, it appears that 
initiatives to engage the major importing enterprises in developing 
responsible sourcing practices and policies is a practical approach. 
Unless initiatives involve all the major importers, they are unlikely to be 
successful since the high costs associated with accreditation would 
increase production costs for these firms relative to their competitors 
(Huang et al., 2013).
Private certification initiatives for wood product and biomass sourcing 
may extend their schemes with criteria for 'leakage' (external GHG 
effects). Also recycling of waste wood in pellets is not yet practiced, due 
to unclear rules in the EU Waste Directive about overseas shipping 
(Sikkema et al., 2014). Engagement of Chinese government and private 
sector stakeholders in supply-country sustainability initiatives may be 
the best way to support this gradual process of improvement. Although 
carrying out due diligence in timber sourcing can require considerable 
internal resources, it may be substantially less of a financial burden than 
the potential fines and reputational damage resulting from sourcing 
unknown or controversial timber (Huang et al., 2013).

A switch to low-carbon fuels can lead to a reduction in water demand 
and waste water if the existing higher-carbon fuel is associated with a 
higher water intensity than the lower-carbon fuel. However, in some 
situations the switch to a low-carbon fuel such as, for example, biofuel 
could increase water use compared to existing conditions if the biofuel 
comes from a water-intensive feedstock.
A circular economy instead of linear global economy can achieve 
climate goals and can help in economic growth through industrialization 
which saves on resources, the environment and supports small, medium 
and even large industries, and can lead to employment generation. So 
new regulations, incentives and a tax regime can help in achieving the 
goal, especially in newly emerging developing countries - although also 
applicable for large industrialized countries.
A circular economy help in managing local biodiversity better by having 
less resource use footprint 
Water Efficiency and Pollution Prevention (6.3/6.4/6.6)
Sustainable and Efficient Resource (12.2/12.5/12.6/12.7/12.a)
Efficiency and behavioural changes in the industrial sector that lead to 
reduced energy demand can lead to reduced requirements on energy 
supply. As water is used to convert energy into useful forms, the 
reduction in industrial demand is anticipated to reduce water 
consumption and waste water, resulting in more clean water for other 
sectors and the environment. Likewise, reducing material inputs for 
industrial processes through efficiency and behavioural changes will 
reduce water inputs in the material supply chains. In extractive 
industries there can be a trade-off with production unless strategically 
managed.
Once started leads to chain of actions within the sector and policy space 
to sustain the effort. Helps in expansion of sustainable industrial 
production (Ghana).

CCU/S requires access to water for cooling and processing which could 
contribute to localized water stress. CCS/U processes can potentially be 
configured for increased water efficiency compared to a system without 
carbon capture via process integration.
EPI plants are capital intensive and are mostly operated by 
multinationals with long investment cycles. In developed countries new 
investments are happening in brown fields, while in developing 
countries these are in green fields. Collaboration among partners and 
user demand change, policy change is essential for encouraging these 
large risky investments.
CCU/S in the chemical industry faces challenges for transport costs and 
storage. In the UK cluster region have been identified for storage under 
sea.

resulting in more clean water for other sectors and the environment. A

Subsidies for renewables are anticipated to lead to the benefits and

renewables could lead to improved water access and treatment if 
subsidies support projects that provide both water and energy services 
(e.g., solar desalination).
Sustainable practices adopted by public and private bodies in their 
operations (e.g., for goods procurement, supply chain management and 
accounting) create an enabling environment in which renewable energy 
and energy efficiency measures may gain greater traction (McCollum et 
al., 2018).

water is used to convert energy into useful forms, the reduction in 
residential demand is anticipated to reduce water consumption and 
waste water, resulting in more clean water for other sectors and the

Technological improvements alone are not sufficient to increase energy 
savings. Zhao et al. (2017) found that building technology and occupant 
behaviours interact with each other and finally affect energy 
consumption from home. They found that occupant habits could not 
take advantage of more than 50% of energy efficiency potential allowed 
by an efficient building. In the electronic segment, product obsolescence 
represents a key challenge for sustainability. Echegaray (2016) discusses 
the dissonance between consumers' product durability experience, 
orientations to replace devices before terminal technical failure, and 
perceptions of industry responsibility and performance. The results from 
their urban sample survey indicate that technical failure is far surpassed 
by subjective obsolescence as a cause for fast product replacement. At 
the same time Liu et al. (2017) suggest that we need to go beyond 
individualist and structuralist perspectives to analyse sustainable 
consumption (i.e., combines both human agency paradigm and social 
structural perspective).

Similar to behavioural changes, efficiency measures in the transport 
sector that lead to reduced transport demand can lead to reduced 
transport energy supply. As water is used to produce a number of 
important transport fuels, the reduction in transport demand is 
anticipated to reduce water consumption and waste water, resulting in 
more clean water for other sectors and the environment.
Relational complex transport behaviour resulting in significant growth in 
energy-inefficient car choices, as well as differences in mobility patterns 
(distances driven, driving styles) and actual fuel consumption between 
different car segments all affect non-progress on transport 
decarbonization. Consumption choices and individual lifestyles are 
situated and tied to the form of the surrounding urbanization. Major 
behavioural changes and emissions reductions require understanding of 
this relational complexity, consideration of potential interactions with 
other policies, and the local context and implementation of both 
command-and-control as well as market-based measures.

consumption patterns of urban consumers, and the responsibility of the 
ultimate consumers outside the city.  Important for climate policy of 
monitoring the CO2 clusters that dominate CO2 emissions in global 
supply chains, because they offer insights on where climate policy can 
be effectively directed.

Ensuring that the world’s poor have access to modern energy services

Due to persistent reliance on fossil fuels, it is posited that transport is 
more difficult to decarbonize than other sectors. This study partially 
confirms that transport is less reactive to a given carbon tax than the 
non-transport sectors: in the first half of the century, transport 
mitigation is delayed by 10–30 years compared to non-transport 
mitigation. The extent to which earlier mitigation is possible strongly 
depends on implemented technologies and model structures.

Non-biomass Renewables - solar, wind hydro
Increased Use of Biomass
Replacing Coal
Biomass expansion could lead to increased water stress when irrigated 
feedstocks and water-intensive processing steps are used. Bioenergy 
crops can alter flow over land and through soils as well as require 
fertilizer, and this can reduce water availability and quality. Planting 
bioenergy crops on marginal lands or in some situations to replace 
existing crops can lead to reductions in soil erosion and fertilizer inputs, 
improving water quality.
Protecting terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably managing forests, halting 
deforestation, preventing biodiversity loss and controlling invasive alien 
species could potentially clash with renewable energy expansion, if that 
would mean constraining large-scale utilization of bioenergy or 
hydropower. Good governance, cross-jurisdictional coordination and 
sound implementation practices are critical for minimizing trade-offs 
(McCollum et al., 2018).

Wind/solar renewable energy technologies are associated with very low 
water requirements compared to existing thermal power plant 
technologies. Widespread deployment is therefore anticipated to lead to 
improved water efficiency and avoided thermal pollution. However, 
managing wind and solar variability can increase water use at thermal 
power plants  and can cause poor water quality downstream from 
hydropower plants. Access to distributed renewables can provide power 
to improve water access, but could also lead to increased groundwater 
pumping and stress if mismanaged. Developing dams to support reliable 
hydropower production can fragment rivers and alter natural flows 
reducing water and ecosystem quality. Developing dams to support 
reliable hydropower production can result in disputes for water in basins 
with up- and down-stream users. Storing water in reservoirs increases 
evaporation, which could offset water conservation targets and reduce 
availability of water downstream. However, hydropower plays an 
important role in energy access for water supply in developing regions, 
can support water security, and has the potential to reduce water 
demands if used without reservoir storage to displace other water 
intensive energy processes.
Renewable energy and energy efficiency slow the depletion of several 
types of natural resources, namely coal, oil, natural gas and uranium. In 
addition, the phasing-out of fossil fuel subsidies encourages less 
wasteful energy consumption; but if that is done, then the policies 
implemented must take care to minimize any counteracting adverse side-
effects on the poor (e.g., fuel price rises). (Quote from McCollum et al., 
2018)
Ocean-based energy from renewable sources (e.g., offshore wind farms, 
wave and tidal power) are potentially significant energy resource bases 
for island countries and countries situated along coastlines. Multi-use 
platforms combining renewable energy generation, aqua-culture, 
transport services and leisure activities can lay the groundwork for more 
diversified marine economies. Depending on the local context and 
prevailing regulations, ocean-based energy installations could either 
induce spatial competition with other marine activities, such as tourism, 
shipping, resources exploitation, and marine and coastal habitats and 
protected areas, or provide further grounds for protecting those exact 
habitats, therefore enabling marine protection. (Quote from McCollum 
et al., 2018) Hydropower disrupts the integrity and connectivity of 
aquatic habitats and impacts the productivity of inland waters and their 
fisheries.
Landscape and wildlife impact for wind; habitat impact for hydropower.

Behavioural Response: Sustainable Healthy Diets and Reduced Food Waste
Agriculture and Livestock
Millet or sorghum yield can double as compared with unimproved land 
by more than 1 tonne per hectare due to sustainable intensification. An 
integrated approach to safe applications of both conventional and 
modern agricultural biotechnologies will contribute to increased yield 
(Lakshmi et al., 2015).
Agricultural intensification can promote conservation of biological 
diversity by reducing deforestation, and by rehabilitation and restoration 
of biodiverse communities on previously developed farm or pasture 
land. However, planting monocultures on biodiversity hot spots can 
have adverse side-effects, reducing biodiversity. Genetically modified 
crops reduce demand for cultivated land. Adaptation of integrated 
landscape approaches can provide various ecosystem services. CSA 
enrich linkages across sectors including management of land and bio-
resources. Land sparing has the potential to be beneficial for 
biodiversity, including for many species of conservation concern, but 
benefits will depend strongly on the use of spared land. In addition, 
high yield farming involves trade-offs and is likely to be detrimental for 
wild species associated with farm land (Lamb et al., 2016).

Reduced food waste avoids direct water demand and waste water for 
crops and food processing, and avoids water used for energy supply by 
reducing agricultural, food processing and waste management energy 
inputs. Healthy diets will support water efficiency targets if the shift 
towards healthy foods results in food supply chains that are less water 
intensive than the supply chains supporting the historical dietary 
pattern.
Reduce loss and waste in food systems, processing, distribution and by 
changing household habits. To reduce environmental impact of livestock 
both production and consumption trends in this sector should be traced. 
Livestock production needs to be intensified in a responsible way (i.e., 
be made more efficient in the way that it uses natural resources). 
Wasted food represents a waste of all the emissions generated during 
the course of producing and distributing that food. Mitigation measures 
include: eat no more than needed to maintain a healthy body weight; 
eat seasonal, robust, field-grown vegetables rather than protected, 
fragile foods prone to spoilage and requiring heating and lighting in 
their cultivation, refrigeration stage; consume fewer foods with low 
nutritional value e.g., alcohol, tea, coffee, chocolate and bottled water 
(these foods are not needed in our diet and need not be produced); shop 
on foot or over the Internet (reduced energy use). Reduction in food 
waste will not only pave the path for sustainable production but will 
also help in achieving sustainable consumption (Garnett, 2011). Reduce 
meat consumption to encourage more sustainable eating practices.
Reducing food waste has secondary benefits like protecting soil from 
degradation, and decreasing pressure for land conversion into 
agriculture and thereby protecting biodiversity.
The agricultural area that becomes redundant through the dietary 
transitions can be used for other agricultural purposes such as energy 
crop production, or will revert to natural vegetation. A global food 
transition to less meat, or even a complete switch to plant-based protein 
food, could have a dramatic effect on land use. Up to 2,700 Mha of 
pasture and 100 Mha of crop land could be abandoned (Quoted from 
Stehfest et al., 2009)

Forest 
Identified large amounts of land (749 Mha) globally as biophysically 
suitable and meeting the CDM eligibility criteria . Forest landscape 
restoration can conserve biodiversity and reduce land degradation. 
Mangroves  reduce impacts of disasters (cyclones/storms/floods) acting 
as live seawalls and enhance forest resources/biodiversity. Forest goal 
can conserve/restore 3.9–8.8 m ha/year average, 77.2–176.9 m ha in 
total and 7.7–17.7 m ha /year in 2030 of forest area by 2030 (Wolosin, 
2014). Forest and biodiversity conservation, protected area formation 
and forestry-based afforestation are practices that enhance resilience of 
forest ecosystems to climate change (IPCC, 2014). Strategic placement 
of tree belts in lands affected by dryland salinity can remediate the 
affected lands by modifying landscape water balances and protect 
livestock. It can restore biologically diverse communities on previously 
developed farmland . Large-scale restoration is likely to benefit 
ecosystem service provision, including recreation, biodiversity, 
conservation and flood mitigation. Reforestation of mixed native species 
and in carefully chosen sites could increase biodiversity, reducing run-off 
and erosion .
Zomer et al., 2008; Bustamante et al., 2014; Kibria, 2015; Lamb et al., 
2016; Dooley and Kartha, 2018
Similar to REDD+, forest management alters the hydrological cycle 
which could be positive or negative from a water perspective and is 
dependent on existing conditions. Forest landscape restoration can have 
a large impact on water cycles. Strategic placement of tree belts in lands 
affected by dryland salinity can remediate the affected lands by 
modifying landscape water balances. Watershed scale reforestation can 
result in the restoration of water quality. Fast-growing species can 
increase nutrient input and water inputs that can cause ecological 
damage and alter local hydrological patterns. Reforestation of mixed 
native species and in carefully chosen sites could increase biodiversity 
and restore waterways, reducing run-off and erosion (Dooley and 
Kartha, 2018).

Restoration of Land (15.1)
Grasslands are valuable, but improved management is required as grass 
accounts for close to 50% of feed use in livestock systems . The scenario 
with 100% reduction of food-competing-feedstuffs resulted in a 335 
Mha decrease in arable land area, which corresponds to a decrease of 
22% in arable and 7% in the total agricultural area .
Zomer et al., 2008; Kibria, 2015; Bonsch et al., 2016; Gao and Bryan,

al., 2016
Livestock efficiency measures are expected to reduce water required for 
livestock systems as well as associated livestock waste water flows. 
However, efficiency measures that include agricultural intensification 
could increase water demands locally, leading to increased water stress 
if the intensification is mismanaged. In scenarios where zero human-
edible concentrate feed is used for livestock, freshwater  use reduces by  
21%.
Ensure Sustainable Production Patterns and Restructing 
Taxation (12.3/12c)
In the future, many developed countries will see a continuing trend in 
which livestock breeding focuses on other attributes in addition to 
production and productivity, such as product quality, increasing animal 
welfare, disease resistance (Thornton, 2010). Diet composition and 
quality are key determinants of the productivity and feed-use efficiency 
of farm animals (Herrero, et al., 2013). Mechanisms for effecting 
behavioural change in livestock systems need to be better understood by 
implementing  combinations of incentives and taxes simultaneously in 
different parts of the world (Herrero and Thornton, 2013). Reducing the 
amount of human-edible crops that are fed to livestock represents a 
reversal of the current trend of steep increases in livestock production, 
and especially of monogastrics, so would require drastic changes in 
production and consumption (Schader et al., 2015).

Ocean Acidification, Nutrient Pollution (14.3/14.1)
Development of blue carbon resources (coastal and marine vegetated 
ecosystems) can lead to coordinated management of water in coastal 
areas.
Mangroves could buffer acidification in their immediate vicinity; 
seaweeds have not been able to mitigate the effect on ocean 
foraminifera.
Enhanced weathering (either by spreading lime or quicklime, in 
combination with CCS, over the ocean or olivine at beaches or the 
catchment area of rivers) opposes ocean acidification. "End-of-century 
ocean acidification is reversed under RCP4.5 and reduced by about two-
thirds under RCP8.5; additionally, surface ocean aragonite saturation 
state, a key control on coral calcification rates, is maintained above 3.5 
throughout the low latitudes, thereby helping maintain the viability of 
tropical coral reef ecosystems ." However, marine biology would also be 
affected, in particular if spreading olivine is used, which works like 
ocean (iron) fertilization.
Protect Inland Freshwater Systems (14.1)
Olivine can contain toxic metals such as nickel which could accumulate 
in the environment or disrupt the local ecosystem by changing the pH of 
the water (in case of spreading in the catchment area of rivers).

Accelerating Energy Efficiency 
Improvement
Low-Carbon Fuel Switch
Decarbonization/CCS/CCU
Industries are becoming suppliers of energy, waste heat and water to 
neighbourial human settlements, and therefore there is a reduced 
primary energy demand, which also makes towns and cities grow 
sustainably.
Transitioning to a more renewables-based energy system that is highly 
energy efficient is well-aligned with the goal of upgrading energy 
infrastructure and making the energy industry more sustainable. At the 
same time, infrastructure upgrades in other parts of the economy, such 
as modernized telecommunications networks, can create the conditions 
for a successful expansion of renewable energy and energy efficiency 
measures (e.g., smart metering and demand-side management; 
McCollum et al., 2018).
Unemployment rate reduction from 25% to 12% in South Africa. 
Enhances firm productivity and technical and managerial capacity of the 
employees. New jobs for managing energy efficiency opens up 
opportunities in energy service delivery sector.
Energy efficiency leads to reduced energy demand and hence energy 
supply and energy security, reduces import. Positive rebound effect can 
raise demand but to a very less extent due to low rebound effect in 
industry sector in many countries and by appropriate mix of industries 
(China) can maintain energy savings gain. Supplying surplus energy to 
cities is also happening, proving maintenance culture, switching off idle 
equipment helps in saving energy (e.g Ghana).

Industries are becoming suppliers of energy, waste heat, water and roof 
tops used for solar energy generation, and supply to neighbourial 
human settlements, therefore reducing primary energy demand, which 
also makes towns and cities grow sustainably.
A circular economy instead of linear global economy is helping new 
innovation, and infrastructure can achieve climate goals and can help in 
economic growth through industrialization which saves on resources 
and the environment and supports small, medium and even large 
industries, which can lead to employment generation. So new 
regulations, incentives and revised tax regime can help in achieving the 
goal.

Industries are becoming suppliers of energy, waste heat, water and roof

primary energy demand. CHP in chemical industries can help in 
providing surplus power in the grid.
Deep decarbonization through radical technological change in EPI will 
lead to radical  innovations, for example, in completely changing 
industries' innovation strategies, plants and equipment, skills, 
production techniques, design, etc. Radical CCS will need new 
infrastructure to transport CO2.
EPI s are important players for economic growth. Deep decarbonization 
of EPIs through radical innovation is consistent with well-below 2°C 
scenarios.
CCS for EPIs can be incremental, but need additional space and can 
need additional energy, sometimes compensating for higher efficiency. 
For example, recirculating blast R furnace and CCS for iron steel means 
high energy demand; electric melting in glass can mean higher 
electricity prices; in the paper industry, new separation and drying 
technologies are key to reducing the energy intensity, allowing for 
carbon neutral operation in the future; bio-refineries can reduce petro-
refineries; DRI in iron and steel with H2 encourages innovation in 
hydrogen infrastructure; and the chemicals industry also encourage 
renewable electricity and hydrogen as bio-based polymers can increase 
biomass price.

Adoption of smart meters and smart grids following community-based 
social marketing help with infrastructure expansion. People are adopting 
solar rooftops, white roof/vertical garden/green roofs at much faster 
rates due to new innovations and regulations.
Behavioural change programmes help in sustaining energy savings 
through new infrastructure developments.
Lifestyle change measures and adoption behaviour affect residential 
energy use and implementation of efficient technologies as residential 
HVAC systems. Also, social influence can drive energy savings in users 
exposed to energy consumption feedback. Effect of autonomous 
motivation on energy savings behaviour is greater than that of other 
more established predictors, such as intentions, subjective norms, 
perceived behavioural control and past behaviour. Use of a hybrid 
engineering approach using social psychology and economic behaviour 
models are suggested for residential peak electricity demand response. 
However, some take-back in energy savings can happen due to rebound 
effects unless managed appropriately or accounted for welfare 
improvement. Adjusting thermostats helps in saving energy. Uptake of 
energy efficient appliances by households with an introduction to 
appliance standards, training, promotional material dissemination and 
the desire to save on energy bills are helping to change acquisition 
behaviour.
Renewable energy technologies and energy efficient urban infrastructure 
solutions (e.g., public transit) can also promote urban environmental 
sustainability by improving air quality and reducing noise. Efficient 
transportation technologies powered by renewably based energy carriers 
will be a key building block of any sustainable transport system 
(McCollum et al., 2018). Green buildings help in sustainable 
construction.
Deploying renewables and energy efficient technologies, when 
combined with other targeted monetary and fiscal policies, can help 
spur innovation and reinforce local, regional and national industrial and 
employment objectives. Gross employment effects seem likely to be 
positive; however, uncertainty remains regarding the net employment 
effects due to several uncertainties surrounding macro-economic 
feedback loops playing out at the global level. Moreover, the 
distributional effects experienced by individual actors may vary 
significantly. Strategic measures may need to be taken to ensure that a 
large-scale switch to renewable energy minimizes any negative impacts 
on those currently engaged in the business of fossil fuels (e.g., 
government support could help businesses re-tool and workers re-train). 
To support clean energy and energy efficiency efforts, strengthened 
financial institutions in developing country communities are necessary 
for providing capital, credit and insurance to local entrepreneurs 
attempting to enact change (McCollum et al., 2018).
There is high agreement among researchers based on a great deal of 
evidence across various countries that energy efficiency improvement 
reduces energy consumption and therefore leads to energy savings (e.g., 
efficient stoves save bioenergy). Countries with higher hours of use due 
to higher ambient temperatures or more carbon intensive electricity 
grids benefit more from available improvements in energy efficiency and 
use of refrigerant transition.

In rapidly growing cities, the carbon savings from investments at scale, 
in cost-effective low-carbon measures, could be quickly overwhelmed – 
in as little as 7 years – by the impacts of sustained population and 
economic growth, highlighting the need to build capacities that enable 
the exploitation not only of the economically attractive options in the 
short term but also of those deeper and more structural changes that are 
likely to be needed in the longer term. With hybrid electric vehicles and 
plug-in electric vehicles, there is the emergence of new concepts in 
transportation, such as electric highways.
Lack of appropriate infrastructure leads to limited access to jobs for the 
urban poor (Africa, Latin America, India).
The decarbonization of the freight sector tends to occur in the second 
part of the century, and the sector decarbonizes by a lower extent than 
the rest of the economy. Decarbonizing road freight on a global scale 
remains a challenge even when notable progress in biofuels and electric 
vehicles has been accounted for.
Biofuel increases share of the renewables but can perform poorly if too 
many countries increase their use of biofuel, whereas electrification 
performs best when many other countries implement this technology. 
The strategies are not mutually exclusive and simultaneous 
implementation of some provides synergies for national energy security. 
Therefore, it is important to consider the results of material and 
contextual factors that co-evolve. Electric vehicles using electricity from 
renewables or low carbon sources combined with e-mobility options 
such as trolley buses, metros, trams and electro buses, as well as 
promote walking and biking, especially for short distances, need 
consideration.

The two most important elements of making cities sustainable are 
efficient buildings and transport (e.g., Macau).
Combining promotion of mass transportation – train lines, tram lines, 
BRTs, gondola lift systems, bicycle-sharing systems and hybrid buses – 
and telecommuting reduces traffic and significantly contributes to 
meeting climate targets. A comprehensive package of complementary 
mitigation options is necessary for deep and sustained emissions 
reductions. In Sweden, a public bus fleet is aiming more towards 
decarbonization than  efficiency.
Significant opportunities to slow travel growth and improve efficiency 
exist and, similarly, alternatives to petroleum exist but have different 
characteristics in terms of availability, cost, distribution, infrastructure, 
storage and public acceptability. Production of new technologies, fuels 
and infrastructure can favour economic growth; however, efficient 
financing of increased capital spending and infrastructure is critical.
Accelerating efficiency in tourism transport reduces energy demand 
(China).

Shukxin et al., 2016
Climate change threatens to worsen poverty, therefore pro-poor 
mitigation policies are needed to reduce this threat; for example, 
investing more and better in infrastructure by leveraging private 
resources and using designs that account for future climate change and 
the related uncertainty.
Policy contradictions (e.g., standards, efficient technologies leading to 
increased electricity prices leading the poor to switch away from 
clean(er) fuels) and unintended outcomes (e.g., redistribution of income 
generated by carbon taxes) results in contradictions of the primary aims 
of (productive) job creation and poverty alleviation, and in trade-offs 
between mitigation, adaptation and development policies. Detailed 
assessments of mitigation policies consequences requires developing 
methods and reliable evidence to enable policymakers to more 
systematically identify how different social groups may be affected by 
the different available policy options.
Behavioural responses will reduce the volume of transport needs and, by 
extension, energy demand.
As people prefer more mass transportation – train lines, tram lines, 
BRTs, gondola lift systems, bicycle-sharing systems and hybrid buses – 
and telecommuting, the need for new infrastructure increases.
Ensuring access to basic housing services implies that households have 
access to modern energy forms. (Quote from McCollum et al., 2018) 
Solar roof tops in Macau make cities sustainable. Introduction of 
incentives and norms for solar/white/green rooftops in cities are helping 
to accelerate the expansion of the infrastructure.
Creutzig et al. (2014) assessed the potential for renewable energies in 
the European region. They found that a European energy transition with 
a high-level of renewable energy installations in the periphery could act 
as an economic stimulus, decrease trade deficits and possibly have 
positive employment effects. Provision of energy access can play a 
critical enabling role for new productive activities, livelihoods and 
employment. Reliable access to modern energy services can have an 
important influence on productivity and earnings (McCollum et al., 
2018).
Renewable energies could potentially serve as the main source to meet 
energy demand in rapidly growing developing country cities. Ali et al. 
(2015) estimated the potential of solar, wind and biomass renewable 
energy options to meet part of the electricity demand in Karachi, 
Pakistan.
Adoption of smart meters and smart grids following community-based 
social marketing help in infrastructure expansion. Statutory norms to 
enhance energy and resource efficiency in buildings is encouraging 
green building projects. Introduction of incentives and norms for solar 
rooftops/white/green roofs in cities are helping to accelerate innovation 
and the expansion of infrastructure.

Decarbonization of the energy system through an upscaling of 
renewables and energy efficiency is consistent with sustained economic 
growth and resource decoupling. Long-term scenarios point towards 
slight consumption losses caused by a rapid and pervasive expansion of 
such energy solutions. Whether sustainable growth, as an overarching 
concept, is attainable or not is more disputed in the literature. Existing 
literature is also undecided as to whether or not access to modern 
energy services causes economic growth (McCollum et al., 2018).
A rapid upscaling of renewable energies could necessitate the early 
retirement of fossil energy infrastructure (e.g., power plants, refineries, 
pipelines) on a large scale. The implications of this could in some cases 
be negative, unless targeted policies can help alleviate the burden on 
industry (McCollum et al., 2018).
Deployment of renewable energy and improvements in energy efficiency 
globally will aid climate change mitigation efforts, and this, in turn, can 
help to reduce the exposure of people to certain types of disasters and 
extreme events (McCollum et al., 2018).

Reducing global food supply chain losses have several important 
secondary benefits like conserving energy.
23–24% of total cropland and fertilizers are used to produce losses. So 
reduction in food losses will help to diversify these valuable resources 
into other productive activities.
By targeting infrastructure, processing and distribution losses, wastage

Land-based Greenhouse Gas Reduction and Soil Carbon 
Sequestration
Many developing countries including Gulf States will benefit from CSA 
given the central role of agriculture in their economic and social 
development. (Quoted from Behnassi et al. 2014). Low commodity 
prices have reduced the incentive to invest in yield growth and have led 
to declining  farm labour and farm capital investment. (Quoted from 
Lamb et al., 2016)
Reduced research support and delayed industrialization will have an 
adverse effect on food security and nourishment of children. Organic 
farming technologies utilizing bio-based fertilizers (composted human 
and animal manure) are some of the conventional biotechnological 
options for reducing artificial fertilizer use (Lakshmi et al., 2015). CSA 
requires huge financial investment and institutional innovation. CSA is 
committed to new ways of engaging in participatory research and 
partnerships with producers (Steenwerth et al., 2014). Technologies 
used on-farm and during food processing to increase productivity which 
also helps in adaptation and/or mitigation are new, so convincing 
potential customers is difficult. Also, low-awareness of CSA, 
inaccessible language, high costs, lack of verified impact of 
technologies, hard to reach and train farmers, low consumer demand 
and unequal distribution of costs/benefits across supply chains are 
barriers to CSA technology adoption (Long et al., 2016). Low commodity 
prices have reduced the incentive to invest in yield growth and have led 
to declining investment in research and development (Lamb et al., 
2016)
Conventional agricultural biotechnology methods such as energy 
efficient farming can help in sequestration of soil carbon. Modern 
biotechnologies such as green energy and N-efficient GM crops can also 
help in C-sequestration. Biotech crops allow farmers to use less – and 
environmentally friendly – energy and practice soil carbon 
sequestration. Biofuels, both from traditional and GMO crops, such as 
sugar cane, oilseed, rapeseed and jatropha, can be produced. Green 
energy programmes through plantations of perennial nonedible oilseed 
producing plants and production of biodiesel for direct use in the energy 
sector or blending biofuels with fossil fuels in certain proportions can 
thereby minimize fossil fuel use. (Quoted from Lakshmi et al., 2015) GM 
crops reduce demand for fossil fuel-based inputs.

Complete genome maps for poultry and cattle now exist, and these 
open up the way to possible advances in evolutionary biology, animal 
breeding and animal models for human diseases. Genomic selection 
should be able to at least double the rate of genetic gain in the dairy 
industry.  (Quoted from Thornton, 2010) Nanotechnology, biogas 
technology and separation technologies are disruptive technologies that 
enhance biogas production from anaerobic digesters or to reduce 
odours

Scenarios where zero human-edible concentrate feed is used for

Exploiting the increasingly decoupled interactions between crops and 
livestock could be beneficial for promoting structural changes in the 
livestock sector and is a prerequisite for the sustainable growth of the 
sector. (Quoted from Herrero et al., 2013)

Expanding road networks are recognized as one of the main drivers of 
deforesting and forest degradation, diminishing forest benefits to 
communities, On the other hand, roads can enhance market access, 
thereby boosting local benefits (SDG 1) from the commercialization of 
forest products. (Quoted from Katila et al., 2017). Efforts by the 
Government of Zambia to reduce emissions by REDD+ have contributed 
to erosion control, ecotourism and pollination valued at 2.5% of the 
country's GDP
Bartley, 2010; Huang et al., 2013
Capacity for processing certified timber is often underutilized, due to the 
limited supply available. As a result, manufacturing firms that are 
seeking to tap into green markets often turn to other sources of timber. 
(Quoted from Bartley, 2010) Responsible sourcing, when integrated into 
business practices, can enable retailers to better manage brand value 
and reputation by avoiding negative public relations, as well as 
maintaining and enhancing brand integrity (Huang et al., 2013).
Consider the entire sinks and reservoirs of GHG while developing the 
nationally appropriate mitigation actions. For countries with a 
significant contribution of forest degradation (and GHG emissions) from 
wood fuels, this should be considered. (Quoted from Bastos Lima et al., 
2017). Biomass for energy is recognized as often being inefficient, and is 
often harvested in an unsustainable manner, but is a renewable energy 
source.
Efforts by the Government of Zambia to reduce emissions by REDD+ 
have contributed to erosion control, ecotourism and pollination valued 
at 2.5% of the country's GDP. Partnerships between local forest 
managers, community enterprises and private sector companies can 
support local economies and livelihoods, and boost regional and 
national economic growth.
Many tree plantations worldwide have higher growth rates which can 
provide higher rates of returns for investors. Agroforestry initiatives that 
offer significant opportunities for projects to provide benefits to 
smallholder farmers can also help address land degradation through 
community-based efforts in more marginal areas. Mangroves reduce 
impacts of disasters (cyclones/storms/floods) and enhance water quality, 
fisheries, tourism businesses and livelihoods.

The US Forest Service estimates that an average NYC street tree (urban 
afforestation) produces 209 USD in annual benefits, which is primarily 
driven by aesthetic (90 USD per tree) and energy savings (from shade) 
benefits (47.63 USD per tree).
Energy Conservation (7.3/7.b)
The trade of wood pellets from clean wood waste should be facilitated 
with less administrative import barriers by the EU, in order to have this 
new option seriously accounted for as a future resource for energy. 
(Quoted from Sikkema et al., 2014) Recommends further harmonization 
of legal harvesting, sustainable sourcing and cascaded use requirements 
for woody biomass for energy with the current requirements of 
voluntary SFM certification schemes.
Some standards seek primarily to coordinate global trade, many purport 
to promote ecological  sustainability and social justice or to 
institutionalize CSR, for example, labour standards developed in the 
wake of sweatshops and child labour scandals. Environmental standards 
for pollution control, etc. Indonesian factories may seek advantages 
through non-price competition—perhaps by highlighting decent 
working conditions or the existence of a union—or to see trade 
associations or government  promoting the country as a responsible 
sourcing location.
