Executive summary
Increases in global mean surface temperature are projected 
to result in continued permafrost degradation and 
coastal degradation (high confidence), increased wildfire, 
decreased  crop yields in low latitudes, decreased food 
stability, decreased water availability, vegetation loss 
(medium confidence), decreased access to food and increased 
soil erosion (low confidence). There is high agreement and 
high evidence that increases in global mean temperature will 
result in continued increase in global vegetation loss, coastal 
degradation, as well as decreased crop yields in low latitudes, 
decreased food stability, decreased access to food and 
nutrition, and medium confidence in continued permafrost 
degradation and water scarcity in drylands. Impacts are already 
observed across all components (high confidence). Some processes 
may experience irreversible impacts at lower levels of warming than 
others. There are high risks from permafrost degradation, and wildfire, 
coastal degradation, stability of food systems at 1.5°C while high 
risks from soil erosion, vegetation loss and changes in nutrition only 
occur at higher temperature thresholds due to increased possibility 
for adaptation (medium confidence). {7.2.2.1, 7.2.2.2, 7.2.2.3; 
7.2.2.4; 7.2.2.5; 7.2.2.6; 7.2.2.7; Figure 7.1} 
These changes result in compound risks to food systems, 
human and ecosystem health, livelihoods, the viability of 
infrastructure, and the value of land (high confidence). 
The experience and dynamics of risk change over time as a result 
of both human and natural processes (high confidence). There is high 
confidence that climate and land changes pose increased risks at 
certain periods of life (i.e., to the very young and ageing populations) 
as well as sustained risk to those living in poverty. Response options 
may also increase risks. For example, domestic efforts to insulate 
populations from food price spikes associated with climatic stressors 
in the mid-2000s inadequately prevented food insecurity and poverty, 
and worsened poverty globally. {7.2.1, 7.2.2, 7.3, Table 7.1}
There is significant regional heterogeneity in risks: tropical 
regions, including Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia and 
Central and South America are particularly vulnerable to 
decreases in crop yield (high confidence). Yield of crops in 
higher latitudes may initially benefit from warming as well as from 
higher carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. But temperate zones, 
including the Mediterranean, North Africa, the Gobi desert, Korea 
and western United States are susceptible to disruptions from 
increased drought frequency and intensity, dust storms and fires 
(high confidence). {7.2.2}
Risks related to land degradation, desertification and food 
security increase with temperature and can reverse development 
gains in some socio-economic development pathways (high 
confidence). SSP1 reduces the vulnerability and exposure 
of human and natural systems and thus limits risks resulting 
from desertification, land degradation and food insecurity 
compared to SSP3 (high confidence). SSP1 is characterised by 
low population growth, reduced inequalities, land-use regulation, low 
meat consumption, increased trade and few barriers to adaptation or 
mitigation. SSP3 has the opposite characteristics. Under SSP1, only 
a small fraction of the dryland population (around 3% at 3°C for the 
year 2050) will be exposed and vulnerable to water stress. However 
under SSP3, around 20% of dryland populations (for the year 2050) 
will be exposed and vulnerable to water stress by 1.5°C and 24% by 
3°C. Similarly under SSP1, at 1.5°C, 2 million people are expected to 
be exposed and vulnerable to crop yield change. Over 20 million are 
exposed and vulnerable to crop yield change in SSP3, increasing to 
854 million people at 3°C (low confidence). Livelihoods deteriorate as 
a result of these impacts, livelihood migration is accelerated, and strife 
and conflict is worsened (medium confidence). {Cross-Chapter Box 9 in 
Chapters 6 and 7, 7.2.2, 7.3.2, Table 7.1, Figure 7.2}
Land-based adaptation and mitigation responses pose risks 
associated with the effectiveness and potential adverse side-
effects of measures chosen (medium confidence). Adverse 
side-effects on food security, ecosystem services and water security 
increase with the scale of bioenergy and bioenergy with carbon 
capture and storage (BECCS) deployment. In a SSP1 future, bioenergy 
and BECCS deployment up to 4  million km2 is compatible with 
sustainability constraints, whereas risks are already high in a SSP3 
future for this scale of deployment. {7.2.3}
There is high confidence that policies addressing vicious 
cycles of poverty, land degradation and greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions implemented in a holistic manner can 
achieve climate-resilient sustainable development. Choice 
and implementation of policy instruments determine future 
climate and land pathways (medium confidence). Sustainable 
development pathways (described in SSP1) supported by effective 
regulation of land use to reduce environmental trade-offs, reduced 
reliance on traditional biomass, low growth in consumption and 
limited meat diets, moderate international trade with connected 
regional markets, and effective GHG mitigation instruments) can 
result in lower food prices, fewer people affected by floods and other 
climatic disruptions, and increases in forested land (high agreement, 
limited evidence) (SSP1). A policy pathway with limited regulation 
of land use, low technology development, resource intensive 
consumption, constrained trade, and ineffective GHG mitigation 
instruments can result in food price increases, and significant loss of 
forest (high agreement, limited evidence) (SSP3). {3.7.5, 7.2.2, 7.3.4, 
7.5.5, 7.5.6, Table 7.1, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapters 6 and  7, 
Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 7}
Delaying deep mitigation in other sectors and shifting the 
burden to the land sector, increases the risk associated with 
adverse effects on food security and ecosystem services (high 
confidence). The consequences are an increased pressure on land 
with higher risk of mitigation failure and of temperature overshoot 
and a transfer of the burden of mitigation and unabated climate 
change to future generations. Prioritising early decarbonisation with 
minimal reliance on carbon dioxide removal (CDR) decreases the risk 
of mitigation failure (high confidence). {2.5, 6.2, 6.4, 7.2.1, 7.2.2, 
7.2.3, 7.5.6, 7.5.7, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapters 6 and 7}
Trade-offs can occur between using land for climate mitigation 
or Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 (affordable clean

energy) with biodiversity, food, groundwater and riverine 
ecosystem services (medium confidence). There is medium 
confidence that trade-offs currently do not figure into climate policies 
and decision making. Small hydro power installations (especially in 
clusters) can impact downstream river ecological connectivity for 
fish (high agreement, medium evidence). Large scale solar farms 
and wind turbine installations can impact endangered species and 
disrupt habitat connectivity (medium agreement, medium evidence). 
Conversion of rivers for transportation can disrupt fisheries and 
endangered species (through dredging and traffic) (medium 
agreement, low evidence). {7.5.6}
The full mitigation potential assessed in this report will only be 
realised if agricultural emissions are included in mainstream 
climate policy (high agreement, high evidence). Carbon markets 
are theoretically more cost-effective than taxation but challenging 
to implement in the land-sector (high confidence) Carbon pricing 
(through carbon markets or carbon taxes) has the potential to be 
an effective mechanism to reduce GHG emissions, although it 
remains relatively untested in agriculture and food systems. Equity 
considerations can be balanced by a mix of both market and non-
market mechanisms (medium evidence, medium agreement). 
Emissions leakage could be reduced by multi-lateral action (high 
agreement, medium evidence). {7.4.6, 7.5.5, 7.5.6, Cross-Chapter 
Box 9 in Chapters 6 and 7}
A suite of coherent climate and land policies advances 
the goal of the Paris Agreement and the land-related SDG 
targets on poverty, hunger, health, sustainable cities and 
communities, responsible consumption and production, 
and life on land. There is high confidence that acting early will 
avert or minimise risks, reduce losses and generate returns 
on investment. The economic costs of action on sustainable land 
management (SLM), mitigation, and adaptation are less than the 
consequences of inaction for humans and ecosystems (medium 
confidence). Policy portfolios that make ecological restoration more 
attractive, people more resilient – expanding financial inclusion, 
flexible carbon credits, disaster risk and health insurance, social 
protection and adaptive safety nets, contingent finance and reserve 
funds, and universal access to early warning systems – could save 
100 billion USD a year, if implemented globally. {7.3.1, 7.4.7, 7.4.8, 
7.5.6, Cross-Chapter Box 10 in Chapter 7}
Coordination of policy instruments across scales, levels, and 
sectors advances co-benefits, manages land and climate risks, 
advances food security, and addresses equity concerns (medium 
confidence). Flood resilience policies are mutually reinforcing 
and include flood zone mapping, financial incentives to move, and 
building restrictions, and insurance. Sustainability certification, 
technology transfer, land-use standards and secure land tenure 
schemes, integrated with early action and preparedness, advance 
response options. SLM improves with investment in agricultural 
research, environmental farm practices, agri-environmental payments, 
financial support for sustainable agricultural water infrastructure 
(including dugouts), agriculture emission trading, and elimination 
of agricultural subsidies (medium confidence). Drought resilience 
policies (including drought preparedness planning, early warning and 
monitoring, improving water use efficiency), synergistically improve 
agricultural producer livelihoods and foster SLM. {3.7.5, Cross-
Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 3, 7.4.3, 7.4.6, 7.5.6, 7.4.8, , 7.5.6, 7.6.3}
Technology transfer in land-use sectors offers new 
opportunities for adaptation, mitigation, international 
cooperation, R&D collaboration, and local engagement 
(medium confidence). International cooperation to modernise the 
traditional biomass sector will free up both land and labour for more 
productive uses. Technology transfer can assist the measurement 
and accounting of emission reductions by developing countries. 
{7.4.4, 7.4.6, Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 7} 
Measuring progress towards goals is important in decision-
making and adaptive governance to create common 
understanding and advance policy effectiveness (high 
agreement, medium evidence). Measurable indicators, selected 
with the participation of people and supporting data collection, 
are useful for climate policy development and decision-making. 
Indicators include the SDGs, nationally determined contributions 
(NDCs), land degradation neutrality (LDN) core indicators, carbon 
stock measurement, measurement and monitoring for REDD+, 
metrics for measuring biodiversity and ecosystem services, and 
governance capacity. {7.5.5, 7.5.7, 7.6.4, 7.6.6} 
The complex spatial, cultural and temporal dynamics of risk 
and uncertainty in relation to land and climate interactions 
and food security, require a flexible, adaptive, iterative 
approach to assessing risks, revising decisions and policy 
instruments (high confidence). Adaptive, iterative decision making 
moves beyond standard economic appraisal techniques to new 
methods such as dynamic adaptation pathways with risks identified 
by trigger points through indicators. Scenarios can provide valuable 
information at all planning stages in relation to land, climate and 
food; adaptive management addresses uncertainty in scenario 
planning with pathway choices made and reassessed to respond 
to new information and data as it becomes available. {3.7.5, 7.4.4, 
7.5.2, 7.5.3, 7.5.4, 7.5.7, 7.6.1, 7.6.3}
Indigenous and local knowledge (ILK) can play a key role in 
understanding climate processes and impacts, adaptation to 
climate change, sustainable land management (SLM) across 
different ecosystems, and enhancement of food security 
(high confidence). ILK is context-specific, collective, informally 
transmitted, and multi-functional, and can encompass factual 
information about the environment and guidance on management 
of resources and related rights and social behaviour. ILK can be 
used in decision-making at various scales and levels, and exchange 
of experiences with adaptation and mitigation that include ILK is 
both a requirement and an entry strategy for participatory climate 
communication and action. Opportunities exist for integration of ILK 
with scientific knowledge. {7.4.1, 7.4.5, 7.4.6, 7.6.4, Cross-Chapter 
Box 13 in Chapter 7}

synergies, reduce trade-offs in SLM (medium confidence), 
and overcomes barriers to adaptation and mitigation (high 
confidence). Improvements to SLM are achieved by: (i) engaging 
people in citizen science by mediating and facilitating landscape 
conservation planning, policy choice, and early warning systems 
(medium confidence); (ii) involving people in identifying problems 
(including species decline, habitat loss, land-use change in 
agriculture, food production and forestry), selection of indicators, 
collection of climate data, land modelling, agricultural innovation 
opportunities. When social learning is combined with collective 
action, transformative change can occur addressing tenure issues 
and changing land-use practices (medium confidence). Meaningful 
participation overcomes barriers by opening up policy and science 
surrounding climate and land decisions to inclusive discussion that 
promotes alternatives. {3.7.5, 7.4.1, 7.4.9; 7.5.1, 7.5.4, 7.5.5, 7.5.7, 
7.6.4, 7.6.6}
Empowering women can bolster synergies among household 
food security and SLM (high confidence). This can be achieved 
with policy instruments that account for gender differences. The 
overwhelming presence of women in many land based activities 
including agriculture provides opportunities to mainstream gender 
policies, overcome gender barriers, enhance gender equality, and 
increase SLM and food security (high confidence). Policies that 
address barriers include gender qualifying criteria and gender 
appropriate delivery, including access to financing, information, 
technology, government transfers, training, and extension may be 
built into existing women’s programmes, structures (civil society 
groups) including collective micro enterprise (medium confidence). 
{Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 7}
The significant social and political changes required for 
sustainable land use, reductions in demand and land-based 
mitigation efforts associated with climate stabilisation require 
a wide range of governance mechanisms. The expansion and 
diversification of land use and biomass systems and markets requires 
hybrid governance: public-private partnerships, transnational, 
polycentric, and state governance to insure opportunities are 
maximised, trade-offs are managed equitably and negative impacts 
are minimised (medium confidence). {7.4.6, 7.6.2, 7.6.3, Cross-
Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 6}
Land tenure systems have implications for both adaptation 
and mitigation, which need to be understood within specific 
socio-economic and legal contexts, and may themselves 
be impacted by climate change and climate action (limited 
evidence, high agreement). Land policy (in a diversity of forms 
beyond focus on freehold title) can provide routes to land security 
and facilitate or constrain climate action, across cropping, rangeland, 
forest, freshwater ecosystems and other systems. Large-scale land 
acquisitions are an important context for the relations between 
tenure security and climate change, but their scale, nature and 
implications are imperfectly understood. There is medium confidence 
that land titling and recognition programmes, particularly those that 
authorize and respect indigenous and communal tenure, can lead 
to improved management of forests, including for carbon storage. 
Strong public coordination (government and public administration) 
can integrate land policy with national policies on adaptation and 
reduce sensitivities to climate change. {7.6.2; 7.6.3; 7.6.4, 7.6.5} 
Significant gaps in knowledge exist when it comes to 
understanding the effectiveness of policy instruments and 
institutions related to land-use management, forestry, 
agriculture and bioenergy. Interdisciplinary research is needed 
on the impacts of policies and measures in land sectors. 
Knowledge gaps are due in part to the highly contextual and local 
nature of land and climate measures and the long time periods 
needed to evaluate land-use change in its socio-economic frame, as 
compared to technological investments in energy or industry that 
are somewhat more comparable. Significant investment is needed 
in monitoring, evaluation and assessment of policy impacts across 
different sectors and levels. {7.7}
7.1 
Introduction and relation 
to other chapters
Land is integral to human habitation and livelihoods, providing food 
and resources, and also serves as a source of identity and cultural 
meaning. However, the combined impacts of climate change, 
desertification, land degradation and food insecurity pose obstacles 
to resilient development and the achievement of the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs). This chapter reviews and assesses 
literature on risk and uncertainty surrounding land and climate 
change, policy instruments and decision-making that seek to address 
those risks and uncertainties, and governance practices that advance 
the response options with co-benefits identified in Chapter 6, lessen 
the socio-economic impacts of climate change and reduce trade-offs, 
and advance SLM. 
7.1.1 
Findings of previous IPCC 
assessments and reports
This chapter builds on earlier assessments contained in several 
chapters of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (the contributions of 
both Working Groups II and III), the IPCC Special Report on Managing 
the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate 
Change Adaptation (SREX) (IPCC 2012), and the IPCC Special Report 
on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR15) (IPCC 2018a). The findings most 
relevant to decision-making on and governance of responses to land-
climate challenges are set out in Box 7.1.

Climate change and sustainable development pathways
“Climate change poses a moderate threat to current sustainable development and a severe threat to future sustainable development” 
(Denton et al. 2014; Fleurbaey et al. 2014). 
Significant transformations may be required for climate-resilient pathways (Denton et al. 2014; Jones et al. 2014).
The design of climate policy is influenced by (i) differing ways that individuals and organisations perceive risks and uncertainties, and 
(ii) the consideration of a diverse array of risks and uncertainties – as well as human and social responses – which may be difficult 
to measure, are of low probability but which would have a significant impact if they occurred (Kunreuther et al. 2014; Fleurbaey et al. 
2014; Kolstad et al. 2014).
Building climate-resilient pathways requires iterative, continually evolving and complementary processes at all levels of government 
(Denton et al. 2014; Kunreuther et al. 2014; Kolstad et al. 2014; Somanthan et al. 2014; Lavell et al. 2012).
Important aspects of climate-resilient policies include local level institutions, decentralisation, participatory governance, iterative 
learning, integration of local knowledge, and reduction of inequality (Dasgupta et al. 2014; Lavell et al. 2012; Cutter et al. 2012b; 
O’Brien et al. 2012; Roy et al. 2018). 
Climate action and sustainable development are linked: adaptation has co-benefits for sustainable development, while “sustainable 
development supports, and often enables, the fundamental societal and systems transitions and transformations that help limit 
global warming” (IPCC 2018a). Redistributive policies that shield the poor and vulnerable can resolve trade-offs between mitigation 
objectives and the hunger, poverty and energy access SDGs.
Land and rural livelihoods
Policies and institutions relating to land, including land tenure, can contribute to the vulnerability of rural people, and constrain 
adaptation. Climate policies, such as encouraging cultivation of biofuels, or payments under REDD+, will have significant secondary 
impacts, both positive and negative, in some rural areas (Dasgupta et al. 2014).
“Sustainable land management is an effective disaster risk reduction tool” (Cutter et al. 2012a).
Risk and risk management
A variety of emergent risks not previously assessed or recognised, can be identified by taking into account: (i) the “interactions 
of climate change impacts on one sector with changes in exposure and vulnerability, as well as adaptation and mitigation actions”, 
and (ii) “indirect, trans-boundary, and long-distance impacts of climate change” including price spikes, migration, conflict and the 
unforeseen impacts of mitigation measures (Oppenheimer et al. 2014).
“Under any plausible scenario for mitigation and adaptation, some degree of risk from residual damages is unavoidable” (Oppenheimer 
et al. 2014).
Decision-making
“Risk management provides a useful framework for most climate change decision-making. Iterative risk management is most suitable 
in situations characterised by large uncertainties, long time frames, the potential for learning over time, and the influence of both 
climate as well as other socio-economic and biophysical changes” (Jones et al. 2014). 
“Decision support is situated at the intersection of data provision, expert knowledge, and human decision making at a range of scales 
from the individual to the organisation and institution” (Jones et al. 2014).
“Scenarios are a key tool for addressing uncertainty”, either through problem exploration or solution exploration (Jones et al. 2014).

While the term risk continues to be subject to a growing number 
of definitions in different disciplines and sectors, this chapter takes 
as a starting point the definition used in the IPCC Special Report 
on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR15) (IPCC 2018a), which reflects 
definitions used by both Working Group II and Working Group III 
in the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5): “The potential for adverse 
consequences where something of value is at stake and where 
the occurrence and degree of an outcome is uncertain” (Allwood 
et al. 2014; Oppenheimer et al. 2014). The SR15 definition further 
specifies: “In the context of the assessment of climate impacts, 
the term risk is often used to refer to the potential for adverse 
consequences of a climate-related hazard, or of adaptation or 
mitigation responses to such a hazard, on lives, livelihoods, 
health and well-being, ecosystems and species, economic, social 
and cultural assets, services (including ecosystem services), and 
infrastructure.” In SR15, as in the IPCC SREX and AR5 WGII, risk 
is conceptualised as resulting from the interaction of vulnerability 
(of the affected system), its exposure over time (to a hazard), 
as well as the (climate-related) impact and the likelihood of its 
occurrence (AR5 2014; IPCC 2018a, 2012). In the context of SRCCL, 
risk must also be seen as including risks to the implementation of 
responses to land–climate challenges from economic, political and 
governance factors. Climate and land risks must be seen in relation 
to human values and objectives (Denton et al. 2014). Risk is closely 
associated with concepts of vulnerability and resilience, which 
are themselves subject to differing definitions across different 
knowledge communities. 
Risks examined in this chapter arise from more than one of the major 
land–climate–society challenges (desertification, land degradation, 
and food insecurity), or partly stem from mitigation or adaptation 
actions, or cascade across different sectors or geographical 
locations. They could thus be seen as examples of emergent risks: 
“aris[ing] from the interaction of phenomena in a complex system” 
(Oppenheimer et al. 2014, p.1052). Stranded assets in the coal 
sector due to proliferation of renewable energy and government 
response could be examples of emergent risks (Saluja and Singh 
2018; Marcacci 2018). Additionally, the absence of an explicit goal 
for conserving freshwater ecosystems and ecosystem services in 
SDGs (in contrast to a goal – ‘life below water’ – exclusively for 
marine biodiversity) is related to its trade-offs with energy and 
irrigation goals, thus posing a substantive risk (Nilsson et al. 2016b; 
Vörösmarty et al. 2010).
Governance is not previously well defined in IPCC reports, but 
is used here to include all of the processes, structures, rules and 
traditions that govern, which may be undertaken by actors including 
governments, markets, organisations, or families (Bevir 2011), with 
particular reference to the multitude of actors operating in respect 
of land–climate interactions. Such definitions of governance allow 
for it to be decoupled from the more familiar concept of government 
and studied in the context of complex human–environment relations 
and environmental and resource regimes (Young 2017a). Governance 
involves the interactions among formal and informal institutions 
through which people articulate their interests, exercise their legal 
rights, meet their legal obligations, and mediate their differences 
(UNDP 1997). 
7.1.3 
Roadmap to the chapter
This chapter firstly discusses risks and their drivers, at various scales, 
in relation to land-climate challenges, including risks associated with 
responses to climate change (Section 7.2). The consequences of the 
principal risks in economic and human terms, and associated concepts 
such as tipping points and windows of opportunity for response are 
then described (Section  7.3). Policy responses at different scales 
to different land-climate risks, and barriers to implementation, are 
described in Section 7.4, followed by an assessment of approaches 
to decision-making on land-climate challenges (Section  7.5), 
and questions of the governance of the land-climate interface 
(Section 7.6). Key uncertainties and knowledge gaps are identified 
in Section 7.7.
Box 7.1 (continued)
Governance
There is no single approach to adaptation planning and both top-down and bottom-up approaches are widely recognised.“Institutional 
dimensions in adaptation governance play a key role in promoting the transition from planning to implementation of adaptation” 
(Mimura et al. 2014). Adaptation is also essential at all scales, including adaptation by local governments, businesses, communities 
and individuals (Denton et al. 2014).
“Strengthened multi-level governance, institutional capacity, policy instruments, technological innovation and transfer and mobilisation 
of finance, and changes in human behaviour and lifestyles are enabling conditions that enhance the feasibility of mitigation and 
adaptation options for 1.5°C-consistent systems transitions” (IPCC 2018b). 
Governance is key for vulnerability and exposure represented by institutionalised rule systems and habitualised behaviour and norms 
that govern society and guide actors, and “it is essential to improve knowledge on how to promote adaptive governance within the 
framework of risk assessment and risk management” (Cardona 2012).

7.2 
Climate-related risks for land-based 
human systems and ecosystems
This section examines risks that climate change poses to selected 
land-based human systems and ecosystems, and then further 
explores how social and economic choices, as well as responses 
to climate change, will exacerbate or lessen risks. ‘Risk’ is defined 
as the potential for adverse consequences for human or ecological 
systems, recognising the diversity of values and objectives associated 
with such systems. The interacting processes of climate change, land 
change, and unprecedented social and technological change, pose 
significant risk to climate-resilient sustainable development. The 
pace, intensity, and scale of these sizeable risks affect the central 
issues in sustainable development: access to ecosystem services (ES) 
and resources essential to sustain people in given locations; how and 
where people live and work; and the means to safeguard human 
well-being against disruptions (Warner et al. 2019). In the context of 
climate change, adverse consequences can arise from the potential 
impacts of climate change as well as human responses to climate 
change. Relevant adverse consequences include those on lives, 
livelihoods, health and well-being, economic, social and cultural 
assets and investments, infrastructure, services (including  ES), 
ecosystems and species (see Glossary). Risks result from dynamic 
interactions between climate-related hazards with the exposure 
and vulnerability of the affected human or ecological system to 
the hazards. Hazards, exposure and vulnerability may change over 
time and space as a result of socio-economic changes and human 
decision-making (‘risk management’). Numerous uncertainties exist 
in the scientific understanding of risk (Section 1.2.2).
7.2.1 
Assessing risk 
This chapter applies and further improves methods used in previous 
IPCC reports including AR5 and the Special Report on Global Warming 
of 1.5°C (SR15) to assess risks. Evidence is drawn from published 
studies, which include observations of impacts from human-induced 
climate change and model projections for future climate change. 
Such projections are based on Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), 
Earth System Models (ESMs), regional climate models and global 
or regional impact models examining the impact of climate change 
on various indicators (Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1). Results of 
laboratory and field experiments that examine impacts of specific 
changes were also included in the review. Risks under different 
future socio-economic conditions were assessed using recent 
publications based on Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs). 
SSPs provide storylines about future socio-economic development 
and can be combined with Representative Concentration Pathways 
RCPs (Riahi et al. 2017) (Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapters 6 and 7). 
Risk arising from land-based mitigation and adaptation choices is 
assessed using studies examining the adverse side effects of such 
responses (Section 7.2.3).
Burning embers figures introduced in the IPCC Third Assessment 
Report through to the Fifth Assessment Report, and the SR15, were 
developed for this report to illustrate risks at different temperature 
thresholds. Key components involved in desertification, land 
degradation and food security were identified, based on discussions 
with authors in Chapters 3, 4 and 5. The final list of burning embers 
in Figure 7.1 is not intended to be fully comprehensive, but represents 
processes for which sufficient literature exists to make expert 
judgements. Literature used in the burning embers assessment 
is summarised in tables in Supplementary Material. Following an 
approach articulated in O’Neill, B.C. et al., (2017), expert judgements 
were made to assess thresholds of risk (O’Neill, B.C. et al., 2017). To 
further strengthen replicability of the method, a predefined protocol 
based on a modified Delphi process was followed (Mukherjee et al. 
2015). This included two separate anonymous rating rounds, feedback 
in between rounds and a group discussion to achieve consensus. 
Burning embers provide ranges of a given variable (typically global 
mean near-surface air temperature) for which risks transitions 
within four categories: undetectable, moderate, high and very high. 
Moderate risk indicates that impacts are detectable and attributable 
to climate-related factors. High risk indicates widespread impacts 
on larger numbers or proportion of population/area, but with the 
potential to adapt or recover. Very high risk indicates severe and 
possibly irreversible impacts with limited ability of societies and 
ecosystems to adapt to them. Transitions between risk categories 
were assigned confidence levels based on the amount, and quality, 
of academic literature supporting judgements: L = low, M = medium, 
and H = high. Further details of the procedure are provided in 
Supplementary Material. 
7.2.2 
Risks to land systems arising 
from climate change
At current levels of global mean surface temperature (GMST) 
increase, impacts are already detectable across numerous land-
related systems (high confidence) (Chapters 2, 3, 4 and 6). There 
is high confidence that unabated future climate change will result 
in continued changes to processes involved in desertification, land 
degradation and food security, including: water scarcity in drylands; 
soil erosion; coastal degradation; vegetation loss; fire; permafrost 
thaw; and access, stability, utilisation and physical availability of 
food (Figure 7.1). These changes will increase risks to food systems, 
the health of humans and ecosystems, livelihoods, the value of land, 
infrastructure and communities (Section 7.3). Details of the risks, and 
their transitions, are described in the following subsections.
7.2.2.1 
Crop yield in low latitudes
There is high confidence that climate change has resulted in decreases 
in yield (of wheat, rice, maize, soy) and reduced food availability in 
low-latitude regions (IPCC, 2018) (Section 5.2.2). Countries in low-
latitude regions are particularly vulnerable because the livelihoods 
of high proportions of the population are dependent on agricultural 
production. Even moderate temperature increases (1°C to 2°C) 
have negative yield impacts for major cereals, because the climate 
of many tropical agricultural regions is already quite close to the 
high-temperature thresholds for suitable production of these cereals 
(Rosenzweig et al. 2014). Thus, by 1.5°C global mean temperature 
GMT, or between approximately 1.6°C and approximately 2.6°C of 
681

local warming, risks to yields may already transition to high in West 
Africa, Southeast Asia and Central and South America (Faye et al. 2018) 
(medium confi dence). For further information see Section  5.3.2.1. 
By contrast, higher latitudes may initially benefi t from warming as 
well as well higher CO2 concentrations (IPCC 2018a). Wheat yield 
losses are expected to be lower for the USA (−5.5 ± 4.4% per degree 
Celsius) and France (−6.0 ± 4.2% per degree Celsius) compared to 
India (−9.1 ± 5.4% per degree Celsius) (Zhao et al. 2017). Very high 
risks to low-latitude yields may occur between 3°C and 4°C (medium 
confi dence). At these temperatures, catastrophic reductions in crop 
yields may occur, of up to 60% in low latitudes (Rosenzweig et al. 
2014) (Sections  5.2.2 and 5.2.3). Some studies report signifi cant 
population displacement from the tropics related to systemic 
livelihood disruption in agriculture systems (Tittonell 2014; Montaña 
et al. 2016; Huber-Sannwald et al. 2012; Wise et al. 2016; Tanner 
et al. 2015; Mohapatra 2013). However, at higher temperatures of 
warming, all regions of the world face risks of declining yields as 
a result of extreme weather events and reduced heat tolerance of 
maize, rice, wheat and soy (Zhao et al. 2017; IPCC 2018a).

7.2.2.2 
Food supply instability
Stability of food supply is expected to decrease as the magnitude 
and frequency of extreme events increase, disrupting food chains in 
all areas of the world (medium evidence, high agreement) (Wheeler 
and Von Braun 2013; Coates 2013; Puma et al. 2015; Deryng et al. 
2014; Harvey et al. 2014b; Iizumi et al. 2013; Seaman et al. 2014) 
(Sections 5.3.2, 5.3.3, 5.6.2 and 5.7.1). While international trade in 
food is assumed to be a key response for alleviating hunger, historical 
data and economic models suggest that international trade does not 
adequately redistribute food globally to offset yield declines or other 
food shortages when weather extremes reduce crop yields (medium 
confidence) (Schmitz et al. 2012; Chatzopoulos et al. 2019; Marchand 
et al. 2016; Gilbert 2010; Wellesley et al. 2017). When droughts, heat 
waves, floods or other extremes destroy crops, evidence has shown 
that exports are constrained in key producing countries contributing 
to price spikes and social tension in importing countries which reduce 
access to food (medium evidence, medium agreement) (von Uexkull 
et al. 2016; Gleick 2014; Maystadt and Ecker 2014; Kelley et al. 2015; 
Church et al. 2017; Götz et al. 2013; Puma et al. 2015; Willenbockel 
2012; Headey 2011; Distefano et al. 2018; Brooks 2014). There is 
little understanding of how food system shocks cascade through 
a  modern interconnected economy. Reliance on global markets 
may reduce some risks, but the ongoing globalisation of food trade 
networks exposes the world food system to new impacts that have 
not been seen in the past (Sections 5.1.2, 5.2.1, 5.5.2.5, 5.6.5 and 
5.7.1). The global food system is vulnerable to systemic disruptions 
and increasingly interconnected inter-country food dependencies, 
and changes in the frequency and severity of extreme weather 
events may complicate future responses (Puma et al. 2015; Jones and 
Hiller 2017). 
Impacts of climate change are already detectable on food supply 
and access as price and trade reactions have occurred in response to 
heatwaves, droughts and other extreme events (high evidence, high 
agreement) (Noble et al. 2014; O’Neill, B.C. et al., 2017). The impact of 
climate change on food stability is underexplored (Schleussner et al. 
2016; James et al. 2017). However, some literature assesses that 
by about 2035, daily maximum temperatures will exceed the 90th 
percentile of historical (1961–1990) temperatures on 25–30% of days 
(O’Neill, B.C. et al., 2017, Figures 11–17) with negative shocks to food 
stability and world food prices. O’Neill, B.C. et al., (2017) remark that 
in the future, return periods for precipitation events globally (land 
only) will reduce from one-in-20-year (historical) to about one-in-14-
year or less by 2046–2065 in many areas of the world. Domestic 
efforts to insulate populations from food price spikes associated with 
climatic stressors in the mid-2000s have been shown to inadequately 
shield from poverty, and worsen poverty globally (Diffenbaugh et al. 
2012; Meyfroidt et al. 2013; Hertel et al. 2010). The transition to high 
risk is estimated to occur around 1.4°C, possibly by 2035, due to 
changes in temperature and heavy precipitation events (medium 
confidence) (O’Neill, B.C. et al.. 2017; Fritsche et al. 2017; Harvey 
et al. 2014b). Very high risk may occur between 1.5°C and 2.5°C 
(medium confidence) and 4°C of warming is considered catastrophic 
(IPCC 2018c; Noble et al. 2014) for food stability and access because 
a combination of extreme events, compounding political and social 
factors, and shocks to crop yields can heavily constrain options to 
ensure food security in import-reliant countries. 
7.2.2.3 
Soil erosion
Soil erosion increases risks of economic loss and declines in 
livelihoods due to reduced land productivity. In the EU, on-site costs 
of soil erosion by wind has been reported at an average of 55 USD 
per hectare annually, but up to 450  USD per hectare for sugar 
beet and oilseed rape (Middleton et al. 2017). Farmers in the Dapo 
watershed in Ethiopia lose about 220 USD per hectare of maize due 
to loss of nitrogen through soil erosion (Erkossa et al. 2015). Soil 
erosion not only increases crop loss but has been shown to have 
reduced household food supply with older farmers most vulnerable 
to losses from erosion (Ighodaro et al. 2016). Erosion also results in 
increased risks to human health, through air pollution from aerosols 
(Middleton et al. 2017), and brings risks of reduced ES including 
supporting services related to soil formation. 
At current levels of warming, changes in erosion are already detected 
in many regions. Attribution to climate change is challenging as there 
are other powerful drivers of erosion (e.g., land use), limited global-
scale studies (Li and Fang 2016a; Vanmaercke et al. 2016a) and the 
absence of formal detection and attribution studies (Section 4.2.3). 
However, studies have found an increase in short-duration and 
high-intensity precipitation, due to anthropogenic climate change, 
which is a causative factor for soil erosion (Lenderink and van 
Meijgaard 2008; Li and Fang 2016b). High risks of erosion may occur 
between 2°C and 3.5°C (low confidence) as continued increases in 
intense precipitation are projected at these temperature thresholds 
(Fischer and Knutti 2015) in many regions. Warming also reduces 
soil organic matter, diminishing resistance against erosion. There 
is low confidence concerning the temperature threshold at which 
risks become very high due to large regional differences and limited 
global-scale studies (Li and Fang 2016b; Vanmaercke et al. 2016b) 
(Section 4.4).
7.2.2.4 
Dryland water scarcity
Water scarcity in drylands contributes to changes in desertification 
and hazards such as dust storms, increasing risks of economic loss, 
declines in livelihoods of communities and negative health effects 
(high confidence) (Section  3.1.3). Further information specific to 
costs and impacts of water scarcity and droughts is detailed in Cross-
Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 3.
The IPCC AR5 report and the SR15 concluded that there is low 
confidence in the direction of drought trends since 1950 at the 
global scale. While these reports did not assess water scarcity 
with a specific focus on drylands, they indicated that there is high 
confidence in observed drought increases in some regions of the 
world, including in the Mediterranean and West Africa (IPCC AR5) 
and that there is medium confidence that anthropogenic climate 
change has contributed to increased drying in the Mediterranean 
region (including southern Europe, northern Africa and the western 
Asia and the Middle east) and that this tendency will continue to 
increase under higher levels of global warming (IPCC 2018d). Some 
683
Risk management and decision-making in relation to sustainable development

parts of the drylands have experienced decreasing precipitation over 
recent decades (IPCC AR5) (Chapter 3 and Section 3.2), consistent 
with the fact that climate change is implicated in desertification 
trends in some regions (Section  3.2.2). Dust storms, linked to 
changes in precipitation and vegetation, appear to be occurring with 
greater frequency in some deserts and their margins (Goudie 2014) 
(Section 3.3.1). There is therefore high confidence that the transition 
from undetectable to moderate risk associated with water scarcity 
in drylands occurred in recent decades in the range 0.7°C to 1°C 
(Figure 7.1). 
Between 1.5°C and 2.5°C, the risk level is expected to increase from 
moderate to high (medium confidence). Globally, at 2°C an additional 
8% of the world population (of population in 2000) will be exposed 
to new forms of or aggravated water scarcity (IPCC 2018d). However, 
at 2°C, the annual warming over drylands will reach 3.2°C–4.0°C, 
implying about 44% more warming over drylands than humid lands 
(Huang et al. 2017), thus potentially aggravating water scarcity 
issues through increased evaporative demand. Byers et al. (2018a) 
estimate that 3–22% of the drylands population (range depending 
on socio-economic conditions) will be exposed and vulnerable 
to water stress. The Mediterranean, North Africa and the Eastern 
Mediterranean will be particularly vulnerable to water shortages, and 
expansion of desert terrain and vegetation is predicted to occur in 
the Mediterranean biome, an unparalleled change in the last 10,000 
years (medium confidence) (IPCC 2018d). At 2.5°C–3.5°C risks are 
expected to become very high with migration from some drylands 
resulting as the only adaptation option (medium confidence). 
Scarcity of water for irrigation is expected to increase, in particular 
in Mediterranean regions, with limited possibilities for adaptation 
(Haddeland et al. 2014).
7.2.2.5 
Vegetation degradation
There are clear links between climate change and vegetation cover 
changes, tree mortality, forest diseases, insect outbreaks, forest 
fires, forest productivity and net ecosystem biome production (Allen 
et al. 2010; Bentz et al. 2010; Anderegg et al. 2013; Hember et al. 
2017; Song et al. 2018; Sturrock et al. 2011). Forest dieback, often a 
result of drought and temperature changes, not only produces risks 
to forest ecosystems but also to people with livelihoods dependent 
on forests. A 50-year study of temperate forest, dominated by beech 
(Fagus sylvatica L.), documented a 33% decline in basal area and a 
70% decline in juvenile tree species, possibly as a result of interacting 
pressures of drought, overgrazing and pathogens (Martin et al. 
2015). There is high confidence that such dieback impacts ecosystem 
properties and services including soil microbial community structure 
(Gazol et al. 2018). Forest managers and users have reported 
negative emotional impacts from forest dieback such as pessimism 
about losses, hopelessness and fear (Oakes et al. 2016). Practices and 
policies such as forest classification systems, projection of growth, 
yield and models for timber supply are already being affected by 
climate change (Sturrock et al. 2011).
While risks to ecosystems and livelihoods from vegetation 
degradation are already detectable at current levels of GMT 
increase, risks are expected to reach high levels between 1.6°C 
and 2.6°C (medium confidence). Significant uncertainty exists 
due to countervailing factors: CO2 fertilisation encourages forest 
expansion but increased drought, insect outbreaks, and fires result 
in dieback (Bonan 2008; Lindner et al. 2010). The combined effects 
of temperature and precipitation change, with CO2 fertilisation, make 
future risks to forests very location specific. It is challenging therefore 
to make global estimates. However, even locally specific studies make 
clear that very high risks occur between 2.6°C and 4°C (medium 
confidence). Australian tropical rainforests experience significant loss 
of biodiversity with 3.5°C increase. At this level of increase there are 
no areas with greater than 30 species, and all endemics disappear 
from low- and mid-elevation regions (Williams et al. 2003). Mountain 
ecosystems are particularly vulnerable (Loarie et al. 2009).
7.2.2.6 
Fire damage
Increasing fires result in heightened risks to infrastructure, 
accelerated erosion, altered hydrology, increased air pollution, and 
negative mental health impacts. Fire not only destroys property but 
induces changes in underlying site conditions (ground cover, soil 
water repellency, aggregate stability and surface roughness) which 
amplifies runoff and erosion, increasing future risks to property 
and human lives during extreme rainfall events (Pierson and 
Williams 2016). Dust and ash from fires can impact air quality in a 
wide area. For example, a dust plume from a fire in Idaho, USA, in 
September 2010 was visible in MODIS satellite imagery and extended 
at least 100 km downwind of the source area (Wagenbrenner et al. 
2013). Individuals can suffer from property damage or direct injury, 
psychological trauma, depression, and post traumatic stress disorder, 
and have reported negative impacts to well-being from loss of 
connection to landscape (Paveglio et al. 2016; Sharples et al. 2016a). 
Costs of large wildfires in the USA can exceed 20 million USD per day 
(Pierson et al. 2011) and has been estimated at 8.5 billion USD per 
year in Australia (Sharples et al. 2016b). Globally, human exposure 
to fire will increase due to projected population growth in fire-prone 
regions (Knorr et al. 2016a).
It is not clear how quickly, or even if, systems can recover from fires. 
Longevity of effects may differ depending on cover recruitment 
rate and soil conditions, recovering in one to two seasons or over 
10  growing seasons (Pierson et al. 2011). In Russia, one-third of 
forest area affected by fires turned into unproductive areas where 
natural reforestation is not possible within 2–3 lifecycles of major 
forest forming species (i.e., 300–600 years) (Shvidenko et al. 2012).
Risks under current warming levels are already moderate as 
anthropogenic climate change has caused significant increases 
in fire area (high confidence) due to availability of detection and 
attribution studies) (Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 2). This has 
been detected and attributed regionally, notably in the western USA 
(Abatzoglou and Williams 2016; Westerling et al. 2006; Dennison et 
al. 2014), Indonesia (Fernandes et al. 2017) and other regions (Jolly 
et al. 2015). Regional increases have been observed despite a global-
average declining trend induced by human fire-suppression strategies, 
especially in savannahs (Yang et al. 2014a; Andela et al. 2017).

High risks of fire may occur between 1.3°C and 1.7°C (medium 
confidence). Studies note heightened risks above 1.5°C as fire, 
weather, and land prone to fire increase (Abatzoglou et al. 2019a), 
with medium confidence in this transition, due to complex interplay 
between (i) global warming, (ii) CO2-fertilisation, and (iii) human/
economic factors affecting fire risk. Canada, the USA and the 
Mediterranean may be particularly vulnerable as the combination 
of increased fuel due to CO2 fertilisation, and weather conditions 
conducive to fire increase risks to people and property. Some studies 
show substantial effects at 3°C (Knorr et al. 2016b; Abatzoglou 
et al. 2019b), indicating a  transition to very high risks (medium 
confidence). At high warming levels, climate change may become 
the primary driver of fire risk in the extratropics (Knorr et al. 2016b; 
Abatzoglou et al. 2019b; Yang et al. 2014b). Pyroconvection activity 
may increase, in areas such as southeast Australia (Dowdy and Pepler 
2018), posing major challenges to adaptation.
7.2.2.7 
Permafrost
There is a  risk of damage to the natural and built environment 
from permafrost thaw-related ground instability. Residential, 
transportation, and industrial infrastructure in the pan-Arctic 
permafrost area are particularly at risk (Hjort et al. 2018). High risks 
already exist at low temperatures (high confidence). Approximately, 
21–37% of Arctic permafrost is projected to thaw under a 1.5°C of 
warming (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2018). This increases to very high 
risk around 2°C (between 1.8°C and 2.3°C) of temperature increase 
since pre-industrial times (medium confidence) with 35–47% of the 
Arctic permafrost thawing (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2018). If climate 
stabilised at 2°C, still approximately 40% of permafrost area would 
be lost (Chadburn et al. 2017), leading to nearly four million people 
and 70% of current infrastructure in the pan-Arctic permafrost area 
exposed to permafrost thaw and high hazard (Hjort et al. 2018). Indeed 
between 2°C and 3°C a collapse of permafrost may occur with a drastic 
biome shift from tundra to boreal forest (Drijfhout et al. 2015; SR15). 
There is mixed evidence of a  tipping point in permafrost collapse, 
leading to enhanced greenhouse gas (GHG) emission – particularly 
methane – between 2°C and 3°C (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2018).
7.2.2.8 
Risks of desertification, land degradation 
and food insecurity under different Future 
Development Pathways
Socio-economic developments and policy choices that govern 
land–climate interactions are an important driver of risk, along with 
climate change (very high confidence). Risks under two different 
Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) were assessed using 
emerging literature. SSP1 is characterised by low population growth, 
reduced inequalities, land-use regulation, low meat consumption, 
and moderate trade (Riahi et al. 2017; Popp et al. 2017a). SSP3 is 
characterised by high population growth, higher inequalities, limited 
land-use regulation, resource-intensive consumption including 
meat-intensive diets, and constrained trade (for further details see 
Chapter  1  and Cross-Chapter Box  9  in Chapters  6 and 7). These 
two SSPs, among the set of five SSPs, were selected because they 
illustrate contrasting futures, ranging from low (SSP1) to high (SSP3) 
challenges to mitigation and adaptation. Figure 7.2 shows that for 
a given global mean temperature (GMT) change, risks are different 
under SSP1 compared to SSP3. In SSP1, global temperature change 
does not increase above 3°C even in the baseline case (i.e., with 
no additional mitigation measures) because in this pathway the 
combination of low population and autonomous improvements, 
for example, in terms of carbon intensity and/or energy intensity, 
effectively act as mitigation measures (Riahi et al. 2017). Thus 
Figure 7.2 does not indicate risks beyond this point in either SSP1 and 
SSP3. Literature based on such socio-economic and climate models 
is still emerging and there is a need for greater research on impacts 
of different pathways. There are few SSP studies exploring aspects of 
desertification and land degradation, but a greater number of SSP 
studies on food security (Supplementary Material). SSP1 reduces the 
vulnerability and exposure of human and natural systems and thus 
limits risks resulting from desertification, land degradation and food 
insecurity compared to SSP3 (high confidence).
Changes to the water cycle due to global warming are an essential 
driver of desertification and of the risks to livelihood, food production 
and vegetation in dryland regions. Changes in water scarcity due 
to climate change have already been detected in some dryland 
regions (Section 7.2.2.4) and therefore the transition to moderate 
risk occurred in recent decades (high confidence). IPCC (2018d) 
noted that in the case of risks to water resources, socio-economic 
drivers are expected to have a greater influence than the changes in 
climate (medium confidence). Indeed, in SSP1 there is only moderate 
risk even at 3°C of warming, due to the lower exposure and 
vulnerability of human population (Hanasaki et al. 2013a; Arnell and 
Lloyd-Hughes 2014; Byers et al. 2018b). Considering drylands only, 
Byers et al. (2018b) estimate, using a time-sampling approach for 
climate change and the 2050 population, that at 1.5°C, 2°C and 3°C, 
the dryland population exposed and vulnerable to water stress in 
SSP1 will be 2%, 3% and 3% respectively, thus indicating relatively 
stable moderate risks. In SSP3, the transition from moderate to high 
risk occurs in the range 1.2°C to 1.5°C (medium confidence) and the 
transition from high to very high risk is in the range 1.5°C to 2.8°C 
(medium confidence). Hanasaki et al. (2013b) found a  consistent 
increase in water stress at higher warming levels due in large part 
to growth in population and demand for energy and agricultural 
commodities, and to a  lesser extent due to hydrological changes 
induced by global warming. In SSP3, Byers et al. (2018b) estimate 
that at 1.5°C, 2°C and 3°C, the population exposed and vulnerable to 
water stress in drylands will steadily increase from 20% to 22% and 
24% respectively, thus indicating overall much higher risks compared 
to SSP1 for the same global warming levels.
SSP studies relevant to land degradation assess risks such as: number 
of people exposed to fire; the costs of floods and coastal flooding; 
and loss of ES including the ability of land to sequester carbon. 
The risks related to permafrost melting (Section  7.2.2.7) are not 
considered here due to the lack of SSP studies addressing this topic. 
Climate change impacts on various components of land degradation 
have already been detected (Sections 7.2.2.3, 7.2.2.5 and 7.2.2.6) 
and therefore the transition from undetectable to moderate risk is 
in the range 0.7°C to 1°C (high confidence). Less than 100 million 
people are exposed to habitat degradation at  1.5°C under SSP1 
in non-dryland regions, increasing to 257  million at 2°C (Byers 
685
Risk management and decision-making in relation to sustainable development 
Chapter 7

et al. 2018). This suggests a gradual transition to high risk in the 
range 1.8°C to 2.8°C, but a low confi dence is attributed due to the 
very limited evidence to constrain this transition.
By contrast in SSP3, there are already 107 million people exposed to 
habitat degradation at 1.5°C, increasing to 1156 million people at 
3°C (Byers et al. 2018b). Furthermore, Knorr et al. (2016b) estimate 
that 646 million people will be exposed to fi re at 2°C warming, the 
main risk driver being the high population growth in SSP3 rather than 
increased burned area due to climate change. Exposure to extreme 
rainfall, a causative factor for soil erosion and fl ooding, also differs 
under SSPs. Under SSP1 up to 14% of the land and population 
experience fi ve-day extreme precipitation events. Similar levels of 
exposure occur at lower temperatures in SSP3 (Zhang et al. 2018b). 
Population exposed to coastal fl ooding is lowest under SSP1 and 
higher under SSP3 with a limited effect of enhanced protection in 
SSP3 already after 2°C warming (Hinkel et al. 2014). The transition 
from high to very high risk will occur at  2.2°Cto  2.8°C in SSP3 
(medium confi dence), whereas this level of risk is not expected to be 
reached in SSP1.
The greatest number of SSP studies explore climate change impacts 
relevant to food security, including population at risk of hunger, food 
price increases, increases in disability adjusted life years (Hasegawa 
et al. 2018a; Wiebe et al. 2015a; van Meijl et al. 2018a; Byers et al. 
2018b). Changes in crop yields and food supply stability have already 
been attributed to climate change (Sections 7.2.2.1 and 7.2.2.2) and 
the transition from undetectable to moderate risk is placed at 0.5°C 
to 1°C (medium confi dence). At 1.5°C, about two million people are 
exposed and vulnerable to crop yield change in SSP1 (Hasegawa et al. 
2018b; Byers et al. 2018b), implying moderate risk. A transition from 
moderate to high risk is expected above 2.5°C (medium confi dence) 
with population at risk of hunger of the order of 100 million (Byers 
et al. 2018b). Under SSP3, high risks already exist at 1.5°C (medium 
confi dence), with 20 million people exposed and vulnerable to crop 
yield change. By 2°C, 178  million are vulnerable and 854  million 
people are vulnerable at 3°C (Byers et al. 2018b). This is supported 
by the higher food prices increase of up to 20% in 2050 in an RCP6.0 
scenario (i.e., slightly below 2°C) in SSP3 compared to up to 5% in 
SSP1 (van Meijl et al. 2018). Furthermore in SSP3, restricted trade 
increase this price effect (Wiebe et al. 2015). In SSP3, the transition

Socio-economic choices can reduce or

as influence the rate of temperature 
increase. The SSP1 pathway illustrates 
a world with low population growth, high 
income and reduced inequalities, food 
produced in low GHG emission systems, 
efective land use regulation and high 
adaptive capacity. The SSP3 pathway has 
the opposite trends. Risks are lower in 
SSP1 compared with SSP3 given the 
same level of GMST increase.

Figure 7.2 |  Risks associated with desertifi cation, land degradation and food security due to climate change and patterns of socio-economic development.
Increasing risks associated with desertifi cation include population exposed and vulnerable to water scarcity in drylands. Risks related to land degradation include increased 
habitat degradation, population exposed to wildfi re and fl oods and costs of fl oods. Risks to food security include availability and access to food, including population at risk of 
hunger, food price increases and increases in disability adjusted life years attributable due to childhood underweight. The risks are assessed for two contrasted socio-economic 
futures (SSP1 and SSP3) under unmitigated climate change {3.6, 4.3.1.2, 5.2.2, 5.2.3, 5.2.4, 5.2.5, 6.2.4, 7.3}. Risks are not indicated beyond 3°C because SSP1 does not 
exceed this level of temperature change.

from high to very high risk is in the range 2°C to 2.7°C (medium 
confidence) while this transition is never reached in SSP1. This 
overall confirms that socio-economic development, by affecting 
exposure and vulnerability, has an even larger effect than climate 
change for future trends in the population at risk of hunger (O’Neill, 
B.C. et al., 2017,  p.32). Changes can also threaten development 
gains (medium confidence). Disability adjusted life years due to 
childhood underweight decline in both SSP1 and SSP3 by 2030 (by 
36.4 million disability adjusted life years in SSP1 and 16.2 million in 
SSP3). However by 2050, disability adjusted life years increase by 
43.7 million in SSP3 (Ishida et al. 2014).
7.2.3 
Risks arising from responses to climate change
7.2.3.1 
Risk associated with land-based adaptation
Land-based adaptation relates to a particular category of adaptation 
measures relying on land management (Sanz et al. 2017). While 
most land-based adaptation options provide co-benefits for climate 
mitigation and other land challenges (Chapter 6 and Section 6.4.1), 
in some contexts adaptation measures can have adverse side effects, 
thus implying a risk to socio-ecological systems.
One example of risk is the possible decrease in farmer income 
when applying adaptive cropland management measures. For 
instance, conservation agriculture including the principle of no-till 
farming, contributes to soil erosion management (Chapter  6  and 
Section 6.2). Yet, no-till management can reduce crop yields in some 
regions, and although this effect is minimised when no-till farming is 
complemented by the other two principles of conservation agriculture 
(residue retention and crop rotation), this could induce a  risk to 
livelihood in vulnerable smallholder farming systems (Pittelkow 
et al. 2015).
Another example is the use of irrigation against water scarcity 
and drought. During the long lasting drought from 2007–2009 
in California, USA, farmers adapted by relying on groundwater 
withdrawal and caused groundwater depletion at unsustainable 
levels (Christian-Smith et al. 2015). The long-term effects of 
irrigation from groundwater may cause groundwater depletion, land 
subsidence, aquifer overdraft, and saltwater intrusion (Tularam and 
Krishna 2009). Therefore, it is expected to increase the vulnerability 
of coastal aquifers to climate change due to groundwater usage 
(Ferguson and Gleeson 2012). The long-term practice of irrigation 
from groundwater may cause a severe combination of potential side 
effects and consequently irreversible results.
7.2.3.2 
Risk associated with land-based mitigation
While historically land-use activities have been a net source of GHG 
emissions, in future decades the land sector will not only need to 
reduce its emissions, but also to deliver negative emissions through 
carbon dioxide removal (CDR) to reach the objective of limiting global 
warming to 2°C or below (Section 2.5). Although land-based mitigation 
in itself is a risk-reduction strategy aiming at abating climate change, 
it also entails risks to humans and ecosystems, depending on the type 
of measures and the scale of deployment. These risks fall broadly into 
two categories: risk of mitigation failure – due to uncertainties about 
mitigation potential, potential for sink reversal and moral hazard; and 
risks arising from adverse side effects – due to increased competition 
for land and water resources. This section focuses specifically on 
bioenergy and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) 
since it is one of the most prominent land-based mitigation strategies 
in future mitigation scenarios (along with large-scale forest expansion, 
which is discussed in Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1). Bioenergy 
and BECCS is assessed in Chapter 6 as being, at large scales, the 
only response option with adverse side effects across all dimensions 
(adaptation, food security, land degradation and desertification) 
(Section 6.4.1).
Risk of mitigation failure. The mitigation potential from bioenergy 
and BECCS is highly uncertain, with estimates ranging from 0.4 to 
11.3 GtCO2e yr–1 for the technical potential, while consideration of 
sustainability constraints suggest an upper end around 5 GtCO2e yr–1 
(Chapter  2, Section  2.6). In comparison, IAM-based mitigation 
pathways compatible with limiting global warming at 1.5°C project 
bioenergy and BECCS deployment exceeding this range (Figure 2.24 
in Chapter 2). There is medium confidence that IAMs currently do 
not reflect the lower end and exceed the upper end of bioenergy 
and BECCS mitigation potential estimates (Anderson and Peters 
2016; Krause et al. 2018; IPCC 2018c), with implications for the risk 
associated with reliance on bioenergy and BECCS deployment for 
climate mitigation.
In addition, land-based CDR strategies are subject to a  risk of 
carbon sink reversal. This implies a  fundamental asymmetry 
between mitigation achieved through fossil fuel emissions reduction 
compared to CDR. While carbon in fossil fuel reserves – in the case 
of avoided fossil fuel emissions – is locked permanently (at least over 
a  time scale of several thousand years), carbon sequestered into 
the terrestrial biosphere – to compensate fossil fuel emissions – is 
subject to various disturbances, in particular from climate change 
and associated extreme events (Fuss et al. 2018; Dooley and 
Kartha 2018). The probability of sink reversal therefore increases 
with climate change, implying that the effectiveness of land-based 
mitigation depends on emission reductions in other sectors and can 
be sensitive to temperature overshoot (high confidence). In the case 
of bioenergy associated with CCS (BECCS), the issue of the long-term 
stability of the carbon storage is linked to technical and geological 
constraints, independent of climate change but presenting risks due 
to limited knowledge and experience (Chapter 6 and Cross-Chapter 
Box 7 in Chapter 6).
Another factor in the risk of mitigation failure, is the moral hazard 
associated with CDR technologies. There is medium evidence and 
medium agreement that the promise of future CDR deployment – 
bioenergy and BECCS in particular – can deter or delay ambitious 
emission reductions in other sectors (Anderson and Peters 2016; 
Markusson et al. 2018a; Shue 2018a). The consequences are an 
increased pressure on land with higher risk of mitigation failure and 
of temperature overshoot, and a transfer of the burden of mitigation 
and unabated climate change to future generations. Overall, there is 
therefore medium evidence and high agreement that prioritising early 
687

decarbonisation with minimal reliance on CDR decreases the risk of 
mitigation failure and increases intergenerational equity (Geden 
et al. 2019; Larkin et al. 2018; Markusson et al. 2018b; Shue 2018b).
Risk from adverse side-effects. At large scales, bioenergy (with 
or without CCS) is expected to increase competition for land, water 
resources and nutrients, thus exacerbating the risks of food insecurity, 
loss of ES and water scarcity (Chapter 6 and Cross-Chapter Box 7 in 
Chapter  6). Figure  7.3 shows the risk level (from undetectable to 
very high, aggregating risks of food insecurity, loss of ES and water 
scarcity) as a function of the global amount of land (million km2) 
used for bioenergy, considering second generation bioenergy. Two 
illustrative future Socio-economic Pathways (SSP1 and SSP3; see 
Section 7.2.2 for more details) are depicted: in SSP3 the competition 
for land is exacerbated compared to SSP1 due to higher food demand 
resulting from larger population growth and higher consumption 
of meat-based products. The literature used in this assessment is 
based on IAM and non-IAM-based studies examining the impact 
of bioenergy crop deployment on various indicators, including food 
security (food prices or population at risk of hunger with explicit 
consideration of exposure and vulnerability), SDGs, ecosystem losses, 
transgression of various planetary boundaries and water consumption 
(see Supplementary Material). Since most of the assessed literature 
is centred around 2050, prevailing demographic and economic 
conditions for this year are used for the risk estimate. An aggregated 
risk metric including risks of food insecurity, loss of ES and water 
scarcity is used because there is no unique relationship between 
bioenergy deployment and the risk outcome for a single system. For 
instance, bioenergy deployment can be implemented in such a way 
that food security is prioritised at the expense of natural ecosystems, 
while the same scale of bioenergy deployment implemented with 
ecosystem safeguards would lead to a  fundamentally different 
outcome in terms of food security (Boysen et al. 2017a). Considered 
as a combined risk, however, the possibility of a negative outcome 
on either food security, ecosystems or both can be assessed with less 
ambiguity and independently of possible implementation choices.
In SSP1, there is medium confi dence that 1  to 4  million km2
can be dedicated to bioenergy production without signifi cant 
risks to food security, ES and water scarcity. At these scales of 
deployment, bioenergy and BECCS could have co-benefi ts for 
instance by contributing to restoration of degraded land and soils 
(Cross-Chapter Box  7 in Chapter  6). Although currently degraded 
soils (up to 20 million km2) represent a large amount of potentially 
available land (Boysen et al. 2017a), trade-offs would occur already 
at smaller scale due to fertiliser and water use (Hejazi et al. 2014; 
Humpenöder et al. 2017; Heck et al. 2018a; Boysen et al. 2017b). 
There is low confi dence that the transition from moderate to high risk 
is in the range 6–8.7 million km2. In SSP1, (Humpenöder et al. 2017) 
found no important impacts on sustainability indicators at a level of 
6.7 million km2, while (Heck et al. 2018b) note that several planetary 
boundaries (biosphere integrity; land-system change; biogeochemical

Figure 7.3 |  Risks associated with bioenergy crop deployment as a land-based mitigation strategy under two SSPs (SSP1 and SSP3). The assessement is 
based on literature investigating the consequences of bioenergy expansion for food security, ecosystem loss and water scarcity. These risk indicators were aggregated as a single 
risk metric in the fi gure. In this context, very high risk indicates that important adverse consequences are expected for all these indicators (more than 100 million people at risk 
of hunger, major ecosystem losses and severe water scarcity issues). The climate scenario considered is a mitigation scenario consistent with limiting global warming at 2°C 
(RCP2.6), however some studies considering other scenarios (e.g., no climate change) were considered in the expert judgement as well as results from other SSPs (e.g., SSP2). 
The literature supporting the assessment is provided in Table SM7.3.

flows; freshwater use) would be exceeded above 8.7 million km2. 
There is very high confidence that all the risk transitions occur at 
lower bioenergy levels in SSP3, implying higher risks associated with 
bioenergy deployment, due to the higher competition for land in this 
pathway. In SSP3, land-based mitigation is therefore strongly limited 
by sustainability constraints such that moderate risk occur already 
between  0.5 and  1.5  million  km2 (medium confidence). There is 
medium confidence that a bioenergy footprint beyond 4 to 8 million 
km2 would entail very high risk with transgression of most planetary 
boundaries (Heck et al. 2018b), strong decline in sustainability 
indicators (Humpenöder et al. 2017) and increase in the population 
at risk of hunger well above 100  million (Fujimori et al. 2018a; 
Hasegawa et al. 2018b).

identified in previous chapters, or in other IPCC reports (with 
supplementary hazards appearing in the Appendix); the regions 
that are exposed or will be exposed to these hazards; components 
of the land-climate systems and societies that are vulnerable to the 
hazard; the risk associated with these impacts and the available

cellulose, charcoal production), land degradation and desertification 
(Section  7.2.2.8), loss of carbon sinks, permafrost destabilisation 
(Section 7.2.2.7), and stranded assets (Section 7.3.4). Other hazards 
such as from failure of carbon storage, renewable energy impacts on 
land use, wild-fire in forest-urban transition context, extreme events

7.3 
Consequences of climate – land change 
for human well-being and sustainable 
development
To further explore what is at stake for human systems, this section 
assesses literature about potential consequences of climate and land 
change for human well-being and ecosystems upon which humans 
depend. Risks described in Section  7.2 have significant social, 
spiritual, and economic ramifications for societies across the world 
and this section explores potential implications of the risks outlined 
above to food security, livelihood systems, migration, ecosystems, 
species, infectious disease, and communities and infrastructure. 
Because food and livelihood systems are deeply tied to one another, 
combinations of climate and land change could pose higher present 
risks to humans and ecosystems than examination of individual 
elements alone might suggest.
7.3.1 
What is at stake for food security?
This section examines risks to food security when access to food 
is jeopardised by yield shortfall and instability related to climate 
stressors. Past assessments of climate change impacts have 
sometimes assumed that, when grain and food yields in one area 
of the world are lower than expected, world trade can redistribute 
food adequately to ensure food security. There is medium confidence 
that severe and spatially extensive climatic stressors pose high risk 
to stability of and access to food for large numbers of people across 
the world.
The 2007–2008, and 2010–2011 droughts in several regions of the 
world resulted in crop yield decline that in turn led some governments 
to protect their domestic grain supplies rather than engaging in free 
trade to offset food shortfalls in other areas of the world. These 
responses cascaded and strongly affected regional and global food 
prices. Simultaneous crop yield impacts combined with trade impacts 
have proven to play a larger and more pervasive role in global food 
crises than previously thought (Sternberg 2012, 2017; Bellemare 
2015; Chatzopoulos et al. 2019). There is high confidence that 
regional climate extremes already have significant negative domestic 
and international economic impacts (Chatzopoulos et al. 2019).
7.3.2 
Risks to where and how people live: Livelihood 
systems and migration
There is high confidence that climate and land change interact with 
social, economic, political, and demographic factors that affect how 
well and where people live (Sudmeier-Rieux et al. 2017; Government 
Office for Science 2011; Laczko and Piguet 2014; Bohra-Mishra and 
Massey 2011; Raleigh et al. 2015; Warner and Afifi 2011; Hugo 2011; 
Warner et al. 2012). There is high evidence and high agreement that 
people move to manage risks and seek opportunities for their safety 
and livelihoods, recognising that people respond to climatic change 
and land-related factors in tandem with other variables (Hendrix and 
Salehyan 2012; Lashley and Warner 2015; van der Geest and Warner 
2014; Roudier et al. 2014; Warner and Afifi 2014; McLeman 2013; 
Kaenzig and Piguet 2014; Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre 
2017; Warner 2018; Cohen and Bradley 2010; Thomas and Benjamin 
2017). People move towards areas offering safety and livelihoods 
such as in rapidly growing settlements in coastal zones (Black et al. 
2013; Challinor et al. 2017; Adger et al. 2013); burgeoning urban 
areas also face changing exposure to combinations of storm surges 
and sea level rise, coastal erosion and soil and water salinisation, and 
land subsidence (Geisler and Currens 2017; Maldonado et al. 2014; 
Bronen and Chapin 2013).
There is medium confidence that livelihood-related migration can 
accelerate in the short-to-medium term when weather-dependent 
livelihood systems deteriorate in relation to changes in precipitation, 
changes in ecosystems, and land degradation and desertification 
(Abid et al. 2016; Scheffran et al. 2012; Fussell et al. 2014; Bettini 
and Gioli 2016; Reyer et al. 2017; Warner and Afifi 2014; Handmer et 
al. 2012; Nawrotzki and Bakhtsiyarava 2017; Nawrotzki et al. 2016; 
Steffen et al. 2015; Black et al. 2013). Slow onset climate impacts 
and risks can exacerbate or otherwise interact with social conflict 
corresponding with movement at larger scales (see Section 7.2.3.2). 
Long-term deterioration in habitability of regions could trigger spatial 
population shifts (Denton et al. 2014).
There is medium evidence and medium agreement that climatic 
stressors can worsen the complex negative impacts of strife and 
conflict (Schleussner et al. 2016; Barnett and Palutikof 2014; Scheffran 
et al. 2012). Climate change and human mobility could be a factor 
that heightens tensions over scarce strategic resources, a  further 
destabilising influence in fragile states experiencing socio-economic 
and political unrest (Carleton and Hsiang 2016a). Conflict and changes 
in weather patterns can worsen conditions for people working in 
rainfed agriculture or subsistence farming, interrupting production 
systems, degrading land and vegetation further (Papaioannou 2016; 
Adano and Daudi 2012). In recent decades, droughts and other 
climatic stressors have compounded livelihood pressures in areas 
already torn by strife (Tessler et al. 2015; Raleigh et al. 2015), such as in 
the Horn of Africa. Seizing of agricultural land by competing factions, 
preventing food distribution in times of shortage have, in this region 
and others, contributed to a triad of food insecurity, humanitarian 
need, and large movements of people (Theisen et al. 2011; Mohmmed 
et al. 2018; Ayeb-Karlsson et al. 2016; von Uexkull et al. 2016; Gleick 
2014; Maystadt and Ecker 2014). People fleeing complex situations 
may return if peaceful conditions can be established. Climate change 
and development responses induced by climate change in countries 
and regions are likely to exacerbate tensions over water and land, 
and its impact on agriculture, fisheries, livestock and drinking water 
downstream. Shared pastoral landscapes used by disadvantaged or 
otherwise vulnerable communities are particularly impacted on by 
conflicts that are likely to become more severe under future climate 
change (Salehyan and Hendrix 2014; Hendrix and Salehyan 2012). 
Extreme events could considerably enhance these risks, in particular 
long-term drying trends (Kelley et al. 2015; Cutter et al. 2012a). There 
is medium evidence and medium agreement that governance is key 
in magnifying or moderating climate change impact and conflict 
(Bonatti et al. 2016).

There is low evidence and medium agreement that longer-term 
deterioration in the habitability of regions could trigger spatial 
population shifts (Seto 2011). Heat waves, rising sea levels that 
salinise and inundate coastal and low-lying aquifers and soils, 
desertification, loss of geologic sources of water such as glaciers 
and freshwater aquifers could affect many regions of the world and 
put life-sustaining ecosystems under pressure to support human 
populations (Flahaux and De Haas 2016; Chambwera et al. 2015; 
Tierney et al. 2015; Lilleør and Van den Broeck 2011).
7.3.3 
Risks to humans from disrupted 
ecosystems and species
Risks of loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services (ES)
Climate change poses significant threat to species survival, and 
to maintaining biodiversity and ES. Climate change reduces the 
functionality, stability, and adaptability of ecosystems (Pecl et al. 
2017). For example, drought affects cropland and forest productivity 
and reduces associated harvests (provisioning services). In additional, 
extreme changes in precipitation may reduce the capacity of forests 
to provide stability for groundwater (regulation and maintenance 
services). Prolonged periods of high temperature may cause 
widespread death of trees in tropical mountains, boreal and tundra 
forests, impacting on diverse ES, including aesthetic and cultural 
services (Verbyla 2011; Chapin et al. 2010; Krishnaswamy et al. 
2014). According to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005), 
climate change is likely to become one of the most significant drivers 
of biodiversity loss by the end of the century.
There is high confidence that climate change already poses a moderate 
risk to biodiversity, and is projected to become a  progressively 
widespread and high risk in the coming decades; loss of Arctic 
sea ice threatens biodiversity across an entire biome and beyond; 
the related pressure of ocean acidification, resulting from higher 
concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, is also already 
being observed (UNEP 2009). There is ample evidence that climate 
change and land change negatively affects biodiversity across wide 
spatial scales. Although there is relatively limited evidence of current 
extinctions caused by climate change, studies suggest that climate 
change could surpass habitat destruction as the greatest global 
threat to biodiversity over the next several decades (Pereira et al. 
2010). However, the multiplicity of approaches and the resulting 
variability in projections make it difficult to get a clear picture of 
the future of biodiversity under different scenarios of global climatic 
change (Pereira et al. 2010). Biodiversity is also severely impacted 
on by climate change induced land degradation and ecosystem 
transformation (Pecl et al. 2017). This may affect humans directly 
and indirectly through cascading impacts on ecosystem function 
and services (Millennium Assessment 2005). Climate change related 
human migration is likely to impact on biodiversity as people move 
into and contribute to land stress in biodiversity hotspots now and 
in the future; and as humans concurrently move into areas where 
biodiversity is also migrating to adapt to climate change (Oglethorpe 
et al. 2007).
Climate and land change increases risk to respiratory 
and infectious disease
In addition to risks related to nutrition articulated in Figure  7.1, 
human health can be affected by climate change through extreme 
heat and cold, changes in infectious diseases, extreme events, and 
land cover and land use (Hasegawa et al. 2016; Ryan et al. 2015; 
Terrazas et al. 2015; Kweka et al. 2016; Yamana et al. 2016). Evidence 
indicates that action to prevent the health impacts of climate change 
could provide substantial economic benefits (Martinez et al. 2015; 
Watts et al. 2015).
Climate change exacerbates air pollution with increasing UV and 
ozone concentration. It has negative impacts on human health and 
increases the mortality rate, especially in urban region (Silva et al. 
2016, 2013; Lelieveld et al. 2013; Whitmee et al. 2015; Anenberg et 
al. 2010). In the Amazon, research shows that deforestation (both 
net loss and fragmentation) increases malaria, where vectors are 
expected to increase their home range (Alimi et al. 2015; Ren et al. 
2016), confounded with multiple factors, such as social-economic 
conditions and immunity (Tucker Lima et al. 2017; Barros and Honório 
2015). Deforestation has been shown to enhance the survival and 
development of major malaria vectors (Wang et al. 2016). The World 
Health Organization estimates 60,091 additional deaths for climate 
change induced malaria for the year 2030 and 32,695 for 2050 
(World Health Organization 2014).
Human encroachment on animal habitat, in combination with the 
bushmeat trade in Central African countries, has contributed to the 
increased incidence of zoonotic (i.e., animal-derived) diseases in 
human populations, including the Ebola virus epidemic (Alexander 
et al. 2015a; Nkengasong and Onyebujoh 2018). The composition 
and density of zoonotic reservoir populations, such as rodents, is also 
influenced by land use and climate change (high confidence) (Young 
et al. 2017a). The bushmeat trade in many regions of central and west 
African forests (particularly in relation to chimpanzee and gorilla 
populations) elevates the risk of Ebola by increasing human–animal 
contact (Harrod 2015).
7.3.4 
Risks to communities and infrastructure
There is high confidence that policies and institutions which 
accentuate vicious cycles of poverty and ill-health, land degradation 
and GHG emissions undermine stability and are barriers to achieving 
climate-resilient sustainable development. There is high confidence 
that change in climate and land pose high periodic and sustained risk 
to the very young, those living in poverty, and ageing populations. 
Older people are particularly exposed, due to more restricted access 
to resources, changes in physiology, and the decreased mobility 
resulting from age, which may limit adaptive capacity of individuals 
and populations as a whole (Filiberto et al. 2010).
Combinations of food insecurity, livelihood loss related to degrading 
soils and ecosystem change, or other factors that diminish the 
habitability of where people live, disrupt social fabric and are 
currently detected in most regions of the world (Carleton and 
692
Chapter 7 
Risk management and decision-making in relation to sustainable development
7
Hsiang 2016b) There is high confidence that coastal flooding and 
degradation already poses widespread and rising future risk to 
infrastructure value and stranded infrastructure, as well as livelihoods 
made possible by urban infrastructure (Radhakrishnan et al. 2017; 
Pathirana et al. 2018; Pathirana et al. 2018; Radhakrishnan et al. 
2018; EEA 2016; Pelling and Wisner 2012; Oke et al. 2017; Parnell 
and Walawege 2011; Uzun and Cete 2004; Melvin et al. 2017).
There is high evidence and high agreement that climate and land 
change pose a high risk to communities. Interdependent infrastructure 
systems, including electric power and transportation, are highly 
vulnerable and interdependent (Below et al. 2012; Adger et al. 2013; 
Pathirana et al. 2018; Conway and Schipper 2011; Caney 2014; Chung 
Tiam Fook 2017). These systems are exposed to disruption from 
severe climate events such as weather-related power interruptions 
lasting for hours to days (Panteli and Mancarella 2015). Increased 
magnitude and frequency of high winds, ice storms, hurricanes and 
heat waves have caused widespread damage to power infrastructure 
and also severe outages, affecting significant numbers of customers 
in urban and rural areas (Abi-Samra and Malcolm 2011).
Increasing populations, enhanced per capita water use, climate 
change, and allocations for water conservation are potential 
threats to adequate water availability. As climate change produces 
variations in rainfall, these challenges will intensify, evidenced by 
severe water shortages in recent years in Cape Town, Los Angeles, 
and Rio  de  Janeiro, among other places (Watts et al. 2018; 
Majumder 2015; Ashoori et al. 2015; Mini et al. 2015; Otto et al. 
2015; Ranatunga et al. 2014; Ray and Shaw 2016; Gopakumar 
2014) (Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 3).
Cross-Chapter Box 10 |  Economic dimensions of climate change and land
Koko Warner (The United States of America), Aziz Elbehri (Morocco), Marta Guadalupe Rivera Ferre (Spain), Alisher Mirzabaev 
(Germany/Uzbekistan), Lindsay Stringer (United Kingdom), Anita Wreford (New Zealand)
Sustainable land management (SLM) makes strong social and economic sense. Early action in implementing SLM for climate change 
adaptation and mitigation provides distinct societal advantages. Understanding the full scope of what is at stake from climate change 
presents challenges because of inadequate accounting of the degree and scale at which climate change and land interactions impact 
society, and the importance society places on those impacts (Santos et al. 2016) (Sections 7.2.2, 5.3.1, 5.3.2 and 4.1). The consequences 
of inaction and delay bring significant risks, including irreversible change and loss in land ecosystem services (ES) – including food 
security – with potentially substantial economic damage to many countries in many regions of the world (high confidence).
This cross-chapter box brings together the salient economic concepts underpinning the assessments of SLM and mitigation options 
presented in this report. Four critical concepts are required to help assess the social and economic implications of land-based climate 
action:
i. 
Value to society
ii. Damages from climate and land-induced interventions on land ecosystems
iii. Costs of action and inaction
iv. Decision-making under uncertainty
i. Value to society
Healthy functioning land and ecosystems are essential for human health, food and livelihood security. Land derives its value to 
humans from being a finite resource and vital for life, providing important ES from water recycling, food, feed, fuel, biodiversity 
and carbon storage and sequestration.
Many of these ES may be difficult to estimate in monetary terms, including when they hold high symbolic value, linked to ancestral 
history, or traditional and indigenous knowledge systems (Boillat and Berkes 2013). Such incommensurable values of land are core to 
social cohesion – social norms and institutions, trust that enables all interactions, and sense of community.
ii.  Damages from climate and land-induced interventions on land ecosystems
Values of many land-based ES and their potential loss under land–climate change interaction can be considerable: in 2011, the global 
value of ES was 125 trillion USD per year and the annual loss due to land-use change was between 4.3 and 20.2 trillion USD per 
year from 2007 (Costanza et al. 2014; Rockström et al. 2009). The annual costs of land degradation are estimated to be about 
231 billion USD per year or about 0.41% of the global GDP of 56.49 trillion USD in 2007 (Nkonya et al. 2016) (Sections 4.4.1 and 4.4.2).

Risk management and decision-making in relation to sustainable development 
Chapter 7

Cross-Chapter Box 10 (continued)
Studies show increasingly negative effects on GDP from damage and loss to land-based values and service as global mean temperatures 
increase, although the impact varies across regions (Kompas et al. 2018).
iii.  Costs of action and inaction
Evidence suggests that the cost of inaction in mitigation and adaptation, and land use, exceeds the cost of interventions in 
both individual countries, regions, and worldwide (Nkonya et al. 2016). Continued inaction reduces the future policy option space, 
dampens economic growth and increases the challenges of mitigation as well as adaptation (Moore and Diaz 2015; Luderer et al. 
2013). The cost of reducing emissions is estimated to be considerably less than the costs of the damages at all levels (Kainuma 
et al. 2013; Moran 2011; Sánchez and Maseda 2016).
The costs of adapting to climate impacts are also projected to be substantial, although evidence is limited (summarised in Chambwera 
et al. 2014a). Estimates range from 9 to 166 billion USD per year at various scales and types of adaptation, from capacity building 
to specific projects (Fankhauser 2017). There is insufficient literature about the costs of adaptation in the agriculture or land-based 
sectors (Wreford and Renwick 2012) due to lack of baselines, uncertainty around biological relationships and inherent uncertainty about 
anticipated avoided damage estimates, but economic appraisal of actions to maintain the functions of the natural environment and 
land sector generate positive net present values (Adaptation Sub-committee 2013).
Preventing land degradation from occurring is considered more cost-effective in the long term compared to the magnitude of resources 
required to restore already degraded land (Cowie et al. 2018a) (Section 3.6.1). Evidence from drylands shows that each US dollar 
invested in land restoration provides between 3 and 6 USD in social returns over a 30-year period, using a discount rate between 2.5 
and 10% (Nkonya et al. 2016). SLM practices reverse or minimise economic losses of land degradation, estimated at between 6.3 and 
10.6 trillion USD annually, (ELD Initiative 2015) more than five times the entire value of agriculture in the market economy (Costanza 
et al. 2014; Fischer et al. 2017; Sandifer et al. 2015; Dasgupta et al. 2013) (Section 3.7.5).
Across other areas such as food security, disaster mitigation and risk reduction, humanitarian response, and healthy diet 
(to  address  malnutrition as well as disease), early action generates economic benefits greater than costs (high evidence, high 
agreement) (Fankhauser 2017; Wilkinson et al. 2018; Venton 2018; Venton et al. 2012; Clarvis et al. 2015; Nugent et al. 2018; Watts et 
al. 2018; Bertram et al. 2018) (Sections 6.3 and 6.4).
iv.  Decision-making under uncertainty
Given that significant uncertainty exists regarding the future impacts of climate change, effective decisions must be made under 
unavoidable uncertainty (Jones et al., 2014).
Approaches that allow for decision-making under uncertainty are continually evolving (Section 7.5). An emerging trend is towards 
new frameworks that will enable multiple decision-makers with multiple objectives to explore the trade-offs between potentially 
conflicting preferences to identify strategies that are robust to deep uncertainties (Singh et al. 2015; Driscoll et al. 2016; Araujo Enciso 
et al. 2016; Herman et al. 2014; Pérez et al. 2016; Girard et al. 2015; Haasnoot et al. 2018; Roelich and Giesekam 2019).
Valuation of benefits and damages and costing interventions: Measurement issues
Cost appraisal tools for climate adaptation are many and their suitability depends on the context (Section 7.5.2.2). Cost-benefit 
analysis (CBA) and cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) are commonly applied, especially for current climate variability situations. 
However, these tools are not without criticism and their limitations have been observed in the literature (see Rogelj et al. 2018). In 
general, measuring costs and providing valuations are influenced by four conditions: measurement and valuation; the time dimension; 
externalities; and aggregate versus marginal costs.
Measurement and value issues
ES not traded in the market fall outside the formal or market-based valuation and so their value is either not accounted for 
or underestimated in both private and public decisions (Atkinson et al. 2018). Environmental valuation literature uses a range of 
techniques to assign monetary values to environmental outcomes where no market exists (Atkinson et al. 2018; Dallimer et al. 2018), 
but some values remain inestimable. For some indigenous cultures and peoples, land is not considered something that can be sold and 
bought, so economic valuations are not meaningful even as proxy approaches (Boillat and Berkes 2013; Kumpula et al. 2011; Pert et 
al. 2015; Xu et al. 2005).

Windows of opportunity
Windows of opportunity are important learning moments wherein 
an event or disturbance in relation to land, climate, and food 
security triggers responsive social, political, policy change 
(medium agreement). Policies play an important role in windows 
of opportunity and are important in relation to managing risks of 
desertification, soil degradation, food insecurity, and supporting 
response options for SLM (high agreement) (Kivimaa and Kern 2016; 
Gupta et al. 2013b; Cosens et al. 2017; Darnhofer 2014; Duru et al. 
2015) (Chapter 6).
A wide range of events or disturbances may initiate windows of 
opportunity – ranging from climatic events and disasters, recognition 
of a state of land degradation, an ecological social or political crisis, 
and a  triggered regulatory burden or opportunity. Recognition of 
a  degraded system such as land degradation and desertification 
(Chapters 3 and 4) and associated ecosystem feedbacks, allows for 
strategies, response options and policies to address the degraded 
state (Nyström et al. 2012). Climate related disasters (flood, 
droughts, etc.) and crisis may trigger latent local adaptive capacities 
leading to systemic equitable improvement (McSweeney and Coomes 
2011), or novel and innovative recombining of sources of experience 
and knowledge, allowing navigation to transformative social 
ecological transitions (Folke et al. 2010). The occurrence of a series of 
punctuated crises such as floods or droughts, qualify as windows of 
opportunity when they enhance society’s capacity to adapt over the 
long term (Pahl-Wostl et al. 2013). A disturbance from an ecological, 
social, or political crisis may be sufficient to trigger the emergence of 
new approaches to governance wherein there is a change in the rules 
of the social world such as informal agreements surrounding human 
activities or formal rules of public policies (Olsson et al. 2006; Biggs 
et al. 2017) (Section 7.6). A combination of socio-ecological changes 
may provide windows of opportunity for a socio-technical niche to be 
adopted on a greater scale, transforming practices towards SLM such 
as biodiversity-based agriculture (Darnhofer 2014; Duru et al. 2015).
Cross-Chapter Box 10 (continued)
While a rigorous CBA is broader than a purely financial tool and can capture non-market values where they exist, it can prioritise 
certain values over others (such as profit maximisation for owners, efficiency from the perspective of supply chain processes, and 
judgements about which parties bear the costs). Careful consideration must be given to whose perspectives are considered when 
undertaking a CBA and also to the limitations of these methods for policy interventions.
Time dimension (short versus long term) and the issue of discount rates
Economics uses a mechanism to convert future values to present day values known as discounting, or the pure rate of time preference. 
Discount rates are increasingly being chosen to reflect concerns about intergenerational equity, and some countries (e.g., the UK and 
France) apply a declining discount rate for long-term public projects. The choice of discount rate has important implications for policy 
evaluation (Anthoff, Tol, and Yohe, 2010; Arrow et al., 2014; Baral, Keenan, Sharma, Stork, and Kasel, 2014; Dasgupta et al., 2013; 
Lontzek, Cai, Judd, and Lenton, 2015; Sorokin et al., 2015; van den Bergh and Botzen, 2014) (high evidence, high agreement). Stern 
(2007), for example, used a much lower discount rate (giving almost equal weight to future generations) than the mainstream authors 
(e.g., Nordhaus (1941) and obtained much higher estimates of the damage of climate change).
Positive and negative externalities (consequences and impacts not accounted for in market economy),
All land use generates externalities (unaccounted for side effects of an activity). Examples include loss of ES (e.g., reduced pollinators; 
soil erosion, increased water pollution, nitrification, etc.). Positive externalities include sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO2) and 
improved soil water filtration from afforestation. Externalities can also be social (e.g., displacement and migration) and economic 
(e.g., loss of productive land). In the context of climate change and land, the major externality is the agriculture, forestry and other 
land-use (AFOLU) sourced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Examples of mechanisms to internalise externalities are discussed in 7.5.
Aggregate versus marginal costs
Costs of climate change are often referred to through the marginal measure of the social cost of carbon (SCC), which evaluate the 
total net damages of an extra metric tonne of CO2 emissions due to the associated climate change (Nordhaus 2014). The SCC can be 
used to determine a carbon price, but SCC depends on discount rate assumptions and may neglect processes, including large losses of 
biodiversity, political instability, violent conflicts, large-scale migration flows, and the effects of climate change on the development 
of economies (Stern 2013; Pezzey 2019).
At the sectoral level, marginal abatement cost (MAC) curves are widely used for the assessment of costs related to CO2 or GHG 
emissions reduction. MAC measures the cost of reducing one more GHG unit and MAC curves are either expert-based or model-
derived and offer a range of approaches and assumptions on discount rates or available abatement technologies (Moran 2011).

Policy may also create windows of opportunity. A disturbance 
may cause inconvenience, including high costs of compliance with 
environmental regulations, thereby initiating a change of behaviour 
(Cosens et al. 2017). In a  similar vein, multiple regulatory 
requirements existing at the time of a  disturbance may result in 
emergent processes and novel solutions in order to correct for 
piecemeal regulatory compliance (Cosens et al. 2017). Lastly, 
windows of opportunity can be created by a policy mix or portfolio 
that provides for creative destruction of old social processes and 
thereby encourages new innovative solutions (Kivimaa et al. 2017b) 
(Section 7.4.8).
7.4 
Policy instruments for land and climate
This section outlines policy responses to risk. It describes 
multi-level policy instruments (Section  7.4.1), policy instruments 
for social protection (Section  7.4.2), policies responding to 
hazard (Section  7.4.3), GHG fluxes (Section  7.4.4), desertification 
(Section  7.4.5), land degradation (Section  7.4.6), economic 
instruments (Section  7.4.7), enabling effective policy instruments 
through policy mixes (Section  7.4.8), and barriers to SLM and 
overcoming these barriers (Section 7.4.9).
Policy instruments are used to influence behaviour and effect 
a response – to do, not do, or continue to do certain things (Anderson 
2010) – and they can be invoked at multiple levels (international, 
national, regional, and local) by multiple actors (Table  7.2). For 
efficiency, equity and effectiveness considerations, the appropriate 
choice of instrument for the context is critical and, across the topics 
addressed in this report, the instruments will vary considerably. 
A  key consideration is whether the benefits of the action will 
generate private or public social net benefits. Pannell (2008) 
provides a  widely-used framework for identifying the appropriate 
type of instrument depending on whether the actions encouraged 
by the instrument are private or public, and positive or negative. 
Positive incentives (such as financial or regulatory instruments) are 
appropriate where the public net benefits are highly positive and the 
private net benefits are close to zero. This is likely to be the case 
for GHG mitigation measures such as carbon pricing. Many other 
GHG mitigation measures (more effective water or fertiliser use, 
better agricultural practices, less food waste, agroforestry systems, 
better forest management) discussed in previous chapters may have 
substantial private as well as public benefit. Extension (knowledge 
provision) is recommended when public net benefits are highly 
positive, and private net benefits are slightly positive  – again for 
some GHG mitigation measures, and for many adaptations, food 
security and SLM measures. Where the private net benefits are 
slightly positive but the public net benefits highly negative, negative 
incentives (such as regulations and prohibitions) are appropriate, 
(e.g., over-application of fertiliser).
While Pannell’s (2008) framework is useful, it does not address 
considerations relating to the timescale of actions and their 
consequences, particularly in the long time-horizons involved under 
climate change: private benefits may accrue in the short term but 
become negative over time (Outka 2012) and some of the changes 
necessary will require transformation of existing systems (Park et 
al. 2012; Hadarits et al. 2017) necessitating a more comprehensive 
suite of instruments. Furthermore, the framework applies to private 
land ownership, so where land is in different ownership structures, 
different mechanisms will be required. Indeed, land tenure is 
recognised as a factor in barriers to sustainable land management 
and an important governance consideration (Sections  7.4.9 and 
7.6.4). A thorough analysis of the implications of policy instruments 
temporally, spatially and across other sectors and goals (e.g., climate 
versus development) is essential before implementation to 
avoid unintended consequences and achieve policy coherence 
(Section 7.4.8).
7.4.1 
Multi-level policy instruments
Policy responses and planning in relation to land and climate 
interactions occur at and across multiple levels, involve multiple actors, 
and utilise multiple planning mechanisms (Urwin and Jordan 2008). 
Climate change is occurring on a global scale while the impacts of 
climate change vary from region to region and even within a region. 
Therefore, in addressing local climate impacts, local governments 
and communities are key players. Advancing governance of climate 
change across all levels of government and relevant stakeholders is 
crucial to avoid policy gaps between local action plans and national/
sub-national policy frameworks (Corfee-Morlot et al. 2009).
This section of the chapter identifies policies by level that respond to 
land and climate problems and risks. As risk management in relation 
to land and climate occurs at multiple levels by multiple actors, and 
across multiple sectors in relation to hazards (as listed on Table 7.2), 
risk governance, or the consideration of the landscapes of risk 
arising from Chapters 2 to 6 is addressed in Sections 7.5 and 7.6. 
Categories of instruments include regulatory instruments (command 
and control measures), economic and market instruments (creating 
a  market, sending price signals, or employing a  market strategy), 
voluntary of persuasive instruments (persuading people to internalise 
behaviour), and managerial (arrangements including multiple actors 
in cooperatively administering a  resource or overseeing an issue) 
(Gupta et al. 2013a; Hurlbert 2018b).
Given the complex spatial and temporal dynamics of risk, 
a comprehensive, portfolio of instruments and responses is required 
to comprehensively manage risk. Operationalising a  portfolio 
response can mean layering, sequencing or integrating approaches. 
Layering means that, within a geographical area, households are 
able to benefit from multiple interventions simultaneously (e.g., 
those for family planning and those for livelihoods development). 
A sequencing approach starts with those interventions that address 
the initial binding constraints, and then adding further interventions 
later (e.g., the poorest households first receive grant-based 
support before then gaining access to appropriate microfinance 
or market-oriented initiatives). Integrated approaches involve 
cross-sectoral support within the framework of one programme 
(Scott et al. 2016; Tengberg and Valencia 2018) (Sections 7.4.8, 7.5.6 
and 7.6.3).

Climate-related risk could be categorised by climate impacts such 
as flood, drought, cyclone, and so on (Christenson et al. 2014). 
Table  7.2 outlines instruments relating to impacts responding to 
the risk of climate change, food insecurity, land degradation and 
desertification, and hazards (flood, drought, forest fire), and GHG 
fluxes (climate mitigation).
7.4.2 
Policies for food security and social protection
There is medium evidence and high agreement that a combination 
of structural and non-structural policies are required in averting and 
minimising as well as responding to land and climate change risk, 
including food and livelihood security. If disruptions to elements of 
food security are long-lasting, policies are needed to change practices.
If disruptions to food and livelihood systems are temporary, then 
policies aimed at stemming worsening human well-being and 
stabilising short-term income fluctuations in communities (such as

7.4.2.1 
Policies to ensure availability, access, utilisation and 
stability of food
Food security is affected by interactions between climatic factors 
(rising temperatures, changes in weather variability and extremes), 
changes in land use and land degradation, and Socio-economic 
Pathways and policy choices related to food systems (see Figures 7.1 
and 7.2). As outlined in Chapter 5, key aspects of food security are 
food availability, access to food, utilisation of food, and stability 
of food systems. 
While comprehensive reviews of policy are rare and additional data is 
needed (Adu et al. 2018), evidence indicates that the results of food 
security interventions vary widely due to differing values underlying 
the design of instruments. A large portfolio of measures is available 
to shape outcomes in these areas from the use of tariffs or subsidies, 
to payments for production practices (OECD 2018). In the past, 
efforts to increase food production through significant investment 
in agricultural research, including crop improvement, have benefited 
farmers by increasing yields and reducing losses, and have helped 
consumers by lowering food prices (Pingali 2012, 2015; Alston 
and Pardey 2014; Popp et al. 2013). Public spending on agriculture 
research and development (R&D) has been more effective at raising 
sustainable agriculture productivity than irrigation or fertiliser 
subsidies (OECD 2018). Yet, on average, between 2015 and 2017, 
governments spent only around 14% of total agricultural support on 
services, including physical and knowledge infrastructure, transport 
and information and communications technology.
In terms of increasing food availability and supply, producer support, 
including policies mandating subsidies or payments, have been used 
to boost production of certain commodities or protect ES. Incentives 
can distort markets and farm business decisions in both negative 
and positive ways. For example, the European Union promotes meat 
and dairy production through voluntary coupled direct payments. 
These do not yet internalise external damage to climate, health, and 
groundwater (Velthof et al. 2014; Bryngelsson et al. 2016). In most 
countries, producer support has been declining since the mid-1990s 
(OECD 2018). Yet new evidence indicates that a government policy 
supporting producer subsidy could encourage farmers to adopt new 
technologies and reduce GHG emissions in agriculture (medium 
evidence, high agreement). However, this will require large capital 
(Henderson 2018). Since a 1995 reform in its forest law, Costa Rica 
has effectively used a combination of fuel tax, water tax, loans and 
agreements with companies, to pay landowners for agroforestry, 
reforestation and sustainable forest management (Porras and 
Asquith 2018). 
Inland capture fisheries and aquaculture are an integral part of 
nutrition security and livelihoods for large numbers of people globally 
(Welcomme et al. 2010; Hall et al. 2013; Tidwell and Allan 2001; Youn 
et al. 2014) and are increasingly vulnerable to climate change and 
competing land and water use (Allison et al. 2009; Youn et al. 2014). 
Future production may increase in some high-latitude regions (low 
confidence) but production is likely to decline in low-latitude regions 
under future warming (high confidence) (Brander and Keith 2015; 
Brander 2007). However over-exploitation and degradation of rivers 
has resulted in a decreasing trend in the contribution of capture 
fisheries to protein security in comparison to managed aquaculture 
(Welcomme et al. 2010). Aquaculture, however, competes for 
land and water resources with many negative ecological and 
environmental impacts (Verdegem and Bosma 2009; Tidwell and 
Allan 2001). Inland capture fisheries are undervalued in national 
and regional food security, ES and economy, are data deficient and 
are neglected in terms of supportive policies at national levels, and 
absent in SDGs (Cooke et al. 2016; Hall et al. 2013; Lynch et al. 2016). 
Revival of sustainable capture fisheries and converting aquaculture 
to environmentally less-damaging management regimes, is likely to 
succeed with the following measures: investment in recognition of 
their importance, improved valuation and assessment, secure tenure 
and adoption of social, ecological and technological guidelines, 
upstream-downstream river basin cooperation, and maintenance 
of ecological flow regimes in rivers (Youn et al. 2014; Mostert et 
al. 2007; Ziv et al. 2012; Hurlbert and Gupta 2016; Poff et al. 2003; 
Thomas 1996; FAO 2015a).
Extension services, and policies supporting agricultural extension 
systems, are also critical. Smallholder farmer-dominated agriculture 
is currently the backbone of global food security in the developing 
world. Without education and incentives to manage land and forest 
resources in a manner that allows regeneration of both the soils and 
wood stocks, smallholder farmers tend to generate income through 
inappropriate land management practices, engage in agricultural 
production on unsuitable land and use fertile soils, timber and 
firewood for brick production and construction. Also, they engage 
in charcoal production (deforestation) as a coping mechanism 
(increasing income) against food deficiency (Munthali and Murayama 
2013). Through extension services, governments can play a proactive 
role in providing information on climate and market risks, animal and 
plant health. Farmers with greater access to extension training retain 
more crop residues for mulch on their fields (Jaleta et al. 2015, 2013; 
Baudron et al. 2014).
Food security cannot be achieved by increasing food availability 
alone. Policy instruments, which increase access to food at the 
household level, include safety-net programming and universal 
basic income. The graduation approach, developed and tested over 
the past decade using randomised control trials in six countries, has 
lasting positive impacts on income, as well as food and nutrition 
security (Banerjee et al. 2015; Raza and Poel 2016) (robust evidence, 
high agreement). The graduation approach layers and integrates 
a series of interventions designed to help the poorest: consumption 
support in the form of cash or food assistance, transfer of an income-
generating asset (such as a livestock) and training on how to maintain 
the asset, assistance with savings and coaching or mentoring over 
a period of time to reinforce learning and provide support. Due to 
its success, the graduation approach is now being scaled up, and is 
now used in more than 38 countries and included by an increasing 
number of governments in social safety-net programmes (Hashemi 
and de Montesquiou 2011).
698
Chapter 7 
Risk management and decision-making in relation to sustainable development

At the national and global levels, food prices and trade policies 
impact on access to food. Fiscal policies, such as taxation, subsidies, 
or tariffs, can be used to regulate production and consumption of 
certain foods and can affect environmental outcomes. In Denmark, 
a tax on saturated fat content of food adopted to encourage healthy 
eating habits accounted for 0.14% of total tax revenues between 
2011 and 2012 (Sassi et al. 2018). A global tax on GHG emissions, 
for example, has large mitigation potential and will generate tax 
revenues, but may also result in large reductions in agricultural 
production (Henderson 2018). Consumer-level taxes on GHG-
intensive food may be applied to address competitiveness issues 
between different countries, if some countries use taxes while others 
do not. However, increases in prices might impose disproportionate 
financial burdens on low-income households, and may not be publicly 
acceptable. A study examining the relationship between food prices 
and social unrest found that, between 1990 and 2011, whereas food 
price stability has not been associated with increases in social unrest 
(Bellemare 2015).
Interventions that allow people to maximise their productive potential 
while protecting the ES may not ensure food security in all contexts. 
Some household land holdings are so small that self-sufficiency is not 
possible (Venton 2018). Value chain development has, in the past, 
increased farm income but delivered fewer benefits to vulnerable 
consumers (Bodnár et al. 2011). Ultimately, a mix of production 
activities and consumption support is needed. Consumption support 
can be used to help achieve the second important element of food 
security – access to food.
Agricultural technology transfer can help optimise food and nutrition 
security (Section 7.4.4.3). Policies that affect agricultural innovation 
span sectors and include ‘macro-economic policy-settings; 
institutional governance; environmental standards; investment, 
land, labor and education policies; and incentives for investment, 
such as a predictable regulatory environment and robust intellectual 
property rights’. 
The scientific community can partner across sectors and industries 
for better data sharing, integration, and improved modelling and 
analytical capacities (Janetos et al. 2017; Lunt et al. 2016). To better 
predict, respond to, and prepare for concurrent agricultural failures, 
and gain a more systematic assessment of exposure to agricultural 
climate risk, large data gaps need to be filled, as well as gaps in 
empirical foundation and analytical capabilities (Janetos et al. 2017; 
Lunt et al. 2016). Data required include global historical datasets, 
many of which are unreliable, inaccessible, or not available (Maynard 
2015; Lunt et al. 2016). Participation in co-design for scenario 
planning can build social and human capital while improving 
understanding of food system risks and creating innovative ways for 
collectively planning for a more equitable and resilient food system 
(Himanen et al. 2016; Meijer et al. 2015; Van Rijn et al. 2012).
Demand management for food, including promoting healthy 
diets, reducing food loss and waste, is covered in Chapter 5. There 
is a gap in knowledge regarding what policies and instruments 
support demand management. There is robust evidence and robust 
agreement that changes in household wealth and parents’ education 
can drive changes in diet and improvements in nutrition (Headey 
et al. 2017). Bangladesh has managed to sustain a rapid reduction 
in the rate of child undernutrition for at least two decades. Rapid 
wealth accumulation and large gains in parental education are 
the two largest drivers of change (Headey et al. 2017). Educating 
consumers, and providing affordable alternatives, will be critical to 
changing unsustainable food-use habits relevant to climate change.
7.4.2.2 
Policies to secure social protection
There is medium evidence and high agreement from all regions of 
the world that safety nets and social protection schemes can provide 
stability which prevents and reduces abject poverty (Barrientos 
2011; Hossain 2018; Cook and Pincus 2015; Huang and Yang 2017; 
Slater 2011; Sparrow et al. 2013; Rodriguez-Takeuchi and Imai 2013; 
Bamberg et al. 2018) in the face of climatic stressors and land change 
(Davies et al. 2013; Cutter et al. 2012b; Pelling 2011; Ensor 2011).
The World Bank estimates that, globally, social safety net transfers 
have reduced the absolute poverty gap by 45% and the relative 
poverty gap by 16% (World Bank 2018). Adaptive social protection 
builds household capacity to deal with shocks as well as the 
capacity of social safety nets to respond to shocks. For low-income 
communities reliant on land and climate for their livelihoods and 
well-being, social protection provides a way for vulnerable groups 
to manage weather and climatic variability and deteriorating land 
conditions to household income and assets (robust evidence, high 
agreement) (Baulch et al. 2006; Barrientos 2011; Harris 2013; Fiszbein 
et al. 2014; Kiendrebeogo et al. 2017; Kabeer et al. 2010; FAO 2015b; 
Warner et al. 2018; World Bank 2018). 
A lifecycle approach to social protection is one approach, which 
some countries (such as Bangladesh) are using when developing 
national social protection policies. These policies acknowledge 
that households face risks across the lifecycle that they need to be 
protected from. If shocks are persistent, or occur numerous times, 
then policies can address concerns of a more structural nature 
(Glauben et al. 2012). Barrett (2005), for example, distinguishes 
between the role of safety nets (which include programmes such as 
emergency feeding programmes, crop or unemployment insurance, 
disaster assistance, etc.) and cargo nets (which include land reforms, 
targeted microfinance, targeted school food programmes, etc.). While 
the former prevents non-poor and transient poor from becoming 
chronically poor, the latter is meant to lift people out of poverty 
by changing societal or institutional structures. The graduation 
approach has adopted such systematic thinking with successful 
results (Banerjee et al. 2015).
Social protection systems can provide buffers against shocks through 
vertical or horizontal expansion, ‘piggybacking’ on pre-established 
programmes, aligning social protection and humanitarian systems or 
refocusing existing resources (Wilkinson et al. 2018; O’Brien et al. 
2018; Jones and Presler-Marshall 2015). There is increasing evidence 
that forecast-based financing, linked to a social protection, can be 
used to enable anticipatory actions based on forecast triggers, and 
guarantee funding ahead of a shock (Jjemba et al. 2018). Accordingly, 
scaling up social protection based on an early warning could enhance

timeliness, predictability and adequacy of social protection benefits 
(Kuriakose et al. 2012; Costella et al. 2017a; Wilkinson et al. 2018; 
O’Brien et al. 2018).
Countries at high risk of natural disasters often have lower safety-net 
coverage percent (World Bank 2018), and there is medium evidence 
and medium agreement that those countries with few financial and 
other buffers have lower economic and social performance (Cutter 
et al. 2012b; Outreville 2011a). Social protection systems have also 
been seen as an unaffordable commitment of public budget in 
many developing and low-income countries (Harris 2013). National 
systems may be disjointed and piecemeal, and subject to cultural 
acceptance and competing political ideologies (Niño-Zarazúa et al. 
2012). For example, Liberia and Madagascar each have five different 
public works programmes, each with different donor organisations 
and different implementing agencies (Monchuk 2014). These 
implementation shortcomings mean that positive effects of social 
protection systems might not be robust enough to shield recipients 
completely against the impacts of severe shocks or from long-term 
losses and damages from climate change (limited evidence, high 
agreement) (Davies et al. 2009; Umukoro 2013; Béné et al. 2012; Ellis 
et al. 2009).
There is increasing support for establishment of public-private 
safety nets to address climate-related shocks, which are augmented 
by proactive preventative (adaptation) measures and related risk 
transfer instruments that are affordable to the poor (Kousky et al. 
2018b). Studies suggest that the adaptive capacity of communities 
has improved with regard to climate variability, like drought, 
when ex-ante tools, including insurance, have been employed 
holistically; providing insurance in combination with early warning 
and institutional and policy approaches reduces livelihood and food 
insecurity as well as strengthens social structures (Shiferaw et al. 
2014; Lotze-Campen and Popp 2012). Bundling insurance with early 
warning and seasonal forecasting can reduce the cost of insurance 
premiums (Daron and Stainforth 2014). The regional risk insurance 
scheme, African Risk Capacity, has the potential to significantly 
reduce the cost of insurance premiums (Siebert 2016) while bolstering 
contingency planning against food insecurity.
Work-for-insurance programmes applied in the context of social 
protection have been shown to improve livelihood and food security 
in Ethiopia (Berhane 2014; Mohmmed et al. 2018) and Pakistan. The 
R4 Rural Resilience Initiative in Ethiopia is a widely cited example 
of a programme that serves the most vulnerable and includes 
aspects of resource management, and access by the poor to financial 
services, including insurance and savings (Linnerooth-Bayer et al. 
2018). Weather index insurance (such as index-based crop insurance) 
is being presented to low-income farmers and pastoralists in 
developing countries (e.g., Ethiopia, India, Kazakhstan, South Asia) 
to complement informal risk sharing, reducing the risk of lost revenue 
associated with variations in crop yield, and provide an alternative 
to classic insurance (Bogale 2015a; Conradt et al. 2015; Dercon 
et al. 2014; Greatrex et al. 2015; McIntosh et al. 2013). The ability of 
insurance to contribute to adaptive capacity depends on the overall 
risk management and livelihood context of households – studies find 
that agriculturalists and foresters working on rainfed farms/land with 
more years of education and credit but limited off-farm income are 
more willing to pay for insurance than households who have access 
to remittances (such as from family members who have migrated) 
(Bogale 2015a; Gan et al. 2014; Hewitt et al. 2017; Nischalke 2015). 
In Europe, modelling suggests that insurance incentives, such as 
vouchers, would be less expensive than total incentivised damage 
reduction and may reduce residential flood risk in Germany by 
12% in 2016 and 24% by 2040 (Hudson et al. 2016).
7.4.3 
Policies responding to climate-related extremes
7.4.3.1 
Risk management instruments
Risk management addressing climate change has broadened to 
include mitigation, adaptation and disaster preparedness in a process 
using instruments facilitating contingency and cross-sectoral 
planning (Hurlimann and March 2012; Oels 2013), social community 
planning, and strategic, long-term planning (Serrao-Neumann et al. 
2015a). A comprehensive consideration integrates principles from 
informal support mechanisms to enhance formal social protection 
programming (Mobarak and Rosenzweig 2013; Stavropoulou et al. 
2017) such that the social safety net, disaster risk management, 
and climate change adaptation are all considered to enhance 
livelihoods of the chronic poor (see char dwellers and recurrent 
floods in Jamuna and Brahmaputra basins of Bangladesh Awal 2013) 
(Section 7.4.7). Iterative risk management is an ongoing process of 
assessment, action, reassessment and response (Mochizuki et al. 
2015) (Sections 7.5.2 and 7.4.7.2). 
Important elements of risk planning include education, and 
creation of hazard and risk maps. Important elements of predicting 
include hydrological and meteorological monitoring to forecast 
weather, seasonal climate forecasts, aridity, flood and extreme 
weather. Effective responding requires robust communication systems 
that pass on information to enable response (Cools et al. 2016).
Gauging the effectiveness of policy instruments is challenging. 
Timescales may influence outcomes. To evaluate effectiveness 
researchers, programme managers and communities strive to develop 
consistency, comparability, comprehensiveness and coherence in 
their tracking. In other words, practitioners utilise a consistent and 
operational conceptualisation of adaptation; focus on comparable 
units of analysis; develop comprehensive datasets on adaptation 
action; and are coherent with an understanding of what constitutes 
real adaptation (Ford and Berrang-Ford 2016). Increasing the use of 
systematic reviews or randomised evaluations may also be helpful 
(Alverson and Zommers 2018).
Many risk management policy instruments are referred to by the 
International Organization of Standardization which lists risk 
management principles, guidelines, and frameworks for explaining 
the elements of an effective risk management programme (ISO 2009). 
The standard provides practical risk management instruments and 
makes a business case for risk management investments (McClean 
et al. 2010). Insurance addresses impacts associated with extreme 
weather events (storms, floods, droughts, temperature extremes), but 
700

it can provide disincentives for reducing disaster risk at the local level 
through the transfer of risk spatially to other places or temporally to 
the future (Cutter et al. 2012b) and uptake is unequally distributed 
across regions and hazards (Lal et al. 2012). Insurance instruments 
(Sections 7.4.2 and 7.4.6) can take many forms (traditional indemnity 
based, market-based crop insurance, property insurance), and some 
are linked to livelihoods sensitive to weather as well as food security 
(linked to social safety-net programmes) and ecosystems (coral reefs 
and mangroves). Insurance instruments can also provide a framework 
for risk signals to adaptation planning and implementation and 
facilitate financial buffering when climate impacts exceed current 
capabilities delivered through both public and private finance 
(Bogale 2015b; Greatrex et al. 2015; Surminski et al. 2016). A holistic 
consideration of all instruments responding to extreme impacts of 
climate change (drought, flood, etc.) is required when assessing if 
policy instruments are promoting livelihood capitals and contributing 
to the resilience of people and communities (Hurlbert 2018b). This 
holistic consideration of policy instruments leads to a consideration 
of risk governance (Section 7.6).
Early warning systems are critical policy instruments for protecting 
lives and property, adapting to climate change, and effecting adaptive 
climate risk management (high confidence) (Selvaraju 2011; Cools et 
al. 2016; Travis 2013; Henriksen et al. 2018; Seng 2013; Kanta Kafle 
2017; Garcia and Fearnley 2012). Early warning systems exist at 
different levels and for different purposes, including the Food and 
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations’ Global Information 
and Early Warning System on Food and Agriculture (GIEWS), United 
States Agency for International Development (USAID) Famine Early 
Warning System Network (FEWS-NET), national and local extreme 
weather, species extinction, community-based flood and landslide, 
and informal pastoral drought early warning systems (Kanta Kafle 
2017). Medium-term warning systems can identify areas of concern, 
hotspots of vulnerabilities and sensitivities, or critical zones of land 
degradation (areas of concern) (see Chapter 6) critical to reduce risks 
over five to 10 years (Selvaraju 2012). Early warning systems for 
dangerous climate shifts are emerging, with considerations of rate 
of onset, intensity, spatial distribution and predictability. Growing 
research in the area is considering positive and negative lessons 
learned from existing hazard early warning systems, including lead 
time and warning response (Travis 2013).
For effectiveness, communication methods are best adapted to local 
circumstances, religious and cultural-based structures and norms, 
information technology, and local institutional capacity (Cools et 
al. 2016; Seng 2013). Considerations of governance or the actors 
and architecture within the socio-ecological system, is an important 
feature of successful early warning system development (Seng 2013). 
Effective early warning systems consider the critical links between 
hazard monitoring, risk assessment, forecasting tools, warning and 
dissemination (Garcia and Fearnley 2012). These effective systems 
incorporate local context by defining accountability, responsibility, 
acknowledging the importance of risk perceptions and trust for 
an effective response to warnings. Although increasing levels and 
standardisation nationally and globally is important, revising these 
systems through participatory approaches cognisant of the tension 
with technocratic approaches improves success (Cools et al. 2016; 
Henriksen et al. 2018; Garcia and Fearnley 2012).
7.4.3.2 
Drought-related risk minimising instruments
A more detailed review of drought instruments, and three broad 
policy approaches for responding to drought, is provided in Cross-
Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 3. Three broad approaches include: (i) early 
warning systems and response to the disaster of drought (through 
instruments such as disaster assistance or crop insurance); (ii) disaster 
response ex-ante preparation (through drought preparedness plans); 
and (iii) drought risk mitigation (proactive polices to improve 
water-use efficiency, make adjustments to water allocation, funds 
or loans to build technology such as dugouts or improved soil 
management practices).
Drought plans are still predominantly reactive crisis management 
plans rather than proactive risk management and reduction plans. 
Reactive crisis management plans treat only the symptoms and are 
inefficient drought management practices. More efficient drought 
preparedness instruments are those that address the underlying 
vulnerability associated with the impacts of drought, thereby 
building agricultural producer adaptive capacity and resilience (high 
confidence) (Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 3).
7.4.3.3 
Fire-related risk minimising instruments
There is robust evidence and high agreement that fire strategies need 
to be tailored to site-specific conditions in an adaptive application 
that is assessed and reassessed over time (Dellasala et al. 2004; Rocca 
et al. 2014). Strategies for fire management include fire suppression, 
prescribed fire and mechanical treatments (such as thinning the 
canopy), and allowing wildfire with little or no active management 
(Rocca et al. 2014). Fire suppression can degrade the effectiveness of 
forest fire management in the long run (Collins et al. 2013). 
Different forest types have different fire regimes and require different 
fire management policies (Dellasala et al. 2004). For instance, Cerrado, 
a fire dependent savannah, utilises a different fire management policy 
and fire suppression policy (Durigan and Ratter 2016). The choice of 
strategy depends on local considerations, including land ownership 
patterns, dynamics of local meteorology, budgets, logistics, federal and 
local policies, tolerance for risk and landscape contexts. In addition, 
there are trade-offs among the management alternatives and often 
no single management strategy will simultaneously optimise ES, 
including water quality and quantity, carbon sequestration, or run-
off erosion prevention (Rocca et al. 2014).
7.4.3.4 
Flood-related risk minimising instruments
Flood risk management consists of command and control measures, 
including spatial planning and engineered flood defences (Filatova 
2014), financial incentive instruments issued by regional or national 
governments to facilitate cooperative approaches through local 
planning, enhancing community understanding and political 
support for safe development patterns and building standards, and 
regulations requiring local government participation and support for 
701

local flood planning (Burby and May 2009). However, Filatova (2014) 
found that if autonomous adaptation is downplayed, people are more 
likely to make land-use choices that collectively lead to increased 
flood risks and leave costs to governments. Taxes and subsidies that 
do not encourage (and even counter) perverse behaviour (such as 
rebuilding in flood zones) are important instruments mitigating 
this cost to government. Flood insurance has been found to be 
maladaptive as it encourages rebuilding in flood zones (O’Hare 
et al. 2016) and government flood disaster assistance negatively 
impacts on average insurance coverage the following year (Kousky 
et al. 2018a). Modifications to flood insurance can counter perverse 
behaviour. One example is the provision of discounts on flood 
insurance for localities that undertake one of 18 flood mitigation 
activities, including structural mitigation (constructing dykes, dams, 
flood control reservoirs), and non-structural initiatives such as point 
source control and watershed management efforts, education and 
maintenance of flood-related databases (Zahran et al. 2010). Flood 
insurance that provides incentives for flood mitigation, marketable 
permits and transferable development rights (see Case study: Flood 
and food security in Section 7.6) instruments can provide price signals 
to stimulate autonomous adaptation, countering barriers of path 
dependency, and the time lag between private investment decisions 
and consequences (Filatova 2014). To build adaptive capacity, 
consideration needs to be made of policy instruments responding to 
flood, including flood zone mapping, land-use planning, flood zone 
building restrictions, business and crop insurance, disaster assistance 
payments, preventative instruments, (including environmental farm 
planning, e.g., soil and water management (see Chapter 6)), farm 
infrastructure projects, and recovery from debilitating flood losses 
ultimately through bankruptcy (Hurlbert 2018a). Non-structural 
measures have been found to advance sustainable development as 
they are more reversible, commonly acceptable and environmentally 
friendly (Kundzewicz 2002).
7.4.4 
Policies responding to greenhouse 
gas (GHG) fluxes
7.4.4.1 
GHG fluxes and climate change mitigation
Pathways reflecting current nationally stated mitigation ambitions 
as submitted under the Paris Agreement would not limit global 
warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, but instead result 
in a global warming of about 3°C by 2100 with warming continuing 
afterward (IPCC 2018d). Reversing warming after an overshoot 
of 0.2°C or higher during this century would require deployment 
of CDR at rates and volumes that might not be achievable given 
considerable implementation challenges (IPCC 2018d). This gap 
(Höhne et al. 2017; Rogelj et al. 2016) creates a significant risk of 
global warming impacting on land degradation, desertification, and 
food security (IPCC 2018d) (Section 7.2). Action can be taken by 2030 
adopting already known cost-effective technology (United Nations 
Environment Programme 2017), improving the finance, capacity 
building, and technology transfer mechanisms of the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), improving 
food security (listed by 73 nations in their nationally determined 
contributions (NDCs)) and nutritional security (listed by 25 nations) 
(Richards et al. 2015). UNFCCC Decision 1. CP21 reaffirmed the 
UNFCCC target that ‘developed country parties provide  USD 100 
billion annually by 2020 for climate action in developing countries’ 
(Rajamani 2011) and a new collective quantified goal above this 
floor is to be set, taking into account the needs and priorities of 
developing countries (Fridahl and Linnér 2016).
Mitigation policy instruments to address this shortfall include 
financing mechanisms, carbon pricing, cap and trade or emissions 
trading, and technology transfer. While climate change is a global 
commons problem containing free-riding issues cost-effective 
international policies that ensure that countries get the most 
environmental benefit out of mitigation investments promote an 
international climate policy regime (Nordhaus 1999; Aldy and Stavins 
2012). Carbon pricing instruments may provide an entry point for 
inclusion of appropriate agricultural carbon instruments. Models of 
cost-efficient distribution of mitigation across regions and sectors 
typically employ a global uniform carbon price, but such treatment in 
the agricultural sector may impact on food security (Section 7.4.4.4).
One policy initiative to advance climate mitigation policy coherence 
in this section is the phase out of subsidies for fossil fuel production 
(see also Section 7.4.8). The G20 agreed in 2009, and the G7 agreed 
in 2016, to phase out these subsidies by 2025. Subsidies include lower 
tax rates or exemptions and rebates of taxes on fuels used by particular 
consumers (diesel fuel used by farming, fishing, etc.), types of fuel, or 
how fuels are used. The OECD estimates the overall value of these 
subsides to be 160–200 billion USD annually between 2010 and 2014 
(OECD 2015). The phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies has important 
economic, environmental and social benefits. Coady et al. (2017) 
estimate the economic and environmental benefits of reforming fossil 
fuel subsidies could be valued worldwide at 4.9 trillion USD in 2013, 
and 5.3 trillion USD in 2015. Eliminating subsidies could have reduced 
emissions by 21%, raised 4% of global GDP as revenue (in 2013), and 
improved social welfare (Coady et al. 2017).
Legal instruments addressing perceived deficiencies in climate 
change mitigation include human rights and liability. Developments 
in attribution science are improving the ability to detect human 
influence on extreme weather. Marjanac et al. (2017) argue that 
this broadens the legal duty of government, business and others to 
manage foreseeable harms, and may lead to more climate change 
litigation (Marjanac et al. 2017). Peel and Osofsky (2017) argue 
that courts are becoming increasingly receptive to employ human 
rights claims in climate change lawsuits (Peel and Osofsky 2017); 
citizen suits in domestic courts are not a universal phenomenon and, 
even if unsuccessful, Estrin (2016) concludes they are important in 
underlining the high level of public concern.
7.4.4.2 
Mitigation instruments
Similar instruments for mitigation could be applied to the land sector 
as in other sectors, including: market-based measures such as taxes 
and cap and trade systems; standards and regulations; subsidies and 
tax credits; information instruments and management tools; R&D 
investment; and voluntary compliance programmes. However, few 
regions have implemented agricultural mitigation instruments 
702
Chapter 7 
Risk management and decision-making in relation to sustainable development
7
(Cooper et al. 2013). Existing regimes focus on subsidies, grants and 
incentives, and voluntary offset programmes. 
7.4.4.3 
Market-based instruments
Although carbon pricing is recognised to be an important cost-
effective instrument in a portfolio of climate policies (high evidence, 
high agreement) (Aldy et al. 2010), as yet, no country is exposing their 
agricultural sector emissions to carbon pricing in any comprehensive 
way. A carbon tax, fuel tax, and carbon markets (cap and trade 
system or Emissions Trading System (ETS), or baseline and credit 
schemes, and voluntary markets) are predominant policy instruments 
that implement carbon pricing. The advantage of carbon pricing is 
environmental effectiveness at relatively low cost (high evidence, high 
agreement) (Baranzini et al. 2017; Fawcett et al. 2014). Furthermore, 
carbon pricing could be used to raise revenue to reinvest in public 
spending, either to help certain sectors transition to lower carbon 
systems, or to invest in public spending unrelated to climate change. 
Both of these options may make climate policies more attractive and 
enhance overall welfare (Siegmeier et al. 2018), but there is, as yet, 
no evidence of the effectiveness of emissions pricing in agriculture 
(Grosjean et al. 2018). There is, however, a clear need for progress in 
this area as, without effective carbon pricing, the mitigation potential 
identified in chapters 5 and 6 of this report will not be realised (high 
evidence, high agreement) (Boyce 2018).
The price may be set at the social cost of carbon (the incremental 
impact of emitting an additional tonne of CO2, or the benefit of 
slightly reducing emissions), but estimates of the SCC vary widely 
and are contested (high evidence, high agreement) (Pezzey 2019). 
An alternative to the SCC includes a pathways approach that sets 
an emissions target and estimates the carbon prices required to 
achieve this at the lowest possible cost (Pezzey 2019). Theoretically, 
higher costs throughout the entire economy result in reduction of 
carbon intensity, as consumers and producers adjust their decisions 
in relation to prices corrected to reflect the climate externality 
(Baranzini et al. 2017). 
Both carbon taxes and cap and trade systems can reduce emissions, 
but cap and trade systems are generally more cost effective (medium 
evidence, high agreement) (Haites 2018a). In both cases, the design 
of the system is critical to its effectiveness at reducing emissions (high 
evidence, high agreement) (Bruvoll and Larsen 2004; (Lin and Li 2011). 
The trading system allows the achievement of emission reductions 
in the most cost-effective manner possible and results in a market 
and price on emissions that create incentives for the reduction of 
carbon pollution. The way allowances are allocated in a cap and 
trade system is critical to its effectiveness and equity. Free allocations 
can be provided to trade-exposed sectors, such as agriculture, either 
through historic or output-based allocations, the choice of which has 
important implications (Quirion 2009). Output-based allocations may 
be most suitable for agriculture, also minimising leakage risk (see 
below in this section) (Grosjean et al. 2018; Quirion 2009). There is 
medium evidence and high agreement that properly designed, a cap 
and trade system can be a powerful policy instrument (Wagner 2013) 
and may collect more rents than a variable carbon tax (Siegmeier 
et al. 2018; Schmalensee and Stavins 2017).
In the land sector, carbon markets are challenging to implement. 
Although several countries and regions have an ETS in place (for 
example, the EU, Switzerland, the Republic of Korea, Quebec in 
Canada, California in the USA (Narassimhan et al. 2018)), none 
have included non-CO2 (methane and nitrous oxide) emissions from 
agriculture. New Zealand is the only country currently considering 
ways to incorporate agriculture into its ETS (see Case study: Including 
agriculture in the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme).
Three main reasons explain the lack of implementation to date:
1. The large number of heterogeneous buyers and sellers, combined 
with the difficulties of monitoring, reporting and verification 
(MRV) of emissions from biological systems introduce potentially 
high levels of complexity (and transaction costs). Effective 
policies therefore depend on advanced MRV systems which are 
lacking in many (particularly developing) countries (Wilkes et al. 
2017). This is discussed in more detail in the case study on the 
New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme.
2. Adverse distributional consequences (Grosjean et al. 2018) 
(medium evidence, high agreement). Distributional issues 
depend, in part, on the extent that policy costs can be passed 
on to consumers, and there is medium evidence and medium 
agreement that social equity can be increased through 
a  combination of non-market and market-based instruments 
(Haites 2018b).
3. Regulation, market-based or otherwise, adopted in only one 
jurisdiction and not elsewhere may result in ‘leakage’ or reduced 
effectiveness – where production relocates to weaker regulated 
regions, potentially reducing the overall environmental benefit. 
Although modelling studies indicate the possibility of leakage 
following unilateral agricultural mitigation policy implementation 
(e.g., Fellmann et al. 2018), there is no empirical evidence from 
the agricultural sector yet available. Analysis from other sectors 
shows an overestimation of the extent of carbon leakage in 
modelling studies conducted before policy implementation 
compared to evidence after the policy was implemented 
(Branger and Quirion 2014). Options to avoid leakage include: 
border adjustments (emissions in non-regulated imports are 
taxed at the border, and payments made on products exported 
to non-regulated countries are rebated); differential pricing for 
trade-exposed products; and output-based allocation (which 
effectively works as a subsidy for trade-exposed products). 
Modelling shows that border adjustments are the most effective 
at reducing leakage, but may exacerbate regional inequality 
(Böhringer et al. 2012) and through their trade-distorting nature 
may contravene World Trade Organization rules. The opportunity 
for leakage would be significantly reduced, ideally through multi-
lateral commitments (Fellmann et al. 2018) (medium evidence, 
high agreement) but could also be reduced through regional or 
bi-lateral commitments within trade agreements.

Case study |  Including agriculture in the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS)
New Zealand has a high proportion of agricultural emissions at 49% (Ministry of the Environment 2018) – the next-highest developed 
country agricultural emitter is Ireland at around 32% (EPA 2018) – and is considering incorporating agricultural non-CO2 gases into 
the existing national ETS. In the original design of the ETS in 2008, agriculture was intended to be included from 2013, but successive 
governments deferred the inclusion (Kerr and Sweet 2008) due to concerns about competitiveness, lack of mitigation options and the 
level of opposition from those potentially affected (Cooper and Rosin 2014). Now though, as the country’s agricultural emissions are 
12% above 1990 levels, and the country’s total gross emissions have increased 19.6% above 1990 levels (New Zealand Ministry for the 
Environment 2018), there is a recognition that, without any targeted policy for agriculture, only 52% of the country’s emissions face 
any substantive incentive to mitigate (Narassimhan et al. 2018). Including agriculture in the ETS is one option to provide incentives for 
emissions reductions in that sector. Other options are discussed in Section 7.4.4. Although some producer groups raise concern that 
including agriculture will place New Zealand producers at a disadvantage compared with their international competitors who do not 
face similar mechanisms (New Zealand Productivity Commission 2018), there is generally greater acceptance of the need for climate 
policies for agriculture.
The inclusion of non-CO2 emissions from agriculture within an ETS is potentially complex, however, due to the large number of buyers 
and sellers if obligations are placed at farm level, and different choices of how to estimate emissions from biological systems in cost-
effective ways. New Zealand is currently investigating practical and equitable approaches to include agriculture through advice being 
provided by the Interim Climate Change Committee (ICCC 2018). Main questions centre around the point of obligation for buying and 
selling credits, where trade-offs have to be made between providing incentives for behaviour change at farm level and the cost and 
complexity of administering the scheme (Agriculture Technical Advisory Group 2009; Kerr and Sweet 2008). The two potential points 
of obligation are at the processor level or at the individual farm level. Setting the point of obligation at the processor level means that 
farmers would face limited incentive to change their management practices, unless the processors themselves rewarded farmers for 
lowered emissions. Setting it at the individual farm level would provide a direct incentive for farmers to adopt mitigation practices, 
however, the reality of having thousands of individual points of obligation would be administratively complex and could result in high 
transaction costs (Beca Ltd 2018).
Monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) of agricultural emissions presents another challenge, especially if emissions have to 
be estimated at farm level. Again, trade-offs have to be made between accuracy and detail of estimation method and the complexity, 
cost and audit of verification (Agriculture Technical Advisory Group 2009). 
The ICCC is also exploring alternatives to an ETS to provide efficient abatement incentives (ICCC 2018).
Some discussion in New Zealand also focuses on a differential treatment of methane compared to nitrous oxide. Methane is a short-
lived gas with a perturbation lifetime of 12 years in the atmosphere; nitrous oxide on the other hand is a long-lived gas and remains 
in the atmosphere for 114 years (Allen et al. 2016). Long-lived gases have a cumulative and essentially irreversible effect on the 
climate (IPCC 2014b) so their emissions need to reduce to net-zero in order to avoid climate change. Short-lived gases, however, could 
potentially be reduced to a certain level and then stabilised, and would not contribute further to warming, leading to suggestions 
of treating these two gases separately in the ETS or alternative policy instruments, possibly setting different budgets and targets for 
each (New Zealand Productivity Commission 2018). Reisinger et al. (2013) demonstrate that different metrics can have important 
implications globally and potentially at national and regional scales on the costs and levels of abatement. 
While the details are still being agreed on in New Zealand, almost 80% of nationally determined contributions committed to action 
on mitigation in agriculture (FAO 2016), so countries will be looking for successful examples. 
Australia’s Emissions Reduction Fund, and the preceding Carbon Farming Initiative, are examples of baseline-and-credit schemes, 
which creates credits for activities that generate emissions below a baseline – effectively a subsidy (Freebairn 2016). It is a voluntary 
scheme, and has the potential to create real and additional emission reductions through projects reducing emissions and sequestering 
carbon (Verschuuren 2017) (low evidence, low agreement). Key success factors in the design of such an instrument are policy-
certainty for at least 10 to 20years, regulation that focuses on projects and not uniform rules, automated systems for all phases of the 
projects, and a wider focus of the carbon farming initiative on adaptation, food security, sustainable farm business, and creating jobs 
(Verschuuren 2017). A recent review highlighted the issue of permanence and reversal, and recommended that projects detail how 
they will maintain carbon in their projects, and deal with the risk of fire.

7.4.4.4 
Technology transfer and land-use sectors
Technology transfer has been part of the UNFCCC process since its 
inception and is a key element of international climate mitigation and 
adaptation efforts under the Paris Agreement. The IPCC definition of 
‘technology transfer’ includes transfer of knowledge and technological 
cooperation (see Glossary) and can include modifications to suit 
local conditions and/or integration with indigenous technologies 
(Metz et al. 2000). This definition suggests greater heterogeneity in 
the applications for climate mitigation and adaptation, especially in 
land-use sectors where indigenous knowledge may be important for 
long-term climate resilience (Nyong et al. 2007). For land-use sectors, 
the typical reliance on trade and patent data for empirical analyses is 
generally not feasible as the ‘technology’ in question is often related 
to resource management and is neither patentable nor tradable 
(Glachant and Dechezleprêtre 2017) and ill-suited to provide socially 
beneficially innovation for poorer farmers in developing countries 
(Lybbert and Sumner 2012; Baker et al. 2017).
Technology transfer has contributed to emissions reductions (medium 
confidence). A detailed study for nearly 4000 Clean Development 
Mechanism (CDM) projects showed that 39% of projects had a stated 
and actual technology transfer component, accounting for 59% of 
emissions reductions; however, the more land-intensive projects 
(e.g., afforestation, bioenergy) showed lower percentages (Murphy 
et al. 2015). Bioenergy projects that rely on agricultural residues 
offer substantially more development benefits than those based 
on industrial residues from forests (Lee and Lazarus 2013). Energy 
projects tended to have a greater degree of technology transfer 
under the CDM compared to non-energy projects (Gandenberger 
et al. 2016). However, longer-term cooperation and collaborative 
R&D approaches to technology transfer will be more important in 
land-use sectors (compared to energy or industry) due to the time 
needed for improved resource management and interaction between 
researchers, practitioners and policymakers. These approaches offer 
longer-term technology transfer that is more difficult to measure 
compared to specific cooperation projects; empirical research on the 
effects of R&D collaboration could help to avoid the ‘one-policy-fits-
all’ approach (Ockwell et al. 2015).
There is increasing recognition of the role of technology transfer in 
climate adaptation, but in the land-use sector there are inherent 
adoption challenges specific to adaptation, due to uncertainties 
arising from changing climatic conditions, agricultural prices, and 
suitability under future conditions (Biagini et al. 2014). Engaging the 
private sector is important, as adoption of new technologies can only 
be replicated with significant private sector involvement (Biagini and 
Miller 2013). 
7.4.4.5 
International cooperation under the Paris Agreement 
New cooperative mechanisms under the Paris Agreement illustrate 
the shift away from the Kyoto Protocol’s emphasis on obligations 
of developed country Parties to pursue investments and technology 
transfer, to a more pragmatic, decentralised and collaborative 
approach (Savaresi 2016; Jiang et al. 2017). These approaches can 
effectively include any combination of measures or instruments 
related to adaptation, mitigation, finance, technology transfer and 
capacity building, which could be of particular interest in land-use 
sectors where such aspects are more intertwined than in energy or 
industry sectors. Article 6 sets out several options for international 
cooperation (Gupta and Dube 2018). 
The close relationship between emission reductions, adaptive capacity, 
food security and other sustainability and governance objectives in 
the land sectors means that Article 6 could bring co-benefits that 
increase its attractiveness and the availability of finance, while also 
bringing risks that need to be monitored and mitigated against, such 
as uncertainties in measurements and the risk of non-permanence 
(Thamo and Pannell 2016; Olsson et al. 2016; Schwartz et al. 2017). 
There has been progress in accounting for land-based emissions, 
mainly forestry and agriculture (medium evidence, low agreement), 
but various challenges remain (Macintosh 2012; Pistorius et al. 2017; 
Krug 2018).
Like the CDM and other existing carbon trading mechanisms, 
participation in Article 6.2 and 6.4 of the Paris Agreement requires 
certain institutional and data management capacities in the land 
sector to effectively benefit from the cooperation opportunities 
(Totin et al. 2018). While the rules for the implementation of the 
new mechanisms are still under development, lessons from REDD+ 
(reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) may 
be useful, which is perceived as more democratic and participative 
than the CDM (Maraseni and Cadman 2015). Experience with 
REDD+ programmes emphasise the necessity to invest in ‘readiness’ 
programmes that assist countries to engage in strategic planning 
and build management and data collection systems to develop the 
capacity and infrastructure to participate in REDD+ (Minang et al. 
2014). The overwhelming majority of countries (93%) cite weak 
forest sector governance and institutions in their applications for 
REDD+ readiness funding (Kissinger et al. 2012). Technology transfer 
for advanced remote sensing technologies that help to reduce 
uncertainty in monitoring forests helps to achieve REDD+ ‘readiness’ 
(Goetz et al. 2015).
As well as new opportunities for finance and support, the Paris 
cooperation mechanisms and the associated roles for technology 
transfer bring new challenges, particularly in reporting, verifying 
and accounting in land-use sectors. Since developing countries 
must now achieve, measure and communicate emission reductions, 
they now have value for both developing and developed countries 
in achieving their NDCs, but reductions cannot be double-counted 
(i.e., towards multiple NDCs). All countries have to prepare and 
communicate NDCs, and many countries have included in their 
NDCs either economy-wide targets that include the land-use sectors, 
or specific targets for the land-use sectors. The Katowice climate 
package clarifies that all Parties have to submit ‘Biennial Transparency 
Reports’ from 2024 onwards, using common reporting formats, 
following most recent IPCC Guidelines (use of the 2013 Supplement 
on Wetlands is encouraged), identifying key categories of emissions, 
ensuring time-series consistency, and providing completeness and 
uncertainty assessments as well as quality control (UNFCCC 2018a; 
Schneider and La Hoz Theuer 2019). In total, the ambiguity in how 
countries incorporate land-use sectors into their NDC is estimated 
705
Risk management and decision-making in relation to sustainable development 
Chapter 7

to lead to an uncertainty of more than 2  GtCO2 in 2030 (Fyson 
and Jeffery 2018). Uncertainty is lower if the analysis is limited to 
countries that have provided separate land-use sector targets in their 
NDCs (Benveniste et al. 2018).
7.4.5 
Policies responding to desertifi cation and 
degradation – Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN)
Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) (SDG Target 15.3), evolved from 
the concept of Net Zero Land Degradation, which was introduced by 
the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertifi cation (UNCCD) 
to promote SLM (Kust et al. 2017; Stavi and Lal 2015; Chasek et al. 
2015). Neutrality here implies no net loss of the land-based natural 
resource and ES relative to a baseline or a reference state (UNCCD 
2015; Kust et al. 2017; Easdale 2016; Cowie et al. 2018a; Stavi and 
Lal 2015; Grainger 2015; Chasek et al. 2015). LDN can be achieved 
by reducing the rate of land degradation (and concomitant loss of ES) 
and increasing the rate of restoration and rehabilitation of degraded 
or desertifi ed land. Therefore, the rate of global land degradation 
is not to exceed that of land restoration in order to achieve LDN 
goals (adopted as national platform for actions by more than 100 
countries) (Stavi and Lal 2015; Grainger 2015; Chasek et al. 2015; 
Cowie et al. 2018a; Montanarella 2015). Achieving LDN would 
decrease the environmental footprint of agriculture, while supporting 
food security and sustaining human well-being (UNCCD 2015; Safriel 
2017; Stavi and Lal 2015; Kust et al. 2017).
Response hierarchy – avoiding, reducing and reversing land 
degradation – is the main policy response (Chasek et al. 2019, 
Wonder and Bodle 2019, Cowie et al. 2018, Orr et al. 2017). The LDN 
response hierarchy encourages through regulation, planning and 
management instruments, the adoption of diverse measures to avoid, 
reduce and reverse land degradation in order to achieve LDN (Cowie 
et al. 2018b; Orr et al. 2017).
Chapter  3  categorised policy responses into two categories; 
(i) avoiding, reducing and reversing it through SLM; and (ii) providing 
alternative livelihoods with economic diversifi cation. LDN could be 
achieved through planned effective actions, particularly by motivated 
stakeholders – those who play an essential role in a  land-based 
climate change adaptation (Easdale 2016; Qasim et al. 2011; Cowie 
et al. 2018a; Salvati and Carlucci 2014). Human activities impacting 
the sustainability of drylands is a key consideration in adequately 
reversing degradation through restoration or rehabilitation of 
degraded land (Easdale 2016; Qasim et al. 2011; Cowie et al. 2018a; 
Salvati and Carlucci 2014).
LDN actions and activities play an essential role for a land-based 
approach to climate change adaptation (UNCCD 2015). Policies 
responding to degradation and desertifi cation include improving 
market access, gender empowerment, expanding access to rural 
advisory services, strengthening land tenure security, payments 
for ES, decentralised natural resource management, investing 
in  R&D, modern renewable energy sources and monitoring of 
desertifi cation and desert storms, developing modern renewable 
energy sources, and developing and strengthening climate services. 
Policy supporting economic diversifi cation includes investing in 
irrigation, expanding agricultural commercialisation, and facilitating 
structural transformations in rural economies (Chapter  3). Policies 
and actions also include promoting indigenous and local knowledge 
(ILK), soil conservation, agroforestry, crop-livestock interactions 
as an approach to manage land degradation, and forest-based 
activities such as afforestation, reforestation, and changing forest

management (Chapter  4). Measures identified for achievement of 
LDN include effective financial mechanisms (for implementation 
of land restoration measures and the long-term monitoring of 
progress), parameters for assessing land degradation, detailed plans 
with quantified objectives and timelines (Kust et al. 2017; Sietz et al. 
2017; Cowie et al. 2018a; Montanarella 2015; Stavi and Lal 2015).
Implementing the international LDN target into national policies has 
been a challenge (Cowie et al. 2018a; Grainger 2015) as baseline 
land degradation or desertification information is not always 
available (Grainger 2015) and challenges exist in monitoring LDN 
as it is a dynamic process (Sietz et al. 2017; Grainger 2015; Cowie 
et al. 2018a). Wunder and Bodle (2019) propose that LDN be 
implemented and monitored through indicators at the national 
level. Effective implementation of global LDN will be supported by 
integrating lessons learned from existing programmes designed for 
other environmental objectives and closely coordinate LDN activities 
with actions for climate change adaptation and mitigation at both 
global and national levels (high confidence) (Stavi and Lal 2015; 
Grainger 2015).
7.4.6 
Policies responding to land degradation
7.4.6.1 
Land-use zoning
Land-use zoning divides a territory (including local, sub-regional or 
national) into zones with different rules and regulations for land 
use (mining, agriculture, urban development, etc.), management 
practices and land-cover change (Metternicht 2018). While the policy 
instrument is zoning ordinances, the process of determining these 
regulations is covered in integrated land-use planning (Section 7.6.2). 
Urban zoning can guide new growth in urban communities outside 
forecasted hazard areas, assist relocating existing dwellings to safer 
sites and manage post-event redevelopment in ways to reduce 
future vulnerability (Berke and Stevens 2016). Holistic integration of 
climate mitigation and adaptation are interdependent and can be 
implemented by restoring urban forests, and improving parks (Brown 
2010; Berke and Stevens 2016). Zoning ordinances can contribute 
to SLM through protection of natural capital by preventing or 
limiting vegetation clearing, avoiding degradation of planning for 
rehabilitation of degraded land or contaminated sites, promoting 
conservation and enhancement of ecosystems and ecological 
corridors (Metternicht 2018; Jepson and Haines 2014). Zoning 
ordinances can also encourage higher density development, mixed 
use, local food production, encourage transportation alternatives 
(bike paths and transit-oriented development), preserve a sense of 
place, and increase housing diversity and affordability (Jepson and 
Haines 2014). Conservation planning varies by context and may 
include one or several adaptation approaches, including protecting 
current patterns of biodiversity, large intact natural landscapes, 
and geophysical settings. Conservation planning may also maintain 
and restore ecological connectivity, identify and manage areas that 
provide future climate space for species expected to be displaced by 
climate change, and identify and protect climate refugia (Stevanovic 
et al. 2016; Schmitz et al. 2015).
Anguelovski et al. (2016) studied land-use interventions in eight 
cities in the global north and south, and concluded that historic 
trends of socio-economic vulnerability can be reinforced. They also 
found that vulnerability could be avoided with a consideration of 
the distribution of adaptation benefits and prioritising beneficial 
outcomes for disadvantaged and vulnerable groups when making 
future adaptation plans. Concentration of adaptation resources 
within wealthy business districts creating ecological enclaves 
exacerbated climate risks elsewhere and building of climate adaptive 
infrastructure such as sea walls or temporary flood barriers occurred 
at the expense of underserved neighbourhoods (Anguelovski 
et al. 2016a).
7.4.6.2 
Conserving biodiversity and ecosystem services (ES)
There is limited evidence but high agreement that ecosystem-based 
adaptation (biodiversity, ecosystem services (ES), and Nature’s 
Contribution to People (see Chapter  6)) and incentives for ES  – 
including payment for ecosystem services (PES) – play a critical part 
of an overall strategy to help people adapt to the adverse effects of 
climate change on land (UNEP 2009; Bonan 2008; Millar et al. 2007; 
Thompson et al. 2009).
Ecosystem-based adaptation can promote socio-ecological resilience 
by enabling people to adapt to the impacts of climate change on 
land and reduce their vulnerability (Ojea 2015). Ecosystem-based 
adaptation can promote nature conservation while alleviating 
poverty and even provide co-benefits by removing GHGs (Scarano 
2017) and protecting livelihoods (Munang et al. 2013). For example, 
mangroves provide diverse ES such as carbon storage, fisheries, 
non-timber forest products, erosion protection, water purification, 
shore-line stabilisation, and also regulate storm surge and flooding 
damages, thus enhancing resilience and reducing climate risk from 
extreme events such as cyclones (Rahman et al. 2014; Donato et al. 
2011; Das and Vincent 2009; Ghosh et al. 2015; Ewel et al. 1998).
There has been considerable increase in the last decade of PES, or 
programmes that exchange value for land management practices 
intended to ensure ES (Salzman et al. 2018; Yang and Lu 2018; Barbier 
2011). However, there is a deficiency in comprehensive and reliable 
data concerning the impact of PES on ecosystems, human well-being, 
their efficiency, and effectiveness (Pynegar et al. 2018; Reed et al. 
2014; Salzman et al. 2018; Barbier 2011; Yang and Lu 2018). While 
some studies assess ecological effectiveness and social equity, fewer 
assess economic efficiency (Yang and Lu 2018). Part of the challenge 
surrounds the fact that the majority of ES are not marketed, so 
determining how changes in ecosystems structures, functions and 
processes influence the quantity and quality of ES flows to people 
is challenging (Barbier 2011). PES include agri-environmental 
targeted outcome-based payments, but challenges exist in relation 
to scientific uncertainty, pricing, timing of payments, increasing risk 
to land managers, World Trade Organization compliance, and barriers 
of land management and scale (Reed et al. 2014).
PES is contested (Wang and Fu 2013; Czembrowski and Kronenberg 
2016; Perry 2015) for four reasons: (i) understanding and resolving 
trade-offs between conflicting groups of stakeholders (Wam et al. 
707
Risk management and decision-making in relation to sustainable development 
Chapter 7
7
2016; Matthies et al. 2015); (ii) knowledge and technology capacity 
(Menz et al. 2013); (iii) challenges integrating PES with economic 
and other policy instruments (Ring and Schröter-Schlaack 2011; Tallis 
et al. 2008; Elmqvist et al. 2003; Albert et al. 2014); and (iv) top-down 
climate change mitigation initiatives which are still largely 
carbon-centric, with limited opportunities for decentralised ecological 
restoration at local and regional scales (Vijge and Gupta 2014).
These challenges and contestations can be resolved with the 
participation of people in establishing PES, thereby addressing trust 
issues, negative attitudes, and resolving trade-offs between issues 
(such as retaining forests that consume water versus the provision 
of run-off, or balancing payments to providers versus cost to society) 
(Sorice et al. 2018; Matthies et al. 2015). Similarly, a ‘co-constructive’ 
approach is used involving a  diversity of stakeholders generating 
policy-relevant knowledge for sustainable management of 
biodiversity and ES at all relevant spatial scales, by the current 
Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and 
Ecosystem Services (IPBES) initiative (Díaz et al. 2015). Invasive 
species are also best identified and managed with the participation 
of people through collective decisions, coordinated programmes, 
and extensive research and outreach to address their complex 
social-ecological impacts (Wittmann et al. 2016; Epanchin-Niell 
et al. 2010).
Ecosystem restoration with co-benefits for diverse ES can be achieved 
through passive restoration, passive restoration with protection, and 
active restoration with planting (Birch et al. 2010; Cantarello et al. 
2010). Taking into account the costs of restoration and co-benefits 
from bundles of ES (carbon, tourism, timber), the benefit-cost ratio 
(BCR) of active restoration and passive restoration with protection 
was always less than 1, suggesting that financial incentives would be 
required. Passive restoration was the most cost-effective with a BCR 
generally between 1  and 100 for forest, grassland and shrubland 
restoration (TEEB 2009; Cantarello et al. 2010). Passive restoration 
is generally more cost-effective, but there is a danger that it could 
be confused with abandoned land in the absence of secure tenure 
and a  long time period (Zahawi et al. 2014). Net social benefits 
of degraded land restoration in dry regions range from about 
200–700 USD per hectare (Cantarello et al. 2010). Investments in 
active restoration could benefit from analyses of past land use, the 
natural resilience of the ecosystem, and the specific objectives of 
each project (Meli et al. 2017). One successful example is the Working 
for Water Programme in South Africa that linked restoration through 
removal of invasive species and enhanced water security (Milton et 
al. 2003).
Forest, water and energy cycle interactions and teleconnections such 
as contribution to rainfall potentially (Aragão 2012; Ellison et al. 
2017; Paul et al. 2018; Spracklen et al. 2012) provide a foundation 
for achieving forest-based adaptation and mitigation goals. They are, 
however, poorly integrated in policy and decision-making, including 
PES (Section 2.5.4).
7.4.6.3 
Standards and certification for sustainability 
of biomass and land-use sectors
During the past two decades, standards and certification have 
emerged as important sustainability and conservation instruments for 
agriculture, forestry, bioenergy, land-use management and bio-based 
products (Lambin et al. 2014; Englund and Berndes 2015; Milder 
et al. 2015; Giessen et al. 2016a; Endres et al. 2015; Byerlee et al. 
2015; van Dam et al. 2010). Standards are normally voluntary, but 
can also become obligatory through legislation. A standard provides 
specifications or guidelines to ensure that materials, products, 
processes and services are fit for purpose, whereas certification 
is the procedure through which an accredited party confirms that 
a product, process or service is in conformity with certain standards. 
Standards and certification are normally carried out by separate 
organisations for legitimacy and accountability (Section 7.6.6). The 
International Organization for Standardization is a  key source for 
global environmental standards. Those with special relevance for land 
and climate include a recent standard on combating land degradation 
and desertification (ISO 2017) and an earlier standard on sustainable 
bioenergy and biomass use (ISO 2015; Walter et al. 2018). Both aim 
to support the long-term transition to a climate-resilient bioeconomy; 
there is medium evidence on the sustainability implications of 
different bioeconomy pathways, but low agreement as to which 
pathways are socially and environmentally desirable (Priefer et al. 
2017; Johnson 2017; Bennich et al. 2017a).
Table 7.3 provides a summary of selected standards and certification 
schemes with a focus on land use and climate: the tickmark shows 
inclusion of different sustainability elements, with all recognising 
the inherent linkages between the biophysical and social aspects of 
land use. Some certification schemes and best practice guidelines are 
specific to a particular agriculture crop (e.g., soya, sugarcane) or a tree 
(e.g., oil palm) while others are general. International organisations 
promote sustainable land and biomass use through good practice 
guidelines, voluntary standards and jurisdictional approaches (Scarlat 
and Dallemand 2011; Stattman et al. 2018a). Other frameworks, such 
as the Global Bioenergy Partnership (GBEP) focus on monitoring land 
and biomass use through a set of indicators that are applied across 
partner countries, thereby also promoting technology/knowledge 
transfer (GBEP 2017). The Economics of Land Degradation (ELD) 
Initiative provides common guidelines for economic assessments of 
land degradation (Nkonya et al. 2013).
Whereas current standards and certification focus primarily on 
land, climate and biomass impacts where they occur, more recent 
analysis considers trade-related land-use change by tracing supply 
chain impacts from producer to consumer, leading to the notion of 
‘imported deforestation’ that occurs from increasing demand and 
trade in unsustainable forest and agriculture products, which is 
estimated to account for 26% of all tropical deforestation (Pendrill 
et al. 2019). Research and implementation efforts aim to improve 
supply chain transparency and promote commitments to ‘zero 
deforestation’ (Gardner et al. 2018a; Garrett et al. 2019; Newton 
et al. 2018; Godar and Gardner 2019; Godar et al. 2015, 2016). 
France has developed specific policies on imported deforestation

that are expected to eventually include a ‘zero deforestation’ label 
(Government of France 2019).
The sustainability of biofuels and bioenergy has been in particular 
focus during the past decade or so due to biofuel mandates and 
renewable energy policies in the USA, EU and elsewhere (van Dam 
et al. 2010; Scarlat and Dallemand 2011). The European Union 
Renewable Energy Directive (EU-RED) established sustainability 
criteria in relation to EU renewable energy targets in the transport 
sector (European Commission 2012), which subsequently had 
impacts on land use and trade with third-party countries (Johnson et 
al. 2012). In particular, the EU-RED marked a departure in the context 
of Kyoto/UNFCCC guidelines by extending responsibility for emissions 
beyond the borders of final use, and requiring developing countries 
wishing to sell into the EU market to meet the sustainability criteria 
(Johnson 2011b). The recently revised EU-RED provides sustainability 
criteria that include management of land and forestry as well as 
socio-economic aspects (European Union 2018; Faaij 2018; Stattman 
et al. 2018b). Standards and certification aim to address potential 
conflicts between different uses of biomass, and most schemes 
also consider co-benefits and synergies (see Cross-Chapter Box 7 in 
Chapter 6). Bioenergy may offer additional income and livelihoods 
to farmers as well as improvements in technical productivity and 
multi-functional landscapes (Rosillo Callé and Johnson 2010a; 
Kline et al. 2017; Araujo Enciso et al. 2016). Results depend on the 
commodities involved, and also differ between rural and urban areas.
Analyses on the implementation of standards and certification for 
land and biomass use have focused on their stringency, effectiveness 
and geographical scope as well as socio-economic impacts such as 
land tenure, gender and land rights (Diaz-Chavez 2011; German and 
Schoneveld 2012; Meyer and Priess 2014). The level of stringency and 
enforcement varies with local environmental conditions, governance 
approaches and the nature of the feedstock produced (Endres 
et al. 2015; Lambin et al. 2014; Giessen et al. 2016b; Stattman et 
al. 2018b). There is low evidence and low agreement on how the 
application and use of standards and certification has actually 
improved sustainability beyond the local farm, factory or plantation 
level; the lack of harmonisation and consistency across countries 
that has been observed, even within a common market or economic 
region such as the EU, presents a barrier to wider market impacts 
(Endres et al. 2015; Stattman et al. 2018b; ISEAL Alliance 2018). In the 
forest sector, there is evidence that certification programmes such as 
the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) have reduced deforestation in 
the aggregate, as well as reducing air pollution (Miteva et al. 2015; 
Mcdermott et al. 2015). Certification and standards cannot address 
global systemic concerns such as impacts on food prices or other 
market-wide effects, but rather are aimed primarily at insuring 
best practices in the local context. More general approaches to 
certification such as the Gold Standard are designed to accelerate 
progress toward the SDGs as well as the Paris Climate Agreement 
by certifying investment projects while also emphasising support to 
governments (Gold Standard).
7.4.6.4 
Energy access and biomass use
Access to modern energy services is a key component of SDG 7, with an 
estimated 1.1 billion people lacking access to electricity, while nearly 
3 billion people rely on traditional biomass (fuelwood, agriculture 
residues, animal dung, charcoal) for household energy needs (IEA 
2017). Lack of access to modern energy services is significant in the 
context of land-climate systems because heavy reliance on traditional 
biomass can contribute to land degradation, household air pollution 
and GHG emissions (see Cross-Chapter Box  12  in Chapter  7). 
A variety of policy instruments and programmes have been aimed 
at improving energy access and thereby reducing the heavy reliance 
on traditional biomass (Table 7.2); there is high evidence and high 
agreement that programmes and policies that reduce dependence 
on traditional biomass will have benefits for health and household 
productivity, as well as reducing land degradation (Section  4.5.4) 
and GHG emissions (Bailis et al. 2015; Cutz et al. 2017a; Masera 
et al. 2015; Goldemberg et al. 2018a; Sola et al. 2016a; Rao and 
Pachauri 2017; Denton et al. 2014). There can be trade-offs across 
different options, especially between health and climate benefits, 
since more efficient wood stoves might have only limited effect, 
whereas gaseous and liquid fuels (e.g., biogas, LPG, bioethanol) will 
have highly positive health benefits and climate benefits that vary 
depending on specific circumstances of the substitution (Cameron 
et al. 2016; Goldemberg et al. 2018b). Unlike traditional biomass, 
modern bioenergy offers high-quality energy services, although, for 
household cookstoves, even the cleanest options using wood may 
not perform as well in terms of health and/or climate benefits (Fuso 
Nerini et al. 2017; Goldemberg et al. 2018b).
Case study |  Forest conservation instruments: REDD+ in the Amazon and India
More than 50 countries have developed national REDD+ strategies, which have key conditions for addressing deforestation and forest 
degradation (improved monitoring capacities, understanding of drivers, increased stakeholder involvement, and providing a platform 
to secure indigenous and community land rights). However, to achieve its original objectives and to be effective under current 
conditions, forest-based mitigation actions need to be incorporated in national development plans and official climate strategies, and 
mainstreamed across sectors and levels of government (Angelsen et al. 2018a).
The Amazon region can illustrate the complexity of the implementation of REDD+, in the most biodiverse place on the planet, 
with millions of inhabitants and hundreds of ethnic groups, under the jurisdiction of eight countries. While different experiences can 
be drawn at different spatial scales, at the regional-level, for example, Amazon Fund (van der Hoff et al. 2018), at the subnational level 
(Furtado 2018), and at the local level (Alvarez et al. 2016; Simonet et al. 2019), there is medium evidence and high agreement that

Case Study (continued)
REDD+ has stimulated sustainable land-use investments but is also competing with other land uses (e.g., agroindustry) and scarce 
international funding (both public and private) (Bastos Lima et al. 2017b; Angelsen et al. 2018b).
In the Amazon, at the local level, a critical issue has been the incorporation of indigenous people in the planning and distribution 
of benefits of REDD+ projects. While REDD+, in some cases, has enhanced participation of community members in the policy-planning 
process, fund management, and carbon baseline establishment, increasing project reliability and equity (West 2016), it is clear that, 
in this region, insecure and overlapping land rights, as well as unclear and contradictory institutional responsibilities, are probably 
the major problems for REDD+ implementation (Loaiza et al. 2017). Despite legal and rhetoric recognition of indigenous land rights, 
effective recognition is still lacking (Aguilar-Støen 2017). The key to the success of REDD+ in the Amazon, has been the application 
of both incentives and disincentives on key safeguard indicators, including land security, participation, and well-being (Duchelle 
et al. 2017).
On the other hand, at the subnational level, REDD+ has been unable to shape land-use dynamics or landscape governance, in areas 
suffering strong exogenous factors, such as extractive industries, and in the absence of effective regional regulation for sustainable land 
use (Rodriguez-Ward et al. 2018; Bastos Lima et al. 2017b). Moreover, projects with weak financial incentives, engage households with 
high off-farm income, which are already better off than the poorest families (Loaiza et al. 2015). Beyond operational issues, clashing 
interpretations of results might create conflict between implementing countries or organisations and donor countries, which have 
revealed concerns over the performance of projects (van der Hoff et al. 2018) REDD+ Amazonian projects often face methodological 
issues, including how to assess the opportunity cost among landholders, and informing REDD+ implementation (Kweka et al. 2016). 
REDD+ based projects depend on consistent environmental monitoring methodologies for measuring, reporting and verification and, 
in the Amazon, land-cover estimates are crucial for environmental monitoring efforts (Chávez Michaelsen et al. 2017).
In India, forests and wildlife concerns are on the concurrent list of the Constitution since an amendment in 1976, thus giving the 
central or federal government a strong role in matters related to governance of forests. High rates of deforestation due to development 
projects led to the Forest (Conservation) Act (1980) which requires central government approval for diversion of forest land in any 
state or union territory.
Before 2006, forest diversion for development projects leading to deforestation needed clearance from the Central Government under 
the provisions of the Forest (Conservation Act) 1980. In order to regulate forest diversion, and as payment for ES, a net present value 
(NPV) frame-work was introduced by the Supreme Court of India, informed by the Kanchan Chopra committee (Chopra 2017). The 
Forest (Conservation) Act of 1980 requires compensatory afforestation in lieu of forest diversion, and the Supreme Court established the 
Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA) which collects funds for compensatory afforestation 
and on account of NPV from project developers.
As of February 2018, 6825 million USD had accumulated in CAMPA funds in lieu of NPV paid by developers diverting forest land 
throughout India for non-forest use. Funds are released by the central government to state governments for afforestation and 
conservation-related activities to ‘compensate’ for diversion of forests. This is now governed by legislation called the CAMPA Act, 
passed by the Parliament of India in July 2016. The CAMPA mechanism has, however, invited criticism on various counts in terms 
of undervaluation of forest, inequality, lack of participation and environmental justice (Temper and Martinez-Alier 2013).
The other significant development related to forest land was the landmark legislation called the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional 
Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 or Forest Rights Act (FRA) passed by the Parliament of India in 2007. This is the 
largest forest tenure legal instrument in the world and attempted to undo historical injustice to forest dwellers and forest-dependent 
communities whose traditional rights and access were legally denied under forest and wildlife conservation laws. The FRA recognises 
the right to individual land titles on land already cleared, as well as community forest rights such as collection of forest produce. 
A total of 64,328 community forest rights and a total of 17,040,343 individual land titles had been approved and granted up to the 
end of 2017. Current concerns on policy and implementation gaps are about strengths and pitfalls of decentralisation, identifying 
genuine right holders, verification of land rights using technology and best practices, and curbing illegal claims (Sarap et al. 2013; 
Reddy et al. 2011; Aggarwal 2011; Ramnath 2008; Ministry of Environment and Forests and Ministry and Tribal Affairs, Government 
of India 2010).

7.4.7 
Economic and financial instruments 
for adaptation, mitigation, and land
There is an urgent need to increase the volume of climate financing 
and bridge the gap between global adaptation needs and available 
funds (medium confidence) (Masson-Delmotte et al. 2018; Kissinger 
et al. 2019; Chambwera and Heal 2014), especially in relation 
to agriculture (FAO 2010). The land sector offers the potential to 
balance the synergies between mitigation and adaptation (Locatelli 
et al. 2016) – although context and unavailability of data sets makes 
cost comparisons between mitigation and adaptation difficult 
(UNFCCC 2018b). Estimates of adaptation costs range from 140 to 
300 billion USD by 2030, and between 280 and 500 billion USD by 
2050; (UNEP 2016). These figures vary according to methodologies 
and approaches (de Bruin et al. 2009; IPCC 2014 2014; OECD 2008; 
Nordhaus 1999; UNFCCC 2007; Plambeck et al. 1997).
7.4.7.1 
Financing mechanisms for land mitigation 
and adaptation
There is a startling array of diverse and fragmented climate finance 
sources: more than 50 international public funds, 60 carbon markets, 
6000 private equity funds, 99 multilateral and bilateral climate 
funds (Samuwai and Hills 2018). Most public finance for developing 
countries flows through bilateral and multilateral institutions such 
as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, International 
Finance Corporation, regional development banks, as well as 
specialised multilateral institutions such as the Global Environmental 
Fund, and the EU Solidarity Fund. Some governments have established 
state investment banks (SIBs) to close the financing gap, including 
the UK (Green Investment Bank), Australia (Clean Energy Finance 
Corporation) and in Germany (Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau) the 
Development Bank has been involved in supporting low-carbon 
Case Study (continued)
As per the FRA, the forest rights shall be conferred free of all encumbrances and procedural requirements. Furthermore, without the 
FRA’s provision for getting the informed consent of local communities for both diversion of community forest land and for reforestation, 
there would be legal and administrative hurdles in using existing forest land for implementation of India’s ambitious Green India 
Mission that aims to respond to climate change by a combination of adaptation and mitigation measures in the forestry sector. It aims 
to increase forest/tree cover to the extent of 5 million hectares (Mha) and improve quality of forest/tree cover on another 5 Mha of 
forest/non-forest lands and support forest-based livelihoods of 3 million families and generate co-benefits through ES (Government 
of India 2010).
Thus, the community forest land recognised under FRA can be used for the purpose of compensatory afforestation or restoration 
under REDD+ only with informed consent of the communities and a decentralised mechanism for using CAMPA funds. India’s forest 
and forest restoration can potentially move away from a top-down carbon centric model with the effective participation of local 
communities (Vijge and Gupta 2014; Murthy et al. 2018a).
India has also experimented with the world’s first national inter-governmental ecological fiscal transfer (EFT) from central to local and 
state government to reward them for retaining forest cover. In 2014, India’s 14th Finance Commission added forest cover to the 
formula that determines the amount of tax revenue the central government distributes annually to each of India’s 29 states. It is 
estimated that, in four years, it would have distributed 6.9–12 billion USD per year to states in proportion to their 2013 forest cover, 
amounting to around 174–303 USD per hectare of forest per year (Busch and Mukherjee 2017). State governments in India now have 
a sizeable fiscal incentive based on extent of forest cover at the time of policy implementation, contributing to the achievement of 
India’s climate mitigation and forest conservation goals. India’s tax revenue distribution reform has created the world’s first EFTs for 
forest conservation, and a potential model for other countries. However, it is to be noted that EFT is calculated based on a one-time 
estimate of forest cover prior to policy implementation, hence does not incentivise ongoing protection and this is a policy gap. It’s still 
too early but its impact on trends in forest cover in the future and its ability to conserve forests without other investments and policy 
instruments is promising but untested (Busch and Mukherjee 2017; Busch 2018).
In order to build on the new promising policy developments on forest rights and fiscal incentives for forest conservation in India, 
incentivising ongoing protection, further investments in monitoring (Busch 2018), decentralisation (Somanathan et al. 2009) and 
promoting diverse non-agricultural forest and range of land-based livelihoods (e.g., sustainable non-timber forest product extraction, 
regulated pastures, carbon credits for forest regeneration on marginal agriculture land and ecotourism revenues) as part of individual 
and community forest tenure and rights are ongoing concerns. Decentralised sharing of CAMPA funds between government and local 
communities for forest restoration as originally suggested and filling in implementation gaps could help reconcile climate change 
mitigation through forest conservation, REDD+ and environmental justice (Vijge and Gupta 2014; Temper and Martinez-Alier 2013; 
Badola et al. 2013; Sun and Chaturvedi 2016; Murthy et al. 2018b; Chopra 2017; Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, 
and Ministry of Tribal Affairs, Government of India 2010).

finance (Geddes et al. 2018). The Green Climate Fund (GCF) now 
offers additional finance, but is still a new institution with policy gaps, 
a lengthy and cumbersome process related to approval (Brechin and 
Espinoza 2017; Khan and Roberts 2013; Mathy and Blanchard 2016), 
and challenges with adequate and sustained funding (Schalatek and 
Nakhooda 2013). Private adaptation finance exists, but is difficult to 
define, track, and coordinate (Nakhooda et al. 2016).
The amount of funding dedicated to agriculture, land degradation or 
desertification is very small compared to total climate finance (FAO 
2010). Funding for agriculture (rather than mitigation) is accessed 
through the smaller adaptation funds (Lobell et al. 2013). Focusing 
on synergies, between mitigation, adaptation, and increased 
productivity, such as through climate-smart agriculture (CSA) (Lipper 
et al. 2014b) (Section 7.5.6), may leverage greater financial resources 
(Suckall et al. 2015; Locatelli et al. 2016). Payments for ecosystem 
services (Section  7.4.6) are another emerging area to encourage 
environmentally desirable practices, although they need to be 
carefully designed to be effective (Engel and Muller 2016).
The UNCCD established the Land Degradation Neutrality Fund 
(LDN Fund) to mobilise finance and scale-up land restoration and 
sustainable business models on restored land to achieve the target of 
a land degradation neutral world (SDG target 15.3) by 2030. The LDN 
Fund generates revenues from sustainable use of natural resources, 
creating green job opportunities, sequestering CO2, and increasing 
food and water security (Cowie et al. 2018a; Akhtar-Schuster et al. 
2017). The fund leverages public money to raise private capital for 
SLM and land restoration projects (Quatrini and Crossman 2018; 
Stavi and Lal 2015). Many small-scale projects are demonstrating 
that sustainable landscape management (Section  7.6.3) is key to 
achieving LDN, and it is also more financially viable in the long term 
than the unsustainable alternative (Tóth et al. 2018; Kust et al. 2017).
7.4.7.2 
Instruments to manage the financial impacts 
of climate and land change disruption
Comprehensive risk management (Section  7.4.3.1) designs 
a  portfolio of instruments which are used across a  continuum of 
preemptive, planning and assessment, and contingency measures in 
order to bolster resilience (Cummins and Weiss 2016) and address 
limitations of any one instrument (Surminski 2016; Surminski et al. 
2016; Linnerooth-bayer et al. 2019). Instruments designed and 
applied in isolation have shown short-term results, rather than 
sustained intended impacts (Vincent et al. 2018). Risk assessments 
limited to events and impacts on particular asset classes or sectors 
can misinform policy and drive misallocation of funding (Gallina et al. 
2016; Jongman et al. 2014).
Comprehensive risk assessment combined with risk layering 
approaches that assign different instruments to different magnitude 
and frequency of events, have better potential to provide stability 
to societies facing disruption (Mechler et al. 2014; Surminski et al. 
2016). Governments and citizens define limits of what they consider 
acceptable risks, risks for which market or other solutions can be 
developed and catastrophic risks that require additional public 
protection and intervention. Different financial tools may be used 
for these different categories of risk or phases of the risk cycle 
(preparedness, relief, recovery, reconstruction).
In order to protect lives and livelihoods early action is critical, 
including a coordinated plan for action agreed in advance, a fast, 
evidence-based decision-making process, and contingency financing 
to ensure that the plan can be implemented (Clarke and Dercon 
2016a). Forecast-based finance mechanisms incorporate these 
principles, using climate or other indicators to trigger funding and 
action prior to a shock (Wilkinson 2018). Forecast-based mechanisms 
can be linked with social protection systems by providing contingent 
scaled-up finance quickly to vulnerable populations following 
disasters, enhancing scalability, timeliness, predictability and 
adequacy of social protection benefits (Wilkinson 2018; Costella et 
al. 2017b; World Food Programme 2018).
Measures in advance of risks set aside resources before negative 
impacts related to adverse weather, climatic stressors, and land 
changes occur. These tools are frequently applied in extreme event, 
rapid onset contexts. These measures are the main instruments for 
reducing fatalities and limiting damage from extreme climate and 
land change events (Surminski et al. 2016). Finance tools in advance 
of risk include insurance (macro, meso, micro), green bonds, and 
forecast-based finance (Hunzai et al. 2018).
There is high confidence that insurance approaches that are designed 
to effectively reduce and communicate risks to the public and 
beneficiaries, designed to reduce risk and foster appropriate adaptive 
responses, and provide value in risk transfer, improve economic 
stability and social outcomes in both higher  – and lower-income 
contexts (Kunreuther and Lyster 2016; Outreville 2011b; Surminski 
et al. 2016; Kousky et al. 2018b), bolster food security, help keep 
children in school, and help safeguard the ability of low-income 
households to pay for essentials like medicines (Shiferaw et al. 2014; 
Hallegatte et al. 2017).
Low-income households show demand for affordable risk transfer 
tools, but demand is constrained by liquidity, lack of assets, financial 
and insurance literacy, or proof of identity required by institutions in 
the formal sector (Eling et al. 2014; Cole 2015; Cole et al. 2013; Ismail 
et al. 2017). Microinsurance participation takes many forms, including 
through mobile banking (Eastern Africa, Bangladesh), linked with 
social protection or other social stabilisation programmes (Ethiopia, 
Pakistan, India), through flood or drought protection schemes 
(Indonesia, the Philippines, the Caribbean, and Latin America), often 
in the form of weather index insurance. The insurance industry faces 
challenges due to low public awareness of how insurance works. 
Other challenges include risk, low capacity in financial systems 
to administer insurance, data deficits, and market imperfections 
(Mechler et al. 2014; Feyen et al. 2011; Gallagher 2014; Kleindorfer 
et al. 2012; Lazo et al.; Meyer and Priess 2014; Millo 2016).
Countries also request grant assistance, and contingency debt 
finance that includes dedicated funds, set aside for unpredictable 
climate-related disasters, household savings, and loans with 
‘catastrophe risk deferred drawdown option’ (which allows countries 
to divert loans from development objectives such as health, education, 
713
Risk management and decision-making in relation to sustainable development 
Chapter 7
7
and infrastructure to make immediate disbursement of funds in the 
event of a  disaster) (Kousky and Cooke 2012; Clarke and Dercon 
2016b). Contingency finance is suited to manage frequently occurring, 
low-impact events (Campillo et al. 2017; Mahul and Ghesquiere 2010; 
Roberts 2017) and may be linked with social protection systems. 
These instruments are limited by uncertainty surrounding the size 
of contingency fund reserves, given unpredictable climate disasters 
(Roberts 2017) and lack of borrowing capacity of a country (such as 
small island states) (Mahul and Ghesquiere 2010).
In part because of its link with debt burden, contingency, or 
post-event finance can disrupt development and is not suitable 
for higher consequence events and processes such as weather 
extremes or structural changes associated with climate and land 
change. Post-event finance of negative impacts such as sea level 
rise, soil salinisation, depletion of groundwater, and widespread land 
degradation, is likely to become infeasible for multiple, high-cost 
events and processes. There is high confidence that post-extreme 
event assistance may face more severe limitations, given the impacts 
of climate change (Linnerooth-bayer et al. 2019; Surminski et al. 
2016; Deryugina 2013; Dillon et al. 2014; Clarke 2016; Shreve and 
Kelman 2014; Von Peter et al. 2012).
In a catastrophe risk pool, multiple countries in a region pool risks in 
a  diversified portfolio. Examples include African Risk Capacity 
(ARC), the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF), 
and the Pacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment and Financing Initiative 
(PCRAFI) (Bresch et al. 2017; Iyahen and Syroka 2018). ARC payouts 
have been used to assist over  2.1  million food insecure people 
and provide more than 900,000 cattle with subsidised feed in the 
affected countries (Iyahen and Syroka 2018). ARC has also developed 
the Extreme Climate Facility, which is designed to complement 
existing bilateral, multilateral and private sources of finance to 
enable proactive adaptation (Vincent et al. 2018). It provides 
beneficiaries the opportunity to increase their benefit by reducing 
exposure to risk through adaptation and risk reduction measures, 
thus side-stepping ‘moral hazard’ problems sometimes associated 
with traditional insurance.
Governments pay coupon interest when purchasing catastrophe 
(CAT) bonds from private or corporate investors. In the case of the 
predefined catastrophe, the requirement to pay the coupon interest 
or repay the principal may be deferred or forgiven (Nguyen and 
Lindenmeier 2014). CAT bonds are typically short-term instruments 
(three to five years) and the payout is triggered once a particular 
threshold of disaster/damage is passed (Härdle and Cabrera 2010; 
Campillo et al. 2017; Estrin and Tan 2016; Hermann et al. 2016; 
Michel-Kerjan 2011; Roberts 2017). The primary advantage of CAT 
bonds is their ability to quickly disburse money in the event of 
a catastrophe (Estrin and Tan 2016). Green bonds, social impact bonds, 
and resilience bonds are other instruments that can be used to fund 
land-based interventions. However, there are significant barriers for 
developing country governments to enter into the bond market: lack 
of familiarity with the instruments; lack of capacity and resources to 
deal with complex legal arrangements; limited or non-existent data 
and modelling of disaster exposure; and other political disincentives 
linked to insurance. For these reasons, the utility and application 
of bonds is currently largely limited to higher-income developing 
countries (Campillo et al. 2017; Le Quesne 2017).
7.4.7.3 
Innovative financing approaches for transition 
to low-carbon economies
Traditional financing mechanisms have not been sufficient and 
thereby leave a gap in facilitating a rapid transition to a low-carbon 
economy or building resilience (Geddes et al. 2018). More recently 
there have been developments in more innovative mechanisms, 
including crowdfunding (Lam and Law 2016), often supported by 
national governments (in the UK through regulatory and tax support) 
(Owen et al. 2018). Crowdfunding has no financial intermediaries and 
thus low transaction costs, and the projects have a greater degree of 
independence than bank or institution funding (Miller et al. 2018). 
Other examples of innovative mechanisms are community shares for 
local projects, such as renewable energy (Holstenkamp and Kahla 
2016), or Corporate Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) used by 
companies such as Google and Apple to purchase renewable energy 
directly or virtually from developers (Miller et al. 2018). Investing 
companies benefit from avoiding unpredictable price fluctuations as 
well as increasing their environmental credentials. A second example 
is auctioned price floors, or subsidies that offer a guaranteed price 
for future emission reductions, currently being trialled in developing 
countries, by the World Bank Group, known as the Pilot Auction 
Facility for Methane and Climate Change Mitigation (PAF) (Bodnar 
et al. 2018). Price floors can maximise the climate impact per 
public dollar while incentivising private investment in low-carbon 
technologies, and ideally would be implemented in conjunction with 
complementary policies such as carbon pricing.
In order for climate finance to be as effective and efficient as 
possible, cooperation between private, public and third sectors 
(e.g., non-governmental organisations (NGOs), cooperatives, and 
community groups) is more likely to create an enabling environment 
for innovation (Owen et al. 2018). While innovative private sector 
approaches are making significant progress, the existence of a stable 
policy environment that provides certainty and incentives for 
long-term private investment is critical.
7.4.8 
Enabling effective policy instruments – 
policy portfolio coherence
An enabling environment for policy effectiveness includes: (i) the 
development of comprehensive policies, strategies and programmes 
(Section  7.4); (ii) human and financial resources to ensure that 
policies, programmes and legislation are translated into action; 
(iii)  decision-making that draws on evidence generated from 
functional information systems that make it possible to monitor 
trends, track and map actions, and assess impact in a manner that is 
timely and comprehensive (Section 7.5); (iv) governance coordination 
mechanisms and partnerships; and (v) a  long-term perspective in 
terms of response options, monitoring, and maintenance (FAO 2017a) 
(Section 7.6).
714
Chapter 7 
Risk management and decision-making in relation to sustainable development
7
A comprehensive consideration of policy portfolios achieves 
sustainable land and climate management (medium confidence) 
(Mobarak and Rosenzweig 2013; Stavropoulou et al. 2017; Jeffrey 
et al. 2017; Howlett and Rayner 2013; Aalto et al. 2017; Brander and 
Keith 2015; Williams and Abatzoglou 2016; Linnerooth-Bayer and 
Hochrainer-Stigler 2015; FAO 2017b; Bierbaum and Cowie 2018). 
Supporting the study of enabling environments, the study of policy 
mixes has emerged in the last decade in regards to the mix or set of 
instruments that interact together and are aimed at achieving policy 
objectives in a dynamic setting (Reichardt et al. 2015). This includes 
studying the ultimate objectives of a policy mix – such as biodiversity 
(Ring and Schröter-Schlaack 2011)  – the interaction of policy 
instruments within the mix (including climate change mitigation 
and energy (del Río and Cerdá 2017)) (see Trade-offs and synergies, 
Section 7.5.6), and the dynamic nature of the policy mix (Kern and 
Howlett 2009).
Studying policy mixes allows for a consideration of policy coherence 
that is broader than the study of discrete policy instruments in 
rigidly defined sectors, but entails studying policy in relation to the 
links and dependencies among problems and issues (FAO 2017b). 
Consideration of policy coherence is a  new approach, rejecting 
simplistic solutions, but acknowledging inherently complex processes 
involving collective consideration of public and private actors in 
relation to policy analysis (FAO 2017b). A coherent, consistent mix of 
policy instruments can solve complex policy problems (Howlett and 
Rayner 2013) as it involves lateral, integrative, and holistic thinking in 
defining and solving problems (FAO 2017b). Such a consideration of 
policy coherence is required to achieve sustainable development (FAO 
2017b; Bierbaum and Cowie 2018). Consideration of policy coherence 
potentially addresses three sets of challenges: challenges that exist 
with assessing multiple hazards and sectors (Aalto et al. 2017; 
Brander and Keith 2015; Williams and Abatzoglou 2016); challenges 
in mainstreaming adaptation and risk management into ongoing 
development planning and decision-making (Linnerooth-Bayer and 
Hochrainer-Stigler 2015); and challenges in scaling-up community 
and ecosystem-based initiatives in countries overly focused on sectors, 
instead of sustainable use of biodiversity and ES (Reid 2016). There is 
a gap in integrated consideration of adaptation, mitigation, climate 
change policy and development. A study in Indonesia found that, 
while internal policy coherence between mitigation and adaptation is 
increasing, external policy coherence between climate change policy 
and development objectives is still required (Di Gregorio et al. 2017).
There is medium evidence and high agreement that a  suite of 
agricultural business risk programmes (which would include crop 
insurance and income stability programmes) increase farm financial 
performance, reduce risk, and also reinforce incentives to adopt 
stewardship practices (beneficial management practices) improving 
the environment (Jeffrey et al. 2017). Consideration of the portfolio 
of instruments responding to climate change and its associated 
risks, and the interaction of policy instruments, improve agricultural 
producer livelihoods (Hurlbert 2018b). In relation to hazards, or 
climate-related extremes (Section  7.4.3), the policy mix has been 
found to be a key determinant of the adaptive capacity of agricultural 
producers. In relation to drought, the mix of policy instruments 
including crop insurance, SLM practices, bankruptcy and insolvency, 
co-management of community in water and disaster planning, 
and water infrastructure programmes are effective at responding 
to drought (Hurlbert 2018b; Hurlbert and Mussetta 2016; Hurlbert 
and Pittman 2014; Hurlbert and Montana 2015; Hurlbert 2015a; 
Hurlbert and Gupta 2018). Similarly, in relation to flood, the mix of 
policy instruments including flood zone mapping, land-use planning, 
flood zone building restrictions, business and crop insurance, 
disaster assistance payments, preventative instruments, such as 
environmental farm planning (including soil and water management 
(Chapter  6)) and farm infrastructure projects, and recovery from 
debilitating flood losses, ultimately through bankruptcy, are effective 
at responding to flood (Hurlbert 2018a) (see Case study: Flood and 
flood security in Section 7.6.3).
In respect of land conservation and management goals, consideration 
of differing strengths and weakness of instruments is necessary. 
While direct regulation may secure effective minimum standards 
of biodiversity conservation and critical ES provision, economic 
instruments may achieve reduced compliance costs as costs are 
borne by policy addressees (Rogge and Reichardt 2016). In relation 
to GHG emissions and climate mitigation, a comprehensive mix of 
instruments targeted at emissions reductions, learning, and  R&D 
is effective (high confidence) (Fischer and Newell 2008). The policy 
coherence between climate policy and public financeis critical in 
ensuring the efficiency, effectiveness and equity of mitigation policy, 
and ultimately to make stringent mitigation policy more feasible 
(Siegmeier et al. 2018). Recycling carbon tax revenue to support 
clean energy technologies can decrease losses from unilateral carbon 
mitigation targets, with complementary technology polices (Corradini 
et al. 2018).
When evaluating a  new policy instrument, its design in relation 
to achieving an environmental goal or solving a land and climate 
change issue, includes consideration of how the new instrument 
will interact with existing instruments operating at multiple levels 
(international, regional, national, sub-national, and local) (Ring and 
Schröter-Schlaack 2011) (Section 7.4.1).
7.4.9 
Barriers to implementing policy responses
There are barriers to implementing the policy instruments that arise 
in response to the risks from climate-land interactions. Such barriers 
to climate action help determine the degree to which society can 
achieve its sustainable development objectives (Dow et al. 2013; 
Langholtz et al. 2014; Klein et al. 2015). However, some policies can 
also be seen as being designed specifically to overcome barriers, 
while some cases may actually create or strengthen barriers to 
climate action (Foudi and Erdlenbruch 2012; Linnerooth-Bayer and 
Hochrainer-Stigler 2015). The concept of barriers to climate action 
is used here in a sense close to that of ‘soft limits’ to adaptation 
(Klein, et al. 2014). ‘Hard limits’ by contrast are seen as primarily 
biophysical. Predicted changes in the key factors of crop growth and 
productivity – temperature, water, and soil quality – are expected to 
pose limits to adaptation in ways that affect the world population’s 
ability to get enough food in the future (Altieri et al. 2015; Altieri and 
Nicholls 2017).

This section assesses research on barriers specific to policy 
implementation in adaptation and mitigation respectively, then 
addresses the cross-cutting issue of inequality as a barrier to climate 
action, including the particular cases of corruption and elite capture, 
before assessing how policies on climate and land can be used to 
overcome barriers.
7.4.9.1 
Barriers to adaptation
There are human, social, economic, and institutional barriers to 
adaptation to land-climate challenges as described in Table  7.4 
(medium evidence, high agreement). Considerable literature exists 
around changing behaviours through response options targeting 
social and cultural barriers (Rosin 2013; Eakin 2016; Marshall et al. 
2012) (Chapter 6).
Since the publication of the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) 
(IPCC 2014), research is emerging, examining the role of governance, 
institutions and (in particular) policy instruments, in creating or 
overcoming barriers to adaptation to land and climate change in the 
land-use sector (Foudi and Erdlenbruch 2012; Linnerooth-Bayer and 
Hochrainer-Stigler 2015). Evidence shows that understanding the 
local context and targeted approaches are generally most successful 
(Rauken et al. 2014). Understanding the nature of constraints to 
adaptation is critical in determining how barriers may be overcome. 
Formal institutions (rules, laws, policies) and informal institutions 
(social and cultural norms and shared understandings) can be 
barriers and enablers of climate adaptation (Jantarasami et al. 2010).
Governments play a key role in intervening and confronting existing 
barriers by changing legislation, adopting policy instruments, 
providing  additional resources, and building institutions and 
knowledge exchange (Ford and Pearce 2010; Measham et al. 2011; 
Mozumder et al. 2011; Storbjörk 2010). Understanding institutional 
barriers is important in addressing barriers (high confidence). 
Institutional barriers may exist due to the path-dependent nature of 
institutions governing natural resources and public good, bureaucratic 
structures that undermine horizontal and vertical integration 
(Section 7.6.2), and lack of policy coherence (Section 7.4.8).
7.4.9.2 
Barriers to land-based climate mitigation
Barriers to land-based mitigation relate to full understanding of the 
permanence of carbon sequestration in soils or terrestrial biomass, the 
additionality of this storage, its impact on production and production 
shifts to other regions, measurement and monitoring systems and 
costs (Smith et al. 2007). Agricultural producers are more willing to 
expand mitigation measures already employed (including efficient 
and effective management of fertiliser, including manure and slurry) 
and less favourable to those not employed, such as using dietary 
additives, adopting genetically improved animals, or covering slurry 
tanks and lagoons (Feliciano et al. 2014). Barriers identified in land-
based mitigation include physical environmental constraints such as 
lack of information, education, and suitability for size and location of 
farm. For instance, precision agriculture is not viewed as efficient in 
small-scale farming (Feliciano et al. 2014).
Property rights may be a barrier when there is no clear single-
party land ownership to implement and manage changes (Smith 
et al. 2007). In forestry, tenure arrangements may not distribute 
obligations and incentives for carbon sequestration effectively 
between public management agencies and private agents with forest 
licences. Including carbon in tenure and expanding the duration of 
tenure may provide stronger incentive for tenure holders to manage 
carbon as well as timber values (Williamson and Nelson 2017). 
Effective policy will require answers as to the current status of 
agriculture in regard to GHG emissions, the degree that emissions 
are to change, the best pathway to achieve the change, and an ability 
to know when the target level of change is achieved (Smith et al. 
2007). Forest governance may not have the structure to advance 
mitigation and adaptation. Currently top-down traditional modes do 
not have the flexibility or responsiveness to deal with the complex, 
dynamic, spatially diverse, and uncertain features of climate change 
(Timberlake and Schultz 2017; Williamson and Nelson 2017).
In respect of forest mitigation, two main institutional barriers have 
been found to predominate. First, forest management institutions do 
not consider climate change to the degree necessary for enabling 
effective climate response, and do not link adaptation and mitigation. 
Second, institutional barriers exist if institutions are not forward 
looking, do not enable collaborative adaptive management, do not

promote flexible approaches that are reversible as new information 
becomes available, do not promote learning and allow for diversity 
of approaches that can be tailored to different local circumstances 
(Williamson and Nelson 2017).
Land-based climate mitigation through expansions and enhancements 
in agriculture, forestry and bioenergy has great potential but also 
poses great risks; its success will therefore require improved land-
use planning, strong governance frameworks and coherent and 
consistent policies. ‘Progressive developments in governance of 
land and modernisation of agriculture and livestock and effective 
sustainability frameworks can help realise large parts of the technical 
bioenergy potential with low associated GHG emissions’ (Smith et al. 
2014b, p. 97).
7.4.9.3 
Inequality
There is medium evidence and high agreement that one of the 
greatest challenges for land-based adaptation and SLM is posed 
by inequalities that influence vulnerability and coping and adaptive 
capacity – including age, gender, wealth, knowledge, access to 
resources and power (Kunreuther et al. 2014; IPCC 2012; Olsson 
et al. 2014). Gender is the dimension of inequality that has been the 
focus of most research, while research demonstrating differential 
impacts, vulnerability and adaptive capacity based on age, ethnicity 
and indigeneity is less well developed (Olsson et al. 2015a). 
Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 7 sets out both the contribution 
of gender relations to differential vulnerability and available policy 
instruments for greater gender inclusivity.
One response to the vulnerability of poor people and other categories 
differentially affected is effective and reliable social safety nets 
(Jones and Hiller 2017). Social protection coverage is low across 
the world and informal support systems continue to be the key 
means of protection for a majority of the rural poor and vulnerable 
(Stavropoulou et al. 2017) (Section 7.4.2). However, there is a gap in 
knowledge in understanding both positive and negative synergies 
between formal and informal systems of social protection and how 
local support institutions might be used to implement more formal 
forms of social protection (Stavropoulou et al. 2017).
7.4.9.4 
Corruption and elite capture
Inequalities of wealth and power can allow processes of corruption 
and elite capture (where public resources are used for the benefit of 
a few individuals in detriment to the larger populations) which can 
affect both adaptation and mitigation actions, at levels from the local 
to the global that, in turn, risk creating inequitable or unjust outcomes 
(Sovacool 2018) (limited evidence, medium agreement). This includes 
risks of corruption in REDD+ processes (Sheng et al. 2016; Williams 
and Dupuy 2018) and of corruption or elite capture in broader forest 
governance (Sundström 2016; Persha and Andersson 2014), as well 
as elite capture of benefits from planned adaptation at a local level 
(Sovacool 2018).
Peer-reviewed empirical studies that focus on corruption in climate 
finance and interventions, particularly at a local level, are rare, due in 
part to the obvious difficulties of researching illegal and clandestine 
activity (Fadairo et al. 2017). At the country level, historical levels 
of corruption are shown to affect current climate polices and global 
cooperation (Fredriksson and Neumayer 2016). Brown (2010) sees 
three likely inlets of corruption into REDD+: in the setting of forest 
baselines, the reconciliation of project and natural credits, and the 
implementation of control of illegal logging. The transnational and 
north-south dimensions of corruption are highlighted by debates 
on which US legislative instruments (e.g., the Lacey Act, the Foreign 
Corrupt Practices Act) could be used to prosecute the northern 
corporations that are involved in illegal logging (Gordon 2016; 
Waite 2011).
Fadairo et al. (2017) carried out a structured survey of perceptions 
of households in forest-edge communities served by REDD+, as 
well as those of local officials, in south eastern Nigeria. They report 
high rates of agreement that allocation of carbon rights is opaque 
and uncertain, distribution of benefits is untimely, uncertain and 
unpredictable, and the REDD+ decision-making process is vulnerable 
to political interference that benefits powerful individuals. Only 
35% of respondents had an overall perception of transparency in 
REDD+ process as ‘good’. Of eight institutional processes or facilities 
previously identified by the government of Nigeria and international 
agencies as indicators of commitment to transparent and equitable 
governance, only three were evident in the local REDD+ office as 
‘very functional’ or ‘fairly functional’. 
At the local level, the risks of corruption and elite capture of the 
benefits of climate action are high in decentralised regimes (Persha 
and Andersson 2014). Rahman (2018) discusses elicitation of bribes 
(by local-level government staff) and extortion (by criminals) to 
allow poor rural people to gather forest products. The results are a 
general undermining of households’ adaptive capacity and perverse 
incentives to over-exploit forests once bribes have been paid, 
leading to over-extraction and biodiversity loss. Where there are 
pre-existing inequalities and conflict, participation processes need 
careful management and firm external agency to achieve genuine 
transformation and avoid elite capture (Rigon 2014). An illustration 
of the range of types of elite capture is given by Sovacool (2018) 
for adaptation initiatives including coastal afforestation, combining 
document review and key informant interviews in Bangladesh, 
with an analytical approach from political ecology. Four processes 
are discussed: enclosure, including land grabbing and preventing 
the poor establishing new land rights; exclusion of the poor from 
decision-making over adaptation; encroachment on the resources 
of the poor by new adaptation infrastructure; and entrenchment of 
community disempowerment through patronage. The article notes 
that observing these processes does not imply they are always 
present, nor that adaptation efforts should be abandoned.

7.4.9.5 
Overcoming barriers 
Policy instruments that strengthen agricultural producer assets or 
capital reduce vulnerability and overcome barriers to adaptation 
(Hurlbert 2018b, 2015b). Additional factors like formal education 
and knowledge of traditional farming systems, secure tenure rights, 
access to electricity and social institutions in rice-farming areas 
of Bangladesh have played a positive role in reducing adaptation 
barriers (Alam 2015). A review of more than 168 publications over 
15 years about adaptation of water resources for irrigation in Europe 
found the highest potential for action is in improving adaptive 
capacity and responding to changes in water demands, in conjunction 
with alterations in current water policy, farm extension training, and 
viable financial instruments (Iglesias and Garrote 2015). Research 
on the Great Barrier Reef, the Olifants River in Southern Africa, 
and fisheries in Europe, North America, and the Antarctic Ocean, 
suggests that the leading factor in harnessing the adaptive capacity 
of ecosystems is to reduce human stressors by enabling actors to 
collaborate across diverse interests, institutional settings, and sectors 
(Biggs et al. 2017; Schultz et al. 2015; Johnson and Becker 2015). 
Fostering equity and participation are correlated with the efficacy 
of local adaptation to secure food and livelihood security (Laube 
et al. 2012). In this chapter, we examine the literature surrounding 
appropriate policy instruments, decision-making, and governance 
practices to overcome limits and barriers to adaptation.
Incremental adaptation consists of actions where the central aim 
is to maintain the essence and integrity of a system or process at 
a given site, whereas transformational adaptation changes the 
fundamental attributes of a system in response to climate and its 
effects; the former is characterised as doing different things and the 
latter, doing things differently (Noble et al. 2014). Transformational 
adaptation is necessary in situations where there are hard limits to 
adaptation or it is desirable to address deficiencies in sustainability, 
adaptation, inclusive development and social equity (Kates et al. 
2012; Mapfumo et al. 2016). In other situations, incremental changes 
may be sufficient (Hadarits et al. 2017).

and sustainable development

Gender is a key axis of social inequality that intersects with other systems of power and marginalisation – including race, culture, 
class/socio-economic status, location, sexuality, and age – to cause unequal experiences of climate change vulnerability and adaptive 
capacity. However, ‘policy frameworks and strong institutions that align development, equity objectives, and climate have the potential 
to deliver “triple-wins”’ (Roy et al. 2018), including enhanced gender equality. Gender in relation to this report is introduced in Chapter 
1, referred to as a leverage point in women’s participation in decisions relating to land desertification (Section 3.6.3), land degradation 
(Section 4.1.6), food security (Section 5.2.5.1), and enabling land and climate response options (Section 6.1.2.2).
Focusing on ‘gender’ as a relational and contextual construct can help avoid homogenising women as a uniformly and consistently 
vulnerable category (Arora-Jonsson 2011; Mersha and Van Laerhoven 2016; Ravera et al. 2016). There is high agreement that using 
a framework of intersectionality to integrate gender into climate change research helps to recognise overlapping and interconnected 
systems of power (Djoudi et al. 2016; Fletcher 2018; Kaijser and Kronsell 2014; Moosa and Tuana 2014; Thompson-Hall et al. 2016), 
which create particular inequitable experiences of climate change vulnerability and adaptation. Through this framework, both 
commonalities and differences may be found between the experiences of rural and urban women, or between women in high-income 
and low-income countries, for example. 
In rural areas, women generally experience greater vulnerability than men, albeit through different pathways (Djoudi et al., 2016; Goh, 
2012; Jost et al., 2016; Kakota, Nyariki, Mkwambisi, & Kogi-Makau, 2011). In masculinised agricultural settings of Australia and 
Canada, for example, climate adaptation can increase women’s work on- and off-farm, but without increasing recognition for 
women’s undervalued contributions (Alston et al. 2018a; Fletcher and Knuttila 2016). A study in rural Ethiopia found that male-headed 
households had access to a wider set of adaptation measures than female-headed households (Mersha and Van Laerhoven 2016). 
Due to engrained patriarchal social structures and gendered ideologies, women may face multiple barriers to participation and 
decision-making in land-based adaptation and mitigation actions in response to climate change (high confidence) (Alkire et al. 2013a; 
Quisumbing et al. 2014). These barriers include: (i) disproportionate responsibility for unpaid domestic work, including care-giving 
activities (Beuchelt and Badstue 2013) and provision of water and firewood (UNEP, 2016); (ii) risk of violence in both public and private 
spheres, which restricts women’s mobility for capacity-building activities and productive work outside the home (Day et al., 2005; 
Jost et al., 2016; UNEP, 2016); (iii) less access to credit and financing (Jost et al. 2016); (iv) lack of organisational social capital, which 
may help in accessing credit (Carroll et al. 2012); (v) lack of ownership of productive assets and resources (Kristjanson et al., 2014;

Meinzen-Dick et al., 2010), including land. Constraints to land access include not only state policies, but also customary laws (Bayisenge 
2018) based on customary norms and religion that determine women’s rights (Namubiru-Mwaura 2014a).
Differential vulnerability to climate change is related to inequality in rights-based resource access, established through formal 
and informal tenure systems. In only 37% of 161 developing and developed countries do men and women have equal rights to use 
and control land, and in 59% customary, traditional, and religious practices discriminate against women (OECD 2014), even if the law 
formally grants equal rights. Women play a significant role in agriculture, food security and rural economies globally, forming 43% of 
the agricultural labour force in developing countries (FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, & WHO, 2018, p. 102), ranging from 25% in Latin America 
(FAO, 2017, p. 89) to nearly 50% in Eastern Asia and Central and South Europe (FAO, 2017, p. 88) and 47% in Sub-Saharan Africa (FAO, 
2017, pp. 88). Further, the share of women in agricultural employment has been growing in all developing regions except East Asia 
and Southeast Asia (FAO, 2017, p. 88). At the same time, women constitute less than 5% of landholders (with legal rights and/or use-
rights (Doss et al. 2018a) in North Africa and West Asia, about 15% in Sub-Saharan Africa, 12% in Southern and Southeastern Asia, 
18% in Latin America and Caribbean (FAO 2011b, p. 25), 10% in Bangladesh, 4% in Nigeria (FAO 2015c). Patriarchal structures and 
gender roles can also affect women’s control over land in developed countries (Carter 2017; Alston et al. 2018b). Thus, longstanding 
gender inequality in land rights, security of tenure, and decision-making may constrict women’s adaptation options (Smucker and 
Wangui 2016).
Adaptation options related to land and climate (see Chapter 6) may produce environment and development trade-offs as well as 
social conflicts (Hunsberger et al. 2017) and changes with gendered implications. Women’s strong presence in agriculture provides an 
opportunity to bring gender dimensions into climate change adaptation, particularly regarding food security (Glemarec 2017; Jost et 
al. 2016; Doss et al. 2018b). Some studies point to a potentially emancipatory role played by adaptation interventions and strategies, 
albeit with some limitations depending on context. For example, in developing contexts, male out-migration may cause women in 
socially disadvantaged groups to engage in new livelihood activities, thus challenging gendered roles (Djoudi and Brockhaus 2011; 
Alston 2006). Collective action and agency of women in farming households, including widows, have led to prevention of crop 
failure, reduced workload, increased nutritional intake, increased sustainable water management, diversified and increased income 
and improved strategic planning (Andersson and Gabrielsson 2012). Women’s waged labour can help stabilise income from more 
land- and climate-dependent activities such as agriculture, hunting, or fishing (Alston et al., 2018; Ford and Goldhar, 2012). However, 
in developed contexts like Australia, women’s participation in off-farm employment may exacerbate existing masculinisation of 
agriculture (Clarke and Alston 2017).
Literature suggests that land-based mitigation measures may lead to land alienation, either through market or appropriation 
(acquisition) by the government, may interfere with traditional livelihoods in rural areas, and lead to decline in women’s livelihoods 
(Hunsberger et al. 2017). If land alienation is not prevented, existing inequities and social exclusions may be reinforced (medium 
agreement) (Mustalahti and Rakotonarivo 2014; Chomba et al. 2016; Poudyal et al. 2016). These activities also can lead to land grabs, 
which remain a focal point for research and local activism (Borras Jr. et al. 2011; White et al. 2012; Lahiff 2015). Cumulative effects 
of land-based mitigation measures may put families at risk of poverty. In certain contexts, they lead to increased conflicts. In conflict 
situations, women are at risk of personal violence, including sexual violence (UNEP, 2016). 
Policy instruments for gender-inclusive approaches to climate change, land and sustainable development
Integrating, or mainstreaming, gender into land and climate change policy requires assessments of gender-differentiated needs 
and priorities, selection of appropriate policy instruments to address barriers to women’s sustainable land management (SLM), 
and selection of gender indicators for monitoring and assessment of policy (medium confidence) (Huyer et al. 2015a; Alston 2014). 
Important sex-disaggregated data can be obtained at multiple levels, including the intra-household level (Seager 2014; Doss et al. 
2018b), village- and plot-level information (Theriault et al. 2017a), and through national surveys (Agarwal 2018a; Doss et al. 2015a). 
Gender-disaggregated data provides a basis for selecting, monitoring and reassessing policy instruments that account for gender-
differentiated land and climate change needs (medium confidence) (Rao 2017a; Arora-Jonsson 2014; Theriault et al. 2017b; Doss et al. 
2018b). While macro-level data can reveal ongoing gender trends in SLM, contextual data are important for revealing intersectional 
aspects, such as the difference made by family relations, socio-economic status, or cultural practices about land use and control (Rao 
2017a; Arora-Jonsson 2014; Theriault et al. 2017b), as well as on security of land holding (Doss et al. 2018b). Indices such as the 
Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index (Alkire et al. 2013b) may provide useful guidelines for quantitative data collection on 
gender and SLM, while qualitative studies can reveal the nature of agency and whether policies are likely to be accepted, or not, in 
the context of local structures, meanings, and social relations (Rao 2017b).

Chapter 7

7.5 
Decision-making for climate change 
and land
The risks posed by climate change generate considerable uncertainty 
and complexity for decision-makers responsible for land-use decisions 
(robust evidence, high agreement). Decision-makers balance climate 
ambitions, encapsulated in the NDCs, with other SDGs, which will 
differ considerably across different regions, sociocultural conditions 
and economic levels (Griggs et al. 2014). The interactions across SDGs 
also factor into decision-making processes (Nilsson et al. 2016b). The 
challenge is particularly acute in least developed countries where 
a large share of the population is vulnerable to climate change. 
Matching the structure of decision-making processes to local needs 
while connecting to national strategies and international regimes 
is challenging (Nilsson and Persson 2012). This section explores 
methods of decision-making to address the risks and inter-linkages 
outlined in the above sections. As a result, this section outlines 
policy inter-linkages with SDGs and NDCs, trade-offs and synergies 
in specific measures, possible challenges as well as opportunities 
going forward.
Even in cases where uncertainty exists, there is medium evidence and 
high agreement in the literature that it need not present a barrier to 
taking action, and there are growing methodological developments 
and empirical applications to support decision-making. Progress has 
been made in identifying key sources of uncertainty and addressing 
them (Farber 2015; Lawrence et al. 2018; Bloemen et al. 2018). 
Many of these approaches involve principles of robustness, diversity, 
flexibility, learning, or choice editing (Section 7.5.2).
Since the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (Foundations for Decision 
Making) chapter on Contexts for Decision-making (Jones et al. 2014) 
considerable advances have been made in decision-making under 
uncertainty, both conceptually and in economics (Section  7.5.2), 
and in the social/qualitative research areas (Sections 7.5.3 and 
7.5.4). In the land sector, the degree of uncertainty varies and is 
particularly challenging for climate change adaptation decisions 
(Hallegatte 2009; Wilby and Dessai 2010). Some types of agricultural 
production decisions can be made in short timeframes as changes 
are observed, and will provide benefits in the current time period 
(Dittrich et al. 2017).
Cross-Chapter Box 11 (continued)
Women’s economic empowerment, decision-making power and voice is a necessity in SLM decisions (Mello and Schmink 2017a; 
Theriault et al. 2017b). Policies that address barriers include: gender considerations as qualifying criteria for funding programmes or 
access to financing for initiatives; government transfers to women under the auspices of anti-poverty programmes; spending on health 
and education; and subsidised credit for women (medium confidence) (Jagger and Pender 2006; Van Koppen et al. 2013a; Theriault et 
al. 2017b; Agarwal 2018b). Training and extension for women to facilitate sustainable practices is also important (Mello and Schmink 
2017b; Theriault et al. 2017b). Such training could be built into existing programmes or structures, such as collective microenterprise 
(Mello and Schmink 2017b). Huyer et al. (2015) suggest that information provision (e.g., information about SLM) could be effectively 
dispersed through women’s community-based organisations, although not in such a way that it overwhelms these organisations or 
supersedes their existing missions. SLM programmes could also benefit from intentionally engaging men in gender-equality training 
and efforts (Fletcher 2017), thus recognising the relationality of gender. Recognition of the household level, including men’s roles and 
power relations, can help avoid the decontextualised and individualistic portrayal of women as purely instrumental actors (Rao 2017b).
Technology, policy, and programmes that exacerbate women’s workloads or reinforce gender stereotypes (MacGregor 2010; Huyer et 
al. 2015b), or which fail to recognise and value the contributions women already make (Doss et al. 2018b), may further marginalise 
women. Accordingly, some studies have described technological and labour interventions that can enhance sustainability while also 
decreasing women’s workloads; for example, Vent et al. (2017) described the system of rice intensification as one such intervention. 
REDD+ initiatives need to be aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to achieve complementary synergies with 
gender dimensions. 
Secure land title and/or land access and control for women increases SLM by increasing women’s conservation efforts, 
increasing their productive and environmentally beneficial agricultural investments, such as willingness to engage in tree planting 
and sustainable soil management (high confidence) as well as improving cash incomes (Higgins et al. 2018; Agarwal 2010; Namubiru-
Mwaura 2014b; Doss et al. 2015b; Van Koppen et al. 2013b; Theriault et al. 2017b; Jagger and Pender 2006). According FAO (2011b, p. 5), 
if women had the same access to productive resources as men, the number of hungry people in the world could be reduced by 12–17%. 
Policies promoting secure land title include legal reforms at multiple levels, including national laws on land ownership, legal education, 
and legal aid for women on land ownership and access (Argawal 2018). Policies to increase women’s access to land could occur through 
three main avenues of land acquisition: inheritance/family (Theriault et al. 2017b), state policy, and the market (Agarwal 2018). Rao 
(2017) recommends framing land rights as entitlements rather than as instrumental means to sustainability. This reframing may address 
persistent, pervasive gender inequalities (FAO 2015d).

7.5.1 
Formal and informal decision-making
Informal decision-making facilitated by open platforms can solve 
problems in land and resource management by allowing evolution 
and adaptation, and incorporation of local knowledge (medium 
confidence) (Malogdos and Yujuico 2015a; Vandersypen et al. 
2007). Formal centres of decision-making are those that follow fixed 
procedures (written down in statutes or moulded in an organisation 
backed by the legal system) and structures (Onibon et al. 1999). 
Informal centres of decision-making are those following customary 
norms and habits based on conventions (Onibon et al. 1999) where 
problems are ill-structured and complex (Waddock 2013).
7.5.1.1 
Formal Decision Making 
Formal decision-making processes can occur at all levels, including 
the global, regional, national and sub-national levels (Section 7.4.1). 
Formal decision-making support tools can be used, for example, by 
farmers, to answer ‘what-if’ questions as to how to respond to the 
effects of changing climate on soils, rainfall and other conditions 
(Wenkel et al. 2013). 
Optimal formal decision-making is based on realistic behaviour 
of actors, important in land–climate systems, assessed through 
participatory 
approaches, 
stakeholder 
consultations 
and 
by 
incorporating results from empirical analyses. Mathematical 
simulations and games (Lamarque et al. 2013), behavioural models in 
land-based sectors (Brown et al. 2017), agent-based models and micro-
simulations are examples useful to decision-makers (Bishop et al. 
2013). These decision-making tools are expanded on in Section 7.5.2.
There are different ways to incorporate local knowledge, informal 
institutions and other contextual characteristics that capture non-
deterministic elements, as well as social and cultural beliefs and 
systems more generally, into formal decision-making (medium 
evidence, medium agreement) (Section  7.6.4). Classic scientific 
methodologies now include participatory and interdisciplinary 
methods and approaches (Jones et al. 2014). Consequently, this 
broader range of approaches may capture informal and indigenous 
knowledge, improving the participation of indigenous peoples in 
decision-making processes, and thereby promote their rights to 
self-determination (Malogdos and Yujuico 2015b) (Cross-Chapter 
Box 13 in Chapter 7). 
7.5.1.2 
Informal decision-making 
Informal institutions have contributed to sustainable resources 
management (common pool resources) through creating a suitable 
environment for decision-making. The role of informal institutions 
indecision-making can be particularly relevant for land-use decisions 
and practices in rural areas in the global south and north (Huisheng 
2015). Understanding informal institutions is crucial for adapting 
to climate change, advancing technological adaptation measures, 
achieving comprehensive disaster management and advancing 
collective decision-making (Karim and Thiel 2017). Informal 
institutions have been found to be a crucial entry point in dealing 
with vulnerability of communities and exclusionary tendencies 
impacting on marginalised and vulnerable people (Mubaya and 
Mafongoya 2017).
Many studies underline the role of local/informal traditional 
institutions in the management of natural resources in different 
parts of the world (Yami et al. 2009; Zoogah et al. 2015; Bratton 
2007; Mowo et al. 2013; Grzymala-Busse 2010). Traditional systems 
include: traditional silvopastoral management (Iran), management 
of rangeland resources (South Africa), natural resource management 
(Ethiopia, 
Tanzania, 
Bangladesh) 
communal 
grazing 
land 
management (Ethiopia) and management of conflict over natural 
resources (Siddig et al. 2007; Yami et al. 2011; Valipour et al. 2014; 
Bennett 2013; Mowo et al. 2013).
Formal–informal institutional interaction could take different 
shapes such as: complementary, accommodating, competing, and 
substitutive. There are many examples when formal institutions might 
obstruct, change, and hinder informal institutions (Rahman et al. 
2014; Helmke and Levitsky 2004; Bennett 2013; Osei-Tutu et al. 2014). 
Similarly, informal institutions can replace, undermine, and reinforce 
formal institutions (Grzymala-Busse 2010). In the absence of formal 
institutions, informal institutions gain importance, requiring focus 
in relation to natural resources management and rights protection 
(Estrin and Prevezer 2011; Helmke and Levitsky 2004; Kangalawe et 
al. 2014; Sauerwald and Peng 2013; Zoogah et al. 2015).
Community forestry comprises 22% of forests in tropical countries in 
contrast to large-scale industrial forestry (Hajjar et al. 2013) and is 
managed with informal institutions, ensuring a sustainable flow of 
forest products and income, utilising traditional ecological knowledge 
to determine access to resources (Singh et al. 2018). Policies that 
create an open platform for local debates and allow actors their own 
active formulation of rules strengthen informal institutions. Case 
studies in Zambia, Mali, Indonesia and Bolivia confirm that enabling 
factors for advancing the local ownership of resources and crafting 
durability of informal rules require recognition in laws, regulations 
and policies of the state (Haller et al. 2016).
7.5.2 
Decision-making, timing, risk, and uncertainty 
This section assesses decision-making literature, concluding that 
advances in methods have been made in the face of conceptual 
risk literature and, together with a synthesis of empirical evidence, 
near-term decisions have significant impact on costs.
7.5.2.1 
Problem structuring
Structured decision-making occurs when there is scientific knowledge 
about cause and effect, little uncertainty, and agreement exists on 
values and norms relating to an issue (Hurlbert and Gupta 2016). 
This decision space is situated within the ‘known’ space where cause 
and effect is understood and predictable (although uncertainty is not 
quite zero) (French 2015). Figure 7.5 displays the structured problem 
area in the bottom left-hand corner corresponding with the ‘known’ 
decision-making space. Decision-making surrounding quantified 
risk assessment and risk management (Section  7.4.3.1) occurs 
721
Risk management and decision-making in relation to sustainable development 
Chapter 7

within this decision-making space. Examples in the land and climate 
area include cost-benefit analysis surrounding implementation of 
irrigation projects (Batie 2008) or adopting soil erosion practices by 
agricultural producers based on anticipated profit (Hurlbert 2018b). 
Comprehensive risk management also occupies this decision space 
(Papathoma-Köhle et al. 2016), encompassing risk assessment, 
reduction, transfer, retention, emergency preparedness and response, 
and disaster recovery by combining quantified proactive and reactive 
approaches (Fra.Paleo 2015) (Section 7.4.3). 
A moderately structured decision space is characterised as one 
where there is either some disagreement on norms, principles, ends 
and goals in defining a future state, or there is some uncertainty 
surrounding land and climate including land use, observations of 
land-use changes, early warning and decision support systems, 
model structures, parameterisations, inputs, or from unknown 
futures informing integrated assessment models and scenarios 
(see Chapter 1, Section 1.2.2 and Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1). 
Environmental decision-making often takes place in this space where 
there is limited information and ability to process it, and individual 
stakeholders make different decisions on the best future course of 
action (medium confidence) (Waas et al. 2014; Hurlbert and Gupta 
2016, 2015; Hurlbert 2018b). Figure 7.5 displays the moderately 
structured problem space characterised by disagreement surrounding 
norms on the top left-hand side. This corresponds with the complex 
decision-making space, the realm of social sciences and qualitative 
knowledge, where cause and effect is difficult to relate with any 
confidence (French 2013). 
The moderately structured decision space characterised by 
uncertainty surrounding land and climate on the bottom right-hand 
side of Figure  7.5 corresponds to the knowable decision-making 
space, where the realm of scientific inquiry investigates cause and 
effects. Here there is sufficient understanding to build models, but 
not enough understanding to define all parameters (French 2015).
The top right-hand corner of Figure 7.5 corresponds to the 
‘unstructured’ problem or chaotic space where patterns and 
relationships are difficult to discern and unknown unknowns reside 
(French 2013). It is in the complex but knowable space, the structured 
and moderately structured space, that decision-making under 
uncertainty occurs.
7.5.2.2 
Decision-making tools
Decisions can be made despite uncertainty (medium confidence), 
and a wide range of possible approaches are emerging to support 
decision-making under uncertainty (Jones et al. 2014), applied both 
to adaptation and mitigation decisions.
Traditional approaches for economic appraisal, including cost-
benefit analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis referred to in 
Section 7.5.2.1 do not handle or address uncertainty well (Hallegatte 
2009; Farber 2015) and favour decisions with short-term benefits 
(see Cross-Chapter Box 10 in this chapter). Alternative economic 
decision-making approaches aim to better incorporate uncertainty 
while delivering adaptation goals, by selecting projects that meet 
their purpose across a variety of plausible futures (Hallegatte et al. 
2012)  – so-called ‘robust’ decision-making approaches. These are 
designed to be less sensitive to uncertainty about the future (Lempert 
and Schlesinger 2000). 
Much of the research for adaptation to climate change has focused 
around three main economic approaches: real options analysis, 
portfolio analysis, and robust decision-making. Real options analysis 
develops flexible strategies that can be adjusted when additional 
climate information becomes available. It is most appropriate for 
large irreversible investment decisions. Applications to climate 
adaptation are growing quickly, with most studies addressing 
flood risk and sea-level rise (Gersonius et al. 2013; Woodward 
et al. 2014; Dan 2016), but studies in land-use decisions are also 
emerging, including identifying the optimal time to switch land use 
in a changing climate (Sanderson et al. 2016) and water storage 
(Sturm et al. 2017; Kim et al. 2017). Portfolio analysis aims to reduce 
risk by diversification, by planting multiple species rather than only 
one, for example, in forestry (Knoke et al. 2017) or crops (Ben-Ari 
and Makowski 2016), or in multiple locations. There may be a trade-
off between robustness to variability and optimality (Yousefpour 
and Hanewinkel 2016; Ben-Ari and Makowski 2016); but this 
type of analysis can help identify and quantify trade-offs. Robust 
decision-making identifies how different strategies perform under 
many climate outcomes, also potentially trading off optimality for 
resilience (Lempert 2013).
Multi-criteria decision-making continues to be an important 
tool in the land-use sector, with the capacity to simultaneously 
consider multiple goals across different domains (e.g., economic, 
environmental, social) (Bausch et al. 2014; Alrø et al. 2016), and 
so is useful as a mitigation as well as an adaptation tool. Lifecycle 
assessment can also be used to evaluate emissions across a system – 
for example, in livestock production (McClelland et al. 2018) – and 
to identify areas to prioritise for reductions. Bottom-up marginal 
abatement cost curves calculate the most cost effective cumulative 
potential for mitigation across different options (Eory et al. 2018).
In the climate adaptation literature, these tools may be used 
in adaptive management (Section  7.5.4), using a monitoring, 
research, evaluation and learning process (cycle) to improve future 
management strategies (Tompkins and Adger 2004). More recently 
these techniques have been advanced with iterative risk management 
(IPCC 2014a) (Sections 7.4.1 and 7.4.7), adaptation pathways 
(Downing 2012), and dynamic adaptation pathways (Haasnoot et 
al. 2013) (Section 7.6.3). Decision-making tools can be selected and 
adapted to fit the specific land and climate problem and decision-
making space. For instance, dynamic adaptation pathways processes 
(Haasnoot et al. 2013; Wise et al. 2014) identify and sequence 
potential actions based on alternative potential futures and are 
situated within the complex, unstructured space (see Figure  7.5). 
Decisions are made based on trigger points, linked to indicators and 
scenarios, or changing performance over time (Kwakkel et al. 2016). 
A key characteristic of these pathways is that, rather than making 
irreversible decisions now, decisions evolve over time, accounting 
for learning (Section 7.6.4), knowledge, and values. In New Zealand, 
combining dynamic adaptive pathways and a form of real options 
analysis with multiple-criteria decision analysis has enabled risk that 
changes over time to be included in the assessment of adaptation 
722
Chapter 7 
Risk management and decision-making in relation to sustainable development
7
options through a participatory learning process (Lawrence 
et al. 2019).
Scenario analysis is also situated within the complex, unstructured 
space (although, unlike adaptation pathways, it does not allow 
for changes in pathway over time) and is important for identifying 
technology and policy instruments to ensure spatial-temporal 
coherence of land-use allocation simulations with scenario storylines 
(Brown and Castellazzi 2014) and identifying technology and policy 
instruments for mitigation of land degradation (Fleskens et al. 2014). 
While economics is usually based on the idea of a self-interested, 
rational agent, more recently insights from psychology are being 
used to understand and explain human behaviour in the field of 
behavioural economics (Shogren and Taylor 2008; Kesternich et al. 
2017), illustrating how a range of cognitive factors and biases can 
affect choices (Valatin et al. 2016). These insights can be critical 
in supporting decision-making that will lead to more desirable 
outcomes relating to land and climate change. One example of this 
is ‘policy nudges’ (Thaler and Sunstein 2008) which can ‘shift choices 
in socially desirable directions’ (Valatin et al. 2016). Tools can include 
framing tools, binding pre-commitments, default settings, channel 
factors, or broad choice bracketing (Wilson et al. 2016). Although 
relatively few empirical examples exist in the land sector, there is 
evidence that nudges could be applied successfully, for example, 
in woodland creation (Valatin et al. 2016) and agri-environmental 
schemes (Kuhfuss et al. 2016) (medium certainty, low evidence). 
Consumers can be ‘nudged’ to consume less meat (Rozin et al. 2011) 
or to waste less food (Kallbekken and Sælen 2013). 
Programmes supporting and facilitating desired practices can have 
success at changing behaviour, particularly if they are co-designed 
by the end-users (farmers, foresters, land users) (medium evidence, 
high agreement). Programmes that focus on demonstration or trials 
of different adaptation and mitigation measures, and facilitate 
interaction between farmers and industry specialists are perceived as 
being successful (Wreford et al. 2017; Hurlbert 2015b) but systematic 
evaluations of their success at changing behaviour are limited (Knook 
et al. 2018). 
Different approaches to decision-making are appropriate in different 
contexts. Dittrich et al. (2017) provide a guide to the appropriate 
application in different contexts for adaptation in the livestock 
sector in developed countries. While considerable advances have 
been made in theoretical approaches, a number of challenges arise 
when applying these in practice, and partly relate to the necessity 
of assigning probabilities to climate projects, and the complexity of 
the approaches being a prohibitive factor beyond academic exercises. 
Formalised expert judgement can improve how uncertainty is 
characterised (Kunreuther et al. 2014) and these methods have been 
improved utilising Bayesian belief networks to synthesise expert 
judgements and include fault trees and reliability block diagrams to 
overcome standard reliability techniques (Sigurdsson et al. 2001) as 
well as mechanisms incorporating transparency (Ashcroft et al. 2016).

It may also be beneficial to combine decision-making approaches 
with the precautionary principle, or the idea that lack of scientific 
certainty is not to postpone action when faced with serious threats 
or irreversible damage to the environment (Farber 2015). The 
precautionary principle requires cost-effective measures to address 
serious but uncertain risks (Farber 2015). It supports a rights-based 
policy instrument choice as consideration is whether actions or 
inactions harm others moving beyond traditional risk-management 
policy considerations that surround net benefits (Etkin et al. 2012). 
Farber, (2015) concludes that the principle has been successfully 
applied in relation to endangered species and situations where 
climate change is a serious enough problem to justify some response. 
There is medium confidence that combining the precautionary 
principle with integrated assessment models, risk management, and 
cost-benefit analysis in an integrated, holistic manner, would be 
a good combination of decision-making tools supporting sustainable 
development (Farber 2015; Etkin et al. 2012).
7.5.2.3 
Cost and timing of action
The Cross-Chapter Box 10 on Economic dimensions of climate 
change and land deals with the costs and timing of action. In terms 
of policies, not only is timing important, but the type of intervention 
itself can influence returns (high evidence, high agreement). Policy 
packages that make people more resilient – expanding financial 
inclusion, disaster risk and health insurance, social protection and 
adaptive safety nets, contingent finance and reserve funds, and 
universal access to early warning systems (Sections 7.4.1 and 7.6.3) – 
could save 100 billion USD a year, if implemented globally (Hallegatte 
et al. 2017). In Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia, every 1 USD spent on 
safety-net/resilience programming results in net benefits of between 
2.3 and 3.3  USD (Venton 2018). Investing in resilience-building 
activities, which increase household income by 365 to 450 USD per 
year in these countries, is more cost effective than providing ongoing 
humanitarian assistance. 
There is a need to further examine returns on investment for land-
based adaptation measures, both in the short and long term. Other 
outstanding questions include identifying specific triggers for early 
response. Food insecurity, for example, can occur due to a mixture of 
market and environmental factors (changes in food prices, animal or 
crop prices, rainfall patterns) (Venton 2018). The efficacy of different 
triggers, intervention times and modes of funding are currently being 
evaluated (see, for example, forecast-based finance study; Alverson 
and Zommers 2018). To reduce losses and maximise returns on 
investment, this information can be used to develop: 1) coordinated, 
agreed plans for action; 2) a clear, evidence-based decision-making 
process, and; 3) financing models to ensure that the plans for early 
action can be implemented (Clarke and Dercon 2016a).
7.5.3 
Best practices of decision-making toward 
sustainable land management (SLM)
Sustainable land management (SLM) is a strategy and also an 
outcome (Waas et al. 2014) and decision-making practices are 
fundamental in achieving it as an outcome (medium evidence, 
medium agreement). SLM decision-making is improved (medium 
evidence and high agreement) with ecological service mapping with 
three characteristics: robustness (robust modelling, measurement, 
and stakeholder-based methods for quantification of ES supply, 
demand and/or flow, as well as measures of uncertainty and 
heterogeneity across spatial and temporal scales and resolution); 
transparency (to contribute to clear information-sharing and the 
creation of linkages with decision support processes); and relevancy 
to stakeholders (people-centric in which stakeholders are engaged 
at different stages) (Willemen et al. 2015; Ashcroft et al. 2016). 
Practices that advance SLM include remediation practices, as well as 
critical interventions that are reshaping norms and standards, joint 
implementation, experimentation, and integration of rural actors’ 
agency in analysis and approaches in decision-making (Hou and 
Al-Tabbaa 2014). Best practices are identified in the literature after 
their implementation demonstrates effectiveness at improving water 
quality, the environment, or reducing pollution (Rudolph et al. 2015; 
Lam et al. 2011).
There is medium evidence and medium agreement about what factors 
consistently determine the adoption of agricultural best management 
practices (Herendeen and Glazier 2009) and these positively 
correlate to education levels, income, farm size, capital, diversity, 
access to information, and social networks. Attending workshops 
for information and trust in crop consultants are also important 
factors in adoption of best management practices (Ulrich-Schad et al. 
2017; Baumgart-Getz et al. 2012). More research is needed on the 
sustained adoption of these factors over time (Prokopy et al. 2008).
There is medium evidence and high agreement that SLM practices and 
incentives require mainstreaming into relevant policy; appropriate 
market-based approaches, including payment for ES and public-
private partnerships, need better integration into payment schemes 
(Tengberg et al. 2016). There is medium evidence and high agreement 
that many of the best SLM decisions are made with the participation 
of stakeholders and social learning (Section  7.6.4) (Stringer and 
Dougill 2013). As stakeholders may not be in agreement, either 
practices of mediating agreement, or modelling that depicts and 
mediates the effects of stakeholder perceptions in decision-making 
may be applicable (Hou 2016; Wiggering and Steinhardt 2015).
7.5.4 
Adaptive management
Adaptive management is an evolving approach to natural resource 
management founded on decision-making approaches in other 
fields (such as business, experimental science, and industrial 
ecology) (Allen et al. 2011; Williams 2011) and decision-making that 
overcomes management paralysis and mediates multiple stakeholder 
interests through use of simple steps. Adaptive governance considers 
a broader socio-ecological system that includes the social context 
that facilitates adaptive management (Chaffin et al. 2014). Adaptive 
management steps include evaluating a problem and integrating 
planning, analysis and management into a transparent process to 
build a road map focused on achieving fundamental objectives. 
Requirements of success are clearly articulated objectives, the 
explicit acknowledgment of uncertainty, and a transparent response 
724
Chapter 7 
Risk management and decision-making in relation to sustainable development
7
to all stakeholder interests in the decision-making process (Allen 
et al. 2011). Adaptive management builds on this foundation by 
incorporating a formal iterative process, acknowledging uncertainty 
and achieving management objectives through a structured feedback 
process that includes stakeholder participation (Foxon et al. 2009) 
(Section 7.6.4). In the adaptive management process, the problem 
and desired goals are identifi ed, evaluation criteria formulated, the 
system boundaries and context are ascertained, trade-offs evaluated, 
decisions are made regarding responses and policy instruments, 
which are implemented, and monitored, evaluated and adjusted 
(Allen et al. 2011). The implementation of policy strategies and 
monitoring of results occurs in a continuous management cycle of 
monitoring, assessment and revision (Hurlbert 2015b; Newig et al. 
2010; Pahl-Wostl et al. 2007), as illustrated in Figure 7.6.
A key focus on adaptive management is the identifi cation and 
reduction of uncertainty (as described in Chapter 1, Section 1.2.2 and 
Cross-Chapter Box 1 on Scenarios) and partial controllability, whereby 
policies used to implement an action are only indirectly responsible 
(for example, setting a harvest rate) (Williams 2011). There is medium 
evidence and high agreement that adaptive management is an ideal 
method to resolve uncertainty when uncertainty and controllability 
(resources will respond to management) are both high (Allen et al. 
2011). Where uncertainty is high, but controllability is low, developing 
and analysing scenarios may be more appropriate (Allen et al. 2011). 
Anticipatory governance has developed combining scenarios and 
forecasting in order to creatively design strategy to address ‘complex, 
fuzzy and wicked challenges’ (Ramos 2014; Quay 2010) (Section 7.5). 
Even where there is low controllability, such as in the case of climate 
change, adaptive management can help mitigate impacts, including 
changes in water availability and shifting distributions of plants and 
animals (Allen et al. 2011).
There is medium evidence and high agreement that adaptive 
management can help reduce anthropogenic impacts of changes 
of land and climate, including: species decline and habitat loss 
(participative identifi cation, monitoring, and review of species at risk as 
well as decision-making surrounding protective measures) (Fontaine 
2011; Smith 2011) including quantity and timing of harvest of animals 
(Johnson 2011a), human participation in natural resource-based 
recreational activities, including selection fi sh harvest quotas and 
fi shing seasons from year to year (Martin and Pope 2011), managing 
competing interests of land-use planners and conservationists in 
public lands (Moore et al. 2011), managing endangered species and 
minimising fi re risk through land-cover management (Breininger 
et al. 2014), land-use change in hardwood forestry through mediation 
of hardwood plantation forestry companies and other stakeholders, 
including those interested in water, environment or farming (Leys 
and Vanclay 2011), and SLM protecting biodiversity, increasing 
carbon storage, and improving livelihoods (Cowie et al. 2011). There 
is medium evidence and medium agreement that, despite abundant 
literature and theoretical explanation, there has remained imperfect 
realisation of adaptive management because of several challenges: 
lack of clarity in defi nition and approach, few success stories on 
which to build an experiential base practitioner knowledge of 
adaptive management, paradigms surrounding management, policy 
and funding that favour reactive approaches instead of the proactive 
adaptive management approach, shifting objectives that do not 
allow for the application of the approach, and failure to acknowledge 
social uncertainty (Allen et al. 2011). Adaptive management includes 
participation (Section  7.6.4), the use of indicators (Section  7.5.5), 
in order to avoid maladaptation and trade-offs while maximising 
synergies (Section 7.5.6).

Performance indicators
Measuring performance is important in adaptive management 
decision-making, policy instrument implementation and governance, 
and can help evaluate policy effectiveness (medium evidence, high 
agreement) (Wheaton and Kulshreshtha 2017; Bennett and Dearden 
2014; Oliveira Júnior et al. 2016; Kaufmann 2009). Indicators 
can relate to specific policy problems (climate mitigation, land 
degradation), sectors (agriculture, transportation, etc.), and policy 
goals (SDGs, food security).
It is necessary to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency 
of performing climate actions to ensure the long-term success of 
climate initiatives or plans. Measurable indicators are useful for 
climate policy development and decision-making processes since 
they can provide quantifiable information regarding the progress 
of climate actions. The Paris Agreement (UNFCCC 2015) focused on 
reporting the progress of implementing countries’ pledges  – that 
is, NDCs and national adaptation needs in order to examine the 
aggregated results of mitigation actions that have already been 
implemented. For the case of measuring progress toward achieving 
LDN, it was suggested to use land-based indicators – that is, trends 
in land cover and land productivity or functioning of the land, and 
trends in carbon stock above and below ground (Cowie et al. 2018a). 
There is medium evidence and high agreement that indicators for 
measuring biodiversity and ES in response to governance at local 
to international scales meet the criteria of parsimony and scale 
specificity, are linked to some broad social, scientific and political 
consensus on desirable states of ecosystems and biodiversity, and 
include normative aspects such as environmental justice or socially 
just conservation (Layke 2009; Van Oudenhoven et al. 2012; Turnhout 
et al. 2014; Häyhä and Franzese 2014; Guerry et al. 2015; Díaz 
et al. 2015).
Important in making choices of metrics and indicators is 
understanding that the science, linkages and dynamics in systems 
are complex, not amenable to be addressed by simple economic 
instruments, and are often unrelated to short-term management 
or governance scales (Naeem et al. 2015; Muradian and Rival 
2012). Thus, ideally, stakeholders participate in the selection and 
use of indicators for biodiversity and ES and monitoring impacts of 
governance and management regimes on land–climate interfaces. 
The adoption of non-economic approaches that are part of the 
emerging concept of Nature’s Contributions to People (NCP) could 
potentially elicit support for conservation from diverse sections of 
civil society (Pascual et al. 2017).
Recent studies increasingly incorporate the role of stakeholders 
and decision-makers in the selection of indicators for land systems 
(Verburg et al. 2015) including sustainable agriculture (Kanter et al. 
2016), bioenergy sustainability (Dale et al. 2015), desertification 
(Liniger et al. 2019), and vulnerability (Debortoli et al. 2018). 
Kanter et al. (2016) propose a four-step ‘cradle-to-grave’ approach 
for agriculture trade-off analysis, which involves co-evaluation of 
indicators and trade-offs with both stakeholders and decision-makers.
7.5.6 
Maximising synergies and minimising trade-offs
Synergies and trade-offs to address land and climate-related measures 
are identified and discussed in Chapter 6. Here we outline policies 
supporting Chapter 6 response options (see Table 7.5), and discuss 
synergies and trade-offs in policy choices and interactions among 
policies. Trade-offs will exist between broad policy approaches. 
For example, while legislative and regulatory approaches may 
be effective at achieving environmental goals, they may be costly 
and ideologically unattractive in some countries. Market-driven 
approaches such as carbon pricing are cost-effective ways to reduce 
emissions, but may not be favoured politically and economically 
(Section  7.4.4). Information provision involves little political risk 
or ideological constraints, but behavioural barriers may limit 
their effectiveness (Henstra 2016). This level of trade-off is often 
determined by the prevailing political system.
Synergies and trade-offs also result from interaction between policies 
(policy interplay; Urwin and Jordan 2008) at different levels of policy 
(vertical) and across different policies (horizontal) (Section  7.4.8). 
If policy mixes are designed appropriately, acknowledging and 
incorporating trade-offs and synergies, they are better placed to 
deliver an outcome such as transitioning to sustainability (Howlett 
and Rayner 2013; Huttunen et al. 2014) (medium evidence and 
medium agreement). However, there is limited evidence and medium 
agreement that evaluating policies for coherence in responding to 
climate change and its impacts is not occurring, and policies are 
instead reviewed in a fragmented manner (Hurlbert and Gupta 2016).

Cross-Chapter Box 9 |  Climate and land pathways

(India), Alexander Popp (Germany), Prajal Pradhan (Nepal/Germany)
Future development of socio-economic factors and policies influence the evolution of the land–climate system, among others, in terms 
of the land used for agriculture and forestry. Climate mitigation policies can also have a major impact on land use, especially in 
scenarios consistent with the climate targets of the Paris Agreement. This includes the use of bio-energy or CDR, such as bioenergy with 
carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and afforestation. Land-based mitigation options have implications for GHG fluxes, desertification, 
land degradation, food insecurity, ecosystem services and other aspects of sustainable development.
Shared Socio-economic Pathways
The five pathways are based on the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) (O’Neill et al. 2014; Popp et al. 2017; Riahi et al. 2017; 
Rogelj et al. 2018b) (Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1). SSP1 is a scenario with a broad focus on sustainability, including human 
development, technological development, nature conservation, globalised economy, economic convergence and early international 
cooperation (including moderate levels of trade). The scenario includes a peak and decline in population, relatively high agricultural 
yields and a move towards food produced in low-GHG emission systems (Van Vuuren et al. 2017b). Dietary change and reductions 
in food waste reduce agricultural demands, and effective land-use regulation enables reforestation and/or afforestation. SSP2 is 
a scenario in which production and consumption patterns, as well as technological development, follows historical patterns (Fricko 
et al. 2017). Land-based CDR is achieved through bioenergy and BECCS and, to a lesser degree, by afforestation and reforestation. 
SSP3 is a scenario with slow rates of technological change and limited land-use regulation. Agricultural demands are high due to 
material-intensive consumption and production, and barriers to trade lead to reduced flows for agricultural goods. In SSP3, forest 
mitigation activities and abatement of agricultural GHG emissions are limited due to major implementation barriers such as low 
institutional capacities in developing countries and delays as a consequence of low international cooperation (Fujimori et al. 2017). 
Emissions reductions are achieved primarily through the energy sector, including the use of bioenergy and BECCS. 
Policies in the Pathways
SSPs are complemented by a set of shared policy assumptions (Kriegler et al. 2014), indicating the types of policies that may be 
implemented in each future world. Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) represent the effect of these policies on the economy, energy 
system, land use and climate with the caveat that they are assumed to be effective or, in some cases, the policy goals (e.g., dietary 
change) are imposed rather than explicitly modelled. In the real world, there are various barriers that can make policy implementation 
more difficult (Section 7.4.9). These barriers will be generally higher in SSP3 than SSP1.
SSP1: A number of policies could support SSP1 in future, including: effective carbon pricing, emission trading schemes (including net CO2 
emissions from agriculture), carbon taxes, regulations limiting GHG emissions and air pollution, forest conservation (mix of land sharing 
and land sparing) through participation, incentives for ecosystem services and secure tenure, and protecting the environment, 
microfinance, crop and livelihood insurance, agriculture extension services, agricultural production subsidies, low export tax and 
import tariff rates on agricultural goods, dietary awareness campaigns, taxes on and regulations to reduce food waste, improved 
shelf life, sugar/fat taxes, and instruments supporting sustainable land management, including payment for ecosystem services, 
land-use zoning, REDD+, standards and certification for sustainable biomass production practices, legal reforms on land ownership 
and access, legal aid, legal education, including reframing these policies as entitlements for women and small agricultural producers 
(rather than sustainability) (Van Vuuren et al. 2017b; O’Neill, B.C. et al., 2017) (Section 7.4). 
SSP2: The same policies that support SSP1 could support SSP2 but may be less effective and only moderately successful. Policies 
may be challenged by adaptation limits (Section 7.4.9), inconsistency in formal and informal institutions in decision-making 
(Section 7.5.1) or result in maladaptation (Section 7.4.7). Moderately successful sustainable land management policies result in some 
land competition. Land degradation neutrality is moderately successful. Successful policies include those supporting bioenergy and BECCS 
(Rao et al. 2017b; Fricko et al. 2017; Riahi et al. 2017) (Section 7.4.6). 
SSP3: Policies that exist in SSP1 may or may not exist in SSP3, and are ineffective (O’Neill et al. 2014). There are challenges to 
implementing these policies, as in SSP2. In addition, ineffective sustainable land management policies result in competition for 
land between agriculture and mitigation. Land degradation neutrality is not achieved (Riahi et al. 2017). Successful policies include 
those supporting bioenergy and BECCS (Kriegler et al. 2017; Fujimori et al. 2017; Rao et al. 2017b) (Section 7.4.6). Demand-side 
food policies are absent and supply-side policies predominate. There is no success in advancing land ownership and access policies 
for agricultural producer livelihood (Section 7.6.5). 
This is a duplicate of Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 6.

Cross-Chapter Box 9 (continued)
Land-use and land-cover change
In SSP1, sustainability in land management, agricultural intensifi cation, production and consumption patterns result in reduced need 
for agricultural land, despite increases in per capita food consumption. This land can instead be used for reforestation, afforestation 
and bioenergy. In contrast, SSP3 has high population and strongly declining rates of crop yield growth over time, resulting in increased 
agricultural land area. SSP2 falls somewhere in between, with societal as well as technological development following historical 
patterns. Increased demand for land mitigation options such as bioenergy, reduced deforestation or afforestation decreases availability 
of agricultural land for food, feed and fi bre. In the climate policy scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement, bioenergy/BECCS and 
reforestation/afforestation play an important role in SSP1 and SSP2. The use of these options, and the impact on land, is larger in scenarios 
that limit radiative forcing in 2100 to 1.9 W m–2 than in the 4.5 W m–2 scenarios. In SSP3, the expansion of land for agricultural 
production implies that the use of land-related mitigation options is very limited, and the scenario is characterised by continued deforestation. 
Cross-Chapter Box 9, Figure 1 |  Changes in agriculture land (left), bioenergy cropland (middle) and forest (right) under three different SSPs 
(colours) and two different warming levels (rows). Agricultural land includes both pasture and cropland. Colours indicate SSPs, with SSP1 shown in green, 
SSP2 in yellow, and SSP3 in red. For each pathway, the shaded areas show the range across all IAMs; the line indicates the median across models. There is no SSP3 in 
the top row, as 1.9 W m–2 is infeasible in this world. Data is from an update of the Integrated Assessment Modelling Consortium (IAMC) Scenario Explorer developed 
for the SR15 (Huppmann et al. 2018; Rogelj et al. 2018a).
Implications for mitigation and other land challenges
The combination of baseline emissions development, technology options, and policy support makes it much easier to reach the climate 
targets in the SSP1 scenario than in the SSP3 scenario. As a result, carbon prices are much higher in SSP3 than in SSP1. In fact, the 1.9 
W m–2 target was found to be infeasible in the SSP3 world (Table 1 in Cross-Chapter Box 9). Energy system CO2 emissions reductions 
are greater in SSP3 than in SSP1 to compensate for the higher land-based CO2 emissions. 
Accounting for mitigation and socio-economics alone, food prices (an indicator of food insecurity) are higher in SSP3 than in SSP1 
and higher in the 1.9 W m–2 target than in the 4.5 W m–2 target (Table 1 in Cross-Chapter Box 9). Forest cover is higher in SSP1 than 
SSP3 and higher in the 1.9 W m–2 target than in the 4.5 W m–2 target. Water withdrawals and water scarcity are, in general, higher 
in SSP3 than SSP1 (Hanasaki et al. 2013; Graham et al. 2018) and higher in scenarios with more bioenergy (Hejazi et al. 2014b); 
however, these indicators have not been quantifi ed for the specifi c SSP-representative concentration pathways (RCP) combinations 
discussed here.

Cross-Chapter Box 9 (continued)
Climate change results in higher impacts and risks in the 4.5 W m–2 world than in the 1.9 W m–2 world for a given SSP and these risks 
are exacerbated in SSP3 compared to SSP1 and SSP2 due to the population’s higher exposure and vulnerability. For example, the risk 
of fire is higher in warmer worlds; in the 4.5 W m–2 world, the population living in fire prone regions is higher in SSP3 (646 million) 
than in SSP2 (560 million) (Knorr et al. 2016). Global exposure to multi-sector risk quadruples between 1.5°C1 and 3°C and is a factor 
of six higher in SSP3-3°C than in SSP1-1.5°C (Byers et al. 2018). Future risks resulting from desertification, land degradation and food 
insecurity are lower in SSP1 compared to SSP3 at the same level of warming. For example, the transition moderate-to-high risk of 
food insecurity occurs between 1.3 and 1.7°C for SSP3, but not until 2.5 to 3.5°C in SSP1 (Section 7.2).
Summary
Future pathways for climate and land use include portfolios of response and policy options. Depending on the response options 
included, policy portfolios implemented, and other underlying socio-economic drivers, these pathways result in different land-use 
consequences and their contribution to climate change mitigation. Agricultural area declines by more than 5 Mkm2 in one SSP but 
increases by as much as 5 Mkm2 in another. The amount of energy cropland ranges from nearly zero to 11 Mkm2, depending on the SSP 
and the warming target. Forest area declines in SSP3 but increases substantially in SSP1. Subsequently, these pathways have different 
implications for risks related to desertification, land degradation, food insecurity, and terrestrial GHG fluxes, as well as ecosystem 
services, biodiversity, and other aspects of sustainable development.

Pathways that limit radiative forcing in 2100 to 1.9 W m–2 result in median warming in 2100 to 1.5°C in 2100 (Rogelj et al. 2018b). Pathways limiting radiative forcing 
in 2100 to 4.5 W m–2 result in median warming in 2100 above 2.5°C (IPCC 2014).
7.5.6.1 
Trade-offs and synergies between 
ecosystem services (ES)
Unplanned or unintentional trade-offs and synergies between 
policy driven response options related to ecosystem services (ES) 
can happen over space (e.g., upstream-downstream, integrated 
watershed management, Section  3.7.5.2) or intensify over time 
(reduced water in future dry-season due to growing tree plantations, 
Section 6.4.1). Trade-offs can occur between two or more ES (land 
for climate mitigation vs food; Sections 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, Cross-Chapter 
Box 8 in Chapter 6; Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapters 6 and 7), and 
between scales, such as forest biomass-based livelihoods versus 
global ES carbon storage (Chhatre and Agrawal 2009) (medium 
evidence, medium agreement). Trade-offs can be reversible or 
irreversible (Rodríguez et al. 2006; Elmqvist et al. 2013) (for example, 
a soil carbon sink is reversible) (Section 6.4.1.1).
Although there is robust evidence and high agreement that ES are 
important for human well-being, the relationship between poverty 
alleviation and ES can be surprisingly complex, understudied and 
dependent on the political economic context; current evidence 
is largely about provisioning services and often ignores multiple 
dimensions of poverty (Suich et al. 2015; Vira et al. 2012). Spatially 
explicit mapping and quantification of stakeholder choices in 
relation to distribution of various ES can help enhance synergies 
and reduce trade-offs (Turkelboom et al. 2018; Locatelli et al. 2014) 
(Section 7.5.5).
7.5.6.2 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): Synergies 
and trade-offs
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are an international 
persuasive policy instrument that apply to all countries, and measure 
sustainable and socially just development of human societies at 
all scales of governance (Griggs et al. 2013). The UN SDGs rest on 
the premise that the goals are mutually reinforcing and there are 
inherent linkages, synergies and trade-offs (to a  greater or lesser 
extent) between and within the sub-goals (Fuso Nerini et al. 2018; 
Nilsson et al. 2016b; Le Blanc 2015). There is high confidence 
that opportunities, trade-offs and co-benefits are context  – and 
region-specific and depend on a  variety of political, national and 
socio-economic factors (Nilsson et al. 2016b) depending on perceived 
importance by decision-makers and policymakers (Figure  7.7 and 
Table 7.6). Aggregation of targets and indicators at the national level 
can mask severe biophysical and socio-economic trade-offs at local 
and regional scales (Wada et al. 2016).
There is medium evidence and high agreement that SDGs must not 
be pursued independently, but in a manner that recognises trade-offs 
and synergies with each other, consistent with a  goal of ‘policy 
coherence’. Policy coherence also refers to spatial trade-offs and 
geopolitical implications within and between regions and countries 
implementing SDGs. For instance, supply-side food security initiatives 
of land-based agriculture are impacting on marine fisheries globally 
through creation of dead-zones due to agricultural run-off (Diaz and 
Rosenberg 2008).
SDGs 6 (clean water and sanitation), 7 (affordable and clean energy) 
and 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure) are important SDGs 
related to mitigation with adaptation co-benefits, but they have local 
731
Risk management and decision-making in relation to sustainable development 
Chapter 7

trade-offs with biodiversity and competing uses of land and rivers 
(see Case study: Green energy: Biodiversity conservation vs global 
environment targets) (medium evidence, high agreement) (Bogardi 
et al. 2012; Nilsson and Berggren 2000; Hoeinghaus et al. 2009; 
Winemiller et al. 2016). This has occurred despite emerging knowledge 
about the role that rivers and riverine ecosystems play in human 
development and in generating global, regional and local ES (Nilsson 
and Berggren 2000; Hoeinghaus et al. 2009). The transformation of 
river ecosystems for irrigation, hydropower and water requirements 
of societies worldwide is the biggest threat to freshwater and 
estuarine biodiversity and ecosystems services (Nilsson and Berggren 
2000; Vörösmarty et al. 2010). These projects address important 
energy and water-related demands, but their economic benefits are 
often overestimated in relation to trade-offs with respect to food 
(river capture fisheries), biodiversity and downstream ES (Winemiller 
et al. 2016). Some trade-offs and synergies related to SDG7 impact 
on aspirations of greater welfare and well-being, as well as physical 
and social infrastructure for sustainable development (Fuso Nerini 
et al. 2018) (Section 7.5.6.1, where trade-offs exist between climate 
mitigation and food).
There are also spatial trade-offs related to large river diversion 
projects and export of ‘virtual water’ through water-intensive crops 
produced in one region and exported to another, with implications 
for food security, water security and downstream ES of the exporting 
region (Hanasaki et al. 2010; Verma et al. 2009). Synergies include 
cropping adaptations that increase food system production and 
eliminate hunger (SDG2) (Rockström et al. 2017; Lipper et al. 2014a; 
Neufeldt et al. 2013). Well-adapted agricultural systems are shown 
to have synergies, positive returns on investment and contribute 
to safe drinking water, health, biodiversity and equity goals 
(DeClerck 2016). Assessing the water footprint of different sectors 
at the river basin scale can provide insights for interventions and 
decision-making (Zeng et al. 2012).
Sometimes the trade-offs in SDGs can arise in the articulation and 
nested hierarchy of 17 goals and the targets under them. In terms of 
aquatic life and ecosystems, there is an explicit SDG for sustainable 
management of marine life (SDG 14, Life below water). There is no 
equivalent goal exclusively for freshwater ecosystems, but hidden 
under SDG 6  (Clean water and sanitation) out of six listed targets, 
the sixth target is about protecting and restoring water-related 
ecosystems, which suggests a lower order of global priority compared 
to being listed as a goal in itself (e.g., SDG 14).
There is limited evidence and limited agreement that binary 
evaluations of individual SDGs and synergies and trade-offs that 
categorise interactions as either ‘beneficial’ or ‘adverse’ may be 
subjective and challenged further by the fact that feedbacks can 
often not be assigned as unambiguously positive or negative (Blanc 
et al. 2017). The IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C 
(SR15) notes: ‘A reductive focus on specific SDGs in isolation may 
undermine the long-term achievement of sustainable climate change 
mitigation’ (Holden et al. 2017). Greater work is needed to tease out 
these relationships; studies have started that include quantitative 
modelling (see Karnib 2017) and nuanced scoring scales (ICSU 2017) 
of these relationships.
A nexus approach is increasingly being adopted to explore synergies 
and trade-offs between a select subset of goals and targets (such 
as the interaction between water, energy and food  – see for 
example, Yumkella and Yillia 2015; Conway et al. 2015; Ringler et 
al. 2015). However, even this approach ignores systemic properties 
and interactions across the system as a whole (Weitz et al. 2017a). 
Pursuit of certain targets in one area can generate rippling effects 
across the system, and these in turn can have secondary impacts on 
yet other targets. Weitz et al. (2017a) found that SDG target 13.2 
(climate change policy/planning) is influenced by actions in six other 
targets. SDG 13.1 (climate change adaption) and also SDG 2.4 (food 
production) receive the most positive influence from progression in 
other targets.
There is medium evidence and high agreement that, to be effective, 
truly sustainable, and to reduce or mitigate emerging risks, SDGs 
need knowledge dissemination and policy initiatives that recognise 
and assimilate concepts of co-production of ES in socio-ecological 
systems, cross-scale linkages, uncertainty, spatial and temporal 
trade-offs between SDGs and ES that acknowledge biophysical, 
social and political constraints and understand how social change 
occurs at various scales (Rodríguez et al. 2006; Norström et al. 2014; 
Palomo et al. 2016). Several methods and tools are proposed in 
literature to address and understand SDG interactions. Nilsson et al. 
(2016a) suggest going beyond a simplistic framing of synergies and 
trade-offs to understanding the various relationship dimensions, 
and proposing a seven-point scale to understand these interactions.
This approach, and the identification of clusters of synergy, can 
help indicate that government ministries work together or establish 
collaborations to reach their specific goals. Finally, context-specific 
analysis is needed. Synergies and trade-offs will depend on the 
natural resource base (such as land or water availability), governance 
arrangements, available technologies, and political ideas in a given 
location (Nilsson et al. 2016b). Figure 7.7 shows that, at the global 
scale, there is less uncertainty in the evidence surrounding SDGs, 
but also less agreement on norms, priorities and values for SDG 
implementation. Although there is some agreement on the regional 
and local scale surrounding SDGs, there is higher certainty on the 
science surrounding ES.

7.5.6.3 
Forests and agriculture
Retaining existing forests, restoring degraded forest and afforestation 
are response options for climate change mitigation with adaptation 
benefits (Section 6.4.1). Policies at various levels of governance that 
foster ownership, autonomy, and provide incentives for forest cover 
can reduce trade-offs between carbon sinks in forests and local 
livelihoods (especially when the size of forest commons is sufficiently 
large) (Chhatre and Agrawal 2009; Locatelli et al. 2014) (see Table 7.6 
this section; Case study: Forest conservation instruments: REDD+ in 
the Amazon and India, Section 7.4.6).
Forest restoration for mitigation through carbon sequestration and 
other ES or co-benefits (e.g., hydrologic, non-timber forest products, 
timber and tourism) can be passive or active (although both types 
largely exclude livestock). Passive restoration is more economically 
viable in relation to restoration costs as well as co-benefits in other 
ES, calculated on a net present value basis, especially under flexible 
carbon credits (Cantarello et al. 2010). Restoration can be more cost 
effective with positive socio-economic and biodiversity conservation 
outcomes, if costly and simplistic planting schemes are avoided 
(Menz et al. 2013). Passive restoration takes longer to demonstrate 
co-benefits and net economic gains. It can be confused with land 
abandonment in some regions and countries, and therefore secure 
land-tenure at individual or community scales is important for its 
success (Zahawi et al. 2014). Potential approaches include improved 
markets and payment schemes for ES (Tengberg et al. 2016) 
(Section 7.4.6). 
Proper targeting of incentive schemes and reducing poverty through 
access to ES requires knowledge regarding the distribution of 
beneficiaries, information about those whose livelihoods are likely 
to be impacted, and in what manner (Nayak et al. 2014; Loaiza 
et al. 2015; Vira et al. 2012). Institutional arrangements to govern 
ecosystems are believed to synergistically influence maintenance 
of carbon storage and forest-based livelihoods, especially when 
they incorporate local knowledge and decentralised decision-
making (Chhatre and Agrawal 2009). Earning carbon credits from 
reforestation with native trees involves the higher cost of certification 
and validation processes, increasing the temptation to choose fast-
growing (perhaps non-native) species with consequences for native 
biodiversity. Strategies and policies that aggregate landowners or 
forest dwellers are needed to reduce the cost to individuals and 
payment for ecosystem services (PES) schemes can generate synergies 
(Bommarco et al. 2013; Chhatre and Agrawal 2009). Bundling several 
PES schemes that address more than one ES can increase income 
generated by forest restoration (Brancalion et al. 2012).
In the forestry sector, there is evidence that adaptation and 
mitigation can be fostered in concert. A recent assessment of the 
California Forestry Offset Project shows that, by compensating 
individuals and industries for forest conservation, such programmes 
can deliver mitigation and sustainability co-benefits (Anderson et al. 
2017). Adaptive forest management focusing on reintroducing native 
tree species can provide both mitigation and adaptation benefit by 
reducing fire risk and increasing carbon storage (Astrup et al. 2018). 
In the agricultural sector, there has been little published empirical 
work on interactions between adaptation and mitigation policies. 
Smith and Oleson (2010) describe potential relationships, focusing 
particularly on the arable sector, predominantly on mitigation efforts, 
and more on measures than policies. The considerable potential of 
the agro-forestry sector for synergies and contributing to increasing 
resilience of tropical farming systems is discussed in Verchot et al. 
(2007) with examples from Africa.
Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) has emerged in recent years as 
an approach to integrate food security and climate challenges. The 
three pillars of CSA are to: (1) adapt and build resilience to climate 
change; (2) reduce GHG emissions, and; (3) sustainably increase 
agricultural productivity, ultimately delivering ‘triple-wins’ (Lipper 
et al. 2014c). While the idea is conceptually appealing, a range of 
criticisms, contradictions and challenges exist in using CSA as the 
route to resilience in global agriculture, notably around the political 
economy (Newell and Taylor 2017), the vagueness of the definition, 
and consequent assimilation by the mainstream agricultural sector, 
as well as issues around monitoring, reporting and evaluation 
(Arakelyan et al. 2017).
Land-based mitigation is facing important trade-offs with 
food production, biodiversity and local biogeophysical effects 
(Humpenöder et al. 2017; Krause et al. 2017; Robledo-Abad et al. 
2017; Boysen et al. 2016, 2017a,b). Synergies between bioenergy 
and food security could be achieved by investing in a combination 
of instruments, including technology and innovations, infrastructure, 
pricing, flex crops, and improved communication and stakeholder 
engagement (Kline et al. 2017). Managing these trade-offs might 
also require demand-side interventions, including dietary change 
incentives (Section 5.7.1).
Synergies and trade-offs also result from interaction between policies 
(Urwin and Jordan 2008) at different levels of policy (vertical) and 
across different policies (horizontal) – see also Section 7.4.8. If policy 
mixes are designed appropriately, acknowledging and incorporating 
trade-offs and synergies, they are more apt to deliver an outcome 
such as transitioning to sustainability (Howlett and Rayner 2013; 
Huttunen et al. 2014) (medium evidence and medium agreement). 
However, there is medium evidence and medium agreement that 
evaluating policies for coherence in responding to climate change 
and its impacts is not occurring, and policies are instead reviewed in 
a fragmented manner (Hurlbert and Gupta 2016).
7.5.6.4 
Water, food and aquatic ecosystem services (ES)
Trade-offs between some types of water use (e.g., irrigation for food 
security) and other ecosystem services (ES) are expected to intensify 
under climate change (Hanjra and Ejaz Qureshi 2010). There is an 
urgency to develop approaches to understand and communicate this 
to policymakers and decision-makers (Zheng et al. 2016). Reducing 
water use in agriculture (Mekonnen and Hoekstra 2016) through 
policies on both the supply and demand side, such as a shift to less 
water-intensive crops (Richter et al. 2017; Fishman et al. 2015), and 
a shift in diets (Springmann et al. 2016) has the potential to reduce 
trade-offs between food security and freshwater aquatic ES (medium 
734
Chapter 7 
Risk management and decision-making in relation to sustainable development
7
evidence, high agreement). There is strong evidence that improved 
efficiency in irrigation can actually increase overall water use in 
agriculture, and therefore its contribution to improved flows in rivers 
is questionable (Ward and Pulido-Velazquez 2008).
There are now powerful new analytical approaches, high-resolution 
data and decision-making tools that help to predict cumulative 
impacts of dams, assess trade-offs between engineering and 
environmental goals, and can help funders and decision-makers 
compare alternative sites or designs for dam-building as well as to 
manage flows in regulated rivers based on experimental releases and 
adaptive learning. This could minimise ecological costs and maximise 
synergies with other development goals under climate change (Poff 
et al. 2003; Winemiller et al. 2016). Furthermore, the adoption of 
metrics based on the emerging concept of Nature’s Contributions 
to People (NCP) under the IPBES framework brings in non-economic 
instruments and values that, in combination with conventional 
valuation of ES approaches, could elicit greater support for non-
consumptive water use of rivers for achieving SDG goals (De Groot 
et al. 2010; Pascual et al. 2017).
7.5.6.5 
Considering synergies and trade-offs 
to avoid maladaptation
Coherent policies that consider synergies and trade-offs can also 
reduce the likelihood of maladaptation, which is the opposite of 
sustainable adaptation (Magnan et al. 2016). Sustainable adaptation 
‘contributes to socially and environmentally sustainable development 
pathways including both social justice and environmental integrity’ 
(Eriksen et al. 2011). In IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) there 
was medium evidence and high agreement that maladaptation 
is ‘a cause of increasing concern to adaptation planners, where 
intervention in one location or sector could increase the vulnerability 
of another location or sector, or increase the vulnerability of a group 
to future climate change’ (Noble et al. 2014). AR5 recognised that 
maladaptation arises not only from inadvertent, badly planned 
adaptation actions, but also from deliberate decisions where wider 
considerations place greater emphasis on short-term outcomes 
ahead of longer-term threats, or that discount, or fail to consider, 
the full range of interactions arising from planned actions (Noble 
et al. 2014).
Some maladaptations are only beginning to be recognised as 
we become aware of unintended consequences of decisions. 
An example prevalent across many countries is irrigation as an 
adaptation to water scarcity. During a drought from 2007–2009 in 
California, farmers adapted by using more groundwater, thereby 
depleting groundwater elevation by 15 metres. This volume of 
groundwater depletion is unsustainable environmentally and also 
emits GHG emissions during the pumping (Christian-Smith et al. 
2015). Despite the three years of drought, the agricultural sector 
performed financially well, due to the groundwater use and crop 
insurance payments. Drought compensation programmes through 
crop insurance policies may reduce the incentive to shift to lower 
water-use crops, thereby perpetuating the maladaptive situation. 
Another example of maladaptation that may appear as adaptation 
to drought is pumping out groundwater and storing in surface 
farm ponds, with consequences for water justice, inequity and 
sustainability (Kale 2017). These examples highlight the potential 
for maladaptation from farmers’ adaptation decisions as well as the 
unintended consequences of policy choices; the examples illustrate 
the findings of Barnett and O’Neill (2010) that maladaptation can 
include: high opportunity costs (including economic, environmental, 
and social); reduced incentives to adapt (adaptation measures that 
reduce incentives to adapt by not addressing underlying causes); and 
path dependency or trajectories that are difficult to change.
In practice, maladaptation is a specific instance of policy incoherence, 
and it may be useful to develop a framework in designing policy to 
avoid this type of trade-off. This would specify the type, aim and 
target audience of an adaptation action, decision, project, plan, 
or policy designed initially for adaptation, but actually at high risk 
of inducing adverse effects, either on the system in which it was 
developed, or another connected system, or both. The assessment 
requires identifying system boundaries, including temporal and 
geographical scales at which the outcomes are assessed (Magnan 
2014; Juhola et al. 2016). National-level institutions that cover the 
spectrum of sectors affected, or enhanced collaboration between 
relevant institutions, is expected to increase the effectiveness of 
policy instruments, as are joint programmes and funds (Morita and 
Matsumoto 2018).
As new knowledge about trade-offs and synergies amongst land-
climate processes emerges regionally and globally, concerns over 
emerging risks and the need for planning policy responses grow. 
There is medium evidence and medium agreement that trade-
offs currently do not figure into existing climate policies including 
NDCs and SDGs being vigorously pursued by some countries (Woolf 
et al. 2018). For instance, the biogeophysical co-benefits of reduced 
deforestation and re/afforestation measures (Chapter 6) are usually 
not accounted for in current climate policies or in the NDCs, but there 
is increasing scientific evidence to include them as part of the policy 
design (Findell et al. 2017; Hirsch et al. 2018; Bright et al. 2017).

Green and renewable energy and transportation are emerging as important parts of climate change mitigation globally (medium evidence, 
high agreement) (McKinnon 2010; Zarfl et al. 2015; Creutzig et al. 2017). Evidence is, however, emerging across many biomes (from 
coastal to semi-arid and humid) about how green energy may have significant trade-offs with biodiversity and ecosystem services, 
thus demonstrating the need for closer environmental scrutiny and safeguards (Gibson et al. 2017; Hernandez et al. 2015). In most 
cases, the accumulated impact of pressures from decades of land use and habitat loss set the context within which the potential 
impacts of renewable energy generation need to be considered.
Until recently, small hydropower projects (SHPs) were considered environmentally benign compared to large dams. SHPs are poorly 
understood, especially since the impacts of clusters of small dams are just becoming evident (Mantel et al. 2010; Fencl et al. 2015; 
Kibler and Tullos 2013). SHPs (<25/30 MW) are labelled ‘green’ and are often exempt from environmental scrutiny (Abbasi and 
Abbasi 2011; Pinho et al. 2007; Premalatha et al. 2014b; Era Consultancy 2006). Being promoted in mountainous global biodiversity 
hotspots, SHPs have changed the hydrology, water quality and ecology of headwater streams and neighbouring forests significantly. 
SHPs have created dewatered stretches of stream immediately downstream and introduced sub-daily to sub-weekly hydro-pulses 
that have transformed the natural dry-season flow regime. Hydrologic and ecological connectivity have been impacted, especially for 
endemic fish communities and forests in some sites of significant biodiversity values (medium evidence, medium agreement) (Jumani 
et al. 2017, 2018; Chhatre and Lakhanpal 2018; Anderson et al. 2006; Grumbine and Pandit 2013). In some sites, local communities 
have opposed SHPs due to concerns about their impact on local culture and livelihoods (Jumani et al. 2017, 2018; Chhatre and 
Lakhanpal 2018).
Semi-arid and arid regions are often found suitable for wind and solar farms which may impact endemic biodiversity and endangered 
species (Collar et al. 2015, Thaker, M, Zambre, A. Bhosale 2018). The loss of habitat for these species over the decades has been largely 
due to agricultural intensification driven by irrigation and bad management in designated reserves (Collar et al. 2015; Ledec, George 
C.; Rapp, Kennan W.; Aiello 2011) but intrusion of power lines is a major worry for highly endangered species such as the Great Indian 
Bustard (Great Indian Bustard (Ardeotis nigriceps) and conservation and mitigation efforts are being planned to address such concerns 
(Government of India 2012). In many regions around the world, wind-turbines and solar farms pose a threat to many other species 
especially predatory birds and insectivorous bats (medium evidence, medium agreement) (Thaker, M, Zambre, A. Bhosale 2018) and 
disrupt habitat connectivity (Northrup and Wittemyer 2013). 
Additionally, conversion of rivers into waterways has emerged as a fuel-efficient (low carbon emitting) and environment-
friendly alternative to surface land transport (IWAI 2016; Dharmadhikary, S., and Sandbhor 2017). India’s National Waterways seeks 
to cut transportation time and costs and reduce carbon emissions from road transport (Admin 2017). There is some evidence that 
dredging and under-water noise could impact the water quality, human health and habitat of fish species (Junior et al. 2012; Martins 
et al. 2012), disrupt artisanal fisheries and potentially impact species that rely on echo-location (low evidence, medium agreement) 
(Dey Mayukh 2018). Off-shore renewable energy projects in coastal zones have been known to have similar impacts on marine fauna 
(Gill 2005). The Government of India has decided to support studies of the impact of waterways on the endangered Gangetic dolphin 
in order in order to plan mitigation measures. 
Responses to mitigating and reducing the negative impacts of small dams include changes in SHP operations and policies to enable 
the conservation of river fish diversity. These include mandatory environmental impact assessments, conserving remaining undammed 
headwater streams in regulated basins, maintaining adequate environmental flows, and implementing other adaptation measures 
based on experiments with active management of fish communities in impacted zones (Jumani et al. 2018). Location of large solar 
farms needs to be carefully scrutinised (Sindhu et al. 2017). For mitigating negative impacts of power lines associated with solar 
and wind farms in bustard habitats, suggested measures include diversion structures to prevent collision, underground cables and 
avoidance in core wildlife habitat, as well as incentives for maintaining low-intensity rainfed agriculture and pasture around existing 
reserves, and curtailing harmful infrastructure in priority areas (Collar et al. 2015). Mitigation for minimising the ecological impact of 
inland waterways on biodiversity and fisheries is more complicated, but may involve improved boat technology to reduce underwater 
noise, maintaining ecological flows and thus reduced dredging, and avoidance in key habitats (Dey Mayukh 2018).
The management of ecological trade-offs of green energy and green infrastructure and transportation projects may be crucial for long-
term sustainability and acceptance of emerging low-carbon economies.

7.6 
Governance: Governing the 
land–climate interface
Building on the definition in Section  7.1.2, governance situates 
decision-making and selection or calibration of policy instruments 
within the reality of the multitude of actors operating in respect 
of land and climate interactions. Governance includes all of the 
processes, structures, rules and traditions that govern; governance 
processes may be undertaken by actors including a government, 
market, organisation, or family (Bevir 2011). Governance processes 
determine how people in societies make decisions (Patterson 
et al. 2017) and involve the interactions among formal and informal 
institutions (Section  7.4.1) through which people articulate their 
interests, exercise their legal rights, meet their legal obligations, and 
mediate their differences (Plummer and Baird 2013). 
The act of governance ‘is a social function centred on steering 
collective behaviour toward desired outcomes [sustainable climate-
resilient development] and away from undesirable outcomes’ 
(Young 2017a). This definition of governance allows for it to be 
decoupled from the more familiar concept of government and 
studied in the context of complex human–environment relations 
and environmental and resource regimes (Young 2017a) and used 
to address the interconnected challenges facing food and agriculture 
(FAO 2017b). These challenges include assessing, combining, and 
implementing policy instruments at different governance levels in 
a mutually reinforcing way, managing trade-offs while capitalising 
on synergies (Section  7.5.6), and employing experimentalist 
approaches for improved and effective governance (FAO 2017b), for 
example, adaptive climate governance (Section 7.6.3). Emphasising 
governance also represents a shift of traditional resource management 
(focused on hierarchical state control) towards recognition that 
political and decision-making authority can be exercised through 
interlinked groups of diverse actors (Kuzdas et al. 2015).
This section will start by describing institutions and institutional 
arrangements – the core of a governance system (Young 2017)  – 
that build adaptive and mitigative capacity. The section then outlines 
modes, levels and scales of governance for sustainable climate-resilient 
development. It does on to describe adaptive climate governance that 
responds to uncertainty, and explore institutional dimensions of adaptive 
governance that create an enabling environment for strong institutional 
capital. We then discuss land tenure (an important institutional context 
for effective and appropriate selection of policy instruments), and 
end with the participation of people in decision-making through 
inclusive governance.
7.6.1 
Institutions building adaptive 
and mitigative capacity
Institutions are rules and norms held in common by social actors 
that guide, constrain, and shape human interaction. Institutions 
can be formal – such as laws, policies, and structured decision-
making processes (Section 7.5.1.1) – or informal – such as norms, 
conventions, and decision-making following customary norms 
and habits (Section 7.5.1.2). Organisations – such as parliaments, 
regulatory agencies, private firms, and community bodies – as well 
as people, develop and act in response to institutional frameworks 
and the incentives they frame. ‘Institutions can guide, constrain, and 
shape human interaction through direct control, through incentives, 
and through processes of socialization’ (IPCC 2014d, p. 1768). Nations 
with ‘well developed institutional systems are considered to have 
greater adaptive capacity’, and better institutional capacity to help 
deal with risks associated with future climate change (IPCC, 2001, 
p. 896). Institutions may also prevent the development of adaptive 
capacity when they are ‘sticky’ or characterised by strong path 
dependence (Mahoney 2000; North 1991) and prevent changes that 
are important to address climate change (Section 7.4.9).
Formal and informal governance structures are composed of these 
institutionalised rule systems that determine vulnerability as 
they influence power relations, risk perceptions and establish the 
context wherein risk reduction, adaptation and vulnerability are 
managed (Cardona 2012). Governance institutions determine the 
management of a community’s assets, the community members’ 
relationships with one another, and with natural resources (Hurlbert 
and Diaz 2013). Traditional or locally evolved institutions, backed by 
cultural norms, can contribute to resilience and adaptive capacity. 
Anderson et al. (2010) suggest that these are a particular feature of 
dry land societies that are highly prone to environmental risk and 
uncertainty. Concepts of resilience, and specifically the resilience 
of socio-ecological systems, have advanced analysis of adaptive 
institutions and adaptive governance in relation to climate change 
and land (Boyd and Folke 2011a). In their characterisation, ‘resilience 
is the ability to reorganise following crisis, continuing to learn, 
evolving with the same identity and function, and also innovating 
and sowing the seeds for transformation. It is a central concept 
of adaptive governance’ (Boyd and Folke 2012). In the context of 
complex and multi-scale socio-ecological systems, important features 
of adaptive institutions that contribute to resilience include the 
characteristics of an adaptive governance system (Section 7.6.6).
There is high confidence that adaptive institutions have a strong 
learning dimension and include:
1. Institutions advancing the capacity to learn through availability, 
access to, accumulation of, and interpretation of information 
(such as drought projections, costing of alternatives land, 
food, and water strategies). Government-supported networks, 
learning platforms, and facilitated interchange between 
actors with boundary and bridging organisations, creating 
the necessary self-organisation to prepare for the unknown. 
Through transparent, flexible networks, whole sets of complex 
problems of land, food and climate can be tackled to develop 
shared visions and critique land and food management systems 
assessing gaps and generating solutions.
2. Institutions advancing learning by experimentation (in interpretation 
of information, new ways of governing, and treating policy as an 
ongoing experiment) through many interrelated decisions, but 
especially those that connect the social to the ecological and entail 
anticipatory planning by considering a longer-term time frame. 
Mechanisms to do so include ecological stewardship, and rituals 
and beliefs of indigenous societies that sustain ES.

3. Institutions that decide on pathways to realise system change 
through cultural, inter and intra organisational collaboration, 
with a flexible regulatory framework allowing for new cognitive 
frames of ‘sustainable’ land management and ‘safe’ water supply 
that open alternative pathways (Karpouzoglou et al. 2016; Bettini 
et al. 2015; Boyd et al. 2015; Boyd and Folke 2011b, and 2012).
Shortcomings of resilience theory include limits in relation to 
its conceptualisation of social change (Cote and Nightingale 
2012), its potential to be used as a normative concept, implying 
politically prescriptive policy solutions (Thorén and Olsson 2017; 
Weichselgartner and Kelman 2015; Milkoreit et al. 2015), its 
applicability to local needs and experiences (Forsyth 2018), and its 
potential to hinder evaluation of policy effectiveness (Newton 2016; 
Olsson et al. 2015b). Regardless, concepts of adaptive institutions 
building adaptive capacity in complex socio-ecological systems 
governance have progressed (Karpouzoglou et al. 2016; Dwyer and 
Hodge 2016) in relation to adaptive governance (Koontz et al. 2015).
The study of institutions of governance, levels, modes, and scale of 
governance, in a multi-level and polycentric fashion is important 
because of the multi-scale nature of the challenges to resilience, 
dissemination of ideas, networking and learning.
7.6.2 
Integration – Levels, modes and scale of 
governance for sustainable development
Different types of governance can be distinguished according to 
intended levels (e.g., local, regional, global), domains (national, 
international, transnational), modes (market, network, hierarchy), 
and scales (global regimes to local community groups) (Jordan 
et al. 2015b). Implementation of climate change adaptation and 
mitigation has been impeded by institutional barriers, including 
multi-level governance and policy integration issues (Biesbroek et al. 
2010). To overcome these barriers, climate governance has evolved 
significantly beyond the national and multilateral domains that 
tended to dominate climate efforts and initiatives during the early 
years of the UNFCCC. The climate challenge has been placed in an 
Earth System context, showing the existence of complex interactions 
and governance requirements across different levels, and calling for 
a radical transformation in governance, rather than minor adjustments 
(Biermann et al. 2012). Climate governance literature has expanded 
since AR5 in relation to the sub-national and transnational levels, 
but all levels and their interconnection is important. Expert thinking 
has evolved from implementing good governance at high levels (with 
governments) to a decentred problem-solving approach consistent 
with adaptive governance. This approach involves iterative bottom-
up and experimental mechanisms that might entail addressing 
tenure of land or forest management through a territorial approach 
to development, thereby supporting multi-sectoral governance in 
local, municipal and regional contexts (FAO 2017b). 
Local action in relation to mitigation and adaptation continues to 
be important by complementing and advancing global climate policy 
(Ostrom 2012). Sub-national governance efforts for climate policy, 
especially at the level of cities and communities, have become 
significant during the past decades (medium evidence, medium 
agreement) (Castán Broto 2017; Floater et al. 2014; Albers et al. 2015; 
Archer et al. 2014). A transformation of sorts has been underway 
through deepening engagement from the private sector and NGOs 
as well as government involvement at multiple levels. It is now 
recognised that business organisations, civil society groups, citizens, 
and formal governance all have important roles in governance for 
sustainable development (Kemp et al. 2005).
Transnational governance efforts have increased in number, with 
applications across different economic sectors, geographical 
regions, civil society groups and NGOs. When it comes to climate 
mitigation, transnational mechanisms generally focus on networking 
and may not necessarily be effective in terms of promoting real 
emissions reductions (Michaelowa and Michaelowa 2017). However, 
acceleration in national mitigation measures has been determined to 
coincide with landmark international events such as the lead up to the 
Copenhagen Climate Change Conference 2009 (Iacobuta et al. 2018). 
There is a tendency for transnational governance mechanisms to lack 
monitoring and evaluation procedures (Jordan et al. 2015a).
To address shortcomings of transnational governance, polycentric 
governance considers the interaction between actors at different 
levels of governance (local, regional, national, and global) for a more 
nuanced understanding of the variation in diverse governance 
outcomes in the management of common-pool resources (such as 
forests) based on the needs and interests of citizens (Nagendra and 
Ostrom 2012). A more ‘polycentric climate governance’ system has 
emerged that incorporates bottom-up initiatives that can support and 
synergise with national efforts and international regimes (Ostrom 
2010). Although it is clear that many more actors and networks are 
involved, the effectiveness of a more polycentric system remains 
unclear (Jordan et al. 2015a). 
There is high confidence that a hybrid form of governance, combining 
the advantages of centralised governance (with coordination, 
stability, compliance) with those of more horizontal structures 
(that allow flexibility, autonomy for local decision-making, multi-
stakeholder engagement, co-management) is required for effective 
mainstreaming of mitigation and adaptation in sustainable land 
and forest management (Keenan 2015; Gupta 2014; Williamson and 
Nelson 2017; Liniger et al. 2019). Polycentric institutions self-
organise, developing collective solutions to local problems as 
they arise (Koontz et al. 2015). The public sector (governments 
and administrative systems) are still important in climate change 
initiatives as these actors retain the political will to implement and 
make initiatives work (Biesbroek et al. 2018).
Sustainable development hinges on the holistic integration of 
interconnected land and climate issues, sectors, levels of government, 
and policy instruments (Section 7.4.8) that address the increasing 
volatility in oscillating systems and weather patterns (Young 2017b; 
Kemp et al. 2005). Climate adaptation and mitigation goals must be 
integrated or mainstreamed into existing governance mechanisms 
around key land-use sectors such as forestry and agriculture. In the 
EU, mitigation has generally been well-mainstreamed in regional 
policies but not adaptation (Hanger et al. 2015). Climate change 
738

adaptation has been impeded by institutional barriers, including the 
inherent challenges of multi-level governance and policy integration 
(Biesbroek et al. 2010).
Integrative polycentric approaches to land use and climate 
interactions take different forms and operate with different 
institutions and governance mechanisms. Integrative approaches 
can provide coordination and linkages to improve effectiveness and 
efficiency and minimise conflicts (high confidence). Different types of 
integration with special relevance for the land–climate interface can 
be characterised as follows:
1. Cross-level integration: local and national level efforts must 
be coordinated with national and regional policies and also be 
capable of drawing direction and financing from global regimes, 
thus requiring multi-level governance. Integration of SLM to 
prevent, reduce and restore degraded land is advanced with 
national and subnational policy, including passing the necessary 
laws to establish frameworks and provide financial incentives. 
Examples include: integrated territorial planning addressing 
specific land-use decisions; local landscape participatory planning 
with farmer associations, microenterprises, and local institutions 
identifying hot spot areas, identifying land-use pressures and 
scaling out SLM response options (Liniger et al. 2019).
2. Cross-sectoral integration: rather than approach each 
application or sector (e.g., energy, agriculture, forestry) separately, 
there is a conscious effort at co-management and coordination 
in policies and institutions, such as with the energy–water–food 
nexus (Biggs et al. 2015).
3. End-use/market 
integration: often involves exploiting 
economies of scope across products, supply chains, and 
infrastructure (Nuhoff-Isakhanyan et al. 2016; Ashkenazy et al. 
2017). For instance, land-use transport models consider land 
use, transportation, city planning, and climate mitigation (Ford 
et al. 2018).
4. Landscape integration: rather than physical separation of 
activities (e.g., agriculture, forestry, grazing), uses are spatially 
integrated by exploiting natural variations while incorporating local 
and regional economies (Harvey et al. 2014a). In an assessment of 
166 initiatives in 16 countries, integrated landscape initiatives 
were found to address the drivers of agriculture, ecosystem 
conservation, 
livelihood 
preservation 
and 
institutional 
coordination. However, such initiatives struggled to move 
from planning to implementation due to lack of government 
and financial support, and powerful stakeholders sidelining 
the agenda (Zanzanaini et al. 2017). Special care helps ensure 
that initiatives don’t exacerbate socio-spatial inequalities 
across diverse developmental and environmental conditions 
(Anguelovski et al. 2016b). Integrated land-use planning, 
coordinated through multiple government levels, balances 
property rights, wildlife and forest conservation, encroachment 
of settlements and agricultural areas and can reduce conflict 
(high confidence) (Metternicht 2018). Land-use planning can also 
enhance management of areas prone to natural disasters, such 
as floods, and resolve issues of competing land uses and land 
tenure conflicts (Metternicht 2018).
Another way to analyse or characterise governance approaches or 
mechanisms might be according to a temporal scale with respect to 
relevant events – for example, those that may occur gradually versus 
abruptly (Cash et al. 2006). Desertification and land degradation are 
drawn-out processes that occur over many years, whereas extreme 
events are abrupt and require immediate attention. Similarly, the 
frequency of events might be of special interest – for example, events 
that occur periodically versus those that occur infrequently and/or 
irregularly. In the case of food security, abrupt and protracted events 
of food insecurity might occur. There is a distinction between ‘hunger 
months’ and longer-term food insecurity. Some indigenous practices 
already incorporate hunger months whereas structural food deficits 
have to be addressed differently (Bacon et al. 2014). Governance 
mechanisms that facilitate rapid response to crises are quite different 
from those aimed at monitoring slower changes and responding with 
longer-term measures.
Case study |  Governance: Biofuels and bioenergy
New policies and initiatives during the past decade or so have increased support for bioenergy as a non-intermittent (stored) renewable 
with wide geographic availability that is cost-effective in a range of applications. Significant upscaling of bioenergy requires dedicated 
(normally land-based) sources in addition to use of wastes and residues. As a result, a disadvantageous high land-use intensity compared 
to other renewables (Fritsche et al. 2017) that, in turn, place greater demands on governance. Bioenergy, especially traditional fuels, 
currently provides the largest share of renewable energy globally and has a significant role in nearly all climate stabilisation scenarios, 
although estimates of its potential vary widely (see Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 6). Policies and governance for bioenergy systems 
and markets must address diverse applications and sectors across levels from local to global; here we briefly review the literature in 
relation to governance for modern bioenergy and biofuels with respect to land and climate impacts, whereas traditional biomass use 
(see Glossary) (> 50% of energy used today with greater land use and GHG emissions impacts in low- and medium-income countries 
(Bailis et al. 2015; Masera et al. 2015; Bailis et al. 2017a; Kiruki et al. 2017b)) is addressed elsewhere (Sections 4.5.4 and 7.4.6.4 and 
Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 7). The bioenergy lifecycle is relevant in accounting for – and attributing – land impacts and GHG 
emissions (Section 2.5.1.5). Integrated responses across different sectors can help to reduce negative impacts and promote sustainable 
development opportunities (Table 6.9, Table 6.58, Chapter 6).

Case study (continued)
It is very likely that bioenergy expansion at a scale that contributes significantly to global climate mitigation efforts (see Cross-Chapter 
Box 7 in Chapter 6) will result in substantial land-use change (Berndes et al. 2015; Popp et al. 2014a; Wilson et al. 2014; Behrman et al. 
2015; Richards et al. 2017; Harris et al. 2015; Chen et al. 2017a). There is medium evidence and high agreement that land-use change 
at such scale presents a variety of positive and negative socio-economic and environmental impacts that lead to risks and trade-offs 
that must be managed or governed across different levels (Pahl-Wostl et al. 2018a; Kurian 2017; Franz et al. 2017; Chang et al. 2016; 
Larcom and van Gevelt 2017; Lubis et al. 2018; Alexander et al. 2015b; Rasul 2014; Bonsch et al. 2016; Karabulut et al. 2018; Mayor et 
al. 2015). There is medium evidence and high agreement that impacts vary considerably according to factors such as initial land-use 
type, choice of crops, initial carbon stocks, climatic region, soil types and the management regime and adopted technologies (Qin et 
al. 2016; Del Grosso et al. 2014; Popp et al. 2017; Davis et al. 2013; Mello et al. 2014; Hudiburg et al. 2015; Carvalho et al. 2016; Silva-
Olaya et al. 2017;  Whitaker et al. 2018; Alexander et al. 2015b).
There is medium evidence and high agreement that significant socio-economic impacts requiring additional policy responses can occur 
when agricultural lands and/or food crops are used for bioenergy, due to competition between food and fuel (Harvey and Pilgrim 2011; 
Rosillo Callé and Johnson 2010b), including impacts on food prices (Martin Persson 2015; Roberts and Schlenker 2013; Borychowski 
and Czyżewski 2015; Koizumi 2014; Muratori et al. 2016; Popp et al. 2014b; Araujo Enciso et al. 2016) and impacts on food security 
(Popp et al. 2014b; Bailey 2013; Pahl-Wostl et al. 2018b; Rulli et al. 2016; Yamagata et al. 2018; Kline et al. 2017; Schröder et al. 2018; 
Franz et al. 2017; Mohr et al. 2016). Additionally, crops such as sugarcane, which are water-intensive when used for ethanol production, 
have a trade-off with water and downstream ES and other crops more important for food security (Rulli et al. 2016; Gheewala et 
al. 2011). Alongside negative impacts that might fall on urban consumers (who purchase both food and energy), there is medium 
evidence and medium agreement that rural producers or farmers can increase income or strengthen livelihoods by diversifying into 
biofuel crops that have an established market (Maltsoglou et al. 2014; Mudombi et al. 2018a; Gasparatos et al. 2018a,b,c; von Maltitz 
et al. 2018; Kline et al. 2017; Rodríguez Morales and Rodríguez López 2017; Dale et al. 2015; Lee and Lazarus 2013; Rodríguez-Morales 
2018). A key governance mechanism that has emerged in response to such concerns, (especially during the past decade) are standards 
and certification systems that include food security and land rights in addition to general criteria or indicators related to sustainable 
use of land and biomass (Section 7.4.6.3). There is medium evidence and medium agreement that policies promoting use of wastes 
and residues, use of non-edible crops and/or reliance on degraded and marginal lands for bioenergy could reduce land competition 
and associated risk for food security (Manning et al. 2015; Maltsoglou et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2018a; Gu and Wylie 2017; Kline et al. 
2017; Schröder et al. 2018; Suckall et al. 2015; Popp et al. 2014a; Lal 2013).
There is medium evidence and high agreement that good governance, including policy coherence and coordination across the different 
sectors involved (agriculture, forestry, livestock, energy, transport) (Section 7.6.2) can help to reduce the risks and increase the co-
benefits of bioenergy expansion (Makkonen et al. 2015; Di Gregorio et al. 2017; Schut et al. 2013; Mukhtarov et al.; Torvanger 2019a; 
Müller et al. 2015; Nkonya et al. 2015; Johnson and Silveira 2014; Lundmark et al. 2014; Schultz et al. 2015; Silveira and Johnson 
2016; Giessen et al. 2016b; Stattman et al. 2018b; Bennich et al. 2017b). There is medium evidence and high agreement that the 
nexus approach can help to address interconnected biomass resource management challenges and entrenched economic interests, 
and leverage synergies in the systemic governance of risk. (Bizikova et al. 2013; Rouillard et al. 2017; Pahl-Wostl 2017a; Lele et al. 
2013; Rodríguez Morales and Rodríguez López 2017; Larcom and van Gevelt 2017; Pahl-Wostl et al. 2018a; Rulli et al. 2016; Rasul and 
Sharma 2016; Weitz et al. 2017b; Karlberg et al. 2015). 
A key issue for governance of biofuels and bioenergy, as well as land-use governance more generally, during the past decade is 
the need for new governance mechanisms across different levels as land-use policies and bioenergy investments are scaled up and 
result in wider impacts (Section 7.6). There is low evidence and medium agreement that hybrid governance mechanisms can promote 
sustainable bioenergy investments and land-use pathways. This hybrid governance can include multi-level, transnational governance, 
and private-led or partnership-style (polycentric) governance, complementing national-level, strong public coordination (government 
and public administration) (Section 7.6.2) (Pahl-Wostl 2017a; Pacheco et al. 2016; Winickoff and Mondou 2017; Nagendra and Ostrom 
2012; Jordan et al. 2015a; Djalante et al. 2013; Purkus, A, Gawel, E. and Thrän, D. 2012; Purkus et al. 2018; Stattman et al.; Rietig 2018; 
Cavicchi et al. 2017; Stupak et al. 2016; Stupak and Raulund-Rasmussen 2016; Westberg and Johnson 2013; Giessen et al. 2016b;

Introduction and significance
Most biomass used for energy today is in traditional forms (fuelwood, charcoal, agricultural residues) for cooking and heating by 
some 3 billion people worldwide (IEA 2017). Traditional biomass has high land and climate impacts, with significant harvesting losses, 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, soil impacts and high conversion losses (Cutz et al. 2017b; Masera et al. 2015; Ghilardi et al. 2016a; 
Bailis et al. 2015; Fritsche et al. 2017; Mudombi et al. 2018b). In addition to these impacts, indoor air pollution from household cooking 
is a leading cause of mortality in low- and medium-income countries and especially affects women and children (Smith et al. 2014a; 
HEI/IHME 2018; Goldemberg et al. 2018b). In rural areas, the significant time needed for gathering fuelwood imposes further costs on 
women and children (Njenga and Mendum 2018; Gurung and Oh 2013a; Behera et al. 2015a).
Both agricultural and woody biomass can be upgraded and used sustainably through improved resource management and modern 
conversion technologies, providing much greater energy output per unit of biomass (Cutz et al. 2017b; Hoffmann et al. 2015a; Gurung 
and Oh 2013b). More relevant than technical efficiency is the improved quality of energy services: with increasing income levels 
and/or access to technologies, households transition over time from agricultural residues and fuelwood to charcoal and then to 
gaseous or liquid fuels and electricity (Leach 1992; Pachauri and Jiang 2008; Goldemberg and Teixeira Coelho 2004; Smeets et al. 
2012a). However, most households use multiple stoves and/or fuels at the same time, known as ‘fuel stacking’ for economic flexibility 
and also for socio-cultural reasons (Ruiz-Mercado and Masera 2015a; Cheng and Urpelainen 2014; Takama et al. 2012). 
Urban and rural use of traditional biomass
In rural areas, fuelwood is often gathered at no cost to the user, and burned directly whereas, in urban areas, traditional biomass 
use may often involve semi-processed fuels, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa where charcoal is the primary urban cooking fuel. 
Rapid urbanisation and/or commercialisation drives a shift from fuelwood to charcoal, which results in significantly higher wood use 
(very high confidence) due to losses in charcoal supply chains and the tendency to use whole trees for charcoal production (Santos 
et al. 2017; World Bank. 2009a; Hojas-Gascon et al. 2016a; Smeets et al. 2012b). One study in Myanmar found that charcoal required 
23 times the land area of fuelwood (Win et al. 2018). In areas of woody biomass scarcity, animal dung and agricultural residues, as 
well as lower-quality wood, are often used (Kumar Nath et al. 2013a; Go et al. 2019a; Jagger and Kittner 2017; Behera et al. 2015b). 
The fraction of woody biomass harvested that is not ‘demonstrably renewable’ is the fraction of non-renewable biomass (fNRB) under 
UNFCCC accounting; default values for fNRB for least-developed countries and small island developing states ranged from 40–100% 
(CDM Executive Board 2012). Uncertainties in woodfuel data, complexities in spatiotemporal woodfuel modelling and rapid forest 
regrowth in some tropical regions present sources of variation in such estimates, and some fNRB values are likely to have been 
overestimated (McNicol et al. 2018a; Ghilardi et al. 2016b; Bailis et al. 2017b).
GHG emissions and traditional biomass
Due to over-harvesting, incomplete combustion and the effects of short-lived climate pollutants, traditional woodfuels (fuelwood and 
charcoal) contribute 1.9–2.3% of global GHG emissions; non-renewable biomass is concentrated especially in ‘hotspot’ regions of East 
Africa and South Asia (Bailis et al. 2015). The estimate only includes woody biomass and does not account for possible losses in soil 
carbon or the effects of nutrient losses from use of animal dung, which can be significant in some cases (Duguma et al. 2014a; Achat 
et al. 2015a; Sánchez et al. 2016). Reducing emissions of black carbon alongside GHG reductions offers immediate health co-benefits 
(Shindell et al. 2012; Pandey et al. 2017; Weyant et al. 2019a; Sparrevik et al. 2015). Significant GHG emissions reductions, depending 
on baseline or reference use, can be obtained through fuel-switching to gaseous and liquid fuels, sustainable harvesting of woodfuels, 
upgrading to efficient stoves, and adopting high-quality processed fuels such as wood pellets (medium evidence, high agreement) 
(Wathore et al. 2017; Jagger and Das 2018; Quinn et al. 2018; Cutz et al. 2017b; Carter et al. 2018; Bailis et al. 2015; Ghilardi et al. 
2018; Weyant et al. 2019b; Hoffmann et al. 2015b). 
Land and forest degradation 
Land degradation is itself a significant source of GHG emissions and biodiversity loss, with over-harvesting of woodfuel as a major 
cause in some regions and especially in Sub-Saharan Africa (Pearson et al. 2017; Joana Specht et al. 2015a; Kiruki et al. 2017b; 
Ndegwa et al. 2016; McNicol et al. 2018b). Reliance on traditional biomass is quite land-intensive: supplying one household 
sustainably for a year can require more than half a hectare of land, which, in dryland countries such as Kenya, can result in substantial 
percentage of total tree cover (Fuso Nerini et al. 2017). In Sub-Saharan Africa and in some other regions, land degradation is widely 
associated with charcoal production (high confidence), often in combination with timber harvesting or clearing land for agriculture

Cross-Chapter Box 12 (continued)
(Kiruki et al. 2017a; Ndegwa et al. 2016; Hojas-Gascon et al. 2016b). Yet charcoal makes a significant contribution to livelihoods in 
many areas and thus, in spite of the ecological damage, halting charcoal production is difficult due to the lack of alternative livelihoods 
and/or the affordability of other fuels (Smith et al. 2015; Zulu and Richardson 2013a; Jones et al. 2016a; World Bank 2009b). 
Use of agricultural residues and animal dung for bioenergy
Although agricultural wastes and residues from almost any crop can be used in many cases for bioenergy, excessive removal or reduction 
of forest (or agricultural) biomass can contribute to a loss of soil carbon, which can also, in turn, contribute to land degradation (James 
et al. 2016; Blanco-Canqui and Lal 2009a; Carvalho et al. 2016; Achat et al. 2015b; Stavi and Lal 2015). Removals are limited to levels 
at which problems of soil erosion, depletion of soil organic matter, soil nutrient depletion and decline in crop yield are effectively 
mitigated (Ayamga et al. 2015a; Baudron et al. 2014; Blanco-Canqui and Lal 2009b). Application or recycling of residues may, in 
some cases, be more valuable for soil improvement (medium confidence). Tao et al. (2017) used leftover oil palm fruit bunches and 
demonstrated that application of 30 to 90 t ha–1 empty fruit bunches maintains high palm oil yield with low temporal variability. 
A wide variety of wastes from palm oil harvesting can be used for bioenergy, including annual crop residues (Go et al. 2019b; Ayamga 
et al. 2015b; Gardner et al. 2018b). 
Animal dung is a low-quality fuel used where woody biomass is scarce, such as in South Asia and some areas of eastern Africa 
(Duguma et al. 2014b; Behera et al. 2015b; Kumar Nath et al. 2013b). Carbon and nutrient losses can be significant when animal dung 
is dried and burned as cake, whereas using dung in a biodigester provides high-quality fuel and preserves nutrients in the by-product 
slurry (Clemens et al. 2018; Gurung and Oh 2013b; Quinn et al. 2018).
Production and use of biochar
Converting agricultural residues into biochar can also help to reverse trends of soil degradation (Section 4.10.7). The positive effects of 
using biochar have been demonstrated in terms of soil aggregate improvement, increase of exchangeable cations, cation exchange 
capacity, available phosphorus, soil pH and carbon sequestration as well as increased crop yields (Huang et al. 2018; El-Naggar et 
al. 2018; Wang et al. 2018; Oladele et al. 2019; Blanco-Canqui and Lal 2009b). The level of biochar effectiveness varies depending on 
the kind of feedstock, soil properties and rate of application (Shaaban et al. 2018; Pokharel and Chang 2019). In addition to adding 
value to an energy product, the use of biochar offers a climate-smart approach to addressing agricultural productivity (Solomon and 
Lehmann 2017).
Relationship to food security and other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
The population that is food insecure also intersects significantly with those relying heavily on traditional biomass such that poor and 
vulnerable populations often expend considerable time (gathering fuel) or use a significant share of household income for low-quality 
energy services (Fuso Nerini et al. 2017; McCollum et al. 2018; Rao and Pachauri 2017; Pachauri et al. 2018; Muller and Yan 2018; 
Takama et al. 2012). Improvements in energy access and reduction or elimination of traditional biomass use thus have benefits across 
multiple SDGs (medium evidence, high agreement) (Masera et al. 2015; Rao and Pachauri 2017; Pachauri et al. 2018; Hoffmann et al. 
2017; Jeuland et al. 2015; Takama et al. 2012; Gitau et al. 2019; Quinn et al. 2018; Ruiz-Mercado and Masera 2015b; Duguma et al. 
2014b; Sola et al. 2016b). Improved energy access contributes to adaptive capacity, although charcoal production itself can also serve 
as a diversification or adaptation strategy (Perera et al. 2015; Ochieng et al. 2014; Sumiya 2016; Suckall et al. 2015; Jones et al. 2016b). 
Socio-economic choices and shifts
When confronted with the limitations of higher-priced household energy alternatives, climate mitigation policies can result in trade-
offs with health, energy access and other SDGs (Cameron et al. 2016; Fuso Nerini et al. 2018). The poorest households have no 
margin to pay for higher-cost efficient stoves; a focus on product-specific characteristics, user needs and/or making clean options more 
available would improve the market take-up (medium confidence) (Takama et al. 2012; Mudombi et al. 2018c; Khandelwal et al. 2017; 
Rosenthal et al. 2017; Cundale et al. 2017; Jürisoo et al. 2018). Subsidies for more efficient end-use technologies, in combination with 
promotion of sustainable harvesting techniques, would provide the highest emissions reductions while improving energy services 
(Cutz et al. 2017a).
Knowledge gaps
Unlike analyses on modern energy sources, scientific assessments on traditional biomass use are complicated by its informal 
nature and the difficulty of tracing data and impacts; more systematic analytical efforts are needed to address this research gap

7.6.3 
Adaptive climate governance 
responding to uncertainty
In the 1990s, adaptive governance emerged from adaptive management 
(Holling 1978, 1986), combining resilience and complexity theory, 
and reflecting the trend of moving from government to governance 
(Hurlbert 2018b). Adaptive governance builds on multi-level and 
polycentric governance. Adaptive governance is ‘a process of resolving 
trade-offs and charting a course for sustainability’ (Boyle et al. 2001, 
p. 28) through a range of ‘political, social, economic and administrative 
systems that develop, manage and distribute a resource in a manner 
promoting resilience through collaborative, flexible and learning-based 
issue management across different scales’ (Hurlbert 2018, p. 25). There 
is medium evidence and medium agreement that few alternative 
governance theories handle processes of change characterised 
by nonlinear dynamics, threshold effects, cascades and limited 
predictability; however, the majority of literature relates to the USA or 
Canada (Karpouzoglou et al. 2016). Combining adaptive governance 
with other theories has allowed good evaluation of important 
governance features such as power and politics, inclusion and equity, 
short-term and long-term change, and the relationship between public 
policy and adaptive governance (Karpouzoglou et al. 2016).
There is robust evidence and high agreement that resource and 
disaster crises are crises of governance (Pahl-Wostl 2017b; Villagra 
and Quintana 2017; Gupta et al. 2013b). Adaptive governance of risk 
has emerged in response to these crises and involves four critical 
pillars (Fra.Paleo 2015):
1. Sustainability as a response to environmental degradation, 
resource depletion and ES deterioration 
2. Recognition that governance is required as government is unable 
to resolve key societal and environmental problems, including 
climate change and complex problems 
3. Mitigation as a means to reduce vulnerability and avoid exposure
4. Adaptation responds to changes in environmental conditions.
Closely related to (and arguably components of) adaptive governance 
are adaptive management (Section 7.5.4) (a regulatory environment 
that manages ecological system boundaries through hypothesis 
testing, monitoring, and re-evaluation (Mostert et al. 2007)), adaptive 
co-management (flexible community-based resource management 
(Plummer and Baird 2013)), and anticipatory governance (flexible 
decision-making through the use of scenario planning and reiterative 
policy review (Boyd et al. 2015)). Adaptive governance can be 
conceptualised as including multilevel governance with a balance 
between top-down and bottom-up decision-making that is performed 
by many actors (including citizens) in both formal and informal 
networks, allowing policy measures and governance arrangements 
to be tailored to local context and matched at the appropriate scale 
of the problem, allowing for opportunities for experimentation and 
learning by individuals and social groups (Rouillard et al. 2013; 
Hurlbert 2018b).
There is high confidence that anticipation is a key component of 
adaptive climate governance wherein steering mechanisms in the 
present are developed to adapt to and/or shape uncertain futures 
(Vervoort and Gupta 2018; Wiebe et al. 2018; Fuerth 2009). Effecting 
this anticipatory governance involves simultaneously making 
short-term decisions in the context of longer-term policy visioning, 
anticipating future climate change models and scenarios in order 
to realise a more sustainable future (Bates and Saint-Pierre 2018; 
Serrao-Neumann et al. 2013; Boyd et al. 2015). Utilising the decision-
making tools and practices in Section 7.5, policymakers operationalise 
anticipatory governance through a foresight system considering 
future scenarios and models, a networked system for integrating 
this knowledge into the policy process, a feedback system using 
indicators (Section  7.5.5) to gauge performance, an open-minded 
institutional culture allowing for hybrid and polycentric governance 
(Fuerth and Faber 2013; Fuerth 2009). 
There is high confidence that, in order to manage uncertainty, natural 
resource governance systems need to allow agencies and stakeholders 
to learn and change over time, responding to ecosystem changes and 
new information with different management strategies and practices 
that involve experimentation (Camacho 2009; Young 2017b). There is 
emerging literature on experimentation in governance surrounding 
climate change and land use (Kivimaa et al. 2017a) including policies 
such as REDD+ (Kaisa et al. 2017). Governance experiment literature 
could be in relation to scaling up policies from the local level for 
greater application, or downscaling policies addressing broad complex 
issues such as climate change, or addressing necessary change in social 
processes across sectors (such as water energy and food) (Laakso et al. 
2017). Successful development of new policy instruments occurred in 
a governance experiment relating to coastal policy adapting to rising 
sea levels and extreme weather events through planned retreat (Rocle 
and Salles 2018). Experiments in emissions trading between 1968 
and 2000 in the USA helped to realise specific models of governance 
and material practices through mutually supportive lab experiments 
and field applications that advanced collective knowledge (Voß and 
Simons 2018).
Cross-Chapter Box 12 (continued)
(Cerutti et al. 2015). In general, traditional biomass use is associated with poverty. Therefore, efforts to reduce the dependence 
on fuelwood use are to be conducted in coherence with poverty alleviation (McCollum et al. 2018; Joana Specht et al. 2015b; 
Zulu  and  Richardson 2013b). The substantial potential co-benefits suggest that the traditional biomass sector remains under-
researched and under-exploited in terms of cost-effective emissions reductions, as well as for synergies between climate stabilisation 
goals and other SDGs.

There is high confidence that an SLM plan is dynamic and adaptive 
over time to (unforeseen) future conditions by monitoring indicators 
as early warnings or signals of tipping points, initiating a process 
of change in policy pathway before a harmful threshold is reached 
(Stephens et al. 2018, 2017; Haasnoot et al. 2013; Bloemen et al. 
2018) (Section 7.5.2.2). This process has been applied in relation to 
coastal sea level rise, starting with low-risk, low-cost measures and 
working up to measures requiring greater investment after review 
and reevaluation (Barnett et al. 2014). A first measure was stringent 
controls of new development, graduating to managed relocation 
of low-lying critical infrastructure, and eventually movement of 
habitable dwellings to more elevated parts of town, as flooding and 
inundation triggers are experienced (Haasnoot et al. 2018; Lawrence 
et al. 2018; Barnett et al. 2014; Stephens et al. 2018). Nanda et al. 
(2018) apply the concept to a wetland in Australia to identify a mix 
of short- and long-term decisions, and Prober et al. (2017) develop 
adaptation pathways for agricultural landscapes, also in Australia. 
Both studies identify that longer-term decisions may involve 
a  considerable change to institutional arrangements at different 
scales. Viewing climate mitigation as a series of connected decisions 
over a long time period and not an isolated decision, reduces the 
fragmentation and uncertainty endemic of models and effectiveness 
of policy measures (Roelich and Giesekam 2019).
There is medium evidence and high agreement that participatory 
processes in adaptive governance within and across policy regimes 
overcome limitations of polycentric governance, allowing priorities to 
be set in sustainable development through rural land management and 
integrated water resource management (Rouillard et al. 2013). Adaptive 
governance addresses large uncertainties and their social amplification 
through differing perceptions of risk (Kasperson 2012; Fra.Paleo 2015) 
offering an approach to co-evolve with risk by implementing policy 
mixes and assessing effectiveness in an ongoing process, making 
mid-point corrections when necessary (Fra.Paleo 2015). In respect of 
climate adaptation to coastal and riverine land erosion due to extreme 
weather events impacting on communities, adaptive governance offers 
the capacity to monitor local socio-economic processes and implement 
dynamic locally informed institutional responses. In Alaska, adaptive 
governance responded to the dynamic risk of extreme weather events 
and issue of climate migration by providing a continuum of policy from 
protection in place to community relocation, integrating across levels 
and actors in a more effective and less costly response option than 
other governance systems (Bronen and Chapin 2013). In comparison 
to other governance initiatives of ecosystem management aimed at 
conservation and sustainable use of natural capital, adaptive governance 
has visible effects on natural capital by monitoring, communicating and 
responding to ecosystem-wide changes at the landscape level (Schultz 
et al. 2015). Adaptive governance can be applied to manage drought 
assistance as a common property resource. Adaptive governance can 
manage complex, interacting goals to create innovative policy options, 
facilitated through nested and polycentric systems of governance, 
effected by watershed or catchment management groups in areas of 
natural resource management (Nelson et al. 2008).
There is medium evidence and high agreement that transformational 
change is a necessary societal response option to manage climate 
risks which is uniquely characterised by the depth of change needed 
to reframe problems and change dominant mindsets, the scope of 
change needed (that is larger than just a few people) and the speed 
of change required to reduce emissions (O’Brien et al. 2012; Termeer 
et al. 2017). Transformation of governance occurs with changes in 
values to reflect an understanding that the environmental crisis 
occurs in the context of our relation with the earth (Hordijk et al. 
2014; Pelling 2010). Transformation can happen by intervention 
strategies that enable small in-depth wins, amplify these small wins 
through integration into existing practices, and unblock stagnations 
(locked in structures) preventing transformation by confronting social 
and cognitive fixations with counterintuitive interventions (Termeer 
et al. 2017). Iterative consideration of issues and reformulation of 
policy instruments and response options facilitates transformation by 
allowing experimentation (Monkelbaan 2019).
Box 7.2 |  Adaptive governance and interlinkages of food, fibre, water, energy and land
Emerging literature and case studies recognise the connectedness of the environment and human activities, and the interrelationships 
of multiple resource-use practices in an attempt to understand synergies and trade-offs (Albrecht et al. 2018). Sustainable adaptation – 
or actions contributing to environmentally and socially sustainable development pathways (Eriksen et al. 2011) – requires consideration 
of the interlinkage of different sectors (Rasul and Sharma 2016). Integrating considerations can address sustainability (Hoff 2011) 
showing promise (Allan et al. 2015) for effective adaptation to climate impacts in many drylands (Rasul and Sharma 2016).
Case studies of integrated water resources management (IWRM), landscape- and ecosystem-based approaches illustrate important 
dimensions of institutions, institutional coordination, resource coupling and local and global connections (Scott et al. 2011). Integrated 
governance, policy coherence, and use of multi-functional systems are required to advance synergies across land, water, energy and 
food sectors (Liu et al. 2017). 
Case study: Flood and food security
Between 2003 and 2013, floods were the natural disaster that most impacted on crop production (FAO 2015b) (albeit in certain 
contexts, such as riverine ecosystems and flood plain communities, floods can be beneficial). 
744

Box 7.2 (continued)
In developing countries, flood jeopardises primary access to food and impacts on livelihoods. In Bangladesh, the 2007 flood reduced 
average consumption by 103Kcal/cap/day (worsening the existing 19.4% calories deficit), and in Pakistan, the 2010 flood resulted in 
a loss of 205 Kcal/cap/day (or 8.5% of the Pakistan average food supply). The 2010 flood affected more than 4.5 million workers, two-
thirds employed in agriculture; and 79% of farms lost greater than one-half of their expected income (Pacetti et al. 2017).
Policy instruments and responses react to the sequential and cascading impacts of flood. In a Malawi study, flood impacts 
cascaded  through labour, trade and transfer systems. First a harvest failure occurred, followed by the decline of employment 
opportunities and reduction in real wages, followed by a market failure or decline in trade, ultimately followed by a failure in informal 
safety nets (Devereux 2007). Planned policy responses include those that address the sequential nature of the cascading impacts, 
starting with ‘productivity-enhancing safety nets’ addressing harvest failure, then public works programmes addressing the decline in 
employment opportunities, followed by food price subsidies to address the market failure, and finally food aid to address the failure 
of informal safety nets (Devereux 2007). In another example in East Africa’s range lands, flood halted livestock sales, food prices 
fell, and grain production ceased. Local food shortages couldn’t be supplemented with imports due to destruction of transport links, 
and pastoral incomes were inadequate to purchase food. Livestock diseases became rampant and eventually food shortages led to 
escalating prices. Due to the contextual nature and timing of events, policy responses initially addressed mobility and resource access, 
and eventually longer-term issues such as livestock disease (Little et al. 2001).
In North America, floods are often described in terms of costs. For instance, the 1997 Red River Basin flood cost Manitoba, Canada 
1 billion USD and the USA 4 billion USD in terms of impact on agriculture and food production (Adaptation to Climate Change Team 
2013). In Canada, floods accounted for 82% of disaster financial assistance spent from 2005–2014 (Public Safety Canada 2017) 
and this cost may increase in the future. Future climate change may result in a 2 meter in sea level by 2100, costing from 507 to 
882 billion USD, affecting 300 American cities (losing one-half of their homes) and the wholesale loss of 36 cities (Lemann 2018).
Policy measures are important as an increasingly warming world may make post-disaster assistance and insurance increasingly 
unaffordable (Surminski et al. 2016). Historic legal mechanisms for retreating from low-lying and coastal areas have failed to 
encourage relocation of people out of flood plains and areas of high risk (Stoa 2015). In some places, cheap flood insurance and 
massive aid programmes have encouraged the populating of low-lying flood-prone and coastal areas (Lemann 2018). Although 
the state makes disaster assistance payments, it is local governments that determine vulnerability through flood zone mapping, 
restrictions from building in flood zones, building requirements (Stoa 2015), and integrated planning for flood. A comprehensive policy 
mix (Section 7.4.8) (implemented through adaptive management as illustrated in Figure 7.6) reduces vulnerability (Hurlbert 2018a,b). 
Policy mixes that allow people to respond to disasters include bankruptcy, insolvency rules, house protected from creditors, income 
minimums, and basic agricultural implement protection laws. The portfolio of policies allows people to recover and, if necessary, 
migrate to other areas and occupations (Hurlbert 2018b). 
At the international level, reactionary disaster response has evolved to proactive risk management that combines adaptation 
and mitigation responses to ensure effective risk response, build resilient systems and solve issues of structural social inequality 
(Innocenti and Albrito 2011). Advanced measures of preparedness are the main instruments to reduce fatalities and limit damage, 
as illustrated in Figure 7.8. The Sendai Declaration (Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030), is an action plan to 
reduce mortality, the number of affected people and economic losses, using four priorities: understanding disaster risk; strengthening 
its governance to enhance the ability to manage disaster risk; investing in resilience; and enhancing disaster preparedness. There is 
medium evidence and high agreement that the Sendai Declaration significantly refers to adaptive governance and could be a window 
of opportunity to transform disaster risk reduction to address the causes of vulnerability (Munene et al. 2018). Addressing disasters 
increasingly requires individual, household, community and national planning and commitment to a new path of resilience and 
shared responsibility through whole community engagement and linking private and public infrastructure interests (Rouillard et al. 
2013). It is recommended that a vision and overarching framework of governance be adopted to allow participation and coordination 
by government, NGOs, researchers and the private sector, individuals in the neighbourhood community. Disaster risk response is 
enhanced with complementary structural and non-structural measures, implemented together with measurable scorecard indicators 
(Chen 2011).

7.6.4 
Participation
It is recognised that more benefits are derived when citizens actively 
participate in land and climate decision-making, conservation, 
and policy formation (high confidence) (Jansujwicz et al. 2013; 
Coenen and Coenen 2009; Hurlbert and Gupta 2015). Local leaders 
supported by strong laws, institutions, and collaborative platforms, 
are able to draw on local knowledge, challenge external scientists, 
and find transparent and effective solutions for climate and land 
conflicts (Couvet and Prevot 2015; Johnson et al. 2017). Meaningful 
participation is more than providing technical/scientific information 
to citizens in order to accept decisions already made – rather, it 
allows citizens to deliberate about climate change impacts to 
determine shared responsibilities, creating genuine opportunity to 
construct, discuss and promote alternatives (high confidence) (Lee et 
al. 2013; Armeni 2016; Pieraccini 2015; Serrao-Neumann et al. 2015b; 
Armeni 2016). Participation is an emerging quality of collective 
action and social learning processes (Castella et al. 2014) when 
barriers for meaningful participation are surpassed (Clemens et al. 
2015). The absence of systematic leadership, the lack of consensus 
on the place of direct citizen participation, and the limited scope and 
powers of participatory innovations, limits the utility of participation 
(Fung 2015). 
Multiple methods of participation exist, including multi-stakeholder 
forums, participatory scenario analyses, public forums and citizen 
juries (Coenen and Coenen 2009). No one method is superior, but 
each method must be tailored for local context (high confidence) 
(Blue and Medlock 2014; Voß and Amelung 2016). Strategic 
innovation in developing policy initiatives requires a strategic 
adaptation framework involving pluralistic and adaptive processes 
and use of boundary organisations (Head 2014). 
The framing of a land and climate issue can influence the manner of 
public engagement (Hurlbert and Gupta 2015) and studies have found 
that local frames of climate change are particularly important (Hornsey

Adaptive management identifies and responds to exposure and vulnerability to land and climate change impacts by identifying 
problems and objectives, making decisions in relation to response options, and instruments advancing response options in the context 
of uncertainty. These decisions are continuously monitored, evaluated and adjusted to changing conditions. Similarly disaster risk 
management responds to hazards through preparation, prevention, response, analysis, and reconstruction in an iterative process.

et al. 2016; Spence et al. 2012), emphasising diversity of perceptions 
to adaptation and mitigation options (Capstick et al. 2015) – although 
Singh and Swanson (2017) found little evidence that framing impacted 
on the perceived importance of climate change. 
Recognition and use of indigenous and local knowledge (ILK) 
is an important element of participatory approaches of various 
kinds. ILK can be used in decision-making on climate change 
adaptation, SLM and food security at various scales and levels, and 
is important for long-term sustainability (high confidence). Cross-
Chapter Box 13 discusses definitional issues associated with ILK, 
evidence of its usefulness in responses to land-climate challenges, 
constraints on its use, and possibilities for its incorporation in 
decision-making.

(The United States of America), Marta Rivera Ferre (Spain), Lindsay Stringer (United Kingdom).
Indigenous and local knowledge (ILK) can play a key role in climate change adaptation (high confidence) (Mapfumo et al. 2017; 
Nyong et al. 2007; Green and Raygorodetsky 2010; Speranza et al. 2010; Alexander et al. 2011; Leonard et al. 2013; Nakashima et al. 
2013; Tschakert 2007). The Summary for Policymakers of the Contribution of Working Group II to the Fifth Assessment Report of the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2014b, p. 26) states that ‘Indigenous, local, and traditional knowledge systems and 
practices, including indigenous peoples’ holistic view of community and environment, are a major resource for adapting to climate 
change, but these have not been used consistently in existing adaptation efforts. Integrating such forms of knowledge with existing 
practices increases the effectiveness of adaptation’ (see also Ford et al. 2016). The IPCC’s Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C 
(SR15) (IPCC 2018a; de Coninck et al. 2018) confirms the effectiveness and potential feasibility of adaptation options based on ILK, 
but also raises concerns that such knowledge systems are being threatened by multiple socio-economic and environmental drivers 
(high confidence). The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) Land Degradation 
and Restoration Assessment (IPBES 2018) finds the same – that ILK can support adaptation to land degradation, but is threatened. 
A variety of terminology has been used to describe ILK: indigenous knowledge, local knowledge, traditional knowledge, 
traditional ecological knowledge, and other terms are used in overlapping and often inconsistent ways (Naess 2013). SR15 (IPCC 
2018a) reserves ‘indigenous knowledge’ for culturally distinctive ways of knowing associated with ‘societies with long histories of 
interaction with their natural surroundings’, while using ‘local knowledge’ for ‘understandings and skills developed by individuals and 
populations, specific to the places where they live’, but not all research studies observe this distinction. This Special Report generally 
uses ILK as a combined term for these forms of knowledge, but in some sections the terminology used follows that from the research 
literature assessed.
In contrast to scientific knowledge, ILK is context-specific, collective, transmitted informally, and is multi-functional (Mistry and Berardi 
2016; Naess 2013; Janif et al. 2016). Persson et al. (2018) characterise ILK as ‘practical experience’, as locally held knowledges are 
acquired through processes of experience and interaction with the surrounding physical world. ILK is embedded in local institutions 
(Naess 2013) and in cultural aspects of landscape and food systems (Fuller and Qingwen 2013; Koohafkan and Altieri 2011). ILK 
can encompass such diverse content as factual information about the environment, guidance on rights and management, value 
statements about interactions with others, and cosmologies and worldviews that influence how information is perceived and acted 
on, among other topics (Spoon 2014; Usher 2000).
This cross-chapter box assesses evidence for the positive role of ILK in understanding climate change and other environmental 
processes, and in managing land sustainably in the face of climate change, desertification, land degradation and food insecurity. 
It also assesses constraints on and threats to the use of ILK in these challenges, and processes by which ILK can be incorporated 
in decision-making and governance processes.
ILK in understanding and responding to climate change impacts
ILK can play a role in understanding climate change and other environmental processes, particularly where formal data collection 
is sparse (Alexander et al. 2011; Schick et al. 2018), and can contribute to accurate predictions of impending environmental change 
(Green and Raygorodetsky 2010; Orlove et al. 2010) (medium confidence). At both global level (Alexander et al. 2011; Green and 
Raygorodetsky 2010), and local level (Speranza et al. 2010; Ayanlade et al. 2017), strong correlations between local perceptions of 
climate change and meteorological data have been shown, as calendars, almanacs, and other seasonal and interannual systems 
knowledge embedded in ILK hold information about environmental baselines (Orlove et al. 2010; Cochran et al. 2016).

Cross-Chapter Box 13 (continued)
ILK is strongly associated with sustainable management of natural resources, (including land), and with autonomous adaptation to 
climate variability and change, while also serving as a resource for externally-facilitated adaptation (Stringer et al. 2009). For example, 
women’s traditional knowledge adds value to a society’s knowledge base and supports climate change adaptation practices (Lane 
and McNaught 2009). In dryland environments, populations have historically demonstrated remarkable resilience and innovation to 
cope with high climatic variability, manage dynamic interactions between local communities and ecosystems, and sustain livelihoods 
(Safriel and Adeel 2008; Davies 2017). There is high confidence that pastoralists have created formal and informal institutions based 
on ILK for regulating grazing, collection and cutting of herbs and wood, and use of forests across the Middle East and North Africa 
(Louhaichi and Tastad 2010; Domínguez 2014; Auclair et al. 2011), Mongolia (Fernandez-Gimenez 2000), the Horn of Africa (Oba 2013) 
and the Sahel (Krätli and Schareika 2010). Herders in both the Horn of Africa and the Sahel have developed complex livestock breeding 
and selection systems for their dryland environment (Krätli 2008; Fre 2018). Numerous traditional water harvesting techniques are 
used across the drylands to adapt to climate variability: planting pits (zai, ngoro) and micro-basins and contouring hill slopes and 
terracing (Biazin et al. 2012), alongside the traditional ndiva water harvesting system in Tanzania to capture runoff in community-
managed micro-dams for small-scale irrigation (Enfors and Gordon 2008).
Across diverse agro-ecological systems, ILK is the basis for traditional practices to manage the landscape and sustain food production, 
while delivering co-benefits in the form of biodiversity and ecosystem resilience at a landscape scale (high confidence). Flexibility and 
adaptiveness are hallmarks of such systems (Richards 1985a; Biggs et al. 2013), and documented examples include: traditional integrated 
watershed management in the Philippines (Camacho et al. 2016); widespread use of terracing, with benefits, in cases of both intensifying 
and decreasing rainfall (Arnáez et al. 2015; Chen et al. 2017b) and management of water harvesting and local irrigation systems in the 
Indo-Gangetic Plains (Rivera-Ferre et al. 2016). Rice cultivation in East Borneo is sustained by traditional forms of shifting cultivation, 
often involving intercropping of rice with bananas, cassava and other food crops (Siahaya et al. 2016), although the use of fire in land 
clearance implies trade-offs for climate change mitigation which have been sparsely assessed. Indigenous practices for enhanced soil 
fertility have been documented among South Asian farmers (Chandra et al. 2011; Dey and Sarkar 2011) and among Mayan farmers, 
where management of carbon has positive impacts on mitigation (Falkowski et al. 2016). Korean traditional groves or ‘bibosoop’ have 
been shown to reduce wind speed and evaporation in agricultural landscapes (Koh et al. 2010). Particularly in the context of changing 
climates, agriculture based on ILK that focuses on biodiversification, soil management, and sustainable water harvesting holds promise 
for long-term resilience (Altieri and Nicholls 2017) and rehabilitation of degraded land (Maikhuri et al. 1997). ILK is also important in other 
forms of ecosystem management, such as forests and wetlands, which may be conserved by efforts such as sacred sites (Ens et al. 2015; 
Pungetti et al. 2012). ILK can also play an important role in ecological restoration efforts, including for carbon sinks, through knowledge 
surrounding species selection and understanding of ecosystem processes, like fire (Kimmerer 2000). 
Constraints on the use of ILK
Use of ILK as a resource in responding to climate change can be constrained in at least three ways (high confidence). First, the 
rate of climate change and the scale of its impacts may render incremental adaptation based on the ILK of smallholders and others, less 
relevant and less effective (Lane and McNaught 2009; Orlowsky and Seneviratne 2012; Huang et al. 2016; Morton 2017). Second, 
maintenance and transmission of ILK across generations may be disrupted, for example, by formal education, missionary activity, 
livelihood diversification away from agriculture, and a general perception that ILK is outdated and unfavourably contrasted with 
scientific knowledge (Speranza et al. 2010), and by HIV-related mortality (White and Morton 2005). Urbanisation can erode ILK, 
although ILK is constantly evolving, and becoming integrated into urban environments (Júnior et al. 2016; Oteros-Rozas et al. 2013; 
van Andel and Carvalheiro 2013). Third, ILK holders are experiencing difficulty in using ILK due to loss of access to resources, such as 
through large-scale land acquisition (Siahaya et al. 2016; Speranza et al. 2010; de Coninck et al. 2018). The increasing globalisation of 
food systems and integration into global market economy also threatens to erode ILK (Gómez-Baggethun et al. 2010; Oteros-Rozas 
et al. 2013; McCarter et al. 2014). The potential role that ILK can play in adaptation at the local level depends on the configuration 
of a policy–institutions–knowledge nexus (Stringer et al. 2018), which includes power relations across levels and interactions with 
government strategies (Alexander et al. 2011; Naess 2013). 
Incorporation of ILK in decision-making 
ILK can be used in decision-making on climate change adaptation, sustainable land management (SLM) and food security at various 
scales and levels, and is important for long-term sustainability (high confidence). Respect for ILK is both a requirement and an entry 
strategy for participatory climate action planning and effective communication of climate action strategies (Nyong et al. 2007). The 
nature, source, and mode of knowledge generation are critical to ensure that sustainable solutions are community-owned and fully 
integrated within the local context (Mistry and Berardi 2016). Integrating ILK with scientific information is a prerequisite for such 
community-owned solutions. Scientists can engage farmers as experts in processes of knowledge co-production (Oliver et al. 2012),

Citizen science 
Citizen science is a democratic approach to science involving 
citizens in collecting, classifying, and interpreting data to influence 
policy and assist decision processes, including issues relevant to the 
environment (Kullenberg and Kasperowski 2016). It has flourished in 
recent years due to easily available technical tools for collecting and 
disseminating information (e.g., cell phone-based apps, cloud-based 
services, ground sensors, drone imagery, and others), recognition 
of its free source of labour, and requirements of funding agencies 
for project-related outreach (Silvertown 2009). There is significant 
potential for combining citizen science and participatory modelling 
to obtain favourable outcomes and improve environmental decision-
making (medium confidence) (Gray et al. 2017). Citizen participation 
in land-use simulation integrates stakeholders’ preferences through 
the generation of parameters in analytical and discursive approaches 
(Hewitt et al. 2014), and thereby supports the translation of narrative 
scenarios to quantitative outputs (Mallampalli et al. 2016), supports 
the development of digital tools to be used in co-designing decision-
making participatory structures (Bommel et al. 2014), and supports 
the use of games to understand the preferences of local decision-
making when exploring various balanced policies about risks (Adam 
et al. 2016).
There is medium confidence that citizen science improves SLM 
through mediating and facilitating landscape conservation decision-
making and planning, as well as boosting environmental awareness 
and advocacy (Lange and Hehl-Lange 2011; Bonsu et al. 2017; 
Graham et al. 2015; Bonsu et al. 2017; Lange and Hehl-Lange 2011; 
Sayer et al. 2015; McKinley et al. 2017; Johnson et al. 2017, 2014; Gray 
et al. 2017). One study found limited evidence of direct conservation 
impact (Ballard et al. 2017) and most of the cases derive from rich 
industrialised countries (Loos et al. 2015). There are many practical 
challenges to the concept of citizen science at the local level. These 
include differing methods and the lack of universal implementation 
framework (Conrad and Hilchey 2011; Jalbert and Kinchy 2016; 
Stone et al. 2014). Uncertainty related to citizen science needs to be 
recognised and managed (Swanson et al. 2016; Bird et al. 2014; Lin 
et al. 2015) and citizen science projects around the world need better 
coordination to understand significant issues, such as climate change 
(Bonney et al. 2014). 
Participation, collective action, and social learning
As land and climate issues cannot be solved by one individual, 
a diverse collective action issue exists for land-use policies and 
planning practices (Moroni 2018) at local, national, and regional 
levels. Collective action involves individuals and communities in 
land-planning processes in order to determine successful climate 
adaptation and mitigation (Nkoana et al. 2017; Liu and Ravenscroft 
2017; Nieto-Romero et al. 2016; Nikolakis et al. 2016), or as Sarzynski 
(2015) finds, a community ‘pulling together’ to solve common 
adaptation and land-planning issues.
Collective action offers solutions for emerging land and climate 
change risks, including strategies that target maintenance or change 
of land-use practices, increase livelihood security, share risk through 
pooling, and sometimes also aim to promote social and economic 
goals such as reducing poverty (Samaddar et al. 2015; Andersson and 
Gabrielsson 2012). Collective action has resulted in the successful 
implementation of national-level land transfer policies (Liu and 
Ravenscroft 2017), rural development and land sparing (Jelsma et 
al. 2017), and the development of tools to identify shared objectives, 
trade-offs and barriers to land management (Nieto-Romero et 
al. 2016; Nikolakis et al. 2016). Collective action can also produce 
mutually binding agreements, government regulation, privatisation, 
and incentive systems (IPCC 2014c). 
Successful 
collective 
action 
requires 
understanding 
and 
implementation of factors that determine successful participation 
in climate adaptation and mitigation (Nkoana et al. 2017). These 
include ownership, empowerment or self-reliance, time effectiveness, 
economic and behavioural interests, livelihood security, and the 
requirement for plan implementation (Samaddar et al. 2015; Djurfeldt 
et al. 2018; Sánchez and Maseda 2016). In a UK study, dynamic trust 
relations among members around specific issues, determined the 
potential of agri-environmental schemes to offer landscape-scale 
environmental protection (Riley et al. 2018). Collective action is 
context specific and rarely scaled up or replicated in other places 
(Samaddar et al. 2015). 
Collective action in land-use policy has been shown to be more 
effective when implemented as bundles of actions rather than as 
Cross-Chapter Box 13 (continued)
helping to introduce, implement, adapt and promote locally appropriate responses (Schwilch et al. 2011). Specific approaches 
to  decision-making that aim to integrate indigenous and local knowledge include some versions of decision support systems 
(Jones et al. 2014) as well as citizen science and participatory modelling (Tengö et al. 2014). 
ILK can be deployed in the practice of climate governance, especially at the local level where actions are informed by the principles of 
decentralisation and autonomy (Chanza and de Wit 2016; Harmsworth and Awatere 2013). International environmental agreements 
are also increasingly including attention to ILK and diverse cultural perspectives, for reasons of social justice and inclusive decision-
making (Brondizio and Tourneau 2016). However, the context-specific, and dynamic nature of ILK and its embeddedness in local 
institutions and power relations needs consideration (Naess 2013). It is also important to take a gendered approach so as not to 
further marginalise certain knowledge, as men and women hold different knowledge, expertise and transmission patterns (Díaz-
Reviriego et al. 2017).

single-issue actions. For example, land tenure, food security, and 
market access can mutually reinforce each other when they are 
interconnected (Corsi et al. 2017). For example, Liu and Ravenscroft 
(2017) found that financial incentives embedded in collective forest 
reforms in China have increased forest land and labour inputs 
in forestry. 
A product of participation, equally important in practical terms, 
is social learning (high confidence) (Reed et al. 2010; Dryzek and 
Pickering 2017; Gupta 2014), which is learning in and with social 
groups through interaction (Argyris 1999) including collaboration 
and organisation which occurs in networks of interdependent 
stakeholders (Mostert et al. 2007). Social learning is defined as 
a change in understanding measured by a change in behaviour, and 
perhaps worldview, by individuals and wider social units, communities 
of practice and social networks (Reed et al. 2010; Gupta 2014). Social 
learning is an important factor contributing to long-term climate 
adaptation whereby individuals and organisations engage in a multi-
step social process, managing different framings of issues while raising 
awareness of climate and land risks and opportunities, exploring 
policy options and institutionalising new  rights, responsibilities, 
feedback and learning processes (Tàbara et al. 2010). It is important 
for engaging with uncertainty (Newig et al. 2010) and addressing the 
increasing unequal geography of food security (Sonnino et al. 2014). 
Social learning is achieved through reflexivity or the ability of a social 
structure, process, or set of ideas to reconfigure itself after reflection 
on performance through open-minded people interacting iteratively 
to produce reasonable and well-informed opinions (Dryzek and 
Pickering 2017). These processes develop through skilled facilitation 
attending to social differences and power, resulting in a shared view 
of how change might happen (Harvey et al. 2012; Ensor and Harvey 
2015). When combined with collective action, social learning can 
make transformative change, measured by a change in worldviews 
(beliefs about the world and reality) and understanding of power 
dynamics (Gupta 2014; Bamberg et al. 2015). 
7.6.5 
Land tenure
Land tenure, defined as ‘the terms under which land and natural 
resources are held by individuals, households or social groups’, is a key 
dimension in any discussion of land–climate interactions, including 
the prospects for both adaptation and land-based mitigation, and 
possible impacts on tenure and thus land security of both climate 
change and climate action (Quan and Dyer 2008) (medium evidence, 
high agreement).
Discussion of land tenure in the context of land–climate interactions 
in developing countries needs to consider the prevalence of informal, 
customary and modified customary systems of land tenure: estimates 
range widely, but perhaps as much as 65% of the world’s total 
land area is managed under some form of these local, customary 
or communal tenure systems, and only a small fraction of this 
(around 15%) is formally recognised by governments (Rights and 
Resources Initiative 2015a). These customary land rights can extend 
across many categories of land, but are difficult to assess properly 
due to poor reporting, lack of legal recognition, and lack of access 
to reporting systems by indigenous and rural peoples (Rights and 
Resources Initiative 2018a). Around 521 million ha of forest land is 
estimated to be legally owned, recognised, or designated for use by 
indigenous and local communities as of 2017 (Rights and Resources 
Initiative 2018b), predominantly in Latin America, followed by Asia. 
However, in India approximately 40  million ha of forest land is 
managed under customary rights not recognised by the government 
(Rights and Resources Initiative 2015b). In 2005 only 1% of land in 
Africa was legally registered (Easterly 2008a). 
Much of the world’s carbon is stored in the biomass and soil on the 
territories of customary landowners, including indigenous peoples 
(Walker et al. 2014; Garnett et al. 2018), making securing of these 
land tenure regimes vital in land and climate protection. These lands 
are estimated to hold at least 293 GtC of carbon, of which around 
one-third (72 GtC) is located in areas where indigenous peoples 
and local communities lack formal recognition of their tenure rights 
(Frechette et al. 2018).
Understanding the interactions between land tenure and climate 
change has to be based on underlying understanding of land tenure 
and land policy and how they relate to sustainable development, 
especially in low- and middle-income countries: such understandings 
have changed considerably over the last three decades, and now 
show that informal or customary systems can provide secure tenure 
(Toulmin and Quan 2000). For smallholder systems, Bruce and Migot-
Adholla (1994) (among other authors) established that African 
customary tenure can provide the necessary security for long-term 
investments in farm fertility such as tree-planting. For pastoral 
systems, Behnke (1994), Lane and Moorehead (1995) and other 
authors showed the rationality of communal tenure in situations 
of environmental variability and herd mobility. However, where 
customary systems are unrecognised or weakened by governments, 
or the rights from them are undocumented or unenforced, tenure 
insecurity may result (Lane 1998; Toulmin and Quan 2000). There is 
strong empirical evidence of the links between secure communal 
tenure and lower deforestation rates, particularly for intact forests 
(Nepstad et al. 2006; Persha et al. 2011; Vergara-Asenjo and Potvin 
2014). Securing and recognising tenure for indigenous communities 
(such as through revisions to legal or policy frameworks) has been 
shown to be highly cost effective in reducing deforestation and 
improving land management in certain contexts, and is therefore 
also apt to help improve indigenous communities’ ability to adapt to 
climate changes (Suzuki 2012; Balooni et al. 2008; Ceddia et al. 2015; 
Pacheco et al. 2012; Holland et al. 2017).
Rights to water for agriculture or livestock are linked to land tenure 
in complex ways still little understood and neglected by policymakers 
and planners (Cotula 2006a). Provision of water infrastructure 
tends to increase land values, but irrigation schemes often entail 
reallocation of land rights (Cotula 2006b) and new inequalities based 
on water availability such as the creation of a category of tailenders 
(farmers at the downstream end of distribution channels) in large-
scale irrigation (Chambers 1988) and disruption of pastoral grazing 
patterns through use of riverine land (Behnke and Kerven 2013).
750
Chapter 7 
Risk management and decision-making in relation to sustainable development

Understanding land tenure under climate change also has to take 
account of the growth in large-scale land acquisitions (LSLAs), also 
referred to as land-grabbing, in developing countries. These LSLAs are 
defined by acquisition of more than 200 ha per deal  (Messerli et al. 
2014a). Klaus Deininger (2011) links the growth in demand for land 
to the 2007–2008 food price spike, and demonstrates that high levels 
of demand for land at the country level are statistically associated 
with weak recognition of land rights. Land grabs, where LSLAs occur 
despite local use of lands, are often driven by direct collaboration of 
politicians, government officials and land agencies (Koechlin et al. 
2016), involving corruption of governmental land agencies, failures to 
register community land claims and illegal lands uses, and lack of the 
rule of law and enforcement in resource extraction frontiers (Borras Jr 
et al. 2011). Though data is poor, overall, small- and medium-scale 
domestic investment has in fact been more important than foreign 
investment (Deininger 2011; Cotula et al. 2014). There are variations 
in estimates of the scale of LSLAs: Nolte et al. (2016) concluded that 
deals totalled 42.2 million ha worldwide. Cotula et al. (2014) using 
cross-checked data for completed lease agreements in Ethiopia, 
Ghana and Tanzania conclude that they cover 1.9%, 1.9% and 1.1% 
respectively of each country’s total land suitable for agriculture. The 
literature expresses different views on whether these acquisitions 
concern marginal lands or lands already in use, thereby displacing 
existing users (Messerli et al. 2014b). Land-grabbing is associated 
with, and may be motivated by, the acquisition of rights to water, 
and erosion of those rights for other users such as those downstream 
(Mehta et al. 2012). Quantification of the acquisition of water 
rights resulting from LSLAs raises major issues of definition, data 
availability, and measurement. One estimate of the total acquisition 
of gross irrigation water associated with land-grabbing across the 
24 countries most affected is 280 billion m3 (Rulli et al. 2013).
While some authors see LSLAs as investments that can contribute 
to more efficient food production at larger scales (World Bank 2011; 
Deininger and Byerlee 2012), others have warned that local food 
security may be threatened by them (Daniel 2011; Golay and Biglino 
2013; Lavers 2012). Reports suggest that recent land-grabbing has 
affected 12 million people globally in terms of declines in welfare 
(Adnan 2013; Davis et al. 2014). De Schutter (2011) argues that 
large-scale land acquisitions will: a) result in types of farming less 
liable to reduce poverty than smallholder systems, b) increase local 
vulnerability to food price shocks by favouring export agriculture 
and  c) accelerate the development of a  market for land, with 
detrimental impacts on smallholders and those depending on 
common property resources. Land-grabbing can threaten not only 
agricultural lands of farmers, but also protected ecosystems, like 
forests and wetlands (Hunsberger et al. 2017; Carter et al. 2017; 
Ehara et al. 2018).
The primary mechanisms for combating LSLAs have included 
restrictions on the size of land sales (Fairbairn 2015), pressure on 
agribusiness companies to agree to Voluntary Guidelines on the 
Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in 
the Context of National Food Security, known as VGGT, or similar 
principles (Collins 2014; Goetz 2013), attempts to repeal biofuels 
standards (Palmer 2014), strengthening of existing land law and 
land registration systems (Bebbington et al. 2018), use of community 
monitoring systems (Sheil et al. 2015), and direct protests against 
land acquisitions (Hall et al. 2015; Fameree 2016).
Table 7.7 sets out, in highly summarised form, some key findings on 
the multi-directional inter-relations between land tenure and climate 
change, with particular reference to developing countries. The rows 
represent different categories of landscape or resource systems. For 
each system the second column summarises current understandings 
on land tenure and sustainable development, in many cases predating 
concerns over climate change. The third column summarises the 
most important implications of land tenure systems, policy about 
land tenure, and the implementation of that policy, for vulnerability 
and adaptation to climate change, and the fourth column gives 
a similar summary for mitigation of climate change. The fifth column 
summarises key findings on how climate change and climate action

Smallholder cropland
In South Asia and Latin America, 
the poor suffer from limited access, 
including insecure tenancies, though 
this has been partially alleviated 
by land reform.1 In Africa informal/
customary systems may provide 
considerable land tenure security 
and enable long-term investment in 
land management, but are increasingly 
weakened by demographic pressures 
on available land resources increase. 
However, creation of freehold rights 
through conventional land titling 
is not a necessary condition for 
tenure security and may be cost-
ineffective or counterproductive.2,3,4,5 
Alternative approaches utilising 
low-cost technologies and participatory 
methods are available.6 Secure and 
defendable land tenure, including 
modified customary tenure, has 
been positively correlated with 
food production increases.7,8,9
Insecure land rights are one factor 
deterring adaptation and accentuating 
vulnerability.10,11 Specific dimensions 
of inequity in customary systems 
may act as constraints on adaptation 
in different contexts.12 Large-scale 
land acquisitions (LSLAs) may be 
associated with monoculture and 
other unsustainable land-use practices, 
have negative consequences for soil 
degradation13 and disincentivise more 
sustainable forms of agriculture.14
Secure land rights, including through 
customary systems, can incentivise 
farmers to adopt long-term climate-
smart practices,15 e.g., planting trees 
in mixed cropland/forest systems.16
Increased frequency and intensity 
of extreme weather can lead to 
displacement and effective loss 
of land rights.17 REDD+ (reducing 
emissions from deforestation and 
forest degradation) programmes 
tend slightly to increase land tenure 
insecurity on agricultural forest frontier 
lands – but not in forests.18
Landscape governance and resource 
tenure reforms at farm and community 
levels can facilitate and incentivise 
planning for landscape management 
and enable the integration of 
adaptation and mitigation strategies.11
Rangelands
Communal management of rangelands 
in pastoral systems is a rational and 
internally sustainable response to 
climate variability and the need for 
mobility. Policies favouring individual 
or small group land-tenure may have 
negative impacts on both ecosystems 
and livelihoods.19,20,21
Many pastoralists in lands at risk from 
desertification do not have secure 
land tenure, and erosion of traditional 
communal rangeland tenure has 
been identified as a determinant 
of increasing vulnerability to drought 
and climate change and as a driver 
of dryland degradation.22,23,24,25,26
Where pastoralists’ traditional land 
use does not have legal recognition, 
or where pastoralists are unable to 
exclude others from land use, this 
presents significant challenges for 
carbon sequestration initiatives.27,28
Increasing conflict on rangelands is 
a possible result of climate change and 
environmental pressures, but depends 
on local institutions.29 Where land-use 
rights for pastoralists are absent or 
unenforced, demonstrated potential 
for carbon sequestration may 
assist advocacy.28
Carbon sequestration initiatives on 
rangelands may require clarification 
and maintenance of land rights.27,28

Forests
Poor management of state and open-
access forests has been combated 
in recent years by a move towards 
forest decentralisation and community 
co-management.30,31,32,33,34,35
Land tenure systems have complex 
interactions with deforestation 
processes. Land tenure security 
is generally associated with less 
deforestation, regardless of whether 
the tenure form is private, customary 
or communal.33,36,37,38 Historical 
injustices towards forest dwellers 
can be ameliorated with appropriate 
policy, e.g., 2006 Forest Rights Act 
in India.39
Land tenure security can lead to 
improved adaptation outcomes40,41,42,43 
but land tenure policy for forests that 
focuses narrowly on cultivation has 
limited ability to reduce ecological 
vulnerability or enhance adaptation.39
Secure rights to land and forest 
resources can facilitate efforts to 
stabilise shifting cultivation and 
promote more sustainable resource 
use if appropriate technical and 
market support are available.44
Land tenure insecurity has been 
identified as a key driver of 
deforestation and land degradation, 
leading to loss of sinks and creating 
sources of GHGs.45,46,47,48,49 While 
land tenure systems interact with 
land-based mitigation actions in 
complex ways,36 forest decentralisation 
and community co-management has 
shown considerable success in slowing 
forest loss and contributing to carbon 
mitigation.30,31,32,33,34,35 Communal 
tenure systems may lower transaction 
costs for REDD+ schemes, though with 
risk of elite capture of payments.16
Findings on both direction of change in 
tenure security and extent to which this 
has been influenced by REDD+ are very 
diverse.18 The implications of land-
based mitigation – e.g., bioenergy with 
carbon capture and storage (BECCS) – 
on land tenure systems is currently 
understudied, but evidence from 
biofuels expansion shows negative 
impacts on local livelihoods and loss 
of forest sinks where LSLAs override 
local land tenure.50,51
Forest tenure policies under climate 
change need to accommodate 
and enable evolving and shifting 
boundaries linked to changing forest 
livelihoods.10 REDD+ programmes need 
to be integrated with national-level 
forest tenure reform.18
Poor and informal urban settlements
Residents of poor and informal urban 
settlements enjoy varying degrees 
of tenure security from different forms 
of tenure. Security will be increased 
by building on de facto rights rather 
than through abrupt changes in 
tenure systems.52
Public land on the outskirts of 
urban areas can be used to adapt 
to increasing flood risks by protecting 
natural assets.53 Secure land titles 
in hazardous locations may make 
occupants reluctant to move and 
raise the costs of compensation 
and resettlement.17
Urban land-use strategies such as 
tree planting, establishing public parks, 
can save energy usage by moderating 
urban temperature and protect human 
settlement from natural disaster such 
as flooding or heatwaves.54
Without proper planning, climate 
hazards can undermine efforts 
to recognise and strengthen 
informal tenure rights without 
proper planning.55,56
Climate risks increase the requirements 
for land-use planning and settlement 
that increases tenure security, with 
direct involvement of residents, 
improved use of public land, and 
innovative collaboration with private 
and traditional land owners.56,57
Riverscapes and riparian fringes
Well-defined but spatially flexible 
community tenure can support 
regulated and sustainable 
artisanal capture fisheries 
and biodiversity.58,59,60,61,62,63,64
Unequal land rights and absence 
of land management arrangements 
in floodplains increases vulnerability 
and constrains adaptation.65 
Marginalised or landless fisherfolk 
will be empowered by tenurial rights 
and associated identity to respond 
more effectively to ecological 
changes in riverscapes, including 
riparian zones.66,67,68,69
Mitigation measures such as protection 
of riparian forests and grasslands 
can potentially play a major role, 
provided rights to land and trees 
are sufficiently clear.70,71
Secured but spatially flexible 
tenure will enable climate change 
mitigation in riverscapes to be 
synergised with local livelihoods 
and ecological security.67,72

In drylands, weak land tenure security, either for households 
disadvantaged within a customary tenure system or more widely as 
such a system is eroded, can be associated with increased vulnerability 
and decreased adaptive capacity (limited evidence, high agreement). 
There is medium evidence and medium agreement that land titling 
and recognition programmes, particularly those that authorise and 
respect indigenous and communal tenure, can lead to improved 
management of forests, including for carbon storage (Suzuki 2012; 
Balooni et al. 2008; Ceddia et al. 2015; Pacheco et al. 2012), primarily 
by providing legally secure mechanisms for exclusion of others (Nelson 
et al. 2001; Blackman et al. 2017). However, these titling programmes 
are highly context-dependent and there is also evidence that titling 
can exclude community and common management, leading to more 
confusion over land rights, not less, where poorly implemented 
(Broegaard et al. 2017). For all the systems, an important finding is 
that land policies can provide both security and flexibility in the face 
of climate change, but through a diversity of forms and approaches 
(recognition of customary tenure, community mapping, redistribution, 
decentralisation, co-management, regulation of rental markets, 
strengthening the negotiating position of the poor) rather than sole 
focus on freehold title (medium evidence, high agreement) (Quan 
and Dyer, 2008; Deininger and Feder 2009; St. Martin 2009). Land 
policy can be climate-proofed and integrated with national policies 
such as National Adaptation Programme of Action NAPAs (Quan and 
Dyer 2008). Land administration systems have a vital role in providing 
land tenure security, especially for the poor, especially when linked 
to an expanded range of information relevant to mitigation and 
adaptation (Quan and Dyer 2008; van der Molen and Mitchell 2016). 
Challenges to such a role include outdated and overlapping national 
land and forest tenure laws, which often fail to recognise community 
property rights and corruption in land administration (Monterrosso 
et al. 2017), as well as lack of political will and the costs of improving 
land administration programmes (Deininger and Feder 2009).
7.6.6 
Institutional dimensions of adaptive governance
Institutional systems that demonstrate the institutional dimensions, 
or indicators (Table  7.8) enhance the adaptive capacity of the 
socio-ecological system to a  greater degree than institutional 
systems that do not demonstrate these dimensions (high confidence) 
(Gupta et al. 2010; Mollenkamp and Kasten 2009). Governance 
processes and policy instruments supporting these characteristics 
are context specific (medium evidence, high agreement) (Biermann 
2007; Gunderson and Holling 2001; Hurlbert and Gupta 2017; Bastos 
Lima et al. 2017a; Gupta et al. 2013a; Mollenkamp and Kasten 2009; 
Nelson et al. 2010; Olsson et al. 2006; Ostrom 2011; Pahl-Wostl 2009; 
Verweij et al. 2006; Weick and Sutcliffe 2001).
Consideration of these indicators is important when implementing 
climate change mitigation instruments. For example, a  ‘variety,’ 
redundancy, or duplication of climate mitigation policy instruments 
is an important consideration for meeting Paris Agreement 
commitments. Given that 58% of EU emissions are outside of the 
EU Emissions Trading System, implementation of a  ‘redundant’ 
carbon tax may add co-benefits (Baranzini et al. 2017). Further, 
a carbon tax phased in over time through a schedule of increases 
allows for ‘learning.’The tax revenues could be earmarked to finance 
additional climate change mitigation and/or redistributed to achieve 
the indicator of ‘fair governance – equity’. It is recommended that 
carbon pricing measures be implemented using information-sharing 
and communication devices to enable public acceptance, openness, 
provide measurement and accountability (Baranzini et al. 2017; 
Siegmeier et al. 2018).
The impact of flood on a socio-ecological system is reduced with the 
governance indicator of both leadership and resources (Emerson and 
Gerlak 2014).‘Leadership’ pertains to a  broad set of stakeholders 
that facilitate adaptation (and might include scientists and leaders 
in NGOs) and those that respond to flood in an open, inclusive, and 
fair manner identifying the most pressing issues and actions needed. 
Resources are required to support this leadership and includes upfront 
financial investment in human capital, technology, and infrastructure 
(Emerson and Gerlak 2014).
Policy instruments advancing the indicator of ‘participation’ in 
community forest management include favourable loans, tax 
measures, and financial support to catalyse entrepreneurial 
leadership, and build in rewards for supportive and innovative elites 
to reduce elite capture and ensure more inclusive participation 
(Duguma et al. 2018) (Section 7.6.4).

Inclusive governance for 
sustainable development
Many sustainable development efforts fail because of lack of 
attention to societal issues, including inequality, discrimination, social 
exclusion and marginalisation (see Cross-Chapter Box  11 in this 
chapter) (Arts 2017a). However, the human-rights-based approach 
of the 2030 Agenda and Sustainable Development Goals commits 
to leaving no one behind (Arts 2017b). Inclusive governance focuses 
attention in issues of equity and the human-rights-based approach 
for development as it includes social, ecological and relational 
components used for assessing access to, as well as the allocations of 
rights, responsibilities and risks with respect to social and ecological 
resources (medium agreement) (Gupta and Pouw 2017).
Governance processes that are inclusive of all people in 
decision-making and management of land, are better able to make 
decisions addressing trade-offs of sustainable development (Gupta 
et al. 2015) and achieve SDGs focusing on social and ecological 
inclusiveness (Gupta and Vegelin 2016). Citizen engagement is 
important in enhancing natural resource service delivery by citizen 
inclusion in management and governance decisions (Section 7.5.5). 
In governing natural resources, focus is now not only on rights of 
citizens in relation to natural resources, but also on citizen obligations, 
responsibilities (Karar and Jacobs-Mata 2016; Chaney and Fevre 
2001), feedback and learning processes (Tàbara et al. 2010). In this 
respect, citizen engagement is also an imperative, particularly for 
analysing and addressing aggregated informal coping strategies of 
local residents in developing countries, which are important drivers 
of natural resource depletions (but often overlooked in conventional 
policy development processes in natural resource management) 
(Ehara et al. 2018).
Inclusive adaptive governance makes important contributions to the 
management of risk. Inclusive governance concerning risk integrates 
people’s knowledge and values by involving them in decision-making 
processes where they are able to contribute their respective 
knowledge and values to make effective, efficient, fair, and morally 
acceptable decisions (Renn and Schweizer 2009). Representation in 
decision-making would include major actors – government, economic 
sectors, the scientific community and representatives of civil society 
(Renn and Schweizer 2009). Inclusive governance focuses attention 
on the well-being and meaningful participation in decision-making 
of the poorest (in income), vulnerable (in terms of age, gender, 
and location), and the most marginalised, and is inclusive of all 
knowledges (Gupta et al. 2015).

responding to these risks, as well as decision-making and adaptive 
climate and land governance, in the face of uncertainty.
More research is required to understand the complex interconnections 
of land, climate, water, society, ES and food, including:
• new models that allow incorporation of considerations of justice, 
inequality and human agency in socio-environmental systems
• understanding how policy instruments and response options 
interact and augment or reduce risks in relation to acute shocks 
and slow-onset climate events
• understanding how response options, policy and instrument 
portfolios can reduce or augment the cascading impacts of land, 
climate and food security and ES interactions through different 
domains such as health, livelihoods and infrastructure, especially 
in relation to non-linear and tipping-point changes in natural and 
human systems
• consideration of trade-offs and synergies in climate, land, water, 
ES and food policies
• the impacts of increasing use of land due to climate mitigation 
measures such as BECCS, carbon-centric afforestation/REDD+ and 
their impacts on human conflict, livelihoods and displacement
• understanding how different land tenure systems, both formal 
and informal, and the land policies and administration systems 
that support them, can constrain or facilitate climate adaptation 
and mitigation, and on how forms of climate action can enhance 
or undermine land tenure security and land justice
• expanding understanding of barriers to implementation of 
land-based climate policies at all levels from the local to the 
global, including methods for monitoring and documenting 
corruption, misappropriation and elite capture in climate action
• identifying characteristics and attributes signalling impending 
socio-ecological tipping points and collapse
• understanding the full cost of climate change in the context of 
disagreement on accounting for climate change interactions 
and their impact on society, as well as issues of valuation, and 
attribution uncertainties across generations
• new models and Earth observation to understand the complex 
interactions described in this section
• the impacts, monitoring, effectiveness, and appropriate selection 
of certification and standards for sustainability (Section 7.4.6.3) 
(Stattman et al. 2018) and the effectiveness of its implementation 
through the landscape governance approach (Pacheco et al. 
2016) (Section 7.6.3).
Actions to mitigate climate change are rarely evaluated in relation 
to impact on adaptation, SDGs, and trade-offs with food security. For 
instance, there is a gap in knowledge in the optimal carbon pricing 
or emission trading scheme together with monitoring, reporting 
and verification system for agricultural emissions that will advance 
GHG reductions, food security, and SLM. Better understanding is 
needed of the triggers and leveraging actions that build sustainable 
development and SLM, as well as the effective organisation of the 
science and society interaction jointly shaping policies in the future. 
What societal interaction in the future will form inclusive and 
equitable governance processes and achieve inclusive governance 
institutions, especially including land tenure?
As there is a significant gap in NDCs and achieving commitments to 
keep global warming well below 2°C (Section 7.4.4.1), governments 
might consider evaluating national, regional, and local gaps in 
knowledge surrounding response options, policy instruments 
portfolios, and SLM supporting the achievement of NDCs in the face 
of land and climate change.
Frequently Asked Questions
FAQ 7.1 | 
 How can indigenous knowledge and local knowledge inform land-based mitigation 
and adaptation options?
Indigenous knowledge (IK) refers to the understandings, skills and philosophies developed by societies with long histories of 
interaction with their natural surroundings. Local knowledge (LK) refers to the understandings and skills developed by individuals 
and populations, specific to the place where they live. These forms of knowledge, jointly referred to as Indigenous and Local 
Knowledge or ILK, are often highly context specific and embedded in local institutions, providing biological and ecosystem 
knowledge with landscape information. For example, they can contribute to effective land management, predictions of natural 
disasters, and identification of longer-term climate changes, and ILK can be particularly useful where formal data collection on 
environmental conditions may be sparse. ILK is often dynamic, with knowledge holders often experimenting with mixes of local and 
scientific approaches. Water management, soil fertility practices, grazing systems, restoration and sustainable harvesting of forests, 
and ecosystem-based adaptation are many of the land management practices often informed by ILK. ILK can also be used as an 
entry point for climate adaptation by balancing past experiences with new ways to cope. To be effective, initiatives need to take 
into account the differences in power between the holders of different types of knowledge. For example, including indigenous and/
or local people in programmes related to environmental conservation, formal education, land management planning and security 
tenure rights is key to facilitate climate change adaptation. Formal education is necessary to enhance adaptive capacity of ILK, 
since some researchers have suggested that these knowledge systems may become less relevant in certain areas where the rate of 
environmental change is rapid and the transmission of ILK between generations is becoming weaker.

FAQ 7.2 | 
 What are the main barriers to and opportunities for land-based responses 
to climate change?
Land-based responses to climate change can be mitigation (e.g., renewable energy, vegetation or crops for biofuels, afforestation) 
or adaptation (e.g., change in cropping pattern, less water-intensive crops in response to moisture stress), or adaptation with 
mitigation co-benefits (e.g., dietary shifts, new uses for invasive tree species, siting solar farms on highly degraded land). Productive 
land is an increasingly scarce resource under climate change. In the absence of adequate deep mitigation in the less land-intensive 
energy sector, competition for land and water for mitigation and for other sectors such as food security, ecosystem services (ES) and 
biodiversity conservation could become a source of conflict and a barrier to land-based responses.
Barriers to land-based mitigation include opposition due to real and perceived trade-offs between land for mitigation and food 
security and ES. These can arise due to absence of or uncertain land and water rights. Significant upscaling of mitigation requires 
dedicated (normally land-based) sources in addition to use of wastes and residues. This requires high land-use intensity compared 
to other mitigation options that, in turn, place greater demands on governance. A key governance mechanism that has emerged in 
response to such concerns, especially during the past decade are standards and certification systems that include food security, and 
land and water rights, in addition to general criteria or indicators related to sustainable use of land and biomass, with an emphasis 
on participatory approaches. Other governance responses include linking land-based mitigation (e.g., forestry) to secure tenure and 
support for local livelihoods. A barrier to land-based mitigation is our choice of development pathway. Our window of opportunity – 
whether or not we face barriers or opportunities to land-based mitigation – depends on socio-economic decisions or pathways. If 
we have high population growth and resource intensive consumption (i.e., SSP3) we will have more barriers. High population and 
low land-use regulation results in less available space for land-based mitigation. But if we have the opposite trends (SSP1), we can 
have more opportunities.
Other barriers can arise when, in the short term, adaptation to a climate stress (e.g., increased dependence on groundwater during 
droughts) can become unsustainable in the longer term, and become a maladaptation. Policies and approaches that lead to land 
management that synergises multiple ES and reduce trade-offs could find greater acceptance and enjoy more success.
Opportunities to obtain benefits or synergies from land-based mitigation and adaptation arise from their relation to the land 
availability and the demand for such measures in rural areas that may otherwise lack incentives for investment in infrastructure, 
livelihoods and institutional capacity. After decades of urbanisation around the world, facilitated by significant investment in urban 
infrastructure and centralised energy and agricultural systems, rural areas have been somewhat neglected; this is even as farmers in 
these areas provide critical food and materials needed for urban areas. As land and biomass becomes more valuable, there will be 
benefits for farmers, forest owners and associated service providers as they diversify and feed into economic activities supporting 
bioenergy, value-added products, preservation of biodiversity and carbon sequestration (storage).
A related opportunity for benefits is the potentially positive transformation in rural and peri-urban landscapes that could be 
facilitated by investments that prioritise more effective management of ES and conservation of water, energy, nutrients and other 
resources that have been priced too low in relation to their environmental or ecological value. Multifunctional landscapes supplying 
food, feed, fibre and fuel to both local and urban communities, in combination with reduced waste and healthier diets, could 
restore the role of rural producers as stewards of resources rather than providing food at the lowest possible price. Some of these 
landscape transformations will function as both mitigation and adaptation responses by increasing resilience, even as they provide

Governments can introduce a variety of regulations and economic instruments (taxes, incentives) to encourage citizens, communities 
and societies to adopt sustainable land management practices, with further benefits in addition to mitigation. Windows of 
opportunity for redesigning and implementing mitigation and adaptation can arise in the aftermath of a major disaster or extreme 
climate event. They can also arise when collective action and citizen science motivate voluntary shifts in lifestyles supported by 
supportive top-down policies.
