CO 2 Emissions or Uptake by Soil
from Land-Use Change and
Management
5 . 6 . 1  I n t r o d u c t i o n
The methodology includes estimates of net CO2 emissions (sinks and
sources) from three processes: 1) changes in carbon stored in soil and litter
of mineral soils due to changes in land-use practices, 2) CO2 emissions from
organic soils converted to agriculture or plantation forestry, and 3) CO2
emissions from liming of agricultural soils.  At present, CO2 emissions or
uptake associated with naturally ocurring carbonate minerals in soils are not
included.
5 . 6 . 2  D a t a  S o u r c e s
There are no standard global data sets available for these calculations.  The
primary data needed are information on the distribution of different soil
types and land-use practices within a country.  Information to estimate
impacts of various land-use practices on soil carbon inventories can be
obtained from long-term field experiments.  Sources of such information
include:
• Soil survey and other national resource inventories
• Land-use statistics, agricultural production statistics
• Compendia of long-term field experiments. (See Reference Manual for
references.)
Information for estimating CO2 emissions from lime applications can be
obtained from statistics of lime use or derived from production and import-
export statistics.
5 . 6 . 3  M e t h o d o l o g y
The calculations for CO2 emissions from mineral soils are based on an
accounting of changes in soil (and litter) carbon stocks as a function of
changes in land-use and agricultural management practices.  To calculate
changes in carbon stocks a twenty-year inventory period is used.  This
requires that an estimate of the distribution of land-use systems by soil
types is needed for the present (i.e., inventory) year and for twenty years
ago.  See the Reference Manual for an example calculation.  Estimates of soil
carbon stocks are based on the top 30 cm of the soil profile only.  Deeper
soil layers can also have appreciable carbon stocks, particularly in tropical
soils, but they are generally much less impacted by changes in land
use/management than are topsoil layers and there are less data available for
deeper soil layers.

The calculations for CO2 emissions from organic soils are performed using
annual emission estimates which depend on climate region and landuse.
Thus they require data on the areal extent of organic soils which are
presently used and their current landuse.  The emission rates provided in
the method are derived from a world-wide survey of the scientific
literature.
The calculations for emissions from agricultural liming require only data on
the amount and (preferably) the type of material applied.

Define the types of land-use management systems to be used in the
inventory.
2 
Enter the Land-use/Management System in column A.
 
Worksheet 5-5, sheet 1 should be copied as needed to accommodate
all the management systems used in the inventory (see Appendix in the
Workbook and Table 5-10 in Reference Manual for an example).
3 
Enter the Land Area in column E for each system subdivided by soil
type in million hectares for the current inventory year (t).
 
If a land-use system does not occur on a particular soil type, a zero
("0") should be entered.
4 
Enter the Land Area in column D for the inventory year, (t-20), i.e.,
twenty years prior to the current inventory year.
 
Note: The total areas for each soil type (summed over  all land-use
systems) in year, t, and year, t-20, must be the same.  As a check, sum
values in column D over all land-use systems.  Repeat for all values in
column E.  The sums for columns D and E must be identical (i.e. equal
to the total land area in the inventory).
LAND-USE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
These should represent the major
types of land management systems
present in the country as well as
ecosystem types which are either
being converted to agriculture (e.g.,
forest, savanna, grassland) or have
been 
derived 
from 
previous
agricultural landuse (e.g., abandoned
lands, reforested lands).  Systems
should also reflect differences in soil
carbon stocks that can be related to
differences in management.  For
shifts in management where changes
in carbon stocks occur over a
relatively long time (i.e., > 10 years),
one or more "successional" systems
(e.g., young abandoned land, old
abandoned land) should be defined
(see Step 2).  Examples of default
management systems for different
climatic regions are given in the
Appendix.

Appendix: Default Definitions of
Land-Use/Management Systems
1.   COLD TEMPERATE, DRY
Characterised by mean annual temperature (MAT) of < 10°C and
annual precipitation less than evapotranspiration.  Crop production
is limited by inadequate water, and by a relatively short growing season and
harsh winters which restrict the choice of crops.  Includes the following
areas: northern portion of the Great Plains of North America, and
extensive areas in central and eastern Asia.
a) Rangeland (unimproved): grassland, often dominated by native species,
used to support grazing livestock (chiefly cattle) at comparatively low
intensity.  Usually receive only minimal inputs for fertility amendment or
pest control.
b) Small grain with summer-fallow: predominantly spring annuals (e.g.,
wheat, barley, flax, rapeseed/canola) grown in a sequence with periodic
summer-fallow (a practice, used to replenish soil moisture and nutrients,
whereby land is left unplanted for an entire growing season and weeds
are controlled by tillage and/or herbicide application).  Soils typically
receive only minor inputs of nutrients and other amendments.
c) Small 
grain 
with 
continuous 
cropping 
- 
conventional 
tillage:
predominantly spring annuals, either in monoculture or in various
combinations (including wheat, barley, oats, flax, canola, rye, mustard,
lentil, pea).  Continuous cropping requires higher inputs of nutrients
than cropping systems with summer fallow.  Weed control is achieved
using herbicides (during growing season) in combination with tillage in
spring and/or fall.
d) Small grain with continuous cropping - no till: predominantly spring
annuals, either in monoculture or in various combinations (including
wheat, barley, oats, flax, canola, rye, mustard, lentil, pea).  Continuous
cropping requires higher inputs of nutrients than cropping systems with
summer fallow.  Weed control is achieved using only herbicides, and
crops are seeded without prior tillage directly into residues remaining
from the previous crop.
e) Small grain/forage rotations: predominantly perennial grasses or legumes,
interrupted periodically by several consecutive annual crops (typically
spring-seeded cereals or oilseeds).  A typical rotation might be five to 10
years in length.  As this system is often used in concert with livestock
production, significant amounts of nutrients may be returned in
manures.
f) Hay/improved pasture: predominantly perennial legumes and grasses
maintained for extended periods of time, primarily as a forage.  The
forages are typically non-native species, introduced because of their
comparatively high productivity.
g) Successional grasslands: previously cultivated land which has been
returned to grassland, but has not yet attained characteristics of native
rangeland.  Usually a single species or mixture of grasses established

either through land abandonment or as part of a government program,
often to stabilise degrading lands or to reduce cultivated areas in the
wake of surplus production.
h) Irrigated cropping systems: typically include wide diversity of relatively
high value crops adapted to short-growing seasons, including spring-
seeded cereals and oilseeds, high-value forages, and vegetables (e.g.,
potatoes, root crops, vegetables).  Owing to the high cost of irrigation,
the cropping systems usually involve high inputs of nutrients and other
amendments to maximise yield and crop quality.
2.   COLD TEMPERATE, MOIST
Characterised by MAT < 10°C and annual precipitation similar to
or higher than evapotranspiration.  Crop production is limited by the
short growing season and relatively harsh winters.  Inadequate temperature
to support heat-requiring feedgrains such as maize and soybean; production
dominated by small grain cereals, forages, root crops.  Includes most of
Scandinavia, Finland, and parts of Russia and North America.
a) Forest: natural vegetation includes deciduous forest and Taiga
(coniferous forest); often interspersed with wetlands (peat bogs).
Relatively young soils due to glaciation; many acid with thick litter layer
(podzols).
b) Small grain monocultures: predominantly wheat but also barley, oats,
rye, rapeseed (canola) grown annually.  Full tillage (plough) generally
used.  Often highly fertilised and high-yielding, 5-10 t/ha.  On some
minor areas, a full year bare-fallow may be used at irregular intervals;
earlier used more commonly for weed control (prior to herbicides).
c) Grain/perennial forage crop rotations: small grains and rapeseed grown
in rotation with grass and legume forages, also root crops.  Typical for
mixed farms with livestock, including dairy production.
d) Permanent pasture: used for grazing and/or hay production.  Generally
on soils or in climate zones which are unsuitable for intensive crop
production (e.g., common in Northern Scandinavia and Finland).
e) Grassland and forest set-aside lands: grassland area very fluctuating
between years due to varying subsidy policies.  Short-term rotation
forest for bioenergy is increasing.
3.   WARM TEMPERATE, DRY
Mean annual growing season temperatures in this zone usually
range from 10 to 20°C with annual precipitation usually less than
600 mm; includes continental and Mediterranean climates.
Includes major grain and livestock producing areas in the Great
Plains and Pacific Northwest in the United States, Mediterranean
regions in Australia, Europe and South Africa, and the semi-arid
belt across southern Russia, central Asia and China.
a) Pastoral rangelands: unimproved grassland, often dominated by native
species, used to support grazing livestock (cattle and sheep) at

comparatively low intensity.  Fertiliser additions and pest control are
virtually non-existent.
b) Small grain with summer-fallow (or long-fallow): predominantly small
grains (usually high value wheat) with a year of bare fallow to replenish
soil moisture and nutrients.  This practice is most prevalent in the driest
areas, e.g., where annual precipitation may be less than 400 mm.  Weeds
are controlled by tillage, herbicide application (increasing with use of no-
till), and animal grazing (e.g., sheep in Australia).  Inputs of nutrients and
other amendments often low compared to more continuous cropping
and erosion and soil degradation can be high due to lengthy bare
fallowing.
c) Small grain/legumes with summer-fallow: Legumes in the form of chick
or field peas, lupin and faba beans, are grown in rotation with grain.
This system requires less fertiliser inputs than small grains only due to N
fixation by the legume.  The potential for soil loss through erosion is
usually increased after grain legumes such as field and chick peas as they
tend to provide less residue cover compared to other crops.
d) Small grain with continuous cropping - conventional tillage: Includes small
grains in monoculture (wheat, barley) but increasingly more diverse crop
rotations are being used (e.g., triticale, mustard, canola, sunflower,
maize, sorghum, millet).  These system require a higher input of
nutrients and are more common in higher precipitation zones (> 400
mm).
e) Small grain with continuous cropping - no till: Similar crops as listed
above for conventionally tilled systems, but use of no-till can increase
efficiency of water use and extend the use of more continuous cropping
regimes to lower rainfall areas.  Greater surface residue levels help
control erosion.
f) Small grain with hay/improved pasture: The typical rotation may include
one or two consecutive years of sown annual pasture or hay.  A long-
fallow may also be included prior to the cereal phase.  However, this
practice is being phased out and its use is restricted to marginal cropping
regions.  Organic carbon levels have been found to increase quite
dramatically as has aggregate stability with well-managed pastures.
Rotations of two years cereal and 2-4 years pasture have been used but
are usually non-economical.
g) Successional grasslands: previously cultivated land which has been
returned to grassland, but has not yet attained characteristics of native
rangeland.  Usually a single species or mixture of grasses established
either through land abandonment or as part of a government
programme, often to stabilise degrading lands or to reduce cultivated
areas in the wake of surplus production.
h) Irrigated cropping systems: may include a wide diversity of related crops,
including major field crops (maize, wheat, rice, cotton) as well high value
vegetable crops.  The cropping systems usually involve high inputs of
nutrients and other amendments to maximise yield and crop quality.

4.   WARM TEMPERATE, MOIST
Mean annual growing season temperatures in this zone usually
range from 10-20°C and with annual precipitation near or
exceeding potential evapotranspiration.  Soils in this region include
young glacial-derived soils grading into more highly weathered soils in
warmer (lower latitude) regions.  This zone is dominated by intensively
managed, highly productive agricultural systems.  Includes the central
latitudes of western and eastern Europe, south-eastern Russia,
parts of China, Korea, Japan, the central and eastern United
States, and parts of Australia, New Zealand and South America.
a) Forest: the dominant native ecosystem is temperate deciduous forest, as
well as some areas of humid grasslands and temperate coniferous forests
especially where impacted by frequent fires.  Native grasslands in this
area have been almost exclusively converted to permanent agriculture as
have large areas of formerly forested lands.  Similarly, significant areas of
formerly cultivated areas have been abandoned and reverted to forest,
particularly in the United States.
b) Pasture/hay: permanent pastures which are either grazed and/or
harvested for hay.  Can occupy a significant land area in dairy and
livestock producing areas and also occur on areas which have limitations
for use as cropland, including hilly terrain and areas with poor drainage.
c) Intensive grain production: dominated by production of food and
feedgrains for trade, including maize, soybean, wheat, oats as well as
potato and root crops.  In general these systems receive high inputs of
fertiliser and other agrochemicals and are highly mechanised.  For
inventory purposes, sub-classification into systems according to organic
matter inputs (and residue management) and tillage practices is
recommended.
• Contrasting carbon input level-high residue input systems would
include one or more of the following practices: significant manure or
sewage sludge applications, crop rotations which include multiple
years of perennial hay crops, double-cropping, and use of winter
cover crops that are returned to the soil.  Nominal input systems
would include grain production systems with normal rates of
fertilisation and residues returned to the soil.  Low residue input
systems would include grain production where residues are removed
from the soil.
• Tillage practices - separate categories could be included for no-till,
reduced tillage and full (intensive tillage).  Reduced tillage would
include practices with infrequent and minimal and shallow soil
disturbance.  Full tillage refers to tillage where there is substantial
soil inversion and mixing (e.g., moldboard ploughing) of the A
horizon as well as secondary tillage.
d) Speciality crop production: includes systems which are dominated by
intensively managed non-grain crops, such as tobacco, cotton, peanuts,
truck (vegetable) crops, in which most of the biomass produced is
removed from the field or where there is otherwise low rates of
residues returned.

e) Reverted land: includes former agricultural land which has been taken
out of production and either converted or allowed to revert to
perennial grass or forest vegetation.  Subdivisions according to "age
classes" or successional stages is recommended for specifying soil carbon
contents.
5.   TROPICAL, DRY
Characterised by MAT above 20°C and annual precipitation
generally below 1000 mm with a long and pronounced dry season
that results in a growing season of limited length.  Soils are highly
variable, e.g., high activity Vertisols (India) Lateritic Alfisols (Africa) and
highly acid Alfisols and Oxisols (South America).  Average productivity for
most common crops is low, not only due to water deficiency but also due
to nutrient deficiencies which are not corrected by fertilisation because
fertiliser investment is risky in a drought-prone zone.
a) Savanna: the natural vegetation climax in this zone.  The cover by woody
plants can range from none to virtually complete, although the average is
less than 30 per cent.  Increases in woody cover often result from
sustained grazing pressure and the exclusion of fire; depletion of woody
cover results from unsustainable demand for firewood.  The carbon
density of the system is strongly affected by the amount of tree cover,
both through the tree biomass and through elevated soil organic matter
below the canopy.  Main use is grazing.  In grass-dominated regions,
extensive grazing of cattle with no pasture management (e.g., Llanos in
Venezuela and Colombia).  Productivity is low (stocking rates at 10-20
ha/animal) and endangered by overgrazing and desertification.  In grass
and shrub regions, extensive grazing and migratory herding with no
management and often serious overstocking with cattle, goats and sheep
(e.g., Sahel) occurs.
b) Subsistence farming with drought-resistant grain crops: millet and
sorghum are staples for subsistence farmers, who may also plant maize
in wetter years.  Includes Latifundia in which slash-burning and arable
production relies on sharecroppers.  Mixed cropping with 5-10
intercropped crops is typical.  After 3-8 years of cropping, areas are
rotated through bush fallow, which is often extensively grazed or
browsed.  Common throughout the South American and Southern
African dry zone.  An African variant of Latifundia is village-owned land
where arable use rights are conferred to families. This system has shown
great stability (>600 years in West Africa) but is crumbling under
population pressure.  Also includes small owner-operator farms that rely
on family labour.  When yields are low, rotation of cropped areas
requires a large landholding to permit bush fallowing or, otherwise land
may be abandoned in shifting cultivation.
c) Irrigated cropping: where river or groundwater are available, a wide
range of cash crops can be grown, including maize, sugarcane, citrus and
tropical fruits, vegetables, tobacco and cotton.

6 and 7. TROPICAL, MOIST WITH LONG, AND SHORT DRY
SEASONS
MAT above 20°C and annual precipitation between 1000 to 2000
mm.  Can be subdivided into regions with long dry season (> 5 months)
versus short dry season of < 5 months.  Production varies with
precipitation amount and dry season length with an increasing importance
of high input, mechanised agriculture in the more humid areas on suitable
soils.  Crop production is seasonal but two crops can often be produced in
a year in more humid areas.  The soils in the drier regions may be more
fertile, and with higher pH, due to less weathered soils.  These zones
includes large areas of Africa, the majority of the India
subcontinent and continental Southeast Asia, and pockets in Latin
America and Australia.
a) Forests: vegetation is often described as tropical deciduous, or tropical
dry forests, the canopy becoming more completely deciduous as the
length of the dry season increases, fires are common in drier habitats
and mixtures of deciduous and evergreens occur at the wetter extreme.
b) Unimproved grazing: extensive livestock grazing, often in combination
with crop production on adjacent areas in subsistence agriculture, where
manure from grazing livestock is utilised.
c) Improved grazing: at the higher end of the rainfall range, pastures may
be improved through species selection, weed control, and fertilisation,
and reach higher productivity.
d) Shifting cultivation and fallow rotation systems: burns are more
complete than the more humid regions due to prolonged dry seasons
resulting in more biomass combusted and lower carbon stocks, a
cropping phase (2-3 years) may be longer with respect to the fallow
phase (10 years) as compared to more humid regions but fallow
reaccumulation is slower particularly on infertile soils.  Much of the land
in Africa has shifted to more continuous cultivation while large tracts of
Southeast Asia and India could still be classified as shifting cultivation.  In
some cases, lands have degraded due to increasingly short fallow
intervals and derived savannas have replaced natural succession to
deciduous forest.
e) Mixed continuous cropping (manual): this is the most prevalent land use
in this zone in Africa and has replaced large areas of land previously used
for shifting agriculture over the past 50 years.  These farming systems
occupy some of the most densely populated agricultural landscapes in
the tropics consisting of mixtures of annual field crops (maize, beans)
and perennials (banana, coffee, sugarcane).  Crop residues are regarded
as an important component of yield as animal feed to confined livestock
but manure and composting strategies are often very advanced.
Nonetheless, soil carbon stocks in highland cropping systems have
dropped to less than 50 per cent of their original levels.
f) Mechanised continuous cropping (residue management): continuous
mechanised cropping became a major land use in Asia with the advent of
the Green Revolution.  Major crops are rice and wheat, and the degree
of residue return varies greatly with either burning residues and
complete removal for animal feed common, but a trend toward residue
incorporation is increasing as burning is prohibited.  Some parts of Latin

America have converted native deciduous forest to mechanical
continuous cultivation of soybean, rice and maize.
g) Plantations: the plantations of the tropics are generally located in this
zone and the subhumid zone with a shorter dry season, teak plantations
being the most renowned.  Other plantations include coffee, tea and
pineapple.  One trend which has reduced carbon stocks in coffee is the
conversion of shade coffee, with its accompanying shade trees, to sun
grown coffee.
h) Irrigated cropping: can include crops similar to that described for the
semi-arid zone as well as wetland rice.  Only one crop per year of
wetland rice is possible where there is an extended dry season.  This is
probably the dominant cropping system in India and Southeast Asia but
is seldom found in Africa or Latin America.
8.   TROPICAL, WET
Characterised by MAT of above 20°C and annual precipitation >
2000 mm, with no significant dry season.  Crop production is
generally limited by low soil fertility and soil acidity on heavily leached soils
and/or by rapid invasion of weeds such as Imperata.  Exceptions are the
fertile soils of recent volcanic origin and the rice paddies, which often
benefit from sediments eroded from the uplands.  Perennial-based
production systems are the most sustainable land use.  Covers substantial
parts of South America (the Amazon basin), equatorial Africa and
Southeast Asia.
a) Forest: the natural climax vegetation in this zone, with the highest
biodiversity of the world.  Forest degradation and soil damage can occur
due to logging impacts, especially on skidding trails and roads; non-climax
natural vegetation often occurs in mosaics with “shifting cultivation” and
is dealt with under that category.
b) Agroforests and other mixed perennial (multi-strata) systems: human-
made, diverse forest-like vegetation with a mixture of useful trees and
elements of the natural vegetation; ecological functions, such as soil C
storage, are close to those of natural secondary forests of similar age;
this land use category is often not (yet) recognised in the available
statistics.
c) Intensive upland food crop production with all crop residues maintained:
mechanised or based or human labour, intensive food crop production
while retaining all crop residues and providing sufficient nutrient inputs
can maintain adequate soil organic matter levels and meet sustainable
production targets.  This group includes intensive vegetable production
at higher elevations, unless soil erosion is dominant.
d) Monoculture plantations of perennial crops: monospecific stands of
perennial crops (e.g., industrial trees, rubber, oil palm, coconut,
sugarcane, pineapple); generally intermediate levels of soil organic
matter, depending on residue management.  Substantial differences in
soil organic carbon with sugarcane occur, as on part of the area all
residues are (still) burned after harvest, while on others they are
incorporated into the soil.

e) Shifting cultivation and fallow rotation systems: a very broad group of
land-use systems, based on a few years of crop production with declining
soil organic carbon contents and a “recovery” fallow period of a few
years (short (bush) fallow rotation systems) or longer (long fallow
rotation and classical shifting cultivation, based on secondary forest
succession).  Calculations of C stocks should be based on a weighted
average of the currently cropped fields and the fallow vegetation.  In
Southeast Asia, the system can be an early stage of “agroforest”
development, but can also lead to “degraded grasslands”.
f) Improved pastures: with the use of introduced grasses, a sufficient
legume component, adequate soil fertility maintenance and carefully
managed animal stocking rates, soil organic carbon can be maintained
close to that of the forests which were replaced.
g) Degraded pastures and frequently burnt grasslands: low amounts of
organic inputs due to burning or physical damage to the standing
vegetation lead to a decrease in soil organic carbon.
h) Wetland or paddy rice fields, on a range of soils: variation occurs in the
number of rice crops per year, the presence or absence of a dry period
(with or without dryland food crops) during which soil organic carbon
decomposes rapidly, and the burning, removal or incorporation of crop
residues will affect organic carbon levels.
