Figure 1:  Estimation of Aircraft Emissions with the Tier 2 Method
To use the Tier 2 method, the aircraft types used for both domestic and international
aviation, as well as the number of LTO’s carried out with the various aircraft types, must
be known.  If such information is available, it is recommended that the emission factors in
Table 1-52 be used.  If information on LTO’s is not available, it is recommended that the
Tier 1 method be used.
