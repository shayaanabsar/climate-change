emission factor must include all necessary components, such as
heating of calcium carbonate, reduction of lime and/or use of

emissions from lime production, if lime is produced at a different
plant from the calcium carbide.

2.12 Production of Ot her Chemicals
I n t r o d u c t i o n
The production of other chemicals such as carbon black, styrene,
polyvinylchloride, sulphuric acid, etc. can be sources of CH4, N2O, NOx,
NMVOC, CO and SO2.
D a t a  S o u r c e s
International production data are available from the United Nations (1988)
and from the US Bureau of Mines (1988). The Standard Nomenclature for
Air Pollution (SNAP) (EMEP/CORINAIR, 1996) codes for the processes are
given in the tables.

Although most CH4 sources from industrial processes individually are small,
collectively they may be significant.
Few data on emission factors are presently available.  These are presented in
Table 2-9 (see the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas
Inventories Reference Manual for sources).

This section is concerned with emissions from small point sources.  Total
national emissions from these sources may be important and a simple
methodology is suggested here.
A summary of default emission factors, as well as emission factor ranges
where applicable, is provided in Table 2-10.  Ranges given for NMVOC
emissions from many processes are quite large.  Emission factors are likely
to be quite process specific.

2.13 Metal Production
I n t r o d u c t i o n
The preferred methodology (Tier 1a) for the estimation of emissions of CO2
from all types of metal production is given in Section 2.13.1.  This method
requires information on the quantity of reducing agent used.  If this
information is not available, methodologies (Tier 1b) for estimating emissions
of CO2 based on the metal production quantities are given in the following
sections pertaining to particular metals.
D a t a  S o u r c e s
International production data are available from the United Nations (1988)
and from the US Bureau of Mines (1988). The Standard Nomenclature of Air
Pollution (SNAP) number for reheating furnaces iron and steel is 30302; gray
iron foundries is 30303; production processes - iron & steel industries &
collieries is 40200; coke oven is 40201; blast furnace charging is 40202; pig
iron tapping is 40203; solid smokeless fuel is 40204; open hearth furnace
steel plant is 40205; basic oxygen furnace is 40206; electric furnace steel
plant is 40207; rolling mills is 40208; ferroalloys is 40302; ferroalloy
production is 40302; aluminium production is 40301; non-ferrous metal
industry is 40300(EMEP/CORINAIR, 1996).

Parsons (1977) and ORTECH (1994) have studied the consumption of
carbon at iron and steel production facilities.  These results have been
summarised by Environment Canada 1996.  A CO2 emission factor is shown
in Table 2-12.

a Includes CO2 produced by coke and coke oven gas consumption.  It does not include any
form of conventional energy consumption.  The emission factor applies to both iron or iron
plus steel production, since uncertainty in the estimates overshadow the sincremental
difference in CO2 emissions.
b Environment Canada has reported an emission factor of approximately 1.5 tonnes CO2
/tonne iron or steel for a non-integrated facility.  This is, however, a rather uncertain value.
Note:  Figures exclude CO2 from flux (CaCO3) consumption.
DOUBLE COUNTING
Additional emissions occur as the
limestone flux gives off carbon
dioxide during reduction of pig iron
in the blast furnace.  This source is
covered as emissions from limestone
use in Section 2.5. Care should be
taken not to double count these
emissions.

Emissions from iron and steel may originate from various stages of the
production process.  These are described in the tables below.  Most of the
emissions from rolling mills are from the fuel used to heat the process.
However, cold-rolling will emit a range of gases in addition to the emissions
from fuel combustion.

Ferroalloy production involves a metallurgical reduction process which
results in significant carbon dioxide emissions.
Primary emissions in covered arc furnaces consist almost entirely of CO as
opposed to CO2, due to the strong reducing environment (ORTECH, 1994).
All CO is assumed, however, to be converted to CO2,  within days
afterwards.

Primary aluminium is produced in two steps.  First bauxite ore is ground,
purified and calcined to produce alumina.  Following this, the alumina is
electrically reduced to aluminium by smelting in large pots.
Most carbon dioxide is evolved from the reaction of the carbon anode with
alumina, but some is formed as the anode reacts with other sources of
oxygen (especially air).  This occurs during cell operation and, in the case of
prebaked electrodes, during anode production at the aluminium plant.

CO2 may be estimated from the production volume of primary metal and
the specific consumption of carbon.  Emissions factors for CO2 are

Two PFCs, carbon tetrafluoride (CF4) and carbon hexafluoride (C2F6), are
known to be emitted from the process of primary aluminium smelting.
Tier 1a - Measured Emission Data
The Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories
Reference Manual gives details on the variability of emissions of PFCs. Since
emissions of CF4 and C2F6 vary so significantly from one aluminium smelter
to the next, depending on cell type and anode effects (AE) parameters, the
estimations will be highly uncertain unless actual emission measurements
have been made.
Tier 1b - Calculation of Emission Data
It is recognised that measurements are both expensive and time-consuming.
It may, however, be much easier to make a limited survey of AE frequency
and duration at smelters.  In such cases, it is recommended that specific CF4
emissions for anode effects longer than 2 minutes are calculated as follows
(based on the method developed by Tabereaux 1995):

PFC emissions estimates have been reported in several studies.  These are

The estimates should be used only when no measured data exist.  Specific
emission factors should be chosen according to the type of technology used
as shown in Table 2-20 and applied to national primary aluminium
production data for each technology.  The following equation may then be
used to give an estimate of the annual CF4 emissions from a smelter with a

Emissions of NOx, CO and SO2 can be estimated from the amount of
aluminium produced.  Emissions may originate from the production process
and baking of anodes.  No distinction between the Søderberg and prebaked
method is given in the EMEP/CORINAIR Guidebook (SNAP 40301).  The
suggested emission factors are shown in Table 2-21.  No information is given

Tier 1a
See Section 2.13.1 if quantity of reducing agent is known.
Tier 1b
This includes production of all non-ferrous metals except aluminium.  The
metals may be produced using carbon as reducing agents or by other
methodologies.
Whether carbon is emitted or not depends on the production process.
Some ores are not reduced with carbon. Hence, CO2 emissions from these
processes are low. The general methodology suggested where emissions are
calculated from the consumption of reducing agents and the carbon content
of ores is recommended. An overview of production processes is given in
Table 2-22. Some metals may be produced from alternative production
methods.
CARBONATE ORES
In the case of magnesium and other
metals in a carbonate ore, the
carbon emitted from the ore should
be taken into account in addition to
the coke reducing agent.

consumption:

2.14 Pulp and Paper Indust ries
I n t r o d u c t i o n
The production of pulp and paper involves three major processing steps:
pulping, bleaching and paper production. The type of pulping and the amount
of bleaching used depends on the nature of the feedstock and the desired
quality of the end product.
There are two main processes: Kraft (sulphate) pulping, the most widely
used, and Sulphite pulping. Sulphite pulping may be divided into the acid
Sulphite process and the neutral sulphite semi-chemical process.

If site-specific emission data are not available, the emission estimates can be
based on the total annual production of dried pulp. The production would
have to be broken down by kraft, acid sulphite and neutral sulphite
processes.

There are at least four types of acid sulphite process: ammonium-based

(US EPA, 1995).  Emissions factors from US EPA, 1995 are given in Table 2-

The preferred methodology is to use continuous measurements data which
may be available for NOx and SO2.  This is only feasible in modern plants
where the number of measurement points to be monitored is limited.
