Executive Summary
This special report assesses new knowledge since the IPCC 5th 
Assessment Report (AR5) and the Special Report on Global Warming 
of 1.5ºC (SR15) on how the ocean and cryosphere have and are 
expected to change with ongoing global warming, the risks and 
opportunities these changes bring to ecosystems and people, 
and   mitigation, adaptation and governance options for reducing 
future risks. Chapter 1 provides context on the importance of the 
ocean and cryosphere, and the framework for the assessments in 
subsequent chapters of the report.
All people on Earth depend directly or indirectly on the 
ocean and cryosphere. The fundamental roles of the ocean and 
cryosphere in the Earth system include the uptake and redistribution 
of anthropogenic carbon dioxide and heat by the ocean, as well as 
their crucial involvement of in the hydrological cycle. The cryosphere 
also ampliﬁes climate changes through snow, ice and permafrost 
feedbacks. Services provided to people by the ocean and/or 
cryosphere include food and freshwater, renewable energy, health 
and wellbeing, cultural values, trade and transport. {1.1, 1.2, 1.5}
Sustainable development is at risk from emerging and 
intensifying ocean and cryosphere changes. Ocean and 
cryosphere changes interact with each of the United Nations 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Progress on climate action 
(SDG 13) would reduce risks to aspects of sustainable development 
that are fundamentally linked to the ocean and cryosphere and 
the services they provide (high conﬁdence1). Progress on achieving the 
SDGs can contribute to reducing the exposure or vulnerabilities of 
people and communities to the risks of ocean and cryosphere change 
(medium conﬁdence). {1.1}
Communities living in close connection with polar, mountain, 
and coastal environments are particularly exposed to the 
current and future hazards of ocean and cryosphere change. 
Coasts are home to approximately 28% of the global population, 
including around 11% living on land less than 10 m above sea level. 
Almost 10% of the global population lives in the Arctic or high 
mountain regions. People in these regions face the greatest exposure 
to ocean and cryosphere change, and poor and marginalised people 
here are particularly vulnerable to climate-related hazards and risks 
(very high conﬁdence). The adaptive capacity of people, communities 
and nations is shaped by social, political, cultural, economic, 
technological, institutional, geographical and demographic factors.

In this report, the following summary terms are used to describe the available evidence: limited, medium, or robust; and for the degree of agreement: low, medium or 
high. A level of conﬁdence is expressed using ﬁve qualiﬁers: very low, low, medium, high and very high, and typeset in italics, for example, medium conﬁdence. For a given 
evidence and agreement statement, different conﬁdence levels can be assigned, but increasing levels of evidence and degrees of agreement are correlated with increasing 
conﬁdence (see Section 1.9.2 and Figure 1.4 for more details).

In this report, the following terms have been used to indicate the assessed likelihood of an outcome or a result: Virtually certain 99–100% probability, Very likely 90–100%, 
Likely 66–100%, About as likely as not 33–66%, Unlikely 0–33%, Very unlikely 0–10%, and Exceptionally unlikely 0–1%. Additional terms (Extremely likely: 95–100%, 
More likely than not >50–100%, and Extremely unlikely 0–5%) may also be used when appropriate. Assessed likelihood is typeset in italics, for example, very likely 
(see Section 1.9.2 and Figure 1.4 for more details). This Report also uses the term ‘likely range’ to indicate that the assessed likelihood of an outcome lies within the 
17–83% probability range.
Ocean and cryosphere changes are pervasive and observed 
from high mountains, to the polar regions, to coasts, and into 
the deep ocean. AR5 assessed that the ocean is warming (0 to 
700 m: virtually certain2; 700 to 2,000 m: likely), sea level is rising 
(high conﬁdence), and ocean acidity is increasing (high conﬁdence). 
Most glaciers are shrinking (high conﬁdence), the Greenland and 
Antarctic ice sheets are losing mass (high conﬁdence), sea ice extent in 
the Arctic is decreasing (very high conﬁdence), Northern Hemisphere 
snow cover is decreasing (very high conﬁdence), and permafrost 
temperatures are increasing (high conﬁdence). Improvements 
since AR5 in observation systems, techniques, reconstructions and 
model developments, have advanced scientiﬁc characterisation 
and understanding of ocean and cryosphere change, including in 
previously identiﬁed areas of concern such as ice sheets and Atlantic 
Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). {1.1, 1.4, 1.8.1}
Evidence and understanding of the human causes of climate 
warming, and of associated ocean and cryosphere changes, 
has increased over the past 30 years of IPCC assessments (very 
high conﬁdence). Human activities are estimated to have caused 
approximately 1.0ºC of global warming above pre-industrial levels 
(SR15). Areas of concern in earlier IPCC reports, such as the expected 
acceleration of sea level rise, are now observed (high conﬁdence). 
Evidence for expected slow-down of AMOC is emerging in sustained 
observations and from long-term palaeoclimate reconstructions 
(medium conﬁdence), and may be related with anthropogenic forcing 
according to model simulations, although this remains to be properly 
attributed. Signiﬁcant sea level rise contributions from Antarctic ice 
sheet mass loss (very high conﬁdence), which earlier reports did not 
expect to manifest this century, are already being observed. {1.1, 1.4}
Ocean and cryosphere changes and risks by the end-of-century 
(2081–2100) will be larger under high greenhouse gas emission 
scenarios, compared with low emission scenarios (very high 
conﬁdence). Projections and assessments of future climate, ocean 
and cryosphere changes in the Special Report on the Ocean and 
Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) are commonly based 
on coordinated climate model experiments from the Coupled Model 
Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) forced with Representative 
Concentration Pathways (RCPs) of future radiative forcing. Current 
emissions continue to grow at a rate consistent with a high emission 
future without effective climate change mitigation policies (referred 
to as RCP8.5). The SROCC assessment contrasts this high greenhouse 
gas emission future with a low greenhouse gas emission, high 
mitigation future (referred to as RCP2.6) that gives a two in three 
chance of limiting warming by the end of the century to less than 2oC 
above pre-industrial. {Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1}

Characteristics of ocean and cryosphere change include 
thresholds of abrupt change, long-term changes that cannot be 
avoided, and irreversibility (high conﬁdence). Ocean warming, 
acidiﬁcation and deoxygenation, ice sheet and glacier mass loss, and 
permafrost degradation are expected to be irreversible on time scales 
relevant to human societies and ecosystems. Long response times 
of decades to millennia mean that the ocean and cryosphere are 
committed to long-term change even after atmospheric greenhouse 
gas concentrations and radiative forcing stabilise (high conﬁdence). 
Ice-melt or the thawing of permafrost involve thresholds (state 
changes) that allow for abrupt, nonlinear responses to ongoing 
climate warming (high conﬁdence). These characteristics of ocean 
and cryosphere change pose risks and challenges to adaptation.  
{1.1, Box 1.1, 1.3}
Societies will be exposed, and challenged to adapt, to changes 
in the ocean and cryosphere even if current and future efforts 
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions keep global warming well 
below 2ºC (very high conﬁdence). Ocean and cryosphere-related 
mitigation and adaptation measures include options that address 
the causes of climate change, support biological and ecological 
adaptation, or enhance societal adaptation. Most ocean-based local 
mitigation and adaptation measures have limited effectiveness to 
mitigate climate change and reduce its consequences at the global 
scale, but are useful to implement because they address local risks, 
often have co-beneﬁts such as biodiversity conservation, and have 
few adverse side effects. Effective mitigation at a global scale 
will reduce the need and cost of adaptation, and reduce the risks 
of surpassing limits to adaptation. Ocean-based carbon dioxide 
removal at the global scale has potentially large negative ecosystem 
consequences. {1.6.1, 1.6.2, Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 1}
The scale and cross-boundary dimensions of changes in the 
ocean and cryosphere challenge the ability of communities, 
cultures and nations to respond effectively within existing 
governance 
frameworks 
(high 
conﬁdence). 
Profound 
economic and institutional transformations are needed 
if climate-resilient development is to be achieved (high 
conﬁdence). Changes in the ocean and cryosphere, the ecosystem 
services that they provide, the drivers of those changes, and the risks 
to marine, coastal, polar and mountain ecosystems, occur on spatial 
and temporal scales that may not align within existing governance 
structures and practices (medium conﬁdence). This report highlights 
the requirements for transformative governance, international and 
transboundary cooperation, and greater empowerment of local 
communities in the governance of the ocean, coasts, and cryosphere 
in a changing climate. {1.5, 1.7, Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 1, 
Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 1}
Robust assessments of ocean and cryosphere change, and the 
development of context-speciﬁc governance and response 
options, depend on utilising and strengthening all available 
knowledge systems (high conﬁdence). Scientiﬁc knowledge from 
observations, models and syntheses provides global to local scale 
understandings of climate change (very high conﬁdence). Indigenous 
knowledge (IK) and local knowledge (LK) provide context-speciﬁc and 
socio-culturally relevant understandings for effective responses and 
policies (medium conﬁdence). Education and climate literacy enable 
climate action and adaptation (high conﬁdence). {1.8, Cross-Chapter 
Box 4 in Chapter 1} 
Long-term sustained observations and continued modelling 
are critical for detecting, understanding and predicting ocean 
and cryosphere change, providing the knowledge to inform 
risk assessments and adaptation planning (high conﬁdence). 
Knowledge gaps exist in scientiﬁc knowledge for important regions, 
parameters and processes of ocean and cryosphere change, including 
for physically plausible, high impact changes like high end sea level 
rise scenarios that would be costly if realised without effective 
adaptation planning and even then may exceed limits to adaptation. 
Means such as expert judgement, scenario building, and invoking 
multiple lines of evidence enable comprehensive risk assessments 
even in cases of uncertain future ocean and cryosphere changes.

1.1 
Why this Special Report?
All people depend directly or indirectly on the ocean and cryosphere 
(see FAQ1.1). Coasts are the most densely populated areas on Earth. 
As of 2010, 28% of the global population (1.9 billion people) were 
living in areas less than 100 km from the coastline and less than 
100 m above sea level, including 17 major cities which are each home 
to more than 5 million people (Kummu et al., 2016). Small Island 
Developing States are together home to around 65 million people 
(UN, 2015a). The low elevation coastal zone (land less than 10 m 
above sea level), where people and infrastructure are most exposed 
to coastal hazards, is currently home to around 11% of the global 
population (around 680 million people), and by 2050 the population 
in this zone is projected to grow to more than one billion under all 
Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) (Section  4.3.3.2; Merkens 
et al., 2016; O’Neill et al., 2017). In 2010, approximately 4 million 
people lived in the Arctic (Section 3.5.1), and an increase of only 
4% is projected for 2030 (Heleniak, 2014) compared to 16–23% 
for the global population increase (O’Neill et al., 2017). Almost 10% 
of the global population (around 670 million people) lived in high 
mountain regions in 2010, and by 2050 the population in these 
regions is expected to grow to between 736–844 million across the 
SSPs (Section 2.1). For people living in close contact with the ocean 
and cryosphere, these systems provide essential livelihoods, food 
security, well-being and cultural identity, but are also a source of 
hazards (Sections 1.5.1, 1.5.2). 
Even people living far from the ocean or cryosphere depend on these 
systems. Snow and glacier melt from high mountains helps to sustain 
the rivers that deliver water resources to downstream populations 
(Kaser et al., 2010; Sharma et al., 2019). In the Indus and Ganges river 
basins, for example, snow and glacier melt provides enough water to 
grow food crops to sustain a balanced diet for 38 million people, and 
supports the livelihoods of 129 million farmers (Biemans et al., 2019). 
The ocean and cryosphere regulate global climate and weather; the 
ocean is the primary source of rain and snowfall needed to sustain 
life on land, and uptake of heat and carbon into the ocean has so 
far limited the magnitude of anthropogenic warming experienced at 
the Earth’s surface (Section 1.2). The ocean’s biosphere is responsible 
for about half of the primary production on Earth, and around 17% 
of the non-grain protein in human diets is derived from the ocean 
(FAO, 2018). Communities far from the coast can also be exposed 
to changes in the ocean through extreme weather events. Ocean 
and cryosphere changes can result in differing consequences and 
beneﬁts on local to global scales; for example, declining sea ice in 
the Arctic is allowing access to shorter international shipping routes 
but restricting traditional sea ice based travel for Arctic communities. 
Human activities are estimated to have so far caused approximately 
1ºC of global warming (0.8ºC–1.2ºC likely range; above pre-industrial 
levels; IPCC, 2018). The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) 
concluded that, ‘Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and 
since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented 
over decades to millennia. The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, 
the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, sea level has risen, 
and the concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased’ (IPCC, 
2013). Subsequently, Parties to the Paris Agreement aimed to 
strengthen the global response to the threats of climate change, 
including by ‘holding the increase in global average temperature  
to well below 2ºC above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to 
limit the temperature increase to 1.5ºC’ (UNFCCC, 2015).
Pervasive ocean and cryosphere changes that are already being 
caused by human-induced climate change are observed from high 
mountains, to the polar regions, to coasts and into the deep reaches 
of the ocean. Changes by the end of this century are expected to 
be larger under high greenhouse gas emission futures compared 
with low-emission futures (Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1), and 
inaction on reducing emissions will have large economic costs. 
If human impacts on the ocean continue unabated, declines in 
ocean health and services are projected to cost the global economy 
428 billion USD yr–1 by 2050, and 1.979 trillion USD yr–1 by 2100. 
Alternatively, steps to reduce these impacts could save more than 
a trillion dollars USD yr–1 by 2100 (Ackerman, 2013). Similarly, sea 
level rise scenarios of 25 to 123 cm by 2100 without adaptation 
are expected to see 0.2–4.6% of the global population impacted by 
coastal ﬂooding annually, with average annual losses amounting  
to 0.3–9.3% of global GDP. Investment in adaptation reduces by 2 to 
3 orders of magnitude the number of people ﬂooded and the losses 
caused (Hinkel et al., 2014).
The United Nations 2030 SDGs (UN, 2015b) are all connected 
to varying extents with the ocean and cryosphere (see FAQ1.2). 
Climate action (SDG 13) would limit future ocean and cryosphere 
changes (high conﬁdence; Cross-Chapter Box  1 in Chapter  1, 
Figure 1.5, Chapter 2 to 6), and would reduce risks to SDGs that 
are fundamentally linked to the ocean and cryosphere, including life 
below water, and clean water and sanitation. (Sections 2.4, 4.4, 5.4; 
Szabo et al., 2016; LeBlanc et al., 2017; Singh et al., 2018; Visbeck, 
2018; Wymann von Dach et al., 2018; Kulonen, Accepted). Other 
goals for sustainable development depend on the services the ocean 
and cryosphere provide or are impacted by ocean and cryosphere 
change; including, life on land, health and wellbeing, eradicating 
poverty and hunger, economic growth, clean energy, infrastructure, 
and sustainable cities and communities. Progress on the other 
SDGs (education, gender equality, reduced inequalities, responsible 
consumption, strong institutions, and partnerships for the goals) are 
important for reducing the vulnerability of people and communities 
to the risks of ocean and cryosphere changes (Section 1.5; 2.3), and 
for supporting mitigation and adaptation responses (Sections 1.6, 1.7 
and 1.8.3; medium conﬁdence). 
The characteristics of ocean and cryosphere change (Section  1.3) 
present particular challenges to climate-resilient development 
pathways (CRDPs). Ocean acidiﬁcation and deoxygenation, ice sheet 
and glacier mass loss, and permafrost degradation are expected to be 
irreversible on time scales relevant to human societies and ecosystems 
(Lenton et al., 2008; Solomon et al., 2009; Frölicher and Joos, 2010; 
Cai et al., 2016; Kopp et al., 2016). Ocean and cryosphere changes 
also have the potential to worsen anthropogenic climate change, 
globally and regionally; for example, by additional greenhouse gas 
emissions released through permafrost thaw that would intensify 
anthropogenic climate change globally, or by increasing the 
absorption of solar radiation through snow and ice loss in the Arctic 
Chapter 1

that is causing regional climate to warm at more than twice the 
global rate (AMAP, 2017; Steffen et al., 2018). Ocean and cryosphere 
changes place particular pressures on the adaptive capacities of 
cultures who maintain centuries to millennia-old relationships to 
the planet’s polar, mountain, and coastal environments, as well as 
on cities, states and nations whose territorial boundaries are being 
transformed by ongoing sea level rise (Gerrard and Wannier, 2013). 
The scale and cross-boundary dimensions of changes in the ocean 
and cryosphere challenge the ability of current local, regional and 
international governance structures to respond (Section  1.7). 
Profound economic and institutional transformations are needed if 
climate-resilient development is to be achieved, including ambitious 
mitigation efforts to avoid the risks of large-scale and abrupt ocean 
and cryosphere changes. 
The commissioning of this IPCC special report recognises the 
interconnected ways in which the ocean and cryosphere are expected 
to change in a warming climate. SROCC assesses new knowledge 
since AR5 and provides an integrated approach across IPCC working 
groups I and II, linking physical changes with their ecological and 
human impacts, and the strategies to respond and adapt to future 
risks. It is one of three special reports being produced by the IPCC 
during its Sixth Assessment Cycle (in addition to the three working 
groups’ main assessment reports). The concurrent IPCC Special 
Report on Climate Change and Land (released August 2019) links to 
SROCC where terrestrial environments and their habitability interact 
closely with the ocean or cryosphere, such as in mountain, Arctic, 
and coastal regions. SR15 concluded that human-induced warming 
will reach 1.5ºC between 2030–2052 if it continues to increase at 
the current rate (high conﬁdence), and that there are widespread 
beneﬁts to human and natural systems of limiting warming to 1.5oC 
compared with 2oC or more (high conﬁdence; IPCC, 2018). 
Box 1.1 |  Major Components and Characteristics of the Ocean and Cryosphere
Ocean
The global ocean is the interconnected body of saline water that encompasses polar to equatorial climate zones and covers 71% of the 
Earth surface. It includes the Arctic, Paciﬁc, Atlantic, Indian and Southern Oceans, as well as their marginal seas. The ocean contains 
about 97% of the Earth’s water, supplies 99% of the Earth’s biologically habitable space, and provides roughly half of the primary 
production on Earth. 
Coasts are where ocean and land processes interact, and includes coastal cities, deltas, estuaries, and other coastal ecosystems 
such as mangrove forests. Low elevation coastal zones (less than 10 m above sea level) are densely populated and particularly exposed 
to hazards from the ocean (Chapters 4 to 6, Cross-Chapter Box 9). Moving into the ocean, the continental shelf represents the shallow 
ocean areas (depth <200 m) that surround continents and islands, before the seaﬂoor descends at the continental slope into the deep 
ocean. The edge of the continental shelf is often used to identify the coastal ocean from the open ocean. Ocean depth and distance from 
the coast may inﬂuence the governance and economic access that applies to ocean areas (Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 1). 
The average depth of the global ocean is about 3,700 m, with a maximum depth of more than 10,000 m. The ocean is vertically 
stratiﬁed with less dense water sitting above more dense layers, determined by the seawater temperature, salinity and pressure. The 
surface of the ocean is in direct contact with the atmosphere, except for sea ice covered regions. Sunlight penetrates the water column 
and supports primary production (by phytoplankton) down to 50–200 m depth (epipelagic zone). Atmospheric-driven mixing occurs 
from the sea surface and into the mesopelagic zone (200–1,000 m). The distinction between the upper ocean and deep ocean depends 
on the processes being considered. 
The ocean is a fundamental climate regulator on seasonal to millennial time scales. Seawater has a heat capacity four times larger 
than air and holds vast quantities of dissolved carbon. Heat, water, and biogeochemically relevant gases (e.g., O2 and CO2) exchange 
at the air-sea interface, and ocean currents and mixing caused by winds, tides, wave dynamics, density differences and turbulence 
redistribute these throughout the global ocean (Box 1.1, Figure 1). 
Cryosphere
The cryosphere refers to frozen components of the Earth system that are at or below the land and ocean surface. These include snow, 
glaciers, ice sheets, ice shelves, icebergs, sea ice, lake ice, river ice, permafrost and seasonally frozen ground. Cryosphere is widespread 
in polar regions (Chapter 3) and high mountains (Chapter 2), and changes in the cryosphere can have far-reaching and even global 
impacts (Chapters 2 to 6, Cross-Chapter Box 9). 
Snow is common in polar and mountain regions. It can ultimately either melt seasonally or transform into ice layers that build glaciers 
and ice sheets. Snow feeds groundwater and river runoff together with glacier melt causes natural hazards (avalanches, rain-on-snow 
ﬂood events) and is a critical economic resource for hydropower and tourism. Snow plays a major role in maintaining high mountain 
and Arctic ecosystems, affects the Earth’s energy budget by reﬂecting solar radiation (albedo effect), and inﬂuences the temperature 
of underlying permafrost.

Box 1.1 (continued)
Ice sheets and glaciers are land-based ice, built up by accumulating snowfall on their surface. Presently, around 10% of Earth’s 
land area is covered by glaciers or ice sheets, which in total hold about 69% of Earth’s freshwater (Gleick, 1996). Ice sheets and 
glaciers ﬂow, and at their margins ice and/or melt water is discharged into lakes, rivers or the ocean. The largest ice bodies on Earth 
are the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. Marine-based sections of ice sheets (e.g., West Antarctic Ice Sheet) sit upon bedrock that 
largely lies below sea level and are in contact with ocean heat, making them vulnerable to rapid and irreversible ice loss. Ice sheets 
and glaciers that lose more ice than they accumulate contribute to global sea level rise. 
Ice shelves are extensions of ice sheets and glaciers that ﬂoat in the surrounding ocean. The transition between the grounded part of 
an ice sheet and a ﬂoating ice shelf is called the grounding line. Changes in ice shelf size do not directly contribute to sea level rise, 
but buttressing of ice shelves restrict the ﬂow of land-based ice past the grounding line into the ocean. 
Sea ice forms from freezing of seawater, and sea ice on the ocean surface is further thickened by snow accumulation. Sea ice may be 
discontinuous pieces moved on the ocean surface by wind and currents (pack ice), or a motionless sheet attached to the coast or to ice 
shelves (fast ice). Sea ice provides many critical functions: it provides essential habitat for polar species and supports the livelihoods 
of people in the Arctic (including Indigenous peoples); regulates climate by reﬂecting solar radiation; inhibits ocean-atmosphere 
exchange of heat, momentum and gases (including CO2); supports global deep ocean circulation via dense (cold and salty) water 
formation; and aids or hinders transportation and travel routes in the polar regions. 
Permafrost is ground (soil or rock containing ice and frozen organic material) that remains at or below 0ºC for at least two consecutive 
years. It occurs on land in polar and high mountain areas, and also as submarine permafrost in shallow parts of the Arctic and Southern 
Oceans. Permafrost thickness ranges from less than 1 m to greater than 1,000 m. It usually occurs beneath an active layer, which thaws 
and freezes annually. Unlike glaciers and snow, the spatial distribution and temporal changes of permafrost cannot easily be observed. 
Permafrost thaw can cause hazards, including ground subsidence or landslides, and inﬂuence global climate through emissions of 
greenhouse gases from microbial breakdown of previously frozen organic carbon.

ice sheet mass loss, glacier mass loss, permafrost thaw and decreasing snow cover extent (Section 1.4.2). For illustration purposes, a few examples of where humans

1.2 
Role of the Ocean and Cryosphere 
in the Earth System
1.2.1 
Ocean and Cryosphere in Earth’s 
Energy, Water and Biogeochemical Cycles
The ocean and cryosphere play a key role in the Earth system. 
Powered by the Sun’s energy, large quantities of energy, water and 
biogeochemical elements (predominantly carbon, nitrogen, oxygen 
and hydrogen) are exchanged between all components of the Earth 
system, including between the ocean and cryosphere (Box  1.1, 
Figure 1). 
During an equilibrium (stable) climate state, the amount of incoming 
solar energy is balanced by an equal amount of outgoing radiation 
at the top of Earth’s atmosphere (Hansen et al., 2011). At the Earth’s 
surface energy from the Sun is transformed into various forms (heat, 
potential, latent, kinetic, and chemical), that drive weather systems 
in the atmosphere and currents in the ocean, fuel photosynthesis 
on land and in the ocean, and fundamentally determine the climate 
(Trenberth et al., 2014). The ocean has a large capacity to store 
and release heat, and the Earth’s energy budget can be effectively 
monitored through the heat content of the ocean on time scales 
longer than one year (Palmer and McNeall, 2014; von Schuckmann 
et al., 2016; Cheng et al., 2018). The large heat capacity of the ocean 
leads to different characteristics of the ocean response to external 
forcings compared with the atmosphere (Sections 1.3, 1.4). The 
reﬂective properties of snow and ice also play an important role in 
regulating climate via the albedo effect. Increased amounts of solar 
energy are absorbed when snow or ice are replaced by less reﬂective 
land or ocean surfaces, resulting in a climate change feedback 
responsible for ampliﬁed changes.
Water is exchanged between the ocean, atmosphere, land and 
cryosphere as part of the hydrological cycle driven by solar heating 
(Box 1.1, Figure 1; Trenberth et al., 2007; Lagerloef et al., 2010; Durack 
et al., 2016). Evaporation from the surface ocean is the main source of 
water in the atmosphere, which is moved back to the Earth’s surface 
as precipitation (Gimeno et al., 2012). The hydrological cycle is closed 
by the eventual return of water to the ocean by rivers, streams, and 
groundwater ﬂow, and through ice discharge and melting of ice 
sheets and glaciers (Yu, 2018). Hydrological extremes related to 
the ocean include ﬂoods from extreme rainfall (including tropical 
cyclones) or ocean circulation-related droughts (Sections 6.3, 6.5), 
while cryosphere-related ﬂooding can be caused by rapid snow melt 
and melt water discharge events (Sections 2.3, 3.4).
Ninety-two percent of the carbon on Earth that is not locked up 
in geological reservoirs (e.g., in sedimentary rocks or coal, oil and 
gas reservoirs) resides in the ocean (Sarmiento and Gruber, 2002). 
Most of this is in the form of dissolved inorganic carbon, some of 
which readily exchanges with CO2 in the overlying atmosphere. This 
represents a major control on atmospheric CO2 and makes the ocean 
and its carbon cycle one of the most important climate regulators in 
the Earth system, especially on time scales of a few hundred years 
and more (Sigman and Boyle, 2000; Berner and Kothavala, 2001). The 
ocean also contains as much organic carbon (mostly in the form of 
dissolved organic matter) as the total vegetation on land (Jiao et al., 
2010; Hansell, 2013). Primary production in the ocean, which is as 
large as that on land (Field et al., 1998), fuels complex food-webs 
that provide essential food for people. 
Ocean circulation and mixing redistribute heat and carbon over 
large distances and depths (Delworth et al., 2017). The ocean moves 
heat laterally from the tropics towards polar regions (Rhines et al., 
2008). Vertical redistribution of heat and carbon occurs where warm, 
low-density surface ocean waters transform into cool high-density 
waters that sink to deeper layers of the ocean (Talley, 2013), taking 
high carbon concentrations with them (Gruber et al., 2019). Driven 
by winds, ocean circulation also brings cold water up from deep 
layers (upwelling) in some regions, allowing heat, oxygen and carbon 
exchange between the deep ocean and the atmosphere (Oschlies 
et al., 2018; Shi et al., 2018) and fuelling biological production 
(Sarmiento and Gruber, 2006).
1.2.2 
Interactions Between the Ocean and Cryosphere
The ocean and cryosphere are interconnected in a multitude of ways 
(Box 1.1, Figure 1). Evaporation from the ocean provides snowfall 
that builds and sustains the ice sheets and glaciers that store large 
amounts of frozen water on land (Section 4.2.1). The vast ice sheets 
in Antarctica and Greenland currently hold about 66 m of potential 
global sea level rise (Fretwell et al., 2013), although the loss of a large 
fraction of this potential would require millennia of ice sheet retreat. 
Ocean temperature and sea level affect ice sheet, glacier and ice shelf 
stability in places where the base of ice bodies are in direct contact 
with ocean water (Section 3.3.1). The nonlinear response of ice-melt 
to ocean temperature changes means that even slight increases in 
ocean temperature have the potential to rapidly melt and destabilise 
large sections of an ice sheet or ice shelf (Section 3.3.1.5).
The formation of sea ice leads to the production of dense ocean 
water that contributes to the deep ocean circulation (Section 3.3.3.2). 
Paleoclimate evidence and modelling indicates that releases of large 
amounts of glacier and ice sheet melt water into the surface ocean 
can disrupt deep overturning circulation of the ocean, causing global 
climate impacts (Knutti et al., 2004; Golledge et al., 2019). Ice sheet 
melt water in the Antarctic may cause changes in surface ocean 
salinity, stratiﬁcation and circulation, that feedback to generate 
further ocean-driven melting of marine-based ice sheets (Golledge 
et al., 2019) and promote sea ice formation (Purich et al., 2018). 
The cryosphere and ocean further link through the movement of 
biogeochemical nutrients. For example, iron accumulated in sea ice 
during winter is released to the ocean during the spring and summer 
melt, helping to fuel ocean productivity in the seasonal sea ice zone 
(Tagliabue et al., 2017). Nutrient rich sediments delivered by glaciers 
further connect cryosphere processes to ocean productivity (Arrigo 
et al., 2017).

1.3 
Time Scales, Thresholds and Detection 
of Ocean and Cryosphere Change
It takes hundreds of years to millennia for the entire deep ocean 
to turn over (Matsumoto, 2007; Gebbie and Huybers, 2012), while 
renewal of the large ice sheets requires many thousands of years 
(Huybrechts and de Wolde, 1999). Long response times mean that 
the deep ocean and the large ice sheets tend to lag behind in their 
response to the rapidly changing climate at Earth’s surface, and that 
they will continue to change even after radiative forcing stabilises 
(e.g., Golledge et al., 2015; Figure 1.1a). Such ‘committed’ changes 
mean that some ocean and cryosphere changes are essentially 
irreversible on time scales relevant to human societies (decades to 
centuries), even in the presence of immediate action to limit further 
global warming (e.g., Section 4.2.3.5). 
While some aspects of the ocean and cryosphere might respond 
in a linear (i.e.,  directly proportional) manner to a perturbation 
by some external forcing, this may change fundamentally when 
critical thresholds are reached. A very important example for such a 
threshold is the transition from frozen water to liquid water at around 
0ºC that can lead to rapid acceleration of ice-melt or permafrost 
thaw (e.g., Abram et al., 2013; Trusel et al., 2018). Such thresholds 
often act as tipping points, as they are associated with rapid and 
abrupt changes even when the underlying forcing changes gradually 
(Figure 1.1a, 1.1c). Tipping elements include, for example, the collapse 
of the ocean’s large-scale overturning circulation in the Atlantic 
(Section 6.7), or the collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet though 
a process called marine ice sheet instability (Cross-Chapter Box 8 
in Chapter 3; Lenton et al., 2008). Potential ocean and cryosphere 
tipping elements form part of the scientiﬁc case for efforts to limit 
climate warming to well below 2oC (IPCC, 2018). 
Anthropogenically forced change occurs against a backdrop of 
substantial natural variability (Figure 1.1b). The anthropogenic signal 
is already detectable in global surface air temperature and several 
other climate variables, including ocean temperature and salinity 
(IPCC, 2014), but short observational records and large year-to-
year variability mean that formal detection is not yet the case for 
many expected ocean and cryosphere changes (Jones et al., 2016). 
‘Time of Emergence’ refers to the time when anthropogenic change 
signals emerge from the background noise of natural variability in a 
pre-deﬁned reference period Hawkins and Sutton, 2012; (Figure 1.1b; 
Section 5.2, Box 5.1). For some variables, (e.g., for those associated 
with ocean acidiﬁcation), the current signals emerge from this natural 
variability within a few decades, whereas for others, such as primary 
production and expected Antarctic-wide sea ice decline, the signal 
may not emerge for many more decades even under high emission 
scenarios (Collins et al., 2013; Keller et al., 2014; Rodgers et al., 2015; 
Frölicher et al., 2016; Jones et al., 2016). 
‘Detection and Attribution’ assesses evidence for past changes in 
the ocean and cryosphere, relative to normal/reference-interval 
conditions (detection), and the extent to which these changes have 
been caused by anthropogenic climate change or by other factors 
(attribution) (Bindoff et al., 2013; Cramer et al., 2014; Knutson et al., 
2017; Figure 1.1d). Reliable detection and attribution is fundamental 
to our understanding of the scientiﬁc basis of climate change (Hegerl 
et al., 2010). For example, the main attribution conclusion of the 
IPCC 4th Assessment Report (AR4), in other words, that ‘most of the 
observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th 
century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic 
greenhouse gas concentrations’, has had a strong impact on climate 
policy (Petersen, 2011). In AR5 this attribution statement was elevated 
to ‘extremely likely’ (Bindoff et al., 2013). Statistical approaches for 
attribution often involve using contrasting forcing scenarios in climate 
model experiments to detect the forcing that best explains an observed 
change (Figure  1.1d). In addition to passing the statistical test, a 
successful attribution also requires a ﬁrm process understanding. 
Conﬁdent attribution remains challenging though, especially when 
there are multiple or confounding factors that inﬂuence the state 
of a system (Hegerl et al., 2010). Particular challenges to detection 
and attribution in the ocean and cryosphere include the often 
short observational records (Section  1.8.1.1, Figure  1.3), which are 
particularly confounding given the long adjustment time scales to 
anthropogenic forcing of many properties of interest.
Extreme climate events (e.g., marine heatwaves or storm surges) push 
a system to near or beyond the ends of its normally observed range  
(Seneviratne et al., 2012; Figure 1.1b; Chapter 6;). Extremes can be 
very costly in terms of loss of life, ecosystem destruction, and economic 
damage. In a system affected by climate change, the recurrence and 
intensity of these extreme events can change much faster and have 
greater impacts than changes of the average system state (Easterling 
et al., 2000; Parmesan et al., 2000; Hughes et al., 2018). Of particular 
concern are ‘compound events’, when the joint probability of two or 
more properties of a system is extreme at the same time or closely 
connected in time and space (Cross-Chapter Box  5 in Chapter  1; 
Sections 4.3.4, 6.8). Such a compound event is given, for example, 
when marine heatwaves co-occur with very low nutrient levels in the 
ocean potentially resulting in extreme impacts (Bond et al., 2015). The 
interconnectedness of the ocean and cryosphere (Section 1.2.2) can 
also lead to cascading effects where changes in one element trigger 
secondary changes in completely different but connected elements 
of the systems, including its socioeconomic aspects. (Figure 1.1e). An 
example is the large change in ocean productivity triggered by the 
changes in circulation and iron inputs induced by the large outﬂow of 
melt waters from Greenland (Kanna et al., 2018). New methodologies 
for attributing extreme events and the risks they bring to climate 
change have emerged since AR5 (Trenberth et al., 2015; Stott et al., 
2016; Kirchmeier-Young et al., 2017; Otto, 2017), especially also for 
the attribution of individual events through an assessment of the 
fraction of attributable risk (Figure 1.1f).

1.4 
Changes in the Ocean and Cryosphere
Earth’s climate, ocean and cryosphere vary across a wide range 
of time scales. This includes the seasonal growth and melting of 
sea ice, interannual variation of ocean temperature caused by the  
El  Niño-Southern Oscillation and ice age cycles across tens to 
hundreds of thousands of years.
Climate variability can arise from internally generated (i.e., unforced) 
ﬂuctuations in the climate system. Variability can also occur in 
response to external forcings, including volcanic eruptions, changes 
in the Earth’s orbit around the Sun, oscillations in solar activity and 
changing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations.
Since the onset of the industrial revolution, human activities have 
had a strong impact on the climate system, including the ocean 
and cryosphere. Human activities have altered the external forcings 
acting on Earth’s climate (Myhre et al., 2013) by changes in land 
use (albedo), and changes in atmospheric aerosols (e.g.,  soot) 
from the burning of biomass and fossil fuels. Most signiﬁcantly, 
human activities have led to an accumulation of greenhouse gases 
(including CO2) in the atmosphere as a result of the burning of fossil 
fuels, cement production, agriculture and land use change. In 2016, 
the global average atmospheric CO2 concentration crossed 400 parts 
per million, a level Earth’s atmosphere did not experience for at least 
the past 800,000 years and possibly much longer (Lüthi et al., 2008; 
Fischer et al., 2018). These anthropogenic forcings have not only 
warmed the ocean and begun to melt the cryosphere, but have also 
led to widespread biogeochemical changes driven by the oceanic 
uptake of anthropogenic CO2 from the atmosphere (IPCC, 2013).
It is now nearly three decades since the ﬁrst assessment report of 
the IPCC, and over that time evidence and conﬁdence in observed 
and projected ocean and cryosphere changes have grown (very 
high conﬁdence; Table SM1.1). Conﬁdence in climate warming 
and its anthropogenic causes has increased across assessment 
cycles; robust detection was not yet possible in 1990, but has been 
characterised as unequivocal since AR4 in 2007. Projections of 
near-term warming rates in early reports have been realised over 
the subsequent decades, while projections have tended to err on the 
side of caution for sea level rise and ocean heat uptake that have 
developed faster than predicted (Brysse et al., 2013; Section  4.2, 
5.2). Areas of concern in early reports which were expected but 
not observable are now emerging. The expected acceleration of sea 
level rise is now observed with high conﬁdence (Section 4.2). There 
is emerging evidence in sustained observations and from long-term 
palaeoclimate reconstructions for the expected slow-down of AMOC 
(medium conﬁdence), although this remains to be properly attributed 
(Section 6.7). Signiﬁcant sea level rise contributions from Antarctic 
ice sheet mass loss (very high conﬁdence), which earlier reports 
did not expect to manifest this century, are already being observed 
(Section  3.3.1). Other newly emergent characteristics of ocean 
and cryosphere change (e.g., marine heat waves; Section 6.4) are 
assessed for the ﬁrst time in SROCC. 
3 
Conﬁdence/likelihood statements in Sections 1.4.1 and 1.4.2 derived from AR5 and SR15, unless otherwise speciﬁed.
AR5 (IPCC, 2013; IPCC, 2014) provides ample evidence of profound 
and pervasive changes in the ocean and cryosphere (Sections 1.4.1, 
1.4.2), and along with the recent SR15 report (IPCC, 2018), is the 
point of departure for the updated assessments made in SROCC.
1.4.1 
Observed and Projected Changes in the Ocean
Increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere cause heat uptake 
in the Earth system (Section 1.2) and as reported since 1970, there 
is high conﬁdence3 that the majority (more than 90%) of the extra 
thermal energy in the Earth’s system is stored in the global ocean 
(IPCC, 2013). Mean ocean surface temperature has increased since the 
1970s at a rate of 0.11 (0.09–0.13)ºC per decade (high conﬁdence), 
and forms part of a long-term warming of the surface ocean since 
the mid-19th century. The upper ocean (0–700 m, virtually certain) 
and intermediate ocean (700 to 2,000 m, likely) have warmed since 
the 1970s. Ocean heat uptake has continued unabated since AR5 
(Sections 3.2.1.2.1, 5.2), increasing the risk of marine heat waves and 
other extreme events (Section 6.4). During the 21st century, ocean 
warming is projected to continue even if anthropogenic greenhouse 
gas emissions cease (Sections 1.3, 5.2). The global water cycle has 
been altered, resulting in substantial regional changes in sea surface 
salinity (high conﬁdence; Rhein et al., 2013), which is expected to 
continue in the future (Sections 5.2.2, 6.3, 6.5). 
The rate of sea level rise since the mid-19th century has been larger 
than the mean rate of the previous two millennia (high conﬁdence). 
Over the period 1901 to 2010, global mean sea level rose by 0.19 
(0.17–0.21) m (high conﬁdence) (Church et al., 2013; Table SM1.1). 
Sea level rise continues due to freshwater added to the ocean by 
melting of glaciers and ice sheets, and as a result of ocean expansion 
due to continuous ocean warming, with a projected acceleration 
and century to millennial-scale commitments for ongoing rise 
(Section 4.2.3). In SROCC, recent developments of ice sheet modelling 
are assessed (Sections 1.8, 4.3, Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3) 
and the projected sea level rise at the end of 21st century is higher 
than reported in AR5 but with a larger uncertainty range (Sections 
4.2.3.2, 4.2.3.3).
By 2011, the ocean had taken up about 30 ± 7% of the anthropogenic 
CO2 that had been released to the atmosphere since the industrial 
revolution (Ciais et al., 2013; Section  5.2). In response, ocean pH 
decreased by 0.1 since the beginning of the industrial era (high 
conﬁdence), corresponding to an increase in acidity of 26% (Table 
SM1.1) and leading to both positive and negative biological and 
ecological impacts (high conﬁdence) (Gattuso et al., 2014). Evidence 
is increasing that the ocean’s oxygen content is declining (Oschlies 
et al., 2018). AR5 did not come to a ﬁnal conclusion with regard 
to potential long-term changes in ocean productivity due to short 
observational records and divergent scientiﬁc evidence (Boyd et al., 
2014; Section  5.2.2). Ocean acidiﬁcation and deoxygenation are 
projected to continue over the next century with high conﬁdence 
(Sections 3.2.2.3, 5.2.2).

1.4.2 
Observed and Projected Changes 
in the Cryosphere
Changes in the cryosphere documented in AR5 included the 
widespread retreat of glaciers (high conﬁdence), mass loss from  
the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets (high conﬁdence) 
and declining extents of Arctic sea ice (very high conﬁdence)  
and Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover (very high conﬁdence;  
IPCC, 2013; Vaughan et al., 2013).
A particularly rapid change in Earth’s cryosphere has been the 
decrease in Arctic sea ice extent in all seasons (Section 3.2.1.1). AR5 
assessed that there was medium conﬁdence that a nearly ice-free 
summer Arctic Ocean is likely to occur before mid-century under a 
high emissions future (IPCC, 2013), and SR15 assessed that ice-free 
summers are projected to occur at least once per century at 1.5oC 
of warming, and at least once per decade at 2oC of warming above 
pre-industrial levels (IPCC, 2018). Sea ice thickness is decreasing 
further in the Northern Hemisphere and older ice that has survived 
multiple summers is rapidly disappearing; most sea ice in the Arctic 
is now ‘ﬁrst year’ ice that grows in the autumn and winter but melts 
during the spring and summer (AMAP, 2017).
AR5 assessed that the annual mean loss from the Greenland ice sheet 
very likely substantially increased from 34 (-6–74) Gt yr–1 (billion 
tonnes yr–1) over the period 1992–2001, to 215 (157–274) Gt yr–1 over 
the period 2002–2011 (IPCC, 2013). The average rate of ice loss from 
the Antarctic ice sheet also likely increased from 30 (-37–97) Gt yr–1 
over the period 1992–2001, to 147 (72–221) Gt yr–1 over the period 
2002–2011 (IPCC, 2013). The average rate of ice loss from glaciers 
around the world (excluding glaciers on the periphery of the ice 
sheets), was very likely 226 (91–361) Gt yr–1 over the period 1971–
2009, and 275 (140–410) Gt yr–1 over the period 1993–2009 (IPCC, 
2013). The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are continuing to lose 
mass at an accelerating rate (Section 3.3) and glaciers are continuing 
to lose mass worldwide (Section  2.2.3, Cross-Chapter Box  6 in 
Chapter 2). Conﬁdence in the quantiﬁcation of glacier and ice sheet 
mass loss has increased across successive IPCC reports (Table SM1.1) 
due to the development of remote sensing observational methods 
(Section 1.8.1). 
Changes in seasonal snow are best documented for the Northern 
Hemisphere. AR5 reported that the extent of snow cover has 
decreased since the mid-20th century (very high conﬁdence). 
Negative trends in both snow depth and duration are also detected 
with station observations (medium conﬁdence), although results 
depend on elevation and observational period (Section 2.2.2). AR5 
assessed that permafrost temperatures have increased in most 
regions since the early 1980s (high conﬁdence), and the rate of 
increase has varied regionally (IPCC, 2013). Methane and carbon 
dioxide release from soil organic carbon is projected to continue in 
high mountain and polar regions (Box 2.2), and SROCC has used 
multiple lines of evidence to reduce uncertainty in permafrost change 
assessments (Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 1, Section 3.4.3.1.1).

Introduction
Assessing the future risks and opportunities that climate change will bring for the ocean and cryosphere, and for their dependent 
ecosystems and human communities, is a main objective of this report. However, the future is inherently uncertain. A well-established 
methodological approach that the Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) report uses to assess 
the future under these uncertainties is through scenario analysis (Kainuma et al., 2018). The ultimate physical driver of the ocean and 
cryosphere changes that SROCC assesses are greenhouse gas emissions, while the exposure to hazards and the future risks to natural 
and human systems are also shaped social, economic and governance factors (Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 1; Section 1.5). This 
Cross-Chapter Box introduces the main scenarios that are used in the SROCC assessment. Examples of key climate change indicators 
in the atmosphere and ocean projected under future greenhouse gas emission scenarios are also provided (Table CB1.1).
Scenarios and pathways
Scenarios are a plausible description of how the future may develop based on a coherent and internally consistent set of assumptions 
about key driving forces and relationships. Pathways refer to the temporal evolution of natural and/or human systems towards a future 
state. In SROCC, assessments of future change frequently use climate model projections forced by pathways of future radiative forcing 
changes related to different socioeconomic scenarios. 
Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) are a set of time series of plausible future concentrations of greenhouse gases, aerosols 
and chemically active gases, as well as land use changes (Moss et al., 2008; Moss et al., 2010; van Vuuren et al., 2011a; Figure SM1.1). 
The word representative signiﬁes that each RCP provides only one of many possible pathways that would lead to the speciﬁc radiative 
forcing characteristics. The term pathway emphasises the fact that not only the long-term concentration levels, but also the trajectory 
taken over time to reach that outcome are of interest.

Cross-Chapter Box 1 (continued)
Four RCPs were used for projections of the future climate in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) (Taylor et al., 
2012). They are identiﬁed by their approximate anthropogenic radiative forcing (in W m-2, relative to 1750) by 2100: RCP2.6, RCP4.5, 
RCP6.0, and RCP8.5 (Figure SM1.1). RCP8.5 is a high greenhouse gas emission scenario without effective climate change mitigation 
policies, leading to continued and sustained growth in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations (Riahi et al., 2011). RCP2.6 
represents a low greenhouse gas emission, high mitigation future that gives a two in three chance of limiting global atmospheric 
surface warming to below 2oC by the end of the century (van Vuuren et al., 2011b; Collins et al., 2013; Allen et al., 2018). Achieving the 
RCP2.6 pathway would require implementation of negative emissions technologies at a not-yet-proven scale to remove greenhouse 
gases from the air, in addition to other mitigation strategies such as energy from sustainable sources and existing nature-based 
strategies (Gasser et al., 2015; Sanderson et al., 2016; Royal Society, 2018; National Academies of Sciences, 2019). An even more 
stringent RCP1.9 pathway is considered most compatible with limiting global warming to below 1.5oC, called a 1.5ºC-consistent 
pathway in the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5ºC (SR15; O’Neill et al., 2016; IPCC, 2018), and will be assessed in the IPCC 
6th Assessment Report (AR6) using projections of Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). Global fossil 
CO2 emissions rose more than 2% in 2018 and 1.6% in 2017, after a temporary slowdown in emissions from 2014–2016. Current 
emissions continue to grow in line with the RCP8.5 trajectory (Peters et al., 2012; Le Quéré et al., 2018).
In SROCC, the CMIP5 simulations forced with RCPs are used extensively to assess future ocean and cryosphere changes. In particular, 
RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 are used to contrast the possible outcomes of low-emission versus high-emission futures, respectively 
(Table CB1.1). In some cases the SROCC assessments use literature that is based on the earlier Special Report on Emission Scenarios  
(SRES; IPCC, 2000), and details of these and their approximate RCP equivalents are provided in Tables SM1.3 and SM1.4.
Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) complement the RCPs with varying socioeconomic challenges to adaptation and mitigation 
(e.g., population, economic growth, education, urbanisation and the rate of technological development; O’Neill et al., 2017). The SSPs 
describe ﬁve alternative socioeconomic futures comprising: sustainable development (SSP1), middle-of-the-road development (SSP2), 
regional rivalry (SSP3), inequality (SSP4), and fossil-fuelled development (SSP5; Figure SM1.1; Kriegler et al., 2016; Riahi et al., 2017). 
The RCPs set plausible pathways for greenhouse gas concentrations and the climate changes that could occur, and the SSPs set the 
stage on which reductions in emissions will or will not be achieved within the context of the underlying socioeconomic characteristics 
and shared policy assumptions of that world. The combination of SSP-based socioeconomic scenarios and RCP-based climate 
projections provides an integrative frame for climate impact and policy analysis. The SSPs will be included in the CMIP6 simulations to 
be assessed in AR6 (O’Neill et al., 2016). In SROCC, the SSPs are used only for contextualising estimates from the literature on varying 
future populations in regions exposed to ocean and cryosphere changes.
Baselines and reference intervals
A baseline provides a reference period from which changes can be evaluated. In the context of anthropogenic climate change, the 
baseline should ideally approximate the ‘pre-industrial’ conditions before signiﬁcant human inﬂuences on the climate began. The IPCC 
5th Assessment Report (AR5) and SR15 (Allen et al., 2018) use 1850–1900 as the pre-industrial baseline for assessing historical and 
future climate change. Atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and global surface temperatures had already begun to rise in this 
interval from early industrialisation (Abram et al., 2016; Hawkins et al., 2017; Schurer et al., 2017). However, the scarcity of reliable 
climate observations represents a major challenge for quantifying earlier pre-industrial states (Hawkins et al., 2017). To maintain 
consistency across IPCC reports, the 1850–1900 pre-industrial baseline is used wherever possible in SROCC, recognising that this is a 
compromise between data coverage and representativeness of typical pre-industrial conditions.
In SROCC, the 1986–2005 reference interval used in AR5 is referred to as the recent past, and a 2006–2015 reference is used for present 
day, consistent with SR15 (Allen et al., 2018). The 2006–2015 reference interval incorporates near-global upper ocean data coverage 
and reasonably comprehensive remote-sensing cryosphere data (Section 1.8.1), and aligns this report with a more current reference 
than the 1986–2005 reference adopted by AR5. This 10-year present day period is short relative to natural variability. However, at this 
decadal scale the bias in the present day interval due to natural variability is generally small compared to differences between present 
day conditions and the pre-industrial baseline. There is also no indication of global average surface temperature in either 1986–2005 or 
2006–2015 being substantially biased by short-term variability (Allen et al., 2018), consistent with the AR5 ﬁnding that each of the last 
three decades has been successively warmer at the Earth’s surface than any preceding decade since 1850 (IPCC, 2013).
SROCC commonly provides future change assessments for two key intervals: A near term interval of 2031–2050 is comparable 
to a single generation time scale from present day, and incorporates the interval when global warming is likely to reach 1.5oC 
if warming continues at the current rate (IPCC, 2018). An end-of-century interval of 2081–2100 represents the average climate

conditions reached at the end of the standard CMIP5 future climate simulations and is relevant to long-term infrastructure planning 
and climate-resilient development pathways (CRDPs) (Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 1). In some cases where committed changes 
exist over multi-century time scales, such as the assessment of future sea level rise (Section 4.3.2) or deep ocean oxygen changes 
(Section 5.2.4.2, Table 5.5), SROCC also considers model evidence for long-term changes beyond the end of the current century.
Key indicators of future ocean and cryosphere change
Table CB1.1 compiles information on key indicators of climate change in the atmosphere and ocean. This information is given for 
different RCPs and for changes in the near term and end-of-century assessment intervals, relative to the recent past, noting that this 
does not capture changes that have already taken place since the pre-industrial baseline. SR15 assessed that global mean surface 
warming from the pre-industrial (1850–1900) to the recent past (1986–2005) reference period was 0.63oC (likely range of 0.57oC–
0.69oC), and during the present day interval (2006–2015) was 0.87oC (likely range of 0.75oC–0.99oC) higher than the average over 
the 1850–1900 pre-industrial period (very high conﬁdence; IPCC, 2018).
These key climate and ocean change indicators allow for some harmonisation of the risk assessments in the chapters of SROCC. 
Projections of future change across a wider range of ocean and cryosphere components is also provided in Figure 1.5. Ocean and 
cryosphere changes and risks by the end-of-century (2081–2100) are expected to be larger under high greenhouse gas emission 
scenarios, compared with low greenhouse gas emission scenarios (very high conﬁdence) (Table CB1.1, Figure 1.5).

Risk and Impacts Related to Ocean 
and Cryosphere Change
SROCC assesses the risks (i.e., potential for adverse consequences) 
and impacts (i.e.,  manifested risk) resulting from climate-related 
changes in the ocean and cryosphere. Knowledge on risk is essential 
for conceiving and implementing adequate responses. Cross-Chapter 
Box  2 in Chapter  1 introduces key concepts of risk, adaptation, 
resilience and transformation, and explains why and how they matter 
for this report. 
In SROCC, the term ‘natural system’ describes the biological and 
physical components of the environment, independent of human 
involvement but potentially affected by human activities. ‘Natural 
systems’ may refer to portions of the total system without necessarily 
considering all its components (e.g.,  an ocean upwelling system). 
Throughout the assessment usage of ‘natural system’ does not imply 
a system unaltered by human activities. 
‘Human systems’ include physiological, health, socio-cultural, 
belief, technological, economic, food, political, and legal systems, 
among others. Humans have depended upon the Earth’s ocean 
(WOA, 2016; IPBES, 2018b) and cryosphere (AMAP, 2011; Hovelsrud 
et al., 2011; Watt-Cloutier, 2018) for many millennia (Redman, 1999). 
Contemporary human populations still depend directly on elements 
of the ocean and cryosphere, and the ecosystem services they provide, 
but at a much larger scale and with greater environmental impact 
than in pre-industrial times (Inniss and Simcock, 2017). 
An ecosystem is a functional unit consisting of living organisms, their 
non-living environment, and the interactions within and between 
them. Ecosystems can be nested within other ecosystems and their 
scale can range from very small to the entire biosphere. Today, most 
ecosystems either contain humans as key organisms, or are inﬂuenced 
by the effects of human activities in their environment. In SROCC, a 
social-ecological system describes the combined system and all of its 
sub-components and refers speciﬁcally to the interaction of natural 
and human systems.
The ocean and cryosphere are unique systems that have intrinsic 
value, including the ecosystems and biodiversity they support. 
Frameworks of Ecosystem Services and Nature’s Contributions to 
People are both used within SROCC to assess the impacts of changes 
in the ocean and cryosphere on humans directly, and through changes 
to the ecosystems that support human life and civilisations (Sections 
2.3, 3.4.3.2, 4.3.3.5, 5.4, 6.4, 6.5, 6.8). The Millennium Ecosystem 
Assessment (MEA, 2005) established a conceptual Ecosystem 
Services framework between biodiversity, human well-being, and 
drivers of change. This framework highlights that natural systems 
provide vital life-support services to humans and the planet, including 
direct material services (e.g.,  food, timber), non-material services 
(e.g., cultural continuity, health), and many services that regulate 
environmental status (e.g., soil formation, water puriﬁcation). This 
framework supports decision-making by quantifying beneﬁts for 
valuation and trade-off analyses. The Ecosystem Services framework 
has been challenged as monetising the relationships of people with 
nature, and undervaluing small-scale livelihoods, cultural values and 
other considerations that contribute little to global commerce (Díaz 
et al., 2018). More recent frameworks, such as Nature’s Contributions 
to People (Díaz et al., 2018), used in the Intergovernmental Platform 
on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services assessments (IPBES), aim to 
better encompass the non-commercial ways that nature contributes 
to human quality of life.

This box introduces key concepts used in the Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) in relation to 
risk, adaptation, resilience, and transformation. Building on an assessment of the current literature, it provides a conceptual framing 
for the report and for the assessments within its chapters. Full deﬁnitions of key terms are provided in the SROCC Annex I: Glossary.
Risk and adaptation
SROCC considers risk from climate change-related effects on the ocean and cryosphere as the result of the interaction between: 
(1) environmental hazards triggered by climate change, (2) exposure of humans, infrastructure and ecosystems to those hazards, 
and (3) systems’ vulnerabilities. Risk refers to the potential for adverse consequences, and impacts refer to materialised effects 
of climate change. Next to assessing risk and impacts speciﬁcally resulting from climate change-related effects on the ocean, coast and 
cryosphere, SROCC is also concerned with the options to reduce climate-related risk. 
Beyond mitigation, adaptation is a key avenue to reduce risk (Section 1.6). Adaptation can also include exploiting new opportunities; 
however, this box focuses on risk, and thus, the latter is not discussed in detail here. Adaptation efforts link into the causal fabric of 
risk by reducing existing and future vulnerability, exposure, and/or (where possible) hazards (Figure CB2.1). Addressing the different 
risk components (hazards, exposure and vulnerability) involves assessing and selecting options for policy.

Figure CB2.1 |  There are options for risk reduction through adaptation. Adaptation can reduce risk by addressing one or more of the three risk factors: vulnerability, 
exposure, and/or hazard. The reduction of vulnerability, exposure, and/or hazard potential can be achieved through different policy and action choices over time until 
limits to adaptation might be reached. The ﬁgure builds on the conceptual framework of risk used in the IPCC 5th Assessment Report (AR5) (Oppenheimer et al., 2014).
and action. Such decision-making entails evaluation of the effectiveness, efﬁciency, efﬁcacy and acceptance of actions. Adaptation 
responses are more effective when they promote resilience to climate change, consider plausible futures and unexpected events, 
strengthen essential or desired characteristics as well as values of the responding system and/or make adjustments to avoid 
unsustainable pathways (high agreement, medium evidence; Section 2.3; Box 2.4; 4.4.4; 4.4.5).
Adaptation requires adaptive capacity, which for human systems includes assets (ﬁnancial, physical, and/or ecological), capital (social 
and institutional), knowledge and technical know-how (Klein et al., 2014). The extent of adaptive capacity determines adaptation 
potential, but does not necessarily translate into effective adaptation if awareness of the need to act, the willingness to act and/or the 
cooperation needed to act is lacking (high conﬁdence; Sections 2.3; Box 2.4; 4.3.2.6.3; 5.5.2.4).
There are limits to adaptation, which include, for example, physical, ecological, technological, economic, political, institutional, 
psychological and/or socio-cultural aspects (medium evidence, high agreement) (Dow et al., 2013; Barnett et al., 2014; Klein et al., 
2014). For example, the ability to adapt to sea level rise depends, in part, on the elevation of the low-lying islands and coasts in 
question, but also on the capacity to successfully negotiate protection or relocation measures socially and politically (Cross-Chapter 
Box 9, also see Section 6.4.3 for a wider overview). Limits to adaptation are sometimes considered as something different from 
barriers to adaptation. Barriers can in principle be overcome if adaptive capacity is available (e.g., where funding is made available), 
even though overcoming barriers is often hard in reality, particularly for resource-poor communities and countries (high conﬁdence; 
Section 4.4.3). Limits to adaptation are reached when adaptation no longer allows an actor or ecosystem to secure valued objectives 
or key functions from intolerable risks (Section 4.4.2; Dow et al., 2013). Deﬁning tolerable risks and key system functions is, therefore, 
of central importance for the assessment of limits to adaptation.
Residual risks (i.e., the risk that endures following adaptation and risk reduction efforts) remain even where adaptation is possible 
(very high conﬁdence; Chapters 2–6; Section 6.3.2; Table 6.2). Residual risks have bearing on the emerging debate about loss and 
damage (Huq et al., 2013; Warner and van der Geest, 2013; Boyd et al., 2017; Djalante et al., 2018; Mechler et al., 2018; Roy et al., 
2018). This report addresses loss and damage in relation to slow onset processes, including ocean changes (Section 5.4.2.3), sea level 
rise (Section 4.3), and glacier retreat (Section 2.3.6), and polar cryosphere changes (Section 3.4.3.3.4), as well as rapid onset hazards 
such as tropical cyclones (Chapter 6). The assessment encompasses non-economic losses, including the impacts on intrinsic and

spiritual attributes with which high mountain societies value their landscapes (Section 2.3.5); the interconnected relationship with, 
and reliance upon, the land, water and ice for culture, livelihoods and wellbeing in the Arctic (Section 3.4.3.3); and cultural heritage 
and displacement addressed in the Cross-Chapter Box on low-lying islands and coasts (Cross-Chapter Box 9; Burkett, 2016; Markham 
et al., 2016; Tschakert et al., 2017; Huggel et al., 2018). 
Building resilience
Addressing climate change-related risk, impacts (including extreme events and shocks) and trade-offs together with shaping the 
trajectories of social and ecological systems is facilitated by considering resilience (Biggs et al., 2012; Quinlan et al., 2016). In SROCC, 
resilience is understood as the capacity of interconnected social, economic and ecological systems to cope with disturbances by 
reorganising in ways that maintain their essential function, structure, and identity (Walker et al., 2004). Resilience may be considered 
as a positive attribute of a system and an aspirational goal when it contributes to the capacity for adaptation and learning without 
changing the structure, function, and identity of the system (Walker et al., 2004; Steiner, 2015). Alternately, resilience may be used 
descriptively as a system property that is neither good nor bad (Walker et al., 2004; Chapin et al., 2009; Weichselgartner and Kelman, 
2014). For example, a system can be highly resilient in keeping its unfavoured attributes, such as poverty or institutional rigidity 
(Carpenter and Brock, 2008). Critics of the resilience concept warn that the application of resilience to social systems is problematic 
when the responsibility for resilience building is shifted onto the shoulders of vulnerable and resource-poor populations (e.g., Chandler, 
2013; Reid, 2013; Rigg and Oven, 2015; Tierney, 2015; Olsson et al., 2017).
Applying the concept of resilience in mitigation and adaptation planning builds the capacity of a social-ecological system to navigate 
anticipated changes and unexpected events (Biggs et al., 2012; Varma et al., 2014; Sud et al., 2015). Resilience also emphasises 
social-ecological system dynamics, including the possibility of crossing critical thresholds and experiencing a regime shift (i.e., state 
change). Seven general strategies for building social-ecological resilience have been identiﬁed (Figure CB2.2; Ostrom, 2010; Biggs 
et al., 2012; Quinlan et al., 2016). The concept of resilience also allows analysts, accessors of risk and decision makers to recognise 
how climate-change related risks often cannot be fully avoided or alleviated despite adaptation. For SROCC, this is especially relevant 
along low-lying coasts, high mountain areas and the polar regions (medium evidence, high agreement; Sections 2.3; 2.4; 3.5, 6.8, 6.9).
Many efforts are underway to apply resilience thinking in assessments, management practices, policy making and the day-to-
day practices of affected sectors and local communities. For example, leaders of the Paciﬁc small island developing states use 
the Framework for Resilient Development in the Paciﬁc, which integrates climate change and disaster risk management (Paciﬁc 
Community, 2016; Cross-Chapter Box 9). In the Philippines, a new framework has been developed to conduct full inventories of

actual and projected loss and damage due to climate change and associated disasters such as from cyclones. Creating such an 
inventory is difﬁcult due to the disconnect between tools for climate change assessment and those for post disaster assessment 
(Florano, 2018). In Arctic Alaska, evaluative frameworks are being applied to determine needs, responsibilities, and alternative actions 
associated with coastal village relocations (Bronen, 2015; Cross-Chapter Box 9). In all these initiatives, resilience is a key consideration 
for enabling CRDPs.
Climate-resilient development pathways (CRDPs)
CRDPs are a relatively new concept to describe climate change mitigation and adaptation trajectories that strengthen sustainable 
development and efforts to eradicate poverty and reduce inequalities while promoting fair and cross-scalar adaptation to, and 
resilience in, a changing climate (Kainuma et al., 2018; Roy et al., 2018). CRDPs are increasingly being explored as an approach 
for combining scientiﬁc assessments, stakeholder participation, and forward-looking development planning, acknowledging that 
pursuing CRDP is not only a technical challenge of risk management but also a social and political process (Roy et al., 2018). Adaptive 
decision-making over time is key to CRDPs (Haasnoot et al., 2013; Wise et al., 2014; Fazey et al., 2016; Ramm et al., 2017; Bloemen 
et al., 2018; Lawrence et al., 2018). CRDPs accommodate both the interacting cultural, social, and ecosystem factors that inﬂuence 
multi-stakeholder decision making processes, and the overall sustainability of adaptation measures. 
Adequate climate change mitigation and adaptation allows for opportunities for sustainable development pathways and the options for 
resilience building. CRDPs involve series of mitigation and adaptation choices over time, balancing short-term and long-term goals 
and accommodating newly available knowledge (Denton et al., 2014). The CRDPs approach has been successfully used, for example, 
in urban, remote and disadvantaged communities, and can showcase the potential to counter maladaptive choices (e.g., Barnett et al., 
2014; Butler et al., 2014; Maru et al., 2014). CRDPs aim to establish narratives of hope and opportunity that can extend beyond risk 
reduction and coping (Amundsen et al., 2018). Although climate change impacts on the ocean and cryosphere elicit many emotions, 
including fear, anger, despair and apathy (Cunsolo Willox et al., 2013; Cunsolo and Landman, 2017; Cunsolo and Ellis, 2018), narratives 
of hope are critical in provoking motivation, creative thinking and behavioural changes in response to climate change (Myers et al., 
2012; Smith and Leiserowitz, 2014; Feldman and Hart, 2016; Feldman and Hart, 2018; Prescott and Logan, 2018; Section 1.8.3).
Much of the adaptation and resilience literature published since AR5 highlights the need for transformations that enable effective climate 
change mitigation (most notably, to decarbonise the economy) (Riahi et al., 2017), and support adaptation (e.g., Pelling et al., 2015; 
Few et al., 2017). Transformation becomes particularly relevant when existing mitigation and adaptation practices cannot reduce risks 
and impacts to an acceptable level. Transformative adaptation, therefore, involves fundamental modiﬁcations of policies, policy making 
processes, institutions, human behaviour and cultural values (Pelling et al., 2015; Solecki et al., 2017). Successful transformation 
requires attention to conditions that allow for such changes, including timing (e.g., windows of opportunity), social readiness (e.g., 
some level of willingness) and resources to act (e.g., trust, human skill and ﬁnancial resources; Koﬁnas et al., 2013; Moore et al., 2014). 
Examples related to SROCC include shifting from a paradigm of protection reliant on seawalls to living with saltwater as a response 
to coastal ﬂooding in rural areas (Renaud et al., 2015) or involving fundamental risk management changes in coastal megacities, 
including retreat (Solecki et al., 2017). Transformation in changing ocean and cryosphere contexts can be fostered by transdisciplinary 
collaboration between actors in science, government, the private sector, civil society and affected communities (Padmanabhan, 2017; 
Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 1; Cross-Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 1).
1.5.1 
Hazards and Opportunities for Natural Systems, 
Ecosystems, and Human Systems 
Hazards faced by marine and coastal organisms, and the ecosystem 
services they provide are generally dependent on future greenhouse 
gas emission pathways, with moderate likelihood under a 
low-emission future, but high to very high likelihood under higher 
emission scenarios (very high conﬁdence) (Mora et al., 2013; Gattuso 
et al., 2015). Hazards to marine ecosystems assessed in AR5 (IPCC, 
2014) included degradation of coral reefs (high conﬁdence), ocean 
deoxygenation (medium conﬁdence) and ocean acidiﬁcation (high 
conﬁdence). Shifts in the ranges of plankton and ﬁsh were identiﬁed 
with high conﬁdence regionally, but with uncertain trends globally. 
SROCC provides more evidence for global shifts in the distribution of 
marine organisms, and in how the phenology of animals is responding 
to ocean change (Sections 3.2.3, 5.2). The signature of climate 
change is now detected in almost all marine ecosystems. Similar 
trends of changing habitat due to climate change are reported for 
the cryosphere (Sections 2.2, 3.4.3.2). The risk of irreversible loss of 
many marine and coastal ecosystems increases with global warming, 
especially at 2ºC or more (high conﬁdence; IPCC, 2018). Risk also 
increases for habitat displacements, both poleward (Section 3.2.4) 
and to greater ocean depths (Section 5.2.4), or habitat reductions, 
such as that caused by glacier retreat (Section 2.2.3). 
Framing and Context of the Report  
Chapter 1

91
Changes in the ocean and cryosphere bring hazards that affect the 
health, wellbeing, safety and security of populations in coastal, 
mountain and polar environments (Section 2.3.5, 3.4.3, 4.3.2). Some 
impacts are direct, such as sea level rise or coastal erosion that can 
displace coastal residents (4.3.2.3, 4.4.2.6, Box 4.1). Other effects are 
indirect; for example, rising ocean temperatures have led to increases 
in maximum wind speed and rainfall rates in tropical cyclones 
(Section 6.3), creating hazards with severe consequences for natural 
and human systems (Sections 4.3, 6.2, 6.3, 6.8). The multiple category 
4 and 5 Atlantic hurricanes in 2017 caused the loss of over 3300 lives 
and more than 350 billion USD in economic damages (Cross-Chapter 
Box 9; Andrade et al., 2018; Murakami et al., 2018; NOAA, 2018). In 
mountain regions, glacial lake outburst ﬂoods have caused severe 
impacts on lives, livelihoods and infrastructure that often extend 
beyond the directly affected areas (Section 2.3.2 and 6.2.2). Some 
hazards related to ocean and cryosphere change involve abrupt 
and irreversible changes (Section  1.3), which generate sometimes 
unpredictable risks, and multiple hazards can coincide to greatly 
elevate the total risk (Section 6.8.2). For example, combinations of 
thawing permafrost, sea level rise, loss of sea ice, ocean surface waves 
and extreme weather events (Thomson and Rogers, 2014; Ford et al., 
2017) have damaged Arctic infrastructure (e.g.,  buildings, roads) 
(AMAP, 2015; AMAP, 2017), impacted reindeer husbandry livelihoods 
for Sami and other Arctic Indigenous peoples and impeded access to 
hunting grounds, other communities and travel routes fundamental 
to the livelihoods, food security and wellbeing of Inuit and other 
Northern cultures (Section  3.4.3). In some Arctic regions, tipping 
points may have already been reached such that adaptive practices 
can no longer work (Section 3.5).
Climate change impacts on the ocean and cryosphere can also 
present opportunities, in at least the near- and medium-term. For 
example, in Nepal warming of high mountain environments and 
accelerated melting of snow and ice have extended the growing 
season and crop yields in some regions (Section 2.3; Gaire et al., 
2015; Merrey et al., 2018), while tourism and shipping has increased 
in the Arctic with loss of sea ice (Section  3.2.4). Moreover, rising 
ocean temperatures redistribute the global ﬁsh population, allowing 
new ﬁshing opportunities while reducing some established ﬁsheries 
(Bell et al., 2011; Fenichel et al., 2016; Section 5.4). To gain from new 
opportunities, while also avoiding or mitigating new or increasing 
hazards, it is necessary to be aware of trade-offs between risks and 
beneﬁts to understand who is and is not beneﬁting. For example, 
opportunities can involve trade-offs with mitigation and/or SDGs 
(Section 3.5.2), and the balance of economic costs and beneﬁts may 
differ substantially between the near-term and long-term future 
(Section 5.4.2.2). 
1.5.2 
Exposure of Natural Systems, Ecosystems,  
and Human Systems
Exposure to hazards in cryosphere systems occur in the immediate 
vicinity of cryosphere components, and at regional to global scales 
where cryosphere changes link to other natural systems. For example, 
decreasing Arctic sea ice increases exposure for organisms that depend 
upon habitats provided by sea ice, but also has far-reaching impacts 
through the resulting direct albedo feedback and ampliﬁcation of 
Arctic climate warming (e.g.,  Pistone et al., 2014) that then locally 
increases surface melting of the Greenland ice sheet (Liu et al., 2016; 
Stroeve et al., 2017). Additionally, ice loss from ice sheets contribute 
to the global-scale exposure of sea level rise, and more local-scale 
modiﬁcations and losses of coastal habitats and ecosystems (Sections 
3.2.3 and 4.3.3.5). Interactions within and between natural systems also 
inﬂuence the spatial reach of risks associated with cryosphere change. 
Permafrost degradation, for example, interacts with ecosystems and 
climate on various spatial and temporal scales, and feedbacks from 
these interactions range from local impacts on topography, hydrology 
and biology, to global-scale impacts via biogeochemical cycling (e.g., 
methane release) on climate (Sections 2.2, 2.3, 3.4; Kokelj et al., 2015; 
Grosse et al., 2016).
Exposure to climate change risk exists for virtually all coastal 
organisms, habitats and ecosystems (Section 5.2), through processes 
such as inundation and salinisation (Section 4.3), ocean acidiﬁcation 
and deoxygenation (Sections 3.2.3, 5.2.3), increasing marine 
heatwaves (Section 6.4.1.2), and increases in harmful algal blooms 
and invasive species (Glibert et al., 2014; Gobler et al., 2017; Townhill 
et al., 2017; Box  5.3). Aggregate impacts of multiple drivers are 
dramatically altering ecosystem structure and function in the coastal 
and open ocean (Boyd et al., 2015; Deutsch et al., 2015; Przeslawski 
et al., 2015), such as coral reefs under increasing pressure from both 
rising ocean temperature and acidiﬁcation (Section 5.3.4). Increasing 
exposure to climate change hazards in open ocean natural systems 
includes ocean acidiﬁcation (O’Neill et al., 2017; Section  5.2.3), 
changes in ocean ventilation, deoxygenation (Shepherd et al., 2017; 
Breitburg et al., 2018; Section 5.2.2.4), increased cyclone and ﬂood 
risk (Section 6.3.3) and an increase in extreme El Niño and La Niña 
events (Section. 6.5.1). Heat content is rapidly increasing within the 
ocean (Section 5.2.2) and marine heat waves are becoming more 
frequent across the world ocean (Section 6.4.1).
People who live close to the ocean and/or cryosphere, or depend 
directly on their resources for livelihoods, are particularly exposed to 
climate change impacts and hazards (very high conﬁdence) (Barange 
et al., 2014; Romero-Lankao et al., 2014; AMAP, 2015). These 
exposures can result in infrastructure damage and failure (Sections 
2.3.1.3, 3.4.3, 3.5., 4.3.2), loss of habitability (Sections 2.3.7, 3.4.3, 
3.5, 4.3.3), changes in air quality (Section  6.5.2), proliferation of 
disease vectors (Sections 3.4.3.2.2, 5.4.2.1.1), increased morbidity 
and mortality due to injury, infectious disease, heat stress, and mental 
health and wellness challenges (Section 3.4.3.3), compromised food 
and water security (Sections 2.3.1, 3.4.3.3, 4.3.3.6, 5.4.2.1, 6.8.4), 
degradation of ecosystem services (Sections 2.3.1.2, 2.3.3.4, 4.3.3, 
5.4.1, 6.4.2.3), economic and non-economic impacts due to reduced 
production and social network system disruption (Section  2.3.7), 
conﬂict (Sections 2.3.1.14, 3.5) and widespread human migration 
(Sections 2.3.7, 4.4.3.5; Oppenheimer et al., 2014; van Ruijven et al., 
2014; AMAP, 2015; Cunsolo and Ellis, 2018). 
This report documents how people residing in coastal and cryosphere 
regions are already exposed to climate change hazards, and which 
of these hazards are projected to increase in the future. For example, 
mountain communities have been exposed to increased rockfall, rock

Framing and Context of the Report

avalanches and landslides due to permafrost degradation and glacier 
shrinkage, and to changes in snow avalanche type and seasonal 
timing (Section 2.3.1). Cryosphere changes that can impact water 
availability in mountain regions and for downstream populations 
(Sections 2.3.1, 2.3.4, 2.3.5) have implications for drinking water, 
irrigation, livestock grazing, hydropower production and tourism 
(Section  2.3). Some declining mountain glaciers hold sacred and 
symbolic meanings for local communities who will experience 
spiritual losses (Section  2.3.4, 2.3.5, and 2.3.6). Exposures to 
extreme warming, and continued sea ice and permafrost loss in the 
Arctic, challenge Indigenous communities with close interdependent 
relationships of economy, lifestyles, cultural identity, self-sufﬁciency, 
Indigenous knowledge,  health and wellbeing with the Arctic 
cryosphere (Section 3.4.3, 3.5). 
The population living in low elevation coastal zones (land less than 
10 m above sea level) is projected to increase to more than one 
billion by 2050 (Section 4.3.2.2). These people and communities are 
particularly exposed to future sea level rise, rising ocean temperature 
(including marine heat waves; Section 6.4), enhanced coastal erosion, 
increasing wind, wave height, storm intensity and ocean acidiﬁcation 
(Section 4.3.4). These exposures bring associated risks for livelihoods 
linked to ﬁsheries, tourism and trade, as well as loss of life, damaged 
assets, and disruption of basic services including safe water supplies, 
sanitation, energy and transportation networks (Chapters 4, 5, and 6; 
Cross-Chapter Box 9). 
1.5.3 
Vulnerabilities in Natural Systems, Ecosystems, 
and Human Systems
Direct and indirect risks to natural systems are inﬂuenced by vulnerability 
to climate change as well as deterioration of ecosystem services. For 
example, about half of species assessed on the northeast United States 
continental shelf exhibited high to very high climate vulnerability due 
to temperature preferences and changes in habitat space (Hare et al., 
2016), with corresponding northward range shifts for many species 
(Kleisner et al., 2017) and increased vulnerability for organisms or 
ecosystems unable to migrate or evolve at the rate required to adapt 
to ocean and cryosphere changes (Miller et al., 2018). Non-climatic 
pressures also magnify the vulnerability of ocean and cryosphere 
ecosystems to climate-related changes, such as overﬁshing, coastal 
development, and pollution, including plastic pollution (Halpern et al., 
2008; Halpern et al., 2015; IPBES, 2018a; IPBES, 2018b; IPBES, 2018c; 
IPBES, 2018d). Conventional (fossil fuel-based) plastics produced in 
2015 accounted for 3.8% of global CO2 emissions and could reach up 
to 15% by 2050 (Zheng and Suh, 2019). 
The vulnerability of mountain, Arctic and coastal communities is 
affected by social, political, historical, cultural, economic, institutional, 
environmental, geographical and/or demographic factors such as 
gender, age, race, class, caste, Indigeneity and disability (Thomas et al., 
2019; Sections 2.3.6 and 3.5; Cross-Chapter Box 9). Disparities and 
inequities in such factors may result in social exclusion, inequalities 
and non-climatic challenges to health and wellbeing, economic 
development and basic human rights (Adger et al., 2014; Olsson 
et al., 2014; Smith et al., 2014). Those less advantaged often also have 
reduced access to and control over the social, ﬁnancial, technological 
and environmental resources that are required for adaptation and 
transformation (Oppenheimer et al., 2014; AMAP, 2015), thus limiting 
options for coping and adapting to change (Hijioka et al., 2014). 
However, even populations with greater wealth and privilege can be 
vulnerable to some climate change risks (Cardona et al., 2012; Smith 
et al., 2014), especially if sources of wealth and wellbeing depend 
upon established infrastructure that is poorly suited to ocean or 
cryosphere change. 
Institutions and governance can shape vulnerability and adaptive 
capacity, and it can be challenging for weak governance structures to 
respond effectively to extreme or persistent climate change hazards 
(Sections 6.4 and 6.9; Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 1; Berrang-Ford 
et al., 2014; Hijioka et al., 2014). Furthermore, populations can be 
negatively impacted by inappropriate climate change mitigation 
and/or adaptation policies, particularly ones that further marginalise 
their knowledge, culture, values and livelihoods (Field et al., 2014; 
Cross-Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 1). 
Vulnerability is not static in place and time, nor homogeneously 
experienced. The vulnerabilities of individuals, groups, and populations 
to climate change is dynamic and diverse, and reﬂects changing 
societal and environmental conditions (Thomas et al., 2019). SROCC 
examines vulnerability following the conceptual deﬁnition presented 
in Cross-Chapter Box  2 in Chapter  1, and vulnerability in human 
systems is treated in relative rather than absolute terms.
1.6 
Addressing the Causes and 
Consequences of Climate Change  
for the Ocean and Cryosphere
Effective and ambitious mitigation of climate change would be required 
to meet the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement (UNFCCC, 2015; 
IPCC, 2018). Similarly, effective and ambitious adaptation to climate 
change impacts on the ocean and cryosphere is necessary to enable 
CRDPs that minimise residual risk, and loss and damage (very high 
conﬁdence; Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 1; IPCC, 2018). Mitigation 
refers to human actions to limit climate change by reducing the 
emissions and enhancing the sinks of greenhouse gases. Adaptation 
refers to processes of adjustment by natural or human systems to actual 
or expected climate and its effects, intended to moderate harm or 
exploit beneﬁcial opportunities. The presidency of the 23rd Conference 
Of the Parties of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change (UNFCCC) introduced the oceans pathway into the climate 
solution space, acknowledging both the importance of the ocean in 
the climate system and that ocean commitments for adaptation and 
mitigation are available through Nationally Determined Contributions 
under the UNFCCC (Gallo et al., 2017).
1.6.1 
Mitigation and Adaptation Options  
in the Ocean and Cryosphere
Mitigation and adaptation pathways to avoid dangerous 
anthropogenic interference with the climate system (United Nations, 
Framing and Context of the Report  
Chapter 1

93
1992) are considered in SR15 (IPCC, 2018). SROCC assesses 
several ocean and cryosphere-speciﬁc measures for mitigation and 
adaptation including options for to address the causes of climate 
change, support biological and ecological adaptation, and enhance 
societal adaptation (Figure 1.2). Other measures have been proposed, 
including solar radiation management and several other forms of 
carbon dioxide removal, but these are not addressed in SROCC as 
they are covered in other products of the IPCC Sixth Assessment 
Cycle (SR15 and AR6 Working Group III) and are outside the scope of 
SROCC. SROCC does assess indirect mitigation measures that involve 
the ocean and the cryosphere (Figure 1.2) by supporting biological 
and ecological adaptation, such as through reducing nutrient and 
organic carbon pollution (which moderates ocean acidiﬁcation in 
eutrophied areas) and conservation (which preserves biodiversity 
and habitats) in coastal regions (Billé et al., 2013).
A literature-based expert assessment shows that ocean-related 
mitigation measures have trade-offs, with the greatest beneﬁts 
derived by combining global and local measures (high conﬁdence; 
Gattuso et al., 2018). Local measures, such as pollution reduction and 
conservation, provide signiﬁcant co-beneﬁts and few adverse side 
effects (high conﬁdence; Sections 5.5.1, 5.5.2). They can be relatively 
rapidly implemented, but are generally less effective in addressing 
the global problem (high conﬁdence; Sections 5.5.1, 5.5.2). Likewise, 
local efforts to decrease air pollution near mountain glaciers and 
other cryosphere components, for example reducing black carbon 
emissions, can bring regional-scale beneﬁts for health and in reducing 
snow and ice-melt (Shindell et al., 2012; Box 2.2).
Well-chosen human interventions can enhance the adaptive capacity 
of natural systems to climate change. Such interventions through 
manipulating an ecosystem’s structural or functional properties 
(e.g.,  restoration of mangroves) may minimise climate change 
pressures, enhance natural resilience and/or re-direct ecosystem 
responses to reduce cascading risks on societies. In human systems, 
adaptation can involve both infrastructure (e.g., enhanced sea 
defences) and community-based action (e.g., changes in policies 
and practices). Adaptation options to ongoing climate change are 
most effective when considered together with mitigation strategies 
because there are limits to effective adaptation, mitigation actions 
can make adaptation more difﬁcult, and some adaptation measures 
may increase greenhouse gas emissions.
Adaptation and mitigation decisions are connected with economic 
concerns. In SROCC, two main economic approaches are used. The 
ﬁrst comprises the Total Economic Value method and the valuation 
of ecosystem services. SROCC considers the paradigm of sustainable 
development, and the linkages between climate impacts on ecosystem 
services (Section 5.4.1) and the consequences on SDGs including food 
security or poverty eradication (Section 5.4.2). The second economic 
approach used are formal decision analysis methods, which help to 
identify options (also called alternatives) that perform best or well 
with regards to given objectives. These methods include cost-beneﬁt 
analysis, multi-criteria analysis and robust decision-making and are 
speciﬁcally relevant for appraising long-term investment decisions in 
the context of coastal adaptation (Section 4.4.4.6).

1.6.2 
Adaptation in Natural Systems, Ecosystems, 
and Human Systems
In AR5, a range of changes in ocean and cryosphere natural systems 
were linked with medium to high conﬁdence to pressures associated 
with climate change (Cramer et al., 2014). Climate change impacts 
on natural ecosystems are variable in space and time. The multiplicity 
of pressures these natural systems experience impedes attribution 
of population or ecosystem responses to a speciﬁc ocean and/or 
cryosphere change. Moreover, the interconnectivity of populations 
within ecosystems means that a single ‘adaptive response’ of a 
population, or the aggregate response of an ecosystem (the adaptive 
responses of the interconnected populations), is inﬂuenced not just 
by direct pressures of climate change, but occurs in concert with 
the adaptive responses of other species in the ecosystem, further 
complicating efforts to disentangle speciﬁc patterns of adaptation.
Notwithstanding the network of pressures and adaptations, much 
effort has gone into resolving the mechanisms, interactions and 
feedbacks of natural systems associated with the ocean and 
cryosphere. Chapters 4, 5 and 6, as well as Cross-Chapter Box 9, 
assess new knowledge on the adaptive responses of wetlands, 
coral reefs, other coastal habitats, and the populations of marine 
organisms encountering ocean-based risks, including. Likewise, 
Chapters 2 and 3 describe emerging knowledge on how ecosystems 
in high-mountain and polar areas are adapting to cryosphere decline. 
AR5 and SR15 have highlighted the importance of evolutionary 
adaptation as a component of how populations adapt to climate 
change pressures (e.g.,  Pörtner et al., 2014; Hoegh-Guldberg 
et al., 2018). Acclimatisation (variation in morphology, physiology or 
behaviour) can result from changes in gene expression but does not 
involve change in the underlying DNA sequence. Responses related 
to acclimatisation can occur both within single generations and over 
several generations. In contrast, evolution requires changes in the 
genetic composition of a population over multiple generations; for 
example, by differential survival or fecundity of different genotypes 
(Sunday et al., 2014). Adaptive evolution is the subset of evolution 
attributable to natural selection, and natural selection may lead to 
populations becoming more ﬁt (Sunday et al., 2014) or extend the 
range of environments where populations persist (van Oppen et al., 
2015). The efﬁcacy of natural selection is affected by population size 
(Charlesworth, 2009), standing genetic variation, the ability of a 
population to generate novel genetic variation, migration rates and 
the frequency of genetic recombination (Rice, 2002). Many studies 
have shown evolution of traits within and across life stages of 
populations (Pespeni et al., 2013; Hinners et al., 2017), but there are 
fewer studies on how evolutionary change can impact ecosystem or 
community function, and whether trait evolution is stable (Schaum 
and Collins, 2014). Although acclimatisation and evolutionary 
adaptation are separate processes, they inﬂuence each other, and 
both adaptive and maladaptive variation of traits can facilitate 
evolution (Schaum and Collins, 2014; Ghalambor et al., 2015). 
Natural evolutionary adaptation may be challenged by the speed and 
magnitude of current ocean and cryosphere changes, but emerging 
studies investigate how human actions may assist evolutionary 
adaptation and thereby possibly enhance the resilience of natural 
systems to climate change pressures (e.g., Box 5.4 in Section 5.5.2). 
Through acclimatisation and evolutionary adaptation to the pressures 
from climate change (and all other persistent pressures), populations, 
species and ecosystems present a constantly changing context for 
the adaptation of human systems to climate change. 
There are several human adaptation options for climate change 
impacts on the ocean and cryosphere. Adaptive responses include 
nature- and ecosystem-based approaches (Renaud et al., 2016; Serpetti 
et al., 2017). Additionally, more social-based approaches for human 
adaptation range from community-based and infrastructure-based 
approaches to managed retreat, along with other forms of internal 
migration (Black et al., 2011; Hino et al., 2017). Building on AR5 (Wong 
et al., 2014), Chapter 4 describes four main modes of adaptation to 
mean and extreme sea level rise: protect, advance, accommodate, 
and retreat. This report demonstrates that all modes of adaptation 
include mixes of institutional, individual, socio-cultural, engineering, 
behavioural and/or ecosystem-based measures (e.g., Section 4.4.2). 
The effectiveness and performance of different adaptation options 
across spatial and social scales is inﬂuenced by their social 
acceptance, political feasibility, cost-efﬁciency, co-beneﬁts and 
trade-offs (Jones et al., 2012; Adger et al., 2013; Eriksen et al., 2015). 
Scientiﬁc evaluation of past successes and future options, including 
understanding barriers, limits, risks and opportunities, are complex 
and inadequately researched (Magnan and Ribera, 2016). In the end, 
adaptation priorities will depend on multiple parameters including 
the extent and rate of climate change, the risk attitudes and social 
preferences of individuals and institutions (and the returns they may 
gain) (Adger et al., 2009; Brügger et al., 2015; Evans et al., 2016; Neef 
et al., 2018) and access to ﬁnances, technology, capacity and other 
resources (Berrang-Ford et al., 2014; Eisenack et al., 2014).
Since AR5, transformational adaptation (i.e., the need for fundamental 
changes in private and public institutions and ﬂexible decision-making 
processes to face climate change consequences) has been 
increasingly studied (Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 1). The recent 
literature documents how societies, institutions, and/or individuals 
increasingly assume a readiness to engage in transformative change, 
via their acceptance and promotion of fundamental alterations 
in natural or human systems (Klinsky et al., 2016). People living in 
and near coastal, mountain and polar environments often pioneer 
these types of transformations, since they are at the forefront of 
ocean and cryosphere change (e.g., Solecki et al., 2017). Community 
led and indigenous led adaptation research continues to burgeon 
(Ayers and Forsyth, 2009; David-Chavez and Gavin, 2018), especially 
in many mountain (Section  2.3.2.3), Arctic (Section  3.5), and

and demonstrate potential for enabling transformational adaptation 
(Dodman and Mitlin, 2013; Chung Tiam Fook, 2017). Similarly, the 
concepts of scenario planning and ‘adaptation pathway’ design 
have expanded since AR5, especially in the context of development 
planning for coastal and delta regions (Section 4.4, Cross-Chapter 
Box 9; Wise et al., 2014; Maier et al., 2016; Bloemen et al., 2018; 
Flynn et al., 2018; Frame et al., 2018; Lawrence et al., 2018).

Governance and Institutions
SROCC conceptualises governance as deciding, managing, 
implementing and monitoring policies in the context of ocean and 
cryosphere change. Institutions are deﬁned as formal and informal 
social rules that shape human behaviour (Roggero et al., 2017). 
Governance guides how different actors negotiate, mediate their 
interests and share their rights and responsibilities (Forino et al., 
2015; See SROCC Annex I: Glossary and Cross-Chapter Box  3 in 
Chapter 1 for deﬁnition). Governance and institutions interface with 
climate and social-ecological change process across local, regional 
and global scales (Fischer et al., 2015; Pahl-Wostl, 2019). 
SROCC explores how the interlinked social-ecological systems affect 
challenge current governance systems in the context of ocean and 
cryosphere change. These challenges include three aspects. First, 
the scale of changes to ocean and cryosphere properties driven by 
global warming, and in the ecosystems they support and services 
they provide, are poorly matched to existing scales of governance 
(Sections 2.2.2.1; 2.3.1.3; 3.2.1; 3.5.3). Second, the nature of changes 
in ecosystem services resulting from changes in ocean and cryosphere 
properties, including services provided to humans living far from the 
mountains and coasts, are poorly matched to existing institutions 
and processes of governance (Section 4.4.4). Third, many possible 
governance responses to these challenges could be of limited or 
diminished effectiveness unless they are coordinated on scales 
beyond that of currently available governance options (Section 6.9.2; 
Box 5.5).
Hydrological processes in the high mountain cryosphere connect 
through upstream and downstream areas of river basins (Molden 
et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2018), including ﬂoodplains and deltaic 
regions (Kilroy, 2015; Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 1). These cross 
boundary linkages challenge local-scale governance and institutions 
that determine how the river-based ecosystem services that sustain 
food, water and energy are used and distributed (Rasul, 2014; Warner, 
2016; Lele et al., 2018; Pahl-Wostl et al., 2018). Small Island States 
face rising seas that threaten habitability of their homeland and the 
possibility of losing their nation-state, cultural identity and voices 
in international governance (Gerrard and Wannier, 2013; Philip, 
2018; Section 1.4, Cross-Chapter Box 9), highlighting the need for 
transboundary components to governance.
These governance challenges cannot be met without working across 
multiple organisations and institutions, bringing varying capacities, 
frameworks and spatial extents (Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 1). 
Progress in governance for ocean and cryosphere change will require 
ﬁlling gaps in legal frameworks (Amsler, 2016), aligning spatial 
mismatches (Eriksen et al., 2015; Young, 2016; Cosens et al., 2018), 
improving the ability for nations to cooperate effectively (Downie 
and Williams, 2018; Hall and Persson, 2018) and integrating across 
divided policy domains, most notably of climate change adaptation 
and disaster risk reduction (e.g., where slow sea level change also 
alters the implications for civil defense planning and the management 
of extreme events; Mysiak et al., 2018). 
Harmonising local, regional and global governance structures would 
provide an overarching policy framework for action and allocation 
of necessary resources for adaptation. Coordinating the top-down 
and bottom-up governance processes (Bisaro and Hinkel, 2016; Sabel 
and Victor, 2017; Homsy et al., 2019) to increase effectiveness of 
responses, mobilise and equitably distribute adequate resources and 
access private and public sector capabilities requires a polycentric 
approach to governance (Ostrom, 2010; Jordan et al., 2015). 
Polycentric governance connotes a complex form of governance with 
multiple centres of decision making working with some degree of 
autonomy (Carlisle and Gruby, 2017; Baldwin et al., 2018; Mewhirter 
et al., 2018; Hamilton and Lubell, 2019).

This Cross-Chapter Box outlines governance and associated institutional challenges and emerging solutions relevant to the ocean, 
coasts and cryosphere in a changing climate. It illustrates these through three cases: (Case 1) multi-level interactions in Ocean and 
Arctic governance; (Case 2) mountain governance; and (Case 3) coastal risk governance. Governance refers to how political, social, 
economic and environmental systems and their interactions are governed or ‘steered’ by establishing and modifying institutional and 
organisational arrangements which regulate social processes, mitigate conﬂicts and realise mutual gains (North, 1990; Pierre and 
Peters, 2000; Paavola, 2007). Institutions are formal and informal rules and norms, constructed and held in common by social actors 
that guide, constrain and shape human interactions (North, 1990; Ostrom, 2005). Formal institutions include constitutions, laws, 
policies and contracts, while informal institutions include customs, social norms and taboos. Both administrative or state government 
structures and indigenous or traditional governance structures govern the ocean, coasts and cryosphere.
Understanding governance in a changing climate
The Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC), together with the Special Report on Global 
Warming of 1.5ºC (SR15) (IPCC, 2018), highlights the critical role of governance in implementing effective climate adaptation.

regions (Section 2.4), focusing on the need for transboundary cooperation to support water governance and mitigate conﬂict. Chapter 3 
explores how polar governance system facilitate building resilient pathways, knowledge co-production, social learning, adaptation 
and power-sharing with Indigenous Peoples at the regional level. This would help in increasing international cooperation in multi-level 
governance arenas to strengthen responses supporting adaptation in socio-ecological systems (Section 3.5.4). Chapter 4 illustrates 
how sea level rise governance attempts to address conﬂicting interests in coastal development, risk management and adaptation with 
a diversity of governance contexts and degrees of community participation, with a focus on equity concerns and inevitable trade-offs 
(Section 4.4). Chapter 5 includes a review of existing international legal regimes for addressing ocean warming, acidiﬁcation and 
deoxygenation impacts on social-ecological systems and considers ways to facilitate appropriate responses to ocean change (Sections 
5.4, 5.5). Chapter 6 explores the issues of credibility, trust, and reliability in government that arise from promoting ‘paying the costs of 
preparedness and prevention’ as an alternative to ‘bearing the costs of loss and damage’ (Section 6.9).
Climate change challenges existing governance arrangements in a variety of ways. First, there are complex interconnections between 
climate change and other processes that inﬂuence the ocean, coasts and cryosphere, making it difﬁcult to untangle climate governance 
from other governance efforts. Second, the time frames for societal decision-making and government terms are mismatched with 
the long-term commitment of climate change. Third, governance choices have to be made in the face of uncertainty about the 
rate and scale of change that will occur in the medium to long-term (Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 1). Lastly, climate change 
progressively alters the environment and hence requires continual innovation and adjustment of governance arrangements (Bisaro 
and Hinkel, 2016; Roggero et al., 2018). Novel transboundary interactions and conﬂicts are emerging as well as new multi-level 
governance structures for international and regional cooperation, strengthening shared decision-making among States and other 
actors (Case 1). The prospects of ‘disappearing states’, glacier retreat and increasing water scarcity are resulting in States redeﬁning 
complex water-sharing agreements (Case 2). Coastal risk is escalating, which may require participatory governance responses and the 
co-production of knowledge at the local scale (Case 3; see also Cross-Chapter Box 9).
Governance, exercised through legal, administrative and other social processes, is essential to prevent, mitigate and adapt to 
the  challenges and risks posed by a changing climate. These governance processes determine roles in the exercising of power 
and  hence decision-making (Graham et al., 2003). Governance may be an act of governments (e.g.,  passing laws or providing

incentives or information such that citizens can respond more effectively to climate change); private sector actions (e.g., insurance); 
a co-operative effort among local actors governing themselves through customary law (e.g., by establishing entitlements or norms 
regulating the common use of scarce resources); a collaborative multi-level effort involving multiple actors (state, private and civil 
society; e.g., UNFCCC); or a multi-national effort (e.g., Antarctic Treaty; see Figure CB3.2). The complexities of governance arrangements 
in the ocean, coasts and cryosphere (Figure CB3.1), and the interactions and emergence of relationships between different governance 
actors in multiple conﬁgurations across various spatial scales (Figure CB3.2) are illustrated below.
Case Study 1  –  Multi-level Interactions and Synergies in Governance. The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the 
changing Arctic: Climate-change induced sea level rise (Section 4.2), could shift the boundaries and territory of some coastal states, 
changing the areas where their coastal rights are applied under UNCLOS. In extreme cases, inundation from sea level rise might 
lead to loss of territory and sovereignty, the disappearance of islands and the loss of international maritime jurisdiction subject to 
maritime claim. These challenges have limited opportunities for recourse in international law and it remains unclear what adequate 
responses from an international law perspective would be (Vidas et al., 2015; Andreone, 2017; Mayer and Crépeau, 2017; Chircop 
et al., 2018). While speciﬁc legal arrangements and instruments of environmental protection are in place at a regional, sub-regional 
and national level, they are insufﬁcient to address the new challenges sea level rise brings. Institutional responses to the geopolitical 
transformation caused by climate change, such as through the Arctic Council (AC) and the ‘Law of the Sea’ are still evolving. Similar to 
many international agreements, UNCLOS ‘Law of the Sea’ provisions for enforcement, compliance, monitoring and dispute settlement 
mechanisms are not comprehensive, and commonly depend on further, detailed law-making by state parties, acting through competent 
international organizations (Vidas, 2000; Karim, 2015; De Lucia, 2017; Grip, 2017). Shifts from traditional state-based practices of 
international law to multi-level and informal governance structures that involve state and non-state actors (including Indigenous 
Peoples) may address these challenges (medium conﬁdence; Cassotta, 2012; Shadian, 2014; Young, 2016; Andreone, 2017). The AC is 
a regionally focused governance structure blending new forms of formal and informal multi-level regional cooperation (Young, 2016). 
The soft law mechanisms employed draw upon best available practice and standards from multiple knowledge systems (Cassotta and 
Mazza, 2015; Pincus and Ali, 2015) in an attempt to respond to the ocean’s global, trans-regional and national climate challenges 
(Section 3.5.4.2). Reconﬁguration and restructuring of the AC has been proposed in order to address emerging trans-regional and global 
problems (high conﬁdence; Baker and Yeager, 2015; Pincus and Ali, 2015; Young, 2016). Within the existing scope, the AC has ampliﬁed 
the voice of Arctic people affected by the impacts of climate change and mobilized action (Koivurova, 2016). The inﬂuence of actors 
‘beyond the state’ is emerging (Figure CB3.2). However, the state retains its importance in tackling the new challenges produced by 
climate change, as the role of international cooperation in UNCLOS and the Polar Regions demonstrates (Section 3.5.4.2). For example, 
Article 234 (Ice-covered areas) and Article 197 of the UNCLOS Convention in protecting the marine environment, states that ‘States shall 
cooperate on a global basis and, as appropriate, on a regional basis […] taking into account characteristic regional features’.
Case Study 2  –  Mountain Governance: Water management in Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan. Gilgit-Baltistan is an arid territory 
in a mountainous region of northern Pakistan. Melt water fed streams supply irrigation water for rural livelihoods (Nüsser and 
Schmidt, 2017). The labour intensive work of constructing and maintaining gravity-fed irrigation canals is done by jirga, traditional 
community associations. As glaciers retreat due to climate change, water sources at the edge of glaciers have been impacted, reducing 
water available for irrigation. In response, villagers constructed new channels accessing more distant water for irrigation needs 
(Parveen et al., 2015). The Aga Khan Development Network supported this substantial task by providing funding and developing a new 
kind of cross-scale governance network, drawing on local residents for staff (Walter, 2014), and strengthening community resources, 
training and networks. Challenges remain, including the potential for increased rainfall causing landslides that could damage new 
canals, and possible expansion of Pakistan’s hydropower infrastructure that would further diminish water resources and displace 
villages (Shaikh et al., 2015). On a geopolitical scale, decreased water supplies from the glaciers could exacerbate tensions over water 
resources in the region, impacting water management in many parts of the Indus watershed (Uprety and Salman, 2011; Jamir, 2016; 
see Section 2.3.1.4 for details).
Case Study 3  –  Coastal Governance: Risk management for sea level changes in the City of Cape Town, South Africa. Sea level 
rise and coastal ﬂooding are the focus of the City of Cape Town’s coastal climate adaptation efforts. The Milnerton coastline High 
Water Mark, a non-static line marking the high tide, is creating a governance conﬂict by moving landwards (due to sea level rise) 
and intersecting with private property boundaries, threatening public beaches and the dune cordon and placing private property 
and  municipal infrastructure at risk in storm conditions (Sowman et al., 2016). Private property owners are using a mixture 
of formal, ad hoc, and in some cases illegal, coastal barrier measures to protect their assets from sea level and storm risks, but 
these are creating additional erosion impacts on the coastline. Legally, the City of Cape Town is not responsible for remediating

private land impacted by coastal erosion (Smith et al., 2016). However, city ofﬁcials feel compelled to take action for the common good 
using a progressive, multi-stakeholder participatory approach. This involves opening up opportunities for dialogue and co-producing 
knowledge, instead of a purely legalistic and state-centric compliance approach (Colenbrander et al., 2015). The city’s actions are 
both mindful of international frameworks on climate change and responsive to national and provincial legislation and policy. A major 
challenge that remains is how to navigate the power struggles that will be triggered by this consultative process, as different actors 
deﬁne and negotiate their interests, roles and responsibilities (see Section 4.4.3; Table 4.9). 
Conclusions
These cases illustrate four important points. First, new governance challenges are emerging due to climate change, including: disruptions 
to long-established cultures, livelihoods and even territorial sovereignty (Case 1); changes in the accessibility and availability of vital 
resources (Case 2); and the blurring of public and private boundaries of risk and responsibility through accelerated coastal erosion 
(Case 3; Figure CB3.1). Second, new governance arrangements are emerging to address these challenges, including participatory and 
networked structures linking formal and informal networks, and involving state, private sector, indigenous and civil society actors in 
different conﬁgurations (Figure CB3.2). Third, climate governance is a complex, contested and unfolding process, with governance 
actors and networks having to learn from experience, to innovate and develop context-relevant arrangements that can be adjusted 
in the face of ongoing change. Lastly, there is no single climate governance panacea for the ocean, coasts and cryosphere. Empirical 
evidence on which governance arrangements work well in which context is still limited, but ‘good governance’ norms indicate the 
importance of inclusivity, fairness, deliberation, reﬂexivity, responsiveness,  social learning, the co-production of knowledge and 
respect for ethnic and cultural diversity.
1.8 
Knowledge Systems for Understanding 
and Responding to Change
Assessments of how climate change interacts with the planet and 
people are largely based on scientiﬁc knowledge from observations, 
theories, modelling and synthesis to understand physical and 
ecological systems (Section 1.8.1), societies (e.g., Cross-Chapter Box 2 
in Chapter 1, Section 1.5) and institutions (e.g., Cross-Chapter Box 3 
in Chapter 1). However, humans integrate information from multiple 
sources to observe and interact with their environment, respond to 
changes, and solve problems. Accordingly, SROCC also recognises 
the importance of Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge in 
understanding and responding to changes in the ocean and cryosphere 
(Sections 1.8.2, 1.8.3; Cross-Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 1).
1.8.1 
Scientiﬁc Knowledge
1.8.1.1 
Ocean and Cryosphere Observations 
Long-term sustained observations are critical for detecting and 
understanding the processes of ocean and cryosphere change (Rhein 
et al., 2013; Vaughan et al., 2013). Scientiﬁc knowledge of the ocean 
and cryosphere has increased through time and geographical space 
(Figure  1.3). In situ ocean subsurface temperature and salinity 
observations have increased in spatial and temporal coverage 
since the middle of the 19th century (Abraham et al., 2013), and 
near global coverage (60ºS–60ºN) of the upper 2,000 m has been 
achieved since 2007 due to the international Argo network (Riser 
et al., 2016; Figure  1.3). Improved data quality and data analysis 
techniques have reduced uncertainties in global ocean heat uptake 
estimates (Sections 1.4.1, 5.2.2). In addition to providing deep ocean 
measurements, repeated hydrographic physical and biogeochemical 
observations since AR5 have led to improved estimates of ocean 
carbon uptake and ocean deoxygenation (Sections 1.4.1, 5.2.2.3, 
5.2.2.4). Targeted observational programmes have improved 
scientiﬁc knowledge for speciﬁc regions and physical processes of 
particular concern in a warming climate, including the Greenland and 
West Antarctic ice sheets (Section 3.3), and the AMOC (Section 6.7). 
Ocean and cryosphere mass changes and sea level studies have 
beneﬁted from sustained or newly implemented satellite-based 
remote sensing technologies, complemented by in situ data such as 
tide gauges measurements (Sections 3.3, 4.2; Dowell et al., 2013; 
Raup et al., 2015; PSMSL, 2016). Glacier length measurements in 
some locations go back many centuries (Figure  1.3), but it is the 
systematic high resolution satellite monitoring of a large number of 
the world’s glaciers since the late 1970s that has improved global 
assessments of glacier mass loss (Sections 2.2.3, 3.3.2). 
Limitations in knowledge of ocean and cryosphere change remain, 
creating knowledge gaps for the SROCC assessment. Ocean and 
cryosphere datasets are frequently short, and do not always span 
the key IPCC assessment time intervals (Cross-Chapter Box  1 in 
Chapter 1), so for many parameters the full magnitude of changes 
since the pre-industrial period is not observed (Figure  1.3). The 
brevity of ocean and cryosphere measurements also means that 
some expected changes cannot yet be detected with conﬁdence in 
direct observations (e.g., Antarctic sea ice loss in Section 3.2.1, AMOC 
weakening in Section 6.7.1), or other observed changes cannot yet be 
robustly attributed to anthropogenic factors (e.g., ice sheet mass loss 
in Section 3.3.1). Observations for many key ocean variables (Bojinski 
et al., 2014), such as ocean currents, surface heat ﬂuxes, oxygen, 
inorganic carbon, subsurface salinity, phytoplankton biomass and 
diversity, etc., do not yet have global coverage or have not reached 
Chapter 1 
Framing and Context of the Report

the required density or accuracy for detection of change. Some ocean 
and cryosphere areas remain difﬁcult to observe systematically, 
for example, the ocean under sea ice, subsurface permafrost, high 
mountain areas, marginal seas, coastal areas (Section  4.2.2.3) 
and ocean boundary currents (Hu and Sprintall, 2016), basin 
interconnections (Section  6.6) and the Southern Ocean (Sections 
3.2, 5.2.2). Measurements that reﬂect ecosystem change are often 
location or species speciﬁc, and assessments of long-term ocean 
ecosystem changes are currently only feasible for a limited subset 
of variables, for example coral reef health (e.g., coral reef health) 
(Section 5.3; Miloslavich et al., 2018). The deep ocean below 2,000 m 
is still rarely observed (Talley et al., 2016), limiting (for example) the 
accurate estimate of deep ocean heat uptake and, consequently the 
full magnitude of Earth’s energy imbalance (e.g., von Schuckmann 
et al., 2016; Johnson et al., 2018; Sections 1.2, 1.4, 5.2.2).
1.8.1.2 
Reanalysis Products 
Advances have been made over the past decade in developing more 
reliable and more highly resolved ocean and atmosphere reanalysis 
products. Reanalysis products combine observational data with 
numerical models through data assimilation to produce physically 
consistent, and spatially complete ocean and climate products 
(Balmaseda et al., 2015; Lellouche et al., 2018; Storto et al., 2018; 
Zuo et al., 2018). Ocean reanalyses are widely used to understand 
changes in physical properties (Section  3.2.1, 5.2), extremes 
(Sections 6.3 to 6.6), circulation (Section  6.6, 6.7) and to provide 
climate diagnostics (Wunsch et al., 2009; Balmaseda et al., 2013; Hu 
and Sprintall, 2016; Carton et al., 2018). Reanalysis products are used 
in SROCC for assessing climate change process that cause changes 
in the ocean and cryosphere (e.g., Sections 2.2.1, 3.2.1, 3.3.1, 3.4.1, 
5.2.2, 6.3.1, 6.6.1, 6.7.1). Improvements in reanalysis products 
provide more realistic forcing for regional models, which are used 
for assessing regional ocean and cryosphere changes that cannot be 
resolved in global-scale models (e.g., Section 2.2.1; Mazloff et al., 
2010; Fenty et al., 2017). The weather forecasts, and seasonal to 
decadal predictions building on reanalysis products have important 
applications in the early warning systems that reduce risk and aid 
human adaptation to extreme events (Sections 6.3.4, 6.4.3, 6.5.3, 
6.7.3, 6.8.5).
1.8.1.3 
Model Simulation Data
Models are numerical approximations of the Earth system that allow 
hypotheses about the mechanisms of ocean and cryosphere change 
to be tested, support attribution of observed changes to speciﬁc 
forcings (Section  1.3), and are the best available information for 
assessing future change (Figure  1.3). General Circulation Models 
(GCMs) typically simulate the atmosphere, ocean, sea ice, and land 
surface, and sometimes also incorporate terrestrial and marine 
ecosystems. Earth System Models (ESM) are climate models that 
explicitly include the carbon cycle and may include additional 
components (e.g.,  atmospheric chemistry, ice sheets, dynamic 
vegetation, nitrogen cycle, but also urban or crop models). The 
systematic set of global-scale model experiments (Taylor et al., 2012) 
used in SROCC were produced by CMIP5 (Cross-Chapter Box 1 in 
Chapter 1), including both GCMs and ESMs. 
Models may differ in their spatial resolution, and in the extent 
to which processes are explicitly represented or approximated 
(parameterised). Model output can be biased due to uncertainties in 
their physical equations or parameterisations, speciﬁcation of initial 
conditions, knowledge of external forcing factors, and unaccounted 
processes and feedbacks (Hawkins and Sutton, 2009; Deser et al., 
2012; Gupta et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2016). Since AR5 there have been 
advances in modelling the dynamical processes of the Greenland 
and Antarctica ice sheets, leading to better representation of the 
range of potential future sea level rise scenarios (Sections 4.2.3). 
Downscaling, including the use of regional models, makes it possible 
to improve the spatial resolution of model output in order to better 
resolve past and future climate change in speciﬁc areas, such as high 
mountains and coastal seas (e.g., Sections 2.2.2, 3.2.3, 3.5.4, 4.2.2, 
6.3.1). For biological processes, such as nutrient levels and organic 
matter production, model uncertainty at regional scales is the main 
issue limiting conﬁdence in future projections (Sections 5.3, 5.7). 
While model projections of range shifts for ﬁshes agree with theory 
and observations, at a regional scale there are known deﬁciencies in 
the ways models represent the impacts of ocean variables such as 
temperature and productivity (Sections 5.2.3, 5.7).
1.8.1.4 
Palaeoclimate Data
Palaeoclimate data provide a way to establish the nature of ocean 
and cryosphere changes prior to direct measurements (Figure 1.3), 
including natural variability and early anthropogenic climate change 
(Masson-Delmotte et al., 2013; Abram et al., 2016). Palaeoclimate 
records utilise the accumulation of physical, chemical or biological 
properties within natural archives that are related to climate at the 
time the archive formed. Commonly used palaeoclimate evidence 
for ocean and cryosphere change comes from marine and lake 
sediments, ice layers and bubbles, tree growth rings, past shorelines 
and shallow reef deposits. In many mountain areas, centuries to 
millennia of palaeoclimate information is now being lost through 
widespread melting of glacier ice (Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 2). 
Palaeoclimate data are spatially limited (Figure  1.3), but often 
represent regional to global-scale climate patterns, either individually 
or as syntheses of networks of data (PAGES2K Consortium, 2017). 
Palaeoclimate data provide evidence for multi-metre global sea 
level rises and shifts in climate zones and ocean ecosystems during 
past warm climate states where temperatures were similar to those 
expected later this century (Hansen et al., 2016; Fischer et al., 2018; 
Section 4.2.2). Palaeoclimate reconstructions give context to recent 
ocean and cryosphere changes that are unusual in the context of 
variability over past centuries to millennia, including acceleration in 
Greenland and Antarctic Peninsula ice-melt (Section 3.3.1), declining 
Arctic sea ice (Section 3.2.1), and emerging evidence for a slowdown 
of AMOC (Section 6.7.1). Assessments of climate model performance 
across a wider-range of climate states than is possible using direct 
observations alone also draws on palaeoclimate data (Flato et al., 
2013), and since AR5 important progress has been made to calibrate 
modelled ice sheet processes and future sea level rise based on 
palaeoclimate evidence (Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3).

1.8.2 
Indigenous Knowledge and Local Knowledge
Humans create, use, and adapt knowledge systems to interact with 
their environment (Agrawal, 1995; Escobar, 2001; Sillitoe, 2007), and 
to observe and respond to change (Huntington, 2000; Gearheard et al., 
2013; Maldonado et al., 2016; Yeh, 2016). Indigenous knowledge 
(IK) refers to the understandings, skills, and philosophies developed 
by societies with long histories of interaction with their natural 
surroundings. It is passed on from generation to generation, ﬂexible, 
and adaptive in changing conditions, and increasingly challenged 
in the context of contemporary climate change. Local knowledge 
(LK) is what non-Indigenous communities, both rural and urban, 
use on a daily and lifelong basis. It is multi-generational, embedded 
in community practices and cultures and adaptive to changing 
conditions (FAO, 2018). Each chapter of SROCC cites examples of IK 
and LK related to ocean and cryosphere change.
IK and LK stand on their own, and also enrich and complement each 
other and scientiﬁc knowledge. For example, Australian Aboriginal 
groups’ Indigenous oral history provides empirical corroboration of 
the sea level rise 7,000 years ago (Nunn and Reid, 2016), and their 
seasonal calendars direct hunting, ﬁshing, planting, conservation and 
detection of unusual changes today (Green et al., 2010). LK works in 
tandem with scientiﬁc knowledge, for example, as coastal Australian 
communities consider the impacts and trade-offs of sea level rise 
(O’Neill and Graham, 2016).
Both IK and LK are increasingly used in climate change research 
and policy efforts to engage affected communities to facilitate 
site-speciﬁc understandings of, and responses to, the local effects of 
climate change (Hiwasaki et al., 2014; Hou et al., 2017; Mekonnen 
et al., 2017). IK and LK enrich CRDPs particularly by engaging 
multiple stakeholders and the diversity of socioeconomic, cultural 
and linguistic contexts of populations affected by changes in the 
ocean and cryosphere (Cross-Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 1). 
Global environmental assessments increasingly recognise the 
importance of IK and LK (Thaman et al., 2013; Beck et al., 2014; 
Díaz et al., 2015). References to IK in IPCC assessment reports 
increased 60% from AR4 to AR5, and highlighted the exposures and 
vulnerabilities of Indigenous populations to climate change risks 
related to socioeconomic status, resource-based dependence and 
geographic location (Ford et al., 2016a). All four IPBES assessments 
in 2018 (IPBES, 2018a; IPBES, 2018b; IPBES, 2018c; IPBES, 2018d) 
engaged IK and LK (Díaz et al., 2015; Roué and Molnar, 2017; Díaz 
et al., 2018). Peer-reviewed research on IK and LK is burgeoning 
(Savo et al., 2016), providing information that can guide responses 
and inform policy (Huntington, 2011; Nakashima et al., 2012; 
Lavrillier and Gabyshev, 2018). However, most global assessments 
still fail to incorporate ‘the plurality and heterogeneity of worldviews’ 
(Obermeister, 2017), resulting ‘in a partial understanding of core 
issues that limits the potential for locally and culturally appropriate 
adaptation responses’ (Ford et al., 2016b).
IK and LK provide case speciﬁc information that may not be easily 
extrapolated to the scales of disturbance that humans exert on 
natural systems (Wohling, 2009). Some forms of IK and LK are 
also not amenable to being captured in peer-reviewed articles or 
published reports, and efforts to translate IK and LK into qualitative 
or quantitative data may mute the multidimensional, dynamic and 
nuanced features that give IK and LK meaning (DeWalt, 1994; 
Roncoli et al., 2009; Goldman and Lovell, 2017). Nonetheless, efforts 
to collaborate with IK and LK knowledge holders (Baptiste et al., 
2017; Karki et al., 2017; Lavrillier and Gabyshev, 2017; Roué et al., 
2017; David-Chavez and Gavin, 2018) and to systematically assess 
published IK and LK literature in parallel with scientiﬁc knowledge 
result in increasingly effective usage of the multiple knowledge 
systems to better characterise and address ocean and cryosphere 
change (Huntington et al., 2017; Nalau et al., 2018; Ford et al., 2019).
1.8.3 
The Role of Knowledge in People’s Responses 
to Climate, Ocean and Cryosphere Change 
To hold global average temperature to well below 2ºC above 
pre-industrial levels, substantial changes in the day-to-day activities of 
individuals, families, communities, the private sector, and governance 
bodies will be required (Ostrom, 2010; Creutzig et al., 2018). Enabling 
these changes at a meaningful societal scale requires sensitivity to 
communities and their use of multiple knowledge systems to best 
motivate effective responses to the risks and opportunities posed by 
climate change (medium conﬁdence) (1.8.2, Cross-Chapter Box 4 in 
Chapter 1). Meaningful engagement of people and communities with 
climate change information depends on that information cohering 
with their perception of how the world works (Crate and Fedorov, 
2013). The values and identities people hold affect how acceptable 
they ﬁnd the behavioural changes, technological solutions and 
governance that climate change action requires (Moser, 2016). 
Education and climate literacy contribute to climate change action 
and adaptation (high conﬁdence). Although public understanding 
of humanity’s role in both causing and abating climate change 
has increased in the last decade (Milfont et al., 2017), levels of 
climate concern vary greatly globally (Lee et al., 2015). Educational 
attainment has the strongest effect on raising climate change 
awareness (Lee et al., 2015), and research documents the value of 
evidence-based climate change education, particularly during formal 
schooling (Motta, 2018). People further understand climate change 
as a serious threat when they experience it in their lives and have 
knowledge of its human causes (Lee et al., 2015; Shi et al., 2016). 
Education and tailored climate communication strategies that are 
respectful of people’s values and identity can aid acceptance and 
implementation of the local to global-scale approaches and policies 
required for effective climate change mitigation and adaptation (Shi 
et al., 2016; Anisimov and Orttung, 2018; Sections 3.5.4, 4.4), while 
also supporting CRDPs (see also Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 1, 
and FAQ1.2). 
Human psychology complicates engagement with climate change, 
due to complex social factors, including values (Corner et al., 2014), 
identity (Unsworth and Fielding, 2014), ideology (Smith and Mayer, 
2019) and the framing of climate messaging. Additionally, psychology 
Framing and Context of the Report  
Chapter 1

103
effects adaptation actions, motivated by perceptions that others 
are already adapting, avoidance of an unpleasant state of mind, 
feelings of self-efﬁcacy and belief in the efﬁcacy of the adaptation 
action (van Valkengoed and Steg, 2019). Better understandings of 
the psychological implications across diverse communities and social 
and political contexts will facilitate a just transition of both emissions 
reduction and adaptation (Schlosberg et al., 2017). Impacts of climate 
change on natural and human environments (e.g., extreme weather) 
or human-caused modiﬁcations to the environment (e.g., adaptation) 
will raise further psychological challenges. This includes psychological 
impacts to the emotional wellbeing of people adversely affected 
by climate change (Ogunbode et al., 2018), resulting in solastalgia 
(Albrecht et al., 2007), a distress akin to homesickness while in their 
home environment (McNamara and Westoby, 2011).

Introduction
This Cross-Chapter Box describes how Indigenous knowledge (IK) and local knowledge (LK) are different and unique sources 
of knowledge, which are critical to observing, responding to, and governing the ocean and cryosphere in a changing climate (See SROCC 
Annex I: Glossary for deﬁnitions). International organisations recognise the importance of IK and LK in global assessments, including 
UN Environment, UNDP, UNESCO, IPBES, and the World Bank. IK and LK are referenced throughout SROCC, understanding that 
many climate change impacts affect, and will require responses from, local communities (both Indigenous and non-Indigenous) who 
maintain a close connection with the ocean and/or cryosphere.
Attention to IK and LK in understanding global change is relatively recent, but important (high conﬁdence). For instance, in 1980, 
Alaskan Inuit formed the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission in response to the International Whaling Commission’s science that 
underestimated the Bowhead whale population and, in 1977, banned whaling as a result (Huntington, 1992). The Commission 
facilitated an improved population count using a study design based on IK, which indicated a harvestable population (Huntington, 
2000). There are various approaches for utilising multiple knowledge systems. For example, the Mi’kmaw Elders’ concept of Two Eyed 
Seeing: which is ‘learning to see from one eye with the strengths of Indigenous knowledges, and from the other eye with the strengths 
of Western [scientiﬁc] knowledges, and to use both together, for the beneﬁt of all’ (Bartlett et al., 2012), to preserve the distinctiveness 
of each, while allowing for fuller understandings and actions (Bartlett et al., 2012: 334).
Knowledge Co-production
Scientiﬁc knowledge,  IK and LK can complement one another by engaging both quantitative data and qualitative information, 
including people’s observations, responses and values (Huntington, 2000; Crate and Fedorov, 2013; Burnham et al., 2016; Figure CB4.1). 
However, this process of knowledge co-production is complex (Jasanoff, 2004) and IK and LK possess uncertainties of a different 
nature from those of scientiﬁc knowledge (Kahneman and Egan, 2011), often resulting in the dominance of scientiﬁc knowledge over 
IK and LK in policy, governance and management (Mistry and Berardi, 2016). Working across disciplines (interdisciplinarity; Strang, 
2009), and/or engaging multiple stakeholders (transdisciplinarity; Klenk and Meehan, 2015; Crate et al., 2017), are approaches used 
to bridge knowledge systems. The use of all knowledge relevant to a speciﬁc challenge can involve approaches such as: scenario 
building across stakeholder groups to capture the multiple ways people perceive their environment and act within it (Klenk and 
Meehan, 2015); knowledge co-production to achieve collaborative management efforts (Armitage et al., 2011); and working with 
communities to identify shared values and perceptions that enable context-speciﬁc adaptation strategies (Grunblatt and Alessa, 
2017). Broad stakeholder engagement, including affected communities, Indigenous Peoples, local and regional representatives, policy 
makers, managers, interest groups and organisations, has the potential to effectively use all relevant knowledge (Obermeister, 2017) 
and produce results that reduce the disproportionate inﬂuence that formally educated and economically advantaged groups often 
exert in scientiﬁc assessments (Castree et al., 2014).

Contributions to SROCC
Observations, responses, and governance are three important contributions that IK and LK make in ocean and cryosphere change:
Observations: IK and LK observations document glacier and sea ice dynamics, permafrost dynamics, coastal processes, etc. 
(Sections 2.3.2.2.2, 2.5, 3.2.2, 3.4.1.1, 3.4.1.1, 3.4.1.2, 4.3.2.4.2, 5.2.3 and Box 2.4), and how they interact with social-cultural factors 
(West and Hovelsrud, 2010). Researchers have begun documenting IK and LK observations only recently (Sections 2.3.1.1, 3.2, 3.4, 
3.5, Box 4.4, 5.4.2.2.1).
Responses: Either IK or LK alone (Yager, 2015), or used with scientiﬁc knowledge (Nüsser and Schmidt, 2017) inform responses 
(Sections 2.3.1.3.2, 2.3.2.2.2, 3.5.2, 3.5.4, 4.4.2, Box 4.4, 5.5.2, 6.8.4, 6.9.2). Utilising multiple knowledge systems requires continued 
development, accumulation, and transmission of IK, LK and scientiﬁc knowledge towards understanding the ecological and cultural 
context of diverse peoples (Crate and Fedorov, 2013; Jones et al., 2016), resulting in the incorporation of relevant priorities and 
contexts into adaptation responses (Sections 3.5.2, 3.5.4, 4.4.4, 5.5.2, 6.8.4, 6.9.2, Box 2.3).
Governance: Using IK and LK in climate decision and policy making includes customary Indigenous and local institutions (Karlsson and 
Hovelsrud, 2015), as in the case when Indigenous communities are engaged in an integrated approach for disaster risk reduction in 
response to cryosphere hazards (Carey et al., 2015). The effective engagement of communities and stakeholders in decisions requires 
using the multiple knowledge systems available (Chilisa, 2011; Sections 2.3.1.3.2, 2.3.2.3, 3.5.4, 4.4.4, Table 4.4, 5.5.2, 6.8.4, 6.9.2; 
Sections 2.3.1.3.2, 2.3.2.3, 3.5.4, 4.4.4, Table 4.9, 5.5.2, 6.8.4, 6.9.2).

Panel A represents a context which uses one knowledge system, for example, of IK used by Indigenous peoples; or of LK used by farmers, ﬁshers and rural or 
urban inhabitants; or of scientiﬁc knowledge used in contexts where substantial human presence is lacking. Panel B depicts the use of two knowledge systems, as 
described in this Cross-Chapter Box in the case of Bowhead whale population counts and in Himalayan ﬂood management. Panel C illustrates the use of all three 
knowledge systems, as in the Paciﬁc case in this Cross-Chapter Box. Each collar represents how making use of knowledge from different systems is a matter of both 
identifying available knowledge across systems and of knowledge holder deliberations. In these processes, learning takes place on how to relate knowledge from 
different systems for the purpose of improved decisions and solutions. Knowledge from different systems can enrich the body of relevant knowledge while continuing 
independently or can be combined to co-produce new knowledge.

Examples from regions covered in this report
IK and LK in the Paciﬁc: Historically, Paciﬁc communities, who depend on marine resources for essential protein (Pratchett et al., 2011), 
use LK for management systems to determine access to, and closure of, ﬁshing grounds, the latter to respect community deaths, sacred 
sites, and customary feasts. Today a hybrid system, Locally Managed Marine Protected Areas (LMMAs), is common and integrates local 
governance with NGO or government agency interventions (Jupiter et al., 2014). The expected beneﬁts of these management systems 
support climate change adaptation through sustainable resource management (Roberts et al., 2017) and mitigation through improved 
carbon storage (Vierros, 2017). The challenges to wider use include both how to upscale LMMAs (Roberts et al., 2017; Vierros, 2017), 
and how to assess them as climate change adaptation and mitigation solutions (Rohe et al., 2017; Section 5.4).
IK and Pikialasorsuaq: Pikialasorsuaq (North Water Polynya), in Bafﬁn Bay, is the Arctic’s largest polynya, or area of open water 
surrounded by ice, and is also one of the most biologically productive regions in the Arctic (Barber et al., 2001). Adjacent Inuit communities 
depend on Pikialasorsuaq for their food security and subsistence economy (Hastrup et al., 2018). They use Qaujimajatuqangit, an IK 
system, in daily and seasonal activities (ICC, 2017). The sea ice bridge north of the Pikialasorsuaq is no longer forming as reliably as 
in the past, resulting in a polynya that is geographically and seasonally less deﬁned (Ryan and Münchow, 2017). In response, the 
Inuit Circumpolar Council initiated the Pikialasorsuaq Commission who formed an Inuit-led management authority to (1) oversee 
monitoring and research to conserve the polynya’s living resources; (2) identify an Indigenous Protected Area, to include the polynya 
and dependent communities; and (3) establish a free travel zone for Inuit across the Pikialasorsuaq region (ICC, 2017; Box 3.2).
LK in the Alps: Mountain guides and other local residents engaged in supporting mountain tourism draw on LK for livelihood 
management. A study at Mont Blanc lists speciﬁc cryosphere changes which they have observed, including glacial shrinkage and 
reduction in ice and snow cover. As a result, the categorisation of the difﬁculty of a number of routes has changed, and the timing 
of the climbing season has shifted earlier (Mourey and Ravanel, 2017; Section 2.3.5).
LK to manage ﬂooding: Climate change is increasing glacial melt water and rain-induced disasters in the Himalayan region and 
affected communities in China, Nepal, and India use LK to adapt (Nadeem et al., 2012). For instance, rains upstream in Gandaki 
(Nepal) ﬂood downstream areas of Bihar, India. Local communities’ knowledge of forecasting ﬂoods has evolved over time through 
the complexities of caste, class, gender and ecological ﬂux, and is critical to ﬂood forecasting and disaster risk reduction. Local 
communities manage risk by using a diverse set of knowledge, including phenomenological (e.g., river sound), ecological (e.g., red ant 
movement) and riverine (e.g., river colour) indicators, alongside meteorological and ofﬁcial information (Acharya and Prakash, 2018; 
Section 2.3.2.3).
Knowledge Holders’ Recommendations for Utilising IK and LK in Assessment Reports
Perspectives from the Himalayas: IK and LK holders in the Himalayas have conducted long-term systematic observations in these remote 
areas for centuries. Contemporary IK details change in phenology, weather patterns, and ﬂora and fauna species, which enriches scientiﬁc 
knowledge of glacial retreat and potential glacial lake outbursts (Sherpa, 2014). The scientiﬁc community can close many knowledge gaps 
by engaging IK and LK holders as counterparts. Suggestions towards this objective are to work with affected communities to elicit their 
knowledge of change, especially IK and LK holders with more specialised knowledge (farmers, herders, mountain guides, etc.), and use 
location- and culture-speciﬁc approaches to share scientiﬁc knowledge and use it with IK and LK.
Perspectives from the Inuit Circumpolar Council (ICC), Canada: Engaging Inuit as partners across all climate research disciplines 
ensures that Inuit knowledge and priorities guide research, monitoring, and the reporting of results in Inuit homeland. Doing so 
enhances the effectiveness, impact, and usefulness of global assessments, and ensures that Inuit knowledge is appropriately reported 
in assessments. Inuit seek to achieve self-determination in all aspects of research carried out in Inuit homeland (e.g., Nickels et al., 
2005). Inuit actively produce and use climate research (e.g., ITK, 2005; ICC, 2015) and lead approaches to address climate challenges 
spurred by great incentive to develop innovative solutions. Engaging Inuit representative organisations and governments as partners 
in research recognises that the best available knowledge includes IK, enabling more robust climate research that in turn informs 
climate policy. When interpreted and applied properly, IK comes directly from research by Inuit and from an Inuit perspective (ICC, 
2018). This can be achieved by working with Inuit on scoping and methodology for assessments and supporting inclusion of Inuit 
experts in research, analysis, and results dissemination.

Approaches Taken in this Special Report
1.9.1 
Methodologies Relevant to this Report
SROCC assesses literature on ocean and cryosphere change and 
associated impacts and responses, focusing on advances in knowledge 
since AR5. The literature used is primarily published, peer-reviewed 
scientiﬁc, social science and humanities research. In some cases, grey 
literature sources (for example, published reports from governments, 
industry, research institutes and non-government organisations) are 
used where there are important gaps in available peer-reviewed 
literature. It is recognised that published knowledge from many parts 
of the world most vulnerable to ocean and cryosphere change is still 
limited (Czerniewicz et al., 2017). 
Where possible, SROCC draws upon established methodologies 
and/or frameworks. Cross-Chapter Boxes in Chapter  1 address 
methodologies used for projections of future change (Cross-Chapter 
Box 1 in Chapter 1), for assessing and reducing risk (Cross-Chapter 
Box 2 in Chapter 1), for governance options relevant to a problem 
or region (Cross-Chapter Box  3 in Chapter  1), and for using IK 
and LK (Cross-Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 1). It is recognised in the 
assessment process that multiple and non-static factors determine 
human vulnerabilities to climate change impacts, and that 
ecosystems provide essential services that have both commercial 
and non-commercial value (Section 1.5). Economic methods are also 
important in SROCC, for estimating the economic value of natural 
systems, and for aiding decision-making around mitigation and 
adaptation strategies (Section 1.6).
1.9.2 
Communication of Conﬁdence 
in Assessment Findings
SROCC uses calibrated language for the communication of 
conﬁdence in the assessment process (Mastrandrea et al., 2010; 
Mach et al., 2017). Calibrated language is designed to consistently 
evaluate and communicate uncertainties that arise from incomplete 
knowledge due to a lack of information, or from disagreement about 
what is known or even knowable. The IPCC calibrated language 
uses qualitative expressions of conﬁdence based on the robustness 
of evidence for a ﬁnding, and (where possible) uses quantitative 
expressions to describe the likelihood of a ﬁnding (Figure 1.4).
Qualitative expressions (conﬁdence scale) describe the validity  
of a ﬁnding based on the type, amount, quality and consistency of  
evidence, and the degree of agreement between different lines 
of evidence (Figure  1.4, step 2). Evidence includes all knowledge 
sources, including IK and LK where available. Very high and high 
conﬁdence ﬁndings are those that are supported by multiple lines 
of robust evidence with high agreement. Low or very low conﬁdence 
describe ﬁndings for which there is limited evidence and/or low 
agreement among different lines of evidence, and are only presented 
in SROCC if they address a major topic of concern.

Quantitative expressions (likelihood scale) are used when sufﬁcient 
data and conﬁdence exists for ﬁndings to be assigned a quantitative 
or probabilistic estimate (Figure 1.4, step 3). In the scientiﬁc literature, 
a ﬁnding is often said to be signiﬁcant if it has a likelihood exceeding 
95% conﬁdence. Using calibrated IPCC language, this level of 
statistical conﬁdence would be termed extremely likely. Lower levels 
of likelihood than those derived numerically can be assigned by 
expert judgement to take into account structural or measurement 
uncertainties within the products or data used to determine the 
probabilistic estimates (e.g.,  Table CB1.1). Likelihood statements 
may be used to describe how climate changes relate to the ends of 
distribution functions, such as in detection and attribution studies 
that assess the likelihood that an observed climate change or event is 
different to a reference climate state (Section 1.3). In other situations, 
likelihood statements refer to the central region across a distribution 
of possibilities. Examples are the estimates of future changes based 
on large ensembles of climate model simulations, where the central 
66% of estimates across the ensemble (i.e.,  the 17–83% range) 
would be termed a likely range (Figure 1.4, step 3). 
It is increasingly recognised that effective risk management requires 
assessments not just of ‘what is most likely’ but also of ‘how bad 
things could get’ (Mach et al., 2017; Weaver et al., 2017; Xu and 
Ramanathan, 2017; Spratt and Dunlop, 2018; Sutton, 2018). In 
response to the need to reframe policy relevant assessments according 
to risk (Section 1.5; Mach et al., 2016; Weaver et al., 2017; Sutton, 
2018), an effort is made in SROCC to report on potential changes 
for which there is low scientiﬁc conﬁdence or a low likelihood of 
occurrence, but that would have large impacts if realised (Mach 
et al., 2017). In some cases where evidence is limited or emerging, 
phenomena may instead be discussed according to physically 
plausible scenarios of impact (e.g., Table 6.1). 
In some cases, deep uncertainty (Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 1) 
may exist in current scientiﬁc assessments of the processes, rate, 
timing, magnitude, and consequences of future ocean and cryosphere 
changes. This includes physically plausible high-impact changes, 
such as high-end sea level rise scenarios that would be costly if 
realised without effective adaptation planning and even then may 
exceed limits to adaptation. Means such as expert judgement, 
scenario building, and invoking multiple lines of evidence enable 
comprehensive risk assessments even in cases of uncertain future 
ocean and cryosphere changes.

Deﬁnition and Context
Characterising, assessing and managing risks to climate change involves dealing with inherent uncertainties. Uncertainties can lead to 
complex decision-making situations for managers and policymakers tasked with risk management, particularly where decisions relate 
to possibilities assessed as having low or unknown conﬁdence/likelihood, yet would have high impacts if realised. While uncertainty 
can be quantitatively or qualitatively assessed (Section 1.9.2; Figure 1.4), a situation of deep uncertainty exists when experts or 
stakeholders do not know or cannot agree on: (1) appropriate conceptual models that describe relationships among key driving forces 
in a system; (2) the probability distributions used to represent uncertainty about key variables and parameters; and/or, (3) how to 
weigh and value desirable alternative outcomes (adapted from Lempert et al., 2003; Marchau et al., 2019b).
The concept of deep uncertainty has been debated and addressed in the literature for some time, with diverse terminology used. 
Terms such as great uncertainty (Hansson and Hirsch Hadorn, 2017), contested uncertain knowledge (Douglas and Wildavsky, 1983), 
ambiguity (Ellsberg, 1961) and Knightian uncertainty (Knight, 1921) among others, are also present in the literature to refer to the 
multiple components of uncertainty that need to be accounted for in decision making. The purpose of this Cross-Chapter Box is to 
constructively engage with the concept of deep uncertainty, by ﬁrst providing some context for how the IPCC has dealt with deep 
uncertainty in the past. This is followed by examples of cases from the ocean and cryosphere assessments in the Special Report on the 
Oceans and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC), where deep uncertainty has been addressed to advance assessment of risks 
and their management.
How has the IPCC and other literature dealt with deep uncertainty?
The IPCC assessment process provides instances of how deep uncertainty can manifest. In assessing the scientiﬁc evidence for 
anthropogenic climate change, and its inﬂuence on the Earth system in the past and future, IPCC assessments can identify areas where 
a large range of possibilities exist in the scientiﬁc literature or where knowledge of the underlying processes and responses is lacking. 
Existing guidelines to ensure consistent treatment of uncertainties by IPCC author teams (Mastrandrea et al., 2010; Section 1.9.2) may 
not be sufﬁcient to ensure the desired consistency or guide robust ﬁndings when conditions of deep uncertainty are present (Adler 
and Hirsch Hadorn, 2014).

Cross-Chapter Box 5 (continued)
The IPCC, and earlier assessments, encountered deep uncertainty when evaluating numerous aspects of the climate change 
problem. Examining these cases sheds light on approaches to quantifying and reducing deep uncertainty. An assessment by the 
US National Academy of Sciences (Charney et al., 1979; commonly referred to as the Charney Report) provides a classic example. 
Evaluating climate sensitivity to a doubling of carbon dioxide concentration, and developing a probability distribution for it, was 
challenging because only two 3-D climate models and a handful of model variants and realisations were available. The panel invoked 
three strategies to eliminate some of these simulations: (1) Using multiple lines of evidence to complement the limited model 
results; (2) estimating the consequences of poor or absent model representations of certain physical processes (particularly cumulus 
convection, high-altitude cloud formation, and non-cloud entrainment); and, (3) evaluating mismatches between model results and 
observations. This triage yielded ‘probable bounds’ of 2oC–3.5oC on climate sensitivity. The panel then invoked expert judgment 
(Box 12.2 in Collins et al., 2013) to broaden the range to 3 ± 1.5oC, with 3oC referred to as the ‘most probable value’. The panel did 
not report its conﬁdence in these judgments.
The literature has expanded greatly since, allowing successive IPCC assessments to reﬁne the approach taken in the Charney report. By 
the IPCC 5th Assessment Report (AR5), four lines of evidence (from instrumental records, palaeoclimate data, model intercomparison 
of sensitivity, and model-climatology comparisons) were assessed to determine that ‘Equilibrium climate sensitivity is likely in the 
range 1.5ºC–4.5ºC (high conﬁdence), extremely unlikely less than 1ºC (high conﬁdence), and very unlikely greater than 6ºC (medium 
conﬁdence)’ (Box 12.2 in Collins et al., 2013). The Charney report began the process of convergence of opinion around a single 
probability range (essentially, category (2) in the deﬁnition of deep uncertainty, above), at least for sensitivity arising from fast 
feedbacks captured by global climate models (Hansen et al., 2007). Subsequent assessments increased conﬁdence, eliminating deep 
uncertainty about this part of the sensitivity problem over a wide range of probability.
Cases of Deep Uncertainty from SROCC
Case A: Permafrost carbon and greenhouse gas emissions. AR5 reported the estimated size of the organic carbon pool stored frozen in 
permafrost zone soils, but uncertainty estimates were not available (Tarnocai et al., 2009; Ciais et al., 2013). AR5 further reported that 
future greenhouse gas emissions (CO2 only) from permafrost were the most uncertain biogeochemical feedback on climate of the ten 
factors quantiﬁed (Figure 6.20 in Ciais et al., 2013). However, the low conﬁdence assigned to permafrost was not due to few studies, 
but rather to divergence on the conceptual framework relating changes in permafrost carbon and future greenhouse gas emissions, as 
well as the probability distribution of key variables. Most large-scale carbon climate models still lack key landscape-level mechanisms 
that are known to abruptly thaw permafrost and expose organic carbon to decomposition, and many do not include mechanisms 
needed to differentiate the release of methane versus carbon dioxide with their very different global warming potentials. Studies since 
AR5 on potential methane release from laboratory soil incubations (Schädel et al., 2016; Knoblauch et al., 2018), actual methane 
release from the Siberian shallow Arctic ocean shelves (Shakhova et al., 2013; Thornton et al., 2016), changes in permafrost carbon 
stocks from the Last Glacial Maximum until present (Ciais et al., 2011; Lindgren et al., 2018) and potential carbon uptake by future 
plant growth (Qian et al., 2010; McGuire et al., 2018) have widened rather than narrowed the uncertainty range (Section 3.4.3.1.1). 
Accounting for greenhouse gas release from polar and high mountain (Box 2.2) permafrost, introduces an element of deep uncertainty 
when determining emissions pathways consistent with Article 2 of the Paris Agreement (Comyn-Platt et al., 2018). With stakeholder 
needs in mind, scientists have been actively engaged in narrowing this uncertainty by using multiple lines of evidence, expert judgment, 
and joint evaluation of observations and models. As a result, SROCC has reduced uncertainty and introduced conﬁdence assessments 
across some but not all components of this problem (Section 3.4.3.1.1.).
Case B: Antarctic ice sheet and sea level rise. Dynamical ice loss from Antarctica (Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3) provides an example 
of lack of knowledge about processes, and disagreement about appropriate models and probability distributions for representing 
uncertainty (categories (1) and (2) in the deﬁnition of deep uncertainty). AR5 used a statistical model and expert judgment to reduce 
uncertainty compared to AR4 (Church et al., 2013). Based on modelling of marine ice sheet processes after AR5, SROCC has further 
reduced uncertainty in the Antarctic contribution to sea level rise. The likely range including the potential contribution of marine ice 
sheet instability is quantiﬁed as 0.02–0.23 m for 2081–2100 (and 0.03–0.28 m for 2100) compared to 1986–2005 under RCP8.5 
(medium conﬁdence). However, the magnitude of additional rise beyond 2100, and the probability of greater sea level rise than that 
included in the likely range before 2100, are characterised by deep uncertainty (Section 4.2.3).

Cross-Chapter Box 5 (continued)
Policy makers at various levels of governance are considering adaptation investments (e.g., hard infrastructure, retreat, and nature-based 
defences) for multi-decadal time horizons that consider projection uncertainty (Sections 4.4.2, 4.4.3). For example, extreme sea levels 
(e.g., the local ‘hundred-year ﬂood’) now occurring during storms that are historically rare are projected to become annual events by 
2100 or sooner at many low-lying coastal locations (Section 4.4.3). Sea level rise exceeding the likely range, or an alternate pathway 
to the assumed climate change scenario (e.g., which RCP is used in risk estimation), could alter these projections and both factors 
are characterised by deep uncertainty. Among the strategies used to reduce deep uncertainty in these cases are formal and informal 
elicitation of expert judgment to project ice sheet behaviour (Horton et al., 2014; Bamber et al., 2019), and development of plausible 
sea level rise scenarios, including extreme cases (Sections 4.2.3, 4.4.5.3). Frameworks for risk management under deep uncertainty in 
the context of time lags between commitment to ice sheet losses and emissions mitigation, and between coastal adaptation planning 
and implementation, are currently emerging in the literature (Section 4.4.5.3.4).
Case C: Compound risks and cascading impacts. Compound risks and cascading impacts (Section 6.1, 6.8, Figure 1.1, Figure 6.1) 
arise from multiple coincident or sequential hazards (Zscheischler et al., 2018). Compound risks are an example of deep uncertainty 
because their rarity means that there is often a lack of data or modelling to characterise the risks statistically under present conditions 
or future changes (Gallina et al., 2016), and there is the potential that climate elements could cross tipping points (e.g., Cai et al., 
2016). Nevertheless, effective risk reduction strategies can be developed without knowing the statistical likelihoods of such events 
by acknowledging the possibility that an event can occur (Dessai et al., 2009). Such strategies are typically well hedged against a 
variety of different futures and adjustable through time in response to emerging information (Lempert et al., 2010). Case studies are 
useful for raising awareness of the possibility of compound events and provide valuable learnings for decision makers in the form of 
analogues (McLeman and Hunter, 2010). They can provide a basis for devising scenarios to stress test systems in other regions for 
the purposes of understanding and reducing risk. The case study describing the ocean, climate and weather events in the Australian 
state of Tasmania in 2015/2016 (Box 6.1) provides such an example. It led to compound risks that could not have been estimated 
due to deep uncertainty. The total cost of the co-occurring ﬁres, ﬂoods and marine heat wave to the state government was estimated 
at about 300 million USD, and impacts on the food, energy and manufacturing sectors reduced Tasmania’s anticipated economic 
growth by approximately half (Eslake, 2016). In the aftermath of this event, the government increased funding to relevant agencies 
responsible for ﬂood and bushﬁre management and independent reviews have recommended major policy reforms that are now 
under consideration (Blake et al., 2017; Tasmanian Climate Change Ofﬁce, 2017).
What can we learn from SROCC cases in addressing deep uncertainty?
Using the adapted deﬁnition as a framing concept for deep uncertainty (see also Annex 1: Glossary), we ﬁnd that each of the three 
cases described in this Cross-Chapter Box involve at least one of the three ways that deep uncertainty can manifest. In Case A, 
incomplete knowledge on relationships and key drivers and feedbacks (category 1), coupled with broadened probability distributions 
in post-AR5 literature (category 2), are key reasons for deep uncertainty. In Case B, the inability to characterise the probability of 
marine ice sheet instability due to a lack of adequate models resulting in divergent views on the probability of ice loss lead to 
deep uncertainty (categories 1 and 2). In Case C, the Australian example provides insights on the inadequacy of models or previous 
experience for estimating risk of multiple simultaneous extreme events, contributing to the exhaustion of resources which were then 
insufﬁcient to meet the need for emergency response. This case also points to the complex task of addressing multiple simultaneous 
extreme events, and the multiple ways of valuing preferred outcomes in reducing future losses (category 3). 
The three cases validate the continued iterative process required to meaningfully engage with deep uncertainty in situations of risk, 
through means such as elicitation, deliberation and application of expert judgement, scenario building and invoking multiple lines 
of evidence. These approaches demonstrate feasible ways to address or even reduce deep uncertainty in complex decision situations 
(see also Marchau et al., 2019a), considering that possible obstacles and time investment needed to address deep uncertainty, should 
not be underestimated.

Integrated Storyline 
of this Special Report
The chapters that follow in this special report are framed around 
geographies or climatic processes where the ocean and/or 
cryosphere are particularly important for ecosystems and people. The 
chapter order follows the movement of water from Earth’s shrinking 
mountain and polar cryosphere into our rising and warming ocean. 
Chapter  2 assesses High Mountain areas outside of the polar 
regions, where glaciers, snow and/or permafrost are common. 
Chapter 3 moves to the Polar Regions of the northern and southern 
high latitudes, which are characterised by vast stores of frozen water 
in ice sheets, glaciers, ice shelves, sea ice and permafrost, and by 
the interaction of these cryosphere elements and the polar oceans. 
Chapter 4 examines Sea Level Rise and the hazards this brings to 
Low-Lying Regions, Coasts and Communities. Chapter  5 focuses 
on the Changing Ocean, with a particular focus on how climate 
change impacts on the ocean are altering Marine Ecosystems 
and affecting Dependent Communities. Chapter 6 is dedicated to 
assessing Extremes and Abrupt Events, and reﬂects the potential 
for rapid and possibly irreversible changes in Earth’s ocean and 
cryosphere, and the challenges this brings to Managing Risk. The 
multitude ways in which Low-Lying Islands and Coasts are exposed 
and vulnerable to the impacts of ocean and cryosphere change, 
along with resilience and adaptation strategies, opportunities and 
governance options speciﬁc to these settings, is highlighted in 
integrative Cross-Chapter Box 9. 
This report does not attempt to assess all aspects of the ocean and 
cryosphere in a changing climate. Examples of research themes that 
will be covered elsewhere in the IPCC Sixth Assessment Cycle and 
not SROCC include: assessments of ocean and cryosphere changes in 
the CMIP6 experiments (AR6), cryosphere changes outside of polar 
and high mountain regions (e.g., snow cover in temperate and low 
altitude settings; AR6), and a thorough assessment of mitigation 
options for reducing climate change impacts (SR15, AR6 WGIII). 
Each chapter of SROCC presents an integrated storyline on the ocean 
and/or cryosphere in a changing climate. The chapter assessments 
each present evidence of the pervasive changes that are already 
underway in the ocean and cryosphere (Figure 1.5). The impacts that 
physical changes in the ocean and cryosphere have had on ecosystems 
and people are assessed, along with lessons learned from adaptation 
measures that have already been employed to avoid adverse impacts. 
The assessments of future change in the ocean and cryosphere 
demonstrate the growing and accelerating changes projected for the 
future and identify the reduced impacts and risks that choices for  
a low greenhouse gas emission future would have compared with a 
high emission future (Figure 1.5). Potential adaptation strategies to 
reduce future risks to ecosystems and people are assessed, including 
identifying where limits to adaptation may be exceeded. The local- to 
global-scale responses for charting CRDPs are also assessed.

Frequently Asked Questions
FAQ 1.1 | 
How do changes in the ocean and cryosphere affect our life on planet Earth? 
The ocean and cryosphere regulate the climate and weather on Earth, provide food and water, support economies, trade and 
transportation, shape cultures and inﬂuence our well-being. Many of the recent changes in Earth’s ocean and cryosphere are 
the result of human activities and have consequences on everyone’s life. Deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions will reduce 
negative impacts on billions of people and help them adapt to changes in their environment. Improving education and 
combining scientiﬁc knowledge with Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge helps communities to further address the 
challenges ahead.
The ocean and cryosphere – a collective name for the frozen parts of the Earth – are essential to the climate and 
life giving processes on our planet. 
Changes in the ocean and cryosphere occur naturally, but the speed, magnitude, and pervasiveness of the 
global changes happening right now have not been observed for millennia or longer. Evidence shows that  
the majority of ocean and cryosphere changes observed in the past few decades are the result of human 
inﬂuences on Earth’s climate. 
Every one of us beneﬁts from the role of the ocean and cryosphere in regulating climate and weather. The ocean 
has absorbed about a third of the carbon dioxide humans have emitted from the burning of fossil fuels since the 
Industrial Revolution, and the majority (more than 90%) of the extra heat within the Earth system. In this way, 
the ocean has slowed the warming humans and ecosystems have experienced on land. The reﬂective surface of 
snow and ice reduce the amount of the sun’s energy that is absorbed on Earth. This effect diminishes as snow and 
ice melts, contributing to ampliﬁed temperature rise across the Arctic. The ocean and cryosphere also sustain life 
giving water resources, by rain and snow that come from the ocean, and by melt water from snow and glaciers 
in mountain and polar regions.
Nearly two billion people live near the coast, and around 800 million on land less than 10 m above sea level. 
The ocean directly supports the food, economies, cultures and well-being of coastal populations (see FAQ 1.2). 
The livelihoods of many more are tied closely to the ocean through food, trade, and transportation. Fish and 
shellﬁsh contribute about 17% of the non-grain protein in human diets and shipping transports at least 80% of 
international imports and exports. But the ocean also brings hazards to coastal populations and infrastructure, 
and particularly to low-lying coasts. These populations are increasingly exposed to tropical cyclones, marine heat 
waves, sea level rise, coastal ﬂooding and saltwater incursion into groundwater resources.
In high mountains and the Arctic, around 700 million people live in close contact with the cryosphere. These 
people, including many Indigenous Peoples, depend on snow, glaciers and sea ice for their livelihoods, food 
and water security, travel and transport, and cultures (see FAQ 1.2). They are also exposed to hazards as the 
cryosphere changes, including ﬂood outbursts, landslides and coastal erosion. Changes in the polar and high 
mountain regions also have far-reaching consequences for people in other parts of the world (see FAQ 3.1).
Warming of the climate system leads to sea level rise. Melt from glaciers and ice sheets is adding to the amount 
of water in the ocean, and the heat being absorbed by the ocean is causing it to expand and take up more 
space. Today’s sea level is already about 20 cm higher than in 1900. Sea level will continue to rise for centuries 
to millennia because the ocean system reacts slowly. Even if global warming were to be halted, it would take 
centuries or more to halt ice sheet melt and ocean warming.
Enhanced warming in the Arctic and in high mountains is causing rapid surface melt of glaciers and the 
Greenland ice sheet. Thawing of permafrost is destabilising soils, human infrastructure, and Arctic coasts, and 
has the potential to release vast quantities of methane and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere that will further 
exacerbate climate change. Widespread loss of sea ice in the Arctic is opening up new routes for shipping, but 
at the same time is reducing habitats for key species and affecting the livelihoods of Indigenous cultures. In 
Antarctica, glacier and ice sheet loss is occurring particularly quickly in places where ice is in direct contact with 
warm ocean water, further contributing to sea level rise. 
Ocean ecosystems are threatened globally by three major climate change-induced stressors: warming, loss 
of oxygen and acidiﬁcation. Marine heat waves are occurring everywhere across the surface ocean, and are 
becoming more frequent and more intense as the ocean warms. These are causing disease and mass-mortality

that put, for example, coral reefs and ﬁsh populations at risk. Marine heat waves last much longer than the heat 
waves experienced on land, and are particularly harmful for organisms that cannot move away from areas of 
warm water. 
Warming of the ocean reduces not only the amount of oxygen it can hold, but also tend to stratify it. As a result, 
less oxygen is transported to depth, where it is needed to support ocean life. Dissolved carbon dioxide that has 
been taken up by the ocean reacts with water molecules to increase the acidity of seawater. This makes the 
water more corrosive for marine organisms that build their shells and structures out of mineral carbonates, such 
as corals, shellﬁsh and plankton. These climate-change stressors occur alongside other human-driven impacts, 
such as overﬁshing, excessive nutrient loads (eutrophication), and plastic pollution. If human impacts on the 
ocean continue unabated, declines in ocean health and services are projected to cost the global economy 
428 billion USD yr–1 by 2050, and 1.979 trillion USD yr–1 by 2100. 
The speed and intensity of the future risks and impacts from ocean and cryosphere change depend critically on 
future greenhouse gas emissions. The more these emissions can be curbed, the more the changes in the ocean 
and cryosphere can be slowed and limited, reducing future risks and impacts. But humankind is also exposed to  
the effects of changes triggered by past emissions, including sea level rise that will continue for centuries to come. 
Improving education and using scientiﬁc knowledge alongside local knowledge and Indigenous knowledge can  
support the development of context-speciﬁc options that help communities to adapt to inevitable changes and 
respond to challenges ahead.

FAQ 1.2 | 
 How will changes in the ocean and cryosphere affect meeting the Sustainable 
Development Goals? 
Ocean and cryosphere change affect our ability to meet the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Progress 
on the SDGs support climate action that will reduce future ocean and cryosphere change, and as well as the adaptation 
responses to unavoidable changes. There are also trade-offs between SDGs and measures that help communities to adjust 
to their changing environment, but limiting greenhouse gas emissions opens more options for effective adaptation and 
sustainable development.
The SDGs were adopted by the United Nations in 2015 to support action for people, planet and prosperity (FAQ 
1.2, Figure 1). The 17 goals and their 169 targets strive to end poverty and hunger, protect the planet and reduce 
gender, social and economic inequities by 2030.
SDG 13 (Climate Action) explicitly recognises that changing climatic conditions are a global concern. Climate 
change is already causing pervasive changes in Earth’s ocean and cryosphere (FAQ 1.1). These changes are 
impacting food, water and health securities, with consequences for achieving SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 3 (Good 
Health and Well-Being), SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), and SDG 1 (No Poverty). Climate change impacts on 
Earth’s ocean and cryosphere also affect the environmental goals for SDG 14 (Life below Water) and SDG 15 (Life 
on Land), with additional implications for many of the other SDGs.
SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) will be affected by ocean and cryosphere changes. Melting mountain glaciers 
bring an initial increase in water, but as glaciers continue to shrink so too will the essential water they provide 
to millions of mountain dwellers, downstream communities, and cities. These populations also depend on water 
ﬂow from the high mountains for drinking, sanitation, and irrigation, and for SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy). 
Water security is also threatened by changes in the magnitude and seasonality of rainfall, driven by rising ocean 
temperatures, which increases the risk of severe storms and ﬂooding in some regions, or the risk of more severe 
or more frequent droughts in other regions. Among other effects, ongoing sea level rise is allowing salt water to 
intrude further inland, contaminating drinking water and irrigation sources for some coastal populations. Actions 
to address these threats will likely require new infrastructure to manage rain, melt water, and river ﬂow, in order 
to make water supplies more reliable. These actions would also beneﬁt SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) by 
reducing the risk of ﬂooding and negative health outcomes posed by extreme rainfall and outbursts of glacial melt.
Climate change impacts on the ocean and cryosphere also have many implications for progress on food security 
that is addressed in SDG 2 (Zero Hunger). Changes in rainfall patterns caused by ocean warming will increase 
aridity in some areas and bring more (or more intense) rainfall to others. In mountain regions, these changes 
bring varying challenges for maintaining reliable crops and livestock production. Some adaptation opportunities 
might be found in developing strains of crops and livestock better adapted to the future climate conditions, but 
this response option is also challenged by the rapid rate of climate change. In the Arctic, very rapidly warming 
temperatures, diminishing sea ice, reduced snow cover and degradation of permafrost are restricting the habitats 
and migration patterns of important food sources (SDG 2 Zero Hunger), including reindeer and several marine 
mammals (SDG 15 Life on Land; SDG 14 Life below Water), resulting in reduced hunting opportunities for staple 
foods that many northern Indigenous communities depend upon.
Rising temperatures, and changes in ocean nutrients, acidity and salinity are altering SDG 14 (Life Below Water). 
The productivity and distributions of some ﬁsh species are changing in ways that alter availability of ﬁsh to 
long-established ﬁsheries, whereas the range of ﬁsh populations may move to become available in some new 
coastal and open ocean areas. 
Ocean changes are of concern for small island developing states and coastal cities and communities. Beyond possible 
reductions in marine food supply and related risks for SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), their lives, livelihoods and well-being 
are also threatened in ways that are linked to several SDGs, including SDG 3 (Good Health  and Wellbeing), SDG 
8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), and SDG 11 (Sustainable 
Cities and Communities). For example, sea level rise and warming oceans can cause inundation of coastal homes 
and infrastructure, more powerful tropical storms, declines in established economies such as tourism and losses 
of cultural heritage and identity. Improved community and coastal infrastructure can help to adapt to these 
changes, and more effective and faster disaster responses from health sectors and other emergency services can 
assist the populations who experience these impacts. In some situations, the most appropriate responses may 
involve relocation of critical services and, in some cases, communities; and for some populations, migration away 
from their homeland may become the only viable response.

Without transformative adaptation and mitigation, climate change could undermine progress towards achieving 
the 2030 SDGs, and make it more difﬁcult to implement CRDPs in the longer term. Reducing global warming 
(mitigation) provides the best possibility to limit the speed and extent of ocean and cryosphere change and give 
more options for effective adaptation and sustainable development. Progress on SDG 4 (Quality Education), 
SDG 5 (Gender Equality) and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities) can moderate the vulnerabilities that shape people’s 
risk to ocean and cryosphere change, while SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), SDG 16 (Peace, 
Justice and Institutions) and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) will help to facilitate the scales of adaptation 
and mitigation responses required to achieve sustainable development. Investment in social and physical 
infrastructure that supports adaptation to inevitable ocean and cryosphere changes will enable people to 
participate in initiatives to achieve the SDGs. Current and past IPCC efforts have focused on identifying CRDPs. 
Such adaptation and mitigation strategies, supported by adequate investments, and understanding the potential 
for SDG initiatives to increase the exposure or vulnerability of the activities to climate change hazards, could also 
constitute pathways for progress on the SDGs.
