Users are expected to go to Mapping Tables in Annex 1 Volume 4 (AFOLU), before reading this chapter. This is 
required to correctly understand both the refinements made and how the elements in this chapter relate to the 
corresponding chapter in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. 
10.1 
INTRODUCTION 
This chapter provides guidance on methods to estimate emissions of methane from Enteric Fermentation in 
livestock, and methane and nitrous oxide emissions from Manure Management. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions 
from livestock are not estimated because annual net CO2 emissions are assumed to be zero ‚Äì the CO2 
photosynthesized by plants is returned to the atmosphere as respired CO2.  A portion of the C is returned as methane 
(CH4) and for this reason CH4 requires separate consideration. 
Livestock production can result in CH4 emissions from enteric fermentation and both CH4 and nitrous oxide (N2O) 
emissions from livestock manure management systems.  Cattle are an important source of CH4 in many countries 
because of their large population and high CH4 emission rate due to their ruminant digestive system.  Methane 
emissions from manure management tend to be smaller than enteric emissions, with the most substantial emissions 
associated with confined animal management operations where manure is handled in liquid-based systems. Nitrous 
oxide emissions from manure management vary significantly between the types of management system used and 
can also result in indirect emissions due to other forms of nitrogen loss from the system.  The calculation of the 
nitrogen loss from manure management systems is also an important step in determining the amount of nitrogen 
that will ultimately be available in manure applied to managed soils, or used for feed, fuel, or construction purposes 
‚Äì emissions that are calculated in Chapter 11, Section 11.2 (N2O emissions from managed soils). 
The methods for estimating CH4 and N2O emissions from livestock require definitions of livestock subcategories, 
annual populations and, for higher Tier methods, feed intake and characterisation. The procedures employed to 
define livestock subcategories, develop population data, and characterize feed are described in Section 10.2 
(Livestock Population and Feed Characterisation). Suggested feed digestibility coefficients for various livestock 
categories have been provided to help estimation of feed intake for use in calculation of emissions from enteric 
and manure sources. A coordinated livestock characterisation as described in Section 10.2 should be used to ensure 
consistency across the following source categories: 
Section 10.3 - CH4 emissions from Enteric Fermentation; 
Section 10.4 - CH4 emissions from Manure Management; 
Section 10.5 - N2O emissions from Manure Management (direct and indirect); 
Chapter 11, Section 11.2 - N2O emissions from Managed Soils (direct and indirect).  
In calculating agricultural emissions, it is important to establish consistency among the different emission sources. 
Key drivers of emissions such as animal weight and productivity must be treated using the same parameters for 
emissions of enteric and manure management CH4, as well as N2O from manure management. Further, Section 
10.5.4 discusses the coordination between N2O emissions from Manure Management and Managed Soils. 
Emissions of N2O from nitrogen excretion should be assessed following a nitrogen mass flow approach which is 
further explained in Section 10.5.6 and illustrated in Figure 10.5.

TIER 1: BASIC CHARACTERISATION FOR LIVESTOCK POPULATIONS 
Basic characterisation for Tier 1 is likely to be sufficient for most animal species in most countries. For this 
approach it is good practice to collect the following livestock characterisation data to support the emissions 
estimates: 
Livestock species : A complete list of all livestock populations by species that have default emission factor values 
must be developed (e.g., dairy cows, other cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, camels, llamas, alpacas, deer, horses, 
rabbits, mules and asses, swine, and poultry) if these species are relevant to the country. Populations by species 
can also be further subdivided by category. Category refers to classification inside a species by different relevant 
attributes as sex, age or productive purpose in a relevant production system in any given country (e.g. in the case 
of cattle: mature males and females, replacement heifers, calves, etc.). More detailed categories should be used if 
the data are available. For example, more accurate emission estimates can be made if poultry populations are 
further subdivided (e.g., layers, broilers, turkeys, ducks, and other poultry), as the waste characteristics among 
these different populations vary significantly.  
Annual population: If possible, inventory compilers should use population data from official national statistics 
or industry sources. Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) data, FAOSTAT and other FAO statistics, can be 
used if national data are unavailable. Seasonal births or slaughters may cause the population size to expand or 
contract at different times of the year which will require the population numbers to be adjusted accordingly. It is 
important to fully document the method used to estimate the annual population, including any adjustments to the 
original form of the population data as it was received from national statistical agencies or from other sources. 
When population by species is subdivided by categories it is important to fully document any adjustments done in 
the population to match the categories used in the inventory compilation.   
Compilers could consider to communicate/share the annual population data needs with the national statistical 
agency and/or the other sources from which the data was obtained, so this sources are better aware of the needs of 
inventory compilers. In addition, national statistical agencies and agencies responsible for inventory compilation 
can work closely together to ensure that official statistics better meet the needs of the inventory compilers. 
Annual average populations are referred to as the number of head of livestock species per category within a given 
country (N(T)). This can be estimated in various ways, depending on the available data and the nature of the animal 
population.  In the case of static animal populations (e.g. dairy cows, breeding swine, layers), estimating the 
number of head of a given livestock species in the country (N(T)) may be as simple as obtaining data related to one-
time animal inventory data. However, estimating N(T) for a growing population (e.g., meat animals, such as 
broilers, turkeys, beef cattle, and market swine) requires more evaluation. Most animals in these growing 
populations are alive for only part of a complete year.  Animals should be included in the populations regardless 
if they were slaughtered for human consumption or die of natural causes. Equation 10.1 estimates N(T).

Broiler chickens are typically grown approximately 60 days before slaughter.  Estimating N(T) as the number of 
grown and slaughtered over the course of a year would greatly overestimate the population, as it would assume 
each lived the equivalent of 365 days. Instead, one should estimate the average annual population as the number 
of animals grown divided by the number of growing cycles per year.  For example, if broiler chickens are typically 
grown in flocks for 60 days, an operation could turn over approximately 6 flocks of chickens over the period of 
one year.  Therefore, if the operation grew 60,000 chickens in a year, their average annual population would be 
9,863 chickens. For this example the equation would be: 
Annual average population = 60 days * 60,000 / 365 days / yr = 9,863 chickens

Consideration of differing Productivity systems (Tier 1a) 
In certain countries agricultural production systems may be transitioning from low productivity local subsistence 
systems to higher productivity systems aimed at fulfilling national and export markets or may simply have dual 
agricultural systems, with coexistence of low and high productivity systems clearly identified. In these cases 
inventory compilers may wish to use the Tier 1a approach in which they are able to better track the transitions and 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
10.14 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
changes in the productivity of their agricultural systems and related emissions over time. Tier 1a emission factors 
(on a per head basis) have been developed for use with basic population estimates separated by low and high 
productivity systems according to the definitions below. 
In this case animal populations by species may be divided by productivity systems. For each animal species  high 
and low productivity systems may be defined according to characteristics such as: feedbase, genetics, purpose 
(draft, cultural reasons, self-consumption, market), production objectives (e.g. milk, meat, eggs), and level of 
inputs and outputs. 
Definitions of High and Low Productivity Systems 
Dairy Cattle and milk production: 
The dairy cow population is estimated separately from other cattle (see Table 10.1). Dairy cows are defined in this 
method as mature cows (first lactation and beyond) that are producing milk in commercial quantities for 
consumption. This definition corresponds to the dairy cow population reported in FAO, IDF, IFCN (2014). Dairy 
cow population should not be confused with multi-purpose cows that may be used for more than one production 
purpose milk, meat or draft. 
In some countries the dairy cow population is comprised of two well-defined segments: 
High-productivity systems are based on high-yielding dairy cows that are concentrated in confinement 
production systems or grazing on high quality pastures with supplements. The farms are 100 percent market 
oriented for commercial milk production, for national markets and/or export; Purebred or crossbred cattle are 
genetically improved through selective breeding for milk production (FAO, IDF, IFCN 2014). Indicative levels of 
high milk productivity by cow corresponding to a given region are included in Table 10.11 to guide the selection 
of the emission factors. 
Low productivity systems are based on low-yielding dairy cows, grazing non-improved pastures, and using 
locally produced roughage (e.g. crop residues), and agro-industrial by-products. Local breeds or crossbred cows 
are bred locally, without intensive selection for milk productivity. Milk production is mostly for local market and 
local consumption (FAO, IDF, IFCN. 2014). Indicative levels of low milk productivity by cow corresponding to 
a given region are included in Table 10.11 to guide the selection of the emission factors. 
Dairy buffalo may be categorized in a similar manner to dairy cows. 
Other cattle: 
High-productivity systems are based on animal feeding systems using forage (e.g. high-quality grass) and 
concentrates in confinement production systems or grazing with supplements or on improved pastures, producing 
high rates of daily weight gain. Animals can be purebred or crossbred and are genetically improved through 
selective breeding for improved commercial meat production. Growing cattle may be finished young in "intensive 
grazing with supplements" or feedlot systems, and meat is produced for national markets and/or export (FAO, 
IDF, IFCN 2014). 
Low productivity systems are based on animal feeding systems where locally produced roughage (e.g. crop 
residues) or low quality rangelands represent the major source of feed utilized, producing low rates of daily weight 
gain. Animals can be represented by local breeds or may be crossbred and can also be used for multiple purposes 
such as draft, meat and milk for self consumption and markets (FAO, IDF, IFCN 2014). 
Other livestock species: 
High-productivity systems, which are 100 percent market oriented with high level of capital input requirements 
and high level of overall herd (flock) performance. Feed is purchased from local or international market or 
intensively produced on farm. Animals are improved through breeding practices for commercial production. The 
high-productivity systems are common in swine, poultry, goats and sheep production (MacLeod et al. 2017). 
Low productivity systems which are mainly driven by local market or by self-consumption, with low capital 
input requirements and low level of overall herd (fowl) performance typically using large areas for production or 
backyards. Locally produced feed represents the major source of feed utilized or animals are kept-free range for 
major part or all of their production cycle, the yield of the activity being linked to the natural fertility of the land 
and the seasonal production of the pastures. The low-productivity systems are common in swine, poultry, goats 
and sheep production (MacLeod et al. 2017).

FAO provides international statistical information for livestock characterization, including population and 
production. Relevant sources are: FAOSTAT Production database and FAO World Census of Agriculture 2020.  
Additionally, FAO provides a free access e-learning course to support developing countries in the preparation of 
the national GHG inventory for the agriculture sector. FAO also provides tools that may be useful for inventory 
compilers in the agriculture sector as the FAOSTAT Emissions Analysis Tools, to identify data gaps and perform 
QA/QC analysis. Another tool is the Global Livestock Environmental Accounting Model (GLEAM), which is a 
GIS-based model for livestock production activities and related resource flows in all countries. The FAO-IPCC-
IFAD workshop report (IPCC, 2015), identifies the list of all FAOSTAT and other FAO data sources in support 
of National Inventory compilation in the AFOLU sector. 
TIER 
2: 
ENHANCED 
CHARACTERISATION 
FOR 
LIVESTOCK 
POPULATIONS 
The Tier 2 livestock characterisation requires detailed information on: 
‚Ä¢ Definitions for livestock subcategories;  
‚Ä¢ Livestock population by subcategory, with consideration for estimation of annual population as per Tier 1; and 
‚Ä¢ Feed intake estimates for the typical animal in each subcategory. 
The livestock population subcategories are defined to create relatively homogenous sub-groupings of animals. By 
dividing the population into these subcategories, country-specific variations in age structure and animal 
performance within the overall livestock population can be reflected. 
The Tier 2 characterisation methodology seeks to define animals, animal productivity, diet quality and 
management circumstances to support a more accurate estimate of feed intake for use in estimating methane 
production from enteric fermentation.  The same feed intake estimates should be used to provide harmonised 
estimates of manure and nitrogen excretion rates to improve the accuracy and consistency of CH4 and N2O 
emissions from manure management. 
Definitions for livestock subcategories 
It is good practice to classify livestock populations into subcategories for each species according to age, type of 
production, and sex. Representative livestock categories for doing this are shown in Table 10.1. Further 
subcategories are also possible:  
‚Ä¢ Cattle and buffalo populations should be classified into at least three main subcategories: mature dairy, other 
mature, and growing cattle. Depending on the level of detail in the emissions estimation method, subcategories 
can be further classified based on animal or feed characteristics.  For example, growing / fattening cattle could 
be further subdivided into those cattle that are fed with a high-grain diet and housed in dry lot vs. those cattle 
that are grown and finished solely on pasture. 
‚Ä¢ Subdivisions similar to those used for cattle and buffalo can be used to further segregate the sheep population 
in order to create subcategories with relatively homogenous characteristics.  For example, growing lambs could 
be further segregated into lambs finished on pasture vs. lambs finished in a feedlot. The same approach applies 
to national goat herds. 
‚Ä¢ Subcategories of swine could be further segregated based on production conditions.  For example, growing 
swine could be further subdivided into growing swine housed in intensive production facilities vs. swine that 
are grown under free-range conditions. 
‚Ä¢ Subcategories of poultry could be further segregated based on production conditions.  For example, poultry 
could be divided on the basis of production under confined or free-range conditions.

2 Emissions should only be considered for livestock species used to produce food, fodder or raw materials used for industrial processes. 
For large countries or for countries with distinct regional differences, it may be useful to designate regions and 
then define categories within those regions. Regional subdivisions may be used to represent differences in climate, 
feeding systems, diet, and manure management. However, this further segregation is only useful if correspondingly 
detailed data are available on feeding and manure management system usage by these livestock categories.  
The livestock classification that is chosen should be consistent for all emission sources, enteric and manure 
management methane and N2O from manure management. For each of the representative animal categories 
defined, the following information is required: 
‚Ä¢ Annual average population (number of livestock or poultry as per calculations for Tier 1); 
‚Ä¢ Average daily feed intake (megajoules (MJ) per day or kg per day); and 
‚Ä¢ Methane conversion factor (Ym) percentage of feed energy converted to methane; 
Generally, data on average daily feed intake are not available, particularly for grazing livestock.   Consequently, 
the following general data should be collected for estimating the feed intake for each representative animal 
category; 
‚Ä¢ Weight (kg); 
‚Ä¢ Average weight gain per day (kg)1;  
‚Ä¢ Feeding situation: confined, grazing, pasture conditions;  
‚Ä¢ Average milk production per day (kg/day), fat and protein content;  
‚Ä¢ Average amount of work performed per day (hours day-1); 
‚Ä¢ Percentage of females that give birth in a year2;   
‚Ä¢ Wool growth; 
‚Ä¢ Number of offspring;  
‚Ä¢ Digestibility of feed, expressed as the percentage of digestible energy in feed gross energy (DE, percent); 
‚Ä¢ Crude protein in diet (CP, percent);

‚Ä¢ Neutral Detergent Fibre (NDF, % DMI), proportion of feed composed of insoluble fibres, hemicellulose, 
cellulose, lignin and some protein fractions. 
Feed intake estimates 
Tier 2 emissions estimates require feed intakes for a representative animal in each subcategory. Feed intake is 
typically measured in terms of gross energy (e.g., mega joules (MJ) per day) or dry matter (e.g., kilograms (kg)) 
consumed per day.  Dry matter is the amount of feed consumed (kg) after it has been corrected for the water content 
in the complete diet.  For example, consumption of 10 kg of a diet that contains 70 percent dry matter would result 
in a dry matter intake of 7 kg.  To support the enteric fermentation Tier 2 method for cattle, buffalo, and sheep 
(see Section 10.3), detailed data requirements and equations to estimate feed intake are included in the guidance 
below. Constants in the equations have been combined to simplify overall equation formats. The remainder of this 
subsection presents the typical data requirements and equations used to estimate feed intake for cattle, buffalo, 
sheep and goats. Feed intake for other species can be estimated using similar country-specific methods appropriate 
for each. 
For all estimates of feed intake, good practice is to: 
‚Ä¢ Collect data to describe the animal‚Äôs typical diet and performance in each subcategory; 
‚Ä¢ Estimate feed intake required from the animal performance and diet data for each subcategory. 
In some cases, the equations may be applied on a seasonal basis, for example under conditions in which livestock 
gain weight in one season and lose weight in another.  This approach may require a more refined variation of Tier 
2 or more complex Tier 3 type methodology.  
The following animal performance data are required for each animal subcategory to estimate feed intake for the 
subcategory: 
Weight (W), kg: Live-weight data should be collected for each animal subcategory. It is unrealistic to perform a 
complete census of live-weights, so live-weight data should be obtained from representative sample studies or 
statistical databases if these already exist. Comparing live-weight data with slaughter-weight data is a useful cross-
check to assess whether the live-weight data are representative of country conditions. However, slaughter-weight 
data should not be used in place of live-weight data as it fails to account for the complete weight of the animal. 
Additionally, it should be noted that the relationship between live-weight and slaughter-weight varies with breed 
and body condition. For cattle, buffalo and mature sheep, the yearly average weight for each animal category (e.g., 
mature beef cows) is needed. For young animals, weights are needed at birth, weaning, one year of age or at 
slaughter if slaughter occurs within the year. Slaughter weights can be utilized in live weight estimations if 
slaughter ages, dressing percentages and growth curves are also available. 
Average weight gain per day (WG), kg day-1: Data on average weight gain are generally collected for feedlot 
animals and young growing animals. Mature animals are generally assumed to have no net weight gain or loss 
over an entire year. Mature animals frequently lose weight during the dry season or during temperature extremes 
and gain weight during the following season. However, increased emissions associated with this weight change 
are likely to be small.  Reduced intakes and emissions associated with weight loss are largely balanced by increased 
intakes and emissions during the periods of gain in body weight.   
Mature weight (MW), kg: The mature weight of the adult animal of the inventoried group is required to define a 
growth pattern, including the feed and energy required for growth.  For example, mature weight of a breed or 
category of cattle or buffalo is generally considered to be the body weight at which skeletal development is 
complete. The mature weight will vary among breeds and should reflect the animal‚Äôs weight when in moderate 
body condition. This is termed ‚Äòreference weight‚Äô (AAC 1990) or ‚Äòfinal shrunk body weight‚Äô (NRC 1996).  
Estimates of mature weight are typically available from livestock specialists and producers. Mature weights of 
bulls may be 1.5 times higher than cows in the same genotype (Doren et al. 1989).  
Average number of hours worked per day: For draft animals, the average number of hours worked per day must 
be determined. 
Feeding situation: The feeding situation that most accurately represents the animal subcategory must be 
determined using the definitions shown below (Table 10.5). If the feeding situation is intermediate to the 
definitions given, the feeding situation should be described in detail. This detailed information may be needed 
when calculating the enteric fermentation emissions, because interpolation between the feeding situations may be 
necessary to assign the most appropriate coefficient value. Table 10.5 defines the feeding situations for cattle, 
buffalo, sheep and goats. For poultry and swine, the feeding situation is assumed to be under confinement 
conditions and consequently the activity coefficient (Ca) is assumed to be zero as under these conditions very little 
energy is expended in acquiring feed.  Activity coefficients have not been developed for free-ranging swine or

poultry, but in most instances these livestock subcategories are likely to represent a small proportion of the national 
inventory. 
Mean winter temperature (¬∫C): Detailed feed intake models consider ambient temperature, wind speed, hair and 
tissue insulation and the heat of fermentation (NRC, 2001; AAC, 1990) and are likely more appropriate in Tier 3 
applications.  A more general relationship adapted from North America data suggest adjusting the Cfi of Equation 
10.3 during the cold months for maintenance requirements of open-lot fed cattle in colder climates  according to 
the following equation (Johnson, 1986):

Considering the average temperature during winter months, net energy for maintenance (NEm) requirements may 
increase by as much as 30 percent in northern North America.  This increase in feed use for maintenance leads to 
greater methane emissions. The Nutrient Requirements of Beef Cattle, 8th Revised Edition (2016) cautions that the 
general response to cold temperature can vary with thermal susceptibility of the animal, acclimation, and diet. 
Thus, Equation 10.2 may not be applicable for adapted animals, or for those protected by wind-breaks or shelter 
during cold weather. The equation should be applied to adjust the annual Cfi for unsheltered animals during the 
period in which they are first exposed to sub-zero (oC) temperatures, prior to their acclimation (a period of one to 
two months depending on the region). 
Average daily milk production (kg day-1): These data are for milking ewes, milking does, dairy cows and 
buffalo. The average daily production should be calculated by dividing the total annual production by 365, or 
reported as average daily production along with days of lactation per year, or estimated seasonal production divided 
by number of days per season. If using seasonal production data, the emission factor must be developed for 
seasonal period. 
Fat content (percent): Average fat content of milk is required for lactating cows, buffalo, sheep and goats 
producing milk for human consumption. 
Protein content (percent): Average protein content of milk is required for lactating cows, buffalo, sheep, and 
goats producing milk for human consumption. 
Percent of females that give birth in a year: This is collected for cattle, buffalo, sheep and goats. 
Number of off spring produced per year:  This is relevant to female livestock that have multiple births per year 
(e.g., ewes). 
Weaning age of calves: Prior to weaning  and to the development of an active rumen, calves do not emit methane. 
Since calves pre-weaning is a livestock subcategory, it will in any case be necessary for a country to determine the 
weaning age and the diet composition pre-weaning to choose the appropriate emission factor.  
Feed digestibility (DE): The portion of gross energy (GE) in the feed not excreted in the faeces is known as 
digestible energy expressed as a percentage (percent). Feed digestibility is commonly expressed as a percentage 
of GE or as TDN (total digestible nutrients). The percentage of feed that is not digested represents the percent of 
GE intake that will be excreted as faeces. Typical digestibility (DE) values for a range of livestock classes and diet 
types are presented in Table 10.2 as a guideline. The values have been refined compared to the 2006 IPCC 
Guidelines, based on more recent information (Table 10.2). For ruminants, common ranges of feed digestibility 
are 45-55 percent for crop by-products and range lands3; 55-80 percent for managed pastures, well preserved 
forages, crop by-products and grain supplemented forage-based diets; and 72-85 percent for grain-based diets fed 
 
3 Rangelands are defined as land primarily covered by natural grasslands, savannas, woodlands (not meeting the definition of 
Forest Land) and shrublands, including introduced plant species that are naturalised (Grice et al. 2008). 
 
Chapter 10: Emissions from Livestock and Manure Management

in feedlots. Variation in diet digestibility results directly in major variation in the estimated amount of feed needed 
to meet animal requirements and consequently is a main cause of variation in associated methane emissions and 
in the amounts of manure excreted (next to variation in yield of methane per unit of digested GE as explained 
further in Section 10.3). 
A low digestibility of feed will lead to lower feed intake and consequently reduced growth but at the same time a 
larger production of associated methane per unit of growth or production. Conversely, feeds with high digestibility 
will often result in higher feed intake and increased growth but at the same time a smaller amount of feed required 
per unit of growth and consequently lower associated methane production per unit growth or production. A factor 
directly affecting feed digestibility is the rate of passage of feed in the digestive tract, in particular in high 
productivity dairy cows (NRC 2001; Nousiainen et al. 2009) with direct impact on methane production as well, 
though in current Tier 2 methodology this impact is resolved through the selection of appropriate methane 
conversion rates instead of appropriate digestibility estimates (see Section 10.3.2). 
A change of 10 percent in DE will be magnified to change in 12 to 20 percent when estimating methane emissions 
and even more (20 to 45 percent) for amounts of manure excreted (volatile solids). It is important to note that feed 
requirements, feed digestibility, production and growth, and yield of methane from digested GE (explained further 
in Section 10.3) are co-dependent phenomena.   
Digestibility data should be based on measured values for the dominant feeds or forages being consumed by 
livestock with consideration for seasonal variation. In general, the digestibility of forages decreases with increasing 
maturity and is typically lowest during hot weather or dry season.  Due to significant variation, digestibility values 
should be obtained from local scientific data wherever possible.  Although a complete census of digestibility is 
considered unrealistic, at a minimum digestibility data from research studies should be consulted. While 
developing the digestibility data, associated feed characteristic data should also be recorded when available, such 
as feed content of neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), crude protein, crude fat, ash and the 
presence of anti-nutritional factors (e.g., alkaloids, phenolics). NDF and ADF are feed characteristics measured in 
the laboratory that are used to indicate the nutritive value of the feed for ruminant livestock. Determination of 
these values can enable DE to be predicted as defined in the last dairy National Research Council (2008) 
publication.  The concentration of crude protein in the feed can be used in the process of estimating nitrogen 
excretion (Section 10.5.2). Accurate estimation of the crude fat content of feed is important, especially in the case 
of high-fat feeds, for accurate estimation of the GE content in feed, which is needed to calculate feed intake needed 
to achieve GE requirements (Section 10.2.2.). 
Protein content in diet (CP, percent) ‚Äì the total amount of protein present in animal diet. It is determined by 
analysing the nitrogen content in animal feed and multiplying by 6.25. The data on CP percent is required for the 
calculation of N excretion using a Tier 2 method.  
Average annual wool production per sheep and goats (kg yr-1): The amount of wool produced in kilograms 
(after drying out but before scouring) is needed to estimate the amount of energy allocated for wool production. 
For goats this is only applicable if the country has relevant numbers of fibre-producing goats.

available for consumption as opposed to its degree of digestibility.  In instances where feed is not limiting and high quality 
feed sources are readily accessible for consumption, digestibility may approach values that are similar to those measured

Gross energy calculations 
Animal performance and diet data are used to estimate feed intake which is the amount of energy (MJ/day) animal 
needs for maintenance and for such as growth, lactation, and pregnancy. For inventory compilers who have well-
documented and recognised country-specific methods for estimating intake based on animal performance data, it 
is good practice to use the country-specific methods. The following section provides methods for estimating gross 
energy intake for the key ruminant categories of cattle, buffalo, sheep and goats.  The equations listed in Table 
10.3 are used to derive this estimate. If no country-specific methods are available, intake should be calculated 
using the equations listed in Table 10.3. As shown in the table, separate equations are used to estimate net energy 
requirements for sheep and goats as compared with cattle and buffalo. The equations used to calculate GE are as 
follows:

Net energy for activity: (NEa) is the net energy for activity, or the energy needed for animals to obtain their food, 
water and shelter. It is based on its feeding situation rather than characteristics of the feed itself. As presented in 
Table 10.3, the equation for estimating NEa for cattle and buffalo is different from the equation used for sheep and 
goats. Both equations are empirical with different definitions for the coefficient Ca.

Two methods for estimating the net energy required for lactation (NEl) are presented for sheep. The first method 
(Equation 10.9) is used when the amount of milk produced is known, and the second method (Equation 10.10) is 
used when the amount of milk produced is not known. Generally, milk production is known for ewes kept for

commercial milk production, but it is not known for ewes that suckle their young to weaning. With a known 
amount of milk production, the total annual milk production is divided by 365 days to estimate the average daily 
milk production in kg/day (Equation 10.9). When milk production is not known, AFRC (1990) indicates that for 
a single birth, the milk yield is about 5 times the weight gain of the lamb. For multiple births, the total annual milk 
production can be estimated as five times the combined weight gain of all lambs birthed by a single ewe. The daily 
average milk production is estimated by dividing the resulting estimate by 365 days as shown in Equation 10.10.

corresponds to a milk fat content of 7 percent  and 3.8 percent by weight for sheep and goats, 
respectively. Milk fat can vary greatly among breeds. Compilers are encouraged to use 
country-specific milk fat content to derive EVmilk when available 
Net energy for work: (NEwork ) is the net energy for work. It is used to estimate the energy required for draft power 
for cattle and buffalo. Various authors have summarised the energy intake requirements for providing draft power 
(Bamualim & Kartiarso 1985; Ibrahim 1985; Lawrence 1985). The strenuousness of the work performed by the 
animal influences the energy requirements, and consequently a wide range of energy requirements have been 
estimated. The values by Bamualim and Kartiarso show that about 10 percent of a day‚Äôs NEm requirements are 
required per hour for typical work for draft animals. This value is used as follows:

For fibre-producing sheep NEwool can be estimated that 0.25 MJ day-1 is retained in the fibre (AFRC 1993; AFRC

Net energy for pregnancy: (NEp) is the energy required for pregnancy. For cattle and buffalo, the total energy

of NEm. For sheep, the NEp requirement is similarly estimated for the 147-day gestation period, although the

developed from data in AFRC (1993); AFRC (1995), taking into account the inefficiency of energy 
conversion. 
When using NEp to calculate GE for cattle, sheep and goats, the NEp estimate must be weighted by the portion of 
the mature females that actually go through gestation in a year. For example, if 80 percent of the mature females 
in the animal category give birth in a year, then 80 percent of the NEp value would be used in the GE equation 
below. 
To determine the proper coefficient for sheep/goats, the portion of ewes/does that have single births, double births, 
and triple births is needed to estimate an average value for Cpregnancy. If these data are not available, the coefficient 
can be calculated as follows: 
‚Ä¢ If the number of lambs/kids born in a year divided by the number of ewes that are pregnant in a year is less 
than or equal to 1.0, then the coefficient for single births can be used. 
‚Ä¢ If the number of lambs/kids born in a year divided by the number of ewes/does that are pregnant in a year 
exceeds 1.0 and is less than 2.0, calculate the coefficient as follows: 
Cpregnancy = [(0.126 ‚óè Double birth fraction) + (0.077 ‚óè Single birth fraction)] 
Where: 
Double birth fraction = [(lambs born / pregnant ewes) ‚Äì 1] 
Single birth fraction  = [1 ‚Äì Double birth fraction]

Once the values for GE are calculated for each animal subcategory, the feed intake in units of kilograms of dry 
matter per day (kg day-1) should also be calculated.  To convert from GE in energy units to dry matter intake 
(DMI), divide GE by the energy density of the feed. A default value of 18.45 MJ kg-1 of dry matter can be used if 
feed-specific information is not available. The resulting daily dry matter intake should be in the order of 2 percent 
to 3 percent of the body weight of the mature or growing animals. In high producing milk cows, intakes may 
exceed 4 percent of body weight.

Prediction of DMI for cattle based on body weight and estimated dietary net energy concentration (NEmf) and 
digestibility values (DE): It is also possible to predict dry matter intake for mature and growing cattle based on 
body weight of the animal, and either the dietary net energy of maintenance concentration of the feed NEmf (MJ 
kg-1 DM) (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine 2016) or DE, and for lactating dairy cows, 
fat corrected milk production. Dietary NEmf concentration can range from 3.0 to 9.0 MJ kg-1 of dry matter. Typical 
values for high, moderate and low quality diets are presented in Table 10.8a.  These figures can also be used to 
estimate NEmf values for mixed diets based on estimate of diet quality. For example, a mixed forage-grain diet 
could be assumed to have a NEmf value similar to that of a high-quality forage diet. A mixed grain-straw diet could 
be assumed to have a NEmf value similar to that of a moderate quality forage. Nutritionists within specific 
geographical areas should be able to provide advice with regard to the selection of NEmf values that are more 
representative of locally fed diets.

Equations 10.17, 10.18, 10.18A and 10.18B and values in Table 10.8 provide a good check to the main Tier 2 
method to predict feed intake.  They can be viewed as asking ‚Äòwhat is an expected intake for a given diet quality?‚Äô 
and in the case that countries do not have the data required to carry out a full estimate of gross energy use for their 
catle herd, these equations could be used to independently predict DMI from BW, diet quality (NEmf  or DE percent) 
and milk production. In contrast, the main Tier 2 method predicts DMI based on how much feed must be consumed 
to meet estimated energy requirements (i.e., NEm and NEg) and does not consider the biological capacity of the 
animal to in fact consume the predicted quantity of feed. While the Tier 2 estimate of gross energy is the preferred 
method, the simplified Tier 2 method can be used to confirm that DMI values derived from the main Tier 2 method 
are biologically realistic.  These estimates are also subject to the cross check that dry matter intake should be in 
the order of 2 percent to 3 percent of the bodyweight of the mature or growing animals and up to 4 percent for 
high yielding lactating dairy cattle.

10.2.4 Characterisation for livestock without species: Specific 
emission estimation methods 
Some countries may have domesticated livestock for which there are currently no Tier 1 or Tier 2 emissions 
estimating methods (e.g., wapiti, bison or emus). Good practice in estimating emissions from these livestock is to 
first assess whether their emissions are likely to be significant enough to warrant characterising them and 
developing country-specific emission factors. Volume 1, Chapter 4 (Methodological Choice and Identification of 
Key Categories) presents guidance for assessing the significance of individual source categories within the national 
inventory. Similar approaches can be used to assess the importance of subsource categories (i.e. species) within a 
source category. If the emissions from a particular sub-species are determined to be significant, then country-
specific emission factors should be developed, and a characterisation should be performed to support the 
development of the emission factors. Research into the estimation of emission levels from these non-characterized 
species should be encouraged. The data and methods used to characterise the animals should be well documented. 
As emissions estimation methods are not available for these animals, approximate emission factors based on ‚Äòorder 
of magnitude calculations‚Äô are appropriate for conducting the assessment of the significance of their emissions. 
One approach for developing the approximate emission factors is to use the Tier 1 emissions factor for an animal 
with a similar digestive system and to scale the emissions factor using the ratio of the weights of the animals raised 
to the 0.75 power. The Tier 1 emission factors can be classified by digestive system as follows: 
‚Ä¢ Ruminant animals: Cattle, Buffalo, Sheep, Goats, Camels; 
‚Ä¢ Non-ruminant herbivores: Horses, Mules/Asses; 
‚Ä¢ Poultry: Chickens, Ducks, Turkeys, Geese; 
‚Ä¢ Non-poultry monogastric animals: Swine. 
For example, an approximate enteric fermentation methane emissions factor for wapiti could be estimated from 
the emissions factor for deer (also a ruminant animal) as follows: 
Approximate emissions factor = [(wapiti weight) / (deer weight)]0.75 * deer emissions factor 
Similarly, an approximate manure methane emissions factor could be estimated for emus using the Tier 1 emission 
factor for ostriches. Approximate emission factors developed using this method can only be used to assess the 
significance of the emissions from the animals, and are not considered sufficiently accurate for estimating 
emissions as part of a national inventory.

METHANE 
EMISSIONS 
FROM 
ENTERIC 
FERMENTATION 
Methane is produced in herbivores as a by-product of enteric fermentation, a digestive process by which 
carbohydrates are broken down by micro-organisms into simple molecules for absorption into the bloodstream.  
The amount of methane released depends on the type of digestive tract, age, and weight of the animal, and the 
quality and quantity of the feed consumed.  Ruminant livestock (e.g., cattle, sheep) are major sources of methane 
with moderate amounts produced from non-ruminant livestock (e.g., pigs, horses). The ruminant gut structure 
fosters extensive enteric fermentation of their diet.   
Digestive system 
The type of digestive system has a significant influence on the rate of methane emission.  Ruminant livestock 
have an expansive chamber known as the rumen, located at the fore-part of their digestive tract.  The rumen 
supports intensive microbial fermentation of the diet, which yields several nutritional advantages including the 
capacity to digest cellulose (the major component of fiber). The main ruminant livestock are cattle, buffalo, goats, 
sheep, deer and camelids.  Non-ruminant livestock (horses, mules, asses) and monogastric livestock (swine) have 
relatively lower methane emissions because much less methane-producing fermentation takes place in their 
digestive systems. 
Feed intake 
Methane is produced by the fermentation of feed within the animal's digestive system. Generally, the higher the 
feed intake, the higher the methane emission. Although, methane production is also affected by the composition 
of the diet. Feed intake is positively related to animal size, growth rate, and production (e.g., milk production, 
wool growth, or pregnancy). 
To reflect the variation in emission rates among animal species, the population of animals should be divided into 
subgroups, and an emission rate per animal is estimated for each subgroup. Types of population subgroups are 
provided in Section 10.2 (Livestock and Feed Characterisation). The amount of methane emitted by a population 
subgroup is calculated by multiplying the emission rate per animal by the number of animals within the subgroup. 
Natural wild ruminants are not considered in the derivation of a country‚Äôs emission estimate.  Emissions should 
only be considered from animals under domestic management (e.g., farmed deer, elk, and buffalo).  
10.3.1 Choice of method 
It is good practice to choose the method for estimating methane emissions from enteric fermentation according to 
the decision tree in Figure 10.2. The method for estimating methane emission from enteric fermentation requires 
three basic steps:

1. See Volume 1 Chapter 4, ‚ÄòMethodological Choice and Identification of Key Categories‚Äô (noting Section 4.1.2 on limited resources), for 
discussion of key categories and use of decision trees.
2. As a rule of  thumb, a livestock species would be significant if it accounts for 25-30% or more of emissions from the source category. 
 
Step 1:  Divide the livestock population into subgroups and characterize each subgroup as described in Section 
10.2.  It is recommended that national experts use annual averages estimated with consideration for the impact of 
production cycles and seasonal influences on population numbers. 
Step 2:  Estimate emission factors for each subgroup in terms of kilograms of methane per animal per year. 
Step 3:  Multiply the subgroup emission factors by the subgroup populations to estimate subgroup emission, 
and sum across the subgroups to estimate total emission. 
These three steps can be performed at varying levels of detail and complexity. This chapter presents the following 
three approaches: 
Tier 1 
A simplified approach that relies on default emission factors established in these guidelines that were either drawn 
from the literature or calculated using regional data taken from the literature and derived using the Tier 2 method.  
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
10.36 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
The Tier 1 method is likely to be suitable for most animal species in countries where enteric fermentation is not a 
key source category, or where enhanced characterization data are not available.  When approximate enteric 
emissions are derived by extrapolation from main livestock categories they should be considered to be a Tier 1 
method. 
Tier 1a 
An advanced Tier 1 method, applicable in particular to countries that have differentiated production systems with 
coexistence of low and high productivity systems, or whose agricultural production systems are transitioning from 
low to high productivity. Countries can consider the split in their production systems, yet still use default emission 
factors, to customize their emission estimates based on populations of high and low productivity animals and 
therefore track change in their emissions related to improved productivity.  
Tier 2 
A more complex approach that requires detailed country-specific data on gross energy intake and methane 
conversion factors for specific livestock categories. The Tier 2 method should be used if enteric fermentation is a 
key source category for the animal category that represents a large portion of the country‚Äôs total emissions.  
Tier 3  
Some countries for which livestock emissions are particularly important may wish to go beyond the Tier 2 method 
and incorporate additional country-specific information in their estimates.  This approach could employ the 
development of sophisticated models that consider diet composition in detail, concentration of products arising 
from ruminant fermentation, seasonal variation in animal population or feed quality and availability, and possible 
mitigation strategies. Many of these estimates would be derived from direct experimental measurements.  
Although countries are encouraged to go beyond the Tier 2 method presented below when data are available, these 
more complex analyses are only briefly discussed here.  A Tier 3 method should be subjected to a wide degree of 
international peer review such as that which occurs in peer-reviewed publications to ensure that they improve the 
accuracy and / or precision of estimates.  
Countries with large populations of domesticated animal species for which there are no IPCC default emission 
factors (e.g., llamas and alpacas) are encouraged to develop national methods that are similar to the Tier 2 method 
and are based on well-documented research (if it is determined that emissions from these livestock are significant).  
The approach is described in Section 10.2.4 under the heading ‚ÄòCharacterisation for livestock without species-
specific emission estimation methods‚Äô for more information. 
Table 10.9 summarises the suggested approaches for the livestock emissions included in this inventory. 
10.3.2 Choice of emission factors 
Tier 1 Approach for methane emissions from Enteric Fermentation 
This Tier 1 method is simplified so that only readily-available animal population data are needed to estimate 
emissions.  Default emission factors are presented for each of the recommended population subgroups.  Each step 
is discussed in turn. 
Step 1:  Animal population and productivity system 
The animal population data should be obtained using the approach described in Section 10.2.  
Step 2:  Emission factors 
The purpose of this step is to select emission factors that are most appropriate for the country's livestock 
characteristics. Default emission factors for enteric fermentation have been drawn from previous studies, and are 
organised by region and by productivity system for ease of use.  
The data used to estimate the default emission factors for enteric fermentation are presented in Annex 10A.1.

a The Tier 2 method is recommended for countries with large livestock populations.  Implementing the 
Tier 2 method for additional livestock subgroups may be desirable when the category emissions are a 
large portion of total methane emissions for the country. 
Table 10.10 shows the enteric fermentation emission factors for each of the animal species except cattle and 
buffalo.  As shown in the table, emission factors for sheep, goats and swine vary for low and high productivity 
systems and it is important to consider that these conditions may exist within individual countries. The differences 
in the emission factors are driven by differences in feed intake (as related to animal size) and feed characteristic 
assumptions. Table 10.11 presents the enteric fermentation emission factors for cattle and buffaloes, accordingly.  
A range of emission factors is shown for typical regional conditions.  
Animal size and milk production are important determinants of emission rates for dairy cows. Relatively smaller 
dairy cows with low levels of production are found in Asia, Africa, and the Indian subcontinent. Relatively larger 
dairy cows with high levels of production are found in North America, Western Europe and several countries of 
Latin America. 
Animal size and population structure and production systems implemented are important determinants of emission 
rates for other cattle. Relatively smaller other cattle are found in Asia, Africa, and the Indian subcontinent.  Also, 
many of the other cattle in these regions are young.  Other cattle in North America, Western Europe and Oceania 
are larger, and young cattle constitute a smaller portion of the population. 
For countries with highly differentiated agricultural systems in which there is a coexistence of low and high 
productivity systems or whose agricultural systems are transitioning from local low input productivity systems to 
higher productivity systems and do not have the information necessary for implementing Tier 2 method, the use 
of the diversification of emission factors given for an animal category provides an alternative or intermediary 
option. This approach can reflect changes in activity data and productivity with time, whereas the Tier 1a approach 
only takes into account changes in the number of animals in a country. 
To select emission factors from Tables 10.10 and 10.11 identify the region most applicable to the country being 
evaluated. Scrutinise the tabulations in Annex 10A.1 to ensure that the underlying animal characteristics such as 
weight, growth rate and milk production used to develop the emission factors are similar to the conditions in the 
country. The data collected on the average annual milk production by dairy cows should be used to help select a 
dairy cow emission factor. If necessary, interpolate between dairy cow emission factors shown in the table using 
the data collected on average annual milk production per head.  
Note that using the same Tier 1 emission factors for the inventories of successive years means that no allowance 
is being made for changing livestock productivity, such as increasing milk productivity or trend in live weight. If 
it is important to capture the trend in methane emission that results from a trend in livestock productivity, then 
livestock emissions can become a key source category based on trend and a Tier 2 calculation should be used.

Emission factors: camels from Gibbs & Johnson (1993); Alpacas from Pinares-Patino et al. (2003); Deer from Clark et al. (2003); Sheep

10B.3. Emission factors for other livestock from Crutzen et al. (1986), 
1 For the application of the simple Tier 1, for all regions other than North America, Europe and Oceania the Tier 1 default values are the 
low productivity EFs. 
2 One approach for developing the approximate emission factors is to use the Tier 1 emissions factor for an animal with a similar digestive 
system and to scale the emissions factor using the ratio of the weights of the animals raised to the 0.75 power. Liveweight values have been 
included for this purpose. Emission factors should be derived on the basis of characteristics of the livestock and feed of the animals and 
compilers should not base their decision of an emission factor entirely on regional characteristics.  
3 The enteric fermentation emission factor shall be applied for the whole livestock population including non-mature animals. 
4 CH4 EF for ostrich was calculated based on Frei et al. (2015) and Danish NIR (Nielsen et al. 2018). 
5 Sources and assumptions to adjust weight of goats for low- and high-productivity systems are detailed in Annex 10B.3. 
6 The values of swine weight for low and high productivity systems were obtained from FAO GLEAM databases (FAO 2017). More detailed 
data on swine weight are reported in Annex 10A.2 (in Table 10A.5). Crutzen et al. (1986) did not report weights for swine. Regional Tier 
2 calculations for swine have been carried out by the FAO GLEAM research group, countries could consult these values for consistency 
with their production systems for refinement to their emission factors. 
7 If a country-specific liveweight of animal category is different from those reported in Table 10.10, an inventory-compiler may use the 
approach presented in section 10.2.4 of the current chapter.  
It is recommended to continue to use Tier 1 emission factor uncertainty ranges as defined in Section 10.3.4 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. 
Step 3:  Total emission 
To estimate total emission, the selected emission factors are multiplied by the associated animal population 
(Equation 10.19) and summed (Equation 10.20):

1 Emission factors should be derived on the basis of the characteristics of the cattle and feed of the animals and compilers should not base their 
decision of an emission factor entirely on regional characteristics. 
2 The values represent averages within region. Existing values were derived using Tier 2 method and the data in Tables 10A.1‚Äì10A.4.  Data on 
a livestock population mix corresponding to low- and high-productivity systems were used. 
3 Uncertainty values from the 2006 IPCC Guidelines were validated during the development of the emission factors using a Monte Carlo analysis 
in the 2019 Refinement, based on data compiled during the emission factor development process. It is recommended to continue to use Tier 1 
emission factor uncertainty ranges as defined in Section 10.3.4 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. 
4 All data are weighted values, representative of Australia and New Zealand. For Pacific Island nations, GHG inventory compilers may refer to 
Asian values. GHG inventory compilers from the Island nations of Oceania who wish to use a Tier 1a method could use values from Asia for 
low productivity systems and the high productivity Tier 1a emission factor from Oceania, whichever is more representative of their production 
systems.

Tier 2 Approach for methane emissions from Enteric Fermentation 
The Tier 2 method is applied to more disaggregated livestock population categories and used to calculate emission 
factors, as opposed to default values. The key considerations for the Tier 2 method are the development of 
emission factors and the collection of detailed activity data. 
Step 1:  Livestock population 
The animal population data and related activity data should be obtained following the approach described in 
Section 10.2. 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
10.44 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Step 2:  Emission factors 
When the Tier 2 method is used, emission factors are estimated for each animal category using the detailed data 
developed in Step 1. 
The emission factors for each category of livestock are estimated based on the gross energy intake and methane 
conversion factor for the category. The gross energy intake data should be obtained using the approach described 
in Section 10.2.  The following two sub-steps need to be completed to calculate the emission factor under the Tier 
2 method: 
1. Obtaining the methane conversion factor (Ym) 
The extent to which feed energy is converted to CH4 depends on several interacting feed and animal factors and 
that rate of conversion is embodied in the methane conversion factor (Ym), defined as the percentage of gross 
energy intake converted to methane.  
There are a wide variety of factors that influence methane conversion rates and due to national circumstances 
related to breeds, genetic pools as well as particularities of feed and herd interactions, the Ym factors may vary 
from region to region. Considering interactions between feed (type and quality) and animals (breed and genetics), 
it is good practice for countries to derive their own Ym values considering their herds and their typical feed 
characteristics. 
Nonetheless, numerous empirical studies demonstrate the statistical significance of improved feed quality on 
methane emission rates and biochemical modelling exhibits the biochemical processes that impact methane 
production with the introduction of improved feeds and concentrates to ruminant diets  (Mills et al. 2001; Mills 
et al. 2003; Ellis et al. 2006; Ellis et al. 2007; Ellis et al. 2009; Ellis et al. 2010; Alemu et al. 2011; Bannink et 
al. 2011; Ellis et al. 2014; Escobar-Bahamondes et al. 2016; Kebreab et al. 2016). When country specific Ym 
factors for cattle and buffalo are unavailable, the values provided in Table 10.12 can be used. These estimates are 
a guide based on the general feed characteristics and production practices found in many countries. It is good 
practice for compilers to justify their choice of Ym factors based on detailed feed data and research.  
In Table 10.12, the Ym of dairy cows is linked to annual milk production levels and to feed quantity and quality. 
The lowest Ym value is associated with highest producing dairy cattle that are fed diets of greater than 70 percent 
digestibility, and that have percentage of NDF in DMI of less than 35 percent. These diets may be further 
supplemented with additives or supplements that impact feed efficiency. In cases where countries are achieving 
high production on high quality silage diets that have digestibility greater than 70 percent but also NDF greater 
than 35 percent of DMI, compilers should use Ym values that are midway between the high production and the 
mid-range productivity Ym values (6.0 percent GEI).  
Diets with digestible fractions that range from 63 to 70 percent and NDF greater than 37 percent DMI, consisting 
of good quality forages, silages and some grains and have associated milk production between 5000 to 8500 kg 
year-1, are advised to use Ym values of 6.3 percent GEI. For low production dairy systems with feed digestibility 
less than 62 percent and NDF fractions greater than 38 percent, the Ym factor from the 2006 IPCC Guidelines 
(6.5) has been maintained as there is a paucity of reliable globally representative data that could be used to revise 
that value. In cases where dairy cattle are strictly grazed on low quality forage diets, compilers should use the 
non-dairy low quality forage value of 7.0 percent GEI. 
It is important for inventory compilers to base their decision to select the Ym on a thorough understanding of 
national feeding systems. In the case of dairy cows, milk production is presented as a proxy for feed quality and 
Ym values in Table 10.12 represent the relationship between feed quality and methane yield. It is possible for a 
country‚Äôs national herd, or for parts of the national herd, to have production levels that are inconsistent with the 
feed quality bounds that are defined by the categories in Table 10.12. In these cases, it is good practice to develop 
their own country-specific Ym factors, and they should also use their information on animal diets to validate their 
choice of Ym against methane yield equations recommended in Niu et al. (2018). 
With the non-dairy animal category, the non-feedlot diets can be differentiated between forage based diets for 
which the Ym value of 7.0 should be used, and mixed concentrate diets or high quality forage diets for which 
compilers should use the value of 6.3. Reliable estimates for grazing cattle on very poor quality diets are not 
available, and due to the lack of data, the value of 7.0 is recommended. Countries that have large cattle herds 
consuming these types of diets are encouraged to develop country-specific values and research efforts should 
focus on providing more data on these cattle herds.  
Emissions from feedlot animals are influenced by the type of grain fed to the animals during the finishing stage, 
the lowest value of 3.0 can be used when steam-flaked corn is fed at rates greater than 90 percent of the diet in 
combination with ionophores. Low forage diets of less than 15 percent that incorporate other grains are 
recommended to use the value of 4.0.  
 
Chapter 10: Emissions from Livestock and Manure Management 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
10.45 
A methane conversion rate of zero is assumed for all juveniles consuming only milk (i.e., milk-fed lambs and 
calves). While some studies have demonstrated low level emissions from calves during the activation of their 
rumens (Gerrits et al. 2014), the Ym for the addition of small quantities of emission from unweaned calves does 
not significantly influence emission factors. For weaned animals the Ym values indicated for the non-dairy animal 
category are recommended. 
Due to the importance of Ym in driving emissions, ongoing research is aimed at improving estimates for different 
livestock and feed combinations. It is important to better understand the mechanisms involved in methanogenesis 
with a view to designing emission abatement strategies, as well as to identify different values for Ym according to 
animal husbandry practices.  
Significant improvements are needed for grazing animals in general, but in particular for low producing dairy 
cattle on diverse diets and grazing animals on low quality forages particularly in tropical regions as the available 
data are currently very sparse. 
Regional, national and global estimates of enteric methane generation rely on small-scale determinations both of 
Ym and of the influence of feed and animal properties upon Ym. Traditional methods for measuring Ym include 
the use of respiration calorimeters and head enclosures for housing individual animals (Johnson & Johnson 1995). 
A tracer technique using SF6 enables methane emissions from individual animals to be estimated under both 
housed or grazing conditions (Johnson et al. 1994). Hammond et al. (2015) present an in-depth review of the 
advantages and limitations of methane measurement techniques used to determine Ym values.

3 Uncertainty values are ¬± 20% based on published standard deviations from Niu et al. (2018) and data compilations for non dairy cattle 
as described in Annex 10B.2. 
4 Ym cited for dairy cattle are for lactating dairy cows. For dairy cattle during their dry phase, in high and medium production systems, the 
non-dairy high quality forage value (6.3) should be selected and for low production systems with >75% low quality forage the value of  
(7.0) should be selected.  
5 The lowest Ym factor for high producing cows refers to feeding situations in which additives or supplements may be used in production 
that stimulate feed use efficiency and/or milk production. The Ym values given here do not yet account for any potential reducing effect 
of additives or supplements on Ym.  
6 For details on the development of these values, refer to Annex 10B.2. 
Table 10.13 proposes a common Ym value for all sheep irrespective of feed quality values. This value is based on 
the mean value of raw data from New Zealand collated between 2009 and 2015 (Swainson et al. 2016). Data were 
derived from respiration chamber measurements where intake was accurately measured and covered a range of 
diet qualities. These replace values in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines which were based on indirect measurements 
using the sulphur hexafluoride tracer technique where dry matter intake was generally estimated in grazing 
animals (Ulyatt et al. 2002a; Ulyatt et al. 2002b; Ulyatt et al. 2005). The mean value of 6.7 percent is most 
appropriate for situations where average dry matter intake per day is between 0.6 and 0.8 kg day-1 with a value of 
7.0 percent being more appropriate where average intake is <0.6 kg day-1, and a value of 6.5 percent being more 
appropriate where average intakes are >0.8kg day-1. Table 10.13 also includes a Ym value for goats (2006 IPCC 
Guidelines did not propose any specific value for goats). This value is based on the analysis of 65 studies that 
calculated in-vivo enteric CH4 production from a varied sample of countries and goat breeds (sources and 
assumptions are explained in Annex 10B.3).

conversion factors from the reported livestock that most closely resembles those livestock types can be used.  For 
example, CH4 conversion factors for other cattle or buffalo could be applied to estimate an emission factor for 
camels. 
2. Emission factor development 
Using the energy balance Tier 2 approach an emission factor for each animal category should be developed 
following Equation 10.21:

These emission factor equations assume that the emission factors are being developed for an animal category for 
an entire year (365 days). While a full year emission factor is typically used, in some circumstances the animal 
category may be defined for a shorter period (e.g., for the wet season of the year or for a 150-day feedlot feeding 
period). In this case, the emission factor would be estimated for the specific period (e.g., the wet season) and the 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
10.48 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
365 days would be replaced by the number of days in the period. The definition of the period to which the emission 
factor applies is described in Section 10.2, defined according the the enhanced livestock characterisation that is 
used in calculation methodology. 
Step 3:  Total emissions 
To estimate total emissions, the selected emission factors are multiplied by the associated animal population and 
summed. As described above under Tier 1, the emissions estimates should be reported in gigagrams (Gg). 
Potential for refinement of Tier 2 or development of a Tier 3 method to enteric 
methane emission inventories 
Increased accuracy and identification of causes of variation in emissions are at the heart of inventory purpose.  
Improvements in country methodology, whether as components of current Tier 1 or 2 or if additional refinements 
are implemented with Tier 3, are encouraged. 
Tier 1 and Tier 2 enteric methane emissions factors and estimation procedures are driven by first estimating daily 
and annual gross energy consumption by individual animals within an inventory class which are then multiplied 
by an estimate of CH4 loss per unit of feed (Ym).  There is considerable room for improvement in Tier 2 prediction 
of both feed intake and in Ym. Factors potentially impacting feed requirements and/or consumption may include: 
‚Ä¢ depression in digestibility with increasing levels of consumption or due to rumen acidification, feed 
preparation or diet composition putting limits to feed intake;  
‚Ä¢ breed or genotype variation in maintenance requirement; and  
‚Ä¢ heat and cold stress effects on feed intake and maintenance requirements. 
Likewise, a host of interacting factors cause variation in the rumen microbiome and its fermentation profile, and 
hence in hydrogen production which delivers the main substrate for methanogens. These factors lead to variation 
in Ym that may include: 
‚Ä¢ variation in feed digestibility (DE);  
‚Ä¢ breed or genotype variation;  
‚Ä¢ level of feed intake;  
‚Ä¢ chemical composition of feed; 
‚Ä¢ kinetics of particle and fluid passage and of digestion, rumen volume, rumen fermentation profile; and  
‚Ä¢ other factors (such as secondary plant compounds, additives and other products) affecting the rumen 
microbiome.  
The values in Table 10.12 capture some aspects of these factors as they are broadly related to feed quality and 
animal productivity, however these estimates can be improved for country-specific circumstances using higher 
tier methods. Accurate estimation of diet DE is singularly important in the estimation of feed intake and enteric 
methane emission, as previously emphasized. A change of 10 percent in DE will be magnified to a change in CH4 
emissions ranging from 12 to 20 percent depending on the dietary circumstances for which calculations are made. 
The depression in DE with increasing daily amounts of feed consumed (increasing rates of passage) is not 
inherently considered with Tier 2 and this neglect could underestimate feed intakes of high producing dairy cows 
consuming mixtures of concentrates and forages as is common in the North America and Europe, and hence 
underestimate methane emission. The balance between both effects (i.e. a reduction of feed digestibility and of 
Ym) determines the net effect on methane emission which may vary with dietary circumstances. More complex 
models may be developed as Tier 3 to capture the intricacies of such effects. 
There have been many attempts to refine estimates of Ym. Several researchers have developed models which relate 
the chemical composition of the diet consumed, or in more detail, the composition of digested carbohydrate and 
other chemical components to Ym. These models typically predict diet particle and chemical component rates of 
passage and digestion in each enteric compartment at varying intake and the resulting H2 balance, volatile fatty 
acids, and microbial and CH4 yields. These approaches have generated Ym values that are consistent with direct 
measurements (Bannink et al. 2011; Gregorini et al. 2013; Huhtanen et al. 2015; Dougherty et al. 2017). A 
mechanistic model has been developed in the Netherlands that employs Tier 3 approach (Bannink et al. 2011) to 
estimate CH4 yield from dairy cattle while the US use mechanistic models (Baldwin 1995; Kebreab et al. 2008) 
to refine estimates of Ym for dairy and beef in different states within the US.  
 
Chapter 10: Emissions from Livestock and Manure Management 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
10.49 
The literature contains many examples of the positive relationship of plant cell wall digestion to high acetic to 
propionic end-product ratios, and to high CH4 yields. While fibrous carbohydrate digestion is the strongest 
indicator of CH4 yield, the CH4 per digested fiber is not constant and enteric fermentation of similar fibrous feeds 
can result in different Ym values.  For example, grass silage made from grass cut at different stages of maturity 
resulted in strongly different carbohydrate and protein composition, resulting in Ym values varying from 5.5 to 
6.9 percent with increased maturity and intake  (Warner et al. 2017). Exchange of carbohydrates may also lead to 
a lower Ym as demonstrated in studies where dietary starch content is increased through a higher proportion of 
corn silage (Hassanat et al. 2013; Benchaar et al. 2014) or through a higher proportion of starch containing 
concentrates (Aguerre et al. 2011).  Prerequisite for the use of more complex prediction models for broad country 
inventories is that the data need to be provided to drive these more complex models of feed intake or Ym.  It is 
often difficult to define animal characteristics, productivity, and DE accurately for a livestock category in various 
regions or various production systems in a country. Of particular importance is a good characterization of 
roughages when they constitute a main part of the diet. 
Ongoing global research, such as the use of direct methanogen inhibitors, 3-nitrooxypropanol (3-NOP), oxygen-
rich anions, fats and oils, ionophores or condensed tannins, and also genetic selection suggests a need to address 
how they should be reflected in inventory compilation at Tier 2 or Tier 3. First, it is good practice that the 
inventory reflect only those technologies or genotypes developed through selection, conform to QA/QC principles 
and have attracted a wide degree of international acceptance such as through peer-reviewed articles that include a 
description of the technology, its efficacy and validation under field conditions. Second, it is good practice that 
the inventory be accompanied by evidence of the uptake of the technology in agricultural practice, and apply it 
only to emissions by those livestock where uptake can be validated. Mitigation measures and their representation 
in inventory compilation should be supported by peer-reviewed publications. 
Concluding, approaches to improve estimates of feed intake (i.e. of diet composition, DE and dietary GE content) 
and Ym, and approaches to account for specific mitigation measures are to be encouraged, given due care on 
limitations of the scope and on production circumstances where mitigation measures are applied and to which 
predictive models or relationships must apply as well. 
10.3.3 Choice of activity data 
Livestock population data should be obtained using the approach described in Section 10.2. If using default enteric 
emission factors for livestock (Tables 10.10, 10.11) to estimate enteric emissions, a basic (Tier 1) livestock 
population characterisation is sufficient. To estimate enteric emissions from livestock using estimation of Gross 
Energy Intake (Equations 10.21, or 10.21A), a Tier 2 characterisation is needed. As noted in Section 10.2, good 
practice in characterising livestock populations is to conduct a single characterisation that will provide the activity 
data for all emissions sources that depend on livestock population data.

METHANE 
EMISSIONS 
FROM 
MANURE 
MANAGEMENT 
This section describes how to estimate CH4 produced during the storage and treatment of manure, and from manure 
deposited on pasture. The Tier 1 approach is based on default emission factors per unit volatile solid (VS) by animal 
category and manure storage system. The Tier 2 is based on country-specific estimates of volatile solids and the impact 
of interactions between manure management systems and animal categories on total CH4 emissions during excretion 
and storage, including manure treatments such as the production of biogas.  
The term ‚Äòmanure‚Äô is used here collectively to include both dung and urine (i.e., the solids and the liquids) produced 
by livestock. The emissions associated with the burning of dung for fuel are to be reported under Volume 2 (Energy), 
or under Volume 5 (Waste) if burned without energy recovery. When manure is used in the production of biogas, the 
emissions reported under the manure management category are those occurring on the farm site not resulting from 
combustion.  These include, on-farm storage of the digestion input materials - pre-digestion, leakage during the 
digestion process and emissions from the storage and application of digestate to agricultural fields (included in Volume 
4, Chapter 11, Section 11.2, Nitrous oxide emissions from managed Soils). Emissions from biogas combustion during 
the production of energy, whether on or off farm should be reported under Volume 2 ‚ÄúEnergy‚Äù. 
The decomposition of manure under anaerobic conditions (i.e., in the absence of oxygen), during storage and 
treatment, produces CH4. These conditions occur most readily when large numbers of animals are managed in a 
confined area (e.g., dairy farms, beef feedlots, and swine and poultry farms), and where manure is disposed of in 
liquid-based systems. Emissions of CH4 related to manure handling and storage are reported under ‚ÄòManure 
Management.‚Äô   
The main factors affecting CH4 emissions are the amount of manure produced and the portion of the manure that 
decomposes anaerobically. The former depends on the rate of waste production per animal and the number of animals, 
and the latter on how the manure is managed. When manure is stored or treated as a liquid (e.g., in lagoons, ponds, 
tanks, or pits), it decomposes anaerobically and can produce a significant quantity of CH4. The temperature and the 
retention time of the storage unit greatly affect the amount of methane produced. When manure is handled as a solid 
(e.g., in stacks or piles) or when it is deposited on pastures and rangelands, it tends to decompose under more aerobic 
conditions and less CH4 is produced. 
10.4.1 Choice of method 
There are three tiers to estimate CH4 emissions from livestock manure as shown in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. 
To be consistent with consideration of differing productivity classes in section of enteric fermentation, a new Tier 1 
was developed. In some regions, particularly in developing countries, production systems can vary between high 
productivity systems aimed at commercial food production and low productivity systems, largely serving local food 
production. In this case countries may choose to use a Tier 1 method in which emission factors are defined for low 
and high productivity systems based on the updated volatile solids and B0, and the values of volatile solids were 
aligned with the updated enteric fermentation section.  
Guidance for determining which methods to use is shown in Figure 10.3 decision tree. 
Tier 1 
The Tier 1 method entails multiplying the total amount of VS excreted (from all livestock species/categories) in each 
type of manure management system by an emission factor for that type of livestock category in the specified climate 
zone and manure management system (see Equation 10.22). Emissions are summed over all manure management 
systems and livestock categories. The Tier 1 method is applied using IPCC default VS excretion rates (See Table 
10.13a), default typical animal mass (see Table 10A.5), default CH4 Emission Factors (see Table 10.14), and default 
animal waste management systems (AWMS). Animal waste management system (manure management systems)  data 
have been collected for regions and countries by the FAO and average manure fractions treated by different 
management systems are presented in Annex 10A.2, Tables 10A.6  to 10A.9. As emissions from manure management 
systems are highly temperature dependent, it is good practice to consider the climate zone associated with the locations 
 
Chapter 10: Emissions from Livestock and Manure Management 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
10.51 
where manure is managed. Breakdowns of manure management systems by regional climate zone and production 
system can be found in the supplemental data supplied with this chapter. Please refer to "Raw data for cattle and 
buffalo spreadsheet". Further finer-scale country-specific data is also available from FAO GLEAM databases (FAO 
2017). 
An advanced Tier 1a method has been developed as an alternative for countries with differentiated agricultural systems 
in which there is a coexistence of low and high productivity systems or whose agricultural systems are transitioning 
from local low input productivity systems to higher productivity systems. In this case, where countries  do not have 
the information necessary for implementing Tier 2 systems, the use of the productivity based emission factors given 
for an animal category provides an alternative or intermediary option. The advanced Tier 1a approach will provide an 
estimate of the changes in both productivity and manure management that occur when a transition from lower 
productivity systems to higher productivity systems occurs.  
Tier 2 
A more complex method for estimating CH4 emissions from manure management should be used where a particular 
livestock species/category represents a significant share of a country‚Äôs emissions. This method requires detailed 
information on animal characteristics and manure management practices, which is used to develop emission factors 
specific to the conditions of the country.  
The main differences between the Tier 1 and Tier 2 calculations is whether default information or country-specific 
information is used in the calculation of emissions from manure management system. The Tier 2 system provides a 
much wider group of options for estimating emissions from different manure management systems. 
Tier 3 
Some countries for which livestock emissions are particularly important may wish to go beyond the Tier 2 method 
and develop models for country-specific methodologies or use measurement‚Äìbased approaches to quantify emission 
factors.   
The method chosen will depend on data availability and national circumstances. Good practice in estimating CH4 
emissions from manure management systems entails making every effort to use the Tier 2 method, including 
calculating emission factors using country-specific information. The Tier 1 method should only be used if all possible 
avenues to use the Tier 2 method have been exhausted and/or it is determined that the source is not a key category or 
subcategory.  
Regardless of the method chosen, the animal population must first be divided into categories as described in Section 
10.2 that reflect the varying amounts of manure produced per animal. 
The following steps are used to estimate CH4 emissions from manure management:  
Step 1:  Collect population data based on the Livestock Population Characterization (see Section 10.2). 
Step 2:  Identify default (Table 10A.5) or collect country-specific typical animal mass (TAM) values. Calculate 
volatile solid excretion according to Equation 10.22a or develop country-specific volatile solid excretion rates 
according to Equation 10.24. 
Step 3:  Collect country-specific information on manure management system methods and develop country-specific 
manure management system fractions or use default manure storage fractions presented in Annex Tables 10A.6 to 
Tables 10A.9. 
Step 4:  Identify either default emission factors Table 10.14 or build country-specific emission factors for each 
livestock subcategory  based on climate zones and manure management system fractions. 
‚Ä¢ Tier 1: Identify default values (Table 10.14) for emission factors for each livestock category in terms of grams of 
methane per kg VS per year for the appropriate climate zone and productivity class if using advanced Tier 1a. 
‚Ä¢ Tier 2: Select local manure management specific methane conversion factors (MCF‚Äôs, Table 10.17) for different 
climate zones and the animal categories specific maximum methane producing capacity (B0). 
Step 5:  Calculate methane emission for each livestock subcategory.

‚Ä¢ Tier 1: According to Equation 10.22 for each livestock category, climate zone (include production level if using 
Tier 1a) multiply the livestock category population (Step 1) by quantity of volatile solid (Step 2) by the manure 
storage fraction (Step 3) and the default emission factor (Step 4).  
‚Ä¢ Tier 2: According to Equation 10.23, for each livestock category and climate zone calculate the country-specific 
emission factor based on the country-specific or default quantity of volatile solids (Step 2), the manure 
management system fraction (AWMS) and the MCF and B0 factors (Step 4); To estimate total emissions, the 
country specific emission factor is then multiplied by the population number (Step 1). 
Step 6:  Sum emissions from all defined livestock categories to determine national emissions.

10.4.2 Choice of emission factors 
The best way to determine emission factors is to conduct non-invasive or non-disturbing measurements of emissions 
in actual systems representative of those in use in the country. These field results can be used to develop models to 
estimate emission factors (Tier 3). Such measurements are difficult to conduct, and require significant resources and 
expertise, and equipment that may not be available. Thus, while such an approach is recommended to improve 
accuracy, it is not required for good practice. This section provides two alternatives for developing emission factors, 
with the selection of emission factors depending on the method (i.e., Tier 1 or Tier 2) chosen for estimating emissions. 
Tier 1 
When using the Tier 1 method, methane emission factors per unit of VS by livestock category or subcategory are used. 
Default emission factors by animal productivity class, manure management system and climate zone are presented in 
Table 10.14 for each of the recommended population subcategories. These emission factors represent the range in 
manure management practices used in each region, as well as the difference in emissions due to climate zone.  
Tables 10A.5 through 10A.9 located in Annex 10A.2 present the underlying assumptions used for each region. 
Countries using a Tier 1 method to estimate methane emissions from manure management should review the regional 
variables in these tables to identify the region that most closely matches their animal operations, and use the default 
emission factors for that region. 
Annual volatile solid excretion rates should be determined for each livestock category defined by the livestock 
population characterization.  Country-specific rates may either be taken directly from documents or reports such as 
agricultural industry and scientific literature, or calculated based on estimates of dry matter intake (DMI), ash content 
and urinary energy (as explained below). In some situations, it may be appropriate to use excretion rates developed 
by other countries that have livestock with similar characteristics.  
 
Chapter 10: Emissions from Livestock and Manure Management 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
10.55 
If country-specific data cannot be collected or derived, or appropriate data are not available from another country, the 
IPCC default volatile solid excretion rates presented in Table 10.13a can be used. These rates are presented in units 
of volatile solid excreted per 1000 kg of animal per day. These rates can be applied to livestock sub-categories of 
varying ages and growth stages using a typical average animal mass (TAM) for that population sub-category, as shown 
in Equation 10.22a for a Tier 1 calculation. The TAM should be consistent with median weight of the animal during 
its production stage. Typically, for animals used in meat production systems, this is the median weight of the animal 
during its growth period. Animals that are kept for the production of products (milk, eggs), draft or other uses would 
use the typical live weight of the animal herd. 
Volatile solids should be calculated according to Equation 10.22a, either for the simple Tier 1 or the advanced Tier 
1a, where parameters are split by their productivity class in the calculaton of volatile solid excretion. Note that if 
countries are mixing Tier 1 and Tier 2 methods and volatile solids are calculated through Equation 10.22A and are 
applied in Equation 10.23 (Tier 2), the constant of 365 should be removed from that equation.

( ,
TAM T P)
 
= typical animal mass for livestock category T,  for productivity system P (when applicable), kg 
animal-1 
The calculation is a simple linear adjustment, so in the case of an animal that is 500 kg of weight, the VS emission 
rate will be half of the rate presented per 1000 kg live weight. 
Default TAM values are provided in Table 10A.5 as well as in the Annexes of Chapter 10 of the 2006 IPCC 
Guidelines. However, it is preferable to collect country-specific TAM values to be able to track changes in emissions 
with changes in productivity and animal size in certain animal categories. For example, market swine may vary from 
nursery pigs weighing less than 30 kilograms to finished pigs that weigh over 90 kilograms. By constructing animal 
population groups that reflect the various growth stages of market pigs, countries will be better able to estimate the 
total volatile solid excreted by their swine population. 
Table 10.14 shows the default emission factors per kg of volatile solid excretion and year for all animal categories for 
each manure management system and climate zone. Emission factors are listed for the climate zone where the livestock 
manure is managed. It is good practice for countries to estimate the percentage of animal populations in different 
climate zones and compute a weighted average emission factor. Where this is not possible, an estimate should be made 
based on the proportion of area in each climate zone; however, this may not give an accurate estimate of emissions 
that are highly sensitive to temperature variations (e.g., liquid/slurry systems).  
Separate emission factors are shown for high and low productivity systems in these t*ables, reflecting the general 
differences in feed intake and feed characteristics of the animals in regions that have highly differential production 
systems existing in the same country. Emission factors result from the MCFs in Table 10.17 and the B0 in Table 10.16 
and as a result, vary by animal category and manure management system, with liquid systems demonstrating higher 
emissions per unit VS. Lower emission factors associated with low productivity systems are representative of the 
lower B0 values associated with  lower quality feeds and manures with high C to N ratios.

DEFAULT VALUES FOR VOLATILE SOLID EXCRETION RATE (KG VS (1000 KG ANIMAL MASS)-1 DAY-1) 
1 High PS and Low PS refer to high and low productivity systems required for Tier 1a methodology. 
2 NE is reported when values are not estimated, due to their not being adequate differences between high and low productivity production systems and NA refers to situations in which these animal categories do not 
occur in these regions. 
3 Values are taken from FAO GLEAM databases (FAO 2017). 
4 Values are derived from diets used in the calculation of enteric fermentation Tier 1 emission factors. 
5 Calculations are detailed in Annex 10B.3. 
6 North African countries may wish to use values from the Middle East if their production systems are more similar. 
7 All data are weighted values, representative of Australia and New Zealand. For Pacific Island nations, GHG inventory compilers may refer to Asian values. GHG inventory compilers from the Island nations from 
Oceania may wish to use a Tier 1a approach. In this case, they could used values from Asia, or low productivity systems and high Tier 1a emission factor from Oceania, whichever is more representative to their 
production systems. 
8 Values are derived directly from the parameters reported in Table 10A-9 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.

All values are calculated based on MCFs and B0s reported in Tables 10.17 and 10.16,  respectively, using the equation MCF*B0*0.67. 
1 For the application of Tier 1, for all regions other than North America, Europe and Oceania the Tier 1 default values are the low productivity EFs. Pasture range and paddock emission factor is based on observation in the 
updated version of Cai et al. (2017) database (see Annex 10B.6). No differences were observed for animal type, region or productivity class and are therefore reported as a constant for all animal and productivity categories. 
2 Temp. is an abbreviation for temperate. 
3 Composting is the biological oxidation of organic material. 
4 Definitions of manure management systems can be found in Table 10.18. 
5 Emissions for liquid systems are calculated from manure management systems with a 6 month retention time. 
6 Buffalo emission factors are equivalent to low productivity non dairy animals. 
7 Uncertainty is ¬±30% consisten with the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. 
8 Anaerobic digestion biogas values: for high productivity are based on emission estimates from high quality gas-tight digesters and average MCFs for storage whereas, for low productivity are based on emission estimates 
from high digester leakage rates and average MCFs for storage leakage rates. Countries should consider the type and quality of digesters used in their individual countries in evaluating what emission factors they choose to 
employ as opposed to the level of productivity for anaerobic digesters only.

cattle, buffalo and swine characteristics and manure management systems can vary significantly by country, 
countries with large populations of these animals should consider using the Tier 2 method for estimating methane 
emissions.  
The Tier 2 method relies on two primary types of inputs that affect the calculation of methane emission factors 
from manure:   
Manure characteristics: Includes the amount of volatile solids (VS) produced in the manure and the maximum 
amount of methane able to be produced from that manure (B0). Production of manure VS can be estimated based 
on feed intake and digestibility, which are the variables also used to develop the Tier 2 enteric fermentation 
emission factors. Alternatively, VS production rates can be based on laboratory measurements of livestock manure. 
B0 varies by animal species and feed regime and is a theoretical methane yield based on the amount of VS in the 
manure.  Bedding materials (straw, sawdust, chippings, etc.) are not included in the VS modelled under the Tier 2 
method.  The type and use of these materials is highly variable from country to country.  Since they typically are 
associated with solid storage systems, their contribution would not add significantly to overall methane production. 
CH4 emissions from co-digestion of on-farm organic resources (crop residues,  energy crops) need to be reported 
under the source category ‚Äò3.A2(k) ‚Äì Co-digestates‚Äô. 
Animal waste management system characteristics (AWMS): Includes the types of systems used to manage 
manure and a system-specific methane conversion factor (MCF) that reflects the portion of Bo that is achieved. 
Regional assessments of manure management systems are used to estimate the portion of the manure that is 
handled with each manure management technique. A description of manure management systems is included in 
Table 10.18.  The system MCF varies with the manner in which the manure is managed and the climate. 
Theoretically the value can range from 0 to 100 percent. Both temperature and retention time play an important 
role in the calculation of the MCF. Manure that is managed as a liquid under warm conditions for an extended 
period of time promotes methane formation. These manure management conditions can have high MCFs of 76 to 
80 percent. Manure managed as dry material in cold climates does not readily produce methane, and consequently 
has an MCF of about 1 percent.  
Development of Tier 2 emission factors involves determining a weighted average MCF using the estimates of the 
manure managed by each waste system within each climate region. The average MCF is then multiplied by the 
VS excretion rate and the Bo for the livestock categories. In equation form, the estimate is as follows:

Even when the level of detail presented in the Tier 2 method is not possible in some countries, country-specific 
data elements such as animal mass, VS excretion, and others can be used to improve emission estimates. If country-
specific data are available for only a portion of these variables, countries are encouraged to calculate country-
specific emission factors, using the data available in Annex 10A.1 and 10A.2 to fill gaps.There is no defined 
threshold to indicate how much country-specific information is required for a Tier 2 method, but it is understood 
that increased use of country-specific information improves emission estimates, by better representing local 
production characteristics. 
Measurement programs can be used to improve the basis for making the estimates. In particular, measurements of 
emissions from manure management systems under field conditions are useful to verify MCFs. Also, 
measurements of B0 from livestock in tropical regions and for varying diet regimens are needed to expand the 
representativeness of the default factors. 
As emissions can vary significantly by region and livestock species/category, emission estimates should reflect as 
much as possible the diversity and range of animal populations and manure management practices between 
different regions within a country. This may require separate estimates to be developed for each region. Emission 
factors should be updated periodically to account for changes in manure characteristics and management practices. 
These revisions should be based on reliable scientifically reviewed data. Frequent monitoring is desirable to verify 
key model parameters and to track changing trends in the livestock industry. 
VS excretion rates 
Volatile solids (VS) are the organic material in livestock manure and consist of both biodegradable and non-
biodegradable fractions. The value needed for the Equation 10.24 is the total VS (both degradable and non-
biodegradable fractions) as excreted by each animal species since the Bo values are based on total VS entering the 
systems.  The best way to obtain average daily VS excretion rates is to use data from nationally published sources. 
If average daily VS excretion rates are not available, country-specific VS excretion rates can be estimated from 
feed intake levels. Feed intake for cattle and buffalo can be estimated using the ‚ÄòEnhanced‚Äô characterisation method 
described in Section 10.2. This will also ensure consistency in the data underlying the emissions estimates. For 
swine, country-specific swine production data may be required to estimate feed intake.  
The VS content of manure equals the fraction of the diet consumed that is not digested and thus excreted as fecal 
material which, when combined with urinary excretions, constitutes manure. Countries should estimate gross 
 
5 When biogas is produced in on-farm plants, emissions from on-farm co-digestates can be calculated separately using a similar 
equation: CH4(cdg)=Ccdg *B0*0.67*(MCF/100) and added to methane totals, where Ccdg is the total kg dry matter of the co-
digested material and other parameters are as defined in Equation 10.23

Once these are estimated, the VS excretion rate is estimated as:

livestock. 
Representative DE percent values for various livestock categories are provided in Section 10.2, Table 10.2 of this 
report.  The value for ash content fraction can range substantially between livestock types and should reflect 
national circumstances. 
B0 values 
The maximum methane-producing capacity of the manure (B0) varies by species and diet. The preferred method 
to obtain B0 measurement values is to use data from country-specific published sources, measured with a 
standardised method. It is important to standardise the B0 measurement, including the method of sampling, and to 
confirm if the value is based on total as-excreted VS or biodegradable VS, since the Tier 2 calculation is based on 
total as-excreted VS. If country-specific B0 measurement values are not available, default values are provided in 
Table 10.16 where data is summarized from Table 10A-4 through 10A-9 of 2006 IPCC Guidelines. 
MCFs 
MCFs are determined for a specific manure management system and represent the degree to which B0 is achieved. 
Default methane conversion factors (MCFs) are provided in Table 10.17 for different manure management 
systems. The amount of methane generated by a specific manure management system is affected by the amount of 
volatile solids, the extent of anaerobic conditions present, the temperature of the system, and the retention time of 
organic material in the system.  Default MCF values for liquid systems and lagoons presented in Table 10.17 
include the effect of longer retention times. 
Liquid-based systems are sensitive to temperature effects. Average annual MCF values for a specific system will 
largely be determined by the quantity of VS in the storage system during peak temperature periods (Balde et al. 
2016). Emissions increase exponentially with increasing temperatures. For this reason, monthly temperature 
variations in combination with timing of storage and application times largely define annual MCFs rather than 
average annual temperatures. 
Climate zones are used to differentiate variations in MCFs associated with ranges and annual monthly temperature 
variability. Detailed definitions of climate zones and a decision tree to determine in what climate zone a specific 
region falls, can be found in Annex 10A.2, Figure 10A.1. Inventory compilers should consult long-term averages 
from national meteorological statistics and evaluate the climate zones for each region of their country based on the 
criteria outlined in Annex 10A.2. It is good practice to assure consistency of the definition of climate zones for all 
sectors of the inventory that may be influenced by climate. 
Manure removal statistics should be taken from farm practice surveys or from expert consultation. Compilers 
should develop an estimate of the average number of manure removals per year and the months of the highest 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
 
10.66 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
frequency of removals. If regional practices vary, compilers should develop MCFs that are representative of 
regional practice by entering consistent manure removal statistics with regional temperature profiles. If regional 
MCFs are calculated, the national MCF should be weighted based on the number of animals feeding into the 
regional manure management systems represented by the manure removal profile and the regional temperature 
profile.  
In cases in which countries lie in multiple climate zones, it is good practice for compilers, if possible, to 
disaggregate livestock populations by climate zone. However, when it is not possible, compilers should select the 
dominant climate zone in their country or region.  
Further, in cases that countries have information available on their manure spreading practices (number of times 
that manure storages are emptied per year) and have monthly temperature profiles it is good practice that they 
customize MCF calculations based on their monthly temperature profiles according to the example provided in 
Annex 10A.2. If regional MCFs are calculated, the national MCF should be weighted based on the number of 
animals feeding into the regional manure management systems represented by the manure removal profile and the 
regional temperature profile. Global temperature data can be downloaded from a number of sites such as the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) website, long-term monthly averages should be used 
for the development of MCFs. 
Likewise, for cases in which manure is maintained in the animal housing, compilers may wish to calculate the 
MCF considering the temperature profile of the housing. An example of how to derive an MCF for a liquid system 
is provided in Annex 10A.3 and a simple spreadsheet model is available in the supplemental data supplied with 
this chapter. Please refer to "Raw data for cattle and buffalo spreadsheet".  
For manure deposited by grazing animals onto pastures, ranges and paddocks, it is recommended to use a value 
that is consistent with the emission factor provided in Table 10.14. In this table, a single emission factor per unit 
of volatile solid excretion is provided, as an analysis of 45 data points showed that there was no significant 
difference between climatic zones nor were there differences per animal category (Annex 10B.6). Therefore, the 
MCF reported in Table 10.17 must be used in conjunction with a single B0 value of 0.19 m3 CH4 kg-1 of VS 
excreted, derived from the experimental results described in Annex 10B.6. This single emission factor was judged 
by the expert panel to be more accurate than emission factors estimated from regionally based MCFs and animal 
category based B0, considering the differences in processes that would result in methane production between 
excretion of VS on pasture, range and paddock relative to typical manure storage systems. 
Anaerobic digestion is an important manure management technology that provides renewable energy through 
biogas production. There is a wide variety of digesters available of varyinig quality and use including industrial 
centralised biogas digester plants, and animal farm based biogas digesters. Some biogas digesters may co-digest 
energy crops and different types of organic waste in varying combinations. The quality of the digester and the pre- 
and post-storage of digester input and output (digestate) are the main factors in determining the methane that is 
lost to the atmosphere before, during and after digestion. 
Default methane conversion factors (MCFs) of anaerobic digesters are provided in Table 10.17. Default values for 
biogas digesters presented include the estimated MCF from combinations of either high and low quality anaerobic 
digetsers with different types and qualities of storage systems. The approach to calculate these MCFs, based on 
Haenel et al. (2018) is outlined in Annex 10A.4. The main factors considered in differentiating between digester 
systems are the degree of leakage from the digester itself (varying between 1 and 10 percent of the methane 
production potential B0) and the loss of CH4 from the digeste storage system. 
All manure management methane emission factors are based on experimental measurements that typically 
combine the VS and bedding. Based on current scientific literature, these two sources cannot be separated. More 
refined measurements of methane from manure storage and stages of storage are for further scientific development. 
These default values may not encompass the potentially wide variation within the defined categories of 
management systems. Therefore, country-specific MCFs that reflect the specific management systems used in 
particular countries or regions should be developed, if possible. This is particularly important for countries with 
large animal populations or with multiple climate regions. In such cases, and if possible, field measurements should 
be conducted for each climate region to replace the default MCF values. Measurements should include the 
following factors: 
‚Ä¢ Duration of storage and timing of application; 
‚Ä¢ Information on manure treatment and VS (including bedding) entering the storage system; 
‚Ä¢ Feed and animal characteristics at the measurement site (see Section 10.2 for the type of data that would be 
pertinent); 
‚Ä¢ Determination of the amount of manure left in the storage facility after emptying (methanogenic inoculum);

‚Ä¢ Monthly temperature in the storage.  
CH 4 emissions from multiple Manure Management systems  
If manure is managed in multiple systems, by default, manure emission factors should be allocated to the dominant 
storage systems; but a country specific emission factor could be developed considering the emissions originating 
from all systems used in storage prior to field applicaton.   
A number of combinations are possible and it is beyond the scope of these guidelines to provide guidance for all 
possibilities but common examples include: i.) manure flushed from a dairy freestall barn to an anaerobic lagoon 
that first pass through a solids separation unit where some of the manure nitrogen is removed and managed as a 
solid. In this case, the methodology must integrate an additional fraction to the AWMS system that tranfers those 
solids to a solid storage systems; ii.) pit storage that is flushed to a larger holding tank. In this case, the methodology 
must consider modifications to the B0  that result from the initial storage period based on the length of the storage 
and the temperature dependant MCF. iii.) solid manure pack that is allowed to accumulate, and periodically 
transferred to heaps. Likewise in this case, the impact of the prestorage period to the B0 of the manure in the 
secondary storage should be adjusted to consider the emissions that occurred during the initial storage. 
In cases in which country-specific methodologies are used to estimate emissions from multiple systems rely on 
B0s and MCFs as defined in Tables 10.16 and 10.17, these methodologies should assure that the total annual B0 of 
the stored manure is not reduced or increased during the application of the methodology. Further, methodologies 
that require additional fractionation of manure must assure that calculated VS input is not reduced or increased.

METHANE CONVERSION FACTORS FOR MANURE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS 
1 The initial judgement of IPCC Expert Group supported by additional new research. See Annex 10B.7 for additional details. Suggested default values are equivalent to liquid systems with 6 month retention time if retention 
times are unknown. A reduction of 40% due to crust cover may be applied only when a thick, dry, crust is present. Thick dry crusts occur in systems in which organic bedding is used in the barn and is allowed to be flushed 
into the liquid storage tank and solids are not separated from the manure stream and further the surface is not exposed to regular heavy precipitation that may disrupt the surface. Sources: Aguerre et al. (2012); Nielsen et al. 
(2013); VanderZaag et al. (2008). 
New information suggests that a solid cover reduces CH4 emissions by 25 to 50% (range: 0 to 90%). Sources: Amon et al. (2006), Amon et al. (2007); Clemens et al. (2006); Guarino et al. (2006), Matulaitis et al. (2015), 
Misselbrook et al. (2016), VanderZaag et al. (2009), Hou et al. (2015), VanderZaag et al. (2008). 
2 Pasture Range and Paddock MCFs must always be used in conjunction with a B0 value of 0.19 m3 CH4 kg-1 of VS excreted to maintain consistency with the data in the updated version of Cai et al. (2017) database (see 
Annex 10B.6). 
3 Definitions for manure management systems are provided in Table 10.18. 
4 Composting is the biological oxidation of a solid waste including manure usually with bedding or another organic carbon source typically at thermophilic temperatures due to microbial heat production. 
5 Articles from which these values were derived were for cattle and swine, but for other animal production systems that use deep bedding these values are proposed to be used as surrogates. Suggested default values are 
equivalent to liquid systems with 6 month retention time. 
6 Sources and assumptions to calculate MCF values for Solid storage categories and composting (static pile and passive windrows) are detailed in Annex 10B.7. 
7 Judgement of IPCC Expert Group utilizing a 12 month retention time and the equations and parameters presented in Mangino et al. (2001). Solid-liquid separation that removes VS and diverts it to aerobic/solid management 
should be considered when calculating the VS loading rate into liquid systems. 
8 The avg ¬∞C for Cool Temperate Moist, Cool Temperate Dry, Warm Temperate Moist, Warm Temperate Dry, Tropical Montane, Tropical Wet, Tropical Moist, Tropical Dry were 4.6, 5.8, 13.9, 14.0, 21.5, 25.9, 25.2, 
25.6 respectively. 
9 Solid-liquid separation that removes VS and diverts it to aerobic/solid management should be considered when calculating the VS loading rate into liquid systems. 
10 Judgement of IPCC 2006 Expert Group in combination with Mangino et al. (2001). Values are consistent with liquid systems.   Values presented here are consistent with a 6 month retention time, however compilers 
should take into account country-specific retention time when possible. 
11 Judgement of IPCC 2006 Expert Group in combination with Moller et al. (2004). Expect emissions to be similar, and possibly greater, than pit storage, depending on organic content and moisture content. 
12 Expert judgement based on IPCC (2006) and update supported by Pardo et al. (2015). Emissions in temperate climate can be double relative to a cool climate. 
13 Expert judgement based on  Pardo et al.,  (2015). Emissions in the same range than solid storage.

important to identify the next management process for the sludge and estimate the emissions from that management process if significant.

10.4.3 Choice of activity data 
There are two main types of activity data for estimating CH4 emissions from manure management: (1) animal 
population data; and (2) manure management system usage data. 
The animal population data should be obtained using the approach described in Section 10.2. As noted in Section 
10.2, it is good practice to conduct a single livestock characterisation that will provide the activity data for all 
emissions sources relying on livestock population data. It is important to note, however, that the level of 
disaggregation in the livestock population data required to estimate emissions from manure management, may 
differ from those used for other sources, such as Enteric Fermentation. For example, for some livestock population 
species/categories, such as cattle, the enhanced characterisation required for the Tier 2 enteric fermentation 
estimate could be aggregated to broader categories that are sufficient for this source category. For other livestock 
species, such as swine, it may be preferable to have more disaggregation of weight categories for manure 
management calculations than for enteric fermentation. However, consistency in livestock categories should be 
retained throughout the inventory. 
Inventory agencies in countries with varied climatic conditions are encouraged to obtain population data for each 
major climatic zone as defined in Volume 4, Chapter  3, Annex 3A.5, Figure 3A.5.1 or the version found in Annex 
10A.2 of this Chapter. This will allow more specific selection of default factors or MCF values for those systems 
more sensitive to temperature changes. Ideally, the regional population breakdown can be obtained from published 
national livestock statistics, and the temperature data from national meteorological statistics. If regional data are 
not available, experts should be consulted regarding regional production (e.g., milk, meat, and wool) patterns or 
land distribution, which may provide the required information to estimate the regional animal distributions. 
To implement the Tier 2 method, the portion of manure managed in each manure management system must also 
be collected for each representative animal species. Table 10.18 summarizes the main types of manure 
management systems. Quantitative data should be used to distinguish whether the system is judged to be a solid 
storage or liquid/slurry. The borderline between dry and liquid can be drawn at 15 percent dry matter content.  
Note that in some cases, manure may be managed in several types of manure management systems. For example, 
manure flushed from a dairy freestall barn to an anaerobic lagoon may first pass through a solids separation unit 
where some of the manure solids are removed and managed as a solid. Therefore, if manure is managed in  multiple 
systems, it is good practice to report the respective CH4 emissions from each system (see N2O emissions from 
multiple Manure Management systems). Manure removal statistics should also be monitored where possible.  It is 
recommended that agencies develop an estimate of the average number of manure removals per year and the 
months of the highest frequency of removals. If regional practices vary and also represent significant differences 
in temperature profiles, statistics that are representative of regional practice should be  tracked combining the 
appropriate manure removal statistics together with regional temperature profiles.  
The best means of obtaining manure management system distribution data is to consult regularly published 
national statistics. If such statistics are unavailable, the preferred alternative is to conduct an independent survey 
of manure management system usage. If the resources are not available to conduct a survey, experts should be 
consulted to obtain an opinion of the system distribution. Volume 1, Chapter 2 Approaches to Data Collection 
describes how to elicit expert judgement. Similar expert elicitation protocols can be used to obtain manure 
management system distribution data.

TABLE 10.18 (UPDATED) 
DEFINITIONS OF MANURE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS3 
System  
Definition 
Pasture/Range/Paddock 
(PRP) 
The manure from pasture and range grazing animals is allowed to lie as deposited, and is 
not managed. 
Daily spread 
Manure is routinely removed from a confinement facility and is applied to cropland or 
pasture within 24 hours of excretion. 
Solid storage 
The storage of manure, typically for a period of several months, in unconfined piles or 
stacks. Manure is able to be stacked due to the presence of a sufficient amount of bedding 
material or loss of moisture by evaporation. 
Solid stores can be covered or compacted. In some cases, bulking agent or additives are 
added. 
Solid storage-
Covered/compacted 
Similar to solid storage, but the manure pile is a) covered with a plastic sheet to reduce the 
surface of manure exposed to air and/or b) compacted to increase the density and reduce 
the free air space within the material. 
Solid storage - Bulking 
agent addition 
Specific materials (bulking agents) are mixed with the manure to provide structural 
support. This allows the natural aeration of the pile, thus enhancing decomposition (e.g. 
sawdust, straw, coffee husks, maize stover). 
Solid storage - Additives 
The addition of specific substances to the pile in order to reduce gaseous emissions. 
Addition of certain compounds such as attapulgite, dicyandiamide or mature compost have 
shown to reduce N2O emissions; while phosphogypsum reduces CH4 emissions. 
Dry lot 
A paved or unpaved open confinement area without any significant vegetative cover. Dry 
lots do not require the addition of bedding to control moisture. Manure may be removed 
periodically and spread on fields.   
Liquid/Slurry 1 
Manure is stored as excreted or with some minimal addition of water or bedding material 
in tanks or ponds outside the animal housing. Manure is removed and spread on fields once 
or more in a calendar year. Manure is agitated before removal from the tank/ponds  to 
ensure that most of the VS are removed from the tank.  
Uncovered anaerobic 
lagoon 
A type of liquid storage system designed and operated to combine waste stabilization and 
storage. Lagoons have a lower depth and a much larger surface compared to liquid slurry 
stores. Anaerobic lagoons are designed with varying lengths of storage (up to a year or 
greater), depending on the climate region, the volatile solids loading rate, and other 
operational factors. The supernatant water from the lagoon may be recycled as flush water 
or used to irrigate and fertilise fields. 
Pit storage below animal 
confinements 
Collection and storage of manure usually with little or no added water typically below a 
slatted floor in an enclosed animal confinement facility, usually for periods less than one 
year. Manure may be pumped out of the storage to a secondary storage tank multiple times 
in one year, or stored and applied directly to fields. It is assumed that VS removal rates on 
tank emptying are >90%.  
Anaerobic 
digester 
Digesters 
of high 
quality 
and low 
leakage 
Animal manure with and without straw is collected and anaerobically digested in a 
containment vessel. Co-digestion with other waste or energy crops may occur.  
Digesters are designed, constructed and operated according to industrial technology 
standard for waste stabilization by the microbial reduction of complex organic compounds 
to CO2 and CH4. 
Biogas is captured and used as a fuel.  
Digestate is stored either in open storage, in covered storage with no leakage control, or in 
gas tight storage with gas recovery or flaring. 
Digesters 
with high 
leakage 
Animal manure with and without straw is collected and anaerobically digested in covered 
lagoon.  
Digesters are used for waste stabilization by the microbial reduction of complex organic 
compounds to CO2 and CH4. 
Biogas is captured and flared or used as a fuel. 
After anaerobic digestion, digestate is stored either openly, covered, or gas tightly. 
Burned for fuel 
The dung and urine are excreted on fields. The sun dried dung cakes are burned for fuel.

DEFINITIONS OF MANURE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS 
System  
Definition 
Deep bedding 
As manure accumulates, bedding is continually added to absorb moisture over a 
production cycle and possibly for as long as 6 to 12 months. This manure management 
system also is known as a bedded pack manure management system and may be 
combined with a dry lot or pasture. Manure may undergo periods where animals are 
present and are actively mixing the manure, or periods in which the pack is undisturbed.  
Composting 
In-vessel2 
Composting, typically in an enclosed channel, with forced aeration and continuous 
mixing. 
Static pile 
Composting in piles with forced aeration but no mixing, with runoff/leaching 
containment. 
Composting in piles with forced aeration but no mixing, without runoff/leaching 
containment. 
Intensive 
windrow2 
Composting in windrows with regular (at least daily) turning for mixing and aeration, 
runoff/leaching containment. 
Composting in windrows with regular (at least daily) turning for mixing and aeration, no 
runoff/leaching containment. 
Composting 
- Passive 
windrow2 
Composting in windrows with infrequent turning for mixing and aeration, with 
runoff/leaching.  
Composting in windrows with infrequent turning for mixing and aeration, no 
runoff/leaching.  
Poultry manure with litter 
Similar to cattle and swine deep bedding except usually not combined with a dry lot or 
pasture. Typically used for all poultry breeder flocks, for alternative systems for layers 
and for the production of meat type chickens (broilers) and other fowl. Litter and manure 
are left in place with added bedding during the poultry production cycle and cleaned 
between poultry cycles, typically 5 to 9 weeks in productive systems and greater in lower 
productivity systems. 
Poultry manure without 
litter 
May be similar to open pits in enclosed animal confinement facilities or may be designed 
and operated to dry the manure as it accumulates. The latter is known as a high-rise 
manure management system and is a form of passive windrow composting when 
designed and operated properly. Some intensive poultry farms installed the manure belt  
under the cage, where the manure is dried inside housing. 
Aerobic treatment 
The biological oxidation of manure collected as a liquid with either forced or natural 
aeration. Natural aeration is limited to aerobic and facultative ponds and wetland systems 
and is due primarily to photosynthesis. Hence, these systems typically become anoxic 
during periods without sunlight. 
1  Covers on manure management systems can impact emissions of direct N2O, CH4 and NH3. With N2O and CH4 emission, the effect of 
the cover depends upon character of the cover material. 
2 Composting is the biological oxidation of a solid waste including manure usually with bedding or another organic carbon source typically 
at thermophilic temperatures produced by microbial heat production.

N2O 
EMISSIONS 
FROM 
MANURE 
MANAGEMENT 
This section describes how to estimate the N2O produced, directly and indirectly, during the storage and treatment 
of manure before it is applied to land or otherwise used for feed, fuel, or construction purposes. The approach is 
based on N excretion, emission factors for N2O emissions, as well as volatilization and leaching factors. This 
section also details the principles of N flow and the connection between IPCC N2O reporting and NH3 and NOx 
reporting required for UNECE countries.  
The term ‚Äòmanure‚Äô is used here collectively to include both dung and urine (i.e., the solids and the liquids) produced 
by livestock. The N2O emissions generated by manure in the system ‚Äòpasture, range, and paddock‚Äô occur directly 
and indirectly from the soil, and are therefore reported under the category ‚ÄòN2O Emissions from Managed Soils‚Äô 
(see Chapter 11, Section 11.2). Direct and indirect N2O emissions generated by manure managed in other systems 
and following its application to soils are also reported under the category ‚ÄòN2O Emissions from Managed Soils‚Äô 
(see Chapter 11, Section 11.2). The emissions associated with the burning of dung for fuel are to be reported under 
‚ÄòFuel Combustion‚Äô (see Volume 2: Energy), or under ‚ÄòWaste Combustion‚Äô (see Volume 5: Waste) if burned 
without energy recovery.   
Direct N2O emissions occur via combined nitrification and denitrification of nitrogen contained in the manure. 
The emission of N2O from manure during storage and treatment depends on the nitrogen and carbon content of 
manure, and on the duration of the storage and type of treatment. Nitrification (the oxidation of ammonia nitrogen 
to nitrate nitrogen) is a necessary prerequisite for the emission of N2O from stored animal manures. Nitrification 
is likely to occur in stored animal manures provided there is a sufficient supply of oxygen. Nitrification does not 
occur under anaerobic conditions. Nitrites and nitrates are transformed to N2O and dinitrogen (N2) during the 
naturally occurring process of denitrification, an anaerobic process.  There is general agreement in the scientific 
literature that the ratio of N2O to N2 increases with increasing acidity, nitrate concentration, and reduced moisture.  
In summary, the production and emission of N2O from managed manures requires the presence of either nitrites 
or nitrates in an anaerobic environment preceded by aerobic conditions necessary for the formation of these 
oxidized forms of nitrogen. In addition, conditions preventing reduction of N2O to N2, such as a low pH or limited 
moisture, must be present. 
Indirect emissions result from volatile nitrogen losses that occur primarily in the forms of ammonia and NOx. The 
fraction of excreted organic nitrogen that is mineralized to ammonium nitrogen during manure collection and 
storage depends primarily on oxygen supply, time, and on temperature. Simple forms of organic nitrogen such as 
urea (mammals) and uric acid (poultry) are rapidly mineralized to ammonium nitrogen, which is converted to 
ammonia under alkaline conditions. Ammonia is highly volatile and easily diffused into the surrounding air 
(Asman et al. 1998; Monteny & Erisman 1998). Nitrogen losses begin at the point of excretion in houses and other 
animal production areas (e.g., milk parlors) and continue through on-site management in storage and treatment 
systems (i.e., manure management systems). Nitrogen is also lost through runoff and leaching into soils from the 
solid storage of manure at outdoor areas, in feedlots and where animals are grazing in pastures.  Emissions of 
nitrogen compounds from grazing livestock are considered separately in Chapter 11, Section 11.2, N2O Emissions 
from Managed Soils. 
In the case of co-digestion of animal manures with additional organic residues, energy crops, additional N enters 
the system. This additional N source also emits N2O during the storage, and must be considered in the section 
‚ÄúN2O emissions from manure management‚Äù.  
Due to significant direct and indirect losses of manure nitrogen in management systems it is important to estimate 
the remaining amount of animal manure nitrogen available for application to soils or for use in feed, fuel, or 
construction purposes. This value is used for calculating N2O emissions from managed soils (see Chapter 11, 
Section 11.2). The methodology to estimate manure nitrogen that is directly applied to soils, or available for use 
in feed, fuel, or construction purposes is described in this chapter under Section 10.5.4 ‚ÄúCoordination with 
reporting for N2O emissions from managed soils". 
10.5.1 Choice of method 
The level of detail and methods chosen for estimating N2O emissions from manure management systems will 
depend upon national circumstances and the decision tree in Figure 10.4 describes good practice in choosing a 
method accordingly. The following sections describe the different tiers referenced in the decision tree for 
calculating direct and indirect N2O emissions from manure management systems. 
 
Direct N 2O emissions from Manure Management 
Chapter 10: Emissions from Livestock and Manure Management 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
10.75 
Tier 1 
The Tier 1 method entails multiplying the total amount of N excretion (from all livestock species/categories) in 
each type of manure management system by an emission factor for that type of manure management system (see 
Equation 10.25). Emissions are then summed over all manure management systems. The Tier 1 method is applied 
using IPCC default N2O emission factors, default nitrogen excretion data, and default manure management system 
data (see Annex 10A.2, Tables 10A.5 to 10A.9 for default animal weights and manure management system 
allocations). It is recommended to consult the methane and enteric fermentation sections to clarify how to 
implement the Tier 1a approach, if that is the approach selected.  
Tier 2 
A Tier 2 method follows the same calculation equation as Tier 1 but would include the use of country-specific data 
for some or all of these variables.  For example, the use of country-specific nitrogen excretion rates for livestock 
categories would constitute a Tier 2 methodology.   
Tier 3 
A Tier 3 method utilizes alternative estimation procedures based on a country-specific methodology.  For example, 
a process-based, mass balance approach which tracks nitrogen throughout the system in detail starting with feed 
input through final use/disposal could be utilized as a Tier 3 procedure.  Tier 3 methods should be well documented 
to clearly describe estimation procedures.  
To estimate emissions from manure management systems, the livestock population must first be divided into 
categories that reflect the varying amounts of manure produced per animal as well as the manner in which the 
manure is handled. This division of manure by type of system should be the same as that used to characterize 
methane emissions from manure management (see Section 10.4). For example, if Tier 1 default emission factors 
are used for calculating CH4 emissions, then the manure management systems usage data from Tables 10A.5 to 
10A.9 should be applied. Detailed information on how to characterise the livestock population for this source is 
provided in Section 10.2. 
In the case of anaerobic digestion of animal manures with additional organic residues it is essential to estimate the 
additional N input from these organic residues and the respective N2O emissions.  
The following five steps are used to estimate direct N2O emissions from Manure Management:  
Step 1: Collect population data from the Livestock Population Characterisation; 
Step 2: Use default values or develop the annual average nitrogen excretion rate per head (Nex(T,P)) for each 
defined livestock species/category T, and productivity system P, when applicable; 
Step 3: Use default values or determine the fraction of total annual nitrogen excretion for each livestock 
species/category T that is managed in each manure management system S (AWMS(T,S,P)); 
Step 4: Use default values or develop N2O emission factors for each manure management system S (EF3(S)); and 
Step 5: For each manure management system type S, multiply its emission factor (EF3(S)) by the total amount of 
nitrogen managed (from all livestock species/categories) in that system, to estimate N2O emissions from that 
manure management system. Then sum over all manure management systems. 
In some cases, manure nitrogen may be managed in several types of manure management systems. If manure is 
managed in multiple systems, it is good practice to estimate N2O emissions from all systems. 
The calculation of direct N2O emissions from manure management is based on the following equation:

As is the case in the calculation of methane emission, countries may choose to consider if they have significantly 
different production systems in their country and apply a Tier 1a approach. In this case, compilers should consider 
the productivity class of their animal system as included in the calculation of CH4 emissions.  
There may be losses of nitrogen in other forms (e.g., ammonia and NOx) as manure is managed on site. Nitrogen 
in the volatilized form of ammonia may be deposited at sites downwind from manure handling areas and contribute 
to indirect N2O emissions (see below). Countries are encouraged to consider using a mass balance approach  to 
track the manure nitrogen excreted, managed on site in manure management systems, and ultimately applied to 
managed soils.  The estimation of the amount of manure nitrogen which is directly applied to managed soils or 
otherwise available for use as feed, fuel or construction purposes is described in the Section 10.5.4 Coordination 
with reporting for N2O emissions from managed soils is required.  See Chapter 11, Section 11.2 for procedures to 
calculate N2O emissions from managed manure nitrogen applied to soils. Additional guidance on ensuring 
consistency in the mass balance approach and between emissions from manure in the source category N2O 
Emissions from Manure Management and N2O Emissions from Managed Soils is given in Section 10.5.6 in the 
subsection Consistency of nitrogen flows. 
Indirect N 2O emissions from Manure Management 
Tier 1 
The Tier 1 calculation of N volatilisation in forms of NH3 and NOx from manure management systems is based on 
multiplication of the amount of nitrogen excreted (from all livestock categories) and managed in each manure 
management system by a fraction of volatilised nitrogen (see Equation 10.26). N losses are then summed over all 
manure management systems.  The Tier 1 method is applied using default nitrogen excretion data, default manure 
management system data, animal weights (see Annex 10A.2, Tables 10A.5 to 10A.9) and default fractions of N 
loss from manure management systems (see Table 10.22):

The Tier 1 calculation of N leached and runoff from manure management systems is based on multiplication of 
the amount of nitrogen excreted (from all livestock categories) and managed in each manure management system 
by a fraction of nitrogen leached, in analogy to the approach to estimate nitrogen volatilsation (see Equation 10.26). 
There are limited measurement data on leaching and runoff losses from various manure management systems.  The 
greatest N losses due to runoff and leaching typically occur where animals are on a drylot, pens, in over-wintering 
areas or feeding pens used during dormant growth periods for pastured animals and manure heaps or composting 
systems, uncovered and uncontained. In drier climates, runoff losses are smaller than in high rainfall areas and 
have been estimated in the range from 3 to 6 percent of N excreted (Eghball & Power 1994). Studies by Bierman 
et al. (1999) found nitrogen lost in runoff was 5 to 19 percent of N excreted and 10 to 16 percent leached into soil, 
while other data show relatively low loss of nitrogen through leaching in solid storage (less than 5 percent of  N 
excreted); but greater loss could also occur (Rotz 2004). Table 10.22 contains leaching loss fractions that may be 
applied under very specific circumstances. Leaching can be estimated using these fractions in cases in which 
manure is uncovered on permeable soil, or where runoff may occur to permeable soil and runoff is not collected 
in a impermeable basin and redistributed to agricultural fields. Leaching losses are estimated only in cases in which 
manure nitrogen is being lost to the environment and not accounted for in any other N flows. Further research is 
needed in this area to improve the estimated losses and the conditions and practices under which such losses occur 
however an estimate may be provided.

Tier 2 
Countries may wish to develop a Tier 2 methodology for better consideration of national circumstances and to 
reduce uncertainty of estimates as much as possible. As for direct N2O emission from manure management, a Tier 
2 method would follow the same calculation equation as Tier 1 but include the use of country-specific data for 
some or all of variables.  For example, the use of country-specific nitrogen excretion rates for livestock categories 
would constitute a Tier 2 method.  Tier 2 method would require more detailed characterisation of the flow of 
nitrogen throughout the animal housing and manure management systems used in the country.  It is good practice 
to check N balance in a Tier 2 approach. Double counting of emissions associated with the application of managed 
manure should be avoided, as well as manure associated with pasture and grazing operations as described in 
Section 10.5.6.  National NH3 emission inventories developed by some countries could be used for Tier 2

estimation of NH3 volatilisation from manure management systems. For countries reporting emissions of NH3 and 
NOx to the UN-ECE Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution (UN-ECE LRTAP) using a Tier 2 
approach as described in the EEA (2016) emission inventory guidebook, it is good practice to report

Tier 3 
To reduce uncertainty of the estimates, a Tier 3 method could be developed using advanced or process-based 
models for volatilisation and nitrogen leaching and runoff based on actual measurements. 
All losses of N through manure management systems (both direct and indirect) need to be subtracted from the 
amount of manure N that is available for application to soils and which is reported in Chapter 11, Section 11.2 
N2O Emissions from Managed Soils. Refer to Section 10.5.4, Coordination with reporting for N2O emissions from 
managed soils, for guidance on calculating total N losses from manure management systems. 
10.5.2  Choice of emission factors 
Annual average nitrogen excretion rates, Nex ( T ) 
Tier 1 
Annual nitrogen excretion rates should be determined for each livestock category defined by the livestock 
population characterization.  Country-specific rates may either be taken directly from documents or reports such 
as agricultural industry and scientific literature or derived from information on animal nitrogen intake and retention 
(as explained below). In some situations, it may be appropriate to use excretion rates developed by other countries 
that have livestock with similar characteristics.  
If country-specific data cannot be collected or derived, or appropriate data are not available from another country, 
the IPCC default nitrogen excretion rates presented in Table 10.19 can be used. These rates are presented in units 
of nitrogen excreted per 1000 kg of animal per day. These rates can be applied to livestock sub-categories of 
varying ages and growth stages using a typical average animal mass (TAM) for that population sub-category, as 
shown in Equation 10.30.

Default TAM values are provided in Annex 10A.1, Table 10A.5. However, it is preferable to collect country-
specific TAM values due to the sensitivity of nitrogen excretion rates to different weight categories.  For example, 
market swine may vary from nursery pigs weighing less than 30 kilograms to finished pigs that weigh over 90 
kilograms. By constructing animal population groups that reflect the various growth stages of market pigs, 
countries will be better able to estimate the total nitrogen excreted by their swine population. 
When estimating the Nex(T) for animals whose manure is classified in the manure management system burned for 
fuel (Table 10.21), it should be kept in mind that the dung is burned, and the urine stays in the field. Generally, 50 
percent of the nitrogen excreted is in the dung and 50 percent is in the urine. If the burned dung is used as fuel, 
then emissions are reported under the IPCC category Fuel Combustion (Volume 2: Energy), whereas if the dung 
is burned without energy recovery the emissions should be reported under the IPCC category Waste Incineration 
(Volume 5: Waste).

The annual amount of N excreted by each livestock species/category depends on the total annual N intake and total 
annual N retention of the animal. Therefore, N excretion rates can be derived from N intake and N retention data. 
Annual N intake (i.e., the amount of N consumed by the animal annually) depends on the annual amount of feed 
digested by the animal, and the protein content of that feed. Total feed intake depends on the production level of 
the animal (e.g., growth rate, milk production, draft power). Annual N retention (i.e., the fraction of N intake that 
is retained by the animal for the production of meat, milk, or wool) is a measure of the animal's efficiency of 
production of animal protein from feed protein. Nitrogen intake and retention data for specific livestock 
species/categories may be available from national statistics or from animal nutrition specialists. Nitrogen intake 
can also be calculated from data on feed and crude protein intake developed in Section 10.2.  Default N retention 
values are provided in Table 10.20, Default values for the fraction of nitrogen in feed taken in by animals that is 
retained by the different animal species/categories. Rates of annual N excretion for each livestock species/category 
(Nex(T)) are derived as follows:

nitrogen excretion may be calculated based on the same dietary assumptions used in modelling enteric fermentation 
emissions (see Section 10.2). The amount of nitrogen excreted by cattle can be estimated as the difference between 
the total nitrogen taken in by the animal and the total nitrogen retained for growth and milk production. Equations 
10.32, 10.32A and 10.33, 10.33A, 10.33B, 10.33C, 10.33D and 10.33E can be used to calculate the variables for 
nitrogen intake and nitrogen retained for use in Equations 10.31 and 10.31a.  The daily nitrogen intake rate is 
derived as follows: 
 
6 Consideration should be taken of periods between production cycles, particularly for animal categories that may have multiple 
annual growth cycles. For livestock species with a lifetime shorter than one year, the approach suggested by Haenel et al. 
(2018) (see chapters 3.1.2.2.1 to 3.1.2.2.3) and by R√∂semann et al. (2017) can be considered.

As an example, the intake of N for a growing pig between 32 to 60 kg of body weight with a daily intake of 1.67 
kg of a diet containing 18 percent CP would be, applying the above equation, equivalent to 0.05 kg N day-1. 
The daily value can be converted to a total N input per year or per growth stage by multiplying either by 365 or 
by the length of the growth period of interest.

11 The IPCC expert group reviewed the national inventory submissions under the UNFCCC and concluded that common distribution of systems used to manage manure as follows: 80 percent of ostrich‚Äômanure is  deposited in 
pasture and in range  and 20 percent is managed in solid based systems; deer and reindeer manure deposited  mainly in pasture and in range, manure of rabbits and fur-bearing animals is managed mostly in a solid based 
systems. Hence, countries may apply the same allocation of MMS in the calculation of N2O emissions from manure stored in manure management systems. However, countries are encouraged to develop a country-specific 
dataset on MMS used to manage manure generated by these categories of animals.  
12 The values are taken from Table 10.19 of Chapter 10 of Volume 4 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.

Tier 2 method for estimating nitrogen excretion for pigs 
The nitrogen excretion rate depends on the balance between the animal‚Äôs feed N intake and its N retention in tissue. 
Different categories of animals (e.g. adult females, adult males and growing pigs) can have quite different N

requirements depending on, for example, their growth rates, lactation rates and yields (MacLeod et al. 2013). 
Likewise, the N retention rates can be different among different animal categories. Thus, when following a Tier 2 
approach for estimating nitrogen excretion for pigs, it is a good practice to include N excretion estimates for at 
least the pig categories listed in Table 10.1. 
For breeding pigs, if inventory compilers have detailed information about feed, breeding statistics piglets born and 
weaned and proportions of sows entering the breeding herd (optional), N retention may be calculated as follows:

a For this example, a live weight change of young sows from parturition to parturition of 12.5 kg was assumed. 
The value of Skg is derived from national statistics on the average litter size and birth weight of piglets, factors 
that vary based on national production systems.  Further, gilts will typically be mated at 125 ‚Äì 140 kg of body 
weight, and continue to grow over several reproductive cycles to a mature weight of approximately 200 kg of body 
weight. The N excretion by breeding sows (Equation 10.33B) should also take into account that the sow will gain 
between 10 to 15 kg of body weight during the first four or five reproductive cycles (Chiba 2009). Inventory 
compilers are advised to: (a) use data that best describe their country production practices and/or genetic stocks 
employed for estimates of litter size and birth weight; (b) estimate the proportion of the breeding animals that are 
not at mature weight and consider the growth of these animals in their estimate of Skg. The weight of the placenta 
and other products of conception are not included in Tier 2 calculations as they are discarded at parturition. 
Countries that are able to track nitrogen in conception products may choose to do so through country specific 
methods 
The daily N retention can be calculated by dividing the result of equation 10.33a by the total number of days in 
the gestational and weaning periods to provide a daily N retention in kg N day-1. Nitrogen excretion is calculated 
using Equation 10.31a, Option 2. 
For estimating N retention by growing animals, the following approach may be followed:

These should be summed over the different production stages7. Daily N retention is calculated by dividing the total 
N retention by the length of the production period from weaning to slaughter. Nitrogen excretion is calculated 
using Equation 10.31a, Option 2. 
 
 
7 It should be noted that factors other than physiological stage can affect nitrogen retention, including body weight (Pettey et 
al. 2015), sex and genetic line (Wiseman et al. 2007).

The approach used for estimating N excretion from growing pigs can be followed for gilts and growing boars that 
will be used for breeding purposes and for nursery, growing and finishing market pigs.  
Tier 2 method for estimating nitrogen excretion for poultry 
In broiler production, chicks generally cannot digest and absorb all nutrients, especially in the case of nutritional 
imbalance or high concentration of nutrients in feed. Thus, the surplus nutrients are broken down, and carbon is 
used to produce energy whereas nitrogen is excreted in faeces (Boonsinchai et al. 2016). Different categories of 
animals (for meat or eggs) can have quite different N requirements and different N retention rates (Poulsen & 
Kristensen 1998; Williams 2013; Velthof et al. 2015). Thus, when following a Tier 2 approach for estimating 
nitrogen excretion for poultry, it is a good practice to include N excretion estimations for at least the poultry 
categories listed in Table 10.1. 
In estimating nitrogen excretion, the nitrogen balance approach is also very useful, for which information on feed 
intake, feed N content and animal productivity (egg production, weight gain, lengths of production stages) is 
required. 
A suitable approach to estimate annual nitrogen retention by layer type hens is as follows (Poulsen & Kristensen

Nitrogen excretion is calculated using Equation 10.31a, Option 2. 
Emission factors for direct N 2O emissions from Manure Management 
The best estimate will be obtained using country-specific emission factors that have been fully documented in peer 
reviewed publications. It is good practice to use country-specific emission factors that reflect the actual duration 
of storage and type of treatment of animal manure in each management system that is used. Good practice in the 
derivation of country-specific emission factors involves the measurement of emissions (per unit of manure N) 
from different management systems, taking into account variability in duration of storage and types of treatment. 
When defining types of treatment, conditions such as aeration and temperature should be taken into account. If 
inventory agencies use country-specific emission factors, they are encouraged to provide justification for these 
values via peer-reviewed documentation.  
If appropriate country-specific emission factors are unavailable, inventory agencies are encouraged to use the 
default emission factors presented in Table 10.21, Default emission factors for direct N2O emissions from Manure 
Management. This table contains default emission factors by manure management system. Note that emissions 
from liquid/slurry systems without a natural crust cover and anaerobic lagoons are considered negligible based on 
the absence of oxidized forms of nitrogen entering these systems combined with the low potential for nitrification 
and denitrification to occur in the system. 
Emission factors for indirect N 2O emissions from Manure Management 
In order to estimate indirect N2O emissions from Manure Management, two fractions of nitrogen losses (due to 
volatilization, FracGasMS, and leaching/runoff, FracLeachMS), and two indirect N2O emissions factors associated with 
these losses (EF4 and EF5) are needed.  Default values for volatilization N losses are presented in the Table 10.22 
for single manure systems. Values represent the sum of the loss rates for N in the forms of NH3 and NOx, with 
most of the loss in the form of NH3.  Ranges reflect values that appear in the literature. The values represent 
conditions without any significant nitrogen control measures in place. Countries are encouraged to develop 
country-specific values, particularly related to ammonia losses where component emissions may be well 
characterized as part of larger air quality assessments and where emissions may be affected by nitrogen reduction 
strategies. For example, detailed methodologies for estimating NH3 and other nitrogen losses using mass 
balance/mass flow procedures are described in the EMEP/CORINAIR air pollutant emission inventory guidebook, 
Chapter 3B (current version: EEA 2016).   
The fraction of manure nitrogen that leaches from manure management systems (FracleachMS) is highly uncertain 
and should be developed as a country-specific value applied in Tier 2 method. 
N 2O emissions from multiple Manure Management systems 
Consistent with CH4 manure management, if manure is managed in multiple systems, by default, manure emission 
factors should be allocated to the dominant storage systems; But a country specific emission factor could be 
developed considering the emissions originating from all other systems used in storage prior to field applicaton.  
A number of combinations are possible and as was the case with methane emissions from manure management, it 
is beyond the scope of these guidelines to provide guidance for all possibilities but common examples include: i.) 
manure flushed from a dairy freestall barn to an anaerobic lagoon that first pass through a solids separation unit 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
10.90 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
where some of the manure nitrogen is removed and managed as a solid; ii.) pit storage that is flushed to a larger 
holding tank;  iii.) solid manure pack that is allowed to accumulate, and periodically transferred to heaps.  
In these cases, emissions could be calculated based on Tier 2 factors from the separate manure fractions and 
weighted based on the duration of storage in the different systems.  Emission factors as developed and reported in 
these guidelines are assumed to be for a full year of N within a given manure management system. The application 
of a country-specific, staged emission factor would require estimates of sub-annual emissions based on manure 
residency times in each stage. Further, this type of approach should consider the application of a full mass balance 
approach and likewise consider N loss at each stage. 
Default values for EF4 (N volatilisation and re-deposition) and EF5 (N leaching/runoff) are given in Chapter 11, 
Table 11.3 (Default emission, volatilisation and leaching factors for indirect soil N2O emissions). 
Consistency should be maintained for the treatment of nitrogen flows throughout all agricultural emission 
calculations, including managed soils as outlined in Section 10.5.48. 
 
 
8 As discussed in Section 10.5.4, N losses from housing and storage have to be subtracted before the calculation of N2O 
emissions (direct and indirect) from agricultural soils.

10.5.4 Coordination with reporting for N2O emissions from 
managed soils 
Following storage or treatment in any system of manure management, nearly all the manure will be applied to 
land. The emissions that subsequently arise from the application of the manure to soil are to be reported under the 
category N2O emissions from managed soils. The methods for estimating these emissions are discussed in Chapter 
11, Section 11.2. In estimating N2O emissions from managed soils, the amount of animal manure nitrogen that is 
directly applied to soils, or available for use in feed, fuel, or construction purposes, are considered. 
A significant proportion of the total nitrogen excreted by animals in managed systems (i.e., all livestock except 
those in pasture and grazing conditions) is lost prior to final application to managed soils or use as feed, fuel, or 
for construction purposes.  In order to estimate the amount of animal manure nitrogen that is directly applied to 
soils, or available for use in feed, fuel, or construction purposes (i.e., the value which is used in Chapter 11, 
Equation 11.1 or 11.2), it is necessary to reduce the total amount of nitrogen excreted by animals in managed 
systems by the losses of N through volatilisation of reactive nitrogen gases (i.e., NH3 and NOx) or through leaching 
and runoff (both leading to indirect emissions of N2O), direct conversion to N2O, or losses as inert molecular 
nitrogen (N2). 
nitrogen in manure is present both as organic nitrogen (Norg) and mineral nitrogen, of which the majority consists 
of  ‚ÄòTotal Ammoniacal nitrogen‚Äô (TAN). The sum of Norg and TAN gives the total nitrogen available (Ntot). 
Volatilization of NH3 and other forms of gaseous N arise from the mineral fraction of nitrogen in manure, TAN. 
Organic nitrogen in manure needs first to be converted to TAN before NH3 volatilization can happen. The 
EMEP/EEA air pollutant emission inventory Guidebook 2016 (EEA 2016, Chapter 3B) therefore distinguishes the 
flow of TAN and Norg and the transitions between the two forms in agricultural systems. The values for the 
volatilisation fraction FracGASMS listed in Table 10.22 attempt to account for typical TAN contents in manure for 
the MMS considered. However, different excretion ratios of TAN vs. total N as a consequence of changes in 
livestock diets are not reflected. Also, information on the TAN content in manure available for application, 
ùëÅùëÅùëÄùëÄùëÄùëÄùëÄùëÄ_ùê¥ùê¥ùë£ùë£ùê¥ùê¥, is not kept if using Equation 10.34. Farming practices that reduce the escape of NH3 from MMS but not 
the amount of TAN available are likely to lead to higher NH3 volatilization rates once the manure is applied to 
soils or used for feed, fuel, or for construction purposes.  
Where organic forms of bedding material (straw, sawdust, chippings, etc.) are used, the additional nitrogen from 
the bedding material should also be considered as part of the managed manure N applied to soils. The same applies 
to additional N input from co-digestates during anaerobic digestion. Bedding is typically collected with the 
remaining manure and applied to soils. It should be noted, however, that since mineralization of nitrogen 
compounds in beddings occurs more slowly compared to manure and the concentration of ammonia fraction in 
organic beddings is negligible, both volatilization and leaching losses during storage of bedding are assumed to be 
zero. If bedding material comes from crop residues, the amount of nitrogen needs to be considered when 
calculating N2O emissions from crop residues from managed soils by accounting for this quantity in FracRemove(T) 
in Equation 11.6 of Chapter 11. Further codigestates in the production of biogas may include food waste as well 
as purpose grown crops. Differences in N loss that might occur with crop residue being digested or being returned 
directly to the fields should be considered in this case. 
The estimate of managed manure nitrogen available for application to managed soils, or available for use in feed, 
fuel, or construction purposes is based on the following equation:

Bedding materials vary greatly and inventory compilers should develop values for NbeddingMS based on the 
characteristics of bedding material used in their livestock industries. Limited data from scientific literature 
indicates the amount of nitrogen contained in organic bedding material applied for dairy cows and heifers is usually 
around 7 kg N animal-1 yr-1, for other cattle is 4 kg N animal-1 yr-1, for market and breeding swine is around 0.8 
and 5.5 kg N animal-1 yr-1, respectively. For deep bedding systems, the amount of N in litter is approximately 
double these amounts (Webb 2001; D√∂hler et al. 2002). 
As regards NbeddingMS a cross check with the categories "3.C.4 - Direct N2O emissions from managed soils‚Äù (FCR - 
volume 11, chapter 11, section 11.2.1.3), "3.C.1 - Biomass burning" (volume 4, chapter 5, section 5.2.4 Non-CO2 
greenhouse gas emissions from biomass burning) and "4.C.2 - Open burning of waste" (volume 5, chapter 5, 
section 5.3.2 Amount of waste open-burned) relative to the amount of agricultural residues that is removed for 
other purposes (i.e. bedding) other than the amount of agricultural residues returned to soils or burnt should be 
done. This is important to eliminate the possibility of double counting. 
nitrogen content of co-digestates should be consistent in quantity and definition with the co-digests defined 
information in guidance on the use of co-digestates in ‚ÄúEnergy‚Äù found in Volume 2, Chapter 2, Section 2.3.3.4 
and ‚ÄúWaste‚Äù, Volume 5, Chapters 2 and 3, Sections 2.3.2 and 3.2. 
Table 10.22 presents default values for nitrogen loss due to volatilisation of NH3 and NOx and N leaching and run-
off of nitrogen from manure management.  
Table 10.23 presents default values for total losses of N2 from manure management systems relative to emissions 
of N2O. This ratio is used in combination with Equation 10.34b to calculate default N2 emission factors. These 
default values include losses that occur from the point of excretion, including animal housing losses, manure 
storage losses, and losses from leaching and runoff at the manure storage system where applicable. 
Countries may wish to develop an alternative approach for better consideration of national circumstances and to 
reduce the uncertainty of estimates as much as possible. This approach would entail more detailed characterisation 
of the flow of nitrogen through the components of the animal housing and manure management systems used in 
the country,  accounting for any mitigation activity (e.g., the use of covers over slurry tanks), and consideration of 
local practices, such as type of bedding material used. For Tier 2 or Tier 3 approaches it is good practice to account 
for the TAN fraction in total manure N along the different stages of manure management. Additional details are 
available in the EMEP/EEA air pollutant emission inventory Guidebook 2016 (EEA 2016, Chapter 3B and 3.D 
and Annex A1.4).

Source: The values are mainly from 2006 IPCC Guidelines but other sources and analyses are discussed in Annex B.7. Values in italics are not derived specifically from literature but are taken from the most likely 
surrogate among the existing values and are for that reason prone to greater uncertainty.  
1 N loss due to volatilisation of NH3+NOx fraction of total N excreted. 
2 N loss due to leaching, fraction of total N excreted. 
3 Nitrogen losses from digestate storage strongly depend on the digestate composition and on the storage cover. Digestate with a low dry matter content and no cover can loose up to 0.5 of nitrogen. The lower range of 
0.05 losses is valid for digestate with a high dry matter content and a cover. The ranges indicated also apply to co-digestates. It is advised to use the liquid slurry without cover for uncovered digestate.  
4 Uncertainty range is 0 to 0.07. Leaching values are dependant on annual rainfall. Country-specific data should be developed if leaching is observed to be a significant source based on default values and in humid 
climates should use the upper bound. 
5 Leaching is only included in the case of uncovered manure without confinement of runoff in which N is lost to the environment and therefore lost from the overall reactive N balance. 
6 No data indicates that no literature values were found, nor was there adequate certainty in providing a surrogate value. Country specific values should be used, or a surrogate should be selected from the table and 
justified based on consideration of factors  controlling rates of volatilisation in the management system. 
7 Sources and assumptions to calculate NH3 volatilization and N leaching/run-off for Solid storage and composting (static pile and passive windrows) systems are detailed in Annex 10B.7.

10.5.6 Completeness, Time series, Quality assurance/Quality 
control and Reporting 
A complete inventory should estimate N2O emissions from all systems of manure management for all livestock 
species/categories. Additional N input from organic residues and/or energy crops used for co-digestion in biogas 
plants must also be considered. Countries are encouraged to use manure management system definitions that are 
consistent with those presented in Table 10.18. Population data should be cross-checked between main reporting 
mechanisms (such as FAO and national agricultural statistics databases) to ensure that information used in the 
inventory is complete and consistent. Because of the widespread availability of the FAO database of livestock 
information, most countries should be able to prepare, at a minimum, Tier 1 estimates for the major livestock 
categories. For more information regarding the completeness of livestock characterisation, see Section 10.2. 
Developing a consistent time series of emission estimates for this source category requires, at a minimum, the 
collection of an internally consistent time series of livestock population statistics. General guidance on the 
development of a consistent time series is addressed in Volume 1, Chapter 5 of this report.  
In most countries, the other two activity data sets required for this source category (i.e., N excretion rates and 
manure management system usage data), as well as the manure management emission factors, will be kept constant 
for the entire time series. However, in some cases, there may be reasons to modify these values over time. For 
example, farmers may alter livestock feeding practices which could affect nitrogen excretion rates.  A particular 
system of manure management may change due to operational practices or new technologies such that a revised 
emission factor is warranted. These changes in practices may be due to the implementation of explicit greenhouse 
gas mitigation measures, or may be due to changing agricultural practices without regard to greenhouse gases. 
Regardless of the driver of change, the parameters and emission factors used to estimate emissions must reflect 
the change. The inventory text should thoroughly explain how the change in farm practices or implementation of 
mitigation measures has affected the time series of activity data or emission factors.  
It is good practice to implement general quality control checks as outlined in Volume 1, Chapter 6, Quality 
Assurance/Quality Control and Verification, and expert review of the emission estimates. Additional quality 
control checks and quality assurance procedures may also be applicable, particularly if higher tier methods are 
used to determine emissions from this source. The general QA/QC related to data processing, handling, and 
reporting should be supplemented with procedures discussed below: 
Activity data check 
The inventory agency should review livestock data collection methods, in particular checking that livestock 
subspecies data were collected and aggregated correctly with consideration for the duration of production cycles. 
The data should be cross-checked with previous years to ensure the data are reasonable and consistent with the 
expected trend. Inventory agencies should document data collection methods, identify potential areas of bias, and 
evaluate the representativeness of the data. 
Manure management system allocation should be reviewed on a regular basis to determine if changes in the 
livestock industry are being captured. Conversion from one type of management system to another, and technical 
modifications to system configuration and performance, should be captured in the system modelling for the 
affected livestock.  
National agricultural policy and regulations may have an effect on parameters that are used to calculate manure 
emissions, and should be reviewed regularly to determine what impact they may have. For example, guidelines to 
reduce manure runoff into water bodies may cause a change in management practices, and thus affect the N 
distribution for a particular livestock category. Consistency should be maintained between the inventory and 
ongoing changes in agricultural practices.

2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
If using country-specific data for Nex(T) and MS(T,S), the inventory agency should compare these values to the 
IPCC default values. Significant differences, data sources, and methods of data derivation, should be documented. 
The nitrogen excretion rates, whether default or country-specific values, should be consistent with feed intake data 
as determined through animal nutrition analyses. 
Review of emission factors 
The inventory agency should evaluate how well the implied N2O emission factors and nitrogen excretion rates 
compare with alternative national data sources and with data from other countries with similar livestock practices. 
Significant differences should be investigated. 
If using country-specific emission factors, the inventory agency should compare them to the default factors and 
note differences. The development of country-specific emission factors should be explained and documented, and 
the results peer-reviewed by independent experts.  
Whenever possible, available measurement data, even if they represent only a small sample of systems, should be 
reviewed relative to assumptions for N2O emission estimates. Representative measurement data may provide 
insights into how well current assumptions predict N2O production from manure management systems in the 
inventory area, and how certain factors (e.g., feed intake, system configuration, retention time) are affecting 
emissions. Because of the relatively small amount of measurement data available for these systems worldwide, 
any new results can improve the understanding of these emissions and possibly their prediction.  
External review 
The inventory agency should utilise experts in manure management and animal nutrition to conduct expert peer 
review of the methods and data used. While these experts may not be familiar with greenhouse gas emissions, their 
knowledge of key input parameters to the emission calculation can aid in the overall verification of the emissions. 
For example, animal nutritionists can evaluate N production rates to see if they are consistent with feed utilization 
research for certain livestock species. Practicing farmers can provide insights into actual manure management 
techniques, such as storage times and mixed-system usage. Wherever possible, these experts should be completely 
independent of the inventory process in order to allow a true external review. 
It is good practice to document and archive all information required to produce the national emissions inventory 
estimates as outlined in Volume 1, Chapter 6, Quality Assurance/Quality Control and Verification. When country-
specific emission factors, fractions of N losses, N excretion rates, or manure management system usage data have 
been used, the derivation of or references for these data should be clearly documented and reported along with the 
inventory results under the appropriate IPCC source category.  
N2O emissions from different types of manure management systems have to be reported according to categories 
in Table 10.18. N2O emissions from all types of manure management systems are to be reported under Manure 
Management, with two exceptions: 
‚Ä¢ Emissions from the manure management system for pasture, range, and paddock are to be reported under the 
IPCC source category N2O emissions from managed soils because this manure is deposited directly on soils 
by the livestock. 
‚Ä¢ Emissions from the manure management system burned for fuel, are to be reported under the IPCC category 
Fuel Combustion if the dung is used as fuel and under the IPCC category Waste Incineration if the dung is 
burned without energy recovery. It should be noted, however, if the urine nitrogen is not collected for burning 
it must be reported under N2O emissions from pasture, range, and paddock animal if deposited by grazing 
animals, or under manure management if collected in housed systems. 
Consistency of nitrogen flows: 
As discussed in Section 10.5.4, most of the manure excreted by livestock is finally applied to land or deposited to 
land by grazing animals, causing direct and indirect N2O emissions from managed soils. On its way from the 
animal to uptake by crops or the release of N2O, losses of nitrogen happen at all stages and in different forms. With 
anaerobic digestion, additional N might enter the system through co-digestates (e.g. organic residues, energy 
crops). The equations given in Chapters 10 and 11 follow a nitrogen balance approach, but are not capturing all 
effects on direct and indirect N2O emissions that might occur as a consequence of ‚Äòupstream‚Äô changes of nitrogen 
flow, such as manure covers, changes in animal feeding, or nitrogen application technique, some of which are 
discussed in Section 10.5.4. It is also important to consider total N2O emissions (see Equation 10.A4-1) when 
making a key source assessment. 
The inventory agency should consult with experts to make sure that any potential effects on N2O emissions are 
reflected in the total N2O emission estimates. Annex 10A.5 lists a set of equations derived from relevant equations 
in Chapter 10 and 11, allowing the calculation of all direct and indirect N2O emissions per livestock 
species/category. These equations can help identifying emissions estimates that might become inaccurate when 
 
Chapter 10: Emissions from Livestock and Manure Management 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
10.101 
national methodologies for upstream flows are used. For example, Equation 10A.13-10A.16 and Equations 11.2-
11.4 show that direct N2O emissions from soils depend on the amount of manure N available for application, not 
considering any NH3 losses that might change the amount of N available for N2O formation. So any application 
technique that reduces or increases losses of NH3, modifies the ratio of inorganic to organic N and increases or 
decreases the availability of N that can be transformed to N2O must be carefully evaluated (see also Chapter 11, 
Sections 11.2.1.1 and 11.2.2.1). In this case, methodologies may want to consider, a correction factor that is 
consistent with the national method for NH3 emissions and takes into account the forms of nitrogen that are stored, 
transferred and lost during these processes.  
An illustration of N flows through animal and crop production systems is given in Figure 10.5. The figure follows 
the flow of nitrogen, starting from excretion of nitrogen by animals through livestock and crop production systems 
down to direct or indirect emissions of N2O. For each flow shown in Figure 10.5, reference is made to the 
respective equation in Chapter 10 Emissions from livestock and manure management and Chapter 11 N2O 
emissions from managed soils, and CO2 emissions from lime and urea application. Losses to the environment are 
shown with broken arrows and indicate the emission factor or loss fraction to be used. Nitrogen input from bedding 
material and co-digestates enter the system and become part of the N available for application or for other uses. 
Symbols are defined under the equations in Chapter 10 and 11 and in Annex 10A.5 of Chapter 10. In this Figure 
all flows denoted with N  are averaged annual N flows per head of livestock species/category [kg N animal-1 yr-1] 
or annual N input via co-digestates [kg N yr-1]; symbols denoted with Frac are fractions in [kg N (kg N)-1]; symbols 
denoted with EF are N2O emission factors in [kg N2O ‚ÄìN (kg N)-1]. X: different EF3 are used for cattle, pig and 
poultry (X=CPP) and for sheep and other animals (X=SO). Y: different EF1 are used for flooded rice fields (Y=FR) 
and for other fields (no index Y used). 
Broken arrows indicate flows that are split into an emission pathway and a flow of N in the agricultural system. 
Note that for N deposited by grazing animals or N applied to managed soils, the flow of N is a sequence of 
processes with first volatilization of NH3+NOx and only thereafter emissions of N2O and N leaching. This is not 
reflected in the equations proposed for Tier 1 methodology.

1 The value represent milk yield in kg per day during the whole year. 
2 Ym values are consist with those reported in Table 10.12. 
3 All data are weighted values, representative of Australia and New Zealand. For Pacific Island nations, may refer to Asia values. 
4 Data of Latin America, Asia, Africa, Middle East and Indian subcontinent were estimated as weighted average by taken into account parameter values related to low- and high-production systems and livestock population 
structure of low and high productivity systems. 
5 As Feeding Situation corresponding to high productivity systems is defined as Stall Fed, but for low productivity systems as Pasture/Range, a weigted activitiy coefficient was applied to estimate Net energy for activity. 
6 Ym is a weighted annual value using the high productivity value of 5.7 from Table 10.12 for the lactating period of 305 days and the value of 6.3 for the dry period (60 days). 
7 Scientific articles and reports consulted to derive peformance parameters of dairy and non-dairy cattle are listed in Annex 10B.1.

TABLE 10A.2 (NEW) (CONTINUED) 
DATA FOR ESTIMATING  TIER 1 ENTERIC FERMENTATION CH4 EMISSION FACTORS, VOLATILE SOLID AND NITROGEN EXCRETION RATES, AND N RETENTION FRACTION FOR OTHER CATTLE 
1 The value represent milk yield in kg per day during the whole year. 
2 Ym values are consist with those reported in Table 10.12. 
3 All data are weighted values, representative of Australia and New Zealand. For Pacific Island nations, may refer to Asia values. 
4 Data of Latin America, Asia, Africa, Middle East and Indian subcontinent were estimated as weighted average by taken into account parameter values related to low production systems and high production systems 
and livestock population structure of low and high productivity systems. The values were estimated based on the data reported in Table 10A.3. 
5 Scientific articles and reports consulted to derive peformance parameters of dairy and non-dairy cattle are presented in Annex 10B.1. 
6 As Feeding Situation corresponding to high productivity systems is defined as Stall Fed, but for low productivity systems as Pasture/Range, a weigted activitiy coefficient was applied to estimate Net energy for 
activity.   
7 It was assumed that the whole population of stall fed mature females is not used for draught on the regional scale in Africa. 
8 Draft bullocks were all assumed to be castrates and CFi values were adjusted accordingly.

Annex 10A.2 
Additional 
data 
and 
information 
for 
the 
calculation of methane and nitrous oxide from 
Manure Management 
This annex presents the required default data to implement the Tier 1 method for estimation of methane and nitrous 
oxide emissions from manure management. Data required in both methods include animal weight data required 
for the calculation of average VS and N excretion per animal category as well as AWMS information for regions 
in the country and improved definitional data, relating IPCC AWMS and definitions used in the EMEP/EEA air 
pollutant emission inventory guidebook. The information is a combination of the consistent data collection for 
cattle and buffalo that is compiled in Annex 10A.1 and data compiled by the FAO for use in their modelling system 
GLEAM (FAO 2017; MacLeod et al. 2017). More specific information can be found, sometimes at the country 
level at http://www.fao.org/gleam/resources/en/. Furthermore, information is supplied on IPCC climate zones.

1 For Other animal, the IPCC expert group reviewed the national inventory submissions as well as guidance in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines under the UNFCCC and concluded that common distribution of systems used to 
manage manure as follows:  
   Horses, camelelids, mules and asses, and other grazing animals; should use the data supplied for goats as a proxy; 
   American bison should use the same manure management fractions as beef cattle in North America; 
   Deer and reindeer manure deposited at 100% in PRP; 
   Ostrich (Emu) manure is 80% in PRP  and 20 percent managed in solid based systems;  
   Manure of rabbits and fur-bearing animals is 100% managed in a solid based system.  
Hence, countries may apply the same allocation of MMS in the calculation of N2O emissions from manure stored in manure management systems. However, countries are encouraged to develop a country-specific dataset 
on MMS used to manage manure generated by these categories of animals. 
 
Chapter 10: Emissions from Livestock and Manure Management 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories

Information required to determine climate zones according to Chapter 3 of 
Volume 4 Current Guideline 
Outlined below are the conditions required to determine the climate zone required for the selection of a country‚Äôs 
MCF, according to the IPCC climate zone determination as defined in Volume 4, Chapter 3, Annex 3A.5,  Figure 
3A.5.2. Where possible, if countries span multiple climate zones, efforts should be made to disaggregate animal 
populations into climate zones. If this is not possible, partys are advised to select the climate zone covering the 
greatest surface area of their country or regions of their country for which they have distinct animal populations. 
Briefly, all data is drawn from ‚ÄúThe Climate Reseach Unit (CRU) or the CGIAR-Consortium for Spatial 
Information (CSI) 1985-2015.‚Äù  Climate zones are differentiated based on the factors of mean annual temperature, 
elevation, mean annual precipitation and the ratio of mean annual precipitation to precipitation for this 30 year 
average annual weather data compilation. 
Therefore, as identified in Volume 4, Chapter 3, of these guidelines climate zones are defined: 
Tropical Montane: has > 18oC mean annual temperature and at an elevation greater than 1000m; 
Tropical Wet: has > 18oC mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation >2000mm; 
Tropical Moist: has > 18oC mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation >1000mm; 
Tropical Dry: has > 18oC mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation < 1000mm; 
Tropical Moist: has > 18oC mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation >1000mm; 
Warm temperate moist: has > 10oC mean annual temperature and a ratio of potential evapotranspiration to 
precipitation > 1; 
Warm temperate dry: has > 10oC mean annual temperature and a ratio of potential evapotranspiration to 
precipitation < 1; 
Cool temperate moist: has > 0oC mean annual temperature and a ratio of potential evapotranspiration to 
precipitation > 1; 
Cool temperate dry: has > 0oC mean annual temperature and a ratio of potential evapotranspiration to precipitation 
< 1; 
Boreal moist: has < 0oC mean annual temperature but some monthly temperatures > 10oC and a ratio of potential 
evapotranspiration > 1; 
Boreal dry: has < 0oC mean annual temperature but some monthly temperatures > 10oC and a ratio of potential 
evapotranspiration to precipitation < 1; 
Polar moist: has < 0oC mean annual temperature but all monthly temperatures < 10oC and a ratio of potential 
evapotranspiration > 1; 
Polar dry: has < 0oC mean annual temperature but all monthly temperatures < 10oC and a ratio of potential 
evapotranspiration to precipitation < 1.

Definition 
Pasture/Range/Paddock (PRP) 
Grazing 
The manure from pasture and range 
grazing animals is allowed to lie as 
deposited, and is not managed. 
Daily spread 
No definition given 
Manure is routinely removed from a 
confinement facility and is applied to 
cropland or pasture within 24 hours of 
excretion. 
Solid storage 
Heaps 
The storage of manure, typically for a 
period of several months, in unconfined 
piles or stacks. Manure is able to be 
stacked because of the presence of a 
sufficient amount of bedding material or 
loss of moisture by evaporation 
 
Dry lot 
No definition given 
A paved or unpaved open confinement 
area without any significant vegetative 
cover. Dry lots do not require the addition 
of bedding to control moisture. Manure 
may be removed periodically and spread 
on fields.   
Liquid/Slurry  
Tanks 
Manure is stored as excreted or with some 
minimal addition of water in either tanks 
or earthen ponds outside the livestock 
building, usually for periods of less than 1 
year;  
Storage with a low surface area to depth 
ratio; normally steel or concrete cylinders

Annex 10A.3 
Spreadsheet example for the calculation of a 
country or regions specific MCF 
MCF CALCULATIONS AND EXAMPLE SPREADSHEET 
This Annex was developed to explain how MCFs in the guidelines have been derived and to provide a detailed 
step by step protocol for inventory compilers to calculate country or region specific MCFs. Application of the 
model at the national scale requires national or regional monthly air temperature profiles as well as the average 
number and timing of the emptying of manure storages. Temperature data can be downloaded from various 
agencies such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) or the European Environmental 
Agency. Manure removal statistics may be taken from farm practice surveys or from expert consultation. 
Compilers should develop an estimate of the average number of manure removals per year and the months of the 
highest frequency of removals. If regional practices vary within a country, compilers should develop MCFs that 
are representative of regional practice by entering consistent manure removal statistics with regional temperature 
profiles. If regional MCFs are calculated, the national MCF should be weighted based on the number of animals 
feeding into the regional manure management systems represented by the manure removal profile and the regional 
temperature profile. 
Further, to support the 2019 Refinement, a spreadsheet was created to enable users to calculate a site-specific 
Methane Conversion Factor (MCF). The spreadsheet uses the same calculations that were used to calculate the 
MCF Table in the guidance document, but has been designed for use by inventory compilers to do calculations for 
their country-specific circumstances. The spreadsheed is available in the supplemental data supplied with this 
Chapter, identified as Supplemental Information Chapter 10, Volume IV, 2019 Refinement, and available on the 
IPCC TFI website. 
The calculation procedure outlined in the spreadsheet contains three main sections: 
Inputs to the model; 
Model calculations; 
Results from the model. 
As an explanation of procedures, within each section, cells are colour coded. Compilers are required to develop 
input data for anything that is indicated by yellow highlighted cells, and have the option of editing the orange 
highlighted cells if needed, but only if country-specific information is available for those parameters. Other cells 
are not meant to be edited by the user. 
Figure 10A.2 (New) 
Colour code for cells in the example spreadsheet 
 
MODEL INPUT 
Temperature 
The Input required to run the model at a national scale and recreate the spreadsheet is shown below (Figures 
10A.3(New) and 10A.4(New) ). In this section, the compiler should input 12 months of temperature data (degrees 
C) in cells D9:D20, based on average monthly temperatures for the region for which they wish to develop the 
MCF.  
If the compiler has estimates of national or regional manure temperature, ‚ÄúManure‚Äù should be selected in cell D6. 
As a result, the spreadsheet will copy the user-input temperature into cells E9:E20, for further use in the analysis. 
If the compiler is using national or regional air temperature (not manure temperature), ‚ÄúAir‚Äù should be selected in 
cell D6. As a result, the spreadsheet will generate an estimate for manure temperature in cells E9:E20. The 
estimates are based on the following logic:  
‚Ä¢ Manure temperature lags 1-month behind air temperature. 
o e.g., Tmanure in June = Tair in May. 
‚Ä¢ The minimum manure temperature will be used (1 degree C by default; user adjustable). 
o e.g., for Tair = -9 C, Tmanure = 1 C. 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use  
10.132 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
If and only if the storage is emptied once per year, manure temperature will be reduced by a dampening factor (3 
degrees C by default; user adjustable).  
i.e. Tman = Tair ‚Äì damping factor; e.g., 12 = 15 ‚Äì 3 
The 
logic 
equation 
is 
implemented 
in 
Excel 
as 
follows, 
for 
example, 
in 
cell 
E9: 
=IF($D$6="Manure",D9,IF($F$21>1,MAX(D20,f_Tmin),MAX(D20-f_T2damping,f_Tmin))) 
Broken into steps: 
If $D$6="Manure" then the result in E9 will equal D9 
If $D$6 is not "Manure" (i.e. it is ‚ÄúAir‚Äù) then the second IF statement is operated 
IF $F$21>1 (i.e. multiple removals per year), then no damping is applied 
Manure temperature is selected as air temperature from the previous month, and it is always 
greater or equal to the minimum temperature,  
i.e. E9 will equal MAX(D20,f_Tmin).  In this case, D20 (-6.7) is less than the minimum, so the 
result in E9 is the minimum (1.0). 
IF $F$21=1 then damping is applied 
Damping is applied by subtracting the damping factor: D20-f_T2damping 
The temperature is always greater or equal to the minimum temperature, using the MAX() function. 
The compiler should then identify the months when manure is removed from the storage in column F (F9:F20). 
This can be indicated by a ‚ÄúY‚Äù indicating months when manure was removed, and an ‚ÄúN‚Äù for months when manure 
is not removed. The number of months when manure was removed is counted and displayed in cell F21.

Constants and Other Input Parameters 
The inventory compiler is required to provide several other inputs in the section shown below (Figure 
10A.4(New)). The name of each parameter is provided in column H, the numeric value of the parameter is in 
column I, the units are in column J, the source of each value is given in column K, additional notes are in columns 
L and M, default values are in column N. To make equations more easily understood, the Microsoft Excel feature 
of ‚ÄúNamed Cells‚Äù has been used to name the cells in column I, and the name of each cell is shown in column O 
for convenience. For example, cell I7 is given the name ‚ÄúVS_PROD_YR‚Äù. See Figure 10A.4(New) for a full list 
of named cells.  
Additional information about the input parameters: 
‚Ä¢ VS Excretion ‚Äì based on IPCC guidance. 
‚Ä¢ VS% liquid storage ‚Äì this indicates what percentage of excreted VS is handled as a liquid. For example. 100 
percent indicates that all excreted VS enters the liquid storage; 
‚Ä¢ A lower number (say, 75 percent) could indicate that a portion of the solids is separated by a screwpress and 
handled as a solid (25 percent) while the remaining 75 percent is handled as liquid; 
‚Ä¢ The compiler must provide a B0 value for the manure. Refer to IPCC guidance;

‚Ä¢ The compiler may, optionally, adjust the minimum temperature (and temperature damping factors); 
‚Ä¢ The compiler also has the option to adjust the emptying efficiency, which indicates the percentage of manure 
removed from storage at each removal. By default this is set to 95 percent, indicating that 5 percent of the VS 
remain in storage after emptying. Set this value to 100 percent for complete removal.

Constants and other input parameters for the model 
 
 
Note. Constants and other input parameters for the model are shown in the top panel. Named Cells in column I are 
shown in column O, and in the Name Manager dialog box (bottom panel). No formulae exist in this part of the 
spreadsheet. 
MODEL CALCULATIONS 
The model calculations are run for three years, in order to ensure VS available has stabilized on an annual basis. 
For example, in Figure 10A.5(New), we see that VS Available (column J) increases substantially from the first 
year to the second year (J64 vs J65), and then stabilizes in the third year (J66). This is because the first year begins 
from a perfectly empty storage, whereas the second year is emptied according to the Emptying Efficiency 
parameter (95 percent removed / 5 percent remaining; Figure 10A.4(New)). 
The model approach is as follows: 
Column B: Month of year, over 3 years. These month numbers are used to extract input data shown in Figure 
10A.3(New). 
Column C: Average manure temperature in each month. This is extracted from cells E9:E20 (Figure 10A.3(New)) 
using a VLOOKUP function (Figure 10A.6(New)). 
Column D: temperature is converted from Celsius to Kelvin, using Excel‚Äôs CONVERT function 10A.6(New) . 
Column E: the temperature-dependent f parameter is calculated using the van‚Äôt Hoff-Arrhenius equation (Mangino 
et al. 2001; IPCC 2006), with updated input parameters shown in Figure 10A.4(New).  
Column F: monthly VS excreted is calculated by dividing the annual VS input parameter by 12. 
 
Chapter 10: Emissions from Livestock and Manure Management 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
10.135 
Column G: monthly VS loaded is calculated by multiplying VS excreted by the percentage stored as liquid. In this 
example, the two are equal because VS_PCT_LIQUID is 100 percent (Figure 10A.4(New)). 
Column H: monthly manure emptying is extracted from cells F9:F20 (Figure 10A.3(New)) using a VLOOKUP 
function (Figure 10A.6(New)). 
Column I: the quantity of VS emptied is calculated. The logic is as follows: if emptying occurred, then calculate 
the mass of VS available to be removed using the mass of VS available in the previous month minus the mass of 
VS consumed in the previous month. Then, multiply the result by the EMPTY_EFFICIENCY parameter (Figures 
10A.4(New) and 10A.6(New)). 
Column J: the mass of VS available for producing methane is calculated. In the first month of the first year this is 
equal to the mass of VS loaded. In all other months, this is calculated as the VS loaded in the current month + VS 
available in the previous month ‚Äì VS consumed in the previous month ‚Äì VS emptied in the current month. 
Column K: the mass of VS consumed is calculated by multiplying VS available by f. 
Column L: the volume of CH4 produced is calculated by multiplying VS consumed by B0. 
Using these values and equations, the compiler should be able to reproduce graphics such as the profile of manure 
temperature, volatile solids and methane production shown in Figure 10A.7(New).

MODEL RESULTS 
The MCF is calculated in the Results section. This is done using the third year outputs. In this particular example, 
the input air temperature is from the Cool Temperate Moist region and the retention time is 6-months. The resulting 
MCF (21 percent) is identical with the guidance document (21 percent).

NOTE ABOUT TERMINOLOGY: 
The terms ‚ÄúVS Available‚Äù and ‚ÄúVS Consumed‚Äù are used here to be consistent with the 2006 IPCC Guidelines and 
Mangino et al. 2001 approach.  However, these terms require some clarification to avoid misinterpretation: (1) 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use  
10.138 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
The term ‚ÄúVS Consumed‚Äù does not represent the real VS degraded but a conceptual quantity of VS removed from 
the liquid/slurry storage against the total biomethane potential at 35¬∞C (i.e. the conceptual proportion of the B0 
consumed at that point). Therefore, just as B0 reports the quantity of CH4 produced per kg of VS (i.e. all fractions, 
degradable and non-degradable), the concept of ‚ÄúVS Consumed‚Äù removes all fractions of VS from storage. This 
approach is convenient because it uses the B0 as the integrator of all fractions of VS degradability, and reports the 
total methane produced from all fractions as if they were incubated for infinite time, while the f parameter 
introduces a temperature dependence. Though this is convenient for modelling, and is consistent with the B0, this 
does not represent the physical reality of the liquid/slurry storage. (2) Since ‚ÄúVS Consumed‚Äù does not equate with 
the amount of VS degraded in the storage, the ‚ÄúVS available‚Äù does equate with the amount of VS that would 
actually be measured in a storage. Therefore, researchers should not attempt to compare measured VS with ‚ÄúVS 
available‚Äù. (3) The strength of this approach is its simplicity and the fact that the maximum amount of methane 
that can be produced is equal to the total VS produced multiplied by the B0. In other words, the model cannot 
produce more methane than the B0. (4) The MCF is the ratio of predicted ‚ÄúVS Consumed‚Äù to the total VS that 
entered the storage over one year. The method does not address VS destruction. If the ‚ÄúVS Consumed‚Äù were 
multiplied by B‚Äô (m3 CH4/kg VS destroyed), the result be would be erroneous because ‚ÄúVS Consumed‚Äù is not VS 
Destroyed. This is not to say that B‚Äô cannot be used to model methane production, but simply that it is not 
compatible with the ‚ÄúVS Consumed‚Äù concept. (5) Although B0 does not need to enter the MCF calculation, the 
role of B0 is to be multiplied by the MCF, as stated in equation 10.23 of the IPCC 2006 Guidelines and this 2019 
Refinement.

Calculations of Methane Conversion Factors 
(MCFs) for biogas systems 
MCFs for the biogas digester 
Biogas digesters are an important manure management systems. There are different types of biogas digesters, 
including centralised biogas digester plants, animal farm based biogas digesters, and digesters that co-digest animal 
manures and organic residues. Some biogas digesters such as  farm based biogas digesters may include prestorage, 
like pit storage below animal confinement, or outdoor storage. Co-digestion may include energy crops, and/or 
different types of organic waste in varying combinations. 
Default MCFs of biogas digesters are provided in Table 10.17 and Table 10A.11. 
MCFs depend on the amount of B0 that is realised under on farm conditions and on the amount of produced biogas 
that leakes from the biogas plant either during storage or energy production. Calculations to identify default factors 
were carried out by varying the level of leakage from the biogas installations. Calculations are based on a 
modification of the default values in Table 10.17 and Table 10A.11using the equation defined in Haenel et al. 
(2018).

For the factors of 
Ldig
and ¬µrg it is recommended to use country-specific data; if country specific data are 
unavailable. the following procedure is recommended: For high quality biogas digesters, the default 
Ldig
 is 
recommended to be 0.01 (R√∂semann et al. 2017); for low quality biogas digesters, 
Ldig
= 0.1 is recommended 
(Table 10A-4 to Table 10A-9 2006 IPCC Guidelines). The value of 0.046 is used for ¬µrg  based on Haenel et al. 
(2018)  The values presented in  Table 10A.11 are derived using Equation 10A.7 and the values cited here. Pre-
storage loss estimates are not included as no default values can be identified from the literature. Also, it is assumed 
that these losses will be low as they represent economic losses due to lower biogas production. However equations 
are included below if compilers wish to adapt their emission estimates to country-specific circumstances. 
It is assumed that even a gastight storage of digestate has a certain leakage. This leakage rate is described by the 
storage-specific leakage rate 
,
Lsto gt
. Taking into account the leakage rate and the relative share of gastight storage 
of digestate 
xgts
, the 
MCFresidues
 can be calculated following Equation 10A.8:

MCFngts
 
= methane conversion factor for the non-gastight storage of digestate, percent. It is assumed 
that MCFngts is same to the storage of raw manure.  
Biogas plants that are fed with animal manures have, as a rule, a pre-storage for the feedstock before it enters the 
digester. The CH4 losses from the pre-storage reduce the CH4 production potential in the digester and the storage 
of the digestate. This could be taken into account by modifying equations 10A.7. As a consequence Equation 
(10A.7) is transformed to the MCFdg+ps equation as Equation 10A.9.

2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Annex 10A.5 
Equations relating all direct and indirect N2O 
emissions from manure along all stages in 
agricultural production for livestock 
As explained in section 10.5.6, nitrogen excreted by animals contributes to several direct and indirect N2O emission 
as it cascades through livestock and crop cultivation systems. It is therefore crucial to accurately estimate nitrogen 
excretion rates. The total direct and indirect N2O emissions associated with the excretion of nitrogen of an animal 
type is an important quantity to assess the benefit from improving the estimation of the N-excretion coefficient for 
that animal type. However, the total direct and indirect N2O emissions from animal excretion cannot be easily 
estimated using the equations given in Chapter 10 and 11 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines and this 2019 Refinement. 
This annex provides a set of equations, based on the equations given in Chapter 10 and 11, that allows the 
quantification of total direct and indirect N2O emissions from nitrogen excretion of each animal type T. They are 
reported in Equations 10A.10 through 10A27. 
The definition of the symbols used in the set of equations is given below Equation 10A.27, grouped by symbols. 
Note that for internal consistency, the symbol N is used for all nitrogen flows in kg N animal-1 yr-1; the symbol F 
is used for all animal-independent nitrogen flows or nitrogen flows for the total animal population in kg N yr-1; the 
symbol Frac is used for all fractions in kg N (kg N)-1 or percent, the symbol EF is used for all N2O emission factors 
in kg N2O-N (kg N)-1, and the symbol N2O is used for all N2O emissions in kg N2O-N yr-1 . Not in all cases 
therefore, the symbols are identical to those used in the Equations given in Chapters 10 and 11.

Annex 10.B 
Data and Explanatory Text for Development of 
New Parameters in the 2019 Refinement 
10B.1 
Raw data used to compile Annex 10A.1 enteric 
fermentation Tier 1 emission factors, volatile solids and 
nitrogen excretion for cattle and buffalo 
A database was compiled from peer-reviewed articles, scientific and statistical reports found via a comprehensive 
literature search in google scholar (https://scholar.google.com) and Elsevier (www.sciencedirect.com) web search 
engines.  
All raw data collected from literature sources and used as a basis by the IPCC authors to refine the final values 
presented in Tables 10A.1‚Äì10A.4 are available in the supplemental data supplied with this Chapter, maintained on 
the IPCC document website, there identified as Supplemental Information Chapter 10, Volume IV, 2019 
Refinement. 
Since agricultural production systems of certain countries may be transitioning from low productivity local 
subsistence systems to higher productivity systems, the IPCC expert team of the 2019 Refinement aimed to collect 
from a variety of literature sources published to date and report the final data differentiated by production system 
and performance parameters on cattle (dairy and non-dairy) and buffaloes for each world region. 
It should be noted that the IPCC expert team assumed that such regions as North America, Western and Eastern 
Europe, and Oceania may be defined as regions where only high-production systems are in practice. However, 
Latin America, Asia, Africa, Middle East and Indian subcontinent experience transition period from low 
productivity local subsistence systems to higher productivity systems, hence, data on performance parameters and 
feeding situations of cattle and buffaloes reared in the two production systems were recorded by the IPCC expert 
team.  
Moreover, the IPCC expert team of the 2019 Refinement updated regional representation in Tables 10A.1‚Äì10A.4. 
The 2006 IPCC Guidelines contain data aggregated performance parameters and enteric fermentation emission 
factors (EFs) for Africa and Middle East, however, values of nitrogen excretion rate (Nex) were presented 
separately for these regions, i.e. for Africa and Middle East. Hence, the IPCC expert team improved consistency 
in the reporting, and the team collected raw data and conducted the estimation of enteric fermentation EFs, Volatile 
solids (VS) and Nex rates for Africa and Middle East, separately, for the both productivity systems.   
In addition, the IPCC expert team updated the representation of non-dairy cattle and buffalo sub-categories. 
Namely, the 2006 IPCC Guidelines contain data on performance parameters, diets and feeding situations, and 
corresponding EFs, VS and Nex for three main sub-categories of non-dairy cattle (i.e., mature females, mature 
males and young), the 2019 Refinement contains data and corresponding EFs, VS and Nex for four main sub-
categories: mature females, mature males, replacement and growing animals, and calves.  
The majority of values determining performance parameters, diets and feeding situations in different regions of 
the world were updated by the IPCC expert team in the 2019 Refinement. Namely: 
To develop region-average performance parameters, diets and feeding situations of dairy and non-dairy cattle for 
North America, 12 peer-reviewed publications were examined by the IPCC expert team (Appuhamy et al. 2016; 
Basarab et al. 2005; Capper 2011; Dong et al. 2014; Jayasundara et al. 2016; Legesse et al. 2016; Mulliniks et al. 
2017; Niu et al. 2018; Ominski et al. 2007; Sheppard et al. 2015; Stackhouse-Lawson et al. 2012; Waldrip et al. 
2013). Final values relied on the expert judgement and consensus of the authoring team. 
To update performance parameters, diets and feeding situation of dairy and non-dairy cattle reared in Western 
Europe, 7 peer-reviewed publications were examined by the IPCC expert team (Bannink et al. 2011; Bannink et 
al. 2016; FAO 2017; Gerrits et al. 2014; Hammond et al. 2016; Huuskonen 2017; Spek et al. 2013). Data 
determining diets and feeding situations for dairy and non-dairy cattle of Western Europe were updated; all 
performance parameters, with exception of milk yield per head of dairy cow, were carried over from the 2006 
IPCC Guidelines.  
To deliver the regional-average final value on performance parameters, diets and feeding situation of dairy and 
non-dairy cattle of Oceania, 10 data sources were examined by the IPCC expert team (studies and datasets of 
statistical offices) were examined by the IPCC expert team (Australian Government Department of Climate 
Change 2006; Dairy Technical Working Group 2015; Fick 2016; Pickering & Wear 2013; Statistics NZ 2018a; 
Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences 2018; Dairy Australia 2018; Dairy NZ 
& LIC 2018; Statistics NZ 2018b). The final values (reported in Table 10A.1 and Table 10A.2) were refined based 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use  
10.150 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
on data collected for Australia and New Zealand. Hence, the IPCC expert team encourages small Pacific Island 
nations to use enteric fermentation EFs, VS and Nex rates developed for Asian region, as productivity systems are 
more similar.  
Overall, 35 data sources (scientific publications and statistical datasets) were examined by the IPCC expert team 
to obtain raw data on performance parameters, diets and feeding situations required to develop region-average 
final values for dairy and non-dairy cattle reared in Eastern Europe (Amerkhanov et al. 2016; Azaubaeva 2008; 
Bakharev 2012; Dunin et al. 2011; FAOSTAT 2017; Furaeva 2013; Gayirbegov & Mandjiev 2013; Golubkov

2015; Tekeev & Chomaev 2011; Zadnepryanskiy & Zakirko 2012). Since Russian Federation, Ukraine and Belarus 
have the largest herd among other Eastern European countries (FAOSTAT 2017), the IPCC expert team focused 
mainly on the analysis of cattle management practice of these countries. Initial data for other Eastern European 
countries were taken from GLEAM model (FAO 2017). To make adjustment regarding the region-average final 
values reported in Table 10A.1 and Table 10A.2, the IPCC expert team considered the contribution of each country 
to the total dairy and non-dairy cattle population of Eastern Europe and corresponding parameters. 
Raw data on cattle performance parameters, diets and feeding situations were distinguished between two 
production systems (i.e. low and high) of Latin America and collected by the IPCC expert team respectively. In 
total, 52 publications were examined by the IPCC expert team (Albarr√°n-Portillo et al. 2015; Albertini et al. 2012;

Verruma & Salgado 1994). Moreover, to clarify some parameters, the IPCC expert team conducted interviews 
with lead researchers of Latin America, namely: Sebasti√°n Galbusera (Argentina); Dr. Pablo Soca, Faculty of 
Agronomy (Uruguay); Santiago Fari√±a, Dirceto of the Dairy Redearch Progmaram. National Institute of 
Agricultural Research (Uruguay); Dr. Laura Astigarraga, Faculty of Agronomy (Uruguay); Dr. Luiz Gustavo 
Ribeiro Pereira (Embrapa Dairy Cattle, Brazil); Dr. Pablo Soca, Faculty of Agronomy (Brazil). It should be noted 
that these above-listed publications were sources for initial data mostly for non-dairy cattle reared in Brazil, 
Uruguay, Peru and Argentina, and for dairy cattle husbandry practice applied in Brazil. However, initial data on 
performance parameters, diets and feeding situations applied for dairy cattle of other countries of Latin America 
were obtained from GLEAM model (FAO 2017). To adjust the final values recorded in Table 10A.1 and Table 
10A.3, the dairy and non-dairy cattle population kept in each country of Latin America was taken into 
consideration by the IPCC expert team.  
Performance parameters, diet and feeding situation of dairy and non-dairy cattle of the whole Asian region for 
low- and high-productivity systems were refined based on detailed data obtained from 50 publications (Alejandrino 
et al. 1999; Zi et al. 2003; Sutarno 2015; Hieu Vu et al. 2016; Widiawati et al. 2016; Gunawan & Jakaria 2011;

Cheng 1984; Gao et al. 2013). Raw data were obtained from the literature sources to determine parameters 
corresponding to low- and high-producing systems. Performance parameters of dairy and non-dairy cattle and their 
feeding systems were investigated for the following countries: China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and 
Vietnam. Moreover, the data of GLEAM model (FAO 2017) were used in a greater degree. A contribution of each 
country to the total cattle population of Asian region was considered by the IPCC expert team to adjust final values 
reported in Table 10A.1 and Table 10A.3.  
Data on performance parameters, diets and feeding situations of dairy cattle reared in low- and high-productivity 
systems of African region were directly obtained from GLEAM model (FAO 2017). The model contains a 
compherensive dataset for the both types of productivity system applied in Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, Tanzania.

Moreover, performance parameters, diet and feeding situation of non-dairy cattle reared in the both productivity 
systems of African region were obtained as results of the analysis of 101 scientific articles and statistical reports

population of non-dairy cattle of African region and contribution of the non-dairy population reared in each African 
country to the total (FAOSTAT (2017) was taken into consideration by the IPCC expert team to determine the 
final values on performance parameters, diet and feeding situation representative for the whole African region.  
Overall, 24 publications were examined by the IPCC expert team to obtain raw data on performance parameters, 
diets and feeding situations of dairy and non-dairy cattle reared in low- and high-productivity systems of Middle 
East (Akba≈ü et al. 2006; Turkish Statistical Institute 2017; Karakok 2007; CBAT 2017; Chashnidel et al. 2007; da

al. 2016; √ñzl√ºt√ºrk et al. 2006; Yalcin et al. 2017; Yilmaz et al. 2012). Due to an extend of contribution to the total 
dairy and non-dairy cattle population of Middle East, the focus of the IPCC expert team was made to investigate 
dairy and non-dairy cattle management practice applied in Turkey and Iran. The raw data obtained from literature 
sources for these two countries were adjusted to be a basis to evaluate the final values on performance parameters, 
diets and feeding situations representative for low- and high-productivity systems of the whole Middle East region.   
Raw data on performance parameters, diets and feeding situations of low- and high-productivity systems applied 
for dairy and non-dairy cattle in Indian subcontinent were derived as a result of the analysis of 47 publications

et al. 2015; Tomar & Sharma 2002; Yadava 2009; Yasothai 2014). Taking into consideration, the largest 
contribution of cattle population of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh to the total dairy and non-dairy cattle 
population of the region, the main focus of the IPCC expert team was to collect and investigate low-productivity 
and high-productivity cattle farming of these countries. The final values reported in Table 10A.1 and Table 10A.3 
were refined by the IPCC expert team based on consensus and were used to conduct estimations of enteric 
fermentation EFs, VS and Nex rates for dairy and non-dairy cattle in low- and high-productivity systems of Indian 
subcontinent. 
Data to complete calculations of enteric fermentation emission factors, VS and nitrogen excretion rates for 
buffaloes were significantly updated in the 2019 Refinement in comparison with the information reported in the 
2006 IPCC Guidelines. Namely, the 2006 IPCC Guidelines report the initial data employed and corresponding 
EFs for two main regions: Indian subcontinent and Other regions. The IPCC expert team of the 2019 Refinement 
extended regional representation and collected data for the same regions, which were applied to present EFs of 
cattle. Hence, data on buffalo performance parameters, diets and feeding situation for Western Europe, Eastern 
Europe, Latin America, Asia, Africa and Middle East were developed and reported in addition to presented dataset 
developed for Indian subcontinent. North America and Oceania were omitted from the reporting as according to 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use  
10.152 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
the data presented in (FAOSTAT 2017), the regions do not have any buffalo husbandry practice. Moreover, region-
average final values on performance parameters, diets and feeding situations were reported for four buffalo 
subcategories for all regions: mature males, mature females, growing and replacing animals and calves. The only 
exception was made for Indian subcontinent, where the final values were presented for five subcategories: breeding 
mature males, working mature males, mature females, growing and replacing animals and calves. 
The IPCC expert team has decided not to distinguish performance parameter values, diets and feeding situation 
between low productivity and high-productivity systems implemented in buffalo husbandry across the world 
regions as it was conducted for dairy and non-dairy cattle, but to collect and report region-average values. 
Overall, eight peer-reviewed publications were examined by the IPCC expert team to deliver performance 
parameters, diets and feeding situation of buffaloes kept in Western Europe (Borghese 2013; Condor et al. 2008; 
FAO 2005; FAO 2017; Gonzalez Gonzalez 2011; IPCC 2006; Neglia et al. 2014; Sabia et al. 2014; Zicarelli et al. 
2007). Since Italy is a main contributor to the total buffalo population of Western Europe (FAOSTAT 2017), the 
buffalo husbandry practice of Italy was considered to be a representative for the whole Western Europe. However, 
data on buffalo performance parameters of Germany and Greece were also taken into consideration to adjust final 
values reported in Table 10A.4. The calculation of enteric fermentation EFs, VS and Nex rates were conducted 
based on Tier 2 method of the 2019 Refinement.  
To deliver data on performance parameters, diet characterisation and feeding situation of buffaloes of Eastern 
Europe, the focus in the research completed by the IPCC expert team was mainly made on investigation of buffalo 
husbandry implemented in Bulgaria and Romania. In total, 11 publications (i.e. case studies and statistical reports) 
were examined to complete a dataset needed to compute enteric fermentation EFs, VS and Nex rates (Atanasov et 
al. 2012; Borghese 2013; Dimov & Tzankova 2003; FAO 2005;  FAOSTAT 2017; IPCC 2006; MZH 2016; MZH 
2017; Nikolov 2011; Peeva et al. 2011; Peeva et al. 2013; Tzankova & Dimov 2003).  
To develop a dataset on performance parameters, diets and feeding situation representing buffalo husbandry 
practice of Latin America, overall 25 studies were examined by the IPCC expert team (Andrade & Garcia 2005; 
Andrighetto et al. 2003; Andrighetto et al. 2003; Bailone et al. 2017; Cardoso et al. 1997; Cardoso et al. 2017a;

2009; Verruma & Salgado 1994). Moreover, the IPCC expert team organized interviews with top researchers in 
this area to specify the findings and to cover lacking information from the scientific publications (Cristiana 
Andrighetto (UNESP-Dracena); Dr. Jos√© Ribamar Felipe Marques (Embrapa Amaz√¥nia Oriental)). In general, the 
final values recorded in Table 10A.4 for Latin America represent mainly characteristics of buffalo herd of Brazil, 
as the investigation of buffalo performance parameters reared in other countries of Latin America was not 
conducted by the IPCC expert team.  
Overall, 42 publications (case studies and statistical reports) were examined by the IPCC expert team to derive 
raw data on buffalo performance parameters, diets and feeding situation of Asian region (Abd El-Salam & El-

analysis of buffalo husbandry practice applied in China, Indonesia, Laos, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand and 
Vietnam was conducted to underlay for adjustment, based on consensus of the authoring team, of the final values 
of Table 10A.4. 
According to the data reported (FAOSTAT 2017), only Egypt has population of domesticated buffaloes among 
other African counties. Hence, to deliver data on performance parameters, diets and feeding situation employed to 
compute enteric fermentation EFs, VS and Nex rates for buffaloes reared in African region, 22 publications 
determining Egyptian buffalo husbandry practice was examined by the IPCC expert team (Abd-Allah et al. 2015;

omitted from the analysis, the final values reported in Table 10A.4 and used in the calculations are relied on the 
expert judgement and consensus of the authoring team. 
The analysis of 27 publications (case studies and statistical reports) resulted in evaluation of the region-average 
final values on performance parameters, diets and feeding situation of buffaloes husbandry for Middle East (Azary

Due to the availability and representation of publications, the focus of the IPCC expert team was mostly made on 
buffaloes reared in Tukey and Iran, the data collected for these countries were considered as a basis to made 
adjustment regarding region-average final values for Middle East reported in Table 10A.4. 
To deliver initial data required to calculate enteric fermentation EFs, VS and Nex rates for buffaloes reared in 
Indian subcontintent, 37 publications (case studies and statistical reports) were examined by the IPCC expert team 
(Afzal et al. 2009; AGRI-IS 2017; Anitha et al. 2011; Anjum et al. 2012a; Anjum et al. 2012b; Basra & Nisa

2013; Tauqir et al. 2011). Data on performance parameters, diets and feeding situation of different breeds of 
buffaloes in India and Pakistan were adjusted to make the expert decision on the final values reported in Table 
10A.4 and to conduct the calculations.  
10B.2 
Estimation of Cattle/Buffalo CH4 conversion factors (Ym) 
Dairy Yms were developed considering summary statistics from the database consisting of results from 3,353 cows 
used in Niu et al. (2018) (Table 10B.1(New)) as well as data synthesis presented in the articles of Appuhamy et 
al. (2016), Hellwing et al. (2016) and Jayasundera et al. (2016). It was noted by the IPCC panel that these studies 
were not representative of global dairy systems and for that reason simple means developed through statistical 
analyses were deemed not to be reliable. Final values relied on the expert judgement and consensus of the authoring 
team. The summary statistics from Niu et al. (2018) are presented below (Table 10B.1), dividing that large data 
set into high, medium and low levels of milk productivity.  
In the case of all productivity systems, clear differences were identified between the North American and the 
European feeding and production systems. The strongest contrasting factor was the proportion of neutral detergent 
fibre (NDF) in the diets of the two regions. Based on these summary statistics the Ym is clearly driven by the 
relationship with NDF within the two regional production categories (Figure 10B.1). 
To provide additional guidance for the selection of the methane conversion rates, NDF thresholds were established 
(Table 10B.1). For the highest production categories  based on the North American and European statistics  a low  
NDF <35 percent DMI and a high NDF >35 percent DMI categories were developed with values equivalent to 5.7 
and 6.0 percent GEI respectively.  
In the case of the values for the mid-range productivity, the value of 6.3 was determined assuming that NDF values 
were greater than 37 percent DMI as the values for medium and low producing animals from North America could 
not be considered to be representative of low production and lower quality diets. For countries that can clearly 
demonstrate that the NDF of their feed has been greater than 37 percent DMI, it is recommended to use the high 
production value that corresponds to the NDF content of the feed. 
For low-productivity, the unweighted mean value of 6.5 from the European and North American data, consistent 
with the 2006 IPCC Guidelines was selected. The panel did not consider that there was reliable data to modify the 
value from the 2006 IPCC Guidelines value considering the very wide variety of diets that could be occurring 
globally for low productivity dairy cattle. However, it is proposed in the text that if dairy cattle are fed mainly on 
low quality forages countries are recommended to use the non dairy forage diet Ym of 7.0.

In the case of beef cattle, a total of 113 measurements were compiled from 35 studies. Studies were divided by 
their dominant diet type into three categories, high forage diets, mixed diets (mixed forage and concentrate) and 
feedlot diets. Summary statistics were compiled and group averages are reported. Due to the variability in the data, 
values were rounded based on expert judgement. An overall average was developed for the feedlot and non-feedlot 
diets. Non feedlot diets were differentiated between dominantly forage based diets and mixed concentrate diets.  
There is important variability in the results of studies that attempt to develop relationships between feed quality 
and methane yield. Nonetheless, numerous empirical and biochemical modelling studies demonstrate both the 
statistical significance and the biochemical processes that relate reductions in methane production with the 
introduction of concentrates to ruminant diets (Mills et al. 2001; Mills et al. 2003; Ellis et al. 2006; Ellis et al. 
2007; Ellis et al. 2009; Ellis et al. 2010; Alemu et al. 2011; Bannink et al. 2011; Ellis et al. 2014; Escobar-
Bahamondes et al. 2016; Kebreab et al. 2016). For this reason, methane conversion rates are produced from a 
summary of low, medium and high dietary forage proportions. Raw data used in the development of these values 
are published in the IPCC TFI website.

Estimation of Default Emission Factor(s) based on Goat 
Tier 2 parameters 
A database was compiled from peer-reviewed articles that studied in-vivo methane (CH4) production from goat 
enteric fermentation and N excretion. These studies were identified through a comprehensive literature search 
performed in Google scholar and ResearchGate and from sources that carried out review work such as a recent 
study attempting to derive statistical models for prediction of enteric CH4 from goats (Patra & Lalhriatpuii 2016) 
and a New Zealand technical report for CH4 and N excretion rates for goats (Lassey 2012). Data were directly 
extracted from the individual studies identified. Authors were contacted in order to fill in gaps of information from 
the studies. 
Overall, 63 publications were obtained from a varied sample of countries and 18 different goat breeds (Aguilera 
et al. 1990; Prieto et al. 1990; Shibata et al. 1992; Haque et al. 1997; AFRC 1998; Haque et al. 1998; Islam et al.

Although there was a total of 290 treatment means, treatments that were using substances with antimethanogenic 
properties were excluded before analysis. The minimum prerequisite for a study to be included in the data set was 
that Ym values (or gross energy and CH4 output energy) were reported. 
Information on feed and diet characteristics, feed intake, breed, animal type, digestibility, and rumen were 
collected in the final data set. Table 10B.4 shows the mean and the range of some of the diet and animal variables 
for the different studies. Values were quite heterogeneous. For example, dry matter intake ranged between 0.14 
and 2.51 kg DM intake/day animal (0.93 on average).  
The concentrations of crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and starch were within the range of 6-26 
percent (mean value of 15 percent), 18-74 percent (mean value of 42 percent) and 1-42 percent (mean value of 19 
percent), respectively. 
Methane production was expressed as grams per day, liters per day, megajoules per day, or as a proportion of GE 
or DE; therefore, the following factors were used in converting units: 1 g = 1.40 L =55.5 kJ; 1 L = 0.716 g = 39.54 
kJ.

The average methane emission was 16.2 g CH4/animal day, 18.3 g CH4/kg DM intake, 0.42 g CH4/ kg BW (data 
not shown). Average/median methane conversion factor (Ym) was 5.3 percent, which is in the range of the recent 
value obtained by the study by Patra & Lalhriatpuii (2016), which included 42 studies. 
We analyzed the relationship between methane output and diet type (e.g. diet digestibility, percent forage use) but 
there were no any clear statistical relationships between diet type and enteric methane output (data not shown).  In 
general increased body weight and milk yield resulted in greater CH4 output but body weight and milk yield did 
not show any statistical relationship with Ym (data not shown).  
Methane output per animal was positively correlated with dry matter (Fig 10B.2) and gross energy (Fig 10B.3) 
intake (R2=0.60; P<0.00001).

In order to develop Tier 1 EF for enteric CH4 from goats for both low and high production systems the following 
steps were followed: 
‚Ä¢ Average goat weight (LW) for high and low production systems were estimated using global world information 
from Gerber et al. (2013). For high and low production systems it was estimated average weight values of 50 
kg and 28 kg, respectively. 
‚Ä¢ Daily dry matter intake per animal was estimated as a function of animal weight using the equation from AFRC 
(1998). 
‚Ä¢ Using the equation from Fig 10B.2 we obtained kg CH4/animal yr as a function of the previously estimated 
value of daily dry matter intake. 
EF for Tier 1 resulted in 8.7 and 4.9 kg CH4/head yr for high and low production systems, respectively.  These 
values are both lower than those estimated in Vermorel et al. (2008) from French systems (11.9 kg CH4/head yr-
1) and that for high production systems is similar to that proposed by Lassey ( 2012) for New Zealand goat herd. 
Considering the data analysed, a Ym of 5.5 percent has been chosen. No clear evidence was found to develop Ym 
factors separately as a function of diet quality or production system.  
In order to develop default values for N excretion rates (for Table 10.19) the following  steps were followed: 
Average goat weight (LW) for each global region were estimated using global world information from GLEAM 
FAO. 
Daily N intake per animal and day was estimated as a function of average goat weight using the relationship 
developed from this database relating goat weight and N intake (Fig 10B.4) (R2=0.48; P<0.00001).  
Daily N excretion rate was subsequently calculated using the relationship also found using this database relating 
daily N intake and daily N excretion (Fig 10B.5) (R2=0.89; P<0.00001) and transforming values to excretion rates 
espressed as kg N (1000 kg animal mass)-1) day-1.

In order to develop default values for volatile solids (VS) excretion rates (for Table 10.14A) we calculated daily 
VS excretion from goats for each world region according to equation 10.24. Gross energy intake was derived based 
on DM intake using the conversion factor 18.45 MJ/kg DM. We assumed that digestibility of the feed was 50 and 
60 percent for developing and developed countries, respectively. The ash content of the feed was assumed to be 8 
percent. We assumed the animal weights for each region based on information from FAO work: GLEAM FAO.

Feed intake estimates using a simplified Tier 2 method 
Prediction of DMI for cattle based on body weight and estimated dietary net energy 
concentration (NEma) or digestible energy values (DE percent): 
Several studies have shown that dry matter intake (DMI) is highly and positively related to methane emissions. In 
some cases it has been reported that up to 92 percent of the variability in enteric methane emissions could be 
explained by DMI alone (Charmley et al. 2016). Most models developed to predict enteric methane emissions 
usually include either DMI or some form of feed intake. There are a number of models already developed with the 
objective of predicting DMI and these could be used in conjunction with emission factors to estimate enteric 
methane emissions in a Tier 2 approach. Appuhamy et al. (2016) evaluated 40 prediction equations using data that 
included measured DMI and feed quality attributes from North America, Europe and Australia/New Zealand. The 
best performing models in each region were then re-evaluated using calculated DMI and compared with estimates 
that used measured DMI. They evaluated several DMI prediction equations including the Cornell Net 
Carbohydrate and Protein System (CNCPS, Fox et al. 1992) as modified by Arnerdal (2005), National Research 
Council (NRC 2001) (developed based on North America cows), Lindgren et al. (2001) and Arnerdal (2005) 
(developed using data from cows in Europe), and Vazquez and Smith (2000) model (developed from 
Australia/New Zealand data). Appuhamy et al. (2016) reported that models using estimated DMI predicted enteric 
methane emissions just as good as the measured data and concluded that enteric methane emissions from dairy 
cows can be predicted successfully with estimated DMI, particularly using the modified CNCPS model. 
Appuhamy et al. (2018) further evaluated the comprehensive (IPCC-CMP) and simplified (IPCC-SMP) IPCC 
models (IPCC 2006) to predict DMI as well as the modified CNCPS and NRC (2001) models to predict DMI using 
an independent data. The modified CNCPS relying on BW and fat corrected milk yield (Eq. 1) more accurately 
predicted DMI (RMSPE = 14.1 percent) than NRC (RMSPE = 19.4 percent), IPCC-SMP (RMSPE = 16.9 percent), 
and IPCC-CMP (RMSPE = 23.4 percent). Overall, the results demonstrated that DMI of dairy cows can be 
predicted successfully using information such as milk yield, milk fat content, and body weight (BW) that are 
routinely available in dairy farms. 
DMI (kg/d) = 0.0185 * BW (kg) + 0.305 * fat corrected milk (kg/d)  
 
Eq [1] 
A simplified approach can also be used to estimate DMI of beef cattle, updated based on the most recent 
methodologies as described by NASEM (2017). For growing and finishing cattle, equations are: 
Calves 
DMI (kg/d) = (BW0.75 * (0.2435 * NEmf ‚Äì 0.0466 * NEmf2 ‚Äì 0.1128)) / NEmf

Basis for Changes to MCF Calculations for Liquid/Slurry 
The following briefly summarizes the 2006 IPCC Guidelines approach and improvements included in the current 
approach. 
2006 IPCC Guidelines Model for Liquid/Slurry: 
The 2006 IPCC Guidelines MCF for liquid slurry was based on the following relationship: 
MCF = f 
where f was calculated with the following temperature-dependent Arrhenius function, derived from Mangino et 
al. (2001), which is based on Safley & Westerman (1990): 
f = EXP[(Ea√ó(T2-T1))/(R√óT2√óT1)] 
where,  
f is a dimensionless fraction (0 to 1). Originally, Safley & Westerman (1990) used f to design an anaerobic digestion 
system at a lower temperature (T2) based on known performance of a digester at a warmer temperature (T1). 
Ea is the activation energy. Originally, Safley and Westerman used Ea = 15175 cal/mol, based on an earlier study. 
Mangino et al. (2001) continued to use 15175 cal/mol.  
T2 is the variable temperature (K). Defined by Safley & Westerman (1990) as the unknown anaerobic digester 
temperature. Mangino et al. (2001) defined T2 as the monthly temperature of the anaerobic lagoon (assuming 
equality with monthly average air temperature). The 2006 IPCC Guidelines defined T2 as the annual average 
temperature of a region. 
T1 is the reference temperature (K). Defined by Safley & Westerman (1990) as 30 ¬∞C (303.16 K). Mangino et al. 
(2001) and the 2006 IPCC Guidelines use the same value. 
R is the gas constant 1.987 cal k-1 mol-1. 
The reasons for modification of MCF, though the Methane conversion factor 
(MCF) remains an uncertain parameter. 
First and foremost, in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, the MCF parameter violates a first-principle of inventory 
development: comparability. The use of an annual average temperature to calculate MCF systematically 
underestimates the annual MCF due to the mathematical principle known as Jensen‚Äôs Inequality which applies to 
non-linear functions such as the Arrhenius equation (VanderZaag et al. 2018). Using this mathematical principle 
it can be shown that for a 1-month retention time, the annual average MCF calculated based on monthly 
temperature will always exceed the MCF calculated from the annual average temperature. Therefore, the 2006 
IPCC Guidelines MCF values are underestimates, and the level of underestimation is greatest for countries with 
large seasonal temperature extremes. 
The model in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines also used a management and design practices (MDP) factor which reduced 
the mass of VS entering the manure storage or lagoon. Since VS cannot simply vanish, there needs to be 
justification for altering the VS loading rate.  In the modified method, the MCF calculation used an MDP = 1.0, 
which means we are assuming the VS Excretion rates are correct, and that VS Excreted enters the liquid manure 
storage.  MDP factors may be used in specific cases such as when solid-liquid separation systems are used, 
whereby VS is removed from the liquid system and transferred to a solid system. However in most cases the use 
of MDP factor is indicative of an inaccurate B0 or VS input into the manure storage system. 
For the sake of completeness, it is worth pointing out that the quantity of VS entering liquid storage could be 
greater than VS excreted (implied MDP >1.0). For instance, the use of straw bedding results in additional VS 
entering the liquid storage. Another example is waste milk (from treated cows, or from cleaning milking systems) 
on dairy farms which adds VS to the storage. Secondly, it is well known that the retention time of liquid manure 
in storage is a critical parameter in determining MCF, and the 2006 IPCC Guidelines state ‚Äúboth temperature and 
retention time play an important role in the calculation of MCF‚Äù. However, the 2006 IPCC Guidelines calculations 
of MCF (Table 1), give very little focus to retention time. Previous Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty 
Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (GPG2000) recommended that future MCFs be modelled 
accounting for the storage period (Zeeman & Gerbens 2000). Furthermore, the work of Safley & Westerman 
(1990) showed that the same amount of VS destruction can be achieved by longer retention time at lower 
temperature compared with shorter retention time at higher temperature.  Furthermore the suggestion to use 
formula 1 for batch-fed storage/digesters that is currently in 2006 IPCC Guidelines would not result in a value that 
is comparable to the default annual temperature values, because this equation would inherently require inclusion 
of retention time.  
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use  
10.162 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Recent year-round field studies in climates where the annual average air temperature was <10¬∞C have reported 
MCFs in the range of 0.61 (Wightman & Woodbury 2016) , ‚â•0.57 (Balde et al. 2016a) at liquid/slurry dairy manure 
storages, and greater for anaerobic lagoons (Leytem et al. 2017). Controlled studies at or around 20¬∞C without 
added inoculum reported MCF of 55 percent over 165 d (VanderZaag et al. 2010) and 32 percent over 150-d 
(Masse et al. 2008). Another study showed the MCF increased non-linearly with the duration of storage (Le Riche 
et al. 2016). Previous IPCC Guidance reported an MCF of 39 percent, 45 percent, and 72 percent for liquid/slurry 
for Cool, Temperate, and Warm climates, respectively (Zeeman & Gerbens 2000). They also stated that 
liquid/slurry storage tanks were considered to have ‚â•6 month retention time. Therefore, the interaction between 
retention time and temperature has long been recognized, but the calculation of MCFs has not been fully 
transparent about how this important interaction has been handled (or how it should be handled by practitioners) 
and therefore has made comparability with measurements challenging.  
Thirdly, the single temperature time step given in the IPCC guidelines suggests a level of certainty that is simply 
not supported by the experimental results, considering the approach being used. 
TABLE 10B.6 2006 IPCC GUIDELINES TABLE OF MCF VALUES FOR LIQUID/SLURRY (TABLE 10.17)  
 
Proposed Changes: 
The proposed change is to use a spreadsheet model to calculate MCF using monthly temperature in each IPCC 
climate region, and for a specific liquid manure retention time (e.g. the table below). Therefore, this approach 
produces MCF values that account for both temperature and retention time, while leaving the users to decide which 
retention time is appropriate for their manure management systems. The spreadsheet model <Vol4_Ch10_ 
MCF_Calculation-Spreadsheet> for calculation of country-specific MCFs is available at https://www.ipcc-

Changes in liquid/slurry MCF, compared to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines are 
summarized below: 
 
Chapter 10: Emissions from Livestock and Manure Management 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
10.163 
#1 ‚Äì Timestep: 
Monthly temperature (proposed) instead of annual average temperature (IPCC 2006) 
Methane emissions are non-linearly related to temperature, therefore Jensen‚Äôs inequality states that the use of the 
average temperature will lead to systematic underestimation. As a result, monthly average air temperature is 
proposed for the calculation of MCF, rather than annual average temperature. Therefore, it is proposed that MCF 
for liquid/slurry be calculated using the Mangino et al. (2001) spreadsheet model, with the regional climate data 
from the IPCC defined climate regions. Additional details below. 
#2 ‚Äì Retention Time: 
Several retention times (proposed) instead of 1-month implied retention time (IPCC 
2006) 
Retention time is a crucial parameter determining the extent of methane emissions and the quantity of VS in storage 
at any given time, therefore affecting the MCF. The 2006 IPCC Guidelines used a 1-month retention time for all 
liquid/slurry systems by using MCF = f, based on an annual average temperature. Using a 1-month retention time 
is unrealistic, since the majority of liquid/slurry storages are meant for storage over several months or more. 
Therefore, it is proposed to calculate MCF based on five retention times: 1 month, 3 months, 4 months, 6 months, 
and 12 months. 
Proposed ‚Äúgood practice‚Äù in the case of countries that do not have information on retention times is to use the six 
month retention time. 
#3 ‚Äì Activation Energy (Ea): 
Updated Ea value (19347 cal/mol proposed) instead of 15175 cal/mol (IPCC 2006) 
Recent research from Petersen et al. (2016) and Elsgaard et al. (2016) propose a new Ea value of 81 kJ/mol = 
19347 cal/mol. It is proposed to use this updated value. 
#4 ‚Äì Reference Temperature (T 1): 
Updated T1 value (308.16 proposed) instead of 303.16 K (IPCC 2006) 
The value of T1 used by 2006 IPCC Guidelines and Mangino et al. (2001) is directly taken from Safley & 
Westerman (1990). The original intent of Safley and Westerman was comparing performance of a known and 
unknown anaerobic digester performance. In Mangino et al. (2001) and the 2006 IPCC Guidelines the value of T1 
defines the temperature at which f = 1.0, therefore T1 defines the temperature at which the B0 will be reached in 
one month. There is considerable literature on laboratory methods for incubating manure to measure methane 
potential (e.g. BMP, B0) and it is customary for the temperature of these incubations to be ca. 35¬∞C, rather than 
30¬∞C. With a temperature of 35¬∞C it would be reasonable to expect the B0 to nearly be reached in 30 days (i.e. one 
month) (e.g. Owen et al. 1979; Pham et al. 2013). Therefore, it is proposed to change T1 to 308.16 K (=35 + 
273.16). 
#5 ‚Äì Manure Temperature (T 2): 
Manure temperature lagging behind T ai r (proposed) instead of equal T a ir (IPCC 2006) 
Most of the time, manure temperature does not equal air temperature. The temperature of liquid manure tends to 
lag behind air temperature. While models for manure temperature do exist (Rennie et al. 2017) this is too complex 
for the general guidelines. As a pragmatic alternative, a 1-month lag is proposed, i.e.,  set T2 = Tair from the previous 
month. It has also been shown (Rennie et al. 2018) that manure storages which are emptied once per year at the 
end of the growing season before winter stay cooler than air temperature during the summer. Therefore, only in 
the case of once per year emptying (i.e. 12 month retention time), a downward temperature shift of 3¬∞C has also 
been applied. 
#6 ‚Äì VS carryover after emptying: 
After manure is removed, 5 percent remains (proposed), instead of complete emptying 
(IPCC 2006) 
It has been shown in several studies that farms do not completely empty liquid/slurry storages due to the practical 
challenge of doing so at the farm-scale (Balde et al. 2016b). Therefore, it is proposed that 5 percent of VS is 
retained in storage after emptying, rather than 0 percent (i.e. completely clean) assumption implied in the 2006 
IPCC Guidelines calculations. It is noteworthy that the IPCC 2000 Good Practice Guide (Zeeman & Gerbens 
2000) mention approximately 15 percent of the manure storage cannot be emptied.

Revision of methane from dung deposited onto pasture 
range and paddocks (Table 10.17) 
Dataset 
Cai et al. (2017) included 26 data, however some of these were omitted due to incomplete information to allow an 
estimation of methane conversion factor (MCF) and/or emission factors on the basis of volatile solids (VS) content. 
Therefore, the number of values retained was 20. Our review of the literature identified a further 25 suitable values 
(Carran et al. 2003; Saggar et al. 2003; Sherlock et al. 2003b; Sherlock et al. 2003a; Kelly et al. 2016), resulting 
in a total of 45 data values spanning six countries (Table 10B.8). Data were available for dairy cattle (25), beef 
cattle (9), sheep (8) and yaks (3). Data was assessed for suitability, in terms of length of study, sufficient replication 
and inclusion of key manure characteristics to allow estimation of the emission factors (g CH4/kg VS; Table 10B.9) 
and MCF (percent; Table 10.17). Some studies also presented emissions on the basis of mass of CH4 emitted per 
unit of faecal dry matter (FDM). Therefore, we have also supplied emission factors using these units (g CH4/kg 
FDM) for countries with access to total FDM (Table 10B.9).

Emission factors 
Methane conversion factors (MCF) and emission factors were estimated for both cattle and sheep, where yaks 
were grouped with cattle (Table 10B.9). For estimating MCFs and emission factors based on VS content, ash 
content of dung is required. We estimated dung ash content to be 17.9 percent for pasture-fed sheep, beef cattle 
and dairy cattle (Fries et al. 1982; Karn 1991; Waghorn et al. 1999; Andueza et al. 2017). Data from a UK study 
(Defra, 2014) suggested that the IPCC B0 values were appropriate for cattle, we therefore assumed the IPCC values 
for sheep were also reasonable estimates. For yaks, we used the IPCC default B0 value for buffalo (0.100). 
There was no significant difference in values for cattle and sheep regardless of the method of representing methane 
emissions (P > 0.05). For the refinement of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines we therefore suggest an aggregated value 
is used. We also explored the possibility of disaggregating EF values by climatic zones, however the limited size 
of the dataset did not support this. Therefore, an aggregated value regardless of temperature is suggested for the 
refinement.  
When adopting a Tier 2 approach, the MCF must be used in conjunction with a single B0 value of 0.19 m3 CH4 kg-
1 of VS excreted to ensure consistency with the Tier 1 emission factor provided in Table 10.14.

Estimation of default values for MCFs, EFs for direct N2O 
emissions, NH3 and N2 volatilized as well as NO3 leached 
from solid storage and composting systems 
Methodologies 
The estimation of updated MCF values, EF for direct N2O emissions and NO3 leaching and N2 from both (i) solid 
storage and (i) two composting systems (static pile and passive windrow) are based on an extensive meta-analysis 
of 50 peer-reviewed research articles involving 304 observations and published in open access by Pardo et al. 
(2015). In this study it was quantified the response of GHG emissions, NH3 emissions, and total N losses to 
different solid waste management strategies (conventional solid storage, turned composting, forced aerated 
composting, covering, compacting, addition/substitution of bulking agents and the use of additives).  
For solid storage, new treatments have been proposed to be incorporated in the 2019 Refinement: 
covering/compacted (both treatments had similar effects on GHG emissions), addition/substitution of bulking 
agents and the use of additives. In the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National GHG inventories default emission 
factors for solid storage were based on expert IPCC judgement and a single study (Amon et al. 2001). In Pardo et 
al. (2015) the estimation of MCF values and EF for direct N2O emissions from solid storage (without treatment) 
is based on data from 30 studies at the farm level. 
For the new treatments, MCF values and EFs for direct N2O emissions have been based on:  
‚Ä¢ 9 studies for compacting and covering; 
‚Ä¢ 11 studies for addition/substitution of bulking agents; 
‚Ä¢ 6 studies for use of additives. 
For the rest of the management systems, MCF values and EF for direct N2O emissions have been based on: 
‚Ä¢ 22 studies for solid storage; 
‚Ä¢ 6 studies for composting-static piles (Forced aeration); 
‚Ä¢ 11 studies for composting-Passive windrow (infrequent turning). 
Based on the 2006 IPCC Guidelines climate zone classification two factors were defined: Temperature, which 
involved two categories (i) Warm temperate and (ii) Cool temperate; and annual rainfall rate, including (i) Dry, 
(ii) Moist and (iii) Wet conditions. 
CH 4 MCF 
For the absolute CH4-C emission values, Pardo et al. (2015) used untreated solid storage as a reference system. 
They compared estimated percent C lost as CH4 using the 2006 IPCC Guidelines method (IPCC 2006 MCF) with 
the values obtained at the different studies (Figure 10B.6).

Figure 10B.6 (New) 
Comparison between ranges of CH4-C emissions observed in collected 
studies in Pardo et al. (2015) (new) with estimations for the same studies according to the 2006 
IPCC Guidelines methodology. Figure adapted from Pardo et al. (2015). 
 
For untreated solid storage systems Pardo et al. (2015) showed that overall values were within the 2006 IPCC 
Guidelines range for CH4 emissions (Figure 10B.6) and confirmed that the differences between cold and temperate 
conditions were in agreement with those indicated by the 2006 IPCC Guidelines not shown here, Figure S3b in 
Pardo et al. (2015). There were not enough studies under warm conditions and therefore, the assumption is to keep 
the same values indicated by the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.  
Values for new solid storage treatments and composting (static pile and passive windrow) are estimated using the 
reference value from the untreated solid storage system and the relative differences observed in Pardo et al. (2015).  
For the new treatments, covering or compacted solid storage resulted in emissions in the same range as in solid 
storage not shown here, Figure 2b in Pardo et al. (2015) and estimated reduction of 75 percent and 50 percent was 
observed due to bulking agent addition and additives, respectively not shown here, Figure 2b in Pardo et al. (2015). 
The differences amongst climatic zones were assumed to be in the same proportion as that found for untreated 
solid storage systems. 
Both composted static piles and static windrows were estimated to produce 50 percent of the CH4 emitted from 
solid storage not shown here, Figure 2b in Pardo et al. (2015), which results in consistently greater values than 
those indicated by the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. As a difference to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, CH4 emissions were 
found to be temperature dependent for both composting systems (2006 IPCC Guidelines did not indicate 
temperature differences for static piles). 
N 2O EF3 (Table 10.21) 
According to the data examined in Pardo et al. (2015), there was no evidence to assume a lower EF for solid 
storage systems (0.005 kg N2O‚ÄìN kg‚àí1 N excreted) than for passive windrow composting (0.01 kg N2O‚ÄìN kg‚àí1N 
excreted). In fact, an EF of 0.5 percent (0.005kg N2O-N kg initial N-1) and 1 percent (0.01kg N2O-N kg initial N-
1) were found for composting-passive windrow and solid storage, respectively.   
Composting static pile, in contrast to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, was found to emit greater N2O emissions than 
passive windrows (not shown here, Fig. 3a in Pardo et al. 2015). 
For the different treatments of solid storage, whereas Pardo et al. (2015) found no different effect on N2O after 
compaction or covering, for both the addition of bulking agents or additives, a reduction of about 50 percent 
compared with conventional solid storage was observed not shown here, Figure 2a in Pardo et al. (2015). 
NH 3 losses 
For solid storage and composting relative values compared to solid storage reflect results obtained from meta-
analysis by Pardo et al. (2015) (Fig 10B.7). Ammonia and NOx default values in Table 10.22 for conventional 
solid manure storage and other systems defined both in IPCC Guidelines and EMEP/EEA (2016) have been taken 
from current EMEP/EEA air pollutant emission inventory guidebook 2016. EFs from EMEP/EEA (2016) values, 
which are expressed per TAN excreted and for each of the phases of the manure management, have been re-

calculated to be expressed as a funtion of total N excreted considering the mass balance flow between the different 
manure management phases prior to manure application (housing, yards and storage). For other categories not 
present in EMEP/CORINAIR (2016), first for stages prior to storage, we have estimated percent N lost using 
default EMEP/CORINAIR EFs for conventional manure storage and assuming no N2O or N2 losses, and 
subsequently, during storage, we used the relative effect between solid storage and the alternative solid storage 
categories (e.g. composting) (Fig 10B.7) as the basis to estimate NH3+NOx EF during storage.

NO 3 leaching and N 2 losses 
Nitrate leaching/run-off has been estimated from the database from Pardo et al. (2015). For solid storage and 
composting some of the studies included measurements of N leaching (15), some of which estimated N2 from the 
total N balance, but only one included measurements of N2 (Moral et al. 2012). As a median value about 3 percent 
is estimated to be lost as NO3 leaching/run-off (range: 0-38 percent). This value is subject to large uncertainty.  In 
fact these trials may not represent common practices where the efficiency of collection of excreta N is much lower 
and can lead to as great as 50 percent losses (e.g. Lekasi et al. 2001; Rufino et al. 2007). Nitrogen (N2) losses, 
have only been, to our knowledge, measured by Moral et al. (2012) (12 percent) and even though they could be 
estimated as a result of an N balance from trials where all N flows except N2 have been measured, the results are 
very uncertain (0-55 percent). For N2, an estimated median value of 12 percent was found; coinciding with the 
measured value by Moral et al. (2012). Systems that do not percolate but are subject to large water input will have 
greater N2 losses and lower NO3 leaching-runoff. The opposite effect will be expected with rainy areas with no 
containment and large possibilities for run-off/leaching. Values must be considered with large caution. 
A further summary review was carried out to identify run-off/leaching values from dry lots and manure pack. As 
observed in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines runoff and leaching values varied greatly citing ranges of 3 to 6 percent of 
N excreted (Eghball & Power 1994) or 5 to 19 percent (Bierman et al. 1999). In humid environments losses can 
be significant reaching 22-25 percent (Uusi-K√§mpp√§ 2002). However, uncovered holding and feeding pens without 
runoff containment tend to be in drier climates simply due to challenges in moisture control in more humid 
environments. Furthermore, considerable numbers of cattle are raised in drier climates and as a result considerably 
more studies exist looking at runoff from feedlots and drylots. Likewise recent attempts have been made to attempt 
to model these losses to the environment (Kizil et al. 2006; Williams et al. 2006). These studies tend to place the 
range of runoff loss between 1 percent and roughly 7 (Kizil et al. 2006; Erickson & Klopfenstein 2010; Vadas & 
Powell 2013). It is proposed the value of 3.5 percent with an uncertain range of 0 to 7 percent be considered as a 
default leaching factor for open, uncovered, uncontained drylots and bedded pack to provide a Tier 1 estimate of 
the fraction of N excreted lost to the environment.  
Inventory compilers must be careful to consider that this refers to N lost to the environment surrounding the pens 
or leached into the soil. If runoff is captured and returned to agricultural fields these losses must not be considered. 
In humid environments, in cases where manure is left exposed to rainfall, inventory compilers should consider the 
use of the upper bounds of the leaching fraction and furthermore to consider the development of a country specific 
leaching fraction. 
Review of the effect of slurry store solid covers and natural crust on emissions of CH 4 
and N 2O 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use  
10.168 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
The review found 18 papers dealing with the impact of solid covers or natural crusts on CH4 and/or N2O emissions 
from slurry stores. 11 of them were suitable to be included here to deduce emission factors (Amon et al. 2006; 
Clemens et al. 2006; Guarino et al. 2006; Amon et al. 2007; VanderZaag et al. 2008; VanderZaag et al. 2009; 
Aguerre et al. 2012; Nielsen et al. 2013; Hou et al. 2015; Matulaitis et al. 2015; Misselbrook et al. 2016). 
For CH4 emissions from Liquid/Slurry, the 2006 IPCC Guidelines state that by judgement of the IPCC Expert 
Group, a reduction of 40 percent due to crust cover may be applied when a thick, dry, crust is present. The new 
review carried our within the 2019 Refinement confirms this judgement (VanderZaag et al. 2008; Aguerre et al. 
2012; Nielsen et al. 2013). A solid cover reduces CH4 emissions by 25 to 50 percent (range: 0 to 90 percent) 
(Amon et al. 2006; Clemens et al. 2006; Guarino et al. 2006; Amon et al. 2007; VanderZaag et al. 2008; 
VanderZaag et al. 2009; Hou et al. 2015; Matulaitis et al. 2015; Misselbrook et al. 2016). 
For N2O emissions from  Liquid/Slurry with natural crust cover a detailed literature review carried out during the 
2019 Refinement revealed only very few new datasets on the measurement of N2O emissions from manure stores 
and the influence of crusting. These datasets agree that N2O emissions increase when a crust is formed, but do not 
give concrete numbers on the level of increase (VanderZaag et al. 2008; Aguerre et al. 2012). 
For N2O emissions from Liquid/Slurry with a cover  a detailed literature review carried out during the 2019 
Refinement revealed only few new datasets on the measurement of N2O emissions from manure stores. These 
datasets encompass a large range from a 50 percent reduction to a 100 percent increase in N2O emissions when 
slurry stores are covered. The 2019 Refinement therefore suggest to use the emission factor of crust cover (Amon 
et al. 2006; Clemens et al. 2006; Guarino et al. 2006; Amon et al. 2007; VanderZaag et al. 2009; Hou et al. 2015; 
Misselbrook et al. 2016).
