UNDERSTANDING THE COMMON
REPORTING FRAMEWORK
This chapter contains a listing, with definitions, of the categories you
should use when reporting emissions and removals. The source/sink
categories have been grouped into sectors as follows:
•
Energy
•
Industrial Processes
•
Solvent and Other Product Use
•
Agriculture
•
Land-Use Change and Forestry
•
Waste
The sectors and their source/sink categories are described and
discussed in the chapters of the Reference Manual and the modules of
the Workbook.  This chapter also contains a brief explanation of the
principles underlying the Sectoral Tables and Summary Report Tables
for reporting national inventories.

Source/sink categories
•
Users of the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines are requested to estimate
and report all anthropogenic emissions and removals of greenhouse
gases.  The numerous sources and sinks are categorised and described
on the following pages.  The source/sink categories are grouped into
the major sectors shown overleaf.  The proposed categories should
cover most activities emitting or removing greenhouse gases.
However, some countries may need to add activities to the “Other”
sector in order to cover their particular circumstances.  If so, then the
nature of the activities should be carefully described so that the list of
sectors and their source/sink categories can be updated by the IPCC at
a later date.
• All activities are limited to anthropogenic activities and related emissions
and removals.
•
Recognising that the IPCC needs to accommodate other existing
inventory programmes, Annex 2 IPCC and CORINAIR Source Categories
provides details of correspondences with CORINAIR, a programme
developed by the Commission of European Communities for use in
Europe.

Emissions within this sector comprise by-product or
fugitive emissions of greenhouse gases from industrial
processes.  Emissions from fuel combustion in
industry should be reported under Energy.
Emissions should, wherever possible, be reported
according to the ISIC Group or Class within which
they occur.

FUEL COMBUSTION
ACTIVITIES
Total emissions of all greenhouse gases from all fuel combustion activities as
described further below. CO2 emissions from combustion of biomass fuels
are not included in totals for the energy sector. They may not be net
emissions if the biomass is sustainably produced. If biomass is harvested at an
unsustainable rate (that is, faster than annual regrowth), net CO2 emissions
will appear as a loss of biomass stocks in the Land-Use Change and Forestry
module. Other greenhouse gases from biomass fuel combustion are
considered net emissions and are reported under Energy.  (Sum of I A 1 to
I A 5).  Incineration of waste for waste-to-energy facilities should be reported
here and not under Section 6C.  Emissions based upon fuel for use on ships
or aircraft engaged in international transport (1 A 3 a i and 1 A 3 d i) should,
as far as possible, not be included in national totals but reported separately.

undertakings whose primary activity is to supply the public.  They may be in
public or private ownership.  Emissions from own on-site use of fuel should
be included.  Emissions from autoproducers (undertakings which generate
electricity/heat wholly or partly for their own use, as an activity which
supports their primary activity) should be assigned to the sector where they
were generated and not under 1 A 1 a. Autoproducers may be in public or

REVISION)1
Emissions from combustion of fuels in industry including combustion for the
generation of electricity and heat.  Emissions from autoproducers should be
assigned to the sector where they were generated and an attempt made to
separately identify the emissions associated with autogeneration from those
associated with process heat. Emissions from fuel combustion in coke ovens
within the iron and steel industry should be reported under 1 A 1 c and not
within manufacturing industry.  Emissions from the industry sector should be
specified by subsectors that correspond to the International Standard
Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC).  Energy used for
transport by industry should not be reported here but under Transport
(1 A 3 below).  Emissions arising from off-road and other mobile machinery in
industry should, if possible, be broken out as a separate subcategory.  For
each country, the emissions from the largest fuel-consuming industrial
categories (ISIC) should be reported, as well as those from significant emitters
of pollutants.  A suggested list of categories is outlined below.

Civil Aviation
Emissions from international civil aviation and domestic air transport
(commercial, private, agricultural, etc.), including take-offs and landings.
Exclude use of fuel at airports for ground transport which is reported under
1 A 3 e Other Transportation (below).  Also exclude fuel for stationary
combustion at airports;  report this information under the appropriate
stationary combustion category.
i
International
Aviation
(International
Bunkers)
Emissions which relate to fuel use for international civil aviation.  Note that
these emissions are to be excluded as far as possible from national totals but
should be reported separately.  (In other inventory methodologies, landing
and take-off (LTO) cycle emissions are often considered as domestic
emissions. For the purpose of greenhouse gas emissions inventories, fuel used
during landing and take-off for an international flight stage is considered to be
part of International Bunkers fuel use.)

FUGITIVE EMISSIONS
FROM FUELS
Fugitive emissions are intentional or unintentional releases of gases from
anthropogenic activities.  In particular, they may arise from the
production, processing, transmission, storage and use of fuels, and
include emissions from combustion only where it does not support a
productive activity (e.g., flaring of natural gases at oil and gas production
facilities).  Evaporative emissions from vehicles are included under Road
Transport as Subsection 1 A 3 b v.
 Sum of 1 B 1 & 1 B 2.

2 INDUSTRIAL
PROCESSES
Emissions within this sector comprise by-product or fugitive
emissions of greenhouse gases from industrial processes.  Emissions
from fuel combustion in industry should be reported under Energy.
In instances where industrial process emissions result jointly from
chemical processes and fuel combustion it may be difficult to assign
the emission(s) to either sector.  Where the main purpose of the
fuel combustion is to use the heat released, the resulting emissions
should be assigned to the Energy sector.
Emissions should, wherever possible, be reported according to the
ISIC Group or Class within which they occur.  Certain methods in
Chapter and Module 2, however, infer final GHG emissions from
supply of the GHG, equipment containing it (for example, air
conditioning equipment) or a stock material with which emissions
are linked (for example, limestone).  In these cases, assignment of
emissions to ISIC activities may be difficult or incomplete.

The anaerobic decomposition of organic material in flooded rice fields
produces methane, which escapes to the atmosphere by ebullition (bubbling
up) through the water column, diffusion across the water/air interface, and
transport through the rice plants.  It is suggested that these CH4 emissions
be based on lowland rice ecosystems without organic amendments relating
to water regime, where lowland refers to fields flooded for a significant
period of time. Correction factors for soils with organic amendments
should be applied as necessary. Any N2O emissions from the use of

variables, soil temperature and humidity.  Any N2O emissions from the use
of nitrogen-based fertilisers in rice cultivation should be reported here.
N2O emissions may be related to the use of both organic and inorganic
fertilisers, biological Nitrogen fixation, and return of crop residues to the
field or to animal production.  Non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions
associated with the use of compost and human waste as fertilisers should
also be recorded in this category.  Emissions of N2O from sewage are to be
reported under Waste (6 B) and N2O emissions from animal waste
management systems other than grazing under manure management (4 B).
Emissions of N2O from manure used for fuel are reported under the

PRESCRIBED
BURNING OF
SAVANNAS
Emissions of CH4, CO, N2O, and NOx from the burning of savannas*.
Savannas are burned to control the growth of vegetation, remove pests and
weeds, promote the nutrient cycle and to encourage the growth of new
grass for animal grazing.  CO2 from savanna burning is noted for information
but is not included in the inventory total since it is assumed that an
equivalent amount of CO2 is removed by regrowing vegetation in the
following year.
*Savannas are tropical and subtropical formations with continuous grass
cover, occasionally interrupted by trees and shrubs, which exist in Africa,
Latin America, Asia, and Australia.
4 F
FIELD BURNING OF
AGRICULTURAL
RESIDUES
Emission of non-CO2 greenhouse gases from burning (in the field) of crop
residue and other agricultural wastes on site.  These include woody crop
residues (e.g. coconut shells, jute sticks, etc.); cereal residues (e.g. rice and
wheat straw, maize stalks, etc.);  green crop residues (e.g. groundnut straw,
soybean tops, etc.).  The burning of agricultural waste for energy is excluded
here but included under fuel combustion activities in Section 1 A.  CO2
from vegetal or biomass burning is noted for information but is not included
in the inventory total, since it is assumed that a roughly equivalent amount
of CO2 is removed by regrowth of the next crop.

CEREALS
Emissions from the on-site burning of residue from cereal crops harvested
for dry grain, including but not limited to wheat, barley, maize, oats, rye, rice,
millet and sorghum.

is intended to account for biomass which is found in locations other than
the major ecosystem types listed.  This includes dispersed trees in villages,
farms, urban areas, etc., and also includes additional ecosystem types which
may be important for biomass accounting in specific countries.
Afforestation programmes which create forests will be accounted for in the
appropriate forest ecosystem category.  Afforestation which produces
dispersed trees, e.g., urban tree planting, would be accounted for in
“Other.”

6 WASTE
Total emissions from solid waste disposal on land, wastewater,
waste incineration and any other waste management activity. Any
CO2 emissions from fossil-based products (incineration or
decomposition) should be accounted for here but see note on
double counting under Section 2 “Reporting the National
Inventory.”  CO2 from organic waste handling and decay should
not be included (see below).
Sum of  6 A, B, C & D.
6 A SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL

organic matter in solid waste disposal sites.  Carbon dioxide
(CO2) is also produced but only CO2 from non-biologic or
inorganic waste sources should be reported here.
6 A 1
MANAGED WASTE
DISPOSAL ON LAND
A managed solid waste disposal site must have controlled
placement of waste (i.e. waste directed to specific deposition
areas, a degree of control of scavenging and a degree of control
fires) and will include at least one of the following: cover material;
mechanical compaction; or levelling of the waste.

Fuel Categories
Common terms and definitions of fuels are necessary for countries to
describe emissions from fuel combustion activities consistently. A list of fuel
types is provided below. Definitions for each of these fuels are given in the
Glossary included in these Reporting Instructions. The list is organised into
five major fuel types: liquid, solid, gas, biomass and other.  It should be
noted that “other fuels” are distinct from fuels listed in the biomass fuels
category because they represent fuels that include biomass and non-biomass
components.

Reporting Major Sources at Differing
Levels of Detail: Sectoral and
Summary Report Tables.
The Sectoral and Summary Report Tables in this book allow the user to
report the inventory at different aggregate levels of detail. There are six
Sectoral Report Tables (Tables 1 to 6) to report emissions and removals at
a more detailed sub-category level. The two Summary Report Tables
(Tables 7A & 7B) are for aggregated emissions and removals, differing in
their level of detail.
Some of the main features of the Sectoral and Summary Report Tables are
summarised below.
Energy
• • If a detailed, Sectoral Approach for energy has been used for the
estimation of CO2 from fuel combustion you are still asked to
complete and report the Worksheet 1-1 from the Reference
Approach in the Workbook for verification purposes.
• Total energy emissions from both the Reference and the Sectoral
Approaches should be reported in the Sectoral and Summary Report
Tables. Do not add up CO2 emissions calculated from both
approaches. An explanation of any significant differences between
these results should be provided.
• Countries are asked to report emissions from international aviation and
marine bunkers and CO2 from biomass for energy under Memo Items.
Emissions from International Bunkers should not be included in
national totals. CO2 emissions from the combustion of biomass fuels
are accounted for in the Land-Use Change and Forestry Sector, if the
wood has been produced unsustainably.
Industrial Processes
• HFCs, PFCs and SF6 should be reported in two ways, as potential and
actual emissions.
Notation Key
• As far as possible, countries should use the  Sectoral and Summary
Report Tables outlined in this document to summarise final inventory
results. The notation shown in the key (see box) should be used to
show where countries believe the identified source is zero (0). Where
countries have opted not to estimate (NE) a particular source of each
greenhouse gas, this should be shown. Data problems may limit the
possibility of separating out each source individually; in this case it is
included elsewhere (IE) and this should also be included in the table with
a footnote indicating where the emission source/sink has been reported.
Finally, countries may report a particular category as not occurring
(NO) in their country.
Additional Gases
•
To avoid duplication of effort, reporting of substances covered under
the Montreal Protocol is not required.  However, countries wishing to

report these substances and additional gases for completeness may do
so, using the spare copies of the Summary Report Tables where the
column headings have been left blank.
Overview
•
The Overview Table (8A) should be used by countries to summarise
their own assessment of completeness (e.g. partial, full estimate, not
estimated) and quality (high, medium or low) of major source/sink
inventory estimates. It gives a brief overview of the categories that have
been taken into account in the emission inventory, as well as the level of
documentation and disaggregation of the categories (see the Notation
Key for a full explanation). The Disaggregation Key (8B) which follows
the Overview Table gives a detailed explanation of the key used for the
level of disaggregation for an inventory.
Data Completeness
•
In all tables used by countries to summarise their inventory data,
footnotes should be added to indicate if emission estimates are
incomplete, or representative of only a part of the total activity, for any
particular source or sink category.  In this way countries are expected
to report on the completeness of each individual emission estimate.
1.4
Worksheets
Worksheets are essential for transparency and reconstruction of the
inventory.
Remember to provide all worksheets, containing at least activity
data and emission factors, used to prepare the inventory for each
sector, along with Sectoral and Summary Report Tables.
