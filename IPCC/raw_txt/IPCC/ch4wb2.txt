Prescribed Burning of Savannas
4 . 4 . 1  I n t r o d u c t i o n
Savannas are tropical and subtropical formations with continuous grass coverage.
The growth of savannas is controlled by alternating wet and dry seasons: most of
the growth occurs during the wet season.  Man-made and/or natural fires
frequently occur during the dry season, resulting in nutrient recycling and
regrowth.  Large scale burning takes place primarily in the humid savannas
because the arid savannas lack sufficient grass cover to sustain fire.  Savannas are
burned every one to four years on average, with the highest frequency in the
humid savannas of Africa.
The burning of savannas results in instantaneous emissions of carbon dioxide.
However, because the vegetation regrows between the burning cycles, the
carbon dioxide released to the atmosphere is reabsorbed during the next
vegetation growth period.  Therefore, this Workbook assumes that CO2 net
emissions are zero.
The burning of savannas also releases gases other than CO2, including
methane, carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide and oxides of nitrogen.  Unlike
CO2 emissions these are net anthropogenic emissions and should be
accounted for.
4 . 4 . 2  D a t a  s o u r c e s
There are no routinely published data on the amount of savanna burned, but
several assessment papers have been published.  The FAO Forest Resource
Assessment 1990: Tropical Countries (FAO 1993) provides country estimates
of savanna (grassland) area and the Greenhouse Gas Inventory Reference Manual
provides additional references.
4 . 4 . 3  M e t h o d o l o g y
The non-CO2 trace gas emissions from savanna burning may be estimated
through a series of simple calculations using either locally available data or
defaults provided in the tables in this Workbook.
First the quantity of biomass that actually burns is calculated by multiplying
area of savanna burned by average biomass density and by the fraction of
exposed biomass which actually burns.
Second, carbon released is calculated multiplying quantity of biomass burned
by fraction oxidised and then by carbon fraction.
The second calculation can be greatly improved by first dividing the quantity
of biomass burned into living and dead fractions.  The calculation is then
carried out for each of these fractions using different fractions oxidised and
carbon contents for the living and dead fractions.
DEGRADED SAVANNAS
Although the default assumption is
that biomass burned on savannas
regrows in a short period, this may
not always be the case.  Sometimes
savannas are burned too often, or
for other reasons fail to recover
completely.  Over time savannas can
degrade significantly as a result of
human intervention.  In this case
there will be a long-term loss of
carbon in aboveground biomass and
soils.  If this is occurring, the annual
carbon loss should be accounted for,
if possible, in addition to the
information 
requested 
in 
the
Workbook.
NON-METHANE VOLATILE
ORGANIC COMPOUNDS
NMVOCs are emitted in significant
quantities from biomass burning.
These emissions should be estimated
using the same approach provided
for other non-CO2 gases.  However,
the default information has not yet
been developed to include this class
of gases in the Workbook.  This is an
area to be considered in future
improvements to the Guidelines.

Third, several ratios are applied to total carbon released to derive estimates
of non-CO2 trace gas emissions, as follows:
•
a nitrogen-carbon ratio is applied to estimate total nitrogen content
•
ratios for CH4 and CO as fractions of total carbon
•
ratios of N2O and NOx as fractions of total nitrogen
The resulting estimates of emissions are converted to total weight (i.e., from
CH4 as C to CH4 total) using standard factors.
One country may possess more than one type of savanna with different
characteristics; burns may vary in efficiency; and burns may take place at
different times during the dry season, causing the burning to vary with the
state of the vegetation (such as the moisture content and whether the
biomass is alive or dead).
If data are locally available savanna burned should be subdivided into relevant
subcategories reflecting these variations and entered into the worksheet.  If
you are relying on the default values in this Workbook you will only be able
to carry out calculations at a national level.

Use WORKSHEET 4-3 PRESCRIBED BURNING OF SAVANNAS at the end of this
module to record inventory data.  You should do this for a single national
average category or subdivide if data are locally available for each relevant
subcategory of savanna.
1
For each category of savanna, enter the Area Burned (in kilohectares) in
column A.
If possible use locally available data for hectares of savanna burned
annually.  If this is not possible, a crude default approach is to determine
the total savanna area and multiply by typical regional defaults for
percentage burned annually from Table 4-12 (below).
FRACTIONS
In order to determine the amount of
savanna biomass that actually oxidises
to release carbon to the atmosphere,
several fractions must be applied
sequentially.  To start with, the
quantity of biomass exposed to fire is
calculated by multiplying the area of
savanna burned in the inventory year
by the average biomass density (in
tonnes of dry matter per hectare).
The fractions are then applied as
follows.
Fraction which Actually Burns
Under 
normal 
open 
burning
conditions all biomass in each hectare
does not actually burn.  The Fraction
which Actually Burns (generally 0.80 -
0.85 but may be higher in very dry
regions) is applied to derive the
kilotonnes of dry matter which
actually burn.
Fraction Oxidised
This next fraction to be applied
expresses the biomass that oxidises.
Not all of the burning biomass
oxidises - a small fraction may remain
as charcoal.  The fraction oxidised is
usually 0.8 to 1.0.
Carbon Fraction
The last fraction to be applied
determines the amount of carbon
that is released from the fraction of
biomass which has oxidised.

CATEGORIES OF SAVANNAS
A number of users of the draft
Guidelines, particularly in Africa, have
suggested that savannas should be
divided into woody savannas and
grasslands if possible.  For woody
savannas, the aboveground biomass
densities prior to burning would be
higher and the fraction oxidised
should be lower, as much of the
standing woody biomass would not
be burned.  Other subcategories by
region, time of burning, etc. may also
be useful.

Field Burning of Agric ult ural
Residues
4 . 5 . 1  I n t r o d u c t i o n
Large quantities of agricultural residues are produced from farming systems
world-wide.  Burning of crop residues in the fields is a common agricultural
practice, particularly in developing countries.  It has been estimated that as
much as 40 per cent of the residues produced in developing countries may
be burned in fields, while the percentage is lower in developed countries.  It
is important to note that some crop residues are removed from the fields
and burned as a source of energy, especially in developing countries.
Emissions from this type of burning are calculated in the Energy module of
this Workbook.  Users should ensure that residue burning is properly
allocated to these two components and not double counted.
This submodule deals exclusively with emissions of methane, carbon
monoxide, nitrous oxide and nitrogen oxides from crop residues.  In this
Workbook, field burning of crop residues is not treated as a net source of
carbon dioxide because it is assumed that the carbon released to the
atmosphere is reabsorbed during the next growing season.  However crop
residue burning is a significant net source of emissions of methane, carbon
monoxide, nitrous oxide and nitrogen oxides.
4 . 5 . 2  D a t a  s o u r c e s
Annual crop production statistics by country for most of the crops from
which residues are burned may be found in FAO Production Year Books
(e.g., FAO, 1991).  Crop specific data for each country on ratios of residue
to crop production, fraction of residue burned, dry matter content of
residue and carbon and nitrogen contents of residue should be provided by
individual countries if available.  Table 4-15 Selected Crop Residue Statistics
shows default data for crop residues.

the ratio is 44/28 and for NOx it is 46/14.  NO2 has been used as the

systems including (1) direct emissions of N2O from agricultural soils
(including glasshouse systems farming and excluding effects of grazing
animals) (2) direct soil emissions of N2O from animal production and (3)
indirect emissions of N2O from nitrogen used in agriculture.  The
calculations can be performed in 9 steps in Worksheet 4-5.
