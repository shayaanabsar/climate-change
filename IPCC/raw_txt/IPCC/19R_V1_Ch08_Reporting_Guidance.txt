8 REPORTING GUIDANCE AND TABLES 
Users are expected to go to Mapping Tables in Annex 1, before reading this chapter. This is required to correctly 
understand both the refinements made and how the elements in this chapter relate to the corresponding chapter 
in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.

REPORTING GUIDANCE 
8.2.1 
Coverage 
Anthropogenic emissions and removals 
The 2006 IPCC Guidelines and its 2019 Refinement are designed to estimate and report on national inventories of 
anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and removals. Anthropogenic emissions and removals means that 
greenhouse gas emissions and removals included in national inventories are a result of human activities.  
National inventory 
National inventories should include greenhouse gas emissions and removals taking place within national territory 
and offshore areas over which the country has jurisdiction. There are, however, some specific issues to be taken 
into account: 
• 
Emissions from fuel for use on ships or aircraft engaged in international transport should not be included in 
national totals. To ensure global completeness, these emissions should be reported separately.  
• 
In cases of road transport that crosses national borders, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from road 
transportation should be attributed to the country where the fuel is sold to the end user. The same allocation 
principle can be applied to methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from road transportation by 
their sources depending on the methodology tier used to estimate emissions.  
• 
Fishing includes emissions from fuel used in inland, coastal and deep sea fishing. Emissions resulting from 
fuel used in coastal and deep sea fishing should be allocated to the country delivering the fuel. 
• 
Military fuel use is reported under “1A5 Non-specified”, and this category includes fuel deliveries for all 
mobile and stationary consumption (e.g., ships, aircraft, road and energy used in living quarters) of the country. 
Emissions from multilateral operations pursuant to the Charter of the United Nations are not included in 
national totals. It is good practice to document clearly which activities have been included under the category 
multilateral operations and report as memo item in the reporting tables. 
• 
Fugitive emissions from pipelines transporting, e.g., oil, gas, or CO2, should be allocated according to the 
national territory of the pipeline, including offshore areas. This implies that emissions from one pipeline may 
be distributed between two or more countries.  
• 
Emissions associated with the injection and possible subsequent leakage of CO2 stored in geological 
formations should be linked to the country in whose national jurisdiction or by whose international right the 
point of injection is located. This includes any emissions arising from leakage of CO2 from a geological 
formation that crosses a national boundary. 
• 
The IPCC methodology for carbon stored in non-fuel products manufactured from fossil fuels or other non-
biogenic sources of carbon takes into account emissions released from their production, use and destruction. 
Emissions are estimated at each stage when and where they occur, for example in waste incineration.  
• 
Where CO2 emissions are captured from industrial processes or large combustion sources, captured emissions 
should be allocated to the sector generating the CO2 unless it can be shown that the CO2 is stored in properly 
monitored geological storage sites as set out in Chapter 5 of Volume 2. CO2 emissions captured for use, e.g. 
in greenhouses and industry, and transported offsite should be allocated to the sector where the CO2 was 
captured. If in the process of using captured CO2, emissions (fugitive) occur, then such emissions should be 
reported where the use of CO2 occurs.

8.5 
• 
CO2 emissions from biomass combustion for energy are reported in the energy sector as memo item and 
estimated and reported in the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) Sector as part of net changes 
in carbon stocks. The capture of biogenic CO2 emissions from biomass combustion, or other processes, should 
be treated consistently with CO2 capture from fossil fuel combustion and reported in the Energy and/or IPPU 
Sectors. Once captured, and added to the carbon capture and storage process there is no differentiated 
treatment between biogenic carbon and fossil carbon. Both captured biogenic and fossil CO2 should not be 
added to the total emissions, i.e. net emissions should be reported (also see Section 5.3 of Chapter 5 in Volume 
2 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines). Non-CO2 emissions from biomass combustion are reported in the Energy 
Sector. Non-CO2 fugitive emissions from production of fuels (e.g. charcoal or biochar) are reported in the 
Energy Sector (see Table 4.3.1 in Chapter 4, Volume 2 for the correct allocation of non-CO2 fugitive emissions 
from fuel transformation).   
• 
When reporting harvested wood products (HWP), countries can select any of the approaches reflected in 
Chapter 12 of Volume 4 for the AFOLU Sector when estimating their emissions/removals from HWP. 
• 
Indirect N2O emissions resulting from atmospheric deposition of volatilised N is allocated to the country 
emitting nitrogen oxides and ammonia. Similarly, indirect N2O emissions from leaching/run-off are allocated 
to the country where leaching/run-off of nitrogen (mainly in the form of nitrate) occurs. It is assumed that the 
indirect N2O is emitted in the same year as the N losses occur through volatilisation and leaching/runoff.   
• 
When reporting total national emissions and removals (Table A: Summary Table), for those countries that 
choose to implement the approach described in Section 2.6, Volume 4, it is good practice to report the total 
Managed Land Proxy (MLP) emissions and removals, as well as the emissions and removals associated with 
human activity on managed land. 
• 
When reporting total national emissions and removals, for those countries that choose to implement the 
approach described in Section 7.3.3, Volume 4, it is good practice to report the total MLP emissions and 
removals, as well as the indicative estimates of the anthropogenic component of total emissions. Emissions 
estimated for the categories in the 2013 Supplement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse 
Gas Inventories: Wetlands (Wetlands Supplement) are included in the land use categories forestland, cropland, 
grassland as well as wastewater treatment and discharge. Wetlands Supplement provides guidance on reporting 
these categories and the sub-categories contained in the supplement (IPCC 2014). 
8.2.2 
Gases included  
The 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (2019 Refinement) 
can be applied for the following two groups of greenhouse gases1: 
 
Greenhouse gases with a GWP in an IPCC Assessment Report and not covered 
by Annexes A through E of the Montreal Protocol 
In addition to the greenhouse gases included in the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines, gases for which global warming 
potential (GWP) values are given in one of the IPCC Assessment Reports are included in the 2019 Refinement 
unless they are covered by Annexes A through E of the Montreal Protocol. Annex F of the Montreal Protocol lists 
hydrofluorocarbons, which are included in the 2019 Refinement. Please refer to the Glossary for the definition of 
GWPs and their relevance in estimating greenhouse gas emissions. 
The greenhouse gases included are: 
• 
carbon dioxide (CO2); 
• 
methane (CH4); 
• 
nitrous oxide (N2O); 
• 
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs: e.g., HFC-23 (CHF3), HFC-134a (CH2FCF3), HFC-152a (CH3CHF2), HFC-
1234yf (CF3CF=CH2)), including hydrofluoro-olefins (HFOs: e.g. HFC-1234yf, HFC-1234ze) and (HFCO-
1233zd); 
• 
perfluorocarbons (PFCs: e.g., CF4, C2F6, C3F8, C4F6, C4F10, c-C4F8, C5F12, C6F14);    
                                                           
1  In a few cases, although methods are available, the 2006 IPCC Guidelines do not provide default emission factors for all 
category-gas combinations due to limited research or literature. If a country expects that emissions of these gases occur in a 
category for which no default emission factors are provided, it is good practice to explore the feasibility of developing 
country-specific data in order to include these emissions in the inventory. If it is not possible to develop country-specific 
data, countries should provide documentation that these emissions occur but were not estimated.

• 
sulphur hexafluoride (SF6); 
• 
nitrogen trifluoride (NF3); 
• 
trifluoromethyl sulphur pentafluoride (SF5CF3); 
• 
halogenated ethers (e.g., C4F9OC2H5, CHF2OCF2OC2F4OCHF2, CHF2OCF2OCHF2, 
CF3OCF(CF3)CF2OCF2OCF3 (PFPMIE)); 
• 
other halocarbons not covered by the Montreal Protocol including, for example CF3I, CH2Br2, CHCl3, CH3Cl, 
CH2Cl2.  
Other halogenated greenhouse gases not covered by Annexes A through E of the 
Montreal Protocol 
The 2019 Refinement also provides estimation methods for halogenated greenhouse gases which are not covered 
by the Annexes A through E of the Montreal Protocol and for which GWP values were not available from IPCC 
Assessment Reports at the time the 2019 Refinement was developed. Examples of such GHGs include: 
• 
c- C4F8O; 
• 
perfluorotripropylamine, perfluoromethylmorpholine, 3-ethoxy-1,1,1,2,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,6-dodecafluoro-2-
trifluoromethyl-hexane, and other heat transfer fluids used in electronics.2 
These and other greenhouse gases can only be considered in key category analysis or included in national total 
emissions using GWP values from subsequent Assessment Reports of the IPCC. If these GWP values are not yet 
available countries are encouraged to provide estimates for them in mass units using the methods provided in the 
2006 IPCC Guidelines, as updated and elaborated by the 2019 Refinement. Reporting tables are provided for this 
purpose. It is good practice to use the same set of GWPs from a single IPCC assessment report for the entire time 
series.  
Other gases 
Emissions of the ozone precursors nitrogen oxide (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) and 
carbon monoxide (CO) and the aerosol precursors sulphur dioxide (SO2) and ammonia (NH3) should be reported in 
the appropriate tables if the country has prepared an inventory of these gases. Box 8.1 gives brief explanation of these 
gases. 
BOX 8.1 (UPDATED) 
REPORTING EMISSIONS OF PRECURSORS3 
NOx includes NO and NO2 reported in NO2 mass equivalents. 
SO2 includes all sulphur compounds expressed in SO2 mass equivalents.  
NMVOC means all organic compounds of an anthropogenic nature, other than methane, that are 
capable of producing photochemical oxidants by reaction with nitrogen oxides in the presence of 
sunlight. 
NH3 is reported in NH3 mass units.

2  The first two compounds are marketed under the Fluorinert™ trade name, along with other fully fluorinated compounds such 
as alkanes, other tertiary amines and aminoethers. The last compound is marketed under the Novec Engineered FluidTM 
tradename. Heat transfer fluids marketed under the Galden tradename consist of PFPMIEs similar to the PFPMIE distillate 
for which GWPs are provided in the Fourth and Fifth IPCC Assessment Reports.  
3  Guidance on reporting and definitions are consistent with the 2002 reporting guidelines of the Convention on Long-Range 
Transboundary Air Pollution, available in Air Pollution Studies series, No.15, 2003. (http://www.emep.int/index.html).

It is good practice to summarise the aggregated inventory data from different years in the trend tables (Table 6A 
to 6G).  
It is good practice to perform recalculations of the time series in cases of methodological changes and refinement 
(follow Section 5.2 of Volume 1, Chapter 5 of the 2019 Refinement for guidance on recalculations).

INTRODUCTION TO REPORTING TABLES  
The reporting tables in Annex 8A.2 are designed to ensure that inventory compilers can report quantitative data in 
a standard format and to facilitate consistency between countries, categories, gases and years.  
The set of inventory reporting tables consist of: 
Summary and short summary tables 
Summary and short summary tables allow the inventory compiler to report all emissions and removals at 
aggregated level for an overview of national totals for the actual year.  
The summary tables also allow reporting of memo items including international bunkers and multilateral 
operations. These emissions are not included in national total emissions of greenhouse gases.    
Two tables are included: 
 
Table A  
Summary table 
 
 
Table B  
Short summary table  
 
Sectoral and background tables  
Sectoral tables enable reporting of emissions and removals, for all relevant categories and subcategories listed in 
Table 8.2. Background tables allow reporting of activity data and related emissions at the subcategory level to 
facilitate transparency and consistency of information. Information items that are usually not themselves emissions, 
for example carbon dioxide stored long-term in the storage sites, are reported separately as additional information 
under respective sectors for increased transparency.  
The following tables are included:

Waste Background Tables 
Cross-sectoral table 
Cross-sectoral tables enable inventory compilers to report indirect emissions of N2O. Indirect emissions are 
reported in separate columns of Cross-sectoral Table 5A. 
 
Table 5A  
Cross-sectoral Table: Indirect emissions of N2O  
Emission trend tables by gas  
Trend tables enable inventory compilers to report all greenhouse gas emissions and removals at an aggregated 
level for entire inventory period. It is good practice to complete trend tables if an inventory is available, even if 
the information is not complete. Reporting of emission trends can help inventory compilers to track time series 
consistency of the estimates.

CLASSIFICATION AND DEFINITION OF 
CATEGORIES  
Table 8.2 introduces the classification and definition of categories and subcategories4 of emissions and removals 
(consistent with the sectoral, sectoral background and cross-sectoral tables provided in Annex 8A.2). The 
correspondence with the reporting categories of the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines is also provided in the third 
column of Table 8.2. A fourth column identifies gases that may be relevant to each category. Additional guidance 
on gases is provided in Volumes 2-5 and in Table 7.1 of Chapter 7 of this Volume for indirect gases5. 
 
 
 
                                                           
4  The nomenclature for the levels within the category list is: category, subcategory - 1st order, subcategory - 2nd order, 
subcategory – 3rd order, etc. 
5  In order to facilitate transparent reporting of emissions of non-CO2 gases and CO2 emissions from liming in the AFOLU 
Sector, reporting is based on aggregated categories (3C) taking into account that data may not be available to report those 
emissions by land.

Production and Upgrading 
Fugitive emissions from oil production (including venting and

This includes fugitive emissions related to well servicing, oil 
sands or shale oil mining, transport of untreated production 
(i.e., well effluent, emulsion, oil shale and oil sands) to 
treating or extraction facilities, activities at extraction and 
upgrading facilities, associated gas re-injection systems and 
produced water disposal systems. Fugitive emission from 
upgraders are grouped with those from production rather 
than those from refining since the upgraders are often 
integrated with extraction facilities and their relative emission 
contributions are difficult to establish. However, upgraders 
may also be integrated with refineries, co-generation plants 
or other industrial facilities and their relative emission

2 B 1  Ammonia Production 
Ammonia (NH3) is a major industrial chemical and the most 
important nitrogenous material produced. Ammonia gas is 
used directly as a fertilizer, in heat treating, paper pulping, 
nitric acid and nitrates manufacture, nitric acid ester and nitro 
compound manufacture, explosives of various types, and as 
a refrigerant. Amines, amides, and miscellaneous other 
organic compounds, such as urea, are made from ammonia. 
The main greenhouse gas emitted from NH3 production is 
CO2. CO2 used in the production of urea, a downstream 
process, should be subtracted from the CO2 generated and 
accounted for in the AFOLU Sector.

The production of carbide can result in emissions of CO2, 
CH4, CO and SO2. Silicon carbide is a significant artificial 
abrasive. It is produced from silica sand or quartz and 
petroleum coke. Calcium carbide is used in the production of 
acetylene, in the manufacture of cyanamide (a minor 
historical use), and as a reductant in electric arc steel 
furnaces. It is made from calcium carbonate (limestone) and 
carbon-containing reductant (petroleum coke).

process is the chloride route, giving rise to CO2 emissions 
that are likely to be significant. This category also includes 
synthetic rutile production using the Becher process, and 
titanium slag production, both of which are reduction 
processes using fossil fuels and resulting in CO2 emissions.

industries including glass manufacture, soap and detergents, 
pulp and paper production and water treatment. Emissions 
of CO2 from the production of soda ash vary dependent on 
the manufacturing process. Four different processes may be 
used to produce soda ash. Three of these processes, 
monohydrate, sodium sesquicarbonate (trona) and direct 
carbonation, are referred to as natural processes. The fourth, 
the Solvay process, is classified as a synthetic process.

Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) emissions are not associated with 
primary aluminium production; however, casting of some 
high magnesium containing alloys does result in SF6 
emissions and these emissions are accounted for in Section 
2C4, Magnesium Production. CO2 emissions  
from alumina production via the Bayer process are 
accounted for in Section 1A, Fuel Combustion Activities and 
Section 2A2, Lime Production; however, exceptions are 
alumina production via alternative Bayer-Sintering (BSS and

2 C 4  Magnesium Production 
Magnesium production covers GHG emissions related to 
both primary magnesium production as well as oxidation 
protection of magnesium metal during processing (recycling 
and casting), excluding those emissions relating to fuel use. 
In the primary production of magnesium, carbon dioxide 
(CO2) is emitted during calcination of dolomite and 
magnesite raw materials. Primary production of magnesium 
from non-carbonate raw materials does not emit carbon 
dioxide. In the processing of liquid magnesium, cover gases 
containing carbon dioxide (CO2), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), 
the hydrofluorocarbon HFC 134a or the fluorinated ketone 
FK 5-1-12 (C3F7C(O)C2F5) may be used. Partial thermal 
decomposition and/or reaction between these compounds 
and liquid magnesium generates secondary compounds 
such as perfluorocarbons (PFCs), which are emitted in 
addition to unreacted cover gas constituents.

2 C 6  Zinc Production 
Zinc production covers emissions from both primary

Following calcination, zinc metal is produced through one of 
three 
methods: 
1-electro-thermic 
distillation, 
2-pyro-
metallurgical smelting or 3-electrolysis. If method 1 or 2 is 
used, carbon dioxide (CO2) is emitted. Method 3 does not 
result in carbon dioxide emissions. Recovery of zinc from 
metal scrap often uses the same methods as primary 
production and may thus produce carbon dioxide emissions, 
which is included in this section.

2 F 1  Refrigeration and Air Conditioning 
Refrigeration and air-conditioning systems are usually 
classified in six application domains or categories. These 
categories utilise different technologies such as heat 
exchangers, expansion devices, pipings and compressors. 
The six application domains are domestic refrigeration, 
commercial refrigeration, industrial processes, transport 
refrigeration, 
stationary 
air 
conditioning, 
mobile 
air-
conditioning systems. For all these applications, various 
HFCs are selectively replacing CFCs and HCFCs. For 
example, in developed countries, HFC-134a has replaced 
CFC-12 in domestic refrigeration and mobile air conditioning 
systems, and blends of HFCs such as R-407C (HFC-
32/HFC-125/HFC-134a) and R-410A (HFC-32/HFC-125) 
are replacing HCFC-22 mainly in stationary air conditioning. 
Other, non HFC substances are used to replace CFCs and 
HCFCs such as iso-butane in domestic refrigeration or 
ammonia in industrial refrigeration. HFC-152a is also being 
considered for mobile air conditioning in several regions.

2 F 2  Foam Blowing Agents 
HFCs are being used as replacements for CFCs and HCFCs 
in foams, particularly in closed-cell insulation applications. 
Compounds that are being used include HFC-245fa, HFC-
365mfc, HFC-227ea, HFC-134a, and HFC-152a. The 
processes and applications for which these various HFCs 
are being used include insulation boards and panels, pipe 
sections, sprayed systems and one-component gap filling 
foams. For open-cell foams, such as integral skin products 
for automotive steering wheels and facias, emissions of 
HFCs used as blowing agents are likely to occur during the 
manufacturing process. In closed-cell foam, emissions not 
only occur during the manufacturing phase, but usually 
extend into the in-use phase and often the majority of 
emission occurs at the end-of-life (de-commissioning 
losses). Accordingly, emissions can occur over a period of 
up to 50 years or even longer.

2 F 3  Fire Protection 
There are two general types of fire protection (fire 
suppression) equipment that use greenhouse gases as 
partial replacements for halons: portable (streaming) 
equipment, and fixed (flooding) equipment. The non-ozone 
depleting, industrial gases HFCs, PFCs and more recently a 
fluoroketone are mainly used as substitutes for halons, 
typically halon 1301, in flooding equipment. PFCs played an 
early role in halon 1301 replacement but current use is 
limited to replenishment of previously installed systems. 
HFCs in portable equipment, typically replacing halon 1211, 
are available but have achieved very limited market 
acceptance due primarily to their high cost. PFC use in new 
portable extinguishers is currently limited to a small amount 
(few percent) in an HCFC blend.

2 F 4  Aerosols  
Most aerosol packages now contain hydrocarbon (HC) as 
propellants but, in a small fraction of the total, HFCs and 
PFCs may be used as propellants or solvents. Emissions 
from aerosols usually occur shortly after production, on 
average six months after sale. During the use of aerosols, 
100% of the chemical is emitted. The 5 main sources are 
metered dose inhalers (MDIs), personal care products (e.g. 
hair care, deodorant, shaving cream), household products 
(e.g. air-fresheners, oven and fabric cleaners), industrial 
products (e.g. special cleaning sprays such as those for 
operating electrical contact, lubricants, pipe-freezers) and 
other general products (e.g. silly string, tire inflators, 
claxons), although in some regions the use of such general 
products is restricted. The HFCs currently used as 
propellants are HFC 134a, HFC 227ea, and HFC 152a. The 
substance HFC 43 10mee and a PFC, perfluorohexane, are 
used as solvents in industrial aerosol products.

2 F 5  Solvents 
HFCs and, to a much lesser extent PFCs, are being used as 
substitutes for ozone depleting substances (most notably 
CFC-113). Typical HFCs used are HFC-365mfc and HFC-
43-10mee. Use of these fluorinated replacements is much 
less widespread than the ozone depleting substances they 
replace. Re-capture and re-use is also much more widely 
practiced The primary areas of use are precision cleaning, 
electronics cleaning, metal cleaning and deposition 
applications. Emissions from aerosols containing solvents 
should be reported under category 2F4 "Aerosols" rather 
than under this category.

The properties of ozone depleting substances have made 
them attractive for a variety of niche applications not covered 
in other sub-source categories. These include electronics 
testing, 
heat 
transfer, 
dielectric 
fluid 
and 
medical 
applications. The properties of HFCs and PFCs are equally 
attractive in some of these sectors and they have been 
adopted as substitutes. There are also some historical uses 
of PFCs, as well as emerging use of HFCs, in these 
applications. These applications have leakage rates ranging 
from 100% emissive in year of application to around 1% per 
annum.

applications, especially for mobile devices such as 
smartphones and tablets to prevent damage by accidental 
exposure to water, and in demanding environments, such as 
automotive and aerospace, to protect from the ingress of 
moisture. In all situations, the ingress of water could short-

Flooded Land 
Emissions from flooded land remaining flooded land. 
Flooded lands are defined as water bodies where human 
activities have caused changes in the amount of surface area 
covered by water, typically through water level regulation. 
Examples of flooded lands include reservoirs for the 
production of hydroelectricity, irrigation, navigation, etc. 
Regulated lakes and rivers that have not experienced 
substantial changes in water area in comparison with the 
pre-flooded ecosystem are not considered as flooded lands. 
Some rice paddies are cultivated through flooding of land, 
but because of the unique characteristics of rice cultivation, 
rice paddies are addressed in 3C7.

(1) Under the 2006 IPCC Guidelines and its 2019 Refinement, emissions from the use of carbonates should be reported in the 
subcategories (industries) where they occur. Therefore, part of emissions that were reported in 2A3 or 2A4 under the 
Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines should be reported in various relevant subcategories (for example 2C1) under the 2006 
IPCC Guidelines. In this column of this table, however, the 96GLs Category Code 2A3 and 2A4 are entered not 
everywhere possibly relevant, for the sake of simplicity. 
 
Note: NA or blank cells under the column ‘96 GLs category code’: categories that are not defined in Revised 1996 IPCC
