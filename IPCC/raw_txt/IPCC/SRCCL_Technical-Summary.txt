 Introduction
This Technical Summary to the IPCC Special Report on Climate 
Change and Land  (SRCCL)1 comprises a compilation of the chapter 
executive summaries illustrated with figures from the report. It 
follows the structure of the SRCCL (Figure TS.1) and is presented 
in seven parts. TS.1 (Chapter 1) provides a synopsis of the main 
issues addressed in the Special Report, introducing key concepts 
and definitions and highlighting where the report builds on 
previous publications. TS.2 (Chapter 2) focuses on the dynamics of 
the land–climate system (Figure TS.2). It assesses recent progress 
towards understanding the impacts of climate change on land, and 
the feedbacks land has on climate and which arise from altered 
biogeochemical and biophysical fluxes between the atmosphere and 
the land surface. TS.3 (Chapter 3) examines how the world’s dryland 
populations are uniquely vulnerable to desertification and climate 
change, but also have significant knowledge in adapting to climate 
variability and addressing desertification. TS.4 (Chapter 4) assesses 
the urgency of tackling land degradation across all land ecosystems. 
Despite accelerating trends of land degradation, reversing these 
trends is attainable through restoration efforts and improved land 
management, which is expected to improve resilience to climate 
change, mitigate climate change, and ensure food security for 
generations to come. TS.5 (Chapter 5) focuses on food security, 
with an assessment of the risks and opportunities that climate 
change presents to food systems. It considers how mitigation and 
adaptation can contribute to both human and planetary health. TS.6 
(Chapter 6) introduces options for responding to the challenges of 
desertification, land degradation and food security and evaluates the 
trade-offs for sustainable land management, climate adaptation and 
mitigation, and the sustainable development goals. TS.7 (Chapter 7) 
further assesses decision making and policy responses to risks in the 
climate-land-human system. 
TS.1  
Framing and context
Land, including its water bodies, provides the basis for human 
livelihoods and well-being through primary productivity, the 
supply of food, freshwater, and multiple other ecosystem 
services (high confidence). Neither our individual or societal 
identities, nor the world’s economy would exist without the 
multiple resources, services and livelihood systems provided by 
land ecosystems and biodiversity. The annual value of the world’s 
total terrestrial ecosystem services has been estimated at 75 trillion 
USD in 2011, approximately equivalent to the annual global Gross 
Domestic Product (based on USD2007 values) (medium confidence). 
Land and its biodiversity also represent essential, intangible benefits 
to humans, such as cognitive and spiritual enrichment, sense of 
belonging and aesthetic and recreational values. Valuing ecosystem 
services with monetary methods often overlooks these intangible 
services that shape societies, cultures and quality of life and the 
intrinsic value of biodiversity. The Earth’s land area is finite. Using 
land resources sustainably is fundamental for human well-being 
(high confidence). {1.1.1}
The current geographic spread of the use of land, the large 
appropriation of multiple ecosystem services and the loss 
of biodiversity are unprecedented in human history (high 
confidence). By 2015, about three-quarters of the global ice-free land 
surface was affected by human use. Humans appropriate one-quarter 
to one-third of global terrestrial potential net primary production 
(high confidence). Croplands cover 12–14% of the global ice-free 
surface. Since 1961, the supply of global per capita food calories 
increased by about one-third, with the consumption of vegetable 
oils and meat more than doubling. At the same time, the use of 
inorganic nitrogen fertiliser increased by nearly ninefold, and the use 
of irrigation water roughly doubled (high confidence). Human use, 
at varying intensities, affects about 60–85% of forests and 70–90% 
of other natural ecosystems (e.g., savannahs, natural grasslands) 
(high confidence). Land use caused global biodiversity to decrease by 
around 11–14% (medium confidence). (Figure TS.2). {1.1.2}

Technical Summary
TS
Warming over land has occurred at a faster rate than the global 
mean and this has had observable impacts on the land system 
(high confidence). The average temperature over land for the period 
2006–2015 was 1.53°C higher than for the period 1850–1900, and 
0.66°C larger than the equivalent global mean temperature change. 
These warmer temperatures (with changing precipitation patterns) 
have altered the start and end of growing seasons, contributed to 
regional crop yield reductions, reduced freshwater availability, and 
put biodiversity under further stress and increased tree mortality (high 
confidence). Increasing levels of atmospheric CO2, have contributed 
to observed increases in plant growth as well as to increases in woody 
plant cover in grasslands and savannahs (medium confidence). {1.1.2}
Urgent action to stop and reverse the over-exploitation of 
land resources would buffer the negative impacts of multiple 
pressures, including climate change, on ecosystems and society 
(high confidence). Socio-economic drivers of land use change such 
as technological development, population growth and increasing 
per capita demand for multiple ecosystem services are projected to 
continue into the future (high confidence). These and other drivers 
can amplify existing environmental and societal challenges, such 
as the conversion of natural ecosystems into managed land, rapid 
urbanisation, pollution from the intensification of land management 
and equitable access to land resources (high confidence). Climate 
change will add to these challenges through direct, negative impacts 
on ecosystems and the services they provide (high confidence). Acting 
immediately and simultaneously on these multiple drivers would 
enhance food, fibre and water security, alleviate desertification, and 
reverse land degradation, without compromising the non-material or 
regulating benefits from land (high confidence). {1.1.2, 1.2.1, 1.3.2–
1.3.6, Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1}
Rapid reductions in anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions that restrict warming to “well-below” 2°C would 
greatly reduce the negative impacts of climate change on 
land ecosystems (high confidence). In the absence of rapid 
emissions reductions, reliance on large-scale, land-based, 
climate change mitigation is projected to increase, which 
would aggravate existing pressures on land (high confidence). 
Climate change mitigation efforts that require large land areas (e.g., 
bioenergy and afforestation/reforestation) are projected to compete 
with existing uses of land (high confidence). The competition for 
land could increase food prices and lead to further intensification 
(e.g., fertiliser and water use) with implications for water and air 
pollution, and the further loss of biodiversity (medium confidence). 
Such consequences would jeopardise societies’ capacity to achieve 
many Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) that depend on land 
(high confidence). {1.3.1, Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 1}
Nonetheless, there are many land-related climate change 
mitigation options that do not increase the competition for 
land (high confidence). Many of these options have co-benefits 
for climate change adaptation (medium confidence). Land use 
contributes about one-quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions, 
notably CO2 emissions from deforestation, CH4 emissions from rice 
and ruminant livestock and N2O emissions from fertiliser use (high 
confidence). Land ecosystems also take up large amounts of carbon 
(high confidence). Many land management options exist to both 
reduce the magnitude of emissions and enhance carbon uptake. These 
options enhance crop productivity, soil nutrient status, microclimate 
or biodiversity, and thus, support adaptation to climate change (high 
confidence). In addition, changes in consumer behaviour, such as 
reducing the over-consumption of food and energy would benefit the 
reduction of GHG emissions from land (high confidence). The barriers 
to the implementation of mitigation and adaptation options include 
skills deficit, financial and institutional barriers, absence of incentives, 
access to relevant technologies, consumer awareness and the limited 
spatial scale at which the success of these practices and methods 
have been demonstrated. {1.2.1, 1.3.2, 1.3.3, 1.3.4, 1.3.5, 1.3.6}
Sustainable food supply and food consumption, based on 
nutritionally balanced and diverse diets, would enhance 
food security under climate and socio-economic changes 
(high confidence). Improving food access, utilisation, quality and 
safety to enhance nutrition, and promoting globally equitable diets 
compatible with lower emissions have demonstrable positive impacts 
on land use and food security (high confidence). Food security is also 
negatively affected by food loss and waste (estimated as 25–30% of 
total food produced) (medium confidence). Barriers to improved food 
security include economic drivers (prices, availability and stability of 
supply) and traditional, social and cultural norms around food eating 
practices. Climate change is expected to increase variability in food 
production and prices globally (high confidence), but the trade in food 
commodities can buffer these effects. Trade can provide embodied

The annual time series in B and D–F are based on the most comprehensive, available data from national statistics, in most cases from FAOSTAT which starts in 1961. 
Y-axes in panels D–F are expressed relative to the starting year of the time series (rebased to zero). Data sources and notes: A: The warming curves are averages of 
four datasets {2.1; Figure 2.2; Table 2.1} B: N2O and CH4 from agriculture are from FAOSTAT; Net CO2 emissions from FOLU using the mean of two bookkeeping models 
(including emissions from peatland fires since 1997). All values expressed in units of CO2-eq are based on AR5 100-year Global Warming Potential values without 
climate-carbon feedbacks (N2O = 265; CH4 = 28). {see Table SPM.1, 1.1, 2.3} C: Depicts shares of different uses of the global, ice-free land area for approximately the 
year 2015, ordered along a gradient of decreasing land-use intensity from left to right. Each bar represents a broad land cover category; the numbers on top are the total

‘forest managed for timber and other uses’ was calculated as total forest area minus ‘primary/intact’ forest area. {1.2, Table 1.1, Figure 1.3} D: Note that fertiliser use is 
shown on a split axis. The large percentage change in fertiliser use reflects the low level of use in 1961 and relates to both increasing fertiliser input per area as well as 
the expansion of fertilised cropland and grassland to increase food production. {1.1, Figure 1.3} E: Overweight population is defined as having a body mass index (BMI) 
>25 kg m-2; underweight is defined as BMI <18.5 kg m-2. {5.1, 5.2} F: Dryland areas were estimated using TerraClimate precipitation and potential evapotranspiration 
(1980–2015) to identify areas where the Aridity Index is below 0.65. Population data are from the HYDE3.2 database. Areas in drought are based on the 12-month 
accumulation Global Precipitation Climatology Centre Drought Index. The inland wetland extent (including peatlands) is based on aggregated data from more than 2000 
time series that report changes in local wetland area over time. {3.1, 4.2, 4.6}

flows of water, land and nutrients (medium confidence). Food 
trade can also have negative environmental impacts by displacing 
the effects of overconsumption (medium confidence). Future food 
systems and trade patterns will be shaped as much by policies as by 
economics (medium confidence). {1.2.1, 1.3.3}
A gender-inclusive approach offers opportunities to enhance 
the sustainable management of land (medium confidence). 
Women play a significant role in agriculture and rural economies 
globally. In many world regions, laws, cultural restrictions, patriarchy 
and social structures such as discriminatory customary laws and norms 
reduce women’s capacity in supporting the sustainable use of land 
resources (medium confidence). Therefore, acknowledging women’s 
land rights and bringing women’s land management knowledge into 
land-related decision-making would support the alleviation of land 
degradation, and facilitate the take-up of integrated adaptation and 
mitigation measures (medium confidence). {1.4.1, 1.4.2}
Regional and country specific contexts affect the capacity to 
respond to climate change and its impacts, through adaptation 
and mitigation (high confidence). There is large variability in the 
availability and use of land resources between regions, countries and 
land management systems. In addition, differences in socio-economic 
conditions, such as wealth, degree of industrialisation, institutions 
and governance, affect the capacity to respond to climate change, 
food insecurity, land degradation and desertification. The capacity 
to respond is also strongly affected by local land ownership. Hence, 
climate change will affect regions and communities differently (high 
confidence). {1.3, 1.4}
Cross-scale, cross-sectoral and inclusive governance can 
enable coordinated policy that supports effective adaptation 
and mitigation (high confidence). There is a lack of coordination 
across governance levels, for example, local, national, transboundary 
and international, in addressing climate change and sustainable 
land management challenges. Policy design and formulation is often 
strongly sectoral, which poses further barriers when integrating 
international decisions into relevant (sub)national policies. 
A portfolio of policy instruments that are inclusive of the diversity 
of governance actors would enable responses to complex land and 
climate challenges (high confidence). Inclusive governance that 
considers women’s and indigenous people’s rights to access and use 
land enhances the equitable sharing of land resources, fosters food 
security and increases the existing knowledge about land use, which 
can increase opportunities for adaptation and mitigation (medium 
confidence). {1.3.5, 1.4.1, 1.4.2, 1.4.3}
Scenarios and models are important tools to explore the 
trade-offs and co-benefits of land management decisions 
under uncertain futures (high confidence). Participatory, co-
creation processes with stakeholders can facilitate the use of 
scenarios in designing future sustainable development strategies 
(medium confidence). In addition to qualitative approaches, models 
are critical in quantifying scenarios, but uncertainties in models arise 
from, for example, differences in baseline datasets, land cover classes 
and modelling paradigms (medium confidence). Current scenario 
approaches are limited in quantifying time-dependent policy and 
management decisions that can lead from today to desirable futures 
or visions. Advances in scenario analysis and modelling are needed to 
better account for full environmental costs and non-monetary values 
as part of human decision-making processes. {1.2.2, Cross-Chapter

Land–climate interactions 
Implications of climate change, variability
and extremes for land systems
It is certain that globally averaged land surface air 
temperature (LSAT) has risen faster than the global mean 
surface temperature (i.e., combined LSAT and sea surface 
temperature) from the preindustrial period (1850–1900) to 
the present day (1999–2018). According to the single longest 
and most extensive dataset, from 1850–1900 to 2006–2015 
mean land surface air temperature has increased by 1.53°C 
(very likely range from 1.38°C to 1.68°C) while global mean 
surface temperature has increased by 0.87°C (likely range 
from 0.75°C to 0.99°C). For the 1881–2018 period, when four 
independently produced datasets exist, the LSAT increase 
was 1.41°C (1.31–1.51°C), where the range represents the 
spread in the datasets’ median estimates. Analyses of paleo 
records, historical observations, model simulations and underlying 
physical principles are all in agreement that LSATs are increasing 
at a higher rate than SST as a result of differences in evaporation, 
land–climate feedbacks and changes in the aerosol forcing over land 
(very high confi dence). For the 2000–2016 period, the land-to-ocean 
warming ratio (about 1.6) is in close agreement between different 
observational records and the CMIP5 climate model simulations (the 
likely range of 1.54–1.81). {2.2.1}
Anthropogenic warming has resulted in shifts of climate 
zones, primarily as an increase in dry climates and decrease 
of polar climates (high confi dence). Ongoing warming is 
projected to result in new, hot climates in tropical regions and 
to shift climate zones poleward in the mid- to high latitude 
and upward in regions of higher elevation (high confi dence).
Ecosystems in these regions will become increasingly exposed to 
temperature and rainfall extremes beyond the climate regimes they 
are currently adapted to (high confi dence), which can alter their 
structure, composition and functioning. Additionally, high-latitude 
warming is projected to accelerate permafrost thawing and increase 
disturbance in boreal forests through abiotic (e.g., drought, fi re) 
and biotic (e.g., pests, disease) agents (high confi dence). {2.2.1, 
2.2.2, 2.5.3}
Globally, greening trends (trends of increased photosynthetic 
activity in vegetation) have increased over the last 2–3 decades 
by 22–33%, particularly over China, India, many parts of 
Europe, central North America, southeast Brazil and southeast 
Australia (high confi dence). This results from a combination of direct 
(i.e., land use and management, forest conservation and expansion) 
and indirect factors (i.e., CO2 fertilisation, extended growing season, 
global warming, nitrogen deposition, increase of diffuse radiation) 
linked to human activities (high confi dence). Browning trends (trends 
of decreasing photosynthetic activity) are projected in many regions 
where increases in drought and heatwaves are projected in a warmer 
climate. There is low confi dence in the projections of global greening 
and browning trends. {2.2.4, Cross-Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 2}
Figure TS.3 |  The structure and functioning of managed and unmanaged ecosystems that affect local, regional and global climate. Land surface 
characteristics such as albedo and emissivity determine the amount of solar and long-wave radiation absorbed by land and reﬂ ected or emitted to the atmosphere. Surface 
roughness inﬂ uences turbulent exchanges of momentum, energy, water and biogeochemical tracers. Land ecosystems modulate the atmospheric composition through 
emissions and removals of many GHGs and precursors of SLCFs, including biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) and mineral dust. Atmospheric aerosols formed 
from these precursors affect regional climate by altering the amounts of precipitation and radiation reaching land surfaces through their role in clouds physics.

Technical Summary
TS
The frequency and intensity of some extreme weather and 
climate events have increased as a consequence of global 
warming and will continue to increase under medium and high 
emission scenarios (high confidence). Recent heat-related events, 
for example, heatwaves, have been made more frequent or intense 
due to anthropogenic GHG emissions in most land regions and the 
frequency and intensity of drought has increased in Amazonia, north-
eastern Brazil, the Mediterranean, Patagonia, most of Africa and 
north-eastern China (medium confidence). Heatwaves are projected 
to increase in frequency, intensity and duration in most parts of 
the world (high confidence) and drought frequency and intensity is 
projected to increase in some regions that are already drought prone, 
predominantly in the Mediterranean, central Europe, the southern 
Amazon and southern Africa (medium confidence). These changes 
will impact ecosystems, food security and land processes including 
GHG fluxes (high confidence). {2.2.5}
Climate change is playing an increasing role in determining 
wildfire 
regimes 
alongside 
human 
activity 
(medium 
confidence), with future climate variability expected to 
enhance the risk and severity of wildfires in many biomes such 
as tropical rainforests (high confidence). Fire weather seasons 
have lengthened globally between 1979 and 2013 (low confidence). 
Global land area burned has declined in recent decades, mainly due 
to less burning in grasslands and savannahs (high confidence). While 
drought remains the dominant driver of fire emissions, there has 
recently been increased fire activity in some tropical and temperate 
regions during normal to wetter than average years due to warmer 
temperatures that increase vegetation flammability (medium 
confidence). The boreal zone is also experiencing larger and more 
frequent fires, and this may increase under a warmer climate (medium 
confidence). {Cross-Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 2}
Terrestrial greenhouse gas fluxes on unmanaged and 
managed lands
Agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) is a significant 
net source of GHG emissions (high confidence), contributing 
to about 23% of anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide 
(CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) combined as 
CO2 equivalents in 2007–2016 (medium confidence). AFOLU 
results in both emissions and removals of CO2, CH4 and N2O to and 
from the atmosphere (high confidence). These fluxes are affected 
simultaneously by natural and human drivers, making it difficult to 
separate natural from anthropogenic fluxes (very high confidence). 
(Figure TS.3) {2.3}
The total net land-atmosphere flux of CO2 on both managed 
and unmanaged lands very likely provided a global net 
removal from 2007 to 2016 according to models (-6.0 ± 3.7 
GtCO2 yr–1, likely range). This net removal is comprised of two major 
components: (i) modelled net anthropogenic emissions from AFOLU 
are 5.2 ± 2.6 GtCO2 yr–1 (likely range) driven by land cover change, 
including deforestation and afforestation/reforestation, and wood 
harvesting (accounting for about 13% of total net anthropogenic 
emissions of CO2) (medium confidence), and (ii) modelled net removals 
due to non-anthropogenic processes are 11.2 ± 2.6 GtCO2 yr–1 (likely 
range) on managed and unmanaged lands, driven by environmental 
changes such as increasing CO2, nitrogen deposition and changes in 
climate (accounting for a removal of 29% of the CO2 emitted from 
all anthropogenic activities (fossil fuel, industry and AFOLU) (medium 
confidence). {2.3.1}
Global models and national GHG inventories use different 
methods to estimate anthropogenic CO2 emissions and 
removals for the land sector. Consideration of differences 
in methods can enhance understanding of land sector net 
emission such as under the Paris Agreement’s global stocktake 
(medium confidence). Both models and inventories produce 
estimates that are in close agreement for land-use change involving 
forest (e.g., deforestation, afforestation), and differ for managed 
forest. Global models consider as managed forest those lands that 
were subject to harvest whereas, consistent with IPCC guidelines, 
national GHG inventories define managed forest more broadly. On 
this larger area, inventories can also consider the natural response 
of land to human-induced environmental changes as anthropogenic, 
while the global model approach treats this response as part of 
the non-anthropogenic sink. For illustration, from 2005 to 2014, 
the sum of the national GHG inventories net emission estimates is 
0.1  ±  1.0  GtCO2 yr–1, while the mean of two global bookkeeping 
models is 5.1 ± 2.6 GtCO2yr–1 (likely range). {Table SPM.1}
The gross emissions from AFOLU (one-third of total global 
emissions) are more indicative of mitigation potential of 
reduced deforestation than the global net emissions (13% 
of total global emissions), which include compensating 
deforestation and afforestation fluxes (high confidence). The 
net flux of CO2 from AFOLU is composed of two opposing gross fluxes: 
(i) gross emissions (20 GtCO2 yr–1) from deforestation, cultivation of 
soils and oxidation of wood products, and (ii) gross removals (–14 
GtCO2 yr–1), largely from forest growth following wood harvest and 
agricultural abandonment (medium confidence). (Figure TS.4) {2.3.1}
Land is a net source of CH4, accounting for 44% of anthropogenic 
CH4 emissions for the 2006–2017 period (medium confidence). 
The pause in the rise of atmospheric CH4 concentrations between 
2000 and 2006 and the subsequent renewed increase appear to be 
partially associated with land use and land use change. The recent 
depletion trend of the 13C isotope in the atmosphere indicates that 
higher biogenic sources explain part of the current CH4 increase and 
that biogenic sources make up a  larger proportion of the source 
mix than they did before 2000 (high confidence). In agreement 
with the findings of AR5, tropical wetlands and peatlands continue 
to be important drivers of inter-annual variability and current CH4 
concentration increases (medium evidence, high agreement). 
Ruminants and the expansion of rice cultivation are also important 
contributors to the current trend (medium evidence, high agreement). 
There is significant and ongoing accumulation of CH4 in the 
atmosphere (very high confidence). {2.3.2}

Technical Summary
TS
AFOLU is the main anthropogenic source of N2O primarily due 
to nitrogen application to soils (high confi dence). In croplands, 
the main driver of N2O emissions is a lack of synchronisation between 
crop nitrogen demand and soil nitrogen supply, with approximately 
50% of the nitrogen applied to agricultural land not taken up by the 
crop. Cropland soils emit over 3 MtN2O-N yr–1 (medium confi dence). 
Because the response of N2O emissions to fertiliser application rates 
is non-linear, in regions of the world where low nitrogen application 
rates dominate, such as sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Eastern 
Europe, increases in nitrogen fertiliser use would generate relatively 
small increases in agricultural N2O emissions. Decreases in application 
rates in regions where application rates are high and exceed crop 
demand for parts of the growing season will have very large effects 
on emissions reductions (medium evidence, high agreement). {2.3.3}
While managed pastures make up only one-quarter of 
grazing lands, they contributed more than three-quarters of 
N2O emissions from grazing lands between 1961 and 2014 
with rapid recent increases of nitrogen inputs resulting 
in disproportionate growth in emissions from these lands 
(medium confi dence). Grazing lands (pastures and rangelands) 
are responsible for more than one-third of total anthropogenic N2O 
emissions or more than one-half of agricultural emissions (high 
confi dence). Emissions are largely from North America, Europe, 
East Asia, and South Asia, but hotspots are shifting from Europe to 
southern Asia (medium confi dence). {2.3.3}
Increased emissions from vegetation and soils due to climate 
change in the future are expected to counteract potential sinks 
due to CO2 fertilisation (low confi dence). Responses of vegetation 
and soil organic carbon (SOC) to rising atmospheric CO2 concentration 
and climate change are not well constrained by observations (medium 
confi dence). Nutrient (e.g.,  nitrogen, phosphorus) availability can 
limit future plant growth and carbon storage under rising CO2 
(high confi dence). However, new evidence suggests that ecosystem 
adaptation through plant-microbe symbioses could alleviate some 
nitrogen limitation (medium evidence, high agreement). Warming of 
soils and increased litter inputs will accelerate carbon losses through 
microbial respiration (high confi dence). Thawing of high latitude/
altitude permafrost will increase rates of SOC loss and change the 
balance between CO2 and CH4 emissions (medium confi dence). The 
balance between increased respiration in warmer climates and 
carbon uptake from enhanced plant growth is a key uncertainty for 
the size of the future land carbon sink (medium confi dence). {2.3.1, 
2.7.2, Box 2.3}
Biophysical and biogeochemical land forcing and feedbacks to 
the climate system
Changes in land conditions from human use or climate change 
in turn affect regional and global climate (high confi dence). On 
the global scale, this is driven by changes in emissions or removals of 
CO2, CH4 and N2O by land (biogeochemical effects) and by changes 
in the surface albedo (very high confi dence). Any local land changes

that redistribute energy and water vapour between the land and 
the atmosphere influence regional climate (biophysical effects; 
high confidence). However, there is no confidence in whether such 
biophysical effects influence global climate. {2.1, 2.3, 2.5.1, 2.5.2}
Changes in land conditions modulate the likelihood, intensity 
and duration of many extreme events including heatwaves 
(high confidence) and heavy precipitation events (medium 
confidence). Dry soil conditions favour or strengthen summer 
heatwave conditions through reduced evapotranspiration and 
increased sensible heat. By contrast wet soil conditions, for example 
from irrigation or crop management practices that maintain a cover 
crop all year round, can dampen extreme warm events through 
increased evapotranspiration and reduced sensible heat. Droughts 
can be intensified by poor land management. Urbanisation increases 
extreme rainfall events over or downwind of cities (medium 
confidence). {2.5.1, 2.5.2, 2.5.3}
Historical changes in anthropogenic land cover have resulted 
in a mean annual global warming of surface air from 
biogeochemical effects (very high confidence), dampened 
by a cooling from biophysical effects (medium confidence). 
Biogeochemical warming results from increased emissions of GHGs 
by land, with model-based estimates of +0.20 ± 0.05°C (global 
climate models) and +0.24 ± 0.12°C – dynamic global vegetation 
models (DGVMs) as well as an observation-based estimate of +0.25 
± 0.10°C. A net biophysical cooling of –0.10 ± 0.14°C has been 
derived from global climate models in response to the increased 
surface albedo and decreased turbulent heat fluxes, but it is smaller 
than the warming effect from land-based emissions. However, when 
both biogeochemical and biophysical effects are accounted for within 
the same global climate model, the models do not agree on the sign 
of the net change in mean annual surface air temperature. {2.3, 2.5.1, 
Box 2.1}
The future projected changes in anthropogenic land cover that 
have been examined for AR5 would result in a biogeochemical 
warming and a biophysical cooling whose magnitudes depend 
on the scenario (high confidence). Biogeochemical warming has 
been projected for RCP8.5 by both global climate models (+0.20 ± 
0.15°C) and DGVMs (+0.28 ± 0.11°C) (high confidence). A global 
biophysical cooling of 0.10 ± 0.14°C is estimated from global climate 
models and is projected to dampen the land-based warming (low 
confidence). For RCP4.5, the biogeochemical warming estimated 
from global climate models (+0.12 ± 0.17°C) is stronger than the 
warming estimated by DGVMs (+0.01 ± 0.04°C) but based on limited 
evidence, as is the biophysical cooling (–0.10 ± 0.21°C). {2.5.2}
Regional climate change can be dampened or enhanced by 
changes in local land cover and land use (high confidence) 
but this depends on the location and the season (high 
confidence). In boreal regions, for example, where projected climate 
change will migrate the treeline northward, increase the growing 
season length and thaw permafrost, regional winter warming will 
be enhanced by decreased surface albedo and snow, whereas 
warming will be dampened during the growing season due to larger 
evapotranspiration (high confidence). In the tropics, wherever climate 
change will increase rainfall, vegetation growth and associated 
increase in evapotranspiration will result in a dampening effect on 
regional warming (medium confidence). {2.5.2, 2.5.3}
According to model-based studies, changes in local land 
cover or available water from irrigation will affect climate in 
regions as far as few hundreds of kilometres downwind (high 
confidence). The local redistribution of water and energy following 
the changes on land affect the horizontal and vertical gradients of 
temperature, pressure and moisture, thus altering regional winds and 
consequently moisture and temperature advection and convection 
and subsequently, precipitation. {2.5.2, 2.5.4, Cross-Chapter Box 4 
in Chapter 2}
Future increases in both climate change and urbanisation will 
enhance warming in cities and their surroundings (urban heat 
island), especially during heatwaves (high confidence). Urban 
and peri-urban agriculture, and more generally urban greening, can 
contribute to mitigation (medium confidence) as well as to adaptation 
(high confidence), with co-benefits for food security and reduced soil-
water-air pollution. {Cross-Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 2}
Regional climate is strongly affected by natural land aerosols 
(medium confidence) (e.g., mineral dust, black, brown and 
organic carbon), but there is low confidence in historical trends, 
inter-annual and decadal variability and future changes. Forest 
cover affects climate through emissions of biogenic volatile organic 
compounds (BVOC) and aerosols (low confidence). The decrease 
in the emissions of BVOC resulting from the historical conversion 
of forests to cropland has resulted in a positive radiative forcing 
through direct and indirect aerosol effects, a negative radiative 
forcing through the reduction in the atmospheric lifetime of methane 
and it has contributed to increased ozone concentrations in different 
regions (low confidence). {2.4, 2.5}
Consequences for the climate system of land-based adaptation 
and mitigation options, including carbon dioxide removal 
(negative emissions)
About one-quarter of the 2030 mitigation pledged by countries 
in their initial Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) 
under the Paris Agreement is expected to come from land-
based mitigation options (medium confidence). Most of the 
NDCs submitted by countries include land-based mitigation, although 
many lack details. Several refer explicitly to reduced deforestation 
and forest sinks, while a few include soil carbon sequestration, 
agricultural management and bioenergy. Full implementation of 
NDCs (submitted by February 2016) is expected to result in net 
removals of 0.4–1.3 GtCO2 y–1 in 2030 compared to the net flux in 
2010, where the range represents low to high mitigation ambition 
in pledges, not uncertainty in estimates (medium confidence). {2.6.3}

Technical Summary
TS
Several mitigation response options have technical potential 
for >3 GtCO2-eq yr–1 by 2050 through reduced emissions and 
Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) (high confidence), some of 
which compete for land and other resources, while others 
may reduce the demand for land (high confidence). Estimates 
of the technical potential of individual response options are not 
necessarily additive. The largest potential for reducing AFOLU 
emissions are through reduced deforestation and forest degradation 
(0.4–5.8 GtCO2-eq yr–1) (high confidence), a shift towards plant-
based diets (0.7–8.0 GtCO2-eq yr–1) (high confidence) and reduced 
food and agricultural waste (0.8–4.5 CO2-eq yr–1) (high confidence). 
Agriculture measures combined could mitigate 0.3–3.4 GtCO2-eq yr–1 
(medium confidence). The options with largest potential for CDR 
are afforestation/reforestation (0.5–10.1 CO2-eq yr–1) (medium 
confidence), soil carbon sequestration in croplands and grasslands 
(0.4–8.6 CO2-eq yr–1) (high confidence) and Bioenergy with Carbon 
Capture and Storage (BECCS) (0.4–11.3 CO2-eq yr–1) (medium 
confidence). While some estimates include sustainability and cost 
considerations, most do not include socio-economic barriers, the 
impacts of future climate change or non-GHG climate forcings. {2.6.1}
Response options intended to mitigate global warming 
will also affect the climate locally and regionally through 
biophysical effects (high confidence). Expansion of forest area, 
for example, typically removes CO2 from the atmosphere and thus 
dampens global warming (biogeochemical effect, high confidence), 
but the biophysical effects can dampen or enhance regional warming 
depending on location, season and time of day. During the growing 
season, afforestation generally brings cooler days from increased 
evapotranspiration, and warmer nights (high confidence). During 
the dormant season, forests are warmer than any other land cover, 
especially in snow-covered areas where forest cover reduces albedo 
(high confidence). At the global level, the temperature effects of 
boreal afforestation/reforestation run counter to GHG effects, while 
in the tropics they enhance GHG effects. In addition, trees locally 
dampen the amplitude of heat extremes (medium confidence). {2.5.2, 
2.5.4, 2.7, Cross-Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 2}
Mitigation response options related to land use are a key 
element of most modelled scenarios that provide strong 
mitigation, alongside emissions reduction in other sectors 
(high confidence). More stringent climate targets rely more 
heavily on land-based mitigation options, in particular, CDR 
(high confidence). Across a range of scenarios in 2100, CDR is 
delivered by both afforestation (median values of –1.3, –1.7 and –2.4 
GtCO2yr–1 for scenarios RCP4.5, RCP2.6 and RCP1.9 respectively) and 
BECCS (–6.5, –11 and –14.9 GtCO2 yr–1 respectively). Emissions of 
CH4 and N2O are reduced through improved agricultural and livestock 
management as well as dietary shifts away from emission-intensive 
livestock products by 133.2, 108.4 and 73.5 MtCH4 yr–1; and 7.4, 
6.1 and 4.5 MtN2O yr–1 for the same set of scenarios in 2100 (high 
confidence). High levels of bioenergy crop production can result 
in increased N2O emissions due to fertiliser use. The Integrated 
Assessment Models that produce these scenarios mostly neglect 
the biophysical effects of land-use on global and regional warming. 
{2.5, 2.6.2}
Large-scale implementation of mitigation response options 
that limit warming to 1.5 or 2°C would require conversion 
of large areas of land for afforestation/reforestation and 
bioenergy crops, which could lead to short-term carbon losses 
(high confidence). The change of global forest area in mitigation 
pathways ranges from about –0.2 to +7.2 Mkm2 between 2010 
and 2100 (median values across a range of models and scenarios: 
RCP4.5, RCP2.6, RCP1.9), and the land demand for bioenergy crops 
ranges from about 3.2 to 6.6 Mkm2 in 2100 (high confidence). Large-
scale land-based CDR is associated with multiple feasibility and 
sustainability constraints. In high carbon lands such as forests and 
peatlands, the carbon benefits of land protection are greater in the 
short-term than converting land to bioenergy crops for BECCS, which 
can take several harvest cycles to ‘pay-back’ the carbon emitted 
during conversion (carbon-debt), from decades to over a century 
(medium confidence). (Figure TS.5) {2.6.2, Chapters 6, 7}
It is possible to achieve climate change targets with low need 
for land-demanding CDR such as BECCS, but such scenarios 
rely more on rapidly reduced emissions or CDR from forests, 
agriculture and other sectors. Terrestrial CDR has the technical 
potential to balance emissions that are difficult to eliminate 
with current technologies (including food production). Scenarios 
that achieve climate change targets with less need for terrestrial 
CDR rely on agricultural demand-side changes (diet change, 
waste reduction), and changes in agricultural production such as 
agricultural intensification. Such pathways that minimise land use for 
bioenergy and BECCS are characterised by rapid and early reduction 
of GHG emissions in all sectors, as well as earlier CDR in through 
afforestation. In contrast, delayed mitigation action would increase 
reliance on land-based CDR (high confidence). {2.6.2}
Figure TS.5 (continued): Mitigation potentials reflect the full range of low to high estimates from studies published after 2010, differentiated according to technical 
(possible with current technologies), economic (possible given economic constraints) and sustainable potential (technical or economic potential constrained by 
sustainability considerations). Medians are calculated across all potentials in categories with more than four data points. We only include references that explicitly 
provide mitigation potential estimates in CO2-eq yr–1 (or a similar derivative) by 2050. Not all options for land management potentials are additive, as some may 
compete for land. Estimates reflect a range of methodologies (including definitions, global warming potentials and time horizons) that may not be directly comparable 
or additive. Results from IAMs are shown to compare with single option ‘bottom-up’ estimates, in available categories from the 2°C and 1.5°C scenarios in the SSP 
Database (version 2.0). The models reflect land management changes, yet in some instances, can also reflect demand-side effects from carbon prices, so may not be 
defined exclusively as ‘supply-side’.

TS.3 Desertification
Desertification is land degradation in arid, semi-arid, and dry 
sub-humid areas, collectively known as drylands, resulting 
from many factors, including human activities and climatic 
variations. The range and intensity of desertification have 
increased in some dryland areas over the past several decades 
(high confidence). Drylands currently cover about 46.2% (±0.8%) 
of the global land area and are home to 3 billion people. The 
multiplicity and complexity of the processes of desertification make 
its quantification difficult. Desertification hotspots, as identified by 
a decline in vegetation productivity between the 1980s and 2000s, 
extended to about 9.2% of drylands (±0.5%), affecting about 500 
(±120) million people in 2015. The highest numbers of people affected 
are in South and East Asia, the circum Sahara region including 
North Africa and the Middle East including the Arabian Peninsula 
(low confidence). Other dryland regions have also experienced 
desertification. Desertification has already reduced agricultural 
productivity and incomes (high confidence) and contributed to the 
loss of biodiversity in some dryland regions (medium confidence). 
In many dryland areas, spread of invasive plants has led to losses 
in ecosystem services (high confidence), while over-extraction is 
leading to groundwater depletion (high confidence). Unsustainable 
land management, particularly when coupled with droughts, has 
contributed to higher dust-storm activity, reducing human well-
being in drylands and beyond (high confidence). Dust storms were 
associated with global cardiopulmonary mortality of about 402,000 
people in 2005. Higher intensity of sand storms and sand dune 
movements are causing disruption and damage to transportation and 
solar and wind energy harvesting infrastructures (high confidence). 
(Figure TS.6) {3.1.1, 3.1.4, 3.2.1, 3.3.1, 3.4.1, 3.4.2, 3.4.2, 3.7.3, 3.7.4}
Attribution of desertification to climate variability and 
change, and to human activities, varies in space and time (high 
confidence). Climate variability and anthropogenic climate change, 
particularly through increases in both land surface air temperature 
and evapotranspiration, and decreases in precipitation, are likely to 
have played a role, in interaction with human activities, in causing 
desertification in some dryland areas. The major human drivers of 
desertification interacting with climate change are expansion of 
croplands, unsustainable land management practices and increased 
pressure on land from population and income growth. Poverty is 
limiting both capacities to adapt to climate change and availability of 
financial resources to invest in sustainable land management (SLM) 
(high confidence). {3.1.4, 3.2.2, 3.4.2}
Climate change will exacerbate several desertification 
processes (medium confidence). Although CO2 fertilisation effect 
is enhancing vegetation productivity in drylands (high confidence), 
decreases in water availability have a larger effect than CO2 
fertilisation in many dryland areas. There is high confidence that 
aridity will increase in some places, but no evidence for a projected 
global trend in dryland aridity (medium confidence). The area at risk 
of salinisation is projected to increase in the future (limited evidence, 
high agreement). Future climate change is projected to increase the 
potential for water driven soil erosion in many dryland areas (medium 
confidence), leading to soil organic carbon decline in some dryland 
areas. {3.1.1, 3.2.2, 3.5.1, 3.5.2, 3.7.1, 3.7.3}
Risks from desertification are projected to increase due to 
climate change (high confidence). Under shared socio-economic 
pathway SSP2 (‘Middle of the Road’) at 1.5°C, 2°C and 3°C of global 
warming, the number of dryland population exposed (vulnerable) 
to various impacts related to water, energy and land sectors (e.g. 
water stress, drought intensity, habitat degradation) is projected 
to reach 951 (178) million, 1152 (220) million and 1285 (277) 
million, respectively. While at global warming of 2°C, under SSP1 
(‘Sustainability’), the exposed (vulnerable) dryland population is 974 
(35) million, and under SSP3 (‘Fragmented World’) it is 1267 (522) 
million. Around half of the vulnerable population is in South Asia, 
followed by Central Asia, West Africa and East Asia. {2.2, 3.1.1, 3.2.2, 
3.5.1, 3.5.2, 7.2.2} 
Desertification and climate change, both individually and in 
combination, will reduce the provision of dryland ecosystem 
services and lower ecosystem health, including losses in 
biodiversity (high confidence). Desertification and changing 
climate are projected to cause reductions in crop and livestock 
productivity (high confidence), modify the composition of plant 
species and reduce biological diversity across drylands (medium 
confidence). Rising CO2 levels will favour more rapid expansion of 
some invasive plant species in some regions. A reduction in the 
quality and quantity of resources available to herbivores can have 
knock-on consequences for predators, which can potentially lead to 
disruptive ecological cascades (limited evidence, low agreement). 
Projected increases in temperature and the severity of drought 
events across some dryland areas can increase chances of wildfire 
occurrence (medium confidence). {3.1.4, 3.4.1, 3.5.2, 3.7.3}
Increasing human pressures on land, combined with climate 
change, will reduce the resilience of dryland populations and 
constrain their adaptive capacities (medium confidence). 
The combination of pressures coming from climate variability, 
anthropogenic climate change and desertification will contribute 
to poverty, food insecurity, and increased disease burden (high 
confidence), as well as potentially to conflicts (low confidence). 
Although strong impacts of climate change on migration in dryland 
areas are disputed (medium evidence, low agreement), in some 
places, desertification under changing climate can provide an added 
incentive to migrate (medium confidence). Women will be impacted 
more than men by environmental degradation, particularly in those 
areas with higher dependence on agricultural livelihoods (medium 
evidence, high agreement). {3.4.2, 3.6.2}
Desertification exacerbates climate change through several 
mechanisms such as changes in vegetation cover, sand and 
dust aerosols and greenhouse gas fluxes (high confidence). 
The extent of areas in which dryness (rather than temperature) 
controls CO2 exchange has increased by 6% between 1948 and 
2012, and is projected to increase by at least another 8% by 
2050 if the expansion continues at the same rate. In these 
areas, net carbon uptake is about 27% lower than in other 
areas (low confidence). Desertification also tends to increase

albedo, decreasing the energy available at the surface and associated 
surface temperatures, producing a negative feedback on climate 
change (high confi dence). Through its effect on vegetation and soils, 
desertifi cation changes the absorption and release of associated 
greenhouse gases (GHGs). Vegetation loss and drying of surface 
cover due to desertifi cation increases the frequency of dust storms 
(high confi dence). Arid ecosystems could be an important global 
carbon sink, depending on soil water availability (medium evidence, 
high agreement). {3.3.3, 3.4.1, 3.5.2}
Site and regionally-specifi c technological solutions, based 
both on new scientifi c innovations and indigenous and local 
knowledge (ILK), are available to avoid, reduce and reverse 
desertifi cation, simultaneously contributing to climate change 
mitigation and adaptation (high confi dence). SLM practices in 
drylands increase agricultural productivity and contribute to climate 
change adaptation with mitigation co-benefi ts (high confi dence). 
Integrated crop, soil and water management measures can be 
employed to reduce soil degradation and increase the resilience of 
agricultural production systems to the impacts of climate change 
(high confi dence). These measures include crop diversifi cation 
and adoption of drought-resilient econogically appropriate plants, 
reduced tillage, adoption of improved irrigation techniques (e.g. 
drip irrigation) and moisture conservation methods (e.g. rainwater 
harvesting using indigenous and local practices), and maintaining 
vegetation and mulch cover. Conservation agriculture increases the 
capacity of agricultural households to adapt to climate change (high 
confi dence) and can lead to increases in soil organic carbon over time, 
with quantitative estimates of the rates of carbon sequestration in 
drylands following changes in agricultural practices ranging between 
0.04 and 0.4 t ha–1 (medium confi dence). Rangeland management 
systems based on sustainable grazing and re-vegetation increase 
rangeland productivity and the fl ow of ecosystem services (high 
confi dence). The combined use of salt-tolerant crops, improved 
irrigation practices, chemical remediation measures and appropriate 
mulch and compost is effective in reducing the impact of secondary 
salinisation (medium confi dence). Application of sand dune 
stabilisation techniques contributes to reducing sand and dust storms 
(high confi dence). Agroforestry practices and shelterbelts help reduce 
soil erosion and sequester carbon. Afforestation programmes aimed 
at creating windbreaks in the form of ‘green walls’ and ‘green dams’ 
can help stabilise and reduce dust storms, avert wind erosion, and 
serve as carbon sinks, particularly when done with locally adapted 
native and other climate resilient tree species (high confi dence). 
{3.4.2, 3.6.1, 3.7.2}
Investments into SLM, land restoration and rehabilitation in 
dryland areas have positive economic returns (high confi dence). 
Each USD invested into land restoration can have social returns 
of about 3–6 USD over a 30-year period. Most SLM practices can 
become fi nancially profi table within 3 to 10 years (medium evidence, 
high agreement). Despite their benefi ts in addressing desertifi cation, 
mitigating and adapting to climate change, and increasing food 
and economic security, many SLM practices are not widely adopted 
due to insecure land tenure, lack of access to credit and agricultural 
advisory services, and insuffi cient incentives for private land-users 
(robust evidence, high agreement). {3.6.3}
Indigenous and local knowledge often contributes to 
enhancing resilience against climate change and combating 
desertifi cation (medium confi dence). Dryland populations 
have developed traditional agroecological practices which are well 
adapted to resource-sparse dryland environments. However, there 
is robust evidence documenting losses of traditional agroecological 
knowledge. Traditional agroecological practices are also increasingly 
unable to cope with growing demand for food. Combined use of ILK 
and new SLM technologies can contribute to raising the resilience 
to the challenges of climate change and desertifi cation (high 
confi dence). {3.1.3, 3.6.1, 3.6.2}

Technical Summary
TS
Policy frameworks promoting the adoption of SLM solutions 
contribute to addressing desertification as well as mitigating 
and adapting to climate change, with co-benefits for poverty 
eradication and food security among dryland populations (high 
confidence). Implementation of Land Degradation Neutrality 
(LDN) policies allows populations to avoid, reduce and reverse 
desertification, thus contributing to climate change adaptation 
with mitigation co-benefits (high confidence). Strengthening land 
tenure security is a major factor contributing to the adoption of soil 
conservation measures in croplands (high confidence). On-farm and 
off-farm livelihood diversification strategies increase the resilience of 
rural households against desertification and extreme weather events, 
such as droughts (high confidence). Strengthening collective action 
is important for addressing causes and impacts of desertification, 
and for adapting to climate change (medium confidence). A greater 
emphasis on understanding gender-specific differences over land 
use and land management practices can help make land restoration 
projects more successful (medium confidence). Improved access to 
markets raises agricultural profitability and motivates investment into 
climate change adaptation and SLM (medium confidence). Payments 
for ecosystem services give additional incentives to land users to 
adopt SLM practices (medium confidence). Expanding access to rural 
advisory services increases the knowledge on SLM and facilitates 
their wider adoption (medium confidence). Developing, enabling 
and promoting access to cleaner energy sources and technologies 
can contribute to reducing desertification and mitigating climate 
change through decreasing the use of fuelwood and crop residues 
for energy (medium confidence). Policy responses to droughts based 
on proactive drought preparedness and drought risk mitigation are 
more efficient in limiting drought-caused damages than reactive 
drought relief efforts (high confidence). {3.4.2, 3.6.2, 3.6.3, Cross-
Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 3}
The knowledge on limits of adaptation to the combined 
effects of climate change and desertification is insufficient. 
However, the potential for residual risks and maladaptive 
outcomes is high (high confidence). Empirical evidence on the 
limits to adaptation in dryland areas is limited. Potential limits to 
adaptation include losses of land productivity due to irreversible 
forms of desertification. Residual risks can emerge from the 
inability of SLM measures to fully compensate for yield losses due 
to climate change impacts. They also arise from foregone reductions 
in ecosystem services due to soil fertility loss even when applying 
SLM measures could revert land to initial productivity after some 
time. Some activities favouring agricultural intensification in dryland 
areas can become maladaptive due to their negative impacts on the 
environment (medium confidence) Even when solutions are available, 
social, economic and institutional constraints could pose barriers to 
their implementation (medium confidence) {3.6.4}. 
Improving capacities, providing higher access to climate 
services, including local-level early warning systems, and 
expanding the use of remote sensing technologies are high-
return investments for enabling effective adaptation and 
mitigation responses that help address desertification (high 
confidence). Reliable and timely climate services, relevant to 
desertification, can aid the development of appropriate adaptation 
and mitigation options reducing, the impact of desertification on 
human and natural systems (high confidence), with quantitative 
estimates showing that every USD invested in strengthening hydro-
meteorological and early warning services in developing countries 
can yield between 4 and 35 USD (low confidence). Knowledge 
and flow of knowledge on desertification is currently fragmented. 
Improved knowledge and data exchange and sharing will increase the 
effectiveness of efforts to achieve LDN (high confidence). Expanded 
use of remotely sensed information for data collection helps in 
measuring progress towards achieving LDN (low evidence, high 
agreement). {3.2.1, 3.6.2, 3.6.3, Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 3}

Land degradation 
Land degradation affects people and ecosystems throughout 
the planet and is both affected by climate change and 
contributes to it. In this report, land degradation is defined as 
a negative trend in land condition, caused by direct or indirect 
human-induced processes including anthropogenic climate change, 
expressed as long-term reduction or loss of at least one of the 
following: biological productivity, ecological integrity, or value to 
humans. Forest degradation is land degradation that occurs in forest 
land. Deforestation is the conversion of forest to non-forest land and 
can result in land degradation. {4.1.3}
Land degradation adversely affects people’s livelihoods (very 
high confidence) and occurs over a quarter of the Earth’s 
ice-free land area (medium confidence). The majority of the 
1.3 to 3.2 billion affected people (low confidence) are living 
in poverty in developing countries (medium confidence). 
Land-use changes and unsustainable land management are direct 
human causes of land degradation (very high confidence), with 
agriculture being a dominant sector driving degradation (very high 
confidence). Soil loss from conventionally tilled land exceeds the rate 
of soil formation by >2 orders of magnitude (medium confidence). 
Land degradation affects humans in multiple ways, interacting 
with social, political, cultural and economic aspects, including 
markets, technology, inequality and demographic change (very high 
confidence). Land degradation impacts extend beyond the land 
surface itself, affecting marine and freshwater systems, as well as 
people and ecosystems far away from the local sites of degradation 
(very high confidence). {4.1.6, 4.2.1, 4.2.3, 4.3, 4.6.1, 4.7, Table 4.1} 
Climate change exacerbates the rate and magnitude of 
several ongoing land degradation processes and introduces 
new degradation patterns (high confidence). Human-induced 
global warming has already caused observed changes in two drivers 
of land degradation: increased frequency, intensity and/or amount 
of heavy precipitation (medium confidence); and increased heat 
stress (high confidence). In some areas sea level rise has exacerbated 
coastal erosion (medium confidence). Global warming beyond 
present day will further exacerbate ongoing land degradation 
processes through increasing floods (medium confidence), drought 
frequency and severity (medium confidence), intensified cyclones 
(medium confidence), and sea level rise (very high confidence), 
with outcomes being modulated by land management (very high 
confidence). Permafrost thawing due to warming (high confidence), 
and coastal erosion due to sea level rise and impacts of changing 
storm paths (low confidence), are examples of land degradation 
affecting places where it has not typically been a problem. Erosion of 
coastal areas because of sea level rise will increase worldwide (high 
confidence). In cyclone prone areas, the combination of sea level rise 
and more intense cyclones will cause land degradation with serious 
consequences for people and livelihoods (very high confidence). 
{4.2.1, 4.2.2, 4.2.3, 4.4.1, 4.4.2, 4.9.6, Table 4.1} 
Land degradation and climate change, both individually 
and in combination, have profound implications for natural 
resource-based livelihood systems and societal groups (high 
confidence). The number of people whose livelihood depends on 
degraded lands has been estimated to be about 1.5 billion worldwide 
(very low confidence). People in degraded areas who directly depend 
on natural resources for subsistence, food security and income, 
including women and youth with limited adaptation options, are 
especially vulnerable to land degradation and climate change 
(high confidence). Land degradation reduces land productivity and 
increases the workload of managing the land, affecting women 
disproportionally in some regions. Land degradation and climate 
change act as threat multipliers for already precarious livelihoods 
(very high confidence), leaving them highly sensitive to extreme 
climatic events, with consequences such as poverty and food 
insecurity (high confidence) and, in some cases, migration, conflict 
and loss of cultural heritage (low confidence). Changes in vegetation 
cover and distribution due to climate change increase the risk of land 
degradation in some areas (medium confidence). Climate change will 
have detrimental effects on livelihoods, habitats and infrastructure 
through increased rates of land degradation (high confidence) and 
from new degradation patterns (low evidence, high agreement). 
{4.1.6, 4.2.1, 4.7} 
Land degradation is a driver of climate change through 
emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and reduced rates of 
carbon uptake (very high confidence). Since 1990, globally the 
forest area has decreased by 3% (low confidence) with net decreases 
in the tropics and net increases outside the tropics (high confidence). 
Lower carbon density in re-growing forests compared, to carbon 
stocks before deforestation, results in net emissions from land-use 
change (very high confidence). Forest management that reduces 
carbon stocks of forest land also leads to emissions, but global 
estimates of these emissions are uncertain. Cropland soils have 
lost 20–60% of their organic carbon content prior to cultivation, 
and soils under conventional agriculture continue to be a source 
of GHGs (medium confidence). Of the land degradation processes, 
deforestation, increasing wildfires, degradation of peat soils, and 
permafrost thawing contribute most to climate change through the 
release of GHGs and the reduction in land carbon sinks following 
deforestation (high confidence). Agricultural practices also emit non-
CO2 GHGs from soils and these emissions are exacerbated by climate 
change (medium confidence). Conversion of primary to managed 
forests, illegal logging and unsustainable forest management result 
in GHG emissions (very high confidence) and can have additional 
physical effects on the regional climate including those arising from 
albedo shifts (medium confidence). These interactions call for more 
integrative climate impact assessments. {4.2.2, 4.3, 4.5.4, 4.6}
Large-scale implementation of dedicated biomass production 
for bioenergy increases competition for land with potentially 
serious consequences for food security and land degradation 
(high confidence). Increasing the extent and intensity of biomass 
production, for example, through fertiliser additions, irrigation or 
monoculture energy plantations, can result in local land degradation. 
Poorly implemented intensification of land management contributes 
to land degradation (e.g., salinisation from irrigation) and disrupted 
livelihoods (high confidence). In areas where afforestation and 
reforestation occur on previously degraded lands, opportunities 
exist to restore and rehabilitate lands with potentially significant 
54
Technical Summary
TS
co-benefi ts (high confi dence) that depend on whether restoration 
involves natural or plantation forests. The total area of degraded 
lands has been estimated at 10–60 Mkm2 (very low confi dence). The 
extent of degraded and marginal lands suitable for dedicated biomass 
production is highly uncertain and cannot be established without 
due consideration of current land use and land tenure. Increasing 
the area of dedicated energy crops can lead to land degradation 
elsewhere through indirect land-use change (medium confi dence). 
Impacts of energy crops can be reduced through strategic integration 
with agricultural and forestry systems (high confi dence) but the 
total quantity of biomass that can be produced through synergistic 
production systems is unknown. {4.1.6, 4.4.2, 4.5, 4.7.1, 4.8.1, 4.8.3, 
4.8.4, 4.9.3} 
Reducing unsustainable use of traditional biomass reduces 
land degradation and emissions of CO2 while providing social 
and economic co-benefi ts (very high confi dence). Traditional 
biomass in the form of fuelwood, charcoal and agricultural residues 
remains a primary source of energy for more than one-third of 
the global population, leading to unsustainable use of biomass 
resources and forest degradation and contributing around 2% of 
global GHG emissions (low confi dence). Enhanced forest protection, 
improved forest and agricultural management, fuel-switching and 
adoption of effi cient cooking and heating appliances can promote 
more sustainable biomass use and reduce land degradation, with 
co-benefi ts of reduced GHG emissions, improved human health, 
and reduced workload especially for women and youth (very high 
confi dence). {4.1.6, 4.5.4} 
Figure TS.7 |  Conceptual fi gure illustrating that climate change impacts interact with land management to determine sustainable or degraded 
outcome. Climate change can exacerbate many degradation processes (Table 4.1) and introduce novel ones (e.g., permafrost thawing or biome shifts), hence management 
needs to respond to climate impacts in order to avoid, reduce or reverse degradation. The types and intensity of human land-use and climate change impacts on lands affect 
their carbon stocks and their ability to operate as carbon sinks. In managed agricultural lands, degradation typically results in reductions of soil organic carbon stocks, which 
also adversely affects land productivity and carbon sinks. In forest land, reduction in biomass carbon stocks alone is not necessarily an indication of a reduction in carbon 
sinks. Sustainably managed forest landscapes can have a lower biomass carbon density but the younger forests can have a higher growth rate, and therefore contribute 
stronger carbon sinks, than older forests. Ranges of carbon sinks in forest and agricultural lands are overlapping. In some cases, climate change impacts may result in 
increased productivity and carbon stocks, at least in the short term.

Technical Summary
TS
Land degradation can be avoided, reduced or reversed by 
implementing sustainable land management, restoration 
and rehabilitation practices that simultaneously provide 
many co-benefits, including adaptation to and mitigation of 
climate change (high confidence). Sustainable land management 
involves a comprehensive array of technologies and enabling 
conditions, which have proven to address land degradation at 
multiple landscape scales, from local farms (very high confidence) 
to entire watersheds (medium confidence). Sustainable forest 
management can prevent deforestation, maintain and enhance 
carbon sinks and can contribute towards GHG emissions-reduction 
goals. Sustainable forest management generates socio-economic 
benefits, and provides fibre, timber and biomass to meet society’s 
growing needs. While sustainable forest management sustains high 
carbon sinks, the conversion from primary forests to sustainably 
managed forests can result in carbon emission during the transition 
and loss of biodiversity (high confidence). Conversely, in areas of 
degraded forests, sustainable forest management can increase 
carbon stocks and biodiversity (medium confidence). Carbon storage 
in long-lived wood products and reductions of emissions from use of 
wood products to substitute for emissions-intensive materials also 
contribute to mitigation objectives. (Figure TS.8) {4.8, 4.9, Table 4.2}
Lack of action to address land degradation will increase 
emissions and reduce carbon sinks and is inconsistent with 
the emissions reductions required to limit global warming 
to 1.5°C or 2°C. (high confidence). Better management of soils 
can offset 5–20% of current global anthropogenic GHG emissions 
(medium confidence). Measures to avoid, reduce and reverse land 
degradation are available but economic, political, institutional, legal 
and socio-cultural barriers, including lack of access to resources 
and knowledge, restrict their uptake (very high confidence). Proven 
measures that facilitate implementation of practices that avoid, 
reduce, or reverse land degradation include tenure reform, tax 
Figure TS.8 |  Interaction of human and climate drivers can exacerbate desertification and land degradation. Figure shows key desertification and 
land degradation issues, how they impact climate change, and the key drivers, with potential solutions.Climate change exacerbates the rate and magnitude 
of several ongoing land degradation and desertification processes. Human drivers of land degradation and desertification include expanding agriculture, agricultural 
practices and forest management. In turn, land degradation and desertification are also drivers of climate change through GHG emissions, reduced rates of carbon uptake, 
and reduced capacity of ecosystems to act as carbon sinks into the future. Impacts on climate change are either warming (in red) or cooling (in blue).

Delayed action increases the costs of addressing land degradation, 
and can lead to irreversible biophysical and human outcomes 
(high confidence). Early actions can generate both site-specific and 
immediate benefits to communities affected by land degradation, 
and contribute to long-term global benefits through climate change 
mitigation (high confidence). (Figure TS.7) {4.1.5, 4.1.6, 4.7.1, 4.8, 
Table 4.2}
Even with adequate implementation of measures to avoid, 
reduce and reverse land degradation, there will be residual 
degradation in some situations (high confidence). Limits to 
adaptation are dynamic, site specific and determined through the 
interaction of biophysical changes with social and institutional 
conditions. Exceeding the limits of adaptation will trigger escalating 
losses or result in undesirable changes, such as forced migration, 
conflicts, or poverty. Examples of potential limits to adaptation due 
to climate-change-induced land degradation are coastal erosion 
(where land disappears, collapsing infrastructure and livelihoods due 
to thawing of permafrost), and extreme forms of soil erosion. {4.7, 
4.8.5, 4.8.6, 4.9.6, 4.9.7, 4.9.8} 
Land degradation is a serious and widespread problem, yet 
key uncertainties remain concerning its extent, severity, and 
linkages to climate change (very high confidence). Despite 
the difficulties of objectively measuring the extent and severity of 
land degradation, given its complex and value-based characteristics, 
land degradation represents – along with climate change – one of 
the biggest and most urgent challenges for humanity (very high 
confidence). The current global extent, severity and rates of land 
degradation are not well quantified. There is no single method by 
which land degradation can be measured objectively and consistently 
over large areas because it is such a complex and value-laden concept 
(very high confidence). However, many existing scientific and locally 
based approaches, including the use of ILK, can assess different 
aspects of land degradation or provide proxies. Remote sensing, 
corroborated by other data, can generate geographically explicit and 
globally consistent data that can be used as proxies over relevant 
time scales (several decades). Few studies have specifically addressed 
the impacts of proposed land-based negative emission technologies 
on land degradation. Much research has tried to understand how 
livelihoods and ecosystems are affected by a particular stressor – for 
example, drought, heat stress, or waterlogging. Important knowledge 
gaps remain in understanding how plants, habitats and ecosystems 
are affected by the cumulative and interacting impacts of several 
stressors, including potential new stressors resulting from large-scale 
implementation of negative emission technologies. {4.10}

Food security 
The current food system (production, transport, processing, 
packaging, storage, retail, consumption, loss and waste) feeds 
the great majority of world population and supports the 
livelihoods of over 1 billion people. Since 1961, food supply per 
capita has increased more than 30%, accompanied by greater use 
of nitrogen fertilisers (increase of about 800%) and water resources 
for irrigation (increase of more than 100%). However, an estimated 
821 million people are currently undernourished, 151 million children 
under five are stunted, 613 million women and girls aged 15 to 49 
suffer from iron deficiency, and 2 billion adults are overweight or 
obese. The food system is under pressure from non-climate stressors 
(e.g., population and income growth, demand for animal-sourced 
products), and from climate change. These climate and non-climate 
stresses are impacting the four pillars of food security (availability, 
access, utilisation, and stability). (Figure TS.9) {5.1.1, 5.1.2}
Observed climate change is already affecting food security 
through increasing temperatures, changing precipitation 
patterns, and greater frequency of some extreme events (high 
confidence). Studies that separate out climate change from other 
factors affecting crop yields have shown that yields of some crops 
(e.g., maize and wheat) in many lower-latitude regions have been 
affected negatively by observed climate changes, while in many 
higher-latitude regions, yields of some crops (e.g., maize, wheat, 
and sugar beets) have been affected positively over recent decades. 
Warming compounded by drying has caused large negative effects 
on yields in parts of the Mediterranean.  Based on ILK, climate 
change is affecting food security in drylands, particularly those in 
Africa, and high mountain regions of Asia and South America. (Figure 
TS.10) {5.2.2}
Food security will be increasingly affected by projected future 
climate change (high confidence). Across SSPs 1, 2, and 3, global 
crop and economic models projected a 1–29% cereal price increase 
in 2050 due to climate change (RCP 6.0), which would impact 
consumers globally through higher food prices; regional effects will 
vary (high confidence). Low-income consumers are particularly at 
risk, with models projecting increases of 1–183 million additional 
people at risk of hunger across the SSPs compared to a no climate 
change scenario (high confidence). While increased CO2 is projected 
to be beneficial for crop productivity at lower temperature increases, 
it is projected to lower nutritional quality (high confidence) (e.g., 
wheat grown at 546–586 ppm CO2 has 5.9–12.7% less protein, 
3.7–6.5% less zinc, and 5.2–7.5% less iron). Distributions of pests 
and diseases will change, affecting production negatively in many 
regions (high confidence). Given increasing extreme events and 
interconnectedness, risks of food system disruptions are growing 
(high confidence). {5.2.3, 5.2.4}  
Vulnerability of pastoral systems to climate change is very high 
(high confidence). Pastoralism is practiced in more than 75% of 
countries by between 200 and 500 million people, including nomadic 
communities, transhumant herders, and agropastoralists. Impacts 
in pastoral systems in Africa include lower pasture and animal 
productivity, damaged reproductive function, and biodiversity loss. 
Pastoral system vulnerability is exacerbated by non-climate factors

(land tenure, sedentarisation, changes in traditional institutions, 
invasive species, lack of markets, and conflicts). {5.2.2}
Fruit and vegetable production, a key component of healthy 
diets, is also vulnerable to climate change (medium evidence, 
high agreement). Declines in yields and crop suitability are projected 
under higher temperatures, especially in tropical and semi-tropical 
regions. Heat stress reduces fruit set and speeds up development of 
annual vegetables, resulting in yield losses, impaired product quality, 
and increasing food loss and waste. Longer growing seasons enable 
a greater number of plantings to be cultivated and can contribute 
to greater annual yields. However, some fruits and vegetables need 
a  period of cold accumulation to produce a viable harvest, and 
warmer winters may constitute a risk. {5.2.2}
Food security and climate change have strong gender and 
equity dimensions (high confidence). Worldwide, women play 
a key role in food security, although regional differences exist. 
Climate change impacts vary among diverse social groups depending 
on age, ethnicity, gender, wealth, and class. Climate extremes 
have immediate and long-term impacts on livelihoods of poor 
and vulnerable communities, contributing to greater risks of food 
insecurity that can be a stress multiplier for internal and external 
migration (medium confidence). Empowering women and rights-
based approaches to decision-making can create synergies among 
household food security, adaptation, and mitigation. {5.2.6, 5.6.4} 
Many practices can be optimised and scaled up to advance 
adaptation throughout the food system (high confidence). 
Supply-side options include increased soil organic matter and 
erosion control, improved cropland, livestock, grazing land 
management, and genetic improvements for tolerance to heat and 
drought. Diversification in the food system (e.g., implementation 
of integrated production systems, broad-based genetic resources, 
and heterogeneous diets) is a key strategy to reduce risks (medium 
confidence). Demand-side adaptation, such as adoption of healthy 
and sustainable diets, in conjunction with reduction in food loss and 
waste, can contribute to adaptation through reduction in additional 
land area needed for food production and associated food system 
vulnerabilities. ILK can contribute to enhancing food system resilience 
(high confidence). {5.3, 5.6.3 Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 5}.
About 21–37% of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are 
attributable to the food system. These are from agriculture 
and land use, storage, transport, packaging, processing, retail, 
and consumption (medium confidence). This estimate includes 
emissions of 9–14% from crop and livestock activities within the 
farm gate and 5–14% from land use and land-use change including 
deforestation and peatland degradation (high confidence); 5–10% 
is from supply chain activities (medium confidence). This estimate 
includes GHG emissions from food loss and waste. Within the food 
system, during the period 2007–2016, the major sources of emissions 
from the supply side were agricultural production, with crop and 
livestock activities within the farm gate generating respectively 
142 ± 42 TgCH4 yr–1 (high confidence) and 8.0 ± 2.5 TgN2O yr–1 
(high confidence), and CO2 emissions linked to relevant land-use 
change dynamics such as deforestation and peatland degradation, 
generating 4.9 ± 2.5 GtCO2 yr–1. Using 100-year GWP values (no 
climate feedback) from the IPCC AR5, this implies that total GHG 
emissions from agriculture were 6.2 ± 1.4 GtCO2-eq yr–1, increasing 
to 11.1 ± 2.9 GtCO2-eq yr–1 including relevant land use. Without 
intervention, these are likely to increase by about 30–40% by 2050, 
due to increasing demand based on population and income growth 
and dietary change (high confidence). {5.4} 
Supply-side practices can contribute to climate change 
mitigation by reducing crop and livestock emissions, 
sequestering carbon in soils and biomass, and by decreasing 
emissions intensity within sustainable production systems 
(high confidence). Total technical mitigation potential from 
crop and livestock activities and agroforestry is estimated as 
2.3–9.6 GtCO2-eq yr–1 by 2050 (medium confidence). Options with 
large potential for GHG mitigation in cropping systems include soil 
carbon sequestration (at decreasing rates over time), reductions 
in N2O emissions from fertilisers, reductions in CH4 emissions from 
paddy rice, and bridging of yield gaps. Options with large potential 
for mitigation in livestock systems include better grazing land 
management, with increased net primary production and soil carbon 
stocks, improved manure management, and higher-quality feed. 
Reductions in GHG emissions intensity (emissions per unit product) 
from livestock can support reductions in absolute emissions, provided 
appropriate governance to limit total production is implemented at 
the same time (medium confidence). {5.5.1} 
Consumption of healthy and sustainable diets presents major 
opportunities for reducing GHG emissions from food systems 
and improving health outcomes (high confidence). Examples of 
healthy and sustainable diets are high in coarse grains, pulses, fruits 
and vegetables, and nuts and seeds; low in energy-intensive animal-
sourced and discretionary foods (such as sugary beverages); and 
with a carbohydrate threshold. Total technical mitigation potential 
of dietary changes is estimated as 0.7–8.0 GtCO2-eq yr–1 by 2050 
(medium confidence). This estimate includes reductions in emissions 
from livestock and soil carbon sequestration on spared land, but co-
benefits with health are not taken into account. Mitigation potential 
of dietary change may be higher, but achievement of this potential at 
broad scales depends on consumer choices and dietary preferences 
that are guided by social, cultural, environmental, and traditional 
factors, as well as income growth. Meat analogues such as imitation 
meat (from plant products), cultured meat, and insects may help in 
the transition to more healthy and sustainable diets, although their 
carbon footprints and acceptability are uncertain. {5.5.2, 5.6.5}
Reduction of food loss and waste could lower GHG emissions 
and improve food security (medium confidence). Combined food 
loss and waste amount to 25–30% of total food produced (medium 
confidence). During 2010–2016, global food loss and waste equalled 
8–10% of total anthropogenic GHG emissions (medium confidence); 
and cost about 1 trillion USD2012 per year (low confidence). 
Technical options for reduction of food loss and waste include 
improved harvesting techniques, on-farm storage, infrastructure, and 
packaging. Causes of food loss (e.g., lack of refrigeration) and waste 
(e.g., behaviour) differ substantially in developed and developing 
countries, as well as across regions (robust evidence, medium 
agreement). {5.5.2}

Technical Summary
TS
Agriculture and the food system are key to global climate 
change responses. Combining supply-side actions such as 
effi cient production, transport, and processing with demand-
side interventions such as modifi cation of food choices, and 
reduction of food loss and waste, reduces GHG emissions 
and enhances food system resilience (high confi dence).
Such combined measures can enable the implementation of large-
scale land-based adaptation and mitigation strategies without 
threatening food security from increased competition for land for 
food production and higher food prices. Without combined food 
system measures in farm management, supply chains, and demand, 
adverse effects would include increased numbers of malnourished 
people and impacts on smallholder farmers (medium evidence, high 
agreement). Just transitions are needed to address these effects. 
(Figure TS.11) {5.5, 5.6, 5.7}
For adaptation and mitigation throughout the food system, 
enabling conditions need to be created through policies, 
markets, institutions, and governance (high confi dence).
For adaptation, resilience to increasing extreme events can be 
accomplished through risk sharing and transfer mechanisms such 
as insurance markets and index-based weather insurance (high 
confi dence). Public health policies to improve nutrition – such as 
school procurement, health insurance incentives, and awareness-
raising campaigns – can potentially change demand, reduce 
healthcare costs, and contribute to lower GHG emissions (limited 
evidence, high agreement). Without inclusion of comprehensive food 
system responses in broader climate change policies, the mitigation 
and adaptation potentials assessed in Chapter 5 will not be realised 
and food security will be jeopardised (high confi dence). {5.7.5}

Interlinkages between desertification, 
land degradation, food security and 
GHG fluxes: Synergies, trade-offs and 
integrated response options
The land challenges, in the context of this report, are 
climate change mitigation, adaptation, desertification, land 
degradation, and food security. The chapter also discusses 
implications for Nature’s Contributions to People (NCP), including 
biodiversity and water, and sustainable development, by assessing 
intersections with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The 
chapter assesses response options that could be used to address these 
challenges. These response options were derived from the previous 
chapters and fall into three broad categories: land management, 
value chain, and risk management.
The land challenges faced today vary across regions; climate 
change will increase challenges in the future, while socio-
economic development could either increase or decrease 
challenges (high confidence). Increases in biophysical impacts from 
climate change can worsen desertification, land degradation, and 
food insecurity (high confidence). Additional pressures from socio-
economic development could further exacerbate these challenges; 
however, the effects are scenario dependent. Scenarios with increases 
in income and reduced pressures on land can lead to reductions in 
food insecurity; however, all assessed scenarios result in increases in 
water demand and water scarcity (medium confidence). {6.1} 
The applicability and efficacy of response options are 
region and context specific; while many value chain and risk 
management options are potentially broadly applicable, many 
land management options are applicable on less than 50% of 
the ice-free land surface (high confidence). Response options 
are limited by land type, bioclimatic region, or local food system 
context (high confidence). Some response options produce adverse 
side effects only in certain regions or contexts; for example, response 
options that use freshwater may have no adverse side effects in 
regions where water is plentiful, but large adverse side effects in 
regions where water is scarce (high confidence). Response options 
with biophysical climate effects (e.g., afforestation, reforestation) 
may have different effects on local climate, depending on where they 
are implemented (medium confidence). Regions with more challenges 
have fewer response options available for implementation (medium 
confidence). {6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4}
Nine options deliver medium-to-large benefits for all five land 
challenges (high confidence). The options with medium-to-large 
benefits for all challenges are increased food productivity, improved 
cropland management, improved grazing land management, 
improved livestock management, agroforestry, forest management, 
increased soil organic carbon content, fire management and 
reduced post-harvest losses. A further two options, dietary change 
and reduced food waste, have no global estimates for adaptation 
but have medium-to-large benefits for all other challenges (high 
confidence). {6.3, 6.4}
Five options have large mitigation potential (>3 GtCO2e yr–1) 
without adverse impacts on the other challenges (high 
confidence). These are: increased food productivity; reduced 
deforestation and forest degradation; increased soil organic carbon 
content; fire management; and reduced post-harvest losses. Two 
further options with large mitigation potential, dietary change 
and reduced food waste, have no global estimates for adaptation 
but show no negative impacts across the other challenges. Five 
options: improved cropland management; improved grazing land 
managements; agroforestry; integrated water management; and 
forest management, have moderate mitigation potential, with no 
adverse impacts on the other challenges (high confidence). {6.3.6}
Sixteen response options have large adaptation potential (more 
than 25 million people benefit), without adverse side effects 
on other land challenges (high confidence). These are increased 
food productivity, improved cropland management, agroforestry, 
agricultural diversification, forest management, increased soil 
organic carbon content, reduced landslides and natural hazards, 
restoration and reduced conversion of coastal wetlands, reduced 
post-harvest losses, sustainable sourcing, management of supply 
chains, improved food processing and retailing, improved energy 
use in food systems, livelihood diversification, use of local seeds, and 
disaster risk management (high confidence). Some options (such as 
enhanced urban food systems or management of urban sprawl) may 
not provide large global benefits but may have significant positive 
local effects without adverse effects (high confidence). (Figure TS.13) 
{6.3, 6.4}
Seventeen of 40 options deliver co-benefits or no adverse 
side effects for the full range of NCPs and SDGs; only three 
options (afforestation, BECCS), and some types of risk sharing 
instruments, such as insurance) have potentially adverse side 
effects for five or more NCPs or SDGs (medium confidence). 
The 17 options with co-benefits and no adverse side effects include 
most agriculture- and soil-based land management options, many 
ecosystem-based land management options, forest management, 
reduced post-harvest losses, sustainable sourcing, improved 
energy use in food systems, and livelihood diversification (medium 
confidence). Some of the synergies between response options and 
SDGs include positive poverty eradication impacts from activities like 
improved water management or improved management of supply 
chains. Examples of synergies between response options and NCPs 
include positive impacts on habitat maintenance from activities 
like invasive species management and agricultural diversification. 
However, many of these synergies are not automatic, and are 
dependent on well-implemented activities requiring institutional and 
enabling conditions for success. {6.4}
Most response options can be applied without competing for 
available land; however, seven options result in competition 
for land (medium confidence). A large number of response options 
do not require dedicated land, including several land management 
options, all value chain options, and all risk management options. 
Four options could greatly increase competition for land if applied at 
scale: afforestation, reforestation, and land used to provide feedstock 
for BECCS or biochar, with three further options: reduced grassland 
62
Technical Summary
TS
conversion to croplands, restoration and reduced conversion of 
peatlands and restoration, and reduced conversion of coastal 
wetlands having smaller or variable impacts on competition for land. 
Other options such as reduced deforestation and forest degradation, 
restrict land conversion for other options and uses. Expansion of the 
current area of managed land into natural ecosystems could have 
negative consequences for other land challenges, lead to the loss of 
biodiversity, and adversely affect a range of NCPs (high confidence). 
{6.3.6, 6.4}
Some options, such as bioenergy and BECCS, are scale 
dependent. The climate change mitigation potential for 
bioenergy and BECCS is large (up to 11 GtCO2 yr–1); however, 
the effects of bioenergy production on land degradation, 
food insecurity, water scarcity, GHG emissions, and other 
environmental goals are scale- and context-specific (high 
confidence). These effects depend on the scale of deployment, 
initial land use, land type, bioenergy feedstock, initial carbon 
stocks, climatic region and management regime (high confidence). 
Large areas of monoculture bioenergy crops that displace other 
land uses can result in land competition, with adverse effects for 
food production, food consumption, and thus food security, as well 
as adverse effects for land degradation, biodiversity, and water 
scarcity (medium confidence). However, integration of bioenergy into 
sustainably managed agricultural landscapes can ameliorate these 
challenges (medium confidence). {6.2, 6.3, 6.4, Cross-Chapter Box 7 
in Chapter 6}
Response options are interlinked; some options (e.g., land 
sparing and sustainable land management options) can 
enhance the co-benefits or increase the potential for other 
options (medium confidence). Some response options can be 
more effective when applied together (medium confidence); for 
example, dietary change and waste reduction expand the potential to 
apply other options by freeing as much as 5.8 Mkm2 (0.8–2.4 Mkm2 
for dietary change; about 2 Mkm2 for reduced post-harvest losses, 
and 1.4 Mkm2 for reduced food waste) of land (low confidence). 
Integrated water management and increased soil organic carbon can 
increase food productivity in some circumstances. {6.4}
Other response options (e.g., options that require land) may 
conflict; as a result, the potentials for response options are 
not all additive, and a total potential from the land is currently 
unknown (high confidence). Combining some sets of options (e.g., 
those that compete for land) may mean that maximum potentials 
cannot be realised, for example, reforestation, afforestation, and 
bioenergy and BECCS, all compete for the same finite land resource 
so the combined potential is much lower than the sum of potentials 
of each individual option, calculated in the absence of alternative 
uses of the land (high confidence). Given the interlinkages among 
response options and that mitigation potentials for individual options 
assume that they are applied to all suitable land, the total mitigation 
potential is much lower than the sum of the mitigation potential of 
the individual response options (high confidence). (Figure TS.12) {6.4}
The feasibility of response options, including those with 
multiple co-benefits, is limited due to economic, technological, 
institutional, socio-cultural, environmental and geophysical 
barriers (high confidence). A number of response options (e.g., most 
agriculture-based land management options, forest management, 
reforestation and restoration) have already been implemented 
widely to date (high confidence). There is robust evidence that many 
other response options can deliver co-benefits across the range of 
land challenges, yet these are not being implemented. This limited 
application is evidence that multiple barriers to implementation of 
response options exist (high confidence). {6.3, 6.4}
Coordinated action is required across a range of actors, 
including business, producers, consumers, land managers, 
indigenous peoples and local communities and policymakers 
to create enabling conditions for adoption of response options 
(high confidence). The response options assessed face a variety of 
barriers to implementation (economic, technological, institutional, 
socio-cultural, environmental and geophysical) that require action 
across multiple actors to overcome (high confidence). There are a 
variety of response options available at different scales that could 
form portfolios of measures applied by different stakeholders – from 
farm to international scales. For example, agricultural diversification 
and use of local seeds by smallholders can be particularly useful 
poverty eradication and biodiversity conservation measures, but are 
only successful when higher scales, such as national and international 
markets and supply chains, also value these goods in trade regimes, 
and consumers see the benefits of purchasing these goods. However, 
the land and food sectors face particular challenges of institutional 
fragmentation, and often suffer from a lack of engagement between 
stakeholders at different scales (medium confidence). {6.3, 6.4}
Delayed action will result in an increased need for response 
to land challenges and a decreased potential for land-based 
response options due to climate change and other pressures 
(high confidence). For example, failure to mitigate climate change 
will increase requirements for adaptation and may reduce the efficacy 
of future land-based mitigation options (high confidence). The 
potential for some land management options decreases as climate 
change increases; for example, climate alters the sink capacity for 
soil and vegetation carbon sequestration, reducing the potential 
for increased soil organic carbon (high confidence). Other options 
(e.g., reduced deforestation and forest degradation) prevent further 
detrimental effects to the land surface; delaying these options could 
lead to increased deforestation, conversion, or degradation, serving 
as increased sources of GHGs and having concomitant negative 
impacts on NCPs (medium confidence). Carbon dioxide removal 
(CDR) options – such as reforestation, afforestation, bioenergy and 
BECCS – are used to compensate for unavoidable emissions in other 
sectors; delayed action will result in larger and more rapid deployment 
later (high confidence). Some response options will not be possible 
if action is delayed too long; for example, peatland restoration might 
not be possible after certain thresholds of degradation have been 
exceeded, meaning that peatlands could not be restored in certain 
locations (medium confidence) {6.2, 6.3, 6.4}.
Early action, however, has challenges including technological 
readiness, 
upscaling, 
and 
institutional 
barriers 
(high 
confidence). Some of the response options have technological 
63
Technical Summary
TS
barriers that may limit their wide-scale application in the near term 
(high confidence). Some response options, for example, BECCS, 
have only been implemented at small-scale demonstration facilities; 
challenges exist with upscaling these options to the levels discussed in 
Chapter 6 (medium confidence). Economic and institutional barriers, 
including governance, financial incentives and financial resources, 
limit the near-term adoption of many response options, and ‘policy 
lags’, by which implementation is delayed by the slowness of the 
policy implementation cycle, are significant across many options 
(medium confidence). Even some actions that initially seemed like 
‘easy wins’ have been challenging to implement, with stalled policies 
for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation 
and fostering conservation (REDD+) providing clear examples of how 
response options need sufficient funding, institutional support, local 
buy-in, and clear metrics for success, among other necessary enabling 
conditions. {6.2, 6.4}
Some response options reduce the consequences of land 
challenges, but do not address underlying drivers (high 
confidence). For example, management of urban sprawl can help 
reduce the environmental impact of urban systems; however, such 
management does not address the socio-economic and demographic 
changes driving the expansion of urban areas. By failing to address 
the underlying drivers, there is a potential for the challenge to 
re-emerge in the future (high confidence). {6.4}
Many response options have been practised in many regions 
for many years; however, there is limited knowledge of the 
efficacy and broader implications of other response options 
(high confidence). For the response options with a large evidence 
base and ample experience, further implementation and upscaling 
would carry little risk of adverse side effects (high confidence). 
However, for other options, the risks are larger as the knowledge 
gaps are greater; for example, uncertainty in the economic and 
social aspects of many land response options hampers the ability to 
predict their effects (medium confidence). Furthermore, Integrated 
Assessment Models, like those used to develop the pathways in the 
IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR15), omit many 
of these response options and do not assess implications for all land 
challenges (high confidence). {6.4}

Options shown are those for which data are available to assess global potential for three or more land challenges.
The magnitudes are assessed independently for each option and are not additive.
Panel A shows response options that can be implemented without or with limited competition for land, including some that have the 
potential to reduce the demand for land. Co-benefits and adverse side efects are shown quantitatively based on the high end of the 
range of potentials assessed. Magnitudes of contributions are categorised using thresholds for positive or negative impacts. Letters 
within the cells indicate confidence in the magnitude of the impact relative to the thresholds used (see legend). Confidence in the 
direction of change is generally higher.

Panel B shows response options that rely on additional land-use change and could have implications across three or more land 
challenges under diferent implementation contexts. For each option, the first row  (high level implementation) shows a quantitative 
assessment (as in Panel A) of implications for global implementation at scales delivering CO2 removals of more than 3 GtCO2 yr–1 using 
the magnitude thresholds shown in Panel A. The red hatched cells indicate an increasing pressure but unquantified impact. For each 
option, the second row (best practice implementation) shows qualitative estimates of impact if implemented using best practices in 
appropriately managed landscape systems that allow for eficient and sustainable resource use and supported by appropriate 
governance mechanisms. In these qualitative assessments, green indicates a positive impact, grey indicates a neutral interaction.

Bioenergy and BECCS
High level: Impacts on adaptation, desertification, land degradation and food security are maximum potential impacts, assuming carbon dioxide removal by BECCS 
at a scale of 11.3 GtCO2 yr–1 in 2050, and noting that bioenergy without CCS can also achieve emissions reductions of up to several GtCO2 yr–1 when it is a low carbon
energy source {2.6.1; 6.3.1}. Studies linking bioenergy to food security estimate an increase in the population at risk of hunger to up to 150 million people at this level
of implementation {6.3.5}. The red hatched cells for desertification and land degradation indicate that while up to 15 million km2 of additional land is required in 2100
in 2°C scenarios which will increase pressure for desertification and land degradation, the actual area afected by this additional pressure is not easily quantified
{6.3.3; 6.3.4}. 
Best practice: The sign and magnitude of the efects of bioenergy and BECCS depends on the scale of deployment, the type of bioenergy feedstock, which other 
response options are included, and where bioenergy is grown (including prior land use and indirect land use change emissions). For example, limiting bioenergy 
production to marginal lands or abandoned cropland would have negligible efects on biodiversity, food security, and potentially co-benefits for land degradation; 
however, the benefits for mitigation could also be smaller. {Table 6.58}

Reforestation and forest restoration
High level: Impacts on adaptation, desertification, land degradation and food security are maximum potential impacts assuming implementation of reforestation 
and forest restoration (partly overlapping with aforestation) at a scale of 10.1 GtCO2 yr–1 removal {6.3.1}. Large-scale aforestation could cause increases in food prices 
of 80% by 2050, and more general mitigation measures in the AFOLU sector can translate into a rise in undernourishment of 80–300 million people; the impact of 
reforestation is lower {6.3.5}.
Best practice: There are co-benefits of reforestation and forest restoration in previously forested areas, assuming small scale deployment using native species and 
involving local stakeholders to provide a safety net for food security. Examples of sustainable implementation include, but are not limited to, reducing illegal logging 
and halting illegal forest loss in protected areas, reforesting and restoring forests in degraded and desertified lands {Box6.1C; Table 6.6}.

High level: Impacts on adaptation, desertification, land degradation and food security are maximum potential impacts assuming implementation of aforestation 
(partly overlapping with reforestation and forest restoration) at a scale of 8.9 GtCO2 yr–1 removal {6.3.1}. Large-scale aforestation could cause increases in food prices 
of 80% by 2050, and more general mitigation measures in the AFOLU sector can translate into a rise in undernourishment of 80–300 million people {6.3.5}.
Best practice: Aforestation is used to prevent desertification and to tackle land degradation. Forested land also ofers benefits in terms of food supply, especially 
when forest is established on degraded land, mangroves, and other land that cannot be used for agriculture. For example, food from forests represents a safety-net 
during times of food and income insecurity {6.3.5}.

Biochar addition to soil
High level: Impacts on adaptation, desertification, land degradation and food security are maximum potential impacts assuming implementation of biochar at a scale 
of 6.6 GtCO2 yr–1 removal {6.3.1}. Dedicated biomass crops required for feedstock production could occupy 0.4–2.6 Mkm2 of land, equivalent to around 20% of the global 
cropland area, which could potentially have a large efect on food security for up to 100 million people {6.3.5}.
Best practice: When applied to land, biochar could provide moderate benefits for food security by improving yields by 25% in the tropics, but with more limited 
impacts in temperate regions, or through improved water holding capacity and nutrient use eficiency. Abandoned cropland could be used to supply biomass for 
biochar, thus avoiding competition with food production; 5–9 Mkm2 of land is estimated to be available for biomass production without compromising food security 
and biodiversity, considering marginal and degraded land and land released by pasture intensification {6.3.5}.

Technical Summary
TS
Figure TS.13 (continued): This Figure is based on an aggregation of information from studies with a wide variety of assumptions about how response options are 
implemented and the contexts in which they occur. Response options implemented differently at local to global scales could lead to different outcomes. Magnitude 
of potential: For panel A, magnitudes are for the technical potential of response options globally. For each land challenge, magnitudes are set relative to a marker 
level as follows. For mitigation, potentials are set relative to the approximate potentials for the response options with the largest individual impacts (~3 GtCO2-eq yr–1). 
The threshold for the ‘large’ magnitude category is set at this level. For adaptation, magnitudes are set relative to the 100 million lives estimated to be affected by 
climate change and a carbon-based economy between 2010 and 2030. The threshold for the ‘large’ magnitude category represents 25% of this total. For desertification 
and land degradation, magnitudes are set relative to the lower end of current estimates of degraded land, 10–60 million km2. The threshold for the ‘large’ magnitude 
category represents 30% of the lower estimate. For food security, magnitudes are set relative to the approximately 800 million people who are currently undernourished. 
The threshold for the ‘large’ magnitude category represents 12.5% of this total. For panel B, for the first row (high level implementation) for each response option, the 
magnitude and thresholds are as defined for panel A. In the second row (best practice implementation) for each response option, the qualitative assessments that are 
green denote potential positive impacts, and those shown in grey indicate neutral interactions. Increased food production is assumed to be achieved through sustainable 
intensification rather than through injudicious application of additional external inputs such as agrochemicals. Levels of confidence: Confidence in the magnitude 
category (high, medium or low) into which each option falls for mitigation, adaptation, combating desertification and land degradation, and enhancing food security. 
High confidence means that there is a high level of agreement and evidence in the literature to support the categorisation as high, medium or low magnitude. Low 
confidence denotes that the categorisation of magnitude is based on few studies. Medium confidence reflects medium evidence and agreement in the magnitude 
of response. Cost ranges: Cost estimates are based on aggregation of often regional studies and vary in the components of costs that are included. In panel B, 
cost estimates are not provided for best practice implementation. One coin indicates low cost (<USD10 tCO2-eq–1 or <USD20 ha–1), two coins indicate medium cost 
(USD10–USD100 tCO2-eq–1 or USD20–USD200 ha–1), and three coins indicate high cost (>USD100 tCO2-eq–1 or USD200 ha–1). Thresholds in USD ha–1 are chosen to be 
comparable, but precise conversions will depend on the response option. Supporting evidence: Supporting evidence for the magnitude of the quantitative potential for 
land management-based response options can be found as follows: for mitigation Tables 6.13 to 6.20, with further evidence in Section 2.7.1; for adaptation Tables 6.21 
to 6.28; for combating desertification Tables 6.29 to 6.36, with further evidence in Chapter 3; for combating degradation tables 6.37 to 6.44, with further evidence in 
Chapter 4; for enhancing food security Table’s 6.45 to 6.52, with further evidence in Chapter 5. Other synergies and trade-offs not shown here are discussed in Chapter 6. 
Additional supporting evidence for the qualitative assessments in the second row for each option in panel B can be found in the Table’s 6.6, 6.55, 6.56 and 6.58, Section 
6.3.5.1.3, and Box 6.1c.

 Risk management and decision making 
in relation to sustainable development
Increases in global mean surface temperature are projected 
to result in continued permafrost degradation and coastal 
degradation (high confidence), increased wildfire, decreased 
crop yields in low latitudes, decreased food stability, decreased 
water availability, vegetation loss (medium confidence), 
decreased access to food and increased soil erosion (low 
confidence). There is high agreement and high evidence that 
increases in global mean temperature will result in continued 
increase in global vegetation loss, coastal degradation, as 
well as decreased crop yields in low latitudes, decreased 
food stability, decreased access to food and nutrition, and 
medium confidence in continued permafrost degradation and 
water scarcity in drylands. Impacts are already observed across 
all components (high confidence). Some processes may experience 
irreversible impacts at lower levels of warming than others. There 
are high risks from permafrost degradation, and wildfire, coastal 
degradation, stability of food systems at 1.5°C while high risks from 
soil erosion, vegetation loss and changes in nutrition only occur 
at higher temperature thresholds due to increased possibility for 
adaptation (medium confidence). {7.2.2.1, 7.2.2.2, 7.2.2.3; 7.2.2.4; 
7.2.2.5; 7.2.2.6; 7.2.2.7; Figure 7.1} 
These changes result in compound risks to food systems, 
human and ecosystem health, livelihoods, the viability of 
infrastructure, and the value of land (high confidence). The 
experience and dynamics of risk change over time as a result of 
both human and natural processes (high confidence). There is high 
confidence that climate and land changes pose increased risks at 
certain periods of life (i.e. to the very young and ageing populations) 
as well as sustained risk to those living in poverty. Response options 
may also increase risks. For example, domestic efforts to insulate 
populations from food price spikes associated with climatic stressors 
in the mid-2000s inadequately prevented food insecurity and 
poverty, and worsened poverty globally. (Figure TS.14) {7.2.1, 7.2.2, 
7.3, Table 7.1}
There is significant regional heterogeneity in risks: tropical 
regions, including Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia and 
Central and South America are particularly vulnerable to 
decreases in crop yield (high confidence). Yield of crops in 
higher latitudes may initially benefit from warming as well as from 
higher carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. But temperate zones, 
including the Mediterranean, North Africa, the Gobi desert, Korea 
and western United States are susceptible to disruptions from 
increased drought frequency and intensity, dust storms and fires 
(high confidence). {7.2.2}
Risks related to land degradation, desertification and 
food security increase with temperature and can reverse 
development gains in some socio-economic development 
pathways (high confidence). SSP1 reduces the vulnerability 
and exposure of human and natural systems and thus limits 
risks resulting from desertification, land degradation and 
food insecurity compared to SSP3 (high confidence). SSP1 
is characterized by low population growth, reduced inequalities, 
land-use regulation, low meat consumption, increased trade and 
few barriers to adaptation or mitigation. SSP3 has the opposite 
characteristics. Under SSP1, only a small fraction of the dryland 
population (around 3% at 3°C for the year 2050) will be exposed 
and vulnerable to water stress. However under SSP3, around 20% 
of dryland populations (for the year 2050) will be exposed and 
vulnerable to water stress by 1.5°C and 24% by 3°C. Similarly under 
SSP1, at 1.5°C, 2 million people are expected to be exposed and 
vulnerable to crop yield change. Over 20 million are exposed and 
vulnerable to crop yield change in SSP3, increasing to 854 million 
people at 3°C (low confidence). Livelihoods deteriorate as a result 
of these impacts, livelihood migration is accelerated, and strife and 
conflict is worsened (medium confidence). {Cross-Chapter Box 9 in 
Chapter 6, 7.2.2, 7.3.2, Table 7.1, Figure 7.2}
Land-based adaptation and mitigation responses pose risks 
associated with the effectiveness and potential adverse side-
effects of measures chosen (medium confidence). Adverse 
side-effects on food security, ecosystem services and water security 
increase with the scale of BECCS deployment. In a SSP1 future, 
bioenergy and BECCS deployment up to 4 million km2 is compatible 
with sustainability constraints, whereas risks are already high in 
a SSP3 future for this scale of deployment. {7.2.3}
There is high confidence that policies addressing vicious 
cycles of poverty, land degradation and greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions implemented in a holistic manner can 
achieve climate-resilient sustainable development. Choice 
and implementation of policy instruments determine future 
climate and land pathways (medium confidence). Sustainable 
development pathways (described in SSP1) supported by effective 
regulation of land use to reduce environmental trade-offs, reduced 
reliance on traditional biomass, low growth in consumption and 
limited meat diets, moderate international trade with connected 
regional markets, and effective GHG mitigation instruments can 
result in lower food prices, fewer people affected by floods and other 
climatic disruptions, and increases in forested land (high agreement, 
limited evidence) (SSP1). A policy pathway with limited regulation 
of land use, low technology development, resource intensive 
consumption, constrained trade, and ineffective GHG mitigation 
instruments can result in food price increases, and significant loss 
of forest (high agreement, limited evidence) (SSP3). {3.7.5, 7.2.2, 
7.3.4, 7.5.5, 7.5.6, Table 7.1, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 6, 
Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 7}
Delaying deep mitigation in other sectors and shifting the 
burden to the land sector, increases the risk associated with 
adverse effects on food security and ecosystem services (high 
confidence). The consequences are an increased pressure on land 
with higher risk of mitigation failure and of temperature overshoot 
and a transfer of the burden of mitigation and unabated climate 
change to future generations. Prioritising early decarbonisation with 
minimal reliance on CDR decreases the risk of mitigation failure 
(high confidence). {2.5, 6.2, 6.4, 7.2.1, 7.2.2, 7.2.3, 7.5.6, 7.5.7, 
Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 6}

Technical Summary
TS
Trade-offs can occur between using land for climate mitigation 
or Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 (affordable clean 
energy) with biodiversity, food, groundwater and riverine 
ecosystem services (medium confidence). There is medium 
confidence that trade-offs currently do not figure into climate policies 
and decision making. Small hydro power installations (especially in 
clusters) can impact downstream river ecological connectivity for 
fish (high agreement, medium evidence). Large scale solar farms 
and wind turbine installations can impact endangered species and 
disrupt habitat connectivity (medium agreement, medium evidence). 
Conversion of rivers for transportation can disrupt fisheries and 
endangered species (through dredging and traffic) (medium 
agreement, low evidence). {7.5.6}
The full mitigation potential assessed in this report will 
only be realised if agricultural emissions are included in 
mainstream climate policy (high agreement, high evidence). 
Carbon markets are theoretically more cost-effective than taxation 
but challenging to implement in the land-sector (high confidence) 
Carbon pricing (through carbon markets or carbon taxes) has the 
potential to be an effective mechanism to reduce GHG emissions, 
although it remains relatively untested in agriculture and food 
systems. Equity considerations can be balanced by a mix of both 
market and non-market mechanisms (medium evidence, medium 
agreement). Emissions leakage could be reduced by multi-lateral 
action (high agreement, medium evidence). {7.4.6, 7.5.5, 7.5.6, Cross 
Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 6}
A suite of coherent climate and land policies advances 
the goal of the Paris Agreement and the land-related SDG 
targets on poverty, hunger, health, sustainable cities and 
communities, responsible consumption and production, and 
life on land. There is high confidence that acting early will 
avert or minimise risks, reduce losses and generate returns 
on investment. The economic costs of action on sustainable land 
management (SLM), mitigation, and adaptation are less than the 
consequences of inaction for humans and ecosystems (medium 
confidence). Policy portfolios that make ecological restoration more 
attractive, people more resilient – expanding financial inclusion, 
flexible carbon credits, disaster risk and health insurance, social 
protection and adaptive safety nets, contingent finance and reserve 
funds, and universal access to early warning systems – could save 
100 billion USD a year, if implemented globally. {7.3.1, 7.4.7, 7.4.8, 
7.5.6, Cross-Chapter Box 10 in Chapter 7}
Coordination of policy instruments across scales, levels, and 
sectors advances co-benefits, manages land and climate risks, 
advances food security, and addresses equity concerns (medium 
confidence). Flood resilience policies are mutually reinforcing 
and include flood zone mapping, financial incentives to move, and 
building restrictions, and insurance. Sustainability certification, 
technology transfer, land-use standards and secure land tenure 
schemes, integrated with early action and preparedness, advance 
response options. SLM improves with investment in agricultural 
research, environmental farm practices, agri-environmental payments, 
financial support for sustainable agricultural water infrastructure 
(including dugouts), agriculture emission trading, and elimination 
of agricultural subsidies (medium confidence). Drought resilience 
policies (including drought preparedness planning, early warning and 
monitoring, improving water use efficiency), synergistically improve 
agricultural producer livelihoods and foster SLM. (Figure TS.15) 
{3.7.5, Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 3, 7.4.3, 7.4.6, 7.5.6, 7.4.8, 
7.5.6, 7.6.3} 
Technology transfer in land use sectors offers new opportunities 
for adaptation, mitigation, international cooperation, R&D 
collaboration, and local engagement (medium confidence). 
International cooperation to modernise the traditional biomass 
sector will free up both land and labour for more productive uses. 
Technology transfer can assist the measurement and accounting 
of emission reductions by developing countries. {7.4.4, 7.4.6, 
Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 7}  
Measuring progress towards goals is important in decision-
making and adaptive governance to create common 
understanding and advance policy effectiveness (high 
agreement, medium evidence). Measurable indicators, selected 
with the participation of people and supporting data collection, 
are useful for climate policy development and decision-making. 
Indicators include the SDGs, nationally determined contributions 
(NDCs), land degradation neutrality (LDN) core indicators, carbon 
stock measurement, measurement and monitoring for REDD+, 
metrics for measuring biodiversity and ecosystem services, and 
governance capacity.  {7.5.5, 7.5.7, 7.6.4, 7.6.6}  
The complex spatial, cultural and temporal dynamics of risk 
and uncertainty in relation to land and climate interactions 
and food security, require a flexible, adaptive, iterative 
approach to assessing risks, revising decisions and policy 
instruments (high confidence). Adaptive, iterative decision-
making moves beyond standard economic appraisal techniques 
to new methods such as dynamic adaptation pathways with risks 
identified by trigger points through indicators. Scenarios can provide 
valuable information at all planning stages in relation to land, climate 
and food; adaptive management addresses uncertainty in scenario 
planning with pathway choices made and reassessed to respond 
to new information and data as it becomes available. {3.7.5, 7.4.4, 
7.5.2, 7.5.3, 7.5.4, 7.5.7, 7.6.1, 7.6.3}
ILK can play a key role in understanding climate processes 
and impacts, adaptation to climate change, SLM across 
different ecosystems, and enhancement of food security 
(high confidence). ILK is context-specific, collective, informally 
transmitted, and multi-functional, and can encompass factual 
information about the environment and guidance on management 
of resources and related rights and social behaviour. ILK can be 
used in decision-making at various scales and levels, and exchange 
of experiences with adaptation and mitigation that include ILK is 
both a requirement and an entry strategy for participatory climate 
communication and action. Opportunities exist for integration of ILK 
with scientific knowledge. {7.4.1, 7.4.5, 7.4.6, 7.6.4, Cross-Chapter 
Box 13 in Chapter 7}

Socio-economic choices can reduce or 
exacerbate climate related risks as well as 
influence the rate of temperature increase. 
The SSP1 pathway illustrates a world with 
low population growth, high income and 
reduced inequalities, food produced in 
low GHG emission systems, efective land 
use regulation and high adaptive capacity. 
The SSP3 pathway has the opposite 
trends. Risks are lower in SSP1 compared 
with SSP3 given the same level of 
GMST increase.
Increases in global mean surface temperature (GMST), relative to pre-industrial levels, afect processes involved in desertification 
(water scarcity), land degradation (soil erosion, vegetation loss, wildfire, permafrost thaw) and food security (crop yield and food 
supply instabilities). Changes in these processes drive risks to food systems, livelihoods, infrastructure, the value of land, and human 
and ecosystem health. Changes in one process (e.g. wildfire or water scarcity) may result in compound risks. Risks are location-specific 
and difer by region.

Technical Summary
TS
Figure TS.14 (continued): As in previous IPCC reports the literature was used to make expert judgements to assess the levels of global warming at which levels of 
risk are undetectable, moderate, high or very high, as described further in Chapter 7 and other parts of the underlying report. The figure indicates assessed risks at 
approximate warming levels which may be influenced by a variety of factors, including adaptation responses. The assessment considers adaptive capacity consistent 
with the SSP pathways as described below. Panel A: Risks to selected elements of the land system as a function of global mean surface temperature {2.1; Box 2.1; 3.5; 
3.7.1.1; 4.4.1.1; 4.4.1.2; 4.4.1.3; 5.2.2; 5.2.3; 5.2.4; 5.2.5; 7.2;7.3, Table SM7.1}. Links to broader systems are illustrative and not intended to be comprehensive. Risk 
levels are estimated assuming medium exposure and vulnerability driven by moderate trends in socioeconomic conditions broadly consistent with an SSP2 pathway. 
{Table SM7.4}. Panel B: Risks associated with desertification, land degradation and food security due to climate change and patterns of socio-economic development. 
Increasing risks associated with desertification include population exposed and vulnerable to water scarcity in drylands. Risks related to land degradation include 
increased habitat degradation, population exposed to wildfire and floods and costs of floods. Risks to food security include availability and access to food, including 
population at risk of hunger, food price increases and increases in disability adjusted life years attributable due to childhood underweight. Risks are assessed for two 
contrasted socio-economic pathways (SSP1 and SSP3 {SPM Box 1}) excluding the effects of targeted mitigation policies {3.5; 4.2.1.2; 5.2.2; 5.2.3; 5.2.4; 5.2.5; 6.1.4; 7.2, 
Table SM7.5}. Risks are not indicated beyond 3°C because SSP1 does not exceed this level of temperature change. All panels: As part of the assessment, literature was 
compiled and data extracted into a summary table. A formal expert elicitation protocol (based on modified-Delphi technique and the Sheffield Elicitation Framework), 
was followed to identify risk transition thresholds. This included a multi-round elicitation process with two rounds of independent anonymous threshold judgement, and 
a final consensus discussion. Further information on methods and underlying literature can be found in Chapter 7 Supplementary Material.
Participation of people in land and climate decision making 
and policy formation allows for transparent effective solutions 
and the implementation of response options that advance 
synergies, reduce trade-offs in sustainable land management 
(high confidence), and overcomes barriers to adaptation and 
mitigation (high confidence). Improvements to sustainable land 
management are achieved by: (1) engaging people in citizen science 
by mediating and facilitating landscape conservation planning, policy 
choice, and early warning systems (medium confidence); (2) involving 
people in identifying problems (including species decline, habitat 
loss, land use change in agriculture, food production and forestry), 
selection of indicators, collection of climate data, land modelling, 
agricultural innovation opportunities. When social learning is 
combined with collective action, transformative change can occur 
addressing tenure issues and changing land use practices (medium 
confidence). Meaningful participation overcomes barriers by opening 
up policy and science surrounding climate and land decisions to 
inclusive discussion that promotes alternatives. {3.8.5, 7.5.1, 7.5.9; 
7.6.1, 7.6.4, 7.6.5, 7.6.7, 7.7.4, 7.7.6} 
Empowering women can bolster synergies among household 
food security and sustainable land management (high 
confidence). This can be achieved with policy instruments that 
account for gender differences. The overwhelming presence of 
women in many land-based activities including agriculture provides 
opportunities to mainstream gender policies, overcome gender 
barriers, enhance gender equality, and increase sustainable land 
management and food security (high confidence). Policies that 
address barriers include gender qualifying criteria and gender 
appropriate delivery, including access to financing, information, 
technology, government transfers, training, and extension may be 
built into existing women’s programs, structures (civil society groups) 
including collective micro enterprise (medium confidence). {Cross-
Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 7} 
The significant social and political changes required for 
sustainable land use, reductions in demand and land-based 
mitigation efforts associated with climate stabilisation require 
a wide range of governance mechanisms. The expansion and 
diversification of land use and biomass systems and markets requires 
hybrid governance: public-private partnerships, transnational, 
polycentric, and state governance to insure opportunities are 
maximised, trade-offs are managed equitably, and negative impacts 
are minimised (medium confidence). {7.5.6, 7.7.2, 7.7.3, Cross-
Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 6} 
Land tenure systems have implications for both adaptation 
and mitigation, which need to be understood within specific 
socio-economic and legal contexts, and may themselves 
be impacted by climate change and climate action (limited 
evidence, high agreement). Land policy (in a diversity of forms 
beyond focus on freehold title) can provide routes to land security 
and facilitate or constrain climate action, across cropping, rangeland, 
forest, fresh-water ecosystems and other systems.  Large-scale land 
acquisitions are an important context for the relations between 
tenure security and climate change, but their scale, nature and 
implications are imperfectly understood. There is medium confidence 
that land titling and recognition programs, particularly those that 
authorise and respect indigenous and communal tenure, can lead 
to improved management of forests, including for carbon storage. 
Strong public coordination (government and public administration) 
can integrate land policy with national policies on adaptation and 
reduce sensitivities to climate change. {7.7.2; 7.7.3; 7.7.4, 7.7.5}  
Significant gaps in knowledge exist when it comes to 
understanding the effectiveness of policy instruments and 
institutions related to land use management, forestry, 
agriculture and bioenergy. Interdisciplinary research is needed 
on the impacts of policies and measures in land sectors. Knowledge 
gaps are due in part to the highly contextual and local nature of 
land and climate measures and the long time periods needed to 
evaluate land use change in its socio-economic frame, as compared 
to technological investments in energy or industry that are somewhat 
more comparable. Significant investment is needed in monitoring, 
evaluation and assessment of policy impacts across different sectors 
and levels. {7.8}

A. Sustainability-focused (SSP1)
Sustainability in land management, 
agricultural intensification,  production 
and consumption patterns result in 
reduced need for agricultural land, 
despite increases in per capita food 
consumption. This land can instead be 
used for reforestation, aforestation, 
and bioenergy.
B. Middle of the road (SSP2 )
Societal as well as technological 
development follows historical patterns. 
Increased demand for land mitigation 
options such as bioenergy, reduced 
deforestation or aforestation decreases 
availability of agricultural land for food, 
feed and fibre.
Socioeconomic development and land management influence the evolution of the land system including the relative amount of land 
allocated to CROPLAND, PASTURE, BIOENERGY CROPLAND, FOREST, and NATURAL LAND. The lines show the median across Integrated 
Assessment Models (IAMs) for three alternative shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP1, SSP2 and SSP5 at RCP1.9); shaded areas show 
the range across models. Note that pathways illustrate the efects of climate change mitigation but not those of climate change impacts 
or adaptation.
A. Pathways linking socioeconomic development, mitigation responses and land
C. Resource intensive (SSP5)
Resource-intensive production and 
consumption patterns,  results in high 
baseline emissions. Mitigation focuses 
on technological solutions including 
substantial bioenergy and BECCS . 
Intensification and competing land uses 
contribute to declines in agricultural land.

Technical Summary
TS
Figure TS.15 (continued): Future scenarios provide a framework for understanding the implications of mitigation and socioeconomics on land. The SSPs span a range 
of different socioeconomic assumptions (Box SPM.1).   They are combined with Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)2 which imply different levels of mitigation. 
The changes in cropland, pasture, bioenergy cropland, forest, and natural land from 2010 are shown. For this Figure, Cropland includes all land in food, feed, and fodder 
crops, as well as other arable land (cultivated area). This category includes first generation non-forest bioenergy crops (e.g., corn for ethanol, sugar cane for ethanol, 
soybeans for biodiesel), but excludes second generation bioenergy crops. Pasture includes categories of pasture land, not only high-quality rangeland, and is based on 
FAO definition of ‘permanent meadows and pastures’. Bioenergy cropland includes land dedicated to second generation energy crops (e.g., switchgrass, miscanthus, 
fast-growing wood species). Forest includes managed and unmanaged forest. Natural land includes other grassland, savannah, and shrubland. Panel A: This panel shows 
integrated assessment model (IAM)3  results for SSP1, SSP2 and SSP5 at RCP1.9.4 For each pathway, the shaded areas show the range across all IAMs; the line indicates 
the median across models. For RCP1.9, SSP1, SSP2 and SSP5 results are from five, four and two IAMs respectively. Panel B: Land use and land cover change are indicated 
for various SSP-RCP combinations, showing multi-model median and range (min, max). (Box SPM.1) {1.3.2, 2.7.2, 6.1, 6.4.4, 7.4.2, 7.4.4, 7.4.5, 7.4.6, 7.4.7, 7.4.8, 7.5.3, 
7.5.6, Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 6}
2 Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) are scenarios that include timeseries of emissions and concentrations of the full suite of GHGs and aerosols and chemically active 
 
 gases, as well as land use/land cover.
3 Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) integrate knowledge from two or more domains into a single framework. In this figure, IAMs are used to assess linkages between economic,  
 
 social and technological development and the evolution of the climate system.
4 The RCP1.9 pathways assessed in this report have a 66% chance of limiting warming to 1.5°C in 2100, but some of these pathways overshoot 1.5°C of warming during the 21st century by >0.1°C.
