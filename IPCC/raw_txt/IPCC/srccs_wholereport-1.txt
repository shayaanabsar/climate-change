his Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report provides information
for policymakers, scientists and engineers in the field of climate change and reduction of
CO2 emissions. It describes sources, capture, transport, and storage of CO2. It also discusses the
costs, economic potential, and societal issues of the technology, including public perception and
regulatory aspects. Storage options evaluated include geological storage, ocean storage, and min-
eral carbonation. Notably, the report places CO2 capture and storage in the context of other
climate change mitigation options, such as fuel switch, energy efficiency, renewables and nuclear
energy. 
This report shows that the potential of CO2 capture and storage is considerable, and the costs for
mitigating climate change can be decreased compared to strategies where only other climate
change mitigation options are considered. The importance of future capture and storage of CO2
for mitigating climate change will depend on a number of factors, including financial incentives
provided for deployment, and whether the risks of storage can be successfully managed. The vol-
ume includes a Summary for Policymakers approved by governments represented in the IPCC, and
a Technical Summary.
The IPCC Special Report on Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage provides invaluable infor-
mation for researchers in environmental science, geology, engineering and the oil and gas sector,
policymakers in governments and environmental organizations, and scientists and engineers in
industry. 
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was established jointly by the World Mete-
orological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). The Panel
provides authoritative international assessments of scientific information on climate change.
This report was produced by the IPCC on the invitation of the United Nations Framework Con-

Foreword
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was 
jointly established by the World Meteorological Organization 
(WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme 
(UNEP) in 1988. Its terms of reference include: (i) to assess 
available scientific and socio-economic information on climate 
change and its impacts and on the options for mitigating 
climate change and adapting to it and (ii) to provide, on 
request, scientific/technical/socio-economic advice to the 
Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). From 
1990, the IPCC has produced a series of Assessment Reports, 
Special Reports, Technical Papers, methodologies and other 
products that have become standard works of reference, 
widely used by policymakers, scientists and other experts. 
At COP7, a draft decision was taken to invite the IPCC 
to write a technical paper on geological storage of carbon 
dioxidea. In response to that, at its 20th Session in 2003 in 
Paris, France, the IPCC agreed on the development of the 
Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage.
This volume, the Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture 
and Storage, has been produced by Working Group III of 
the IPCC and focuses on carbon dioxide capture and storage 
(CCS) as an option for mitigation of climate change. It 
consists of 9 chapters covering sources of CO2, the technical 
specifics of capturing, transporting and storing it in geological 
formations, the ocean, or minerals, or utilizing it in industrial 
processes. It also assesses the costs and potential of CCS, the 
environmental impacts, risks and safety, its implications for 
greenhouse gas inventories and accounting, public perception, 
and legal issues. 
As is usual in the IPCC, success in producing this report has 
depended first and foremost on the knowledge, enthusiasm 
and cooperation of many hundreds of experts worldwide, 
in many related but different disciplines. We would like to 
express our gratitude to all the Coordinating Lead Authors, 
Lead Authors, Contributing Authors, Review Editors and 
Expert Reviewers. These individuals have devoted enormous 
time and effort to produce this report and we are extremely 
grateful for their commitment to the IPCC process. We would 
like to thank the staff of the Working Group III Technical 
Support Unit and the IPCC Secretariat for their dedication in 
coordinating the production of another successful IPCC report. 
We are also grateful to the governments, who have supported 
their scientists’ participation in the IPCC process and who 
have contributed to the IPCC Trust Fund to provide for the 
essential participation of experts from developing countries 
and countries with economies in transition. We would like 
to express our appreciation to the governments of Norway, 
Australia, Brazil and Spain, who hosted drafting sessions in 
their countries, and especially the government of Canada, 
that hosted a workshop on this subject as well as the 8th 
session of Working Group III for official consideration and 
acceptance of the report in Montreal, and to the government of 
The Netherlands, who funds the Working Group III Technical 
Support Unit. 
We would particularly like to thank Dr. Rajendra Pachauri, 
Chairman of the IPCC, for his direction and guidance of 
the IPCC, Dr. Renate Christ, the Secretary of the IPCC and 
her staff for the support provided, and Professor Ogunlade 
Davidson and Dr. Bert Metz, the Co-Chairmen of Working 
Group III, for their leadership of Working Group III through 
the production of this report.

IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
Preface
This Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and 
Storage (SRCCS) has been prepared under the auspices of 
Working Group III (Mitigation of Climate Change) of the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The 
report has been developed in response to an invitation of the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
(UNFCCC) at its seventh Conference of Parties (COP7) in 
2001. In April 2002, at its 19th Session in Geneva, the IPCC 
decided to hold a workshop, which took place in November 
2002 in Regina, Canada. The results of this workshop were a 
first assessment of literature on CO2 capture and storage, and 
a proposal for a Special Report. At its 20th Session in 2003 
in Paris, France, the IPCC endorsed this proposal and agreed 
on the outline and timetableb. Working Group III was charged 
to assess the scientific, technical, environmental, economic, 
and social aspects of capture and storage of CO2. The 
mandate of the report therefore included the assessment of the 
technological maturity, the technical and economic potential 
to contribute to mitigation of climate change, and the costs. It 
also included legal and regulatory issues, public perception, 
environmental impacts and safety as well as issues related 
to inventories and accounting of greenhouse gas emission 
reductions. 
This report primarily assesses literature published after the 
Third Assessment Report (2001) on CO2 sources, capture 
systems, transport and various storage mechanisms. It does 
not cover biological carbon sequestration by land use, land use 
change and forestry, or by fertilization of oceans. The report 
builds upon the contribution of Working Group III to the Third 
Assessment Report Climate Change 2001 (Mitigation), and 
on the Special Report on Emission Scenarios of 2000, with 
respect to CO2 capture and storage in a portfolio of mitigation 
options. It identifies those gaps in knowledge that would need 
to be addressed in order to facilitate large-scale deployment. 
The structure of the report follows the components of a CO2 
capture and storage system. An introductory chapter outlines 
the general framework for the assessment and provides a 
brief overview of CCS systems. Chapter 2 characterizes the 
major sources of CO2 that are technically and economically 
suitable for capture, in order to assess the feasibility of CCS 
on a global scale. Technological options for CO2 capture are 
discussed extensively in Chapter 3, while Chapter 4 focuses on 
methods of CO2 transport. In the next three chapters, each of 
the major storage options is then addressed: geological storage 
(chapter 5), ocean storage (chapter 6), and mineral carbonation 
and industrial uses (chapter 7). The overall costs and economic 
potential of CCS are discussed in Chapter 8, followed by an 
examination of the implications of CCS for greenhouse gas 
inventories and emissions accounting (chapter 9). 
The report has been written by almost 100 Lead and 
Coordinating Lead Authors and 25 Contributing Authors, all 
of whom have expended a great deal of time and effort. They 
came from industrialized countries, developing countries, 
countries with economies in transition and international 
organizations. The report has been reviewed by more than 
200 people (both individual experts and representatives of 
governments) from around the world. The review process 
was overseen by 19 Review Editors, who ensured that all 
comments received the proper attention.
In accordance with IPCC Procedures, the Summary for 
Policymakers of this report has been approved line-by-line 
by governments at the IPCC Working Group III Session in 
Montreal, Canada, from September 22-24, 2005. During the 
approval process the Lead Authors confirmed that the agreed 
text of the Summary for Policymakers is fully consistent with 
the underlying full report and technical summary, both of 
which have been accepted by governments, but remain the full 
responsibility of the authors.
We wish to express our gratitude to the governments that 
provided financial and in-kind support for the hosting of the 
various meetings that were essential to complete this report. 
We are particularly are grateful to the Canadian Government 
for hosting both the Workshop in Regina, November 18-22, 
2002, as well as the Working Group III approval session in 
Montreal, September 22-24, 2005. The writing team of this 
report met four times to draft the report and discuss the results 
of the two consecutive formal IPCC review rounds. The 
meetings were kindly hosted by the government of Norway 
(Oslo, July 2003), Australia (Canberra, December 2003), 
Brazil (Salvador, August 2004) and Spain (Oviedo, April 
2005), respectively. In addition, many individual meetings, 
teleconferences and interactions with governments have 
contributed to the successful completion of this report.

Summary for Policymakers
What is CO2 capture and storage and how could it 
contribute to mitigating climate change?
1. Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage (CCS) is a 
process consisting of the separation of CO2 from industrial 
and energy-related sources, transport to a storage location 
and long-term isolation from the atmosphere. This report 
considers CCS as an option in the portfolio of mitigation 
actions for stabilization of atmospheric greenhouse gas 
concentrations. 
Other 
mitigation 
options 
include 
energy 
efficiency 
improvements, the switch to less carbon-intensive fuels, 
nuclear power, renewable energy sources, enhancement of 
biological sinks, and reduction of non-CO2 greenhouse gas 
emissions. CCS has the potential to reduce overall mitigation 
costs and increase flexibility in achieving greenhouse gas 
emission reductions. The widespread application of CCS 
would depend on technical maturity, costs, overall potential, 
diffusion and transfer of the technology to developing 
countries and their capacity to apply the technology, regulatory 
aspects, environmental issues and public perception (Sections 
1.1.1, 1.3, 1.7, 8.3.3.4).
2. The Third Assessment Report (TAR) indicates that no 
single technology option will provide all of the emission 
reductions needed to achieve stabilization, but a portfolio 
of mitigation measures will be needed.
Most scenarios project that the supply of primary energy 
will continue to be dominated by fossil fuels until at least 
the middle of the century.  As discussed in the TAR, most 
models also indicate that known technological options1 could 
achieve a broad range of atmospheric stabilization levels 
but that implementation would require socio-economic and 
institutional changes.  In this context, the availability of 
CCS in the portfolio of options could facilitate achieving 
stabilization goals (Sections 1.1, 1.3). 
What are the characteristics of CCS?
3.  Capture of CO2 can be applied to large point sources. 
The CO2 would then be compressed and transported for 
storage in geological formations, in the ocean, in mineral 
carbonates2, or for use in industrial processes. 
Large point sources of CO2 include large fossil fuel or 
biomass energy facilities, major CO2-emitting industries, 
natural gas production, synthetic fuel plants and fossil 
fuel-based hydrogen production plants (see Table SPM.1). 
Potential technical storage methods are: geological storage (in 
geological formations, such as oil and gas fields, unminable 
coal beds and deep saline formations3), ocean storage (direct 
release into the ocean water column or onto the deep seafloor) 
and industrial fixation of CO2 into inorganic carbonates. 
This report also discusses industrial uses of CO2, but this 
is not expected to contribute much to the reduction of CO2

1  “Known technological options” refer to technologies that exist in operation or in the pilot plant stage at the present time, as referenced in the mitigation scenarios 
discussed in the TAR. It does not include any new technologies that.will require profound technological breakthroughs. Known technological options are 
explained in the TAR and several mitigation scenarios include CCS
2  Storage of CO2 as mineral carbonates does not cover deep geological carbonation or ocean storage with enhanced carbonate neutralization as discussed in 
Chapter 6 (Section 7.2).
3  Saline formations are sedimentary rocks saturated with formation waters containing high concentrations of dissolved salts. They are widespread and contain 
enormous quantities of water that are unsuitable for agriculture or human consumption. Because the use of geothermal energy is likely to increase, potential 
geothermal areas may not be suitable for CO2 storage (see Section 5.3.3).

Summary for Policymakers
emissions (see Figure SPM.1) (Sections 1.2, 1.4, 2.2, Table 
2.3).
4. The net reduction of emissions to the atmosphere through 
CCS depends on the fraction of CO2 captured, the 
increased CO2 production resulting from loss in overall 
efficiency of power plants or industrial processes due to 
the additional energy required for capture, transport and 
storage, any leakage from transport and the fraction of 
CO2 retained in storage over the long term. 
Available technology captures about 85–95% of the CO2 
processed in a capture plant. A power plant equipped with 
a CCS system (with access to geological or ocean storage) 
would need roughly 10–40%4 more energy than a plant of 
equivalent output without CCS, of which most is for capture 
and compression. For secure storage, the net result is that a 
power plant with CCS could reduce CO2 emissions to the 
atmosphere by approximately 80–90% compared to a plant 
without CCS (see Figure SPM.2).  To the extent that leakage 
might occur from a storage reservoir, the fraction retained is 
defined as the fraction of the cumulative amount of injected 
CO2 that is retained over a specified period of time. CCS 
systems with storage as mineral carbonates would need 60–

The increased CO2 production resulting from the loss in overall 
efficiency of power plants due to the additional energy required for 
capture, transport and storage and any leakage from transport result 
in a larger amount of “CO2 produced per unit of product” (lower 
bar) relative to the reference plant (upper bar) without capture  
(Figure 8.2).
4 The range reflects three types of power plants: for Natural Gas Combined Cycle plants, the range is 11–22%, for Pulverized Coal plants, 24–40% and for   
  Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle plants, 14–25%.
5
Summary for Policymakers
180% more energy than a plant of equivalent output without 
CCS. (Sections 1.5.1, 1.6.3, 3.6.1.3, 7.2.7).
What is the current status of CCS technology?
5. There are different types of CO2 capture systems: post-
combustion, pre-combustion and oxyfuel combustion 
(Figure SPM.3). The concentration of CO2 in the gas 
stream, the pressure of the gas stream and the fuel type 
(solid or gas) are important factors in selecting the 
capture system. 
Post-combustion capture of CO2 in power plants is 
economically feasible under specific conditions5. It is used 
to capture CO2 from part of the flue gases from a number 
of existing power plants. Separation of CO2 in the natural 
gas processing industry, which uses similar technology, 
operates in a mature market6. The technology required 
for pre-combustion capture is widely applied in fertilizer 
manufacturing and in hydrogen production. Although the 
initial fuel conversion steps of pre-combustion are more 
elaborate and costly, the higher concentrations of CO2
 in the 
gas stream and the higher pressure make the separation easier. 
Oxyfuel combustion is in the demonstration phase7 and uses 
high purity oxygen. This results in high CO2 concentrations 
in the gas stream and, hence, in easier separation of CO2 and 
in increased energy requirements in the separation of oxygen 
from air (Sections 3.3, 3.4, 3.5).
6. Pipelines are preferred for transporting large amounts of 
CO2 for distances up to around 1,000 km. For amounts 
smaller than a few million tonnes of CO2 per year or 
for larger distances overseas, the use of ships, where 
applicable, could be economically more attractive. 
Pipeline transport of CO2 operates as a mature market 
technology (in the USA, over 2,500 km of pipelines 
transport more than 40 MtCO2 per year). In most gas 
pipelines, compressors at the upstream end drive the flow, 
but some pipelines need intermediate compressor stations. 
Dry CO2 is not corrosive to pipelines, even if the CO2 
contains contaminants. Where the CO2 contains moisture, it 
is removed from the CO2 stream to prevent corrosion and 
to avoid the costs of constructing pipelines of corrosion-

(including hydrogen and fertilizer production), post-combustion and industrial sources of CO2 (including natural gas processing facilities and 
steel and cement production) (based on Figure 3.1) (Courtesy CO2CRC).
5  “Economically feasible under specific conditions” means that the technology is well understood and used in selected commercial applications, such as in a 
favourable tax regime or a niche market, processing at least 0.1 MtCO2 yr-1 , with few (less than 5) replications of the technology.
6  “Mature market” means that the technology is now in operation with multiple replications of the commercial-scale technology worldwide.
7  “Demonstration phase” means that the technology has been built and operated at the scale of a pilot plant but that further development is required before the 
technology is ready for the design and construction of a full-scale system.

Summary for Policymakers
resistant material. Shipping of CO2, analogous to shipping 
of liquefied petroleum gases, is economically feasible under 
specific conditions but is currently carried out on a small scale 
due to limited demand. CO2 can also be carried by rail and 
road tankers, but it is unlikely that these could be attractive 
options for large-scale CO2 transportation (Sections 4.2.1, 
4.2.2, 4.3.2, Figure 4.5, 4.6). 
7. Storage of CO2 in deep, onshore or offshore geological 
formations uses many of the same technologies that 
have been developed by the oil and gas industry and has 
been proven to be economically feasible under specific 
conditions for oil and gas fields and saline formations, 
but not yet for storage in unminable coal beds8 (see 
Figure SPM.4). 
If CO2 is injected into suitable saline formations or oil or 
gas fields, at depths below 800 m9, various physical and 
geochemical trapping mechanisms would prevent it from 
migrating to the surface. In general, an essential physical 
trapping mechanism is the presence of a caprock10. Coal bed 
storage may take place at shallower depths and relies on the 
adsorption of CO2 on the coal, but the technical feasibility 
largely depends on the permeability of the coal bed. The 
combination of CO2 storage with Enhanced Oil Recovery 
(EOR11) or, potentially, Enhanced Coal Bed Methane recovery 
(ECBM) could lead to additional revenues from the oil or 
gas recovery. Well-drilling technology, injection technology, 
computer simulation of storage reservoir performance and 
monitoring methods from existing applications are being

8  A coal bed that is unlikely to ever be mined – because it is too deep or too thin – may be potentially used for CO2 storage. If subsequently mined, the stored CO2 
would be released. Enhanced Coal Bed Methane (ECBM) recovery could potentially increase methane production from coals while simultaneously storing CO2. 
The produced methane would be used and not released to the atmosphere (Section 5.3.4).
9  At depths below 800–1,000 m, CO2 becomes supercritical and has a liquid-like density (about 500–800 kg m-3) that provides the potential for efficient utilization 
of underground storage space and improves storage security (Section 5.1.1).

Summary for Policymakers
developed further for utilization in the design and operation 
of geological storage projects. 
 
Three industrial-scale12 storage projects are in operation: 
the Sleipner project in an offshore saline formation in Norway, 
the Weyburn EOR project in Canada, and the In Salah project 
in a gas field in Algeria. Others are planned (Sections 5.1.1, 
5.2.2, 5.3, 5.6, 5.9.4, Boxes 5.1, 5.2, 5.3).
8. Ocean storage potentially could be done in two ways: 
by injecting and dissolving CO2 into the water column 
(typically below 1,000 meters) via a fixed pipeline or a 
moving ship, or by depositing it via a fixed pipeline or 
an offshore platform onto the sea floor at depths below 
3,000 m, where CO2 is denser than water and is expected 
to form a “lake” that would delay dissolution of CO2 into 
the surrounding environment (see Figure SPM.5). Ocean 
storage and its ecological impacts are still in the research 
phase13. 
The dissolved and dispersed CO2 would become part of the 
global carbon cycle and eventually equilibrate with the CO2 
in the atmosphere. In laboratory experiments, small-scale 
ocean experiments and model simulations, the technologies 
and associated physical and chemical phenomena, which 
include, notably, increases in acidity (lower pH) and their 
effect on marine ecosystems, have been studied for a range 
of ocean storage options (Sections 6.1.2, 6.2.1, 6.5, 6.7). 
9. The reaction of CO2 with metal oxides, which are 
abundant in silicate minerals and available in small 
quantities in waste streams, produces stable carbonates. 
The technology is currently in the research stage, but 
certain applications in using waste streams are in the 
demonstration phase. 
The natural reaction is very slow and has to be enhanced by 
pre-treatment of the minerals, which at present is very energy 
intensive (Sections 7.2.1, 7.2.3, 7.2.4, Box 7.1).
Figure SPM.5.  Overview of ocean storage concepts. In “dissolution type” ocean storage, the CO2 rapidly dissolves in the ocean water, 
whereas in “lake type” ocean storage, the CO2 is initially a liquid on the sea floor (Courtesy CO2CRC).
12 “Industrial-scale” here means on the order of 1 MtCO2 per year.
13  “Research phase” means that while the basic science is understood, the technology is currently in the stage of conceptual design or testing at the laboratory or 
bench scale and has not been demonstrated in a pilot plant.

Summary for Policymakers
10. Industrial uses14 of captured CO2 as a gas or liquid or as 
a feedstock in chemical processes that produce valuable 
carbon-containing products are possible, but are not 
expected to contribute to significant abatement of CO2 
emissions. 
The potential for industrial uses of CO2 is small, while the 
CO2 is generally retained for short periods (usually months 
or years). Processes using captured CO2 as feedstock instead 
of fossil hydrocarbons do not always achieve net lifecycle 
emission reductions (Sections 7.3.1, 7.3.4).
11. Components of CCS are in various stages of development 
(see Table SPM.2). Complete CCS systems can be 
assembled from existing technologies that are mature or 
economically feasible under specific conditions, although 
the state of development of the overall system may be less 
than some of its separate components. 
There is relatively little experience in combining CO2 capture, 
transport and storage into a fully integrated CCS system. The 
utilization of CCS for large-scale power plants (the potential 
application of major interest) still remains to be implemented 
(Sections 1.4.4, 3.8, 5.1).
What is the geographical relationship between the 
sources and storage opportunities for CO2?
12. Large point sources of CO2 are concentrated in proximity 
to major industrial and urban areas. Many such sources 
are within 300 km of areas that potentially hold formations 
suitable for geological storage (see Figure SPM.6). 
Preliminary research suggests that, globally, a small 
proportion of large point sources is close to potential 
ocean storage locations.

Summary for Policymakers
Currently available literature regarding the matches between 
large CO2 point sources with suitable geological storage 
formations is limited. Detailed regional assessments may be 
necessary to improve information (see Figure SPM.6b).
 
Scenario studies indicate that the number of large point 
sources is projected to increase in the future, and that, by 
2050, given expected technical limitations, around 20–40% of 
global fossil fuel CO2 emissions could be technically suitable 
for capture, including 30–60% of the CO2 emissions from 
electricity generation and 30–40% of those from industry. 
Emissions from large-scale biomass conversion facilities 
could also be technically suitable for capture. The proximity 
of future large point sources to potential storage sites has not 
been studied (Sections 2.3, 2.4.3).
13. CCS enables the control of the CO2 emissions from fossil 
fuel-based production of electricity or hydrogen, which 
in the longer term could reduce part of the dispersed CO2

on global emission sources; IEA GHG 2002)

Summary for Policymakers
emissions from transport and distributed energy supply 
systems. 
Electricity could be used in vehicles, and hydrogen could 
be used in fuel cells, including in the transport sector. Gas 
and coal conversion with integrated CO2 separation (without 
storage) is currently the dominant option for the production 
of hydrogen. More fossil fuel or biomass-based hydrogen or 
electricity production would result in an increased number of 
large CO2 sources that are technically suitable for capture and 
storage. At present, it is difficult to project the likely number, 
location and size of such sources (Sections 2.5.1).
What are the costs15 for CCS and what is  
the technical and economic potential?
14. Application of CCS to electricity production, under 2002 
conditions, is estimated to increase electricity generation 
costs by about 0.01–0.05 US dollars16 per kilowatt 
hour (US$/kWh), depending on the fuel, the specific 
technology, the location and the national circumstances. 
Inclusion of the benefits of EOR would reduce additional 
electricity production costs due to CCS by around 0.01–
0.02 US$/kWh17 (see Table SPM.3 for absolute electricity 
production costs and Table SPM.4 for costs in US$/tCO2 
avoided). Increases in market prices of fuels used for 
power generation would generally tend to increase the 
cost of CCS. The quantitative impact of oil price on CCS is 
uncertain.  However, revenue from EOR would generally 
be higher with higher oil prices. While applying CCS to 
biomass-based power production at the current small 
scale would add substantially to the electricity costs, co-
firing of biomass in a larger coal-fired power plant with 
CCS would be more cost-effective. 
Costs vary considerably in both absolute and relative terms 
from country to country. Since neither Natural Gas Combined 
Cycle, Pulverized Coal nor Integrated Gasification Combined 
Cycle systems have yet been built at a full scale with CCS, 
the costs of these systems cannot be stated with a high degree 
of confidence at this time. In the future, the costs of CCS 
could be reduced by research and technological development 
and economies of scale. Economies of scale could also 
considerably bring down the cost of biomass-based CCS 
systems over time. The application of CCS to biomass-
fuelled or co-fired conversion facilities would lead to lower 
or negative18 CO2 emissions, which could reduce the costs for 
this option, depending on the market value of CO2 emission 
reductions (Sections 2.5.3, 3.7.1, 3.7.13, 8.2.4). 
15. Retrofitting existing plants with CO2 capture is expected 
to lead to higher costs and significantly reduced overall 
efficiencies than for newly built power plants with capture. 
The cost disadvantages of retrofitting may be reduced 
in the case of some relatively new and highly efficient 
existing plants or where a plant is substantially upgraded 
or rebuilt. 
The costs of retrofitting CCS to existing installations vary. 
Industrial sources of CO2 can more easily be retrofitted 
with CO2 separation, while integrated power plant systems 
would need more profound adjustment. In order to reduce 
future retrofit costs, new plant designs could take future CCS 
application into account (Sections 3.1.4, 3.7.5).
16. In most CCS systems, the cost of capture (including 
compression) is the largest cost component. 
Costs for the various components of a CCS system vary 
widely, depending on the reference plant and the wide range 
Table SPM.3.  Costs of CCS: production costs of electricity for different types of generation, without capture and for the CCS system as a 
whole. The cost of a full CCS system for electricity generation from a newly built, large-scale fossil fuel-based power plant depends on a 
number of factors, including the characteristics of both the power plant and the capture system, the specifics of the storage site, the amount of 
CO2 and the required transport distance. The numbers assume experience with a large-scale plant. Gas prices are assumed to be 2.8-4.4 US$ per 
gigajoule (GJ), and coal prices 1-1.5 US$ GJ-1 (based on Tables 8.3 and 8.4).

15  As used in this report, “costs” refer only to market prices but do not include external costs such as environmental damages and broader societal costs that may 
be associated with the use of CCS. To date, little has been done to assess and quantify such external costs.

negative.
11
Summary for Policymakers
in CO2 source, transport and storage situations (see Table 
SPM.5). Over the next decade, the cost of capture could be 
reduced by 20–30%, and more should be achievable by new 
technologies that are still in the research or demonstration 
phase. The costs of transport and storage of CO2 could 
decrease slowly as the technology matures further and the 
scale increases (Sections 1.5.3, 3.7.13, 8.2).
17. Energy and economic models indicate that the CCS 
system’s major contribution to climate change mitigation 
would come from deployment in the electricity sector. Most 
modelling as assessed in this report suggests that CCS 
systems begin to deploy at a significant level when CO2 
prices begin to reach approximately 25–30 US$/tCO2. 
Low-cost capture possibilities (in gas processing and in 
hydrogen and ammonia manufacture, where separation of 
CO2 is already done) in combination with short (<50 km) 
transport distances and storage options that generate revenues 
(such as EOR) can lead to the limited storage of CO2 (up to 
360 MtCO2 yr-1) under circumstances of low or no incentives 
(Sections 2.2.1.3, 2.3, 2.4, 8.3.2.1)

without CCS and power plants with CCS (geological and EOR). The amount of CO2 avoided is the difference between the emissions of the

(based on Tables 8.3a and 8.4).

Summary for Policymakers
18. Available evidence suggests that, worldwide, it is likely19 
that there is a technical potential20 of at least about 
2,000 GtCO2 (545 GtC) of storage capacity in geological 
formations21. 
There could be a much larger potential for geological storage 
in saline formations, but the upper limit estimates are uncertain 
due to lack of information and an agreed methodology. The 
capacity of oil and gas reservoirs is better known. Technical 
storage capacity in coal beds is much smaller and less well 
known. 
 
Model calculations for the capacity to store CO2 in the 
oceans indicate that this capacity could be on the order of 
thousands of GtCO2, depending on the assumed stabilization 
level in the atmosphere22 and on environmental constraints 
such as ocean pH change. The extent to which mineral 
carbonation may be used can currently not be determined, 
since it depends on the unknown amount of silicate reserves 
that can be technically exploited and on environmental issues 
such as the volume of product disposal (Sections 5.3, 6.3.1, 
7.2.3, Table 5.2).
19. In most scenarios for stabilization of atmospheric 
greenhouse gas concentrations between 450 and 750 ppmv 
CO2 and in a least-cost portfolio of mitigation options, 
the economic potential23 of CCS would amount to 220–
2,200 GtCO2 (60–600 GtC) cumulatively, which would 
mean that CCS contributes 15–55% to the cumulative 
mitigation effort worldwide until 2100, averaged over a 
range of baseline scenarios. It is likely20 that the technical 
potential21 for geological storage is sufficient to cover the 
high end of the economic potential range, but for specific 
regions, this may not be true. 
Uncertainties in these economic potential estimates are 
significant. For CCS to achieve such an economic potential, 
several hundreds to thousands of CO2 capture systems would 
need to be installed over the coming century, each capturing 
some 1–5 MtCO2 per year. The actual implementation of 
CCS, as for other mitigation options, is likely to be lower than 
the economic potential due to factors such as environmental 
impacts, risks of leakage and the lack of a clear legal 
framework or public acceptance (Sections 1.4.4, 5.3.7, 8.3.1, 
8.3.3, 8.3.3.4). 
.
20.In most scenario studies, the role of CCS in mitigation 
portfolios increases over the course of the century, and 
the inclusion of CCS in a mitigation portfolio is found 
to reduce the costs of stabilizing CO2 concentrations by 
30% or more. 
One aspect of the cost competitiveness of CCS systems is 
that CCS technologies are compatible with most current 
energy infrastructures.
 
The global potential contribution of CCS as part of a 
mitigation portfolio is illustrated by the examples given in 
Figure SPM.7. The present extent of analyses in this field is 
limited, and further assessments may be necessary to improve 
information (Sections 1.5, 8.3.3, 8.3.3.4, Box 8.3).
What are the local health, safety and  
environment risks of CCS?
21. The local risks24 associated with CO2 pipeline transport 
could be similar to or lower than those posed by 
hydrocarbon pipelines already in operation. 
For existing CO2 pipelines, mostly in areas of low population 
density, accident numbers reported per kilometre pipeline 
are very low and are comparable to those for hydrocarbon 
pipelines. A sudden and large release of CO2 would pose 
immediate dangers to human life and health, if there were 
exposure to concentrations of CO2 greater than 7–10% by 
volume in air. Pipeline transport of CO2 through populated 
areas requires attention to route selection, overpressure 
protection, leak detection and other design factors. No major 
obstacles to pipeline design for CCS are foreseen (Sections 
4.4.2, AI.2.3.1).
22. With appropriate site selection based on available 
subsurface information, a monitoring programme to detect 
problems, a regulatory system and the appropriate use of 
remediation methods to stop or control CO2 releases if 
they arise, the local health, safety and environment risks 
of geological storage would be comparable to the risks of 
current activities such as natural gas storage, EOR and 
deep underground disposal of acid gas.
Natural CO2 reservoirs contribute to the understanding of the 
behaviour of CO2 underground. Features of storage sites with 
a low probability of leakage include highly impermeable 
caprocks, geological stability, absence of leakage paths 
19 “Likely” is a probability between 66 and 90%.
20  “Technical potential” as defined in the TAR is the amount by which it is possible to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by implementing a technology or practice 
that already has been demonstrated
21  This statement is based on the expert judgment of the authors of the available literature. It reflects the uncertainty about the storage capacity estimates (Section 
5.3.7)
22  This approach takes into account that the CO 2 injected in the ocean will after some time reach equilibrium with the atmosphere.
23  Economic potential is the amount of greenhouse gas emissions reductions from a specific option that could be achieved cost-effectively, given prevailing 
circumstances (i.e. a market value of CO2 reductions and costs of other options).
24 In discussing the risks, we assume that risk is the product of the probability that an event will occur and the consequences of the event if it does occur.
13
Summary for Policymakers
and effective trapping mechanisms. There are two different 
types of leakage scenarios: (1) abrupt leakage, through 
injection well failure or leakage up an abandoned well, and 
(2) gradual leakage, through undetected faults, fractures or 
wells. Impacts of elevated CO2 concentrations in the shallow 
subsurface could include lethal effects on plants and subsoil 
animals and the contamination of groundwater. High fluxes 
in conjunction with stable atmospheric conditions could lead 
to local high CO2 concentrations in the air that could harm 
animals or people. Pressure build-up caused by CO2 injection 
could trigger small seismic events. 
 
While there is limited experience with geological storage, 
closely related industrial experience and scientific knowledge 
could serve as a basis for appropriate risk management, 
including remediation. The effectiveness of the available 
risk management methods still needs to be demonstrated

Summary for Policymakers
for use with CO2 storage. If leakage occurs at a storage site, 
remediation to stop the leakage could involve standard well 
repair techniques or the interception and extraction of the 
CO2 before it would leak into a shallow groundwater aquifer. 
Given the long timeframes associated with geological storage 
of CO2, site monitoring may be required for very long periods 
(Sections 5.6, 5.7, Tables 5.4, 5.7, Figure 5.25). 
23. Adding CO2 to the ocean or forming pools of liquid 
CO2 on the ocean floor at industrial scales will alter the 
local chemical environment. Experiments have shown 
that sustained high concentrations of CO2 would cause 
mortality of ocean organisms. CO2 effects on marine 
organisms will have ecosystem consequences. The 
chronic effects of direct CO2 injection into the ocean on 
ecosystems over large ocean areas and long time scales 
have not yet been studied. 
Model simulations, assuming a release from seven locations 
at an ocean depth of 3,000 m, where ocean storage provides 
10% of the mitigation effort for stabilization at 550 ppmv 
CO2, resulted in acidity increases (pH decrease >0.4) over 
approximately 1% of the ocean volume. For comparison 
purposes: in such a stabilization case without ocean storage, 
a pH decrease >0.25 relative to pre-industrial levels at 
the entire ocean surface can be expected. A 0.2 to 0.4 pH 
decrease is significantly greater than pre-industrial variations 
in average ocean acidity. At these levels of pH change, some 
effects have been found in organisms that live near the 
ocean’s surface, but chronic effects have not yet been studied. 
A better understanding of these impacts is required before a 
comprehensive risk assessment can be accomplished. There 
is no known mechanism for the sudden or catastrophic release 
of stored CO2 from the ocean to the atmosphere. Gradual 
release is discussed in SPM paragraph 26. Conversion of 
molecular CO2 to bicarbonates or hydrates before or during 
CO2 release would reduce the pH effects and enhance the 
retention of CO2 in the ocean, but this would also increase the 
costs and other environmental impacts (Section 6.7).
 
24. Environmental impacts of large-scale mineral carbonation 
would be a consequence of the required mining and 
disposal of resulting products that have no practical use. 
 
Industrial fixation of one tonne of CO2 requires between 
1.6 and 3.7 tonnes of silicate rock. The impacts of mineral 
carbonation are similar to those of large-scale surface mines. 
They include land-clearing, decreased local air quality and 
affected water and vegetation as a result of drilling, moving 
of earth and the grading and leaching of metals from mining 
residues, all of which indirectly may also result in habitat 
degradation. Most products of mineral carbonation need to 
be disposed of, which would require landfills and additional 
transport (Sections 7.2.4, 7.2.6).
Will physical leakage of stored CO2 compromise  
CCS as a climate change mitigation option?
25. Observations from engineered and natural analogues 
as well as models suggest that the fraction retained 
in appropriately selected and managed geological 
reservoirs is very likely25 to exceed 99% over 100 years 
and is likely20 to exceed 99% over 1,000 years. 
For well-selected, designed and managed geological 
storage sites, the vast majority of the CO2 will gradually be 
immobilized by various trapping mechanisms and, in that 
case, could be retained for up to millions of years. Because of 
these mechanisms, storage could become more secure over 
longer timeframes (Sections 1.6.3, 5.2.2, 5.7.3.4, Table 5.5). 
26. Release of CO2 from ocean storage would be gradual 
over hundreds of years.
Ocean tracer data and model calculations indicate that, in the 
case of ocean storage, depending on the depth of injection 
and the location, the fraction retained is 65–100% after 100 
years and 30–85% after 500 years (a lower percentage for 
injection at a depth of 1,000 m, a higher percentage at 3,000 
m) (Sections 1.6.3, 6.3.3, 6.3.4, Table 6.2)
27. In the case of mineral carbonation, the CO2 stored would 
not be released to the atmosphere (Sections 1.6.3, 7.2.7).
28. If continuous leakage of CO2 occurs, it could, at least 
in part, offset the benefits of CCS for mitigating climate 
change. Assessments of the implications of leakage for 
climate change mitigation depend on the framework 
chosen for decision-making and on the information 
available on the fractions retained for geological or 
ocean storage as presented in paragraphs 25 and 26.
Studies conducted to address the question of how to deal with 
non-permanent storage are based on different approaches: 
the value of delaying emissions, cost minimization of a 
specified mitigation scenario or allowable future emissions 
in the context of an assumed stabilization of atmospheric 
greenhouse gas concentrations. Some of these studies allow 
future leakage to be compensated by additional reductions 
in emissions; the results depend on assumptions regarding 
the future cost of reductions, discount rates, the amount of 
CO2 stored and the atmospheric concentration stabilization 
level assumed. In other studies, compensation is not seen as 
an option because of political and institutional uncertainties, 
and the analysis focuses on limitations set by the assumed 
25 “Very likely” is a probability between 90 and 99%.

Summary for Policymakers
stabilization level and the amount stored. While specific 
results of the range of studies vary with the methods and 
assumptions made, all studies imply that, if CCS is to be 
acceptable as a mitigation measure, there must be an upper 
limit to the amount of leakage that can take place (Sections 
1.6.4, 8.4).  
What are the legal and regulatory issues for 
implementing CO2 storage?
29. Some regulations for operations in the subsurface do exist 
that may be relevant or, in some cases, directly applicable 
to geological storage, but few countries have specifically 
developed legal or regulatory frameworks for long-term 
CO2 storage.
Existing laws and regulations regarding inter alia mining, 
oil and gas operations, pollution control, waste disposal, 
drinking water, treatment of high-pressure gases and 
subsurface property rights may be relevant to geological 
CO2 storage. Long-term liability issues associated with the 
leakage of CO2 to the atmosphere and local environmental 
impacts are generally unresolved. Some States take on long-
term responsibility in situations comparable to CO2 storage, 
such as underground mining operations (Sections 5.8.2, 
5.8.3, 5.8.4). 
30. No formal interpretations so far have been agreed upon 
with respect to whether or under what conditions CO2 
injection into the geological sub-seabed or the ocean is 
compatible. 
There are currently several treaties (notably the London26 and 
OSPAR27 Conventions) that potentially apply to the injection 
of CO2 into the geological sub-seabed or the ocean. All of 
these treaties have been drafted without specific consideration 
of CO2 storage (Sections 5.8.1, 6.8.1).
What are the implications of CCS for emission 
inventories and accounting?
31. The current IPCC Guidelines28 do not include methods 
specific to estimating emissions associated with CCS.  
The general guidance provided by the IPCC can be applied 
to CCS. A few countries currently do so, in combination with 
their national methods for estimating emissions. The IPCC 
guidelines themselves do not yet provide specific methods 
for estimating emissions associated with CCS. These are 
expected to be provided in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for 
National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. Specific methods may 
be required for the net capture and storage of CO2, physical 
leakage, fugitive emissions and negative emissions associated 
with biomass applications of CCS systems (Sections 9.2.1, 
9.2.2).
32. The few current CCS projects all involve geological 
storage, and there is therefore limited experience with the 
monitoring, verification and reporting of actual physical 
leakage rates and associated uncertainties.
Several techniques are available or under development for 
monitoring and verification of CO2 emissions from CCS, but 
these vary in applicability, site specificity, detection limits 
and uncertainties (Sections 9.2.3, 5.6, 6.6.2). 
33. CO2 might be captured in one country and stored in 
another with different commitments. Issues associated 
with accounting for cross-border storage are not unique 
to CCS. 
Rules and methods for accounting may have to be adjusted 
accordingly. Possible physical leakage from a storage site in 
the future would have to be accounted for (Section 9.3).
What are the gaps in knowledge?
34. There are gaps in currently available knowledge 
regarding some aspects of CCS. Increasing knowledge 
and experience would reduce uncertainties and thus 
facilitate decision-making with respect to the deployment 
of CCS for climate change mitigation (Section TS.10).

 Technical Summary
1. 
Introduction and framework of this report 
Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS), the subject of this 
Special Report, is considered as one of the options for reducing 
atmospheric emissions of CO2 from human activities. The 
purpose of this Special Report is to assess the current state of 
knowledge regarding the technical, scientific, environmental, 
economic and societal dimensions of CCS and to place CCS 
in the context of other options in the portfolio of potential 
climate change mitigation measures.
 
The structure of this Technical Summary follows that of 
the Special Report. This introductory section presents the 
general framework for the assessment together with a brief 
overview of CCS systems. Section 2 then describes the major 
sources of CO2, a step needed to assess the feasibility of CCS 
on a global scale. Technological options for CO2 capture 
are then discussed in Section 3, while Section 4 focuses 
on methods of CO2 transport. Following this, each of the 
storage options is addressed. Section 5 focuses on geological 
storage, Section 6 on ocean storage, and Section 7 on mineral 
carbonation and industrial uses of CO2. The overall costs and 
economic potential of CCS are then discussed in Section 8, 
followed by an examination in Section 9 of the implications 
of CCS for greenhouse gas emissions inventories and 
accounting. The Technical Summary concludes with a 
discussion of gaps in knowledge, especially those critical for 
policy considerations. 
Overview of CO2 capture and storage 
CO2 is emitted principally from the burning of fossil fuels, 
both in large combustion units such as those used for electric 
power generation and in smaller, distributed sources such 
as automobile engines and furnaces used in residential and 
commercial buildings. CO2 emissions also result from some 
industrial and resource extraction processes, as well as from 
the burning of forests during land clearance. CCS would 
most likely be applied to large point sources of CO2, such 
as power plants or large industrial processes. Some of these 
sources could supply decarbonized fuel such as hydrogen to 
the transportation, industrial and building sectors, and thus 
reduce emissions from those distributed sources.
 
CCS involves the use of technology, first to collect and 
concentrate the CO2 produced in industrial and energy-
related sources, transport it to a suitable storage location, 
and then store it away from the atmosphere for a long period 
of time. CCS would thus allow fossil fuels to be used with 
low emissions of greenhouse gases. Application of CCS to 
biomass energy sources could result in the net removal of 
CO2 from the atmosphere (often referred to as ‘negative 
emissions’) by capturing and storing the atmospheric CO2 
taken up by the biomass, provided the biomass is not 
harvested at an unsustainable rate.
Figure TS.1 illustrates the three main components of the CCS 
process: capture, transport and storage. All three components 
are found in industrial operations today, although mostly not 
for the purpose of CO2 storage. The capture step involves 
separating CO2 from other gaseous products. For fuel-
burning processes such as those in power plants, separation 
technologies can be used to capture CO2 after combustion 
or to decarbonize the fuel before combustion. The transport 
step may be required to carry captured CO2 to a suitable 
storage site located at a distance from the CO2 source. To 
facilitate both transport and storage, the captured CO2 gas is 
typically compressed to a high density at the capture facility. 
Potential storage methods include injection into underground 
geological formations, injection into the deep ocean, or 
industrial fixation in inorganic carbonates. Some industrial 
processes also might utilize and store small amounts of 
captured CO2 in manufactured products.
 
The technical maturity of specific CCS system components 
varies greatly. Some technologies are extensively deployed 
in mature markets, primarily in the oil and gas industry, while 
others are still in the research, development  or demonstration 
phase. Table TS.1 provides an overview of the current status 
of all CCS components. As of mid-2005, there have been 
three commercial projects linking CO2 capture and geological 
storage: the offshore Sleipner natural gas processing project 
in Norway, the Weyburn Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR)1 
project in Canada (which stores CO2 captured in the United 
States) and the In Salah natural gas project in Algeria. Each 
captures and stores 1–2 MtCO2 per year. It should be noted, 
however, that CCS has not yet been applied at a large (e.g., 
500 MW) fossil-fuel power plant, and that the overall system 
may not be as mature as some of its components.

Technical Summary
Why the interest in CO2 capture and storage?
In 1992, international concern about climate change led to the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
(UNFCCC). The ultimate objective of that Convention is 
the “stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the 
atmosphere at a level that prevents dangerous anthropogenic 
interference with the climate system”. From this perspective, 
the context for considering CCS (and other mitigation 
options) is that of a world constrained in CO2 emissions, 
consistent with the international goal of stabilizing 
atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Most scenarios 
for global energy use project a substantial increase of CO2 
emissions throughout this century in the absence of specific 
actions to mitigate climate change. They also suggest that 
the supply of primary energy will continue to be dominated 
by fossil fuels until at least the middle of the century (see 
Section 8). The magnitude of the emissions reduction needed 
to stabilize the atmospheric concentration of CO2 will depend 
on both the level of future emissions (the baseline) and the 
desired target for long-term CO2 concentration: the lower 
the stabilization target and the higher the baseline emissions, 
the larger the required reduction in CO2 emissions. IPCC’s 
Third Assessment Report (TAR) states that, depending on 
the scenario considered, cumulative emissions of hundreds 
or even thousands of gigatonnes of CO2 would need to 
be prevented during this century to stabilize the CO2 
concentration at 450 to 750 ppmv2. The TAR also finds 
that, “most model results indicate that known technological 
options3 could achieve a broad range of atmospheric CO2 
stabilization levels”, but that “no single technology option 
will provide all of the emissions reductions needed”. Rather, 
a combination of mitigation measures will be needed to 
achieve stabilization. These known technological options are 
available for stabilization, although the TAR cautions that, 
“implementation would require associated socio-economic 
and institutional changes”.

3 “Known technological options” refer to technologies that are currently at the operation or pilot-plant stages, as referred to in the mitigation scenarios discussed 
in IPCC’s Third Assessment Report. The term does not include any new technologies that will require drastic technological breakthroughs. It can be considered 
to represent a conservative estimate given the length of the scenario period.
21
 Technical Summary
 
In this context, the availability of CCS in the portfolio of 
options for reducing greenhouse gas emissions could facilitate 
the achievement of stabilization goals. Other technological 
options, which have been examined more extensively in 
previous IPCC assessments, include: (1) reducing energy 
demand by increasing the efficiency of energy conversion 
and/or utilization devices; (2) decarbonizing energy supplies 
(either by switching to less carbon-intensive fuels (coal to 
natural gas, for example), and/or by increasing the use of 
renewable energy sources and/or nuclear energy (each of 
which, on balance, emit little or no CO2); (3) sequestering 
CO2 through the enhancement of natural sinks by biological 
fixation; and (4) reducing non-CO2 greenhouse gases. 
Model results presented later in this report suggest that use of 
CCS in conjunction with other measures could significantly 
reduce the cost of achieving stabilization and would increase 
flexibility in achieving these reductions . The heavy worldwide 
reliance on fossil fuels today (approximately 80% of global 
energy use), the potential for CCS to reduce CO2 emissions 
over the next century, and the compatibility of CCS systems 
with current energy infrastructures explain the interest in this 
technology.

Technical Summary
Major issues for this assessment
There are a number of issues that need to be addressed in 
trying to understand the role that CCS could play in mitigating 
climate change. Questions that arise, and that are addressed 
in different sections of this Technical Summary, include the 
following: 
• 
What is the current status of CCS technology?
• 
What is the potential for capturing and storing CO2?
• 
What are the costs of implementation?
• 
 How long should CO2 be stored in order to achieve 
significant climate change mitigation?
• 
 What are the health, safety and environment risks of 
CCS?
• 
What can be said about the public perception of CCS?
• 
 What are the legal issues for implementing CO2 storage?
• 
 What are the implications for emission inventories and 
accounting?
• 
 What is the potential for the diffusion and transfer of CCS 
technology?
 
When analyzing CCS as an option for climate change 
mitigation, it is of central importance that all resulting 
emissions from the system, especially emissions of CO2, be 
identified and assessed in a transparent way. The importance 
of taking a “systems” view of CCS is therefore stressed, as 
the selection of an appropriate system boundary is essential 
for proper analysis. Given the energy requirements associated 
with capture and some storage and utilization options, and the 
possibility of leaking storage reservoirs, it is vital to assess 
the CCS chain as a whole. 
 
From the perspectives of both atmospheric stabilization 
and long-term sustainable development, CO2 storage must 
extend over time scales that are long enough to contribute 
significantly to climate change mitigation. This report 
expresses the duration of CO2 storage in terms of the‘fraction 
retained’, defined as the fraction of the cumulative mass 
of CO2 injected that is retained in a storage reservoir over 
a specified period of time. Estimates of such fractions for 
different time periods and storage options are presented later. 
Questions arise not only about how long CO2 will remain 
stored, but also what constitutes acceptable amounts of slow, 
continuous leakage4 from storage. Different approaches to 
this question are discussed in Section 8.
 
CCS would be an option for countries that have significant 
sources of CO2 suitable for capture, that have access to storage 
sites and experience with oil or gas operations, and that need to 
satisfy their development aspirations in a carbon-constrained 
environment. Literature assessed in the IPCC Special Report 
‘Methodological and Technological Issues and Technology 
Transfer’ indicates that there are many potential barriers 
that could inhibit deployment in developing countries, even 
of technologies that are mature in industrialized countries. 
Addressing these barriers and creating conditions that would 
facilitate diffusion of the technology to developing countries 
would be a major issue for the adoption of CCS worldwide.
2. 
Sources of CO2
This section describes the major current anthropogenic 
sources of CO2 emissions and their relation to potential 
storage sites. As noted earlier, CO2 emissions from human 
activity arise from a number of different sources, mainly 
from the combustion of fossil fuels used in power generation, 
transportation, industrial processes, and residential and 
commercial buildings. CO2 is also emitted during certain 
industrial processes like cement manufacture or hydrogen 
production and during the combustion of biomass. Future 
emissions are also discussed in this section.
Current CO2 sources and characteristics
To assess the potential of CCS as an option for reducing global 
CO2 emissions, the current global geographical relationship 
between large stationary CO2 emission sources and their 
proximity to potential storage sites has been examined. CO2 
emissions in the residential, commerical and transportation 
sectors have not been considered in this analysis because 
these emission sources are individually small and often 
mobile, and therefore unsuitable for capture and storage. The 
discussion here also includes an analysis of potential future 
sources of CO2 based on several scenarios of future global 
energy use and emissions over the next century.
 
Globally, emissions of CO2 from fossil-fuel use in the year 
2000 totalled about 23.5 GtCO2 yr-1 (6 GtC yr-1). Of this, close 
to 60% was attributed to large (>0.1 MtCO2 yr-1) stationary 
emission sources (see Table TS.2). However, not all of these 
sources are amenable to CO2 capture. Although the sources 
evaluated are distributed throughout the world, the database 
reveals four particular clusters of emissions: North America 
(midwest and eastern USA), Europe (northwest region), 
East Asia (eastern coast of China) and South Asia (Indian 
subcontinent). By contrast, large-scale biomass sources are 
much smaller in number and less globally distributed.
 
Currently, the vast majority of large emission sources 
have  CO2  concentrations of less than 15% (in some cases, 
substantially less). However, a small portion (less than 
2%) of the fossil fuel-based industrial sources have CO2 
concentrations in excess of 95%. The high-concentration 
sources are potential candidates for the early implementation 
4 With respect to CO2 storage, leakage is defined as the escape of injected fluid from storage. This is the most common meaning used in this Summary. If used 
in the context of trading of carbon dioxide emission reductions, it may signify the change in anthropogenic emissions by sources or removals by sinks which 
occurs outside the project boundary.

 Technical Summary
of CCS because only dehydration and compression would 
be required at the capture stage (see Section 3). An analysis 
of these high-purity sources that are within 50 km of storage 
formations and that have the potential to generate revenues 
(via the use of CO2 for enhanced hydrocarbon production 
through ECBM or EOR) indicates that such sources 
currently emit approximately 360 MtCO2 per year. Some 
biomass sources like bioethanol production also generate 
high-concentration CO2 sources which could also be used in 
similar applications.
 
The distance between an emission location and a storage 
site can have a significant bearing on whether or not CCS 
can play a significant role in reducing CO2 emissions. Figure 
TS.2a depicts the major CO2 emission sources (indicated 
by dots), and Figure TS.2b shows the sedimentary basins 
with geological storage prospectivity (shown in different 
shades of grey). In broad terms, these figures indicate that 
there is potentially good correlation between major sources 
and prospective sedimentary basins, with many sources 
lying either directly above, or within reasonable distances 
(less than 300 km) from areas with potential for geological 
storage. The basins shown in Figure TS.2b have not been 
identified or evaluated as suitable storage reservoirs; more 
detailed geological analysis on a regional level is required to 
confirm the suitability of these potential storage sites.

Technical Summary
Future emission sources
In the IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES), 
the future emissions of CO2 are projected on the basis of six 
illustrative scenarios in which global CO2 emissions range 
from 29 to 44 GtCO2 (8–12 GtC) per year in 2020, and from 
23 to 84 GtCO2 (6–23 GtC) per year in 2050. It is projected 
that the number of CO2 emission sources from the electric 
power and industrial sectors will increase significantly 
until 2050, mainly in South and East Asia. By contrast, the 
number of such sources in Europe may decrease slightly. The 
proportion of sources with high and low CO2 content will 
be a function of the size and rate of introduction of plants 
employing gasification or liquefaction of fossil fuels to 
produce hydrogen, or other liquid and gaseous products. The 
greater the number of these plants, the greater the number of 
sources with high CO2 concentrations technically suitable for 
capture. 
 
The projected potential of CO2 capture associated with the 
above emission ranges has been estimated at an annual 2.6 to 
4.9 GtCO2 by 2020 (0.7–1.3 GtC) and 4.7 to 37.5 GtCO2 by 
2050 (1.3–10 GtC). These numbers correspond to 9–12%, 
and 21–45% of global CO2 emissions in 2020 and 2050, 
respectively. The emission and capture ranges reflect the 
inherent uncertainties of scenario and modelling analyses, and 
the technical limitations of applying CCS. These scenarios 
only take into account CO2 capture from fossil fuels, and 
not from biomass sources. However, emissions from large-
scale biomass conversion facilities could also be technically 
suitable for capture.
 
The potential development of low-carbon energy carriers 
is relevant to the future number and size of large, stationary 
CO2 sources with high concentrations. Scenarios also suggest 
that large-scale production of low-carbon energy carriers 
such as electricity or hydrogen could, within several decades, 
begin displacing the fossil fuels currently used by small, 
distributed sources in residential and commercial buildings 
and in the transportation sector (see Section 8). These energy 
carriers could be produced from fossil fuels and/or biomass 
in large plants that would generate large point sources of CO2 
(power plants or plants similar to current plants producing 
hydrogen from natural gas). These sources would be suitable 
for CO2 capture. Such applications of CCS could reduce 
dispersed CO2 emissions from transport and from distributed 
energy supply systems. At present, however, it is difficult to 
project the likely number, size, or geographical distribution 
of the sources associated with such developments.
3. 
Capture of CO2
This section examines CCS capture technology. As shown 
in Section 2, power plants and other large-scale industrial 
processes are the primary candidates for capture and the 
main focus of this section.

is present in a given area based on the available information. This figure should be taken as a guide only, because it is based on partial data, 
the quality of which may vary from region to region, and which may change over time and with new information (Courtesy of Geoscience 
Australia).

 Technical Summary
Capture technology options and applications
The purpose of CO2 capture is to produce a concentrated 
stream of CO2 at high pressure that can readily be transported 
to a storage site. Although, in principle, the entire gas stream 
containing low concentrations of CO2 could be transported 
and injected underground, energy costs and other associated 
costs generally make this approach impractical. It is 
therefore necessary to produce a nearly pure CO2 stream for 
transport and storage. Applications separating CO2 in large 
industrial plants, including natural gas treatment plants and 
ammonia production facilities, are already in operation today. 
Currently, CO2 is typically removed to purify other industrial 
gas streams. Removal has been used for storage purposes in 
only a few cases; in most cases, the CO2 is emitted to the 
atmosphere. Capture processes also have been used to obtain 
commercially useful amounts of CO2 from flue gas streams 
generated by the combustion of coal or natural gas. To date, 
however, there have been no applications of CO2 capture at 
large (e.g., 500 MW) power plants. 
 
Depending on the process or power plant application in 
question, there are three main approaches to capturing the 
CO2 generated from a primary fossil fuel (coal, natural gas or 
oil), biomass, or mixtures of these fuels:
 
Post-combustion systems separate CO2 from the flue 
gases produced by the combustion of the primary fuel in air. 
These systems normally use a liquid solvent to capture the 
small fraction of CO2 (typically 3–15% by volume) present 
in a flue gas stream in which the main constituent is nitrogen 
(from air). For a modern pulverized coal (PC) power plant or 
a natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) power plant, current 
post-combustion capture systems would typically employ an 
organic solvent such as monoethanolamine (MEA). 
 
Pre-combustion systems process the primary fuel in a 
reactor with steam and air or oxygen to produce a mixture 
consisting mainly of carbon monoxide and hydrogen 
(“synthesis gas”). Additional hydrogen, together with CO2, 
is produced by reacting the carbon monoxide with steam in 
a second reactor (a “shift reactor”). The resulting mixture 
of hydrogen and CO2 can then be separated into a CO2 
gas stream, and a stream of hydrogen. If the CO2 is stored, 
the hydrogen is a carbon-free energy carrier that can be 
combusted to generate power and/or heat. Although the initial 
fuel conversion steps are more elaborate and costly than in 
post-combustion systems, the high concentrations of CO2 
produced by the shift reactor (typically 15 to 60% by volume 
on a dry basis) and the high pressures often encountered in 
these applications are more favourable for CO2 separation. 
Pre-combustion would be used at power plants that employ 
integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) technology.
 
Oxyfuel combustion systems use oxygen instead of air for 
combustion of the primary fuel to produce a flue gas that is 
mainly water vapour and CO2. This results in a flue gas with 
high CO2 concentrations (greater than 80% by volume). The 
water vapour is then removed by cooling and compressing 
the gas stream. Oxyfuel combustion requires the upstream 
separation of oxygen from air, with a purity of 95–99% 
oxygen assumed in most current designs. Further treatment of 
the flue gas may be needed to remove air pollutants and non-
condensed gases (such as nitrogen) from the flue gas before 
the CO2 is sent to storage. As a method of CO2 capture in 
boilers, oxyfuel combustion systems are in the demonstration 
phase (see Table TS.1). Oxyfuel systems are also being 
studied in gas turbine systems, but conceptual designs for 
such applications are still in the research phase.
 
Figure TS.3 shows a schematic diagram of the main 
capture processes and systems. All require a step involving 
the separation of CO2, H2 or O2 from a bulk gas stream 
(such as flue gas, synthesis gas, air or raw natural gas). 
These separation steps can be accomplished by means of 
physical or chemical solvents, membranes, solid sorbents, 
or by cryogenic separation. The choice of a specific capture 
technology is determined largely by the process conditions 
under which it must operate. Current post-combustion and 
pre-combustion systems for power plants could capture 
85–95% of the CO2 that is produced. Higher capture 
efficiencies are possible, although separation devices become 
considerably larger, more energy intensive and more costly. 
Capture and compression need roughly 10–40% more energy 
than the equivalent plant without capture, depending on the 
type of system. Due to the associated CO2 emissions, the net 
amount of CO2 captured is approximately 80–90%. Oxyfuel 
combustion systems are, in principle, able to capture nearly 
all of the CO2 produced. However, the need for additional gas 
treatment systems to remove pollutants such as sulphur and 
nitrogen oxides lowers the level of CO2 captured to slightly 
more than 90%.
 
As noted in Section 1, CO2 capture is already used in 
several industrial applications (see Figure TS.4). The same 
technologies as would be used for pre-combustion capture are 
employed for the large-scale production of hydrogen (which is 
used mainly for ammonia and fertilizer manufacture, and for 
petroleum refinery operations). The separation of CO2 from 
raw natural gas (which typically contains significant amounts 
of CO2) is also practised on a large scale, using technologies 
similar to those used for post-combustion capture. Although 
commercial systems are also available for large-scale oxygen 
separation, oxyfuel combustion for CO2 capture is currently 
in the demonstration phase. In addition, research is being 
conducted to achieve higher levels of system integration, 
increased efficiency and reduced cost for all types of capture 
systems.

 Technical Summary
 CO2 capture: risks, energy and the environment 
The monitoring, risk and legal implications of CO2 capture 
systems do not appear to present fundamentally new 
challenges, as they are all elements of regular health, safety 
and environmental control practices in industry. However, 
CO2 capture systems require significant amounts of energy 
for their operation. This reduces net plant efficiency, so power 
plants require more fuel to generate each kilowatt-hour of 
electricity produced. Based on a review of the literature, the 
increase in fuel consumption per kWh for plants capturing 
90% CO2 using best current technology ranges from 24–40% 
for new supercritical PC plants, 11–22% for NGCC plants, 
and 14–25% for coal-based IGCC systems compared to 
similar plants without CCS. The increased fuel requirement 
results in an increase in most other environmental emissions 
per kWh generated relative to new state-of-the-art plants 
without CO2 capture and, in the case of coal, proportionally 
larger amounts of solid wastes. In addition, there is an 
increase in the consumption of chemicals such as ammonia 
and limestone used by PC plants for nitrogen oxide and 
sulphur dioxide emissions control. Advanced plant designs 
that further reduce CCS energy requirements will also reduce 
overall environmental impacts as well as cost. Compared to 
many older existing plants, more efficient new or rebuilt 
plants with CCS may actually yield net reductions in plant-
level environmental emissions. 
Costs of CO2 capture
The estimated costs of CO2 capture at large power plants 
are based on engineering design studies of technologies in 
commercial use today (though often in different applications 
and/or at smaller scales than those assumed in the literature), 
as well as on design studies for concepts currently in 
the research and development (R&D) stage. Table TS.3 
summarizes the results for new supercritical PC, NGCC and 
IGCC plants based on current technology with and without 
CO2 capture. Capture systems for all three designs reduce 
CO2 emissions per kWh by approximately 80–90%, taking 
into account the energy requirements for capture. All data 
for PC and IGCC plants in Table TS.3 are for bituminous 
coals only. The capture costs include the cost of compressing 
CO2  (typically to about 11–14 MPa) but do not include the 
additional costs of CO2 transport and storage (see Sections 
4–7). 
 
The cost ranges for each of the three systems reflect 
differences in the technical, economic and operating 
assumptions employed in different studies. While some 
differences in reported costs can be attributed to differences 
in the design of CO2 capture systems, the major sources of 
variability are differences in the assumed design, operation 
and financing of the reference plant to which the capture 
technology is applied (factors such as plant size, location, 
efficiency, fuel type, fuel cost, capacity factor and cost of 
capital). No single set of assumptions applies to all situations 
or all parts of the world, so a range of costs is given.
 
For the studies listed in Table TS.3, CO2 capture increases 
the cost of electricity production5 by 35–70% (0.01 to 0.02 
US$/kWh) for an NGCC plant, 40–85% (0.02 to 0.03 US$/
kWh) for a supercritical PC plant, and 20–55% (0.01 to 
0.02 US$/kWh) for an IGCC plant. Overall, the electricity 
production costs for fossil fuel plants with capture (excluding 
CO2 transport and storage costs) ranges from 0.04–0.09 US$/
kWh, as compared to 0.03–0.06 US$/kWh for similar plants 
without capture. In most studies to date, NGCC systems have 
typically been found to have lower electricity production 
costs than new PC and IGCC plants (with or without capture) 
in the case of large base-load plants with high capacity factors 
(75% or more) and natural gas prices between 2.6 and 4.4 
US$ GJ-1 over the life of the plant. However, in the case of 
higher gas prices and/or lower capacity factors, NGCC plants 
often have higher electricity production costs than coal-based 
plants, with or without capture. Recent studies also found that 
IGCC plants were on average slightly more costly without 
capture and slightly less costly with capture than similarly-
sized PC plants. However, the difference in cost between 
PC and IGCC plants with or without CO2 capture can vary 
significantly according to coal type and other local factors, 
such as the cost of capital for each plant type. Since full-scale 
NGCC, PC and IGCC systems have not yet been built with 
CCS, the absolute or relative costs of these systems cannot be 
stated with a high degree of confidence at this time.
 
The costs of retrofitting existing power plants with CO2 
capture have not been extensively studied. A limited number 
of reports indicate that retrofitting an amine scrubber to an 
existing plant results in greater efficiency loss and higher 
costs than those shown in Table TS.3. Limited studies also 
indicate that a more cost-effective option is to combine 
a capture system retrofit with rebuilding the boiler and 
turbine to increase plant efficiency and output. For some 
existing plants, studies indicate that similar benefits could be 
achieved by repowering with an IGCC system that includes 
CO2 capture technology. The feasibility and cost of all these 
options is highly dependent on site-specific factors, including 
the size, age and efficiency of the plant, and the availability 
of additional space.
5 The cost of electricity production should not be confused with the price of electricity to customers.  
28
Technical Summary
 
Table TS.4 illustrates the cost of CO2 capture in the 
production of hydrogen. Here, the cost of CO2 capture 
is mainly due to the cost of CO2 drying and compression, 
since CO2 separation is already carried out as part of the 
hydrogen production process. The cost of CO2 capture 
adds approximately 5% to 30% to the cost of the hydrogen 
produced. 
 
CCS also can be applied to systems that use biomass 
fuels or feedstock, either alone or in combination with fossil 
fuels. A limited number of studies have looked at the costs of 
such systems combining capture, transport and storage. The 
capturing of 0.19 MtCO2 yr-1 in a 24 MWe biomass IGCC 
plant is estimated to be about 80 US$/tCO2 net captured (300 
US$/tC), which corresponds to an increase in electricity 
production costs of about 0.08 US$/kWh. There are relatively 
few studies of CO2 capture for other industrial processes 
using fossil fuels and they are typically limited to capture 
costs reported only as a cost per tonne of CO2 captured or 
avoided. In general, the CO2 produced in different processes 
varies widely in pressure and concentration (see Section 2). 
As a result, the cost of capture in different processes (cement 
and steel plants, refineries), ranges widely from about 25–115 
US$/tCO2 net captured. The unit cost of capture is generally 
lower for processes where a relatively pure CO2 stream is 
produced (e.g. natural gas processing, hydrogen production 
and ammonia production), as seen for the hydrogen plants 
Table TS.3.  Summary of CO2 capture costs for new power plants based on current technology. Because these costs do not include the costs (or 
credits) for CO2 transport and storage, this table should not be used to assess or compare total plant costs for different systems with capture. The full costs of 
CCS plants are reported in Section 8.

 Technical Summary
in Table TS.4, where costs vary from 2–56 US$/tCO2 net 
captured. 
 
New or improved methods of CO2 capture, combined 
with advanced power systems and industrial process designs, 
could reduce CO2 capture costs and energy requirements. 
While costs for first-of-a-kind commercial plants often 
exceed initial cost estimates, the cost of subsequent plants 
typically declines as a result of learning-by-doing and other 
factors. Although there is considerable uncertainty about 
the magnitude and timing of future cost reductions, the 
literature suggests that, provided R&D efforts are sustained, 
improvements to commercial technologies can reduce current 
CO2 capture costs by at least 20–30% over approximately the 
next ten years, while new technologies under development 
could achieve more substantial cost reductions. Future cost 
reductions will depend on the deployment and adoption 
of commercial technologies in the marketplace as well as 
sustained R&D.
4. 
Transport of CO2
Except when plants are located directly above a geological 
storage site, captured CO2 must be transported from the point 
of capture to a storage site. This section reviews the principal 
methods of CO2 transport and assesses the health, safety and 
environment aspects, and costs.
Methods of CO2 transport
Pipelines today operate as a mature market technology and are 
the most common method for transporting CO2. Gaseous CO2 
is typically compressed to a pressure above 8 MPa in order 
to avoid two-phase flow regimes and increase the density of 
the CO2, thereby making it easier and less costly to transport. 
CO2 also can be transported as a liquid in ships, road or rail 
tankers that carry CO2 in insulated tanks at a temperature 
well below ambient, and at much lower pressures. 
 
The first long-distance CO2 pipeline came into operation 
in the early 1970s. In the United States, over 2,500 km of 
pipeline transports more than 40 MtCO2 per year from natural 
and anthropogenic sources, mainly to sites in Texas, where 
the CO2 is used for EOR.These pipelines operate in the ‘dense 
phase’ mode (in which there is a continuous progression from 
gas to liquid, without a distinct phase change), and at ambient 
temperature and high pressure. In most of these pipelines, the 
flow is driven by compressors at the upstream end, although 
some pipelines have intermediate (booster) compressor 
stations.

in dataset produce electricity in addition to hydrogen. Fixed charge factors vary from 13-20%. All costs include CO2 compression but not additional CO2 
transport and storage costs (see Section 8 for full CCS costs). 
30
Technical Summary
 
In some situations or locations, transport of CO2 by ship 
may be economically more attractive, particularly when 
the CO2 has to be moved over large distances or overseas. 
Liquefied petroleum gases (LPG, principally propane and 
butane) are transported on a large commercial scale by 
marine tankers. CO2 can be transported by ship in much the 
same way (typically at 0.7 MPa pressure), but this currently 
takes place on a small scale because of limited demand. The 
properties of liquefied CO2 are similar to those of LPG, and 
the technology could be scaled up to large CO2 carriers if a 
demand for such systems were to materialize.
 
Road and rail tankers also are technically feasible options. 
These systems transport CO2 at a temperature of -20ºC and at 
2 MPa pressure. However, they are uneconomical compared 
to pipelines and ships, except on a very small scale, and are 
unlikely to be relevant to large-scale CCS.
Environment, safety and risk aspects
Just as there are standards for natural gas admitted to 
pipelines, so minimum standards for ‘pipeline quality’ CO2 
should emerge as the CO2 pipeline infrastructure develops 
further. Current standards, developed largely in the context 
of EOR applications, are not necessarily identical to what 
would be required for CCS. A low-nitrogen content is 
important for EOR, but would not be so significant for CCS. 
However, a CO2 pipeline through populated areas might need 
a lower specified maximum H2S content. Pipeline transport 
of CO2 through populated areas also requires detailed route 
selection, over-pressure protection, leak detection and other 
design factors. However, no major obstacles to pipeline 
design for CCS are foreseen.
 
CO2 could leak to the atmosphere during transport, 
although leakage losses from pipelines are very small. Dry 
(moisture-free) CO2 is not corrosive to the carbon-manganese 
steels customarily used for pipelines, even if the CO2 contains 
contaminants such as oxygen, hydrogen sulphide, and sulphur 
or nitrogen oxides. Moisture-laden CO2, on the other hand, is 
highly corrosive, so a CO2 pipeline in this case would have 
to be made from a corrosion-resistant alloy, or be internally 
clad with an alloy or a continuous polymer coating. Some 
pipelines are made from corrosion-resistant alloys, although 
the cost of materials is several times larger than carbon-
manganese steels. For ships, the total loss to the atmosphere 
is between 3 and 4% per 1000 km, counting both boil-off and 
the exhaust from ship engines. Boil-off could be reduced by 
capture and liquefaction, and recapture would reduce the loss 
to 1 to 2% per 1000 km.
 
Accidents can also occur. In the case of existing CO2 
pipelines, which are mostly in areas of low population 
density, there have been fewer than one reported incident per 
year (0.0003 per km-year) and no injuries or fatalities. This 
is consistent with experience with hydrocarbon pipelines, 
and the impact would probably not be more severe than for 
natural gas accidents. In marine transportation, hydrocarbon 
gas tankers are potentially dangerous, but the recognized 
hazard has led to standards for design, construction and 
operation, and serious incidents are rare.
Cost of CO2 transport
Costs have been estimated for both pipeline and marine 
transportation of CO2. In every case the costs depend strongly 
on the distance and the quantity transported. In the case of 
pipelines, the costs depend on whether the pipeline is onshore 
or offshore, whether the area is heavily congested, and 
whether there are mountains, large rivers, or frozen ground 
on the route. All these factors could double the cost per unit 
length, with even larger increases for pipelines in populated 
areas. Any additional costs for recompression (booster pump 
stations) that may be needed for longer pipelines would be 
counted as part of transport costs. Such costs are relatively 
small and not included in the estimates presented here.
 
Figure TS.5 shows the cost of pipeline transport for a 
nominal distance of 250 km. This is typically 1–8 US$/tCO2 
(4–30 US$/tC). The figure also shows how pipeline cost 
depends on the CO2 mass flow rate. Steel cost accounts for a 
significant fraction of the cost of a pipeline, so fluctuations 
in such cost (such as the doubling in the years from 2003 to 
2005) could affect overall pipeline economics. 
 
 
In ship transport, the tanker volume and the characteristics 
of the loading and unloading systems are some of the key 
factors determining the overall transport cost.

 Technical Summary
The costs associated with CO2 compression and liquefaction 
are accounted for in the capture costs presented earlier. Figure 
TS.6 compares pipeline and marine transportation costs, 
and shows the break-even distance. If the marine option is 
available, it is typically cheaper than pipelines for distances 
greater than approximately 1000 km and for amounts smaller 
than a few million tonnes of CO2 per year. In ocean storage 
the most suitable transport system depends on the injection 
method: from a stationary floating vessel, a moving ship, or 
a pipeline from shore.
5. 
Geological storage 
This section examines three types of geological formations 
that have received extensive consideration for the geological 
storage of CO2: oil and gas reservoirs, deep saline formations 
and unminable coal beds (Figure TS.7). In each case, 
geological storage of CO2 is accomplished by injecting it in 
dense form into a rock formation below the earth’s surface. 
Porous rock formations that hold or (as in the case of 
depleted oil and gas reservoirs) have previously held fluids, 
such as natural gas, oil or brines, are potential candidates for 
CO2 storage. Suitable storage formations can occur in both 
onshore and offshore sedimentary basins (natural large-scale 
depressions in the earth’s crust that are filled with sediments). 
Coal beds also may be used for storage of CO2 (see Figure 
TS.7) where it is unlikely that the coal will later be mined and 
provided that permeability is sufficient. The option of storing 
CO2 in coal beds and enhancing methane production is still 
in the demonstration phase (see Table TS.1).
Existing CO2 storage projects
Geological storage of CO2 is ongoing in three industrial-
scale projects (projects in the order of 1 MtCO2 yr-1 or more): 
the Sleipner project in the North Sea, the Weyburn project 
in Canada and the In Salah project in Algeria. About 3–4 
MtCO2 that would otherwise be released to the atmosphere 
is captured and stored annually in geological formations. 
Additional projects are listed in Table TS.5.
 
In addition to the CCS projects currently in place, 30 
MtCO2 is injected annually for EOR, mostly in Texas, USA, 
where EOR commenced in the early 1970s. Most of this CO2 
is obtained from natural CO2 reservoirs found in western 
regions of the US, with some coming from anthropogenic 
sources such as natural gas processing. Much of the CO2 
injected for EOR is produced with the oil, from which it is 
separated and then reinjected. At the end of the oil recovery, 
the CO2 can be retained for the purpose of climate change 
mitigation, rather than vented to the atmosphere. This is 
planned for the Weyburn project.
Storage technology and mechanisms 
The injection of CO2 in deep geological formations involves 
many of the same technologies that have been developed 
in the oil and gas exploration and production industry. 
Well-drilling technology, injection technology, computer 
simulation of storage reservoir dynamics and monitoring 
methods from existing applications are being developed 
further for design and operation of geological storage. 
Other underground injection practices also provide relevant 
operational experience. In particular, natural gas storage, 
the deep injection of liquid wastes, and acid gas disposal 
(mixtures of CO2 and H2S) have been conducted in Canada 
and the U.S. since 1990, also at the megatonne scale.
 
CO2 storage in hydrocarbon reservoirs or deep saline 
formations is generally expected to take place at depths below 
800 m, where the ambient pressures and temperatures will 
usually result in CO2 being in a liquid or supercritical state. 
Under these conditions, the density of CO2 will range from 
50 to 80% of the density of water. This is close to the density 
of some crude oils, resulting in buoyant forces that tend to 
drive CO2 upwards. Consequently, a well-sealed cap rock over 
the selected storage reservoir is important to ensure that CO2 
remains trapped underground. When injected underground, the 
CO2 compresses and fills the pore space by partially displacing 
the fluids that are already present (the ‘in situ fluids’). In 
oil and gas reservoirs, the displacement of in situ fluids by 
injected CO2 can result in most of the pore volume being 
available for CO2 storage. In saline formations, estimates of 
potential storage volume are lower, ranging from as low as a 
few percent to over 30% of the total rock volume.

Technical Summary
 
Once injected into the storage formation, the fraction 
retained depends on a combination of physical and 
geochemical trapping mechanisms. Physical trapping to 
block upward migration of CO2 is provided by a layer 
of shale and clay rock above the storage formation. This 
impermeable layer is known as the “cap rock”. Additional 
physical trapping can be provided by capillary forces that 
retain CO2 in the pore spaces of the formation. In many cases, 
however, one or more sides of the formation remain open, 
allowing for lateral migration of CO2 beneath the cap rock. 
In these cases, additional mechanisms are important for the 
long-term entrapment of the injected CO2. 
 
The mechanism known as geochemical trapping occurs 
as the CO2 reacts with the in situ fluids and host rock. First, 
CO2 dissolves in the in situ water. Once this occurs (over time 
scales of hundreds of  years to thousands of years), the CO2-
laden water becomes more dense and therefore sinks down 
into the formation (rather than rising toward the surface). 
Next, chemical reactions between the dissolved CO2 and 
rock minerals form ionic species, so that a fraction of the 
injected CO2 will be converted to solid carbonate minerals 
over millions of years. 
 
Yet another type of trapping occurs when CO2 is 
preferentially adsorbed onto coal or organic-rich shales 
replacing gases such as methane. In these cases, CO2 will 
remain trapped as long as pressures and temperatures 
remain stable. These processes would normally take place at 
shallower depths than CO2 storage in hydrocarbon reservoirs 
and saline formations.
Geographical distribution and capacity of storage sites
As shown earlier in Section 2 (Figure TS.2b), regions with 
sedimentary basins that are potentially suitable for CO2 
storage exist around the globe, both onshore and offshore. 
This report focuses on oil and gas reservoirs, deep saline

of hydrocarbons: EOR (2) and ECBM (4). See text for explanation of these methods (Courtesy CO2CRC).

 Technical Summary
formations and unminable coal beds. Other possible 
geological formations or structures (such as basalts, oil or gas 
shales, salt caverns and abandoned mines) represent niche 
opportunities, or have been insufficiently studied at this time 
to assess their potential. 
 
The estimates of the technical potential6 for different 
geological storage options are summarized in Table TS.6. The 
estimates and levels of confidence are based on an assessment 
of the literature, both of regional bottom-up, and global 
top-down estimates. No probabilistic approach to assessing 
capacity estimates exists in the literature, and this would be 
required to quantify levels of uncertainty reliably. Overall 
estimates, particularly of the upper limit of the potential, vary 
widely and involve a high degree of uncertainty, reflecting 
conflicting methodologies in the literature and the fact 
that our knowledge of saline formations is quite limited in 
most parts of the world. For oil and gas reservoirs, better 
estimates are available which are based on the replacement of 
hydrocarbon volumes with CO2 volumes. It should be noted 
that, with the exception of EOR, these reservoirs will not be 
available for CO2 storage until the hydrocarbons are depleted, 
and that pressure changes and geomechanical effects due to 
hydrocarbon production in the reservoir may reduce actual 
capacity.
 
Another way of looking at storage potential, however, is 
to ask whether it is likely to be adequate for the amounts of 
CO2 that would need to be avoided using CCS under different 
greenhouse gas stabilization scenarios and assumptions about 
the deployment of other mitigation options. As discussed 
later in Section 8, the estimated range of economic potential7 
for CCS over the next century is roughly 200 to 2,000 GtCO2. 
The lower limits in Table TS.6 suggest that, worldwide, it 
is virtually certain8 that there is 200 GtCO2 of geological 
storage capacity, and likely9 that there is at least about 2,000 
GtCO2.
Site selection criteria and methods
Site characterization, selection and performance prediction 
are crucial for successful geological storage. Before selecting 
a site, the geological setting must be characterized to 
determine if the overlying cap rock will provide an effective 
seal, if there is a sufficiently voluminous and permeable 
storage formation, and whether any abandoned or active 
wells will compromise the integrity of the seal. 
 
Techniques developed for the exploration of oil and 
gas reservoirs, natural gas storage sites and liquid waste 
disposal sites are suitable for characterizing geological 
storage sites for CO2. Examples include seismic imaging, 
pumping tests for evaluating storage formations and seals, 
and cement integrity logs. Computer programmes that 
model underground CO2 movement are used to support site 
characterization and selection activities. These programmes 
were initially developed for applications such as oil and 
Table TS.5.  Sites where CO2 storage has been done, is currently in progress or is planned, varying from small pilots to large-scale 
commercial applications.

Technical Summary
gas reservoir engineering and groundwater resources 
investigations. Although they include many of the physical, 
chemical and geomechanical processes needed to predict 
both short-term and long-term performance of CO2 storage, 
more experience is needed to establish confidence in their 
effectiveness in predicting long-term performance when 
adapted for CO2 storage. Moreover, the availability of good 
site characterization data is critical for the reliability of 
models.
Risk assessment and environmental impact
The risks due to leakage from storage of CO2 in geological 
reservoirs fall into two broad categories: global risks and 
local risks. Global risks involve the release of CO2 that 
may contribute significantly to climate change if some 
fraction leaks from the storage formation to the atmosphere. 
In addition, if CO2 leaks out of a storage formation, local 
hazards may exist for humans, ecosystems and groundwater. 
These are the local risks.
 
With regard to global risks, based on observations 
and analysis of current CO2 storage sites, natural systems, 
engineering systems and models, the fraction retained in 
appropriately selected and managed reservoirs is very likely10 
to exceed 99% over 100 years, and is likely to exceed 99% 
over 1000 years. Similar fractions retained are likely for even 
longer periods of time, as the risk of leakage is expected to 
decrease over time as other mechanisms provide additional 
trapping. The question of whether these fractions retained 
would be sufficient to make impermanent storage valuable 
for climate change mitigation is discussed in Section 8.
 
With regard to local risks, there are two types of scenarios 
in which leakage may occur. In the first case, injection well 
failures or leakage up abandoned wells could create a sudden 
and rapid release of CO2. This type of release is likely to 
be detected quickly and stopped using techniques that are 
available today for containing well blow-outs. Hazards 
associated with this type of release primarily affect workers in 
the vicinity of the release at the time it occurs, or those called 
in to control the blow-out. A concentration of CO2 greater 
than 7–10% in air would cause immediate dangers to human 
life and health. Containing these kinds of releases may take 
hours to days and the overall amount of CO2 released is likely 
to be very small compared to the total amount injected. These 
types of hazards are managed effectively on a regular basis in 
the oil and gas industry using engineering and administrative 
controls. 
 
In the second scenario, leakage could occur through 
undetected faults, fractures or through leaking wells where 
the release to the surface is more gradual and diffuse. In this 
case, hazards primarily affect drinking-water aquifers and 
ecosystems where CO2 accumulates in the zone between the 
surface and the top of the water table. Groundwater can be 
affected both by CO2 leaking directly into an aquifer and by 
brines that enter the aquifer as a result of being displaced 
by CO2 during the injection process. There may also be 
acidification of soils and displacement of oxygen in soils 
in this scenario. Additionally, if leakage to the atmosphere 
were to occur in low-lying areas with little wind, or in sumps 
and basements overlying these diffuse leaks, humans and 
animals would be harmed if a leak were to go undetected. 
Humans would be less affected by leakage from offshore 
storage locations than from onshore storage locations. 
Leakage routes can be identified by several techniques and 
by characterization of the reservoir. Figure TS.8 shows some 
of the potential leakage paths for a saline formation. When 
the potential leakage routes are known, the monitoring and 
remediation strategy can be adapted to address the potential 
leakage.
 
Careful storage system design and siting, together with 
methods for early detection of leakage (preferably long before 
CO2 reaches the land surface), are effective ways of reducing 
hazards associated with diffuse leakage. The available 
monitoring methods are promising, but more experience is 
needed to establish detection levels and resolution. Once 
leakages are detected, some remediation techniques are 
available to stop or control them. Depending on the type 
of leakage, these techniques could involve standard well 
repair techniques, or the extraction of CO2 by intercepting its 
leak into a shallow groundwater aquifer (see Figure TS.8).

 Technical Summary
Techniques to remove CO2 from soils and groundwater are 
also available, but they are likely to be costly. Experience 
will be needed to demonstrate the effectiveness, and ascertain 
the costs, of these techniques for use in CO2 storage. 
Monitoring and verification
Monitoring is a very important part of the overall risk 
management strategy for geological storage projects. Standard 
procedures or protocols have not been developed yet but they 
are expected to evolve as technology improves, depending on 
local risks and regulations. However, it is expected that some 
parameters such as injection rate and injection well pressure 
will be measured routinely. Repeated seismic surveys have 
been shown to be useful for tracking the underground 
migration of CO2. Newer techniques such as gravity and 
electrical measurements may also be useful. The sampling 
of groundwater and the soil between the surface and water 
table may be useful for directly detecting CO2 leakage. CO2 
sensors with alarms can be located at the injection wells for 
ensuring worker safety and to detect leakage. Surface-based 
techniques may also be used for detecting and quantifying 
surface releases. High-quality baseline data improve the 
reliability and resolution of all measurements and will be 
essential for detecting small rates of leakage.
 
Since all of these monitoring techniques have been 
adapted from other applications, they need to be tested and 
assessed with regard to reliability, resolution and sensitivity 
in the context of geological storage. All of the existing 
industrial-scale projects and pilot projects have programmes 
to develop and test these and other monitoring techniques. 
Methods also may be necessary or desirable to monitor the 
amount of CO2 stored underground in the context of emission 
reporting and monitoring requirements in the UNFCCC (see 
Section 9). Given the long-term nature of CO2 storage, site 
monitoring may be required for very long periods.
Legal issues 
At present, few countries have specifically developed 
legal and regulatory frameworks for onshore CO2 storage. 
Relevant legislation include petroleum-related legislation, 
drinking-water legislation and mining regulations. In 
many cases, there are laws applying to some, if not most, 
of the issues related to CO2 storage. Specifically, long-term 
liability issues, such as global issues associated with the 
Figure TS.8. Potential leakage routes and remediation techniques for CO2 injected into saline formations. The remediation technique would 
depend on the potential leakage routes identified in a reservoir (Courtesy CO2CRC).
36
Technical Summary
leakage of CO2 to the atmosphere, as well as local concerns 
about environmental impact, have not yet been addressed. 
Monitoring and verification regimes and risks of leakage 
may play an important role in determining liability, and vice-
versa. There are also considerations such as the longevity 
of institutions, ongoing monitoring and transferability 
of institutional knowledge. The long-term perspective is 
essential to a legal framework for CCS as storage times 
extend over many generations as does the climate change 
problem. In some countries, notably the US, the property 
rights of all those affected must be considered in legal terms 
as pore space is owned by surface property owners. 
 
According to the general principles of customary 
international law, States can exercise their sovereignty in 
their territories and could therefore engage in activities 
such as the storage of CO2 (both geological and ocean) in 
those areas under their jurisdiction. However, if storage has 
a transboundary impact, States have the responsibility to 
ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do 
not cause damage to the environment of other States or of 
areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. 
 
Currently, there are several treaties (notably the UN 
Convention on the Law of the Sea, and the London11 and 
OSPAR12 Conventions) that could apply to the offshore 
injection of CO2 into marine environments (both into the 
ocean and the geological sub-seabed). All these treaties have 
been drafted without specific consideration of CO2 storage. 
An assessment undertaken by the Jurists and Linguists Group 
to the OSPAR Convention (relating to the northeast Atlantic 
region), for example, found that, depending on the method and 
purpose of injection, CO2 injection into the geological sub-
seabed and the ocean could be compatible with the treaty in 
some cases, such as when the CO2 is transported via a pipeline 
from land. A similar assessment is now being conducted by 
Parties to the London Convention. Furthermore, papers by 
legal commentators have concluded that CO2 captured from 
an oil or natural gas extraction operation and stored offshore 
in a geological formation (like the Sleipner operation) would 
not be considered ‘dumping’ under, and would not therefore 
be prohibited by, the London Convention.
Public perception
Assessing public perception of CCS is challenging because 
of the relatively technical and “remote” nature of this issue 
at the present time. Results of the very few studies conducted 
to date about the public perception of CCS indicate that 
the public is generally not well informed about CCS. If 
information is given alongside information about other 
climate change mitigation options, the handful of studies 
carried out so far indicate that CCS is generally regarded as 
less favourable than other options, such as improvements in 
energy efficiency and the use of non-fossil energy sources. 
Acceptance of CCS, where it occurs, is characterized as 
“reluctant” rather than “enthusiastic”. In some cases, this 
reflects the perception that CCS might be required because 
of a failure to reduce CO2 emissions in other ways. There 
are indications that geological storage could be viewed 
favourably if it is adopted in conjunction with more desirable 
measures.  Although public perception is likely to change in 
the future, the limited research to date indicates that at least 
two conditions may have to be met before CO2 capture and 
storage is considered by the public as a credible technology, 
alongside other better known options: (1) anthropogenic 
global climate change has to be regarded as a relatively 
serious problem; (2) there must be acceptance of the need 
for large reductions in CO2 emissions to reduce the threat of 
global climate change. 
Cost of geological storage
The technologies and equipment used for geological storage 
are widely used in the oil and gas industries so cost estimates 
for this option have a relatively high degree of confidence 
for storage capacity in the lower range of technical potential. 
However, there is a significant range and variability of costs 
due to site-specific factors such as onshore versus offshore, 
reservoir depth and geological characteristics of the storage 
formation (e.g., permeability and formation thickness). 
 
Representative estimates of the cost for storage in saline 
formations and depleted oil and gas fields are typically 
between 0.5–8 US$/tCO2 injected. Monitoring costs of 
0.1–0.3 US$/tCO2 are additional. The lowest storage costs 
are for onshore, shallow, high permeability reservoirs, and/or 
storage sites where wells and infrastructure from existing oil 
and gas fields may be re-used. 
When storage is combined with EOR, ECBM or (potentially) 
Enhanced Gas Recovery (EGR), the economic value of CO2 
can reduce the total cost of CCS. Based on data and oil prices 
prior to 2003, enhanced oil production for onshore EOR with 
CO2 storage could yield net benefits of 10–16 US$/tCO2 (37–
59 US$/tC) (including the costs of geological storage). For 
EGR and ECBM, which are still under development, there is 
no reliable cost information based on actual experience. In all 
cases, however, the economic benefit of enhanced production

 Technical Summary
depends strongly on oil and gas prices. In this regard, the 
literature basis for this report does not take into account the 
rise in world oil and gas prices since 2003 and assumes oil 
prices of 15–20 US$ per barrel. Should higher prices be 
sustained over the life of a CCS project, the economic value 
of CO2 could be higher than that reported here.
6. 
Ocean storage
A potential CO2 storage option is to inject captured CO2 
directly into the deep ocean (at depths greater than 1,000 
m), where most of it would be isolated from the atmosphere 
for centuries. This can be achieved by transporting CO2 via 
pipelines or ships to an ocean storage site, where it is injected 
into the water column of the ocean or at the sea floor. The 
dissolved and dispersed CO2 would subsequently become 
part of the global carbon cycle. Figure TS.9 shows some of 
the main methods that could be employed. Ocean storage has 
not yet been deployed or demonstrated at a pilot scale, and is 
still in the research phase. However, there have been small-
scale field experiments and 25 years of theoretical, laboratory 
and modelling studies of intentional ocean storage of CO2.
Storage mechanisms and technology
Oceans cover over 70% of the earth’s surface and their 
average depth is 3,800 m. Because carbon dioxide is soluble 
in water, there are natural exchanges of CO2 between the 
atmosphere and waters at the ocean surface that occur until 
equilibrium is reached. If the atmospheric concentration of 
CO2 increases, the ocean gradually takes up additional CO2. 
In this way, the oceans have taken up about 500 GtCO2 (140 
GtC) of the total 1,300 GtCO2 (350 GtC) of anthropogenic 
emissions released to the atmosphere over the past 200 years. 
As a result of the increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations 
from human activities relative to pre-industrial levels, the 
oceans are currently taking up CO2 at a rate of about 7 GtCO2 
yr-1 (2 GtC yr-1).
 
Most of this carbon dioxide now resides in the upper 
ocean and thus far has resulted in a decrease in pH of about 
0.1 at the ocean surface because of the acidic nature of CO2 in 
water. To date, however, there has been virtually no change 
in pH in the deep ocean. Models predict that over the next 
several centuries the oceans will eventually take up most of 
the CO2 released to the atmosphere as CO2 is dissolved at 
the ocean surface and subsequently mixed with deep ocean 
waters.

Technical Summary
There is no practical physical limit to the amount of 
anthropogenic CO2 that could be stored in the ocean. 
However, on a millennial time scale, the amount stored 
will depend on oceanic equilibration with the atmosphere. 
Stabilizing atmospheric CO2 concentrations between 350 
ppmv and 1000 ppmv would imply that between 2,000 and 
12,000 GtCO2 would eventually reside in the ocean if there is 
no intentional CO2 injection. This range therefore represents 
the upper limit for the capacity of the ocean to store CO2 
through active injection. The capacity would also be affected 
by environmental factors, such as a maximum allowable pH 
change. 
 
Analysis of ocean observations and models both indicate 
that injected CO2 will be isolated from the atmosphere for 
at least several hundreds of years, and that the fraction 
retained tends to be higher with deeper injection (see Table 
TS.7). Ideas for increasing the fraction retained include 
forming solid CO2 hydrates and/or liquid CO2 lakes on the 
sea floor, and dissolving alkaline minerals such as limestone 
to neutralize the acidic CO2. Dissolving mineral carbonates, 
if practical, could extend the storage time scale to roughly 
10,000 years, while minimizing changes in ocean pH and 
CO2 partial pressure. However, large amounts of limestone 
and energy for materials handling would be required for 
this approach (roughly the same order of magnitude as the 
amounts per tonne of CO2 injected that are needed for mineral 
carbonation; see Section 7). 
Ecological and environmental impacts and risks
The injection of a few GtCO2 would produce a measurable 
change in ocean chemistry in the region of injection, whereas 
the injection of hundreds of GtCO2 would produce larger 
changes in the region of injection and eventually produce 
measurable changes over the entire ocean volume. Model 
simulations that assume a release from seven locations 
at 3,000 m depth and ocean storage providing 10% of the 
mitigation effort for stabilization at 550 ppmv CO2 projected 
acidity changes (pH changes) of more than 0.4 over 
approximately 1% of the ocean volume. By comparison, in 
a 550 ppmv stabilization case without ocean storage, a pH 
change of more than 0.25 at the ocean surface was estimated 
due to equilibration with the elevated CO2 concentrations in 
the atmosphere. In either case, a pH change of 0.2 to 0.4 is 
significantly greater than pre-industrial variations in ocean 
acidity. Over centuries, ocean mixing will result in the 
loss of isolation of injected CO2. As more CO2 reaches the 
ocean surface waters, releases into the atmosphere would 
occur gradually from large regions of the ocean. There are 
no known mechanisms for sudden or catastrophic release of 
injected CO2 from the ocean into the atmosphere.
 
Experiments show that adding CO2 can harm marine 
organisms. Effects of elevated CO2 levels have mostly 
been studied on time scales up to several months in 
individual organisms that live near the ocean surface. 
Observed phenomena include reduced rates of calcification, 
reproduction, growth, circulatory oxygen supply and mobility, 
as well as increased mortality over time. In some organisms 
these effects are seen in response to small additions of CO2. 
Immediate mortality is expected close to injection points or 
CO2 lakes. The chronic effects of direct CO2 injection into 
the ocean on ocean organisms or ecosystems over large ocean 
areas and long time scales have not yet been studied. 
 
No controlled ecosystem experiments have been 
performed in the deep ocean, so only a preliminary 
assessment of potential ecosystem effects can be given. It 
is expected that ecosystem consequences will increase with 
increasing CO2 concentrations and decreasing pH, but the 
nature of such consequences is currently not understood, 
and no environmental criteria have as yet been identified to 
avoid adverse effects. At present, it is also unclear how or 
whether species and ecosystems would adapt to the sustained 
chemical changes. 
Costs of ocean storage
Although there is no experience with ocean storage, some 
attempts have been made to estimate the costs of CO2 storage 
projects that release CO2 on the sea floor or in the deep ocean. 
The costs of CO2 capture and transport to the shoreline (e.g

via pipelines) are not included in the cost of ocean storage. 
However, the costs of offshore pipelines or ships, plus any 
additional energy costs, are included in the ocean storage 
cost. The costs of ocean storage are summarized in Table 
TS.8. These numbers indicate that, for short distances, the 
fixed pipeline option would be cheaper. For larger distances, 
either the moving ship or the transport by ship to a platform 
with subsequent injection would be more attractive. 
Legal aspects and public perception
The global and regional treaties on the law of the sea and 
marine environment, such as the OSPAR and the London 
Convention discussed earlier in Section 5 for geological 
storage sites, also affect ocean storage, as they concern the 
‘maritime area’. Both Conventions distinguish between the 
storage method employed and the purpose of storage to 
determine the legal status of ocean storage of CO2. As yet, 
however, no decision has been made about the legal status of 
intentional ocean storage.
 
The very small number of public perception studies that 
have looked at the ocean storage of CO2 indicate that there 
is very little public awareness or knowledge of this subject. 
In the few studies conducted thus far, however, the public 
has expressed greater reservations about ocean storage 
than geological storage. These studies also indicate that the 
perception of ocean storage changed when more information 
was provided; in one study this led to increased acceptance of 
ocean storage, while in another study it led to less acceptance. 
The literature also notes that ‘significant opposition’ 
developed around a proposed CO2 release experiment in the 
Pacific Ocean. 
7. 
Mineral carbonation and industrial uses
This section deals with two rather different options for CO2 
storage. The first is mineral carbonation, which involves 
converting CO2 to solid inorganic carbonates using chemical 
reactions. The second option is the industrial use of CO2, 
either directly or as feedstock for production of various 
carbon-containing chemicals.
Mineral carbonation: technology, impacts and costs 
Mineral carbonation refers to the fixation of CO2 using 
alkaline and alkaline-earth oxides, such as magnesium 
oxide (MgO) and calcium oxide (CaO), which are present 
in naturally occurring silicate rocks such as serpentine and 
olivine. Chemical reactions between these materials and CO2 
produces compounds such as magnesium carbonate (MgCO3) 
and calcium carbonate (CaCO3, commonly known as 
limestone). The quantity of metal oxides in the silicate rocks 
that can be found in the earth’s crust exceeds the amounts 
needed to fix all the CO2 that would be produced by the 
combustion of all available fossil fuel reserves. These oxides 
are also present in small quantities in some industrial wastes, 
such as stainless steel slags and ashes. Mineral carbonation 
produces silica and carbonates that are stable over long 
time scales and can therefore be disposed of in areas such 
as silicate mines, or re-used for construction purposes (see 
Figure TS.10), although such re-use is likely to be small 
relative to the amounts produced. After carbonation, CO2 
would not be released to the atmosphere. As a consequence, 
there would be little need to monitor the disposal sites and 
the associated risks would be very low. The storage potential 
is difficult to estimate at this early phase of development. 
It would be limited by the fraction of silicate reserves that 
can be technically exploited, by environmental issues such 
as the volume of product disposal, and by legal and societal 
constraints at the storage location. 
 
The process of mineral carbonation occurs naturally, where 
it is known as ‘weathering’. In nature, the process occurs very 
slowly; it must therefore be accelerated considerably to be a 
viable storage method for CO2 captured from anthropogenic 
sources. Research in the field of mineral carbonation therefore 
focuses on finding process routes that can achieve reaction 
rates viable for industrial purposes and make the reaction 
more energy-efficient. Mineral carbonation technology using 
natural silicates is in the research phase but some processes 
using industrial wastes are in the demonstration phase.
 
A commercial process would require mining, crushing 
and milling of the mineral-bearing ores and their transport to 
a processing plant receiving a concentrated CO2 stream from 
a capture plant (see Figure TS.10). The carbonation process

Technical Summary
energy required would be 30 to 50% of the capture plant 
output. Considering the additional energy requirements for 
the capture of CO2, a CCS system with mineral carbonation 
would require 60 to 180% more energy input per kilowatt-
hour than a reference electricity plant without capture 
or mineral carbonation. These energy requirements raise 
the cost per tonne of CO2 avoided for the overall system 
significantly (see Section 8). The best case studied so far is 
the wet carbonation of natural silicate olivine. The estimated 
cost of this process is approximately 50–100 US$/tCO2 net 
mineralized (in addition to CO2 capture and transport costs, 
but taking into account the additional energy requirements). 
The mineral carbonation process would require 1.6 to 3.7 
tonnes of silicates per tonne of CO2 to be mined, and produce 
2.6 to 4.7 tonnes of materials to be disposed per tonne of 
CO2 stored as carbonates. This would therefore be a large 
operation, with an environmental impact similar to that of 
current large-scale surface mining operations. Serpentine 
also often contains chrysotile, a natural form of asbestos. 
Its presence therefore demands monitoring and mitigation 
measures of the kind available in the mining industry. On the 
other hand, the products of mineral carbonation are chrysotile-
free, since this is the most reactive component of the rock and 
therefore the first substance converted to carbonates. 
 
A number of issues still need to be clarified before any 
estimates of the storage potential of mineral carbonation can 
be given. The issues include assessments of the technical 
feasibility and corresponding energy requirements at large 
scales, but also the fraction of silicate reserves that can be 
technically and economically exploited for CO2 storage. The 
environmental impact of mining, waste disposal and product 
storage could also limit potential. The extent to which 
mineral carbonation may be used cannot be determined at 
this time, since it depends on the unknown amount of silicate 
reserves that can be technically exploited, and environmental 
issuessuch as those noted above.
Industrial uses
Industrial uses of CO2 include chemical and biological 
processes where CO2 is a reactant, such as those used in urea 
and methanol production, as well as various technological 
applications that use CO2 directly, for example in the 
horticulture industry, refrigeration, food packaging, welding,

 Technical Summary
beverages and fire extinguishers. Currently, CO2 is used at 
a rate of approximately 120 MtCO2 per year (30 MtC yr-1) 
worldwide, excluding use for EOR (discussed in Section 5). 
Most (two thirds of the total) is used to produce urea, which 
is used in the manufacture of fertilizers and other products. 
Some of the CO2 is extracted from natural wells, and some 
originates from industrial sources – mainly high-concentration 
sources such as ammonia and hydrogen production plants 
– that capture CO2 as part of the production process. 
 
Industrial uses of CO2 can, in principle, contribute 
to keeping CO2 out of the atmosphere by storing it in the 
“carbon chemical pool” (i.e., the stock of carbon-bearing 
manufactured products). However, as a measure for mitigating 
climate change, this option is meaningful only if the quantity 
and duration of CO2 stored are significant, and if there is a 
real net reduction of CO2 emissions. The typical lifetime of 
most of the CO2 currently used by industrial processes has 
storage times of only days to months. The stored carbon is 
then degraded to CO2 and again emitted to the atmosphere. 
Such short time scales do not contribute meaningfully to 
climate change mitigation. In addition, the total industrial use 
figure of 120 MtCO2 yr-1 is small compared to emissions from 
major anthropogenic sources (see Table TS.2). While some 
industrial processes store a small proportion of CO2 (totalling 
roughly 20 MtCO2 yr-1) for up to several decades, the total 
amount of long-term (century-scale) storage is presently in 
the order of 1 MtCO2 yr-1 or less, with no prospects for major 
increases. 
 
Another important question is whether industrial uses of 
CO2 can result in an overall net reduction of CO2 emissions 
by substitution for other industrial processes or products. 
This can be evaluated correctly only by considering proper 
system boundaries for the energy and material balances of 
the CO2 utilization processes, and by carrying out a detailed 
life-cycle analysis of the proposed use of CO2. The literature 
in this area is limited but it shows that precise figures are 
difficult to estimate and that in many cases industrial uses 
could lead to an increase in overall emissions rather than a 
net reduction. In view of the low fraction of CO2 retained, the 
small volumes used and the possibility that substitution may 
lead to increases in CO2 emissions, it can be concluded that 
the contribution of industrial uses of captured CO2 to climate 
change mitigation is expected to be small.
8. 
Costs and economic potential
The stringency of future requirements for the control of 
greenhouse gas emissions and the expected costs of CCS 
systems will determine, to a large extent, the future deployment 
of CCS technologies relative to other greenhouse gas 
mitigation options. This section first summarizes the overall 
cost of CCS for the main options and process applications 
considered in previous sections. As used in this summary 
and the report, “costs” refer only to market prices but do not 
include external costs such as environmental damages and 
broader societal costs that may be associated with the use 
of CCS. To date, little has been done to assess and quantify 
such external costs. Finally CCS is examined in the context 
of alternative options for global greenhouse gas reductions.
Cost of CCS systems
As noted earlier, there is still relatively little experience with 
the combination of CO2 capture, transport and storage in a fully 
integrated CCS system. And while some CCS components 
are already deployed in mature markets for certain industrial 
applications, CCS has still not been used in large-scale power 
plants (the application with most potential). 
 
The literature reports a fairly wide range of costs for CCS 
components (see Sections 3–7). The range is due primarily to 
the variability of site-specific factors, especially the design, 
operating and financing characteristics of the power plants or 
industrial facilities in which CCS is used; the type and costs 
of fuel used; the required distances, terrains and quantities 
involved in CO2 transport; and the type and characteristics of 
the CO2 storage. In addition, uncertainty still remains about the 
performance and cost of current and future CCS technology 
components and integrated systems. The literature reflects 
a widely-held belief, however, that the cost of building and 
operating CO2 capture systems will decline over time as a 
result of learning-by-doing (from technology deployment) 
and sustained R&D. Historical evidence also suggests that 
costs for first-of-a-kind capture plants could exceed current 
estimates before costs subsequently decline. In most CCS 
systems, the cost of capture (including compression) is the 
largest cost component. Costs of electricity and fuel vary 
considerably from country to country, and these factors also 
influence the economic viability of CCS options.
 
Table TS.9 summarizes the costs of CO2 capture, 
transport and storage reported in Sections 3 to 7. Monitoring 
costs are also reflected. In Table TS.10, the component costs 
are combined to show the total costs of CCS and electricity 
generation for three power systems with pipeline transport 
and two geological storage options. 
 
For the plants with geological storage and no EOR 
credit, the cost of CCS ranges from 0.02–0.05 US$/kWh 
for PC plants and 0.01–0.03 US$/kWh for NGCC plants 
(both employing post-combustion capture). For IGCC plants 
(using pre-combustion capture), the CCS cost ranges from 
0.01–0.03 US$/kWh relative to a similar plant without CCS. 
For all electricity systems, the cost of CCS can be reduced 
by about 0.01–0.02 US$/kWh when using EOR with CO2 
storage because the EOR revenues partly compensate for 
the CCS costs. The largest cost reductions are seen for coal-
based plants, which capture the largest amounts of CO2. In a 
few cases, the low end of the CCS cost range can be negative, 
42
Technical Summary
indicating that the assumed credit for EOR over the life of the 
plant is greater than the lowest reported cost of CO2 capture 
for that system. This might also apply in a few instances of 
low-cost capture from industrial processes.
 
In addition to fossil fuel-based energy conversion 
processes, CO2 could also be captured in power plants fueled 
with biomass, or fossil-fuel plants with biomass co-firing. 
At present, biomass plants are small in scale (less than 100 
MWe). This means that the resulting costs of production 
with and without CCS are relatively high compared to fossil 
alternatives. Full CCS costs for biomass could amount to 110 
US$/tCO2 avoided. Applying CCS to biomass-fuelled or co-
fired conversion facilities would lead to lower or negative13 
CO2 emissions, which could reduce the costs for this option, 
depending on the market value of CO2 emission reductions. 
Similarly, CO2 could be captured in biomass-fueled H2 
plants. The cost is reported to be 22–25 US$/tCO2 (80–92 
US$/tC) avoided in a plant producing 1 million Nm3 day-1 of 
H2, and corresponds to an increase in the H2 product costs of 
about 2.7 US$ GJ-1. Significantly larger biomass plants could 
potentially benefit from economies of scale, bringing down 
costs of the CCS systems to levels broadly similar to coal 
plants. However, to date, there has been little experience with 
large-scale biomass plants, so their feasibility has not been 
proven yet, and costs and potential are difficult to estimate.
 
The cost of CCS has not been studied in the same depth 
for non-power applications. Because these sources are very 
diverse in terms of CO2 concentration and gas stream pressure, 
the available cost studies show a very broad range. The lowest 
costs were found for processes that already separate CO2 as 
part of the production process, such as hydrogen production 
(the cost of capture for hydrogen production was reported 
earlier in Table TS.4). The full CCS cost, including transport 
and storage, raises the cost of hydrogen production by 0.4 to 
4.4 US$ GJ-1 in the case of geological storage, and by -2.0 
to 2.8 US$ GJ-1 in the case of EOR, based on the same cost 
assumptions as for Table TS.10.
Cost of CO2 avoided
Table TS.10 also shows the ranges of costs for ‘CO2 avoided’. 
CCS energy requirements push up the amount of fuel input 
(and therefore CO2 emissions) per unit of net power output. 
As a result, the amount of CO2 produced per unit of product 
(a kWh of electricity) is greater for the power plant with 
CCS than the reference plant, as shown in Figure TS.11. 
To determine the CO2 reductions one can attribute to CCS, 
one needs to compare CO2 emissions per kWh of the plant 
with capture to that of a reference plant without capture. The 
difference is referred to as the ‘avoided emissions’. 
Table TS.9.  2002 Cost ranges for the components of a CCS system as applied to a given type of power plant or industrial source. The costs 
of the separate components cannot simply be summed to calculate the costs of the whole CCS system in US$/CO2 avoided. All numbers are 
representative of the costs for large-scale, new installations, with natural gas prices assumed to be 2.8-4.4 US$ GJ-1 and coal prices 1-1.5 US$ 
GJ-1.

 Technical Summary
 
Introducing CCS to power plants may influence the 
decision about which type of plant to install and which fuel to 
use. In some situations therefore, it can be useful to calculate 
a cost per tonne of CO2 avoided based on a reference plant 
different from the CCS plant. Table TS.10 displays the cost 
and emission factors for the three reference plants and the 
corresponding CCS plants for the case of geological storage. 
Table TS.11 summarizes the range of estimated costs for 
different combinations of CCS plants and the lowest-cost 
reference plants of potential interest. It shows, for instance, 
that where a PC plant is planned initially, using CCS in that 
plant may lead to a higher CO2 avoidance cost than if an 
NGCC plant with CCS is selected, provided natural gas is 
available. Another option with lower avoidance cost could 
be to build an IGCC plant with capture instead of equipping 
a PC plant with capture. 
Economic potential of CCS for climate change mitigation
Assessments of the economic potential of CCS are based 
on energy and economic models that study future CCS 
deployment and costs in the context of scenarios that achieve 
economically efficient, least-cost paths to the stabilization of 
atmospheric CO2 concentrations. 
 
While there are significant uncertainties in the quantitative 
results from these models (see discussion below), all models 
indicate that CCS systems are unlikely to be deployed 
on a large scale in the absence of an explicit policy that 
substantially limits greenhouse gas emissions to the 
atmosphere. With greenhouse gas emission limits imposed, 
many integrated assessments foresee the deployment of 
CCS systems on a large scale within a few decades from the 
start of any significant climate change mitigation regime. 
Energy and economic models indicate that CCS systems

Technical Summary
are unlikely to contribute significantly to the mitigation of 
climate change unless deployed in the power sector. For this 
to happen, the price of carbon dioxide reductions would have 
to exceed 25–30 US$/tCO2, or an equivalent limit on CO2 
emissions would have to be mandated. The literature and 
current industrial experience indicate that, in the absence of 
measures for limiting CO2 emissions, there are only small, 
niche opportunities for CCS technologies to deploy. These 
early opportunities involve CO2 captured from a high-purity, 
low-cost source, the transport of CO2 over distances of less 
than 50 km, coupled with CO2 storage in a value-added 
application such as EOR. The potential of such niche options 
is about 360 MtCO2 per year (see Section 2).
 
Models also indicate that CCS systems will be 
competitive with other large-scale mitigation options such 
as nuclear power and renewable energy technologies. These 
studies show that including CCS in a mitigation portfolio 
could reduce the cost of stabilizing CO2 concentrations by 
30% or more. One aspect of the cost competitiveness of CCS 
technologies is that they are compatible with most current 
energy infrastructures. 
 
In most scenarios, emissions abatement becomes 
progressively more constraining over time. Most analyses 
indicate that notwithstanding significant penetration of 
CCS systems by 2050, the majority of CCS deployment 
will occur in the second half of this century.  The earliest 
CCS deployments are typically foreseen in the industrialized 
nations, with deployment eventually spreading worldwide.

 Technical Summary
significantly) in the specific mix and quantities of different 
measures needed to achieve a particular emissions constraint 
(see Figure TS.12), the consensus of the literature shows that 
CCS could be an important component of the broad portfolio 
of energy technologies and emission reduction approaches. 
 
The actual use of CCS is likely to be lower than the 
estimates of economic potential indicated by these energy 
and economic models. As noted earlier, the results are 
typically based on an optimized least-cost analysis that does 
not adequately account for real-world barriers to technology 
development and deployment, such as environmental impact, 
lack of a clear legal or regulatory framework, the perceived 
investment risks of different technologies, and uncertainty 
as to how quickly the cost of CCS will be reduced through 
R&D and learning-by-doing. Models typically employ 
simplified assumptions regarding the costs of CCS for 
different applications and the rates at which future costs will 
be reduced.

Technical Summary
 
For CO2 stabilization scenarios between 450 and 750 
ppmv, published estimates of the cumulative amount of 
CO2 potentially stored globally over the course of this 
century (in geological formations and/or the oceans) span a 
wide range, from very small contributions to thousands of 
gigatonnes of CO2. To a large extent, this wide range is due to 
the uncertainty of long-term socio-economic, demographic 
and, in particular, technological changes, which are the main 
drivers of future CO2 emissions. However, it is important to 
note that the majority of results for stabilization scenarios of 
450–750 ppmv CO2 tend to cluster in a range of 220–2,200 
GtCO2 (60–600 GtC) for the cumulative deployment of CCS. 
For CCS to achieve this economic potential, several hundreds 
or thousands of CCS systems would be required worldwide 
over the next century, each capturing some 1–5 MtCO2 per 
year. As indicated in Section 5, it is likely that the technical 
potential for geological storage alone is sufficient to cover 
the high end of the economic potential range for CCS.
Perspectives on CO2 leakage from storage
The policy implications of slow leakage from storage depend 
on assumptions in the analysis. Studies conducted to address 
the question of how to deal with impermanent storage are based 
on different approaches: the value of delaying emissions, cost 
minimization of a specified mitigation scenario, or allowable 
future emissions in the context of an assumed stabilization 
of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Some of 
these studies allow future releases to be compensated by 
additional reductions in emissions; the results depend on 
assumptions regarding the future cost of reductions, discount 
rates, the amount of CO2 stored, and the assumed level of 
stabilization for atmospheric concentrations. In other studies, 
compensation is not seen as an option because of political 
and institutional uncertainties and the analysis focuses on 
limitations set by the assumed stabilization level and the 
amount stored. 
 
While specific results of the range of studies vary with 
the methods and assumptions made, the outcomes suggest 
that a fraction retained on the order of 90–99% for 100 years 
or 60–95% for 500 years could still make such impermanent 
storage valuable for the mitigation of climate change. All 
studies imply that, if CCS is to be acceptable as a mitigation 
measure, there must be an upper limit to the amount of 
leakage that can take place.
9. 
Emission inventories and accounting
An important aspect of CO2 capture and storage is the 
development and application of methods to estimate and 
report the quantities in which emissions of CO2 (and associated 
emissions of methane or nitrous oxides) are reduced, 
avoided, or removed from the atmosphere. The two elements 
involved here are (1) the actual estimation and reporting of 
emissions for national greenhouse gas inventories, and (2) 
accounting for CCS under international agreements to limit 
net emissions.15
Current framework
Under the UNFCCC, national greenhouse gas emission 
inventories have traditionally reported emissions for a specific 
year, and have been prepared on an annual basis or another 
periodic basis. The IPCC Guidelines (IPCC 1996) and Good 
Practice Guidance Reports (IPCC 2000; 2003) describe 
detailed approaches for preparing national inventories 
that are complete, transparent, documented, assessed for 
uncertainties, consistent over time, and comparable across 
countries. The IPCC documents now in use do not specifically 
include CO2 capture and storage options. However, the IPCC 
Guidelines are currently undergoing revisions that should 
provide some guidance when the revisions are published in 
2006. The framework that already has been accepted could 
be applied to CCS systems, although some issues might need 
revision or expansion.
Issues relevant to accounting and reporting 
In the absence of prevailing international agreements, it is not 
clear whether the various forms of CO2 capture and storage 
will be treated as reductions in emissions or as removals from 
the atmosphere. In either case, CCS results in new pools of 
CO2 that may be subject to physical leakage at some time in 
the future. Currently, there are no methods available within 
the UNFCCC framework for monitoring, measuring or 
accounting for physical leakage from storage sites. However, 
leakage from well-managed geological storage sites is likely 
to be small in magnitude and distant in time. 
 
Consideration may be given to the creation of a specific 
category for CCS in the emissions reporting framework 
but this is not strictly necessary since the quantities of CO2 
captured and stored could be reflected in the sector in which 
the CO2 was produced. CO2 storage in a given location 
could include CO2 from many different source categories, 
and even from sources in many different countries. Fugitive 
15 In this context, ‘‘estimation’’ is the process of calculating greenhouse gas emissions and ‘‘reporting’’ is the process of providing the estimates to the UNFCCC. 
‘‘Accounting’’ refers to the rules for comparing emissions and removals as reported with commitments (IPCC 2003).
47
 Technical Summary
emissions from the capture, transport and injection of CO2 to 
storage can largely be estimated within the existing reporting 
methods, and emissions associated with the added energy 
required to operate the CCS systems can be measured and 
reported within the existing inventory frameworks. Specific 
consideration may also be required for CCS applied to 
biomass systems as that application would result in reporting 
negative emissions, for which there is currently no provision 
in the reporting framework. 
Issues relevant to international agreements 
Quantified commitments to limit greenhouse gas emissions 
and the use of emissions trading, Joint Implementation (JI) 
or the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) require clear 
rules and methods to account for emissions and removals. 
Because CCS has the potential to move CO2 across traditional 
accounting boundaries (e.g. CO2 might be captured in one 
country and stored in another, or captured in one year and 
partly released from storage in a later year), the rules and 
methods for accounting may be different than those used in 
traditional emissions inventories. 
 
To date, most of the scientific, technical and political 
discussions on accounting for stored CO2 have focused on 
sequestration in the terrestrial biosphere. The history of these 
negotiations may provide some guidance for the development 
of accounting methods for CCS. Recognizing the potential 
impermanence of CO2 stored in the terrestrial biosphere, 
the UNFCCC accepted the idea that net emissions can be 
reduced through biological sinks, but has imposed complex 
rules for such accounting. CCS is markedly different in many 
ways from CO2 sequestration in the terrestrial biosphere (see 
Table TS.12), and the different forms of CCS are markedly 
different from one another. However, the main goal of 
accounting is to ensure that CCS activities produce real 
and quantifiable reductions in net emissions. One tonne of 
CO2 permanently stored has the same benefit in terms of 
atmospheric CO2 concentrations as one tonne of CO2 not 
emitted, but one tonne of CO2 temporarily stored has less 
benefit. It is generally accepted that this difference should be 
reflected in any system of accounting for reductions in net 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
 
The IPCC Guidelines (IPCC 1996) and Good Practice 
Guidance Reports (IPCC 2000; 2003) also contain guidelines 
for monitoring greenhouse gas emissions. It is not known 
whether the revised guidelines of the IPCC for CCS can 
be satisfied by using monitoring techniques, particularly 
for geological and ocean storage. Several techniques are 
available for the monitoring and verification of CO2 emissions 
from geological storage, but they vary in applicability, 
detection limits and uncertainties. Currently, monitoring for 
geological storage can take place quantitatively at injection 
and qualitatively in the reservoir and by measuring surface 
fluxes of CO2. Ocean storage monitoring can take place by 
Table TS.12.  Differences in the forms of CCS and biological sinks that might influence the way accounting is conducted.

Technical Summary
detecting the CO2 plume, but not by measuring ocean surface 
release to the atmosphere. Experiences from monitoring 
existing CCS projects are still too limited to serve as a 
basis for conclusions about the physical leakage rates and 
associated uncertainties. 
 
The Kyoto Protocol creates different units of accounting 
for greenhouse gas emissions, emissions reductions, 
and emissions sequestered under different compliance 
mechanisms. ‘Assigned amount units’ (AAUs) describe 
emissions commitments and apply to emissions trading, 
‘certified emission reductions’ (CERs) are used under the 
CDM, and ‘emission reduction units’ (ERUs) are employed 
under JI. To date, international negotiations have provided 
little guidance about methods for calculating and accounting 
for project-related CO2 reductions from CCS systems (only 
CERs or ERUs), and it is therefore uncertain how such 
reductions will be accommodated under the Kyoto Protocol. 
Some guidance may be given by the methodologies for 
biological-sink rules. Moreover, current agreements do not 
deal with cross-border CCS projects. This is particularly 
important when dealing with cross-border projects involving 
CO2 capture in an ‘Annex B’ country that is party to the 
Kyoto Protocol but stored in a country that is not in Annex B 
or is not bound by the Protocol.
 
Although methods currently available for national 
emissions inventories can either accommodate CCS systems 
or be revised to do so, accounting for stored CO2 raises 
questions about the acceptance and transfer of responsibility 
for stored emissions. Such issues may be addressed through 
national and international political processes. 
10. Gaps in knowledge
This summary of the gaps in knowledge covers aspects of 
CCS where increasing knowledge, experience and reducing 
uncertainty would be important to facilitate decision-making 
about the large-scale deployment of CCS. 
Technologies for capture and storage
Technologies for the capture of CO2 are relatively well 
understood today based on industrial experience in a variety 
of applications. Similarly, there are no major technical or 
knowledge barriers to the adoption of pipeline transport, 
or to the adoption of geological storage of captured CO2. 
However, the integration of capture, transport and storage 
in full-scale projects is needed to gain the knowledge and 
experience required for a more widespread deployment 
of CCS technologies. R&D is also needed to improve 
knowledge of emerging concepts and enabling technologies 
for CO2 capture that have the potential to significantly reduce 
the costs of capture for new and existing facilities. More 
specifically, there are knowledge gaps relating to large coal-
based and natural gas-based power plants with CO2 capture on 
the order of several hundred megawatts (or several MtCO2). 
Demonstration of CO2 capture on this scale is needed to 
establish the reliability and environmental performance of 
different types of power systems with capture, to reduce 
the costs of CCS, and to improve confidence in the cost 
estimates. In addition, large-scale implementation is needed 
to obtain better estimates of the costs and performance of 
CCS in industrial processes, such as the cement and steel 
industries, that are significant sources of CO2 but have little 
or no experience with CO2 capture. 
 
With regard to mineral carbonation technology, a major 
question is how to exploit the reaction heat in practical 
designs that can reduce costs and net energy requirements. 
Experimental facilities at pilot scales are needed to address 
these gaps.
 
With regard to industrial uses of captured CO2, further 
study of the net energy and CO2 balance of industrial 
processes that use the captured CO2 could help to establish a 
more complete picture of the potential of this option. 
Geographical relationship between the sources and storage 
opportunities of CO2 
An improved picture of the proximity of major CO2 sources 
to suitable storage sites (of all types), and the establishment 
of cost curves for the capture, transport and storage of 
CO2, would facilitate decision-making about large-scale 
deployment of CCS. In this context, detailed regional 
assessments are required to evaluate how well large CO2 
emission sources (both current and future) match suitable 
storage options that can store the volumes required. 
Geological storage capacity and effectiveness
There is a need for improved storage capacity estimates at the 
global, regional and local levels, and for a better understanding 
of long-term storage, migration and leakage processes. 
Addressing the latter issue will require an enhanced ability to 
monitor and verify the behaviour of geologically stored CO2. 
The implementation of more pilot and demonstration storage 
projects in a range of geological, geographical and economic 
settings would be important to improve our understanding of 
these issues.
Impacts of ocean storage
Major knowledge gaps that should be filled before the risks 
and potential for ocean storage can be assessed concern the 
ecological impact of CO2 in the deep ocean. Studies are 
needed of the response of biological systems in the deep sea 
to added CO2, including studies that are longer in duration 
and larger in scale than those that have been performed until 
49
 Technical Summary
now. Coupled with this is a need to develop techniques and 
sensors to detect and monitor CO2 plumes and their biological 
and geochemical consequences.
Legal and regulatory issues
Current knowledge about the legal and regulatory 
requirements for implementing CCS on a larger scale is still 
inadequate. There is no appropriate framework to facilitate the 
implementation of geological storage and take into account 
the associated long-term liabilities. Clarification is needed 
regarding potential legal constraints on storage in the marine 
environment (ocean or sub-seabed geological storage). Other 
key knowledge gaps are related to the methodologies for 
emissions inventories and accounting.
Global contribution of CCS to mitigating climate change
There are several other issues that would help future decision-
making about CCS by further improving our understanding 
of the potential contribution of CCS to the long-term global 
mitigation and stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations. 
These include the potential for transfer and diffusion of 
CCS technologies, including opportunities for developing 
countries to exploit CCS, its application to biomass sources 
of CO2, and the potential interaction between investment in 
CCS and other mitigation options. Further investigation is 
warranted into the question of how long CO2 would need to 
be stored. This issue is related to stabilization pathways and 
intergenerational aspects.

ExECutIvE SummARy
According to IPCC’s Third Assessment Report:
• 
 ‘There is new and stronger evidence that most of the 
warming observed over the past 50 years is attributable to 
human activities. 
• 
 Human influences are expected to continue to change 
atmospheric composition throughout the 21st century.’ 
The greenhouse gas making the largest contribution from 
human activities is carbon dioxide (CO2). It is released by 
burning fossil fuels and biomass as a fuel; from the burning, 
for example, of forests during land clearance; and by certain 
industrial and resource extraction processes. 
• 
 ‘Emissions of CO2 due to fossil fuel burning are virtually 
certain to be the dominant influence on the trends in 
atmospheric CO2 concentration during the 21st century. 
• 
 Global average temperatures and sea level are projected to 
rise under all (…) scenarios.’ 
The ultimate objective of the UN Framework Convention on 
Climate Change, which has been accepted by 189 nations, is 
to achieve ‘(…) stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations 
in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous 
anthropogenic interference with the climate system’, although 
a specific level has yet to be agreed.
 
Technological options for reducing net CO2 emissions to the 
atmosphere include:
• 
 reducing energy consumption, for example by increasing the 
efficiency of energy conversion and/or utilization (including 
enhancing less energy-intensive economic activities);
• 
 switching to less carbon intensive fuels, for example natural 
gas instead of coal;
• 
 increasing the use of renewable energy sources or nuclear 
energy, each of which emits little or no net CO2;
• 
 sequestering CO2 by enhancing biological absorption 
capacity in forests and soils;
• 
capturing and storing CO2 chemically or physically.
The first four technological options were covered in earlier 
IPCC reports; the fifth option, the subject of this report, is 
Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage (CCS). In this approach, 
CO2 arising from the combustion of fossil and/or renewable 
fuels and from processing industries would be captured and 
stored away from the atmosphere for a very long period of time. 
This report analyzes the current state of knowledge about the 
scientific and technical, economic and policy dimensions of this 
option, in order to allow it to be considered in relation to other 
options for mitigating climate change. 
 
At present, the global concentration of CO2 in the 
atmosphere is increasing. If recent trends in global CO2 
emissions continue, the world will not be on a path towards 
stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations. Between 1995 
and 2001, average global CO2 emissions grew at a rate of 1.4% 
per year, which is slower than the growth in use of primary 
energy but higher than the growth in CO2 emissions in the 
previous 5 years. Electric-power generation remains the single 
largest source of CO2 emissions, emitting as much CO2 as the 
rest of the industrial sector combined, while the transport sector 
is the fastest-growing source of CO2 emissions. So meeting the 
ultimate goal of the UNFCCC will require measures to reduce 
emissions, including the further deployment of existing and 
new technologies.
 
The extent of emissions reduction required will depend on 
the rate of emissions and the atmospheric concentration target. 
The lower the chosen stabilization concentration and the higher 
the rate of emissions expected in the absence of mitigation 
measures, the larger must be the reduction in emissions and 
the earlier that it must occur. In many of the models that 
IPCC has considered, stabilization at a level of 550 ppmv of 
CO2 in the atmosphere would require a reduction in global 
emissions by 2100 of 7–70% compared with current rates. 
Lower concentrations would require even greater reductions. 
Achieving this cost-effectively will be easier if we can choose 
flexibly from a broad portfolio of technology options of the 
kind described above. 
 
The purpose of this report is to assess the characteristics 
of CO2 capture and storage as part of a portfolio of this kind. 
There are three main components of the process: capturing 
CO2, for example by separating it from the flue gas stream of a 
fuel combustion system and compressing it to a high pressure; 
transporting it to the storage site; and storing it. CO2 storage 
will need to be done in quantities of gigatonnes of CO2 per year 
to make a significant contribution to the mitigation of climate 
change, although the capture and storage of smaller amounts, at 
costs similar to or lower than alternatives, would make a useful 
contribution to lowering emissions. Several types of storage 
reservoir may provide storage capacities of this magnitude. In 
some cases, the injection of CO2 into oil and gas fields could 
lead to the enhanced production of hydrocarbons, which would 
help to offset the cost. CO2 capture technology could be applied 
to electric-power generation facilities and other large industrial 
sources of emissions; it could also be applied in the manufacture 
of hydrogen as an energy carrier. Most stages of the process 
build on known technology developed for other purposes. 
 
There are many factors that must be considered when 
deciding what role CO2 capture and storage could play in 
mitigating climate change. These include the cost and capacity 
of emission reduction relative to, or in combination with, other 
options, the resulting increase in demand for primary energy 
sources, the range of applicability, and the technical risk. Other 
important factors are the social and environmental consequences, 
the safety of the technology, the security of storage and ease of 
monitoring and verification, and the extent of opportunities to 
transfer the technology to developing countries. Many of these 
features are interlinked. Some aspects are more amenable to 
rigorous evaluation than others. For example, the literature 
about the societal aspects of this new mitigation option is 
limited. Public attitudes, which are influenced by many factors, 
including how judgements are made about the technology, will 
also exert an important influence on its application. All of these 
aspects are discussed in this report.

IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
1.1 
 Background to the report
IPCC’s Third Assessment Report stated ‘there is new and 
stronger evidence that most of the warming observed over 
the past 50 years is attributable to human activities’. It went 
on to point out that ‘human influences will continue to change 
atmospheric composition throughout the 21st century’ (IPCC, 
2001c). Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the greenhouse gas that makes 
the largest contribution from human activities. It is released 
into the atmosphere by: the combustion of fossil fuels such as 
coal, oil or natural gas, and renewable fuels like biomass; by 
the burning of, for example, forests during land clearance; and 
from certain industrial and resource extraction processes. As a 
result ‘emissions of CO2 due to fossil fuel burning are virtually 
certain to be the dominant influence on the trends in atmospheric 
CO2 concentration during the 21st century’ and ‘global average 
temperatures and sea level are projected to rise under all … 
scenarios’ (IPCC, 2001c).
 
The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change 
(UNFCCC), which has been ratified by 189 nations and has 
now gone into force, asserts that the world should achieve an 
atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases (GHGs) that 
would prevent ‘dangerous anthropogenic interference with the 
climate system’ (UNFCCC, 1992), although the specific level 
of atmospheric concentrations has not yet been quantified. 
Technological options for reducing anthropogenic emissions1 of 
CO2 include (1) reducing the use of fossil fuels (2) substituting 
less carbon-intensive fossil fuels for more carbon-intensive fuels 
(3) replacing fossil fuel technologies with near-zero-carbon 
alternatives and (4) enhancing the absorption of atmospheric 
CO2 by natural systems. In this report, the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) explores an additional option:
Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage (CCS)2. This report will 
analyze the current state of knowledge in order to understand 
the technical, economic and policy dimensions of this climate 
change mitigation option and make it possible to consider it in 
context with other options.
1.1.1 
What is CO2 capture and storage?
CO2 capture and storage involves capturing the CO2 arising from 
the combustion of fossil fuels, as in power generation, or from 
the preparation of fossil fuels, as in natural-gas processing.
 
It can also be applied to the combustion of biomass-based 
fuels and in certain industrial processes, such as the production 
of hydrogen, ammonia, iron and steel, or cement. Capturing 
CO2 involves separating the CO2 from some other gases3. The 
CO2 must then be transported to a storage site where it will be 
1 In this report, the term ‘emissions’ is taken to refer to emissions from 
anthropogenic, rather than natural, sources.
2 CO2 capture and storage is sometimes referred to as carbon sequestration. In 
this report, the term ‘sequestration’ is reserved for the enhancement of natural 
sinks of CO2, a mitigation option which is not examined in this report but in 
IPCC 2000b. 
3 For example, in the flue gas stream of a power plant, the other gases are mainly 
nitrogen and water vapour.
stored away from the atmosphere for a very long time (IPCC, 
2001a). In order to have a significant effect on atmospheric 
concentrations of CO2, storage reservoirs would have to be 
large relative to annual emissions.
1.1.2 
Why a special report on CO2 capture and storage?
The capture and storage of carbon dioxide is a technically 
feasible method of making deep reductions in CO2 emissions 
from sources such as those mentioned above. Although it can be 
implemented mainly by applying known technology developed 
for other purposes, its potential role in tackling climate change 
was not recognized as early as some other mitigation options. 
Indeed, the topic received little attention in IPCC’s Second and 
Third Assessment Reports (IPCC 1996a, 2001b) – the latter 
contained a three-page review of technological progress, and 
an overview of costs and the environmental risks of applying 
such technology. In recent years, the technical literature on 
this field has expanded rapidly. Recognizing the need for a 
broad approach to assessing mitigation options, the potential 
importance of issues relating to CO2 capture and storage and 
the extensive literature on other options (due to their longer 
history), IPCC decided to undertake a thorough assessment 
of CO2 capture and storage. For these reasons it was thought 
appropriate to prepare a Special Report on the subject. This 
would constitute a source of information of comparable nature to 
the information available on other, more established mitigation 
options. In response to the invitation from the 7th Conference of 
the Parties to the UNFCCC in Marrakech4, the IPCC plenary 
meeting in April 2002 decided to launch work on CO2 capture 
and storage.
1.1.3 
Preparations for this report
In preparation for this work, the 2002 Plenary decided that 
IPCC should arrange a Workshop under the auspices of 
Working Group III, with inputs from Working Groups I and II, 
to recommend how to proceed. This workshop took place in 
Regina, Canada, in November 2002 (IPCC, 2002). Three options 
were considered at the workshop: the production of a Technical 
Report, a Special Report, or the postponement of any action 
until the Fourth Assessment Report. After extensive discussion, 
the Workshop decided to advise IPCC to produce a Special 
Report on CO2 capture and storage. At IPCC’s Plenary Meeting 
in February 2003, the Panel acknowledged the importance of 
issues relating to CO2 capture and storage and decided that a 
Special Report would be the most appropriate way of assessing 
the technical, scientific and socio-economic implications of 
capturing anthropogenic CO2 and storing it in natural reservoirs. 
The Panel duly gave approval for work to begin on such a report 
with 2005 as the target date for publication.
 
The decision of the 2002 Plenary Meeting required the 
report to cover the following issues:
4 This draft decision called on IPCC to prepare a ‘technical paper on geological 
carbon storage technologies’.

should be used.
1.1.4 
Purpose of this introduction
This chapter provides an introduction in three distinct ways: it 
provides the background and context for the report; it provides 
an introduction to CCS technology; and it provides a framework 
for the CCS assessment methods used in later chapters. 
 
Because this report is concerned with the physical capture, 
transport and storage of CO2, the convention is adopted of using 
physical quantities (i.e. tonnes) of CO2 rather than quantities 
of C, as is normal in the general literature on climate change. 
In order to make possible comparison of the results with other 
literature, quantities in tonnes of C are given in parenthesis.
1.2 
 Context for considering CO2 Capture and 
Storage
1.2.1 
Energy consumption and CO2 emissions
CO2 continued an upward trend in the early years of the 21st 
century (Figures 1.1, 1.2). Fossil fuels are the dominant form 
of energy utilized in the world (86%), and account for about 
75% of current anthropogenic CO2 emissions (IPCC, 2001c). In 
2002, 149 Exajoules (EJ) of oil, 91 EJ of natural gas, and 101 EJ 
of coal were consumed by the world’s economies (IEA, 2004). 
Global primary energy consumption grew at an average rate of 
1.4% annually between 1990 and 1995 (1.6% per year between 
1995 and 2001); the growth rates were 0.3% per year (0.9%) in 
the industrial sector, 2.1% per year (2.2%) in the transportation 
sector, 2.7% per year (2.1%) in the buildings sector, and –2.4% 
per year (–0.8%) in the agricultural/other sector (IEA, 2003).
Average global CO2 emissions5 increased by 1.0% per year 
between 1990 and 1995 (1.4% between 1995 and 2001), a rate 
slightly below that of energy consumption in both periods. In 
individual sectors, there was no increase in emissions from 
industry between 1990 and 1995 (0.9% per year from 1995 to 
2001); there was an increase of 1.7% per year (2.0%) in the 
transport sector, 2.3% per year (2.0%) in the buildings sector, 
and a fall of 2.8% per year (1.0%) in the agricultural/other 
sector (IEA, 2003). 
 
Total emissions from fossil fuel consumption and flaring 
of natural gas were 24 GtCO2 per year (6.6 GtC per year) in 
2001 – industrialized countries were responsible for 47% of  
energy-related CO2 emissions (not including international 
bunkers6). The Economies in Transition accounted for 13% 
of 2001 emissions; emissions from those countries have 
been declining at an annual rate of 3.3% per year since 1990. 
Developing countries in the Asia-Pacific region emitted 25% 
of the global total of CO2; the rest of the developing countries 
accounted for 13% of the total (IEA, 2003).
5 There are differences in published estimates of CO2 emissions for many
countries, as Marland et al. (1999) have shown using two ostensibly similar 
sources of energy statistics.
6 Emissions from international bunkers amounted to 780 Mt CO2 (213 MtC) in 
2001 (IEA, 2003).

1.2.2 
Sectoral CO2 emissions
The CO2 emissions from various sources worldwide have been 
estimated by the IEA (2003). These are shown in Table 1.1, 
which shows that power generation is the single largest source 
of emissions. Other sectors where emissions arise from a few 
large point sources are Other Energy Industries7 and parts of the 
Manufacturing and Construction sector. 
 
Emissions from transport, which is the second largest 
sector (Table 1.1), have been growing faster than those from 
energy and industry in the last few decades (IPCC, 2001a); a 
key difference is that transport emissions are mainly from a 
multiplicity of small, distributed sources. These differences 
have implications for possible uses of CO2 capture and storage, 
as will be seen later in this chapter.
1.2.3 
Other greenhouse gas emissions
Anthropogenic climate change is mainly driven by emissions of 
CO2 but other greenhouse gases (GHGs) also play a part8. Since 
some of the anthropogenic CO2 comes from industrial processes 
and some from land use changes (mainly deforestation), the 
contribution from fossil fuel combustion alone is about half of 
the total from all GHGs. 
 
In terms of impact on radiative forcing, methane is the 
next most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas after CO2 
(currently accounting for 20% of the total impact) (IPCC, 
2001b). The energy sector is an important source of methane 
but agriculture and domestic waste disposal contribute more 
to the global total (IPCC, 2001c). Nitrous oxide contributes 
directly to climate change (currently 6% of the total impact 
of all GHGs); the main source is agriculture but another is 
7 The Other Energy Industries sector includes oil refineries, manufacture of 
solid fuels, coal mining, oil and gas extraction, and other energy-producing 
industries.
8 It is estimated that the global radiative forcing of anthropogenic CO2 is 
approximately 60% of the total due to all anthropogenic GHGs (IPCC, 
2001b).
the industrial production of some chemicals; other oxides of 
nitrogen have an indirect effect. A number of other gases make 
significant contributions (IPCC, 2001c).
1.2.4 
Scenarios of future emissions
Future emissions may be simulated using scenarios which are: 
‘alternative images of how the future might unfold and are (…) 
tools (…) to analyse how driving forces may influence future 
emissions (….) and to assess the associated uncertainties.’ ‘The 
possibility that any single emissions path will occur as described 
in scenarios is highly uncertain’ (IPCC, 2000a). In advance of 
the Third Assessment Report, IPCC made an effort to identify 
future GHG emission pathways. Using several assumptions, 
IPCC built a set of scenarios of what might happen to emissions 
up to the year 2100. Six groups of scenarios were published 
(IPCC, 2000a): the ‘SRES scenarios’. None of these assume 
any specific climate policy initiatives; in other words, they are 
base cases which can be used for considering the effects of 
mitigation options. An illustrative scenario was chosen for each 
of the groups. The six groups were organized into four ‘families’ 
covering a wide range of key ‘future’ characteristics such as 
demographic change, economic development, and technological 
change (IPCC, 2000a). Scenario families A1 and A2 emphasize 
economic development, whilst B1 and B2 emphasize global 
and local solutions for, respectively, economic, social and 
environmental sustainability. In addition, two scenarios, 
A1F1 and A1T, illustrate alternative developments in energy 
technology in the A1 world (see Figure TS.1 in IPCC, 2001a). 
 
Given the major role played by fossil fuels in supplying 
energy to modern society, and the long periods of time involved 
in changing energy systems (Marchetti and Nakicenovic, 1979), 
the continued use of fossil fuels is arguably a good base-case 
scenario. Further discussion of how CCS may affect scenarios 
can be found in Chapter 8. 
 
Most of these scenarios yield future emissions which are 
significantly higher than today’s levels. In 2100, these scenarios 
show, on average, between 50% and 250% as much annual

CO2 emissions as current rates. Adding together all of the CO2 
emissions projected for the 21st century, the cumulative totals 
lie in the range of 3,480 to 8,050 GtCO2 (950 to 2,200 GtC) 
depending on the selected scenario (IPCC, 2001e). 
 
It should be noted that there is potential for confusion 
about the term ‘leakage’ since this is widely used in the climate 
change literature in a spatial sense to refer to the displacement 
of emissions from one source to another. This report does not 
discuss leakage of this kind but it does look at the unintended 
release of CO2 from storage (which may also be termed leakage). 
The reader is advised to be aware of the possible ambiguity in 
the use of the term leakage and to have regard to the context 
where this word is used in order to clarify the meaning.
1.3 
Options for mitigating climate change
As mentioned above, the UN Framework Convention on 
Climate Change calls for the stabilization of the atmospheric 
concentration of GHGs but, at present, there is no agreement on 
what the specific level should be. However, it can be recognized 
that stabilization of concentrations will only occur once the 
rate of addition of GHGs to the atmosphere equals the rate at 
which natural systems can remove them – in other words, when 
the rate of anthropogenic emissions is balanced by the rate of 
uptake by natural processes such as atmospheric reactions, net 
transfer to the oceans, or uptake by the biosphere.
 
In general, the lower the stabilization target and the higher 
the level of baseline emissions, the larger the required reduction 
in emissions below the baseline, and the earlier that it must 
occur. For example, stabilization at 450 ppmv CO2 would 
require emissions to be reduced earlier than stabilization at 650 
ppmv, with very rapid emission reductions over the next 20 to 
30 years (IPCC, 2000a); this could require the employment of 
all cost-effective potential mitigation options (IPCC, 2001a). 
Another conclusion, no less relevant than the previous one, is 
that the range of baseline scenarios tells us that future economic 
development policies may impact greenhouse gas emissions as 
strongly as policies and technologies especially developed to 
address climate change. Some have argued that climate change 
is more an issue of economic development, for both developed 
and developing countries, than it is an environmental issue 
(Moomaw et al., 1999).
 
The Third Assessment Report (IPCC, 2001a) shows that, in 
many of the models that IPCC considered, achieving stabilization 
at a level of 550 ppmv would require global emissions to be 
reduced by 7–70% by 2100 (depending upon the stabilization 
profile) compared to the level of emissions in 2001. If the target 
were to be lower (450 ppmv), even deeper reductions (55–90%) 
would be required. For the purposes of this discussion, we will 
use the term ‘deep reductions’ to imply net reductions of 80% 
or more compared with what would otherwise be emitted by an 
individual power plant or industrial facility. 
 
In any particular scenario, it may be helpful to consider the 
major factors influencing CO2 emissions from the supply and 
use of energy using the following simple but useful identity 
(after Kaya, 1995):
CO2 emissions =
Population x 
GDP 
x 
Energy 
x 
Emissions
 
 
Population 
 
GDP 
 
Energy
This shows that the level of CO2 emissions can be understood to 
depend directly on the size of the human population, on the level 
of global wealth, on the energy intensity of the global economy, 
and on the emissions arising from the production and use of 
energy. At present, the population continues to rise and average 
energy use is also rising, whilst the amount of energy required 
per unit of GDP is falling in many countries, but only slowly 
(IPCC, 2001d). So achieving deep reductions in emissions will, 
all other aspects remaining constant, require major changes in 
the third and fourth factors in this equation, the emissions from 
energy technology. Meeting the challenge of the UNFCCC’s 
goal will therefore require sharp falls in emissions from energy 
technology. 
 
A wide variety of technological options have the potential 
to reduce net CO2 emissions and/or CO2 atmospheric 
concentrations, as will be discussed below, and there may be 
further options developed in the future. The targets for emission 
reduction will influence the extent to which each technique is 
used. The extent of use will also depend on factors such as 
cost, capacity, environmental impact, the rate at which the 
technology can be introduced, and social factors such as public 
acceptance.
1.3.1�
Improve�energy�efficiency
Reductions in fossil fuel consumption can be achieved by 
improving the efficiency of energy conversion, transport 
and end-use, including enhancing less energy-intensive 
economic activities. Energy conversion efficiencies have 
been increased in the production of electricity, for example by 
improved turbines; combined heating, cooling and electric-
power generation systems reduce CO2 emissions further still. 
Technological improvements have achieved gains of factors of 
2 to 4 in the energy consumption of vehicles, of lighting and 
many appliances since 1970; further improvements and wider 
application are expected (IPCC, 2001a). Further significant 
gains in both demand-side and supply-side efficiency can be 
achieved in the near term and will continue to slow the growth 
in emissions into the future; however, on their own, efficiency 
gains are unlikely to be sufficient, or economically feasible, to 
achieve deep reductions in emissions of GHGs (IPCC, 2001a).
1.3.2 
Switch to less carbon-intensive fossil fuels
Switching from high-carbon to low-carbon fuels can be cost-
effective today where suitable supplies of natural gas are 
available. A typical emission reduction is 420 kg CO2 MWh–1 
for the change from coal to gas in electricity generation; this is 
about 50% (IPCC, 1996b). If coupled with the introduction of 
the combined production of heat, cooling and electric power, 
the reduction in emissions would be even greater. This would 
58
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
make a substantial contribution to emissions reduction from a 
particular plant but is restricted to plant where supplies of lower 
carbon fuels are available.
1.3.3 
Increased use of low- and near-zero-carbon energy 
sources
Deep reductions in emissions from stationary sources could 
be achieved by widespread switching to renewable energy or 
nuclear power (IPCC, 2001a). The extent to which nuclear 
power could be applied and the speed at which its use might 
be increased will be determined by that industry’s ability to 
address concerns about cost, safety, long-term storage of nuclear 
wastes, proliferation and terrorism. Its role is therefore likely to 
be determined more by the political process and public opinion 
than by technical factors (IPCC, 2001a). 
 
There is a wide variety of renewable supplies potentially 
available: commercial ones include wind, solar, biomass, 
hydro, geothermal and tidal power, depending on geographic 
location. Many of them could make significant contributions 
to electricity generation, as well as to vehicle fuelling and 
space heating or cooling, thereby displacing fossil fuels (IPCC, 
2001a). Many of the renewable sources face constraints 
related to cost, intermittency of supply, land use and other 
environmental impacts. Between 1992 and 2002, installed wind 
power generation capacity grew at a rate of about 30% per year, 
reaching over 31 GWe by the end of 2002 (Gipe, 2004). Solar 
electricity generation has increased rapidly (by about 30% per 
year), achieving 1.1 GWe capacity in 2001, mainly in small-
scale installations (World Energy Assessment, 2004). This has 
occurred because of falling costs as well as promotional policies 
in some countries. Liquid fuel derived from biomass has also 
expanded considerably and is attracting the attention of several 
countries, for example Brazil, due to its declining costs and 
co-benefits in creation of jobs for rural populations. Biomass 
used for electricity generation is growing at about 2.5% per 
annum; capacity had reached 40 GWe in 2001. Biomass used 
for heat was estimated to have capacity of 210 GWth in 2001. 
Geothermal energy used for electricity is also growing in both 
developed and developing countries, with capacity of 3 GWe 
in 2001 (World Energy Assessment, 2004). There are therefore 
many options which could make deep reductions by substituting 
for fossil fuels, although the cost is significant for some and the 
potential varies from place to place (IPCC, 2001a).
1.3.4 
Sequester CO2 through the enhancement of 
natural, biological sinks
Natural sinks for CO2 already play a significant role in 
determining the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. They 
may be enhanced to take up carbon from the atmosphere. 
Examples of natural sinks that might be used for this purpose 
include forests and soils (IPCC, 2000b). Enhancing these sinks 
through agricultural and forestry practices could significantly 
improve their storage capacity but this may be limited by land 
use practice, and social or environmental factors. Carbon stored 
biologically already includes large quantities of emitted CO2 
but storage may not be permanent.
1.3.5 
CO2 capture and storage
As explained above, this approach involves capturing CO2 
generated by fuel combustion or released from industrial 
processes, and then storing it away from the atmosphere for a 
very long time. In the Third Assessment Report (IPCC, 2001a) 
this option was analyzed on the basis of a few, documented 
projects (e.g., the Sleipner Vest gas project in Norway, enhanced 
oil recovery practices in Canada and USA, and enhanced 
recovery of coal bed methane in New Mexico and Canada). That 
analysis also discussed the large potential of fossil fuel reserves 
and resources, as well as the large capacity for CO2 storage in 
depleted oil and gas fields, deep saline formations, and in the 
ocean. It also pointed out that CO2 capture and storage is more 
appropriate for large sources – such as central power stations, 
refineries, ammonia, and iron and steel plants – than for small, 
dispersed emission sources.
 
The potential contribution of this technology will be 
influenced by factors such as the cost relative to other options, 
the time that CO2 will remain stored, the means of transport 
to storage sites, environmental concerns, and the acceptability 
of this approach. The CCS process requires additional fuel and 
associated CO2 emissions compared with a similar plant without 
capture.
 
Recently it has been recognized that biomass energy used 
with CO2 capture and storage (BECS) can yield net removal of 
CO2 from the atmosphere because the CO2 put into storage comes 
from biomass which has absorbed CO2 from the atmosphere as 
it grew (Möllersten et al., 2003; Azar et al., 2003). The overall 
effect is referred to as ‘negative net emissions’. BECS is a new 
concept that has received little analysis in technical literature 
and policy discussions to date. 
1.3.6 
Potential for reducing CO2 emissions
It has been determined (IPCC, 2001a) that the worldwide 
potential for GHG emission reduction by the use of technological 
options such as those described above amounts to between 
6,950 and 9,500 MtCO2 per year (1,900 to 2,600 MtC per year) 
by 2010, equivalent to about 25 to 40% of global emissions 
respectively. The potential rises to 13,200 to 18,500 MtCO2 per 
year (3,600 to 5,050 MtC per year) by 2020. The evidence on 
which these estimates are based is extensive but has several 
limitations: for instance, the data used comes from the 1990s 
and additional new technologies have since emerged. In 
addition, no comprehensive worldwide study of technological 
and economic potential has yet been performed; regional and 
national studies have generally had different scopes and made 
different assumptions about key parameters (IPCC, 2001a).
 
The Third Assessment Report found that the option for 
reducing emissions with most potential in the short term (up to 
2020) was energy efficiency improvement while the near-term 
potential for CO2 capture and storage was considered modest, 
Chapter 1: Introduction
59
amounting to 73 to 183 MtCO2 per year (20 to 50 MtC per year) 
from coal and a similar amount from natural gas (see Table 
TS.1 in IPCC, 2001a). Nevertheless, faced with the longer-term 
climate challenge described above, and in view of the growing 
interest in this option, it has become important to analyze the 
potential of this technology in more depth.
 
As a result of the 2002 IPCC workshop on CO2 capture and 
storage (IPCC, 2002), it is now recognized that the amount of 
CO2 emissions which could potentially be captured and stored 
may be higher than the value given in the Third Assessment 
Report. Indeed, the emissions reduction may be very significant 
compared with the values quoted above for the period after 2020. 
Wider use of this option may tend to restrict the opportunity 
to use other supply options. Nevertheless, such action might 
still lead to an increase in emissions abatement because much 
of the potential estimated previously (IPCC, 2001a) was from 
the application of measures concerned with end uses of energy. 
Some applications of CCS cost relatively little (for example, 
storage of CO2 from gas processing as in the Sleipner project 
(Baklid et al., 1996)) and this could allow them to be used at 
a relatively early date. Certain large industrial sources could 
present interesting low-cost opportunities for CCS, especially 
if combined with storage opportunities which generate 
compensating revenue, such as CO2 Enhanced Oil Recovery 
(IEA GHG, 2002). This is discussed in Chapter 2.
1.3.7 
Comparing mitigation options
A variety of factors will need to be taken into account in any 
comparison of mitigation options, not least who is making 
the comparison and for what purpose. The remainder of this 
chapter discusses various aspects of CCS in a context which 
may be relevant to decision-makers. In addition, there are 
broader issues, especially questions of comparison with other 
mitigation measures. Answering such questions will depend 
on many factors, including the potential of each option to 
deliver emission reductions, the national resources available, 
the accessibility of each technology for the country concerned, 
national commitments to reduce emissions, the availability 
of finance, public acceptance, likely infrastructural changes, 
environmental side-effects, etc. Most aspects of this kind must 
be considered both in relative terms (e.g., how does this compare 
with other mitigation options?) and absolute terms (e.g., how 
much does this cost?), some of which will change over time as 
the technology advances.
 
The IPCC (2001a) found that improvements in energy 
efficiency have the potential to reduce global CO2 emissions 
by 30% below year-2000 levels using existing technologies 
at a cost of less than 30 US$/tCO2 (100 US$/tC). Half of this 
reduction could be achieved with existing technology at zero or 
net negative costs9. Wider use of renewable energy sources was 
also found to have substantial potential. Carbon sequestration by 
9 Meaning that the value of energy savings would exceed the technology capital 
and operating costs within a defined period of time using appropriate discount 
rates.
forests was considered a promising near-term mitigation option 
(IPCC, 2000b), attracting commercial attention at prices of 0.8 
to 1.1 US$/tCO2 (3-4 US$/tC). The costs quoted for mitigation 
in most afforestation projects are presented on a different 
basis from power generation options, making the afforestation 
examples look more favourable (Freund and Davison, 2002). 
Nevertheless, even after allowing for this, the cost of current 
projects is low.
 
It is important, when comparing different mitigation 
options, to consider not just costs but also the potential capacity 
for emission reduction. A convenient way of doing this is to 
use Marginal Abatement Cost curves (MACs) to describe the 
potential capacity for mitigation; these are not yet available 
for all mitigation options but they are being developed (see, 
for example, IEA GHG, 2000b). Several other aspects of the 
comparison of mitigation options are discussed later in this 
chapter and in Chapter 8.
1.4 
Characteristics of CO2 capture and storage
In order to help the reader understand how CO2 capture and 
storage could be used as a mitigation option, some of the key 
features of the technology are briefly introduced here.
1.4.1 
Overview of the CO2 capture and storage concept 
and its development
Capturing CO2 typically involves separating it from a gas stream. 
Suitable techniques were developed 60 years ago in connection 
with the production of town gas; these involved scrubbing the gas 
stream with a chemical solvent (Siddique, 1990). Subsequently 
they were adapted for related purposes, such as capturing CO2 
from the flue gas streams of coal- or gas-burning plant for the 
carbonation of drinks and brine, and for enhancing oil recovery. 
These developments required improvements to the process so 
as to inhibit the oxidation of the solvent in the flue gas stream. 
Other types of solvent and other methods of separation have 
been developed more recently. This technique is widely used 
today for separating CO2 and other acid gases from natural gas 
streams10. Horn and Steinberg (1982) and Hendriks et al. (1989) 
were among the first to discuss the application of this type of 
technology to mitigation of climate change, focusing initially 
on electricity generation. CO2 removal is already used in the 
production of hydrogen from fossil fuels; Audus et al. (1996) 
discussed the application of capture and storage in this process 
as a climate protection measure. 
 
In order to transport CO2 to possible storage sites, it is 
compressed to reduce its volume; in its ‘dense phase’, CO2 
occupies around 0.2% of the volume of the gas at standard 
temperature and pressure (see Appendix 1 for further information 
10 The total number of installations is not known but is probably several 
thousand. Kohl and Nielsen (1997) mention 334 installations using physical 
solvent scrubbing; this source does not provide a total for the number of 
chemical solvent plants but they do mention one survey which alone examined 
294 amine scrubbing plants. There are also a number of membrane units and 
other methods of acid gas treatment in use today. 
60
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
about the properties of CO2). Several million tonnes per year of 
CO2 are transported today by pipeline (Skovholt, 1993), by ship 
and by road tanker.
 
In principle, there are many options available for the storage 
of CO2. The first proposal of such a concept (Marchetti, 1977) 
envisaged injection of CO2 into the ocean so that it was carried 
into deep water where, it was thought, it would remain for 
hundreds of years. In order to make a significant difference to 
the atmospheric loading of greenhouse gases, the amount of 
CO2 that would need to be stored in this way would have to be 
significant compared to the amounts of CO2 currently emitted to 
the atmosphere – in other words gigatonnes of CO2 per year. The 
only potential storage sites with capacity for such quantities are 
natural reservoirs, such as geological formations (the capacity 
of European formations was first assessed by Holloway et 
al., 1996) or the deep ocean (Cole et al., 1993). Other storage 
options have also been proposed, as discussed below.
 
Injection of CO2 underground would involve similar 
technology to that employed by the oil and gas industry for 
the exploration and production of hydrocarbons, and for 
the underground injection of waste as practised in the USA. 
Wells would be drilled into geological formations and CO2 
would be injected in the same way as CO2 has been injected 
for enhanced oil recovery11 since the 1970s (Blunt et al., 1993; 
Stevens and Gale, 2000). In some cases, this could lead to the 
enhanced production of hydrocarbons, which would help to 
offset the cost. An extension of this idea involves injection into 
saline formations (Koide et al., 1992) or into unminable coal 
seams (Gunter et al., 1997); in the latter case, such injection 
may sometimes result in the displacement of methane, which 
could be used as a fuel. The world’s first commercial-scale 
CO2 storage facility, which began operation in 1996, makes use 
of a deep saline formation under the North Sea (Korbol and 
Kaddour, 1995; Baklid et al., 1996).
 
Monitoring will be required both for purposes of managing 
the storage site and verifying the extent of CO2 emissions 
reduction which has been achieved. Techniques such as seismic 
surveys, which have developed by the oil and gas industry, have 
been shown to be adequate for observing CO2 underground 
(Gale et al., 2001) and may form the basis for monitoring CO2 
stored in such reservoirs.
 
Many alternatives to the storage of dense phase CO2 have 
been proposed: for example, using the CO2 to make chemicals 
or other products (Aresta, 1987), fixing it in mineral carbonates 
for storage in a solid form (Seifritz, 1990; Dunsmore, 1992), 
storing it as solid CO2 (‘dry ice’) (Seifritz, 1992), as CO2 
hydrate (Uchida et al., 1995), or as solid carbon (Steinberg, 
1996). Another proposal is to capture the CO2 from flue gases 
using micro-algae to make a product which can be turned into a 
biofuel (Benemann, 1993).
 
The potential role of CO2 capture and storage as a mitigation 
11 For example, there were 40 gas-processing plants in Canada in 2002 separating 
CO2 and H2S from produced natural gas and injecting them into geological 
reservoirs (see Chapter 5.2.4). There are also 76 Enhanced Oil Recovery 
projects where CO2 is injected underground (Stevens and Gale, 2000).
option has to be examined using integrated energy system models 
(early studies by Yamaji (1997) have since been followed by 
many others). An assessment of the environmental impact of the 
technology through life cycle analysis was reported by Audus 
and Freund (1997) and other studies have since examined this 
further.
 
The concept of CO2 capture and storage is therefore based 
on a combination of known technologies applied to the new 
purpose of mitigating climate change. The economic potential 
of this technique to enable deep reductions in emissions was 
examined by Edmonds et al. (2001), and is discussed in more 
detail in Chapter 8. The scope for further improvement of the 
technology and for development of new ideas is examined in 
later chapters, each of which focuses on a specific part of the 
system.
1.4.2 
Systems for CO2 capture
Figure 1.3 illustrates how CO2 capture and storage may be 
configured for use in electricity generation. A conventional 
fossil fuel-fired power plant is shown schematically in Figure 
1.3a. Here, the fuel (e.g., natural gas) and an oxidant (typically 
air) are brought together in a combustion system; heat from this 
is used to drive a turbine/generator which produces electricity. 
The exhaust gases are released to atmosphere.
 
Figure 1.3b shows a plant of this kind modified to capture 
CO2 from the flue gas stream, in other words after combustion. 
Once it has been captured, the CO2 is compressed in order to 
transport it to the storage site. Figure 1.3c shows another variant 
where CO2 is removed before combustion (pre-combustion 
decarbonization). Figure 1.3d represents an alternative where 
nitrogen is extracted from air before combustion; in other words, 
pure oxygen is supplied as the oxidant. This type of system is 
commonly referred to as oxyfuel combustion. A necessary part 
of this process is the recycling of CO2 or water to moderate the 
combustion temperature.
1.4.3 
Range of possible uses
The main application examined so far for CO2 capture and 
storage has been its use in power generation. However, in other 
large energy-intensive industries (e.g., cement manufacture, oil 
refining, ammonia production, and iron and steel manufacture), 
individual plants can also emit large amounts of CO2, so these 
industries could also use this technology. In some cases, for 
example in the production of ammonia or hydrogen, the nature 
of the exhaust gases (being concentrated in CO2) would make 
separation less expensive. 
 
The main applications foreseen for this technology are 
therefore in large, central facilities that produce significant 
quantities of CO2. However, as indicated in Table 1.1, roughly 
38% of emissions arise from dispersed sources such as buildings 
and, in particular, vehicles. These are generally not considered 
suitable for the direct application of CO2 capture because of the 
economies of scale associated with the capture processes as well 
as the difficulties and costs of transporting small amounts of

61
CO2. An alternative approach would be to reduce the emissions 
from dispersed sources by supplying them with an energy 
carrier with zero net CO2 emissions from use, such as biofuels, 
electricity or hydrogen (Johansson et al., 1993). Electricity 
or hydrogen12 from fossil fuels could be produced with CO2 
capture and this would avoid most of the CO2 emissions at the 
production site (Audus et al., 1996). The cost, applicability and 
environmental aspects of various applications are discussed 
later in this report.
1.4.4 
Scale of the plant
Some impression of the scale of the plant involved can be gained 
from considering a coal-fired power plant generating 500MWe. 
This would emit approximately 2.9 MtCO2 per year (0.8 MtC 
per year) to atmosphere. A comparable plant with CO2 capture 
and storage, producing a similar amount of electricity and 
capturing 85% of the CO2 (after combustion) and compressing 
it for transportation, would emit 0.6 MtCO2 per year to the 
atmosphere (0.16 MtC per year), in other words 80% less than 
in the case without capture. The latter plant would also send 
3.4 MtCO2 per year to storage (0.9 MtC per year). Because of 
its larger size, the amount of CO2 generated by the plant with 
capture and compression is more than the plant without capture 
(in this example 38% more). This is a result of the energy 
12 Hydrogen is produced from fossil fuels today in oil refineries and other 
industrial processes.
requirements of the capture plant and of the CO2 compressor. 
The proportion of CO2 captured (85%) is a level readily 
achievable with current technology (this is discussed in Chapter 
3); it is certainly feasible to capture a higher proportion and 
designs will vary from case to case. These figures demonstrate 
the scale of the operation of a CO2 capture plant and illustrate 
that capturing CO2 could achieve deep reductions in emissions 
from individual power plants and similar installations (IEA 
GHG, 2000a). 
 
Given a plant of this scale, a pipeline of 300–400 mm 
diameter could handle the quantities of CO2 over distances 
of hundreds of kilometres without further compression; for 
longer distances, extra compression might be required to 
maintain pressure. Larger pipelines could carry the CO2 from 
several plants over longer distances at lower unit cost. Storage 
of CO2, for example by injection into a geological formation, 
would likely involve several million tonnes of CO2 per year but 
the precise amount will vary from site to site, as discussed in 
Chapters 5 and 6.

Assessing CCS in terms of environmental impact 
and cost
The purpose of this section and those that follow is to introduce 
some of the other issues which are potentially of interest to 
decision-makers when considering CCS. Answers to some 
of the questions posed may be found in subsequent chapters, 
although answers to others will depend on further work and

local information. When looking at the use of CCS, important 
considerations will include the environmental and resource 
implications, as well as the cost. A systematic process of 
evaluation is needed which can examine all the stages of 
the CCS system in these respects and can be used for this 
and other mitigation options. A well-established method of 
analyzing environmental impacts in a systematic manner is the 
technique of Life Cycle Analysis (LCA). This is codified in the 
International Standard ISO 14040 (ISO, 1997). The first step 
required is the establishment of a system boundary, followed 
by a comparison of the system with CCS and a base case 
(reference system) without CCS. The difference will define the 
environmental impact of CCS. A similar approach will allow a 
systematic assessment of the resource and/or cost implications 
of CCS.
1.5.1 
Establishing a system boundary
A generic system boundary is shown in Figure 1.4, along with 
the flows of materials into and out of the system. The key flow13 
is the product stream, which may be an energy product (such 
as electricity or heat), or another product with economic value 
such as hydrogen, cement, chemicals, fuels or other goods. In 
analyzing the environmental and resource implications of CCS, 
the convention used throughout this report is to normalize all 
of the system inputs and outputs to a unit quantity of product 
(e.g., electricity). As explained later, this concept is essential for 
establishing the effectiveness of this option: in this particular 
case, the total amount of CO2 produced is increased due to 
the additional equipment and operation of the CCS plant. In 
contrast, a simple parameter such as the amount of CO2 captured 
may be misleading.
 
Inputs to the process include the fossil fuels used to meet 
process energy requirements, as well as other materials used 
by the process (such as water, air, chemicals, or biomass used 
as a feedstock or energy source). These may involve renewable 
or non-renewable resources. Outputs to the environment 
include the CO2 stored and emitted, plus any other gaseous, 
liquid or solid emissions released to the atmosphere, water or 
land. Changes in other emissions – not just CO2 – may also 
13 Referred to as the ‘elementary flow’ in life cycle analysis.
be important. Other aspects which may be relatively unique 
to CCS include the ability to keep the CO2 separate from the 
atmosphere and the possibility of unpredictable effects (the 
consequences of climate change, for example) but these are not 
quantifiable in an LCA.
 
Use of this procedure would enable a robust comparison of 
different CCS options. In order to compare a power plant with 
CCS with other ways of reducing CO2 emissions from electricity 
production (the use of renewable energy, for example), a broader 
system boundary may have to be considered.
1.5.2 
Application to the assessment of environmental 
and resource impacts
The three main components of the CO2 capture, transport and 
storage system are illustrated in Figure 1.5 as sub-systems 
within the overall system boundary for a power plant with CCS. 
As a result of the additional requirements for operating the CCS 
equipment, the quantity of fuel and other material inputs needed 
to produce a unit of product (e.g., one MWh of electricity) is 
higher than in the base case without CCS and there will also be 
increases in some emissions and reductions in others. Specific 
details of the CCS sub-systems illustrated in Figure 1.5 are 
presented in Chapters 3–7, along with the quantification of CCS 
energy requirements, resource requirements and emissions.
1.5.3 
Application to cost assessment
The cost of CO2 capture and storage is typically built up from 
three separate components: the cost of capture (including 
compression), transport costs and the cost of storage (including 
monitoring costs and, if necessary, remediation of any release). 
Any income from EOR (if applicable) would help to partially 
offset the costs, as would credits from an emissions trading 
system or from avoiding a carbon tax if these were to be 
introduced. The costs of individual components are discussed 
in Chapters 3 to 7; the costs of whole systems and alternative 
options are considered in Chapter 8. The confidence levels of 
cost estimates for technologies at different stages of development 
and commercialization are also discussed in those chapters.
 
There are various ways of expressing the cost data (Freund 
and Davison, 2002). One convention is to express the costs in 
terms of US$/tCO2 avoided, which has the important feature 
of taking into account the additional energy (and emissions) 
resulting from capturing the CO2. This is very important for 
understanding the full effects on the particular plant of capturing 
CO2, especially the increased use of energy. However, as a means 
of comparing mitigation options, this can be confusing since the 
answer depends on the base case chosen for the comparison 
(i.e., what is being avoided). Hence, for comparisons with 
other ways of supplying energy or services, the cost of systems 
with and without capture are best presented in terms of a unit 
of product such as the cost of generation (e.g., US$ MWh–1) 
coupled with the CO2 emissions per unit of electricity generated 
(e.g., tCO2 MWh–1). Users can then choose the appropriate 
base case best suited to their purposes. This is the approach 
Figure 1.4 System boundary for a plant or process emitting CO2 
(such as a power plant, a hydrogen production plant or other 
industrial process). The resource and environmental impacts of a CCS 
system are measured by the changes in total system input and output 
quantities needed to produce a unit of product.
Chapter 1: Introduction
63
used in this report and it is consistent with the treatment of 
environmental implications described above.
 
Expressing the cost of mitigation in terms of US$/tCO2 
avoided is also the approach used when considering mitigation 
options for a collection of plants (such as a national electricity 
system). This approach is typically found in integrated 
assessment modelling for policy-related purposes (see Chapter 
8). The costs calculated in this way should not be compared 
with the cost of CO2-avoided calculated for an individual power 
plant of a particular design as described above because the base 
case will not be the same. However, because the term ‘avoided’ 
is used in both cases, there can be misunderstanding if a clear 
distinction is not made.
1.5.4 
Other cost and environmental impact issues
Most of the published studies of specific projects look at 
particular CO2 sources and particular storage reservoirs. They 
are necessarily based on the costs for particular types of plants, 
so that the quantities of CO2 involved are typically only a few 
million tonnes per year. Although these are realistic quantities 
for the first projects of this kind, they fail to reflect the potential 
economies of scale which are likely if or when this technology is 
widely used for mitigation of climate change, which would result 
in the capture, transport and storage of much greater quantities 
of CO2. As a consequence of this greater use, reductions can 
be expected in costs as a result of both economies of scale and 
increased experience with the manufacture and operation of 
most stages of the CCS system. This will take place over a period 
of several decades. Such effects of ‘learning’ have been seen 
in many technologies, including energy technologies, although 
historically observed rates of improvement and cost reduction 
are quite variable and have not been accurately predicted for any 
specific technology (McDonald and Schrattenholzer, 2001).
 
The construction of any large plant will generate issues 
relating to environmental impact, which is why impact analyses 
are required in many countries before the approval of such 
projects. There will probably be a requirement for gaining a 
permit for the work. Chapters 3 to 7 discuss in more detail the 
environmental issues and impacts associated with CO2 capture, 
transport and storage. At a power plant, the impact will depend 
largely on the type of capture system employed and the extra 
energy required, with the latter increasing the flows of fuel and 
chemical reagents and some of the emissions associated with 
generating a megawatt hour of electricity. The construction and 
operation of CO2 pipelines will have a similar impact on the 
environment to that of the more familiar natural gas pipelines.
The large-scale transportation and storage of CO2 could also be 
a potential hazard, if significant amounts were to escape (see 
Annex I).
 
The different storage options may involve different 
obligations in terms of monitoring and liability. The monitoring 
of CO2 flows will take place in all parts of the system for 
reasons of process control. It will also be necessary to monitor 
the systems to ensure that storage is safe and secure, to provide 
data for national inventories and to provide a basis for CO2 
emissions trading.
 
In developing monitoring strategies, especially for reasons 
of regulatory compliance and verification, a key question is 
how long the monitoring must continue; clearly, monitoring 
will be needed throughout the injection phase but the frequency 
and extent of monitoring after injection has been completed still 
needs to be determined, and the organization(s) responsible for 
monitoring in the long term will have to be identified. In addition, 
when CO2 is used, for example, in enhanced oil recovery, it will 
be necessary to establish the net amount of CO2 stored. The 
extent to which the guidelines for reporting emissions already 
developed by IPCC need to be adapted for this new mitigation 
option is discussed in Chapter 9. 
 
In order to help understand the nature of the risks, a 
distinction may usefully be drawn between the slow seepage 
of CO2 and potentially hazardous, larger and unintended 
releases caused by a rapid failure of some part of the system 
(see Annex I for information about the dangers of CO2 in 
certain circumstances). CO2 disperses readily in turbulent air 
but seepage from stores under land might have noticeable 
effects on local ecosystems depending on the amount released 
and the size of the area affected. In the sea, marine currents 
would quickly disperse any CO2 dissolved in seawater. CO2 
seeping from a storage reservoir may intercept shallow aquifers 
or surface water bodies; if these are sources of drinking water, 
there could be direct consequences for human activity. There 
is considerable uncertainty about the potential local ecosystem 
damage that could arise from seepage of CO2 from underground 
reservoirs: small seepages may produce no detectable impact 
but it is known that relatively large releases from natural CO2 
reservoirs can inflict measurable damage (Sorey et al., 1996). 
However, if the cumulative amount released from purposeful 
storage was significant, this could have an impact on the 
climate. In that case, national inventories would need to take 
Figure 1.5 System components inside the boundary of Figure 1.4 for 
the case of a power plant with CO2 capture and storage. Solid arrows 
denote mass flows while dashed lines denote energy flows. The 
magnitude of each flow depends upon the type and design of each 
sub-system, so only some of the flows will be present or significant in 
any particular case. To compare a plant with CCS to another system 
with a similar product, for example a renewables-based power plant, 
a broader system boundary may have to be used.
64
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
this into account (as discussed in Chapter 9). The likely level 
of seepage from geological storage reservoirs is the subject of 
current research described in Chapter 5. Such environmental 
considerations form the basis for some of the legal barriers to 
storage of CO2 which are discussed in Chapters 5 and 6. 
 
The environmental impact of CCS, as with any other energy 
system, can be expressed as an external cost (IPCC, 2001d) but 
relatively little has been done to apply this approach to CCS 
and so it is not discussed further in this report. The results of an 
application of this approach to CCS can be found in Audus and 
Freund (1997).
1.6 
 Assessing CCS in terms of energy supply and CO2 
storage
Some of the first questions to be raised when the subject of CO2 
capture and storage is mentioned are:
• 
Are there enough fossil fuels to make this worthwhile?
• 
How long will the CO2 remain in store?
• 
Is there sufficient storage capacity and how widely is it 
available? 
These questions are closely related to the minimum time it 
is necessary to keep CO2 out of the atmosphere in order to 
mitigate climate change, and therefore to a fourth, overall, 
question: ‘How long does the CO2 need to remain in store?’ 
This section suggests an approach that can be used to answer 
these questions, ending with a discussion of broader issues 
relating to fossil fuels and other scenarios.
1.6.1 
Fossil fuel availability
Fossil fuels are globally traded commodities that are available 
to all countries. Although they may be used for much of the 
21st century, the balance of the different fuels may change. CO2 
capture and storage would enable countries, if they wish, to 
continue to include fossil fuels in their energy mix, even in the 
presence of severe restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions.
 
Whether fossil fuels will last long enough to justify the 
development and large-scale deployment of CO2 capture and 
storage depends on a number of factors, including their depletion 
rate, cost, and the composition of the fossil fuel resources and 
reserves.
1.6.1.1 
Depletion rate and cost of use
Proven coal, oil and natural gas reserves are finite, so 
consumption of these primary fuels can be expected to peak and 
then decline at some time in the future (IPCC, 2001a). However, 
predicting the pace at which use of fossil fuels will fall is far 
from simple because of the many different factors involved. 
Alternative sources of energy are being developed which will 
compete with fossil fuels, thereby extending the life of the 
reserves. Extracting fossil fuels from more difficult locations 
will increase the cost of supply, as will the use of feedstocks that 
require greater amounts of processing; the resultant increase in 
cost will also tend to reduce demand. Restrictions on emissions, 
whether by capping or tax, would also increase the cost of using 
fossil fuels, as would the introduction of CCS. At the same time, 
improved technology will reduce the cost of using these fuels. 
All but the last of these factors will have the effect of extending 
the life of the fossil fuel reserves, although the introduction of 
CCS would tend to push up demand for them.
1.6.1.2 
 Fossil fuel reserves and resources 
In addition to the known reserves, there are significant resources 
that, through technological advances and the willingness of 
society to pay more for them, may be converted into commercial 
fuels in the future. Furthermore, there are thought to be large 
amounts of non-conventional oil (e.g., heavy oil, tars sands, 
shales) and gas (e.g., methane hydrates). A quantification of 
these in the Third Assessment Report (IPCC, 2001a) showed 
that fully exploiting the known oil and natural gas resources 
(without any emission control), plus the use of non-conventional 
resources, would cause atmospheric concentrations of CO2 
to rise above 750 ppmv. In addition, coal resources are even 
larger than those of oil and gas; consuming all of them would 
enable the global economy to emit 5 times as much CO2 as 
has been released since 1850 (5,200 GtCO2 or 1,500 GtC) (see 
Chapter 3 in IPCC, 2001a). A scenario for achieving significant 
reductions in emissions but without the use of CCS (Berk et 
al., 2001) demonstrates the extent to which a shift away from 
fossil fuels would be required to stabilize at 450 ppmv by 2100. 
Thus, sufficient fossil fuels exist for continued use for decades 
to come. This means that the availability of fossil fuels does not 
limit the potential application of CO2 capture and storage; CCS 
would provide a way of limiting the environmental impact of 
the continued use of fossil fuels.
1.6.2�
Is�there�sufficient�storage�capacity?
To achieve stabilization at 550 ppmv, the Third Assessment 
Report (IPCC, 2001e) showed that, by 2100, the reduction in 
emissions might have to be about 38 GtCO2 per year (10 GtC 
per year)14 compared to scenarios with no mitigation action. If 
CO2 capture and storage is to make a significant contribution 
towards reducing emissions, several hundreds or thousands of 
plants would need to be built, each capturing 1 to 5 MtCO2 
per year (0.27–1.4 MtC per year). These figures are consistent 
with the numbers of plants built and operated by electricity 
companies and other manufacturing enterprises. 
 
Initial estimates of the capacity of known storage reservoirs 
(IEA GHG, 2001; IPCC, 2001a) indicate that it is comparable 
to the amount of CO2 which would be produced for storage by 
such plants. More recent estimates are given in Chapters 5 and 6, 
although differences between the methods for estimating storage 
capacity demonstrate the uncertainties in these estimates; these 
issues are discussed in later chapters. Storage outside natural 
reservoirs, for example in artificial stores or by changing CO2 
into another form (Freund, 2001), does not generally provide

six SRES marker scenarios; this value varies considerably depending on the 
scenario and the parameter values used in the climate model.
Chapter 1: Introduction
65
similar capacity for the abatement of emissions at low cost 
(Audus and Oonk, 1997); Chapter 7 looks at some aspects of 
this. 
 
The extent to which these reservoirs are within reasonable, 
cost-competitive distances from the sources of CO2 will 
determine the potential for using this mitigation option. 
1.6.3 
How long will the CO2 remain in storage?
This seemingly simple question is, in fact, a surprisingly 
complicated one to answer since the mechanisms and rates of 
release are quite different for different options. In this report, 
we use the term ‘fraction retained’ to indicate how much CO2 
remains in store for how long. The term is defined as follows:
• 
 ‘Fraction retained’ is the fraction of the cumulative amount 
of injected CO2 that is retained in the storage reservoir over a 
specified period of time, for example a hundred or a million 
years.
Chapters 5, 6 and 7 provide more information about particular 
types of storage. Table AI.6 in Annex I provides the relation 
between leakage of CO2 and the fraction retained. The above 
definition makes no judgement about how the amount of CO2 
retained in storage will evolve over time – if there were to be an 
escape of CO2, the rate may not be uniform.
 
The  CO2 storage process and its relationship to concentrations 
in the atmosphere can be understood by considering the stocks 
of stored CO2 and the flows between reservoirs. Figure 1.6 
contains a schematic diagram that shows the major stocks in 
natural and potential engineered storage reservoirs, and the 
flows to and from them. In the current pattern of fossil fuel use, 
CO2 is released directly to the atmosphere from human sources. 
The amount of CO2 released to the atmosphere by combustion 
and industrial processes can be reduced by a combination of the 
various mitigation measures described above. These flows are 
shown as alternative pathways in Figure 1.6.
 
The flows marked CCS with a subscript are the net tons 
of carbon dioxide per year that could be placed into each of 
the three types of storage reservoir considered in this report. 
Additional emissions associated with the capture and storage 
process are not explicitly indicated but may be considered as 
additional sources of CO2 emission to the atmosphere. The 
potential release flows from the reservoirs to the atmosphere 
are indicated by R, with a subscript indicating the appropriate 
reservoir. In some storage options, the release flows can be very

flows exclude residual emissions associated with the process of capture and storage). The release flows from each of the storage reservoirs are 
indicated by the labels R. The stock in the atmosphere depends upon the difference between the rates at which CO2 reaches the atmosphere and 
at which it is removed. Flows to the atmosphere may be slowed by a combination of mitigation options, such as improving energy efficiency or 
the use of alternatives to fossil fuels, by enhancing biological storage or by storing CCS in geological formations, in the oceans or in chemicals 
or minerals.
66
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
small compared to the flows into those storage reservoirs.
 
The amount in storage at a particular time is determined by 
the capacity of the reservoir and the past history of additions 
to, and releases from, the reservoir. The change in stocks of 
CO2 in a particular storage reservoir over a specified time is 
determined by the current stock and the relative rates at which 
the gas is added and released; in the case of ocean storage, the 
level of CO2 in the atmosphere will also influence the net rate of 
release15. As long as the input storage rate exceeds the release 
rate, CO2 will accumulate in the reservoir, and a certain amount 
will be stored away from the atmosphere. Analyses presented 
in this report conclude that the time frames for different storage 
options cover a wide range:
• 
The terrestrial biosphere stores and releases both natural and 
fossil fuel CO2 through the global carbon cycle. It is difficult 
to provide a simple picture of the fraction retained because 
of the dynamic nature of this process. Typically, however, 
99% is stored for decades to centuries, although the average 
lifetime will be towards the lower end of that range. The 
terrestrial biosphere at present is a net sink for carbon 
dioxide but some current biological sinks are becoming net 
sources as temperatures rise. The annual storage flows and 
total carbon storage capacity can be enhanced by forestry 
and soil management practices. Terrestrial sequestration is 
not explicitly considered in this report but it is covered in 
IPCC, 2000b. 
• 
Oceans hold the largest amount of mobile CO2. They absorb 
and release natural and fossil fuel CO2 according to the 
dynamics of the global carbon cycle, and this process results 
in changes in ocean chemistry. The fraction retained by ocean 
storage at 3,000 m depth could be around 85% after 500 
years. However, this process has not yet been demonstrated 
at a significant scale for long periods. Injection at shallower 
depths would result in shorter retention times. Chapter 6 
discusses the storage capacity and fractions retained for 
ocean storage. 
• 
In geological storage, a picture of the likely fraction retained 
may be gained from the observation of natural systems 
where CO2 has been in natural geological reservoirs for 
millions of years. It may be possible to engineer storage 
reservoirs that have comparable performance. The fraction 
retained in appropriately selected and managed geological 
reservoirs is likely to exceed 99% over 1000 years. However, 
sudden gas releases from geological reservoirs could be 
triggered by failure of the storage seal or the injection well, 
earthquakes or volcanic eruptions, or if the reservoir were 
accidentally punctured by subsequent drilling activity. Such 
releases might have significant local effects. Experience 
with engineered natural-gas-storage facilities and natural 
CO2 reservoirs may be relevant to understanding whether 
such releases might occur. The storage capacity and fraction 
retained for the various geological storage options are 
discussed in Chapter 5.
• 
Mineral carbonation through chemical reactions would

For further discussion of this point, see Chapter 6.
provide a fraction retained of nearly 100% for exceptionally 
long times in carbonate rock. However, this process has 
not yet been demonstrated on a significant scale for long 
periods and the energy balance may not be favourable. This 
is discussed in Chapter 7.
• 
Converting carbon dioxide into other, possibly useful, 
chemicals may be limited by the energetics of such reactions, 
the quantities of chemicals produced and their effective 
lifetimes. In most cases this would result in very small net 
storage of CO2. Ninety-nine per cent of the carbon will be 
retained in the product for periods in the order of weeks 
to months, depending on the product. This is discussed in 
Chapter 7.
1.6.4 
How long does the CO2 need to remain in storage? 
In deciding whether a particular storage option meets mitigation 
goals, it will be important to know both the net storage capacity 
and the fraction retained over time. Alternative ways to frame 
the question are to ask ‘How long is enough to achieve a stated 
policy goal?’ or ‘What is the benefit of isolating a specific amount 
of CO2 away from the atmosphere for a hundred or a million 
years?’ Understanding the effectiveness of storage involves 
the consideration of factors such as the maximum atmospheric 
concentration of CO2 that is set as a policy goal, the timing of 
that maximum, the anticipated duration of the fossil fuel era, 
and available means of controlling the CO2 concentration in the 
event of significant future releases.
 
The issue for policy is whether CO2 will be held in a particular 
class of reservoirs long enough so that it will not increase the 
difficulty of meeting future targets for CO2 concentration in 
the atmosphere. For example, if 99% of the CO2 is stored for 
periods that exceed the projected time span for the use of fossil 
fuels, this should not to lead to concentrations higher than those 
specified by the policy goal. 
 
One may assess the implications of possible future 
releases of CO2 from storage using simulations similar to 
those developed for generating greenhouse gas stabilization 
trajectories16. A framework of this kind can treat releases from 
storage as delayed emissions. Some authors examined various 
ways of assessing unintended releases from storage and found 
that a delay in emissions in the order of a thousand years may 
be almost as effective as perfect storage (IPCC, 2001b; Herzog 
et al., 2003; Ha-Duong and Keith, 2003)17. This is true if 
marginal carbon prices remain constant or if there is a backstop 
technology that can cap abatement costs in the not too distant 
16 Such a framework attempts to account for the intergenerational trade-
offs between climate impact and the cost of mitigation and aims to select an 
emissions trajectory (modified by mitigation measures) that maximizes overall 
welfare (Wigley et al., 1996; IPCC, 2001a).
17 For example, Herzog et al. (2003) calculated the effectiveness of an ocean 
storage project relative to permanent storage using economic arguments; given 
a constant carbon price, the project would be 97% effective at a 3% discount 
rate; if the price of carbon were to increase at the same rate as the discount 
rate for 100 years and remain constant thereafter, the project would be 80% 
effective; for a similar rate of increase but over a 500 year period, effectiveness 
would be 45%.

future. However, if discount rates decline in the long term, then 
releases of CO2 from storage must be lower in order to achieve 
the same level of effectiveness. 
 
Other authors suggest that the climate impact of CO2 
released from imperfect storage will vary over time, so they 
expect carbon prices to depend on the method of accounting for 
the releases. Haugan and Joos (2004) found that there must be 
an upper limit to the rate of loss from storage in order to avoid 
temperatures and CO2 concentrations over the next millennium 
becoming higher in scenarios with geological CCS than in those 
without it18. 
Dooley and Wise (2003) examined two hypothetical release 
scenarios using a relatively short 100-year simulation. They 
showed that relatively high rates of release from storage make it 
impossible to achieve stabilization at levels such as 450 ppmv. 
They imply that higher emissions trajectories are less sensitive 
to such releases but, as stabilization is not achieved until later 
under these circumstances, this result is inconclusive.
 
Pacala (2003) examined unintended releases using a 
simulation over several hundred years, assuming that storage 
security varies between the different reservoirs. Although 
this seemed to suggest that quite high release rates could be 
acceptable, the conclusion depends on extra CO2 being captured 
and stored, and thereby accumulating in the more secure 
reservoirs. This would imply that it is important for reservoirs 
with low rates of release to be available. 
 
Such perspectives omit potentially important issues such 
as the political and economic risk that policies will not be 
implemented perfectly, as well as the resulting ecological risk 
due to the possibility of non-zero releases which may preclude 
the future stabilization of CO2 concentrations (Baer, 2003). 
Nevertheless, all methods imply that, if CO2 capture and storage 
is to be acceptable as a mitigation measure, there must be an 
upper limit to the amount of unintended releases.
 
The discussion above provides a framework for considering 
the effectiveness of the retention of CO2 in storage and suggests 
a potential context for considering the important policy question: 
‘How long is long enough?’ Further discussion of these issues 
can be found in Chapters 8 and 9.
1.6.5 
Time frame for the technology 
Discussions of CCS mention various time scales. In this 
section, we propose some terminology as a basis for the later 
discussion.
 
Energy systems, such as power plant and electricity 
transmission networks, typically have operational lifetimes of 
18 These authors calculated the effectiveness of a storage facility measured in 
terms of the global warming avoided compared with perfect storage. For a store 
which annually releases 0.001 of the amount stored, effectiveness is around 
60% after 1000 years. This rate of release would be equivalent to a fraction 
retained of 90% over 100 years or 60% over 500 years. It is likely that, in 
practice, geological and mineral storage would have lower rates of release than 
this (see chapters 5 and 7) and hence higher effectiveness – for example, a 
release rate of 0.01% per year would be equivalent to a fraction retained of 99% 
over 100 years or 95% over 500 years.
30–40 years; when refurbishment or re-powering is taken into 
account, the generating station can be supplying electricity for 
even longer still. Such lifetimes generate expectations which 
are reflected in the design of the plant and in the rate of return 
on the investment. The capture equipment could be built and 
refurbished on a similar cycle, as could the CO2 transmission 
system. The operational lifetime of the CO2 storage reservoir 
will be determined by its capacity and the time frame over 
which it can retain CO2, which cannot be so easily generalized. 
However, it is likely that the phase of filling the reservoir will 
be at least as long as the operational lifetime of a power plant19. 
In terms of protecting the climate, we shall refer to this as the 
medium term, in contrast to the short-term nature of measures 
connected with decisions about operating and maintaining such 
facilities.
 
In contrast, the mitigation of climate change is determined 
by longer time scales: for example, the lifetime (or adjustment 
time) of CO2 in the atmosphere is often said to be about 100 
years (IPCC, 2001c). Expectations about the mitigation of 
climate change typically assume that action will be needed 
during many decades or centuries (see, for example, IPCC, 
2000a). This will be referred to as the long term.
Even so, these descriptors are inadequate to describe the storage 
of CO2 as a mitigation measure. As discussed above, it is 
anticipated that CO2 levels in the atmosphere would rise, peak 
and decline over a period of several hundred years in virtually 
all scenarios; this is shown in Figure 1.7. If there is effective 
action to mitigate climate change, the peak would occur sooner 
19 It should be noted that there will not necessarily be a one-to-one correspondence 
between a CO2-producing plant and storage reservoir. Given a suitable network 
for the transport of CO2, the captured CO2 from one plant could be stored in 
different locations during the lifetime of the producing plant.
Figure 1.7 The response of atmospheric CO2 concentrations due to emissions 
to the atmosphere. Typical values for ‘short term’, ‘medium term’, ‘long term’ 
and’ very long term’ are years, decades, centuries, millennia, respectively. 
In this example, cumulative emissions are limited to a maximum value and 
concentrations stabilize at 550 ppmv (adapted from Kheshgi, 2003). This figure 
is indicative and should not be read as prescribing specific values for any of 
these periods. If the goal were to constrain concentrations in the atmosphere 
to lower levels, such as 450 ppmv, greater reductions in emission rates would 
be required.

IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
(and be at a lower level) than if no action is taken. As suggested 
above, most of the CO2 must be stored for much longer than the 
time required to achieve stabilization. We consider this to be the 
very long term, in other words periods of time lasting centuries 
or millennia. Precisely how long is a subject of much debate at 
present and this will be explored in later chapters.
1.6.6 
Other effects of introducing CCS into scenarios
In view of the economic importance of energy carriers (more 
than 2 trillion dollars annually, World Energy Assessment, 
2004) as well as fossil fuel’s contribution to climate forcing (50 
to 60% of the total), the decision to invest economic resources 
in the development of a technology such as CCS may have far-
reaching consequences, including implications for equity and 
sustainable development (these are discussed in the following 
section). This emphasizes the importance of considering the 
wider ramifications of such investment.
 
The implementation of CCS would contribute to the 
preservation of much of the energy infrastructure established 
in the last century and may help restrain the cost of meeting 
the target for emissions reduction. From another perspective, 
its use may reduce the potential for application of alternative 
energy sources (Edmonds et al., 2001). As noted in section 
1.3, the mitigation of climate change is a complex issue and it 
seems likely that any eventual solution will involve a portfolio 
of methods20. Even so, there is concern in some quarters that the 
CO2 capture and storage option could capture financial resources 
and the attention of policymakers that would otherwise be 
spent on alternative measures, although this issue has not been 
extensively analyzed in the literature. 
 
The possibility of obtaining net negative emissions when 
coupling biomass energy and CCS may provide an opportunity 
to reduce CO2 concentration in the atmosphere if this option is 
available at a sufficiently large scale. In view of the uncertainty 
about the safe concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, a 
large-scale option providing net negative emissions could be 
especially useful in the light of the precautionary principle.
1.6.6.1 
Effect of CCS on energy supply and use
All of the SRES scenarios (IPCC, 2000a) show significant 
consumption of fossil fuels for a long time into the future. One 
of the consequences of deploying CCS would be a continued 
use of fossil fuels in the energy mix but the minimization of 
their effect on the climate system and environment. By enabling 
countries to access a wider range of energy supplies than would 
otherwise be the case, energy security will be improved. Such 
aspects are important when considering climate change policy 
and sustainable development: as indicated before, decision-
makers are likely to balance pure economic effectiveness 
against other socially relevant issues.
20 The optimum portfolio of mitigation measures is likely to be different in 
different places and at different times. Given the variety of measures available, 
it seems likely that several will be used in a complementary fashion as part of 
the portfolio, and that there will not be a single clear ‘winner’ amongst them.
 
The successful development and implementation of CCS on 
a large scale might therefore be interpreted by society as a driver 
for reinforcing socio-economic and behavioural trends that are 
increasing total energy use, especially in developed countries 
and within high-income groups in developing countries21 
(IPCC, 2001a).
 1.6.6.2 
Effect of CCS on technological diversity 
The fossil fuel energy system and its infrastructure can be 
thought of as a technology cluster. Such a phenomenon can be 
recognized as possibly presenting dangers as well as offering 
benefits for society. It can lead to specialization as innovations 
improve on dominant technologies, thereby generating further 
innovations which help to retain market share. On the other 
hand, innovations in technologies with small market shares are 
less valuable and so there is less incentive to improve on those 
technologies; a minor technology can therefore become trapped 
by high costs and a small market share. This phenomenon leads 
to path dependence or technology lock-in (Bulter and Hofkes, 
2004; Unruh, 2000). Although CCS has not yet been examined 
specifically in this respect, it may be that reinforcing the 
position of the fossil fuel energy system may present barriers to 
increased technological diversity (a key element in evolutionary 
change; see Nelson and Winter, 1982). 
 
It could be argued that increasing demand for some alternative 
energy sources will bring significant additional benefits outside 
the climate change arena such as rural sector jobs, or a large 
labour force for maintenance (World Energy Assessment, 
2004). It is not possible to forecast the full societal impacts of 
such technology in its early days, especially as it seems likely 
that stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of CO2 will require 
the full slate of available technologies (including ones not 
yet developed). The available information is not adequate for 
predictions of the differences in job creation potential between 
different mitigation options. 
 
In view of the paucity of literature on these aspects of CCS, 
this report cannot provide tools for a full quantitative judgment 
of options; it merely flags some of the other issues that decision-
makers will wish to consider. This is further discussed in Chapter 
8.
1.6.6.3 
Financing of the projects
Compared to a similar plant that releases CO2 to the atmosphere, 
a facility with capture and storage will cost more to build 
and to operate and will be less efficient in its use of primary 
energy. If regulations are adopted which cause the owners of 
CO2-emitting plant to limit emissions, and they choose to use 
CCS (or any other measure which increases their costs), they 
will need to find ways to recover the extra costs or accept a 
lower rate of return on their investment. In circumstances where 
emissions trading is allowed, companies may, in some cases, 
reduce the cost of meeting emission targets by buying or selling 
21 For example, housing units in many countries are increasing in size, and the 
intensity of electrical appliance use is increasing. The use of electrical office 
equipment in commercial buildings is also rising rapidly.

credits. Where the project is located in another Annex I country, 
it may be possible to fund this through Joint Implementation 
(JI). The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) may provide 
opportunities for developing countries to acquire technology for 
emission reduction purposes, with some of the costs being borne 
by external funders who can claim credit for these investments. 
At the time of writing, it is uncertain whether CCS projects 
would be covered by the CDM and there are many issues to 
be considered. The current low value of Certified Emission 
Reductions is a major barrier to such projects at present (IEA 
GHG, 2004a). It is possible that some CO2-EOR projects could 
be more attractive, especially if the project would also delay 
the abandonment of a field or prevent job losses. The issue of 
the longevity of storage has still to be resolved but the longer 
retention time for geological formations may make it easier for 
CCS to be accepted than was the case for natural sinks. A number 
of countries have the potential to host CCS projects involving 
geological storage under CDM (IEA GHG, 2004a) but the true 
potential can only be assessed when the underground storage 
resources have been mapped. The above discussion shows that 
there are many questions to be answered about the financing of 
such options, not least if proposed as a project under the flexible 
mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol. 
1.6.7 
Societal requirements
Even if CO2 capture and storage is cost-effective and can be 
recognized as potentially fulfilling a useful role in energy supply 
for a climate-constrained world, there will be other aspects that 
must be addressed before it can be widely used. For example, 
what are the legal issues that face this technology? What 
framework needs to be put in place for long-term regulation? 
Will CO2 capture and storage gain public acceptance?
1.6.7.1 
Legal issues concerning CCS
Some legal questions about CCS can be identified and answered 
relatively easily; for example, the legal issues relating to the 
process of capturing CO2 seem likely to be similar to those facing 
any large chemical plant. Transporting CO2 through pipelines 
can probably be managed under current regulatory regimes for 
domestic and international pipelines. The extent to which the 
CO2 is contaminated with other substances, such as compounds 
of sulphur (see Chapter 4), might alter its classification to that 
of a hazardous substance, subjecting it to more restrictive 
regulation. However, the storage of carbon dioxide is likely 
to pose new legal challenges. What licensing procedure will 
be required by national authorities for storage in underground 
reservoirs onshore? It seems likely that factors to be considered 
will include containment criteria, geological stability, potential 
hazard, the possibility of interference with other underground 
or surface activities and agreement on sub-surface property 
rights, and controls on drilling or mining nearby.
 
Storage in geological formations below the sea floor will be 
controlled by different rules from storage under land. The Law 
of the Sea22, the London Convention and regional agreements 
such as the OSPAR Convention23 will affect storage of CO2 
under the sea but the precise implications have yet to be worked 
out. This is discussed further in Chapter 5. Ocean storage raises 
a similar set of questions about the Law of the Sea and the 
London Convention but the different nature of the activity may 
generate different responses. These are discussed in Chapter 6. 
 
A further class of legal issues concerns the responsibility 
for stored carbon dioxide. This is relevant because the CO2 will 
have been the subject of a contract for storage, or a contract 
for emissions reduction, and/or because of the possibility of 
unintended release. Should society expect private companies to 
be responsible over centuries for the storage of CO2? A judgement 
may have to be made about a reasonable balance between the 
costs and benefits to current and to future generations. In the 
case of the very long-term storage of nuclear waste, states have 
taken on the responsibility for managing storage; the companies 
that generate the waste, and make a profit from using the nuclear 
material, pay a fee to the government to take responsibility. In 
other fields, the deep-well injection of hazardous materials is 
sometimes the responsibility of governments and sometimes 
the responsibility of the companies concerned under a licensing 
system (IEA GHG, 2004b). Rules about insurance and about 
liability (if there were to be a release of CO2) will need to be 
developed so that, even if something happens in the distant 
future, when the company that stored it is no longer in business, 
there will be a means of ensuring another organization is capable 
and willing to accept responsibility.
 
The information on legal issues presented in this report 
reflects the best understanding at the time of writing but should 
not be taken as definitive as the issues have not been tested.
1.6.7.2 
Public acceptance
Only a few studies have been carried out of public attitudes 
towards CCS. Such research presents challenges because the 
public is not familiar with the technology, and may only have a 
limited understanding of climate change and the possibilities for 
mitigation. As a result the studies completed to date have had 
to provide information on CCS (and on climate change) to their 
subjects. This tends to limit the scale of the study which can be 
carried out. This issue is examined in more detail in Chapter 5.
 
What form of public consultation will be needed before 
approval of a CCS project? Will the public compare CCS with 
other activities below ground such as the underground storage 
of natural gas or will CCS be compared to nuclear waste 
disposal? Will they have different concerns about different 
forms of storage, such as geological or ocean storage of CO2? 
Will the general attitude towards building pipelines affect the 
development of CO2 pipelines? These and other issues are the 
subject of current discussion and investigation. 
 
When a CCS project is proposed, the public and governments 
will want to be satisfied that storage of carbon dioxide is so

the OSPAR convention that regulates the uses of the North East Atlantic.

secure that emissions will be reduced and also that there will be 
no significant threat to human health or to ecosystems (Hawkins, 
2003). Carbon dioxide transport and storage will have to be 
monitored to ensure there is little or no release to the atmosphere 
but monitoring issues are still being debated. For example, can 
the anticipated low rates of CO2 release from geological storage 
be detected by currently available monitoring techniques? Who 
will do this monitoring (IEA GHG, 2004b)? How long should 
monitoring continue after injection: for periods of decades or 
centuries (IEA GHG, 2004c)?
1.7 
 Implications for technology transfer and 
sustainable development
1.7.1 
Equity and sustainable development
The climate change issue involves complex interactions between 
climatic, environmental, economic, political, institutional, 
social, scientific, and technological processes. It cannot be 
addressed in isolation from broader societal goals, such as 
equity or sustainable development (IPCC, 2001a), or other 
existing or probable future sources of environmental, economic 
or social stress. In keeping with this complexity, a multiplicity 
of approaches has emerged to analyze climate change and 
related challenges. Many of these incorporate concerns about 
development, equity, and sustainability, albeit partially and 
gradually (IPCC, 2001a). 
 
Sustainable development is too complex a subject for a 
simple summary; the study of this field aims to assess the benefits 
and trade-offs involved in the pursuit of the multiple goals of 
environmental conservation, social equity, economic growth, 
and eradication of poverty (IPCC, 2001a, Chapter 1). Most of 
the studies only make a first attempt to integrate a number of 
important sustainable development indicators and only a few 
have considered the implications for CCS (Turkenburg, 1997). 
To date, studies have focused on short-term side-effects of 
climate change mitigation policies (e.g., impact on local air 
and water quality) but they have also suggested a number of 
additional indicators to reflect development (e.g., job creation) 
and social impact (e.g., income distribution). CCS also poses 
issues relating to long-term liability for possible unintended 
releases or contamination which may have inter-generational 
and, in some cases, international consequences24. Further 
studies will be needed to develop suitable answers about CCS. 
In particular, long-term liability must be shown to be compatible 
with sustainable development.
 
There are various viewpoints relating to climate policy: 
one is based on cost-effectiveness, another on environmental 
sustainability, and another on equity (Munasinghe and Swart, 
24 Some legislation is already in place which will influence this: for example 
both the London Convention (Article X) and its 1996 Protocol (Article 15) 
contain provisions stating that liability is in accordance with the principles of 
international law regarding a state’s responsibility for damage caused to the 
environment of other states or to any other area of the environment. Similarly, 
regional agreements such as the OSPAR Convention incorporate the ‘polluter 
pays’ principle (Article 2(b)).
2005). Most policies designed to achieve the mitigation of 
climate change also have other important rationales. They can 
be related to the objectives of development, sustainability and 
equity. ‘Conventional’ climate policy analyses have tended 
to be driven (directly or indirectly) by the question: what is 
the cost-effective means of mitigating climate change for the 
global economy? Typically, these analyses start from a baseline 
projection of greenhouse gas emissions and reflect a specific set 
of socio-economic projections. Equity considerations are added 
to the process, to broaden the discussion from global welfare 
as a single subject to include the effects of climate change 
and mitigation policies on existing inequalities, amongst and 
within nations. The goal here goes beyond providing for basic 
survival, extending to a standard of living that provides security 
and dignity for all. 
 
Ancillary effects of mitigation policies may include 
reductions in local and regional air pollution, as well as indirect 
effects on transportation, agriculture, land use practices, 
biodiversity preservation, employment, fuel security, etc. 
(Krupnick et al., 2000). The concept of ‘co-benefits’ can be used 
to capture dimensions of the response to mitigation policies 
from the equity and sustainability perspectives in a way that 
could modify the projections produced by those working from 
the cost-effectiveness perspective. As yet, little analysis has 
been reported of the option of CCS in these respects.
 
Will CO2 capture and storage favour the creation of 
job opportunities for particular countries? Will it favour 
technological and financial elitism or will it enhance equity by 
reducing the cost of energy? In terms of sustainable development, 
does the maintenance of the current market structures aid those 
countries that traditionally market fossil fuels, relative to those 
that import them? Is this something which mitigation policies 
should be developed to assist? There are no simple answers to 
these questions but policymakers may want to consider them. 
However, no analysis of these aspects of CCS is yet available. 
Furthermore, the mitigation options available will vary from 
country to country; in each case, policymakers have to balance 
such ancillary benefits with the direct benefits of the various 
options in order to select the most appropriate strategy. 
1.7.2 
Technology transfer
Article 4.5 of the UNFCCC requires all Annex I countries to 
take ‘All practicable steps to promote, facilitate and finance, 
as appropriate, the transfer of, or access to, environmentally 
sound technologies and know-how to other parties, particularly 
developing countries, to enable them to implement provisions of 
the convention.’ This applies to CCS as much as it does to any 
other mitigation option. This was precisely stated in the declaration 
issued at COP 7 (UNFCCC, 2001). Paragraph 8, item (d) states: 
‘Cooperating in the development, diffusion and transfer (…) and/or 
technologies relating to fossil fuels that capture and store GHGs, 
and encouraging their wider use, and facilitating the participation 
of the least developed countries and other Parties not included in 
Annex I in this effort’
 
In achieving these objectives of the Convention, several key 
Chapter 1: Introduction
71
elements will have to be considered (IPCC, 2001a). These are 
discussed in the IPCC Special Report on Technology Transfer (IPCC, 
2000c), which looked into all aspects of the processes affecting the 
development, application and diffusion of technology. This looks at 
technology transfer for the purposes of adapting to climate change 
as well as for mitigation. It looks at processes within countries and 
between countries, covering hardware, knowledge and practices. 
Particularly important are the assessment of technology needs, the 
provision of technology information, capacity building, the creation 
of an enabling environment, and innovative financing to facilitate 
technology transfer. 
 
Although no academic examination of CCS in these respects 
has yet been undertaken, some remarks can be made in general 
about this mitigation option.
1.7.2.1 
Potential barriers
Technology transfer faces several barriers, including intellectual 
property rights, access to capital, etc. As with any new technology, 
CCS opens opportunities for proprietary rights. As it will rely 
on the development and/or integration of technologies, some of 
which are not yet used for such purposes, there is considerable 
scope for learning by doing. Several developing countries are 
already taking an active interest in this option, where they 
have national resources that would allow them to make use of 
this technique. For example, Deshun et al. (1998) have been 
looking at the related technique of CO2-EOR. Some of the key 
technologies will be developed by particular companies (as is 
occurring with wind power and solar photovoltaics) but will the 
intellectual property for CCS be accumulated in the hands of a 
few? CCS will involve both existing and future technologies, 
some of which will be proprietary. Will the owners of these 
rights to be willing to exploit their developments by licensing 
others to use them? At present it appears to be too early to 
answer these questions.
 
Given that the essential parts of CCS systems are based 
on established technology, it can be expected that it will be 
accessible to anyone who can afford it and wants to buy it. 
Several companies currently offer competing methods of 
capturing CO2; pipelines for CO2 and ships are constructed 
today by companies specializing in this type of equipment; the 
drilling of injection wells is standard practice in the oil and gas 
industry, and is carried out by many companies around the world. 
More specialist skills may be required to survey geological 
reservoirs; indeed, monitoring of CO2 underground is a very 
new application of seismic analysis. However, it is anticipated 
that, within a short space of time, these will become as widely 
available as other techniques derived from the international 
oil and gas industry. Making these technologies available to 
developing countries will pose similar challenges as those 
encountered with other modern technological developments. 
This shows the relevance of the UNFCCC declaration on 
technology transfer quoted above to ensure that developing 
countries have access to the option of CO2 capture and storage. 
1.7.2.2 
Potential users
CO2 emissions are rising rapidly in some developing countries; if 
these countries wish to reduce the rate of increase of emissions, 
they will want to have access to a range of mitigation options, 
one of which could be CCS. Initially it seems likely that CCS 
would be exploited by countries with relevant experience, such 
as oil and gas production25, but this may not be the case in other 
natural resource sectors. Will there be fewer opportunities for 
the transfer of CCS technology than for other mitigation options 
where technologies are in the hands of numerous companies? 
Or will the knowledge and experience already available in 
the energy sector in certain developing countries provide an 
opportunity for them to exploit CCS technologies? Will CO2 
capture and storage technologies attract more interest from 
certain developing countries if applied to biomass sources26? If 
there is a year-round supply of CO2 from the biomass processing 
plant and good storage reservoirs within reasonable distance, 
this could be an important opportunity for technology transfer. 
As yet there are no answers to these questions.

Contents of this report
This report provides an assessment of CO2 capture and storage 
as an option for the mitigation of climate change. The report 
does not cover the use of natural sinks to sequester carbon since 
this issue is covered in the Land Use, Land Use Change and 
Forestry report (IPCC, 2000b) and in IPCC’s Third Assessment 
Report (IPCC, 2001a). 
 
There are many technical approaches which could be used 
for capturing CO2. They are examined in Chapter 3, with the 
exception of biological processes for fixation of CO2 from flue 
gases, which are not covered in this report. The main natural 
reservoirs which could, in principle, hold CO2 are geological 
formations and the deep ocean; they are discussed in Chapters 
5 and 6 respectively. Other options for the storage and re-use of 
CO2 are examined in Chapter 7. 
 
Chapter 2 considers the geographical correspondence of 
CO2 sources and potential storage reservoirs, a factor that will 
determine the cost-effectiveness of moving CO2 from the place 
where it is captured to the storage site. A separate chapter, 
Chapter 4, is dedicated to transporting CO2 from capture to 
storage sites.
 
The overall cost of this technology and the consequences of 
including it in energy systems models are described in Chapter 
8. Some of the other requirements outlined above, such as 
legality, applicable standards, regulation and public acceptance, 
are discussed in detail at the appropriate point in several of 
the chapters. Governments might also wish to know how this 
method of emission reduction would be taken into account in 
national inventories of greenhouse gas emissions. This area is 
discussed in Chapter 9. Government and industry alike will be 
interested in the accessibility of the technology, in methods of 
financing the plant and in whether assistance will be available 
25 In 1999, there were 20 developing countries that were each producing more 
than 1% of global oil production, 14 developing countries that were each 
producing more than 1% of global gas production, and 7 developing countries 
producing more than 1% of global coal production (BP, 2003).

ExECutivE SummARy
Assessing CO2 capture and storage calls for a comprehensive 
delineation of CO2 sources. The attractiveness of a particular 
CO2 source for capture depends on its volume, concentration 
and partial pressure, integrated system aspects, and its proximity 
to a suitable reservoir. Emissions of CO2 arise from a number of 
sources, mainly fossil fuel combustion in the power generation, 
industrial, residential and transport sectors. In the power 
generation and industrial sectors, many sources have large 
emission volumes that make them amenable to the addition of 
CO2 capture technology. Large numbers of small point sources 
and, in the case of transport, mobile sources characterize the 
other sectors, making them less amenable for capture at present. 
Technological changes in the production and nature of transport 
fuels, however, may eventually allow the capture of CO2 from 
energy use in this sector.
 
Over 7,500 large CO2 emission sources (above 0.1 MtCO2 
yr-1) have been identified. These sources are distributed 
geographically around the world but four clusters of emissions 
can be observed: in North America (the Midwest and the eastern 
freeboard of the USA), North West Europe, South East Asia 
(eastern coast) and Southern Asia (the Indian sub-continent). 
Projections for the future (up to 2050) indicate that the number 
of emission sources from the power and industry sectors is 
likely to increase, predominantly in Southern and South East 
Asia, while the number of emission sources suitable for capture 
and storage in regions like Europe may decrease slightly.
 
Comparing the geographical distribution of the emission 
sources with geological storage opportunities, it can be seen 
that there is a good match between sources and opportunities. A 
substantial proportion of the emission sources are either on top 
of, or within 300 km from, a site with potential for geological 
storage. Detailed studies are, however, needed to confirm the 
suitability of such sites for CO2 storage. In the case of ocean 
storage, related research suggests that only a small proportion of 
large emission sources will be close to potential ocean storage 
sites. 
 
The majority of the emissions sources have concentrations 
of CO2 that are typically lower than 15%. However, a small 
proportion (less than 2%) have concentrations that exceed 
95%, making them more suitable for CO2 capture. The high-
content sources open up the possibility of lower capture costs 
compared to low-content sources because only dehydration 
and compression are required. The future proportion of high- 
and low-content CO2 sources will largely depend on the rate 
of introduction of hydrogen, biofuels, and the gasification or 
liquefaction of fossil fuels, as well as future developments in 
plant sizes. 
 
Technological changes, such as the centralized production 
of liquid or gaseous energy carriers (e.g., methanol, ethanol or 
hydrogen) from fossil sources or the centralized production of 
those energy carriers or electricity from biomass, may allow 
for CO2 capture and storage. Under these conditions, power 
generation and industrial emission sources would largely remain 
unaffected but CO2 emissions from transport and distributed 
energy-supply systems would be replaced by additional point 
sources that would be amenable to capture. The CO2 could 
then be stored either in geological formations or in the oceans. 
Given the scarcity of data, it is not possible to project the likely 
numbers of such additional point sources, or their geographical 
distribution, with confidence (estimates range from 0 to 1,400 
GtCO2 (0–380 GtC) for 2050).
 
According to six illustrative SRES scenarios, global CO2 
emissions could range from 29.3 to 44.2 GtCO2 (8–12 GtC) 
in 2020 and from 22.5 to 83.7 GtCO2 (6–23 GtC) in 2050. 
The technical potential of CO2 capture associated with these 
emission ranges has been estimated recently at 2.6–4.9 GtCO2 
for 2020 (0.7–1.3 GtC) and 4.9–37.5 GtCO2 for 2050 (1.3–10 
GtC). These emission and capture ranges reflect the inherent 
uncertainties of scenario and modelling analyses. However, 
there is one trend common to all of the six illustrative SRES 
scenarios: the general increase of future CO2 emissions in the 
developing countries relative to the industrialized countries.
2.1 
 Sources of CO2
This chapter aims to consider the emission sources of CO2 and 
their suitability for capture and subsequent storage, both now 
and in the future. In addition, it will look at alternative energy 
carriers for fossil fuels and at how the future development of 
this technology might affect the global emission sources of CO2 
and the prospects for capturing these emissions. 
 
Chapter 1 showed that the power and industry sectors 
combined dominate current global CO2 emissions, accounting 
for about 60% of total CO2 emissions (see Section 1.2.2). 
Future projections indicate that the share of these sectoral 
emissions will decline to around 50% of global CO2 emissions 
by 2050 (IEA, 2002). The CO2 emissions in these sectors are 
generated by boilers and furnaces burning fossil fuels and are 
typically emitted from large exhaust stacks. These stacks can be 
described as large stationary sources, to distinguish them from 
mobile sources such as those in the transport sector and from 
smaller stationary sources such as small heating boilers used 
in the residential sector. The large stationary sources represent 
potential opportunities for the addition of CO2 capture plants. 
The volumes produced from these sources are usually large and 
the plants can be equipped with a capture plant to produce a 
source of high-purity CO2 for subsequent storage. Of course, not 
all power generation and industrial sites produce their emissions 
from a single point source. At large industrial complexes like 
refineries there will be multiple exhaust stacks, which present 
an additional technical challenge in terms of integrating an 
exhaust-gas gathering system in an already congested complex, 
undoubtedly adding to capture costs (Simmonds et al., 2003). 
 
Coal is currently the dominant fuel in the power sector, 
accounting for 38% of electricity generated in 2000, with hydro 
power accounting for 17.5%, natural gas for 17.3%, nuclear for 
16.8%, oil for 9%, and non-hydro renewables for 1.6%. Coal is 
projected to remain the dominant fuel for power generation in 
2020 (about 36%), whilst natural-gas generation will become 
the second largest source, surpassing hydro. The use of biomass 
78
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
as a fuel in the power sector is currently limited. Fuel selection in 
the industrial sector is largely sector-specific. For example, the 
use of blast furnaces dominates primary steel production in the 
iron and steel sector, which primarily uses coal and coke (IEA 
GHG, 2000b; IPCC, 2001). In the refining and chemical sectors, 
oil and gas are the primary fuels. For industries like cement 
manufacture, all fossil fuels are used, with coal dominating in 
areas like the USA, China and India (IEA GHG, 1999), and oil 
and gas in countries like Mexico (Sheinbaum and Ozawa, 1998). 
However, the current trend in European cement manufacture is 
to use non-fossil fuels: these consist principally of wastes like 
tyres, sewage sludge and chemical-waste mixtures (IEA GHG, 
1999). In global terms, biomass is not usually a significant 
fuel source in the large manufacturing industries. However, in 
certain regions of the world, like Scandinavia and Brazil, it is 
acknowledged that biomass use can be significant (Möllersten 
et al., 2003). 
 
To reduce the CO2 emissions from the power and industry 
sectors through the use of CO2 capture and storage, it is important 
to understand where these emissions arise and what their 
geographical relationship is with respect to potential storage 
opportunities (Gale, 2002). If there is a good geographical 
relationship between the large stationary emission sources 
and potential geological storage sites then it is possible that a 
significant proportion of the emissions from these sources can 
be reduced using CO2 capture and storage. If, however, they are 
not well matched geographically, then there will be implications 
for the length and size of the transmission infrastructure that 
is required, and this could impact significantly on the cost of 
CO2 capture and storage, and on the potential to achieve deep 
reductions in global CO2 emissions. It may be the case that 
there are regions of the world that have greater potential for 
the application of CO2 capture and storage than others given 
their source/storage opportunity relationship. Understanding 
the regional differences will be an important factor in assessing 
how much of an impact CO2 capture and storage can have 
on global emissions reduction and which of the portfolio of 
mitigation options is most important in a regional context. 
 
Other sectors of the economy, such as the residential 
and transport sectors, contribute around 30% of global CO2 
emissions and also produce a large number of point source 
emissions. However, the emission volumes from the individual 
sources in these sectors tend to be small in comparison to those 
from the power and industry sectors and are much more widely 
distributed, or even mobile rather than stationary. It is currently 
not considered to be technically possible to capture emissions 
from these other small stationary sources, because there are still 
substantial technical and economic issues that need to be resolved 
(IPCC, 2001). However, in the future, the use of low-carbon 
energy carriers, such as electricity or hydrogen produced from 
fossil fuels, may allow CO2 emissions to be captured from the 
residential and transport sectors as well. Such fuels would most 
probably be produced in large centralized plants and would be 
accompanied by capture and storage of the CO2 co-product. The 
distributed fuels could then be used for distributed generation in 
either heaters or fuels cells and in vehicles in the transport sector. 
In this scenario, power generation and industrial sources would 
be unaffected but additional point sources would be generated 
that would also require storage. In the medium to long term 
therefore, the development and commercial deployment of such 
technology, combined with an accelerated shift to low- or zero-
carbon fuels in the transport sector, could lead to a significant 
change in the geographical pattern of CO2 emissions compared 
to that currently observed.

This section presents information on the characteristics of the 
CO2 emission sources. It is considered necessary to review the 
different CO2 contents and volumes of CO2 from these sources 
as these factors can influence the technical suitability of these 
emissions for storage, and the costs of capture and storage. 
2.2.1 
Present
2.2.1.1 
Source types
The emission sources considered in this chapter include all 
large stationary sources (>0.1 MtCO2 yr-1) involving fossil fuel 
and biomass use. These sources are present in three main areas: 
fuel combustion activities, industrial processes and natural-
gas processing. The largest CO2 emissions by far result from 
the oxidation of carbon when fossil fuels are burned. These 
emissions are associated with fossil fuel combustion in power 
plants, oil refineries and large industrial facilities. 
For the purposes of this report, large stationary sources are 
considered to be those emitting over 0.1 MtCO2 yr-1. This 
threshold was selected because the sources emitting less than 0.1 
MtCO2 yr-1 together account for less than 1% of the emissions 
from all the stationary sources under consideration (see Table 
2.1). However, this threshold does not exclude emissions 
capture at smaller CO2 sources, even though this is more costly 
and technically challenging.
 
Carbon dioxide not related to combustion is emitted from 
a variety of industrial production processes which transform 
materials chemically, physically or biologically. Such processes 
include:
•� the use of fuels as feedstocks in petrochemical processes 
(Chauvel and Lefebvre, 1989; Christensen and Primdahl, 
1994);
•� the use of carbon as a reducing agent in the commercial 
production of metals from ores (IEA GHG, 2000; IPCC, 
2001);
•� the thermal decomposition (calcination) of limestone and 
dolomite in cement or lime production (IEA GHG, 1999, 
IPCC 2001);
•� the fermentation of biomass (e.g., to convert sugar to 
alcohol).
In some instances these industrial-process emissions are 
produced in combination with fuel combustion emissions, 
a typical example being aluminium production (IEA GHG, 
2000). 
Chapter 2: Sources of CO2

A third type of source occurs in natural-gas processing 
installations. CO2 is a common impurity in natural gas, and it 
must be removed to improve the heating value of the gas or to 
meet pipeline specifications (Maddox and Morgan, 1998). 
2.2.1.2 
CO2 content
The properties of those streams that can be inputted to a CO2 
capture process are discussed in this section. In CO2 capture, the 
CO2 partial pressure of the gas stream to be treated is important 
as well as the concentration of the stream. For practical purposes, 
this partial pressure can be defined as the product of the total 
pressure of the gas stream times the CO2 mole fraction. It is a 
key variable in the selection of the separation method (this is 
discussed further in Chapter 3). As a rule of thumb, it can be 
said that the lower the CO2 partial pressure of a gas stream, the 
more stringent the conditions for the separation process. 
 
Typical CO2 concentrations and their corresponding partial 
pressures for large stationary combustion sources are shown in 
Table 2.1, which also includes the newer Integrated Gasification 
Combined Cycle technology (IGCC). Typically, the majority 
of emission sources from the power sector and from industrial 
processes have low CO2 partial pressures; hence the focus of 
the discussion in this section. Where emission sources with 
high partial pressure are generated, for example in ammonia 
or hydrogen production, these sources require only dehydration 
and some compression, and therefore they have lower capture 
costs.
 
Table 2.1 also provides a summary of the properties of 
CO2 streams originating from cement and metal production in 
which chemical transformations and combustion are combined. 
Flue gases found in power plants, furnaces in industries, blast 
furnaces and cement kilns are typically generated at atmospheric 
pressure and temperatures ranging between 100°C and 200°C, 
depending on the heat recovery conditions.
 
Carbon dioxide levels in flue gases vary depending on 
the type of fuel used and the excess air level used for optimal 
combustion conditions. Flue gas volumes also depend on these 
two variables. Natural-gas-fired power generation plants are 
typically combined cycle gas turbines which generate flue gases 
with low CO2 concentrations, typically 3–4% by volume (IEA 
GHG, 2002a). Coal for power generation is primarily burnt in 
pulverized-fuel boilers producing an atmospheric pressure flue 
gas stream with a CO2 content of up to 14% by volume (IEA 
GHG, 2002a). The newer and potentially more efficient IGCC 
technology has been developed for generating electricity from 
coal, heavy fuel oil and process carbonaceous residues. In this 
process the feedstock is first gasified to generate a synthesis gas 
(often referred to as ‘syngas’), which is burnt in a gas turbine 
after exhaustive gas cleaning (Campbell et al., 2000). Current 
IGCC plants where the synthesis gas is directly combusted in 
the turbine, like conventional thermal power plants, produce a 
flue gas with low CO2 concentrations (up to 14% by volume). 
At present, there are only fifteen coal- and oil-fired IGCC 
plants, ranging in size from 40 to 550 MW. They were started 
up in the 1980s and 1990s in Europe and the USA (Giuffrida et 
al., 2003). It should be noted that there are conceptual designs 
in which the CO2 can be removed before the synthesis gas is 
combusted, producing a high-concentration, high-pressure CO2 
exhaust gas stream that could be more suitable for storage (see 
Chapter 3 for more details). However, no such plants have been 
built or are under construction.
 
Fossil fuel consumption in boilers, furnaces and in process 
operations in the manufacturing industry also typically produces 
flue gases with low CO2 levels comparable to those in the power 
table 2.1  Properties of candidate gas streams that can be inputted to a capture process (Sources: Campbell et al., 2000; Gielen and Moriguchi, 
2003; Foster Wheeler, 1998; IEA GHG, 1999; IEA GHG, 2002a).

sector. CO2 concentrations in the flue gas from cement kilns 
depend on the production process and type of cement produced 
and are usually higher than in power generation processes (IEA 
GHG, 1999). Existing cement kilns in developing countries 
such as China and India are often relatively small. However, 
the quantity of CO2 produced by a new large cement kiln can be 
similar to that of a power station boiler. Integrated steel mills 
globally account for over 80% of CO2 emissions from steel 
production (IEA GHG, 2000b). About 70% of the carbon input 
to an integrated steel mill is present in the blast furnace gas, 
which is used as a fuel gas within the steel mill. CO2 could 
be captured before or after combustion of this gas. The CO2 
concentration after combustion in air would be about 27% by 
volume, significantly higher than in the flue gas from power 
stations. Other process streams within a steel mill may also be 
suitable candidates for CO2 capture before or after combustion. 
For example, the off-gas from an oxygen-steel furnace typically 
contains 16% CO2 and 70% carbon monoxide.
 
The off-gases produced during the fermentation of sugars 
to ethanol consist of almost pure CO2 with a few impurities. 
This gas stream is generated at a rate of 0.76 kg CO2
-1 and is 
typically available at atmospheric pressure (0.1 MPa) (Kheshgi 
and Prince, 2005). 
 
CO2 also occurs as an undesirable product that must be 
removed in some petrochemical processes, particularly those 
using synthesis gas as an intermediate or as an impurity in 
natural gas. The properties of the raw gas streams from which 
CO2 is customarily removed in some of these industries are 
shown in Table 2.2. It can be seen from Table 2.1 that the CO2 
partial pressures of flue gases are at least one order of magnitude 
less than the CO2 partial pressures of the streams arising from 
the processes listed in Table 2.2. This implies that CO2 recovery 
from fuel combustion streams will be comparatively much more 
difficult.
2.2.1.3 
Scale of emissions
A specific detailed dataset has been developed for CO2 stationary 
sources for 2000, giving their geographical distribution by 
process type and country (IEA GHG, 2002a). The stationary 
sources of CO2 in this database comprise power plants, oil 
refineries, gas-processing plants, cement plants, iron and steel 
plants and those industrial facilities where fossil fuels are used 
as feedstock, namely ammonia, ethylene, ethylene oxide and 
hydrogen. This global inventory contains over 14 thousand 
emission sources with individual CO2 emissions ranging from 
2.5 tCO2 yr-1 to 55.2 MtCO2 yr-1. The information for each single 
source includes location (city, country and region), annual CO2 
emissions and CO2 emission concentrations. The coordinates 
(latitude/longitude) of 74% of the sources are also provided. The 
total emissions from these 14 thousand sources amount to over 
13 GtCO2 yr-1. Almost 7,900 stationary sources with individual 
emissions greater than or equal to 0.1 MtCO2 per year have 
been identified globally. These emissions included over 90% of 
the total CO2 emissions from large point sources in 2000. Some 
6,000 emission sources with emissions below 0.1 MtCO2 yr-1 
were also identified, but they represent only a small fraction of 
the total emissions volume and were therefore excluded from 
further discussion in this chapter. There are also a number of 
regional and country-specific CO2 emission estimates for large 
sources covering China, Japan, India, North West Europe and 
Australia (Hibino, 2003; Garg et al., 2002; Christensen et al., 
2001, Bradshaw et al., 2002) that can be drawn upon. Table 
2.3 summarizes the information concerning large stationary 
sources according to the type of emission generating process. In 
the case of the petrochemical and gas-processing industries, the 
CO2 concentration listed in this table refers to the stream leaving 
the capture process. The largest amount of CO2 emitted from 
large stationary sources originates from fossil fuel combustion 
for power generation, with an average annual emission of 3.9 
MtCO2 per source. Substantial amounts of CO2 arise in the oil 
and gas processing industries while cement production is the 
largest emitter from the industrial sector. 
 
In the USA, 12 ethanol plants with a total productive capacity 
of 5.3 billion litres yr-1 each produce CO2 at rates in excess of 
0.1 MtCO2 yr-1 (Kheshgi and Prince, 2005); in Brazil, where 
ethanol production totalled over 14 billion litres per year during 
2003-2004, the average distillery productive capacity is 180 
million litres yr-1. The corresponding average fermentation CO2 
production rate is 0.14 MtCO2 yr-1, with the largest distillery 
producing nearly 10 times the average.

The top 25% of all large stationary CO2 emission sources 
(those emitting more than 1 MtCO2 per year) listed in Table 2.3 
account for over 85% of the cumulative emissions from these 
types of sources. At the other end of the scale, the lowest 41% 
(in the 0.1 to 0.5 MtCO2 range) contribute less than 10% (Figure 
2.1). There are 330 sources with individual emissions above 10 
MtCO2 per year. Of their cumulative emissions, 78% come from 
power plants, 20% from gas processing and the remainder from 
iron and steel plants (IEA GHG, 2000b). High-concentration/
high-partial-pressure sources (e.g., from ammonia/hydrogen 
production and gas processing operations) contribute a relatively 
low share (<2%) of the emissions from large stationary sources 
(van Bergen et al., 2004). However, these high-concentration 
sources could represent early prospects for the implementation 
of CO2 capture and storage. The costs for capture are lower than 
for low-concentration/low-partial-pressure sources. If these 
sources can then be linked to enhanced production schemes in 
the vicinity (<50km), like CO2-enhanced oil recovery, they could

b A relatively small fraction of these sources has a high concentration of CO2. In Canada, only two plants out of a total of 24 have high CO2 concentrations.
c  Based on an estimate that about half of the annual worldwide natural-gas production contains CO2 at concentrations of about 4% mol and that this CO2 content 
is normally reduced from 4% to 2% mol (see Section  3.2.2).
d  This amount corresponds to the emissions of those sources that have been individually identified in the reference database. The worldwide CO2 emissions, 
estimated by a top-down approach, are larger than this amount and exceed 1 Gt (Gielen and Moriguchi, 2003).

be low-cost options for CO2 capture and storage (van Bergen et 
al., 2004). Such sources emit 0.36 GtCO2 yr-1 (0.1 GtC yr-1), 
which equates to 3% of emissions from point sources larger than  
0.1 MtCO2 yr-1 (IEA GHG, 2002b). The geographical relationship 
between these high-concentration sources and prospective 
storage opportunities is discussed in Section 2.4.3. A small 
number of source streams with high CO2 concentrations are 
already used in CO2-EOR operations in the USA and Canada 
(Stevens and Gale, 2000).
2.2.2 
Future
Future anthropogenic CO2 emissions will be the product of 
different drivers such as demographic development, socio-
economic development, and technological changes (see 
Chapter 1, Section 1.2.4). Because their future evolution is 
inherently uncertain and because numerous combinations of 
different rates of change are quite plausible, analysts resort 
to scenarios as a way of describing internally consistent, 
alternative images of how the future might unfold. The IPCC 
developed a set of greenhouse gas emission scenarios for the 
period until 2100 (IPCC, 2000). The scenarios show a wide 
range of possible future worlds and CO2 emissions (see Figure 
2.2), consistent with the full uncertainty range of the underlying 
literature reported by Morita and Lee (1998). The scenarios 
are important as they provide a backdrop for determining the 
baseline for emission reductions that may be achieved with new 
technologies, including CO2 capture and storage implemented 
specially for such purposes.
 
Technology change is one of the key drivers in long-term 
scenarios and plays a critical role in the SRES scenarios. Future 
rates of innovation and diffusion are integral parts of, and vary 
with, the story lines. Scenario-specific technology change 
may differ in terms of technology clusters (i.e., the type of 
technologies used) or rate of diffusion. In the fossil-intensive 
A1FI scenario, innovation concentrates on the fossil source-
to-service chains stretching from exploration and resource 
extraction to fuel upgrading/cleaning, transport, conversion 
and end-use. Alternatively, innovation in the environmentally-
oriented B1 scenario focuses on renewable and hydrogen 
technologies.
 
The way in which technology change was included in the 
SRES scenarios depended on the particular model used. Some 
models applied autonomous performance improvements to 
fuel utilization, while others included specific technologies 
with detailed performance parameters. Even models with a 
strong emphasis on technology reflected new technologies or 
innovation in a rather generic manner. For example, advanced 
coal technology could be either an integrated coal gasification 
combined cycle (IGCC) plant, a pressurized fluidized bed 
combustion facility or any other, as-yet-unidentified, technology. 
The main characteristics of advanced coal technology are 
attractive investment costs, high thermal efficiency, potential 
multi-production integration and low pollution emissions – 
features that are prerequisites for any coal technology carrying 
the “advanced” label.
 
In general, technological diversity remained a feature in all 
scenarios, despite the fact that different clusters may dominate 
more in different scenarios. The trend towards cleaner and 
more convenient technologies, especially at the level of end-use 
(including transport), is common to all scenarios. In addition, 
transport fuels shift broadly towards supply schemes suitable 
for pre-combustion decarbonization. Centralized non-fossil 
technologies penetrate the power sector to various extents, 
while decentralized and home-based renewable and hydrogen-
production infrastructures expand in all scenarios, but mostly 
in the environmentally-conscious and technology-intensive 
scenarios.
 
Despite the trend towards cleaner fuels, CO2 emissions are 
projected to rise at different rates, at least until 2050. Emission 
patterns then diverge. Scenario-specific rates of technology 
change (performance improvements) and technology diffusion 
lead to different technology mixes, fuel uses and unit sizes. As 
regards fossil fuel use for power generation and industrial energy 
supply, the number of large stationary emission sources generally 
increases in the absence of restrictions on CO2 emissions and 
a fundamental change in the characteristics of these emission

and number of emission sources (Source: IEA GHG, 2002a).

sources is unlikely to occur before 2050. In addition, the ratio 
of low-concentration to high-concentration emission sources 
remains relatively stable, with low-concentration sources 
dominating the emission profile. 
 
In some scenarios, low- or zero-carbon fuels such as 
ethanol, methanol or hydrogen begin to dominate the transport 
sector and make inroads into the industrial, residential and 
commercial sectors after 2050. The centralized production of 
such fuels could lead to a significant change in the number of 
high-concentration emission sources and a change in the ratio 
of low- to high-purity emission sources; this is discussed in 
more detail in Section 2.5.2.
2.3 
Geographical distribution of sources
This section discusses the geographical locations of large point 
sources discussed in the preceding sections. It is necessary to 
understand how these sources are geographically distributed 
across the world in order to assess their potential for subsequent 
storage. 
2.3.1 
Present
A picture of the geographical distribution of the sources of 
CO2 emissions and the potential storage reservoirs helps us 
to understand the global cost of CO2 mitigation, particularly 
those components associated with CO2 transport. Geographical 
information about emission sources can be retrieved from a 
number of data sets. Table 2.4 shows the sectoral and regional 
distribution of energy-related CO2 emissions in 2000. As 
mentioned earlier in this report, over 60% of global CO2 emissions 
come from the power and industry sectors. Geographically, 
these power and industry emissions are dominated by four 
regions which account for over 90% of the emissions. These 
regions are: Asia (30%), North America (24%), the transitional 
economies (13%), and OECD West1 (12%). All the other regions 
account individually for less than 6% of the global emissions 
from the power and industry sectors. 
 
Figure 2.3 shows the known locations of stationary CO2 
sources worldwide, as taken from the database referred to in 
Section 2.2 (IEA GHG, 2002a). North America is the region 
with the largest number of stationary sources (37%), followed 
by Asia (24%) and OECD Europe2 (14%). Figure 2.3 shows 
three large clusters of stationary sources located in the central 
and eastern states of the US, in northwestern and central regions 
of Europe (Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, 
Netherlands and UK) and in Asia (eastern China and Japan with 
an additional smaller cluster in the Indian subcontinent).
 
The distribution of stationary CO2 emissions as a proportion 
of the total stationary emissions for 2000 indicates that the 
regions that are the largest emitters of CO2 from stationary 
sources are: Asia at 41% (5.6 GtCO2 yr-1), North America at 
20% (2.69 GtCO2 yr-1) and OECD Europe at 13% (1.75 GtCO2 
yr-1). All other regions emitted less than 10% of the total CO2 
emission from stationary sources in 2000. 
 
A comparison of the estimates of CO2 emissions from the 
IEA and IEA GHG databases showed that the two sets produced

IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
similar estimates for the total of global emissions but that results 
differed significantly for many countries. Regional differences 
of this kind have also been noted for other CO2 emission 
databases (Marland et al., 1999). 
2.3.2 
Future CO2 emissions and technical capture 
potentials 
The total CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion in the SRES 
scenarios provide the upper limit for potential CO2 capture for 
this assessment. In fact, the theoretical maximum is even higher 
because of the possibility of CO2 capture from biomass. These 
emissions are also included in the tables of CO2 emissions and 
they are therefore potentially available for capture. Obviously, 
the capture potential that is practical in technical terms is 
much smaller than the theoretical maximum, and the economic 
potential3 is even smaller. Needless to say, it is the economic 
potential that matters most. This section presents estimates of 
the technical potential and Chapter 8 will address the economic 
potential.
 
Table 2.5 shows the CO2 emissions by economic sector and 
major world regions for 2020 and 2050, and for six scenarios4. 
It should be noted that the total CO2 emissions in Table 2.5 are 
3 Economic potential is the amount of reductions in greenhouse gas emissions 
from a specific option that could be achieved cost-effectively given prevailing 
circumstances (i.e. a price for CO2 reductions and the costs of other options).
4 For the four marker scenarios and the technology-intensive A1T and 
the fossil-intensive A1FI illustrative scenarios, it is important to note that 
comparisons between the results of different models are not straightforward. 
First, the modelling methodologies imply different representations of energy 
technologies and their future evolutions. Secondly, the sectoral disaggregation 
and the energy/fuel details vary across the models. Thirdly, there are differences 
in how countries of the world are grouped together into regions. Tables 2.5 and 
2.6 are based on the work by Toth and Rogner (2005) that attempts to create 
the best possible approximation for the purposes of comparing the regional and 
sectoral model and scenario results.
higher than reported in SRES because emissions from biomass 
are explicitly included here (as these are potentially available 
for capture), while they where considered “climate-neutral” in 
the SRES presentations and therefore not counted as emission 
releases to the atmosphere. Geographically, the distribution of 
emission sources is set to change substantially. Between 2000 
and 2050, the bulk of emission sources will shift from the 
OECD countries to the developing regions, especially China, 
South Asia and Latin America. As to emissions by sector, power 
generation, transport, and industry will remain the three main 
sources of CO2 emissions over the next 50 years. Globally, the 
projected energy sector emissions will fluctuate around the 40% 
mark in 2050 (this matches the current figure), emissions from 
the industry sector will decline and transport sector emissions 
(i.e., mobile sources) increase. Power generation, which 
typically represent the bulk of large point sources, will account 
for about 50% of total emissions by 20505.
   These emissions form the theoretical maximum potential 
for CO2 capture from fossil fuel use. Toth and Rogner (2006) 
derived a set of capture factors on the basis of the technical or 
technological feasibility of adding CO2 capture before, during 
or after combustion of fossil fuels. Capture factors are defined as 
the estimated maximum share of emissions for which capture is 
technically plausible. A detailed assessment of the power plants 
5 As regards the share of emissions across sectors in 2020 (Table 2.5), there 
is an inherent divergence between scenarios with longer and shorter time 
horizons. Given the quasi perfect foresight of the underlying models, the SRES 
scenarios account for resource depletion over a period of a century and, due 
to the anticipated transition to higher-fuel-cost categories in the longer run, 
they shift to non-fossil energy sources much earlier than, for example, the IEA 
scenarios, especially for electricity supply. Consequently, the range for the 
shares of fossil-sourced power generation is between 43 and 58% for 2020, 
while the IEA projects a share of 71%. The corresponding sectoral shares in 
CO2 emissions mirror the electricity generating mix: the IEA projects 43% for 
power generation (IEA, 2002) compared to a range of 28 to 32% in the six 
illustrative SRES scenarios.

sources, IEA GHG 2002).

Notes:
The division of the world into large economic regions differs between the various models underlying the SRES scenarios. Tables 2.5 and 2.6 consolidate the original model regions at a 
level that makes model results comparable (although the exact geographical coverage of the regions may vary).

Chapter 2: Sources of CO2
89
currently in operation around the world and those planned 
to be built in the near future was conducted, together with a 
review of industrial boilers in selected regions. Capture factors 
were established on the basis of installed capacity, fuel type, 
unit size, and other technical parameters. Outside the energy 
and industry sectors, there are only very limited prospects for 
practical CO2 capture because sources in the residential sectors 
are small, dispersed, and often mobile, and contain only low 
concentrations. These factors result in lower capture factors.
 
In the assessment of CO2 capture, perhaps the most important 
open question is what will happen in the transport sector over 
the next few decades. If the above average increases in energy 
use for transport projected by all models in all scenarios involve 
traditional fossil-fuelled engine technologies, the capture and 
storage of transport-related CO2 will – though theoretically 
possible –remain technically meaningless (excess weight, 
on-board equipment, compression penalty, etc.). However, 
depending on the penetration rate of hydrogen-based transport 
technologies, it should be possible to retrofit CO2-emitting 
hydrogen production facilities with CO2 capture equipment. 
The transport sector provides a huge potential for indirect CO2 
capture but feasibility depends on future hydrogen production 
technologies. 
 
CO2 capture might also be technically feasible from 
biomass-fuelled power plants, biomass fermentation for alcohol 
production or units for the production of biomass-derived 
hydrogen. It is conceivable that these technologies might play a 
significant role by 2050 and produce negative emissions across 
the full technology chain.
 
The results of applying the capture factors developed by 
Toth and Rogner (2006) to the CO2 emissions of the SRES 
scenarios of Table 2.5 are presented in Table 2.6. Depending on 
the scenario, between 30 and 60% of global power generation 
emissions could be suitable for capture by 2050 and 30 to 
40% of industry emissions could also be captured in that time 
frame. 
 
The technical potentials for CO2 capture presented here are 
only the first step in the full carbon dioxide capture and storage 
chain. The variations across scenarios reflect the uncertainties 
inherently associated with scenario and modelling analyses. 
The ranges of the technical capture potential relative to total 
CO2 emissions are 9–12% (or 2.6–4.9 GtCO2) by 2020 and 21–
45% (or 4.7–37.5 GtCO2) by 2050.
2.4 
 Geographical relationship between sources and 
storage opportunities
The preceding sections in this chapter have described the 
geographical distributions of CO2 emission sources. This section 
gives an overview of the geographic distribution of potential 
storage sites that are in relative proximity to present-day sites 
with large point sources. 
2.4.1 
Global storage opportunities
Global assessments of storage opportunities for CO2 emissions 
involving large volumes of CO2 storage have focused on the 
options of geological storage or ocean storage, where CO2 is:
•� injected and trapped within geological formations at 
subsurface depths greater than 800 m where the CO2 will be 
supercritical and in a dense liquid-like form in a geological 
reservoir, or 
•� injected into deep ocean waters with the aim of dispersing 
it quickly or depositing it at great depths on the floor of the 
ocean with the aim of forming CO2 lakes. 
High-level global assessments of both geological and ocean 
storage scenarios have estimated that there is considerable 
capacity for CO2 storage (the estimates range from hundreds to 
tens of thousands of GtCO2). The estimates in the literature of 
storage capacity in geological formations and in the oceans are 
discussed in detail in Chapters 5 and 6 respectively and are not 
discussed further in this chapter. 
2.4.2 
Consideration of spatial and temporal 
relationships
As discussed in Chapter 5, the aim of geological storage is 
to replicate the natural occurrence of deep subsurface fluids, 
where they have been trapped for tens or hundreds of millions 
of years. Due to the slow migration rates of subsurface fluids 
observed in nature (often centimetres per year), and even 
including scenarios where CO2 leakage to the surface might 
unexpectedly occur, CO2 injected into the geological subsurface 
will essentially remain geographically close to the location 
where it is injected. Chapter 6 shows that CO2 injected into 
the ocean water column does not remain in a static location, 
but will migrate at relatively rapid speed throughout the ocean 
as dissolved CO2 within the prevailing circulation of ocean 
currents. So dissolved CO2 in the water column will not remain 
where it is injected in the immediate short term (i.e., a few years 
to some centuries). Deep-ocean lakes of CO2 will, in principle, 
be more static geographically but will dissolve into the water 
column over the course of a few years or centuries. 
 
These spatial and temporal characteristics of CO2 migration 
in geological and ocean storage are important criteria when 
attempting to make maps of source and storage locations. In 
both storage scenarios, the possibility of adjoining storage 
locations in the future and of any possible reciprocal impacts 
will need to be considered. 
2.4.3 
Global geographical mapping of source/storage 
locations
To appreciate the relevance of a map showing the geographic 
distribution of sources and potential storage locations, it is 
necessary to know the volumes of CO2 emissions and the storage 
capacity that might be available, and to establish a picture of 
the types and levels of technical uncertainty associated with the 
90
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
table 2.6  CO2 emissions available for capture and storage in 2020 and 2050 from sectors in major world regions under six IPCC SRES scenarios (after Toth and Rogner, 2005).

IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
storage sites that will affect their viability as potential solutions. 
As indicated above in this chapter, there are some 7,500 large 
stationary sources with emissions in excess of 0.1 MtCO2 yr-1 
and that number is projected to rise by 2050. The mapping does 
not take into account the ‘capture factors’ presented in Section 
2.3.2.
2.4.3.1 
Geological storage and source location matching
Chapter 5 includes detailed discussions of the geological 
characteristics of storage sites. Before discussing the global 
locations for geological storage opportunities, it is necessary 
to describe some basic fundamentals of geological storage. The 
world’s geological provinces can be allocated to a variety of 
rock types, but the main ones relevant to geological storage are 
sedimentary basins that have undergone only minor tectonic 
deformation and are at least 1000 m thick with adequate 
reservoir/seal pairs to allow for the injection and trapping of 
CO2. The petroleum provinces of the world are a subset of the 
sedimentary basins described above, and are considered to be 
promising locations for the geological storage of CO2 (Bradshaw 
et al., 2002). These basins have adequate reservoir/seal pairs, 
and suitable traps for hydrocarbons, whether liquids or gases. 
The remaining geological provinces of the world can generally 
be categorized as igneous (rocks formed from crystallization 
of molten liquid) and metamorphic (pre-existing rocks formed 
by chemical and physical alteration under the influence of heat, 
pressure and chemically active fluids) provinces. These rock 
types are commonly known as hard-rock provinces, and they 
will not be favourable for CO2 storage as they are generally not 
porous and permeable and will therefore not readily transmit 
fluids. More details on the suitability of sedimentary basins and 
characterization of specific sites are provided in Chapter 5.
 
Figure 2.4 shows the ‘prospectivity’(see Annex II) of 
various parts of the world for the geological storage of CO2. 
Prospectivity is a term commonly used in explorations for any 
geological resource, and in this case it applies to CO2 storage 
space. Prospectivity is a qualitative assessment of the likelihood 
that a suitable storage location is present in a given area based 
on the available information. By nature, it will change over 
time and with new information. Estimates of prospectivity 
are developed by examining data (if possible), examining 
existing knowledge, applying established conceptual models 
and, ideally, generating new conceptual models or applying an 
analogue from a neighbouring basin or some other geologically 
similar setting. The concept of prospectivity is often used when 
it is too complex or technically impossible to assign numerical 
estimates to the extent of a resource. 
 
Figure 2.4 shows the world’s geological provinces broken 
down into provinces that are thought, at a very simplistic 
level, to have CO2 storage potential that is either: 1) highly 
prospective, 2) prospective, or 3) non-prospective (Bradshaw 
and Dance, 2004). Areas of high prospectivity are considered 
to include those basins that are world-class petroleum basins, 
meaning that they are the basins of the world that are producing 
substantial volumes of hydrocarbons. It also includes areas 
that are expected to have substantial storage potential. Areas of 
prospective storage potential are basins that are minor petroleum 
basins but not world-class, as well as other sedimentary basins 
that have not been highly deformed. Some of these basins will 
be highly prospective for CO2 storage and others will have low 
prospectivity. 
 
Determining the degree of suitability of any of these 
basins for CO2 storage will depend on detailed work in each 
area. Areas that are non-prospective are highly deformed 
sedimentary basins and other geological provinces, mainly 
containing metamorphic and igneous rocks. Some of these 
Figure 2.4 Prospective areas in sedimentary basins where suitable saline formations, oil or gas fields, or coal beds may be found. Locations for 
storage in coal beds are only partly included. Prospectivity is a qualitative assessment of the likelihood that a suitable storage location is present 
in a given area based on the available information. This figure should be taken as a guide only, because it is based on partial data, the quality of 
which may vary from region to region, and which may change over time and with new information (Bradshaw and Dance, 2004).
Chapter 2: Sources of CO2

provinces might have some local niche opportunities for CO2 
storage, but at this stage they would not be considered suitable 
for a conventional form of CO2 storage. As Bradshaw and 
Dance (2004) explain, this map is subject to significant caveats 
and based on significant assumptions because of the data source 
from which it was generated. However, it can be used as a 
general (although not specific) guide at the global scale to the 
location of areas that are likely to provide opportunities for the 
geological storage of CO2. Due to the generalized manner in 
which this map has been created, and the lack of specific or 
hard data for each of the basins assessed, the ‘prospectivity’ 
levels assigned to each category have no meaningful correlative 
statistical or probabilistic connotation. To achieve a numerical 
analysis of risk or certainty would require specific information 
about each and every basin assessed. 
 
Figure 2.5 shows the overlap of the sedimentary basins 
that are prospective for CO2 storage potential with the current 
locations of large sources of stationary emissions (IEA GHG, 
2002a). The map can be simplistically interpreted to identify 
areas where large distances might be required to transport 
emissions from any given source to a geological storage 
location. It clearly shows areas with local geological storage 
potential and low numbers of emission sites (for example, 
South America) as well as areas with high numbers of emission 
sites and few geological storage options in the vicinity (the 
Indian sub-continent, for example). This map, however, does 
not address the relative capacity of any of the given sites to 
match either large emission sources or small storage capacities. 
Neither does it address any of the technical uncertainties that 
could exist at any of the storage sites, or the cost implications 
for the emission sources of the nature of the emission plant 
or the purity of the emission sources. Such issues of detailed 
source-to-store matching are dealt with in Chapter 5. 
 
Figures 2.6, 2.7 and 2.8 show the regional emission clusters 
for twelve regions of the world and the available storage 
opportunities within each region. They also compare the relative 
ranking of the area of available prospective sedimentary basins 
in a 300 km radius around emission clusters (Bradshaw and 
Dance, 2004). The 300 km radius was selected because it was 
considered useful as an indicator of likely transport distances 
for potentially viable source-to-storage matches (see Chapter 5). 
Although this data could suggest trends, such as high emissions 
for China with a small area of prospective sedimentary basins, 
or a large area of prospective sedimentary basins with low 
emissions for the Middle East, it is premature to make too many 
assumptions until detailed assessments are made in each region 
as to the quality and viability of each sedimentary basin and 
specific proposed sites. Each basin will have its own technical 
peculiarities, and because the science of injection and storage of 
very large volumes of CO2 is still developing, it is premature at 
this stage to make any substantive comments about the viability 
of individual sedimentary basins unless there are detailed 
data sets and assessments (see Chapter 5). These maps do, 
however, indicate where such detailed geological assessments 
will be required – China and India, for example – before a 
comprehensive assessment can be made of the likely worldwide 
impact of the geological storage of CO2. These maps also show 
that CO2 storage space is a resource, just like any other resource; 
some regions will have many favourable opportunities, and 
others will not be so well-endowed (Bradshaw and Dance, 
2004). 
 
Figure 2.9 shows those emission sources with high 
concentrations (>95%) of CO2, with their proximity to 
prospective geological storage sites. Clusters of high-
concentration sources can be observed in China and North 
America and to lesser extent in Europe. 
Figure 2.5 Geographical relationship between CO2 emission sources and prospective geological storage sites. The dots indicate CO2 emission 
sources of 0.1–50 MtCO2 yr-1. Prospectivity is a qualitative assessment of the likelihood that a suitable storage location is present in a given 
area based on the available information. This figure should be taken as a guide only, because it is based on partial data, the quality of which 
may vary from region to region, and which may change over time and with new information.

2.4.3.2 Ocean storage and source-location matching
Due to a lack of publicly available literature, a review of the 
proximity of large CO2 point sources and their geographical 
relationship to ocean storage opportunities on the global scale 
could not be undertaken. A related study was undertaken that 
analysed seawater scrubbing of CO2 from power stations along 
the coastlines of the world. The study considered the number 
of large stationary sources (in this case, power generation 
plants) on the coastlines of the worldwide that are located 
within 100 km of the 1500 m ocean floor contour (IEA GHG, 
2000a). Eighty-nine potential power generation sources were 
identified that were close to these deep-water locations. This 
number represents only a small proportion (< 2%) of the total 
number of large stationary sources in the power generation

sector worldwide (see Section 2.1). A larger proportion of 
power plants could possibly turn to deep-ocean storage because 
transport over distances larger than 100 km may prove cost-
effective in some cases; nevertheless, this study indicates that a 
higher fraction of large stationary sources could be more cost-
effectively matched to geological storage reservoirs than ocean 
storage sites. There are many issues that will also need to be 
addressed when considering deep-ocean storage sites, including 
jurisdictional boundaries, site suitability, and environmental 
impact etc., which are discussed in Chapter 6. The spatial and 
temporal nature of ocean water-column injection may affect the 
approach to source and storage matching, as the CO2 will not 
remain adjacent to the local region where the CO2 is injected, 
and conceivably might migrate across jurisdictional boundaries 
and into sensitive environmental provinces.
2.5 
 Alternative energy carriers and CO2 source 
implications
As discussed earlier in this chapter, a significant fraction of 
the world’s CO2 emissions comes from transport, residences, 
and other small, distributed combustion sources. Whilst it is

98
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
currently not economically feasible to capture and store CO2 
from these small, distributed sources, these emissions could be 
reduced if the fossil fuels used in these units were replaced with 
either:
•� carbon-free energy carriers (e.g. electricity or hydrogen);
•� energy carriers that are less carbon-intensive than 
conventional hydrocarbon fuels (e.g., methanol, Fischer-
Tropsch liquids or dimethyl ether);
•� biomass energy that can either be used directly or to 
produce energy carriers like bioethanol. If the biomass is 
grown sustainably the energy produced can be considered 
carbon-neutral. 
In the first two cases, the alternative energy carriers can be 
produced in centralized plants that incorporate CO2 capture and 
storage. In the case of biomass, CO2 capture and storage can also 
be incorporated into the energy carrier production schemes. The 
aim of this section is to explore the implications that introducing 
such alternative energy carriers and energy sources might have 
for future large point sources of CO2 emissions. 
2.5.1 
Carbon-free energy carriers 
2.5.1.1 
Electricity
The long-term trend has been towards the electrification of the 
energy economy, and this trend is expected to continue (IPCC, 
2000). To the extent that expanded electricity use is a substitute 
for the direct use of fossil fuels (e.g., in transport, or for cooking 
or heating applications in households), the result can be less CO2 
emissions if the electricity is from carbon-free primary energy 
sources (renewable or nuclear) or from distributed generators 
such as fuel cells powered by hydrogen produced with near-
zero fuel-cycle-wide emissions or from large fossil-fuel power 
plants at which CO2 is captured and stored. 
 
While, in principle, all energy could be provided by 
electricity, most energy projections envision that the direct use 
of fuels will be preferred for many applications (IPCC, 2000). In 
transport, for example, despite intensive developmental efforts, 
battery-powered electric vehicles have not evolved beyond 
niche markets because the challenges of high cost, heavy weight, 
and long recharging times have not been overcome. Whilst the 
prospects of current hybrid electric vehicles (which combine 
fossil fuel and electric batteries) penetrating mass markets seem 
good, these vehicles do not require charging from centralized 
electrical grids. The successful development of ‘plug-in hybrids’ 
might lead to an expanded role for electricity in transport but 
such vehicles would still require fuel as well as grid electricity. 
In summary, it is expected that, although electricity’s share of 
total energy might continue to grow, most growth in large point 
sources of CO2 emissions will be the result of increased primary 
energy demand. 
2.5.1.2 
Hydrogen
If hydrogen can be successfully established in the market as 
an energy carrier, a consequence could be the emergence 
of large new concentrated sources of CO2 if the hydrogen 
is manufactured from fossil fuels in large pre-combustion 
decarbonization plants with CO2 capture and storage. Such 
plants produce a high concentration source of CO2 (see Chapter 
3 for details on system design). Where fossil fuel costs are low 
and CO2 capture and storage is feasible, hydrogen manufactured 
in this way is likely to be less costly than hydrogen produced 
from renewable or nuclear primary energy sources (Williams, 
2003; NRC, 2004). It should be noted that this technology 
can be utilized only if production sites are within a couple of 
hundred kilometres of where the hydrogen will be used, since 
cost-effective, long-distance hydrogen transport represents 
a significant challenge. Producing hydrogen from fossil 
fuels could be a step in technological development towards 
a hydrogen economy based on carbon-free primary energy 
sources through the establishment of a hydrogen utilization 
infrastructure (Simbeck, 2003). 
 
Energy market applications for hydrogen include its 
conversion to electricity electrochemically (in fuel cells) and 
in combustion applications. Substituting hydrogen for fossil 
fuel burning eliminates CO2 emissions at the point of energy 
use. Much of the interest in hydrogen market development 
has focused on distributed stationary applications in buildings 
and on transport. Fuel cells are one option for use in stationary 
distributed energy systems at scales as small as apartment 
buildings and even single-family residences (Lloyd, 1999). 
In building applications, hydrogen could also be combusted 
for heating and cooking (Ogden and Williams, 1989). In the 
transport sector, the hydrogen fuel cell car is the focus of 
intense development activity, with commercialization targeted 
for the middle of the next decade by several major automobile 
manufacturers (Burns et al., 2002). The main technological 
obstacles to the widespread use of fuel cell vehicles are the 
current high costs of the vehicles themselves and the bulkiness 
of compressed gaseous hydrogen storage (the only fully proven 
hydrogen storage technology), which restricts the range between 
refuelling (NRC, 2004). However, the currently achievable 
ranges might be acceptable to many consumers, even without 
storage technology breakthroughs (Ogden et al., 2004). 
 
Hydrogen might also be used in internal combustion engine 
vehicles before fuel cell vehicles become available (Owen 
and Gordon, 2002), although efficiencies are likely to be less 
than with fuel cells. In this case, the range between refuelling 
would also be less than for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles with the 
same performance (Ogden et al., 2004). For power generation 
applications, gas turbines originally designed for natural gas 
operation can be re-engineered to operate on hydrogen (Chiesa 
et al., 2003). 
 
Currently, there are a number of obstacles on the path to a 
hydrogen economy. They are: the absence of cost-competitive 
fuel cells and other hydrogen equipment and the absence of 
an infrastructure for getting hydrogen to consumers. These 
challenges are being addressed in many hydrogen R&D 
programmes and policy studies being carried out around the 
world (Sperling and Cannon, 2004). There are also safety 
concerns because, compared to other fuels, hydrogen has a 
wide flammability and detonation range, low ignition energy, 
Chapter 2: Sources of CO2
99
and high flame speed. However, industrial experience shows 
that hydrogen can be manufactured and used safely in many 
applications (NRC, 2004).
 
There is widespread industrial experience with the production 
and distribution of hydrogen, mainly for the synthesis of 
ammonia fertilizer and hydro-treatment in oil refineries. Current 
global hydrogen production is 45 million t yr-1, the equivalent 
to 1.4% of global primary energy use in 2000 (Simbeck, 2003). 
Forty-eight per cent is produced from natural gas, 30% from 
oil, 18% from coal, and 4% via electrolysis of water. Ammonia 
production, which consumes about 100,000 MWt of hydrogen, 
is growing by 2–4% per year. Oil refinery demand for hydrogen 
is also increasing, largely because of the ongoing shift to 
heavier crude oils and regulations limiting the sulphur content 
of transport fuels. Most hydrogen is currently manufactured 
via steam methane reforming (SMR), steam reforming of 
naphtha, and the gasification of petroleum residues and coal. 
The SMR option is generally favoured due to its lower capital 
cost wherever natural gas is available at reasonable prices. 
Nevertheless, there are currently about 75 modern commercial 
gasification plants making about 20,000 MWt of hydrogen 
from coal and oil refinery residues (NETL-DOE, 2002); these 
are mostly ammonia fertilizer plants and hydrogen plants in 
oil refineries in China, Europe, and North America. There are 
currently over 16,000 km of hydrogen pipelines around the 
world. Most are relatively short and located in industrial areas 
for large customers who make chemicals, reduce metals, and 
engage in the hydro-treatment of oil at refineries. The longest 
pipeline currently in operation is 400 km long and is located in 
a densely populated area of Europe, running from Antwerp to 
northern France. The pipeline operates at a pressure of about 60 
atmospheres (Simbeck, 2004).
 
Fossil fuel plants producing hydrogen with CO2 capture 
and storage would typically be large, producing volumes 
of the order of 1000 MWt (720 t day-1)6 in order to keep the 
hydrogen costs and CO2 storage costs low. Per kg of hydrogen, 
the co-production rate would be about 8 kgCO2 with SMR and  
15 kgCO2 with coal gasification, so that the CO2 storage rates 
(for plants operated at 80% average capacity factor) would be 
1.7 and 3.1 million tonnes per year for SMR and coal gasification 
plants respectively.
 
Making hydrogen from fossil fuels with CO2 capture and 
storage in a relatively small number of large plants for use in 
large numbers of mobile and stationary distributed applications 
could lead to major reductions in fuel-cycle-wide emissions 
compared to petroleum-based energy systems. This takes into 
account all fossil fuel energy inputs, including energy for 
petroleum refining and hydrogen compression at refuelling 
stations (NRC, 2004; Ogden et al., 2004). No estimates have yet 
been made of the number of large stationary, concentrated CO2 
sources that could be generated via such hydrogen production 
systems and their geographical distribution. 
6  A plant of this kind operating at 80% capacity could support 2 million 
hydrogen fuel cell cars with a gasoline-equivalent fuel economy of 2.9 L per 
100 km driving 14,000 km per year.
2.5.2 
Alternative energy carriers and CO2 source 
implications
Interest in synthetic liquid fuels stems from concerns about both 
the security of oil supplies (TFEST, 2004) and the expectation 
that it could possibly be decades before hydrogen can make a 
major contribution to the energy economy (NRC, 2004).
 
There is considerable activity worldwide relating to the 
manufacture of Fischer-Tropsch liquids from stranded natural 
gas supplies. The first major gas to liquids plant, producing 
12,500 barrels per day, was built in Malaysia in 1993. Several 
projects are underway to make Fischer-Tropsch liquid fuels 
from natural gas in Qatar at plant capacities ranging from 30,000 
to 140,000 barrels per day. Although gas to liquids projects do 
not typically produce concentrated by-product streams of CO2, 
synthetic fuel projects using synthesis gas derived from coal (or 
other solid feedstocks such as biomass or petroleum residuals) 
via gasification could produce large streams of concentrated 
CO2 that are good candidates for capture and storage. At Sasol in 
South Africa, coal containing some 20 million tonnes of carbon 
is consumed annually in the manufacture of synthetic fuels and 
chemicals. About 32% of the carbon ends up in the products, 
40% is vented as CO2 in dilute streams, and 28% is released 
as nearly pure CO2 at a rate of about 20 million tonnes of CO2 
per year. In addition, since 2000, 1.5 million tonnes per year of 
CO2 by-product from synthetic methane production at a coal 
gasification plant in North Dakota (United States) have been 
captured and transported 300 km by pipeline to the Weyburn oil 
field in Saskatchewan (Canada), where it is used for enhanced oil 
recovery (see Chapter 5 for more details). Coal-based synthetic 
fuel plants being planned or considered in China include six 
600,000 t yr-1 methanol plants, two 800,000 t yr-1 dimethyl ether 
plants, and two or more large Fischer-Tropsch liquids plants7. 
In the United States, the Department of Energy is supporting a 
demonstration project in Pennsylvania to make 5,000 barrels/
day of Fischer-Tropsch liquids plus 41 MWe of electricity from 
low-quality coal. 
 
If synthesis-gas-based energy systems become established 
in the market, economic considerations are likely to lead, as in 
the case of hydrogen production, to the construction of large 
facilities that would generate huge, relatively pure, CO2 co-
product streams. Polygeneration plants, for example plants 
that could produce synthetic liquid fuels plus electricity, 
would benefit as a result of economies of scale, economies of 
scope, and opportunities afforded by greater system operating 
flexibility (Williams et al., 2000; Bechtel et al., 2003; Larson 
and Ren, 2003; Celik et al., 2005). In such plants, CO2 could be 
captured from shifted synthesis gas streams both upstream and 
downstream of the synthesis reactor where the synthetic fuel is 
produced. 
 
With CO2 capture and storage, the fuel-cycle-wide 
greenhouse gas emissions per GJ for coal derived synthetic 
7  Most of the methanol would be used for making chemicals and for subsequent 
conversion to dimethyl ether, although some methanol will be used for 
transport fuel. The dimethyl ether would be used mainly as a cooking fuel.  
100
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
fuels can sometimes be less than for crude oil-derived fuels. For 
example, a study of dimethyl ether manufacture from coal with 
CO2 capture and storage found that fuel-cycle-wide greenhouse 
gas emissions per GJ ranged from 75 to 97% of the emission 
rate for diesel derived from crude oil, depending on the extent 
of CO2 capture (Celik et al., 2005). 
 
The CO2 source implications of making synthetic low-
carbon liquid energy carriers with CO2 capture and storage are 
similar to those for making hydrogen from fossil fuels: large 
quantities of concentrated CO2 would be available for capture 
at point sources. Again, no estimates have yet been made of the 
number of large stationary sources that could be generated or of 
their geographical distribution. 
2.5.3 
CO2 source implications of biomass energy 
production 
There is considerable interest in some regions of the world in 
the use of biomass to produce energy, either in dedicated plants 
or in combination with fossil fuels. One set of options with 
potentially significant but currently uncertain implications for 
future CO2 sources is bioenergy with CO2 capture and storage. 
Such systems could potentially achieve negative CO2 emissions. 
The perceived CO2 emission benefits and costs of such systems 
are discussed elsewhere in this report (see Chapters 3 and 8) 
and are not discussed further here. The aim of this section is 
to assess the current scale of emissions from biomass energy 
production, to consider how they might vary in the future, and 
therefore to consider their impact on the future number, and 
scale, of CO2 emission sources. 
2.5.3.1 
Bioethanol production
Bioethanol is the main biofuel being produced today. Currently, 
the two largest producers of bioethanol are the USA and Brazil. 
The USA produced 11 billion litres in 2003, nearly double the 
capacity in 1995. Production is expected to continue to rise 
because of government incentives. Brazilian production was 
over 14 billion litres per year in 2003/2004, similar to the level 
in 1997/1998 (Möllersten et al., 2003). Bioethanol is used 
directly in internal combustion engines, without modification, 
as a partial replacement for petroleum-based fuels (the level of 
replacement in Europe and the USA is 5 to 10%). 
 
Bioethanol plants are a high-concentration source of CO2 
at atmospheric pressure that can be captured and subsequently 
stored. As can be seen in Table 2.3, the numbers of these 
plants are significant in the context of high-purity sources, 
although their global distribution is restricted. These sources 
are comparable in size to those from ethylene oxide plants but 
smaller than those from ammonia plants. 
 
Although the trend in manufacture is towards larger 
production facilities, the scale of future production will 
be determined by issues such as improvements in biomass 
production and conversion technologies, competition with 
other land use, water demand, markets for by-product streams 
and competition with other transport fuels. 
 
On the basis of the literature currently available, it is not 
possible to estimate the number of bioethanol plants that will 
be built in the future or the likely size of their CO2 emissions. 
2.5.3.2 
Biomass as a primary energy source
A key issue posed by biomass energy production, both with 
and without CO2 capture and storage, is that of size. Current 
biomass energy production plants are much smaller than fossil 
fuel power plants; typical plant capacities are about 30 MWe, 
with CO2 emissions of less than 0.2 MtCO2 per year. The size of 
these biomass energy production plants reflects the availability 
and dispersed nature of current biomass supplies, which are 
mainly crop and forestry residues. 
 
The prospects for biomass energy production with CO2 
capture and storage might be improved in the future if economies 
of scale in energy production and/or CO2 capture and storage 
can be realized. If, for instance, a CO2 pipeline network is 
established in a country or region, then small CO2 emission 
sources (including those from biomass energy plants) could be 
added to any nearby CO2 pipelines if it is economically viable to 
do so. A second possibility is that existing large fossil fuel plants 
with CO2 capture and storage represent an opportunity for the 
co-processing of biomass. Co-processing biomass at coal power 
plants already takes place in a number of countries. However, 
it must be noted that if biomass is co-processed with a fossil 
fuel, these plants do not represent new large-scale emissions 
sources. A third possibility is to build larger biomass energy 
production plants than the plants typically in place at present. 
Larger biomass energy production plants have been built or are 
being planned in a number of countries, typically those with 
extensive biomass resources. For example, Sweden already has 
seven combined heat and power plants using biomass at pulp 
mills, with each plant producing around 130 MWe equivalent. 
The size of biomass energy production plants depends on local 
circumstances, in particular the availability of concentrated 
biomass sources; pulp mills and sugar processing plants offer 
concentrated sources of this kind. 
 
Larger plants could also be favoured if there were a shift 
from the utilization of biomass residues to dedicated energy 
crops. Several studies have assessed the likely size of future 
biomass energy production plants, but these studies conflict 
when it comes to the scale issue. One study, cited in Audus and 
Freund (2004), surveyed 28 favoured sites using woody biomass 
crops in Spain and concluded that the average appropriate scale 
would be in the range 30 to 70 MWe. This figure is based on the 
fact that transport distances longer than the assumed maximum 
of 40 km would render larger plants uneconomic. In contrast, 
another study based on dedicated energy crops in Brazil and 
the United States estimated that economies of scale outweigh 
the extra costs of transporting biomass over long distances. 
This study found that plant capacities of hundreds of MWe were 
feasible (Marrison and Larson, 1995). Other studies have come 
up with similar findings (Dornburg and Faaij, 2001; Hamelinck 
and Faaij, 2002). A recent study analyzed a variety of options 
including both electricity and synthetic fuel production and 
indicated that large plants processing about 1000 MWth of 
biomass would tend to be preferred for dedicated energy crops 
Chapter 2: Sources of CO2
101
in the United States (Greene et al., 2004). 
 
The size of future emission sources from bioenergy options 
depends to a large degree on local circumstances and the extent 
to which economic forces and/or public policies will encourage 
the development of dedicated energy crops. The projections of 
annual global biomass energy use rise from 12–60 EJ by 2020, 
to 70–190 EJ per year by 2050, and to 120–380 EJ by 2100 in 
the SRES Marker Scenarios (IPCC, 2000), showing that many 
global energy modellers expect that dedicated energy crops 
may well become more and more important during the course 
of this century. So if bioenergy systems prove to be viable at 
scales suitable for CO2 capture and storage, then the negative 
emissions potential of biomass (see Chapter 8) might, during 
the course of this century, become globally important. However, 
it is currently unclear to what extent it will be feasible to exploit 
this potential, both because of the uncertainties about the scale 
of bioenergy conversion and the extent to which dedicated 
biomass energy crops will play a role in the energy economy of 
the future.
 
In summary, based on the available literature, it is not 
possible at this stage to make reliable quantitative statements on 
number of biomass energy production plants that will be built in 
the future or the likely size of their CO2 emissions. 
2.6 
Gaps in knowledge
Whilst it is possible to determine emission source data for the 
year 2000 (CO2 concentration and point source geographical 
location) with a reasonable degree of accuracy for most 
industrial sectors, it is more difficult to predict the future location 
of emission point sources. Whilst all projections indicate 
there will be an increase in CO2 emissions, determining the 
actual locations for new plants currently remains a subjective 
business. 
 
A detailed description of the storage capacity for the 
world’s sedimentary basins is required. Although capacity 
estimates have been made, they do not yet constitute a full 
resource assessment. Such information is essential to establish 
a better picture of the existing opportunities for storing the CO2 
generated at large point sources. At present, only a simplistic 
assessment is possible based on the limited data about the 
storage capacity currently available in sedimentary basins.
 
An analysis of the storage potential in the ocean for 
emissions from large point sources was not possible because 
detailed mapping indicating the relationship between storage 
locations in the oceans and point source emissions has not yet 
been carefully assessed.
 
This chapter highlights the fact that fossil fuel-based 
hydrogen production from large centralized plants will 
potentially result in the generation of more high-concentration 
emission sources. However, it is not currently possible to 
predict with any accuracy the number of these point sources 
in the future, or when they will be established, because of 
market development uncertainties surrounding hydrogen as 
an energy carrier. For example, before high-concentration CO2 
sources associated with hydrogen production for energy can 
be exploited, cost-effective end-use technologies for hydrogen 
(e.g., low-temperature fuel cells) must be readily available on 
the market. In addition, it is expected that it will take decades 
to build a hydrogen infrastructure that will bring the hydrogen 
from large centralized sources (where CCS is practical) to 
consumers. 
 
Synthetic liquid fuels production or the co-production of 
liquid fuels and electricity via the gasification of coal or other 
solid feedstocks or petroleum residuals can also lead to the 
generation of concentrated streams of CO2. It is unclear at the 
present time to what extent such synthetic fuels will be produced 
as alternatives to crude-oil-derived hydrocarbon fuels. The co-
production options, which seem especially promising, require 
market reforms that make it possible to co-produce electricity 
at a competitive market price.
 
During the course of this century, biomass energy systems 
might become significant new large CO2 sources, but this 
depends on the extent to which bioenergy conversion will take 
place in large plants, and the global significance of this option 
may well depend critically on the extent to which dedicated 
energy crops are pursued.

Chapter 3: Capture of CO2
107
ExECutivE SummARy
The purpose of CO2 capture is to produce a concentrated stream 
that can be readily transported to a CO2 storage site. CO2 capture 
and storage is most applicable to large, centralized sources 
like power plants and large industries. Capture technologies 
also open the way for large-scale production of low-carbon or 
carbon-free electricity and fuels for transportation, as well as 
for small-scale or distributed applications. The energy required 
to operate CO2�capture�systems�reduces�the�overall�efficiency�of�
power generation or other processes, leading to increased fuel 
requirements, solid wastes and environmental impacts relative 
to the same type of base plant without capture. However, as 
more�efficient�plants�with�capture�become�available�and�replace�
many� of� the� older� less� efficient� plants� now� in� service,� the�
net impacts will be compatible with clean air emission goals 
for fossil fuel use. Minimization of energy requirements for 
capture,�together�with�improvements�in�the�efficiency�of�energy�
conversion processes will continue to be high priorities for 
future technology development in order to minimize overall 
environmental impacts and cost.
 
At present, CO2 is routinely separated at some large 
industrial plants such as natural gas processing and ammonia 
production facilities, although these plants remove CO2 to 
meet process demands and not for storage. CO2 capture also 
has been applied to several small power plants. However, 
there have been no applications at large-scale power plants of 
several hundred megawatts, the major source of current and 
projected CO2 emissions. There are three main approaches to 
CO2 capture, for industrial and power plant applications. Post-
combustion systems separate CO2�from�the�flue�gases�produced�
by combustion of a primary fuel (coal, natural gas, oil or 
biomass) in air. Oxy-fuel combustion uses oxygen instead of 
air�for�combustion,�producing�a�flue�gas�that�is�mainly�H2O and 
CO2 and which is readily captured. This is an option still under 
development. Pre-combustion systems process the primary fuel 
in a reactor to produce separate streams of CO2 for storage and 
H2 which is used as a fuel. Other industrial processes, including 
processes for the production of low-carbon or carbon-free fuels, 
employ one or more of these same basic capture methods. The 
monitoring, risk and legal aspects associated with CO2 capture 
systems appear to present no new challenges, as they are all 
elements of long-standing health, safety and environmental 
control practice in industry.
 
For all of the aforementioned applications, we reviewed 
recent studies of the performance and cost of commercial or 
near-commercial technologies, as well as that of newer CO2 
capture concepts that are the subject of intense R&D efforts 
worldwide. For power plants, current commercial CO2 capture 
systems can reduce CO2 emissions by 80-90% kWh-1 (85-
95%� capture� efficiency).� Across� all� plant� types� the� cost� of�
electricity production (COE) increases by 12-36 US$ MWh-1 
(US$ 0.012-0.036 kWh-1) over a similar type of plant without 
capture, corresponding to a 40-85% increase for a supercritical 
pulverized coal (PC) plant, 35-70% for a natural gas combined 
cycle�(NGCC)�plant�and�20-55%�for�an�integrated�gasification�
combined cycle (IGCC) plant using bituminous coal. Overall 
the COE for fossil fuel plants with capture, ranges from 43-86 
US$ MWh-1, with the cost per tonne of CO2 ranging from 11-
57 US$/tCO2 captured or 13-74 US$/tCO2 avoided (depending 
on plant type, size, fuel type and a host of other factors). These 
costs include CO2 compression but not additional transport 
and storage costs. NGCC systems typically have a lower COE 
than new PC and IGCC plants (with or without capture) for 
gas prices below about 4 US$ GJ-1. Most studies indicate that 
IGCC plants are slightly more costly without capture and 
slightly less costly with capture than similarly sized PC plants, 
but the differences in cost for plants with CO2 capture can vary 
with coal type and other local factors. The lowest CO2 capture 
costs (averaging about 12 US$/t CO2 captured or 15 US$/tCO2 
avoided) were found for industrial processes such as hydrogen 
production plants that produce concentrated CO2 streams as part 
of the current production process; such industrial processes may 
represent some of the earliest opportunities for CO2 Capture 
and Storage (CCS). In all cases, CO2 capture costs are highly 
dependent� upon� technical,� economic� and� financial� factors�
related to the design and operation of the production process 
or power system of interest, as well as the design and operation 
of the CO2 capture technology employed. Thus, comparisons 
of alternative technologies, or the use of CCS cost estimates, 
require�a�specific�context�to�be�meaningful.
 
New or improved methods of CO2 capture, combined with 
advanced power systems and industrial process designs, can 
significantly�reduce�CO2 capture costs and associated energy 
requirements. While there is considerable uncertainty about the 
magnitude and timing of future cost reductions, this assessment 
suggests that improvements to commercial technologies can 
reduce CO2 capture costs by at least 20-30% over approximately 
the next decade, while new technologies under development 
promise more substantial cost reductions. Realization of future 
cost reductions, however, will require deployment and adoption 
of commercial technologies in the marketplace as well as 
sustained R&D.

3.1 
 introduction
3.1.1 
The basis for CO2 capture
The main application of CO2 capture is likely to be at large 
point sources: fossil fuel power plants, fuel processing plants 
and other industrial plants, particularly for the manufacture of 
iron, steel, cement and bulk chemicals, as discussed in Chapter 
2. 
 
Capturing CO2 directly from small and mobile sources in the 
transportation and residential & commercial building sectors is 
expected�to�be�more�difficult�and�expensive�than�from�large�point�
sources. Small-scale capture is therefore not further discussed 
in this chapter. An alternative way of avoiding emissions of 
CO2 from these sources would be by use of energy carriers such 
as hydrogen or electricity produced in large fossil fuel-based 
plants with CO2 capture or by using renewable energy sources. 
Production of hydrogen with CO2 capture is included in this 
chapter.
 
The possibility of CO2 capture from ambient air (Lackner, 
2003) is not discussed in this chapter because the CO2 
concentration in ambient air is around 380 ppm, a factor 
of� 100� or� more� lower� than� in� flue� gas.� Capturing� CO2 from 
air by the growth of biomass and its use in industrial plants 
with CO2 capture is more cost-effective based on foreseeable 
technologies, and is included in this chapter. 
 
In an analysis of possible future scenarios for anthropogenic 
greenhouse-gas emissions it is implicit that technological 
innovations will be one of the key factors which determines 
our future path (Section 2.5.3). Therefore this chapter deals not 
only with application of existing technology for CO2 capture, 
but describes many new processes under development which 
may result in lower CO2 capture costs in future.
3.1.2 
CO2 capture systems
There are four basic systems for capturing CO2 from use of 
fossil fuels and/or biomass:
• 
Capture from industrial process streams (described in 
Section 3.2);
• 
Post-combustion capture (described in Section 3.3);
• 
Oxy-fuel combustion capture (described in Section 3.4); 
• 
Pre-combustion capture (described in Section 3.5).
These�systems�are�shown�in�simplified�form�in�Figure�3.1.�
3.1.2.1 
 Capture from industrial process streams
CO2 has been captured from industrial process streams for 
80 years (Kohl and Nielsen, 1997), although most of the CO2 
that is captured is vented to the atmosphere because there is 
no incentive or requirement to store it. Current examples of 
CO2�capture�from�process�streams�are�purification�of�natural�
gas and production of hydrogen-containing synthesis gas for 
the manufacture of ammonia, alcohols and synthetic liquid 
fuels. Most of the techniques employed for CO2 capture in 
the examples mentioned are also similar to those used in pre-
combustion capture. Other industrial process streams which 
are a source of CO2 that is not captured include cement and 
steel production, and fermentation processes for food and drink 
production. CO2 could be captured from these streams using 
Figure 3.1 CO2 capture systems (adapted from BP).
Chapter 3: Capture of CO2
109
techniques that are common to post-combustion capture, oxy-
fuel combustion capture and pre-combustion capture (see below 
and Section 3.2).
3.1.2.2 
Post-combustion capture
Capture of CO2� from� flue� gases� produced� by� combustion� of�
fossil fuels and biomass in air is referred to as post-combustion 
capture. Instead of being discharged directly to the atmosphere, 
flue�gas�is�passed�through�equipment�which�separates�most�of�
the CO2. The CO2 is fed to a storage reservoir and the remaining 
flue�gas�is�discharged�to�the�atmosphere.�A�chemical�sorbent�
process as described in Section 3.1.3.1 would normally be used 
for CO2 separation. Other techniques are also being considered 
but these are not at such an advanced stage of development. 
 
Besides industrial applications, the main systems of 
reference for post-combustion capture are the current installed 
capacity of 2261 GWe of oil, coal and natural gas power plants 
(IEA WEO, 2004) and in particular, 155 GWe of supercritical 
pulverized�coal�fired�plants�(IEA�CCC,�2005)�and�339�GWe of 
natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) plants, both representing 
the�types�of�high�efficiency�power�plant�technology�where�CO2 
capture can be best applied (see Sections 3.3 and 3.7).
3.1.2.3 
Oxy-fuel combustion capture
In oxy-fuel combustion, nearly pure oxygen is used for 
combustion�instead�of�air,�resulting�in�a�flue�gas�that�is�mainly�
CO2 and H2O.� If� fuel� is� burnt� in� pure� oxygen,� the� flame�
temperature is excessively high, but CO2 and/or H2O-rich 
flue� gas� can� be� recycled� to� the� combustor� to� moderate� this.�
Oxygen is usually produced by low temperature (cryogenic) 
air separation and novel techniques to supply oxygen to the 
fuel, such as membranes and chemical looping cycles are being 
developed. The power plant systems of reference for oxy-fuel 
combustion capture systems are the same as those noted above 
for post-combustion capture systems. 
3.1.2.4 
Pre-combustion capture
Pre-combustion capture involves reacting a fuel with oxygen 
or air and/or steam to give mainly a ‘synthesis gas (syngas)’ or 
‘fuel gas’ composed of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The 
carbon monoxide is reacted with steam in a catalytic reactor, 
called a shift converter, to give CO2 and more hydrogen. CO2 
is then separated, usually by a physical or chemical absorption 
process, resulting in a hydrogen-rich fuel which can be used 
in many applications, such as boilers, furnaces, gas turbines, 
engines and fuel cells. These systems are considered to be 
strategically important (see Section 3.5) but the power plant 
systems of reference today are 4 GWe of both oil and coal-based, 
integrated� gasification� combined� cycles� (IGCC)� which� are�
around 0.1% of total installed capacity worldwide (3719 GWe; 
IEA WEO, 2004). Other reference systems for the application 
of pre-combustion capture include substantially more capacity 
than�that�identified�above�for�IGCC�in�existing�natural�gas,�oil�
and coal-based syngas/hydrogen production facilities and other 
types of industrial systems described in more detail in Sections 
3.2 and 3.5. 
3.1.3 
Types of CO2 capture technologies
CO2 capture systems use many of the known technologies for 
gas separation which are integrated into the basic systems for 
CO2�capture�identified�in�the�last�section.�A�summary�of�these�
separation methods is given below while further details are 
available in standard textbooks.
3.1.3.1 
Separation with sorbents/solvents
The separation is achieved by passing the CO2-containing gas 
in intimate contact with a liquid absorbent or solid sorbent that 
is capable of capturing the CO2. In the general scheme of Figure 
3.2a, the sorbent loaded with the captured CO2 is transported to 
a different vessel, where it releases the CO2 (regeneration) after 
being heated, after a pressure decrease or after any other change 
in the conditions around the sorbent. The sorbent resulting after 
the regeneration step is sent back to capture more CO2 in a cyclic 
process. In some variants of this scheme the sorbent is a solid 
and does not circulate between vessels because the sorption 
and regeneration are achieved by cyclic changes (in pressure 
or temperature) in the vessel where the sorbent is contained. A 
make-up�flow�of�fresh�sorbent�is�always�required�to�compensate�
for the natural decay of activity and/or sorbent losses. In some 
situations, the sorbent may be a solid oxide which reacts in a 
vessel with fossil fuel or biomass producing heat and mainly 
CO2 (see Section 3.4.6). The spent sorbent is then circulated to a 
second vessel where it is re-oxidized in air for reuse with some 
loss and make up of fresh sorbent.
 
The general scheme of Figure 3.2 governs many important 
CO2 capture systems, including leading commercial options like 
chemical absorption and physical absorption and adsorption. 
Other emerging processes based on new liquid sorbents, or 
new solid regenerable sorbents are being developed with the 
aim of overcoming the limitations of the existing systems. 
One common problem of these CO2 capture systems is that 
the�flow�of�sorbent�between�the�vessels�of�Figure�3.2a�is�large�
because�it�has�to�match�the�huge�flow�of�CO2 being processed 
in the power plant. Therefore, equipment sizes and the energy 
required for sorbent regeneration are large and tend to translate 
into�an�important�efficiency�penalty�and�added�cost.�Also,�in�
systems using expensive sorbent materials there is always a 
danger of escalating cost related to the purchase of the sorbent 
and the disposal of sorbent residues. Good sorbent performance 
under high CO2 loading in many repetitive cycles is obviously 
a necessary condition in these CO2 capture systems.
3.1.3.2 
Separation with membranes
Membranes (Figure 3.2b) are specially manufactured materials 
that allow the selective permeation of a gas through them. The 
selectivity of the membrane to different gases is intimately 
related�to�the�nature�of�the�material,�but�the�flow�of�gas�through�
the membrane is usually driven by the pressure difference 
across the membrane. Therefore, high-pressure streams are 
usually preferred for membrane separation. There are many 
different types of membrane materials (polymeric, metallic, 
ceramic)�that�may�find�application�in�CO2 capture systems to 
110
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
preferentially separate H2 from a fuel gas stream, CO2 from a 
range of process streams or O2 from air with the separated O2 
subsequently aiding the production of a highly concentrated 
CO2�stream.�Although�membrane�separation�finds�many�current�
commercial applications in industry (some of a large scale, 
like CO2 separation from natural gas) they have not yet been 
applied for the large scale and demanding conditions in terms 
of reliability and low-cost required for CO2 capture systems. 
A large worldwide R&D effort is in progress aimed at the 
manufacture of more suitable membrane materials for CO2 
capture in large-scale applications. 
3.1.3.3�
Distillation�of�a�liquefied�gas�stream�and�
refrigerated separation 
A gas can be made liquid by a series of compression, cooling 
and expansion steps. Once in liquid form, the components of 
the gas can be separated in a distillation column. In the case 
of air, this operation is currently carried out commercially on 
a large scale. Oxygen can be separated from air following the 
scheme of Figure 3.2c and be used in a range of CO2 capture 
systems (oxy-fuel combustion and pre-combustion capture). As 
in the previous paragraphs, the key issue for these systems is 
the�large�flow�of�oxygen�required.�Refrigerated�separation�can�
also be used to separate CO2 from other gases. It can be used 
to separate impurities from relatively high purity CO2 streams, 
for example, from oxy-fuel combustion and for CO2 removal 
from natural gas or synthesis gas that has undergone a shift 
conversion of CO to CO2.
3.1.4 
Application of CO2 capture
The CO2 capture systems shown in Figure 3.1 can be cross-
referenced with the different separation technologies of Figure 
3.2, resulting in a capture toolbox. Table 3.1 gives an overview 
of both current and emerging technologies in this toolbox. In the 
next sections of this chapter a more detailed description of all 
these technological options will be given, with more emphasis 
on the most developed technologies for which the CO2 capture 
cost can be estimated most reliably. These leading commercial 
options are shown in bold in Table 3.1. An overview of the 
diverse range of emerging options being investigated worldwide 
for CO2 capture applications will also be provided. All of these 
options�are�aimed�at�more�efficient�and�lower�cost�CO2-capture 
systems (compared with the leading options). It is important 
Figure 3.2 General schemes of the main separation processes relevant for CO2 capture. The gas removed in the separation may be CO2, H2 or O2. 
In Figures 3.2b and 3.2c one of the separated gas streams (A and B) is a concentrated stream of CO2, H2 or O2 and the other is a gas stream with 
all the remaining gases in the original gas (A+B).

to understand that this wide variety of approaches for CO2 
capture�will�tend�to�settle�with�time�as�the�expected�benefits�
(and potential weaknesses) in the technological portfolio of 
Table 3.1 becomes obvious with new results from current and 
future research and demonstration projects. Only a few of these 
options will prove truly cost-effective in the medium to long 
term. 
 
CO2 capture may be installed in new energy utilization 
plants�or�it�may�be�retrofitted�to�existing�plants.�In�principle,�
if CO2 capture is to be introduced rapidly, it may have to be 
retrofitted�to�some�existing�plants�or�these�plants�would�have�to�
be retired prematurely and replaced by new plants with capture. 
Disadvantages�of�retrofits�are:
• 
 There may be site constraints such as availability of land for 
the capture equipment; 
• 
 A long remaining plant life may be needed to justify the 
large expense of installing capture equipment;
•�
�Old�plants�tend�to�have�low�energy�efficiencies.�Including�
CO2 capture will have a proportionally greater impact on the 
net�output�than�in�high�efficiency�plants.
To minimize the site constraints, new energy utilization plants 
could be built ‘capture-ready’, that is with the process design 
initially factoring in the changes necessary to add capture and 
with�sufficient�space�and�facilities�made�available�for�simple�
installation of CO2 capture at a later date. For some types of 
capture�retrofit,�for�example�pre-combustion�capture�and�oxy-
fuel�combustion,�much�of�the�retrofit�equipment�could�be�built�
on a separate site if necessary.
 
The other barriers could be largely overcome by upgrading 
or substantially rebuilding the existing plant when capture is 
retrofitted.�For�example,�old�inefficient�boilers�and�steam�turbines�
could� be� replaced� by� modern,� high-efficiency� supercritical�
boilers� and� turbines� or� IGCC� plants.� As� the� efficiencies� of�
power�generation�technologies�are�increasing,�the�efficiency�of�
the�retrofitted�plant�with�CO2 capture could be as high as that of 
the original plant without capture. 
3.2 
industrial process capture systems
3.2.1 
Introduction
There are several industrial applications involving process 
streams where the opportunity exists to capture CO2 in large 
quantities and at costs lower than from the systems described 
in the rest of this chapter. Capture from these sources will not 
be the complete answer to the needs of climate change, since 
the volumes of combustion-generated CO2 are much higher, 
but�it�may�well�be�the�place�where�the�first�capture�and�storage�
occurs.
3.2.2 
Natural gas sweetening
Natural gas contains different concentration levels of CO2, 
depending on its source, which must be removed. Often pipeline 
specifications�require�that�the�CO2 concentration be lowered to 
table 3.1 Capture toolbox.

IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
around 2% by volume (although this amount varies in different 
places) to prevent pipeline corrosion, to avoid excess energy 
for transport and to increase the heating value of the gas. 
Whilst� accurate� figures� are� published� for� annual� worldwide�
natural gas production (BP, 2004), none seem to be published 
on how much of that gas may contain CO2. Nevertheless, a 
reasonable assumption is that about half of raw natural gas 
production contains CO2 at concentrations averaging at least 
4%� by� volume.� These� figures� can� be� used� to� illustrate� the�
scale of this CO2 capture and storage opportunity. If half of the 
worldwide production of 2618.5 billion m3 of natural gas in 
2003 is reduced in CO2 content from 4 to 2% mol, the resultant 
amount of CO2 removed would be at least 50 Mt CO2 yr-1. It is 
interesting to note that there are two operating natural gas plants 
capturing and storing CO2, BP’s In Salah plant in Algeria and 
a Statoil plant at Sleipner in the North Sea. Both capture about 
1 MtCO2 yr-1 (see Chapter 5). About 6.5 million tCO2 yr-1 from 
natural gas sweetening is also currently being used in enhanced 
oil recovery (EOR) in the United States (Beecy and Kuuskraa, 
2005) where in these commercial EOR projects, a large fraction 
of the injected CO2 is also retained underground (see Chapter 
5).
 
Depending on the level of CO2 in natural gas, different 
processes for natural gas sweetening (i.e., H2S and CO2 
removal) are available (Kohl and Nielsen, 1997 and Maddox 
and Morgan, 1998):
• 
Chemical solvents
• 
Physical solvents
• 
Membranes
 
Natural gas sweetening using various alkanolamines (MEA, 
DEA, MDEA, etc.; See Table 3.2), or a mixture of them, is the 
most�commonly�used�method.�The�process�flow�diagram�for�CO2 
recovery�from�natural�gas�is�similar�to�what�is�presented�for�flue�
gas treatment (see Figure 3.4, Section 3.3.2.1), except that in 
natural gas processing, absorption occurs at high pressure, with 
subsequent expansion before the stripper column, where CO2 
will�be�flashed�and�separated.�When�the�CO2 concentration in 
natural gas is high, membrane systems may be more economical. 
Industrial application of membranes for recovery of CO2 from 
natural gas started in the early 1980s for small units, with many 
design parameters unknown (Noble and Stern, 1995). It is now 
a well-established and competitive technology with advantages 
compared to other technologies, including amine treatment 
in certain cases (Tabe-Mohammadi, 1999). These advantages 
include lower capital cost, ease of skid-mounted installation, 
lower energy consumption, ability to be applied in remote areas, 
especially�offshore�and�flexibility.
3.2.3 
Steel production
The iron and steel industry is the largest energy-consuming 
manufacturing sector in the world, accounting for 10-15% 
of total industrial energy consumption (IEA GHG, 2000a). 
Associated CO2 emissions were estimated at 1442 MtCO2 in 
1995. Two types of iron- and steel-making technologies are in 
operation today. The integrated steel plant has a typical capacity 
of 3-5 Mtonnes yr-1 of steel and uses coal as its basic fuel with, 
in many cases, additional natural gas and oil. The mini-mill 
uses electric arc furnaces to melt scrap with a typical output of 1 
Mtonnes yr-1 of steel and an electrical consumption of 300-350 
kWh tonne-1 steel. Increasingly mini-mills blend direct-reduced 
iron (DRI) with scrap to increase steel quality. The production 
of direct-reduced iron involves reaction of high oxygen content 
iron ore with H2 and CO to form reduced iron plus H2O and 
CO2. As a result, many of the direct reduction iron processes 
could capture a pure CO2 stream.
 
An important and growing trend is the use of new iron-
making processes, which can use lower grade coal than the 
coking coals required for blast furnace operation. A good 
example is the COREX process (von Bogdandy et. al, 1989), 
which produces a large additional quantity of N2-free fuel gas 
which can be used in a secondary operation to convert iron 
ore to iron. Complete CO2 capture from this process should be 
possible with this arrangement since the CO2 and H2O present 
in the COREX top gas must be removed to allow the CO plus 
H2 to be heated and used to reduce iron oxide to iron in the 
secondary shaft kiln. This process will produce a combination 
of molten iron and iron with high recovery of CO2 derived 
from the coal feed to the COREX process.

Chapter 3: Capture of CO2
113
 
Early opportunities exist for the capture of CO2 emissions 
from the iron and steel industry, such as:
• 
 CO2 recovery from blast furnace gas and recycle of CO-rich 
top gas to the furnace. A minimum quantity of coke is still 
required and the blast furnace is fed with a mixture of pure 
O2 and recycled top gas. The furnace is, in effect, converted 
from� air� firing� to� oxy-fuel� firing� with� CO2 capture (see 
Section 3.4). This would recover 70% of the CO2 currently 
emitted from an integrated steel plant (Dongke et al., 1988). 
It�would�be�feasible�to�retrofit�existing�blast�furnaces�with�
this process.
• 
 Direct reduction of iron ore, using hydrogen derived from 
a fossil fuel in a pre-combustion capture step (see Section 
3.5) (Duarte and Reich, 1998). Instead of the fuel being 
burnt in the furnace and releasing its CO2 to atmosphere, 
the fuel would be converted to hydrogen and the CO2 would 
be captured during that process. The hydrogen would 
then be used as a reduction agent for the iron ore. Capture 
rates should be 90-95% according to the design of the pre-
combustion capture technique (see Section 3.5).
Other novel process routes for steel making to which CO2 capture 
can be applied are currently in the research and development 
phase (Gielen, 2003; IEA, 2004)
3.2.4 
Cement production
Emissions of CO2 from the cement industry account for 6% of 
the total emissions of CO2 from stationary sources (see Chapter 
2). Cement production requires large quantities of fuel to drive 
the high temperature, energy-intensive reactions associated 
with the calcination of the limestone – that is calcium carbonate 
being converted to calcium oxide with the evolution of CO2.
 
At present, CO2 is not captured from cement plants, but 
possibilities do exist. The concentration of CO2�in�the�flue�gases�
is� between� 15-30%� by� volume,� which� is� higher� than� in� flue�
gases from power and heat production (3-15% by volume). So, 
in principle, the post-combustion technologies for CO2 capture 
described in Section 3.3 could be applied to cement production 
plants, but would require the additional generation of steam in 
a cement plant to regenerate the solvent used to capture CO2. 
Oxy-fuel combustion capture systems may also become a 
promising technique to recover CO2 (IEA GHG, 1999). Another 
emerging option would be the use of calcium sorbents for CO2 
capture (see Sections 3.3.3.4 and 3.5.3.5) as calcium carbonate 
(limestone) is a raw material already used in cement plants. All 
of�these�capture�techniques�could�be�applied�to�retrofit,�or�new�
plant applications.
3.2.5 
Ammonia production
CO2 is a byproduct of ammonia (NH3) production (Leites et al., 
2003); Two main groups of processes are used:
•�
�Steam�reforming�of�light�hydrocarbons�(natural�gas,�liquefied�
petroleum gas, naphtha)
•�
�Partial� oxidation� or� gasification� of� heavy� hydrocarbons�
(coal, heavy fuel oil, vacuum residue).
Around 85% of ammonia is made by processes in the steam 
methane reforming group and so a description of the process is 
useful. Although the processes vary in detail, they all comprise 
the following steps:
1.� Purification�of�the�feed;
2. Primary steam methane reforming (see Section 3.5.2.1);
3. Secondary reforming, with the addition of air, commonly 
called auto thermal reforming (see Section 3.5.2.3);
4. Shift conversion of CO and H2O to CO2 and H2;
5. Removal of CO2;
6. Methanation (a process that reacts and removes trace CO 
and CO2);
7.  Ammonia synthesis.
The removal of CO2 as a pure stream is of interest to this report. 
A typical modern plant will use the amine solvent process to 
treat 200,000 Nm3 h-1 of gas from the reformer, to produce 72 
tonnes h-1 of concentrated CO2 (Apple, 1997). The amount of 
CO2 produced in modern plants from natural gas is about 1.27 
tCO2/tNH3. Hence, with a world ammonia production of about 
100 Mtonnes yr-1, about 127 MtCO2 yr-1 is produced. However, 
it should be noted that this is not all available for storage, as 
ammonia plants are frequently combined with urea plants, 
which are capable of utilizing 70-90% of the CO2. About 0.7 
MtCO2 yr-1captured from ammonia plants is currently used 
for enhanced oil recovery in the United States (Beecy and 
Kuuskraa, 2005) with a large fraction of the injected CO2 being 
retained underground (see Chapter 5) in these commercial EOR 
projects.
3.2.6 
Status and outlook
We have reviewed processes – current and potential - that may be 
used to separate CO2 in the course of producing another product. 
One of these processes, natural gas sweetening, is already being 
used in two industrial plants to capture and store about 2 MtCO2 
yr-1 for the purpose of climate change mitigation. In the case of 
ammonia production, pure CO2 is already being separated. Over 
7 MtCO2 yr-1 captured from both natural gas sweetening and 
ammonia plants is currently being used in enhanced oil recovery 
with some storage (see also Chapter 5) of the injected CO2 in 
these commercial EOR projects. Several potential processes for 
CO2 capture in steel and cement production exist, but none have 
yet been applied. Although the total amount of CO2 that may 
be captured from these industrial processes�is�insignificant�in�
terms�of�the�scale�of�the�climate�change�challenge,�significance�
may arise in that their use could serve as early examples of 
solutions that can be applied on larger scale elsewhere.

 Post-combustion capture systems
3.3.1 
Introduction
Current anthropogenic CO2 emissions from stationary sources 
come mostly from combustion systems such as power plants, 
114
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
cement kilns, furnaces in industries and iron and steel production 
plants (see Chapter 2). In these large-scale processes, the direct 
firing�of�fuel�with�air�in�a�combustion�chamber�has�been�(for�
centuries, as it is today) the most economic technology to extract 
and use the energy contained in the fuel. Therefore, the strategic 
importance of post-combustion capture systems becomes 
evident when confronted with the reality of today’s sources of 
CO2 emissions. Chapter 2 shows that any attempt to mitigate 
CO2 emissions from stationary sources on a relevant scale using 
CO2 capture and storage, will have to address CO2 capture from 
combustion systems. All the CO2 capture systems described in 
this section are aimed at the separation of CO2�from�the�flue�
gases�generated�in�a�large-scale�combustion�process�fired�with�
fossil fuels. Similar capture systems can also be applied to 
biomass�fired�combustion�processes�that�tend�to�be�used�on�a�
much smaller scale compared to those for fossil fuels.
 
Flue gases or stack gases found in combustion systems are 
usually at atmospheric pressure. Because of the low pressure, 
the large presence of nitrogen from air and the large scale of the 
units,�huge�flows�of�gases�are�generated,�the�largest�example�
of which may be the stack emissions coming from a natural 
gas combined cycle power plant having a maximum capacity of 
around 5 million normal m3 h-1. CO2�contents�of�flue�gases�vary�
depending on the type of fuel used (between 3% for a natural 
gas�combined�cycle�to�less�than�15%�by�volume�for�a�coal-fired�
combustion plant See Table 2.1). In principle post-combustion 
capture� systems� can� be� applied� to� flue� gases� produced� from�
the combustion of any type of fuel. However, the impurities 
in the fuel are very important for the design and costing of 
the complete plant (Rao and Rubin, 2002). Flue gases coming 
from coal combustion will contain not only CO2, N2, O2 and 
H2O, but also air pollutants such as SOx, NOx, particulates, 
HCl, HF, mercury, other metals and other trace organic and 
inorganic contaminants. Figure 3.3 shows a general schematic 
of�a�coal-fired�power�plant�in�which�additional�unit�operations�
are deployed to remove the air pollutants prior to CO2 capture 
in an absorption-based process. Although capture of CO2 in 
these�flue�gases�is�in�principle�more�problematic�and�energy�
intensive than from other gas streams, commercial experience 
is�available�at�a�sufficiently�large�scale�(see�Section�3.3.2)�to�
provide the basis for cost estimates for post-combustion CO2 
capture systems (see Section 3.7). Also, a large R&D effort is 
being�undertaken�worldwide�to�develop�more�efficient�and�lower�
cost post-combustion systems (see Section 3.3.3), following all 
possible approaches for the CO2 separation step (using sorbents, 
membranes or cryogenics; see Section 3.1.3). 
3.3.2 
Existing technologies
There are several commercially available process technologies 
which can in principle be used for CO2�capture�from�flue�gases.�
However, comparative assessment studies (Hendriks, 1994; 
Riemer and Ormerod, 1995; IEA GHG, 2000b) have shown that 
absorption processes based on chemical solvents are currently 
the preferred option for post-combustion CO2 capture. At this 
point�in�time,�they�offer�high�capture�efficiency�and�selectivity,�
and the lowest energy use and costs when compared with 
other existing post-combustion capture processes. Absorption 
processes have reached the commercial stage of operation for 
post-combustion CO2 capture systems, albeit not on the scale 
required�for�power�plant�flue�gases.�Therefore,�the�following�
paragraphs are devoted to a review of existing knowledge 
of the technology and the key technical and environmental 
issues relevant to the application of this currently leading 
commercial option for CO2 capture. The fundamentals of the 
CO2 separation step using commercial chemical absorption 
processes� are� discussed� first.� The� requirements� of� flue� gas�
pretreatment (removal of pollutants other than CO2) and the 
energy requirements for regeneration of the chemical solvent 
follow.

Absorption processes

Chapter 3: Capture of CO2
115
Absorption processes in post-combustion capture make use of 
the reversible nature of the chemical reaction of an aqueous 
alkaline solvent, usually an amine, with an acid or sour gas. 
The�process�flow�diagram�of�a�commercial�absorption�system�is�
presented�in�Figure�3.4.�After�cooling�the�flue�gas,�it�is�brought�
into contact with the solvent in the absorber. A blower is 
required to overcome the pressure drop through the absorber. At 
absorber temperatures typically between 40 and 60oC, CO2 is 
bound�by�the�chemical�solvent�in�the�absorber.�The�flue�gas�then�
undergoes a water wash section to balance water in the system 
and to remove any solvent droplets or solvent vapour carried 
over, and then it leaves the absorber. It is possible to reduce 
CO2 concentration in the exit gas down to very low values, as 
a result of the chemical reaction in the solvent, but lower exit 
concentrations tend to increase the height of the absorption 
vessel. The ‘rich’ solvent, which contains the chemically bound 
CO2 is then pumped to the top of a stripper (or regeneration 
vessel), via a heat exchanger. The regeneration of the chemical 
solvent is carried out in the stripper at elevated temperatures 
(100oC–140oC) and pressures not very much higher than 
atmospheric pressure. Heat is supplied to the reboiler to 
maintain the regeneration conditions. This leads to a thermal 
energy penalty as a result of heating up the solvent, providing 
the required desorption heat for removing the chemically 
bound CO2 and for steam production which acts as a stripping 
gas. Steam is recovered in the condenser and fed back to the 
stripper, whereas the CO2 product gas leaves the stripper. The 
‘lean’ solvent, containing far less CO2 is then pumped back to 
the absorber via the lean-rich heat exchanger and a cooler to 
bring it down to the absorber temperature level.
 
Figure 3.4 also shows some additional equipment needed 
to maintain the solution quality as a result of the formation of 
degradation products, corrosion products and the presence of 
particles.�This�is�generally�done�using�filters,�carbon�beds�and�
a thermally operated reclaimer. Control of degradation and 
corrosion has in fact been an important aspect in the development 
of absorption processes over the past few decades.
 
The key parameters determining the technical and economic 
operation of a CO2 absorption system are:
• 
�Flue�gas�flow�rate�-�The�flue�gas�flow�rate�will�determine�the�
size of the absorber and the absorber represents a sizeable 
contribution to the overall cost.
• 
 CO2� content� in� flue� gas� -� Since� flue� gas� is� usually� at�
atmospheric pressure, the partial pressure of CO2 will be 
as low as 3-15 kPa. Under these low CO2 partial pressure 
conditions, aqueous amines (chemical solvents) are the most 
suitable absorption solvents (Kohl and Nielsen, 1997).
• 
 CO2 removal - In practice, typical CO2 recoveries are between 
80% and 95%. The exact recovery choice is an economic 
trade-off, a higher recovery will lead to a taller absorption 
column, higher energy penalties and hence increased costs.
• 
�Solvent� flow� rate� -� The� solvent� flow� rate� will� determine�
the size of most equipment apart from the absorber. For a 
given�solvent,�the�flow�rate�will�be�fixed�by�the�previous�
parameters and also the chosen CO2 concentrations within 
the lean and the rich solutions.
• 
 Energy requirement - The energy consumption of the process 
is the sum of the thermal energy needed to regenerate the 
solvents and the electrical energy required to operate liquid 
pumps�and�the�flue�gas�blower�or�fan.�Energy�is�also�required�
to compress the CO2�recovered�to�the�final�pressure�required�
for transport and storage.

IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
•�
�Cooling�requirement�-�Cooling�is�needed�to�bring�the�flue�
gas and solvent temperatures down to temperature levels 
required�for�efficient�absorption�of�CO2. Also, the product 
from the stripper will require cooling to recover steam from 
the stripping process.
The purity and pressure of CO2 typically recovered from an 
amine-based chemical absorption process are as follows (Sander 
and Mariz, 1992):
• 
 CO2 purity: 99.9% by volume or more (water saturated 
conditions)
• 
CO2 pressure: 50 kPa (gauge)
A further CO2�purification�step�makes�it�possible�to�bring�the�
CO2-quality up to food-grade standard. This is required for use 
in beverages and packaging.
�
Since�combustion�flue�gases�are�generally�at�atmospheric�
pressure and the CO2 is diluted, the CO2 partial pressure is 
very�low.�Also,�flue�gas�contains�oxygen�and�other�impurities;�
therefore an important characteristic of an absorption process is 
in the proper choice of solvent for the given process duty. High 
CO2 loading and low heat of desorption energy are essential 
for�atmospheric�flue�gas�CO2 recovery. The solvents must also 
have low byproduct formation and low decomposition rates, to 
maintain solvent performance and to limit the amount of waste 
materials produced. The important effect of other contaminants 
on the solvent is discussed in Section 3.3.2.2. 
 
The following three absorption processes are commercially 
available for CO2 capture in post-combustion systems:
• 
The Kerr-McGee/ABB Lummus Crest Process (Barchas and 
Davis, 1992) - This process recovers CO2 from coke and 
coal-fired�boilers,�delivering�CO2 for soda ash and liquid 
CO2 preparations. It uses a 15-20% by weight aqueous 
MEA (Mono-Ethanolamine) solution. The largest capacity 
experienced for this process is 800 tCO2 d-1utilizing two 
parallel trains (Arnold et al., 1982).
• 
The Fluor Daniel ® ECONAMINE™ Process (Sander and 
Mariz, 1992, Chapel et al., 1999) - This process was acquired 
by Fluor Daniel Inc. from Dow Chemical Company in 1989. 
It is a MEA-based process (30% by weight aqueous solution) 
with an inhibitor to resist carbon steel corrosion and is 
specifically�tailored�for�oxygen-containing�gas�streams.�It�
has been used in many plants worldwide recovering up to 
320 tCO2 d-1 in a single train for use in beverage and urea 
production.
• 
The Kansai Electric Power Co., Mitsubishi Heavy 
Industries, Ltd., KEPCO/MHI Process (Mimura et al., 1999 
and 2003) - The process is based upon sterically-hindered 
amines and already three solvents (KS-1, KS-2 and KS-3) 
have been developed. KS-1 was commercialized in a urea 
production application. In this process, low amine losses 
and low solvent degradation have been noted without the 
use of inhibitors or additives. As shown in Figure 3.5, the 
first�commercial�plant�at�200�tCO2 d-1 recovery�from�a�flue�
gas stream has been operating in Malaysia since 1999 for 
urea production (equivalent to the emissions from a 10 MWt 
coal-fired�power�plant) 
The performance of the chemical solvent in the operation is 
maintained� by� replacement,� filtering� and� reclaiming,� which�
leads to a consumables requirement. Typical values for the 
solvent consumption are between 0.2 and 1.6 kg/tCO2. In 
addition, chemicals are needed to reclaim the amine from 
the heat stable salt (typically 0.03–0.13 kg NaOH/tCO2) and 
to remove decomposition products (typically 0.03-0.06 kg 
activated carbon/tCO2). The ranges are primarily dependent on 
the absorption process, with KS-1 being at the low end of the 
range and ECONAMINE ™ at the high end.
3.3.2.2. 
Flue gas pretreatment
Flue gases from a combustion power plant are usually above 
100°C, which means that they need to be cooled down to the 
temperature levels required for the absorption process. This can 
be done in a cooler with direct water contact, which also acts as 
a�flue�gas�wash�with�additional�removal�of�fine�particulates.
�
In�addition�to�the�above,�flue�gas�from�coal�combustion�will�
contain other acid gas components such as NOx and SOx. Flue 
gases from natural gas combustion will normally only contain 
NOx. These acidic gas components will, similar to CO2, have 
a chemical interaction with the alkaline solvent. This is not 
desirable as the irreversible nature of this interaction leads to 
the formation of heat stable salts and hence a loss in absorption 
capacity of the solvent and the risk of formation of solids in the 
solution. It also results in an extra consumption of chemicals 
to regenerate the solvent and the production of a waste stream 
such as sodium sulphate or sodium nitrate. Therefore, the 
pre-removal of NOx and SOx to very low values before CO2 
Figure 3.5 CO2 capture plant in Malaysia using a 200 tonne d−1 
KEPCO/MHI chemical solvent process (Courtesy of Mitsubishi).
Chapter 3: Capture of CO2
117
recovery becomes essential. For NOx it is the NO2 which leads 
to the formation of heat stable salts. Fortunately, the level of 
NO2 is mostly less than 10% of the overall NOx�content�in�a�flue�
gas (Chapel et al., 1999). 
 
The allowable SOx� content� in� the� flue� gas� is� primarily�
determined by the cost of the solvent - as this is consumed 
by reaction with SOx. SO2�concentrations�in�the�flue�gas�are�
typically around 300-5000 ppm. Commercially available 
SO2-removal plants will remove up to 98-99%. Amines are 
relatively cheap chemicals, but even cheap solvents like MEA 
(with a price around 1.25 US$ kg-1 (Rao and Rubin, 2002) may 
require SOx concentrations of around 10 ppm, to keep solvent 
consumption (around 1.6 kg of MEA/tCO2 separated) and make 
up costs at reasonable values, which often means that additional 
flue�gas�desulphurization�is�needed.�The�optimal�SO2 content, 
before the CO2 absorption process is a cost trade-off between 
CO2-solvent consumption and SO2-removal costs. For the 
Kerr-Mcgee/ABB Lummus Crest Technology, SO2-removal is 
typically�not�justified�for�SO2 levels below 50 ppm (Barchas 
and Davis, 1992). For the Fluor Daniel Econamine FG process a 
maximum of 10 ppm SO2 content is generally set as the feed 
gas�specification�(Sander�and�Mariz,�1992).�This�can�be�met�
by using alkaline salt solutions in a spray scrubber (Chapel et 
al., 1999). A SO2 scrubber might also double as a direct contact 
cooler�to�cool�down�the�flue�gas.
�
Careful�attention�must�also�be�paid�to�fly�ash�and�soot�present�
in�the�flue�gas,�as�they�might�plug�the�absorber�if�contaminants�
levels�are�too�high.�Often�the�requirements�of�other�flue�gas�
treatment are such that precautions have already been taken. 
In the case of CO2�recovery�from�a�coal-fired�boiler�flue�gas,�
the plant typically has to be equipped with a DeNOx unit, an 
electrostatic�precipitator�or�a�bag�house�filter�and�a�DeSOx or 
flue� gas� desulphurization� unit� as� part� of� the� environmental�
protection of the power plant facilities. In some cases, these 
environmental protection facilities are not enough to carry out 
deep SOx removal up to the 1-2 ppm level sometimes needed 
to minimize solvent consumption and its reclamation from 
sticking of solvent wastes on reclaimer tube surfaces.
3.3.2.3�
Power�generation�efficiency�penalty�in�CO2 capture 
A key feature of post-combustion CO2 capture processes based 
on absorption is the high energy requirement and the resulting 
efficiency�penalty�on�power�cycles.�This�is�primarily�due�to�the�
heat necessary to regenerate the solvent, steam use for stripping 
and to a lesser extent the electricity required for liquid pumping, 
the�flue�gas�fan�and�finally�compression�of�the�CO2 product. 
Later in this chapter, Sections 3.6 and 3.7 present summaries of 
CO2 capture energy requirements for a variety of power systems 
and discuss the environmental and economic implications of 
these energy demands. 
 
In principle, the thermal energy for the regeneration process 
can� be� supplied� by� an� auxiliary� boiler� in� a� retrofit� situation.�
Most studies, however, focus on an overall process in which 
the absorption process is integrated into the power plant. The 
heat requirement is at such levels that low-pressure steam, 
for example condensing at 0.3 MPa(g), can be used in the 
reboiler. The steam required for the regeneration process is then 
extracted from the steam cycle in the power plant. For a coal-
fired�power�station,�low-pressure�steam�will�be�extracted�prior�
to the last expansion stage of the steam turbine. For a natural 
gas�fired�combined�cycle,�low-pressure�steam�will�be�extracted�
from the last stage in the heat recovery steam generator. Some 
of this heat can be recovered by preheating the boiler feed 
water (Hendriks, 1994). Values for the heat requirement for the 
leading absorption technologies are between 2.7 and 3.3 GJ/
tCO2, depending on the solvent process. Typical values for the 
electricity requirement are between 0.06 and 0.11 GJ/tCO2 for 
post-combustion�capture�in�coal-�fired�power�plants�and�0.21�
and 0.33 GJ/tCO2 for post-combustion capture in natural gas 
fired�combined�cycles.�Compression�of�the�CO2 to 110 bar will 
require around 0.4 GJ/tCO2 (IEA GHG, 2004).
 
Integration of the absorption process with an existing power 
plant�will�require�modifications�of�the�low-pressure�part�of�the�
steam cycle, as a sizeable fraction of the steam will be extracted 
and hence will not be available to produce power (Nsakala et 
al., 2001, Mimura et al.,1995, Mimura et al., 1997). To limit 
the�required�modifications,�small�back-pressure�steam�turbines�
using�medium�pressure�steam�to�drive�the�flue�gas�fan�and�boiler�
feed water pumps can be used. The steam is then condensed in 
the reboiler (Mimura et al., 1999). Furthermore, in power plants 
based on steam cycles more than 50% thermal energy in the 
steam cycle is disposed off in the steam condenser. If the steam 
cycle system and CO2 recovery can be integrated, part of the 
waste heat disposed by the steam condenser can be utilized for 
regeneration of the chemical solvent. 
 
The reduction of the energy penalty is, nevertheless, closely 
linked to the chosen solvent system. The IEA Greenhouse 
Programme (IEA GHG) has carried out performance assessments 
of power plants with post-combustion capture of CO2, taking 
into consideration the most recent improvements in post-
combustion CO2� capture� processes� identified� by� technology�
licensors (IEA GHG, 2004). In this study, Mitsui Babcock 
Energy Ltd. and Alstom provided information on the use of a 
high�efficiency,�ultra-supercritical�steam�cycle�(29�MPa,�600°C, 
620°C�reheat)�boiler�and�steam�turbine�for�a�coal-fired�power�
plant, while for the NGCC case, a combined cycle using a 
GE 9FA gas turbine was adopted. Fluor provided information 
on the Fluor Econamine + process based on MEA, and MHI 
provided information on KEPCO/MHI process based on the 
KS-1 solvent for CO2 capture. CO2 leaving these systems were 
compressed to a pressure of 11 MPa. The overall net power 
plant�efficiencies�with�and�without�CO2 capture are shown in 
Figure�3.6,�while�Figure�3.7�shows�the�efficiency�penalty�for�
CO2 capture. Overall, results from this study show that the 
efficiency�penalty�for�post-combustion�capture�in�coal�and�gas�
fired�plant�is�lower�for�KEPCO/MHI’s�CO2 absorption process. 
For the purpose of comparison, the performance of power plants 
with pre-combustion and oxy-fuel capture, based on the same 
standard set of plant design criteria are also shown in Figures 
3.6 and 3.7.

3.3.2.4�
Effluents
As� a� result� of� decomposition� of� amines,� effluents� will� be�
created, particularly ammonia and heat-stable salts. Rao and 
Rubin (2002) have estimated these emissions for an MEA-based 
process based on limited data. In such processes, heat stable 
salts (solvent decomposition products, corrosion products etc.) 
are removed from the solution in a reclaimer and a waste stream 
is created and is disposed of using normal HSE (Health, Safety 
and Environmental) practices. In some cases, these reclaimer 
bottoms� may� be� classified� as� a� hazardous� waste,� requiring�
special�handling�(Rao�and�Rubin,�2002).�Also�a�particle�filter�and�
carbon�filter�is�normally�installed�in�the�solvent�circuit�to�remove�
byproducts. Finally, some solvent material will be lost to the 
environment through evaporation and carry over in the absorber, 
which is accounted for in the solvent consumption. It is expected 
that acid gases other than CO2,�which�are�still�present�in�the�flue�
gas (SOx and NO2) will also be absorbed in the solution. This 
will lower the concentration of these components further and 
even the net emissions in some cases depending on the amount 
of additional energy use for CO2 capture (see Tables 3.4 and 3.5). 
As SO2-removal prior to CO2-removal�is�very�likely�in�coal-fired�
plants, this will lead to the production of a waste or byproduct 
stream containing gypsum and water from the FGD unit.
3.3.3 
Emerging technologies
3.3.3.1 
Other absorption process
Various novel solvents are being investigated, with the object 
of achieving a reduced energy consumption for solvent 
regeneration (Chakma, 1995; Chakma and Tontiwachwuthikul, 
1999; Mimura et al., 1999; Zheng et al., 2003; Cullinane and 
Rochelle, 2003; Leites, 1998; Erga et al., 1995; Aresta and 
Dibenedetto, 2003; Bai and Yeh, 1997).
 
Besides novel solvents, novel process designs are also 
currently becoming available (Leites et al. 2003). Research is 
also being carried out to improve upon the existing practices 
and packing types (Aroonwilas et al., 2003). Another area of 
research is to increase the concentration levels of aqueous MEA 
solution used in absorption systems as this tends to reduce the 
size of equipment used in capture plants (Aboudheir et al., 
2003). Methods to prevent oxidative degradation of MEA 
by de-oxygenation of the solvent solutions are also being 
investigated (Chakravarti et al., 2001). In addition to this, the 
catalytic�removal�of�oxygen�in�flue�gases�from�coal�firing�has�
been suggested (Nsakala et al., 2001) to enable operation with 
promising solvents sensitive to oxygen.

a.�� The�efficiencies�are�based�on�a�standard�set�of�plant�design�criteria�(IEA�GHG,�2004).
b.  The coal steam cycle plants, including the post-combustion capture and oxy-fuel plants, are based on ultra-supercritical steam (29MPa, 600C 
superheat, 620C reheat). The IGCC and natural gas pre- and post-combustion capture plants are based on GE 9FA gas turbine combined 
cycles. The natural gas oxy-fuel plant is based on a CO2 recycle gas turbine, as shown in Figure 3.10, with different operating pressures and 
temperatures but similar mechanical design criteria to that of the 9FA. 
c.  Data are presented for two types of post-combustion capture solvent: MEA (Fluor plant designs) and KS-1 (MHI plant designs). The solvent 
desorption heat consumptions are 3.2 and 2.7 MJ/kgCO2 captured respectively for the coal plants and 3.7 and 2.7 MJ kg−1 for the natural gas 
plants.

e.  The natural gas pre-combustion capture plant is based on partial oxidation using oxygen. 
f.  The oxy-fuel plants include cryogenic removal of some of the impurities from the CO2 during compression. Electricity consumption for 
oxygen production by cryogenic distillation of air is 200 kWh/ tO2 at atmospheric pressure for the coal plant and 320 kWh/ tO2 at 40 bar for 
the natural gas plant. Oxygen production in the IGCC and natural gas pre-combustion capture plants is partially integrated with the gas turbine 
compressor, so comparable data cannot be provided for these plants.

Figure 3.7 Percentage increase in fuel use per kWh of electricity due to CO2 capture, compared to the same plant without capture (Source data: 
Davison, 2005; IEA GHG, 2004; IEA GHG, 2003; IEA GHG, 2000b; Dillon et al., 2005).
a.  The increase in fuel required to produce a kWh of electricity is calculated by comparing the same type of plant with and without capture. The 
increase in fuel consumption depends on the type of baseline plant without capture. For example, the increase in energy consumption for a GE 
IGCC plant with capture compared to a coal steam cycle baseline plant without capture would be 40% as opposed to the lower value shown 
in�the�figure�that�was�calculated�relative�to�the�same�type�of�baseline�plant�without�capture.
b.  The direct energy consumptions for CO2 separation are lower for pre-combustion capture than for post-combustion capture, because CO2 is 
removed from a more concentrated, higher pressure gas, so a physical rather than a chemical solvent can be used.
c.  The ‘Fuel gas processing and related impacts’ category for IGCC includes shift conversion of the fuel gas and the effects on the gas turbine 
combined cycle of removal of CO2 from the fuel gas and use of hydrogen as a fuel instead of syngas. For natural gas pre-combustion capture 
this category also includes partial oxidation/steam reforming of the natural gas. 
d.  The energy consumption for CO2 compression is lower in pre-combustion capture than in post-combustion capture because some of the CO2 
leaves the separation unit at elevated pressure. 
e.  The energy consumption for CO2 compression in the oxy-fuel processes depends on the composition of the extracted product, namely 75% 
by�volume�in�the�coal-fired�plant�and�93%�by�volume�in�the�gas�fired�plant.�Impurities�are�cryogenically�removed�from�the�CO2 during 
compression,�to�give�a�final�CO2 purity of 96% by volume. The energy consumption of the cryogenic CO2 separation unit is included in the 
CO2 compression power consumption. 
f.   The ‘Oxygen production and power plant impacts’ category for oxy-fuel processes includes the power consumption for oxygen production 
and the impacts of CO2 capture on the rest of the power plant, that is excluding CO2�compression�and�purification.�In�the�coal-fired�oxy-fuel�
plant,�the�efficiency�of�the�rest�of�the�power�plant�increases�slightly,�for�example�due�to�the�absence�of�a�flue�gas�desulphurization�(FGD)�
unit.�The�efficiency�of�the�rest�of�the�gas�fired�oxy-fuel�plant�decreases�because�of�the�change�of�working�fluid�in�the�power�cycle�from�air�to�
recycled�flue�gas.�
3.3.3.2 
 Adsorption process
In�the�adsorption�process�for�flue�gas�CO2 recovery, molecular 
sieves or activated carbons are used in adsorbing CO2. Desorbing 
CO2 is then done by the pressure swing operation (PSA) or 
temperature swing operation (TSA). Most applications are 
associated with pressure swing adsorption (Ishibashi et al., 1999 
and Yokoyama, 2003). Much less attention has been focused 
on CO2 removal via temperature swing adsorption, as this 
technique is less attractive compared to PSA due to the longer 
cycle times needed to heat up the bed of solid particles during 
sorbent regeneration. For bulk separations at large scales, it is 
also essential to limit the length of the unused bed and therefore 
opt for faster cycle times.
 
Adsorption processes have been employed for CO2 removal 
from synthesis gas for hydrogen production (see Section 
3.5.2.9). It has not yet reached a commercial stage for CO2 
recovery�from�flue�gases.�The�following�main�R&D�activities�
have been conducted:
• 
Study of CO2� removal� from� flue� gas� of� a� thermal� power�
plant by physical adsorption (Ishibashi et al., 1999);
• 
Study of CO2� removal� from� flue� gas� of� a� thermal� power�
plant by a combined system with pressure swing adsorption 
and a super cold separator (Takamura et al., 1999);
• 
Pilot tests on the recovery of CO2�from�a�coal�and�oil�fired�
power plant, using pressure temperature swing adsorption 
(PTSA) and an X-type zeolite as an adsorbent (Yokoyama, 
2003).
Pilot�test�results�of�coal-fired�flue�gas�CO2 recovery by adsorption 
processes show that the energy consumption for capture 
(blowers and vacuum pumps) has improved from the original 
708 kWh/tCO2 to 560 kWh/tCO2. An energy consumption of 
560 kWh/tCO2 is equivalent to a loss corresponding to 21% of 
the energy output of the power plant. Recovered CO2 purity is 
about 99.0% by volume using two stages of a PSA and PTSA 
system (Ishibashi et al., 1999).
 
It can be concluded that based on mathematical models and 
data from pilot-scale experimental installations, the design of 
a full-scale industrial adsorption process might be feasible. A 
serious drawback of all adsorptive methods is the necessity to 
120
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
treat the gaseous feed before CO2 separation in an adsorber. 
Operation at high temperature with other sorbents (see Section 
3.3.3.4) can circumvent this requirement (Sircar and Golden, 
2001). In many cases gases have to be also cooled and dried, 
which limits the attractiveness of PSA, TSA or ESA (electric 
swing adsorption) vis-à-vis capture by chemical absorption 
described in previous sections. The development of a new 
generation� of� materials� that� would� efficiently� adsorb� CO2 
will undoubtedly enhance the competitiveness of adsorptive 
separation�in�a�flue�gas�application.
3.3.3.3 
 Membranes
Membrane processes are used commercially for CO2 removal 
from natural gas at high pressure and at high CO2 concentration 
(see�Section�3.2.2).�In�flue�gases,�the�low�CO2 partial pressure 
difference provides a low driving force for gas separation. 
The removal of carbon dioxide using commercially available 
polymeric gas separation membranes results in higher energy 
penalties� on� the� power� generation� efficiency� compared� to� a�
standard chemical absorption process (Herzog et al., 1991, Van 
der Sluijs et al., 1992 and Feron, 1994). Also, the maximum 
percentage of CO2 removed is lower than for a standard 
chemical absorption processes. Improvements can be made if 
more selective membranes become available, such as facilitated 
membranes, described below.
 
The membrane option currently receiving the most attention 
is a hybrid membrane – absorbent (or solvent) system. These 
systems� are� being� developed� for� flue� gas� CO2 recovery. 
Membrane/solvent systems employ membranes to provide 
a very high surface area to volume ratio for mass exchange 
between a gas stream and a solvent resulting in a very compact 
system. This results in a membrane contactor system in which 
the membrane forms a gas permeable barrier between a liquid 
and a gaseous phase. In general, the membrane is not involved 
in the separation process. In the case of porous membranes, 
gaseous components diffuse through the pores and are absorbed 
by the liquid; in cases of non-porous membranes they dissolve in 
the membrane and diffuse through the membrane. The contact 
surface area between gas and liquid phase is maintained by the 
membrane�and�is�independent�of�the�gas�and�liquid�flow�rate.�
The selectivity of the partition is primarily determined by the 
absorbent (solvent). Absorption in the liquid phase is determined 
either by physical partition or by a chemical reaction.
 
The advantages of membrane/solvent systems are avoidance 
of operational problems occurring in conventional solvent 
absorption systems (see Section 3.3.2.1) where gas and liquid 
flows� are� in� direct� contact.� Operational� problems� avoided�
include� foaming,� flooding� entrainment� and� channelling,� and�
result�in�the�free�choice�of�the�gas�and�liquid�flow�rates�and�
a� fixed� interface� for� mass� transfer� in� the� membrane/solvent�
system. Furthermore, the use of compact membranes result 
in smaller equipment sizes with capital cost reductions. The 
choice of a suitable combination of solvent and membrane 
material is very important. The material characteristics should 
be such that the transfer of solvent through the membrane is 
avoided at operating pressure gradients of typically 50–100 kPa, 
while the transfer of gas is not hindered. The overall process 
configuration�in�terms�of�unit�operations�would�be�very�similar�
to a conventional chemical absorption/desorption process (see 
Figure 3.4). Membrane/solvent systems can be both used in the 
absorption as well as in the desorption step. Feron and Jansen 
(2002) and Falk-Pedersen et al. (1999) give examples of suitable 
membrane/solvent systems. 
 
Research and development efforts have also been reported 
in the area of facilitated transport membranes. Facilitated 
transport membranes rely on the formation of complexes 
or reversible chemical reactions of components present in a 
gas stream with compounds present in the membrane. These 
complexes or reaction products are then transported through the 
membrane. Although solution and diffusion still play a role in 
the�transport�mechanism,�the�essential�element�is�the�specific�
chemical interaction of a gas component with a compound in 
the membrane, the so-called carrier. Like other pressure driven 
membrane processes, the driving force for the separation 
comes from a difference in partial pressure of the component 
to be transported. An important class of facilitated transport 
membranes is the so-called supported liquid membrane in which 
the carrier is dissolved into a liquid contained in a membrane. 
For CO2 separations, carbonates, amines and molten salt 
hydrates have been suggested as carriers (Feron, 1992). Porous 
membranes and ion-exchange membranes have been employed 
as the support. Until now, supported liquid membranes have 
only been studied on a laboratory scale. Practical problems 
associated with supported liquid membranes are membrane 
stability and liquid volatility. Furthermore, the selectivity for a 
gas decreases with increasing partial pressure on the feed side. 
This is a result of saturation of the carrier in the liquid. Also, as 
the total feed pressure is increased, the permeation of unwanted 
components is increased. This also results in a decrease in 
 selectivity. Finally, selectivity is also reduced by a reduction in 
membrane thickness. Recent development work has focused on 
the following technological options that are applicable to both 
CO2/N2 and CO2/H2 separations:
• 
Amine-containing membranes (Teramoto et al., 1996);
• 
Membranes containing potassium carbonate polymer gel 
membranes (Okabe et al., 2003);
• 
Membranes containing potassium carbonate-glycerol 
(Chen et al., 1999);
• 
Dendrimer-containing membranes  
(Kovvali and Sirkar, 2001).
• 
Poly-electrolyte membranes (Quinn and Laciak, 1997);
 
Facilitated transport membranes and other membranes can 
also be used in a preconcentration step prior to the liquefaction 
of CO2 (Mano et al., 2003). 
3.3.3.4 
Solid sorbents
There are post-combustion systems being proposed that make 
use of regenerable solid sorbents to remove CO2 at relatively 
high temperatures. The use of high temperatures in the CO2 
separation�step�has�the�potential�to�reduce�efficiency�penalties�
with respect to wet-absorption methods. In principle, they all 
Chapter 3: Capture of CO2
121
follow the scheme shown in Figure 3.2a, where the combustion 
flue�gas�is�put�in�contact�with�the�sorbent�in�a�suitable�reactor�to�
allow the gas-solid reaction of CO2 with the sorbent (usually the 
carbonation of a metal oxide). The solid can be easily separated 
from the gas stream and sent for regeneration in a different 
reactor. Instead of moving the solids, the reactor can also be 
switched between sorption and regeneration modes of operation 
in a batch wise, cyclic operation. One key component for the 
development of these systems is obviously the sorbent itself, 
that has to have good CO2 absorption capacity and chemical and 
mechanical stability for long periods of operation in repeated 
cycles. In general, sorbent performance and cost are critical 
issues in all post-combustion systems, and more elaborate 
sorbent materials are usually more expensive and will have to 
demonstrate outstanding performance compared with existing 
commercial alternatives such as those described in 3.3.2.
 
Solid sorbents being investigated for large-scale CO2 capture 
purposes are sodium and potassium oxides and carbonates (to 
produce bicarbonate), usually supported on a solid substrate 
(Hoffman et al., 2002; Green et al., 2002). Also, high temperature 
Li-based and CaO-based sorbents are suitable candidates. The 
use of lithium-containing compounds (lithium, lithium-zirconia 
and lithium-silica oxides) in a carbonation-calcination cycle, 
was�first�investigated�in�Japan�(Nakagawa�and�Ohashi,�1998).�
The reported performance of these sorbents is very good, with 
very high reactivity in a wide range of temperatures below 
700ºC, rapid regeneration at higher temperatures and durability 
in repeated capture-regeneration cycles. This is essential 
because lithium is an intrinsically expensive material.
 
The use of CaO as a regenerable CO2 sorbent has been 
proposed in several processes dating back to the 19th century. 
The carbonation reaction of CaO to separate CO2 from hot gases 
(T > 600ºC) is very fast and the regeneration of the sorbent 
by calcining the CaCO3 into CaO and pure CO2 is favoured 
at T > 900ºC (at a partial pressure of CO2 of 0.1 MPa). The 
basic separation principle using this carbonation-calcination 
cycle was successfully tested in a pilot plant (40 tonne d-1) for 
the� development� of� the� Acceptor� Coal� Gasification� Process�
(Curran et al.,�1967)�using�two�interconnected�fluidized�beds.�
The use of the above cycle for a post-combustion system 
was�first�proposed�by�Shimizu�et al. (1999) and involved the 
regeneration� of� the� sorbent� in� a� fluidized� bed,� firing� part� of�
the fuel with O2/CO2 mixtures (see also Section 3.4.2). The 
effective capture of CO2 by CaO has been demonstrated in 
a� small� pilot� fluidized� bed� (Abanades� et al., 2004a). Other 
combustion cycles incorporating capture of CO2 with CaO 
that might not need O2 are being developed, including one that 
works at high pressures with simultaneous capture of CO2 and 
SO2 (Wang et al., 2004). One weak point in all these processes 
is that natural sorbents (limestones and dolomites) deactivate 
rapidly,�and�a�large�make-up�flow�of�sorbent�(of�the�order�of�
the�mass�flow�of�fuel�entering�the�plant)�is�required�to�maintain�
the activity in the capture-regeneration loop (Abanades et al., 
2004b).�Although�the�deactivated�sorbent�may�find�application�
in the cement industry and the sorbent cost is low, a range of 
methods to enhance the activity of Ca-based CO2 sorbents are 
being pursued by several groups around the world.
3.3.4 
Status and outlook
Virtually all the energy we use today from carbon-containing 
fuels is obtained by directly burning fuels in air. This is despite 
many� decades� of� exploring� promising� and� more� efficient�
alternative energy conversion cycles that rely on other fuel 
processing steps prior to fuel combustion or avoiding direct 
fuel combustion (see pre-combustion capture – Section 3.5). In 
particular, combustion-based systems are still the competitive 
choice for operators aiming at large-scale production of 
electricity and heat from fossil fuels, even under more demanding 
environmental regulations, because these processes are reliable 
and well proven in delivering electricity and heat at prices that 
often set a benchmark for these services. In addition, there is 
a�continued�effort�to�raise�the�energy�conversion�efficiencies�
of these systems through advanced materials and component 
development. This will allow these systems to operate at higher 
temperature�and�higher�efficiency.�
 
As was noted in Section 3.1, the main systems of reference 
for post-combustion capture are the present installed capacity 
of coal and natural gas power plants, with a total of 970 GWe 
subcritical steam and 155 GWe of supercritical/ultra-supercritical 
steam-based�pulverized�coal�fired�plants,�339�GWe of natural 
gas combined cycle, 333 GWe natural gas steam-electric power 
plants and 17 GWe� of� coal-fired,� circulating,� fluidized-bed�
combustion (CFBC) power plants. An additional capacity of 
454 GWe�of�oil-based�power�plant,�with�a�significant�proportion�
of� these� operating� in� an� air-firing� mode� is� also� noted� (IEA�
WEO, 2004 and IEA CCC, 2005). Current projections indicate 
that�the�generation�efficiency�of�commercial,�pulverized�coal�
fired� power� plants� based� on� ultra-supercritical� steam� cycles�
would exceed 50% lower heating value (LHV) over the next 
decade� (IEA,� 2004),� which� will� be� higher� than� efficiencies�
of between 36 and 45% reported for current subcritical and 
supercritical steam-based plants without capture (see Section 
3.7). Similarly,�natural�gas�fired�combined�cycles�are�expected�
to�have�efficiencies�of�65%�by�2020�(IEA�GHG,�2002b)�and up 
from�current�efficiencies�between�55�and�58%�(see�Section�3.7).�
In a future carbon-constrained world, these independent and 
ongoing�developments�in�power�cycle�efficiencies will result 
in lower CO2-emissions per kWh produced and hence a lower 
loss in overall cycle efficiency�when�post-combustion�capture�
is applied.
 
There are proven post-combustion CO2 capture technologies 
based on absorption processes that are commercially available 
at present . They produce CO2�from�flue�gases�in�coal�and�gas-
fired�installations�for�food/beverage�applications�and�chemicals�
production in capacity ranges between 6 and 800 tCO2 d-1. They 
require scale up to 20-50 times that of current unit capacities 
for deployment in large-scale power plants in the 500 MWe 
capacity range (see Section 3.3.2). The inherent limitations 
of currently available absorption technologies when applied 
to post-combustion capture systems are well known and their 
impact on system cost can be estimated relatively accurately for 
122
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
a given application (see Section 3.7). Hence, with the dominant 
role played by air- blown energy conversion processes in the 
global energy infrastructure, the availability of post-combustion 
capture systems is important if CO2 capture and storage becomes 
a viable climate change mitigation strategy.
 
The intense development efforts on novel solvents for 
improved performance and reduced energy consumption 
during regeneration, as well as process designs incorporating 
new contacting devices such as hybrid membrane-absorbent 
systems, solid adsorbents and high temperature regenerable 
sorbents,� may� lead� to� the� use� of� more� energy� efficient� post-
combustion capture systems. However, all these novel concepts 
still need to prove their lower costs and reliability of operation 
on a commercial scale. The same considerations also apply to 
other advanced CO2 capture concepts with oxy-fuel combustion 
or pre-combustion capture reviewed in the following sections of 
this chapter. It is generally not yet clear which of these emerging 
technologies, if any, will succeed as the dominant commercial 
technology for energy systems incorporating CO2 capture. 
3.4 
 Oxy-fuel combustion capture systems
3.4.1 
Introduction 
The oxy-fuel combustion process eliminates nitrogen from the 
flue�gas�by�combusting�a�hydrocarbon�or�carbonaceous�fuel�in�
either pure oxygen or a mixture of pure oxygen and a CO2-
rich� recycled� flue� gas� (carbonaceous� fuels� include� biomass).�
Combustion of a fuel with pure oxygen has a combustion 
temperature of about 3500°C which is far too high for typical 
power plant materials. The combustion temperature is limited 
to about 1300-1400°C in a typical gas turbine cycle and to 
about� 1900°C� in� an� oxy-fuel� coal-fired� boiler� using� current�
technology. The combustion temperature is controlled by the 
proportion� of� flue� gas� and� gaseous� or� liquid-water� recycled�
back to the combustion chamber.
�
The� combustion� products� (or� flue� gas)� consist� mainly� of�
carbon dioxide and water vapour together with excess oxygen 
required to ensure complete combustion of the fuel. It will also 
contain any other components in the fuel, any diluents in the 
oxygen stream supplied, any inerts in the fuel and from air 
leakage�into�the�system�from�the�atmosphere.�The�net�flue�gas,�
after cooling to condense water vapour, contains from about 
80-98% CO2 depending on the fuel used and the particular 
oxy-fuel combustion process. This concentrated CO2 stream 
can�be�compressed,�dried�and�further�purified�before�delivery�
into a pipeline for storage (see Chapter 4). The CO2 capture 
efficiency�is�very�close�to�100%�in�oxy-fuel�combustion�capture�
systems. Impurities in the CO2 are gas components such as SOx, 
NOx, HCl and Hg derived from the fuel used, and the inert 
gas components, such as nitrogen, argon and oxygen, derived 
from the oxygen feed or air leakage into the system. The CO2 
is transported by pipeline as a dense supercritical phase. Inert 
gases must be reduced to a low concentration to avoid two-
phase� flow� conditions� developing� in� the� pipeline� systems.�
The acid gas components may need to be removed to comply 
with legislation covering co-disposal of toxic or hazardous 
waste or to avoid operations or environmental problems with 
disposal in deep saline reservoirs, hydrocarbon formations or 
in the ocean. The carbon dioxide must also be dried to prevent 
water condensation and corrosion in pipelines and allow use of 
conventional carbon-steel materials.
 
Although elements of oxy-fuel combustion technologies 
are in use in the aluminium, iron and steel and glass melting 
industries today, oxy-fuel technologies for CO2 capture have 
yet�to�be�deployed�on�a�commercial�scale.�Therefore,�the�first�
classification� between� existing technologies and emerging 
technologies adopted in post-combustion (Section 3.3) and 
pre-combustion (Section 3.5) is not followed in this section. 
However, it is important to emphasize that the key separation 
step in most oxy-fuel capture systems (O2 from air) is an 
‘existing technology’ (see Section 3.4.5). Current methods 
of oxygen production by air separation comprise cryogenic 
distillation, adsorption using multi-bed pressure swing units and 
polymeric membranes. For oxy-fuel conversions requiring less 
than 200 tO2 d-1, the adsorption system will be economic. For 
all the larger applications, which include power station boilers, 
cryogenic air separation is the economic solution (Wilkinson et 
al., 2003a). 
 
In the following sections we present the main oxy-fuel 
combustion� systems� classified� according� to� how� the� heat� of�
combustion�is�supplied�and�whether�the�flue�gas�is�used�as�a�
working�fluid�(Sections�3.4.2,�3.4.3,�3.4.4).�A�brief�overview�
of O2 production methods relevant for these systems is given 
(Section 3.4.5). In Section 3.4.6, the emerging technology 
of chemical looping combustion is presented, in which pure 
oxygen is supplied by a metal oxide rather than an oxygen 
production process. The section on oxy-fuel systems closes with 
an overview of the status of the technology (Section 3.4.7).
3.4.2 
Oxy-fuel indirect heating - steam cycle
In these systems, the oxy-fuel combustion chamber provides 
heat�to�a�separate�fluid�by�heat�transfer�through�a�surface.�It�can�
be used for either process heating, or in a boiler with a steam 
cycle for power generation. The indirect system can be used 
with any hydrocarbon or carbon-containing fuel.
 
The application of oxy-fuel indirect heating for CO2 
capture in process heating and power generation has been 
examined in both pilot-scale trials evaluating the combustion 
of carbonaceous fuels in oxygen and CO2-rich�recycled�flue�gas�
mixtures and engineering assessments of plant conversions as 
described below.
3.4.2.1 
Oxy-fuel combustion trials
Work to demonstrate the application of oxy-fuel recycle 
combustion in process heating and for steam generation for use 
in steam power cycles have been mostly undertaken in pilot 
scale tests that have looked at the combustion, heat transfer and 
pollutant-forming behaviour of natural gas and coal. 
 
One study carried out (Babcock Energy Ltd. et al., 1995) 
included�an�oxy-fuel�test�with�flue�gas�recycle�using�a�160kW,�
Chapter 3: Capture of CO2
123
pulverized coal, low NOx burner. The system included a 
heat-transfer test section to simulate fouling conditions. Test 
conditions� included� variation� in� recycle� flow� and� excess� O2 
levels. Measurements included all gas compositions, ash analysis 
and tube fouling after a 5-week test run. The work also included 
a case study on oxy-fuel operation of a 660 MW power boiler 
with CO2�capture,�compression�and�purification.�The�main�test�
results were that NOx levels reduced with increase in recycle 
rate, while SO2 and carbon in ash levels were insensitive to the 
recycle rate. Fouling in the convective test section was greater 
with�oxy-fuel�firing�than�with�air.�High-slagging�UK�coal�had�
worse�slagging�when�using�oxy-fuel�firing,�the�higher�excess�O2 
level lowered carbon in ash and CO concentration. 
 
For the combustion of pulverized coal, other pilot-scale tests 
by�Croiset�and�Thambimuthu�(2000)�have�reported�that�the�flame�
temperature and heat capacity of gases to match fuel burning in 
air occurs when the feed gas used in oxy-fuel combustion has 
a composition of approximately 35% by volume O2 and 65% 
by volume of dry recycled CO2 (c.f. 21% by volume O2 and 
the rest nitrogen in air). In practice, the presence of inerts such 
as�ash�and�inorganic�components�in�the�coal,�the�specific�fuel�
composition and moisture in the recycled gas stream and the 
coal feed will result in minor adjustments to this feed mixture 
composition�to�keep�the�flame�temperature�at�a�value�similar�to�
fuel combustion in air. 
 
At conditions that match O2/CO2 recycle combustion to fuel 
burning in air, coal burning is reported to be complete (Croiset 
and Thambimuthu, 2000), with operation of the process at 
excess O2�levels�in�the�flue�gas�as�low�as�1-3%�by�volume�O2, 
producing�a�flue�gas�stream�of�95-98%�by�volume�dry�CO2 (the 
rest being excess O2, NOx, SOx and argon) when a very high 
purity O2 stream is used in the combustion process with zero 
leakage of ambient air into the system. No differences were 
detected�in�the�fly�ash�formation�behaviour�in�the�combustor�or�
SO2�emissions�compared�to�conventional�air�firing�conditions.�
For NOx on the other hand, emissions were lower due to zero 
thermal NOx formation from the absence of nitrogen in the 
feed gas - with the partial recycling of NOx also reducing the 
formation and net emissions originating from the fuel bound 
nitrogen. Other studies have demonstrated that the level of NOx 
reduction is as high as 75% compared to coal burning in air 
(Chatel-Pelage et al., 2003). Similar data for natural gas burning 
in O2/CO2 recycle mixtures report zero thermal NOx emissions 
in the absence of air leakage into the boiler, with trace amounts 
produced as thermal NOx when residual nitrogen is present in 
the natural gas feed (Tan et al., 2002).
�
The�above�and�other�findings�show�that�with�the�application�
of�oxy-fuel�combustion�in�modified�utility�boilers,�the�nitrogen-
free�combustion�process�would�benefit�from�higher�heat�transfer�
rates (McDonald and Palkes, 1999), and if also constructed 
with higher temperature tolerant materials, are able to operate 
at�higher�oxygen�concentration�and�lower�flue�gas�recycle�flows�
–�both�of�which�will�considerably�reduce�overall�volume�flows�
and size of the boiler. 
�
It�should�be�noted�that�even�when�deploying�a�2/3�flue�gas�
recycle gas ratio to maintain a 35% by volume O2 feed to a 
pulverized�coal�fired�boiler,�hot�recycling�of�the�flue�gas�prior�
to CO2�purification�and�compression�also�reduces�the�size�of�
all unit operations in the stream leaving the boiler to 1/5 that 
of similar equipment deployed in conventional air blown 
combustion systems (Chatel-Pelage et al., 2003). Use of a low 
temperature� gas� purification� step� prior� to� CO2 compression 
(see Section 3.4.2.2) will also eliminate the need to deploy 
conventional selective catalytic reduction for NOx removal and 
flue�gas�desulphurization�to�purify�the�gas,�a�practice�typically�
adopted in conventional air-blown combustion processes (see 
Figure�3.3).�The�overall�reduction�in�flow�volumes,�equipment�
scale�and�simplification�of�gas�purification�steps�will�thus�have�
the� benefit� of� reducing� both� capital� and� operating� costs� of�
equipment�deployed�for�combustion,�heat�transfer�and�final�gas�
purification�in�process�and�power�plant�applications�(Marin�et 
al., 2003).
 
As noted above for pulverized coal, oil, natural gas and 
biomass� combustion,� fluidized� beds� could� also� be� fired� with�
O2 instead of air to supply heat for the steam cycle. The 
intense� solid� mixing� in� a� fluidized� bed� combustion� system�
can provide very good temperature control even in highly 
exothermic� conditions,� thereby� minimizing� the� need� for� flue�
gas recycling. In principle, a variety of commercial designs for 
fluidized�combustion�boilers�exist�that�could�be�retrofitted�for�
oxygen�firing.�A�circulating�fluidized�bed�combustor�with�O2 
firing�was�proposed�by�Shimizu�et al. (1999) to generate the

Assessments of plants converted to oxy-fuel 
combustion
We now discuss performance data from a recent comprehensive 
design study for an application of oxy-fuel combustion in a new 
build�pulverized�coal�fired�power�boiler�using�a�supercritical�
steam cycle (see Figure 3.8; Dillon et al., 2005). The overall 
thermal�efficiency�on�a�lower�heating�value�basis�is�reduced�
from 44.2% to 35.4%. The net power output is reduced from 
677 MWe to 532 MWe. 
Important features of the system include:

the oxidant in the boiler. The cryogenic oxygen plant will, 
in this case, produce 95% O2 purity to minimize power 
consumption and capital cost.
• 
The low temperature (-55°C) CO2� purification� plant�
(Wilkinson et al., 2003b) integrated with the CO2 compressor 
will not only remove excess O2, N2, argon but can also 
remove all NOx and SO2 from the CO2 stream, if high 
purity CO2�is�required�for�storage.�Significantly,�removal�of�
these�components�before�final�CO2 compression eliminates 
the need to otherwise incorporate upstream NOx and SOx

SOx concentrations in the boiler and reduced NOx levels. 
Suitable corrosion resistant materials of construction must 
be chosen.
•�
The� overall� heat� transfer� is� improved� in� oxy-fuel� firing�
because of the higher emissivity of the CO2/H2O gas mixture 
in the boiler compared to nitrogen and the improved heat 
transfer in the convection section. These improvements, 
together�with�the�recycle�of�hot�flue�gas,�increase�the�boiler�

The�overall�thermal�efficiency�is�improved�by�running�the�

compression heat for boiler feed water heating prior to 
de-aeration.
Engineering studies have also been reported by Simbeck and 
McDonald (2001b) and by McDonald and Palkes (1999). 
This�work�has�confirmed�that�the�concept�of�retrofitting�oxy-
fuel combustion with CO2�capture�to�existing�coal-fired�power�
stations does not have any technical barriers and can make use 
of existing technology systems. 
 
It has been reported (Wilkinson et al., 2003b) that the 
application� of� oxy-fuel� technology� for� the� retrofit� of� power�
plant� boilers� and� a� range� of� refinery� heaters� in� a� refinery�
complex� (Grangemouth� refinery� in� Scotland)� is� technically�
feasible at a competitive cost compared to other types of 
CO2 capture technologies. In this case, the existing boiler is 
adapted�to�allow�combustion�of�refinery�gas�and�fuel�oil�with�
highly�enriched�oxygen�and�with�partial�flue�gas�recycling�for�
temperature control. Oxy-fuel boiler conversions only needed 
minor� burner� modifications,� a� new� O2 injection system and 
controls,�and�a�new�flue�gas�recycle�line�with�a�separate�blower.�
These�are�cheap�and�relatively�simple�modifications�and�result�
in� an� increase� in� boiler/heater� thermal� efficiency� due� to� the�
recycle�of�hot�gas.�Modifications�to�a�coal-fired�boiler�are�more�
complex. In this study, it was found to be more economic to 
design the air separation units for only 95% O2 purity instead 
of 99.5% to comply with practical levels of air leakage into 
boilers and to separate the associated argon and nitrogen in 
the CO2 inert gas removal system to produce a purity of CO2 
suitable for geological storage. After conversion of the boiler, 
the CO2�concentration�in�the�flue�gas�increases�from�17�to�60%�
while the water content increases from 10 to 30%. Impurities 
(SOx, NOx) and gases (excess O2, N2, argon) representing about 
10% of the stream are separated from CO2 at low temperature 
(-55°C). After cooling, compression and drying of the separated 
or� non-recycled� flue� gas,� the� product� for� storage� comprises�
96% CO2 contaminated with 2% N2, 1% argon and less than 
1% O2 and SO2. Production of ultra-pure CO2 for storage would 
also be possible if distillation steps are added to the separation 
process.

Advanced zero emission power plant
The advanced zero emission power plant (or AZEP as outlined in 
Figure�3.9;�Griffin�et al., 2003) is an indirect heating gas turbine 
cycle that incorporates a high-temperature oxygen transport 
membrane, operating at about 800°C -1000°C (see Section 
3.4.5.2). This process uses a standard air-based gas turbine in 
a combined cycle arrangement. Three process steps take place 
in a reactor system that replaces the combustion chamber of 
a standard gas turbine: 1) separation of oxygen from hot air 
using the membrane and transport to the combustion section; 2) 
combustion and 3) heat exchange from the combustion products 
to the compressed air. 
�
A�net�efficiency�for�advanced�zero�emission�power�cycle�of�
around 49–50% LHV is claimed including CO2 compression for 
transport. In order to get full advantage of the potential of the 
most advanced gas turbines, which have inlet temperatures of 
1300°C-1400°C,�an�afterburner�fired�with�natural�gas�in�air�may�
be�added�behind�the�reactor�system.�The�efficiency�then�climbs�
up to 52% but now 15% of the CO2 generated by combustion is 
released at the stack and is not captured.
3.4.3 
Oxy-fuel direct heating - gas turbine cycle
Oxy-fuel combustion takes place in a pressurized CO2-rich 
recirculating�stream�in�a�modified�gas�turbine.�The�hot�gas�is�
expanded in the turbine producing power. The turbine exhaust 
is cooled to provide heat for a steam cycle and water vapour is 
condensed by further cooling. The CO2-rich gas is compressed in 
the compressor section. The net CO2-rich combustion product is 
removed from the system. Only natural gas, light hydrocarbons 
and syngas (CO + H2) can be used as fuel.
3.4.3.1 
Cycle description and performance
Figure 3.10 shows how a gas turbine can be adapted to run 
with�oxy-fuel�firing�using�CO2�as�a�working�fluid.�Exhaust�gas�
leaving the heat recovery steam generator is cooled to condense 
water. The net CO2 product is removed and the remaining gas is 
recycled to the compressor. Suitable fuels are natural gas, light 
to medium hydrocarbons or (H2 + CO) syngas, which could be 
derived from coal. The use of CO2�as�the�working�fluid�in�the�
turbine will necessitate a complete redesign of the gas turbine 
(see Section 3.4.3.2). A recent study (Dillon et al., 2005) gives 
an�overall�efficiency�including�CO2 compression of 45%.
�
Two�typical�variants�of�this�configuration�are�the�so-called�
Matiant and Graz cycles (Mathieu, 2003; Jericha et al., 2003). 
The Matiant cycle uses CO2�as�the�working�fluid,�and�consists�
of features like intercooled compressor and turbine reheat. The 
exhaust gas is preheating the recycled CO2 in a heat exchanger. 
The CO2 generated in combustion is extracted from the cycle 
behind� the� compressor.� The� net� overall� LHV� efficiency� is�
expected to be 45-47% and can increase above 50% in a 
combined�cycle�configuration�similar�to�that�shown�in�Figure�
3.10. The Graz cycle consists of an integrated gas turbine and 
steam�turbine�cycle.�A�net�LHV�efficiency�of�above�50%�has�
been calculated for this cycle (Jericha et al., 2003).
 
A recent comprehensive review of gas turbine cycles with 
CO2� capture� provides� efficiencies� of� different� cycles� on� a�
common basis (Kvamsdal et al., 2004).
3.4.3.2 
The CO2/oxy-fuel gas turbine
In existing gas turbines the molecular weight of the gases in 
the compressor and turbine are close to that of air (28.8). In the 
case of oxy-fuel combustion with CO2-recycle the compressor 
fluid�molecular�weight�is�about�43�and�about�40�in�the�turbine.�
The�change�in�working�fluid�from�air�to�a�CO2-rich gas results 
in a number of changes in properties that are of importance for 
the design of the compressor, combustor and the hot gas path 
including the turbine:
• 
The speed of sound is 80% of air;
• 
The gas density is 50% higher than air;
•�
The�specific�heat�ratio�is�lower�than�air�resulting�in�a�lower�
temperature change on adiabatic compression or expansion. 
An oxy-fuel gas turbine in a combined cycle has a higher 
optimal pressure ratio, typically 30 to 35 compared to 15 
Figure 3.9 Principle�flow�scheme�of�the�advanced�zero�emission�power�plant�cycle.
126
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
to 18 used with air in a combined cycle system. With the 
highest turbine inlet temperature consistent with material 
limitations, the rather high-pressure ratio results in an 
exhaust gas temperature of about 600°C, which is optimal 
for the steam cycle.
These changes in the fundamental properties of the working 
fluid�will�have�a�significant�impact�on�gas�turbine�components,�
requiring completely new designs of compressors, combustors 
(to account for aerodynamic changes and acoustic feedbacks) 
and hot gas path (O2 partial pressure must be low in oxy-fuel 
systems but it is also important to avoid reducing conditions for 
the materials of the turbine or the change to materials allowing 
much lower O2 partial pressures).
3.4.4 
Oxy-fuel direct heating - steam turbine cycle
In an oxy-fuel steam turbine cycle, water is pressurized as a 
liquid and is then evaporated, heated by the direct injection 
and combustion of a fuel with pure oxygen and expanded in a 
turbine. Most of the water in the low pressure turbine exhaust 
gas is cooled and condensed, prior to pumping back to a high 
pressure while the CO2 produced from combustion is removed 
and compressed for pipeline transport. A variant of this cycle in 
which the heat is provided by burning natural gas fuel in-situ 
with pure oxygen was proposed by Yantovskii et al. (1992). 
 
The direct combustion of fuel and oxygen has been practised 
for many years in the metallurgical and glass industries where 
burners� operate� at� near� stoichiometric� conditions� with� flame�
temperatures of up to 3500°C. A water quenched H2/O2 burner 
capable of producing 60 tonne h-1, 6 MPa super heated steam 
was demonstrated in the mid-1980s (Ramsaier et al., 1985). A 
recent development by Clean Energy Systems incorporating 
these concepts where a mixture of 90 % by volume superheated 
steam and 10% CO2 is produced at high temperature and 
pressure to power conventional or advanced steam turbines 
is shown in Figure 3.11. The steam is condensed in a low- 
pressure condenser and recycled, while CO2 is extracted from 
the�condenser,�purified�and�compressed.�(Anderson�et al., 2003 
and Marin et al., 2003).
 
Plants of this type require a clean gaseous or liquid fuel 
and will operate at 20 to 50 MPa pressure. The steam plus 
CO2 generator is very compact. Control systems must be very 
precise�as�start-up�and�increase�to�full�flow�in�a�preheated�plant�
can take place in less than 2 seconds. Precise control of this very 
rapid start was demonstrated (Ramsaier et al., 1985) in a 60 
tonne steam h-1 unit. The Clean Energy Systems studies claim 
efficiencies�as�high�as�55%�with�CO2 capture depending on the 
process conditions used.
 
The Clean Energy Systems technology can be initially 
applied with current steam turbines (565°C inlet temperature). 
The main technical issue is clearly the design of the steam 
turbines which could be used at inlet temperatures up to 1300°C 
by applying technology similar to that used in the hot path 
of gas turbines. The combustor itself (the ‘gas generator’) is 
adapted from existing rocket engine technology. In 2000, Clean 
Energy Systems proved the concept with a 110 kW pilot project 
conducted at the University of California Davis. A 20 MW 
thermal gas generator was successfully operated in a test run 
of the order of a few minutes in early 2003. A zero emissions 
demonstration plant (up to 6 MW electrical) is now on-line. US 
Department of Energy’s National Energy Technology Laboratory 
designed the reheater (Richards, 2003) and NASA tested it in 
2002. Much more technology development and demonstration

control the temperature entering the turbine.

3.4.5 
Techniques and improvements in oxygen 
production
Oxygen is the key requirement for any oxy-fuel combustion 
system. It is also a key technology for pre-combustion CO2 
capture (see Section 3.5). In the next paragraphs, existing large-
scale O2�production�methods�are�described�first,�followed�by�
emerging concepts aimed at reducing the energy consumption 
and cost.
3.4.5.1  
Cryogenic oxygen production
The very large quantities of oxygen required for CO2 capture 
using the techniques of oxy-fuel combustion and pre-combustion 
de-carbonization can only be economically produced, at present, 
by using the established process of oxygen separation from air 
by distillation at cryogenic temperatures (Latimer, 1967). This 
is a technology that has been practiced for over 100 years.
 
In a typical cryogenic air separation plant (Castle, 1991; 
Figure 3.12), air is compressed to a pressure of 0.5 to 0.6 MPa 
and�purified�to�remove�water,�CO2, N2O and trace hydrocarbons 
which could accumulate to dangerous levels in oxygen-rich 
parts of the plant, such as the reboiler condenser. Two or 
more� switching� fixed� bed� adsorbers� are� used,� which� can� be�
regenerated by either temperature or pressure swing, using 
in each case, a low pressure waste nitrogen stream. The air is 
cooled against returning products (oxygen and nitrogen) in a 
battery�of�aluminium�plate-fin�heat�exchangers�and�separated�
into pure oxygen and nitrogen fractions in a double distillation 
column, which uses aluminium packing.
 
Oxygen can be pumped as liquid and delivered as a high-
pressure gas at up to 10 MPa. Pumped oxygen plants have 
largely replaced the oxygen gas compression systems. They 
have virtually identical power consumptions but in a pumped 
cycle, a high-pressure air booster compressor provides a means 
of�efficiently�vaporizing�and�heating�the�liquid�oxygen�stream�
to ambient temperature. Current plant sizes range up to 3500 
tO2 d-1 and larger single train plants are being designed. Typical 
power consumption for the delivery of 95% O2 at low pressure 
(0.17 MPa, a typical pressure for an oxy-fuel application) is 200 
to 240 kWh/tO2. There are numerous process cycle variations 
particularly for the production of oxygen at less than 97.5% 
purity which have been developed to reduce power and capital 
cost. Note that adsorption and polymeric membrane methods of 
air separation are only economic for small oxygen production 
rates.
3.4.5.2 
High temperature oxygen ion transport membranes
Ceramic mixed metal oxides have been developed which 
exhibit simultaneous oxygen ion and electron conduction at 
Figure 3.11 Principle of the Clean Energy Systems cycle. The combustion of the fuel and oxygen is cooled by injection of liquid-water, which 
is recycled in the process.
128
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
temperatures above 500°C and preferably above 700°C (Skinner 
and Kilner 2003; Bouwmeester and Van Laar, 2002; Dyer et 
al., 2000; Bredesen et al., 2004). Typical crystal structures 
which exhibit these properties include the perovskites and the 
brownmillerites. The selectivity of these materials for oxygen is 
infinite.�The�oxygen�permeability�is�primarily�controlled�by�the�
oxygen ion vacancies in the metal oxide lattice. A difference in 
oxygen partial pressure across the membrane will cause oxygen 
molecules to ionize on the ceramic surface and pass into the 
crystal structure while simultaneously on the permeate side 
of the membrane, the oxygen ions give up their electrons and 
leave the ceramic in the region of lower activity. The electron 
conduction path is through the metal ions in the lattice. Unlike 
conventional� membranes,� the� flux� through� the� ceramic� is� a�
function of the partial pressure ratio. In the technical literature, 
the engineered structures of these ceramic mixed metal oxides 
are referred to as ion transport membranes, ITM or oxygen 
transport membranes, OTM.
 
The oxygen transport membrane can be fabricated in the 
form�of�plain�tubes�or�as�hollow�fins�on�a�central�collector�tube�
(Armstrong et al.,�2002).�The�finned�elements�are�then�mounted�
in tube sheets within a pressure vessel with high-pressure air 
flowing�over�the�fins.�There�are�several�new�concepts�that�have�
been proposed for using oxygen transport membranes in power 
cycles with CO2 capture. A prime example of an oxy-fuel gas 
turbine cycle that incorporates an oxygen transport membrane 
for oxygen production is the advanced zero emission power 
plant described in Section 3.4.2.3. Another example is found in 
Sundnes (1998).
Development status
Oxygen transport membrane systems for oxygen production 
are currently in the early stages of development by at least two 
consortia receiving research funding from the US Department 
of Energy and the European Commission. The concept has now

reached the pilot plant stage and projected cost, manufacturing 
procedures and performance targets for full size systems have 
been evaluated. Systems capable of large-scale production are 
projected to be available after industrial demonstration in about 
7 years time (Armstrong et al., 2002).
3.4.6 
Chemical looping combustion
Originally proposed by Richter and Knoche (1983) and with 
subsequent�significant�contributions�by�Ishida�and�Jin�(1994),�the�
main idea of chemical looping combustion is to split combustion 
of a hydrocarbon or carbonaceous fuel into separate oxidation 
and reduction reactions by introducing a suitable metal oxide 
as an oxygen carrier to circulate between two reactors (Figure 
3.13).�Separation�of�oxygen�from�air�is�accomplished�by�fixing�
the oxygen as a metal oxide. No air separation plant is required. 
The reaction between fuel and oxygen is accomplished in a 
second reactor by the release of oxygen from the metal oxide in 
a reducing atmosphere caused by the presence of a hydrocarbon 
or carbonaceous fuel. The recycle rate of the solid material 
between the two reactors and the average solids residence time 
in each reactor, control the heat balance and the temperature 
levels in each reactor. The effect of having combustion in two 
reactors compared to conventional combustion in a single stage 
is that the CO2 is not diluted with nitrogen gas, but is almost pure 
after separation from water, without requiring any extra energy 
demand and costly external equipment for CO2 separation.
 
Possible metal oxides are some oxides of common transition-
state metals, such as iron, nickel, copper and manganese (Zafar 
et al., 2005). The metal/metal oxide may be present in various 
forms, but most studies so far have assumed the use of particles 
with diameter 100-500 µm. In order to move particles between 
the�two�reactors,�the�particles�are�fluidized.�This�method�also�
ensures�efficient�heat�and�mass�transfer�between�the�gases�and�
the particles. A critical issue is the long-term mechanical and 
chemical stability of the particles that have to undergo repeated 
cycles of oxidation and reduction, to minimize the make-up 
requirement. When a chemical looping cycle is used in a gas 
turbine cycle, the mechanical strength for crushing and the 
filtration�system�is�important�to�avoid�damaging�carry-over�to�
the turbine.
 
The temperature in the reactors, according to available 
information in the literature, may be in the range 800°C-
1200°C. NOx formation at these typical operating temperatures 
will always be low. The fuel conversion in the reduction reactor 
may not be complete, but it is likely (Cho et al., 2002) that 
the concentrations of methane and CO when burning natural 
gas are very small. In order to avoid deposit of carbon in the 
reduction reactor, it is necessary to use some steam together 
with the fuel.
 
The chemical looping principle may be applied either in 
a gas turbine cycle with pressurized oxidation and reduction 
reactors, or in a steam turbine cycle with atmospheric pressure 
in the reactors. In the case of a gas turbine cycle, the oxidation 
reactor replaces the combustion chamber of a conventional 
gas turbine. The exothermic oxidation reaction provides heat 
for increasing the air temperature entering the downstream 
expansion turbine. In addition, the reduction reactor exit 
stream may also be expanded in a turbine together with steam 
production for power generation. The cooled low pressure CO2 
stream will then be compressed to pipeline pressure. Another 
option is to generate steam using heat transfer surfaces in the 
oxidation�reactor.�Current�circulating�fluidized�bed�combustion�
technology operating at atmospheric pressure in both the 
oxidation and reduction stages necessitates the use of a steam 
turbine cycle for power generation. Using natural gas as fuel 
in a chemical looping combustion cycle which supplies a 
gas turbine combined cycle power plant and delivering CO2 
at atmospheric pressure, the potential for natural gas fuel-to-
electricity�conversion�efficiency�is�estimated�to�be�in�the�range�
45-50% (Brandvoll and Bolland, 2004). Work on chemical 
looping combustion is currently in the pilot plant and materials 
research stage. 
3.4.7 
Status and outlook
Oxy-fuel combustion applied to furnaces, process heaters, 
boilers and power generation systems is feasible since no 
technical�barriers�for�its�implementation�have�been�identified.�
Early use of this capture technology is likely to address 
applications involving indirect heating in power generation and 
process heating (Section 3.4.2), since these options involve the 
minimal� modification� of� technologies� and� infrastructure� that�
have hitherto been already developed for the combustion of 
hydrocarbon or carbonaceous fuels in air. However, several novel 
applications proposed for direct heating in steam turbine cycles 
or gas turbine cycles for power generation (Sections 3.4.3 and 
3.4.4) still require the development of new components such as 
oxy-fuel combustors, higher temperature tolerant components 
such as CO2- and H2O-based turbines with blade cooling, CO2 
compressors and high temperature ion transport membranes for 
oxygen separation. As for Chemical Looping Combustion, it is 
currently still at an early stage of development.

The energy penalty for producing oxygen is by far the most 
important� cause� for� reduced� efficiency� in� an� oxy-fuel� cycle�
compared to a conventional power plant.

Future oxy-fuel demonstration plants could be based on 
retrofits� to� existing� equipment� such� as� process� heaters� and�

early market entry. In this respect, power systems of reference 
for oxy-fuel combustion capture are mainly the steam-based

represent up to 1468 GWe, or 40% (IEA WEO, 2004) of the 
existing global infrastructure (see also Section 3.1.2.3). Several 
demonstration units may be expected within the next few years 
particularly in Europe, USA, Canada and Australia where 
active research initiatives are currently underway. As these 
developments proceed and the technologies achieve market 
penetration they may become competitive relative to alternate 
options based on pre- and post-combustion CO2 capture. A 
significant�incentive�to�the�development�of�oxy-fuel�combustion�
technology, as well as for pre- and post-combustion capture 
technologies, is the introduction of environmental requirements 
and/or�fiscal�incentives�to�promote�CO2 capture and storage.

 Pre-combustion capture systems
3.5.1 
Introduction
A�pre-combustion�capture�process�typically�comprises�a�first�
stage of reaction producing a mixture of hydrogen and carbon 
monoxide (syngas) from a primary fuel. The two main routes 
are to add steam (reaction 1), in which case the process is called 
‘steam reforming’, or oxygen (reaction 2) to the primary fuel. 
In the latter case, the process is often called ‘partial oxidation’ 
when� applied� to� gaseous� and� liquid� fuels� and� ‘gasification’�
when applied to a solid fuel, but the principles are the same.
Steam reforming
CxHy + xH2O ↔  xCO + (x+y/2)H2 ∆H +ve 
(1)
Partial oxidation
CxHy + x/2O2 ↔  xCO + (y/2)H2 
∆H –ve 
(2)
This is followed by the ‘shift’ reaction to convert CO to CO2 by 
the addition of steam (reaction 3):
Water Gas Shift Reaction
CO + H2O  ↔  CO2 + H2 
∆H -41 kJ mol-1 (3)
Finally, the CO2 is removed from the CO2/H2 mixture. The 
concentration of CO2 in the input to the CO2/H2 separation stage 
can be in the range 15-60% (dry basis) and the total pressure 
is typically 2-7 MPa. The separated CO2 is then available for 
storage.
 
It is possible to envisage two applications of pre-combustion 
capture.� The� first� is� in� producing� a� fuel� (hydrogen)� that� is�
essentially carbon-free. Although the product H2 does not need 
to be absolutely pure and may contain low levels of methane, 
CO or CO2, the lower the level of carbon-containing compounds, 
the greater the reduction in CO2 emissions. The H2 fuel may also 
contain inert diluents, such as nitrogen (when air is typically 
used for partial oxidation), depending on the production process 
and�can�be�fired�in�a�range�of�heaters,�boilers,�gas�turbines�or�
fuel cells.
 
Secondly, pre-combustion capture can be used to reduce the 
carbon content of fuels, with the excess carbon (usually removed 
as CO2) being made available for storage. For example, when 
using a low H:C ratio fuel such as coal it is possible to gasify 
the coal and to convert the syngas to liquid Fischer-Tropsch 
fuels and chemicals which have a higher H:C ratio than coal. In 
this section, we consider both of these applications.
 
This section reports on technologies for the production of H2 
with CO2 capture that already exist and those that are currently 
emerging. It also describes enabling technologies that need to 
be developed to enhance the pre-combustion capture systems 
for power, hydrogen or synfuels and chemicals production or 
combination of all three.
3.5.2 
Existing technologies
3.5.2.1 
Steam reforming of gas and light hydrocarbons
Steam reforming is the dominant technology for hydrogen 
production today and the largest single train plants produce up 
to 480 tH2 d-1. The primary energy source is often natural gas, 
Then the process is referred to as steam methane reforming 
(SMR), but can also be other light hydrocarbons, such as 
naphtha. The process begins with the removal of sulphur 
compounds from the feed, since these are poisons to the current 
nickel-based catalyst and then steam is added. The reforming 
reaction (1), which is endothermic, takes place over a catalyst at 
high temperature (800°C-900°C). Heat is supplied to the reactor 
tubes by burning part of the fuel (secondary fuel). The reformed 
gas is cooled in a waste heat boiler which generates the steam 
needed for the reactions and passed into the CO shift system. 
Shift reactors in one or two stages are used to convert most of 
the CO in the syngas to CO2 (Reaction 3, which is exothermic). 
Chapter 3: Capture of CO2
131
The conventional two-stage CO conversion reduces the CO 
concentration in syngas (or in hydrogen) down to 0.2-0.3%. 
High temperature shift reactors operating between 400°C and 
550°C and using an iron-chromium catalyst leave between 2% 
and 3% CO in the exit gas (dry basis). Copper-based catalyst 
can be used at temperatures from 180°C-350°C and leave from 
0.2-1% CO in the exhaust. Lower CO content favours higher 
CO2 recovery. The gas is then cooled and hydrogen is produced 
by a CO2/H2 separation step. Until about 30 years ago, the CO2 
was removed using a chemical (solvent) absorption process 
such as an amine or hot potassium carbonate and was rejected 
to atmosphere as a pure stream from the top of the regenerator. 
There are many of these plants still in use and the CO2 could be 
captured readily. 
 
Modern plants, however, use a pressure swing adsorber 
(PSA), where gases other than H2 are adsorbed in a set of 
switching beds containing layers of solid adsorbent such as 
activated carbon, alumina and zeolites (see the fuller description 
of PSA in Section 3.5.2.9). The H2 exiting the PSA (typically 
about 2.2 MPa) can have a purity of up to 99.999%, depending 
on the market need. The CO2 is contained in a stream, from the 
regeneration cycle, which contains some methane and H2. The 
stream is used as fuel in the reformer where it is combusted 
in air and the CO2 ends up being vented to atmosphere in the 
reformer�flue�gas.�Hence,�to�capture�CO2 from modern SMR 
plants would require one of the post-combustion processes 
described above in Section 3.3. Alternatively, the PSA system 
could be designed not only for high recovery of pure H2 but also 
to recover pure CO2 and have a fuel gas as the third product 
stream.
 
In a design study for a large modern plant (total capacity 
720 tH2 d-1),�the�overall�efficiency�of�making�6.0�MPa�H2 from 
natural gas with CO2 vented that is without CO2 capture, is 
estimated to be 76%, LHV basis, with emissions of 9.1 kg CO2/
kg H2�(IEA�GHG,�1996).�The�process�can�be�modified�(at�a�
cost) to provide a nearly pure CO2 co-product. One possibility 
is to remove most of the CO2 from the shifted, cooled syngas in 
a ‘wet’ CO2 removal plant with an appropriate amine solvent. In 
this case the CO2-deficient�syngas�exiting�the�amine�scrubber�is�
passed to a PSA unit from which relatively pure H2 is recovered 
and the PSA purge gases are burned along with additional 
natural gas to provide the needed reformer heat. The CO2 is 
recovered from the amine solvent by heating and pressurized 
for transport. Taking into account the power to compress the 
CO2�(to�11.2�MPa)�reduces�the�efficiency�to�about�73%�and�the�
emission rate to 1.4 kgCO2/kgH2, while the CO2 removal rate is 
8.0 kgCO2/kgH2.
3.5.2.2 
Partial oxidation of gas and light hydrocarbons
In the partial oxidation (POX) process (reaction 2), a fuel reacts 
with pure oxygen at high pressure. The process is exothermic 
and occurs at high temperatures (typically 1250°C-1400°C). 
All the heat required for the syngas reaction is supplied by the 
partial combustion of the fuel and no external heat is required. 
As with SMR, the syngas will be cooled, shifted and the 
CO2 removed from the mixture. The comments made on the 
separation of CO2 from SMR syngas above apply equally to the 
POX process. POX is a technology in common use today, the 
efficiency�is�lower�than�SMR,�but�the�range�of�fuels�that�can�be�
processed is much wider.
 
For large-scale hydrogen production, the oxygen is supplied 
from a cryogenic air separation unit (ASU). The high investment 
and energy consumption of the ASU is compensated by the 
higher�efficiency�and�lower�cost�of�the�gasification�process�and�
the absence of N2 (from the air) in the syngas, which reduces 
the separation costs considerably. However for pre-combustion 
de-carbonization applications, in which the hydrogen would be 
used as fuel in a gas turbine, it will be necessary to dilute the H2 
with either N2�or�steam�to�reduce�flame�temperature�in�the�gas�
turbine combustor and to limit NOx emission levels. In this case 
the�most�efficient�system�will�use�air�as�the�oxidant�and�produce�
a H2/N2 fuel mixture (Hufton et al. 2005)
3.5.2.3 
Auto-thermal reforming of gas and light 
hydrocarbons
The autothermal reforming (ATR) process can be considered 
as a combination of the two processes described above. The 
heat required in the SMR reactor is generated by the partial 
oxidation reaction (2) using air or oxygen, but because steam 
is supplied to the reactor as well as excess natural gas, the 
endothermic reforming reaction (1) occurs in a catalytic section 
of the reactor downstream of the POX burner. The addition of 
steam enables a high conversion of fuel to hydrogen at a lower 
temperature. Operating temperatures of the autothermal process 
are typically 950-1050°C, although this depends on the design 
of the process. An advantage of the process, compared to SMR, 
is the lower investment cost for the reactor and the absence of 
any emissions of CO2 since all heat release is internal, although 
this is largely offset by investment and operating cost for the 
oxygen plant. The range of fuels that can be processed is similar 
to the SMR process, but the feed gas must be sulphur free. 
CO2 capture is accomplished as described above for the steam 
methane reforming.
3.5.2.4 
Gas heated reformer
Each of the three syngas generation technologies, SMR, ATR 
and POX produce high temperature gas which must be cooled, 
producing�in�each�case�a�steam�flow�in�excess�of�that�required�
by the reforming and shift reactions. It is possible to reduce 
this excess production by, for example, using preheated air and 
a pre-reformer in an SMR plant. Another technique is to use 
the hot syngas, leaving the primary reactor, as the shell-side 
heating�fluid�in�a�tubular�steam/hydrocarbon�reforming�reactor�
which can operate in series, or in parallel, with the primary 
reactor (Abbott et al., 2002). The addition of a secondary gas 
heated reformer will increase the hydrogen production by up 
to 33% and eliminate the excess steam production. The overall 
efficiency� is� improved� and� specific� capital� cost� is� typically�
reduced by 15%. Again, CO2 capture is accomplished as 
described previously for steam methane reforming.
3.5.2.5�
Gasification�of�coal,�petroleum�residues,�or�biomass
132
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
Gasification� (see� Figure� 3.14)� is� a� chemical� process� aimed�
at making high-value products (chemicals, electricity, clean 
synthetic fuels) out of low-value solid feedstocks such as 
coal,�oil�refining�residues,�or�biomass.�Gasification�is�basically�
partial oxidation (reaction 2), although steam is also supplied 
to�the�reactor�in�most�processes.�Fixed�bed,�fluidized�bed�or�
entrained� flow� gasifiers� can� be� used.� These� can� have� very�
different characteristics with respect to oxidant (air or O2), 
operating temperature (up to 1350oC), operating pressure (0.1-7 
MPa), feed system (dry or water slurry), syngas cooling method 
(water quench or via radiative and convective heat exchangers) 
and gas clean-up system deployed. These alternative design 
options determine the fraction of feedstock converted to syngas, 
syngas composition and cost. As economics depend strongly on 
scale,�gasification�is�generally�considered�to�be�suitable�only�
for�large�plants.�The�gasifier�output�contains�CO,�H2, CO2, H2O 
and impurities (e.g., N2, COS, H2S, HCN, NH3, volatile trace 
minerals and Hg) that must be managed appropriately. 
�
A� worldwide� survey� of� commercial� gasification� projects�
identified�128�operating�gasification�plants�with�366�gasifiers�
producing 42,700 MWt of syngas (NETL-DOE, 2002 and 
Simbeck, 2001a). There are also about 24,500 MWt of syngas 
projects under development or construction, with 4000-5000 
MWt of syngas added annually. The feedstocks are mainly 
higher�rank�coals�and�oil�residues.�Most�commercial�gasification�
growth�for�the�last�20�years�has�involved�entrained-flow�gasifiers,�
for which there are three competing systems on the market. 
Recent�commercial�gasification�development�has�been�mainly�
with industrial ammonia production, industrial polygeneration 
(in which clean syngas is used to make electricity and steam 
along with premium syngas chemicals) and IGCC power plants. 
Commercial�experience�with�biomass�gasification�and�fluidized�
bed�gasification�has�been�limited.
 
CO2�capture�technology�is�well�established�for�gasification�
systems that make chemicals and synthetic fuels (NETL-DOE, 
2002).�Gasification-based�NH3 plants (many in China) include 
making pure H2 and CO2 separation at rates up to 3500 tCO2 
d-1 per plant. South African plants making Fischer-Tropsch 
fuels and chemicals and a North Dakota plant making synthetic 
natural gas (SNG) from coal also produce large streams of 
nearly pure CO2. Figure 3.15 shows a picture of the North 
Dakota�gasification�plant�in�which�3.3�MtCO2 yr-1 is captured 
using a refrigerated methanol-based, physical solvent scrubbing 
process (Rectisol process, see Section 3.5.2.11 and Table 3.2). 
Most of this captured CO2 is vented and about 1.5 Mtonnes yr-1 
of this stream is currently pipelined to the Weyburn, Canada 
enhanced oil recovery and CO2 storage project (see Chapter 5).
 
When CO2 capture is an objective, O2-blown and high-
pressure systems are preferred because of the higher CO2 partial 
pressures.� De-carbonization� via� gasification� entails� lower�
energy penalties for CO2 capture than does post-combustion 
capture when considering only the separation stage, because 
the CO2 can be recovered at partial pressures up to 3 orders 
of magnitude higher. This greatly reduces CO2 absorber size, 
solvent circulation rates and CO2 stripping energy requirements. 
However, additional energy penalties are incurred in shifting 
the CO in the syngas to CO2 and in other parts of the system 
(see examples for IGCC plant with CO2 capture in Figures 
3.6 and 3.7). Recent analyses for bituminous coals (see, for 
example, IEA GHG, 2003) suggest using simple high-pressure 
Figure 3.14 Simplified�schematic�of�a�gasification�process�showing�options�with�CO2 capture and electricity, hydrogen or chemical production.

entrained-flow�gasifiers�with�water�slurry�feed�and�direct�water�
quench followed by ‘sour’ (sulphur-tolerant) shift reactors and 
finally�co-removal�of�CO2 and H2S by physical absorption. With 
sour�shifting,�hot�raw�syngas�leaving�the�gasifier�requires�only�
one cooling cycle and less processing. Oxygen requirements 
increase� for� slurry� fed� gasifiers� and� conversion� efficiencies�
decline�with�higher�cycle�efficiency�losses�with�quench�cooling.�
Similar trends are also noted with a shift from bituminous to 
lower rank sub-bituminous coal and lignite (Breton and Amick, 
2002). Some analyses (e.g., Stobbs and Clark, 2005) suggest 
that the advantages of pre-combustion over post-combustion 
de-carbonization may be small or disappear for low-rank 
coals� converted� with� entrained-flow� gasifiers.� High-pressure,�
fluidized-bed�gasifiers�may�be�better�suited�for�use�with�low-
rank coals, biomass and various carbonaceous wastes. Although 
there�are�examples�of�successful�demonstration�of�such�gasifiers�
(e.g., the high temperature Winkler, Renzenbrink et al., 1998), 
there has been little commercial-scale operating experience.
 
The H2S in syngas must be removed to levels of tens of 
ppm for IGCC plants for compliance with SO2 emissions 
regulations and to levels much less than 1 ppm for plants that 
make chemicals or synthetic fuels, so as to protect synthesis 
catalysts. If the CO2 must be provided for storage in relatively 
pure�form,�the�common�practice�would�be�to�recover�first�H2S 
(which is absorbed more readily than CO2) from syngas (along 
with a small amount of CO2) in one recovery unit, followed by 
reduction of H2S to elemental sulphur in a Claus plant and tail 
gas clean-up, and subsequent recovery of most of the remaining 
CO2 in a separate downstream unit. An alternative option is to 
recover sulphur in the form of sulphuric acid (McDaniel and 
Hormick, 2002). If H2S/CO2 co-storage is allowed, however, it 
would often be desirable to recover H2S and CO2 in the same 
physical absorption unit, which would lead to moderate system 
cost savings (IEA GHG, 2003; Larson and Ren, 2003; Kreutz 
et al., 2005) especially in light of the typically poor prospects 
for selling byproduct sulphur or sulphuric acid. Although co-
storage of H2S and CO2 is routinely pursued in Western Canada 
as an acid gas management strategy for sour natural gas projects 
(Bachu and Gunter, 2005), it is not yet clear that co-storage 
would�be�routinely�viable�at�large�scales�-�a�typical�gasification-
based energy project would involve an annual CO2 storage rate 
of 1-4 Mtonnes yr-1, whereas the total CO2 storage rate for all 48 
Canadian projects is presently only 0.48 Mtonnes yr-1 (Bachu 
and Gunter, 2005). 
3.5.2.6�
�Integrated�gasification�combined�cycle�(IGCC)�for�
power generation
In� a� coal� IGCC,� syngas� exiting� the� gasifier� is� cleaned� of�
particles, H2S and other contaminants and then burned to make 
electricity via a gas turbine/steam turbine combined cycle. The 
syngas is generated and converted to electricity at the same 
site, both to avoid the high cost of pipeline transport of syngas 
(with a heating value only about 1/3 of that for natural gas) 
and to cost-effectively exploit opportunities for making extra 
power in the combined cycle’s steam turbine using steam from 
syngas cooling. The main drivers for IGCC development were 
originally the prospects of exploiting continuing advances 
in gas turbine technology, the ease of realizing low levels of 
air-pollutant emissions when contaminants are removed from 
syngas, and greatly reduced process stream volumes compared 
to�flue�gas�streams�from�combustion�which�are�at�low�pressure�
and diluted with nitrogen from air. 
 
Since the technology was initially demonstrated in the 
1980s, about 4 GWe of IGCC power plants have been built. 
Most of this capacity is fuelled with oil or petcoke; less than 
1 GWe of the total is designed for coal (IEA CCC, 2005) and 3 
out of 4 plants currently operating on coal and/or petcoke. This 
experience has demonstrated IGCC load-following capability, 
although the technology will probably be used mainly in base 
load applications. All coal-based IGCC projects have been 
subsidized, whereas only the Italian oil-based IGCC projects 
have been subsidized. Other polygeneration projects in Canada, 
the Netherlands and the United States, as well as an oil-based 
IGCC in Japan, have not been subsidized (Simbeck, 2001a). 
 
IGCC has not yet been deployed more widely because of 
strong competition from the natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) 
wherever natural gas is readily available at low prices, because 
coal-based IGCC plants are not less costly than pulverized 
coal� fired� steam-electric� plants� and� because� of� availability�
(reliability) concerns. IGCC availability has improved in recent 
years in commercial-scale demonstration units (Wabash River 
Energy, 2000; McDaniel and Hornick, 2002). Also, availability 
has been better for industrial polygeneration and IGCC projects 
at� oil� refineries� and� chemical� plants� where� personnel� are�
experienced with the chemical processes involved. The recent 
rise in natural gas prices in the USA has also increased interest 
in IGCC.
�
Because�of�the�advantages�for�gasification�of�CO2 capture at 
high partial pressures discussed above, IGCC may be attractive 
for coal power plants in a carbon-constrained world (Karg and 
Hannemann, 2004). CO2 capture for pre-combustion systems 
Figure 3.15  North�Dakota�coal�gasification�plant�with�3.3�MtCO2 
yr−1�capture using a cold methanol, physical solvent process (cluster 
of 4 tall columns in the middle of the picture represent the H2S and 
CO2 capture processes; part of the captured stream is used for EOR 
with CO2 storage in Weyburn, Saskatchewan, Canada).
134
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
is commercially ready, however, no IGCC plant incorporating 
CO2 capture has yet been built. With current technology, average 
estimates of the energy penalties and the impact of increased fuel 
use for CO2 removal are compared with other capture systems 
in Figures 3.6 and 3.7 and show the prospective potential of 
IGCC options. The data in Figures 3.6 and 3.7 also show that 
some IGCC options may be different from others (i.e., slurry 
fed and quench cooled versus dry feed and syngas cooling) and 
their relative merits in terms of the capital cost of plant and the 
delivered cost of power are discussed in Section 3.7.
3.5.2.7 
Hydrogen from coal with CO2 capture
Relative to intensively studied coal IGCC technology with CO2 
capture, there are few studies in the public domain on making H2 
from�coal�via�gasification�with�CO2 capture (NRC, 2004; Parsons 
2002a, b; Gray and Tomlinson, 2003; Chiesa et al., 2005; Kreutz 
et al., 2005), even though this H2 technology is well established 
commercially, as noted above. With commercial technology, 
H2 with CO2�capture�can�be�produced�via�coal�gasification�in�a�
system similar to a coal IGCC plant with CO2 capture. In line 
with the design recommendations for coal IGCC plants described 
above (IEA GHG, 2003), what follows is the description from 
a design study of a coal H2 system that produces, using best 
available technology, 1070 MWt of H2 from high-sulphur (3.4%) 
bituminous coal (Chiesa et al., 2005; Kreutz et al., 2005). In the 
base�case�design,�syngas�is�produced�in�an�entrained�flow�quench�
gasifier�operated�at�7�MPa.�The�syngas�is�cooled,�cleaned�of�
particulate matter, and shifted (to primarily H2 and CO2) in sour 
water gas shift reactors. After further cooling, H2S is removed 
from the syngas using a physical solvent (Selexol). CO2 is then 
removed from the syngas, again using Selexol. After being 
stripped from the solvents, the H2S is converted to elemental S 
in a Claus unit and a plant provides tail gas clean-up to remove 
residual sulphur emissions; and the CO2 is either vented or 
dried and compressed to 150 atm for pipeline transport and 
underground storage. High purity H2 is extracted at 6 MPa from 
the H2-rich syngas via a pressure swing adsorption (PSA) unit. 
The PSA purge gas is compressed and burned in a conventional 
gas turbine combined cycle, generating 78 MWe and 39 MWe of 
electricity in excess of onsite electricity needs in the without and 
with CO2 capture cases, respectively. For this base case analysis, 
the�effective�efficiency�of�H2 manufacture was estimated to be 
64% with CO2 vented and 61% with CO2 captured, while the 
corresponding emission rates are 16.9 kgCO2 and 1.4 kgCO2/
kgH2, respectively. For the capture case, the CO2 removal rate 
was 14.8 kgCO2/kgH2.�Various�alternative�system�configurations�
were explored. It was found that there are no thermodynamic or 
cost advantages from increasing the electricity/H2 output ratio, 
so this ratio would tend to be determined by relative market 
demands for electricity and H2.� One� potentially� significant�
option for reducing the cost of H2 with CO2 capture to about the 
same level as with CO2 vented involves H2S/CO2 co-capture in a 
single Selexol unit, as discussed above.
3.5.2.8�
Carbon-based�fluid�fuels�and�multi-products
As discussed in Chapter 2, clean synthetic high H/C ratio fuels 
can�be�made�from�syngas�via�gasification�of�coal�or�other�low�H/
C ratio feedstocks. Potential products include synthetic natural 
gas, Fischer-Tropsch diesel/gasoline, dimethyl ether, methanol 
and gasoline from methanol via the Mobil process. A byproduct 
is typically a stream of relatively pure CO2 that can be captured 
and stored. 
 
Coal derived Fischer-Tropsch synfuels and chemicals have 
been produced on a commercial scale in South Africa; coal 
methanol is produced in China and at one US plant; and coal SNG 
is produced at a North Dakota (US) plant (NETL-DOE, 2002). 
Since 2000, 1.5 MtCO2 yr-1 from the North Dakota synthetic 
natural gas plant (see Figure 3.15) have been transported by 
pipeline,� 300� km� to� the� Weyburn� oil� field� in� Saskatchewan,�
Canada for enhanced oil recovery with CO2 storage. 
 
Synfuel manufacture involves O2-blown�gasification�to�make�
syngas, gas cooling, gas clean-up, water gas shift and acid gas 
(H2S/CO2) removal. Subsequently cleaned syngas is converted 
catalytically to fuel in a synthesis reactor and unconverted 
syngas is separated from the liquid fuel product. At this point 
either most unconverted gas is recycled to the synthesis 
reactor to generate additional liquid fuel and the remaining 
unconverted gas is used to make electricity for onsite needs, or 
syngas is passed only once through the synthesis reactor, and all 
unconverted syngas is used for other purposes, for example, to 
make electricity for sale to the electric grid as well as for onsite 
use. The latter once through option is often more competitive 
as a technology option (Williams, 2000; Gray and Tomlinson, 
2001; Larson and Ren, 2003; Celik et al., 2005). 
 
New slurry-phase synthesis reactors make the once through 
configuration� especially� attractive� for� CO-rich� (e.g.,� coal-
derived) syngas by making high once through conversion 
possible. For once through systems, a water gas shift reactor 
is often placed upstream of the synthesis reactor to generate 
the H2/CO ratio that maximizes synfuel conversion in the 
synthesis reactor. It is desirable to remove most CO2 from 
shifted syngas to maximize synthetic fuel conversion. Also, 
because synthesis catalysts are extremely sensitive to H2S and 
various trace contaminants, these must be removed to very low 
levels ahead of the synthesis reactor. Most trace metals can 
be�removed�at�low-cost�using�an�activated�carbon�filter.�CO2 
removal from syngas upstream of the synthesis reactor is a low-
cost, partial de-carbonization option, especially when H2S and 
CO2 are co-captured and co-stored as an acid gas management 
strategy (Larson and Ren, 2003). Further de-carbonization can 
be realized in once through systems, at higher incremental cost, 
by adding additional shift reactors downstream of the synthesis 
reactor, recovering the CO2, and using the CO2-depleted, H2-rich 
syngas to make electricity or some mix of electricity plus H2 in 
a�‘polygeneration’�configuration�(see�Figure�3.16).�The�relative�
amounts of H2 and electricity produced would depend mainly 
on relative demands, as there do not seem to be thermodynamic 
or cost advantages for particular H2/electricity production ratios 
(Chiesa et al., 2005; Kreutz et al., 2005). When syngas is de-
carbonized both upstream and downstream of the synthesis 
reactor (see Figure 3.16) it is feasible to capture and store as 
CO2 up to 90% of the carbon in the original feedstock except 
Chapter 3: Capture of CO2
135
that contained in the synthetic fuel produced.
 
An example of such a system (Celik et al., 2005) is one 
making 600 MW of dimethyl ether (containing 27% of coal 
input energy and 20% of coal input carbon) plus 365 MW of 
electricity (no H2) from coal. For this system the CO2 storage 
rate (equivalent to 74% of C in coal) is 3.8 Mtonnes yr-1 (39% 
from upstream of the synthesis reactor). The estimated fuel 
cycle-wide GHG emissions for dimethyl ether are 0.9 times 
those for crude oil-derived diesel and those for electricity are 
0.09�times�those�for�a�43%�efficient�coal-fired�power�plant�with�
CO2 vented.
3.5.2.9 
Pressure swing adsorption
Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) is the system of choice for 
the� purification� of� syngas,� where� high� purity� H2 is required. 
However, it does not selectively separate CO2 from the other 
waste gases and so for an SMR application the CO2 concentration 
in the waste gas would be 40-50% and require further upgrading 
to produce pure CO2 for storage. Simultaneous H2 and CO2 
separation is possible by using an additional PSA section to 
remove the CO2 prior to the H2 separation step, such as the Air 
Products Gemini Process (Sircar, 1979).
 
The PSA process is built around adsorptive separations of 
cyclic character. The cycles consist of two basic steps: adsorption, 
in which the more adsorbable species are selectively removed 
from the feed gas and regeneration (desorption), when these 
species are removed from the adsorbent so that it can be ready 
for the next cycle. It is possible to obtain useful products during 
both adsorption and regeneration. The principal characteristic 
of PSA processes is the use of a decrease in pressure and/or the 
purge by a less adsorbable gas to clean the adsorbent bed. Apart 
from adsorption and regeneration, a single commercial PSA 
cycle consists of a number of additional steps, including co- 
and counter-current pressurization, pressure equalization and 
co- and counter-current depressurization. A detailed description 
of the PSA technique, along with its practical applications can 
be found elsewhere (Ruthven et al., 1994).
3.5.2.10 Chemical solvent processes
Chemical solvents are used to remove CO2 from syngas at partial 
pressures below about 1.5 MPa (Astarita et al., 1983) and are 
similar to those used in post-combustion capture (see Section 
3.3.2.1). The solvent removes CO2 from the shifted syngas by 
means of a chemical reaction, which can be reversed by pressure 
reduction and heating. The tertiary amine methyldiethanolamine 
(MDEA, see Table 3.2) is widely used in modern industrial 
processes, due to the high CO2 loading possible and the low 
regenerator heating load, relative to other solvents. Hot 
potassium carbonate (the most common commercial version of 
which�is�known�as�Benfield)�was�used�for�CO2 removal in most 
hydrogen plants until about 15 years ago.
3.5.2.11 Physical solvent processes
Physical solvent (or absorption) processes are mostly applicable 
to gas streams which have a high CO2 partial pressure and/or a 
high total pressure. They are often used to remove the CO2 from 
the mixed stream of CO2 and H2 that comes from the shift reaction 
in pre-combustion CO2 capture processes, such as product from 
partial oxidation of coal and heavy hydrocarbons.
 
The leading physical solvent processes are shown in Table 
3.2. The regeneration of solvent is carried out by release of 
pressure at which CO2 evolves from the solvent, in one or more 
stages. If a deeper regeneration is required the solvent would be 
stripped by heating. The process has low energy consumption, 
as only the energy for pressurizing the solvent (liquid pumping) 
is required.
 
The use of high sulphur fossil fuels in a pre-combustion 
capture process results in syngas with H2S. Acid gas components 
must be removed. If transport and storage of mixed CO2 and 
H2S is possible then both components can be removed together. 
Sulphinol� was� developed� to� achieve� significantly� higher�
solubilities of acidic components compared to amine solvents, 
without added problems of excessive corrosion, foaming, or 
solution degradation. It consists of a mixture of sulpholane 
(tetrahydrothiophene 1,1-dioxide), an alkanolamine and water 
in various proportions depending on the duty. If pure CO2 is 
required, then a selective process is required using physical 
solvents - often Rectisol or Selexol. The H2S must be separated 
at�sufficiently�high�concentration�(generally�>50%)�to�be�treated�
in a sulphur recovery plant.
3.5.2.12  Effect on other pollutants
Pre-combustion capture includes reforming, partial oxidation 
or� gasification.� In� order� to� maintain� the� operability� of� the�
catalyst of reformers, sulphur (H2S) has to be removed prior 
to�reforming.�In�gasification,�sulphur�can�be�captured�from�the�
Figure 3.16 Making�liquid�fuel,�electricity�and�hydrogen�from�coal�via�gasification,�with�CO2 capture and storage.

IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
syngas,�and�in�the�case�when�liquid�or�solid�fuels�are�gasified,�
particulates, NH3, COS and HCN are also present in the system 
that need to be removed. In general, all of these pollutants can 
be removed from a high-pressure fuel gas prior to combustion, 
where combustion products are diluted with nitrogen and 
excess oxygen. In the combustion of hydrogen or a hydrogen-
containing fuel gas, NOx may be formed. Depending upon 
combustion technology and hydrogen fraction, the rate at which 
NOx is formed may vary. If the volumetric fraction of hydrogen 
is below approximately 50-60%, NOx formation is at the same 
level as for natural gas dry low-NOx systems (Todd and Battista, 
2001).
 
In general, with the exception of H2S that could be co-
removed with CO2,�other�pollutants�identified�above�are�separated�
in additional pretreatment operations, particularly in systems 
that gasify liquid or solid fuels. High temperature pretreatment 
operations for these multi-pollutants that avoid cooling of the 
syngas�have�the�advantage�of�improving�the�cycle�efficiency�of�
the�overall�gasification�process,�but�these�separation�processes�
have not been commercially demonstrated.
 
Although it is not yet regulated as a ‘criteria pollutant’, 
mercury (Hg), is currently the focus of considerable concern as 
a�pollutant�from�coal�power�systems.�For�gasification�systems�
Hg can be recovered from syngas at ambient temperatures at 
very�low-cost,�compared�to�Hg�recovery�from�flue�gases�(Klett�
et al., 2002).
3.5.3 
Emerging technologies
Emerging options in both natural gas reforming and coal 
gasification� incorporate� novel� combined� reaction/separation�
systems such as sorption-enhanced reforming and sorption-
enhanced water gas shift, membrane reforming and membrane 
water gas shift. Finally there is a range of technologies that 
make use of the carbonation of CaO for CO2 capture. 
3.5.3.1 
 Sorption enhanced reaction
A concept called Sorption Enhanced Reaction (SER) uses a 
packed bed containing a mixture of a catalyst and a selective 
adsorbent to remove CO2 from a high temperature reaction 
zone, thus driving the reaction to completion. (Hufton et al., 
1999). The adsorbent is periodically regenerated by using a 
pressure swing, or temperature swing adsorption system with 
steam regeneration (Hufton et al., 2005).
 
High temperature CO2 adsorbents such as hydrotalcites 
(Hufton et al., 1999) or lithium silicate (Nakagawa and Ohashi, 
1998) can be mixed with a catalyst to promote either the steam 
methane reforming reaction (Reaction 1) or water gas shift 
reaction (Reaction 3) producing pure hydrogen and pure CO2 in 
a single process unit. The continuous removal of the CO2 from 
the reaction products by adsorption shifts each reaction towards 
completion.
 
The SER can be used to produce hydrogen at 400-600oC 
to fuel a gas turbine combined cycle power generation system. 
A design study based on a General Electric 9FA gas turbine 
with hot hydrogen, produced from an air blown ATR with a 
sorption enhanced water gas shift reactor, gave a theoretical net 
efficiency�of�48.3%�with�90%�CO2 capture at 99% purity and 
150 bar pressure (Hufton et al., 2005). The process is currently 
at the pilot plant stage.
3.5.3.2 
Membrane reactors for hydrogen production with 
CO2 capture
Inorganic membranes with operating temperatures up to 1000°C 
offer the possibility of combining reaction and separation 
of the hydrogen in a single stage at high temperature and 
pressure to overcome the equilibrium limitations experienced 
in� conventional� reactor� configurations� for� the� production� of�
hydrogen. The combination of separation and reaction in 
membrane steam reforming and/or membrane water gas shift 
offers higher conversion of the reforming and/or shift reactions 
due to the removal of hydrogen from these equilibrium reactions 
as shown in Reactions (1) and (3) respectively. The reforming 
reaction is endothermic and can, with this technique, be forced 
to completion at lower temperature than normal (typically 500-
600°C). The shift reaction being exothermic can be forced to 
completion at higher temperature (500-600°C).
 
Another reason to incorporate H2 separation membranes in 
the hydrogen production system is that CO2 is also produced 
without the need for additional separation equipment. Membrane 
reactors allow one-step reforming, or a single intermediate water 
gas shift reaction, with hydrogen separation (the permeate) 
leaving behind a retentate gas which is predominantly CO2 and 
a small amount of non-recovered hydrogen and steam. This CO2 
remains at the relatively high pressure of the reacting system (see 
Figure 3.17). Condensation of the steam leaves a concentrated 
CO2 stream at high pressure, reducing the compression energy 
for�transport�and�storage.�Membrane�reforming�will�benefit�from�
high-pressure operation due to the increased H2 partial pressure 
differential across the membrane which is the driving force for 
hydrogen permeation. Therefore membrane reactors are also 
seen as a good option for pre-combustion de-carbonization 
where a low-pressure hydrogen stream for fuel gas and a high-
pressure CO2-rich stream for transport and storage are required. 
The use of the membrane reformer reactor in a gas turbine 
combined cycle means that the hydrogen needs to be produced 
at� such� pressure� that� the� significant� power� consumption� for�
the hydrogen compression is avoided. This could be done by 
increasing the operating pressure of the membrane reactor or 
by using a sweep gas, for instance steam, at the permeate side 
of the membrane (Jordal et al., 2003). 
 
For these membrane reactor concepts, a hydrogen selective 
membrane capable of operating in a high-temperature, high-
pressure environment is needed. In the literature a number of 
membrane types have been reported that have these capabilities 
and these are listed in Table 3.3. Microporous inorganic 
membranes based upon surface diffusion separation exhibit 
rather low separation factors (e.g., H2/CO2 separation factor of 
15). However, the separation ability of the current commercially 
available gamma-alumina and silica microporous membranes 
(which have better separation factors, up to 40) depends upon 
the stability of the membrane pore size, which is adversely 
Chapter 3: Capture of CO2
137
affected by the presence of steam in the feed streams. The dense 
ceramic membranes based on inorganic perovskite oxides (also 
called proton conducting) need high temperatures, higher than 
800oC,� to� achieve� practical� hydrogen� flux� rates.� Palladium-
based dense membranes are also known for their high hydrogen 
selectivity and permeability over other gases in the temperature 
range 300°C-600oC that is appropriate for these two reactions. 
Palladium alloy tubes have been available for several decades, 
but for CCS applications they are too expensive due to the 
membrane thickness needed for structural stability and 
consequently�low�hydrogen�flux�rates.�In�order�to�be�suitable�for�
the target application, a hydrogen separation membrane must 
have�adequate�selectivity�and�flux�rate�and�must�be�stable�in�
the reducing coal gas or fuel-reforming environment containing 
steam and hydrogen sulphide. 
 
A number of membrane reactor developments have been 
reported for hydrogen production with CO2 capture. Several 
groups have evaluated methane steam reforming membrane 
reactors based on palladium alloy membranes (Middleton et al., 
2002, Damle and Dorchak, 2001). These evaluations showed 
that membrane reactors could achieve 90% CO2 recovery and 
that at this moment the projected cost is nearly identical to that 
for a conventional system. However, a cost-reduction can be 
achieved by either reducing the material cost of the membrane 
or by increasing the permeability. Similar evaluations of 
membrane reactors for the shift conversion and separation of 
CO2�from�syngas�produced�from�heavy�feeds�by�gasification�
have been reported (Bracht et al., 1997; Middleton 2002; Lowe 
et al.,�2003).�For�these�gasifier�systems�the�membrane�reactors�
could reduce the costs for capturing CO2 and the cost reduction 
would� be� more� significant� if� they� could� be� made� sulphur�
tolerant.

An�SMR�reactor�consists�of�alternate�passages�having�fins,�

is produced by catalytic combustion of fuel gas premixed with

scale H2 production for fuel cell applications, they also show 
promise in larger H2 plants.
3.5.3.4 
 Conversion to hydrogen and carbon
Thermal cracking or pyrolysis of methane is the reaction where 
methane reacts to carbon and hydrogen through:
Methane pyrolysis:
CH4 → C + 2 H2 
(4)
The main advantage of the process is that it can potentially yield 
a clean gas (free of carbon oxides) that could be used directly 
for power production, but a disadvantage is that the chemical 
energy from the oxidation of carbon to CO2 is not released. The 
cracking reaction is endothermic and so heat has to be supplied to 
the reaction. If the natural gas is converted fully, the theoretical 
yield of hydrogen corresponds to 60% of the heating value of 
the natural gas. The amount of carbon, which can be obtained, 
corresponds to 49% of the heating value, with the extra 9% of 
the energy in this calculation being provided as endothermic 
heat shown by reaction (4) above. Therefore full conversion can 
be achieved only if heat is supplied from an external source. 
If full conversion of methane is not achieved, the remaining 
methane will be combusted to produce heat. There are many 
different methods under development for reactors based on this 
principle, including thermal catalytic, thermal non-catalytic and 
plasma cracking. 
 
In the plasma cracking process natural gas or other 
hydrocarbons are supplied to a plasma reactor where the 
hydrocarbons are cracked under pyrolysis conditions (i.e., in 
absence of oxides, e.g., steam, which can supply oxygen to 
form CO or CO2). The plasma arc, for which electricity is used, 
supplies the heat for the cracking reaction. Advantages of the 
process�are�its�flexibility�with�respect�to�the�fuel�and�the�high�
quality carbon black which can be produced. Two small-scale 
plasma cracking processes for hydrogen/syngas production have 
been in development. The Glid Arc process has been developed 
by the Canadian Synergy Technologies Corporation. The 
second process is the Kvaerner CB&H process. Kvaerner has 
reported results for a pilot plant producing 1000 Nm³ hydrogen 
per hour and 270 kg or 500 kg carbon black using natural gas 
and aromatic oil respectively (IEA GHG, 2001). 
3.5.3.5 
Technologies based on calcium oxide
There is a range of pre-combustion systems that make use of the 
carbonation reaction of CaO at high pressures and temperatures, 
to� further� integrate� the� gasification� of� the� fuel� (if� solid),� the�
shift reaction, and in-situ CO2 removal with CaO. The overall 
reaction aimed in the system is:
Carbonation of calcium oxide:
CaO + C + 2 H2O →  CaCO3 + 2H2 
(5)
The regeneration of the sorbent produces pure CO2 when 
carried out in a separate reactor by calcining CaCO3. A range 
of systems can be developed under this general reaction 
scheme�depending�on�the�technology�adopted�for�gasification,�
carbonation-calcination, hydrogen utilization route and storage 
option for CO2.�The�first�of�these�concepts�was�proposed�at�the�
Los Alamos National Laboratory (USA) and is currently under 
development as the Zero Emission Coal Alliance (ZECA) 
process. The full system includes (Lackner et al., 2001) a hydro-
gasification�reactor,�solid�oxide�fuel�cell�and�a�technology�for�
mineral carbonation. However, the fuel cell will require more 
development and mineral carbonation is only at the laboratory 
investigation stage (see Section 7.2 for a discussion of mineral 
carbonation).
 
The HyPrRing process (Lin et al., 2002) is being developed 
by the Center for Coal Utilization of Japan. It integrates 
gasification,�reforming�and�in situ CO2 capture in a single reactor 
at pressures above 12 MPa and temperature above 650ºC. 
Projects in Norway using natural gas and in Germany using 
brown coal (Bandi et al., 2002) are also underway developing 
pre-combustion systems using capture of CO2 with CaO. Finally, 
General Electric (Rizeq et al., 2002) is developing an innovative 
system involving the capture of CO2�in�the�gasification�reactor�
by a high temperature sorbent and with calcination in a separate 
reactor by burning part of the fuel with an oxygen carrier.
 
All these systems are at an early stage of development. 
Detailed� process� simulations� show� that� the� efficiencies� are�
potentially high because most of the energy employed for 
sorbent regeneration is effectively transferred to the H2 generated 
in reaction (5). The systems are aimed at very large-scale 
generation of electricity and/or H2 and cement production (from 
the deactivated sorbent, CaO). However, many uncertainties 
remain concerning the performance of the individual units 
and their practical integration. The main challenge may be the 
regeneration of the sorbent at very high temperatures (>9000C), 
to produce a pure stream of CO2. Another is the operating 
conditions�to�achieve�sufficient�conversion�towards�hydrogen,�
without the use of a catalyst for the shift reaction.
3.5.4 
Enabling technologies
The performance and cost of a pre-combustion capture system 
is linked to the availability of the enabling technologies that 
complete the system. In this section we consider the availability 
of industrial systems, to produce heat from the de-carbonized 
fuel and gas turbines and fuel cells to produce power.
Chapter 3: Capture of CO2

3.5.4.1 
Use of de-carbonized fuel in industrial systems
The�use�of�hydrogen�as�a�fuel�for�conventional�fired�heaters�
and boilers is considered to be proven and indeed it is practiced 
at certain industrial sites. There is a very large stock of capital 
equipment of this type and so the use of hydrogen as a fuel 
might be considered a valuable technology option in a carbon-
constrained world. A study (IEA GHG, 2000c) has looked at the 
cost�of�converting�an�existing�refinery�to�use�hydrogen�fuel.
3.5.4.2 
Use of de-carbonized fuel in gas turbine systems
There is extensive commercial experience with hydrogen-rich 
fuel�gas�firing�in�gas�turbines.�For�example,�General�Electric�
reports over 450,000 hours of operating experience with 
high hydrogen (52-95% by volume) content fuel gas in gas 
turbines (Shilling and Jones, 2003). Unfortunately, most of that 
experience�is�for�‘refinery�gas’�where�methane�is�the�other�main�
component�of�the�fuel�gas�and�is�utilized�in�older�lower�firing�
temperature gas turbines, not the state-of-the-art over 1300°C 
gas turbines normally considered for large de-carbonization 
power plants.
 
Norsk Hydro and General Electric collaborated to perform 
full-scale combustion system testing for modern gas turbines 
firing�hydrogen-rich�gas�with�combustion�exit�temperatures�of�
above 1400°C (Todd and Battista, 2001). The results showed 
good combustion conditions with low NOx emission and 
acceptable hot metal temperatures for mixtures with 54-77% by 
volume hydrogen with most of the additional gas being nitrogen. 
Dilution of the hydrogen with nitrogen or steam reduces the 
NOx emission.
 
For pre-combustion capture of CO2 from natural gas, 
air-blown� gasification� or� autothermal� reforming� is� usually�
preferred (IEA GHG, 2000b; Wilkinson and Clarke, 2002). 
Nitrogen�dilution�of�the�hydrogen�required�for�firing�in�modern�
gas�turbines�comes�from�the�gasification�air.�High-pressure�air�
is usually extracted from the gas turbine to feed the air-blown 
gasifier,�or�autothermal�reformer�to�reduce�costs�and�avoid�a�
separate air compressor. The balance between the amount of 
air withdrawn from the gas turbine and the amount provided 
from a separate air compressor is determined by the particular 
characteristics of the gas turbine used. Some gas turbines can 
accept�a�higher�ratio�of�expander�to�compressor�flow,�allowing�
greater�volumes�of�dilution�gas�or�smaller�air-side�draw�flow�
and giving higher power output. 
 
For pre-combustion capture of CO2 from coal, oxygen-
blown� gasification� is� usually� preferred� (IEA� GHG,� 2003).�
Nitrogen�dilution�of�the�hydrogen�required�for�firing�in�modern�
gas turbines comes from the cryogenic air separation unit (used 
to make the oxygen; see Section 3.4.5.1). The nitrogen is added 
to� the� hydrogen� after� the� gasification,� CO� shifting� and� CO2 
capture to reduce the equipment sizes and cost. High-pressure 
air is usually extracted from the gas turbine to supply a higher 
than normal pressure cryogenic air separation unit to reduce 
costs plus air, oxygen and nitrogen compression power. An 
alternative IGCC scheme that incorporates newly emerging ion 
transport membranes for oxygen production is also described 
below in Section 3.5.4.3. 
3.5.4.3 
Syngas production using oxygen membranes
Oxygen� required� for� a� coal-fired� IGCC� process� (Section�
3.5.2.6) can be generated in an oxygen transport membrane 
system by using a heated, high-pressure air stream produced by 
heating the discharge air from the compressor section of a gas 
turbine (Allam et al., 2002), typically at 1.6 MPa or 420°C, to 
the precise inlet temperature of the oxygen transport membrane 
module which is above 700°C. The oxygen, which permeates 
to the low-pressure side passes through a heat recovery section 
and�is�compressed�to�the�final�pressure�of�use.�The�O2 depleted 
air leaving the oxygen transport membrane module then enters 
the gas turbine combustor where it is used to burn fuel before 
entering the gas turbine expander at the required temperature. 
Note that due to the necessity to have excess air in a gas turbine 
to limit turbine inlet temperature, removing one mole of oxygen 
can be compensated by injection of the equivalent thermal 
capacity of steam to maintain gas turbine power output. Studies 
have been carried out (Armstrong et al., 2002) to compare 
oxygen transport membrane and cryogenic oxygen production 
in an IGCC power plant using coal as fuel. The oxygen plant 
projected cost was reduced by 35% and the power consumption 
by�37%.�An�LHV�efficiency�of�41.8%�without�CO2 capture and 
compression is reported for this cycle compared to 40.9% when 
a conventional cryogenic oxygen plant is used.
 
For autothermal reforming or the partial oxidation of natural 
gas, if the permeate side of the oxygen transport membrane is 
exposed to a natural gas plus water vapour stream in the presence 
of a reforming catalyst, the oxygen will react as it leaves the 
membrane in an exothermic reaction (Dyer et al., 2001; Carolan 
et al., 2001), which will provide heat for the endothermic steam/
natural gas reforming reaction. The oxygen partial pressure at 
these highly-reducing, high temperature conditions is extremely 
low, allowing heated air at close to atmospheric pressure to be 
used on the feed side of the membrane while producing a H2 
+ CO mixture at high pressure from the permeate side. This 
system can be used to produce H2 following CO shift reaction 
and CO2 removal.
3.5.4.4�
�Chemical�looping�gasification/reforming�
The chemical looping concept described in 3.4.6 is being 
considered for reforming of a fuel to produce H2 and CO (Zafar 
et al., 2005). When the amount of oxygen brought by the 
metal oxide into the reduction reactor is below stoichiometric 
requirements, the chemical reaction with the fuel produces H2 
and CO. The reaction products may subsequently be shifted 
with steam to yield CO2 and more H2.
3.5.4.5 
 Use of de-carbonized fuel in fuel cells
Fuel� cells� offer� the� possibility� for� highly� efficient� power�
production since the conversion process is not controlled by 
heat to work Carnot cycle restrictions (Blomen and Mugerwa, 
1993). In general fuel cells feature the electrochemical oxidation 
of gaseous fuels directly into electricity, avoiding the mixture of 
the�air�and�the�fuel�flows�and�thus�the�dilution�with�nitrogen�and�
excess oxygen of the oxidized products (Campanari, 2002). As 
a result, the anode outlet stream of a fuel cell already has a very 
140
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
high CO2�content�that�simplifies�the�CO2 capture subsystem. 
The fuel is normally natural gas, though some concepts can 
also�be�incorporated�into�coal�gasification�systems.�The�systems�
concepts�can�be�classified�into�two�main�groups�(Goettlicher,�
1999):
• 
Systems with pre-fuel cell CO2 capture;
• 
Systems with post-fuel cell CO2 capture.
In pre-fuel cell CO2 capture systems (see Figure 3.18a) the 
fuel�is�first�converted�into�hydrogen�using�steam�reforming�or�
coal�gasification,�followed�by�the�water�gas�shift�conversion.�
This� system� approach� has� been� first� proposed� both� for� low�
temperature and for high temperature fuel cells. 
 
The post-fuel cell capture system (see Figure 3.18b) is 
proposed for high temperature fuel cell systems (Dijkstra and 
Jansen, 2003). These systems make use of the internal reforming 
capabilities of the high temperature fuel cells resulting in an 
anode off-gas that has a high CO2-content, but also contains 
H2O and unconverted CO and H2. The water can easily be 
removed by conventional techniques (cooling, knock-out, 
additional drying). Oxidizing the H2 and CO from the (SOFC) 
anode with air will result in a too high dilution of the stream 
with nitrogen.  
 
Haines (1999) chooses to use an oxygen-transport membrane 
reactor placed after the SOFC. The anode off-gas is fed to one 
side of the membrane, the cathode off-gas is fed to the other 
side of the membrane. The membrane is selective to oxygen, 
which permeates from the cathode off-gas stream to the anode-
off gas. In the membrane unit the H2 and CO are oxidized. The 
retenate of the membrane unit consist of CO2 and water. Finally 
a concept using a water gas shift membrane reactor has been 
proposed (Jansen and Dijkstra, 2003). 
3.5.5 
Status and outlook
This section reviewed a wide variety of processes and fuel 
conversion routes that share a common objective: to produce a 
cleaner fuel stream from the conversion of a raw carbonaceous 
fuel into one that contains little, or none, of the carbon contained 
in the original fuel. This approach necessarily involves the 
separation of CO2 at some point in the conversion process. 
The resulting H2-rich fuel can be fed to a hydrogen consuming 
process, oxidized in a fuel cell, or burned in the combustion 
chamber of a gas turbine to produce electricity. In systems that 
operate�at�high�pressure,�the�energy�conversion�efficiencies�tend�
to be higher when compared to equivalent systems operating 
at low pressures following the combustion route, but these 
efficiency�improvements�are�often�obtained�at�the�expense�of�a�
higher complexity and capital investment in process plants (see 
Section 3.7).
 
In principle, all pre-combustion systems are substantially 
similar in their conversion routes, allowing for differences that 
arise from the initial method employed for syngas production 
from gaseous, liquid or solid fuels and from the subsequent need 
to remove impurities that originate from the fuel feed to the plant. 
Once�produced,�the�syngas�is�first�cleaned�and�then�reacted�with�
steam to produce more H2 and CO2. The separation of these two 
gases can be achieved with well-known, commercial absorption-
desorption methods, producing a CO2 stream suitable for storage. 
Also, intense R&D efforts worldwide are being directed towards 
the development of new systems that combine CO2 separation 
with some of the reaction steps, such as the steam reforming 
of natural gas or water gas shift reaction stages, but it is not yet 
clear if these emerging concepts (see Section 3.5.3) will deliver 
a lower CO2 capture cost. 
 
In power systems, pre-combustion CO2 capture in natural 
gas combined cycles has not been demonstrated. However, 
studies show that based on current state of the art gas turbine 
combined cycles, pre-combustion CO2 capture will reduce the 
efficiency�from�56%�LHV�to�48%�LHV�(IEA,�2000b).�In�natural�
gas�combined�cycles,�the�most�significant�area�for�efficiency�
improvement is the gas turbine and it is expected that by 2020, 
the� efficiency� of� a� natural� gas� combined� cycle� could� be� as�
high as 65% LHV (IEA GHG, 2000d). For such systems the 
efficiency�with�CO2 capture would equal the current state-of-
the-art�efficiency�for�plants�without�CO2 capture, that is, 56% 
LHV.

with the largest unit rated at 331 MWe, future improvements are 
expected. A recent study describes improvements potentially 
realisable for bituminous coals by 2020 that could reduce both 
energy and cost-of-electricity penalties for CO2 capture to 
13% compared to a same base plant without capture. For such

systems�the�generation�efficiency�with�capture�would�equal�the�
best�efficiency�realisable�today�without�CO2 capture (i.e., 43% 
LHV; IEA GHG, 2003). Notably, all the innovations considered, 
with the exception of ion transport membrane technology for air 
separation (which is motivated by many market drivers other 
than IGCC needs) involve ‘non- breakthrough’ technologies, 
with modest continuing improvements in components that are 
already established commercially - improvements that might 
emerge as a natural result of growing commercial experience 
with IGCC technologies. 
 
All fuel cell types are currently in the development phase. 
The� first� demonstration� systems� are� now� being� tested,� with�
the largest units being at the 1 MW scale. However, it will 
take at least another 5 to 10 years before these units become 
commercially available. In the longer term, these highly 
efficient�fuel�cell�systems�are�expected�to�become�competitive�
for power generation. Integrating CO2 capture in these systems 
is relatively simple and therefore fuel cell power generation 
systems offer the prospect of reducing the CO2 capture penalty 
in�terms�of�efficiency�and�capture�costs.�For�instance,�for�high�
temperature fuel cell systems without CO2�capture,�efficiencies�
that�exceed�67%�are�calculated�with�an�anticipated�7%�efficiency�
reduction when CO2 capture is integrated into the system 
(Jansen and Dijkstra, 2003). However, fuel cell systems are too 
small to reach a reasonable level of CO2 transport cost (IEA 
GHG, 2002a), but in groups of a total of capacity 100MWe, the 
cost of CO2 transport is reduced to a more acceptable level. 
 
Most studies agree that pre-combustion systems may be better 
suited to implement CO2 capture at a lower incremental cost 
compared to the same type of base technology without capture 
(Section 3.7), but with a key driver affecting implementation 
being the absolute cost of the carbon emission-free product, 
or service provided. Pre-combustion systems also have a high 
strategic importance, because their capability to deliver, in 
a�large�scale�and�at�high�thermal�efficiencies,�a�suitable�mix�
of electricity, hydrogen and lower carbon-containing fuels or

 Environmental, monitoring, risk and legal 
aspects of capture systems
The previous sections of this chapter focused on each of the 
major technologies and systems for CO2 capture. Here we 
summarize the major environmental, regulatory and risk issues 
associated with the use of CO2 capture technology and the 
handling of carbon dioxide common to all of these systems. 
Issues related to the subsequent transport and storage of carbon 
dioxide are discussed in Chapters 4 to 7.
3.6.1 
Emissions and resource use impacts of CO2 
capture systems
3.6.1.1 
Overview of emissions from capture systems 
Plants with CO2 capture would produce a stream of concentrated 
CO2�for�storage,�plus�in�most�cases�a�flue�gas�or�vent�gas�emitted�
to the atmosphere and liquid wastes. In some cases solid wastes 
will also be produced. 
 
The captured CO2 stream may contain impurities which 
would have practical impacts on CO2 transport and storage 
systems and also potential health, safety and environmental 
impacts. The types and concentrations of impurities depend on 
the type of capture process, as shown in Table 3.4, and detailed 
plant design. The major impurities in CO2 are well known but 
there is little published information on the fate of any trace 
impurities in the feed gas such as heavy metals. If substances 
are captured along with the CO2 then their net emissions to the 
atmosphere will be reduced, but impurities in the CO2 may 
result in environmental impacts at the storage site. 
 
CO2 from most capture processes contains moisture, which 
has to be removed to avoid corrosion and hydrate formation 
during transportation. This can be done using conventional 
table 3.4 Concentrations of impurities in dried CO2, % by volume (Source data: IEA GHG, 2003; IEA GHG, 2004; IEA GHG, 2005).

a.  The SO2 concentration for oxy-fuel and the maximum H2S concentration for pre-combustion capture are for cases where these impurities are deliberately 
left in the CO2, to reduce the costs of capture (see Section 3.6.1.1). The concentrations shown in the table are based on use of coal with a sulphur content of 
0.86%. The concentrations would be directly proportional to the fuel sulphur content. 
b.�� The�oxy-fuel�case�includes�cryogenic�purification�of�the�CO2 to separate some of the N2, Ar, O2 and NOx. Removal of this unit would increase impurity 
concentrations but reduce costs.

IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
processes and the costs of doing so are included in published 
costs of CO2 capture plants. 
 
CO2 from post-combustion solvent scrubbing processes 
normally contains low concentrations of impurities. Many of 
the existing post-combustion capture plants produce high purity 
CO2 for use in the food industry (IEA GHG, 2004). 
 
CO2 from pre-combustion physical solvent scrubbing 
processes typically contains about 1-2% H2 and CO and traces 
of H2S and other sulphur compounds (IEA GHG, 2003). IGCC 
plants with pre-combustion capture can be designed to produce 
a combined stream of CO2 and sulphur compounds, to reduce 
costs and avoid the production of solid sulphur (IEA GHG, 
2003). Combined streams of CO2 and sulphur compounds 
(primarily hydrogen sulphide, H2S) are already stored, for 
example in Canada, as discussed in Chapter 5. However, this 
option would only be considered in circumstances where the 
combined stream could be transported and stored in a safe and 
environmentally acceptable manner.
 
The CO2-rich gas from oxy-fuel processes contains oxygen, 
nitrogen, argon, sulphur and nitrogen oxides and various other 
trace impurities. This gas will normally be compressed and 
fed�to�a�cryogenic�purification�process�to�reduce�the�impurities�
concentrations�to�the�levels�required�to�avoid�two-phase�flow�
conditions in the transportation pipelines. A 99.99% purity 
could be produced by including distillation in the cryogenic 
separation unit. Alternatively, the sulphur and nitrogen oxides 
could be left in the CO2 fed to storage in circumstances where 
that is environmentally acceptable as described above for pre-
combustion capture and when the total amount of all impurities 
left in the CO2�is�low�enough�to�avoid�two-phase�flow�conditions�
in transportation pipelines.
 
Power plants with CO2 capture would emit a CO2-depleted 
flue�gas�to�the�atmosphere.�The�concentrations�of�most�harmful�
substances�in�the�flue�gas�would�be�similar�to�or�lower�than�
in�the�flue�gas�from�plants�without�CO2 capture, because CO2 
capture processes inherently remove some impurities and 
some other impurities have to be removed upstream to enable 
the CO2 capture process to operate effectively. For example, 
post-combustion solvent absorption processes require low 
concentrations of sulphur compounds in the feed gas to avoid 
excessive solvent loss, but the reduction in the concentration 
of an impurity may still result in a higher rate of emissions per 
kWh of product, depending upon the actual amount removed 
upstream and the capture system energy requirements. As 
discussed below (Section 3.6.1.2), the latter measure is more 
relevant for environmental assessments. In the case of post-
combustion� solvent� capture,� the� flue� gas� may� also� contain�
traces of solvent and ammonia produced by decomposition of 
solvent. 
 
Some CO2 capture systems produce solid and liquid wastes. 
Solvent scrubbing processes produce degraded solvent wastes, 
which would be incinerated or disposed of by other means. 
Post-combustion capture processes produce substantially more 
degraded solvent than pre-combustion capture processes. 
However, use of novel post-combustion capture solvents can 
significantly�reduce�the�quantity�of�waste�compared�to�MEA�
solvent, as discussed in Section 3.3.2.1. The waste from MEA 
scrubbing would normally be processed to remove metals and 
then incinerated. The waste can also be disposed of in cement 
kilns, where the waste metals become agglomerated in the 
clinker (IEA GHG, 2004). Pre-combustion capture systems 
periodically produce spent shift and reforming catalysts and 
these would be sent to specialist reprocessing and disposal 
facilities.
3.6.1.2 
 Framework for evaluating capture system impacts
As discussed in Chapter 1, the framework used throughout this 
report to assess the impacts of CO2 capture and storage is based 
on�the�material�and�energy�flows�needed�to�produce�a�unit�of�
product from a particular process. As seen earlier in this chapter, 
CO2 capture systems require an increase in energy use for their 
operation.�As�defined�in�this�report�(see�Section�1.5�and�Figure�
1.5), the energy requirement associated with CO2 capture is 
expressed as the additional energy required to produce a unit 
of useful product, such as a kilowatt-hour of electricity (for the 
case of a power plant). As the energy and resource requirement 
for CO2 capture (which includes the energy needed to compress 
CO2 for subsequent transport and storage) is typically much 
larger than for other emission control systems, it has important 
implications for plant resource requirements and environmental 
emissions when viewed from the ‘systems’ perspective of 
Figure 1.5. 
In general, the CCS energy requirement per unit of product can 
be�expressed�in�terms�of�the�change�in�net�plant�efficiency�(η) 
when the reference plant without capture is equipped with a 
CCS system:1
∆E =  (ηref / ηccs) - 1 
(6)
where ∆E is the fractional increase in plant energy input per 
unit of product and ηccs and ηref�are�the�net�efficiencies�of�the�
capture plant and reference plant, respectively. The CCS energy 
requirement directly determines the increases in plant-level 
resource consumption and environmental burdens associated 
with producing a unit of useful product (like electricity) 
while capturing CO2. In the case of a power plant, the larger 
the CCS energy requirement, the greater the increases per 
kilowatt-hour of in-plant fuel consumption and other resource 
requirements (such as water, chemicals and reagents), as well 
as environmental releases in the form of solid wastes, liquid 
wastes and air pollutants not captured by the CCS system. The 
magnitude of ∆E also determines the magnitude of additional 
upstream environmental impacts associated with the extraction, 
storage and transport of additional fuel and other resources 
consumed at the plant. However, the additional energy for these 
upstream activities is not normally included in the reported 
1 A different measure of the ‘energy penalty’ commonly reported in the literature 
is�the�fractional�decrease�in�plant�output�(plant�derating)�for�a�fixed�energy�
input. This value can be expressed as: ∆E* = 1 – (ηccs/ηref). Numerically, ∆E* 
is smaller than the value of ∆E given by Equation (6). For example, a plant 
derating of ∆E* = 25% corresponds to an increase in energy input per kWh of 
∆E = 33%.
Chapter 3: Capture of CO2

energy requirements for CO2 capture systems.2
 
Recent literature on CO2 capture systems applied to 
electric�power�plants�quantifies�the�magnitude�of�CCS�energy�
requirements for a range of proposed new plant designs with and 
without CO2 capture. As elaborated later in Section 3.7 (Tables 
3.7 to 3.15), those data reveal a wide range of ∆E values. For 
new supercritical pulverized coal (PC) plants using current 
technology, these ∆E values range from 24-40%, while for 
natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) systems the range is 11%–
22%�and�for�coal-based�gasification�combined�cycle�(IGCC)�
systems� it� is� 14%–25%.� These� ranges� reflect� the� combined�
effects�of�the�base�plant�efficiency�and�capture�system�energy�
requirements for the same plant type with and without capture.
3.6.1.3 
Resource and emission impacts for current systems 
Only recently have the environmental and resource implications 
of� CCS� energy� requirements� been� discussed� and� quantified�
for a variety of current CCS systems. Table 3.5 displays the 
assumptions and results from a recent comparison of three 
common fossil fuel power plants employing current technology 
to capture 90% of the CO2 produced (Rubin et al., 2005). 
Increases�in�specific�fuel�consumption�relative�to�the�reference�
plant without CO2 capture correspond directly to the ∆E 
values�defined�above.�For�these�three�cases,�the�plant�energy�
requirement per kWh increases by 31% for the PC plant, 16% 
for the coal-based IGCC plant and 17% for the NGCC plant. For 
the�specific�examples�used�in�Table�3.5,�the�increase�in�energy�
consumption for the PC and NGCC plants are in the mid-range 
of the values for these systems reported later in Tables 3.7 to 
3.15 (see also Section 3.6.1.2), whereas the IGCC case is nearer 
the low end of the reported range for such systems. As a result 
of the increased energy input per kWh of output, additional 
resource requirements for the PC plant include proportionally 
greater amounts of coal, as well as limestone (consumed by 
the FGD system for SO2 control) and ammonia (consumed by 
the SCR system for NOx control). All three plants additionally 
require more sorbent make-up for the CO2 capture units. Table 
3.5 also shows the resulting increases in solid residues for 
these three cases. In contrast, atmospheric emissions of CO2 
decrease sharply as a result of the CCS systems, which also 
remove residual amounts of other acid gases, especially SO2 
in�flue�gas�streams.�Thus,�the�coal�combustion�system�shows�a�
net reduction in SO2 emission rate as a result of CO2 capture. 
However,�because�of�the�reduction�in�plant�efficiency,�other�air�
emission rates per kWh increase relative to the reference plants 
without capture. For the PC and NGCC systems, the increased 
emissions of ammonia are a result of chemical reactions in 
the amine-based capture process. Not included in this analysis 
are the incremental impacts of upstream operations such as 
mining, processing and transport of fuels and other resources. 
2�Those�additional�energy�requirements,�if�quantified,�could�be�included�by�re-
defining�the�system�boundary�and�system�efficiency�terms�in�Equation�(6)�to�
apply to the full life cycle, rather than only the power plant. Such an analysis 
would require additional assumptions about the methods of fuel extraction, 
processing, transport to the power plant, and the associated energy requirements 
of those activities; as well as the CO2 losses incurred during storage. 
Other studies, however, indicate that these impacts, while not 
insignificant,� tend� to� be� small� relative� to� plant-level� impacts�
(Bock et al., 2003). 
For the most part, the magnitude of impacts noted above 
- especially impacts on fuel use and solid waste production 
- is directly proportional to the increased energy per kWh 
resulting� from� the� reduction� in� plant� efficiency,� as� indicated�
by Equation (6). Because CCS energy requirements are one 
to two orders of magnitude greater than for other power plant 
emission control technologies (such as particulate collectors 
and�flue�gas�desulphurization�systems),�the�illustrative�results�
above emphasize the importance of maximizing overall plant 
efficiency�while�controlling�environmental�emissions.�
3.6.1.4 
Resource and emission impacts of future systems 
The analysis above compared the impacts of CO2 capture for a 
given plant type based on current technology. The magnitude of 
actual future impacts, however, will depend on four important 
factors: (1) the performance of technologies available at the time 
capture systems are deployed; (2) the type of power plants and 
capture systems actually put into service; (3) the total capacity 
of each plant type that is deployed; and, (4) the characteristics 
and capacity of plants they may be replacing. 
 
Analyses of both current and near-future post-combustion, 
pre-combustion and oxy-fuel combustion capture technology 
options reveal that some of the advanced systems currently 
under�development�promise�to�significantly�reduce�the�capture�
energy requirements - and associated impacts - while still 
reducing CO2 emissions by 90% or more, as shown in Figure 
3.19.�Data�in�this�figure�was�derived�from�the�studies�previously�
reported in Figures 3.6 and 3.7. 
 
The�timetable�for�deploying�more�efficient�plants�with�CO2 
capture will be the key determinant of actual environmental 
changes. If a new plant with capture replaces an older, less 
efficient� and� higher-emitting� plant� currently� in� service,� the�
net change in plant-level emission impacts and resource 
requirements would be much smaller than the values given 
earlier (which compared identical new plants with and without 
Figure 3.19 Fuel use for a reduction of CO2 emissions from capture 
plants (data presented from design studies for power plants with and 
without capture shown in Figures 3.6 and 3.7).

capture).�For�example,�the�efficiency�of�a�modern�coal-based�
plant with capture is close to many older coal-burning plants 
currently in service. Replacing the latter with the former 
would thus reduce CO2� emissions� significantly� with� little� or�
no net change in plant coal consumption or related solid waste 
impacts. In some cases, there could in fact be net reductions in 
other plant emissions, in support of clean air goals. If, however, 
the� deployment� of� new� CCS� plants� is� delayed� significantly,�
older existing plants could well be replaced by modern high-
efficiency� plants� without� capture.� Such� plants� also� would�
be built to provide additional capacity in regions with high 
electricity growth rates, such as in China and other parts of 
Asia�today.�A�decade�or�two�from�now,�the�fleet�of�‘existing’�
plants in those regions would thus look very different from the 
present. Accordingly, the environmental and resource impacts 
of additional new plants with CO2 capture would have to be 
assessed in the context of the future situation.
 
Because comparisons of different plant types require a 
specific� context� (or� scenario)� to� be� meaningful,� this� chapter�
has only focused on characterizing the effects of CO2 capture 
systems relative to the same type of power plant and not the 
type of infrastructure it would replace (either currently, or in a 
future carbon-constrained world). If other systems such as the 
use of renewable energy, or electricity and synfuels cogenerated 
from�coal,�find�significant�applications,�those�systems�too�would�
require more comprehensive comparative life-cycle assessments 
of resource use and impacts that are not currently available. 
Chapter 8, however, assesses overall energy use impacts for 
illustrative scenarios of CCS deployment in competition with 
other carbon mitigation options.
3.6.2�
Issues�related�to�the�classification�of�carbon�
dioxide as a product
As a current commercial product, carbon dioxide is subject 
to�classification�and�regulations.�The�classification�of�carbon�
dioxide is dependent on its physical state (gas, liquid or 
solid), its concentration, impurities present and other criteria 
established� by� national� legislative� classification� in� different�
regions of the world. During the capture and concentration 
process,�the�quality�properties�can�change�the�classification�of�
the substance. A detailed assessment of carbon dioxide physical 
and chemical properties is provided in Annex I.
 
The environmental, monitoring, risk and legal aspects 
associated with carbon dioxide handling and storage are well 
established in the processing industry. However, much larger 
volumes are targeted for carbon dioxide processing for purposes 
of CCS than the volumes handled at present. On a local and 
regional level, additional emergency response and other 
regulatory measures can be expected in the future, depending 
on the rate of development of CCS. It is anticipated that human 
capacity will be developed to assess the monitoring, risk and 
legal aspects as required by the market.
 
At present, carbon dioxide typically occurs and is mainly 
traded�as�a�non-flammable�gas�(US�Department�of�Transportation�
classification�class�2.2).�The�classification�system�of�Transport�
Dangerous Goods, International Maritime Organization/ 
International Maritime Dangerous Goods and International Civil 
Aviation Organization / International Air Transport Association, 
all�classify�carbon�dioxide�in�class�2.2,�non-flammable,�non-
corrosive and non-poisonous gases. In US federal regulations, 
carbon dioxide is not listed as a product in the Clean Water Act 
(CWA 307 and 311), Clean Air Act (CAA 112) or the Toxics 
Release Inventory. In other international regulations carbon 
dioxide�is�not�classified�in�the�European�Inventory�of�Existing�
Commercial Chemical Substance or other international lists, 
but�in�Canada�is�classified�as�a�compressed�gas�(class�A)�on�the�
Canadian Energy Pipeline Association Dangerous Substances 
List (Hazardous Substances Data Bank, 2002). 
3.6.3 
Health and safety risks associated with carbon 
dioxide processing
The effects of exposure to carbon dioxide are described in Annex 
I. However, a risk assessment that includes an understanding of 
both exposure and effects is required to characterize the risk for 
various situations associated with carbon dioxide processing 
(European Chemicals Bureau, 2003); see the following two 
sections for established risk management practices. The most 
probable routes of human exposure to carbon dioxide are 
inhalation or skin contact. The need for a risk-based approach 
is clear from the following two descriptions. Carbon dioxide 
and�its�products�of�degradation�are�not�legally�classified�as�a�
toxic substance; is non-hazardous on inhalation, is a non-irritant 
and does not sensitize or permeate the skin. However, chronic 
effects on humans follow from long-term exposure to airborne 
carbon dioxide concentrations of between 0.5 and 1% resulting 
in metabolic acidosis and increased calcium deposits in soft 
tissues. The substance is toxic to the cardiovascular system and 
upper respiratory tract at concentrations above 3%. Sensitive 
populations to elevated carbon dioxide levels are described 
in Annex I. The product risk assessment process is therefore 
necessary as with any other chemical use to determine the risk 
and establish the necessary risk management processes.
 
As an asphyxiate carbon dioxide presents the greatest 
danger. If atmospheric oxygen is displaced such that oxygen 
concentration is 15-16%, signs of asphyxia will be noted. Skin 
contact with dry ice has caused serious frostbites and blisters 
(Hazardous Substances Data Bank, 2002). Protective equipment 
and clothing required in the processing industries include full 
face-piece respirators to prevent eye contact and appropriate 
personal protective clothing to protect the skin from becoming 
frozen by the liquid.
3.6.4 
Plant design principles and guidelines used by 
governments,�industries�and�financiers
New plant facilities like those envisioned for carbon dioxide 
are subject to design guidelines for the petrochemical industry 
as determined by relevant authorities. One example is the 
European Unions’ Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control 
(IPPC) directive requiring the application of the principles 
146
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
of Best Available Technology Not Entailing Excessive Cost 
(BATNEEC). Carbon dioxide capture and compression 
processes are listed in several guidelines as gas-processing 
facilities. Typically the World Bank guidelines and other 
financial�institutions�have�specific�requirements�to�reduce�risk�
and these require monitoring (World Bank, 1999) which is part 
of routine plant monitoring to detect accidental releases. Investor 
guidelines like the World Bank guidelines are particularly 
important for developing countries where there is less emphasis 
on monitoring and legislation. National and regional legislation 
for�plant�design�and�specifications�from�organizations�like�the�
US Environmental Protection Agency are available to guide the 
development of technology.
3.6.5 
Commissioning, good practice during operations 
and sound management of chemicals
The routine engineering design, commissioning and start-up 
activities associated with petrochemical facilities are applicable 
to the capture and compression of carbon dioxide; for example 
Hazard Operability studies are conducted on a routine basis for 
new facilities (Sikdar and Diwekar, 1999).
 
The management of carbon dioxide and reagents inside 
factory battery limits will be in accordance with the relevant 
practices in use for carbon dioxide. For carbon dioxide, US 
Occupational Health and Safety Act standards and National 
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommendations 
exist, which are applied widely in industry to guide safe handling 
of carbon dioxide and the same applies to reagents and catalysts 
used. Well established and externally audited management 
systems such as International Standards Organization’s ISO 
14001 (environment) and ISO 9001 (quality) and Occupational 
Health and Safety (OHSAS 18000) exist to provide assurance 
that environment, safety, health and quality management 
systems are in place (American Institute of Chemical Engineers, 
1995). Tools like life-cycle assessment (ISO 14040 series) with 
the necessary boundary expansion methodology are useful to 
determine the overall issues associated with a facility and assist 
with selection of parameters such as energy carriers, operational 
conditions and materials used in the process. The life-cycle 
assessment will also indicate if a trouble-free capture system 
does generate environmental concerns elsewhere in the product 
life cycle. 
3.6.6 
Site closure and remediation
It is not anticipated that carbon dioxide capture will result in 
a legacy of polluted sites requiring remediation after plant 
closure, assuming that standard operating procedures and 
management practices in the previous section are followed. 
However, depending on the technology used and the materials 
procured for operations, waste disposal at the facilities and 
operation according to a formal management system from 
construction, operation to the development of site closure plans 
will largely assist to reduce the risk of a polluted site after 
closure of operations.
3.7 
Cost of CO2 capture
This section of the report deals with the critical issue of CO2 
capture costs. We begin with an overview of the many factors 
that affect costs and the ability to compare published estimates 
on a consistent basis. Different measures of CO2 capture cost 
also are presented and discussed. The literature on CO2 capture 
costs for currently available technologies is then reviewed, 
along with the outlook for future costs over the next several 
decades. 
3.7.1 
Factors affecting CO2 capture cost
Published estimates for CO2 capture costs vary widely, mainly 
as a result of different assumptions regarding technical 
factors related to plant design and operation (e.g., plant size, 
net�efficiency,�fuel�properties�and�load�factor),�as�well�as�key�
economic�and�financial�factors�such�as�fuel�cost,�interest�rates�
and plant lifetime. A number of recent papers have addressed 
this�issue�and�identified�the�principal�sources�of�cost�differences�
and variability (Herzog, 1999; Simbeck, 1999; Rubin and Rao, 
2003). This section draws heavily on Rubin and Rao (2003) to 
highlight the major factors affecting the cost of CO2 capture.
3.7.1.1�
Defining�the�technology�of�interest�
Costs will vary with the choice of CO2 capture technology and 
the choice of power system or industrial process that generates 
the CO2 emissions. In engineering-economic studies of a single 
plant or CO2�capture�technology,�such�definitions�are�usually�
clear. However, where larger systems are being analyzed, such 
as in regional, national or global studies of CO2 mitigation 
options,�the�specific�technologies�assumed�for�CO2 production 
and�capture�may�be�unclear�or�unspecified.�In�such�cases,�the�
context for reported cost results also may be unclear.
3.7.1.2�
Defining�the�system�boundary�
Any�economic�assessment�should�clearly�define�the�‘system’�
whose CO2 emissions and cost is being characterized. The most 
common assumption in studies of CO2 capture is a single facility 
(most often a power plant) that captures CO2 and transports it to 
an off-site storage area such as a geologic formation. The CO2 
emissions considered are those released at the facility before 
and after capture. Reported costs may or may not include CO2 
transport and storage costs. The system boundary of interest in 
this section of the report includes only the power plant or other 
process of interest and does not include CO2 transport and 
storage systems, whose costs are presented in later chapters. 
CO2 compression, however, is assumed to occur within the 
facility boundary and therefore the cost of compression is 
included in the cost of capture.3
 
In some studies the system boundary includes emissions of 
3 Alternatively, compression costs could be attributed wholly or in part to CO2 
transport and storage. Most studies, however, include compression with capture 
cost. This also facilitates comparisons of capture technologies that operate at 
different�pressures,�and�thus�incur�different�costs�to�achieve�a�specified�final�
pressure.
Chapter 3: Capture of CO2
147
CO2 and other greenhouse gases such as methane (expressed 
as equivalent CO2) over the complete fuel cycle encompassing 
not only the power plant or facility in question, but also the 
‘upstream’�processes�of�extraction,�refining�and�transport�of�fuel�
used at the facility, plus any ‘downstream’ emissions from the 
use or storage of captured CO2. Still larger system boundaries 
might include all power plants in a utility company’s system; 
all plants in a regional or national grid; or a national economy 
where power plant and industrial emissions are but one element 
of the overall energy system being modelled. In each of these 
cases it is possible to derive a mitigation cost for CO2, but the 
results�are�not�directly�comparable�because�they�reflect�different�
system boundaries and considerations. Chapter 8 discusses such 
differences in more detail and presents results for alternative 
systems of interest.
3.7.1.3�
�Defining�the�technology�time�frame�and�maturity�
Another factor that is often unclear in economic evaluations of 
CO2 capture is the assumed time frame and/or level of maturity 
for the technology under study. Does the cost estimate apply to 
a facility that would be built today, or at some future time? This 
is especially problematic in studies of ‘advanced’ technologies 
that are still under development and not currently commercial. 
In most cases, studies of advanced technologies assume that 
costs apply to an ‘nth plant’ to be built sometime in the future 
when� the� technology� is� mature.� Such� estimates� reflect� the�
expected� benefits� of� technological� learning,� but� may� or� may�
not adequately account for the increased costs that typically 
occur in the early stages of commercialization. The choice of 
technology time frame and assumed rate of cost improvements 
and can therefore make a big difference in CO2 capture cost 
estimates.
3.7.1.4 
Different cost measures and assumptions
The literature reveals a number of different measures used to 
characterize CO2 capture and storage costs, including capital 
cost, cost of electricity, cost of CO2 avoided and others. 
Because some of these measures are reported in the same units 
(e.g., US dollars per tonne of CO2) there is great potential for 
misunderstanding. Furthermore, for any given cost measure, 
different assumptions about the technical, economic and 
financial� parameters� used� in� cost� calculations� can� also� give�
rise to large differences in reported capture costs. Section 3.7.2 
elaborates on some of the common metrics of cost and the 
parameters they employ.
3.7.2 
Measures of CO2 capture cost
We�define�four�common�measures�of�CO2 capture cost here: 
capital cost, incremental product cost (such as the cost of 
electricity), cost of CO2 avoided and cost of CO2 captured 
or removed. Each of these measures provides a different 
perspective on CO2 capture cost for a particular technology 
or system of interest. All of them, however, represent an 
‘engineering economic’ perspective showing the added cost of 
capturing CO2 in a particular application. Such measures are 
required to address larger questions such as which options or 
strategies to pursue - a topic addressed later in Chapter 8.
3.7.2.1 
 Capital cost
Capital� cost� (also� known� as� investment� cost� or� first� cost)�
is a widely used, albeit incomplete, metric of the cost of a 
technology. It is often reported on a normalized basis (e.g., cost 
per kW). For CO2 capture systems, the capital cost is generally 
assumed to represent the total expenditure required to design, 
purchase and install the system of interest. It may also include 
the additional costs of other plant components not needed in 
the absence of a CO2 capture device, such as the costs of an 
upstream�gas�purification�system�to�protect�the�capture�device.�
Such costs often arise in complex facilities like a power plant. 
Thus, the total incremental cost of CO2 capture for a given 
plant design is best determined as the difference in total cost 
between plants with and without CO2 capture, producing the 
same amounts of useful (primary) product, such as electricity.
 
Different organizations employ different systems of accounts 
to specify the elements of a capital cost estimate. For electric 
power� plants,� one� widely� used� procedure� is� that� defined� by�
the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI, 1993). However, 
because there is no universally employed nomenclature 
or system of accounts, capital costs reported by different 
organizations or authors may not always include the same items. 
The terms used to report capital costs may further disguise such 
differences and lead to misunderstandings about what is and is 
not included. For example, power plant cost studies often report 
a value of capital cost that does not include the cost of interest 
during construction or other so-called ‘owners costs’ that 
typically add at least 10-20% (sometimes substantially more) 
to the ‘total capital requirement’ of a system. Only if a capital 
cost breakdown is reported can such omissions be discovered. 
Studies that fail to report the year of a cost estimate introduce 
further uncertainty that may affect cost comparisons.
3.7.2.2 
Incremental product cost
The effect of CO2 capture on the cost of electricity (or other 
product) is one of the most important measures of economic 
impact. Electric power plants, a major source of CO2 emissions, 
are of particular interest in this regard. The cost electricity 
(COE) for a power plant can be calculated as:4
COE = [(TCR)(FCF) + (FOM)]/[(CF)(8760)(kW)] + VOM + 
(HR)(FC) 
(7)
where, COE = levelized cost of electricity (US$ kWh-1), TCR 
=�total�capital�requirement�(US$),�FCF�=�fixed�charge�factor�
(fraction yr-1),�FOM�=�fixed�operating�costs�(US$�yr-1), VOM 
= variable operating costs (US$ kWh-1), HR = net plant heat 
rate (kJ kWh-1), FC = unit fuel cost (US$ kJ-1), CF = capacity 
4 For simplicity, the value of FCF in Equation (7) is applied to the total capital 
requirement. More detailed calculations of COE based on a year-by-year 
analysis apply the FCF to the total capital cost excluding owner’s costs (such 
as interest during construction), which are separately accounted for in the years 
prior to plant start-up.
148
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
factor (fraction), 8760 = total hours in a typical year and kW 
= net plant power (kW). In this chapter, the costs in Equation 
(7) include only the power plant and capture technologies and 
not the additional costs of CO2 transport and storage that are 
required for a complete system with CCS. The incremental 
COE is the difference in electricity cost with and without CO2 
capture.5 Again, the values reported here exclude transport and 
storage costs. Full CCS costs are reported in Chapter 8.
 
Equation (7) shows that many factors affect this incremental 
cost. For example, just as the total capital cost includes many 
different�items,�so�too�do�the�fixed�and�variable�costs�associated�
with plant operation and maintenance (O&M). Similarly, the 
fixed�charge�factor�(FCF,�also�known�as�the�capital�recovery�
factor)� reflects� assumptions� about� the� plant� lifetime� and� the�
effective interest rate (or discount rate) used to amortize capital 
costs.6 Assumptions about any of the factors in Equation (7) 
can have a pronounced effect on overall cost results. Nor are 
these factors all independent of one another. For example, the 
design heat rate of a new power plant may affect the total capital 
requirement�since�high-efficiency�plants�usually�are�more�costly�
than�lower-efficiency�designs.
 
Finally, because several of the parameter values in Equation 
(7) may change over the operating life of a facility (such as 
the capacity factor, unit fuel cost, or variable operating costs), 
the value of COE also may vary from year to year. To include 
such effects, an economic evaluation would calculate the net 
present value (NPV) of discounted costs based on a schedule of 
year-to-year cost variations, in lieu of the simpler formulation 
of Equation (7). However, most engineering-economic studies 
use Equation (7) to calculate a single value of ‘levelized’ COE 
over the assumed life of the plant. The levelized COE is the 
cost of electricity, which, if sustained over the operating life of 
the plant, would produce the same NPV as an assumed stream 
of variable year-to-year costs. In most economic studies of CO2 
capture, however, all parameter values in Equation (7) are held 
constant,�reflecting�(either�implicitly�or�explicitly)�a�levelized�
COE over the life of the plant.7
3.7.2.3 
Cost of CO2 avoided
One of the most widely used measures for the cost of CO2 capture 
and storage is the ‘cost of CO2�avoided.’�This�value�reflects�the�
average cost of reducing atmospheric CO2 mass emissions by 
one unit while providing the same amount of useful product as 
a ‘reference plant’ without CCS. For an electric power plant the 
avoidance�cost�can�be�defined�as:�
5 For CO2 capture systems with large auxiliary energy requirements, the 
magnitude of incremental cost also depends on whether the plant with capture 
is assumed to be a larger facility producing the same net output as the reference 
plant without capture, or whether the reference plant is simply derated to supply 
the auxiliary energy. While the latter assumption is most common, the former 
yields a smaller incremental cost due to economy-of-scale effects.
6 In its simplest form, FCF can be calculated from the project lifetime, n (years), 
and annual interest rate, i (fraction), by the equation: FCF = i / [1 – (1 + i)–n ].
7 Readers not familiar with these economic concepts and calculations may wish 
to consult a basic economics text, or references such as (EPRI, 1993) or (Rubin, 
2001) for more details.
 
Cost of CO2 avoided (US$/tCO2) = 
[(COE)capture – (COE)ref] / [(CO2 kWh-1)ref – (CO2 kWh-1)capture]   
(8)
where, COE = levelized cost of electricity (US$ kWh-1) as given 
by Equation (7) and CO2 kWh-1 = CO2 mass emission rate (in 
tonnes) per kWh generated, based on the net plant capacity for 
each case. The subscripts ‘capture’ and ‘ref’ refer to the plant 
with and without CO2 capture, respectively. Note that while this 
equation is commonly used to report a cost of CO2 avoided for 
the capture portion of a full CCS system, strictly speaking it 
should be applied only to a complete CCS system including 
transport and storage costs (since all elements are required to 
avoid emissions to the atmosphere).
 
The choice of the reference plant without CO2 capture plays 
a key role in determining the CO2 avoidance cost. Here the 
reference plant is assumed to be a plant of the same type and 
design as the plant with CO2 capture. This provides a consistent 
basis for reporting the incremental cost of CO2 capture for a 
particular type of facility. 
 
Using Equation (8), a cost of CO2 avoided can be calculated 
for any two plant types, or any two aggregates of plants. 
Thus, special care should be taken to ensure that the basis 
for a reported cost of CO2 avoided is clearly understood or 
conveyed. For example, the avoidance cost is sometimes 
taken as a measure of the cost to society of reducing GHG 
emissions.8 In that case, the cost per tonne of CO2 avoided 
reflects�the�average�cost�of�moving�from�one�situation�(e.g.,�the�
current mix of power generation fuels and technologies) to a 
different mix of technologies having lower overall emissions. 
Alternatively, some studies compare individual plants with and 
without capture (as we do), but assume different types of plants 
for the two cases. Such studies, for example, might compare 
a� coal-fired� plant� with� capture� to� an� NGCC� reference� plant�
without�capture.�Such�cases�reflect�a�different�choice�of�system�
boundaries and address very different questions, than those 
addressed here. However, the data presented in this section 
(comparing the same type of plant with and without capture) 
can be used to estimate a cost of CO2 avoided for any two of the 
systems of interest in a particular situation (see Chapter 8).
3.7.2.4 
 Cost of CO2 captured or removed
Another cost measure frequently reported in the literature is 
based on the mass of CO2 captured (or removed) rather than 
emissions�avoided.�For�an�electric�power�plant�it�can�be�defined�
as:
Cost of CO2 Captured (US$/tCO2) =  
[(COE)capture – (COE)ref] / (CO2, captured kWh-1) 
(9)
8 As used here, ‘cost’ refers only to money spent for technology, fuels and 
related materials, and not to broader societal measures such as macroeconomic 
costs or societal damage costs associated with atmospheric emissions. Further 
discussions and use of the term ‘cost of CO2 avoided’ appear in Chapter 8 and 
in the references cited earlier.
Chapter 3: Capture of CO2
149
where, CO2, captured kWh-1 = total mass of CO2 captured (in 
tonnes) per net kWh for the plant with capture. This measure 
reflects�the�economic�viability�of�a�CO2 capture system given a 
market price for CO2 (as an industrial commodity). If the CO2 
captured at a power plant can be sold at this price (e.g., to the 
food industry, or for enhanced oil recovery), the COE for the 
plant with capture would be the same as for the reference plant 
having higher CO2 emissions. Numerically, the cost of CO2 
captured is lower than the cost of CO2 avoided because the 
energy required to operate the CO2 capture systems increases 
the amount of CO2 emitted per unit of product. 
3.7.2.5 
 Importance of CCS energy requirements
As the energy requirement for CCS is substantially larger 
than for other emission control systems, it has important 
implications for plant economics as well as for resource 
requirements and environmental impacts. The energy ‘penalty’ 
(as it is often called) enters cost calculations in one of two ways. 
Most commonly, all energy needed to operate CCS absorbers, 
compressors, pumps and other equipment is assumed to be 
provided within the plant boundary, thus lowering the net plant 
capacity (kW) and output (kWh, in the case of a power plant). 
The result, as shown by Equation (7), is a higher unit capital 
cost (US$ kW-1) and a higher cost of electricity production (US$ 
kWh-1).�Effectively,�these�higher�unit�costs�reflect�the�expense�
of building and operating the incremental capacity needed to 
operate the CCS system. 
 
Alternatively, some studies - particularly for industrial 
processes such as hydrogen production - assume that some or 
all of the energy needed to operate the CCS system is purchased 
from outside the plant boundary at some assumed price. Still 
other studies assume that new equipment is installed to generate 
auxiliary energy on-site. In these cases, the net plant capacity and 
output may or may not change and may even increase. However, 
the COE in Equation (7) again will rise due to the increases in 
VOM costs (for purchased energy) and (if applicable) capital 
costs for additional equipment. The assumption of purchased 
power, however, does not guarantee a full accounting of the 
replacement costs or CO2 emissions associated with CCS. In 
all cases, however, the larger the CCS energy requirement, the 
greater the difference between the costs of CO2 captured and 
avoided. 
3.7.2.6 
Other measures of cost
The cost measures above characterize the expense of adding 
CO2 capture to a single plant of a given type and operating 
profile.�A�broader�modelling�framework�is�needed�to�address�
questions involving multiple plants (e.g., a utility system, 
regional grid, or national network), or decisions about what 
type of plant to build (and when). Macroeconomic models that 
include emission control costs as elements of a more complex 
framework typically yield cost measures such as the change 
in gross domestic product (GDP) from the imposition of a 
carbon constraint, along with changes in the average cost of 
electricity and cost per tonne of CO2 abated. Such measures 
are�often�useful�for�policy�analysis,�but�reflect�many�additional�
assumptions about the structure of an economy as well as 
the cost of technology. Chapter 8 provides a discussion of 
macroeconomic modelling as it relates to CO2 capture costs.
3.7.3 
The context for current cost estimates
Recall that CO2 capture, while practiced today in some industrial 
applications, is not currently a commercial technology used at 
large electric power plants, which are the focus of most CCS 
studies. Thus, cost estimates for CO2 capture systems rely 
mainly on studies of hypothetical plants. Published studies also 
differ�significantly�in�the�assumptions�used�for�cost�estimation.�
Equation (7), for example, shows that the plant capacity factor 
has a major impact on the cost of electric power generation, 
as do the plant lifetime and discount rate used to compute the 
fixed�charge�factor.�The�COE,�in�turn,�is�a�key�element�of�CO2 
avoidance cost, Equation (8). Thus, a high plant capacity factor 
or�a�low�fixed�charge�rate�will�lower�the�cost�of�CO2 capture 
per kWh. The choice of other important parameters, such as 
the�plant�size,�efficiency,�fuel�type�and�CO2 removal rate will 
similarly affect the CO2 capture cost. Less apparent, but often 
equally important, are assumptions about parameters such as the 
‘contingency cost factors’ embedded in capital cost estimates 
to�account�for�unspecified�costs�anticipated�for�technologies�at�
an early stage of development, or for commercial systems that 
have not yet been demonstrated for the application, location, or 
plant scale under study.
 
Because of the variability of assumptions employed in 
different studies of CO2 capture, a systematic comparison of cost 
results is not straightforward (or even possible in most cases). 
Moreover, there is no universally ‘correct’ set of assumptions 
that apply to all the parameters affecting CO2 capture cost. For 
example, the quality and cost of natural gas or coal delivered 
to power plants in Europe and the United States may differ 
markedly. Similarly, the cost of capital for a municipal or 
government-owned�utility�may�be�significantly�lower�than�for�a�
privately-owned utility operating in a competitive market. These 
and other factors lead to real differences in CO2 capture costs 
for a given technology or power generation system. Thus, we 
seek in this report to elucidate the key assumptions employed 
in different studies of similar systems and technologies and 
their resulting impact on the cost of CO2 capture. Analyses 
comparing the costs of alternative systems on an internally 
consistent basis (within a particular study) also are highlighted. 
Nor are all studies equally credible, considering their vintage, 
data sources, level of detail and extent of peer review. Thus, 
the approach adopted here is to rely as much as possible on 
recent peer-reviewed literature, together with other publicly-
available studies by governmental and private organizations 
heavily�involved�in�the�field�of�CO2 capture. Later, in Chapter 8, 
the range of capture costs reported here are combined with cost 
estimates for CO2 transport and storage to arrive at estimates 
of the overall cost of CCS for selected power systems and 
industrial processes.

3.7.4 
Overview of technologies and systems evaluated
Economic studies of CO2 capture have focused mainly on 
electric power generation, a major source of CO2 emissions. 
To a lesser extent, CO2 capture from industrial processes also 
has been subject to economic evaluations, especially processes 
producing hydrogen, often in combination with other products.
 
The sections below review and summarize recent estimates 
of CO2 capture costs for major systems of interest. Sections 
3.7.5� to� 3.7.8� focus� first� on� the� cost� of� current� CO2 capture 
technologies, while Sections 3.7.10 to 3.7.12 go on to discuss 
improved or ‘advanced’ technologies promising lower costs in 
the�future.�In�all�cases�the�system�boundary�is�defined�as�a�single�
facility at which CO2 is captured and compressed for delivery 
to�a�transport�and�storage�system.�To�reflect�different�levels�of�
confidence�(or�uncertainty)�in�cost�estimates�for�technologies�
at different stages of development, the qualitative descriptors 
shown in Table 3.6 are applied in summarizing published cost 
estimates.9 The studies reviewed typically report costs in US 
dollars for reference years ranging from 2000 to early 2004. 
Because�inflation�effects�generally�have�been�small�during�this�
period no adjustments have been made in summarizing ranges 
of reported costs.
3.7.5 
Post-combustion CO2 capture cost for electric 
power plants (current technology)
Most of the world’s electricity is currently generated from 
the combustion of fossil fuels, especially coal and (to an 
increasing extent) natural gas. Hence, the ability to capture and 
store the CO2 emitted by such plants has been a major focus 
of investigation. This section of the report focuses on the cost 
of currently available technology for CO2 capture. Because 
of the relatively low CO2� concentration� in� power� plant� flue�
gases, chemical absorption systems have been the dominant 
technology of interest for post-combustion capture (see Section 
3.3.2). However, the cost of CO2 capture depends not only on 
9 These descriptions are used in subsequent tables to characterize systems with 
CO2 capture. In most cases the cost estimates for reference plants (without 
capture) would rank as high (e.g., IGCC power plants) or very high (e.g., PC 
and NGCC power plants).
the choice of capture technology, but also - and often more 
importantly - on the characteristics and design of the overall 
power plant. For purposes of cost reporting, we distinguish 
between�coal-fired�and�gas-fired�plant�designs�and�between�new�
and existing facilities.
3.7.5.1�
New�coal-fired�power�plants
Table 3.7 summarizes the key assumptions and results of recent 
studies of post-combustion CO2� capture� at� new� coal-fired�
power plants. Assumed plant sizes with CO2 capture range from 
approximately 300-700 MW net power output. In all cases, 
CO2 capture is accomplished using an amine-based absorption 
system,�typically�MEA.�Capture�efficiencies�range�from�85-95%�
with the most common value being 90%. The studies employ 
different assumptions about other key parameters such as the 
base� power� plant� efficiency,� coal� properties,� coal� cost,� plant�
capacity factor, CO2�product�pressure�and�financial�parameters�
such�as�the�fixed�charge�factor.�All�of�these�factors�have�a�direct�
influence�on�total�plant�cost�and�the�cost�of�CO2 capture.
 
Table 3.7 summarizes several measures of CO2 capture cost, 
both in absolute and relative terms. Across the full set of studies, 
CO2 capture adds 44-87% to the capital cost of the reference 
plant (US$ kW-1) and 42-81% to the cost of electricity (US$ 
MWh-1), while achieving CO2 reductions of approximately 
80-90% per net kWh produced. The cost of CO2 avoided for 
these cases varies from 29-51 US$/tCO2. The absolute values 
of capital cost, COE and incremental cost of electricity in 
Table�3.7�reflect�the�different�assumptions�employed�in�each�
study. The result is an incremental COE of 18-38 US$ MWh-1 
(or US$ 0.018-0.038 kWh-1) for CO2 capture. The total COE 
for plants with capture ranges from 62-87 US$ MWh-1. In all 
cases,�a�significant�portion�of�the�total�CO2 capture cost is due 
to the energy requirement for CO2 capture and compression. For 
the studies in Table 3.7, the plants with CO2 capture require 
24-42% more fuel input per MWh of plant output relative to 
a similar reference plant without capture. Roughly half the 
energy is required for solvent regeneration and a third for CO2 
compression.
 
While many factors contribute to the cost differences 
observed�in�Table�3.7,�systematic�studies�of�the�influence�of�
different factors indicate that the most important sources of 
variability in reported cost results are assumptions about the 
table 3.6 Confidence levels for technology and system cost estimates.

IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
CO2 capture�system�energy�requirement,�power�plant�efficiency,�
fuel�type,�plant�capacity�factor�and�fixed�charge�rate�(Rao�and�
Rubin, 2002). In this regard, it is useful to note that the lowest-
cost capture systems in Table 3.7 (in terms of COE and cost of 
CO2 avoided) come from a recent study (IEA GHG, 2004) that 
combines� an� efficient� supercritical� power� plant� design� using�
bituminous�coal,�with�high�plant�utilization,�lowest�fixed�charge�
rate�and�more�energy-efficient�amine�system�designs,�as�recently�
announced by two major vendors (but not yet demonstrated on 
coal-fired�power�plants).�In�contrast,�the�highest�reported�COE�
values�are�for�less�efficient�subcritical�plant�designs�using�low�
rank�coal,�combined�with�lower�capacity�factors,�higher�fixed�
charge rates and employing amine system designs typical of 
units currently in operation at small power plants. 
 
Recent increases in world coal prices, if sustained, also 
would affect the levelized COE values reported here. Based on 
one recent study (IEA GHG, 2004), each 1.00 US$ GJ-1 increase 
in coal price would increase the COE by 8.2 US$ MWh-1 for a 
new PC plant without capture and by 10.1 US$ MWh-1 for a 
plant with capture.
 
These results indicate that new power plants equipped 
with CO2�capture�are�likely�to�be�high-efficiency�supercritical�
units, which yield lowest overall costs. The worldwide use of 
supercritical units (without capture) with current usage at 155 
GWe (Section 3.1.2.2), is rapidly increasing in several regions of 
the world and, as seen in Table 3.7, the preponderance of recent 
studies of CO2 capture are based on supercritical units using 
bituminous coals. For these plants, Table 3.7 shows that capture 
systems increase the capital cost by 44-74% and the COE by 
42-66% (18-34 US$ MWh-1). The major factors contributing 
to these ranges were differences in plant size, capacity factor 
and�fixed�charge�factor.�New�or�improved�capture�systems�and�
power plant designs that promise to further reduce the costs of 
CO2 capture are discussed later in Section 3.7.7. First, however, 
we examine CO2 capture costs at existing plants.
3.7.5.2�
Existing�coal-fired�plants
Compared to the study of new plants, CO2 capture options for 
existing power plants have received relatively little study to date. 
Table 3.8 summarizes the assumptions and results of several 
studies�estimating�the�cost�of�retrofitting�an�amine-based�CO2 
capture�system�to�an�existing�coal-fired�power�plant.�Several�
factors�significantly�affect�the�economics�of�retrofits,�especially�
the�age,�smaller�sizes�and�lower�efficiencies�typical�of�existing�
plants relative to new builds. The energy requirement for CO2 
capture� also� is� usually� higher� because� of� less� efficient� heat�
integration for sorbent regeneration. All of these factors lead to 
higher�overall�costs.�Existing�plants�not�yet�equipped�with�a�flue�
gas desulphurization (FGD) system for SO2 control also must 
be�retrofitted�or�upgraded�for�high-efficiency�sulphur�capture�in�
addition to the CO2 capture device. For plants with high NOx 
levels, a NO2 removal system also may be required to minimize 
solvent�loss�from�reactions�with�acid�gases.�Finally,�site-specific�
difficulties,�such�as�land�availability,�access�to�plant�areas�and�
the need for special ductwork, tend to further increase the 
capital�cost�of�any�retrofit�project�relative�to�an�equivalent�new�
plant installation. Nonetheless, in cases where the capital cost 
of the existing plant has been fully or substantially amortized, 
Table�3.8�shows�that�the�COE�of�a�retrofitted�plant�with�capture�
(including all new capital requirements) can be comparable to 
or lower than that of a new plant, although the incremental COE 
is typically higher because of the factors noted above.
 
Table 3.8 further shows that for comparable levels of 
about 85% CO2 reduction per kWh, the average cost of CO2 
avoided�for�retrofits�is�about�35%�higher�than�for�the�new�plants�
analyzed in Table 3.7. The incremental capital cost and COE 
depend� strongly� on� site-specific� assumptions,� including� the�
degree of amortization and options for providing process energy 
needs. As with new plants, heat and power for CO2 capture are 
usually assumed to be provided by the base (reference) plant, 
resulting in a sizeable (30 to 40%) plant output reduction. Other 
studies�assume�that�an�auxiliary�gas-fired�boiler�is�constructed�
to provide the CO2 capture steam requirements and (in some 
cases) additional power. Low natural gas prices can make this 
option more attractive than plant output reduction (based on 
COE), but such systems yield lower CO2 reductions (around 
60%) since the emissions from natural gas combustion are 
typically not captured. For this reason, the avoided cost values 
for this option are not directly comparable to those with higher 
CO2 reductions.
 
Also� reflected� in� Table� 3.8� is� the� option� of� rebuilding�
an existing boiler and steam turbine as a supercritical unit 
to� gain� efficiency� improvements� in� conjunction� with� CO2 
capture. One recent study (Gibbins et al., 2005) suggests this 
option could be economically attractive in conjunction with 
CO2�capture�since�the�more�efficient�unit�minimizes�the�cost�
of capture and yields a greater net power output and a lower 
COE�compared�to�a�simple�retrofit.�The�use�of�a�new�and�less�
energy-intensive capture unit yields further cost reductions 
in this study. Another recent study similarly concluded that 
the most economical approach to CO2 capture for an existing 
coal-fired�plant�was�to�combine�CO2 capture with repowering 
the unit with an ultra-supercritical steam system (Simbeck, 
2004). One additional option, repowering an existing unit 
with� a� coal� gasifier,� is� discussed� later� in� Section� 3.7.6.2.
3.7.5.3�
Natural�gas-fired�power�plants
Power� plants� fuelled� by� natural� gas� may� include� gas-fired�
boilers, simple-cycle gas turbines, or natural gas combined cycle 
(NGCC) units. The current operating capacity in use globally 
is 333 GWe� for� gas-fired� boilers,� 214� GWe for simple cycle 
gas turbines and 339 GWe for NGCC (IEA WEO, 2004). The 
absence of sulphur and other impurities in natural gas reduces 
the� capital� costs� associated� with� auxiliary� flue� gas� clean-up�
systems required for amine-based CO2 capture technology. On 
the other hand, the lower concentration of CO2�in�gas-fired�units�
tends to increase the cost per tonne of CO2 captured or avoided 
relative�to�coal-fired�units.�
 
Table 3.9 summarizes the assumptions and cost results of 
several recent studies of CO2� capture� at� gas-fired� combined�
cycle power plants ranging in size from approximately 300-700 
MW. Relative to reference plants without capture, to achieve net

Chapter 3: Capture of CO2

CO2 reductions (per kWh) of the order of 83-88%, the capital 
cost per kW increases by 64-100%, while the COE increases 
by 37-69%, or by 12-24 US$ MWh-1 on an absolute basis. The 
corresponding cost of CO2 avoided ranges from 37-74 US$/
tCO2, while the CCS energy requirement increases plant fuel 
consumption per kWh by 11-22%.
 
As seen earlier in Equations (7) to (9), assumptions about 
the�plant�fuel�cost�have�an�especially�important�influence�on�the�
COE�for�gas-fired�plants�because�the�contribution�of�capital�costs�
is relatively low compared to coal plants. The studies in Table 
3.9 assume stable gas prices of 2.82-4.44 US$ GJ-1 (LHV basis) 
over the life of the plant, together with high capacity factors 
(65-95%) representing base load operation. These assumptions 
result in relatively low values of COE for both the reference 
plant and capture plant. Since about 2002, however, natural gas 
prices�have�increased�significantly�in�many�parts�of�the�world,�
which has also affected the outlook for future prices. Based 
on the assumptions of one recent study (IEA GHG, 2004), the 
COE for an NGCC plant without capture would increase by 
6.8 US$ MWh-1 for each 1.00 US$ GJ-1 increase in natural gas 
price (assuming no change in plant utilization or other factors 
of production). An NGCC plant with CCS would see a slightly 
higher increase of 7.3 US$ MWh-1. The price of natural gas, 
and its relation to the price of competing fuels like coal, is 
an important determinant of which type of power plant will 
provide the lowest cost electricity in the context of a particular 
situation. However, across a twofold increase in gas price (from 
3-6 US$ GJ-1), the incremental cost of CO2 capture changed by 
only 2 US$ MWh-1 (US$ 0.002 kWh-1) with all other factors 
held constant.
 
In countries like the US, higher gas prices have also resulted 
in lower utilization rates (averaging 30-50%) for plants originally 
designed for base-load operation, but where lower-cost coal 
plants are available for dispatch. This further raises the average 
cost of electricity and CO2 capture for those NGCC plants, as 
reflected�in�one�case�in�Table�3.9�with�a�capacity�factor�of�50%.�
In other parts of the world, however, lower-cost coal plants may 
not be available, or gas supply contracts might limit the ability 
to curtail gas use. Such situations again illustrate that options 
for power generation with or without CO2 capture should be 
evaluated in the context of a particular situation or scenario.
 
Studies of commercial post-combustion CO2 capture 
applied to simple-cycle gas turbines have been conducted for 
the�special�case�of�retrofitting�an�auxiliary�power�generator�in�
a remote location (CCP, 2005). This study reported a relatively 
high cost of 88 US$/tCO2 avoided. Studies of post-combustion 
capture� for� gas-fired� boilers� have� been� limited� to� industrial�
applications, as discussed later in Section 3.7.8. 
3.7.5.4�
Biomass-firing�and�co-firing�systems
Power plants can be designed to be fuelled solely by biomass, 
or�biomass�can�be�co-fired�in�conventional�coal-burning�plants.�
The requirement to reduce net CO2 emissions could lead to 
an increased use of biomass fuel, because plants that utilize 
biomass as a primary or supplemental fuel may be able to take 
credit for the carbon removed from the atmosphere during the 
biomass growth cycle. If the biomass carbon released during 
combustion (as CO2) is then captured and stored, the net 
quantity of CO2 emitted to the atmosphere could in principle 
be negative.
 
The most important factor affecting the economics of biomass 
use is the cost of the biomass. This can range from a negative 
value, as in the case of some biomass wastes, to costs substantially 
higher than coal, as in the case of some purposely-grown biomass 
fuels, or wastes that have to be collected from diffuse sources. 
Power plants that use only biomass are typically smaller than 
coal-fired�plants�because�local�availability�of�biomass�is�often�
limited and biomass is more bulky and hence more expensive 
to�transport�than�coal.�The�smaller�sizes�of�biomass-fired�plants�
would�normally�result�in�lower�energy�efficiencies�and�higher�
costs of CO2� capture.� Biomass� can� be� co-fired� with� coal� in�
larger plants (Robinson et al., 2003). In such circumstances the 
incremental costs of capturing biomass-derived CO2 should be 
similar to costs of capturing coal-derived CO2. Another option is 
to�convert�biomass�into�pellets�or�refined�liquid�fuels�to�reduce�
the cost of transporting it over long distances. However, there are 
costs�and�emissions�associated�with�production�of�these�refined�
fuels. Information on costs of CO2� capture� at� biomass-fired�
plants is sparse but some information is given in Section 3.7.8.4. 
The overall economics of CCS with biomass combustion will 
depend very much on local circumstances, especially biomass 
availability and cost and (as with fossil fuels) proximity to 
potential CO2 storage sites. 
3.7.6 
Pre-combustion CO2 capture cost for electric 
power plants (current technology)
Studies of pre-combustion capture for electric power plants 
have focused mainly on IGCC systems using coal or other 
solid fuels such as petroleum coke. This section of the report 
focuses on currently available technology for CO2 capture at 
such plants. As before, the cost of CO2 capture depends not 
only on the choice of capture technology, but more importantly 
on the characteristics and design of the overall power plant, 
including�the�fuel�type�and�choice�of�gasifier.�Because�IGCC�
is not widely used for electric power generation at the present 
time, economic studies of IGCC power plants typically employ 
design assumptions based on the limited utility experience 
with IGCC systems and the more extensive experience with 
gasification�in�industrial�sectors�such�as�petroleum�refining�and�
petrochemicals.�For�oxygen-blown�gasifiers,�the�high�operating�
pressure and relatively high CO2 concentrations achievable in 
IGCC systems makes physical solvent absorption systems the 
predominant technology of interest for pre-combustion CO2 
capture (see Section 3.5.2.11). For purposes of cost reporting, 
we again distinguish between new plant designs and the 
retrofitting�of�existing�facilities.�
3.7.6.1�
New�coal�gasification�combined�cycle�power�plants
Table 3.10 summarizes the key assumptions and results of 
several recent studies of CO2 capture costs for new IGCC 
power plants ranging in size from approximately 400-800 MW

influence�total�plant�cost�and�the�cost�of�CO2 capture include 
the fuel cost, CO2 product pressure, plant capacity factor and 
fixed�charge�factor.�Many�of�the�recent�studies�also�include�the�
cost�of�a�spare�gasifier�to�ensure�high�system�reliability.�
 
Table 3.10 indicates that for studies based on the Texaco 
or� E-Gas� gasifiers,� CO2 capture adds approximately 20-40% 
to both the capital cost (US$ kW-1) and the cost of electricity 
(US$ MWh-1) of the reference IGCC plants, while studies 
10� In� 2004,� the� Texaco� gasifier� was� re-named� as� the� GE� gasifier� following�
acquisition by GE Energy (General Electric). However, this report uses the 
name Texaco, as it is referred to in the original references cited.
using� the� Shell� gasifier� report� increases� of� roughly� 30-65%.�
The total COE reported for IGCC systems ranges from 41-
61 US$ MWh-1 without capture and 54-79 US$ MWh-1 with 
capture.� With� capture,� the� lowest� COE� is� found� for� gasifier�
systems with quench cooling designs that have lower thermal 
efficiencies�than�the�more�capital-intensive�designs�with�heat�
recovery systems. Without capture, however, the latter system 
type has the lowest COE in Table 3.10. Across all studies, the 
cost of CO2 avoided ranges from 13-37 US$/tCO2 relative to 
an IGCC without capture, excluding transport and storage 
costs. Part of the reason for this lower incremental cost of CO2 
capture relative to coal combustion plants is the lower average 
energy requirement for IGCC systems. Another key factor is the 
smaller�gas�volume�treated�in�oxygen-blown�gasifier�systems,�
which substantially reduces equipment size and cost. 
 
As with PC plants, Table 3.10 again emphasizes the 
importance�of�plant�financing�and�utilization�assumptions�on�
the calculated cost of electricity, which in turn affects CO2-
capture costs. The lowest COE values in this table are for plants 
with� a� low� fixed� charge� rate� and� high� capacity� factor,� while�
158
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
substantially�higher�COE�values�result�from�high�financing�costs�
and lower plant utilization. Similarly, the type and properties 
of coal assumed has a major impact on the COE, as seen in 
a recent Canadian Clean Power Coalition study, which found 
substantially higher costs for low-rank coals using a Texaco-
based IGCC system (Stobbs and Clark, 2005, Table 3.10). 
EPRI also reports higher IGCC costs for low-rank coals (Holt 
et al., 2003). On the other hand, where plant-level assumptions 
and designs are similar across studies, there is relatively little 
difference in the estimated costs of CO2 capture based on current 
commercial technology. Similarly, the several studies in Tables 
3.7 and 3.10 that estimate costs for both IGCC and PC plants 
on�an�internally�consistent�basis,�all�find�that�IGCC�plants�with�
capture have a lower COE than PC plants with capture. There 
is�not�yet�a�high�degree�of�confidence�in�these�cost�estimates,�
however (see Table 3.6).
 
The�costs�in�Table�3.10�also�reflect�efforts�in�some�studies�
to identify least-cost CO2 capture options. For example, one 
recent study (IEA GHG, 2003) found that capture and disposal 
of hydrogen sulphide (H2S) along with CO2 can reduce overall 
capture costs by about 20% (although this may increase 
transport and storage costs, as discussed in Chapters 4 and 
5). The feasibility of this approach depends in a large part on 
applicable regulatory and permitting requirements. Advanced 
IGCC designs that may further reduce future CO2 capture costs 
are discussed in Section 3.7.7.
3.7.6.2�
Repowering�of�existing�coal-fired�plants�with�IGCC
For�some�existing�coal-fired�power�plants,�an�alternative�to�the�
post-combustion capture systems discussed earlier is repowering 
with�an�IGCC�system.�In�this�case�-�depending�on�site-specific�
circumstances - some existing plant components, such as the 
steam turbine, might be refurbished and utilized as part of an 
IGCC plant. Alternatively, the entire combustion plant might be 
replaced with a new IGCC system while preserving other site 
facilities and infrastructure.
 
Although repowering has been widely studied as an option to 
improve plant performance and increase plant output, there are 
relatively few studies of repowering motivated by CO2 capture. 
Table 3.8 shows results from one recent study (Chen et al., 
2003) which reports CO2 capture costs for IGCC repowering of 
a�250�MW�coal-fired�unit�that�is�assumed�to�be�a�fully�amortized�
(hence, a low COE of 21 US$ MWh-1). IGCC repowering 
yielded a net plant capacity of 600 MW with CO2 capture and 
a COE of 62-67 US$ MWh -1 depending on whether or not the 
existing steam turbine can be reused. The cost of CO2 avoided 
was 46-51 US$/tCO2.� Compared� to� the� option� of� retrofitting�
the existing PC unit with an amine-based capture system and 
retaining the existing boiler (Table 3.8), the COE for IGCC 
repowering�was�estimated�to�be�10-30%�lower.�These�findings�
are in general agreement with earlier studies by Simbeck (1999). 
Because the addition of gas turbines roughly triples the gross 
plant capacity of a steam-electric plant, candidates for IGCC 
repowering are generally limited to smaller existing units (e.g., 
100-300�MW).�Taken�together�with�the�post-combustion�retrofit�
studies in Table 3.8, the most cost-effective options for existing 
plants involve combining CO2 capture with plant upgrades that 
increase�overall�efficiency�and�net�output.�Additional�studies�
would be needed to systematically compare the feasibility and 
cost of IGCC repowering to supercritical boiler upgrades at 
existing�coal-fired�plants.
3.7.7 
CO2 capture cost for hydrogen production and 
multi-product plants (current technology)
While electric power systems have been the dominant 
technologies of interest for CO2 capture studies, other industrial 
processes, including hydrogen production and multi-product 
plants producing a mix of fuels, chemicals and electricity also 
are of interest. Because CO2 capture cost depends strongly 
on the production process in question, several categories of 
industrial processes are discussed below.
3.7.7.1 
Hydrogen production plants
Section 3.5 discussed the potential role of hydrogen as an 
energy carrier and the technological options for its production. 
Here we examine the cost of capturing CO2 normally released 
during the production of hydrogen from fossil fuels. Table 3.11 
shows the key assumptions and cost results of recent studies of 
CO2 capture costs for plants with hydrogen production rates of 
155,000-510,000 Nm3 h-1 (466-1531 MWt), employing either 
natural gas or coal as a feedstock. The CO2�capture�efficiency�
for the hydrogen plant ranges from 87-95% using commercially 
available chemical and physical absorption systems. The CO2 
reduction per unit of product is lower, however, because of the 
process energy requirements and because of additional CO2 
emitted by an offsite power plant assumed in some of these 
studies. As hydrogen production requires the separation of H2 
from CO2, the incremental cost of capture is mainly the cost of 
CO2 compression. 
 
At present, hydrogen is produced mainly from natural gas. 
Two recent studies (see Table 3.11) indicate that CO2 capture 
would add approximately 18-33% to the unit cost of hydrogen 
while reducing net CO2 emissions per unit of H2 product by 
72-83% (after accounting for the CO2 emissions from imported 
electricity). The total cost of hydrogen is sensitive to the cost of 
feedstock, so different gas prices would alter both the absolute 
and relative costs of CO2 capture.
 
For coal-based hydrogen production, a recent study 
(NRC,2004) projects an 8% increase in the unit cost of hydrogen 
for an 83% reduction in CO2 emissions per unit of product. 
Again,�this�figure�includes�the�CO2 emissions from imported 
electricity.
3.7.7.2 
 Multi-product plants 
Multi-product plants (also known as polygeneration plants) 
employ fossil fuel feedstocks to produce a variety of products 
such as electricity, hydrogen, chemicals and liquid fuels. To 
calculate the cost of any particular product (for a given rate 
of return), economic analyses of multi-product plants require 
that�the�selling�price�of�all�other�products�be�specified�over�the�
operating life of the plant. Such assumptions, in addition to 
Chapter 3: Capture of CO2

cost calculations when there is not one dominant product at the 
facility. 
 
Several of the coal-based hydrogen production plants in 
Table 3.11 also produce electricity, albeit in small amounts 
(in fact, smaller than the electricity quantities purchased by 
the stand-alone plants). Most of these studies assume that 
the value of the electricity product is higher under a carbon 
capture regime than without CO2 capture. The result is a 5-33% 
increase in hydrogen production cost for CO2 reductions of 72-
96% per unit of product. The case with the lowest incremental 
product cost and highest CO2 reduction assumes co-disposal of 
H2S with CO2, thus eliminating the costs of sulphur capture and 
recovery. As noted earlier (Section 3.7.6.1), the feasibility of 
this option depends strongly on local regulatory requirements; 
nor�are�higher�costs�for�transport�and�storage�reflected�in�the�
Table 3.11 cost estimate for this case.

producing liquid fuels plus electricity. In these cases the 
amounts of electricity produced are sizeable compared to the 
liquid products, so the assumed selling price of electricity has 
a�major�influence�on�the�product�cost�results.�So�too�does�the�
assumption in two of the cases of co-disposal of H2S with CO2 
(as described above). For these reasons, the incremental cost 
of CO2 capture ranges from a 13% decrease to a 13% increase 
in fuel product cost relative to the no-capture case. Note too 
that the overall level of CO2 reductions per unit of product is 
only�27-56%.�This�is�because�a�significant�portion�of�carbon�
in the coal feedstock is exported with the liquid fuel products. 
Nonetheless,� an� important� benefit� of� these� fuel-processing�
schemes is a reduction (of 30-38%) in the carbon content per 
unit of fuel energy relative to the feedstock fuel. To the extent 
these liquid fuels displace other fuels with higher carbon per unit 
of�energy,�there�is�a�net�benefit�in�end-use�CO2 emissions when 
the fuels are burned. However, no credit for such reductions is 
taken in Table 3.11 because the system boundary considered is 
confined�to�the�fuel�production�plant.
3.7.8 
Capture costs for other industrial processes 
(current technology)
CO2 can be captured in other industrial processes using the 
techniques described earlier for power generation. While the 
costs of capture may vary considerably with the size, type and 
location of industrial processes, such costs will be lowest for 
processes or plants having: streams with relatively high CO2 
concentrations; process plants that normally operate at high load 
factors; plants with large CO2 emission rates; and, processes 
that can utilize waste heat to satisfy the energy requirements 
of CO2 capture systems. Despite these potential advantages, 
little detailed work has been carried out to estimate costs of 
CO2 capture at industrial plants, with most work focused on 
oil�refineries�and�petrochemical�plants.�A�summary�of�currently�
available cost studies appears in Table 3.12.
3.7.8.1�
�Oil�refining�and�petrochemical�plants
Gas-fired� process� heaters� and� steam� boilers� are� responsible�
for the bulk of the CO2�emitted�from�typical�oil�refineries�and�
petrochemical� plants.� Although� refineries� and� petrochemical�
plants emit large quantities of CO2, they include multiple 
emission sources often dispersed over a large area. Economies 
of scale can be achieved by using centralized CO2 absorbers or 
amine�regenerators�but�some�of�the�benefits�are�offset�by�the�cost�
of pipes and ducts. Based on Table 3.14, the cost of capturing 
and compressing CO2� from� refinery� and� petrochemical� plant�
heaters using current technology is estimated to be 50-60 US$/
tCO2 captured. Because of the complexity of these industrial 
facilities, along with proprietary concerns, the incremental cost 
of plant products is not normally reported.
 
High purity CO2 is currently vented to the atmosphere by 
some gas processing and petrochemical plants, as described in 
Chapter 2. The cost of CO2 capture in such cases would be simply 
the cost of drying and compressing the CO2 to the pressure 
required for transport. The cost would depend on various 
factors, particularly the scale of operation and the electricity 
price. Based on 2 MtCO2 yr-1 and an electricity price of US$ 0.05 
kWh-1, the cost is estimated to be around 10 US$/tCO2 emissions 
avoided. Electricity accounts for over half of the total cost. 
3.7.8.2 
Cement plants
As noted in Chapter 2, cement plants are the largest industrial 
source of CO2 apart from power plants. Cement plants normally 
burn lower cost high-carbon fuels such as coal, petroleum coke 
and�various�wastes.�The�flue�gas�typically�has�a�CO2 concentration 
of�14-33%�by�volume,�significantly�higher�than�at�power�plants,�
because CO2 is produced in cement kilns by decomposition of 
carbonate minerals as well as by fuel combustion. The high CO2 
concentration� would� tend� to� reduce� the� specific� cost� of� CO2 
capture�from�flue�gas.�Pre-combustion�capture,�if�used,�would�
only capture the fuel-related CO2, so would be only a partial 
solution to CO2 emissions. Oxy-fuel combustion and capture 
using calcium sorbents are other options, which are described 
in Sections 3.2.4 and 3.7.11.
3.7.8.3 
Integrated steel mills
Integrated steel mills are some of the world’s largest emitters 
of CO2, as described in Chapter 2. About 70% of the carbon 
introduced into an integrated steel mill is contained in the blast 
furnace gas in the form of CO2 and CO, each of which comprise 
about 20% by volume of the gas. The cost of capturing CO2 
from blast furnace gas was estimated to be 35 US$/tCO2 avoided 
(Farla et al., 1995) or 18 US$/tCO2 captured (Gielen, 2003). 
 
Iron ore can be reacted with synthesis gas or hydrogen 
to produce iron by direct reduction (Cheeley, 2000). Direct 
reduction processes are already used commercially but further 
development work would be needed to reduce their costs so as 
to make them more widely competitive with conventional iron 
production processes. The cost of capturing CO2 from a direct 
reduction iron (DRI) production processes was estimated to be 
10 US$/tCO2 (Gielen, 2003). CO2 also could be captured from 
other gases in iron and steel mills but costs would probably be 
higher as they are more dilute or smaller in scale.
3.7.8.4 
Biomass plants
The main large point sources of biomass-derived CO2 are 
currently wood pulp mills, which emit CO2 from black liquor 
recovery�boilers�and�bark-fired�boilers,�and�sugar/ethanol�mills,�
which emit CO2�from�bagasse-fired�boilers.�Black�liquor�is�a�
byproduct of pulping that contains lignin and chemicals used 
in the pulping process. The cost of post-combustion capture 
was estimated to be 34 US$/tCO2 avoided in a plant that 
captures about 1 MtCO2 yr-1 (Möllersten et al., 2003). Biomass 
gasification�is�under�development�as�an�alternative�to�boilers.�
 
CO2 could be captured from sucrose fermentation and from 
combustion of sugar cane bagasse at a cost of about 53 US$/
tCO2 avoided for a plant capturing 0.6 MtCO2 yr-1 avoided 
(Möllersten et al., 2003). CO2 from sugar cane fermentation has 
a high purity, so only drying and compression is required. The 
overall cost is relatively high due to an annual load factor that 
is lower than that of most power stations and large industrial

plants. 
 
CO2 could be captured at steam-generating plants or power 
plants that use other biomass byproducts and/or purpose-grown 
biomass. At present most biomass plants are relatively small. 
The cost of capturing 0.19 MtCO2 yr-1 in a 24 MW biomass-
powered IGCC plant, compared to a biomass IGCC plant 
without capture, is estimated to be about 70 US$/tCO2 (Audus 
and Freund, 2005). Larger plants using purpose-grown biomass 
may�be�built�in�the�future�and�biomass�can�be�co-fired�with�
fossil fuels to give economies of scale, as discussed in Chapter 
2. Biomass fuels produce similar or slightly greater quantities 
of CO2 per unit of fuel energy as bituminous coals; thus, the 
CO2�concentration�of�flue�gases�from�these�fuels�will�be�broadly�
similar. This implies that the cost of capturing CO2 at large 
power plants using biomass may be broadly similar to the cost 
of capturing CO2 in large fossil fuel power plants in cases where 
plant�size,�efficiency,�load�factor�and�other�key�parameters�are�
similar. The costs of avoiding CO2 emissions in power plants 
that use biomass are discussed in more detail in Chapter 8.
3.7.9 
Outlook for future CO2 capture costs 
The following sections focus on ‘advanced’ technologies that 
are not yet commercial available, but which promise to lower 
CO2 capture costs based on preliminary data and design studies. 
Earlier sections of Chapter 3 discussed some of the efforts 
underway worldwide to develop lower-cost options for CO2 
capture. Some of these developments are based on new process 
concepts, while others represent improvements to current 
commercial processes. Indeed, the history of technology 
innovation indicates that incremental technological change, 
sustained over many years (often decades), is often the most 
successful path to substantial long-term improvements in 
performance and reductions in cost of a technology (Alic et al., 
2003).�Such�trends�are�commonly�represented�and�quantified�
in the form of a ‘learning curve’ or ‘experience curve’ showing 
cost reductions as a function of the cumulative adoption of a 
particular technology (McDonald and Schrattenholzer, 2001). 
One recent study relevant to CO2 capture systems found that 
over the past 25 years, capital costs for sulphur dioxide (SO2) 
and nitrogen oxides (NOx)� capture� systems� at� US� coal-fired�
power plants have decreased by an average of 12% for each 
doubling of installed worldwide capacity (a surrogate for 
cumulative experience, including investments in R&D) (Rubin 
et al., 2004a). These capture technologies bear a number of 
similarities to current systems for CO2 capture. Another recent 
study (IEA, 2004) suggests a 20% cost reduction for a doubling 
of the unit capacity of engineered processes due to technological 
learning. For CCS systems the importance of costs related to 
energy requirements is emphasized, since reductions in such 
costs�are�required�to�significantly�reduce�the�overall�cost�of�CO2 
capture.
 
At the same time, a large body of literature on technology 
innovation also teaches us that learning rates are highly 
uncertain,11 and that cost estimates for technologies at the early 
stages of development are often unreliable and overly optimistic 
(Merrow et al., 1981). Qualitative descriptions of cost trends 
for advanced technologies and energy systems typically show 
costs increasing from the research stage through full-scale 
demonstration; only after one or more full-scale commercial 
plants are deployed do costs begin to decline for subsequent 
units (EPRI, 1993; NRC, 2003). Case studies of the SO2 and 
NOx capture systems noted above showed similar behaviour, 
with large (factor of two or more) increases in the cost of early 
full-scale FGD and SCR installations before costs subsequently 
declined (Rubin et al., 2004b). Thus, cost estimates for CO2 
capture systems should be viewed in the context of their current 
stage of development. Here we try to provide a perspective on 
potential future costs that combines qualitative judgments with 
the quantitative cost estimates offered by technology developers 
and analysts. The sections below revisit the areas of power 
generation and other industrial processes to highlight some of 
the major prospects for CO2 capture cost reductions. 
3.7.10  CO2 capture costs for electric power plants 
(advanced technology)
This�section�first�examines�oxy-fuel�combustion,�which�avoids�
the need for CO2 capture by producing a concentrated CO2 
stream for delivery to a transport and storage system. Following 
this we examine potential advances in post-combustion and 
pre-combustion capture.
3.7.10.1 Oxy-fuel combustion systems 
It�is�first�important�to�distinguish�between�two�types�of�oxy-fuel�
systems:�an�oxy-fuel�boiler�(either�a�retrofit�or�new�design)�and�
oxy-fuel combustion-based gas turbine cycles. The former are 
close to demonstration at a commercial scale, while the latter 
(such as chemical looping combustion systems and novel power 
cycles using CO2/water�as�working�fluid)�are�still�at�the�design�
stage. Table 3.13 summarizes the key assumptions and cost 
results of several recent studies of CO2 capture costs for oxy-
fuel�combustion�systems�applied�to�new�or�existing�coal-fired�
units. As discussed earlier in Section 3.4, oxygen combustion 
produces� a� flue� gas� stream� consisting� primarily� of� CO2 and 
water vapour, along with smaller amounts of SO2, nitrogen and 
other trace impurities. These designs eliminate the capital and 
operating costs of a post-combustion CO2 capture system, but 
new costs are incurred for the oxygen plant and other system 
design�modifications.�Because�oxy-fuel�combustion�is�still�under�
development and has not yet been utilized or demonstrated for 
large-scale power generation, the design basis and cost estimates 
for such systems remain highly variable and uncertain. This is 
reflected�in�the�wide�range�of�oxy-fuel�cost�estimates�in�Table�
3.13. Note, however, that cost estimates for advanced design 
11 In their study of 42 energy-related technologies, McDonald and Schrattenholzer 
(2001) found learning rates varying from -14% to 34%, with a median value of 
16%. These rates represent the average reduction in cost for each doubling of 
installed capacity. A negative learning rate indicates that costs increased rather 
than decreased over the period studied.

IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
concepts based on oxy-fuel combustion gas turbine cycles 
are more uncertain at this time than cost estimates for new or 
retrofitted�boilers�employing�oxy-fuel�combustion. 
 
For new plant applications, the data in Table 3.13 indicate 
that oxy-fuel combustion adds about 30-90% to the capital cost 
and 30-150% to the COE of a conventional plant, while reducing 
CO2� emissions� per� kWh� by� 75-100%.� Retrofit� applications�
exhibit higher relative costs in cases where the existing plant is 
wholly or partially amortized. The lowest-cost oxy-fuel system 
in Table 3.13 is one that employs chemical looping to achieve 
nearly a 100% reduction in CO2 emissions. While this concept 
thus appears promising (see Section 3.4.6), it has yet to be tested 
and�verified�at�a�meaningful�scale.�Thus�cost�estimates�based�on�
conceptual designs remain highly uncertain at this time.
 
To judge the potential cost savings of oxy-fuels relative to 
current CO2 capture systems, it is useful to compare the costs 
of alternative technologies evaluated within a particular study 
based on a particular set of premises. In this regard, the COE 
for�the�oxy-fuel�retrofit�system�reported�by�Alstom�et al. (2001) 
in Table 3.13 is 20% lower than the cost of an amine system 
retrofit�(Table�3.13)�for�the�same�255�MW�plant,�while�the�cost�
of CO2 avoided is 26% lower. In contrast, a recent study by 
the Canadian Clean Power Coalition (Stobbs and Clark, 2005) 
reports that the COE for an oxy-fuel system at a large lignite-
fired�plant�(Table�3.13)�is�36%�higher�than�for�an�amine�CO2 
capture system, while the cost of CO2 avoided is more than 
twice as great. The major source of that cost difference was a 
specification�in�the�CCPC�study�that�the�oxy-fuelled�unit�also�
be� capable� of� full� air� firing.� This� resulted� in� a� much higher 
capital cost than for a new unit designed solely for oxy-fuel 
operation. A more recent study sponsored by IEA GHG (Dillon 
et al.,� 2005)� found� that� a� large� new� supercritical� coal-fired�
boiler with oxy-fuel combustion had a COE slightly (2-3%) 
lower than a state-of-the-art coal plant with post-combustion 
analyzed in a separate study employing similar assumptions 
(IEA GHG, 2004). Further cost reductions could be achieved 
with the successful development of new lower-cost oxygen 
production technology (see Section 3.4.5). At the current time, 
the optimum designs of oxy-fuel combustion systems are not 
yet well established and costs of proposed commercial designs 
remain uncertain. This is especially true for advanced design 
concepts that employ components which are not yet available 
or still in the development stage, such as CO2 gas turbines or 
high temperature ceramic membranes for oxygen production.
3.7.10.2 Advanced systems with post-combustion capture
Improvements to current amine-based systems for post-
combustion CO2 capture are being pursued by a number of 
process developers (Mimura et al., 2003; Muramatsu and 
Iijima, 2003; Reddy et al., 2003) and may offer the nearest-
term potential for cost reductions over the systems currently 
in use. The newest systems summarized earlier in Table 3.7 
reportedly reduce the cost of CO2 avoided by approximately 
20-30% (IEA GHG, 2004). Table 3.13 indicates that additional 
advances in plant heat integration could further reduce the COE 
of capture plants by about 5%. These results are consistent with 
a recent study by Rao et al. (2003), who used expert elicitations 
and a plant simulation model to quantify the improvements 
likely achievable by 2015 for four key process parameters: 
sorbent concentration, regeneration energy requirements, 
sorbent loss and sorbent cost. The ‘most likely’ improvement 
was an 18% reduction in COE, while the ‘optimistic’ estimates 
yielded a 36% cost reduction from improvements in just these 
four parameters. The cost of CO2 avoided was reduced by 
similar� amounts.�Advances�in� more� efficient� heat� integration�
(for� sorbent� regeneration)� and� higher� power� plant� efficiency�
could lead to even greater reductions in CO2 capture cost.
�
Advances�in�gas�turbine�technology�produce�similar�benefits�
for NGCC systems. Table 3.13 shows several cases based on 
the H-turbine design. Relative to the cases in Table 3.9, these 
systems� offer� higher� efficiency� and� greater� CO2 reductions 
per kWh. The higher COEs for the advanced NGCC systems 
reflects�the�higher�natural�gas�prices�assumed�in�more�recent�
studies. 
 
Table 3.13 indicates that other advanced technologies for 
post-combustion applications, such as membrane separation 
systems, may also lower the future cost of CO2 capture (see 
Section 3.3.3). Reliable cost estimates for such technologies 
should await their further development and demonstration.
3.7.10.3 Advanced systems with pre-combustion capture
The�cost�of�gasification-based�systems�with�CO2 capture also 
can be expected to fall as a result of continued improvements 
in�gas�turbine�technology,�gasifier�designs,�oxygen�production�
systems, carbon capture technology, energy management and 
optimization of the overall facility. One recent study (IEA 
GHG, 2003) estimates a 20% reduction in the cost of electricity 
generation from a coal-based IGCC plant with CO2 capture by 
2020.� This� takes� into� account� improvements� in� gasification,�
oxygen production, physical solvent scrubbing and combined 
cycle processes, but does not take into account any possible 
radical innovations in CO2 separation technology. The additional 
IGCC cases shown in Table 3.13, including recent results of the 
CO2 Capture Project (CCP, 2005), foresee similar reductions in 
the COE of advanced IGCC systems compared to the systems 
in Table 3.10. 
3.7.11 
CO2 capture costs for hydrogen production and 
multi-product plants (advanced technology)
Table 3.14 shows results of several recent studies that have 
projected the performance and cost of new or improved ways 
of producing hydrogen and electricity from fossil fuels.
 
Compared to the current commercial plants in Table 3.11, 
the advanced single-product systems with CO2 capture have 
hydrogen cost reductions of 16% (for natural gas feedstock) to 
26% (for coal feedstock). Additional cases in Table 3.14 show 
multi-product systems producing hydrogen and electricity. 
These cases indicate the potential for substantial reductions in 
the future cost of hydrogen production with CO2 capture. As 
before, the results are sensitive to the assumed selling price of 
co-product electricity. More importantly, these cases assume

IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
the successful scale-up and commercialization of technologies 
that have not yet been demonstrated, or which are still under 
development at relatively small scales, such as solid oxide fuel 
cells (SOFC). Published cost estimates for these systems thus 
have a very high degree of uncertainty.
3.7.12 
CO2 capture costs for other industrial processes 
(advanced technology)
As noted earlier, CO2 capture for industrial processes has not 
been widely studied. The most extensive analyses have focused 
on� petroleum� refineries,� especially� CO2 capture options for 
heaters and other combustion-based processes (see Table 3.12). 
The use of oxy-fuel combustion offers potential cost savings in 
several industrial applications. The CO2 Capture Project reports 
the cost of capturing CO2�in�refinery�heaters�and�boilers,�with�
an ion transport membrane oxygen plant, to be 31 US$/tCO2 
avoided. The cost of pre-combustion capture based on shift and 
membrane gas separation was predicted to be 41 US$/tCO2 
avoided (CCP, 2005).
 
It also may be possible to apply oxy-fuel combustion to 
cement plants, but the CO2 partial pressure in the cement kiln 
would be higher than normal and the effects of this on the 
calcination reactions and the quality of the cement product 
would need to be investigated. The quantity of oxygen required 
per tonne of CO2 captured in a cement plant would be only about 
half as much as in a power plant, because only about half of the 
CO2 is produced by fuel combustion. This implies that the cost 
of CO2 capture by oxy-fuel combustion at large cement plants 
would be lower than at power plants, but a detailed engineering 
cost study is lacking. Emerging technologies that capture CO2 
using calcium-based sorbents, described in Section 3.3.3.4, may 
be cost competitive in cement plants in the future.
3.7.13 
Summary of CO2 capture cost estimates
Table 3.15 summarizes the range of current CO2 capture costs 
for the major electric power systems analyzed in this report. 
These costs apply to case studies of large new plants employing 
current commercial technologies. For the PC and IGCC systems, 
the data in Table 3.15 apply only to plants using bituminous 
coals and the PC plants are for supercritical units only. The cost 
ranges�for�each�of�the�three�systems�reflect�differences�in�the�
technical, economic and operating assumptions employed in 
different studies. While some differences in reported costs can 
be attributed to differences in the CO2 capture system design, 
the major sources of variability are differences in the assumed 
design,�operation�and�financing�of�the�reference�plant�to�which�
the capture technology is applied (i.e., factors such as plant size, 
location,�efficiency,�fuel�type,�fuel�cost,�capacity�factor�and�cost�
of capital). Because no single set of assumptions applies to all 
situations or all parts of the world, we display the ranges of cost 
represented by the studies in Tables 3.8, 3.10, 3.11 and 3.12.
 
For�the�power�plant�studies�reflected�in�Table�3.15,�current�
CO2 capture systems reduce CO2 emissions per kilowatt-hour 
by approximately 85-90% relative to a similar plant without 
capture. The cost of electricity production attributed to CO2 
capture increases by 35-70% for a natural gas combined cycle 
plant, 40-85% for a new pulverized coal plant and 20-55% for an 
integrated�gasification�combined�cycle�plant.�Overall,�the�COE�
for fossil fuel plants with capture ranges from 43-86 US$ MWh-
1, as compared to 31-61 US$ MWh-1 for similar plants without 
capture. These costs include CO2 compression but not transport 
and storage costs. In most studies to date, NGCC systems 
typically have a lower COE than new PC and IGCC plants (with 
or without capture) for large base load plants with high capacity 
factors (75% or more) and gas prices below about 4 US$ GJ-1 
over the life of the plant. However, for higher gas prices and/
or lower capacity factors, NGCC plants typically have higher 
COEs than coal-based plants, with or without capture. Recent 
studies also found that IGCC plants were on average slightly 
more costly without capture and slightly less costly with capture 
than similarly sized PC plants. However, the difference in cost 
between PC and IGCC plants with or without CO2 capture can 
vary�significantly�with�coal�type�and�other�local�factors,�such�
as the cost of capital. Since neither PC nor IGCC systems have 
yet been demonstrated with CO2 capture and storage for a large 
modern power plant (e.g., 500 MW), neither the absolute or 
relative costs of these systems (nor comparably sized NGCC 
systems with capture and storage) can be stated with a high degree 
of�confidence�at�this�time,�based�on�the�criteria�of�Table�3.6.
 
Table 3.15 also shows that the lowest CO2 capture costs with 
current technology (as low as 2 US$/tCO2 captured or avoided) 
were found for industrial processes such as coal-based hydrogen 
production plants that produce concentrated CO2 streams as 
part of the production process. Such industrial processes may 
represent some of the earliest opportunities for CCS. 
 
Figure 3.20 displays the normalized power plant cost and 
emissions data from Table 3.15 in graphical form. On this 
graph, the cost of CO2 avoided corresponds to the slope of a line 
connecting any two plants (or points) of interest. While Table 
3.15 compares a given capture plant to a similar plant without 
capture, in some cases comparisons may be sought between 
a given capture plant and a different type of reference plant. 
Several cases are illustrated in Figure 3.20 based on either a 
PC or NGCC reference plant. In each case, the COE and CO2 
emission rate are highly dependent upon technical, economic 
and�financial�factors�related�to�the�design�and�operation�of�the�
power systems of interest at a particular location. The cost of 
CO2�avoided�is�especially�sensitive�to�these�site-specific�factors�
and can vary by an order of magnitude or more when different 
types of plants are compared. Comparisons of different plant 
types,� therefore,� require� a� specific� context� and� geographical�
location to be meaningful and should be based on the full COE 
including CO2 transport and storage costs. Later, Chapter 8 
presents examples of full CCS costs for different plant types 
and storage options.
 
In contrast to new plants, CO2 capture options and costs for 
existing power plants have not been extensively studied. Current 
studies�indicate�that�these�costs�are�extremely�site-specific�and�
fall�into�two�categories�(see�Table�3.8).�One�is�the�retrofitting�of�
a post-combustion capture system to the existing unit.

IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
The other category combines CO2 capture with upgrading 
or� repowering� the� existing� plant� to� significantly� improve�
its�efficiency�and�net�power�output�(see�Sections�3.7.4.2�and�
3.7.5.2). In general, the latter option appears to be more cost-
effective.� However,� further� site-specific� studies� are� required�
to systematically assess the feasibility and cost of alternative 
repowering options in conjunction with CO2 capture for existing 
power plants.
 
New or improved methods of CO2 capture, combined with 
advanced power systems and industrial process designs, promise 
to�significantly�reduce�CO2 capture costs and associated energy 
requirements. Tables 3.12 to 3.14 summarize the results from 
recent studies that examine future options. As discussed earlier, 
there is considerable uncertainty about the magnitude and 
timing of future cost reductions, as well as the potential for costs 
to rise above current estimates, especially for technologies still 
in the early stages of research and development. The current 
assessment� is� based� on� studies� of� the� specific� technologies�
in Tables 3.12 to 3.14 (and the supporting discussions and 
literature cited in Sections 3.7.9 to 3.7.12), as well as analyses 
of historical cost trends for related energy and environmental 
technologies. This assessment suggests that improvements to 
current commercial technologies can reduce CO2 capture costs 
by at least 20-30% over approximately the next decade, while 
new technologies under development promise more substantial 
cost reductions. Achieving future cost reductions, however, will 
require deployment and adoption of commercial technologies 
in the marketplace as well as sustained R&D.
3.8  
Gaps in knowledge
Gaps in knowledge are related to differences in the stages of 
development of component technologies for the capture systems 
reviewed in Sections 3.2 to 3.5. For CO2 capture from industrial 
processes, a number of technologies that are commonly used 
in natural gas sweetening and ammonia production are already 
used on a commercial scale. For other types of industrial systems 
capturing CO2 from steel and cement production, further work 
is still needed. For CO2 capture that might be reliant on post-
combustion capture or oxy-fuel combustion, options are less 
well developed, or are available at a smaller scale than those 
required for applications such as in power generation, where 
Figure 3.20 Cost of electricity (excluding transport and storage costs) compared to CO2 emission rate for different reference and capture plants 
based on current technology. The shaded areas show the Table 3.15 ranges of CO2 emission rates and levelized cost of electricity (COE) for new 
PC, IGCC and NGCC plants with and without CO2 capture. All coal plant data are for bituminous coals only. PC plants are supercritical units only 
(see Tables 3.7, 3.9, 3.10 and 3.15 for additional assumptions). The cost of CO2 avoided corresponds to the slope of a line connecting a plant with 
capture and a reference plant without capture (i.e., the change in electricity cost divided by the change in emission rate). Avoidance costs for the 
same type of plant with and without capture plant are given in Table 3.15. When comparing different plant types, the reference plant represents 
the least-cost plant that would ‘normally’ be built at a particular location in the absence of a carbon constraint. In many regions today, this would 
be either a PC plant or an NGCC plant. The cost per tonne of CO2 avoided can be highly variable and depends strongly on the costs and emissions 
of new plants being considered in a particular situation. See Chapter 8 for the full COE and full cost of CO2 avoided for different plant types.
Chapter 3: Capture of CO2

much�larger�gas�flows�are�handled.�For�pre-combustion�capture�
many of the required systems have been developed and applied 
in industry already.
 
Although many of the component and/or enabling 
technologies required for CO2 capture in post-combustion, 
pre-combustion and oxy-fuel combustion are well known, 
gaps in knowledge are in the practical and/or commercial 
demonstration of integrated systems. This demonstration is 
essential to prove the cost of CO2 capture and its use on a large 
scale, particularly in power generation applications, but also for 
cement, steel and other large industries. Operating experience 
is also needed to test system reliability, improved methods of 
system integration, methods to reduce the energy requirements 
for CO2 capture, improved process control strategies and the 
use of optimized functional materials for the implementation 
of� capture�processes� with� advanced,� higher� efficiency� power�
cycles. As such developments are realized, environmental 
issues associated with the capture of CO2 and other deleterious 
pollutants in these systems should also be re-assessed from 
a perspective involving the whole capture-transport-storage 
operation. 
 
In an ongoing search to implement existing, new or improved 
methods of CO2 capture, most capture systems also rely on the 
application�of�a�range�of�enabling�technologies�that�influence�the�
attractiveness of a given system. These enabling technologies 
have their own critical gaps of knowledge. For example, 
improved processes for the effective removal of sulphur, 
nitrogen, chlorine, mercury and other pollutants are needed for 
the effective performance of unit operations for CO2 separation 
in post- and pre-combustion capture systems, especially when 
coal�is�used�as�the�primary�fuel.�Improved�gasification�reactors�
for coals and biomass, the availability of hydrogen-burning gas 
turbines and fuel cells for stationary power generation also need 
further development in the pre-combustion route. Combustors 
and boilers operating at higher temperatures, or a new class of 
CO2 turbines and compressors, are important requirements for 
oxy-fuel systems.
 
With reference to the development of novel CO2 capture 
and/or other enabling technologies, a wide range of options 
are currently being investigated worldwide. However, many 
technical� details� of� the� specific� processes� proposed� or� under�
development for these emerging technologies are still not well 
understood. This makes the assessment of their performance 
and cost highly uncertain. This is where intense R&D is needed 
to develop and bring to pilot scale testing the most promising 
concepts for commercial application. Membranes for H2, CO2 
or O2 separation, new sorbents, O2 or CO2 solid carriers and 
materials for advanced combustors, boilers and turbines all 
require extensive performance testing. Multi-pollutant emission 
controls in these novel systems and the impact of fuel impurities 
and temperature on the functional materials, should also be an 
area of future work.

Chapter 4: Transport of CO2

ExECuTivE SummARy
Transport is that stage of carbon capture and storage that links 
sources and storage sites. The beginning and end of ‘transport’ 
may be defined administratively. ‘Transport’ is covered by 
the regulatory framework concerned for public safety that 
governs pipelines and shipping. In the context of long-distance 
movement of large quantities of carbon dioxide, pipeline 
transport is part of current practice. Pipelines routinely carry 
large volumes of natural gas, oil, condensate and water over 
distances of thousands of kilometres, both on land and in the 
sea. Pipelines are laid in deserts, mountain ranges, heavily-
populated areas, farmland and the open range, in the Arctic and 
sub-Arctic, and in seas and oceans up to 2200 m deep. 
 
Carbon dioxide pipelines are not new: they now extend 
over more than 2500 km in the western USA, where they carry 
50 MtCO2 yr-1 from natural sources to enhanced oil recovery 
projects in the west Texas and elsewhere. The carbon dioxide 
stream ought preferably to be dry and free of hydrogen sulphide, 
because corrosion is then minimal, and it would be desirable to 
establish a minimum specification for ‘pipeline quality’ carbon 
dioxide. However, it would be possible to design a corrosion-
resistant pipeline that would operate safely with a gas that 
contained water, hydrogen sulphide and other contaminants. 
Pipeline transport of carbon dioxide through populated areas 
requires attention be paid to design factors, to overpressure 
protection, and to leak detection. There is no indication that the 
problems for carbon dioxide pipelines are any more challenging 
than those set by hydrocarbon pipelines in similar areas, or that 
they cannot be resolved.
 
Liquefied natural gas and petroleum gases such as propane 
and butane are routinely transported by marine tankers; this 
trade already takes place on a very large scale. Carbon dioxide 
is transported in the same way, but on a small scale because of 
limited demand. The properties of liquefied carbon dioxide are 
not greatly different from those of liquefied petroleum gases, 
and the technology can be scaled up to large carbon dioxide 
carriers. A design study discussed later has estimated costs 
for marine transport of 1 MtCO2 yr-1 by one 22,000 m3 marine 
tanker over a distance of 1100 km, along with the associated 
liquefaction, loading and unloading systems.
 
Liquefied gas can also be carried by rail and road tankers, 
but it is unlikely that they be considered attractive options for 
large-scale carbon dioxide capture and storage projects.
4.1  
introduction
CO2 is transported in three states: gas, liquid and solid. 
Commercial-scale transport uses tanks, pipelines and ships for 
gaseous and liquid carbon dioxide. 
 
Gas transported at close to atmospheric pressure occupies 
such a large volume that very large facilities are needed. Gas 
occupies less volume if it is compressed, and compressed 
gas is transported by pipeline. Volume can be further reduced 
by liquefaction, solidification or hydration. Liquefaction is 
an established technology for gas transport by ship as LPG 
(liquefied petroleum gas) and LNG (liquefied natural gas).
This existing technology and experience can be transferred to 
liquid CO2 transport. Solidification needs much more energy 
compared with other options, and is inferior from a cost and 
energy viewpoint. Each of the commercially viable technologies 
is currently used to transport carbon dioxide. 
 
Research and development on a natural gas hydrate carrying 
system intended to replace LNG systems is in progress, and the 
results might be applied to CO2 ship transport in the future. In 
pipeline transportation, the volume is reduced by transporting 
at a high pressure: this is routinely done in gas pipelines, where 
operating pressures are between 10 and 80 MPa.
 
A transportation infrastructure that carries carbon dioxide 
in large enough quantities to make a significant contribution 
to climate change mitigation will require a large network of 
pipelines. As growth continues it may become more difficult 
to secure rights-of-way for the pipelines, particularly in highly 
populated zones that produce large amounts of carbon dioxide. 
Existing experience has been in zones with low population 
densities, and safety issues will become more complex in 
populated areas.
 
The most economical carbon dioxide capture systems 
appear to favour CO2 capture, first, from pure stream sources 
such as hydrogen reformers and chemical plants, and then from 
centralized power and synfuel plants: Chapter 2 discusses this 
issue in detail. The producers of natural gas speak of ‘stranded’ 
reserves from which transport to market is uneconomical. A 
movement towards a decentralized power supply grid may make 
CO2 capture and transport much more costly, and it is easy to 
envision stranded CO2 at sites where capture is uneconomic. 
 
A regulatory framework will need to emerge for the low-
greenhouse-gas-emissions power industry of the future to guide 
investment decisions. Future power plant owners may find the 
carbon dioxide transport component one of the leading issues in 
their decision-making. 
4.2  
Pipeline systems
4.2.1 
Pipeline transportation systems
CO2 pipeline operators have established minimum specifications 
for composition. Box 4.1 gives an example from the Canyon 
Reef project (Section 4.2.2.1). This specification is for gas for 
an enhanced oil recovery (EOR) project, and parts of it would 
not necessarily apply to a CO2 storage project. A low nitrogen 
content is important for EOR, but would not be so significant 
for CCS. A CO2 pipeline through populated areas might have a 
lower specified maximum H2S content.
 
Dry carbon dioxide does not corrode the carbon-manganese 
steels generally used for pipelines, as long as the relative humidity 
is less than 60% (see, for example, Rogers and Mayhew, 1980); 
this conclusion continues to apply in the presence of N2, NOx 
and SOx contaminants. Seiersten (2001) wrote:
 
“The corrosion rate of carbon steel in dry supercritical CO2 
is low. For AISI 1080 values around 0.01 mm yr-1 have been 
measured at 90–120 bar and 160°C–180°C for 200 days. Short-
182
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
term tests confirm this. In a test conducted at 3ºC and 22°C at 
140 bar CO2, and 800 to 1000 ppm H2S, the corrosion rate for 
X-60 carbon steel was measured at less than 0.5 µm yr-1 (0.0005 
mm yr-1). Field experience also indicates very few problems 
with transportation of high-pressure dry CO2 in carbon steel 
pipelines. During 12 years, the corrosion rate in an operating 
pipeline amounts to 0.25-2.5 µm yr-1 (0.00025 to (0.0025 mm 
yr-1)”.
 
The water solubility limit in high-pressure CO2 (500 bar) is 
5000 ppm at 75°C and 2000 ppm at 30°C. Methane lowers the 
solubility limit, and H2S, O2 and N2 may have the same effect.
 
Corrosion rates are much higher if free water is present; 
hydrates might also form. Seiersten (2001) measured a corrosion 
rate of 0.7 mm yr-1 corrosion rate in 150 to 300 hours exposure 
at 40°C in water equilibrated with CO2 at 95 bar, and higher 
rates at lower pressures. She found little difference between 
carbon-manganese steel (American Petroleum Institute grade 
X65) and 0.5 chromium corrosion-resistant alloy. It is unlikely 
to be practicable to transport wet CO2 in low-alloy carbon 
steel pipelines because of this high corrosion rate. If the CO2 
cannot be dried, it may be necessary to build the pipeline of a 
corrosion-resistant alloy (‘stainless steel’). This is an established 
technology. However the cost of steel has greatly increased 
recently and this may not be economical. 
 
Once the CO2 has been dried and meets the transportation 
criteria, the CO2 is measured and transported to the final use 
site. All the pipelines have state-of-the-art metering systems that 
accurately account for sales and deliveries on to and out of each 
line, and SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) 
systems for measuring pressure drops, and redundancies 
built in to allow for emergencies. In the USA, these pipelines 
are governed by Department of Transportation regulations. 
Movement of CO2 is best accomplished under high pressure: 
the choice of operating pressure is discussed in an example 
below, and the reader is referred to Annex I for a discussion of 
the physical properties of CO2.
4.2.2 
Existing experience
Table 4.1 lists existing long-distance CO2 pipelines. Most of the 
projects listed below are described in greater detail in a report by 
the UK Department of Trade and Industry (2002). While there 
are CO2 pipelines outside the USA, the Permian Basin contains 
over 90% of the active CO2 floods in the world (O&GJ, April 
15, 2002, EOR Survey). Since then, well over 1600 km of new 
CO2 pipelines has been built to service enhanced oil recovery 
(EOR) in west Texas and nearby states.
4.2.2.1 
Canyon Reef 
The first large CO2 pipeline in the USA was the Canyon Reef 
Carriers, built in 1970 by the SACROC Unit in Scurry County, 
Texas. Its 352 km moved 12,000 tonnes of anthropogenically 
produced CO2 daily (4.4 Mt yr-1) from Shell Oil Company gas 
processing plants in the Texas Val Verde basin.
4.2.2.2 
Bravo Dome Pipeline
Oxy Permian constructed this 508 mm (20-inch) line connecting 
the Bravo Dome CO2 field with other major pipelines. It is 
capable of carrying 7.3 MtCO2 yr-1 and is operated by Kinder 
Morgan.
4.2.2.3 Cortez Pipeline
Built in 1982 to supply CO2 from the McElmo Dome in S.E. 
Colorado, the 762 mm (30-inch), 803 km pipeline carries 
approximately 20 Mt CO2 yr-1 to the CO2 hub at Denver City, 
Texas. The line starts near Cortez, Colorado, and crosses the 
Rocky Mountains, where it interconnects with other CO2 lines. 
In the present context, recall that one 1000 MW coal-fired

power station produces about 7 Mt CO2 yr-1, and so one Cortez 
pipeline could handle the emissions of three of those stations.
 
The Cortez Pipeline passes through two built-up areas, 
Placitas, New Mexico (30 km north of Albuquerque, New 
Mexico) and Edgewood/Moriarty, New Mexico (40 km east 
of Albuquerque). The line is buried at least 1 m deep and is 
marked within its right of way. Near houses and built-up areas 
it is marked more frequently to ensure the residents are aware 
of the pipeline locations. The entire pipeline is patrolled by air 
every two weeks, and in built-up areas is frequently patrolled 
by employees in company vehicles. The public education 
programme includes the mailing of a brochure describing CO2, 
signs of a leak and where to report a suspected leak, together 
with information about the operator and the “one-call” centre.

 Weyburn Pipeline
This 330 km, (305-356 mm diameter) system carries more than 
5000 tonne day-1 (1.8 Mt yr-1) of CO2 from the Great Plains 
Synfuels Plant near Beulah, North Dakota to the Weyburn EOR 
project in Saskatchewan. The composition of the gas carried by 
the pipeline is typically CO2 96%, H2S 0.9%, CH4 0.7%, C2+ 
hydrocarbons 2.3%, CO 0.1%, N2 less than 300 ppm, O2 less 
than 50 ppm and H2O less than 20 ppm (UK Department of 
Trade and Industry, 2002). The delivery pressure at Weyburn is 
15.2 MPa. There are no intermediate compressor stations. The 
amount allocated to build the pipeline was 110 US $ million 
(0.33 x 106 US$ km-1) in 1997.
4.2.3 
Design
The physical, environmental and social factors that determine 
the design of a pipeline are summarized in a design basis, which 
then forms the input for the conceptual design. This includes a 
system definition for the preliminary route and design aspects 
for cost-estimating and concept-definition purposes. It is also 
necessary to consider the process data defining the physical 
characteristics of product mixture transported, the optimal 
sizing and pressures for the pipeline, and the mechanical 
design, such as operating, valves, pumps, compressors, seals, 
etc. The topography of the pipeline right-of-way must be 
examined. Topography may include mountains, deserts, river 
and stream crossings, and for offshore pipelines, the differing 
challenges of very deep or shallow water, and uneven seabed. 
It is also important to include geotechnical considerations. 
For example, is this pipeline to be constructed on thin soil 
overlaying granite? The local environmental data need to be 
included, as well as the annual variation in temperature during 
operation and during construction, potentially unstable slopes, 
frost heave and seismic activity. Also included are water depth, 
sea currents, permafrost, ice gouging in Arctic seas, biological 
growth, aquifers, and other environmental considerations such 
as protected habitats. The next set of challenges is how the 
pipeline will accommodate existing and future infrastructure – 
road, rail, pipeline crossings, military/governmental restrictions 
and the possible impact of other activities – as well as shipping 
lanes, rural or urban settings, fishing restrictions, and conflicting 
uses such as dredging. Finally, this integrated study will serve 
as the basis for a safety review.
Conceptual design
The conceptual design includes the following components:
• 
Mechanical design: follows standard procedures, described 
in detail in (Palmer et al., 2004). 
• 
Stability design: standard methods and software are used to 
perform stability calculations, offshore (Veritec, 1988) or 
onshore, though the offshore methods have been questioned. 
New guidelines for stability will be published in 2005 by 
Det Norske Veritas and will be designated DNV-RP-F109 
On-Bottom Stability
• 
Protection against corrosion: a well-understood subject of 
which the application to CO2 pipelines is described below.
• 
Trenching and backfilling: onshore lines are usually buried 
to depth of 1 m. Offshore lines are almost always buried 
in shallow water. In deeper water pipelines narrower than 
400 mm are trenched and sometimes buried to protect them 
against damage by fishing gear. 
• 
CO2 pipelines may be more subject to longitudinal running 
fracture than hydrocarbon gas pipelines. Fracture arresters 
are installed at intervals of about 500 m. 
West (1974) describes the design of the SACROC CO2  pipeline 
(Section 4.2.2.1 above). The transportation options examined 
were:
(i)  a low-pressure CO2 gas pipeline operating at a maximum 
pressure of 4.8 MPa;
(ii)  a high-pressure CO2 gas pipeline operating at a minimum 
pressure of 9.6 MPa, so that the gas would remain in a 
dense phase state at all temperatures;
(iii) a refrigerated liquid CO2 pipeline;
(iv) road tank trucks;
(v)  rail tankers, possibly in combination with road tank 
trucks.
 
The tank truck and rail options cost more than twice as 
much as a pipeline. The refrigerated pipeline was rejected 
because of cost and technical difficulties with liquefaction. The 
dense phase (Option ii) was 20% cheaper than a low-pressure 
CO2 gas pipeline (Option i). The intermediate 4.8 to 9.6 MPa 
pressure range was avoided so that two-phase flow would not 
occur. An added advantage of dense-phase transport was that 
high delivery pressures were required for CO2 injection.
 
The final design conforms to the ANSI B31.8 code for gas 
pipelines and to the DOT regulations applicable at the time. The 
main 290 km section is 406.4 mm (16 inch) outside diameter 
and 9.53 mm wall thickness made from grade X65 pipe 
(specified minimum yield stress of 448 MPa). A shorter 60 km 
section is 323.85 mm (12.75 inch) outside diameter, 8.74 mm 
wall thickness, grade X65. Tests showed that dry CO2 would 
not corrode the pipeline steel; 304L corrosion-resistant alloy 
was used for short sections upstream of the glycol dehydrator. 
The line is buried to a minimum of 0.9 m, and any point on the 
line is within 16 km of a block valve. 
 
There are six compressor stations, totalling 60 MW, including 
a station at the SACROC delivery point. The compressor 
stations are not equally spaced, and the longest distance between 
two stations is about 160 km. This is consistent with general 
practice, but some long pipelines have 400 km or more between 
compressor stations.
 
Significant nitrogen and oxygen components in CO2 would 
shift the boundary of the two-phase region towards higher 
pressures, and would require a higher operating pressure to 
avoid two-phase flow.
4.2.4 
Construction of land pipelines
Construction planning can begin either before or after rights 
Chapter 4: Transport of CO2
185
of way are secured, but a decision to construct will not come 
before a legal right to construct a pipeline is secured and all 
governmental regulations met. Onshore and underwater CO2 
pipelines are constructed in the same way as hydrocarbon 
pipelines, and for both there is an established and well-
understood base of engineering experience. Subsection 4.2.5 
describes underwater construction.
 
The construction phases of a land pipeline are outlined 
below. Some of the operations can take place concurrently. 
 
Environmental and social factors may influence the season 
of the year in which construction takes place. The land is 
cleared and the trench excavated. The longest lead items come 
first: urban areas, river and road crossings. Pipe is received 
into the pipe yard and welded into double joints (24 m long); 
transported to staging areas for placement along the pipe route, 
welded, tested, coated and wrapped, and then lowered into the 
trench. A hydrostatic test is carried out, and the line is dried. 
The trench is then backfilled, and the land and the vegetation 
restored. 
4.2.5 
Underwater pipelines 
Most underwater pipelines are constructed by the lay-barge 
method, in which 12 or 24 m lengths of pipe are brought to a 
dynamically positioned or anchored barge, and welded one by 
one to the end of the pipeline. The barge moves slowly forward, 
and the pipeline leaves the barge over the stern, and passes first 
over a support structure (‘stinger’) and then down through the 
water in a suspended span, until it reaches the seabed. Some 
lines up to 450 mm diameter are constructed by the reel method, 
in which the pipeline is welded together onshore, wound onto 
a reel on a ship, and then unwound from the reel into its final 
position. Some short lines and lines for shore crossings in 
shallow water are constructed by various tow and pull methods, 
in which the line is welded together onshore and then pulled 
into its final location.
 
If the design requires that the pipeline be trenched, that is 
usually done after it has been laid on the seabed, by a jetting 
sled, a plough or a mechanical cutting device that is pulled 
along the line. On the other hand, in shore crossings and in very 
shallow water the trench is often excavated before the pipeline 
is laid, and that is done by dredgers, backhoes or draglines in 
soft sediments, or in rock by blasting followed by clamshell 
excavators. Many shore crossings are drilled horizontally 
from the shore; this procedure eliminates many uncertainties 
associated with the surf zone, and reduces the environmental 
impact of construction.
 
Underwater connections are made by various kinds of 
mechanical connection systems, by hyperbaric welding (in 
air under the local hydrostatic pressure) or by lifting the pipe 
ends above the surface, welding them together and lowering the 
connected line to the bottom.
 
These technologies are established and understood (Palmer 
and King, 2004). Underwater pipelines up to 1422 mm in 
diameter have been constructed in many different environments, 
and pipelines have been laid in depths up to 2200 m. Figure 4.2 
plots the diameters and maximum depths of major deepwater 
pipelines constructed up to 2004. The difficulty of construction 
is roughly proportional to the depth multiplied by the diameter, 
and the maximum value of that product has multiplied fourfold 
since 1980. Still larger and deeper pipelines are technically 
feasible with today’s technology.
4.2.6 
Operations
Operational aspects of pipelines are divided into three areas: daily 
operations, maintenance, and health, safety and environment. 
Operations of a CO2 pipeline in the USA, for instance, must 
follow federal operations guidelines (49 CFR 195). Overall 
operational considerations include training, inspections, safety 
integration, signs and pipeline markers, public education, 
damage prevention programmes, communication, facility 
security and leak detection. Pipelines outside the USA generally 
have similar regulatory operational requirements.
 
Personnel form a central part of operations and must be 
qualified. Personnel are required to be continuously trained and 
updated on safety procedures, including safety procedures that 
apply to contractors working on or near the pipeline, as well as 
to the public.
 
Operations include daily maintenance, scheduled planning 
and policies for inspecting, maintaining and repairing all 
equipment on the line and the pipeline itself, as well as supporting 
the line and pipeline. This equipment and support includes 
valves, compressors, pumps, tanks, rights of way, public signs 
and line markers as well as periodic pipeline flyovers.
 
Long-distance pipelines are instrumented at intervals so that 
the flow can be monitored. The monitoring points, compressor 
stations and block valves are tied back to a central operations 
centre. Computers control much of the operation, and manual 
intervention is necessary only in unusual upsets or emergency 
conditions. The system has inbuilt redundancies to prevent loss 
of operational capability if a component fails.
Figure 4.2 Pipelines in deep water.
186
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
  
Pipelines are cleaned and inspected by ‘pigs’, piston-like 
devices driven along the line by the gas pressure. Pigs have 
reached a high level of sophistication, and can measure internal 
corrosion, mechanical deformation, external corrosion, the 
precise position of the line, and the development of spans in 
underwater lines. Further functionality will develop as pig 
technology evolves, and there is no reason why pigs used for 
hydrocarbon pipelines should not be used for carbon dioxide.
 
Pipelines are also monitored externally. Land pipelines 
are inspected from the air, at intervals agreed between the 
operator and the regulatory authorities. Inspection from the 
air detects unauthorized excavation or construction before 
damage occurs. Currently, underwater pipelines are monitored 
by remotely operated vehicles, small unmanned submersibles 
that move along the line and make video records, and in the 
future, by autonomous underwater vehicles that do not need to 
be connected to a mother ship by a cable. Some pipelines have 
independent leak detection systems that find leaks acoustically 
or by measuring chemical releases, or by picking up pressure 
changes or small changes in mass balance. This technology is 
available and routine.
4.3  
Ships for CO2 transportation
4.3.1 
Marine transportation system
Carbon dioxide is continuously captured at the plant on land, 
but the cycle of ship transport is discrete, and so a marine 
transportation system includes temporary storage on land 
and a loading facility. The capacity, service speed, number 
of ships and shipping schedule will be planned, taking into 
consideration, the capture rate of CO2, transport distance, and 
social and technical restrictions. This issue is, of course, not 
specific to the case of CO2 transport; CO2 transportation by ship 
has a number of similarities to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) 
transportation by ship.
 
What happens at the delivery point depends on the CO2 
storage system. If the delivery point is onshore, the CO2 is 
unloaded from the ships into temporary storage tanks. If the 
delivery point is offshore – as in the ocean storage option – ships 
might unload to a platform, to a floating storage facility (similar 
to a floating production and storage facility routinely applied 
to offshore petroleum production), to a single-buoy mooring or 
directly to a storage system.
4.3.2 
Existing experience
The use of ships for transporting CO2 across the sea is today in 
an embryonic stage. Worldwide there are only four small ships 
used for this purpose. These ships transport liquefied food-
grade CO2 from large point sources of concentrated carbon 
dioxide such as ammonia plants in northern Europe to coastal 
distribution terminals in the consuming regions. From these 
distribution terminals CO2 is transported to the customers either 
by tanker trucks or in pressurized cylinders. Design work is 
ongoing in Norway and Japan for larger CO2 ships and their 
associated liquefaction and intermediate storage facilities.
4.3.3 
Design
For the design of hull and tank structure of liquid gas transport 
ships, such as LPG carriers and LNG carriers, the International 
Maritime Organization adopted the International Gas Carrier 
Code in order to prevent the significant secondary damage 
from accidental damage to ships. CO2 tankers are designed and 
constructed under this code.
 
There are three types of tank structure for liquid gas transport 
ships: pressure type, low temperature type and semi-refrigerated 
type. The pressure type is designed to prevent the cargo gas from 
boiling under ambient air conditions. On the other hand, the 
low temperature type is designed to operate at a sufficiently low 
temperature to keep cargo gas as a liquid under the atmospheric 
pressure. Most small gas carriers are pressure type, and large 
LPG and LNG carriers are of the low temperature type. The 
low temperature type is suitable for mass transport because 
the tank size restriction is not severe. The semi-refrigerated 
type, including the existing CO2 carriers, is designed taking 
into consideration the combined conditions of temperature and 
pressure necessary for cargo gas to be kept as a liquid. Some 
tankers such as semi-refrigerated LPG carriers are designed for 
applicability to the range of cargo conditions between normal 
temperature/high pressure and low temperature/atmospheric 
pressure. 
 
Annex I to this report includes the CO2 phase diagram. At 
atmospheric pressure, CO2 is in gas or solid phase, depending 
on the temperature. Lowering the temperature at atmospheric 
pressure cannot by itself cause CO2 to liquefy, but only to make 
so-called ‘dry ice’ or solid CO2. Liquid CO2 can only exist at 
a combination of low temperature and pressures well above 
atmospheric pressure. Hence, a CO2 cargo tank should be of the 
pressure-type or semi-refrigerated. The semi-refrigerated type 
is preferred by ship designers, and the design point of the cargo 
tank would be around –54 ºC per 6 bar to –50ºC per 7 bar, which 
is near the point of CO2. In a standard design, semi-refrigerated 
type LPG carriers operate at a design point of –50°C and 7 bar, 
when transporting a volume of 22,000 m3. 
 
Carbon dioxide could leak into the atmosphere during 
transportation. The total loss to the atmosphere from ships is 
between 3 and 4% per 1000 km, counting both boil-off and 
exhaust from the ship’s engines; both components could be 
reduced by capture and liquefaction, and recapture onshore 
would reduce the loss to 1 to 2% per 1000 km.
4.3.4 
Construction
Carbon dioxide tankers are constructed using the same 
technology as existing liquefied gas carriers. The latest LNG 
carriers reach more than 200,000 m3 capacity. (Such a vessel 
could carry 230 kt of liquid CO2.) The same type of yards that 
today build LPG and LNG ships can carry out the construction 
of a CO2 tanker. The actual building time will be from one to 
two years, depending on considerations such as the ship’s size.
Chapter 4: Transport of CO2

4.3.5 
Operation
4.3.5.1 
Loading
Liquid CO2 is charged from the temporary storage tank to 
the cargo tank with pumps adapted for high pressure and low 
temperature CO2 service. The cargo tanks are first filled and 
pressurized with gaseous CO2 to prevent contamination by 
humid air and the formation of dry ice.
4.3.5.2 
 Transport to the site
Heat transfer from the environment through the wall of the 
cargo tank will boil CO2 and raise the pressure in the tank. It 
is not dangerous to discharge the CO2 boil-off gas together 
with the exhaust gas from the ship’s engines, but doing so 
does, of course, release CO2 to the air. The objective of zero 
CO2 emissions during the process of capture and storage can 
be achieved by using a refrigeration unit to capture and liquefy 
boil-off and exhaust CO2.
4.3.5.3 
 Unloading
Liquid CO2 is unloaded at the destination site. The volume 
occupied by liquid CO2 in the cargo tanks is replaced with dry 
gaseous CO2, so that humid air does not contaminate the tanks. 
This CO2 could be recycled and reliquefied when the tank is 
refilled.
4.3.5.4 
 Return to port in ballast, and dry-docking
The CO2 tanker will return to the port for the next voyage. When 
the CO2 tanker is in dock for repair or regular inspection, gas 
CO2 in cargo tank should be purged with air for safe working. 
For the first loading after docking, cargo tanks should be fully 
dried, purged and filled with CO2 gas.
 
Ships of similar construction with a combination of cooling 
and pressure are currently operated for carrying other industrial 
gases. 
4.4  
Risk, safety and monitoring
4.4.1 
Introduction
There are calculable and perceivable risks for any transportation 
option. We are not considering perceivable risks because this 
is beyond the scope of the document. Risks in special cases 
such as military conflicts and terrorist actions have now been 
investigated. At least two conferences on pipeline safety and 
security have taken place, and additional conferences and 
workshops are planned. However, it is unlikely that these will 
lead to peer-reviewed journal articles because of the sensitivity 
of the issue. 
 
Pipelines and marine transportation systems have an 
established and good safety record. Comparison of CO2 
systems with these existing systems for long-distance pipeline 
transportation of gas and oil or with marine transportation of 
oil, yidds that risks should be comparable in terms of failure and 
accident rates.For the existing transport system these incidents 
seem to be perceived by the broad community as acceptable in 
spite of occasional serious pollution incidents such as the Exxon 
Valdes and Torrey Canyon disasters (van Bernem and Lubbe, 
1997). Because the consequences of CO2 pipeline accidents 
potentially are of significant concern, stricter regulations for 
CO2 pipelines than those for natural gas pipelines currently are 
in force in the USA. 
4.4.2 
Land pipelines
Land pipelines are built to defined standards and are subject 
to regulatory approval. This sometimes includes independent 
design reviews. Their routes are frequently the subject of public 
inquiries. The process of securing regulatory approval generally 
includes approval of a safety plan, of detailed monitoring and 
inspection procedures and of emergency response plans. In 
densely populated areas the process of planning, licensing and 
building new pipelines may be difficult and time-consuming. In 
some places it may be possible to convert existing hydrocarbon 
pipelines into CO2 pipelines.
 
Pipelines in operation are monitored internally by pigs 
(internal pipeline inspection devices) and externally by 
corrosion monitoring and leak detection systems. Monitoring is 
also done by patrols on foot and by aircraft.
 
The incidence of failure is relatively small. Guijt (2004) 
and the European Gas Pipeline Incident Data Group (2002) 
show that the incidence of failure has markedly decreased. 
Guijt quotes an incident rate of almost 0.0010 km-1 year-1 in 
1972 falling to below 0.0002 km-1 year-1 in 2002. Most of the 
incidents refer to very small pipelines, less than 100 mm in 
diameter, principally applied to gas distribution systems. The 
failure incidence for 500 mm and larger pipelines is very much 
lower, below 0.00005 km-1 year-1. These figures include all 
unintentional releases outside the limits of facilities (such as 
compressor stations) originating from pipelines whose design 
pressures are greater than 1.5 MPa. They cover many kinds 
of incidents, not all of them serious, and there is substantial 
variation between pipelines, reflecting factors such as system 
age and inspection frequency. 
 
The corresponding incident figures for western European 
oil pipelines have been published by CONCAWE (2002). 
In 1997-2001 the incident frequency was 0.0003 km-1 yr-1. 
The corresponding figure for US onshore gas pipelines was 
0.00011 km-1 yr-1 for the 1986-2002 period, defining an incident 
as an event that released gas and caused death, inpatient 
hospitalization or property loss of US$ 50,000: this difference 
in reporting threshold is thought to account for the difference 
between European and US statistics (Guijt, 2004). 
 
Lelieveld et al. (2005) examined leakage in 2400 km of 
the Russian natural gas pipeline system, including compressor 
stations, valves and machine halls, and concluded that ‘...overall, 
the leakage from Russian natural gas transport systems is about 
1.4% (with a range of 1.0-2.5%), which is comparable with the 
amount lost from pipelines in the United States (1.5±0.5%)’. 
Those numbers refer to total leakage, not to leakage per 
kilometre.
 
Gale and Davison (2002) quote incident statistics for CO2 
188
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
pipelines in the USA. In the 1990-2002 period there were 10 
incidents, with property damage totalling US$ 469,000, and no 
injuries nor fatalities. The incident rate was 0.00032 km-1 yr-1. 
However, unlike oil and gas, CO2 does not form flammable or 
explosive mixtures with air. Existing CO2 pipelines are mainly 
in areas of low population density, which would also tend to 
result in lower average impacts. The reasons for the incidents 
at CO2 pipelines were relief valve failure (4 failures), weld/
gasket/valve packing failure (3), corrosion (2) and outside 
force (1). In contrast, the principal cause of incidents for natural 
gas pipelines is outside force, such as damage by excavator 
buckets. Penetration by excavators can lead to loss of pipeline 
fluid and sometimes to fractures that propagate great distances. 
Preventative measures such as increasing the depth of cover 
and use of concrete barriers above a pipeline and warning tape 
can greatly reduce the risk. For example, increasing cover from 
1 m to 2 m reduces the damage frequency by a factor of 10 in 
rural areas and by 3.5 in suburban areas (Guijt, 2004). 
 
Carbon dioxide leaking from a pipeline forms a potential 
physiological hazard for humans and animals. The consequences 
of CO2 incidents can be modelled and assessed on a site-specific 
basis using standard industrial methods, taking into account 
local topography, meteorological conditions, population density 
and other local conditions. A study by Vendrig et al. (2003) 
has modelled the risks of CO2 pipelines and booster stations. 
A property of CO2 that needs to be considered when selecting 
a pipeline route is the fact that CO2 is denser than air and can 
therefore accumulate to potentially dangerous concentrations in 
low lying areas. Any leak transfers CO2 to the atmosphere.
 
If substantial quantities of impurities, particularly H2S, are 
included in the CO2, this could affect the potential impacts of a 
pipeline leak or rupture. The exposure threshold at which H2S 
is immediately dangerous to life or health, according to the 
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, is 100 
ppm, compared to 40,000 ppm for CO2. 
 
If CO2 is transported for significant distances in densely 
populated regions, the number of people potentially exposed to 
risks from CO2 transportation facilities may be greater than the 
number exposed to potential risks from CO2 capture and storage 
facilities. Public concerns about CO2 transportation may form 
a significant barrier to large-scale use of CCS. At present most 
electricity generation or other fuel conversion plants are built 
close to energy consumers or sources of fuel supply. New plants 
with CO2 capture could be built close to CO2 storage sites, to 
minimize CO2 transportation. However, this may necessitate 
greater transportation of fuels or electricity, which have their 
own environmental impacts, potential risks and public concerns. 
A gathering system would be needed if CO2 were brought from 
distributed sources to a trunk pipeline, and for some storage 
options a distribution system would also be needed: these 
systems would need to be planned and executed with the same 
regard for risk outlined here. 
4.4.3 
Marine pipelines
Marine pipelines are subject to a similar regulatory regime. 
The incidence of failure in service is again low. Dragging ships’ 
anchors causes some failures, but that only occurs in shallow 
water (less than 50 m). Very rarely do ships sink on to pipelines, 
or do objects fall on to them. Pipelines of 400 mm diameter 
and larger have been found to be safe from damage caused by 
fishing gear, but smaller pipelines are trenched to protect them. 
Damage to underwater pipelines was examined in detail at a 
conference reported on in Morris and Breaux (1995). Palmer 
and King (2004) examine case studies of marine pipeline 
failures, and the technologies of trenching and monitoring. 
Most failures result from human error. Ecological impacts from 
a CO2 pipeline accident have yet to be assessed.
 
Marine pipelines are monitored internally by inspection 
devices called ‘pigs’ (as described earlier in Section 4.2.5), and 
externally by regular visual inspection from remotely operated 
vehicles. Some have independent leak detection systems.
4.4.4 
Ships
Ship systems can fail in various ways: through collision, 
foundering, stranding and fire. Perrow’s book on accidents 
(1984) includes many thought-provoking case studies. Many 
of the ships that he refers to were old, badly maintained and 
crewed by inadequately trained people. However, it is incorrect 
to think that marine accidents happen only to poorly regulated 
‘flag-of-convenience’ ships. Gottschalch and Stadler (1990) 
share Perrow’s opinion that many marine accidents can be 
attributed to system failures and human factors, whereas 
accidents arising as a consequence of purely technical factors 
are relatively uncommon.
 
Ship casualties are well summarized by Lloyds Maritime 
Information Service. Over 22.5 years between 1978 and 2000, 
there were 41,086 incidents of varying degrees of severity 
identified, of which 2,129 were classified as ‘serious’ (See Table 
4.2).
 
Tankers can be seen to have higher standards than ships in 
general. Stranding is the source of most of the tanker incidents 
that have led to public concern. It can be controlled by careful 
navigation along prescribed routes, and by rigorous standards 
of operation. LNG tankers are potentially dangerous, but are 
carefully designed and appear to be operated to very high 
standards. There have been no accidental losses of cargo from 
LNG ships. The LNG tanker El Paso Paul Kaiser ran aground 
at 17 knots in 1979, and incurred substantial hull damage, but 
the LNG tanks were not penetrated and no cargo was lost. There 
is extensive literature on marine transport of liquefied gas, with 
a strong emphasis on safety, for example, in Ffooks (1993).
 
Carbon dioxide tankers and terminals are clearly much less 
at risk from fire, but there is an asphyxiation risk if collision 
should rupture a tank. This risk can be minimized by making 
certain that the high standards of construction and operation 
currently applied to LPG are also applied to carbon dioxide.
 
An accident to a liquid CO2 tanker might release liquefied 
gas onto the surface of the sea. However, consideration of such 
an event is a knowledge gap that requires further study. CO2 
releases are anticipated not to have the long-term environmental 
Chapter 4: Transport of CO2
189
impacts of crude oil spills. CO2 would behave differently from 
LNG, because liquid CO2 in a tanker is not as cold as LNG but 
much denser. Its interactions with the sea would be complex: 
hydrates and ice might form, and temperature differences would 
induce strong currents. Some of the gas would dissolve in the 
sea, but some would be released to the atmosphere. If there 
were little wind and a temperature inversion, clouds of CO2 gas 
might lead to asphyxiation and might stop the ship’s engines.
 
The risk can be minimized by careful planning of routes, 
and by high standards of training and management.
4.5 Legal issues, codes and standards
Transportation of CO2 by ships and sub-sea pipelines, and across 
national boundaries, is governed by various international legal 
conventions. Many jurisdictions/states have environmental 
impact assessment and strategic environmental assessment 
legislation that will come into consideration in pipeline building. 
If a pipeline is constructed across another country’s territory 
(e.g. landlocked states), or if the pipeline is laid in certain zones 
of the sea, other countries may have the right to participate 
in the environmental assessment decision-making process or 
challenge another state’s project. 
4.5.1 
International conventions
Various international conventions could have implications 
for storage of CO2, the most significant being the UN Law of 
the Sea Convention, the London Convention, the Convention 
on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary 
Context (Espoo Convention) and OSPAR (see Chapter 5). 
The Espoo convention covers environmental assessment, a 
procedure that seeks to ensure the acquisition of adequate and 
early information on likely environmental consequences of 
development projects or activities, and on measures to mitigate 
harm. Pipelines are subject to environmental assessment. The 
most significant aspect of the Convention is that it lays down 
the general obligation of states to notify and consult each other 
if a project under consideration is likely to have a significant 
environmental impact across boundaries. In some cases the 
acceptability of CO2 storage under these conventions could 
depend on the method of transportation to the storage site. 
Conventions that are primarily concerned with discharge and 
placement rather than transport are discussed in detail in the 
chapters on ocean and geological storage.
 
The Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary 
Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal came 
into force in 1992 (UNEP, 2000). The Basel Convention 
was conceived partly on the basis that enhanced control of 
transboundary movement of wastes will act as an incentive 
for their environmentally sound management and for the 
reduction of the volume of movement. However, there is no 
indication that CO2 will be defined as a hazardous waste under 
the convention except in relation to the presence of impurities 
such as heavy metals and some organic compounds that may 
be entrained during the capture of CO2. Adoption of schemes 
where emissions of SO2 and NOx would be included with 
the CO2 may require such a review. Accordingly, the Basel 
Convention does not appear to directly impose any restriction 
on the transportation of CO2 (IEA GHG, 2003a). 
 
In addition to the provisions of the Basel Convention, any 
transport of CO2 would have to comply with international 
transport regulations. There are numerous specific agreements, 
some of which are conventions and others protocols of other 
conventions that apply depending on the mode of transport. 
There are also a variety of regional agreements dealing with 
transport of goods. International transport codes and agreements 
adhere to the UN Recommendations on the Transport of 
Dangerous Goods: Model Regulations published by the United 
Nations (2001). CO2 in gaseous and refrigerated liquid forms 
is classified as a non-flammable, non-toxic gas; while solid 
CO2 (dry ice) is classified under the heading of miscellaneous 
dangerous substances and articles. Any transportation of 
CO2 adhering to the Recommendations on the Transport of 
Dangerous Goods: Model Regulations can be expected to meet 
all relevant agreements and conventions covering transportation 
by whatever means. Nothing in these recommendations would 
imply that transportation of CO2 would be prevented by 
international transport agreements and conventions (IEA GHG, 
2003a).
4.5.2 
National codes and standards
The transport of CO2 by pipeline has been practiced for over 25 
years. Internationally adopted standards such as ASME B31.4, 
Liquid transportation systems for hydrocarbons, liquid petroleum 
gas, anhydrous ammonia and alcohols’ and the widely-applied 
Norwegian standard (DNV, 2000) specifically mention CO2. 
There is considerable experience in the application and use of 
these standards. Existing standards and codes vary between 
different countries but gradual unification of these documents 
is being advanced by such international bodies as ISO and CEN

as part of their function. A full review of relevant standards 
categorized by issues is presented in IEA GHG, 2003b. 
 
Public concern could highlight the issue of leakage of CO2 
from transportation systems, either by rupture or minor leaks, 
as discussed in Section 4.4. It is possible that standards may be 
changed in future to address specific public concerns. Odorants 
are often added to domestic low-pressure gas distribution 
systems, but not to gas in long-distance pipelines; they could, 
in principle, be added to CO2 in pipelines. Mercaptans, 
naturally present in the Weyburn pipeline system, are the 
most effective odorants but are not generally suitable for this 
application because they are degraded by O2 , even at very low 
concentrations (Katz, 1959). Disulphides, thioethers and ring 
compounds containing sulphur are alternatives. The value and 
impact of odorization could be established by a quantitative risk 
assessment.
4.6  
Costs
4.6.1 
Costs of pipeline transport
The costs of pipelines can be categorized into three items
• 
Construction costs 
-   Material/equipment costs (pipe, pipe coating, cathodic 
protection, telecommunication equipment; possible 
booster stations)
-  Installation costs (labour)
• 
Operation and maintenance costs
- Monitoring costs
- Maintenance costs
- (Possible) energy costs
• 
 Other costs (design, project management, regulatory filing 
fees, insurances costs, right-of-way costs, contingencies 
allowances)
The pipeline material costs depend on the length of the pipeline, 
the diameter, the amount of CO2 to be transported and the 
quality of the carbon dioxide. Corrosion issues are examined in 
Section 4.2.2 For costs it is assumed that CO2 is delivered from 
the capture system at 10 MPa.
 
Figure 4.3 shows capital investment costs for pipelines. 
Investments are higher when compressor station(s) are required 
to compensate for pressure loss along the pipeline, or for 
longer pipelines or for hilly terrain. Compressor stations may 
be avoided by increasing the pipeline diameter and reducing 
the flow velocity. Reported transport velocity varies from 1 
to 5 m s-1. The actual design will be optimized with regard to 
pipeline diameter, pressure loss (required compressor stations 
and power) and pipeline wall thickness.
 
Costs depend on the terrain. Onshore pipeline costs may 
increase by 50 to 100% or more when the pipeline route 
is congested and heavily populated. Costs also increase in 
mountains, in nature reserve areas, in areas with obstacles 
such as rivers and freeways, and in heavily urbanized areas 
because of accessibility to construction and additional required 
safety measures. Offshore pipelines generally operate at higher 
pressures and lower temperatures than onshore pipelines, and 
are often, but not always, 40 to 70% more expensive. 
 
It is cheaper to collect CO2 from several sources into a single 
pipeline than to transport smaller amounts separately. Early and 
smaller projects will face relatively high transport costs, and 
therefore be sensitive to transport distance, whereas an evolution 
towards higher capacities (large and wide-spread application) 
may result in a decrease in transport costs. Implementation of 
a ‘backbone’ transport structure may facilitate access to large 
remote storage reservoirs, but infrastructure of this kind will 
require large initial upfront investment decisions. Further study 
is required to determine the possible advantages of such pipeline 
system.
 
Figure 4.4 presents onshore and offshore transport costs 
versus pipeline diameter; where costs are based on investment 
cost information from various sources. Figure 4.5 gives a cost 
window for specific transport as function of the flow. Steel is a 
cost component for both pipelines and ships, and steel prices 
doubled in the two years up to 2005: this may be temporary.
4.6.2 
Costs of marine transportation systems
Costs of a marine transport system comprise many cost 
elements. Besides investments for ships, investments are 
required for loading and unloading facilities, intermediate 
storage and liquefaction units. Further costs are for operation 
(e.g. labour, ship fuel costs, electricity costs, harbour fees), 
and maintenance. An optimal use of installations and ships in 
the transport cycle is crucial. Extra facilities (e.g. an expanded 
storage requirement) have to be created to be able to anticipate 
on possible disruptions in the transport system.
 
The cost of marine transport systems is not known in detail 
at present, since no system has been implemented on a scale 
required for CCS projects (i.e. in the range of several million 
tonnes of carbon dioxide handling per year). Designs have been 
submitted for tender, so a reasonable amount of knowledge is 
available. Nevertheless, cost estimates vary widely, because 
CO2 shipping chains of this size have never been built and 
economies of scale may be anticipated to have a major impact 
on the costs.
 
A ship designed for carrying CO2 from harbour to harbour 
may cost about 30-50% more than a similar size semi-
refrigerated LPG ship (Statoil, 2004). However, since the 
density of liquid CO2 is about 1100 kg m-3, CO2 ships will carry 
more mass than an equivalent LNG or LPG ship, where the 
cargo density is about 500 kg m-3.  The estimated cost of ships 
of 20 to 30 kt capacity is between 50 and 70 M$ (Statoil, 2004). 
Another source (IEA GHG, 2004) estimates ship construction 
costs at US$ 34 million for 10 kt-sized ship, US$ 60 million 
with a capacity of 30 kt, or US$ 85 million with a capacity of 
50 kt. A time charter rate of about 25,000 US$ day-1 covering 
capital charges, manning and maintenance is not unreasonable 
for a ship in the 20 kt carrying capacity range. 
 
The cost for a liquefaction facility is estimated by Statoil 
(2004) at US$ 35 to US$ 50 million for a capacity of 1 Mt 
per year. The present largest liquefaction unit is 0.35 Mt yr-1.

booster stations (IEA GHG, 2002; Hendriks et al., 2005; Bock, 2003; Sarv, 2000; 2001a; 2001b; Ormerod, 1994; Chandler, 2000; O&GJ, 
2000).

applying a capital charge rate of 15% and a load factor of 100% (IEA GHG, 2002; Hendriks et al., 2005; Bock, 2003; Sarv, 2000; 2001a; 2001b; 
Ormerod, 1994; Chandler, 2000; O&GJ, 2000)
192
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
IEA GHG (2004) estimates a considerable lower investment for 
a liquefaction facility, namely US$ 80 million for 6.2 Mt yr-1. 
Investment costs are reduced to US$ 30 million when carbon 
dioxide at 100 bar is delivered to the plant. This pressure level 
is assumed to be delivered from the capture unit. Cost estimates 
are influenced by local conditions; for example, the absence of 
sufficient cooling water may call for a more expensive ammonia 
driven cooling cycle. The difference in numbers also reflects 
the uncertainty accompanied by scaling up of such facilities 
 
A detailed study (Statoil, 2004) considered a marine 
transportation system for 5.5 Mt yr-1. The base case had 20 kt 
tankers with a speed of 35 km h-1, sailing 7600 km on each 
trip; 17 tankers were required. The annual cost was estimated 
at US$ 188 million, excluding linquefaction and US$ 300 
million, including liquefaction, decreasing to US$ 232 million 
if compression is allowed (to avoid double counting). The 
corresponding specific transport costs are 34, 55, and 42 US$ 
t-1. The study also considered sensitivity to distance: for the case 
excluding liquefaction, the specific costs were 20 US$ t-1 for 
500 km, 22 US$ t-1 for 1500 km, and 28 US$ t-1 for 4500 km.
 
A study on a comparable ship transportation system carried 
out for the IEA shows lower costs. For a distance of 7600 km 
using 30 kt ships, the costs are estimated at 35 US$ t-1. These 
costs are reduced to 30 US$ tonne-1 for 50 kt ships. The IEA 
study also showed a stronger cost dependency on distance than 
the Statoil (2004) study. 
 
It should be noted that marine transport induces more 
associated CO2 transport emissions than pipelines due to 
additional energy use for liquefaction and fuel use in ships. 
IEA GHG (2004) estimated 2.5% extra CO2 emissions for a 
transport distance of 200 km and about 18% for 12,000 km. 
The extra CO2 emissions for each 1000 km pipelines come to 
about 1 to 2%.
 
Ship transport becomes cost-competitive with pipeline 
transport over larger distances. Figure 4.6 shows an estimate 
of the costs for transporting 6 Mt yr-1 by offshore pipeline and 
by ship. The break-even distance, i.e. the distance for which the 
costs per transport mode are the same, is about 1000 km for this 
example. Transport of larger quantities will shift the break-even 
distance towards larger distances. However, the cross-over 
point beyond which ship transportation becomes cheaper than 
pipeline transportation is not simply a matter of distance alone. 
It involves many other factors, including loading terminals, 
pipeline shore crossings, water depth, seabed stability, fuel 
cost, construction costs, different operating costs in different 
locations, security, and interaction between land and marine 
transportation routes.

Chapter 5: Underground geological storage
197
ExECUtivE SUmmARy
Underground accumulation of carbon dioxide (CO2) is a 
widespread geological phenomenon, with natural trapping of CO2 
in underground reservoirs. Information and experience gained 
from the injection and/or storage of CO2 from a large number 
of existing enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and acid gas projects, 
as well as from the Sleipner, Weyburn and In Salah projects, 
indicate that it is feasible to store CO2 in geological formations 
as a CO2 mitigation option. Industrial analogues, including 
underground natural gas storage projects around the world and 
acid gas injection projects, provide additional indications that 
CO2 can be safely injected and stored at well-characterized and 
properly managed sites. While there are differences between 
natural accumulations and engineered storage, injecting CO2 into 
deep geological formations at carefully selected sites can store 
it underground for long periods of time: it is considered likely 
that 99% or more of the injected CO2 will be retained for 1000 
years. Depleted oil and gas reservoirs, possibly coal formations 
and particularly saline formations (deep underground porous 
reservoir rocks saturated with brackish water or brine), can 
be used for storage of CO2. At depths below about 800–1000 
m, supercritical CO2 has a liquid-like density that provides the 
potential for efficient utilization of underground storage space 
in the pores of sedimentary rocks. Carbon dioxide can remain 
trapped underground by virtue of a number of mechanisms, such 
as: trapping below an impermeable, confining layer (caprock); 
retention as an immobile phase trapped in the pore spaces 
of the storage formation; dissolution in the in situ formation 
fluids; and/or adsorption onto organic matter in coal and shale. 
Additionally, it may be trapped by reacting with the minerals 
in the storage formation and caprock to produce carbonate 
minerals. Models are available to predict what happens when 
CO2 is injected underground. Also, by avoiding deteriorated 
wells or open fractures or faults, injected CO2 will be retained 
for very long periods of time. Moreover, CO2 becomes less 
mobile over time as a result of multiple trapping mechanisms, 
further lowering the prospect of leakage.
 
Injection of CO2 in deep geological formations uses 
technologies that have been developed for and applied by, 
the oil and gas industry. Well-drilling technology, injection 
technology, computer simulation of storage reservoir dynamics 
and monitoring methods can potentially be adapted from 
existing applications to meet the needs of geological storage. 
Beyond conventional oil and gas technology, other successful 
underground injection practices – including natural gas storage, 
acid gas disposal and deep injection of liquid wastes – as well as 
the industry’s extensive experience with subsurface disposal of 
oil-field brines, can provide useful information about designing 
programmes for long-term storage of CO2. Geological storage 
of CO2 is in practice today beneath the North Sea, where nearly 
1 MtCO2 has been successfully injected annually at Sleipner 
since 1996 and in Algeria at the In-Salah gas field. Carbon 
dioxide is also injected underground to recover oil. About 30 
Mt of non-anthropogenic CO2 are injected annually, mostly 
in west Texas, to recover oil from over 50 individual projects, 
some of which started in the early 1970s. The Weyburn Project 
 
in Canada, where currently 1–2 MtCO2 are injected annually, 
combines EOR with a comprehensive monitoring and modelling 
programme to evaluate CO2 storage. Several more storage 
projects are under development at this time.
 
In areas with suitable hydrocarbon accumulations, CO2-
EOR may be implemented because of the added economic 
benefit of incremental oil production, which may offset some 
of the costs of CO2 capture, transport and injection. Storage 
of CO2 in coal beds, in conjunction with enhanced coal bed 
methane (ECBM) production, is potentially attractive because 
of the prospect of enhanced production of methane, the 
cleanest of the fossil fuels. This technology, however, is not 
well developed and a better understanding of injection and 
storage processes in coals is needed. Carbon dioxide storage 
in depleted oil and gas reservoirs is very promising in some 
areas, because these structures are well known and significant 
infrastructures are already in place. Nevertheless, relatively 
few hydrocarbon reservoirs are currently depleted or near 
depletion and CO2 storage will have to be staged to fit the time 
of reservoir availability. Deep saline formations are believed to 
have by far the largest capacity for CO2 storage and are much 
more widespread than other options. 
 
While there are uncertainties, the global capacity to store 
CO2 deep underground is large. Depleted oil and gas reservoirs 
are estimated to have a storage capacity of 675–900 GtCO2. 
Deep saline formations are very likely to have a storage capacity 
of at least 1000 GtCO2 and some studies suggest it may be an 
order of magnitude greater than this, but quantification of the 
upper range is difficult until additional studies are undertaken. 
Capacity of unminable coal formations is uncertain, with 
estimates ranging from as little as 3 GtCO2 up to 200 GtCO2. 
Potential storage sites are likely to be broadly distributed in 
many of the world’s sedimentary basins, located in the same 
region as many of the world’s emission sources and are likely to 
be adequate to store a significant proportion of those emissions 
well into the future.
 
The cost of geological storage of CO2 is highly site-specific, 
depending on factors such as the depth of the storage formation, 
the number of wells needed for injection and whether the 
project is onshore or offshore – but costs for storage, including 
monitoring, appear to lie in the range of 0.6–8.3 US$/tCO2 
stored. This cost is small compared to present-day costs of CO2 
capture from flue gases, as indicated in Chapter 3. EOR could 
lead to negative storage costs of 10–16 US$/tCO2 for oil prices 
of 15–20 US$ per barrel and more for higher oil prices. 
 
Potential risks to humans and ecosystems from geological 
storage may arise from leaking injection wells, abandoned 
wells, leakage across faults and ineffective confining layers. 
Leakage of CO2 could potentially degrade the quality 
of groundwater, damage some hydrocarbon or mineral  
resources, and have lethal effects on plants and sub-soil animals. 
Release of CO2 back into the atmosphere could also create 
local health and safety concerns. Avoiding or mitigating these 
impacts will require careful site selection, effective regulatory 
oversight, an appropriate monitoring programme that provides 
198
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
early warning that the storage site is not functioning as 
anticipated and implementation of remediation methods to stop 
or control CO2 releases. Methods to accomplish these are being 
developed and tested. 
 
There are few, if any, national regulations specifically 
dealing with CO2 storage, but regulations dealing with oil and 
gas, groundwater and the underground injection of fluids can 
in many cases be readily adapted and/or adopted. However, 
there are no regulations relating specifically to long-term 
responsibility for storage. A number of international laws that 
predate any consideration of CO2 storage are relevant to offshore 
geological storage; consideration of whether these laws do or 
do not permit offshore geological storage is under way. 
 
There are gaps in our knowledge, such as regional storage-
capacity estimates for many parts of the world. Similarly, better 
estimation of leakage rates, improved cost data, better intervention 
and remediation options, more pilot and demonstration projects 
and clarity on the issue of long-term stewardship all require 
consideration. Despite the fact that more work is needed to 
improve technologies and decrease uncertainty, there appear to 
be no insurmountable technical barriers to an increased uptake 
of geological storage as an effective mitigation option.

introduction
5.1.1 
What is geological storage?
Capture and geological storage of CO2 provide a way to avoid 
emitting CO2 into the atmosphere, by capturing CO2 from 
major stationary sources (Chapter 3), transporting it usually 
by pipeline (Chapter 4) and injecting it into suitable deep rock 
formations. This chapter explores the nature of geological 
storage and considers its potential as a mitigation option. 
 
The subsurface is the Earth’s largest carbon reservoir, where 
the vast majority of the world’s carbon is held in coals, oil, gas 
organic-rich shales and carbonate rocks. Geological storage of 
CO2 has been a natural process in the Earth’s upper crust for 
hundreds of millions of years. Carbon dioxide derived from 
biological activity, igneous activity and chemical reactions 
between rocks and fluids accumulates in the natural subsurface 
environment as carbonate minerals, in solution or in a gaseous 
or supercritical form, either as a gas mixture or as pure CO2. 
The engineered injection of CO2 into subsurface geological 
formations was first undertaken in Texas, USA, in the early 
1970s, as part of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) projects and has 
been ongoing there and at many other locations ever since. 
 
Geological storage of anthropogenic CO2 as a greenhouse 
gas mitigation option was first proposed in the 1970s, but little 
research was done until the early 1990s, when the idea gained 
credibility through the work of individuals and research groups 
(Marchetti, 1977; Baes et al., 1980; Kaarstad, 1992; Koide et al., 
1992; van der Meer, 1992; Gunter et al., 1993; Holloway and 
Savage, 1993; Bachu et al., 1994; Korbol and Kaddour, 1994). 
The subsurface disposal of acid gas (a by-product of petroleum 
production with a CO2 content of up to 98%) in the Alberta 
Basin of Canada and in the United States provides additional 
useful experience. In 1996, the world’s first large-scale storage 
project was initiated by Statoil and its partners at the Sleipner 
Gas Field in the North Sea. 
 
By the late 1990s, a number of publicly and privately 
funded research programmes were under way in the United 
States, Canada, Japan, Europe and Australia. Throughout this 
time, though less publicly, a number of oil companies became 
increasingly interested in geological storage as a mitigation 
option, particularly for gas fields with a high natural CO2 
content such as Natuna in Indonesia, In Salah in Algeria and 
Gorgon in Australia. More recently, coal mining companies 
and electricity-generation companies have started to investigate 
geological storage as a mitigation option of relevance to their 
industry. 
 
In a little over a decade, geological storage of CO2 has 
Figure 5.3  Options for storing CO2 in deep underground geological formations (after Cook, 1999).
200
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
grown from a concept of limited interest to one that is quite 
widely regarded as a potentially important mitigation option 
(Figure 5.1). There are several reasons for this. First, as research 
has progressed and as demonstration and commercial projects 
have been successfully undertaken, the level of confidence 
in the technology has increased. Second, there is consensus 
that a broad portfolio of mitigation options is needed. Third, 
geological storage (in conjunction with CO2 capture) could help 
to make deep cuts to atmospheric CO2 emissions. However, 
if that potential is to be realized, the technique must be safe, 
environmentally sustainable, cost-effective and capable of 
being broadly applied. This chapter explores these issues. 
 
To geologically store CO2, it must first be compressed, 
usually to a dense fluid state known as ‘supercritical’ (see 
Glossary). Depending on the rate that temperature increases 
with depth (the geothermal gradient), the density of CO2 will 
increase with depth, until at about 800 m or greater, the injected 
CO2 will be in a dense supercritical state (Figure 5.2).
 
Geological storage of CO2 can be undertaken in a variety 
of geological settings in sedimentary basins. Within these 
basins, oil fields, depleted gas fields, deep coal seams and saline 
formations are all possible storage formations (Figure 5.3). 
 
Subsurface geological storage is possible both onshore 
and offshore, with offshore sites accessed through pipelines 
from the shore or from offshore platforms. The continental 
shelf and some adjacent deep-marine sedimentary basins are 
potential offshore storage sites, but the majority of sediments 
of the abyssal deep ocean floor are too thin and impermeable 
to be suitable for geological storage (Cook and Carleton, 
2000). In addition to storage in sedimentary formations, some 
consideration has been given to storage in caverns, basalt and 
organic-rich shales (Section 5.3.5). 
 
Fluids have been injected on a massive scale into the deep 
subsurface for many years to dispose of unwanted chemicals, 
pollutants or by-products of petroleum production, to enhance 
the production of oil and gas or to recharge depleted formations 
(Wilson et al., 2003). The principles involved in such activities 
are well established and in most countries there are regulations 
governing these activities. Natural gas has also been injected 
and stored in the subsurface on a large scale in many parts of the 
world for many years. Injection of CO2 to date has been done at 
a relatively small scale, but if it were to be used to significantly 
decrease emissions from existing stationary sources, then the 
injection rates would have to be at a scale similar to other 
injection operations under way at present.
 
But what is the world’s geological storage capacity and 
does it occur where we need it? These questions were first 
raised in Chapter 2, but Section 5.3.8 of this chapter considers 
geographical matching of CO2 sources to geological storage 
sites in detail. Not all sedimentary basins are suitable for CO2 
storage; some are too shallow and others are dominated by 
rocks with low permeability or poor confining characteristics. 
Basins suitable for CO2 storage have characteristics such as 
thick accumulations of sediments, permeable rock formations 
saturated with saline water (saline formations), extensive covers 
of low porosity rocks (acting as seals) and structural simplicity. 
While many basins show such features, many others do not. 
 
Is there likely to be sufficient storage capacity to meet the 
world’s needs in the years ahead? To consider this issue, it is useful 
to draw parallels with the terms ‘resources’ and ‘reserves’ used 
for mineral deposits (McKelvey, 1972). Deposits of minerals or 
fossil fuels are often cited with very large resource figures, but 
the ‘proven’ reserve is only some fraction of the resource. The 
resource figures are based on the selling price of the commodity, 
the cost of exploiting the commodity, the availability of 
appropriate technologies, proof that the commodity exists 
and whether the environmental or social impact of exploiting 
the commodity is acceptable to the community. Similarly, to 
turn technical geological storage capacity into economical 
storage capacity, the storage project must be economically 
viable, technically feasible, safe, environmentally and socially 
sustainable and acceptable to the community. Given these 
constraints, it is inevitable that the storage capacity that will 
actually be used will be significantly less than the technical 
potential. Section 5.3 explores this issue. It is likely that usable 
storage capacity will exist in many areas where people live and 
where CO2 is generated from large stationary sources. This 
geographical congruence of storage-need and storage-capacity 
should not come as a surprise, because much of the world’s 
population is concentrated in regions underlain by sedimentary 
basins (Gunter et al., 2004). 
 
It is also important to know how securely and for how long 
stored CO2 will be retained – for decades, centuries, millennia or 
for geological time? To assure public safety, storage sites must 
be designed and operated to minimize the possibility of leakage. 
Consequently, potential leakage pathways must be identified 
and procedures must be established, to set appropriate design 
and operational standards as well as monitoring, measurement 
and verification requirements. Sections 5.4, 5.6 and 5.7 consider 
these issues. 
 
In this chapter, we primarily consider storage of pure 
or nearly pure, CO2. It has been suggested that it may be 
economically favourable to co-store CO2 along with H2S, SO2 
or NO2. Since only a few scientific studies have evaluated the 
impacts of these added constituents on storage performance or 
risks, they are not addressed comprehensively here. Moreover, 
the limited information gained from practical experience with 
acid gas injection in Canada is insufficient to assess the impacts 
of the added components on storage security.
5.1.2  
Existing and planned CO2 projects
A number of pilot and commercial CO2 storage projects are under 
way or proposed (Figure 5.1). To date, most actual or planned 
commercial projects are associated with major gas production 
facilities that have gas streams containing CO2 in the range of 
10–15% by volume, such as Sleipner in the North Sea, Snohvit 
in the Barents Sea, In Salah in Algeria and Gorgon in Australia 
(Figure 5.1), as well as the acid gas injection projects in Canada 
and the United States. At the Sleipner Project, operated by 
Statoil, more than 7 MtCO2 has been injected into a deep sub-
sea saline formation since 1996 (Box 5.1). Existing and planned

At the In Salah Gas Field in Algeria, Sonatrack, BP and 
Statoil inject CO2 stripped from natural gas into the gas reservoir 
outside the boundaries of the gas field (Box 5.2). Statoil is 
planning another project in the Barents Sea, where CO2 from the 
Snohvit field will be stripped from the gas and injected into a 
geological formation below the gas field. Chevron is proposing 
to produce gas from the Gorgon field off Western Australia, 
containing approximately 14% CO2. The CO2 will be injected 
into the Dupuy Formation at Barrow Island (Oen, 2003). In The 
Netherlands, CO2 is being injected at pilot scale into the almost 
depleted K12-B offshore gas field (van der Meer et al., 2005).  
 
Forty-four CO2-rich acid gas injection projects are currently 
operating in Western Canada, ongoing since the early 1990s 
(Bachu and Haug, 2005). Although they are mostly small scale, 
they provide important examples of effectively managing 
injection of CO2 and hazardous gases such as H2S (Section 
5.2.4.2).

IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
The Sleipner Project, operated by Statoil in the North Sea about 250 km off the coast of Norway, is the first commercial-
scale project dedicated to geological CO2 storage in a saline formation. The CO2 (about 9%) from Sleipner West Gas Field 
is separated, then injected into a large, deep, saline formation 800 m below the seabed of the North Sea. The Saline Aquifer 
CO2 Storage (SACS) project was established to monitor and research the storage of CO2. From 1995, the IEA Greenhouse 
Gas R&D Programme has worked with Statoil to arrange the monitoring and research activities. Approximately 1 MtCO2 is 
removed from the produced natural gas and injected underground annually in the field. The CO2 injection operation started 
in October 1996 and, by early 2005, more than 7 MtCO2 had been injected at a rate of approximately 2700 t day–1. Over the 
lifetime of the project, a total of 20 MtCO2 is expected to be stored. A simplified diagram of the Sleipner scheme is given in 
Figure 5.4.
  
The saline formation into which the CO2 is injected is a brine-saturated unconsolidated sandstone about 800–1000 m 
below the sea floor. The formation also contains secondary thin shale layers, which influence the internal movement of injected 
CO2. The saline formation has a very large storage capacity, on the order of 1–10 GtCO2. The top of the formation is fairly flat 
on a regional scale, although it contains numerous small, low-amplitude closures. The overlying primary seal is an extensive, 
thick, shale layer. 
  
This project is being carried out in three phases. Phase-0 involved baseline data gathering and evaluation, which was 
completed in November 1998. Phase-1 involved establishment of project status after three years of CO2 injection. Five main 
project areas involve descriptions of reservoir geology, reservoir simulation, geochemistry, assessment of need and cost for 
monitoring wells and geophysical modelling. Phase-2, involving data interpretation and model verification, began in April 
2000. 
  
The fate and transport of the CO2 plume in the storage formation has been monitored successfully by seismic time-lapse 
surveys (Figure 5.16). The surveys also show that the caprock is an effective seal that prevents CO2 migration out of the storage 
formation. Today, the footprint of the plume at Sleipner extends over an area of approximately 5 km2. Reservoir studies and 
simulations covering hundreds to thousands of years have shown that CO2 will eventually dissolve in the pore water, which 
will become heavier and sink, thus minimizing the potential for long-term leakage (Lindeberg and Bergmo, 2003).

Opportunities for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) have 
increased interest in CO2 storage (Stevens et al., 2001b; 
Moberg et al., 2003; Moritis, 2003; Riddiford et al., 2003; 
Torp and Gale, 2003). Although not designed for CO2 storage, 
CO2-EOR projects can demonstrate associated storage of CO2, 
although lack of comprehensive monitoring of EOR projects 
(other than at the International Energy Agency Greenhouse Gas 
(IEA-GHG) Weyburn Project in Canada) makes it difficult to 
quantify storage. In the United States, approximately 73 CO2-
EOR operations inject up to 30 MtCO2 yr-1, most of which comes 
from natural CO2 accumulations – although approximately 3 
MtCO2 is from anthropogenic sources, such as gas processing 
and fertiliser plants (Stevens et al., 2001b). The SACROC 
project in Texas was the first large-scale commercial CO2-
EOR project in the world. It used anthropogenic CO2 during 
the period 1972 to 1995. The Rangely Weber project (Box 
5.6) injects anthropogenic CO2 from a gas-processing plant in 
Wyoming. 
 
In Canada, a CO2-EOR project has been established by 
EnCana at the Weyburn Oil Field in southern Saskatchewan 
(Box 5.3). The project is expected to inject 23 MtCO2 and 
extend the life of the oil field by 25 years (Moberg et al., 
The In Salah Gas Project, a joint venture among Sonatrach, BP and Statoil located in the central Saharan region of Algeria, 
is the world’s first large-scale CO2 storage project in a gas reservoir (Riddiford et al., 2003). The Krechba Field at In Salah 
produces natural gas containing up to 10% CO2 from several geological reservoirs and delivers it to markets in Europe, after 
processing and stripping the CO2 to meet commercial specifications. The project involves re-injecting the CO2 into a sandstone 
reservoir at a depth of 1800 m and storing up to 1.2 MtCO2 yr-1. Carbon dioxide injection started in April 2004 and, over the 
life of the project, it is estimated that 17 MtCO2 will be geologically stored. The project consists of four production and three 
injection wells (Figure 5.5). Long-reach (up to 1.5 km) horizontal wells are used to inject CO2 into the 5-mD permeability 
reservoir.
  
The Krechba Field is a relatively simple anticline. Carbon dioxide injection takes place down-dip from the gas/water 
contact in the gas-bearing reservoir. The injected CO2 is expected to eventually migrate into the area of the current gas field 
after depletion of the gas zone. The field has been mapped with three-dimensional seismic and well data from the field. Deep 
faults have been mapped, but at shallower levels, the structure is unfaulted. The storage target in the reservoir interval therefore 
carries minimal structural uncertainty or risk. The top seal is a thick succession of mudstones up to 950 m thick. 
  
A preliminary risk assessment of CO2 storage integrity has been carried out and baseline data acquired. Processes that 
could result in CO2 migration from the injection interval have been quantified and a monitoring programme is planned involving 
a range of technologies, including noble gas tracers, pressure surveys, tomography, gravity baseline studies, microbiological 
studies, four-dimensional seismic and geomechanical monitoring.

wells with slotted intervals of up to 1.5 km are used to inject CO2 into the water-filled parts of the gas reservoir.

2003; Law, 2005). The fate of the injected CO2 is being closely 
monitored through the IEA GHG Weyburn Project (Wilson and 
Monea, 2005). Carbon dioxide-EOR is under consideration for 
the North Sea, although there is as yet little, if any, operational 
experience for offshore CO2-EOR. Carbon dioxide-EOR 
projects are also currently under way in a number of countries 
including Trinidad, Turkey and Brazil (Moritis, 2002). Saudi 
Aramco, the world’s largest producer and exporter of crude oil, 
is evaluating the technical feasibility of CO2-EOR in some of its 
Saudi Arabian reservoirs.
 
In addition to these commercial storage or EOR projects, 
a number of pilot storage projects are under way or planned. 
The Frio Brine Project in Texas, USA, involved injection and 
storage of 1900 tCO2 in a highly permeable formation with a 
regionally extensive shale seal (Hovorka et al., 2005). Pilot 
projects are proposed for Ketzin, west of Berlin, Germany, for 
the Otway Basin of southeast Australia and for Teapot Dome, 
Wyoming, USA (Figure 5.1). The American FutureGen project, 
proposed for late this decade, will be a geological storage 
project linked to coal-fired electricity generation. A small-scale 
CO2 injection and monitoring project is being carried out by 
RITE at Nagoaka in northwest Honshu, Japan. Small-scale 
injection projects to test CO2 storage in coal have been carried 
out in Europe (RECOPOL) and Japan (Yamaguchi et al., 
2005). A CO2-enhanced coal bed methane (ECBM) recovery 
demonstration project has been undertaken in the northern 
San Juan Basin of New Mexico, USA (Reeves, 2003a) (Box 
5.7). Further CO2-ECBM projects are under consideration for 
China, Canada, Italy and Poland (Gale, 2003). In all, some 59 
opportunities for CO2-ECBM have been identified worldwide, 
the majority in China (van Bergen et al., 2003a). 
 
These projects (Figure 5.1; Table 5.1) demonstrate that 
subsurface injection of CO2 is not for the distant future, but is 
being implemented now for environmental and/or commercial 
reasons.
5.1.3 
Key questions
In the previous section, the point is made that deep injection of 
CO2 is under way in a number of places (Figure 5.1). However, 
if CO2 storage is to be undertaken on the scale necessary to make 
deep cuts to atmospheric CO2 emissions, there must be hundreds, 
and perhaps even thousands, of large-scale geological storage 
projects under way worldwide. The extent to which this is or 
might be, feasible depends on the answers to the key questions 
outlined below and addressed subsequently in this chapter:
•� �How is CO2 stored underground? What happens to the 
CO2 when it is injected? What are the physico-chemical 
and chemical processes involved? What are the geological 
The Weyburn CO2-enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) project is located in the Williston Basin, a geological structure extending 
from south-central Canada into north-central United States. The project aims to permanently store almost all of the injected 
CO2 by eliminating the CO2 that would normally be released during the end of the field life. 
  
The source of the CO2 for the Weyburn CO2-EOR Project is the Dakota Gasification Company facility, located 
approximately 325 km south of Weyburn, in Beulah, North Dakota, USA. At the plant, coal is gasified to make synthetic gas 
(methane), with a relatively pure stream of CO2 as a by-product. This CO2 stream is dehydrated, compressed and piped to 
Weyburn in southeastern Saskatchewan, Canada, for use in the field. The Weyburn CO2-EOR Project is designed to take CO2 
from the pipeline for about 15 years, with delivered volumes dropping from 5000 to about 3000 t day–1 over the life of the 
project.
  
The Weyburn field covers an area of 180 km2, with original oil in place on the order of 222 million m3 (1396 million 
barrels). Over the life of the CO2-EOR project (20–25 years), it is expected that some 20 MtCO2 will be stored in the field, 
under current economic conditions and oil recovery technology. The oil field layout and operation is relatively conventional 
for oil field operations. The field has been designed with a combination of vertical and horizontal wells to optimize the sweep 
efficiency of the CO2. In all cases, production and injection strings are used within the wells to protect the integrity of the 
casing of the well. 
  
The oil reservoir is a fractured carbonate, 20–27 m thick. The primary upper seal for the reservoir is an anhydrite zone. 
At the northern limit of the reservoir, the carbonate thins against a regional unconformity. The basal seal is also anhydrite, but 
is less consistent across the area of the reservoir. A thick, flat-lying shale above the unconformity forms a good regional barrier 
to leakage from the reservoir. In addition, several high-permeability formations containing saline groundwater would form 
good conduits for lateral migration of any CO2 that might reach these zones, with rapid dissolution of the CO2 in the formation 
fluids. 
  
Since CO2 injection began in late 2000, the EOR project has performed largely as predicted. Currently, some 1600 m3 
(10,063 barrels) day–1 of incremental oil is being produced from the field. All produced CO2 is captured and recompressed for 
reinjection into the production zone. Currently, some 1000 tCO2 day–1 is reinjected; this will increase as the project matures. 
Monitoring is extensive, with high-resolution seismic surveys and surface monitoring to determine any potential leakage. 
Surface monitoring includes sampling and analysis of potable groundwater, as well as soil gas sampling and analysis (Moberg 
et al., 2003). To date, there has been no indication of CO2 leakage to the surface and near-surface environment (White, 2005; 
Strutt et al., 2003).

5.2 
Storage mechanisms and storage security
Geological formations in the subsurface are composed of 
transported and deposited rock grains organic material and 
minerals that form after the rocks are deposited. The pore space 
between grains or minerals is occupied by fluid (mostly water, 
with proportionally minute occurrences of oil and gas). Open 
fractures and cavities are also filled with fluid. Injection of CO2 
into the pore space and fractures of a permeable formation can 
displace the in situ fluid or the CO2 may dissolve in or mix with 
the fluid or react with the mineral grains or there may be some 
combination of these processes. This section examines these 
processes and their influence on geological storage of CO2.
5.2.1 
CO2 flow and transport processes
Injection of fluids into deep geological formations is achieved 
by pumping fluids down into a well (see Section 5.5). The part of 
the well in the storage zone is either perforated or covered with 
a permeable screen to enable the CO2 to enter the formation. 
The perforated or screened interval is usually on the order of 
10–100 m thick, depending on the permeability and thickness 
of the formation. Injection raises the pressure near the well, 
allowing CO2 to enter the pore spaces initially occupied by the 
in situ formation fluids. The amount and spatial distribution 
of pressure buildup in the formation will depend on the rate 
of injection, the permeability and thickness of the injection 
formation, the presence or absence of permeability barriers 
within it and the geometry of the regional underground water 
(hydrogeological) system.
 
Once injected into the formation, the primary flow and 
transport mechanisms that control the spread of CO2 include:
•� �Fluid flow (migration) in response to pressure gradients 
created by the injection process; 
•� Fluid flow in response to natural hydraulic gradients;
•� �Buoyancy caused by the density differences between CO2 
and the formation fluids;
•� Diffusion;
•� �Dispersion and fingering caused by formation heterogeneities 
and mobility contrast between CO2 and formation fluid; 
•� Dissolution into the formation fluid;
•� Mineralization;
•� Pore space (relative permeability) trapping;
•� Adsorption of CO2 onto organic material.
The rate of fluid flow depends on the number and properties of 
the fluid phases present in the formation. When two or more 
fluids mix in any proportion, they are referred to as miscible 
fluids. If they do not mix, they are referred to as immiscible. 
The presence of several different phases may decrease the 
permeability and slow the rate of migration. If CO2 is injected 
into a gas reservoir, a single miscible fluid phase consisting of 
natural gas and CO2 is formed locally. When CO2 is injected into 
a deep saline formation in a liquid or liquid-like supercritical 
dense phase, it is immiscible in water. Carbon dioxide injected 
into an oil reservoir may be miscible or immiscible, depending 
on the oil composition and the pressure and temperature of the 
system (Section 5.3.2). When CO2 is injected into coal beds, in 
addition to some of the processes listed above, adsorption and 
desorption of gases (particularly methane) previously adsorbed 
on the coal take place, as well as swelling or shrinkage of the 
coal itself (Section 5.3.4). 
 
Because supercritical CO2 is much less viscous than water 
and oil (by an order of magnitude or more), migration is 
controlled by the contrast in mobility of CO2 and the in situ 
formation fluids (Celia et al., 2005; Nordbotten et al., 2005a). 
Because of the comparatively high mobility of CO2, only some 
of the oil or water will be displaced, leading to an average 
saturation of CO2 in the range of 30–60%. Viscous fingering 
can cause CO2 to bypass much of the pore space, depending on 
the heterogeneity and anisotropy of rock permeability (van der 
Meer, 1995; Ennis-King and Paterson, 2001; Flett et al., 2005). 
In natural gas reservoirs, CO2 is more viscous than natural gas, 
so the ‘front’ will be stable and viscous fingering limited.
 
The magnitude of the buoyancy forces that drive vertical 
flow depends on the type of fluid in the formation. In saline 
formations, the comparatively large density difference (30–
50%) between CO2 and formation water creates strong buoyancy 
forces that drive CO2 upwards. In oil reservoirs, the density 
206
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
difference and buoyancy forces are not as large, particularly if 
the oil and CO2 are miscible (Kovscek, 2002). In gas reservoirs, 
the opposite effect will occur, with CO2 migrating downwards 
under buoyancy forces, because CO2 is denser than natural gas 
(Oldenburg et al., 2001).
 
In saline formations and oil reservoirs, the buoyant plume of 
injected CO2 migrates upwards, but not evenly. This is because 
a lower permeability layer acts as a barrier and causes the 
CO2 to migrate laterally, filling any stratigraphic or structural 
trap it encounters. The shape of the CO2 plume rising through 
the rock matrix (Figure 5.6) is strongly affected by formation 
heterogeneity, such as low-permeability shale lenses (Flett et al., 
2005). Low-permeability layers within the storage formation 
therefore have the effect of slowing the upward migration of 
CO2, which would otherwise cause CO2 to bypass deeper parts 
of the storage formation (Doughty et al., 2001).
 
As CO2 migrates through the formation, some of it will 
dissolve into the formation water. In systems with slowly 
flowing water, reservoir-scale numerical simulations show 
that, over tens of years, a significant amount, up to 30% of the 
injected CO2, will dissolve in formation water (Doughty et al., 
2001). Basin-scale simulations suggest that over centuries, the 
entire CO2 plume dissolves in formation water (McPherson 
and Cole, 2000; Ennis-King et al., 2003). If the injected 
CO2 is contained in a closed structure (no flow of formation 
water), it will take much longer for CO2 to completely dissolve 
because of reduced contact with unsaturated formation water. 
Once CO2 is dissolved in the formation fluid, it migrates along 
with the regional groundwater flow. For deep sedimentary 
basins characterized by low permeability and high salinity, 
groundwater flow velocities are very low, typically on the order 
of millimetres to centimetres per year (Bachu et al., 1994). 
Thus, migration rates of dissolved CO2 are substantially lower 
than for separate-phase CO2.
 
Water saturated with CO2 is slightly denser (approximately 
1%) than the original formation water, depending on salinity 
(Enick and Klara, 1990; Bachu and Adams, 2003). With 
high vertical permeability, this may lead to free convection, 
replacing the CO2-saturated water from the plume vicinity with 
unsaturated water, producing faster rates of CO2 dissolution 
(Lindeberg and Wessel-Berg, 1997; Ennis-King and Paterson, 
2003). Figure 5.7 illustrates the formation of convection cells 
and dissolution of CO2 over several thousand years. The 
solubility of CO2 in brine decreases with increasing pressure, 
decreasing temperature and increasing salinity (Annex 1). 
Calculations indicate that, depending on the salinity and depth, 
20–60 kgCO2 can dissolve in 1 m3 of formation fluid (Holt et 
al., 1995; Koide et al., 1995). With the use of a homogeneous 
model rather than a heterogeneous one, the time required for 
complete CO2 dissolution may be underestimated. 
 
As CO2 migrates through a formation, some of it is retained 
in the pore space by capillary forces (Figure 5.6), commonly 
referred to as ‘residual CO2 trapping’, which may immobilize 
significant amounts of CO2 (Obdam et al., 2003; Kumar et al., 
2005). Figure 5.8 illustrates that when the degree of trapping 
is high and CO2 is injected at the bottom of a thick formation, 
all of the CO2 may be trapped by this mechanism, even before 
it reaches the caprock at the top of the formation. While this 
effect is formation-specific, Holtz (2002) has demonstrated 
that residual CO2 saturations may be as high as 15–25% for 
many typical storage formations. Over time, much of the 
trapped CO2 dissolves in the formation water (Ennis-King and 
Figure 5.6  Simulated distribution of CO2 injected into a heterogeneous formation with low-permeability layers that block upward migration of 
CO2. (a) Illustration of a heterogeneous formation facies grid model. The location of the injection well is indicated by the vertical line in the lower 
portion of the grid. (b) The CO2 distribution after two years of injection. Note that the simulated distribution of CO2 is strongly influenced by the 
low-permeability layers that block and delay upward movement of CO2 (after Doughty and Pruess, 2004).

the temperature is 40°C. The injection rate is 1 MtCO2 yr-1 for 20 years, the horizontal permeability is 10 –13 m2 (approximately 100 mD) and the 
vertical permeability is one-tenth of that. The residual CO2 saturation is 20%. The first three parts of the figure at 2, 20 and 200 years, show the 
gas saturation in the porous medium; the second three parts of the figure at 200, 2000 and 4000 years, show the mass fraction of dissolved CO2 
in the aqueous phase (after Ennis-King and Paterson, 2003).

buoyancy-driven flow has expanded the volume affected by CO2 and much is trapped as residual CO2 saturation or dissolved in brine (not shown). 
Little CO2 is mobile and all CO2 is contained within the aquifer (after Kumar et al., 2005).

accelerate or modify solubility trapping (Keith et al., 2005). 
5.2.2 
CO2 storage mechanisms in geological formations
The effectiveness of geological storage depends on a 
combination of physical and geochemical trapping mechanisms 
(Figure 5.9). The most effective storage sites are those where 
CO2 is immobile because it is trapped permanently under a 
thick, low-permeability seal or is converted to solid minerals 
or is adsorbed on the surfaces of coal micropores or through a 
combination of physical and chemical trapping mechanisms.
5.2.2.1 
Physical trapping: stratigraphic and structural
Initially, physical trapping of CO2 below low-permeability seals 
(caprocks), such as very-low-permeability shale or salt beds, 
is the principal means to store CO2 in geological formations 
(Figure 5.3). In some high latitude areas, shallow gas hydrates 
may conceivably act as a seal. Sedimentary basins have such 
closed, physically bound traps or structures, which are occupied 
mainly by saline water, oil and gas. Structural traps include 
those formed by folded or fractured rocks. Faults can act as 
permeability barriers in some circumstances and as preferential 
pathways for fluid flow in other circumstances (Salvi et al., 2000). 
Stratigraphic traps are formed by changes in rock type caused 
by variation in the setting where the rocks were deposited. Both 
of these types of traps are suitable for CO2 storage, although, 
as discussed in Section 5.5, care must be taken not to exceed 
the allowable overpressure to avoid fracturing the caprock or 
re-activating faults (Streit et al., 2005). 
5.2.2.2 
Physical trapping: hydrodynamic
Hydrodynamic trapping can occur in saline formations that do 
not have a closed trap, but where fluids migrate very slowly 
over long distances. When CO2 is injected into a formation, it 
displaces saline formation water and then migrates buoyantly 
upwards, because it is less dense than the water. When it reaches 
the top of the formation, it continues to migrate as a separate 
phase until it is trapped as residual CO2 saturation or in local 
structural or stratigraphic traps within the sealing formation. 
In the longer term, significant quantities of CO2 dissolve in 
the formation water and then migrate with the groundwater. 
Where the distance from the deep injection site to the end of the 
overlying impermeable formation is hundreds of kilometres, 
the time scale for fluid to reach the surface from the deep basin 
can be millions of years (Bachu et al., 1994). 
5.2.2.3 
Geochemical trapping 
Carbon dioxide in the subsurface can undergo a sequence of 
geochemical interactions with the rock and formation water that 
will further increase storage capacity and effectiveness. First, 
when CO2 dissolves in formation water, a process commonly 
called solubility trapping occurs. The primary benefit of 
solubility trapping is that once CO2 is dissolved, it no longer 
exists as a separate phase, thereby eliminating the buoyant 
forces that drive it upwards. Next, it will form ionic species as 
the rock dissolves, accompanied by a rise in the pH. Finally, 
some fraction may be converted to stable carbonate minerals 
(mineral trapping), the most permanent form of geological 
storage (Gunter et al., 1993). Mineral trapping is believed to 
be comparatively slow, potentially taking a thousand years 
or longer. Nevertheless, the permanence of mineral storage, 
combined with the potentially large storage capacity present in 
some geological settings, makes this a desirable feature of long-
term storage.
Dissolution of CO2 in formation waters can be represented by 
the chemical reaction: 
CO2 (g) + H2O ↔ H2CO3 ↔ HCO3
– + H+ ↔ CO3
2– + 2H+
The CO2 solubility in formation water decreases as temperature 
and salinity increase. Dissolution is rapid when formation water 
and CO2 share the same pore space, but once the formation 
fluid is saturated with CO2, the rate slows and is controlled by 
diffusion and convection rates.
 
CO2 dissolved in water produces a weak acid, which reacts 
with the sodium and potassium basic silicate or calcium, 
magnesium and iron carbonate or silicate minerals in the 
reservoir or formation to form bicarbonate ions by chemical 
reactions approximating to: 
3 K-feldspar + 2H2O + 2CO2 ↔ Muscovite + 6 Quartz + 2K
+ 
+ 2HCO3
–
Figure 5.9  Storage security depends on a combination of physical and 
geochemical trapping. Over time, the physical process of residual CO2 
trapping and geochemical processes of solubility trapping and mineral 
trapping increase.
Chapter 5: Underground geological storage
209
Reaction of the dissolved CO2 with minerals can be rapid (days) 
in the case of some carbonate minerals, but slow (hundreds to 
thousands of years) in the case of silicate minerals. 
 
Formation of carbonate minerals occurs from continued 
reaction of the bicarbonate ions with calcium, magnesium 
and iron from silicate minerals such as clays, micas, chlorites 
and feldspars present in the rock matrix (Gunter et al., 1993, 
1997). 
 
Perkins et al. (2005) estimate that over 5000 years, all 
the CO2 injected into the Weyburn Oil Field will dissolve 
or be converted to carbonate minerals within the storage 
formation. Equally importantly, they show that the caprock and 
overlying rock formations have an even greater capacity for 
mineralization. This is significant for leakage risk assessment 
(Section 5.7) because once CO2 is dissolved, it is unavailable 
for leakage as a discrete phase. Modelling by Holtz (2002) 
suggests more than 60% of CO2 is trapped by residual CO2 
trapping by the end of the injection phase (100% after 1000 
years), although laboratory experiments (Section 5.2.1) suggest 
somewhat lower percentages. When CO2 is trapped at residual 
saturation, it is effectively immobile. However, should there be 
leakage through the caprock, then saturated brine may degas 
as it is depressurized, although, as illustrated in Figure 5.7 
the tendency of saturated brine is to sink rather than to rise. 
Reaction of the CO2 with formation water and rocks may result 
in reaction products that affect the porosity of the rock and the 
Box 5.4  Storage security mechanisms and changes over time.
When the CO2 is injected, it forms a bubble around the injection well, displacing the mobile water and oil both laterally 
and vertically within the injection horizon. The interactions between the water and CO2 phase allow geochemical trapping 
mechanisms to take effect. Over time, CO2 that is not immobilized by residual CO2 trapping can react with in situ fluid to form 
carbonic acid (i.e., H2CO3 called solubility trapping – dominates from tens to hundreds of years). Dissolved CO2 can eventually 
react with reservoir minerals if an appropriate mineralogy is encountered to form carbon-bearing ionic species (i.e., HCO3
– and 
CO3
2– called ionic trapping – dominates from hundreds to thousands of years). Further breakdown of these minerals could 
precipitate new carbonate minerals that would fix injected CO2 in its most secure state (i.e., mineral trapping – dominates over 
thousands to millions of years).
  
Four injection scenarios are shown in Figure 5.10. Scenarios A, B and C show injection into hydrodynamic traps, 
essentially systems open to lateral flow of fluids and gas within the injection horizon. Scenario D represents injection into a 
physically restricted flow regime, similar to those of many producing and depleted oil and gas reservoirs.
  
In Scenario A, the injected CO2 is never physically 
contained laterally. The CO2 plume migrates within the 
injection horizon and is ultimately consumed via all types 
of geochemical trapping mechanisms, including carbonate 
mineralization. Mineral and ionic trapping dominate. The 
proportions of CO2 stored in each geochemical trap will 
depend strongly on the in situ mineralogy, pore space 
structure and water composition. 
  
In Scenario B, the migration of the CO2 plume is 
similar to that of Scenario A, but the mineralogy and water 
chemistry are such that reaction of CO2 with minerals is 
minor and solubility trapping and hydrodynamic trapping 
dominate. 
  
In Scenario C, the CO2 is injected into a zone initially 
similar to Scenario B. However, during lateral migration the 
CO2 plume migrates into a zone of physical heterogeneity 
in the injection horizon. This zone may be characterized 
by variable porosity and permeability caused by a facies 
change. The facies change is accompanied by a more 
reactive mineralogy that causes an abrupt change in path. In 
the final state, ionic and mineral trapping predominate.
  
Scenario D illustrates CO2 injection into a well-
constrained flow zone but, similar to Scenario B, it does 
not have in-situ fluid chemistry and mineralogy suitable for 
ionic or mineral trapping. The bulk of the injected CO2 is 
trapped geochemically via solubility trapping and physically 
via stratigraphic or structural trapping.

flow of solution through the pores. This possibility has not, 
however, been observed experimentally and its possible effects 
cannot be quantified. 
 
Yet another type of fixation occurs when CO2 is preferentially 
adsorbed onto coal or organic-rich shales (Section 5.3.4). 
This has been observed in batch and column experiments in 
the laboratory, as well as in field experiments at the Fenn Big 
Valley, Canada and the San Juan Basin, USA (Box 5.7). A rather 
different form of fixation can occur when CO2 hydrate is formed 
in the deep ocean seafloor and onshore in permafrost regions 
(Koide et al., 1997). 
5.2.3 
Natural geological accumulations of CO2
Natural sources of CO2 occur, as gaseous accumulations of CO2, 
CO2 mixed with natural gas and CO2 dissolved in formation 
water (Figure 5.11). These natural accumulations have been 
studied in the United States, Australia and Europe (Pearce et 
al., 1996; Allis et al., 2001; Stevens et al., 2003; Watson et al., 
2004) as analogues for storage of CO2, as well as for leakage 
from engineered storage sites. Production of CO2 for EOR and 
other uses provides operational experience relevant to CO2 
capture and storage. There are, of course, differences between 
natural accumulations of CO2 and engineered CO2 storage sites: 
natural accumulations of CO2 collect over very long periods of 
time and at random sites, some of which might be naturally 
‘leaky’. At engineered sites, CO2 injection rates will be rapid 
and the sites will necessarily be penetrated by injection wells 
(Celia and Bachu, 2003; Johnson et al., 2005). Therefore, care 
must be taken to keep injection pressures low enough to avoid 
damaging the caprock (Section 5.5) and to make sure that the 
wells are properly sealed (Section 5.5). 
 
Natural accumulations of relatively pure CO2 are found all 
over the world in a range of geological settings, particularly 
in sedimentary basins, intra-plate volcanic regions (Figure 
5.11) and in faulted areas or in quiescent volcanic structures. 
Natural accumulations occur in a number of different types 
of sedimentary rocks, principally limestones, dolomites and 
sandstones and with a variety of seals (mudstone, shale, salt 
and anhydrite) and a range of trap types, reservoir depths and 
CO2-bearing phases. 
 
Carbon dioxide fields in the Colorado Plateau and Rocky 
Mountains, USA, are comparable to conventional natural gas 
reservoirs (Allis et al., 2001). Studies of three of these fields 
(McElmo Dome, St. Johns Field and Jackson Dome) have 
shown that each contains 1600 MtCO2, with measurable 
leakage (Stevens et al., 2001a). Two hundred Mt trapped in the 
Pisgah Anticline, northeast of the Jackson Dome, is thought to 
have been generated more than 65 million years ago (Studlick 
et al., 1990), with no evidence of leakage, providing additional 
Figuur 5.11
Figure 5.11  Examples of natural accumulations of CO2 around the world. Regions containing many occurrences are enclosed by a dashed 
line. Natural accumulations can be useful as analogues for certain aspects of storage and for assessing the environmental impacts of leakage.  
Data quality is variable and the apparent absence of accumulations in South America, southern Africa and central and northern Asia is probably 
more a reflection of lack of data than a lack of CO2 accumulations.

evidence of long-term trapping of CO2. Extensive studies have 
been undertaken on small-scale CO2 accumulations in the 
Otway Basin in Australia (Watson et al., 2004) and in France, 
Germany, Hungary and Greece (Pearce et al., 2003). 
 
Conversely, 
some 
systems, 
typically 
spas 
and 
volcanic systems, are leaky and not useful analogues for 
geological storage. The Kileaua Volcano emits on average  
4 MtCO2 yr-1. More than 1200 tCO2 day–1 (438,000 tCO2 yr-1) 
leaked into the Mammoth Mountain area, California, between 
1990 and 1995, with flux variations linked to seismicity (USGS, 
2001b). Average flux densities of 80–160 tCO2 m–2 yr–1 are 
observed near Matraderecske, Hungary, but along faults, the 
flux density can reach approximately 6600 t m–2 yr–1 (Pearce et 
al., 2003). These high seepage rates result from release of CO2 
from faulted volcanic systems, whereas a normal baseline CO2 
flux is of the order of 10–100 gCO2 m–2 day–1 under temperate 
climate conditions (Pizzino et al., 2002). Seepage of CO2 into 
Lake Nyos (Cameroon) resulted in CO2 saturation of water 
deep in the lake, which in 1987 produced a very large-scale and 
(for more than 1700 persons) ultimately fatal release of CO2 
when the lake overturned (Kling et al., 1987). The overturn of 
Lake Nyos (a deep, stratified tropical lake) and release of CO2 
are not representative of the seepage through wells or fractures 
that may occur from underground geological storage sites. 
Engineered CO2 storage sites will be chosen to minimize the 
prospect of leakage. Natural storage and events such as Lake 
Nyos are not representative of geological storage for predicting 
seepage from engineered sites, but can be useful for studying 
the health, safety and environmental effects of CO2 leakage 
(Section 5.7.4).
 
Carbon dioxide is found in some oil and gas fields as a 
separate gas phase or dissolved in oil. This type of storage is 
relatively common in Southeast Asia, China and Australia, 
less common in other oil and gas provinces such as in Algeria, 
Russia, the Paradox Basin (USA) and the Alberta Basin (western 
Canada). In the North Sea and Barents Sea, a few fields have 
up to 10% CO2, including Sleipner and Snohvit (Figure 5.11). 
The La Barge natural gas field in Wyoming, USA, has 3300 Mt 
of gas reserves, with an average of 65% CO2 by volume. In the 
Appennine region of Italy, many deep wells (1–3 km depth) 
have trapped gas containing 90% or more CO2 by volume. Major 
CO2 accumulations around the South China Sea include the 
world’s largest known CO2 accumulation, the Natuna D Alpha 
field in Indonesia, with more than 9100 MtCO2 (720 Mt natural 
gas). Concentrations of CO2 can be highly variable between 
different fields in a basin and between different reservoir zones 
within the same field, reflecting complex generation, migration 
and mixing processes. In Australia’s Otway Basin, the timing 
of CO2 input and trapping ranges from 5000 years to a million 
years (Watson et al., 2004).

Underground natural gas storage projects that offer experience 
relevant to CO2 storage (Lippmann and Benson, 2003; Perry, 
2005) have operated successfully for almost 100 years and in 
many parts of the world (Figure 5.12). These projects provide for 
peak loads and balance seasonal fluctuations in gas supply and 
demand. The Berlin Natural Gas Storage Project is an example 
of this (Box 5.5). The majority of gas storage projects are in 
depleted oil and gas reservoirs and saline formations, although 
caverns in salt have also been used extensively. A number of 
factors are critical to the success of these projects, including 
a suitable and adequately characterized site (permeability, 
thickness and extent of storage reservoir, tightness of caprock, 
geological structure, lithology, etc.). Injection wells must be 
properly designed, installed, monitored and maintained and 
abandoned wells in and near the project must be located and 
plugged. Finally, taking into account a range of solubility, 
density and trapping conditions, overpressuring the storage 
reservoir (injecting gas at a pressure that is well in excess of the 
in situ formation pressure) must be avoided. 
 
While underground natural gas storage is safe and effective, 
some projects have leaked, mostly caused by poorly completed 
or improperly plugged and abandoned wells and by leaky faults 
(Gurevich et al., 1993; Lippmann and Benson, 2003; Perry, 
2005). Abandoned oil and gas fields are easier to assess as 
natural gas storage sites than are saline formations, because the 
geological structure and caprock are usually well characterized 
from existing wells. At most natural gas storage sites, monitoring 
requirements focus on ensuring that the injection well is not 
leaking (by the use of pressure measurements and through in 
situ downhole measurements of temperature, pressure, noise/
sonic, casing conditions, etc.). Observation wells are sometimes 
used to verify that gas has not leaked into shallower strata.

5.2.4.2 
Acid gas injection
Acid gas injection operations represent a commercial analogue 
for some aspects of geological CO2 storage. Acid gas is a 
mixture of H2S and CO2, with minor amounts of hydrocarbon 
gases that can result from petroleum production or processing. 
In Western Canada, operators are increasingly turning to acid 
gas disposal by injection into deep geological formations. 
Although the purpose of the acid gas injection operations is to 
dispose of H2S, significant quantities of CO2 are injected at the 
same time because it is uneconomic to separate the two gases. 
 
Currently, regulatory agencies in Western Canada approve 
the maximum H2S fraction, maximum wellhead injection 
pressure and rate and maximum injection volume. Acid gas is 
currently injected into 51 different formations at 44 different 
locations across the Alberta Basin in the provinces of Alberta 
and British Columbia (Figure 5.13). Carbon dioxide often 
represents the largest component of the injected acid gas 
stream, in many cases, 14–98% of the total volume. A total of 
2.5 MtCO2 and 2 MtH2S had been injected in Western Canada 
by the end of 2003, at rates of 840–500,720 m3 day–1 per site, 
with an aggregate injection rate in 2003 of 0.45 MtCO2 yr-1 and 
0.55 MtH2S yr-1, with no detectable leakage. 
 
Acid gas injection in Western Canada occurs over a wide 
range of formation and reservoir types, acid gas compositions 
and operating conditions. Injection takes place in deep saline 
formations at 27 sites, into depleted oil and/or gas reservoirs at 
19 sites and into the underlying water leg of depleted oil and gas 
reservoirs at 4 sites. Carbonates form the reservoir at 29 sites 
and quartz-rich sandstones dominate at the remaining 21 (Figure 
5.13). In most cases, shale constitutes the overlying confining 
unit (caprock), with the remainder of the injection zones being 
confined by tight limestones, evaporites and anhydrites. 
 
Since the first acid-gas injection operation in 1990, 51 
different injection sites have been approved, of which 44 are 
currently active. One operation was not implemented, three were 
rescinded after a period of operation (either because injection 
volumes reached the approved limit or because the gas plant 
producing the acid gas was decommissioned) and three sites 
were suspended by the regulatory agency because of reservoir 
overpressuring.
5.2.4.3 
Liquid waste injection
In many parts of the world, large volumes of liquid waste are 
injected into the deep subsurface every day. For example, for 
the past 60 years, approximately 9 billion gallons (34.1 million 
m3) of hazardous waste is injected into saline formations in the 
United States from about 500 wells each year. In addition, more 
than 750 billion gallons (2843 million m3) of oil field brines 
are injected from 150,000 wells each year. This combined 
annual US injectate volume of about 3000 million m3, when 
converted to volume equivalent, corresponds to the volume 
of approximately 2 GtCO2 at a depth of 1 km. Therefore, the 
experience gained from existing deep-fluid-injection projects is 
relevant in terms of the style of operation and is of a similar 
magnitude to that which may be required for geological storage 
of CO2. 
5.2.5 
Security and duration of CO2 storage in geological 
formations
Evidence from oil and gas fields indicates that hydrocarbons 
and other gases and fluids including CO2 can remain trapped 
for millions of years (Magoon and Dow, 1994; Bradshaw et 
al., 2005). Carbon dioxide has a tendency to remain in the 
subsurface (relative to hydrocarbons) via its many physico-
chemical immobilization mechanisms. World-class petroleum 
provinces have storage times for oil and gas of 5–100 million 
years, others for 350 million years, while some minor petroleum 
Box 5.5  The Berlin Natural Gas Storage Facility.
The Berlin Natural Gas Storage Facility is located in central Berlin, Germany, in an area that combines high population density 
with nature and water conservation reservations. This facility, with a capacity of 1085 million m³, was originally designed to 
be a reserve natural gas storage unit for limited seasonal quantity equalization. A storage production rate of 450,000 m³ h–1 can 
be achieved with the existing storage wells and surface facilities. Although the geological and engineering aspects and scale 
of the facility make it a useful analogue for a small CO2 storage project, this project is more complex because the input and 
output for natural gas is highly variable, depending on consumer demand. The risk profiles are also different, considering the 
highly flammable and explosive nature of natural gas and conversely the reactive nature of CO2. 
  
The facility lies to the east of the North German Basin, which is part of a complex of basin structures extending from 
The Netherlands to Poland. The sandstone storage horizons are at approximately 800 m below sea level. The gas storage layers 
are covered with layers of claystone, anhydrite and halite, approximately 200 m thick. This site has complicated tectonics and 
heterogeneous reservoir lithologies. 
  
Twelve wells drilled at three sites are available for natural gas storage operation. The varying storage sand types also 
require different methods of completion of the wells. The wells also have major differences in their production behaviour. The 
wellheads of the storage wells and of the water disposal wells are housed in 5 m deep cellars covered with concrete plates, 
with special steel covers over the wellheads to allow for wireline logging. Because of the urban location, a total of 16 deviated 
storage wells and water disposal wells were concentrated at four sites. Facilities containing substances that could endanger 
water are set up within fluid-tight concrete enclosures and/or have their own watertight concrete enclosures.

accumulations have been stored for up to 1400 million years. 
However, some natural traps do leak, which reinforces the need 
for careful site selection (Section 5.3), characterization (Section 
5.4) and injection practices (Section 5.5). 
5.3 
 Storage formations, capacity and geographical 
distribution
In this section, the following issues are addressed: In what 
types of geological formations can CO2 be stored? Are such 
formations widespread? How much CO2 can be geologically 
stored? 
5.3.1 
General site-selection criteria
There are many sedimentary regions in the world (Figures 2.4–
2.6 and Figure 5.14) variously suited for CO2 storage. In general, 
geological storage sites should have (1) adequate capacity and 
injectivity, (2) a satisfactory sealing caprock or confining unit 
and (3) a sufficiently stable geological environment to avoid 
compromising the integrity of the storage site. Criteria for 
assessing basin suitability (Bachu, 2000, 2003; Bradshaw et al., 
2002) include: basin characteristics (tectonic activity, sediment 
type, geothermal and hydrodynamic regimes); basin resources 
(hydrocarbons, coal, salt), industry maturity and infrastructure; 
and societal issues such as level of development, economy, 
environmental concerns, public education and attitudes. 
 
The suitability of sedimentary basins for CO2 storage 
depends in part on their location on the continental plate. Basins 
formed in mid-continent locations or near the edge of stable 
continental plates, are excellent targets for long-term CO2 
storage because of their stability and structure. Such basins are 
found within most continents and around the Atlantic, Arctic 
and Indian Oceans. The storage potential of basins found behind 
mountains formed by plate collision is likely to be good and 
these include the Rocky Mountain, Appalachian and Andean 
basins in the Americas, European basins immediately north of 
the Alps and Carpathians and west of the Urals and those located 
south of the Zagros and Himalayas in Asia. Basins located in 
tectonically active areas, such as those around the Pacific Ocean 
or the northern Mediterranean, may be less suitable for CO2 
storage and sites in these regions must be selected carefully 
because of the potential for CO2 leakage (Chiodini et al., 2001; 
Granieri et al., 2003). Basins located on the edges of plates

by rock type (from Bachu and Haug, 2005).
214
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
where subduction is occurring or between active mountain 
ranges, are likely to be strongly folded and faulted and provide 
less certainty for storage. However, basins must be assessed on 
an individual basis. For example, the Los Angeles Basin and 
Sacramento Valley in California, where significant hydrocarbon 
accumulations have been found, have demonstrated good 
local storage capacity. Poor CO2 storage potential is likely to 
be exhibited by basins that (1) are thin (≤1000 m), (2) have 
poor reservoir and seal relationships, (3) are highly faulted and 
fractured, (4) are within fold belts, (5) have strongly discordant 
sequences, (6) have undergone significant diagenesis or (7) 
have overpressured reservoirs. 
 
The efficiency of CO2 storage in geological media, defined 
as the amount of CO2 stored per unit volume (Brennan 
and Burruss, 2003), increases with increasing CO2 density. 
Storage safety also increases with increasing density, because 
buoyancy, which drives upward migration, is stronger for a 
lighter fluid. Density increases significantly with depth while 
CO2 is in gaseous phase, increases only slightly or levels off 
after passing from the gaseous phase into the dense phase and 
may even decrease with a further increase in depth, depending 
on the temperature gradient (Ennis-King and Paterson, 2001; 
Bachu, 2003). ‘Cold’ sedimentary basins, characterized by low 
temperature gradients, are more favourable for CO2 storage 
(Bachu, 2003) because CO2 attains higher density at shallower 
depths (700–1000 m) than in ‘warm’ sedimentary basins, 
characterized by high temperature gradients where dense-fluid 
conditions are reached at greater depths (1000–1500 m). The 
depth of the storage formation (leading to increased drilling and 
compression costs for deeper formations) may also influence 
the selection of storage sites.
 
Adequate porosity and thickness (for storage capacity) 
and permeability (for injectivity) are critical; porosity usually 
decreases with depth because of compaction and cementation, 
which reduces storage capacity and efficiency. The storage 
formation should be capped by extensive confining units (such 
as shale, salt or anhydrite beds) to ensure that CO2 does not 
escape into overlying, shallower rock units and ultimately to the 
surface. Extensively faulted and fractured sedimentary basins 
or parts thereof, particularly in seismically active areas, require 
Figuur 5.14
Figure 5.14  Distribution of sedimentary basins around the world (after Bradshaw and Dance, 2005; and USGS, 2001a). In general, sedimentary 
basins are likely to be the most prospective areas for storage sites. However, storage sites may also be found in some areas of fold belts and in 
some of the highs. Shield areas constitute regions with low prospectivity for storage. The Mercator projection used here is to provide comparison 
with Figures 5.1, 5.11 and 5.27. The apparent dimensions of the sedimentary basins, particularly in the northern hemisphere, should not be taken 
as an indication of their likely storage capacity.

careful characterization to be good candidates for CO2 storage, 
unless the faults and fractures are sealed and CO2 injection will 
not open them (Holloway, 1997; Zarlenga et al., 2004). 
 
The pressure and flow regimes of formation waters in a 
sedimentary basin are important factors in selecting sites for CO2 
storage (Bachu et al., 1994). Injection of CO2 into formations 
overpressured by compaction and/or hydrocarbon generation 
may raise technological and safety issues that make them 
unsuitable. Underpressured formations in basins located mid-
continent, near the edge of stable continental plates or behind 
mountains formed by plate collision may be well suited for CO2 
storage. Storage of CO2 in deep saline formations with fluids 
having long residence times (millions of years) is conducive to 
hydrodynamic and mineral trapping (Section 5.2).
 
The possible presence of fossil fuels and the exploration 
and production maturity of a basin are additional considerations 
for selection of storage sites (Bachu, 2000). Basins with little 
exploration for hydrocarbons may be uncertain targets for CO2 
storage because of limited availability of geological information 
or potential for contamination of as-yet-undiscovered 
hydrocarbon resources. Mature sedimentary basins may be 
prime targets for CO2 storage because: (1) they have well-known 
characteristics; (2) hydrocarbon pools and/or coal beds have 
been discovered and produced; (3) some petroleum reservoirs 
might be already depleted, nearing depletion or abandoned as 
uneconomic; (4) the infrastructure needed for CO2 transport 
and injection may already be in place. The presence of wells 
penetrating the subsurface in mature sedimentary basins can 
create potential CO2 leakage pathways that may compromise the 
security of a storage site (Celia and Bachu, 2003). Nevertheless, 
at Weyburn, despite the presence of many hundreds of existing 
wells, after four years of CO2 injection there has been no 
measurable leakage (Strutt et al., 2003). 
5.3.2 
Oil and gas fields
5.3.2.1�
Abandoned�oil�and�gas�fields�
Depleted oil and gas reservoirs are prime candidates for CO2 
storage for several reasons. First, the oil and gas that originally 
accumulated in traps (structural and stratigraphic) did not escape 
(in some cases for many millions of years), demonstrating their 
integrity and safety. Second, the geological structure and physical 
properties of most oil and gas fields have been extensively 
studied and characterized. Third, computer models have been 
developed in the oil and gas industry to predict the movement, 
displacement behaviour and trapping of hydrocarbons. Finally, 
some of the infrastructure and wells already in place may be 
used for handling CO2 storage operations. Depleted fields will 
not be adversely affected by CO2 (having already contained 
hydrocarbons) and if hydrocarbon fields are still in production, 
a CO2 storage scheme can be optimized to enhance oil (or gas) 
production. However, plugging of abandoned wells in many 
mature fields began many decades ago when wells were simply 
filled with a mud-laden fluid. Subsequently, cement plugs were 
required to be strategically placed within the wellbore, but not 
with any consideration that they may one day be relied upon to 
contain a reactive and potentially buoyant fluid such as CO2. 
Therefore, the condition of wells penetrating the caprock must 
be assessed (Winter and Bergman, 1993). In many cases, even 
locating the wells may be difficult and caprock integrity may 
need to be confirmed by pressure and tracer monitoring. 
 
The capacity of a reservoir will be limited by the need to 
avoid exceeding pressures that damage the caprock (Section 
5.5.3). Reservoirs should have limited sensitivity to reductions 
in permeability caused by plugging of the near-injector region 
and by reservoir stress fluctuations (Kovscek, 2002; Bossie-
Codreanu et al., 2003). Storage in reservoirs at depths less than 
approximately 800 m may be technically and economically 
feasible, but the low storage capacity of shallow reservoirs, 
where CO2 may be in the gas phase, could be problematic. 
5.3.2.2 
Enhanced oil recovery
Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) through CO2 flooding (by 
injection) offers potential economic gain from incremental 
oil production. Of the original oil in place, 5–40% is usually 
recovered by conventional primary production (Holt et al., 
1995). An additional 10–20% of oil in place is produced by 
secondary recovery that uses water flooding (Bondor, 1992). 
Various miscible agents, among them CO2, have been used for 
enhanced (tertiary) oil recovery or EOR, with an incremental 
oil recovery of 7–23% (average 13.2%) of the original oil in 
place (Martin and Taber, 1992; Moritis, 2003). Descriptions of 
CO2-EOR projects are provided in Box 5.3 and Box 5.6, and an 
illustration is given in Figure 5.15.
 
Many CO2 injection schemes have been suggested, 
including continuous CO2 injection or alternate water and CO2 
gas injection (Klins and Farouq Ali, 1982; Klins, 1984). Oil 
displacement by CO2 injection relies on the phase behaviour 
of CO2 and crude oil mixtures that are strongly dependent on 
reservoir temperature, pressure and crude oil composition. These 
mechanisms range from oil swelling and viscosity reduction for 
injection of immiscible fluids (at low pressures) to completely 
miscible displacement in high-pressure applications. In these 
applications, more than 50% and up to 67% of the injected 
CO2 returns with the produced oil (Bondor, 1992) and is 
usually separated and re-injected into the reservoir to minimize 
operating costs. The remainder is trapped in the oil reservoir by 
various means, such as irreducible saturation and dissolution in 
reservoir oil that it is not produced and in pore space that is not 
connected to the flow path for the producing wells. 
 
For enhanced CO2 storage in EOR operations, oil reservoirs 
may need to meet additional criteria (Klins, 1984; Taber et 
al., 1997; Kovscek, 2002; Shaw and Bachu, 2002). Generally, 
reservoir depth must be more than 600 m. Injection of immiscible 
fluids must often suffice for heavy- to-medium-gravity oils (oil 
gravity 12–25 API). The more desirable miscible flooding is 
applicable to light, low-viscosity oils (oil gravity 25–48 API). 
For miscible floods, the reservoir pressure must be higher than 
the minimum miscibility pressure (10–15 MPa) needed for 
achieving miscibility between reservoir oil and CO2, depending 
on oil composition and gravity, reservoir temperature and CO2 
purity (Metcalfe, 1982). To achieve effective removal of the 
216
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
oil, other preferred criteria for both types of flooding include 
relatively thin reservoirs (less than 20 m), high reservoir angle, 
homogenous formation and low vertical permeability. For 
horizontal reservoirs, the absence of natural water flow, major 
gas cap and major natural fractures are preferred. Reservoir 
thickness and permeability are not critical factors.
 
Reservoir heterogeneity also affects CO2 storage efficiency. 
The density difference between the lighter CO2 and the reservoir 
oil and water leads to movement of the CO2 along the top of the 
reservoir, particularly if the reservoir is relatively homogeneous 
and has high permeability, negatively affecting the CO2 storage 
and oil recovery. Consequently, reservoir heterogeneity may 
have a positive effect, slowing down the rise of CO2 to the top 
of the reservoir and forcing it to spread laterally, giving more 
complete invasion of the formation and greater storage potential 
(Bondor, 1992; Kovscek, 2002; Flett et al., 2005).
5.3.2.3 
Enhanced gas recovery 
Although up to 95% of original gas in place can be produced, 
CO2 could potentially be injected into depleted gas reservoirs to 
enhance gas recovery by repressurizing the reservoir (van der 
Burgt et al., 1992; Koide and Yamazaki, 2001; Oldenburg et 
al., 2001). Enhanced gas recovery has so far been implemented 
only at pilot scale (Gaz de France K12B project, Netherlands, 
Box 5.6  The Rangely, Colorado, CO2-EOR Project.
The Rangely CO2-EOR Project is located in Colorado, USA and is operated by Chevron. The CO2 is purchased from the 
Exxon-Mobil LaBarge natural gas processing facility in Wyoming and transported 283 km via pipeline to the Rangely field. 
Additional spurs carry CO2 over 400 km from LaBarge to Lost Soldier and Wertz fields in central Wyoming, currently ending 
at the Salt Creek field in eastern Wyoming. 
   
The sandstone reservoir of the Rangely field has been CO2 flooded, by the water alternating gas (WAG) process, since 
1986. Primary and secondary recovery, carried out between 1944 and 1986, recovered 1.9 US billion barrels (302 million m3) 
of oil (21% of the original oil in place). With use of CO2 floods, ultimate tertiary recovery of a further 129 million barrels (21 
million m3) of oil (6.8% of original oil in place) is expected. Average daily CO2 injection in 2003 was equivalent to 2.97 MtCO2 
yr-1, with production of 13,913 barrels oil per day. Of the total 2.97 Mt injected, recycled gas comprised around 2.29 Mt and 
purchased gas about 0.74 Mt. Cumulative CO2 stored to date is estimated at 22.2 Mt. A simplified flow diagram for the Rangely 
field is given in Figure 5.15. 
   
The Rangely field, covering an area of 78 km2, is an asymmetric anticline. A major northeast-to-southwest fault in 
the eastern half of the field and other faults and fractures significantly influence fluid movement within the reservoir. The 
sandstone reservoirs have an average gross and effective thickness of 160 m and 40 m, respectively and are comprised of six 
persistent producing sandstone horizons (depths of 1675–1980 m) with average porosity of 12%. Permeability averages 10 mD 
(Hefner and Barrow, 1992). 
   
By the end of 2003, there were 248 active injectors, of which 160 are used for CO2 injection and 348 active producers. 
Produced gas is processed through two parallel single-column natural-gas-liquids recovery facilities and subsequently 
compressed to approximately 14.5 MPa. Compressed-produced gas (recycled gas) is combined with purchased CO2 for 
reinjection mostly by the WAG process. 
   
Carbon dioxide-EOR operation in the field maintains compliance with government regulations for production, injection, 
protection of potable water formations, surface use, flaring and venting. A number of protocols have been instituted to ensure 
containment of CO2 – for example, pre-injection well-integrity verification, a radioactive tracer survey run on the first injection, 
injection-profile tracer surveys, mechanical integrity tests, soil gas surveys and round-the-clock field monitoring. Surface 
release from the storage reservoir is below the detection limit of 170 t yr–1 or an annual leakage rate of less than 0.00076% of 
the total stored CO2 (Klusman, 2003). Methane leakage is estimated to be 400 t yr–1, possibly due to increased CO2 injection 
pressure above original reservoir pressure. The water chemistry portion of the study indicates that the injected CO2 is dissolving 
in the water and may be responsible for dissolution of ferroan calcite and dolomite. There is currently no evidence of mineral 
precipitation that may result in mineral storage of CO2.

Table 5.1) and some authors have suggested that CO2 injection 
might result in lower gas recovery factors, particularly for very 
heterogeneous fields (Clemens and Wit, 2002). 
5.3.3 
Saline formations
Saline formations are deep sedimentary rocks saturated with 
formation waters or brines containing high concentrations of 
dissolved salts. These formations are widespread and contain 
enormous quantities of water, but are unsuitable for agriculture 
or human consumption. Saline brines are used locally by the 
chemical industry and formation waters of varying salinity are 
used in health spas and for producing low-enthalpy geothermal 
energy. Because the use of geothermal energy is likely to 
increase, potential geothermal areas may not be suitable for CO2 
storage. It has been suggested that combined geological storage 
and geothermal energy may be feasible, but regions with good 
geothermal energy potential are generally less favourable for 
CO2 geological storage because of the high degree of faulting 
and fracturing and the sharp increase of temperature with depth. 
In very arid regions, deep saline formations may be considered 
for future water desalinization. 
 
The Sleipner Project in the North Sea is the best available 
example of a CO2 storage project in a saline formation (Box 5.1). 
It was the first commercial-scale project dedicated to geological 
CO2 storage. Approximately 1 MtCO2 is removed annually from 
the produced natural gas and injected underground at Sleipner. 
The operation started in October 1996 and over the lifetime 
of the project a total of 20 MtCO2 is expected to be stored. A 
simplified diagram of the Sleipner scheme is given in Figure 
5.4.
 
The CO2 is injected into poorly cemented sands about 800–
1000 m below the sea floor. The sandstone contains secondary 
thin shale or clay layers, which influence the internal movement 
of injected CO2. The overlying primary seal is an extensive 
thick shale or clay layer. The saline formation into which CO2 
is injected has a very large storage capacity. 
 
The fate and transport of the Sleipner CO2 plume has been 
successfully monitored (Figure 5.16) by seismic time-lapse 
surveys (Section 5.6). These surveys have helped improve 
the conceptual model for the fate and transport of stored CO2. 
The vertical cross-section of the plume shown in Figure 5.16 
indicates both the upward migration of CO2 (due to buoyancy 
forces) and the role of lower permeability strata within the 
formation, diverting some of the CO2 laterally, thus spreading 
out the plume over a larger area. The survey also shows that the 
caprock prevents migration out of the storage formation. The 
seismic data shown in Figure 5.16 illustrate the gradual growth of 
the plume. Today, the footprint of the plume at Sleipner extends 
over approximately 5 km2. Reservoir studies and simulations 
(Section 5.4.2) have shown that the CO2-saturated brine will 
eventually become denser and sink, eliminating the potential 
for long-term leakage (Lindeberg and Bergmo, 2003).
5.3.4 
Coal seams
Coal contains fractures (cleats) that impart some permeability 
to the system. Between cleats, solid coal has a very large 
number of micropores into which gas molecules from the cleats 
can diffuse and be tightly adsorbed. Coal can physically adsorb 
many gases and may contain up to 25  normal m3 (m3 at 1 atm 
and 0°C) methane per tonne of coal at coal seam pressures. It has 
a higher affinity to adsorb gaseous CO2 than methane (Figure 
5.17). The volumetric ratio of adsorbable CO2:CH4 ranges from 
as low as one for mature coals such as anthracite, to ten or 
more for younger, immature coals such as lignite. Gaseous CO2 
injected through wells will flow through the cleat system of the 
coal, diffuse into the coal matrix and be adsorbed onto the coal 
micropore surfaces, freeing up gases with lower affinity to coal 
(i.e., methane). 
 
The process of CO2 trapping in coals for temperatures 
and pressures above the critical point is not well understood 
(Larsen, 2003). It seems that adsorption is gradually replaced by 
absorption and the CO2 diffuses or ‘dissolves’ in coal. Carbon 
dioxide is a ‘plasticizer’ for coal, lowering the temperature 
required to cause the transition from a glassy, brittle structure 
to a rubbery, plastic structure (coal softening). In one case, the 
transition temperature was interpreted to drop from about 400ºC 
at 3 MPa to <30ºC at 5.5 MPa CO2 pressure (Larsen, 2003). The 
transition temperature is dependent on the maturity of the coal, 
the maceral content, the ash content and the confining stress 
and is not easily extrapolated to the field. Coal plasticization 
or softening, may adversely affect the permeability that 
would allow CO2 injection. Furthermore, coal swells as CO2 
is adsorbed and/or absorbed, which reduces permeability and 
injectivity by orders of magnitude or more (Shi and Durucan, 
2005) and which may be counteracted by increasing the injection 
pressures (Clarkson and Bustin, 1997; Palmer and Mansoori, 
1998; Krooss et al., 2002; Larsen, 2003). Some studies suggest 
that the injected CO2 may react with coal (Zhang et al., 1993), 
further highlighting the difficulty in injecting CO2 into low-
permeability coal. 
 
If CO2 is injected into coal seams, it can displace methane, 
thereby enhancing CBM recovery. Carbon dioxide has been 
injected successfully at the Allison Project (Box 5.7) and in the 
Alberta Basin, Canada (Gunter et al., 2005), at depths greater 
than that corresponding to the CO2 critical point. Carbon dioxide-
ECBM has the potential to increase the amount of produced 
methane to nearly 90% of the gas, compared to conventional 
recovery of only 50% by reservoir-pressure depletion alone 
(Stevens et al., 1996). 
 
Coal permeability is one of several determining factors in 
selection of a storage site. Coal permeability varies widely and 
generally decreases with increasing depth as a result of cleat 
closure with increasing effective stress. Most CBM-producing 
wells in the world are less than 1000 m deep.

IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
Original screening criteria proposed in selecting favourable 
areas for CO2 ECBM (IEA-GHG, 1998) include: 
•� �Adequate permeability (minimum values have not yet been 
determined); 
•� �Suitable coal geometry (a few, thick seams rather than 
multiple, thin seams);
•� Simple structure (minimal faulting and folding);
•� �Homogeneous and confined coal seam(s) that are laterally 
continuous and vertically isolated; 
•� �Adequate depth (down to 1500 m, greater depths have not 
yet been studied); 
•� �Suitable gas saturation conditions (high gas saturation for 
ECBM);
•� Ability to dewater the formation. 
However, more recent studies have indicated that coal rank may 
play a more significant role than previously thought, owing to 
the dependence on coal rank of the relative adsorptive capacities

of methane and CO2 (Reeves et al., 2004). 
 
If the coal is never mined or depressurized, it is likely CO2 
will be stored for geological time, but, as with any geological 
storage option, disturbance of the formation could void any 
storage. The likely future fate of a coal seam is, therefore, a 
key determinant of its suitability for storage and in storage site 
selection and conflicts between mining and CO2 storage are 
possible, particularly for shallow coals.
5.3.5 
Other geological media
Other geological media and/or structures – including basalts, oil 
or gas shale, salt caverns and abandoned mines – may locally 
provide niche options for geological storage of CO2. 
5.3.5.1 
Basalts
Flows and layered intrusions of basalt occur globally, with large 
volumes present around the world (McGrail et al., 2003). Basalt 
commonly has low porosity, low permeability and low pore 
space continuity and any permeability is generally associated 
with fractures through which CO2 will leak unless there is a 
suitable caprock. Nonetheless, basalt may have some potential 
for mineral trapping of CO2, because injected CO2 may react 
with silicates in the basalt to form carbonate minerals (McGrail 
et al., 2003). More research is needed, but in general, basalts 
appear unlikely to be suitable for CO2 storage. 
5.3.5.2 
Oil or gas rich shale
Deposits of oil or gas shale or organic-rich shale, occur in many 
parts of the world. The trapping mechanism for oil shale is 
similar to that for coal beds, namely CO2 adsorption onto organic 
material. Carbon dioxide-enhanced shale-gas production (like 
ECBM) has the potential to reduce storage costs. The potential 
for storage of CO2 in oil or gas shale is currently unknown, but 
the large volumes of shale suggest that storage capacity may be 
significant. If site-selection criteria, such as minimum depth, are 
developed and applied to these shales, then volumes could be 
limited, but the very low permeability of these shales is likely 
to preclude injection of large volumes of CO2.
Box 5.7  The Allison Unit CO2-ECBM Pilot.
The Allison Unit CO2-ECBM Recovery Pilot Project, located in the northern New Mexico portion of the San Juan Basin, 
USA, is owned and operated by Burlington Resources. Production from the Allison field began in July 1989 and CO2 injection 
operations for ECBM recovery commenced in April 1995. Carbon dioxide injection was suspended in August 2001 to evaluate 
the results of the pilot. Since this pilot was undertaken purely for the purposes of ECBM production, no CO2 monitoring 
programme was implemented. 
   
The CO2 was sourced from the McElmo Dome in Colorado and delivered to the site through a (then) Shell (now Kinder-
Morgan) CO2 pipeline. The Allison Unit has a CBM resource of 242 million m3 km–2. A total of 181 million m3 (6.4 Bcf) of 
natural CO2 was injected into the reservoir over six years, of which 45 million m3 (1.6 Bcf) is forecast to be ultimately produced 
back, resulting in a net storage volume of 277,000 tCO2. The pilot consists of 16 methane production wells, 4 CO2 injection 
wells and 1 pressure observation well. The injection operations were undertaken at constant surface injection pressures on the 
order of 10.4 MPa. 
   
The wells were completed in the Fruitland coal, which is capped by shale. The reservoir has a thickness of 13 m, is 
located at a depth of 950 m and had an original reservoir pressure of 11.5 MPa. In a study conducted under the Coal-Seq Project 
performed for the US Department of Energy (www.coal-seq.com), a detailed reservoir characterization and modelling of the 
pilot was developed with the COMET2 reservoir simulator and future field performance was forecast under various operating 
conditions. 
   
This study provides evidence of significant coal-permeability reduction with CO2 injection. This permeability reduction 
resulted in a two-fold reduction in injectivity. This effect compromised incremental methane recovery and project economics. 
Finding ways to overcome and/or prevent this effect is therefore an important topic for future research. The injection of CO2 
at the Allison Unit has resulted in an increase in methane recovery from an estimated 77% of original gas in place to 95% of 
the original gas in place within the project area. The recovery of methane was in a proportion of approximately one volume of 
methane for every three volumes of CO2 injected (Reeves et al., 2004). 
   
An economic analysis of the pilot indicated a net present value of negative US$ 627,000, assuming a discount rate 
of 12% and an initial capital expenditure of US$ 2.6 million, but not including the beneficial impact of any tax credits for 
production from non-conventional reservoirs. This was based on a gas price of 2.09 US$ GJ-1 (2.20 US$/MMbtu) (at the time) 
and a CO2 price of 5.19 US$ t–1 (0.30 US$/Mcf). The results of the financial analysis will change, depending on the cost of oil 
and gas (the analysis indicated that the pilot would have yielded a positive net present value of US$2.6 million at today’s gas 
prices) and the cost of CO2. It was also estimated that if injectivity had been improved by a factor of four (but still using 2.09 
US$ GJ-1 (2.20 US$/MMbtu)), the net present value would have increased to US$ 3.6 million. Increased injectivity and today’s 
gas prices combined would have yielded a net present value for the pilot of US$ 15 million or a profit of 34 US$/tCO2 retained 
in the reservoir (Reeves et al., 2003).

5.3.5.3 
Salt caverns
Storage of CO2 in salt caverns created by solution mining could 
use the technology developed for the storage of liquid natural 
gas and petroleum products in salt beds and domes in Western 
Canada and the Gulf of Mexico (Dusseault et al., 2004). A single 
salt cavern can reach more than 500,000 m3. Storage of CO2 in 
salt caverns differs from natural gas and compressed air storage 
because in the latter case, the caverns are cyclically pressurized 
and depressurized on a daily-to-annual time scale, whereas 
CO2 storage must be effective on a centuries-to-millennia time 
scale. Owing to the creep properties of salt, a cavern filled with 
supercritical CO2 will decrease in volume, until the pressure 
inside the cavern equalizes the external stress in the salt bed 
(Bachu and Dusseault, 2005). Although a single cavern 100 m 
in diameter may hold only about 0.5 Mt of high density CO2, 
arrays of caverns could be built for large-scale storage. Cavern 
sealing is important in preventing leakage and collapse of cavern 
roofs, which could release large quantities of gas (Katzung et al., 
1996). Advantages of CO2 storage in salt caverns include high 
capacity per unit volume (kgCO2 m–3), efficiency and injection 
flow rate. Disadvantages are the potential for CO2 release in 
the case of system failure, the relatively small capacity of most 
individual caverns and the environmental problems of disposing 
of brine from a solution cavity. Salt caverns can also be used for 
temporary storage of CO2 in collector and distributor systems 
between sources and sinks of CO2.
5.3.5.4 
Abandoned mines
The suitability of mines for CO2 storage depends on the nature 
and sealing capacity of the rock in which mining occurs. 
Heavily fractured rock, typical of igneous and metamorphic 
terrains, would be difficult to seal. Mines in sedimentary rocks 
may offer some CO2-storage opportunities (e.g., potash and 
salt mines or stratabound lead and zinc deposits). Abandoned 
coal mines offer the opportunity to store CO2, with the added 
benefit of adsorption of CO2 onto coal remaining in the mined-
out area (Piessens and Dusar, 2004). However, the rocks above 
coal mines are strongly fractured, which increases the risk 
of gas leakage. In addition, long-term, safe, high-pressure, 
CO2-resistant shaft seals have not been developed and any 
shaft failure could result in release of large quantities of CO2. 
Nevertheless, in Colorado, USA, there is a natural gas storage 
facility in an abandoned coal mine. 
5.3.6 
Effects of impurities on storage capacity
The presence of impurities in the CO2 gas stream affects the 
engineering processes of capture, transport and injection 
(Chapters 3 and 4), as well as the trapping mechanisms and 
capacity for CO2 storage in geological media. Some contaminants 
in the CO2 stream (e.g., SOx, NOx, H2S) may require classification 
as hazardous, imposing different requirements for injection and 
disposal than if the stream were pure (Bergman et al., 1997). 
Gas impurities in the CO2 stream affect the compressibility of 
the injected CO2 (and hence the volume needed for storing a 
given amount) and reduce the capacity for storage in free phase, 
because of the storage space taken by these gases. Additionally, 
depending on the type of geological storage, the presence of 
impurities may have some other specific effects.
 
In EOR operations, impurities affect the oil recovery 
because they change the solubility of CO2 in oil and the ability 
of CO2 to vaporize oil components (Metcalfe, 1982). Methane 
and nitrogen decrease oil recovery, whereas hydrogen sulphide, 
propane and heavier hydrocarbons have the opposite effect 
(Alston et al., 1985; Sebastian et al., 1985). The presence of 
SOx may improve oil recovery, whereas the presence of NOx 
can retard miscibility and thus reduce oil recovery (Bryant 
and Lake, 2005) and O2 can react exothermally with oil in the 
reservoir.
 
In the case of CO2 storage in deep saline formations, the 
presence of gas impurities affects the rate and amount of CO2 
storage through dissolution and precipitation. Additionally, 
leaching of heavy metals from the minerals in the rock matrix 
by SO2 or O2 contaminants is possible. Experience to date with 
acid gas injection (Section 5.2.4.2) suggests that the effect of 
impurities is not significant, although Knauss et al. (2005) 
suggest that SOx injection with CO2 produces substantially 
different chemical, mobilization and mineral reactions. Clarity 
is needed about the range of gas compositions that industry 
might wish to store, other than pure CO2 (Anheden et al., 
2005), because although there might be environmental issues 
to address, there might be cost savings in co-storage of CO2 and 
contaminants. 
 
In the case of CO2 storage in coal seams, impurities may also 
have a positive or negative effect, similar to EOR operations. If 
a stream of gas containing H2S or SO2 is injected into coal beds, 
these will likely be preferentially adsorbed because they have 
a higher affinity to coal than CO2, thus reducing the storage 
capacity for CO2 (Chikatamarla and Bustin, 2003). If oxygen 
is present, it will react irreversibly with the coal, reducing the 
sorption surface and, hence, the adsorption capacity. On the 
other hand, some impure CO2 waste streams, such as coal-fired 
flue gas (i.e., primarily N2 + CO2), may be used for ECBM 
because the CO2 is stripped out (retained) by the coal reservoir, 
because it has higher sorption selectivity than N2 and CH4.
5.3.7 
Geographical distribution and storage capacity 
estimates
Identifying potential sites for CO2 geological storage and 
estimating their capacity on a regional or local scale should 
conceptually be a simple task. The differences between the 
various mechanisms and means of trapping (Sections 5.2.2) 
suggest in principle the following methods:
•� �For volumetric trapping, capacity is the product of available 
volume (pore space or cavity) and CO2 density at in situ 
pressure and temperature;
•� �For solubility trapping, capacity is the amount of CO2 that 
can be dissolved in the formation fluid (oil in oil reservoirs, 
brackish water or brine in saline formations);
•� �For adsorption trapping, capacity is the product of coal 
volume and its capacity for adsorbing CO2;
Chapter 5: Underground geological storage
221
•� �For mineral trapping, capacity is calculated on the basis 
of available minerals for carbonate precipitation and the 
amount of CO2 that will be used in these reactions.
The major impediments to applying these simple methods for 
estimating the capacity for CO2 storage in geological media 
are the lack of data, their uncertainty, the resources needed 
to process data when available and the fact that frequently 
more than one trapping mechanism is active. This leads to two 
situations:
•� �Global capacity estimates have been calculated by 
simplifying assumptions and using very simplistic methods 
and hence are not reliable; 
•� �Country- and region- or basin-specific estimates are more 
detailed and precise, but are still affected by the limitations 
imposed by availability of data and the methodology used. 
Country- or basin-specific capacity estimates are available 
only for North America, Western Europe, Australia and 
Japan. 
The geographical distribution and capacity estimates are 
presented below and summarized in Table 5.2. 
5.3.7.1 
Storage in oil and gas reservoirs
This CO2 storage option is restricted to hydrocarbon-producing 
basins, which represent numerically less than half of the 
sedimentary provinces in the world. It is generally assumed that 
oil and gas reservoirs can be used for CO2 storage after their 
oil or gas reserves are depleted, although storage combined 
with enhanced oil or gas production can occur sooner. Short 
of a detailed, reservoir-by-reservoir analysis, the CO2 storage 
capacity can and should be calculated from databases of reserves 
and production (e.g., Winter and Bergman, 1993; Stevens et 
al., 2001b; Bachu and Shaw, 2003, 2005; Beecy and Kuuskra, 
2005).
 
In hydrocarbon reservoirs with little water encroachment, 
the injected CO2 will generally occupy the pore volume 
previously occupied by oil and/or natural gas. However, not 
all the previously (hydrocarbon-saturated) pore space will be 
available for CO2 because some residual water may be trapped 
in the pore space due to capillarity, viscous fingering and gravity 
effects (Stevens et al., 2001c). In open hydrocarbon reservoirs 
(where pressure is maintained by water influx), in addition to 
the capacity reduction caused by capillarity and other local 
effects, a significant fraction of the pore space will be invaded 
by water, decreasing the pore space available for CO2 storage, 
if repressuring the reservoir is limited to preserve reservoir 
integrity. In Western Canada, this loss was estimated to be in 
the order of 30% for gas reservoirs and 50% for oil reservoirs 
if reservoir repressuring with CO2 is limited to the initial 
reservoir pressure (Bachu et al., 2004). The capacity estimates 
presented here for oil and gas reservoirs have not included any 
‘discounting’ that may be appropriate for water-drive reservoirs 
because detailed site-specific reservoir analysis is needed to 
assess the effects of water-drive on capacity on a case-by-case 
basis.
 
Many storage-capacity estimates for oil and gas fields do 
not distinguish capacity relating to oil and gas that has already 
been produced from capacity relating to remaining reserves yet 
to be produced and that will become available in future years. 
In some global assessments, estimates also attribute capacity 
to undiscovered oil and gas fields that might be discovered in 
future years. There is uncertainty about when oil and gas fields 
will be depleted and become available for CO2 storage. The 
depletion of oil and gas fields is mostly affected by economic 
rather than technical considerations, particularly oil and gas 
prices. It is possible that production from near-depleted fields 
will be extended if future economic considerations allow more 
hydrocarbons to be recovered, thus delaying access to such 
fields for CO2 storage. Currently few of the world’s large oil 
and gas fields are depleted.
 
A variety of regional and global estimates of storage capacity 
in oil and gas fields have been made. Regional and national 
assessments use a ‘bottom-up’ approach that is based on field 
reserves data from each area’s existing and discovered oil and 
gas fields. Although the methodologies used may differ, there is 
a higher level of confidence in these than the global estimates, 
for the reasons outlined previously. Currently, this type of 
assessment is available only for northwestern Europe, United 
States, Canada and Australia. In Europe, there have been three 
bottom-up attempts to estimate the CO2 storage capacity of oil 
and gas reservoirs covering parts of Europe, but comprising most 
of Europe’s storage capacity since they include the North Sea 
(Holloway, 1996; Wildenborg et al., 2005b). The methodology 
used in all three studies was based on the assumption that 
the total reservoir volume of hydrocarbons could be replaced 
by CO2. The operators’ estimate of ‘ultimately recoverable 
reserves’ (URR) was used for each field where available or 
was estimated. The underground volume occupied by the 
URR and the amount of CO2 that could be stored in that space 
under reservoir conditions was then calculated. Undiscovered 
reserves were excluded. For Canada, the assumption was that

IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
the produced reserves (not the original oil or gas in place) could 
be replaced by CO2 (theoretical capacity) for all reservoirs in 
Western Canada, on the basis of in situ pressure, temperature 
and pore volume. Reduction coefficients were then applied 
to account for aquifer invasion and all other effects (effective 
capacity). This value was then reduced for depth (900–3500 m) 
and size (practical capacity) (Bachu and Shaw, 2005). 
 
The storage potential of northwestern Europe is estimated 
at more than 40 GtCO2 for gas reservoirs and 7 GtCO2 for oil 
fields (Wildenborg et al., 2005b). The European estimates are 
based on all reserves (no significant fields occur above 800 m). 
Carbon dioxide density was calculated from the depth, pressure 
and temperature of fields in most cases; where these were not 
available, a density of 700 kg m–3 was used. No assumption was 
made about the amount of oil recovered from the fields before 
CO2 storage was initiated and tertiary recovery by EOR was not 
included. In Western Canada, the practical CO2 storage potential 
in the Alberta and Williston basins in reservoirs with capacity 
more than 1 MtCO2 each was estimated to be about 1 GtCO2 in oil 
reservoirs and about 4 GtCO2 in gas reservoirs. The capacity in 
all discovered oil and gas reservoirs is approximately 10 GtCO2 
(Bachu et al., 2004; Bachu and Shaw, 2005). For Canada, the 
CO2 density was calculated for each reservoir from the pressure 
and temperature. The oil and gas recovery was that provided 
in the reserves databases or was based on actual production. 
For reservoirs suitable for EOR, an analytical method was 
developed to estimate how much would be produced and how 
much CO2 would be stored (Shaw and Bachu, 2002). In the 
United States, the total storage capacity in discovered oil and 
gas fields is estimated to be approximately 98 GtCO2 (Winter 
and Bergman, 1993; Bergman et al., 1997). Data on production 
to date and known reserves and resources indicate that Australia 
has up to 15 GtCO2 storage capacity in gas reservoirs and 0.7 
GtCO2 in oil reservoirs. The Australian estimates used field data 
to recalculate the CO2 that could occupy the producible volume 
at field conditions. The total storage capacity in discovered fields 
for these regions with bottom-up assessments is 170 GtCO2. 
 
Although not yet assessed, it is almost certain that significant 
storage potential exists in all other oil and gas provinces around 
the world, such as the Middle East, Russia, Asia, Africa and 
Latin America.
 
Global capacity for CO2-EOR opportunities is estimated to 
have a geological storage capacity of 61–123 GtCO2, although 
as practised today, CO2-EOR is not engineered to maximize 
CO2 storage. In fact, it is optimized to maximize revenues from 
oil production, which in many cases requires minimizing the 
amount of CO2 retained in the reservoir. In the future, if storing 
CO2 has an economic value, co-optimizing CO2 storage and 
EOR may increase capacity estimates. In European capacity 
studies, it was considered likely that EOR would be attempted 
at all oil fields where CO2 storage took place, because it would 
generate additional revenue. The calculation in Wildenborg et 
al. (2005b) allows for different recovery factors based on API 
(American Petroleum Institute) gravity of oil. For Canada, all 
10,000 oil reservoirs in Western Canada were screened for 
suitability for EOR on the basis of a set of criteria developed 
from EOR literature. Those oil reservoirs that passed were 
considered further in storage calculations (Shaw and Bachu, 
2002).
 
Global estimates of storage capacity in oil reservoirs vary 
from 126 to 400 GtCO2 (Freund, 2001). These assessments, 
made on a top-down basis, include potential in undiscovered 
reservoirs. Comparable global capacity for CO2 storage in 
gas reservoirs is estimated at 800 GtCO2 (Freund, 2001). 
The combined estimate of total ultimate storage capacity in 
discovered oil and gas fields is therefore very likely 675–900 
GtCO2. If undiscovered oil and gas fields are included, this 
figure would increase to 900–1200 GtCO2, but the confidence 
level would decrease.1
 
In comparison, more detailed regional estimates made for 
northwestern Europe, United States, Australia and Canada 
indicate a total of about 170 GtCO2 storage capacity in their 
existing oil and gas fields, with the discovered oil and gas 
reserves of these countries accounting for 18.9% of the world 
total (USGS, 2001a). Global storage estimates that are based on 
proportionality suggest that discovered worldwide oil and gas 
reservoirs have a capacity of 900 GtCO2, which is comparable 
to the global estimates by Freund (2001) of 800 GtCO2 for gas 
(Stevens et al., 2000) and 123 GtCO2 for oil and is assessed as 
a reliable value, although water invasion was not always taken 
into account. 
5.3.7.2 
Storage in deep saline formations
Saline formations occur in sedimentary basins throughout the 
world, both onshore and on the continental shelves (Chapter 2 
and Section 5.3.3) and are not limited to hydrocarbon provinces 
or coal basins. However, estimating the CO2 storage capacity of 
deep saline formations is presently a challenge for the following 
reasons:
•� �There are multiple mechanisms for storage, including 
physical trapping beneath low permeability caprock, 
dissolution and mineralization;
•� �These mechanisms operate both simultaneously and on 
different time scales, such that the time frame of CO2 
storage affects the capacity estimate; volumetric storage is 
important initially, but later CO2 dissolves and reacts with 
minerals; 
•� �Relations and interactions between these various mechanisms 
are very complex, evolve with time and are highly dependent 
on local conditions; 
•� �There is no single, consistent, broadly available methodology 
for estimating CO2 storage capacity (various studies have 
used different methods that do not allow comparison).
•� �Only limited seismic and well data are normally available 
(unlike data on oil and gas reservoirs).
To understand the difficulties in assessing CO2 storage capacity 
in deep saline formations, we need to understand the interplay 
1 Estimates of the undiscovered oil and gas are based on the USGS assessment 
that 30% more oil and gas will be discovered, compared to the resources known 
today.
Chapter 5: Underground geological storage
223
of the various trapping mechanisms during the evolution of 
a CO2 plume (Section 5.2 and Figure 5.18). In addition, the 
storage capacity of deep saline formations can be determined 
only on a case-by-case basis. 
 
To date, most of the estimates of CO2 storage capacity 
in deep saline formations focus on physical trapping and/or 
dissolution. These estimates make the simplifying assumption 
that no geochemical reactions take place concurrent with CO2 
injection, flow and dissolution. Some recent work suggests that 
it can take several thousand years for geochemical reactions to 
have a significant impact (Xu et al., 2003). The CO2 storage 
capacity from mineral trapping can be comparable to the 
capacity in solution per unit volume of sedimentary rock when 
formation porosity is taken into account (Bachu and Adams, 
2003; Perkins et al., 2005), although the rates and time frames 
of these two processes are different.
 
More than 14 global assessments of capacity have been 
made by using these types of approaches (IEA-GHG, 2004). 
The range of estimates from these studies is large (200–56,000 
GtCO2), reflecting both the different assumptions used to make 
these estimates and the uncertainty in the parameters. Most of 
the estimates are in the range of several hundred Gtonnes of 
CO2. Volumetric capacity estimates that are based on local, 
reservoir-scale numerical simulations of CO2 injection suggest 
occupancy of the pore space by CO2 on the order of a few percent 
as a result of gravity segregation and viscous fingering (van 
der Meer, 1992, 1995; Krom et al., 1993; Ispen and Jacobsen, 
1996). Koide et al. (1992) used the areal method of projecting 
natural resources reserves and assumed that 1% of the total area 
of the world’s sedimentary basins can be used for CO2 storage. 
Other studies considered that 2–6% of formation area can be 
used for CO2 storage. However, Bradshaw and Dance (2005) 
have shown there is no correlation between geographic area of a 
sedimentary basin and its capacity for either hydrocarbons (oil 
and gas reserves) or CO2 storage. 
 
The storage capacity of Europe has been estimated as 30–
577 GtCO2 (Holloway, 1996; Bøe et al., 2002; Wildenborg et 
al., 2005b). The main uncertainties for Europe are estimates of 
the amount trapped (estimated to be 3%) and storage efficiency, 
estimated as 2–6% (2% for closed aquifer with permeability 
barriers; 6% for open aquifer with almost infinite extent), 4% 
if open/closed status is not known. The volume in traps is 
assumed to be proportional to the total pore volume, which 
may not necessarily be correct. Early estimates of the total US 
storage capacity in deep saline formations suggested a total of 
up to 500 GtCO2 (Bergman and Winter, 1995). A more recent 
estimate of the capacity of a single deep formation in the United 
States, the Mount Simon Sandstone, is 160–800 GtCO2 (Gupta 
et al., 1999), suggesting that the total US storage capacity 
may be higher than earlier estimates. Assuming that CO2 will 
dissolve to saturation in all deep formations, Bachu and Adams 
(2003) estimated the storage capacity of the Alberta basin in 
Western Canada to be approximately 4000 GtCO2, which is a 
theoretical maximum assuming that all the pore water in the 
Alberta Basin could become saturated with CO2, which is not 
likely. An Australian storage capacity estimate of 740 GtCO2 
was determined by a cumulative risked-capacity approach for 
65 potentially viable sites from 48 basins (Bradshaw et al., 
2003). The total capacity in Japan has been estimated as 1.5–80 
GtCO2, mostly in offshore formations (Tanaka et al., 1995). 
 
Within these wide ranges, the lower figure is generally the 
estimated storage capacity of volumetric traps within the deep 
saline formations, where free-phase CO2 would accumulate. The 
larger figure is based on additional storage mechanisms, mainly 
dissolution but also mineral trapping. The various methods and 
data used in these capacity estimates demonstrate a high degree 
of uncertainty in estimating regional or global storage capacity 
in deep saline formations. In the examples from Europe and 
Japan, the maximum estimate is 15 to 50 times larger than the 
low estimate. Similarly, global estimates of storage capacity 
show a wide range, 100–200,000 GtCO2, reflecting different 
methodologies, levels of uncertainties and considerations of 
effective trapping mechanisms. 
 
The assessment of this report is that it is very likely that 
global storage capacity in deep saline formations is at least 1000 
GtCO2. Confidence in this assessment comes from the fact that 
oil and gas fields ‘discovered’ have a global storage capacity 
of approximately 675–900 GtCO2 and that they occupy only 
a small fraction of the pore volume in sedimentary basins, the 
rest being occupied by brackish water and brine. Moreover, 
oil and gas reservoirs occur only in about half of the world’s 
sedimentary basins. Additionally, regional estimates suggest 
that significant storage capacity is available. Significantly 
more storage capacity is likely to be available in deep saline 
formations. The literature is not adequate to support a robust 
estimate of the maximum geological storage capacity. Some 
studies suggest that it might be little more than 1000 GtCO2, 
while others indicate that the upper figure could be an order 
of magnitude higher. More detailed regional and local capacity 
assessments are required to resolve this issue.

IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
storage in coal formations has not yet been made. Normally, 
commercial CBM reservoirs are shallower than 1500 m, whereas 
coal mining in Europe and elsewhere has reached depths of 
1000 m. Because CO2 should not be stored in coals that could 
be potentially mined, there is a relatively narrow depth window 
for CO2 storage.
 
Assuming that bituminous coals can adsorb twice as much 
CO2 as methane, a preliminary analysis of the theoretical CO2 
storage potential for ECBM recovery projects suggests that 
approximately 60–200 GtCO2 could be stored worldwide 
in bituminous coal seams (IEA-GHG, 1998). More recent 
estimates for North America range from 60 to 90 GtCO2 (Reeves, 
2003b; Dooley et al., 2005), by including sub-bituminous 
coals and lignites. Technical and economic considerations 
suggest a practical storage potential of approximately 7 GtCO2 
for bituminous coals (Gale and Freund, 2001; Gale, 2004). 
Assuming that CO2 would not be stored in coal seams without 
recovering the CBM, a storage capacity of 3–15 GtCO2 is 
calculated, for a US annual production of CBM in 2003 of 
approximately 0.04 trillion m3 and projected global production 
levels of 0.20 trillion m3 in the future. This calculation assumes 
that 0.1 GtCO2 can be stored for every Tcf of produced CBM 
(3.53 GtCO2 for every trillion m3) and compares well to Gale 
(2004).
5.3.8  
Matching of CO2 sources and geological storage 
sites
Matching of CO2 sources with geological storage sites requires 
detailed assessment of source quality and quantity, transport and 
economic and environmental factors. If the storage site is far 
from CO2 sources or is associated with a high level of technical 
uncertainty, then its storage potential may never be realized.
5.3.8.1 
Regional studies
Matching sources of CO2 to potential storage sites, taking into 
account projections for future socio-economic development, 
will be particularly important for some of the rapidly 
developing economies. Assessment of sources and storage 
sites, together with numerical simulations, emissions mapping 
and identification of transport routes, has been undertaken for 
a number of regions in Europe (Holloway, 1996; Larsen et 
al., 2005). In Japan, studies have modelled and optimized the 
linkages between 20 onshore emission regions and 20 offshore 
storage regions, including both ocean storage and geological 
storage (Akimoto et al., 2003). Preliminary studies have also 
begun in India (Garg et al., 2005) and Argentina (Amadeo et 
al., 2005). For the United States, a study that used a Geographic 
Information System (GIS) and a broad-based economic analysis 
(Dooley et al., 2005) shows that about two-thirds of power 
stations are adjacent to potential geological storage locations, 
but a number would require transportation of hundreds of 
kilometres.
 
Studies of Canadian sedimentary basins that include 
descriptions of the type of data and flow diagrams of the 
assessment process have been carried out by Bachu (2003). 
Results for the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin show 
that, while the total capacity of oil and gas reservoirs in the 
basin is several Gtonnes of CO2, the capacity of underlying 
deep saline formations is two to three orders of magnitude 
higher. Most major CO2 emitters have potential storage sites 
relatively close by, with the notable exception of the oil sands 
plants in northeastern Alberta (current CO2 emissions of about  
20 MtCO2 yr-1). 
 
In Australia, a portfolio approach was undertaken for the 
continent to identify a range of geological storage sites (Rigg 
et al., 2001; Bradshaw et al., 2002). The initial assessment 
screened 300 sedimentary basins down to 48 basins and 65 areas. 
Methodology was developed for ranking storage sites (technical 
and economic risks) and proximity of large CO2 emission sites. 
Region-wide solutions were sought, incorporating an economic 
model to assess full project economics over 20 to 30 years, 
including costs of transport, storage, monitoring and Monte 
Carlo analysis. The study produced three storage estimates:
•� �Total capacity of 740 GtCO2, equivalent to 1600 years 
of current emissions, but with no economic barriers 
considered;
•� �‘Realistic’ capacity of 100–115 MtCO2 yr-1 or 50% of annual 
stationary emissions, determined by matching sources with 
the closest viable storage sites and assuming economic 
incentives for storage; 
•� �‘Cost curve’ capacity of 20–180 MtCO2 yr-1, with increasing 
storage capacity depending on future CO2 values.
5.3.8.2 
Methodology and assessment criteria
Although some commonality exists in the various approaches for 
capacity assessment, each study is influenced by the available 
data and resources, the aims of the respective study and whether 
local or whole-region solutions are being sought. The next level 
of analysis covers regional aspects and detail at the prospect or 
project level, including screening and selection of potential CO2 
storage sites on the basis of technical, environmental, safety and 
economic criteria. Finally, integration and analysis of various 
scenarios can lead to identification of potential storage sites 
that should then become targets of detailed engineering and 
economic studies.
 
The following factors should be considered when selecting 
CO2 storage sites and matching them with CO2 sources (Winter 
and Bergman, 1993; Bergman et al., 1997; Kovscek, 2002): 
volume, purity and rate of the CO2 stream; suitability of the 
storage sites, including the seal; proximity of the source and 
storage sites; infrastructure for the capture and delivery of 
CO2; existence of a large number of storage sites to allow 
diversification; known or undiscovered energy, mineral or 
groundwater resources that might be compromised; existing 
wells and infrastructure; viability and safety of the storage 
site; injection strategies and, in the case of EOR and ECBM, 
production strategies, which together affect the number of wells 
and their spacing; terrain and right of way; location of population 
centres; local expertise; and overall costs and economics.
 
Although technical suitability criteria are initial indicators 
for identifying potential CO2 storage sites, once the best 
Chapter 5: Underground geological storage
225
candidates have been selected, further considerations will be 
controlled by economic, safety and environmental aspects. 
These criteria must be assessed for the anticipated lifetime of 
the operation, to ascertain whether storage capacity can match 
supply volume and whether injection rates can match the 
supply rate. Other issues might include whether CO2 sources 
and storage sites are matched on a one-to-one basis or whether 
a collection and distribution system is implemented, to form 
an integrated industrial system. Such deliberations affect cost 
outcomes, as will the supply rates, through economies of 
scale. Early opportunities for source-storage matching could 
involve sites where an economic benefit might accrue through 
the enhanced production of oil or gas (Holtz et al., 2001; van 
Bergen et al., 2003b). 
 
Assigning technical risks is important for matching of CO2 
sources and storage sites, for five risk factors: storage capacity, 
injectivity, containment, site and natural resources (Bradshaw 
et al., 2002, 2003). These screening criteria introduce reality 
checks to large storage-capacity estimates and indicate which 
regions to concentrate upon in future detailed studies. The use of 
‘cost curve’ capacity introduces another level of sophistication 
that helps in identifying how sensitive any storage capacity 
estimate is to the cost of CO2. Combining the technical criteria 
into an economic assessment reveals that costs are quite 
project-specific.
5.4 
 Characterization and performance prediction for 
identified sites 
Key goals for geological CO2 storage site characterization are 
to assess how much CO2 can be stored at a potential storage site 
and to demonstrate that the site is capable of meeting required 
storage performance criteria (Figure 5.19). Site characterization 
requires the collection of the wide variety of geological data 
that are needed to achieve these goals. Much of the data will 
necessarily be site-specific. Most data will be integrated into 
geological models that will be used to simulate and predict the 
performance of the site. These and related issues are considered 
below.
5.4.1 
Characterization of identified sites
Storage site requirements depend greatly upon the trapping 
mechanism and the geological medium in which storage is 
proposed (e.g., deep saline formation, depleted oil or gas field or 
coal seam). Data availability and quality vary greatly between 
each of these options (Table 5.3). In many cases, oil and gas 
fields will be better characterized than deep saline formations 
because a relevant data set was collected during hydrocarbon 
exploration and production. However, this may not always be 
the case. There are many examples of deep saline formations 
whose character and performance for CO2 storage can be 
predicted reliably over a large area (Chadwick et al., 2003; 
Bradshaw et al., 2003). 
5.4.1.1 
Data types
The storage site and its surroundings need to be characterized 
in terms of geology, hydrogeology, geochemistry and 
geomechanics (structural geology and deformation in response 
to stress changes). The greatest emphasis will be placed on the 
reservoir and its sealing horizons. However, the strata above the 
storage formation and caprock also need to be assessed because 
if CO2 leaked it would migrate through them (Haidl et al., 2005). 
Documentation of the characteristics of any particular storage 
site will rely on data that have been obtained directly from the 
reservoir, such as core and fluids produced from wells at or near 
the proposed storage site, pressure transient tests conducted to 
test seal efficiency and indirect remote sensing measurements 
such as seismic reflection data and regional hydrodynamic 
pressure gradients. Integration of all of the different types of 
data is needed to develop a reliable model that can be used to 
assess whether a site is suitable for CO2 storage. 
 
During the site-selection process that may follow an initial 
screening, detailed reservoir simulation (Section 5.4.2 will be 
necessary to meaningfully assess a potential storage site. A range 
of geophysical, geological, hydrogeological and geomechanical 
information is required to perform the modelling associated 
with a reservoir simulation. This information must be built into 
a three-dimensional geological model, populated with known 
and extrapolated data at an appropriate scale. Examples of the 
basic types of data and products that may be useful are listed in 
Table 5.3.
 
Financial constraints may limit the types of data that can be 
collected as part of the site characterization and selection process. 
Today, no standard methodology prescribes how a site must be 
characterized. Instead, selections about site characterization data 
will be made on a site-specific basis, choosing those data sets 
that will be most valuable in the particular geological setting. 
However, some data sets are likely to be selected for every 
case. Geological site description from wellbores and outcrops 
are needed to characterize the storage formation and seal 
properties. Seismic surveys are needed to define the subsurface 
geological structure and identify faults or fractures that could 
create leakage pathways. Formation pressure measurements 
are needed to map the rate and direction of groundwater flow. 
Water quality samples are needed to demonstrate the isolation 
between deep and shallow groundwater.
5.4.1.2 
Assessment of stratigraphic factors affecting site 
integrity
Caprocks or seals are the permeability barriers (mostly vertical 
but sometimes lateral) that prevent or impede migration of 
CO2 from the injection site. The integrity of a seal depends on 
spatial distribution and physical properties. Ideally, a sealing 
rock unit should be regional in nature and uniform in lithology, 
especially at its base. Where there are lateral changes in the 
basal units of a seal rock, the chance of migration out of the 
primary reservoir into higher intervals increases. However, if 
the seal rock is uniform, regionally extensive and thick, then 
the main issues will be the physical rock strength, any natural or 
anthropomorphic penetrations (faults, fractures and wells) and 
226

economic, risking and engineering issues.
Chapter 5: Underground geological storage
227
potential CO2-water-rock reactions that could weaken the seal 
rock or increase its porosity and permeability.
 
Methods have been described for making field-scale 
measurements of the permeability of caprocks for formation 
gas storage projects, based on theoretical developments in the 
1950s and 1960s (Hantush and Jacobs, 1955; Hantush, 1960). 
These use water-pumping tests to measure the rate of leakage 
across the caprock (Witherspoon et al., 1968). A related type 
of test, called a pressure ‘leak-off’ test, can be used to measure 
caprock permeability and in situ stress. The capacity of a seal 
rock to hold back fluids can also be estimated from core samples 
by mercury injection capillary pressure (MICP) analysis, a 
method widely used in the oil and gas industry (Vavra et al., 
1992). MICP analysis measures the pressures required to move 
mercury through the pore network system of a seal rock. The 
resulting data can be used to derive the height of a column of 
reservoir rock saturated by a particular fluid (e.g., CO2) that the 
sealing strata would be capable of holding back (Gibson-Poole 
et al., 2002). 
5.4.1.3 
Geomechanical factors affecting site integrity
When CO2 is injected into a porous and permeable reservoir 
rock, it will be forced into pores at a pressure higher than 
that in the surrounding formation. This pressure could lead to 
deformation of the reservoir rock or the seal rock, resulting 
in the opening of fractures or failure along a fault plane. 
Geomechanical modelling of the subsurface is necessary in 
any storage site assessment and should focus on the maximum 
formation pressures that can be sustained in a storage site. As 
an example, at Weyburn, where the initial reservoir pressure is 
14.2 MPa, the maximum injection pressure (90% of fracture 
pressure) is in the range of 25–27 MPa and fracture pressure is in 
the range of 29–31 MPa. Coupled geomechanical-geochemical 
modelling may also be needed to document fracture sealing by 
precipitation of carbonates in fractures or pores. Modelling these 
will require knowledge of pore fluid composition, mineralogy, 
in situ stresses, pore fluid pressures and pre-existing fault 
orientations and their frictional properties (Streit and Hillis, 
2003; Johnson et al., 2005). These estimates can be made from 
conventional well and seismic data and leak-off tests, but the 
results can be enhanced by access to physical measurements 
of rock strength. Application of this methodology at a regional 
scale is documented by Gibson-Poole et al. (2002).
 
The efficacy of an oil or gas field seal rock can be 
characterized by examining its capillary entry pressure and the 
potential hydrocarbon column height that it can sustain (see 
above). However, Jimenez and Chalaturnyk (2003) suggest that 
the geomechanical processes, during depletion and subsequent 
CO2 injection, may affect the hydraulic integrity of the seal 
rock in hydrocarbon fields. Movement along faults can be 
produced in a hydrocarbon field by induced changes in the pre-
production stress regime. This can happen when fluid pressures 
are substantially depleted during hydrocarbon production 
(Streit and Hillis, 2003). Determining whether the induced 
stress changes result in compaction or pore collapse is critical 
in assessment of a depleted field. If pore collapse occurs, then 
it might not be possible to return a pressure-depleted field to 
its original pore pressure without the risk of induced failure. 
By having a reduced maximum pore fluid pressure, the total 
volume of CO2 that can be stored in a depleted field could be 
substantially less than otherwise estimated.
5.4.1.4 
Geochemical factors affecting site integrity
The mixing of CO2 and water in the pore system of the reservoir 
rock will create dissolved CO2, carbonic acid and bicarbonate 
ions. The acidification of the pore water reduces the amount 
of CO2 that can be dissolved. As a consequence, rocks that 
buffer the pore water pH to higher values (reducing the acidity) 
facilitate the storage of CO2 as a dissolved phase (Section 5.2). 
The CO2-rich water may react with minerals in the reservoir rock 
or caprock matrix or with the primary pore fluid. Importantly, it 
may also react with borehole cements and steels (see discussion

below). Such reactions may cause either mineral dissolution 
and potential breakdown of the rock (or cement) matrix or 
mineral precipitation and plugging of the pore system (and thus, 
reduction in permeability). 
 
A carbonate mineral formation effectively traps stored CO2 
as an immobile solid phase (Section 5.2). If the mineralogical 
composition of the rock matrix is strongly dominated by quartz, 
geochemical reactions will be dominated by simple dissolution 
into the brine and CO2-water-rock reactions can be neglected. 
In this case, complex geochemical simulations of rock-water 
interactions will not be needed. However, for more complex 
mineralogies, sophisticated simulations, based on laboratory 
experimental data that use reservoir and caprock samples and 
native pore fluids, may be necessary to fully assess the potential 
effects of such reactions in more complex systems (Bachu et al., 
1994; Czernichowski-Lauriol et al., 1996; Rochelle et al., 1999, 
2004; Gunter et al., 2000). Studies of rock samples recovered 
from natural systems rich in CO2 can provide indications of 
what reactions might occur in the very long term (Pearce et al., 
1996). Reactions in boreholes are considered by Crolet (1983), 
Rochelle et al. (2004) and Schremp and Roberson (1975). 
Natural CO2 reservoirs also allow sampling of solid and fluid 
reactants and reaction products, thus allowing formulation 
of geochemical models that can be verified with numerical 
simulations, further facilitating quantitative predictions of 
water-CO2-rock reactions (May, 1998).
5.4.1.5 
Anthropogenic factors affecting storage integrity
As discussed at greater length in Section 5.7.2, anthropogenic 
factors such as active or abandoned wells, mine shafts and 
subsurface production can impact storage security. Abandoned 
wells that penetrate the storage formation can be of particular 
concern because they may provide short circuits for CO2 to leak 
from the storage formation to the surface (Celia and Bachu, 
2003; Gasda et al., 2004). Therefore, locating and assessing 
the condition of abandoned and active wells is an important 
component of site characterization. It is possible to locate 
abandoned wells with airborne magnetometer surveys. In 
most cases, abandoned wells will have metal casings, but this 
may not be the case for wells drilled long ago or those never 
completed for oil or gas production. Countries with oil and gas 
production will have at least some records of the more recently 
drilled wells, depth of wells and other information stored in 
a geographic database. The consistency and quality of record 
keeping of drilled wells (oil and gas, mining exploration and 
water) varies considerably, from excellent for recent wells 
to nonexistent, particularly for older wells (Stenhouse et al., 
2004). 
5.4.2 
Performance prediction and optimization 
modelling
Computer simulation also has a key role in the design and 
operation of field projects for underground injection of CO2. 
Predictions of the storage capacity of the site or the expected 
incremental recovery in enhanced recovery projects, are vital to 
an initial assessment of economic feasibility. In a similar vein, 
simulation can be used in tandem with economic assessments 
to optimize the location, number, design and depth of injection 
wells. For enhanced recovery projects, the timing of CO2 
injection relative to production is vital to the success of the 
operation and the effect of various strategies can be assessed 
by simulation. Simulations of the long-term distribution of 
CO2 in the subsurface (e.g., migration rate and direction and 
rate of dissolution in the formation water) are important for 
the design of cost-effective monitoring programmes, since the 
results will influence the location of monitoring wells and the 
frequency of repeat measurements, such as for seismic, soil gas 
or water chemistry. During injection and monitoring operations, 
simulation models can be adjusted to match field observations 
and then used to assess the impact of possible operational 
changes, such as drilling new wells or altering injection rates, 
often with the goal of further improving recovery (in the context 
of hydrocarbon extraction) or of avoiding migration of CO2 past 
a likely spill-point.
 
Section 5.2 described the important physical, chemical 
and geomechanical processes that must be considered when 
evaluating a storage project. Numerical simulators currently 
in use in the oil, gas and geothermal energy industries provide 
important subsets of the required capabilities. They have served 
as convenient starting points for recent and ongoing development 
efforts specifically targeted at modelling the geological storage 
of CO2. Many simulation codes have been used and adapted for 
this purpose (White, 1995; Nitao, 1996; White and Oostrom, 
1997; Pruess et al., 1999; Lichtner, 2001; Steefel, 2001; Xu et 
al., 2003). 
 
Simulation codes are available for multiphase flow processes, 
chemical reactions and geomechanical changes, but most codes 
account for only a subset of these processes. Capabilities 
for a comprehensive treatment of different processes are 
limited at present. This is especially true for the coupling of 
multiphase fluid flow, geochemical reactions and (particularly) 
geomechanics, which are very important for the integrity of 
potential geological storage sites (Rutqvist and Tsang, 2002). 
Demonstrating that they can model the important physical and 
chemical processes accurately and reliably is necessary for 
establishing credibility as practical engineering tools. Recently, 
an analytical model developed for predicting the evolution of 
a plume of CO2 injected into a deep saline formation, as well 
as potential CO2 leakage rates through abandoned wells, has 
shown good matching with results obtained from the industry 
numerical simulator ECLIPSE (Celia et al., 2005; Nordbotten 
et al., 2005b). 
 
A code intercomparison study involving ten research 
groups from six countries was conducted recently to evaluate 
the capabilities and accuracy of numerical simulators for 
geological storage of greenhouse gases (Pruess et al., 2004). 
The test problems addressed CO2 storage in saline formations 
and oil and gas reservoirs. The results of the intercomparison 
were encouraging in that substantial agreement was found 
between results obtained with different simulators. However, 
there were also areas with only fair agreement, as well as some 
Chapter 5: Underground geological storage
229
significant discrepancies. Most discrepancies could be traced to 
differences in fluid property descriptions, such as fluid densities 
and viscosities and mutual solubility of CO2 and water. The study 
concluded that ‘although code development work undoubtedly 
must continue . . . codes are available now that can model the 
complex phenomena accompanying geological storage of CO2 
in a robust manner and with quantitatively similar results’ 
(Pruess et al., 2004). 
 
Another, similar intercomparison study was conducted 
for simulation of storage of CO2 in coal beds, considering 
both pure CO2 injection and injection of flue gases (Law et 
al., 2003). Again, there was good agreement between the 
simulation results from different codes. Code intercomparisons 
are useful for checking mathematical methods and numerical 
approximations and to provide insight into relevant phenomena 
by using the different descriptions of the physics (or chemistry) 
implemented. However, establishing the realism and accuracy 
of physical and chemical process models is a more demanding 
task, one that requires carefully controlled and monitored field 
and laboratory experiments. Only after simulation models have 
been shown to be capable of adequately representing real-world 
observations can they be relied upon for engineering design and 
analysis. Methods for calibrating models to complex engineered 
subsurface systems are available, but validating them requires 
field testing that is time consuming and expensive. 
 
The principal difficulty is that the complex geological 
models on which the simulation models are based are subject 
to considerable uncertainties, resulting both from uncertainties 
in data interpretation and, in some cases, sparse data sets. 
Measurements taken at wells provide information on rock 
and fluid properties at that location, but statistical techniques 
must be used to estimate properties away from the wells. When 
simulating a field in which injection or production is already 
occurring, a standard approach in the oil and gas industry is 
to adjust some parameters of the geological model to match 
selected field observations. This does not prove that the model is 
correct, but it does provide additional constraints on the model 
parameters. In the case of saline formation storage, history 
matching is generally not feasible for constraining uncertainties, 
due to a lack of underground data for comparison. Systematic 
parameter variation routines and statistical functions should 
be included in future coupled simulators to allow uncertainty 
estimates for numerical reservoir simulation results. 
 
Field tests of CO2 injection are under way or planned in 
several countries and these tests provide opportunities to validate 
simulation models. For example, in Statoil’s Sleipner project, 
simulation results have been matched to information on the 
distribution of CO2 in the subsurface, based on the interpretation 
of repeat three-dimensional seismic surveys (Lindeberg et al., 
2001; van der Meer et al., 2001; see also Section 5.4.3. At the 
Weyburn project in Canada, repeat seismic surveys and water 
chemistry sampling provide information on CO2 distribution 
that can likewise be used to adjust the simulation models 
(Moberg et al., 2003; White et al., 2004). 
 
Predictions of the long-term distribution of injected CO2, 
including the effects of geochemical reactions, cannot be 
directly validated on a field scale because these reactions may 
take hundreds to thousands of years. However, the simulation 
of important mechanisms, such as the convective mixing 
of dissolved CO2, can be tested by comparison to laboratory 
analogues (Ennis-King and Paterson, 2003). Another possible 
route is to match simulations to the geochemical changes 
that have occurred in appropriate natural underground 
accumulations of CO2, such as the precipitation of carbonate 
minerals, since these provide evidence for the slow processes 
that affect the long-term distribution of CO2 (Johnson et al., 
2005). It is also important to have reliable and accurate data 
regarding the thermophysical properties of CO2 and mixtures 
of CO2 with methane, water and potential contaminants such 
as H2S and SO2. Similarly, it is important to have data on 
relative permeability and capillary pressure under drainage 
and imbibition conditions. Code comparison studies show that 
the largest discrepancies between different simulators can be 
traced to uncertainties in these parameters (Pruess et al., 2004). 
For sites where few, if any, CO2-water-rock interactions occur, 
reactive chemical transport modelling may not be needed and 
simpler simulations that consider only CO2-water reactions will 
suffice. 
5.4.3 
Examples of storage site characterization and 
performance prediction
Following are examples and lessons learned from two case 
studies of characterization of a CO2 storage site: one of an actual 
operating CO2 storage site (Sleipner Gas Field in the North Sea) 
and the other of a potential or theoretical site (Petrel Sub-basin 
offshore northwest Australia). A common theme throughout 
these studies is the integration and multidisciplinary approach 
required to adequately document and monitor any injection 
site. There are lessons to be learned from these studies, because 
they have identified issues that in hindsight should be examined 
prior to any CO2 injection.
5.4.3.1 
Sleipner 
Studies of the Sleipner CO2 Injection Project (Box 5.1) 
highlighted the advantages of detailed knowledge of the 
reservoir stratigraphy (Chadwick et al., 2003). After the initial 
CO2 injection, small layers of low-permeability sediments within 
the saline formation interval and sandy lenses near the base of 
the seal were clearly seen to be exercising an important control 
on the distribution of CO2 within the reservoir rock (Figure 
5.16a,b). Time-lapse three-dimensional seismic imaging of the 
developing CO2 plume also identified the need for precision 
depth mapping of the bottom of the caprock interval. At Sleipner, 
the top of the reservoir is almost flat at a regional scale. Hence, 
any subtle variance in the actual versus predicted depth could 
substantially affect migration patterns and rate. Identification 
and mapping of a sand lens above what was initially interpreted 
as the top of the reservoir resulted in a significant change to 
the predicted migration direction of the CO2 (Figure 5.16a,b). 
These results show the benefit of repeated three-dimensional 
seismic monitoring and integration of monitoring results into 
230
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
modelling during the injection phase of the project. Refinement 
of the storage-site characterization continues after injection has 
started. 
5.4.3.2 
Petrel Sub-basin 
A theoretical case study of the Petrel Sub-basin offshore 
northwest Australia examined the basin-wide storage potential 
of a combined hydrodynamic and solution trapping mechanism 
and identified how sensitive a reservoir simulation will be to 
the collected data and models built during the characterization 
of a storage site (Gibson-Poole et al., 2002; Ennis-King et al., 
2003). As at Sleipner, the Petrel study identified that vertical 
permeability and shale beds within the reservoir interval of 
the geological model strongly influenced the vertical CO2 
migration rate. In the reservoir simulation, use of coarser grids 
overestimated the dissolution rate of CO2 during the injection 
period, but underestimated it during the long-term migration 
period. Lower values of residual CO2 saturation led to faster 
dissolution during the long-term migration period and the rate 
of complete dissolution depended on the vertical permeability. 
Migration distance depended on the rate of dissolution and 
residual CO2 trapping. The conclusion of the characterization 
and performance prediction studies is that the Petrel Sub-
basin has a regionally extensive reservoir-seal pair suitable for 
hydrodynamic trapping (Section 5.2). While the characterization 
was performed on the basis of only a few wells with limited 
data, analogue studies helped define the characteristics of the 
formation. Although this is not the ideal situation, performing a 
reservoir simulation by using geological analogues may often be 
the only option. However, understanding which elements will 
be the most sensitive in the simulation will help geoscientists 
to understand where to prioritize their efforts in data collection 
and interpretation.
5.5 
Injection well technology and field operations
So far in this chapter, we have considered only the nature of 
the storage site. But once a suitable site is identified, do we 
have the technology available to inject large quantities of CO2 
(1–10 MtCO2 yr-1) into the subsurface and to operate the site 
effectively and safely? This section examines the issue of 
technology availability.
5.5.1 
Injection well technologies
As pointed out earlier in this chapter, many of the technologies 
required for large-scale geological storage of CO2 already 
exist. Drilling and completion technology for injection wells 
in the oil and gas industry has evolved to a highly sophisticated 
state, such that it is now possible to drill and complete vertical 
and extended reach wells (including horizontal wells) in deep 
formations, wells with multiple completions and wells able to 
handle corrosive fluids. On the basis of extensive oil industry 
experience, the technologies for drilling, injection, stimulations 
and completions for CO2 injection wells exist and are being 
practised with some adaptations in current CO2 storage projects. 
In a CO2 injection well, the principal well design considerations 
include pressure, corrosion-resistant materials and production 
and injection rates. 
 
The design of a CO2 injection well is very similar to that of 
a gas injection well in an oil field or natural gas storage project. 
Most downhole components need to be upgraded for higher 
pressure ratings and corrosion resistance. The technology for 
handling CO2 has already been developed for EOR operations 
and for the disposal of acid gas (Section 5.2.4.) Horizontal and 
extended reach wells can be good options for improving the rate 
of CO2 injection from individual wells. The Weyburn field in 
Canada (Box 5.3) is an example in which the use of horizontal 
injection wells is improving oil recovery and increasing CO2 
storage. The horizontal injectors reduce the number of injection 
wells required for field development. A horizontal injection 
well has the added advantage that it can create injection profiles 
that reduce the adverse effects of injected-gas preferential flow 
through high-permeability zones. 
 
The number of wells required for a storage project will 
depend on a number of factors, including total injection 
rate, permeability and thickness of the formation, maximum 
injection pressures and availability of land-surface area for 
the injection wells. In general, fewer wells will be needed for 
high-permeability sediments in thick storage formations and for 
those projects with horizontal wells for injection. For example, 
the Sleipner Project, which injects CO2 into a high-permeability, 
200-m-thick formation uses only one well to inject 1 MtCO2 yr-1 
(Korbol and Kaddour, 1994). In contrast, at the In Salah Project 
in Algeria, CO2 is injected into a 20-m-thick formation with 
much lower permeability (Riddiford et al., 2003). Here, three 
long-reach horizontal wells with slotted intervals over 1 km 
are used to inject 1 MtCO2 yr-1 (Figure 5.5). Cost will depend, 
to some degree, on the number and completion techniques for 
these wells. Therefore, careful design and optimization of the 
number and slotted intervals is important for cost-effective 
storage projects. 
 
An injection well and a wellhead are depicted in Figure 
5.20. Injection wells commonly are equipped with two valves 
for well control, one for regular use and one reserved for safety 
shutoff. In acid gas injection wells, a downhole safety valve 
is incorporated in the tubing, so that if equipment fails at the 
surface, the well is automatically shut down to prevent back 
flow. Jarrell et al. (2002) recommend an automatic shutoff valve 
on all CO2 wells to ensure that no release occurs and to prevent 
CO2 from inadvertently flowing back into the injection system. 
A typical downhole configuration for an injection well includes 
a double-grip packer, an on-off tool and a downhole shutoff 
valve. Annular pressure monitors help detect leaks in packers 
and tubing, which is important for taking rapid corrective 
action. To prevent dangerous high-pressure buildup on surface 
equipment and avoid CO2 releases into the atmosphere, CO2 
injection must be stopped as soon as leaks occur. Rupture disks 
and safety valves can be used to relieve built-up pressure. 
Adequate plans need to be in place for dealing with excess CO2 
if the injection well needs to be shut in. Options include having 
Chapter 5: Underground geological storage
231
a backup injection well or methods to safely vent CO2 to the 
atmosphere. 
 
Proper maintenance of CO2 injection wells is necessary to 
avoid leakage and well failures. Several practical procedures can 
be used to reduce probabilities of CO2 blow-out (uncontrolled 
flow) and mitigate the adverse effects if one should occur. These 
include periodic wellbore integrity surveys on drilled injection 
wells, improved blow-out prevention (BOP) maintenance, 
installation of additional BOP on suspect wells, improved crew 
awareness, contingency planning and emergency response 
training (Skinner, 2003).
 
For CO2 injection through existing and old wells, key factors 
include the mechanical condition of the well and quality of the 
cement and well maintenance. A leaking wellbore annulus can 
be a pathway for CO2 migration. Detailed logging programmes 
for checking wellbore integrity can be conducted by the operator 
to protect formations and prevent reservoir cross-flow. A well 
used for injection (Figure 5.20) must be equipped with a packer 
to isolate pressure to the injection interval. All materials used in 
injection wells should be designed to anticipate peak volume, 
pressure and temperature. In the case of wet gas (containing 
free water), use of corrosion-resistant material is essential.
5.5.2 
Well abandonment procedures
Abandonment procedures for oil, gas and injection wells are 
designed to protect drinking water aquifers from contamination. 
If a well remains open after it is no longer in use, brines, 
hydrocarbons or CO2 could migrate up the well and into 
shallow drinking water aquifers. To avoid this, many countries 
have developed regulations for well ‘abandonment’ or ‘closure’ 
(for example, United States Code of Federal Regulations 40 
Part 144 and Alberta Energy and Utilities Board, 2003). These 
procedures usually require placing cement or mechanical plugs 
in all or part of the well. Extra care is usually taken to seal 
the well adjacent to drinking water aquifers. Examples of well 
abandonment procedures for cased and uncased wells are shown 
in Figure 5.21. Tests are often required to locate the depth of the 
plugs and test their mechanical strength under pressure. 
 
It is expected that abandonment procedures for CO2 wells 
could broadly follow the abandonment methodology used for 
oil and gas wells and acid-gas disposal wells. However, special 
care has to be taken to use sealing plugs and cement that are 
resistant to degradation from CO2. Carbon dioxide-resistant 
cements have been developed for oil field and geothermal 
applications. It has been suggested that removing the casing and 
the liner penetrating the caprock could avoid corrosion of the 
steel that may later create channels for leakage. The production 
casing can be removed by pulling or drilling (milling) it out. 
After removing the casing, a cement plug can be put into the 
open borehole, as illustrated in Figure 5.21.
 
The cement plug will act as the main barrier to future CO2 
migration. A major issue is related to the sealing quality of 
the cement plug and the bonding quality with the penetrated 
caprock. Microchannels created near the wellbore during drilling 
or milling operations should be sealed with cement. Fluid could 
also be flushed into the storage reservoir to displace the CO2 
and help to improve the cementing quality and bonding to the 
sealing caprock. Casing protective materials and alternative 
casing materials, such as composites, should also be evaluated 
Figure 5.20  Typical CO2 injection well and wellhead configuration.
232
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
for possible and alternative abandonment procedures. Sealing 
performance of abandoned wells may need to be monitored for 
some time after storage operations are completed.
5.5.3 
Injection well pressure and reservoir constraints
Injectivity characterizes the ease with which fluid can be 
injected into a geological formation and is defined as the 
injection rate divided by the pressure difference between the 
injection point inside the well and the formation. Although CO2 
injectivity should be significantly greater than brine injectivity 
(because CO2 has a much lower viscosity than brine), this is 
not always the case. Grigg (2005) analyzed the performance 
of CO2 floods in west Texas and concluded that, in more than 
half of the projects, injectivity was lower than expected or 
decreased over time. Christman and Gorell (1990) showed 
that unexpected CO2-injectivity behaviour in EOR operations 
is caused primarily by differences in flow geometry and fluid 
properties of the oil. Injectivity changes can also be related to 
insufficiently known relative permeability effects.
 
To introduce CO2 into the storage formation, the downhole 
injection pressure must be higher than the reservoir fluid 
pressure. On the other hand, increasing formation pressure 
may induce fractures in the formation. Regulatory agencies 
normally limit the maximum downhole pressure to avoid 
fracturing the injection formation. Measurements of in-situ 
formation stresses and pore fluid pressure are needed for 
establishing safe injection pressures. Depletion of fluid pressure 
during production can affect the state of stress in the reservoir. 
Analysis of some depleted reservoirs indicated that horizontal 
rock stress decreased by 50–80% of the pore pressure decrease, 
which increased the possibility of fracturing the reservoir (Streit 
and Hillis, 2003). 
 
Safe injection pressures can vary widely, depending on the 
state of stress and tectonic history of a basin. Regulatory agencies 
have determined safe injection pressures from experience in 
specific oil and gas provinces. Van der Meer (1996) has derived 
a relationship for the maximum safe injection pressure. This 
relationship indicated that for a depth down to 1000 m, the 
maximum injection pressure is estimated to be 1.35 times the 
hydrostatic pressure – and this increased to 2.4 for depths of 
1–5 km. The maximum pressure gradient allowed for natural 
gas stored in an aquifer in Germany is 16.8 kPa m–1 (Sedlacek, 
1999). This value exceeds the natural pressure gradients of 
formation waters in northeastern Germany, which are on the 
order of 10.5–13.1 kPa m–1. In Denmark or Great Britain, the 
maximum pressure gradients for aquifer storage of natural 
gas do not exceed hydrostatic gradients. In the United States, 
Figure 5.21  Examples of how cased and uncased wells are abandoned today. Special requirements may be developed for abandoning CO2 storage 
wells, including use of corrosion-resistant cement plugs and removing all or part of the casing in the injection interval and caprock.
Chapter 5: Underground geological storage
233
for industrial waste-water injection wells, injection pressure 
must not exceed fracture initiation or propagation pressures in 
the injection formation (USEPA, 1994). For oil and gas field 
injection wells, injection pressures must not exceed those that 
would initiate or propagate fractures in the confining units. In 
the United States, each state has been delegated authority to 
establish maximum injection pressures. Until the 1990s, many 
states set state-wide standards for maximum injection pressures; 
values ranged from 13 to18 kPa m–1. More recently, regulations 
have changed to require site-specific tests to establish maximum 
injection pressure gradients. Practical experience in the 
USEPA’s Underground Injection Control Program has shown 
that fracture pressures range from 11 to 21 kPa m–1.
5.5.4 
Field operations and surface facilities
Injection rates for selected current CO2 storage projects in EOR 
and acid gas injection are compared in Figure 5.22. As indicated, 
the amount of CO2 injected from a 500-MW coal-fired power 
plant would fall within the range of existing experience of CO2 
injection operations for EOR. These examples therefore offer 
a great deal of insight as to how a geological storage regime 
might evolve, operate and be managed safely and effectively.
 
CO2-EOR operations fall into one of three groups (Jarrell et 
al., 2002):
•� �Reservoir management – what to inject, how fast to inject, 
how much to inject, how to manage water-alternating-gas 
(WAG), how to maximize sweep efficiency and so on;
•� �Well management – producing method and remedial work, 
including selection of workovers, chemical treatment and 
CO2 breakthrough;
•� �Facility management – reinjection plant, separation, 
metering, corrosion control and facility organization.
Typically, CO2 is transported from its source to an EOR site 
through a pipeline and is then injected into the reservoir through 
an injection well, usually after compression. Before entering the 
compressor, a suction scrubber will remove any residual liquids 
present in the CO2 stream. In EOR operations, CO2 produced 
from the production well along with oil and water is separated 
and then injected back through the injection well. 
 
The field application of CO2-ECBM technology is broadly 
similar to that of EOR operations. Carbon dioxide is transported 
to the CBM field and injected in the coal seam through dedicated 
injection wells. At the production well, coal-seam gas and 
formation water is lifted to the surface by electric pumps. 
 
According to Jarrell et al. (2002), surface facilities for CO2-
EOR projects include:
•� �Production 
systems-fluid 
separation, 
gas 
gathering, 
production satellite, liquid gathering, central battery, field 
compression and emergency shutdown systems;
•� �Injection systems-gas repressurization, water injection and 
CO2 distribution systems;
•� �Gas processing systems-gas processing plant, H2S removal 
systems and sulphur recovery and disposal systems.
Jarrell et al. (2002) point out that CO2 facilities are similar to 
those used in conventional facilities such as for waterfloods. 
Differences result from the effects of multiphase flow, selection 
of different materials and the higher pressure that must be 
handled. The CO2 field operation setup for the Weyburn Field is 
shown in Figure 5.23.
Figure 5.22  Comparison of the magnitude of CO2 injection activities illustrating that the storage operations from a typical 500-MW coal plant 
will be the same order of magnitude as existing CO2 injection operations (after Heinrich et al., 2003).
234
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
 
It is common to use existing facilities for new CO2 projects 
to reduce capital costs, although physical restrictions are always 
present. Starting a CO2 flood in an old oil field can affect almost 
every process and facility (Jarrell et al., 2002); for example, 
(1) the presence of CO2 makes the produced water much more 
corrosive; (2) makeup water from new sources may interact 
with formation water to create new problems with scale or 
corrosion; (3) a CO2 flood may cause paraffins and asphaltenes 
to precipitate out of the oil, which can cause plugging and 
emulsion problems; and (4) the potentially dramatic increase 
in production caused by the flood could cause more formation 
fines to be entrained in the oil, potentially causing plugging, 
erosion and processing problems.
5.6 
Monitoring and verification technology
What actually happens to CO2 in the subsurface and how do 
we know what is happening? In other words, can we monitor 
CO2 once it is injected? What techniques are available for 
monitoring whether CO2 is leaking out of the storage formation 
and how sensitive are they? Can we verify that CO2 is safely 
and effectively stored underground? How long is monitoring 
needed? These questions are addressed in this section of the 
report.
5.6.1 
Purposes for monitoring
Monitoring is needed for a wide variety of purposes. Specifically, 
monitoring can be used to:
•� �Ensure and document effective injection well controls, 
specifically for monitoring the condition of the injection 
well and measuring injection rates, wellhead and formation 
pressures. Petroleum industry experience suggests that 
leakage from the injection well itself, resulting from 
improper completion or deterioration of the casing, packers 
or cement, is one of the most significant potential failure 
modes for injection projects (Apps, 2005; Perry, 2005); 
•� �Verify the quantity of injected CO2 that has been stored by 
various mechanisms; 
•� �Optimize the efficiency of the storage project, including 
utilization of the storage volume, injection pressures and 
drilling of new injection wells;
•� �Demonstrate with appropriate monitoring techniques that 
CO2 remains contained in the intended storage formation(s). 
This is currently the principal method for assuring that the 
CO2 remains stored and that performance predictions can be 
verified; 
•� �Detect leakage and provide an early warning of any seepage 
or leakage that might require mitigating action.
Figure 5.23  Typical CO2 field operation setup: Weyburn surface facilities.
Chapter 5: Underground geological storage
235
In addition to essential elements of a monitoring strategy, other 
parameters can be used to optimize storage projects, deal with 
unintended leakage and address regulatory, legal and social 
issues. Other important purposes for monitoring include assessing 
the integrity of plugged or abandoned wells, calibrating and 
confirming performance assessment models (including ‘history 
matching’), establishing baseline parameters for the storage 
site to ensure that CO2-induced changes are recognized (Wilson 
and Monea, 2005), detecting microseismicity associated with a 
storage project, measuring surface fluxes of CO2 and designing 
and monitoring remediation activities (Benson et al., 2004).
 
Before monitoring of subsurface storage can take place 
effectively, a baseline survey must be taken. This survey 
provides the point of comparison for subsequent surveys. 
This is particularly true of seismic and other remote-sensing 
technologies, where the identification of saturation of fluids with 
CO2 is based on comparative analysis. Baseline monitoring is also 
a prerequisite for geochemical monitoring, where anomalies are 
identified relative to background concentrations. Additionally, 
establishing a baseline of CO2 fluxes resulting from ecosystem 
cycling of CO2, both on diurnal and annual cycles, are useful 
for distinguishing natural fluxes from potential storage-related 
releases.
 
Much of the monitoring technology described below was 
developed for application in the oil and gas industry. Most of 
these techniques can be applied to monitoring storage projects 
in all types of geological formations, although much remains 
to be learned about monitoring coal formations. Monitoring 
experience from natural gas storage in saline aquifers can also 
provide a useful industrial analogue.
5.6.2 
Technologies for monitoring injection rates and 
pressures
Measurements of CO2 injection rates are a common oil 
field practice and instruments for this purpose are available 
commercially. Measurements are made by gauges either at 
the injection wellhead or near distribution manifolds. Typical 
systems use orifice meters or other devices that relate the 
pressure drop across the device to the flow rate. The accuracy of 
the measurements depends on a number of factors that have been 
described in general by Morrow et al. (2003) and specifically 
for CO2 by Wright and Majek (1998). For CO2, accurate 
estimation of the density is most important for improving 
measurement accuracy. Small changes in temperature, pressure 
and composition can have large effects on density. Wright and 
Majek (1998) developed an oil field CO2 flow rate system by 
combining pressure, temperature and differential pressure 
measurements with gas chromatography. The improved system 
had an accuracy of 0.6%, compared to 8% for the conventional 
system. Standards for measurement accuracy vary and are 
usually established by governments or industrial associations. 
For example, in the United States, current auditing practices for 
CO2-EOR accept flow meter precision of ±4%.
 
Measurements of injection pressure at the surface and in 
the formation are also routine. Pressure gauges are installed 
on most injection wells through orifices in the surface piping 
near the wellhead. Downhole pressure measurements are 
routine, but are used for injection well testing or under 
special circumstances in which surface measurements do not 
provide reliable information about the downhole pressure. 
A wide variety of pressure sensors are available and suitable 
for monitoring pressures at the wellhead or in the formation. 
Continuous data are available and typically transmitted to 
a central control room. Surface pressure gauges are often 
connected to shut-off valves that will stop or curtail injection 
if the pressure exceeds a predetermined safe threshold or if 
there is a drop in pressure as a result of a leak. In effect, surface 
pressures can be used to ensure that downhole pressures do not 
exceed the threshold of reservoir fracture pressure. A relatively 
recent innovation, fibre-optic pressure and temperature sensors, 
is commercially available. Fibre-optic cables are lowered into 
the wells, connected to sensors and provide real-time formation 
pressure and temperature measurements. These new systems 
are expected to provide more reliable measurements and well 
control.
 
The current state of the technology is more than adequate 
to meet the needs for monitoring injection rates, wellhead and 
formation pressures. Combined with temperature measurements, 
the collected data will provide information on the state of the 
CO2 (supercritical, liquid or gas) and accurate measurement 
of the amount of CO2 injected for inventories, reporting and 
verification, as well as input to modelling. In the case of the 
Weyburn project, for example, the gas stream is also analyzed to 
determine the impurities in the CO2, thus allowing computation 
of the volume of CO2 injected.
5.6.3 
Technologies for monitoring subsurface 
distribution of CO2
A number of techniques can be used to monitor the distribution 
and migration of CO2 in the subsurface. Table 5.4 summarizes 
these techniques and how they can be applied to CO2 storage 
projects. The applicability and sensitivity of these techniques 
are somewhat site-specific. Detailed descriptions, including 
limitations and resolution, are provided in Sections 5.6.3.1 and 
5.6.3.2.
5.6.3.1 
Direct techniques for monitoring CO2 migration
Direct techniques for monitoring are limited in availability at 
present. During CO2 injection for EOR, the injected CO2 spreads 
through the reservoir in a heterogeneous manner, because of 
permeability variations in the reservoir (Moberg et al., 2003). In 
the case of CO2-EOR, once the CO2 reaches a production well, 
its produced volume can be readily determined. In the case of 
Weyburn, the carbon in the injected CO2 has a different isotopic 
composition from the carbon in the reservoir (Emberley et al., 
2002), so the distribution of the CO2 can be determined on a 
gross basis by evaluating the arrival of the introduced CO2 at 
different production wells. With multiple injection wells in 
any producing area, the arrival of CO2 can give only a general 
indication of distribution in the reservoir.
236
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
 
A more accurate approach is to use tracers (gases or gas 
isotopes not present in the reservoir system) injected into specific 
wells. The timing of the arrival of the tracers at production 
or monitoring wells will indicate the path the CO2 is taking 
through the reservoir. Monitoring wells may also be used to 
passively record the movement of CO2 past the well, although 
it should be noted that the use of such invasive techniques 
potentially creates new pathways for leakage to the surface. The 
movement of tracers or isotopically distinct carbon (in the CO2) 
to production or monitoring wells provides some indication of 
the lateral distribution of the CO2 in a storage reservoir. In thick 
formations, multiple sampling along vertical monitoring or 
production wells would provide some indication of the vertical 
distribution of the CO2 in the formation. With many wells and 
frequently in horizontal wells, the lack of casing (open hole 
completion) precludes direct measurement of the location of 
CO2 influx along the length of the well, although it may be 
possible to run surveys to identify the location of major influx. 
 
Direct measurement of migration beyond the storage site 
can be achieved in a number of ways, depending on where the 
migration takes the CO2. Comparison between baseline surveys 
of water quality and/or isotopic composition can be used to 
identify new CO2 arrival at a specific location from natural CO2 
pre-existing at that site. Geochemical techniques can also be used 
to understand more about the CO2 and its movement through 
the reservoir (Czernichowski-Lauriol et al., 1996; Gunter et al., 
2000; Wilson and Monea, 2005). The chemical changes that 
occur in the reservoir fluids indicate the increase in acidity and 
the chemical effects of this change, in particular the bicarbonate 
ion levels in the fluids. At the surface, direct measurement can

be undertaken by sampling for CO2 or tracers in soil gas and 
near surface water-bearing horizons (from existing water wells 
or new observation wells). Surface CO2 fluxes may be directly 
measurable by techniques such as infrared spectroscopy (Miles 
et al., 2005; Pickles, 2005; Shuler and Tang, 2005). 
5.6.3.2 
Indirect techniques for monitoring CO2 migration
Indirect techniques for measuring CO2 distribution in the 
subsurface include a variety of seismic and non-seismic 
geophysical and geochemical techniques (Benson et al., 2004; 
Arts and Winthaegen, 2005; Hoversten and Gasperikova, 2005). 
Seismic techniques basically measure the velocity and energy 
absorption of waves, generated artificially or naturally, through 
rocks. The transmission is modified by the nature of the rock 
and its contained fluids. In general, energy waves are generated 
artificially by explosions or ground vibration. Wave generators 
and sensors may be on the surface (conventional seismic) or 
modified with the sensors in wells within the subsurface and 
the source on the surface (vertical seismic profiling). It is also 
possible to place both sensors and sources in the subsurface 
to transmit the wave pulses horizontally through the reservoir 
(inter-well or cross-well tomography). By taking a series of 
surveys over time, it is possible to trace the distribution of 
the CO2 in the reservoir, assuming the free-phase CO2 volume 
at the site is sufficiently high to identify from the processed 
data. A baseline survey with no CO2 present provides the basis 
against which comparisons can be made. It would appear that 
relatively low volumes of free-phase CO2 (approximately 5% 
or more) may be identified by these seismic techniques; at 
present, attempts are being made to quantify the amount of CO2 
in the pore space of the rocks and the distribution within the 
reservoir (Hoversten et al., 2003). A number of techniques have 
been actively tested at Weyburn (Section 5.6.3.3), including 
time-lapse surface three-dimensional seismic (both 3- and 9-
component), at one-year intervals (baseline and baseline plus 
one and two years), vertical seismic profiling and cross-well 
(horizontal and vertical) tomography between pairs of wells. 
 
For deep accumulations of CO2 in the subsurface, where 
CO2 density approaches the density of fluids in the storage 
formation, the sensitivity of surface seismic profiles would 
suggest that resolution on the order of 2500–10,000 t of free-
phase CO2 can be identified (Myer et al., 2003; White et al., 
2004; Arts et al., 2005). At Weyburn, areas with low injection 
rates (<2% hydrocarbon pore volume) demonstrate little or no 
visible seismic response. In areas with high injection rates (3–
13% hydrocarbon pore volume), significant seismic anomalies 
are observed. Work at Sleipner shows that the CO2 plume 
comprises several distinct layers of CO2, each up to about 10 
m thick. These are mostly beneath the strict limit of seismic 
resolution, but amplitude studies suggest that layer thicknesses 
as low as 1 m can be mapped (Arts et al., 2005; Chadwick et 
al., 2005). Seismic resolution will decrease with depth and 
certain other rock-related properties, so the above discussion of 
resolution will not apply uniformly in all storage scenarios. One 
possible way of increasing the accuracy of surveys over time 
is to create a permanent array of sensors or even sensors and 
energy sources (US Patent 6813566), to eliminate the problems 
associated with surveying locations for sensors and energy 
sources. 
 
For CO2 that has migrated even shallower in the subsurface, 
its gas-like properties will vastly increase the detection limit; 
hence, even smaller threshold levels of resolution are expected. 
To date, no quantitative studies have been performed to establish 
precise detection levels. However, the high compressibility of 
CO2 gas, combined with its low density, indicate that much 
lower levels of detection should be possible.
 
The use of passive seismic (microseismic) techniques 
also has potential value. Passive seismic monitoring detects 
microseismic events induced in the reservoir by dynamic 
responses to the modification of pore pressures or the 
reactivation or creation of small fractures. These discrete 
microearthquakes, with magnitudes on the order of -4 to 0 on 
the Richter scale (Wilson and Monea, 2005), are picked up by 
static arrays of sensors, often cemented into abandoned wells. 
These microseismic events are extremely small, but monitoring 
the microseismic events may allow the tracking of pressure 
changes and, possibly, the movement of gas in the reservoir or 
saline formation.
 
Non-seismic geophysical techniques include the use of 
electrical and electromagnetic and self-potential techniques 
(Benson et al., 2004; Hoversten and Gasperikova, 2005). In 
addition, gravity techniques (ground or air-based) can be used 
to determine the migration of the CO2 plume in the subsurface. 
Finally, tiltmeters or remote methods (geospatial surveys from 
aircraft or satellites) for measuring ground distortion may be 
used in some environments to assess subsurface movement of 
the plume. Tiltmeters and other techniques are most applicable 
in areas where natural variations in the surface, such as frost 
heave or wetting-drying cycles, do not mask the changes that 
occur from pressure changes. Gravity measurements will 
respond to changes in the subsurface brought on by density 
changes caused by the displacement of one fluid by another of 
different density (e.g., CO2 replacing water). Gravity is used 
with numerical modelling to infer those changes in density 
that best fit the observed data. The estimations of Benson et 
al. (2004) suggest that gravity will not have the same level of 
resolution as seismic, with minimum levels of CO2 needed for 
detection on the order of several hundred thousand tonnes (an 
order of magnitude greater than seismic). This may be adequate 
for plume movement, but not for the early definition of possible 
leaks. A seabed gravity survey was acquired at Sleipner in 2002 
and a repeat survey is planned for 2005. Results from these 
surveys have not yet been published. 
 
Electrical and electromagnetic techniques measure the 
conducting of the subsurface. Conductivity changes created 
by a change in the fluid, particularly the displacement of high 
conductivity saline waters with low-conductive CO2, can be 
detected by electrical or electromagnetic surveys. In addition 
to traditional electrical or electromagnetic techniques, the self-
potential the natural electrical potential of the Earth can be 
measured to determine plume migration. The injection of CO2 
will enhance fluid flow in the rock. This flow can produce an 
238
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
electrical potential that is measured against a reference electrode. 
This technique is low cost, but is also of low resolution. It can, 
however, be a useful tool for measuring the plume movement. 
According to Hoversten and Gasperikova (2005), this technique 
will require more work to determine its resolution and overall 
effectiveness.
5.6.3.3 
Monitoring case study: IEA-GHG Weyburn 
Monitoring and Storage Project
At Weyburn (Box 5.3), a monitoring programme was added to 
a commercial EOR project to develop and evaluate methods 
for tracking CO2. Baseline data was collected prior to CO2 
injection (beginning in late 2000). These data included fluid 
samples (water and oil) and seismic surveys. Two levels of 
seismic surveys were undertaken, with an extensive three-
dimensional (3D), 3-component survey over the original 
injection area and a detailed 3D, 9-component survey over a 
limited portion of the injection area. In addition, vertical seismic 
profiling and cross-well seismic tomography (between two 
vertical or horizontal wells) was undertaken. Passive seismic 
(microseismic) monitoring has recently been installed at the 
site. Other monitoring includes surface gas surveys (Strutt et 
al., 2003) and potable water monitoring (the Weyburn field 
underlies an area with limited surface water availability, so 
groundwater provides the major potable water supply). Injected 
volumes (CO2 and water) were also monitored. Any leaks from 
surface facilities are carefully monitored. Additionally, several 
wells were converted to observation wells to allow access to the 
reservoir. Subsequently, one well was abandoned, but seismic 
monitors were cemented into place in the well for passive 
seismic monitoring to be undertaken.
 
Since injection began, reservoir fluids have been regularly 
collected and analyzed. Analysis includes chemical and isotopic 
analyses of reservoir water samples, as well as maintaining an 
understanding of miscibility relationships between the oil and 
the injected CO2. Several seismic surveys have been conducted 
(one year and two years after injection of CO2 was initiated) with 
the processed data clearly showing the movement of CO2 in the 
reservoir. Annual surface analysis of soil gas is also continuing 
(Strutt et al., 2003), as is analysis of near-surface water. 
The analyses are being synthesized to gain a comprehensive 
knowledge of CO2 migration in the reservoir, to understand 
Figure 5.24  The produced water chemistry before CO2 injection and the produced water chemistry after 12 months and 31 months of injection

geochemical interactions with the reservoir rock and to clearly 
identify the integrity of the reservoir as a container for long-
term storage. Additionally, there is a programme to evaluate the 
potential role of existing active and abandoned wells in leakage. 
This includes an analysis of the age of the wells, the use of 
existing information on cement type and bonding effectiveness 
and work to better understand the effect of historical and 
changing fluid chemistry on the cement and steel casing of the 
well.
 
The Weyburn summary report (Wilson and Monea, 2005) 
describes the overall results of the research project, in particular 
the effectiveness of the seismic monitoring for determining 
the spread of CO2 and of the geochemical analysis for 
determining when CO2 was about to reach the production wells. 
Geochemical data also help explain the processes under way 
in the reservoir itself and the time required to establish a new 
chemical equilibrium. Figure 5.24 illustrates the change in the 
chemical composition of the formation water, which forms the 
basis for assessing the extent to which solubility and mineral 
trapping will contribute to long-term storage security (Perkins 
et al., 2005). The initial change in δ13CHCO3 is the result of the 
supercritical CO2 dissolving into the water. This change is then 
muted by the short-term dissolution of reservoir carbonate 
minerals, as indicated by the increase of calcium concentration, 
shown in Figure 5.24. In particular, the geochemistry confirms 
the storage of CO2 in water in the bicarbonate phase and also 
CO2 in the oil phase. 
5.6.4 
Technologies for monitoring injection well 
integrity
A number of standard technologies are available for monitoring 
the integrity of active injection wells. Cement bond logs are used 
to assess the bond and the continuity of the cement around well 
casing. Periodic cement bond logs can help detect deterioration 
in the cemented portion of the well and may also indicate any 
chemical interaction of the acidized formation fluids with the 
cement. The initial use of cement bond logs as part of the well-
integrity testing can indicate problems with bonding and even 
the absence of cement.
 
Prior to converting a well to other uses, such as CO2 injection, 
the well usually undergoes testing to ensure its integrity under 
pressure. These tests are relatively straightforward, with the 
well being sealed top and bottom (or in the zone to be tested), 
pressured up and its ability to hold pressure measured. In 
general, particularly on land, the well will be abandoned if 
it fails the test and a new well will be drilled, as opposed to 
attempting any remediation on the defective well. 
 
Injection takes place through a pipe that is lowered into the 
well and packed off above the perforations or open-hole portion 
of the well to ensure that the injectant reaches the appropriate 
level. The pressure in the annulus, the space between the casing 
and the injection pipe, can be monitored to ensure the integrity 
of the packer, casing and the injection pipe. Changes in pressure 
or gas composition in the annulus will alert the operator to 
problems.
 
As noted above, the injection pressure is carefully 
monitored to ensure that there are no problems. A rapid increase 
in pressure could indicate problems with the well, although 
industry interpretations suggest that it is more likely to be loss 
of injectivity in the reservoir.
 
Temperature logs and ‘noise’ logs are also often run on 
a routine basis to detect well failures in natural gas storage 
projects. Rapid changes in temperature along the length of 
the wellbore are diagnostic of casing leaks. Similarly, ‘noise’ 
associated with leaks in the injection tubing can be used to 
locate small leaks (Lippmann and Benson, 2003).
5.6.5 
Technologies for monitoring local environmental 
effects
5.6.5.1 
Groundwater
If CO2 leaks from the deep geological storage formation 
and migrates upwards into overlying shallow groundwater 
aquifers, methods are available to detect and assess changes 
in groundwater quality. Of course, it is preferable to identify 
leakage shortly after it leaks and long before the CO2 enters 
the groundwater aquifer, so that measures can be taken to 
intervene and prevent further migration (see Section 5.7.6). 
Seismic monitoring methods and potentially others (described 
in Section 5.6.3.2), can be used to identify leaks before the CO2 
reaches the groundwater zone. 
 
Nevertheless, if CO2 does migrate into a groundwater 
aquifer, potential impacts can be assessed by collecting 
groundwater samples and analyzing them for major ions (e.g., 
Na, K, Ca, Mg, Mn, Cl, Si, HCO3
– and SO4
2–), pH, alkalinity, 
stable isotopes (e.g., 13C, 14C, 18O, 2H) and gases, including 
hydrocarbon gases, CO2 and its associated isotopes (Gunter et 
al., 1998). Additionally, if shallow groundwater contamination 
occurs, samples could be analyzed for trace elements such as 
arsenic and lead, which are mobilized by acidic water (Section 
5.5). Methods such as atomic absorption and inductively 
coupled plasma mass spectroscopy self-potential can be used 
to accurately measure water quality. Less sensitive field tests 
or other analytical methods are also available (Clesceri et al., 
1998). Standard analytical methods are available to monitor 
all of these parameters, including the possibility of continuous 
real-time monitoring for some of the geochemical parameters.
 
Natural tracers (isotopes of C, O, H and noble gases 
associated with the injected CO2) and introduced tracers (noble 
gases, SF6 and perfluorocarbons) also may provide insight into 
the impacts of storage projects on groundwater (Emberley et al., 
2002; Nimz and Hudson, 2005). (SF6 and perfluorocarbons are 
greenhouse gases with extremely high global warming potentials 
and therefore caution is warranted in the use of these gases, to 
avoid their release to the atmosphere.) Natural tracers such as 
C and O isotopes may be able to link changes in groundwater 
quality directly to the stored CO2 by ‘fingerprinting’ the CO2, 
thus distinguishing storage-induced changes from changes 
in groundwater quality caused by other factors. Introduced 
tracers such as perfluorocarbons that can be detected at very 
low concentrations (1 part per trillion) may also be useful for 
240
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
determining whether CO2 has leaked and is responsible for 
changes in groundwater quality. Synthetic tracers could be 
added periodically to determine movement in the reservoir or 
leakage paths, while natural tracers are present in the reservoir 
or introduced gases.
5.6.5.2�
Air�quality�and�atmospheric�fluxes
Continuous sensors for monitoring CO2 in air are used in a 
variety of applications, including HVAC (heating, ventilation 
and air conditioning) systems, greenhouses, combustion 
emissions measurement and environments in which CO2 is a 
significant hazard (such as breweries). Such devices rely on 
infrared detection principles and are referred to as infrared 
gas analyzers. These gas analyzers are small and portable 
and commonly used in occupational settings. Most use non-
dispersive infrared or Fourier Transform infrared detectors. 
Both methods use light attenuation by CO2 at a specific 
wavelength, usually 4.26 microns. For extra assurance and 
validation of real-time monitoring data, US regulatory bodies, 
such as NIOSH, OSHA and the EPA, use periodic concentration 
measurement by gas chromatography. Mass spectrometry is the 
most accurate method for measuring CO2 concentration, but 
it is also the least portable. Electrochemical solid state CO2 
detectors exist, but they are not cost effective at this time (e.g., 
Tamura et al., 2001).
 
Common field applications in environmental science 
include the measurement of CO2 concentrations in soil air, 
flux from soils and ecosystem-scale carbon dynamics. Diffuse 
soil flux measurements are made by simple infrared analyzers 
(Oskarsson et al., 1999). The USGS measures CO2 flux on 
Mammoth Mountain, in California (Sorey et al., 1996; USGS, 
2001b). Biogeochemists studying ecosystem-scale carbon 
cycling use data from CO2 detectors on 2 to 5 m tall towers 
with wind and temperature data to reconstruct average CO2 flux 
over large areas. 
 
Miles et al. (2005) concluded that eddy covariance is 
promising for the monitoring of CO2 storage projects, both for 
hazardous leaks and for leaks that would damage the economic 
viability of geological storage. For a storage project of 100 Mt, 
Miles et al. (2005) estimate that, for leakage rates of 0.01% 
yr-1, fluxes will range from 1 to 104 times the magnitude of 
typical ecological fluxes (depending on the size of the area 
over which CO2 is leaking). Note that a leakage rate of 0.01%  
yr-1 is equivalent to a fraction retained of 90% over 1000 years. 
This should easily be detectable if background ecological 
fluxes are measured in advance to determine diurnal and annual 
cycles. However, with the technology currently available to us, 
quantifying leakage rates for tracking returns to the atmosphere 
is likely to be more of a challenge than identifying leaks in the 
storage reservoir. 
 
Satellite-based remote sensing of CO2 releases to the 
atmosphere may also be possible, but this method remains 
challenging because of the long path length through the 
atmosphere over which CO2 is measured and the inherent 
variability of atmospheric CO2. Infrared detectors measure 
average CO2 concentration over a given path length, so a 
diffuse or low-level leak viewed through the atmosphere by 
satellite would be undetectable. As an example, even large 
CO2 seeps, such as that at Mammoth Mountain, are difficult 
to identify today (Martini and Silver, 2002; Pickles, 2005). 
Aeroplane-based measurement using this same principle may 
be possible. Carbon dioxide has been measured either directly 
in the plume by a separate infrared detector or calculated from 
SO2 measurements and direct ground sampling of the SO2:
CO2 ratio for a given volcano or event (Hobbs et al., 1991; 
USGS, 2001b). Remote-sensing techniques currently under 
investigation for CO2 detection are LIDAR (light detection and 
range-finding), a scanning airborne laser and DIAL (differential 
absorption LIDAR), which looks at reflections from multiple 
lasers at different frequencies (Hobbs et al., 1991; Menzies et 
al., 2001).
 
In summary, monitoring of CO2 for occupational safety 
is well established. On the other hand, while some promising 
technologies are under development for environmental 
monitoring and leak detection, measurement and monitoring 
approaches on the temporal and space scales relevant to 
geological storage need improvement to be truly effective.
5.6.5.3 
Ecosystems
The health of terrestrial and subsurface ecosystems can 
be determined directly by measuring the productivity and 
biodiversity of flora and fauna and in some cases (such as at 
Mammoth Mountain in California) indirectly by using remote-
sensing techniques such as hyperspectral imaging (Martini 
and Silver, 2002; Onstott, 2005; Pickles, 2005). In many areas 
with natural CO2 seeps, even those with very low CO2 fluxes, 
the seeps are generally quite conspicuous features. They are 
easily recognized in populated areas, both in agriculture and 
natural vegetation, by reduced plant growth and the presence 
of precipitants of minerals leached from rocks by acidic 
water. Therefore, any conspicuous site could be quickly and 
easily checked for excess CO2 concentrations without any 
large remote-sensing ecosystem studies or surveys. However, 
in desert environments where vegetation is sparse, direct 
observation may not be possible. In addition to direct ecosystem 
observations, analyses of soil gas composition and soil 
mineralogy can be used to indicate the presence of CO2 and its 
impact on soil properties. Detection of elevated concentrations 
of CO2 or evidence of excessive soil weathering would indicate 
the potential for ecosystem impacts. 
 
For aquatic ecosystems, water quality and in particular low 
pH, would provide a diagnostic for potential impacts. Direct 
measurements of ecosystem productivity and biodiversity can 
also be obtained by using standard techniques developed for 
lakes and marine ecosystems. See Chapter 6 for additional 
discussion about the impact of elevated CO2 concentrations on 
marine environments.
Chapter 5: Underground geological storage
241
5.6.6 
Monitoring network design
There are currently no standard protocols or established network 
designs for monitoring leakage of CO2. Monitoring network 
design will depend on the objectives and requirements of the 
monitoring programme, which will be determined by regulatory 
requirements and perceived risks posed by the site (Chalaturnyk 
and Gunter, 2005). For example, current monitoring for EOR 
is designed to assess the sweep efficiency of the solvent flood 
and to deal with health and safety issues. In this regard, the 
monitoring designed for the Weyburn Project uses seismic 
surveys to determine the lateral migration of CO2 over time. 
This is compared with the simulations undertaken to design the 
operational practices of the CO2 flood. For health and safety, the 
programme is designed to test groundwater for contamination 
and to monitor for gas buildup in working areas of the field to 
ensure worker safety. The surface procedure also uses pressure 
monitoring to ensure that the fracture pressure of the formation 
is not exceeded (Chalaturnyk and Gunter, 2005).
 
The Weyburn Project is designed to assess the integrity of an 
oil reservoir for long-term storage of CO2 (Wilson and Monea, 
2005). In this regard, the demonstrated ability of seismic 
surveys to measure migration of CO2 within the formation is 
important, but in the long term it may be more important to 
detect CO2 that has leaked out of the storage reservoir. In this 
case, the monitoring programme should be designed to achieve 
the resolution and sensitivity needed to detect CO2 that has 
leaked out of the reservoir and is migrating vertically. The use of 
geochemical monitoring will determine the rate of dissolution 
of the CO2 into fluids and the capacity of the minerals within 
the reservoir to react with the CO2 and permanently store it. 
For identification of potential CO2 leaks, monitoring includes 
soil gas and groundwater surveys. The soil gas surveys use a 
grid pattern superimposed on the field to evaluate any change 
in gas chemistry. Because grid patterns may miss narrow, linear 
anomalies, the study also looks at the pattern of linear anomalies 
on the surface that may reflect deeper fault and fracture systems, 
which could become natural migration pathways.
 
Current projects, in particular Sleipner and Weyburn, are 
testing a variety of techniques to determine those that are most 
effective and least costly. In Western Canada, acid-gas injection 
wells use pressure monitoring and set maximum wellhead 
injection pressures to ensure that reservoir fracture pressures are 
not exceeded. No subsurface monitoring is currently required 
for these projects. Chalaturnyk and Gunter (2005) suggest that 
an effectively designed monitoring programme should allow 
decisions to be made in the future that are based on ongoing 
interpretation of the data. The data from the programme should 
also provide the information necessary to decrease uncertainties 
over time or increase monitoring demand if things develop 
unexpectedly. The corollary to this is that unexpected changes 
may result in the requirement of increased monitoring until new 
uncertainties are resolved.
5.6.7 
Long-term stewardship monitoring
The purpose of long-term monitoring is to identify movement 
of CO2 that may lead to releases that could impact long-term 
storage security and safety, as well as trigger the need for 
remedial action. Long-term monitoring can be accomplished 
with the same suite of monitoring technologies used during 
the injection phase. However, at the present time, there are 
no established protocols for the kind of monitoring that will 
be required, by whom, for how long and with what purpose. 
Geological storage of CO2 may persist over many millions 
of years. The long duration of storage raises some questions 
about long-term monitoring – an issue that is also addressed in 
Section 5.8.
 
Several studies have attempted to address these issues. Keith 
and Wilson (2002) have proposed that governments assume 
responsibility for monitoring after the active phase of the storage 
project is over, as long as all regulatory requirements have been 
met during operation. This study did not, however, specify long-
term requirements for monitoring. Though perhaps somewhat 
impractical in terms of implementation, White et al. (2003) 
suggested that monitoring might be required for thousands of 
years. An alternative point of view is presented by Chow et al. 
(2003) and Benson et al. (2004), who suggest that once it has 
been demonstrated that the plume of CO2 is no longer moving, 
further monitoring should not be required. The rationale for this 
point of view is that long-term monitoring provides little value 
if the plume is no longer migrating or the cessation of migration 
can be accurately predicted and verified by a combination of 
modelling and short- to mid-term monitoring.
 
If and when long-term monitoring is required, cost-effective, 
easily deployed methods for monitoring will be preferred. 
Methods that do not require wells that penetrate the plume will 
be desirable, because they will not increase the risk of leakage 
up the monitoring well itself. Technologies are available today, 
such as 3D seismic imaging, that can provide satisfactory images 
of CO2 plume location. While seismic surveys are perceived to 
be costly, a recent study by Benson et al. (2004) suggests that 
this may be a misconception and indicates that monitoring costs 
on a discounted basis (10% discount rate) are likely to be no 
higher than 0.10 US$/tCO2 stored. However, seismic imaging 
has its limitations, as is evidenced by continued drilling of 
non-productive hydrocarbon wells, but confidence in its ability 
to meet most, but not all, of the needs of monitoring CO2 
storage projects is growing. Less expensive and more passive 
alternatives that could be deployed remotely, such as satellite-
based systems, may be desirable, but are not currently able to 
track underground migration. However, if CO2 has seeped to 
the surface, associated vegetative stress can be detected readily 
in some ecosystems (Martini and Silver, 2002).
 
Until long-term monitoring requirements are established 
(Stenhouse et al., 2005), it is not possible to evaluate which 
technology or combination of technologies for monitoring will 
be needed or desired. However, today’s technology could be 
deployed to continue monitoring the location of the CO2 plume 
over very long time periods with sufficient accuracy to assess 
242
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
the risk of the plume intersecting potential pathways, natural 
or human, out of the storage site into overlying zones. If CO2 
escapes from the primary storage reservoir with no prospect of 
remedial action to prevent leakage, technologies are available to 
monitor the consequent environmental impact on groundwater, 
soils, ecosystems and the atmosphere.
5.6.8 
Verification of CO2 injection and storage inventory
Verification as a topic is often combined with monitoring such 
as in the Storage, Monitoring and Verification (SMV) project of 
the Carbon Capture Project (CCP) or the Monitoring, Mitigation 
and Verification (MMV) subsection of the DOE-NETL Carbon 
Sequestration Technology Roadmap and Program Plan (NETL, 
2004). In view of this frequently-used combination of terms, 
there is some overlap in usage between the terms ‘verification’ 
and ‘monitoring’. For this report, ‘verification’ is defined as 
the set of activities used for assessing the amount of CO2 that 
is stored underground and for assessing how much, if any, is 
leaking back into the atmosphere.
 
No standard protocols have been developed specifically 
for verification of geological storage. However, experience at 
the Weyburn and Sleipner projects has demonstrated the utility 
of various techniques for most if not all aspects of verification 
(Wilson and Monea, 2005; Sleipner Best Practice Manual, 
2004). At the very least, verification will require measurement 
of the quantity of CO2 stored. Demonstrating that it remains 
within the storage site, from both a lateral and vertical migration 
perspective, is likely to require some combination of models 
and monitoring. Requirements may be site-specific, depending 
on the regulatory environment, requirements for economic 
instruments and the degree of risk of leakage. The oversight 
for verification may be handled by regulators, either directly 
or by independent third parties contracted by regulators under 
national law.
5.7 
Risk management, risk assessment and 
remediation
What are the risks of storing CO2 in deep geological formations? 
Can a geological storage site be operated safely? What are the 
safety concerns and environmental impact if a storage site leaks? 
Can a CO2 storage site be fixed if something does go wrong? 
These questions are addressed in this section of the report.
5.7.1 
Framework for assessing environmental risks
The environmental impacts arising from geological storage fall 
into two broad categories: local environmental effects and global 
effects arising from the release of stored CO2 to the atmosphere. 
Global effects of CO2 storage may be viewed as the uncertainty 
in the effectiveness of CO2 storage. Estimates of the likelihood 
of release to the atmosphere are discussed below (Section 5.7.3), 
while the policy implications of potential release from storage 
are discussed elsewhere (Chapters 1, 8 and 9).
Local health, safety and environmental hazards arise from three 
distinct causes: 
•� �Direct effects of elevated gas-phase CO2 concentrations in 
the shallow subsurface and near-surface environment;
•� �Effects of dissolved CO2 on groundwater chemistry;
•� �Effects that arise from the displacement of fluids by the 
injected CO2.
In this section, assessment of possible local and regional 
environmental hazards is organized by the kind of hazard (e.g., 
human health and ecosystem hazards are treated separately) and 
by the underlying physical mechanism (e.g., seismic hazards). 
For example, the discussion of hazards to groundwater quality 
includes effects that arise directly from the effect of dissolved 
CO2 in groundwater, as well as indirect effects resulting from 
contamination by displaced brines.
 
Risks are proportional to the magnitude of the potential 
hazards and the probability that these hazards will occur. For 
hazards that arise from locally elevated CO2 concentrations – in 
the near-surface atmosphere, soil gas or in aqueous solution 
– the risks depend on the probability of leakage from the deep 
storage site to the surface. Thus, most of the hazards described 
in Section 5.7.4 should be weighted by the probability of release 
described in Section 5.7.3. Regarding those risks associated 
with routine operation of the facility and well maintenance, such 
risks are expected to be comparable to CO2-EOR operations.
 
There are two important exceptions to the rule that risk is 
proportional to the probability of release. First, local impacts 
will be strongly dependent on the spatial and temporal 
distribution of fluxes and the resulting CO2 concentrations. 
Episodic and localized seepage will likely tend to have more 
significant impacts per unit of CO2 released than will seepage 
that is continuous and or spatially dispersed. Global impacts 
arising from release of CO2 to the atmosphere depend only on 
the average quantity released over time scales of decades to 
centuries. Second, the hazards arising from displacement, such 
as the risk of induced seismicity, are roughly independent of the 
probability of release.
 
Although we have limited experience with injection of CO2 
for the explicit purpose of avoiding atmospheric emissions, a 
wealth of closely related industrial experience and scientific 
knowledge exists that can serve as a basis for appropriate 
risk management. In addition to the discussion in this section, 
relevant industrial experience has been described in Sections 
5.1 to 5.6.
5.7.2 
Processes and pathways for release of CO2  from 
geological storage sites
Carbon dioxide that exists as a separate phase (supercritical, 
liquid or gas) may escape from formations used for geological 
storage through the following pathways (Figure 5.25):
•� �Through the pore system in low-permeability caprocks such 
as shales, if the capillary entry pressure at which CO2 may 
enter the caprock is exceeded;
•� Through openings in the caprock or fractures and faults;
Chapter 5: Underground geological storage
243
•� �Through anthropomorphic pathways, such as poorly 
completed and/or abandoned pre-existing wells.
For onshore storage sites, CO2 that has leaked may reach the 
water table and migrate into the overlying vadose zone. This 
occurrence would likely include CO2 contact with drinking-
water aquifers. Depending on the mineral composition of 
the rock matrix within the groundwater aquifer or vadose 
zone, the reaction of CO2 with the rock matrix could release 
contaminants. The US Environmental Protection Agency 
(USEPA) has witnessed problems with projects designed to 
replenish groundwater with rainfall wherein mineralized (fixed) 
contaminants were inadvertently mobilized in concentrations 
sufficient to cause undesirable contamination.
 
The vadose zone is only partly saturated with water; the 
rest of the pore space is filled with soil gas (air). Because it is 
heavier than air, CO2 will displace ambient soil gas, leading to 
concentrations that locally may potentially approach 100% in 
parts of the vadose zone, even for small leakage fluxes. The 
dissipating effects of seepage into the surface layer are controlled 
mostly by pressure-driven flow and diffusion (Oldenburg and 
Unger, 2003). These occur predominantly in most shallow 
parts of the vadose zone, leaving the deeper part of the vadose 
zone potentially subject to accumulation of leaking CO2. The 
processes of CO2 migration in the vadose zone can be modelled, 
subject to limitations in the characterization of actual complex 
vadose zone and CO2 leakage scenarios. 
 
For storage sites that are offshore, CO2 that has leaked may 
reach the ocean bottom sediments and then, if lighter than the 
surrounding water, migrate up through the water column until 
it reaches the atmosphere. Depending upon the leakage rate, it 
may either remain as a separate phase or completely dissolve 
into the water column. When CO2 dissolves, biological impacts 
to ocean bottom and marine organisms will be of concern. For 
those sites where separate-phase CO2 reaches the ocean surface, 
hazards to offshore platform workers may be of concern for 
very large and sudden release rates. 
 
Once through the vadose zone, escaping CO2 reaches the 
surface layer of the atmosphere and the surface environment, 
where humans and other animals can be exposed to it. Carbon 
dioxide dispersion and mixing result from surface winds and 
associated turbulence and eddies. As a result, CO2 concentrations 
diminish rapidly with elevation, meaning that ground-dwelling 
animals are more likely to be affected by exposure than are 
humans (Oldenburg and Unger, 2004). Calm conditions and 
local topography capable of containing the dense gas will tend 
to prevent mixing. But such conditions are the exception and in 
general, the surface layer can be counted on to strongly dilute 
seeping CO2. Nevertheless, potential concerns related to buildup 
of CO2 concentrations on calm days must be carefully considered 
in any risk assessment of a CO2 storage site. Additionally, high 
subsurface CO2 concentrations may accumulate in basements, 
subsurface vaults and other subsurface infrastructures where 
humans may be exposed to risk.
 
Carbon dioxide injected into coal seams can escape only 
if it is in free phase (i.e., not adsorbed onto the coal) via the 
following pathways (Wo and Liang 2005; Wo et al. 2005): flow 
into surrounding strata during injection when high pressures are 
used to inject CO2 into low-permeability coal, either where the 
cleat system reaches the top of the seam or via hydrofractures 
induced to improve the contact between the cleat system and 
CBM production wells; through faults or other natural pathways 
intersecting the coal seam; via poorly abandoned coal or CBM 
exploration wells; and through anthropomorphic pathways such 
Figure 5.25  Some potential escape routes for CO2 injected into saline formations.

as coal mines or mining-induced subsidence cracks. 
 
In general, however, CO2 retained by sorption onto coal will 
remain confined to the seam even without caprocks, unless the 
pressure in the coal seam is reduced (e.g., by mining). Changes 
in pressure and/or temperature lead to changes in the maximum 
gas content. If the pressure drops markedly, any excess CO2 
may desorb from the coal and flow freely through cleats.
 
Injection wells and abandoned wells have been identified 
as one of the most probable leakage pathways for CO2 storage 
projects (Gasda et al., 2004; Benson, 2005). When a well is 
drilled, a continuous, open conduit is created between the land 
surface and the deep subsurface. If, at the time of drilling, 
the operator decides that the target formation does not look 
sufficiently productive, then the well is abandoned as a ‘dry 
hole’, in accordance with proper regulatory guidelines. Current 
guidelines typically require filling sections of the hole with 
cement (Section 5.5 and Figure 5.21). 
 
Drilling and completion of a well involve not only creation 
of a hole in the Earth, but also the introduction of engineered 
materials into the subsurface, such as well cements and well 
casing. The overall effect of well drilling is replacement of 
small but potentially significant cylindrical volumes of rock, 
including low-permeability caprock, with anthropomorphic 
materials that have properties different from those of the original 
materials. A number of possible leakage pathways can occur 
along abandoned wells, as illustrated in Figure 5.26 (Gasda et 
al., 2004). These include leakage between the cement and the 
outside of the casing (Figure 5.26a), between the cement and 
the inside of the metal casing (Figure 5.26b), within the cement 
plug itself (Figure 5.26c), through deterioration (corrosion) of 
the metal casing (Figure 5.26d), deterioration of the cement in 
the annulus (Figure 5.26e) and leakage in the annular region 
between the formation and the cement (Figure 5.26f). The 
potential for long-term degradation of cement and metal casing 
in the presence of CO2 is a topic of extensive investigations at 
this time (e.g., Scherer et al., 2005).
 
The risk of leakage through abandoned wells is proportional 
to the number of wells intersected by the CO2 plume, their depth 
and the abandonment method used. For mature sedimentary 
basins, the number of wells in proximity to a possible injection 
well can be large, on the order of many hundreds. For example, 
in the Alberta Basin in western Canada, more than 350,000 wells 
have been drilled. Currently, drilling continues at the rate of 
approximately 20,000 wells per year. The wells are distributed 
spatially in clusters, with densities that average around four 
wells per km2 (Gasda et al., 2004). Worldwide well densities 
are provided in Figure 5.27 and illustrate that many areas have 
much lower well density. Nevertheless, the data provided in 
Figure 5.27 illustrate an important point made in Section 5.3 
– namely that storage security in mature oil and gas provinces 
may be compromised if a large number of wells penetrate the 
caprocks. Steps need to be taken to address this potential risk. 
5.7.3 
Probability of release from geological storage sites
Storage sites will presumably be designed to confine all injected 
CO2 for geological time scales. Nevertheless, experience with 
engineered systems suggest a small fraction of operational 
storage sites may release CO2 to the atmosphere. No existing 
studies systematically estimate the probability and magnitude 
of release across a sample of credible geological storage 
systems. In the absence of such studies, this section synthesizes 
the lines of evidence that enable rough quantitative estimates of 
achievable fractions retained in storage. Five kinds of evidence 
are relevant to assessing storage effectiveness:
•� �Data from natural systems, including trapped accumulations 
of natural gas and CO2, as well as oil;
•� �Data from engineered systems, including natural gas storage, 
gas re-injection for pressure support, CO2 or miscible 
hydrocarbon EOR, disposal of acid gases and disposal of 
other fluids;
•� �Fundamental physical, chemical and mechanical processes 
regarding the fate and transport of CO2 in the subsurface;
•� Results from numerical models of CO2 transport;
•� Results from current geological storage projects.
5.7.3.1 
Natural systems
Natural systems allow inferences about the quality and quantity 
of geological formations that could be used to store CO2. The 
widespread presence of oil, gas and CO2 trapped in formations 
for many millions of years implies that within sedimentary 
basins, impermeable formations (caprocks) of sufficient quality 
to confine CO2 for geological time periods are present. For 
example, the about 200 MtCO2 trapped in the Pisgah Anticline, 
northeast of the Jackson Dome (Mississippi), is thought to have 
been generated in Late Cretaceous times, more than 65 million 
Figure 5.26  Possible leakage pathways in an abandoned well: (a) and 
(b) between casing and cement wall and plug, respectively; (c) through 
cement plugs; (d) through casing; (e) through cement wall; and (f) 
between the cement wall and rock (after Gasda et al., 2004).

years ago (Studlick et al., 1990). Retention times longer than 
10 million years are found in many of the world’s petroleum 
basins (Bradshaw et al., 2005). Therefore evidence from natural 
systems demonstrates that reservoir seals exist that are able to 
confine CO2 for millions of years and longer.
5.7.3.2 
Engineered systems
Evidence from natural gas storage systems enables performance 
assessments of engineered barriers (wells and associated 
management and remediation) and of the performance of natural 
systems that have been altered by pressure cycling (Lippmann 
and Benson, 2003; Perry, 2005). Approximately 470 natural gas 
storage facilities are currently operating in the United States 
with a total storage capacity exceeding 160 Mt natural gas 
(Figure 5.12). There have been nine documented incidents of 
significant leakage: five were related to wellbore integrity, each 
of which was resolved by reworking the wells; three arose from 
leaks in caprocks, two of which were remediated and one of 
which led to project abandonment. The final incident involved 
early project abandonment owing to poor site selection (Perry, 
2005). There are no estimates of the total volumes of gas lost 
resulting from leakage across all the projects. In one recent 
serious example of leakage, involving wellbore failure at a 
facility in Kansas, the total mass released was about 3000 t (Lee, 
2001), equal to less than 0.002% of the total gas in storage in 
the United States and Canada. The capacity-weighted median 
age of the approximately 470 facilities exceeds 25 years. Given 
that the Kansas failure was among the worst in the cumulative 
operating history of gas storage facilities, the average annual 
release rates, expressed as a fraction of stored gas released per 
year, are likely below 10–5. While such estimates of the expected 
(or statistical average) release rates are a useful measure of 
storage effectiveness, they should not be interpreted as implying 
that release will be a continuous process. 
 
The performance of natural gas storage systems may be 
regarded as a lower bound on that of CO2 storage. One reason for 
this is that natural gas systems are designed for (and subject to) 
rapid pressure cycling that increases the probability of caprock 
leakage. On the other hand, CO2 will dissolve in pore waters (if 
present), thereby reducing the risk of leakage. Perhaps the only 
respect in which gas storage systems present lower risks is that 
CH4 is less corrosive than CO2 to metallic components, such 
as well casings. Risks are higher in the case of leakage from 
natural gas storage sites because of the flammable nature of the 
gas.
5.7.3.3 
Fundamental physical, chemical and mechanical 
processes regarding fate and transport of CO2 in the 
subsurface
As described in Section 5.2, scientific understanding of CO2 
storage and in particular performance of storage systems, rests 
on a large body of knowledge in hydrogeology, petroleum 
geology, reservoir engineering and related geosciences. Current 
evaluation has identified a number of processes that alone or in 
combination can result in very long-term storage. Specifically, 
the combination of structural and stratigraphic trapping of 
separate-phase CO2 below low-permeability caprocks, residual 
CO2 trapping, solubility trapping and mineral trapping can 
create secure storage over geological time scales.

Numerical simulations of long-term storage 
performance

IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
CO2 through the subsurface will be slow. For example, Cawley 
et al. (2005) studied the effect of uncertainties in parameters 
such as the flow velocity in the aquifer and capillary entry 
pressure into caprock in their examination of CO2 storage in 
the Forties Oilfield in the North Sea. Over the 1000 year time 
scale examined in their study, Cawley et al. (2005) found that 
less than 0.2% of the stored CO2 enters into the overlying layers 
and even in the worse case, the maximum vertical distance 
moved by any of the CO2 was less than halfway to the seabed. 
Similarly, Lindeberg and Bergmo (2003) studied the Sleipner 
field and found that CO2 would not begin to migrate into the 
North Sea for 100,000 years and that even after a million years, 
the annual rate of release would be about 10–6 of the stored CO2 
per year. 
 
Simulations designed to explore the possible release of stored 
CO2 to the biosphere by multiple routes, including abandoned 
wells and other disturbances, have recently become available 
as a component of more general risk assessment activities 
(Section 5.7.5). Two studies of the Weyburn site, for example, 
assessed the probability of release to the biosphere. Walton et 
al. (2005) used a fully probabilistic model, with a simplified 
representation of CO2 transport, to compute a probability 
distribution for the cumulative fraction released to the biosphere. 
Walton et al. found that after 5000 years, the probability was 
equal that the cumulative amount released would be larger or 
smaller than 0.1% (the median release fraction) and found a 
95% probability that <1% of the total amount stored would be 
released. Using a deterministic model of CO2 transport in the 
subsurface, Zhou et al. (2005) found no release to the biosphere 
in 5000 years. While using a probabilistic model of transport 
through abandoned wells, they found a statistical mean release 
of 0.001% and a maximum release of 0.14% (expressed as the 
cumulative fraction of stored CO2 released over 5000 years). 
 
In saline formations or oil and gas reservoirs with significant 
brine content, much of the CO2 will eventually dissolve in the 
brine (Figure 5.7), be trapped as a residual immobile phase 
(Figure 5.8) or be immobilized by geochemical reactions. 
The time scale for dissolution is typically short compared to 
the time for CO2 to migrate out of the storage formation by 
other processes (Ennis-King and Paterson, 2003; Lindeberg and 
Bergmo, 2003; Walton et al., 2005). It is expected that many 
storage projects could be selected and operated so that a very 
large fraction of the injected CO2 will dissolve. Once dissolved, 
CO2 can eventually be transported out of the injection site by 
basin-scale circulation or upward migration, but the time scales 
(millions of years) of such transport are typically sufficiently 
long that they can (arguably) be ignored in assessing the risk of 
leakage.
 
As described in Section 5.1, several CO2 storage projects are 
now in operation and being carefully monitored. While no leakage 
of stored CO2 out of the storage formations has been observed 
in any of the current projects, time is too short and overall 
monitoring too limited, to enable direct empirical conclusions 
about the long-term performance of geological storage. Rather 
than providing a direct test of performance, the current projects 
improve the quality of long-duration performance predictions 
by testing and sharpening understanding of CO2 transport and 
trapping mechanisms. 
5.7.3.5 
Assessing the ability of operational geological 
storage projects to retain CO2 for long time periods
Assessment of the fraction retained for geological storage 
projects is highly site-specific, depending on (1) the storage 
system design, including the geological characteristics of 
the selected storage site; (2) the injection system and related 
reservoir engineering; and (3) the methods of abandonment, 
including the performance of well-sealing technologies. If 
the above information is available, it is possible to estimate 
the fraction retained by using the models described in Section 
5.4.2 and risk assessment methods described in Section 
5.7.5. Therefore, it is also possible, in principle, to estimate 
the expected performance of an ensemble of storage projects 
that adhere to design guidelines such as site selection, seal 
integrity, injection depth and well closure technologies.  
Table 5.5 summarizes disparate lines of evidence on the integrity 
of CO2 storage systems.
 
For large-scale operational CO2 storage projects, assuming 
that sites are well selected, designed, operated and appropriately 
monitored, the balance of available evidence suggests the 
following: 
•� �It is very likely the fraction of stored CO2 retained is more 
than 99% over the first 100 years.
•� �It is likely the fraction of stored CO2 retained is more than 
99% over the first 1000 years.
5.7.4 
Possible local and regional environmental hazards
5.7.4.1 
Potential hazards to human health and safety
Risks to human health and safety arise (almost) exclusively from 
elevated CO2 concentrations in ambient air, either in confined 
outdoor environments, in caves or in buildings. Physiological 
and toxicological responses to elevated CO2 concentrations are 
relatively well understood (AI.3.3). At concentrations above 
about 2%, CO2 has a strong effect on respiratory physiology and 
at concentrations above 7–10%, it can cause unconsciousness 
and death. Exposure studies have not revealed any adverse 
health effect of chronic exposure to concentrations below 1%.
 
The principal challenge in estimating the risks posed by 
CO2 that might seep from storage sites lies in estimating the 
spatial and temporal distribution of CO2 fluxes reaching the 
shallow subsurface and in predicting ambient CO2 concentration 
resulting from a given CO2 flux. Concentrations in surface 
air will be strongly influenced by surface topography and 
atmospheric conditions. Because CO2 is 50% denser than air, 
it tends to migrate downwards, flowing along the ground and 
collecting in shallow depressions, potentially creating much 
higher concentrations in confined spaces than in open terrain.
 
Seepage of CO2 is not uncommon in regions influenced by 
volcanism. Naturally occurring releases of CO2 provide a basis 
for understanding the transport of CO2 from the vadose zone 
to the atmosphere, as well as providing empirical data that link 
CO2 fluxes into the shallow subsurface with CO2 concentrations 
Chapter 5: Underground geological storage
247
in the ambient air – and the consequent health and safety 
risks. Such seeps do not, however, provide a useful basis for 
estimating the spatial and temporal distribution of CO2 fluxes 
leaking from a deep storage site, because (in general) the seeps 
occur in highly fractured volcanic zones, unlike the interiors of 
stable sedimentary basins, the likely locations for CO2 storage 
(Section 5.3). 
 
Natural seeps are widely distributed in tectonically active 
regions of the world (Morner and Etiope, 2002). In central Italy, 
for example, CO2 is emitted from vents, surface degassing and 
diffuse emission from CO2-rich groundwater. Fluxes from 
vents range from less than 100 to more than 430 tCO2 day–1, 
which have shown to be lethal to animal and plants. At Poggio 
dell’Ulivo, for example, a flux of 200 tCO2 day–1 is emitted 
from diffuse soil degassing. At least ten people have died from 
CO2 releases in the region of Lazio over the last 20 years. 
 
Natural and engineered analogues show that it is possible, 
though improbable, that slow releases from CO2 storage 
reservoirs will pose a threat to humans. Sudden, catastrophic 
releases of natural accumulations of CO2 have occurred, 
associated with volcanism or subsurface mining activities. Thus, 
they are of limited relevance to understanding risks arising from 
CO2 stored in sedimentary basins. However, mining or drilling 
in areas with CO2 storage sites may pose a long-term risk after 
site abandonment if institutional knowledge and precautions 
are not in place to avoid accidentally penetrating a storage 
formation. 
5.7.4.2 
Hazards to groundwater from CO2 leakage and 
brine displacement
Increases in dissolved CO2 concentration that might occur 
as CO2 migrates from a storage reservoir to the surface will 
alter groundwater chemistry, potentially affecting shallow 
groundwater used for potable water and industrial and 
agricultural needs. Dissolved CO2 forms carbonic acid, altering 
the pH of the solution and potentially causing indirect effects, 
including mobilization of (toxic) metals, sulphate or chloride; 
and possibly giving the water an odd odour, colour or taste. 
In the worst case, contamination might reach dangerous levels, 
excluding the use of groundwater for drinking or irrigation. 
 
Wang and Jaffé (2004) used a chemical transport model to 
investigate the effect of releasing CO2 from a point source at 
100 m depth into a shallow water formation that contained a 
high concentration of mineralized lead (galena). They found 
that in weakly buffered formations, the escaping CO2 could 
mobilize sufficient dissolved lead to pose a health hazard 
over a radius of a few hundred metres from the CO2 source. 
This analysis represents an extreme upper bound to the risk 
of metal leaching, since few natural formations have mineral 
composition so susceptible to the effects of CO2-mediated 
leaching and one of the expressed requirements of a storage 
site is to avoid compromising other potential resources, such as 
mineral deposits. 
 
The injection of CO2 or any other fluid deep underground 
necessarily causes changes in pore-fluid pressures and in the

CO2 in natural formations
The lifetime of CO2 in natural formations (>10 million yr in some cases) 
suggests an average release fraction <10-7 yr-1 for CO2 trapped in sedimentary 
basins. In highly fractured volcanic systems, rate of release can be many 
orders of magnitude faster.

The cumulative experience of natural gas storage systems exceeds 10,000 
facility-years and demonstrates that operational engineered storage systems 
can contain methane with release rates of 10-4 to 10-6 yr-1.

2003
Models of flow through the 
undisturbed subsurface 
Numerical models show that release of CO2 by subsurface flow through 
undisturbed geological media (excluding wells) may be near zero at 
appropriately selected storage sites and is very likely <10-6 in the few studies 
that attempted probabilistic estimates.

et al., 2005; Lindeberg and 
Bergmo, 2003; Cawley et al.,

Models of flow through 
wells 
Evidence from a small number of risk assessment studies suggests that 
average release of CO2 can be 10-5 to 10-7 yr-1 even in existing oil fields with 
many abandoned wells, such as Weyburn. Simulations with idealized systems 
with ‘open’ wells show that release rates can exceed 10-2, though in practice 
such wells would presumably be closed as soon as CO2 was detected.

projects

techniques are able to detect movement of CO2 in the storage reservoirs. 
Although no release to the surface has been detected, little can be concluded 
given the short history and few sites.

geomechanical stress fields that reach far beyond the volume 
occupied by the injected fluid. Brines displaced from deep 
formations by injected CO2 can potentially migrate or leak 
through fractures or defective wells to shallow aquifers and 
contaminate shallower drinking water formations by increasing 
their salinity. In the worst case, infiltration of saline water 
into groundwater or into the shallow subsurface could impact 
wildlife habitat, restrict or eliminate agricultural use of land and 
pollute surface waters. 
 
As is the case for induced seismicity, the experience with 
injection of different fluids provides an empirical basis for 
assessing the likelihood that groundwater contamination will 
occur by brine displacement. As discussed in Section 5.5 and 
shown in Figure 5.22, the current site-specific injection rates 
of fluids into the deep subsurface are roughly comparable to 
the rates at which CO2 would be injected if geological storage 
were adopted for storage of CO2 from large-scale power plants. 
Contamination of groundwater by brines displaced from injection 
wells is rare and it is therefore expected that contamination 
arising from large-scale CO2 storage activities would also be 
rare. Density differences between CO2 and other fluids with 
which we have extensive experience do not compromise this 
conclusion, because brine displacement is driven primarily by 
the pressure/hydraulic head differential of the injected CO2, not 
by buoyancy forces.
5.7.4.3 
Hazards to terrestrial and marine ecosystems
Stored CO2 and any accompanying substances, may affect the 
flora and fauna with which it comes into contact. Impacts might 
be expected on microbes in the deep subsurface and on plants 
and animals in shallower soils and at the surface. The remainder 
of this discussion focuses only on the hazards where exposures 
to CO2 do occur. As discussed in Section 5.7.3, the probability 
of leakage is low. Nevertheless, it is important to understand the 
hazards should exposures occur. 
 
In the last three decades, microbes dubbed ‘extremophiles’, 
living in environments where life was previously considered 
impossible, have been identified in many underground habitats. 
These microorganisms have limited nutrient supply and exhibit 
very low metabolic rates (D’Hondt et al., 2002). Recent studies 
have described populations in deep saline formations (Haveman 
and Pedersen, 2001), oil and gas reservoirs (Orphan et al., 2000) 
and sediments up to 850 m below the sea floor (Parkes et al., 
2000). The mass of subsurface microbes may well exceed the 
mass of biota on the Earth’s surface (Whitman et al., 2001). The 
working assumption may be that unless there are conditions 
preventing it, microbes can be found everywhere at the depths 
being considered for CO2 storage and consequently CO2 storage 
sites may generally contain microbes that could be affected by 
injected CO2. 
 
The effect of CO2 on subsurface microbial populations 
is not well studied. A low-pH, high-CO2 environment may 
favour some species and harm others. In strongly reducing 
environments, the injection of CO2 may stimulate microbial 
communities that would reduce the CO2 to CH4; while in other 
reservoirs, CO2 injection could cause a short-term stimulation 
of Fe(III)-reducing communities (Onstott, 2005). From an 
operational perspective, creation of biofilms may reduce the 
effective permeability of the formation. 
 
Should CO2 leak from the storage formation and find its way 
to the surface, it will enter a much more biologically active area. 
While elevated CO2 concentrations in ambient air can accelerate 
plant growth, such fertilization will generally be overwhelmed 
by the detrimental effects of elevated CO2 in soils, because CO2 
fluxes large enough to significantly increase concentrations 
in the free air will typically be associated with much higher 
CO2 concentrations in soils. The effects of elevated CO2 
concentrations would be mediated by several factors: the type 
and density of vegetation; the exposure to other environmental 
stresses; the prevailing environmental conditions like wind 
speed and rainfall; the presence of low-lying areas; and the 
density of nearby animal populations. 
 
The main characteristic of long-term elevated CO2 zones 
at the surface is the lack of vegetation. New CO2 releases into 
vegetated areas cause noticeable die-off. In those areas where 
significant impacts to vegetation have occurred, CO2 makes up 
about 20–95% of the soil gas, whereas normal soil gas usually 
contains about 0.2–4% CO2. Carbon dioxide concentrations 
above 5% may be dangerous for vegetation and as concentration 
approach 20%, CO2 becomes phytotoxic. Carbon dioxide can 
cause death of plants through ‘root anoxia’, together with low 
oxygen concentration (Leone et al., 1977; Flower et al., 1981). 
 
One example of plant die-off occurred at Mammoth 
Mountain, California, USA, where a resurgence of volcanic 
activity resulted in high CO2 fluxes. In 1989, a series of small 
earthquakes occurred near Mammoth Mountain. A year later, 4 
ha of pine trees were discovered to be losing their needles and 
by 1997, the area of dead and dying trees had expanded to 40 
ha (Farrar et al., 1999). Soil CO2 levels above 10–20% inhibit 
root development and decrease water and nutrient uptake; soil 
oil-gas testing at Mammoth Mountain in 1994 discovered soil 
gas readings of up to 95% CO2 by volume. Total CO2 flux in the 
affected areas averaged about 530 t day–1 in 1996. Measurements 
in 2001 showed soil CO2 levels of 15–90%, with flux rates at 
the largest affected area (Horseshoe Lake) averaging 90–100 
tCO2 day–1 (Gerlach et al., 1999; Rogie et al., 2001). A study of 
the impact of elevated CO2 on soils found there was a lower pH 
and higher moisture content in summer. Wells in the high CO2 
area showed higher levels of silicon, aluminum, magnesium 
and iron, consistent with enhanced weathering of the soils. 
Tree-ring data show that CO2 releases have occurred prior to 
1990 (Cook et al., 2001). Data from airborne remote sensing 
are now being used to map tree health and measure anomalous 
CO2 levels, which may help determine how CO2 affects forest 
ecosystems (Martini and Silver, 2002).
 
There is no evidence of any terrestrial impact from current 
CO2 storage projects. Likewise, there is no evidence from 
EOR projects that indicate impacts to vegetation such as those 
described above. However, no systematic studies have occurred 
to look for terrestrial impacts from current EOR projects. 
 
Natural CO2 seepage in volcanic regions, therefore, provides 
examples of possible impacts from leaky CO2 storage, although 
Chapter 5: Underground geological storage
249
(as mentioned in Section 5.2.3) seeps in volcanic provinces 
provide a poor analogue to seepage that would occur from 
CO2 storage sites in sedimentary basins. As described above, 
CO2 seepage can pose substantial hazards. In the Alban Hills, 
south of Rome (Italy), for example, 29 cows and 8 sheep were 
asphyxiated in several separate incidents between September 
1999 and October 2001 (Carapezza et al., 2003). The measured 
CO2 flux was about 60 t day–1 of 98% CO2 and up to 2% 
H2S, creating hazardous levels of each gas in localized areas, 
particularly in low-wind conditions. The high CO2 and H2S 
fluxes resulted from a combination of magmatic activity and 
faulting. 
 
Human activities have caused detrimental releases of CO2 
from the deep subsurface. In the late 1990s, vegetation died 
off above an approximately 3-km deep geothermal field being 
exploited for a 62 MW power plant, in Dixie Valley, Nevada, 
USA (Bergfeld et al., 2001). A maximum flux of 570 gCO2 m–2 
day–1 was measured, as compared to a background level of 7 
gCO2 m-2 day–1. By 1999, CO2 flow in the measured area ceased 
and vegetation began to return.
 
The relevance of these natural analogues to leakage from 
CO2 storage varies. For examples presented here, the fluxes and 
therefore the risks, are much higher than might be expected from 
a CO2 storage facility: the annual flow of CO2 at the Mammoth 
Mountain site is roughly equal to a release rate on the order 
of 0.2% yr-1 from a storage site containing 100 MtCO2. This 
corresponds to a fraction retained of 13.5% over 1000 years 
and, thus, is not representative of a typical storage site. 
 
Seepage from offshore geological storage sites may 
pose a hazard to benthic environments and organisms as the 
CO2 moves from deep geological structures through benthic 
sediments to the ocean. While leaking CO2 might be hazardous 
to the benthic environment, the seabed and overlying seawater 
can also provide a barrier, reducing the escape of seeping CO2 
to the atmosphere. These hazards are distinctly different from 
the environmental effects of the dissolved CO2 on aquatic life in 
the water column, which are discussed in Chapter 6. No studies 
specifically address the environmental effects of seepage from 
sub-seabed geological storage sites.
5.7.4.4 
Induced seismicity
Underground injection of CO2 or other fluids into porous rock 
at pressures substantially higher than formation pressures can 
induce fracturing and movement along faults (see Section 5.5.4 
and Healy et al., 1968; Gibbs et al., 1973; Raleigh et al., 1976; 
Sminchak et al., 2002; Streit et al., 2005; Wo et al., 2005). 
Induced fracturing and fault activation may pose two kinds 
of risks. First, brittle failure and associated microseismicity 
induced by overpressuring can create or enhance fracture 
permeability, thus providing pathways for unwanted CO2 
migration (Streit and Hillis, 2003). Second, fault activation can, 
in principle, induce earthquakes large enough to cause damage 
(e.g., Healy et al., 1968).
 
Fluid injection into boreholes can induce microseismic 
activity, as for example at the Rangely Oil Field in Colorado, 
USA (Gibbs et al., 1973; Raleigh et al., 1976), in test sites 
such as the drillholes of the German continental deep drilling 
programme (Shapiro et al., 1997; Zoback and Harjes, 1997) or 
the Cold Lake Oil Field, Alberta, Canada (Talebi et al., 1998). 
Deep-well injection of waste fluids may induce earthquakes 
with moderate local magnitudes (ML), as suggested for the 
1967 Denver earthquakes (ML of 5.3; Healy et al., 1968; Wyss 
and Molnar, 1972) and the 1986–1987 Ohio earthquakes (ML of 
4.9; Ahmad and Smith, 1988) in the United States. Seismicity 
induced by fluid injection is usually assumed to result from 
increased pore-fluid pressure in the hypocentral region of the 
seismic event (e.g., Healy et al., 1968; Talebi et al., 1998).
 
Readily applicable methods exist to assess and control 
induced fracturing or fault activation (see Section 5.5.3). Several 
geomechanical methods have been identified for assessing the 
stability of faults and estimating maximum sustainable pore-
fluid pressures for CO2 storage (Streit and Hillis, 2003). Such 
methods, which require the determination of in situ stresses, 
fault geometries and relevant rock strengths, are based on brittle 
failure criteria and have been applied to several study sites for 
potential CO2 storage (Rigg et al., 2001; Gibson-Poole et al., 
2002).
 
The monitoring of microseismic events, especially in the 
vicinity of injection wells, can indicate whether pore fluid 
pressures have locally exceeded the strength of faults, fractures 
or intact rock. Acoustic transducers that record microseismic 
events in monitoring wells of CO2 storage sites can be used 
to provide real-time control to keep injection pressures below 
the levels that induce seismicity. Together with the modelling 
techniques mentioned above, monitoring can reduce the chance 
of damage to top seals and fault seals (at CO2 storage sites) 
caused by injection-related pore-pressure increases. 
 
Fault activation is primarily dependent on the extent and 
magnitude of the pore-fluid-pressure perturbations. It is 
therefore determined more by the quantity and rate than by 
the kind of fluid injected. Estimates of the risk of inducing 
significant earthquakes may therefore be based on the diverse 
and extensive experience with deep-well injection of various 
aqueous and gaseous streams for disposal and storage. Perhaps 
the most pertinent experience is the injection of CO2 for EOR; 
about 30 MtCO2 yr-1 is now injected for EOR worldwide and 
the cumulative total injected exceeds 0.5 GtCO2, yet there have 
been no significant seismic effects attributed to CO2-EOR. In 
addition to CO2, injected fluids include brines associated with 
oil and gas production (>2 Gt yr–1); Floridan aquifer wastewater 
(>0.5 Gt yr–1); hazardous wastes (>30 Mt yr–1); and natural gas 
(>100 Mt yr–1) (Wilson et al., 2003).
 
While few of these cases may precisely mirror the 
conditions under which CO2 would be injected for storage (the 
peak pressures in CO2-EOR may, for example, be lower than 
would be used in formation storage), these quantities compare 
to or exceed, plausible flows of CO2 into storage. For example, 
in some cases such as the Rangely Oil Field, USA, current 
reservoir pressures even exceed the original formation pressure 
(Raleigh et al., 1976). Thus, they provide a substantial body of 
empirical data upon which to assess the likelihood of induced 
seismicity resulting from fluid injection. The fact that only a few 
250
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
individual seismic events associated with deep-well injection 
have been recorded suggests that the risks are low. Perhaps more 
importantly, these experiences demonstrate that the regulatory 
limits imposed on injection pressures are sufficient to avoid 
significant injection-induced seismicity. Designing CO2 storage 
projects to operate within these parameters should be possible. 
Nevertheless, because formation pressures in CO2 storage 
formations may exceed those found in CO2-EOR projects, more 
experience with industrial-scale CO2 storage projects will be 
needed to fully assess risks of microseismicity. 
5.7.4.5 
Implications of gas impurity
Under some circumstances, H2S, SO2, NO2 and other trace 
gases may be stored along with CO2 (Bryant and Lake, 2005; 
Knauss et al., 2005) and this may affect the level of risk. For 
example, H2S is considerably more toxic than CO2 and well 
blow-outs containing H2S may present higher risks than well 
blow-outs from storage sites that contain only CO2. Similarly, 
dissolution of SO2 in groundwater creates a far stronger acid 
than does dissolution of CO2; hence, the mobilization of metals 
in groundwater and soils may be higher, leading to greater risk 
of exposure to hazardous levels of trace metals. While there has 
not been a systematic and comprehensive assessment of how 
these additional constituents would affect the risks associated 
with CO2 storage, it is worth noting that at Weyburn, one of 
the most carefully monitored CO2 injection projects and one for 
which a considerable effort has been devoted to risk assessment, 
the injected gas contains approximately 2% H2S (Wilson 
and Monea, 2005). To date, most risk assessment studies 
have assumed that only CO2 is stored; therefore, insufficient 
information is available to assess the risks associated with gas 
impurities at the present time.
5.7.5 
Risk assessment methodology
Risk assessment aims to identify and quantify potential risks 
caused by the subsurface injection of CO2, where risk denotes 
a combination (often the product) of the probability of an event 
happening and the consequences of the event. Risk assessment 
should be an integral element of risk-management activities, 
spanning site selection, site characterization, storage system 
design, monitoring and, if necessary, remediation. 
 
The operation of a CO2 storage facility will necessarily 
involve risks arising from the operation of surface facilities 
such as pipelines, compressors and wellheads. The assessment 
of such risks is routine practice in the oil and gas industry and 
available assessment methods like hazard and operability and 
quantitative risk assessment are directly applicable. Assessment 
of such risks can be made with considerable confidence, 
because estimates of failure probabilities and the consequences 
of failure can be based directly on experience. Techniques 
used for assessment of operational risks will not, in general, be 
readily applicable to assessment of risks arising from long-term 
storage of CO2 underground. However, they are applicable to 
the operating phase of a storage project. The remainder of this 
subsection addresses the long-term risks.
 
Risk 
assessment 
methodologies 
are 
diverse; 
new 
methodologies arise in response to new classes of problems. 
Because analysis of the risks posed by geological storage 
of CO2 is a new field, no well-established methodology for 
assessing such risks exists. Methods dealing with the long-term 
risks posed by the transport of materials through the subsurface 
have been developed in the area of hazardous and nuclear waste 
management (Hodgkinson and Sumerling, 1990; North, 1999). 
These techniques provide a useful basis for assessing the risks 
of CO2 storage. Their applicability may be limited, however, 
because the focus of these techniques has been on assessing 
the low-volume disposal of hazardous materials, whereas the 
geological storage of CO2 is high-volume disposal of a material 
that involves comparatively mild hazards. 
 
Several substantial efforts are under way to assess the 
risks posed by particular storage sites (Gale, 2003). These risk 
assessment activities cover a wide range of reservoirs, use a 
diversity of methods and consider a very wide class of risks. 
The description of a representative selection of these risk 
assessment efforts is summarized in Table 5.6.
 
The development of a comprehensive catalogue of the 
risks and of the mechanisms that underlie them, provides a 
good foundation for systematic risk assessment. Many of 
the ongoing risk assessment efforts are now cooperating to 
identify, classify and screen all factors that may influence the 
safety of storage facilities, by using the features, events and 
processes (FEP) methodology. In this context, features includes 
a list of parameters, such as storage reservoir permeability, 
caprock thickness and number of injection wells. Events 
includes processes such as seismic events, well blow-outs and 
penetration of the storage site by new wells. Processes refers 
to the physical and chemical processes, such as multiphase 
flow, chemical reactions and geomechanical stress changes 
that influence storage capacity and security. FEP databases tie 
information on individual FEPs to relevant literature and allow 
classification with respect to likelihood, spatial scale, time scale 
and so on. However, there are alternative approaches. 
 
Most risk assessments involve the use of scenarios that 
describe possible future states of the storage facility and events 
that result in leakage of CO2 or other risks. Each scenario may 
be considered as an assemblage of selected FEPs. Some risk 
assessments define a reference scenario that represents the most 
probable evolution of the system. Variant scenarios are then 
constructed with alternative FEPs. Various methods are used 
to structure and rationalize the process of scenario definition 
in an attempt to reduce the role of subjective judgements in 
determining the outcomes.
 
Scenarios are the starting points for selecting and developing 
mathematical-physical models (Section 5.4.2). Such performance 
assessment models may include representations of all relevant 
components including the stored CO2, the reservoir, the seal, 
the overburden, the soil and the atmosphere. Many of the fluid-
transport models used for risk assessment are derived from (or 
identical to) well-established models used in the oil and gas or 
groundwater management industries (Section 5.4.2). The detail 
or resolution of various components may vary greatly. Some 
Chapter 5: Underground geological storage
251
models are designed to allow explicit treatment of uncertainty 
in input parameters (Saripalli et al., 2003; Stenhouse et al., 
2005; Wildenborg et al., 2005a).
 
Our understanding of abandoned-well behaviour over long 
time scales is at present relatively poor. Several groups are 
now collecting data on the performance of well construction 
materials in high-CO2 environments and building wellbore 
simulation models that will couple geomechanics, geochemistry 
and fluid transport (Scherer et al., 2005; Wilson and Monea, 
2005). The combination of better models and new data should 
enable the integration of physically based predictive models 
of wellbore performance into larger performance-assessment 
models, enabling more systematic assessment of leakage from 
wells.
 
The parameter values (e.g., permeability of a caprock) 
and the structure of the performance assessment models (e.g., 
the processes included or excluded) will both be, in general, 
uncertain. Risk analysis may or may not treat this uncertainty 
explicitly. When risks are assessed deterministically, fixed 
parameter values are chosen to represent the (often unknown) 
probability distributions. Often the parameter values are 
selected ‘conservatively’; that is, they are selected so that risks 
are overestimated, although in practice such selections are 
problematic because the relationship between the parameter 
value and the risk may itself be uncertain. 
 
Wherever possible, it is preferable to treat uncertainty 
explicitly. In probabilistic risk assessments, explicit probability 
distributions are used for some (or all) parameters. Methods such 
as Monte Carlo analysis are then used to produce probability 
distributions for various risks. The required probability 
distributions may be derived directly from data or may involve 
formal quantification of expert judgements (Morgan and 
Henrion, 1999). In some cases, probabilistic risk assessment 
may require that the models be simplified because of limitations 
on available computing resources. 
 
Studies of natural and engineered analogues provide a strong 
basis for understanding and quantifying the health, safety and 
environmental risks that arise from CO2 that seeps from the 
shallow subsurface to the atmosphere. Natural analogues are 
of less utility in assessing the likelihood of various processes 
that transport CO2 from the storage reservoir to the near-surface 
environment. This is because the geological character of such 
analogues (e.g., CO2 transport and seepage in highly fractured 
zones shaped by volcanism) will typically be very different 
from sites chosen for geological storage. Engineered analogues 
such as natural gas storage and CO2-EOR can provide a 
basis for deriving quantitative probabilistic models of well 
performance.
 
Results from actual risk and assessment for CO2 storage are 
provided in 5.7.3.
5.7.6 
Risk management
Risk management entails the application of a structured process 
to identify and quantify the risks associated with a given 
process, to evaluate these, taking into account stakeholder input 
and context, to modify the process to remove excess risks and to 
identify and implement appropriate monitoring and intervention 
strategies to manage the remaining risks. 
 
For geological storage, effective risk mitigation consists of 
four interrelated activities:

assessment (Section 5.4) and socio-economic and 
environmental factors;
•� �Monitoring to provide assurance that the storage project is 
performing as expected and to provide early warning in the 
event that it begins to leak (Section 5.6);
•� Effective regulatory oversight (Section 5.8);
•� �Implementation of remediation measures to eliminate or 
limit the causes and impacts of leakage (Section 5.7.7).
Risk management strategies must use the inputs from the 
risk assessment process to enable quantitative estimates of 
the degree of risk mitigation that can be achieved by various 
measures and to establish an appropriate level of monitoring, 
with intervention options available if necessary. Experience 
from natural gas storage projects and disposal of liquid wastes 
has demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach to risk 
mitigation (Wilson et al., 2003; Apps, 2005; Perry, 2005).
5.7.7 
Remediation of leaking storage projects
Geological storage projects will be selected and operated to 
avoid leakage. However, in rare cases, leakage may occur and 
remediation measures will be needed, either to stop the leak or to 
prevent human or ecosystem impact. Moreover, the availability 
of remediation options may provide an additional level of 
assurance to the public that geological storage can be safe and 
effective. While little effort has focused on remediation options 
thus far, Benson and Hepple (2005) surveyed the practices 
used to remediate natural gas storage projects, groundwater 
and soil contamination, as well as disposal of liquid waste in 
deep geological formations. On the basis of these surveys, 
remediation options were identified for most of the leakage 
scenarios that have been identified, namely:
•� Leaks within the storage reservoir;
•� �Leakage out of the storage formation up faults and 
fractures; 
•� Shallow groundwater;
•� Vadose zone and soil; 
•� Surface fluxes; 
•� CO2 in indoor air, especially basements;
•� Surface water.
Identifying options for remediating leakage of CO2 from active 
or abandoned wells is particularly important, because they 
are known vulnerabilities (Gasda et al., 2004; Perry, 2005). 
Stopping blow-outs or leaks from injection or abandoned 
wells can be accomplished with standard techniques, such as 
injecting a heavy mud into the well casing. If the wellhead 
is not accessible, a nearby well can be drilled to intercept the 
casing below the ground surface and then pump mud down into 
the interception well. After control of the well is re-established, 
the well can be repaired or abandoned. Leaking injection wells 
can be repaired by replacing the injection tubing and packers. If 
the annular space behind the casing is leaking, the casing can be 
perforated to allow injection (squeezing) of cement behind the 
casing until the leak is stopped. If the well cannot be repaired, 
it can be abandoned by following the procedure outlined in 
Section 5.5.2. 
 
Table 5.7 provides an overview of the remediation options 
available for the leakage scenarios listed above. Some methods 
are well established, while others are more speculative. 
Additional detailed studies are needed to further assess the 
feasibility of applying these to geological storage projects 
– studies that are based on realistic scenarios, simulations and 
field studies. 
5.8 
Legal issues and public acceptance
What legal and regulatory issues might be involved in CO2 
storage? How do they differ from one country to the next and 
from onshore to offshore? What international treaties exist that 
have bearing on geological storage? How does and how will the 
public view geological storage? These subjects are addressed 
in this section, which is primarily concerned with geological 
storage, both onshore and offshore. 
5.8.1 
International law
This section considers the legal position of geological CO2 
storage under international law. Primary sources, namely the 
relevant treaties, provide the basis for any assessment of the 
legal position. While States, either individually or jointly, apply 
their own interpretations to treaty provisions, any determination 
of the ‘correct’ interpretation will fall to the International Court 
of Justice or an arbitral tribunal in accordance with the dispute 
settlement mechanism under that treaty. 
5.8.1.1 
Sources and nature of international obligations
According to general principles of customary international 
law, States can exercise their sovereignty in their territories 
and therefore could engage in activities such as the storage 
of CO2 (both geological and ocean) in those areas under their 
jurisdiction. However, if such storage causes transboundary 
impacts, States have the responsibility to ensure that activities 
within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the 
environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of 
national jurisdiction. 
 
More specifically, there exist a number of global and regional 
environmental treaties, notably those on climate change and the 
law of the sea and marine environment, which, as presently 
drafted, could be interpreted as relevant to the permissibility 
of CO2 storage, particularly offshore geological storage  
(Table 5.8). 
 
Before making any assessment of the compatibility of 
CO2 storage with the international legal obligations under 
these treaties, the general nature of such obligations should be 
recalled – namely that:
•� �Obligations under a treaty fall only on the Parties to that 
treaty;
•� �States take such obligations seriously and so will look 
to the provisions of such treaties before reaching policy 
decisions;

253
table 5.7. Remediation options for geological CO2 storage projects (after Benson and Hepple, 2005).
Scenario
Remediation options
Leakage up 
faults, fractures 
and spill points
• Lower injection pressure by injecting at a lower rate or through more wells (Buschbach and Bond, 1974);
• Lower reservoir pressure by removing water or other fluids from the storage structure;
• Intersect the leakage with extraction wells in the vicinity of the leak;
• Create a hydraulic barrier by increasing the reservoir pressure upstream of the leak;
• Lower the reservoir pressure by creating a pathway to access new compartments in the storage reservoir;
• Stop injection to stabilize the project;
• Stop injection, produce the CO2 from the storage reservoir and reinject it back into a more suitable storage structure.
Leakage through 
active or 
abandoned wells
•  Repair leaking injection wells with standard well recompletion techniques such as replacing the injection tubing and 
packers;
• Repair leaking injection wells by squeezing cement behind the well casing to plug leaks behind the casing;
• Plug and abandon injection wells that cannot be repaired by the methods listed above; 
•  Stop blow-outs from injection or abandoned wells with standard techniques to ‘kill’ a well such as injecting a heavy 
mud into the well casing. After control of the well is re-established, the recompletion or abandonment practices 
described above can be used. If the wellhead is not accessible, a nearby well can be drilled to intercept the casing 
below the ground surface and ‘kill’ the well by pumping mud down the interception well (DOGGR, 1974).
Accumulation 
of CO2 in the 
vadose zone and 
soil gas
•  Accumulations of gaseous CO2 in groundwater can be removed or at least made immobile, by drilling wells that 
intersect the accumulations and extracting the CO2. The extracted CO2 could be vented to the atmosphere or reinjected 
back into a suitable storage site;
•  Residual CO2 that is trapped as an immobile gas phase can be removed by dissolving it in water and extracting it as a 
dissolved phase through groundwater extraction well;
•  CO2 that has dissolved in the shallow groundwater could be removed, if needed, by pumping to the surface and 
aerating it to remove the CO2. The groundwater could then either be used directly or reinjected back into the 
groundwate;
•  If metals or other trace contaminants have been mobilized by acidification of the groundwater, ‘pump-and-treat’ 
methods can be used to remove them. Alternatively, hydraulic barriers can be created to immobilize and contain 
the contaminants by appropriately placed injection and extraction wells. In addition to these active methods of 
remediation, passive methods that rely on natural biogeochemical processes may also be used.
Leakage into the 
vadose zone and 
accumulation in 
soil gas (Looney 
and Falta, 2000)
•  CO2 can be extracted from the vadose zone and soil gas by standard vapor extraction techniques from horizontal or 
vertical wells;
•  Fluxes from the vadose zone to the ground surface could be decreased or stopped by caps or gas vapour barriers. 
Pumping below the cap or vapour barrier could be used to deplete the accumulation of CO2 in the vadose zone;
•  Since CO2 is a dense gas, it could be collected in subsurface trenches. Accumulated gas could be pumped from the 
trenches and released to the atmosphere or reinjected back underground;
•  Passive remediation techniques that rely only on diffusion and ‘barometric pumping’ could be used to slowly deplete 
one-time releases of CO2 into the vadose zone. This method will not be effective for managing ongoing releases 
because it is relatively slow;
•  Acidification of the soils from contact with CO2 could be remediated by irrigation and drainage. Alternatively, 
agricultural supplements such as lime could be used to neutralize the soil;
Large releases 
of CO2 to the 
atmosphere
•  For releases inside a building or confined space, large fans could be used to rapidly dilute CO2 to safe levels; 
•  For large releases spread out over a large area, dilution from natural atmospheric mixing (wind) will be the only 
practical method for diluting the CO2;
•  For ongoing leakage in established areas, risks of exposure to high concentrations of CO2 in confined spaces (e.g. 
cellar around a wellhead) or during periods of very low wind, fans could be used to keep the rate of air circulation 
high enough to ensure adequate dilution.
Accumulation 
of CO2 in indoor 
environments 
with chronic low-
level leakage
•  Slow releases into structures can be eliminated by using techniques that have been developed for controlling release 
of radon and volatile organic compounds into buildings. The two primary methods for managing indoor releases are 
basement/substructure venting or pressurization. Both would have the effect of diluting the CO2 before it enters the 
indoor environment (Gadgil et al., 1994; Fischer et al., 1996).
Accumulation in 
surface water
•  Shallow surface water bodies that have significant turnover (shallow lakes) or turbulence (streams) will quickly 
release dissolved CO2 back into the atmosphere;
•  For deep, stably stratified lakes, active systems for venting gas accumulations have been developed and applied at 
Lake Nyos and Monoun in Cameroon (http://perso.wanadoo.fr/mhalb/nyos/).

5.8.1.2 
Key issues in the application of the marine treaties 
to CO2 storage
When interpreting the treaties for the purposes of determining the 
permissibility of CO2 storage, particularly offshore geological 
storage, it is important to bear in mind that the treaties were not 
drafted to facilitate geological storage but to prohibit marine 
dumping. Issues to bear in mind include the following:
•� �Whether storage constitutes ‘dumping’, that is, it does not 
if the placement of the CO2 is ‘other than for the purposes 
of the mere disposal thereof’ in accordance with the United 
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the 
London Convention (LC), the London Protocol (LP) and the 
Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment 
of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR). Alternative scenarios 
include experiments and storage for the purposes of

5.8.1.3 
Literature on geological storage under international 
law
While it is necessary to look at and interpret the treaty 
provisions themselves to determine the permissibility of CO2 
storage, secondary sources contain States’ or authors’ individual 
interpretations of the treaties. 
 
In their analysis, Purdy and Macrory (2004) conclude that 
since stored CO2 does not enter the atmosphere, it will not be 
classed as an ‘emission’ for the purposes of the UNFCCC/KP, 
but as an ‘emission reduction’. Emission reductions by CO2 
storage are permitted under the UNFCCC/KP, which allows 
projects that reduce greenhouse gases at the source. However, 
the authors consider a potential problem in UNFCCC/KP 
providing for transparent verification of emission reductions 
and there could be concerns over permanence, leakage and 
security. 
 
In terms of marine treaties and in relation to OSPAR, which 
applies to the North East Atlantic, a report from the OSPAR 
Group of Jurists and Linguists contains the State Parties’ 
interpretation of OSPAR on the issue of geological (and ocean) 
offshore storage (OSPAR Commission, 2004). It concludes 
that, as there is the possibility of pollution or of other adverse 
environmental effects, the precautionary principle must be 
applied. More specifically, the report interprets OSPAR as 
allowing CO2 placement in the North East Atlantic (including 
seabed and subsoil) through a pipeline from land, provided it 
does not involve subsequent activities through a vessel or an 
offshore installation (e.g., an oil or gas platform). The report 
states, however, that placement from a vessel is prohibited, 
unless for the purpose of experimentation (which would then 
require being carried out in accordance with other relevant 
provisions of OSPAR). In the case of placement in the OSPAR 
maritime area from an offshore installation, this depends upon 
whether the CO2 to be stored results from offshore or land-based 
activities. In the case of offshore-derived CO2, experimental 
placement will again be subject to the Convention’s provisions,

while placement for EOR, climate change mitigation or indeed 
mere disposal will be strictly subject to authorization or 
regulation. As regards onshore-derived CO2, placement only for 
experimental or EOR purposes will be allowed, subject to the 
same caveats as for offshore-derived CO2. The report concludes 
that, since the applicable OSPAR regime is determined by 
the method and purpose of placement and not by the effect of 
placement on the marine environment, the results may well 
be that placements with different impacts on the environment 
(for example, placement in the water column and placement in 
underground strata) may not be distinguished, while different 
methods of placement having the same impact may be treated 
differently. A similar analytical exercise concerning the LC/LP 
has been initiated by Parties to that Convention. 
 
There is uncertainty regarding the extent to which CO2 
storage falls under the jurisdiction of the marine treaties. Some 
authors argue they will probably not allow such storage or that 
the LC (globally) and OSPAR (in the North East Atlantic) could 
significantly restrict geological offshore storage (Lenstra and 
van Engelenburg, 2002; Bewers, 2003). Specifically regarding 
the issues raised above, the following propositions have been 
suggested:
•� �The long-term storage of CO2 amounts to ‘dumping’ under 
the conventions (Purdy and Macrory, 2004); if CO2 were to 
be injected for an industrial purpose, that is, EOR, it would 
not be considered dumping of waste and would be allowed 
under the LC (Wall et al., 2005);
•� �CO2 captured from an oil or natural gas extraction operation 
and stored offshore in a geological formation would not be 
considered ‘dumping’ under the LC (Wall et al., 2005); 
•� �There remain some ambiguities in the provisions of some 
conventions, especially in relation to the option of geological 
storage under the seabed (Ducroux and Bewers, 2005). 
UNCLOS provides the international legal basis for a range 
of future uses for the seafloor that could potentially include 
geological storage of CO2 (Cook and Carleton, 2000); 
•� �Under the LC, CO2 might fall under the ‘industrial waste’ 
category in the list of wastes prohibited for disposal, while 
under the LP and OSPAR, it would probably not fall under 
the categories approved for dumping and should therefore 
be considered as waste and this is prohibited (Purdy and 
Macrory, 2004). 
If CO2 is transported by ship and then disposed of, either 
directly from the ship or from an offshore installation, this will 
be prohibited under the LC/LP (Wall et al., 2005) and OSPAR 
(Purdy and Macrory, 2004). If CO2 is transported by pipeline 
to an offshore installation and then disposed of, that would be 
prohibited under the LC/LP, but not necessarily under OSPAR, 
where prohibition against dumping applies only to installations 
carrying out activities concerning hydrocarbons (Purdy and 
Macrory, 2004). The option of storing CO2 transported through 
a pipeline from land appears to remain open under most 
conventions (Ducroux and Bewers, 2005); the LC/LP apply 
only to activities that involve ships or platforms and contain no 
further controls governing pipeline discharges from land-based 
sources. Any such discharges would probably be excluded from 
control by the LC because it would not involve ‘disposal at sea’ 
(Wall et al., 2005). Under OSPAR, however, States have general 
environmental obligations with respect to land-based sources 
(Purdy and Macrory, 2004) (and discharges from pipelines from 
land will be regulated, although not prohibited).
5.8.2 
National regulations and standards
States can regulate subsurface injection and storage of CO2 
within their jurisdiction in accordance with their national rules 
and regulations. Such rules and regulations could be provided by 
the mining laws, resource conservation laws, laws on drinking 
water, waste disposal, oil and gas production, treatment of high-
pressurized gases and others. An analysis of existing regulations 
in North America, Europe, Japan and Australia highlights the 
lack of regulations that are specifically relevant for CO2 storage 
and the lack of clarity relating to post-injection responsibilities 
(IEA-GHG, 2003; IOGCC, 2005). 
 
Presently, CO2 is injected into the subsurface for EOR and 
for disposal of acid gas (Section 5.2.4). Most of these recovery 
or disposal activities inject relatively small quantities of CO2 
into reasonably well-characterized formations. Generally, the 
longevity of CO2 storage underground and the extent of long-
term monitoring of the injected fluids are not specified in the 
regulation of these activities, which are generally regulated 
under the larger umbrella of upstream oil and gas production 
and waste disposal regulations that do not specify storage time 
and need for post-operational monitoring.
 
In Canada, the practice of deep-well injection of fluids in 
the subsurface, including disposal of liquid wastes, is legal and 
regulated. As a result of provincial jurisdiction over energy and 
mineral resources, there are no generally applicable national 
laws that specifically regulate deep-well injection of fluids. 
Onshore CO2 geological storage would fall under provincial 
laws and regulations, while storage offshore and in federally 
administered territories would fall under federal laws and 
regulations. In the western provinces that are major oil and 
gas producers, substantive regulations specifically manage 
the use of injection wells. In Alberta, for example, there are 
detailed procedural regulations regarding well construction, 
operation and abandonment, within which specific standards 
are delineated for five classes of injection wells (Alberta Energy 
and Utilities Board, 1994). In Saskatchewan, The Oil and Gas 
Conservation Regulations 1985 (with Amendments through 
2000) prescribe standards for disposal of oil field brine and other 
wastes. In addition, capture, transport and operational injection 
of fluids, including acid gas and CO2, are by and large covered 
under existing regulations, but no regulations are in place for 
monitoring the fate of the injected fluids in the subsurface and/
or for the post-abandonment stage of an injection operation.
 
In the United States, the Safe Drinking Water Act regulates 
most underground injection activities. The USEPA Underground 
Injection and Control (UIC) Program, created in 1980 to provide 
minimum standards, helps harmonize regulatory requirements 
for underground injection activities. The explicit goal of the UIC 
256
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
programme is to protect current and potential sources of public 
drinking water. The Safe Drinking Water Act expressly prohibits 
underground injection that ‘endangers’ an underground source 
of drinking water. Endangerment is defined with reference to 
national primary drinking water regulations and adverse human 
health effects. For certain types or ‘classes’ of wells, regulations 
by the USEPA prohibit injection that causes the movement of 
any contaminant into an underground source of drinking water. 
 
Wells injecting hazardous wastes require the additional 
development of a no-migration petition to be submitted to the 
regulators. These petitions place the onus of proof on the project 
proponent that injected fluid will not migrate from the disposal 
site for 10,000 years or more. The fluids can exhibit buoyancy 
effects, as disposed fluids can be less dense than the connate 
fluids of the receiving formation. Operators are required to 
use models to demonstrate they can satisfy the ‘no-migration’ 
requirement over 10,000 years. Wilson et al. (2003) suggests 
that this process of proving containment could provide a model 
for long-term storage of CO2. While detailed requirements exist 
for siting, constructing and monitoring injection well operation, 
there are no federal requirements for monitoring or verification 
of the actual movement of fluids within the injection zone, nor 
are there general requirements for monitoring in overlying zones 
to detect leakage. However, there are requirements for ambient 
monitoring in deep hazardous and industrial waste wells, with 
the degree of rigour varying from state to state. 
 
Vine (2004) provides an extensive overview of environmental 
regulations that might affect geological CO2 storage projects in 
California. Given that a developer may need to acquire up to 15 
permits from federal, state and local authorities, Vine stresses 
the need for research to quantitatively assess the impacts of 
regulations on project development. 
 
In Australia, permitting responsibility for onshore oil 
and gas activities reside with the State Governments, while 
offshore activities are primarily the responsibility of the Federal 
Government. A comprehensive assessment of the Australian 
regulatory regime is under way, but so far only South Australia 
has adopted legislation regulating the underground injection 
of gases such as CO2 for EOR and for storage. Stringent 
environmental impact assessments are required for all 
activities that could compromise the quality of surface water or 
groundwater.
 
The 25 member states of the European Union (EU) have 
to ensure that geological storage of CO2 is in conformity with 
relevant EU Directives. A number of directives could have an 
influence on CO2 geological storage in the EU, notably those on 
waste (75/442/EEC), landfill (1999/31/EC), water (2000/60/EC), 
environmental impact assessment (85/337/EEC) and strategic 
environmental assessment (2001/42/EC). These directives were 
designed in a situation where CO2 capture and storage was not 
taken into account and is not specifically mentioned. 
 
There is one comprehensive Dutch study detailing legal and 
regulatory aspects of CO2 underground injection and storage 
(CRUST Legal Task Force, 2001), including ownership of the 
stored CO2, duty of care, liability and claim settlement. It has 
as its basis the legal situation established by the Dutch Mining 
Act of 2003 that covers ‘substances’ stored underground and 
unites previously divided regulation of onshore and offshore 
activities. Storage is defined as ‘placing or keeping substances 
at depth of more than 100 m below the surface of the earth’. 
Legal interpretation indicates that CO2 intended for storage 
would have to be treated as waste, because it was collected with 
the explicit purpose of disposal. 
 
Regulating CO2 storage presents a variety of challenges: the 
scale of the activity, the need to monitor and verify containment 
and any leakage of a buoyant fluid and the long storage time 
– all of which require specific regulatory considerations. 
Additionally, injecting large quantities of CO2 into saline 
formations that have not been extensively characterized or 
may be close to populated areas creates potential risks that will 
need to be considered. Eventually, linkages between a CO2 
storage programme and a larger national and international CO2 
accounting regime will need to be credibly established.
5.8.3 
Subsurface property rights
Storage of CO2 in the subsurface raises several questions: 
Could rights to pore space be transferred to another party? Who 
owns CO2 stored in pore space? How can storage of CO2 in 
the pore space be managed so as to assure minimal damage 
to other property rights (e.g., mineral resources, water rights) 
sharing the same space? Rights to use subsurface pore space 
could be granted, separating them from ownership of the 
surface property. This, for example, appears to apply to most 
European countries and Canada, whereas in the United States, 
while there are currently no specific property-rights issues that 
could govern CO2 storage, the rights to the subsurface can be 
severed from the land.
 
Scale is also an important issue. Simulations have shown 
that the areal extent of a plume of CO2 injected from a 1 GW 
coal-fired power plant over 30 years into a 100-m-thick zone 
will be approximately 100 km2 (Rutqvist and Tsang, 2002) 
and may grow after injection ceases. The approach to dealing 
with this issue will vary, depending on the legal framework for 
ownership of subsurface pore space. In Europe, for example, 
pore space is owned by the State and, therefore, utilization is 
addressed in the licensing process. In the United States, on the 
other hand, the determination of subsurface property rights on 
non-federal lands will vary according to state jurisdiction. In 
most jurisdictions, the surface owner is entitled to exclusive 
possession of the space formerly occupied by the subsurface 
minerals when the minerals are exhausted, that is, the ‘pore 
space’. In other jurisdictions, however, no such precedent exists 
(Wilson, 2004). Some guidance for answering these questions 
can be found in the property rights arrangements associated 
with natural gas storage (McKinnon, 1998). 
5.8.4 
Long-term liability
It is important that liabilities that may apply to a storage project 
are clear to its proponent, including those liabilities that are 
applicable after the conclusion of the project. While a White 
Chapter 5: Underground geological storage
257
Paper by the European Commission outlines the general 
approach to environmental liability (EU, 2000), literature 
specifically addressing liability regimes for CO2 storage is 
sparse. De Figueiredo et al. (2005) propose a framework to 
examine the implications of different types of liability on the 
viability of geological CO2 storage and stress that the way in 
which liability is addressed may have a significant impact on 
costs and on public perception of CO2 geological storage.
 
A number of novel issues arise with CO2 geological storage. 
In addition to long-term in-situ risk liability, which may become 
a public liability after project decommissioning, global risks 
associated with leakage of CO2 to the atmosphere may need 
to be considered. Current injection practices do not require 
any long-term monitoring or verification regime. The cost of 
monitoring and verification regimes and risk of leakage will be 
important in managing liability. 
 
There are also considerations about the longevity of 
institutions and transferability of institutional knowledge. If 
long-term liability for CO2 geological storage is transformed 
into a public liability, can ongoing monitoring and verification 
be assured and who will pay for these actions? How will 
information on storage locations be tracked and disseminated 
to other parties interested in using the subsurface? What are 
the time frames for storage? Is it realistic (or necessary) to put 
monitoring or information systems in place for hundreds of 
years? 
 
Any discussion of long-term CO2 geological storage also 
involves intergenerational liability and thus justification of 
such activities involves an ethical dimension. Some aspects of 
storage security, such as leakage up abandoned wells, may be 
realized only over a long time frame, thus posing a risk to future 
generations. Assumptions on cost, discounting and the rate of 
technological progress can all lead to dramatically different 
interpretations of liability and its importance and need to be 
closely examined. 
5.8.5 
Public perception and acceptance
There is insufficient public knowledge of climate change issues 
and of the various mitigation options, their potential impact and 
their practicality. The study of public perceptions and perceived 
acceptability of CO2 capture and storage is at an early stage with 
few studies (Gough et al., 2002; Palmgren et al., 2004; Shackley 
et al., 2004; Curry et al., 2005; Itaoka et al., 2005). Research on 
perceptions of CO2 capture and storage is challenging because 
of (1) the relatively technical and ‘remote’ nature of the issue, 
with few immediate points of connection in the lay public’s 
frame of reference to many key concepts; and (2) the early stage 
of the technology, with few examples and experiences in the 
public domain to draw upon as illustrations. 
5.8.5.1 
Survey research
Curry et al. (2005) surveyed more than 1200 people representing 
a general population sample of the United States. They found 
that less than 4% of the respondents were familiar with the 
terms carbon dioxide capture and storage or carbon storage. 
Moreover, there was no evidence that those who expressed 
familiarity were any more likely to correctly identify that the 
problem being addressed was global warming rather than 
water pollution or toxic waste. The authors also showed that 
there was a lack of knowledge of other power generation 
technologies (e.g., nuclear power, renewables) in terms of their 
environmental impacts and costs. Eurobarometer (2003) made 
similar findings across the European Union. The preference of 
the sample for different methods to address global warming 
(do nothing, expand nuclear power, continue to use fossil fuels 
with CO2 capture and storage, expand renewables, etc.) was 
quite sensitive to information provided on relative costs and 
environmental characteristics. 
 
Itaoka et al. (2005) conducted a survey of approximately 
a thousand people in Japan. They found much higher claimed 
levels of awareness of CO2 capture and storage (31%) and 
general support for this mitigation strategy as part of a broader 
national climate change policy, but generally negative views 
on specific implementation of CO2 capture and storage. Ocean 
storage was viewed most negatively, while offshore geological 
storage was perceived as the least negative. Part of the sample 
was provided with more information about CO2 capture and 
storage, but this did not appear to make a large difference in 
the response. Factor analysis was conducted and revealed that 
four factors were important in influencing public opinion, 
namely perceptions of the environmental impacts and risks 
(e.g., leakage), responsibility for reducing CO2 emissions, the 
effectiveness of CO2 capture and storage as a mitigation option 
and the extent to which it permits the continued use of fossil 
fuels. 
 
Shackley et al. (2004) conducted 212 face-to-face interviews 
at a UK airport regarding offshore geological storage. They 
found the sample was in general moderately supportive of the 
concept of CO2 capture and storage as a contribution to a 60% 
reduction in CO2 emissions in the UK by 2050 (the government’s 
policy target). Provision of basic information on the technology 
increased the support that was given to it, though just under 
half of the sample were still undecided or expressed negative 
views. When compared with other mitigation options, support 
for CO2 capture and storage increased slightly, though other 
options (such as renewable energy and energy efficiency) were 
strongly preferred. On the other hand, CO2 capture and storage 
was much preferred to nuclear power or higher energy bills 
(no information on price or the environmental impact of other 
options was provided). When asked, unprompted, if they could 
think of any negative effects of CO2 capture and storage, half 
of the respondents’ mentioned leakage, while others mentioned 
associated potential impacts upon ecosystems and human 
health. Others viewed CO2 capture and storage negatively on 
the grounds it was avoiding the real problem, was short-termist 
or indicated a reluctance to change. 
 
Huijts (2003) polled 112 individuals living in an area 
above a gas field in The Netherlands that had experienced two 
small earthquakes (in 1994 and 2001). She found the sample 
was mildly positive about CO2 capture and storage in general 
terms, but neutral to negative about storage in the immediate 
258
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
neighbourhood. The respondents also thought that the risks 
and drawbacks were somewhat larger than the benefits to the 
environment and society. The respondents considered that the 
personal benefits of CO2 capture and storage were ‘small’ or 
‘reasonably small’. On the basis of her findings, Huijts (2003) 
observed the storage location could make a large difference to 
its acceptability; onshore storage below residential areas would 
probably not be viewed positively, although it has to be borne 
in mind that the study area had experienced recent earthquakes. 
Huijts also notes that many respondents (25%) tended to choose 
a neutral answer to questions about CO2 capture and storage, 
suggesting they did not yet have a well-formed opinion. 
 
Palmgren et al. (2004) conducted 18 face-to-face interviews 
in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA, area, followed by a closed-
form survey administered to a sample of 126 individuals. The 
study found that provision of more information led the survey 
respondents to adopt a more negative view towards CO2 capture 
and storage. The study also found that, when asked in terms 
of willingness to pay, the respondents were less favourable 
towards CO2 capture and storage as a mitigation option than 
they were to all the other options provided (which were rated, 
in descending order, as follows: solar, hydro, wind, natural gas, 
energy efficiency, nuclear, biomass, geological storage and 
ocean storage). Ocean storage was viewed more negatively than 
geological storage, especially after information was provided.
5.8.5.2 
Focus-group research
Focus-group research on CO2 capture and storage was conducted 
in the UK in 2001 and 2003 (Gough et al., 2002; Shackley et 
al., 2004). Initial reactions tended to be sceptical; only within 
the context of the broader discussion of climate change and the 
need for large cuts in CO2 emissions, did opinions become more 
receptive. Typically, participants in these groups were clear that 
other approaches such as energy efficiency, demand-reduction 
measures and renewable energy should be pursued as a priority 
and that CO2 geological storage should be developed alongside 
and not as a straight alternative to, these other options. There 
was general support for use of CO2 capture and storage as a 
‘bridging measure’ while other zero or low carbon energy 
technologies are developed or as an emergency stop-gap 
option if such technologies are not developed in time. There 
was a moderate level of scepticism among participants towards 
both government and industry and what may motivate their 
promotion of CO2 storage, but there was also some distrust of 
messages promoted by environmental groups. Levels of trust 
in key institutions and the role of the media were perceived to 
have a major influence on how CO2 capture and storage would 
be received by the public, a point also made by Huijts (2003).
5.8.5.3 
Implications of the research
The existing research described above has applied different 
methodologies, research designs and terminology, making 
direct comparisons impossible. Inconsistencies in results 
have arisen concerning the effect of providing more detailed 
information to respondents and the evaluation of CO2 capture 
and storage in general terms and in comparison with other low-
carbon mitigation options. Explanations for these differences 
might include the extent of concern expressed regarding future 
climate change. Representative samples in the USA and EU 
(Curry et al., 2005) and most of the smaller samples (Shackley 
et al., 2004; Itaoka et al., 2005) find moderate to high levels 
of concern over climate change, whereas respondents in 
the Palmgren et al. (2004) study rated climate change as the 
least of their environmental concerns. A further explanation 
of the difference in perceptions might be the extent to which 
perceptions of onshore and offshore geological storage have 
been distinguished in the research. 
 
From this limited research, it appears that at least three 
conditions may have to be met before CO2 capture and storage 
is considered by the public as a credible technology, alongside 
other better known options: (1) anthropogenic global climate 
change has to be regarded as a relatively serious problem; (2) 
there must be acceptance of the need for large reductions in 
CO2 emissions to reduce the threat of global climate change; 
(3) the public has to accept this technology as a non-harmful 
and effective option that will contribute to the resolution of (1) 
and (2). As noted above, many existing surveys have indicated 
fairly widespread concern over the problem of global climate 
change and a prevailing feeling that the negative impact 
outweighs any positive effects (e.g., Kempton et al., 1995; 
Poortinga and Pidgeon, 2003). On the other hand, some survey 
and focus-group research suggests that widespread acceptance 
of the above factors amongst the public – in particular the need 
for large reduction in CO2 emissions – is sporadic and variable 
within and between national populations. Lack of knowledge 
and uncertainty regarding the economic and environmental 
characteristics of other principal mitigation options have also 
been identified as an impediment to evaluating the CO2 capture 
and storage option (Curry et al., 2005). 
 
Acceptance of the three conditions does not imply support 
for CO2 capture and storage. The technology may still be rejected 
by some as too ‘end of pipe’, treating the symptoms not the 
cause, delaying the point at which the decision to move away 
from the use of fossil fuels is taken, diverting attention from the 
development of renewable energy options and holding potential 
long-term risks that are too difficult to assess with certainty. 
Conversely, there may be little realization of the practical 
difficulties in meeting existing and future energy needs from 
renewables. Acceptance of CO2 capture and storage, where it 
occurs, is frequently ‘reluctant’ rather than ‘enthusiastic’ and in 
some cases reflects the perception that CO2 capture and storage 
might be required because of failure to reduce CO2 emissions in 
other ways. Furthermore, several of the studies above indicate 
that an ‘in principle’ acceptance of the technology can be very 
different from acceptance of storage at a specific site. 
5.8.5.4�
Underground�storage�of�other�fluids
Given minimal experience with storage of CO2, efforts have been 
made to find analogues that have similar regulatory (and hence 
public acceptance) characteristics (Reiner and Herzog, 2004). 
Proposals for underground natural gas storage schemes have 
generated public opposition in some localities, despite similar 
Chapter 5: Underground geological storage
259
facilities operating close by without apparent concern (Gough et 
al., 2002). Concern regarding the effects of underground natural 
gas storage upon local property prices and difficult-to-assess 
risks appear in one case to have been taken up and possibly 
amplified by the local media. Public opposition to onshore 
underground storage is likely to be heightened by accidents 
such as the two deaths from explosions in 2001 in Hutchinson, 
Kansas (USA), when compressed natural gas escaped from 
salt cavern storage facilities (Lee, 2001). However, throughout 
the world today, many hundreds of natural gas storage sites 
are evidently acceptable to local communities. There has also 
been a study of the Underground Injection Control programme 
in the United States, because of the perceived similarity of the 
governing regulatory regime (Wilson et al., 2003).
5.9 
Costs of geological storage
How much will geological storage cost? What are the major 
factors driving storage costs? Can costs be offset by enhanced 
oil and gas production? These questions are covered in this 
section. It starts with a review of the cost elements and factors 
that affect storage costs and then presents estimated costs for 
different storage options. The system boundary for the storage 
costs used here is the delivery point between the transport system 
and the storage site facilities. It is generally expected that CO2 
will be delivered as a dense fluid (liquid or supercritical) under 
pressure at this boundary. The costs of capture, compression 
and transport to the site are excluded from the storage costs 
presented here. The figures presented are levelized costs, which 
incorporate economic assumptions such as the project lifetime, 
discount rates and inflation (see Section 3.7.2). They incorporate 
both capital and operating costs.
5.9.1 
Cost elements for geological storage
The major capital costs for CO2 geological storage are drilling 
wells, infrastructure and project management. For some storage 
sites, there may be in-field pipelines to distribute and deliver 
CO2 from centralized facilities to wells within the site. Where 
required, these are included in storage cost estimates. For 
enhanced oil, gas and coal bed methane options, additional 
facilities may be required to handle produced oil and gas. Reuse 
of infrastructure and wells may reduce costs at some sites. 
At some sites, there may be additional costs for remediation 
work for well abandonment that are not included in existing 
estimates. Operating costs include manpower, maintenance 
and fuel. The costs for licensing, geological, geophysical 
and engineering feasibility studies required for site selection, 
reservoir characterization and evaluation before storage 
starts are included in the cost estimates. Bock et al. (2003) 
estimate these as US$ 1.685 million for saline formation and 
depleted oil and gas field storage case studies in the United 
States. Characterization costs will vary widely from site to 
site, depending on the extent of pre-existing data, geological 
complexity of the storage formations and caprock and risks of 
leakage. In addition, to some degree, economies of scale may 
lower the cost per tonne of larger projects; this possibility has 
not been considered in these estimates. 
 
Monitoring of storage will add further costs and is usually 
reported separately from the storage cost estimates in the 
literature. These costs will be sensitive to the regulatory 
requirements and duration of monitoring. Over the long 
term, there may be additional costs for remediation and for 
liabilities.
 
The cost of CO2 geological storage is site-specific, which 
leads to a high degree of variability. Cost depends on the type 
of storage option (e.g., oil or gas reservoir, saline formation), 
location, depth and characteristics of the storage reservoir 
formation and the benefits and prices of any saleable products. 
Onshore storage costs depend on the location, terrain and 
other geographic factors. The unit costs are usually higher 
offshore, reflecting the need for platforms or sub-sea facilities 
and higher operating costs, as shown in separate studies for 
Europe (Hendriks et al., 2002) and Australia (Allinson et al., 
2003). The equipment and technologies required for storage are 
already widely used in the energy industries, so that costs can 
be estimated with confidence. 
5.9.2 
Cost estimates
There are comprehensive assessments of storage costs for the 
United States, Australia and Europe (Hendriks et al., 2002; 
Allinson et al., 2003; Bock et al., 2003). These are based on 
representative geological characteristics for the regions. In 
some cases, the original cost estimates include compression and 
pipeline costs and corrections have been made to derive storage 
costs (Table 5.9). These estimates include capital, operating 
and site characterization costs, but exclude monitoring costs, 
remediation and any additional costs required to address long-
term liabilities. 
 
The storage option type, depth and geological characteristics 
affect the number, spacing and cost of wells, as well as the 
facilities cost. Well and compression costs both increase with 
depth. Well costs depend on the specific technology, the location, 
the scale of the operation and local regulations. The cost of 
wells is a major component; however, the cost of individual 
wells ranges from about US$ 200,000 for some onshore sites 
(Bock et al., 2003) to US$ 25 million for offshore horizontal 
wells (Table 5.10; Kaarstad, 2002). Increasing storage costs 
with depth have been demonstrated (Hendriks et al., 2002). The 
geological characteristics of the injection formation are another 
major cost driver, that is, the reservoir thickness, permeability 
and effective radius that affect the amount and rate of CO2 
injection and therefore the number of wells needed. It is more 
costly to inject and store other gases (NOx, SOx, H2S) with CO2 
because of their corrosive and hazardous nature, although the 
capture cost may be reduced (Allinson et al., 2003).

5.9.3 
Cost estimates for CO2 geological storage
This section reviews storage costs for options without benefits 
from enhanced oil or gas production. It describes the detailed 
cost estimates for different storage options.
5.9.3.1 
Saline formations
The comprehensive review by Allinson et al., (2003), covering 
storage costs for more than 50 sites around Australia, illustrates the 
variability that might occur across a range of sites at the national 
or regional scale. Onshore costs for 20 sites have a median cost of 
0.5 US$/tCO2 stored, with a range of 0.2–5.1 US$/tCO2 stored.  
The 37 offshore sites have a median value of 3.4 US$/tCO2 stored 
and a range of 0.5–30.2 US$/tCO2 stored. This work includes 
sensitivity studies that use Monte Carlo analyses of estimated 
costs to changes in input parameters. The main determinants of 
storage costs are reservoir and injection characteristics such as 
permeability, thickness and reservoir depth, that affect injection 
rate and well costs rather than option type (such as saline 
formation or depleted field). 
 
Bock et al. (2003) have made detailed cost estimates on a 
series of cases for storage in onshore saline formations in the 
United States. Their assumptions on geological characteristics 
are based on a statistical review of more than 20 different 
formations. These formations represent wide ranges in depth 
(700–1800 m), thickness, permeability, injection rate and well 
numbers. The base-case estimate for average characteristics 
has a storage cost of 0.5 US$/tCO2 stored. High- and low-cost 
cases representing a range of formations and input parameters 
are 0.4–4.5 US$/tCO2 stored. This illustrates the variability 
resulting from input parameters. 
 
Onshore storage costs for saline formations in Europe for 
depths of 1000–3000 m are 1.9–6.2 US$/tCO2, with a most 
likely value of 2.8 US$/tCO2 stored (Hendriks et al., 2002). This 
study also presents estimated costs for offshore storage over the 
same depth range. These estimates cover reuse of existing oil 
and gas platforms (Hendriks et al., 2002). The range is 4.7–12.0 
US$/tCO2 stored, showing that offshore costs are higher than 
onshore costs. 
5.9.3.2 
Disused oil and gas reservoirs
It has been shown that storage costs in disused oil and gas fields 
in North America and Europe are comparable to those for saline 
formations (Hendriks et al., 2002; Bock et al., 2003). Bock et 
al. (2003) present costs for representative oil and gas reservoirs 
in the Permian Basin (west Texas, USA). For disused gas fields, 
the base-case estimate has a storage cost of 2.4 US$/tCO2 
stored, with low and high cost cases of 0.5 and 12.2 US$/tCO2 
stored. For depleted oil fields, the base-case cost estimate is 1.3 
US$/tCO2 stored, with low- and highcost cases of 0.5 and 4.0 
US$/tCO2 stored. Some reduction in these costs may be possible 
by reusing existing wells in these fields, but remediation of 
abandoned wells would increase the costs if required. 
 
In Europe, storage costs for onshore disused oil and gas 
fields at depths of 1000–3000 m are 1.2–3.8 US$/tCO2 stored. 
The most likely value is 1.7 US$/tCO2 stored. Offshore oil 
and gas fields at the same depths have storage costs of 3.8–8.1 
US$/tCO2 stored (most likely value is 6.0 US$/tCO2 stored). 
The costs depend on the depth of the reservoir and reuse of 
platforms. Disused fields may benefit from reduced exploration 
and monitoring costs.
5.9.3.3 
Representative storage costs
The different studies for saline formations and disused oil and 
gas fields show a very wide range of costs, 0.2–30.0 US$/tCO2 
stored, because of the site-specific nature of the costs. This 
reflects the wide range of geological parameters that occur in 
any region or country. In effect, there will be multiple sites in 
any geographic area with a cost curve, providing increasing 
storage capacity with increasing cost. 
 
The extensive Australian data set indicates that storage costs 
are less than 5.1 US$/tCO2 stored for all the onshore sites and 
more than half the offshore sites. Studies for USA and Europe 
also show that storage costs are generally less than 8 US$/tCO2, 
except for high-cost cases for offshore sites in Europe and 
depleted gas fields in the United States. A recent study suggests 
that 90% of European storage capacity could be used for costs 
less that 2 US$/tCO2 (Wildenborg et al., 2005b).
 
Assessment of these cost estimates indicates that there is 
significant potential for storage at costs in the range of 0.5–8 
US$/tCO2 stored, estimates that are based on the median, base 
case or most likely values presented for the different studies 
(Table 5.9). These exclude monitoring costs, well remediation 
and longer term costs.
5.9.3.4 
Investment costs for storage projects
Some information is available on the capital and operating 
costs of industry capture and storage projects (Table 5.10). At 
Sleipner, the incremental capital cost for the storage component 
comprising a horizontal well to inject 1 MtCO2 yr-1 was US$ 
15 million (Torp and Brown, 2005). Note that at Sleipner, CO2 
had to be removed from the natural gas to ready it for sale on 
the open market. The decision to store the captured CO2 was 
at least in part driven by a 40 US$/tCO2 tax on offshore CO2 
emissions. Details of the energy penalty and levelized costs 
are not available. At the planned Snohvit project, the estimated 
capital costs for storage are US$ 48 million for injection of  
0.7 MtCO2 yr-1 (Kaarstad, 2002). This data set is limited and 
additional data on the actual costs of industry projects is 
needed.
5.9.4 
Cost estimates for storage with enhanced oil and 
gas recovery
The costs of CO2 geological storage may be offset by additional 
revenues for production of oil or gas, where CO2 injection 
and storage is combined with enhanced oil or gas recovery or 
ECBM. At present, in commercial EOR and ECBM projects 
that use CO2 injection, the CO2 is purchased for the project and 
is a significant proportion of operating costs. The economic 
benefits from enhanced production make EOR and ECBM 
potential early options for CO2 geological storage.
262
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
5.9.4.1 
Enhanced oil recovery
The costs of onshore CO2-flooding EOR projects in North 
America are well documented (Klins, 1984; Jarrell et al., 2002). 
Carbon dioxide EOR projects are business ventures to increase 
oil recovery. Although CO2 is injected and stored, this is not 
the primary driver and EOR projects are not optimized for CO2 
storage. 
 
The commercial basis of conventional CO2-EOR operations 
is that the revenues from incremental oil compensate for the 
additional costs incurred (including purchase of CO2) and 
provide a return on the investment. The costs differ from project 
to project. The capital investment components are compressors, 
separation equipment and H2S removal, well drilling and well 
conversions and completions. New wells are not required for 
some projects. Operating costs are the CO2 purchase price, fuel 
costs and field operating costs. 
 
In Texas, the cost of CO2 purchase was 55–75% of the total 
cost for a number of EOR fields (averaging 68% of total costs) 
and is a major investment uncertainty for EOR. Tax and fiscal 
incentives, government regulations and oil and gas prices are 
the other main investment uncertainties (e.g., Jarrell et al., 
2002). 
 
The CO2 price is usually indexed to oil prices, with an 
indicative price of 11.7 US$/tCO2 (0.62 US$/Mscf) at a West 
Texas Intermediate oil price of 18 US$ per barrel, 16.3 US$/
tCO2 at 25 US$ per barrel of oil and 32.7 US$/tCO2 at 50 US$ 
per barrel of oil (Jarrell et al., 2002). The CO2 purchase price 
indicates the scale of benefit for EOR to offset CO2 storage 
costs.
5.9.4.2 
Cost of CO2 storage with enhanced oil recovery
Recent studies have estimated the cost of CO2 storage in EOR 
sites (Bock et al., 2003; Hendriks et al., 2002). Estimates of 
CO2 storage costs for onshore EOR options in North America 
have been made by Bock et al. (2003). Estimates for a 2-MtCO2 
yr–1 storage scenario are based on assumptions and parameters 
from existing EOR operations and industry cost data. These 
include estimates of the effectiveness of CO2-EOR, in terms of 
CO2 injected for each additional barrel of oil. The methodology 
for these estimates of storage costs is to calculate the break-
even CO2 price (0.3 tCO2). 
 
Experience from field operations across North America 
provides information about how much of the injected CO2 
remains in the oil reservoir during EOR. An average of 170 
standard m3 CO2 of new CO2 is required for each barrel of 
enhanced oil production, with a range of 85 (0.15 tCO2) to 227 
(0.4 tCO2) standard m3 (Bock et al., 2003). Typically, produced 
CO2 is separated from the oil and reinjected back underground, 
which reduces the cost of CO2 purchases.
 
The base case for a representative reservoir at a depth of 
1219 m, based on average EOR parameters in the United States 
with an oil price of 15 US$ per barrel, has a net storage cost 
of –14.8 US$/tCO2 stored. Negative costs indicate the amount 
of cost reduction that a particular storage option offers to the 
overall capture and storage system. Low- and high-cost cases 
representing a range of CO2 effectiveness, depth, transport 
distance and oil price are –92.0 and +66.7 US$/tCO2 stored. 
The low-cost case assumes favourable assumptions for all 
parameters (effectiveness, reservoir depth, productivity) and 
a 20 US$ per barrel oil price. Higher oil prices, such as the 
50 US$ per barrel prices of 2005, will considerably change 
the economics of CO2-EOR projects. No published studies are 
available for these higher oil prices. 
 
Other estimates for onshore EOR storage costs all show 
potential at negative net costs. These include a range of –10.5 
to +10.5 US$/tCO2 stored for European sites (Hendriks et 
al., 2002). These studies show that use of CO2 enhanced oil 
recovery for CO2 storage can be a lower cost option than saline 
formations and disused oil and gas fields. 
 
At present, there are no commercial offshore EOR 
operations and limited information is available on CO2 storage 
costs for EOR options in offshore settings. Indicative storage 
cost estimates for offshore EOR are presented by Hendriks 
et al. (2002). Their range is –10.5 to +21.0 US$/tCO2 stored. 
For the North Sea Forties Field, it has been shown that CO2-
flooding EOR is technically attractive and could increase oil 
recovery, although at present it is not economically attractive as 
a stand-alone EOR project (Espie et al., 2003). Impediments are 
the large capital requirement for adapting facilities, wells and 
flowlines, as well as tax costs and CO2 supply. It is noted that 
the economics will change with additional value for storage of 
CO2.
 
The potential benefit of EOR can be deduced from the CO2 
purchase price and the net storage costs for CO2-EOR storage 
case studies. The indicative value of the potential benefit from 
enhanced oil production to CO2 storage is usually in the range 
of 0–16 US$/tCO2. In some cases, there is no benefit from EOR. 
The maximum estimate of the benefit ranges up to $92 per tonne 
of CO2 for a single case study involving favourable parameters. 
In general, higher benefits will occur at high-oil-price scenarios 
similar to those that have occurred since 2003 and for highly 
favourable sites, as shown above. At 50 US$ per barrel of oil, 
the range may increase up to 30 US$/tCO2. 
5.9.4.3 
Cost of CO2 storage with enhanced gas recovery
CO2-enhanced gas recovery is a less mature technology than 
EOR and it is not in commercial use. Issues are the cost of 
CO2 and infrastructure, concerns about excessive mixing and 
the high primary recovery rates of many gas reservoirs. Cost 
estimates show that CO2-EGR (enhanced gas recovery) can 
provide a benefit of 4–16 US$/tCO2, depending on the price of 
gas and the effectiveness of recovery (Oldenburg et al., 2002).
5.9.4.4 
Cost of CO2 storage with enhanced coal bed 
methane
The injection of CO2 for ECBM production is an immature 
technology not yet in commercial use. In CO2-ECBM, the 
revenues from the produced gas could offset the investment 
costs and provide a source of income for investors. Cost data 
are based on other types of CBM operations that are in use. 
 
There is significant uncertainty in the effectiveness of CO2 
storage in coal beds in conjunction with ECBM, because there 
Chapter 5: Underground geological storage
263
is no commercial experience. The suggested metric for CO2 
retention is 1.5–10 m3 of CO2 per m3 of produced methane. The 
revenue benefit of the enhanced production will depend on gas 
prices.
 
Well costs are a major factor in ECBM because many 
wells are required. In one recent study for an ECBM project 
(Schreurs, 2002), the cost per production well was given as 
approximately US$750,000 per well, plus 1500 US$ m–1 of in-
seam drilling. The cost of each injection well was approximately 
US$430,000. 
 
The IEA-GHG (1998) developed a global cost curve for CO2-
ECBM, with storage costs ranging from –20 to +150 US$/tCO2. 
It concluded that only the most favourable sites, representing 
less than 10% of global capacity, could have negative costs. 
Estimates of onshore CO2-ECBM storage costs in the United 
States have been made by using the approach described for 
EOR (Bock et al., 2003). They estimate the effectiveness of 
ECBM in terms of CO2 injected for incremental gas produced, 
ranging from 1.5 to 10 units (base case value of 2) of CO2 per 
unit of enhanced methane. Other key inputs are the gas well 
production rate, the ratio of producers to injectors, well depth 
and the number of wells. The base case, storing 2.1 MtCO2 per 
year for a representative reservoir at 610 m depth in a newly 
built facility, requires 270 wells. The assumed gas price is 
US$1.90 per GJ (US$2.00 per Mbtu). It has a net storage cost of 
–8.1 US$/tCO2 stored. Low- and high-cost cases representing 
a range of parameters are –26.4 and +11.1 US$/tCO2 stored. 
The range of these estimates is comparable to other estimates 
– for example, those for Canada (Wong et al., 2001) and Europe 
(Hendriks et al., 2002), 0 to +31.5 US$/tCO2. Enhanced CBM 
has not been considered in detail for offshore situations and cost 
estimates are not available.
 
Only one industrial-scale CO2-ECBM demonstration project 
has taken place to date, the Allison project in the United States 
and it is no longer injecting CO2 (Box 5.7). One analysis of 
the Allison project, which has extremely favourable geological 
characteristics, suggests the economics of ECBM in the United 
States are dubious under current fiscal conditions and gas prices 
(IEA-GHG, 2004). The economic analyses suggest this would 
be commercial, with high gas prices about 4 US$ per GJ) and 
a credit of 12–18 US$/tCO2. Alternatively, Reeves (2005) used 
detailed modelling and economic analysis to show a break-even 
gas price of US$2.44 per GJ (US$2.57 per Mbtu), including 
costs of 5.19 US$/tCO2 for CO2 purchased at the field.
5.9.5 
Cost of monitoring
While there has been extensive discussion of possible 
monitoring strategies in the literature and technologies that may 
be applicable, there is limited information on monitoring costs. 
These will depend on the monitoring strategy and technologies 
used and how these are adapted for the duration of storage 
projects. Some of the technologies likely to be used are already 
in widespread use in the oil and gas and CBM industries. 
The costs of individual technologies in current use are well 
constrained.
 
Repeated use of seismic surveys was found to be an 
effective monitoring technology at Sleipner. Its applicability 
will vary between options and sites. Seismic survey costs are 
highly variable, according to the technology used, location 
and terrain and complexity. Seismic monitoring costs have 
been reviewed for an onshore storage project for a 1000 MW 
power plant with a 30-year life (Myer et al., 2003). Assuming 
repeat surveys at five-year intervals during the injection period, 
monitoring costs are estimated as 0.03 US$/tCO2, suggesting 
that seismic monitoring may represent only a small fraction of 
overall storage costs. No discounting was used to develop this 
estimate.
 
Benson et al. (2005) have estimated life-cycle monitoring 
costs for two scenarios: (1) storage in an oil field with EOR and 
(2) storage in a saline formation. For these scenarios, no explicit 
leakage was considered. If leakage were to occur, the ‘enhanced’ 
monitoring programme should be sufficient to detect and locate 
the leakage and may be sufficient to quantify leakage rates as 
well. For each scenario, cost estimates were developed for the 
‘basic’ and ‘enhanced’ monitoring package. The basic monitoring 
package included periodic seismic surveys, microseismicity, 
wellhead pressure and injection-rate monitoring. The enhanced 
package included all of the elements of the ‘basic’ package and 
added periodic well logging, surface CO2 flux monitoring and 
other advanced technologies. For the basic monitoring package, 
costs for both scenarios are 0.05 US$/tCO2, based on a discount 
rate of 10% (0.16–0.19 US$/tCO2 undiscounted). The cost for 
the enhanced monitoring package is 0.069–0.085 US$/tCO2 
(0.27–0.30 US$/tCO2 undiscounted). The assumed duration of 
monitoring includes the 30-year period of injection, as well as 
further monitoring after site closure of 20 years for EOR sites 
and 50 years for saline formations. Increasing the duration of 
monitoring to 1000 years increased the discounted cost by 10%. 
These calculations are made assuming a discount rate of 10% 
for the first 30 years and a discount rate of 1% thereafter. 
5.9.6 
Cost of remediation of leaky storage projects
No estimates have been made regarding the costs of remediation 
for leaking storage projects. Remediation methods listed in 
Table 5.7 have been used in other applications and, therefore, 
could be extrapolated to CO2 storage sites. However, this has 
not been done yet.
5.9.7 
Cost reduction 
There is little literature on cost-reduction potential for CO2 
geological storage. Economies of scale are likely to be important 
(Allinson et al., 2003). It is also anticipated that further cost 
reduction will be achieved with application of learning from 
early storage projects, optimization of new projects and 
application of advanced technologies, such as horizontal and 
multilateral wells, which are now widely used in the oil and gas 
industry.

5.10 
Knowledge gaps
Knowledge regarding CO2 geological storage is founded on 
basic knowledge in the earth sciences, on the experience of the 
oil and gas industry (extending over the last hundred years or 
more) and on a large number of commercial activities involving 
the injection and geological storage of CO2 conducted over the 
past 10–30 years. Nevertheless, CO2 storage is a new technology 
and many questions remain. Here, we summarize what we know 
now and what gaps remain.
1. Current storage capacity estimates are imperfect:
 
• 
 There is need for more development and agreement on 
assessment methodologies.
 
• 
 There are many gaps in capacity estimates at the global, 
regional and local levels.
 
• 
 The knowledge base for geological storage is for the most 
part based on Australian, Japanese, North American and 
west European data.
 
• 
 There is a need to obtain much more information on 
storage capacity in other areas, particularly in areas 
likely to experience the greatest growth in energy use, 
such as China, Southeast Asia, India, Russia/Former 
Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and parts 
of South America and southern Africa.
2.   Overall, storage science is understood, but there is need for 
greater knowledge of particular mechanisms, including:
 
• 
 The kinetics of geochemical trapping and the long-term 
impact of CO2 on reservoir fluids and rocks.
 
• 
 The fundamental processes of CO2 adsorption and CH4 
desorption on coal during storage operations.
3.  Available information indicates that geological storage 
operations can be conducted without presenting any greater 
risks for health and the local environment than similar 
operations in the oil and gas industry, when carried out 
at high-quality and well-characterized sites. However, 
confidence would be further enhanced by increased 
knowledge and assessment ability, particularly regarding:
�
•� �Risks of leakage from abandoned wells caused by 
material and cement degradation.
�
•� �The temporal variability and spatial distribution of leaks 
that might arise from inadequate storage sites.
�
•� Microbial impacts in the deep subsurface.
�
•� Environmental impact of CO2 on the marine seafloor.
�
•� �Methods to conduct end-to-end quantitative assessment 
of risks to human health and the local environment.
4.  There is strong evidence that storage of CO2 in geological 
storage sites will be long term; however, it would be 
beneficial to have:
 
• 
 Quantification of potential leakage rates from more 
storage sites.
 
• 
 Reliable coupled hydrogeological-geochemical-geo–
mechanical simulation models to predict long-term 
storage performance accurately.
 
• 
 Reliable probabilistic methods for predicting leakage 
rates from storage sites.
 
• 
 Further knowledge of the history of natural accumulations 
of CO2.
 
• 
 Effective and demonstrated protocols for achieving 
desirable storage duration and local safety.
5.  Monitoring technology is available for determining the 
behaviour of CO2 at the surface or in the subsurface; 
however, there is scope for improvement in the following 
areas:
 
• 
 Quantification and resolution of location and forms of 
CO2 in the subsurface, by geophysical techniques.
 
• 
Detection and monitoring of subaquatic CO2 seepage.
 
• 
 Remote-sensing and cost-effective surface methods for  
temporally variable leak detection and quantification, 
especially for dispersed leaks.
 
• 
 Fracture detection and characterization of leakage 
potential.
 
• 
 Development of appropriate long-term monitoring 
approaches and strategies.
6.  Mitigation and remediation options and technologies are 
available, but there is no track record of remediation for 
leaked CO2. While this could be seen as positive, some 
stakeholders suggest it might be valuable to have an 
engineered (and controlled) leakage event that could be 
used as a learning experience.
7.  The potential cost of geological storage is known reasonably 
well, but: 
 
• 
 There are only a few experience-based cost data from 
non-EOR CO2 storage projects.
 
• 
 There is little knowledge of regulatory compliance 
costs.
 
• 
 There is inadequate information on monitoring strategies 
and requirements, which affect costs.
8.  The regulatory and responsibility or liability framework for 
CO2 storage is yet to be established or unclear. The following 
issues need to be considered:
 
• 
 The role of pilot and demonstration projects in developing 
regulations.
 
• 
 Approaches for verification of CO2 storage for accounting 
purposes.
 
• 
 Approaches to regulatory oversight for selecting, 
operating and monitoring CO2 storage sites, both in the 
short and long term.
 
• 
 Clarity on the need for and approaches to long-term 
stewardship.
 
• 
Requirements for decommissioning a storage project.
Additional information on all of these topics would improve 
technologies and decrease uncertainties, but there appear to be 
no insurmountable technical barriers to an increased uptake of 
geological storage as a mitigation option.

Chapter 6: Ocean storage

ExECutivE SummARy
Captured CO2 could be deliberately injected into the ocean at 
great depth, where most of it would remain isolated from the 
atmosphere for centuries. CO2 can be transported via pipeline 
or ship for release in the ocean or on the sea floor. There have 
been small-scale field experiments and 25 years of theoretical, 
laboratory, and modelling studies of intentional ocean storage of 
CO2, but ocean storage has not yet been deployed or thoroughly 
tested.
 
The increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations due to 
anthropogenic emissions has resulted in the oceans taking 
up CO2 at a rate of about 7 GtCO2yr-1 (2 GtCyr-1). Over the 
past 200 years the oceans have taken up 500 GtCO2 from the 
atmosphere out of 1300 GtCO2 total anthropogenic emissions. 
Anthropogenic CO2 resides primarily in the upper ocean and 
has thus far resulted in a decrease of pH of about 0.1 at the 
ocean surface with virtually no change in pH deep in the oceans. 
Models predict that the oceans will take up most CO2 released 
to the atmosphere over several centuries as CO2 is dissolved at 
the ocean surface and mixed with deep ocean waters.
 
The Earth's oceans cover over 70% of the Earth's surface 
with an average depth of about 3,800 metres; hence, there is 
no practical physical limit to the amount of anthropogenic CO2 
that could be placed in the ocean. However, the amount that 
is stored in the ocean on the millennial time scale depends on 
oceanic equilibration with the atmosphere. Over millennia, 
CO2 injected into the oceans at great depth will approach 
approximately the same equilibrium as if it were released to the 
atmosphere. Sustained atmospheric CO2 concentrations in the 
range of 350 to 1000 ppmv imply that 2,300 ± 260 to 10,700 
± 1,000 Gt of anthropogenic CO2 will eventually reside in the 
ocean.
 
Analyses of ocean observations and models agree that 
injected CO2 will be isolated from the atmosphere for several 
hundreds of years and that the fraction retained tends to be 
larger with deeper injection. Additional concepts to prolong 
CO2 retention include forming solid CO2 hydrates and liquid 
CO2 lakes on the sea floor, and increasing CO2 solubility by, for 
example, dissolving mineral carbonates. Over centuries, ocean 
mixing results in loss of isolation of injected CO2 and exchange 
with the atmosphere. This would be gradual from large regions 
of the ocean. There are no known mechanisms for sudden or 
catastrophic release of injected CO2.
 
Injection up to a few GtCO2 would produce a measurable 
change in ocean chemistry in the region of injection, whereas 
injection of hundreds of GtCO2 would eventually produce 
measurable change over the entire ocean volume.
 
Experiments show that added CO2 can harm marine 
organisms. Effects of elevated CO2 levels have mostly been 
studied on time scales up to several months in individual 
organisms that live near the ocean surface. Observed phenomena 
include reduced rates of calcification, reproduction, growth, 
circulatory oxygen supply and mobility as well as increased 
mortality over time. In some organisms these effects are seen in 
response to small additions of CO2. Immediate mortality is 
expected close to injection points or CO2 lakes. Chronic effects 
may set in with small degrees of long-term CO2 accumulation, 
such as might result far from an injection site, however, 
long-term chronic effects have not been studied in deep-sea 
organisms.
 
CO2 effects on marine organisms will have ecosystem 
consequences; however, no controlled ecosystem experiments 
have been performed in the deep ocean. Thus, only a preliminary 
assessment of potential ecosystem effects can be given. It is 
expected that ecosystem consequences will increase with 
increasing CO2 concentration, but no environmental thresholds 
have been identified. It is also presently unclear, how species 
and ecosystems would adapt to sustained, elevated CO2 levels.
 
Chemical and biological monitoring of an injection project, 
including observations of the spatial and temporal evolution 
of the resulting CO2 plume, would help evaluate the amount 
of materials released, the retention of CO2, and some of the 
potential environmental effects.
 
For water column and sea floor release, capture and 
compression/liquefaction are thought to be the dominant cost 
factors. Transport (i.e., piping, and shipping) costs are expected 
to be the next largest cost component and scale with proximity 
to the deep ocean. The costs of monitoring, injection nozzles 
etc. are expected to be small in comparison.
 
Dissolving mineral carbonates, if found practical, could 
cause stored carbon to be retained in the ocean for 10,000 years, 
minimize changes in ocean pH and CO2 partial pressure, and 
may avoid the need for prior separation of CO2. Large amounts 
of limestone and materials handling would be required for this 
approach.
 
Several different global and regional treaties on the law of 
the sea and marine environment could be relevant to intentional 
release of CO2 into the ocean but the legal status of intentional 
carbon storage in the ocean has not yet been adjudicated.
 
It is not known whether the public will accept the deliberate 
storage of CO2 in the ocean as part of a climate change mitigation 
strategy. Deep ocean storage could help reduce the impact of 
CO2 emissions on surface ocean biology but at the expense of 
effects on deep-ocean biology.
6.1  
introduction and background
6.1.1 
Intentional storage of CO2 in the ocean
 
This report assesses what is known about intentional storage of 
carbon dioxide in the ocean by inorganic strategies that could 
be applied at industrial scale. Various technologies have been 
envisioned to enable and increase ocean CO2 storage (Figure 6.1). 
One class of options involves storing a relatively pure stream of 
carbon dioxide that has been captured and compressed. This 
CO2 can be placed on a ship, injected directly into the ocean, or 
deposited on the sea floor. CO2 loaded on ships could either be 
dispersed from a towed pipe or transported to fixed platforms 
feeding a CO2 lake on the sea floor. Such CO2 lakes must be 
280
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
deeper than 3 km where CO2 is denser than sea water. Any of 
these approaches could in principle be used in conjunction with 
neutralization with carbonate minerals.
 
Research, development and analysis of ocean CO2 storage 
concepts has progressed to consider key questions and issues that 
could affect the prospects of ocean storage as a response option 
to climate change (Section 6.2). Accumulated understanding 
of the ocean carbon cycle is being used to estimate how long 
CO2 released into the oceans will remain isolated from the 
atmosphere. Such estimates are used to assess the effectiveness 
of ocean storage concepts (Section 6.3).
 
Numerical models of the ocean indicate that placing CO2 
in the deep ocean would isolate most of the CO2 from the 
atmosphere for several centuries, but over longer times the ocean 
and atmosphere would equilibrate. Relative to atmospheric 
release, direct injection of CO2 into the ocean could reduce 
maximum amounts and rates of atmospheric CO2 increase over 
the next several centuries. Direct injection of CO2 in the ocean 
would not reduce atmospheric CO2 content on the millennial 
time scale (Table 6.1; Figures 6.2 and 6.3; Hoffert et al., 1979; 
Kheshgi et al., 1994).

table 6.1 Amount of additional CO2 residing in the ocean after atmosphere-ocean equilibration for different atmospheric stabilization 
concentrations. The uncertainty range represents the influence of climate sensitivity to a CO2 doubling in the range of 1.5 ºC to 4.5 ºC (Kheshgi 
et al., 2005; Kheshgi 2004a). This table considers the possibility of increased carbon storage in the terrestrial biosphere. Such an increase, if 
permanent, would allow a corresponding increase in total cumulative emissions. This table does not consider natural or engineered dissolution of 
carbonate minerals, which would increase ocean storage of anthropogenic carbon. The amount already in the oceans exceeds 500 GtCO2 (= 440 
GtCO2 for 1994 (Sabine et al., 2004) plus CO2 absorption since that time). The long-term amount of CO2 stored in the deep ocean is independent 
of whether the CO2 is initially released to the atmosphere or the deep ocean.

There has been limited experience with handling CO2 in the 
deep sea that could form a basis for the development of ocean 
CO2 storage technologies. Before they could be deployed, 
such technologies would require further development and 
field testing. Associated with the limited level of development, 
estimates of the costs of ocean CO2 storage technologies are 
at a primitive state, however, the costs of the actual dispersal 
technologies are expected to be low in comparison to the costs 
of CO2 capture and transport to the deep sea (but still non-
negligible; Section 6.9). Proximity to the deep sea is a factor, 
as the deep oceans are remote to many sources of CO2 (Section 
6.4). Ocean storage would require CO2 transport by ship or 
deep-sea pipelines. Pipelines and drilling platforms, especially 
in oil and gas applications, are reaching ever-greater depths, yet 
not on the scale or to the depth relevant for ocean CO2 storage 
(Chapter 4). No insurmountable technical barrier to storage of 
CO2 in the oceans is apparent.
 
Putting CO2 directly into the deep ocean means that the 
chemical environment of the deep ocean would be altered 
immediately, and in concepts where release is from a point, 
change in ocean chemistry would be greater proximate to the 
release location. Given only rudimentary understanding of 
deep-sea ecosystems, only a limited and preliminary assessment 
of potential ecosystem effects can be given (Section 6.7).
 
Technologies exist to monitor deep-sea activities (Section 
6.6). Practices for monitoring and verification of ocean storage 
would depend on which, as of yet undeveloped, ocean storage 
technology would potentially be deployed, and on environmental 
impacts to be avoided.
 
More carbon dioxide could be stored in the ocean with less 
of an effect on atmospheric CO2 and fewer adverse effects on 
the marine environment if the alkalinity of the ocean could 
be increased, perhaps by dissolving carbonate minerals in sea 
water. Proposals based on this concept are discussed primarily 
in Section 6.2.
 
For ocean storage of CO2, issues remain regarding 
environmental consequences, public acceptance, implications 
of existing laws, safeguards and practices that would need to be 
developed, and gaps in our understanding of ocean CO2 storage 
(Sections 6.7, 6.8, and 6.10).
6.1.2 
Relevant background in physical and chemical 
oceanography
 
The oceans, atmosphere, and plants and soils are the primary 
components of the global carbon cycle and actively exchange 
carbon (Prentice et al., 2001). The oceans cover 71% of the 
Earth’s surface with an average depth of 3,800 m and contain 
roughly 50 times the quantity of carbon currently contained in 
the atmosphere and roughly 20 times the quantity of carbon 
currently contained in plants and soils. The ocean contains 
Figure 6.3  Equilibrium partitioning of CO2 between the ocean and 
atmosphere. On the time scale of millennia, complete mixing of the 
oceans leads to a partitioning of cumulative CO2 emissions between the 
oceans and atmosphere with the bulk of emissions eventually residing in 
the oceans as dissolved inorganic carbon. The ocean partition depends 
nonlinearly on CO2 concentration according to carbonate chemical 
equilibrium (Box 6.1) and has limited sensitivity to changes in surface 
water temperature (shown by the grey area for a range of climate 
sensitivity of 1.5 to 4.5°C for CO2 doubling) (adapted from Kheshgi 
et al., 2005; Kheshgi, 2004a). ∆pH evaluated from pCO2 of 275 ppm. 
This calculation is relevant on the time scale of several centuries, and 
does not consider changes in ocean alkalinity that increase ocean CO2 
uptake over several millennia (Archer et al., 1997).
Figure 6.2  Simulated atmospheric CO2 resulting from CO2 release to 
the atmosphere or injection into the ocean at 3,000 m depth (Kheshgi 
and Archer, 2004). Emissions follow a logistic trajectory with 
cumulative emissions of 18,000 GtCO2. Illustrative cases include 
100% of emissions released to the atmosphere leading to a peak in 
concentration, 100% of emissions injected into the ocean, and no 
emissions (i.e., other mitigation approaches are used). Additional 
cases include atmospheric emission to year 2050, followed by either 
50% to atmosphere and 50% to ocean after 2050 or 50% to atmosphere 
and 50% by other mitigation approaches after 2050. Ocean injection 
results in lower peak concentrations than atmospheric release but 
higher than if other mitigation approaches are used (e.g., renewables 
or permanent storage).

IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
so much CO2 because of its large volume and because CO2 
dissolves in sea water to form various ionic species (Box 6.1).
 
The increase in atmospheric CO2 over the past few centuries 
has been driving CO2 from the atmosphere into the oceans. 
The oceans serve as an important sink of CO2 emitted to the 
atmosphere taking up on average about 7 GtCO2 yr-1 (2 GtC yr-1) 
over the 20 years from 1980 to 2000 with ocean uptake over the 
past 200 years estimated to be > 500 GtCO2 (135 GtC) (Prentice 
et al., 2001; Sabine et al., 2004). On average, the anthropogenic 
CO2 signal is detectable to about 1000 m depth; its near absence 
in the deep ocean is due to the slow exchange between ocean 
surface and deep –sea waters.
 
Ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2 has led to a perturbation 
of the chemical environment primarily in ocean surface waters. 
Increasing ocean CO2 concentration leads to decreasing carbonate 
ion concentration and increasing hydrogen ion activity (Box 
6.1). The increase in atmospheric CO2 from about 280 ppm in 
1800 to 380 ppm in 2004 has caused an average decrease across 
the surface of the oceans of about 0.1 pH units (∆pH ≈ –0.1) 
from an initial average surface ocean pH of about 8.2. Further 
increase in atmospheric CO2 will result in a further change in 
the chemistry of ocean surface waters that will eventually reach 
the deep ocean (Figure 6.4). The anthropogenic perturbation of 
ocean chemistry is greatest in the upper ocean where biological 
activity is high.
 
Most carbon dioxide released to either the atmosphere or the 
ocean will eventually reside in the ocean, as ocean chemistry 
equilibrates with the atmosphere. Thus, stabilization of 
atmospheric CO2 concentration at levels above the natural level 
of 280 ppm implies long-term addition of carbon dioxide to 
the ocean. In equilibrium, the fraction of an increment of CO2 
released that will reside in the ocean depends on the atmospheric 
CO2 concentration (Table 6.1; Figure 6.3; Kheshgi et al., 2005; 
Kheshgi, 2004a).
 
The capacity of the oceans to absorb CO2 in equilibrium 
with the atmosphere is a function of the chemistry of sea water. 
The rate at which this capacity can be brought into play is a 
function of the rate of ocean mixing. Over time scales of decades 
to centuries, exchange of dissolved inorganic carbon between 
ocean surface waters and the deep ocean is the primary barrier 
limiting the rate of ocean uptake of increased atmospheric CO2. 
Over many centuries (Kheshgi, 2004a), changes in dissolved 
inorganic carbon will mix throughout the ocean volume with 
the oceans containing most of the cumulative CO2 emissions 
to the atmosphere/ocean system (Table 6.1; Figure 6.3). Over 
longer times (millennia), dissolution of CaCO3 causes an even 
greater fraction of released CO2 (85–92%) to reside in the ocean 
(Archer et al., 1997).
 
Both biological and physical processes lead to the observed 
distribution of pH and its variability in the world ocean (Figure 
6.6). As they transit from the Atlantic to Pacific Basins, deep 
ocean waters accumulate about 10% more dissolved inorganic 
carbon dioxide, primarily from the oxidation of sinking organic 
matter (Figure 6.7).

Approaches to release of CO2 into the ocean
6.2.1 
Approaches to releasing CO2 that has been 
captured, compressed, and transported into the 
ocean
6.2.1.1 
 Basic approach
The basic concept of intentional CO2 storage in the ocean is to 
take a stream of CO2 that has been captured and compressed 
(Chapter 3), and transport it (Chapter 4) to the deep ocean for 
release at or above the sea floor. (Other ocean storage approaches 
are discussed in Sections 6.2.2 and 6.2.3.) Once released, the 
CO2 would dissolve into the surrounding sea water, disperse 
and become part of the ocean carbon cycle.
 
Marchetti (1977) first proposed injecting liquefied CO2 into 
the waters flowing over the Mediterranean sill into the mid-
depth North Atlantic, where the CO2 would be isolated from 
the atmosphere for centuries. This concept relies on the slow 
exchange of deep ocean waters with the surface to isolate CO2 
from the atmosphere. The effectiveness of ocean storage will 
depend on how long CO2 remains isolated from the atmosphere. 
Over the centuries and millennia, CO2 released to the deep 
ocean will mix throughout the oceans and affect atmospheric 
CO2 concentration. The object is to transfer the CO2 to deep 
waters because the degree of isolation from the atmosphere 
generally increases with depth in the ocean. Proposed methods 
Figure 6.4 Simulated ocean pH changes from CO2 release to the 
atmosphere. Modelled atmospheric CO2 change and horizontally 
averaged ∆pH driven by a CO2 emissions scenario: historic atmospheric 
CO2 up to 2000, IS92a from 2000 to 2100, and logistic curve extending 
beyond 2100 with 18,000 GtCO2 (Moomaw et al., 2001) cumulative 
emissions from 2000 onward (comparable to estimates of fossil-fuel 
resources – predominantly coal; Caldeira and Wickett, 2003). Since 
year 1800, the pH of the surface of the oceans has decreased about 
0.1 pH units (from an initial average surface ocean pH of about 8.2) 
and CO3
2– has decreased about 40 µmol kg–1. There are a number of 
pH scales used by ocean chemists and biologists to characterize the 
hydrogen ion content of sea water, but ∆pH computed on different 
scales varies little from scale to scale (Brewer et al., 1995).
Chapter 6: Ocean storage
283
The oceans absorb large quantities of CO2 from the 
atmosphere principally because CO2 is a weakly acidic gas, 
and the minerals dissolved in sea water have created a mildly 
alkaline ocean. The exchange of atmospheric CO2 with ocean 
surface waters is determined by the chemical equilibrium 
between CO2 and carbonic acid H2CO3 in sea water, the partial 
pressure of CO2 (pCO2) in the atmosphere and the rate of air/
sea exchange. Carbonic acid dissociates into bicarbonate ion 
HCO3
–, carbonate ion CO3
2–, and hydronium ion H+ by the 
reactions (see Annex AI.3):
CO2 (g) + H2O ↔ H2CO3 (aq) ↔ HCO3
– + H+ ↔ 
CO3
2– + 2H+  
(1)
Total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) is the sum of carbon 
contained in H2CO3, HCO3
–, and CO3
2–. The atmospheric 
concentration of CO2 in equilibrium with surface water can 
be calculated from well-known chemical equilibria that 
depend on ocean total dissolved inorganic carbon, alkalinity, 
temperature and salinity (Zeebe and Wolf-Gladrow, 2001). The 
partial pressure of CO2 in the ocean mixed layer equilibrates 
with the atmosphere on a time scale of about one year. 
 The ocean is a highly buffered system, that is the concentration 
of the chemical species whose equilibrium controls pH is 
significantly higher than the concentrations of H+ or OH–. The 
pH of sea water is the base–10 log of activity of H+. Total 
Alkalinity (TAlk) is the excess of alkaline components, and 
is defined as the amount of strong acid required to bring sea 
water to the ‘equivalence point’ at which the HCO3– and 
H2CO3 contributions are equal (Dickson, 1981).
 The principal effect of adding CO2 to sea water is to form 
bicarbonate ion, for example, 
CO2 + H2O + CO3
2– → 2HCO3
–.  
(2)
In addition, some CO2 undergoes simple reaction with water, 
for example,
CO2 + H2O ↔ H+ + HCO3
–. 
(3)
In either case, Total Alkalinity does not change. The 
combined reactions lower both ocean pH, and carbonate ion 
concentration. For current ocean composition, CO2 that is 
added to sea water is partitioned primarily into HCO3
– with 
the net reaction resulting in the generation of H+ and thus 
decreasing pH and making sea water more acidic; adding CO2 
thereby decreases the concentration of CO3
2–.
Total Alkalinity is increased when, for example, alkaline 
minerals such as CaCO3 are dissolved in sea water through 
the reaction,
CaCO3 (s) ↔ Ca2+ + CO3
2– 
(4)
Box 6.1. Chemical properties of CO2
which releases 2 mole-equivalents of Total Alkalinity and 1 
mol of Dissolved Inorganic Carbon for each mole of CaCO3 
dissolved. Increasing TAlk more than DIC leads to a decrease 
in the partial pressure of CO2 as seen in Figure 6.5. Because 
most Dissolved Inorganic Carbon is in the form of HCO3
–, 
the main effect of dissolving CaCO3 in surface waters is (see 
Kheshgi, 1995)
CaCO3 (s) + CO2 (g) + H2O ↔ Ca2+ + 2HCO3
– 
(5)
thereby shifting CO2 from the atmosphere to the oceans in 
equilibrium, neutralizing the effect of CO2 on pH.
 
Ocean surface waters are super-saturated with respect to 
CaCO3, allowing the growth of corals and other organisms 
that produce shells or skeletons of carbonate minerals. In 
contrast, the deepest ocean waters have lower pH and lower 
CO3
2– concentrations, and are thus undersaturated with respect 
to CaCO3. Marine organisms produce calcium carbonate 
particles in the surface ocean that settle and dissolve in 
undersaturated regions of the deep oceans.

the same value of pCO2 (in ppm); the black lines denote compositions 
with the same pH. The tan shaded region is undersaturated and 
the green shaded region is supersaturated with respect to calcite

Surface water and average ocean compositions are also indicated. 
Adding CO2 increases Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC) without 
changing Total Alkalinity (TAlk); dissolving CaCO3 increases both 
DIC and TAlk, with 2 moles of TAlk added for each mole of DIC 
added.

would inject the CO2 below the thermocline1 for more effective 
storage.
 
Depending on the details of the release and local sea floor 
topography, the CO2 stream could be engineered to dissolve in 
the ocean or sink to form a lake on the sea floor. CO2, dissolved 
in sea water at high concentrations can form a dense plume or 
sinking current along an inclined sea floor. If release is at a great 
enough depth, CO2 liquid will sink and could accumulate on the 
sea floor as a pool containing a mixture of liquid and hydrate. 
In the short-term, fixed or towed pipes appear to be the most 
viable methods for oceanic CO2 release, relying on technology 
that is already largely commercially available.
6.2.1.2 
Status of development
To date, injection of CO2 into sea water has only been investigated 
in the laboratory, in small-scale in-situ experiments, and in 
models. Larger-scale in-situ experiments have not yet been 
carried out.
 
An 
international 
consortium 
involving 
engineers, 
oceanographers and ecologists from 15 institutions in the 
United States, Norway, Japan and Canada proposed an in-situ 
experiment to help evaluate the feasibility of ocean carbon 
storage as a means of mitigating atmospheric increases. This 
was to be a collaborative study of the physical, chemical, and 
biological changes associated with direct injection of CO2 
into the ocean (Adams et al., 2002). The proposed CO2 Ocean 
Sequestration Field Experiment was to inject less than 60 
tonnes of pure liquid carbon dioxide (CO2) into the deep ocean 
near Keahole Point on the Kona coast of the Island of Hawaii.
This would have been the largest intentional CO2 release into 
the ocean water column. The test was to have taken place in 
water about 800 m deep, over a period of about two weeks 
during the summer of 2001. Total project cost was to have 
been roughly US$ 5 million. A small steel pipeline, about 4 cm 
in diameter, was to have been deployed from a ship down to 
the injection depth, with a short section of pipeline resting on 
the sea floor to facilitate data collection. The liquid CO2 was 
to have been dispersed through a nozzle, with CO2 droplets 
briefly ascending from the injection point while dissolving into 
the sea water. However, the project met with opposition from 
environmental organizations and was never able to acquire 
all of the necessary permits within the prescribed budget and 
schedule (de Figueiredo, 2002).
 
Following this experience, the group developed a plan to 
release 5.4 tonnes of liquefied CO2 at a depth of 800 metres 
off the coast of Norway, and monitor its dispersion in the 
Norwegian Sea. The Norwegian Pollution Control Authority 
granted a permit for the experiment. The Conservative Party 
environment minister in Norway’s coalition government, Børge 
Brende, decided to review the Norwegian Pollution Control 
1  The thermocline is the layer of the ocean between about 100 and 1000 m 
depth that is stably stratified by large temperature and density gradients, thus 
inhibiting vertical mixing. Vertical mixing rates in the thermocline can be 
about 1000 times less than those in the deep sea. This zone of slow mixing 
would act as a barrier to slow degassing of CO2 released in the deep ocean to 
the atmosphere.
Authorities’ initial decision. After the public hearing procedure 
and subsequent decision by the Authority to confirm their initial 
permit, Brende said, ‘The possible future use of the sea as 
storage for CO2 is controversial. … Such a deposit could be in 
defiance of international marine laws and the ministry therefore 
had to reject the application.’ The Norwegian Environment 
ministry subsequently announced that the project would not go 
ahead (Giles, 2002).
 
Several smaller scale scientific experiments (less than 100 
litres of CO2) have however been executed (Brewer et al., 1999, 
Brewer et al., 2005) and the necessary permits have also been 
issued for experiments within a marine sanctuary.
6.2.1.3 
Basic behaviour of CO2 released in different forms
The near-field behaviour of CO2 released into the ocean 
depends on the physical properties of CO2 (Box 6.2) and the 
method for CO2 release. Dissolved CO2 increases the density 
of sea water (e.g., Bradshaw, 1973; Song, et al., 2005) and this 
affects transport and mixing. The near field may be defined 
as that region in which it is important to take effects of CO2-
induced density changes on the fluid dynamics of the ocean into 
consideration. The size of this region depends on the scale and 
design of CO2 release (Section 6.2.1.4).
 
CO2 plume dynamics depend on the way in which CO2 is 
released into the ocean water column. CO2 can be initially in the 
form of a gas, liquid, solid or solid hydrate. All of these forms of 
CO2 would dissolve in sea water, given enough time (Box 6.1). 
The dissolution rate of CO2 in sea water is quite variable and 
depends on the form (gas, liquid, solid, or hydrate), the depth 
and temperature of disposal, and the local water velocities. 
Higher flow rates increase the dissolution rate.
 
Gas. CO2 could potentially be released as a gas above 
roughly 500 m depth (Figure 6.8). Below this depth, pressures 
are too great for CO2 to exist as a gas. The gas bubbles would 
be less dense than the surrounding sea water so tend to rise 
towards the surface, dissolving at a radial speed of about 0.1 
cm hr–1 (0.26 to 1.1 µmol cm–2 s–1; Teng et al., 1996). In waters 
colder than about 9°C, a CO2 hydrate film could form on the 
bubble wall. CO2 diffusers could produce gaseous CO2 bubbles 
that are small enough to dissolve completely before reaching 
the surface.
 
Liquid. Below roughly 500 m depth, CO2 can exist in the 
ocean as a liquid. Above roughly 2500 m depth CO2 is less 
dense than sea water, so liquid CO2 released shallower than 
2500 m would tend to rise towards the surface. Because most 
ocean water in this depth range is colder than 9°C, CO2 hydrate 
would tend to form on the droplet wall. Under these conditions, 
the radius of the droplet would diminish at a speed of about 0.5 
cm hr–1 (= 3 µmol cm–2 s–1; Brewer et al., 2002). Under these 
conditions a 0.9 cm diameter droplet would rise about 400 m in 
an hour before dissolving completely; 90% of its mass would be 
lost in the first 200 m (Brewer et al., 2002). Thus, CO2 diffusers 
could be designed to produce droplets that will dissolve within 
roughly 100 m of the depth of release. If the droplet reached 
approximately 500 m depth, it would become a gas bubble.
 
CO2 is more compressible than sea water; below roughly

IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
The properties of CO2 in sea water affect its fate upon release to the deep-sea environment. The conditions under which CO2 
can exist in a gas, liquid, solid hydrate, or aqueous phase in sea water are given in Figure 6.8 (see Annex I).
  
At typical pressures and temperatures that exist in the ocean, pure CO2 would be a gas above approximately 500 m and a 
liquid below that depth. Between about 500 and 2700 m depth, liquid CO2 is lighter than sea water. Deeper than 3000 m, CO2 is 
denser than sea water. The buoyancy of CO2 released into the ocean determines whether released CO2 rises or falls in the ocean 
column (Figure 6.9). In the gas phase, CO2 is lighter than sea water and rises. In the liquid phase CO2 is a highly compressible 
fluid compared to sea water. A fully formed crystalline CO2 hydrate is denser than sea water and will form a sinking mass (Aya 
et al., 2003); hydrate formation can thus aid ocean CO2 storage by more rapid transport to depth, and by slowing dissolution. 
It may also create a nuisance by impeding flow in pipelines or at injectors.
  
The formation of a solid CO2 hydrate (Sloan, 1998) is a dynamic process (Figure 6.10; Brewer et al., 1998, 1999, 2000) 
and the nature of hydrate nucleation in such systems is imperfectly understood. Exposed to an excess of sea water, CO2 will 
eventually dissolve forming an aqueous phase with density higher than surrounding sea water. Release of dense or buoyant 
CO2 – in a gas, liquid, hydrate or aqueous phase – would entrain surrounding sea water and form plumes that sink, or rise, until 
dispersed.
Box 6.2 Physical properties of CO2.
Figure 6.8 CO2 sea water phase diagram. CO2 is stable in the liquid 
phase when temperature and pressure (increasing with ocean depth) 
fall in the region below the blue curve; a gas phase is stable under 
conditions above the blue dashed line. In contact with sea water 
and at temperature and pressure in the shaded region, CO2 reacts 
with sea water to from a solid ice-like hydrate CO2·6H2O. CO2 will 
dissolve in sea water that is not saturated with CO2. The red line 
shows how temperature varies with depth at a site off the coast of 
California; liquid and hydrated CO2 can exist below about 400 m 
(Brewer et al., 2004).
Figure 6.9 Shallower than 2500 m, liquid CO2 is less dense than sea 
water, and thus tends to float upward. Deeper than 3000 m, liquid CO2 
is denser than sea water, and thus tends to sink downwards. Between 
these two depths, the behaviour can vary with location (depending 
mostly on temperature) and CO2 can be neutrally buoyant (neither 
rises nor falls). Conditions shown for the northwest Atlantic Ocean.
Figure 6.10 Liquid CO2 released at 3600 metres initially forms a liquid CO2 pool on the sea floor in a small deep ocean experiment  
(upper picture). In time, released liquid CO2 reacts with sea water to form a solid CO2 hydrate in a similar pool (lower picture).
Chapter 6: Ocean storage
287
3000 m, liquid CO2 is denser than the surrounding sea water 
and sinks. CO2 nozzles could be engineered to produce large 
droplets that would sink to the sea floor or small droplets 
that would dissolve in the sea water before contacting the sea 
floor. Natural ocean mixing and droplet motion are expected 
to prevent concentrations of dissolved CO2 from approaching 
saturation, except near liquid CO2 that has been intentionally 
placed in topographic depressions on the sea floor.
 
Solid. Solid CO2 is denser than sea water and thus would 
tend to sink. Solid CO2 surfaces would dissolve in sea water at a 
speed of about 0.2 cm hr–1 (inferred from Aya et al., 1997). Thus 
small quantities of solid CO2 would dissolve completely before 
reaching the sea floor; large masses could potentially reach the 
sea floor before complete dissolution.
 
Hydrate. CO2 hydrate is a form of CO2 in which a cage of 
water molecules surrounds each molecule of CO2. It can form in 
average ocean waters below about 400 m depth. A fully formed 
crystalline CO2 hydrate is denser than sea water and will sink 
(Aya et al., 2003). The surface of this mass would dissolve at 
a speed similar to that of solid CO2, about 0.2 cm hr–1 (0.47 to 
0.60 µm s–1; Rehder et al., 2004; Teng et al., 1999), and thus 
droplets could be produced that either dissolve completely in 
the sea water or sink to the sea floor. Pure CO2 hydrate is a hard 
crystalline solid and will not flow through a pipe; however a 
paste-like composite of hydrate and sea water may be extruded 
(Tsouris et al., 2004), and this will have a dissolution rate 
intermediate between those of CO2 droplets and a pure CO2 
hydrate.
6.2.1.4 
 Behaviour of injected CO2 in the near field:  
 
CO2-rich plumes
As it leaves the near field, CO2 enriched water will reside at a 
depth determined by its density. The oceans are generally stably 
stratified with density increasing with depth. Parcels of water 
tend to move upward or downward until they reach water of 
the same density, then there are no buoyancy forces to induce 
further motion.
 
The dynamics of CO2-rich plumes determine both the depth at 
which the CO2 leaves the near-field environment and the amount 
of initial dilution (and consequently the amount of pH change). 
When CO2 is released in any form into seawater, the CO2 can 
move upward or downward depending on whether the CO2 is 
less or more dense than the surrounding seawater. Drag forces 
transfer momentum from the CO2 droplets to the surrounding 
water column producing motion in the adjacent water, initially 
in the direction of droplet motion. Simultaneously, the CO2 
dissolves into the surrounding water, making the surrounding 
water denser and more likely to sink. As the CO2-enriched water 
moves, it mixes with surrounding water that is less enriched in 
CO2, leading to additional dilution and diminishing the density 
contrast between the CO2-enriched water and the surrounding 
water.
 
CO2 releases could be engineered to produce CO2 plumes 
with different characteristics (Chen et al., 2003; Sato and Sato, 
2002; Alendal and Drange, 2001; Crounse et al., 2001; Drange 
et al., 2001; Figure 6.11). Modelling studies indicate that 
releases of small droplets at slow rates produce smaller plumes 
than release of large droplets at rapid rates. Where CO2 is denser 
than seawater, larger droplet sizes would allow the CO2 to sink 
more deeply. CO2 injected at intermediate depths could increase 
the density of CO2-enriched sea water sufficiently to generate 
a sinking plume that would carry the CO2 into the deep ocean 
(Liro et al., 1992; Haugan and Drange, 1992). Apparent coriolis 
forces would operate on such a plume, turning it towards the 
right in the Northern Hemisphere and towards the left in the 
Southern Hemisphere (Alendal et al., 1994). The channelling 
effects of submarine canyons or other topographic features 
could help steer dense plumes to greater depth with minimal 
dilution (Adams et al., 1995).
6.2.1.5 
Behaviour of injected CO2 in the far field
The far field is defined as the region in which the concentration 
of added CO2 is low enough such that the resulting density 
increase does not significantly affect transport, and thus CO2 
may be considered a passive tracer in the ocean. Typically, this 
would apply within a few kilometres of an injection point in 
midwater, but if CO2 is released at the sea floor and guided 
along topography, concentration may remain high and influence 
transport for several tens of kilometres. CO2 is transported by 
ocean currents and undergoes further mixing and dilution with 
other water masses (Alendal and Drange, 2001). Most of this 
mixing and transport occurs along surfaces of nearly constant 
density, because buoyancy forces inhibit vertical mixing in a 
stratified fluid. Over time, a release of CO2 becomes increasingly 
diluted but affects ever greater volumes of water.
 
The concept of ocean injection from a moving ship towing 
a trailing pipe was developed in order to minimize the local 
Figure 6.11 Simulated CO2 enriched sea water plumes (left panels; 
indicated by pH) and CO2 droplet plumes (right panels; indicated by 
kgCO2 m–3) created by injecting 1 cm and 12 cm liquid CO2 droplets 
(top and bottom panels, respectively) into the ocean from fixed nozzles 
(elapsed time is 30 min; injection rate is 1.0 kgCO2 s–1; ocean current 
speed is 5 cm s–1; Alendal and Drange, 2001). By varying droplet size, 
the plume can be made to sink (top panels) or rise (bottom panels).

environmental impacts by accelerating the dissolution and 
dispersion of injected liquid CO2 (Ozaki, 1997; Minamiura et 
al., 2004). A moving ship could be used to produce a sea water 
plume with relatively dilute initial CO2 concentrations (Figures 
6.12 and 6.13). In the upper ocean where CO2is less dense than 
seawater, nozzles engineered to produce mm-scale droplets 
would generate CO2 plumes that would rise less than 100 m.
 
Ocean general circulation models have been used to predict 
changes in ocean chemistry resulting from the dispersion of 
injected CO2 for hypothetical examples of ocean storage (e.g., 
Orr, 2004). Wickett et al. (2003) estimated that injection into 
the deep ocean at a rate of 0.37 GtCO2 yr–1 (= 0.1 GtC yr–1) 
for 100 years would produce a ∆pH < –0.3 over a volume of 
sea water equivalent to 0.01% or less of total ocean volume 
(Figure 6.14). In this example, for each GtCO2 released to the 
deep ocean, less than about 0.0001%, 0.001% and 0.01% of 
Figure 6.12 Simulated plumes (Chen et al., 2005) created by injecting liquid CO2 into the ocean from a fixed pipe (left panel) and a moving ship 
(right panel) at a rate of 100 kg s–1 (roughly equal to the CO2 from a 500 MWe coal-fired power plant). Left panel: injection at 875 m depth (12 
m from the sea floor) with an ocean current speed of 2.3 cm s–1. Right panel: injection at 1340 m depth from a ship moving at a speed of 3 m s–1. 
Note difference in pH scales; maximum pH perturbations are smaller in the moving ship simulation.
Figure 6.13 Volume of water with a ∆pH less than the value shown 
on the horizontal axis for the simulations shown in Figure 6.12 
corresponding to CO2 releases from a 500 MWe power plant. The fixed 
pipe simulation produces a region with ∆pH < –1, however, the moving 
ship disperses the CO2 more widely, largely avoiding pH changes of 
this magnitude.
Figure 6.14 Estimated volume of pH perturbations at basin scale 
(Wickett et al., 2003). Simulated fraction of global ocean volume with 
a ∆pH less than the amount shown on the horizontal axis, after 100 
years of simulated injection at a rate of 0.37 GtCO2 yr–1 (= 0.1 GtC 
yr–1) at each of four different points (two different depths near New 
York City and San Francisco). Model results indicate, for example, 
that injecting CO2 at this rate at a single location for 100 years could be 
expected to produce a volume of sea water with a ∆pH < –0.3 units in 
0.01% or less of total ocean volume (0.01% of the ocean is roughly 105 
km3). As with other simulations of direct CO2 injection in the ocean, 
results for the upper ocean (e.g., 800 m) tend to be more site-specific 
than are results for the deep ocean (e.g., 3000 m).
Chapter 6: Ocean storage
289
the ocean volume has ∆pH of less than –0.3, –0.2, and –0.1 
pH units respectively. Caldeira and Wickett (2005) predicted 
volumes of water undergoing a range of pH changes for several 
atmospheric emission and carbon stabilization pathways, 
including pathways in which direct injection of CO2 into the 
deep ocean was assumed to provide either 10% or 100% of 
the total atmospheric CO2 mitigation effort needed to stabilize 
atmospheric CO2 according to the WRE550 pathway. This 
assumed a CO2 production scenario in which all known fossil-
fuel resources were ultimately combusted. Simulations in which 
ocean injection provided 10% of the total mitigation effort, 
resulted in significant changes in ocean pH in year 2100 over 
roughly 1% of the ocean volume (Figure 6.15). By year 2300, 
injection rates have slowed but previously injected carbon has 
spread through much of the ocean resulting in an additional 0.1 
pH unit reduction in ocean pH over most of the ocean volume 
compared to WRE550.
6.2.1.6 Behaviour of CO2 lakes on the sea floor
Long-term storage of carbon dioxide might be more effective 
if CO2 were stored on the sea floor in liquid or hydrate form 
below 3000 metres, where CO2 is denser than sea water (Box 
6.2; Ohsumi, 1995; Shindo et al., 1995). Liquid carbon dioxide 
could be introduced at depth to form a lake of CO2 on the sea 
floor (Ohsumi, 1993). Alternatively, CO2 hydrate could be 
created in an apparatus designed to produce a hydrate pile or 
pool on the sea floor (Saji et al., 1992). To date, the concept 
of CO2 lakes on the sea floor has been investigated only in the 
laboratory, in small-scale (tens of litres) in-situ experiments and 
in numerical models. Larger-scale in-situ experiments have not 
yet been carried out.
 
Liquid or hydrate deposition of CO2 on the sea floor could 
increase isolation, however in the absence of a physical barrier 
the CO2 would dissolve into the overlying water (Mori and 
Mochizuki, 1998; Haugan and Alendal, 2005). In this aspect, 
most sea floor deposition proposals can be viewed as a means of 
‘time-delayed release’ of CO2 into the ocean. Thus, many issues 
relevant to sea floor options, especially the far-field behaviour, 
are discussed in sections relating to CO2 release into the water 
column (e.g., Section 6.2.1.5).
 
CO2 released onto the sea floor deeper than 3 km is denser 
than surrounding sea water and is expected to fill topographic 
depressions, accumulating as a lake of CO2 over which a thin 
hydrate layer would form. This hydrate layer would retard 
dissolution, but it would not insulate the lake from the overlying 
water. The hydrate would dissolve into the overlying water (or 
sink to the bottom of the CO2 lake), but the hydrate layer would 
be continuously renewed through the formation of new crystals 
(Mori, 1998). Laboratory experiments (Aya et al., 1995) and 
small deep ocean experiments (Brewer et al., 1999) show that 
deep-sea storage of CO2 would lead to CO2 hydrate formation 
(and subsequent dissolution).
 
Predictions of the fate of large-scale CO2 lakes rely on 
numerical simulations because no large-scale field experiments 
have yet been performed. For a CO2 lake with an initial depth 
of 50 m, the time of complete dissolution varies from 30 to 400 
years depending on the local ocean and sea floor environment. 
The time to dissolve a CO2 lake depends on its depth, complex

provides 100% or 10% of the mitigation effort needed to move from a logistic emissions curve cumulatively releasing 18,000 GtCO2 (=5000 
GtC) to emissions consistent with atmospheric CO2 stabilization at 550 ppm according to the WRE550 pathway (Wigley et al., 1996). The curves 
show the simulated fraction of ocean volume with a pH reduction greater than the amount shown on the horizontal axis. For the 10% case, in year 
2100, injection rates are high and about1% of the ocean volume has significant pH reductions; in year 2300, injection rates are low, but previously 
injected CO2 has decreased ocean pH by about 0.1 unit below the value produced by a WRE550 atmospheric CO2 pathway in the absence of CO2 
release directly to the ocean (Caldeira and Wickett, 2005).

dynamics of the ocean bottom boundary layer and its turbulence 
characteristics, mechanism of CO2 hydrate dissolution, and 
properties of CO2 in solution (Haugan and Alendal, 2005). The 
lifetime of a CO2 lake would be longest in relatively confined 
environments, such as might be found in some trenches or 
depressions with restricted flow (Ohgaki and Akano, 1992). 
Strong flows have been observed in trenches (Nakashiki, 
1997). Nevertheless, simulation of CO2 storage in a deep trench 
(Kobayashi, 2003) indicates that the bottom topography can 
weaken vertical momentum and mass transfer, slowing the CO2 
dissolution rate. In a quiescent environment, transport would 
be dominated by diffusion. Double-diffusion in the presence 
of strong stratification may produce long lake lifetimes. In 
contrast, the flow of sea water across the lake surface would 
increase mass transfer and dissolution. For example, CO2 lake 
lifetimes of >10,000 yr for a 50 m thick lake can be estimated 
from the dissolution rate of 0.44 cm yr–1 for a quiescent, purely 
diffusive system (Ohsumi, 1997). Fer and Haugan (2003) found 
that a mean horizontal velocity of 0.05 m s–1 would cause the 
CO2 lake to dissolve >25 times more rapidly (12 cm yr–1). 
Furthermore, they found that an ocean bottom storm with a 
horizontal velocity of 0.20 m s–1 could increase the dissolution 
rate to 170 cm yr–1.
6.2.2 
CO2 storage by dissolution of carbonate minerals
Over thousands of years, increased sea water acidity resulting 
from CO2 addition will be largely neutralized by the slow 
natural dissolution of carbonate minerals in sea-floor sediments 
and on land. This neutralization allows the ocean to absorb 
more CO2 from the atmosphere with less of a change in ocean 
pH, carbonate ion concentration, and pCO2 (Archer et al., 1997, 
1998). Various approaches have been proposed to accelerate 
carbonate neutralization, and thereby store CO2 in the oceans 
by promoting the dissolution of carbonate minerals2. These 
approaches (e.g., Kheshgi, 1995; Rau and Caldeira, 1999) do not 
entail initial separate CO2 capture and transport steps. However, 
no tests of these approaches have yet been performed at sea, 
so inferences about enhanced ocean CO2 storage, and effects 
on ocean pH are based on laboratory experiments (Morse and 
Mackenzie, 1990; Morse and Arvidson, 2002), calculations 
(Kheshgi, 1995), and models (Caldeira and Rau, 2000).
 
Carbonate neutralization approaches attempt to promote 
reaction (5) (in Box 6.1) in which limestone reacts with carbon 
dioxide and water to form calcium and bicarbonate ions in 
solution. Accounting for speciation of dissolved inorganic 
carbon in sea water (Kheshgi, 1995), for each mole of CaCO3 
dissolved there would be 0.8 mole of additional CO2 stored in 
sea water in equilibrium with fixed CO2 partial pressure (i.e., 
about 2.8 tonnes of limestone per tonne CO2). Adding alkalinity 
2 This approach is fundamentally different than the carbonate mineralization 
approach assessed in Chapter 7. In that approach CO2 is stored by reacting it with 
non-carbonate minerals to form carbonate minerals. In this approach, carbonate 
minerals are dissolved in the ocean, thereby increasing ocean alkalinity and 
increasing ocean storage of CO2. This approach could also make use of non-
carbonate minerals, if their dissolution would increase ocean alkalinity. 
to the ocean would increase ocean carbon storage, both in the 
near term and on millennial time scales (Kheshgi, 1995). The 
duration of increased ocean carbon storage would be limited 
by eventual CaCO3 sedimentation, or reduced CaCO3 sediment 
dissolution, which is modelled to occur through natural 
processes on the time scale of about 6,000 years (Archer et al., 
1997, 1998).
 
Carbonate minerals have been proposed as the primary source 
of alkalinity for neutralization of CO2 acidity (Kheshgi 1995; 
Rau and Caldeira, 1999). There have been many experiments 
and observations related to the kinetics of carbonate mineral 
dissolution and precipitation, both in fresh water and in sea 
water (Morse and Mackenzie, 1990; Morse and Arvidson, 2002). 
Carbonate minerals and other alkaline compounds that dissolve 
readily in surface sea water (such as Na2CO3), however, have 
not been found in sufficient quantities to store carbon in the 
ocean on scales comparable to fossil CO2 emissions (Kheshgi, 
1995). Carbonate minerals that are abundant do not dissolve 
in surface ocean waters. Surface ocean waters are typically 
oversaturated with respect to carbonate minerals (Broecker 
and Peng, 1982; Emerson and Archer, 1990; Archer, 1996), but 
carbonate minerals typically do not precipitate in sea water due 
to kinetic inhibitions (Morse and Mackenzie, 1990).
 
To circumvent the problem of oversaturated surface waters, 
Kheshgi (1995) considered promoting reaction (5) by calcining 
limestone to form CaO, which is readily soluble. If the energy for 
the calcining step was provided by a CO2-emission-free source, 
and the CO2 released from CaCO3 were captured and stored 
(e.g., in a geologic formation), then this process would store 1.8 
mole CO2 per mole CaO introduced into the ocean. If the CO2 
from the calcining step were not stored, then a net 0.8 mole CO2 
would be stored per mole CaO. However, if coal without CO2 
capture were used to provide the energy for calcination, and 
the CO2 produced in calcining was not captured, only 0.4 mole 
CO2 would be stored net per mole lime (CaO) to the ocean, 
assuming existing high-efficiency kilns (Kheshgi, 1995). This 
approach would increase the ocean sink of CO2, and does not 
need to be connected to a concentrated CO2 source or require 
transport to the deep sea. Such a process would, however, need 
to avoid rapid re-precipitation of CaCO3, a critical issue yet to 
be addressed.
 
Rau and Caldeira (1999) proposed extraction of CO2 from 
flue gas via reaction with crushed limestone and seawater. 
Exhaust gases from coal-fired power plants typically have 
15,000 ppmv of CO2 – over 400 times that of ambient air. A 
carbonic acid solution formed by contacting sea water with flue 
gases would accelerate the dissolution of calcite, aragonite, 
dolomite, limestone, and other carbonate-containing minerals, 
especially if minerals were crushed to increase reactive surface 
area. The solution of, for example, Ca2+ and dissolved inorganic 
carbon (primarily in the form of HCO3
–) in sea water could 
then be released back into the ocean, where it would be diluted 
by additional seawater. Caldeira and Rau (2000) estimate that 
dilution of one part effluent from a carbonate neutralization 
reactor with 100 parts ambient sea water would result, after 
equilibration with the atmosphere, in a 10% increase in the 
Chapter 6: Ocean storage
291
calcite saturation state, which they contend would not induce 
precipitation. This approach does not rely on deep-sea release, 
avoiding the need for energy to separate, transport and inject 
CO2 into the deep ocean. The wastewater generated by this 
carbonate-neutralization approach has been conjectured to be 
relatively benign (Rau and Caldeira, 1999). For example, the 
addition of calcium bicarbonate, the primary constituent of the 
effluent, has been observed to promote coral growth (Marubini 
and Thake, 1999). This approach will not remove all the CO2 
from a gas stream, because excess CO2 is required to produce a 
solution that is corrosive to carbonate minerals. If greater CO2 
removal were required, this approach could be combined with 
other techniques of CO2 capture and storage.
 
Process wastewater could be engineered to contain different 
ratios of added carbon and calcium, and different ratios of flue 
gas CO2 to dissolved limestone (Caldeira and Wickett, 2005). 
Processes involving greater amounts of limestone dissolution 
per mole CO2 added lead to a greater CO2 fraction being 
retained. The effluent from a carbonate-dissolution reactor 
could have the same pH, pCO2, or [CO3
2–] as ambient seawater, 
although processing costs may be reduced by allowing effluent 
composition to vary from these values (Caldeira and Rau, 2000). 
Elevation in Ca2+ and bicarbonate content from this approach 
is anticipated to be small relative to the already existing 
concentrations in sea water (Caldeira and Rau, 2000), but 
effects of the new physicochemical equilibria on physiological 
performance are unknown. Neutralization of carbon acidity 
by dissolution of carbonate minerals could reduce impacts 
on marine ecosystems associated with pH and CO3
2– decline 
(Section 6.7).
 
Carbonate neutralization approaches require large amounts 
of carbonate minerals. Sedimentary carbonates are abundant 
with estimates of 5 x 1017 tonnes (Berner et al., 1983), roughly 
10,000 times greater than the mass of fossil-fuel carbon. 
Nevertheless, up to about 1.5 mole of carbonate mineral must 
be dissolved for each mole of anthropogenic CO2 permanently 
stored in the ocean (Caldeira and Rau, 2000); therefore, the 
mass of CaCO3 used would be up to 3.5 times the mass of CO2 
stored. Worldwide, 3 Gt CaCO3 is mined annually (Kheshgi, 
1995). Thus, large-scale deployment of carbonate neutralization 
approaches would require greatly expanded mining and 
transport of limestone and attendant environmental impacts. In 
addition, impurities in dissolved carbonate minerals may cause 
deleterious effects and have yet to be studied.
6.2.3 
Other ocean storage approaches
Solid hydrate. Water reacts with concentrated CO2 to form a 
solid hydrate (CO2·6H2O) under typical ocean conditions at 
quite modest depths (Løken and Austvik, 1993; Holdren and 
Baldwin, 2001). Rehder et al. (2004) showed that the hydrate 
dissolves rapidly into the relatively dilute ocean waters. The 
density of pure CO2 hydrate is greater than seawater, and this 
has led to efforts to create a sinking plume of released CO2 in 
the ocean water column. Pure CO2 hydrate is a hard crystalline 
solid and thus will not flow through a pipe, and so some form of 
CO2 slurry is required for flow assurance (Tsouris et al., 2004).
 
Water-CaCO3-CO2 emulsion. Mineral carbonate could be 
used to physically emulsify and entrain CO2 injected in sea 
water (Swett et al. 2005); a 1:1 CO2:CaCO3 emulsion of CO2 
in water could be stabilized by pulverized limestone (CaCO3). 
The emulsion plume would have a bulk density of 40% greater 
than that of seawater. Because the emulsion plume is heavier 
than seawater, the CaCO3coated CO2 slurries may sink all the 
way to the ocean floor. It has been suggested that the emulsion 
plume would have a pH that is at least 2 units higher than would 
a plume of liquid CO2. Carbonate minerals could be mined 
on land, and then crushed, or fine-grained lime mud could 
be extracted from the sea floor. These fine-grain carbonate 
particles could be suspended in sea water upstream from the 
CO2-rich plume emanating from the direct CO2 injection site. 
The suspended carbonate minerals could then be transported 
with the ambient sea water into the plume, where the minerals 
could dissolve, increasing ocean CO2 storage effectiveness and 
diminishing the pH impacts of direct injection. 
 
Emplacement in carbonate sediments. Murray et al. (1997) 
have suggested emplacement of CO2 into carbonate sediments 
on the sea floor. Insofar as this CO2 remained isolated from the 
ocean, this could be categorized as a form of geological storage 
(Chapter 5).
 
Dry ice torpedoes. CO2 could be released from a ship as dry 
ice at the ocean surface (Steinberg,1985). One costly method 
is to produce solid CO2 blocks (Murray et al., 1996). With a 
density of 1.5 t m–3, these blocks would sink rapidly to the sea 
floor and could potentially penetrate into the sea floor sediment. 
 
Direct flue-gas injection. Another proposal is to take a 
power plant flue gas, and pump it directly into the deep ocean 
without any separation of CO2 from the flue gas, however costs 
of compression are likely to render this approach infeasible.
6.3   
Capacity and fractions retained
6.3.1 
Capacity
The physical capacity for storage of CO2 in the ocean is large 
relative to fossil-fuel resources. The degree to which this 
capacity will be utilized may be based on factors such as cost, 
equilibrium pCO2, and environmental consequences.
 
Storage capacity for CO2 in the ocean can be defined relative 
to an atmospheric CO2 stabilization concentration. For example, 
roughly 2,300 to 10,700 GtCO2 (above the natural pre-industrial 
background) would be added to the ocean in equilibrium with 
atmospheric CO2 stabilization concentrations, ranging from 350 
ppmv to 1000 ppmv, regardless of whether the CO2 is initially 
released to the ocean or the atmosphere (Table 6.1, Figure 6.3; 
Kheshgi et al., 2005; Sorai and Ohsumi, 2005). The capacity of 
the ocean for CO2 storage could be increased with the addition 
of alkalinity to the ocean (e.g., dissolved limestone).
6.3.2 
Measures of fraction retained
Effectiveness of ocean CO2 storage has been reported in a 
292
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
variety of ways. These different ways of reporting result in very 
different numerical values (Box 6.3). 
 
Over several centuries, CO2 released to the deep ocean 
would be transported to the ocean surface and interact with the 
atmosphere. The CO2-enriched water would then exchange CO2 
with the atmosphere as it approaches chemical equilibrium. In 
this chemical equilibrium, most of the injected CO2 remains 
in the ocean even though it is no longer isolated from the 
atmosphere (Table 6.1; Figure 6.3). CO2 that has interacted 
with the atmosphere is considered to be part of the natural 
carbon cycle, much in the way that CO2 released directly to 
the atmosphere is considered to be part of the natural carbon 
cycle. Such CO2 cannot be considered to be isolated from the 
atmosphere in a way that can be attributable to an ocean storage 
project.
 
Loss of isolation of injected CO2 does not mean loss of all 
of the injected CO2 to the atmosphere. In chemical equilibrium 
with an atmosphere containing 280 ppm CO2, about 85% of any 
carbon injected would remain the ocean. If atmospheric CO2 
partial pressures were to approach 1000 ppm, about 66% of the 
injected CO2 would remain in the ocean after equilibration with 
the atmosphere (Table 6.1). Thus, roughly 1/5 to 1/3 of the CO2 
injected into the ocean will eventually reside in the atmosphere, 
with this airborne fraction depending on the long-term 
atmosphere-ocean CO2 equilibrium (Kheshgi, 1995, 2004b). 
The airborne fraction is the appropriate measure to quantify the 
effect of ocean storage on atmospheric composition.
6.3.3 
Estimation of fraction retained from ocean 
observations
Observations of radiocarbon, CFCs, and other tracers indicate 
the degree of isolation of the deep sea from the atmosphere 
(Prentice et al., 2001). Radiocarbon is absorbed by the oceans 
from the atmosphere and is transported to the deep-sea, 
undergoing radioactive decay as it ages. Radiocarbon age 
(Figure 6.16) is not a perfect indicator of time since a water 
parcel last contacted the atmosphere because of incomplete 
equilibration with the atmosphere (Orr, 2004). Taking this 
partial equilibration into account, the age of North Pacific 
deep water is estimated to be in the range of 700 to 1000 years. 
Other basins, such as the North Atlantic, have characteristic 
overturning times of 300 years or more. This data suggests that, 
generally, carbon injected in the deep ocean would equilibrate 
with the atmosphere over a time scale of 300 to 1000 years.
6.3.4 
Estimation of fraction retained from model results 
Ocean models have been used to predict the isolation of injected 
CO2 from the atmosphere. Many models are calibrated using 
ocean radiocarbon data, so model-based estimates of retention 
of injected CO2 are not completely independent of the estimates 
based more directly on observations (Section 6.3.3).
 
A wide number of studies have used three-dimensional 
ocean general circulation models to study retention of CO2 
injected into the ocean water column (Bacastow and Stegen, 
1991; Bacastow et al., 1997; Nakashiki and Ohsumi, 1997; 
Dewey et al., 1997, 1999; Archer et al., 1998; Xu et al., 1999; 
Orr, 2004; Hill et al., 2004). These modelling studies generally 
confirm inferences based on simpler models and considerations 
of ocean chemistry and radiocarbon decay rates. In ocean 
general circulation simulations performed by seven modelling 
groups (Orr, 2004), CO2 was injected for 100 years at each of 
seven different locations and at three different depths. Model 
results indicate that deeper injections will be isolated from the 
atmosphere for longer durations. Figure 6.17 shows the effect 
of injection depth on retained fraction for the mean of seven 
ocean sites (Orr, 2004). Ranges of model results indicate some 
uncertainty in forecasts of isolation of CO2 released to the deep 
ocean, although for all models the time extent of CO2 isolation is 
longer for deeper CO2 release, and isolation is nearly complete 
for 100 years following CO2 release at 3000 m depth (Figure 
6.18 and 6.19). However, present-day models disagree as to the 
degassing time scale for particular locations (Figure 6.19). There 
seems to be no simple and robust correlation of CO2 retention 
other than depth of injection (Caldeira et al., 2002), however, 
there is some indication that the mean fraction retained for 
stored carbon is greater in the Pacific Ocean than the Atlantic 
Ocean, but not all models agree on this. Model results indicate 
that for injection at 1500 m depth, the time scale of the partial 
CO2 degassing is sensitive to the location of the injection, but at 
3000 m, results are relatively insensitive to injection location. 
Model results have been found to be sensitive to differences in 
numerical schemes and model parameterizations (Mignone et 
al., 2004).
6.4   
Site selection
6.4.1 
Background
There are no published papers specifically on site selection for 
intentional ocean storage of CO2; hence, we can discuss only 
general factors that might be considered when selecting sites for 
Figure 6.16 Map of radiocarbon (14C) age at 3500 m (Matsumoto and 
Key, 2004).
Chapter 6: Ocean storage
293
Box 6.3 Measures of the fraction of CO2 retained in storage
Different measures have been used to describe how effective intentional storage of carbon dioxide in the ocean is to mitigate 
climate change (Mueller et al., 2004). Here, we illustrate several of these measures using schematic model results reported by 
Herzog et al. (2003) for injection of CO2 at three different depths (Figure 6.17).
Fraction retained (see Chapter 1) is the fraction of the cumulative amount of injected CO2 that is retained in the storage 
reservoir over a specified period of time, and thereby does not have the opportunity to affect atmospheric CO2 concentration 
(Mignone et al., 2004). The retained fraction approaches zero (Figure 6.17) over long times, indicating that nearly all injected 
CO2 will interact with the atmosphere (although a small amount would interact first with carbonate sediments).
Airborne Fraction is the fraction of released CO2 that adds to atmospheric CO2 content (Kheshgi and Archer, 2004). For 
atmospheric release, airborne fraction is initially one and decays to roughly 0.2 (depending on atmospheric CO2 concentration) 
as the added CO2 is mixed throughout the ocean, and decays further to about 0.08 as CO2 reacts with sediments (Archer et al., 
1997). For deep-sea release, airborne fraction is initially zero and then approaches that of atmospheric release. Note that the 
asymptotic airborne fraction depends on the concentration of CO2 of surface waters (Figure 6.3).
     
Fraction retained is used throughout this report to indicate 
how long the CO2 is stored. In addition the following measures can 
be used to compare the effectiveness of ocean carbon storage with 
other options, for example:
• The Net Present value (NPV) approach (Herzog et al., 2003) 
considers temporary storage to be equivalent to delayed emission 
of CO2 to the atmosphere. The value of delaying CO2 emissions 
depends on the future costs of CO2 emission and economic discount 
rates. There is economic value to temporary storage (i.e., delayed 
emission) if the cost of CO2 emissions increases at a rate that is less 
than the discount rate (Herzog et al., 2003).
• The Global-Warming Potential (GWP) is a measure defined by 
the IPCC to compare the climatic effect of different greenhouse-
gas emissions. It is computed by accumulating the radiative climate 
forcing of a greenhouse-gas emission over a specified time horizon. 
This measure has been applied to compare the radiative forcing 
from oceanic and atmospheric releases of carbon dioxide (Kheshgi 
et al., 1994, Ramaswamy et al., 2001). Haugan and Joos (2004) 
propose a modification to the GWP approach that compares the 
climate effects of the airborne fraction of a CO2 release to the ocean 
with those from a release to the atmosphere. Table 6.2 compares 
these measures for results from a schematic model at three depths.
Figure 6.17 Fraction of carbon in the ocean from injection 
at three different depths and the atmosphere illustrated 
with results from a schematic model (Herzog et al., 2003). 
Calculations assume a background 280 ppm of CO2 in the 
atmosphere.

Value measure, the percentage represents the discount rate minus the rate of increase in the cost of CO2 emission. (If these are equal, the Net 
Present Value of temporary carbon storage is zero) Two significant digits shown for illustration exceed the accuracy of model results.

ocean storage. Among these considerations are environmental 
consequences, costs, safety, and international issues (including 
cross border transport). Because environmental consequences, 
costs, and social and political issues are addressed in other parts 
of this report, here we briefly consider site selection factors that 
enhance the fraction retained or reduce the costs.
6.4.2 
Water column release
Large point sources of CO2 located near deep water would 
generally be the most cost effective settings in which to carry 
out direct CO2 injection (Figure 6.21; Section 6.9). While  
models indicate that site-specific differences exist, they do not 
yet agree on the ranking of potential sites for effectiveness of 
direct injection CO2 operations (Orr, 2004).
Figure 6.19 Comparison of storage results for three injection locations 
(at 3000 m depth) in ten ocean model simulations (Orr, 2004). Models 
differ on predictions of CO2 fraction retained for release in different 
oceans. 
Figure 6.18 Results are shown for seven ocean general circulation 
models at three different depths averaged over seven injection 
locations (Orr, 2004). The percentage efficiency shown is the retained 
fraction for an injection at a constant rate from 2000 to 2100. Models 
agree that deeper injection isolates CO2 from the atmosphere longer 
than shallower injection. For release at 3000 m, most of the added 
carbon was still isolated from the atmosphere at the end of the 500 
year simulations.
Chapter 6: Ocean storage
295
6.4.3 
CO2 lakes on the sea floor
CO2 lakes must be on the sea floor at a depth below 3000 m 
(Figures 6.20 and 6.21), because the liquid CO2 must be denser 
than surrounding sea water (Box 6.2).
 
These ocean general circulation model calculations did not 
consider interactions with CaCO3 sediments or marine biota. 
Increased CO2 concentrations in the ocean promote dissolution 
of CaCO3 sediments, which would tend to increase predicted 
CO2 retention. This has been modelled for the deep sea with 
results of greater retention for release in the Atlantic because 
of high CaCO3 inventory in Atlantic sediments (Archer et al., 
1998).
 
Preliminary numerical simulations of ocean CO2 injection 
predict increased oceanic retention of injected CO2 with 
concurrent global warming due to weaker overturning and 
a more stratified ocean (Jain and Cao, 2005). Some evidence 
indicates recent increases in stratification in all major ocean 
basins (e.g., Joos, 2003; McPhaden and Zhang, 2002; Palmer et 
al., 2004; Stramma et al., 2004).
6.4.4 
Limestone neutralization
The amounts of sea water and limestone required to neutralize 
the acidity of added CO2 indicate that limestone neutralization 
would be most suitable for CO2 point sources located near both 
the ocean and large deposits of limestone (Rau and Caldeira, 
1999).
6.5  
injection technology and operations
6.5.1 
Background
The development of ocean storage technology is generally 
at a conceptual stage; thus, we will only discuss general 
principles. There has been limited engineering analysis and 
experimental studies of these conceptual technologies for ocean 
storage (Nihous, 1997), and no field-testing. No operational 
experience exists. Various technology concepts have been 
proposed to improve isolation from the atmosphere or diminish 
environmental consequences of CO2 injected into the ocean. 
Further research and development would be needed to make 
technologies available, but no major technical barriers are 
apparent.
6.5.2 
Water column release
Dispersal of liquid CO2 at a depth of 1000 m or deeper is 
technologically feasible. Since liquid CO2 may be relatively 
easily transported to appropriate depths, the preferred release 
mode is thought at this time to be as a liquid or dense gas phase 
(achieved by compression beyond its critical point, 72.8 bar at 
31°C). The pipes that would carry this CO2 to the deep ocean 
would be similar to the pipes that have been used commercially 
on land to transport CO2 for use in CO2 enhanced oil recovery 
projects (Ozaki et al., 1997). Models (Liro et al., 1992, Drange 
and Haugan, 1992) predict that, with a properly designed 
diffuser, nearly all the CO2 would dissolve in the ocean within 
a 100 m of the injection depth. Then, this CO2-rich water would 
be diluted as it disperses, primarily horizontally along surfaces 
of constant density.
 
Water column injection schemes typically envision 
minimizing local changes to ocean chemistry by producing a 
Figure 6.20 Locations of ocean water at least 1 km and 3 km deep. 
Distance over land to water that is at least 3 km deep (Caldeira and 
Wickett, 2005). In general, land areas with the lightest colours would 
be the most-cost effective land-based settings for a CO2-injection 
operation. However, each potential site would need to be evaluated 
prior to deployment.  
Figure 6.21 Relationship between depth and sea floor area. Flow in 
ocean bottom boundary layers would need to be taken into account 
when selecting a site for a CO2 lake. Bottom friction and turbulence 
can enhance the dissolution rate and vertical transport of dissolved CO2 
and lead to a short lifetime for the lake (Section 6.2.1.6). It has been 
suggested that CO2 lakes would be preferentially sited in relatively 
restricted depressions or in trenches on sea floor (Ohsumi, 1995).

relatively dilute initial injection through a series of diffusers or 
by other means. Dilution would reduce exposure of organisms 
to very low pH (very high CO2) environments (Section 6.7).
 
One set of options for releasing CO2 to the ocean involves 
transporting liquid CO2 from shore to the deep ocean in a 
pipeline. This would not present any major new problems in 
design, ‘according to petroleum engineers and naval architects 
speaking at one of the IEA Greenhouse Gas R&D Programme 
ocean storage workshops’ (Ormerod et al., 2002). The oil 
industry has been making great advances in undersea offshore 
technology, with projects routinely working at depths greater 
than 1000 m. The oil and the gas industry already places pipes 
on the bottom of the sea in depths down to 1600 m, and design 
studies have shown 3000 m to be technically feasible (Ormerod 
et al., 2002). The 1 m diameter pipe would have the capacity to 
transport 70,000 tCO2 day-1, enough for CO2 captured from 3 
GWe of a coal-fired electric power plant (Ormerod et al., 2002). 
Liro et al. (1992) proposed injecting liquid CO2 at a depth of 
about 1000 m from a manifold lying near the ocean bottom 
to form a rising droplet plume. Nihous et al. (2002) proposed 
injecting liquid CO2 at a depth of below 3000 m from a manifold 
lying near the ocean bottom and forming a sinking droplet 
plume. Engineering work would need to be done to assure that, 
below 500 m depth, hydrates do not form inside the discharged 
pipe and nozzles, as this could block pipe or nozzle flow.
 
CO2 could be transported by tanker for release from a 
stationary platform (Ozaki et al., 1995) or through a towed pipe 
(Ozaki et al., 2001). In either case, the design of CO2 tankers 
would be nearly identical to those that are now used to transport 
liquid petroleum gas (LPG). Cooling would be used, in order 
to reduce pressure requirements, with design conditions of –55 
degrees C and 6 bar pressure (Ormerod et al., 2002). Producing 
a dispersed initial concentration would diminish the magnitude 
of the maximum pH excursion. This would probably involve 
designing for the size of the initial liquid CO2 droplet and the 
turbulent mixing behind the towed pipe (Tsushima et al., 2002). 
Diffusers could be designed so that CO2 droplets would dissolve 
completely before they reach the liquid-gas phase boundary.
 
CO2 hydrate is about 15% denser than sea water, so it tends 
to sink, dissolving into sea water over a broad depth horizon 
(Wannamaker and Adams, 2002). Kajishima et al. (1997) and 
Saito et al. (2001) investigated a proposal to create a dense 
CO2-seawater mixture at a depth of between 500 and 1000 
m to form a current sinking along the sloping ocean bottom. 
Another proposal (Tsouris et al., 2004; West et al., 2003) 
envisions releasing a sinking CO2-hydrate/seawater slurry at 
between 1000 and 1500 m depth. This sinking plume would 
dissolve as it sinks, potentially distributing the CO2 over 
kilometres of vertical distance, and achieving some fraction of 
the CO2 retained in deep storage despite the initial release into 
intermediate waters. The production of a hydrate/seawater slurry 
has been experimentally demonstrated at sea (Tsouris et al., 
2004). Tsouris et al. (2004) have carried out a field experiment 
at 1000 m ocean depth in which rapid mixing of sea water with 
CO2 in a capillary nozzle to a neutrally buoyant composite paste 
takes place. This would enhance ocean retention time compared 
to that from creation of a buoyant plume. Aya et al. (2004) have 
shown that a rapidly sinking plume of CO2 can be formed by 
release of a slurry combining cold liquid and solid CO2 with a 
hydrate skin. This would effectively transfer ship released CO2 
at shallow ocean depth to the deep ocean without the cost of a 
long pipe. In all of these schemes the fate of the CO2 is to be 
dissolved into the ocean, with increased depth of dissolution, 
and thus increased retention.
6.5.3 
Production of a CO2 lake
Nakashiki (1997) investigated several different kinds of 
discharge pipes that could be used from a liquid CO2 tanker 
to create a CO2 lake on the sea floor. They concluded that a 
‘floating discharge pipe’ might be the best option because it is 
simpler than the alternatives and less likely to be damaged by 
wind and waves in storm conditions.
 
Aya et al. (2003) proposed creating a slurry of liquid CO2 
mixed with dry ice and releasing into the ocean at around 200 to 
500 m depth. The dry ice is denser that the surrounding sea water 
and would cause the slurry to sink. An in situ experiment carried 
out off the coast of California found that a CO2 slurry and dry 
ice mass with initial diameter about 8.0 cm sank approximately 
50 metres within two minutes before the dry ice melted (Aya et 
al., 2003). The initial size of CO2 slurry and dry ice is a critical 
factor making it possible to sink more than 3000 m to the sea 
floor. To meet performance criteria, the dry ice content would 
be controlled with a system consisting of a main power engine, 
a compressor, a condenser, and some pipe systems.

Monitoring�and�verification
6.6.1 
Background
Monitoring (Figure 6.22) would be done for at least two 
different purposes: (1) to gain specific information relating 
to a particular CO2 storage operation and (2) to gain general 
scientific understanding. A monitoring program should attempt 
to quantify the mass and distribution of CO2 from each point 
source and could record related biological and geochemical 
parameters. These same issues may relate to monitoring 
of potential leakages from subsea geologic storage, or for 
verification that such leakage does not occur. Monitoring 
protocols for submarine sewage disposal for example are 
already well established, and experience may be drawn from 
that.
6.6.2 
Monitoring amounts and distributions of materials 
released
6.6.2.1 
Monitoring the near field
It appears that there is no serious impediment to verifying plant 
compliance with likely performance standards for flow through 
a pipe. Once CO2 is discharged from the pipe then the specific 
monitoring protocols will depend upon whether the plume is 
buoyant or sinking. Fixed location injections present fewer 
Chapter 6: Ocean storage
297
verification difficulties than moving ship options.
 
For ocean injection from large point sources on land, 
verifying compliance involves above ground inspection of 
facilities for verification of flow and the CO2 purity being 
consistent with environmental regulations (e.g., trace metal 
concentrations, etc.). For a power plant, flue gases could be 
monitored for flow rate and CO2 partial pressure, thus allowing 
a full power plant carbon audit.
 
There are a variety of strategies for monitoring release of 
CO2 into the ocean from fixed locations. Brewer et al. (2005) 
observed a plume of CO2-rich sea water emanating from a small-
scale experimental release at 4 km depth with an array of pH and 
conductivity sensors. Measurements of ocean pH and current 
profiles at sufficiently high temporal resolution could be used to 
evaluate the rate of CO2 release, local CO2 accumulation and net 
transport away from the site (Sundfjord et al., 2001). Undersea 
video cameras can monitor the point of release to observe CO2 
flow. The very large sound velocity contrast between liquid CO2 
(about 300 m s–1) and sea water (about 1,500 m s–1) offers the 
potential for very efficient monitoring of the liquid CO2 phase 
using acoustic techniques (e.g., sonar).
 
The placement of CO2 directly in a lake on the sea floor 
can be verified, and the quantity and loss rate determined by 
a combination of acoustic, pH, and velocity measurements, 
and by direct inspection with underwater vehicles. Undersea 
vehicles, tethered or autonomous, could play a prominent role 
in monitoring and verification. Autonomous vehicles have 
been developed that can be programmed to efficiently follow 
a variety of complex trajectories over large areas (Simonetti, 
1998), but accurate pH sensing in a rapidly changing pressure 
and temperature field has yet to be demonstrated. Deep-sea pH 
monitoring from tethered vehicles has been shown to be very 
precise (Brewer et al., 2004), and these vehicles can routinely 
collect precisely located samples for later analysis.
6.6.2.2 
Monitoring the far field
It will be possible to monitor the far field distributions of 
injected CO2 using a combination of shipboard measurements 
and modelling approaches. The ability to identify pH plumes 
in the ocean has been well demonstrated (Figure 6.23). 
Current analytical techniques for measuring total CO2 in the 
ocean are accurate to about ±0.05% (Johnson et al., 1998). 
Thus, measurable changes could be seen with the addition 
of approximately 90 tonnes of CO2 per km3. In other words,  
Figure 6.22 Schematic of possible approaches for monitoring the 
injection of CO2 into the deep ocean via a pipeline. The grey region 
represents a plume of high CO2/low pH water extending from the end 
of the pipeline. Two sets of chemical, biological and current sensors 
and two underwater cameras are shown at the end of the pipeline. An 
array of moored sensors to monitor the direction and magnitude of 
the resulting plume can be seen around the pipe and are also located 
along the pipeline to monitor for possible leaks. A shore-based facility 
provides power to the sensors and for obtaining real-time data and 
an autonomous underwater vehicle maps the near-field distribution 
of the plume. A towed undulating pumping system monitors at 
distances of more than a few kilometres from the injection site. The 
towed system could provide much greater measurement accuracy and 
precision, but would also be able to provide measurements over large 
areas in a relatively short period of time. Moored systems are used 
to monitor the plume between mapping cruises. These moorings have 
surface buoys and make daily transmissions back to the monitoring 
facility via satellite. The very far-field distributions are monitored 
with hydrographic section cruises conducted every 2–5 years using 
standard discrete sampling approaches. These approaches provide the 
accuracy and precision required to detect the small CO2 signals that 
add to background variations.
Figure 6.23 Measurements showing the ability to measure chemical 
effects of a natural CO2 plume. Profiles for pH were taken in June 1999 
near the Axial Volcano at 46ºN 130ºW, in the ocean near Portland, 
Oregon, United States.
1 GtCO2 could be detected even if it were dispersed over 107 
km3 (i.e., 5000 km x 2000 km x 1 km), if the dissolved inorganic 
carbon concentrations in the region were mapped out with high-
density surveys before the injection began.
 
Variability in the upper ocean mixed layer would make it 
difficult to directly monitor small changes in CO2 in waters 
shallower than the annual maximum mixed-layer depth. 
Seasonal mixing from the surface can extend as deep as 800 
m in some places, but is less than 200 m in most regions of the 
ocean. Below the seasonal mixed layer, however, periodic ship-
based surveys (every 2 to 5 years) could quantify the expansion 
of the injection plume.
 
We do not have a direct means of measuring the evasion 
of carbon stored in the ocean to the atmosphere. In most cases 
of practical interest the flux of stored CO2 from the ocean to 
atmosphere will be small relative to natural variability and 
the accuracy of our measurements. Operationally, it would be 
impossible to differentiate between carbon that has and has not 
interacted with the atmosphere. The use of prognostic models in 
evaluating the long-term fate of the injected CO2 is critical for 
properly attributing the net storage from a particular site.
 
Given the natural background variability in ocean carbon 
concentrations, it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, 
to measure CO2 injected very far from the injection source. The 
attribution of a signal to a particular point source would become 
increasingly difficult if injection plumes from different locations 
began to overlap and mix. In some parts of the ocean it would 
be difficult to assign the rise in CO2 to intentional ocean storage 
as opposed to CO2 from atmospheric absorption.
6.6.3 
Approaches and technologies for monitoring 
environmental effects
Techniques now being used for field experiments could be 
used to monitor some near field consequences of direct CO2 
injection (Section 6.7). For example, researchers (Barry et al., 
2004, 2005; Carman et al., 2004; Thistle et al., 2005) have been 
developing experimental means for observing the consequences 
of elevated CO2 on organisms in the deep ocean. However, such 
experiments and studies typically look for evidence of acute 
toxicity in a narrow range of species (Sato, 2004; Caulfield et 
al., 1997; Adams et al., 1997; Tamburri et al., 2000). Sub-lethal 
effects have been studied by Kurihara et al. (2004). Process 
studies, surveys of biogeochemical tracers, and ocean bottom 
studies could be used to evaluate changes in ecosystem structure 
and dynamics both before and after an injection.
 
It is less clear how best to monitor the health of broad 
reaches of the ocean interior (Sections 6.7.3 and 6.7.4). Ongoing 
long-term surveys of biogeochemical tracers and deep-sea biota 
could help to detect long-term changes in deep-sea ecology.
6.7  
Environmental impacts, risks, and risk  
management
6.7.1 
Introduction to biological impacts and risk
Overall, there is limited knowledge of deep-sea population and 
community structure and of deep-sea ecological interactions 
(Box 6.4). Thus the sensitivities of deep ocean ecosystems 
to intentional carbon storage and the effects on possibly 
unidentified goods and services that they may provide remain 
largely unknown.
 
Most ocean storage proposals seek to minimize the volume 
of water with high CO2 concentrations either by diluting the 
CO2 in a large volume of water or by isolating the CO2 in a small 
volume (e.g., in CO2 lakes). Nevertheless, if deployed widely, 
CO2 injection strategies ultimately will produce large volumes 
of water with somewhat elevated CO2 concentrations (Figure 
6.15). Because large amounts of relatively pure CO2 have never 
been introduced to the deep ocean in a controlled experiment, 
conclusions about environmental risk must be based primarily on 
laboratory and small-scale in-situ experiments and extrapolation 
from these experiments using conceptual and mathematical 
models. Natural analogues (Box 6.5) can be relevant, but differ 
significantly from proposed ocean engineering projects.
 
Compared to the surface, most of the deep sea is stable and 
varies little in its physiochemical factors over time (Box 6.4). 
The process of evolutionary selection has probably eliminated 
individuals apt to endure environmental perturbation. As a result, 
deep-sea organisms may be more sensitive to environmental 
disturbance than their shallow water cousins (Shirayama, 
1997).
 
Ocean storage would occur deep in the ocean where there is 
virtually no light and photosynthesizing organisms are lacking, 
thus the following discussion primarily addresses CO2 effects 
on heterotrophic organisms, mostly animals. The diverse fauna 
that lives in the waters and sediments of the deep ocean can be 
affected by ocean CO2 storage, leading to change in ecosystem 
composition and functioning. Thus, the effects of CO2 need to 
be identified at the level of both the individual (physiological) 
and the ecosystem.
 
As described in Section 6.2, introduction of CO2 into the 
ocean either directly into sea water or as a lake on the sea floor 
would result in changes in dissolved CO2 near to and down 
current from a discharge point. Dissolving CO2 in sea water 
(Box 6.1; Table 6.3) increases the partial pressure of CO2 
(pCO2, expressed as a ppm fraction of atmospheric pressure, 
equivalent to µatm), causes decreased pH (more acidic) and 
decreased CO3
2– concentrations (less saturated). This can lead 
to dissolution of CaCO3 in sediments or in shells of organisms. 
Bicarbonate (HCO3
–) is then produced from carbonate (CO3
2–).
 
The spatial extent of the waters with increased CO2 content 
and decreased pH will depend on the amount of CO2 released 
and the technology and approach used to introduce that CO2 
into the ocean. Table 6.3 shows the amount of sea water needed 
to dilute each tonne of CO2 to a specified ∆pH reduction. 
Further dilution would reduce the fraction of ocean at one ∆pH

Photosynthesis produces organic matter in the ocean almost exclusively in the upper 200 m where there is both light and 
nutrients (e.g., PO4, NO3, NH4
+, Fe). Photosynthesis forms the base of a marine food chain that recycles much of the carbon 
and nutrients in the upper ocean. Some of this organic matter ultimately sinks to the deep ocean as particles and some of it is 
mixed into the deep ocean as dissolved organic matter. The flux of organic matter from the surface ocean provides most of the 
energy and nutrients to support the heterotrophic ecosystems of the deep ocean (Gage and Tyler, 1991). With the exception of 
the oxygen minimum zone and near volcanic CO2 vents, most organisms living in the deep ocean live in low and more or less 
constant CO2 levels.
 
 
At low latitudes, oxygen consumption and CO2 release can produce a zone at around 1000 m depth characterized by 
low O2 and high CO2 concentrations, known as the ‘oxygen minimum zone’. Bacteria are the primary consumers of organic 
matter in the deep ocean. They obtain energy predominately by consuming dissolved oxygen in reactions that oxidize organic 
carbon into CO2. In the oxygen minimum layer, sea water pH may be less than 7.7, roughly 0.5 pH units lower than average 
pH of natural surface waters (Figure 6.6).
 
At some locations near the sea floor, especially near submarine volcanic CO2 sources, CO2 concentrations can fluctuate 
greatly. Near deep-sea hydrothermal vents CO2 partial pressures (pCO2, expressed as a ppm fraction of atmospheric pressure, 
equivalent to µatm) of up to 80,000 ppm have been observed. These are more than 100 times the typical value for deep-
sea water. Typically, these vents are associated with fauna that have adapted to these conditions over evolutionary time.  
For example, tube worms can make use of high CO2 levels for chemosynthetic CO2 fixation in association with symbiotic 
bacteria (Childress et al., 1993). High CO2 levels (up to a pCO2 of 16,000 ppm; Knoll et al., 1996) have been observed in 
ocean bottom waters and marine sediments where there are high rates organic matter oxidation and low rates of mixing with 
the overlying seawater. Under these conditions, high CO2 concentrations are often accompanied by low O2 concentrations. 
Near the surface at night, respiratory fluxes in some relatively confined rock pools of the intertidal zone can produce high CO2 
levels. These patterns suggest that in some environments, organisms have evolved to tolerate relatively wide pH oscillations 
and/or low pH values.
 
 
Deep-sea ecosystems generally depend on sinking particles of organic carbon made by photosynthesis near the ocean 
surface settling down through the water. Most species living in the deep sea display very low metabolic rates (Childress, 1995), 
especially in oxygen minimum layers (Seibel et al., 1997). Organisms living in the deep seawaters have adapted to the energy-
limited environment by conserving energy stores and minimizing energy turnover. As a result of energy limitations and cold 
temperatures found in the deep sea, biological activities tend to be extremely low. For example, respiration rates of rat-tail fish 
are roughly 0.1% that of their shallow-water relatives. Community respiration declines exponentially with depth along the 
California margin, however, rapid turnover of large quantities of organic matter has been observed on the ocean floor (Mahaut 
et al., 1995; Smith and Demopoulos, 2003). Thus, biological activity of some animals living on the deep sea floor can be as 
great as is found in relatives living on the sea floor in shallow waters.
 
Deep-sea ecosystems may take a long time to recover from disturbances that reduce population size. Organisms have 
adapted to the energy-limited environment of the deep sea by limiting investment in reproduction, thus most deep-sea species 
produce few offspring. Deep-sea species tend to invest heavily in each of their eggs, making them large and rich in yolk to 
provide the offspring with the resources they will need for survival. Due to their low metabolic rates, deep-sea species tend 
to grow slowly and have much longer lifespans than their upper-ocean cousins. For example, on the deep-sea floor, a bivalve 
less than 1 cm across can be more than 100 years old (Gage, 1991). This means that populations of deep-sea species will be 
more greatly affected by the loss of individual larvae than would upper ocean species. Upon disturbance, recolonization and 
community recovery in the deep ocean follows similar patterns to those in shallow waters, but on much longer time scales 
(several years compared to weeks or months in shallow waters, Smith and Demopoulos, 2003).
 
 
The numbers of organisms living on the sea floor per unit area decreases exponentially with depth, probably associated 
with the diminishing flux of food with depth. On the sea floor of the deepest ocean and of the upper ocean, the fauna can 
be dominated by a few species. Between 2000 and 3000 m depth ecosystems tend to have high species diversity with a low 
number of individuals, meaning that each species has a low population size (Snelgrove and Smith, 2002). The fauna living in 
the water column appear to be less diverse than that on the sea floor, probably due to the relative uniformity of vast volumes 
of water in the deep ocean.

IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
There are several examples of natural systems with strong CO2 sources in the ocean, and fluid pools toxic to marine life that 
may be examined to better understand possible physical and biological effects of active CO2 injection.
Most natural environments that are heavily enriched in CO2 (or toxic substances) host life forms that have adapted to these 
special conditions on evolutionary time scales. During Earth history much of the oceans may have hosted life forms specialized 
on elevated pCO2, which are now extinct. This limits the use of natural analogues or Earth history to predict and generalize 
effects of CO2 injection on most extant marine life.
•  Venting of carbon dioxide-rich fluids: Hydrothermal vents, often associated with mid-ocean-ridge systems, often release 
CO2 rich fluids into the ocean and can be used to study CO2 behaviour and effects. For example, Sakai et al. (1990) 
observed buoyant hydrate forming fluids containing 86–91% CO2 (with H2S, and methane etc. making up the residual) 
released from the sea floor at 1335–1550 m depth from a hydrothermal vent field. These fluids would be similar to a heavily 
contaminated industrial CO2 source. These fluids arise from the reaction of sea water with acid and intermediate volcanic 
rocks at high temperature; they are released into sea water of 3.8°C. A buoyant hydrate-coated mass forms at the sea floor, 
which then floats upwards dissolving into the ocean water. Sea floor venting of aqueous fluids, rich in CO2 and low in pH 
(3.5–4.4), is also to be found in some hydrothermal systems (Massoth et al., 1989; Karl, 1995).
  Near volcanic vents, deep-sea ecosystems can be sustained by a geochemical input of chemical energy and CO2. While 
there has been extensive investigation of these sites, and the plumes emanating from them, this has not yet been in the 
context of analogues for industrial CO2 storage effects. Such an investigation would show how a fauna has evolved to adapt 
to a high-CO2 environment; it would not show how biota adapted to normal ocean water would respond to increased CO2 
concentrations.*
•  Deep saline brine pools: The ocean floor is known to have a large number of highly saline brine pools that are anoxic and 
toxic to marine life. The salty brines freely dissolve, but mixing into the overlying ocean waters is impeded by the stable 
stratification imparted by the high density of the dissolving brines. The Red Sea contains many such brine pools (Degens 
and Ross, 1969; Anschutz et al., 1999), some up to 60 km2 in area, filled with high-temperature hyper-saline, anoxic, brine. 
Animals cannot survive in these conditions, and the heat and salt that are transported across the brine-seawater interface 
form a plume into the surrounding bottom water. Hydrothermal sources resupply brine at the bottom of the brine pool 
(Anschutz and Blanc, 1996). The Gulf of Mexico contains numerous brine pools. The largest known is the Orca Basin, 
where a 90 km2 brine pool in 2250 m water depth is fed by drainage from exposed salt deposits. The salt is toxic to life, but 
biogeochemical cycles operate at the interface with the overlying ocean (van Cappellen et al., 1998). The Mediterranean 
also contains numerous large hypersaline basins (MEDRIFF Consortium, 1995).
  Taken together these naturally occurring brine pools provide examples of vast volumes of soluble, dense, fluids, hostile 
to marine life, on the sea floor. The number, volume, and extent of these pools exceed those for scenarios for CO2 lake 
formation yet considered. There has been little study of the impact of the plumes emanating from these sources. These 
could be examined to yield information that may be relevant to environmental impacts of a lake of CO2 on the ocean 
floor.
•  Changes over geological time: In certain times in Earth’s geological past the oceans may have contained more dissolved 
inorganic carbon and/or have had a lower pH.
  There is evidence of large-scale changes in calcifying organism distributions in the oceans in the geological record that 
may be related in changes in carbonate mineral saturation states in the surface ocean. For example, Barker and Elderfield 
(2002) demonstrated that glacial-interglacial changes in the shell weights of several species of planktonic foraminifera are 
negatively correlated with atmospheric CO2 concentrations, suggesting a causal relationship.
  Cambrian CO2 levels (i.e., about 500 million years ago) were as high as 5000 ppm and mean values decreased progressively 
thereafter (see. Dudley, 1998; Berner, 2002). Two to three times higher than extant ocean calcium levels ensured that 
calcification of, for example, coral reefs was enabled in paleo-oceans despite high CO2 levels (Arp et al., 2001). High 
performance animal life appeared in the sea only after atmospheric CO2 began to diminish. The success of these creatures 
may have depended on the reduction of atmospheric CO2 levels (reviewed by Pörtner et al., 2004, 2005).
  CO2 is also thought to have been a potential key factor in the late Permian/Triassic mass extinction, which affected corals, 
articulate brachiopods, bryozoans, and echinoderms to a larger extent than molluscs, arthropods and chordates (Knoll et al., 
1996; Berner, 2002; Bambach et al., 2002). Pörtner et al. (2004) hypothesized that this may be due to the corrosive effect 
of CO2 on heavily calcified skeletons. CO2 excursions would have occurred in the context of large climate oscillations. 
Effects of temperature oscillations, hypoxia events and CO2 excursions probably contributed to extinctions (Pörtner et al., 
2005, see section 6.7.3).

while increasing the volume of water experiencing a lesser 
∆pH. Further examples indicating the spatial extent of ocean 
chemistry change from added CO2 are represented in Figures 
6.11, 6.12, 6.13, 6.14, and 6.15.
 
On evolutionary time scales most extant animal life has 
adapted to, on average, low ambient CO2 levels. Accordingly, 
extant animal life may rely on these low pCO2 values and it 
is unclear to what extent species would be able to adapt to 
permanently elevated CO2 levels. Exposure to high CO2 levels 
and extremely acidic water can cause acute mortality, but more 
limited shifts in CO2, pH, and carbonate levels can be tolerated 
at least temporarily. Studies of shallow water organisms have 
identified a variety of physiological mechanisms by which 
changes in the chemical environment can affect fauna. These 
mechanisms should also apply to organisms living in the deep 
ocean. However, knowing physiological mechanisms alone 
does not enable full assessment of impacts at ecosystem levels. 
Long-term effects, for intervals greater than the duration of 
the reproduction cycle or the lifespan of an individual, may be 
overlooked, yet may still drastically change an ecosystem.
 
Species living in the open ocean are exposed to low and 
relatively constant CO2 levels, and thus may be sensitive to CO2 
exposure. In contrast, species dwelling in marine sediments, 
especially in the intertidal zone, are regularly exposed to CO2 
fluctuations and thus may be better adapted to high and variable 
CO2 concentrations. Physiological mechanisms associated with 
CO2 adaptation have been studied mostly in these organisms. 
They respond to elevated CO2 concentrations by transiently 
diminishing energy turnover. However, such responses are 
likely become detrimental during long-term exposure, as 
reduced metabolism involves a reduction in physical activity, 
growth, and reproduction. Overall, marine invertebrates appear 
more sensitive than fish (Pörtner et al., 2005).
 
CO2 effects have been studied primarily in fish and 
invertebrates from shallow waters, although some of these cover 
wide depth ranges down to below 2000 m or are adapted to 
cold temperatures (e.g., Langenbuch and Pörtner, 2003, 2004). 
Some in situ biological experiments used CO2 in the deep ocean 
(See Box 6.6).

part thereof) is surrounded by high concentrations of CO2. 
Under these conditions, CO2 enters the organisms by diffusion 
across body and especially respiratory surfaces and equilibrates 
with all body compartments. This internal accumulation of CO2 
will be responsible for most of the effects observed in animals 
(reviewed by Pörtner and Reipschläger, 1996, Seibel and 
Walsh, 2001, Ishimatsu et al., 2004, 2005; Pörtner et al., 2004, 
2005). Respiratory distress, narcosis, and mortality are the 
most obvious short-term effects at high CO2 concentrations, but 
lower concentrations may have important effects on longer time 
scales. The CO2 level to which an organism has acclimated may 
affect its acute critical CO2 thresholds, however, the capacity to 
acclimate has not been investigated to date.
6.7.2.2 
Effects of CO2 versus pH
Typically, tolerance limits to CO2 have been characterized by 
changes in ocean pH or pCO2 (see Shirayama, 1995; Auerbach 
et al., 1997). However, changes in molecular CO2, carbonate, 
and bicarbonate concentrations in ambient water and body 
fluids may each have specific effects on marine organisms 
(Pörtner and Reipschläger, 1996). In water breathers like fish 
or invertebrates CO2 entry causes immediate disturbances in 
acid-base status, which need to be compensated for by ion 
exchange mechanisms. The acute effect of CO2 accumulation 
is more severe than that of the reduction in pH or carbonate-
ion concentrations. For example, fish larvae are more sensitive 
to low pH and high CO2 than low pH and low CO2 (achieved 
by addition of HCl with pCO2 levels kept low by aeration; 
Ishimatsu et al., 2004).
 
CO2 added to sea water will change the hydrogen ion 
concentration (pH). This change in hydrogen ion concentration 
may affect marine life through mechanisms that do not directly 
involve CO2. Studies of effects of lowered pH (without 
concomitant CO2 accumulation) on aquatic organisms have a

IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
In-situ experiments concerning the sensitivity of deep and 
shallow-living marine biota to elevated carbon dioxide levels 
have been limited in scope. Significant CO2 effects have been 
observed in experiments, consistent with the mechanisms of 
CO2 action reported in Section 6.7.2. Some animals avoid 
CO2 plumes, others do not.
 Studies evaluating the behaviour and survival of deep-
sea animals exposed to liquid CO2 or to CO2-rich sea water 
have been performed on the continental slope and rise off 
California. Experiments in which about 20–70 kg of liquid 
CO2 were released in small corrals on the sea floor at 3600 
m depth were used to measure the response of animals that 
came in contact with liquid CO2, and to the dissolution 
plume emanating from CO2 pools (Barry et al., 2004). Larger 
bottom-living animals collected from the sea floor were held 
in cages and placed at distances of 1–50 m from CO2 pools. In 
addition, organisms living in the sediment were collected at 
a range of distances from CO2 pools, both before CO2 release 
and 1–3 months later.
 The response of animals to direct contact with liquid CO2 
varied among species. Sea cucumbers (holothurians like 
Scotoplanes sp.) and brittle stars (ophiuroids, unidentified 
species) died immediately after contact with liquid CO2 (Barry 
et al., 2005). A few individuals (<5 individuals) of deep-sea 
fish (grenadiers, Coryphaenoides armatus) that approached 
CO2 pools and made contact with the fluid turned immediately 
and swam out of view. Other deep-sea experiments (Tamburri 
et al. 2000) evaluating the behavioural response of animals 
to a saturated CO2 / sea water solution have shown that some 
scavenger species (deep-sea hagfish) will not avoid acidic, 
CO2-rich seawater if chemical cues from decaying bait are 
also present. In fact, hagfish would maintain contact with the 
CO2-rich / bait-scented plume long enough to be apparently 
‘narcotized’ by the CO2.
 Survival rates of abyssal animals exposed to CO2 dissolution 
plumes in these experiments varied with the range of pH 
perturbation and the distance from the CO2 source. Abyssal 
animals held in cages or inhabiting sediments that were near 
(<1 m) CO2 pools, and which were exposed episodically to 
large pH reduction (1–1.5 pH units) experienced high rates 
of mortality (>80%). Animals affected included small (meio-
)fauna (flagellates, amoebae, nematodes; Barry et al., 2004) 
and larger (macro and mega-)fauna (Ampeliscid amphipod 
species, invertebrates like holothurians, echinoids, and fish 
like macrourids). Other fish like eelpout (zoarcids), however, 
all survived month-long exposure to episodic pH shifts of 
about –1.0 pH units. Animals held further (3–10 m) from CO2 
pools were exposed to mild episodic pH reductions (about 
0.1 – 0.2 pH units) exhibited mortality rates were (about 20–
50%) higher than at control sites (Barry et al., 2005).
 It is unknown whether mortality was caused primarily by 
short-term exposure to large pH / CO2 shifts or by chronic, 
milder pH perturbations. Tidal variation in current direction 
resulted in a highly variable exposure to pH perturbations
with the most intense exposure to dissolution plumes when 
the current was flowing directly towards the study animals. 
During other tidal periods there was often no pH reduction, 
increasing the difficulty of interpreting these experiments.
 
Three controlled in-situ experiments were carried out at 
2000 m in the Kumano Trough using a specially designed 
chamber (Figure 6.24; Ishida et al. 2005) to address the 
impact of 5,000 and 20,000 ppm rises in pCO2 (with resulting 
pHs of 6.8 and 6.3) on the abundance and diversity of bacteria 
and of small animals (nano- and meiobenthos). Significant 
impacts of elevated pCO2 on meiobenthic organisms could 
not be found except for one case where the abundance of 
foraminifera decreased significantly within 3 days at 20,000 
ppm. The abundance of nanobenthos decreased significantly 
in most cases, whereas the abundance of bacteria increased at 
20,000 ppm (Figure 6.25).
 
In-situ studies of short-term effects of elevated CO2 
concentrations on deep-sea megafauna have been conducted 
using CO2 released naturally from the Loihi Seamount 
(Hawaii) at depths of 1200 to 1300 m (Vetter and Smith, 
2005). A submersible was used to manipulate baited traps and 
bait parcels in Loihi’s CO2 plume to explore the effects of 
elevated CO2 on typical deep-sea scavengers. Vent-specialist 
shrimp were attracted to the bait and proved to be pre-adapted 
to the high CO2 levels found close to volcanic vents. Free 
swimming, amphipods, synaphobranchid eels, and hexanchid 
sharks avoided open bait parcels placed in the CO2 plumes

(Ishida et al. 2004). The bottom part houses a chamber that penetrates 
into the sediment. The top part houses electronics, pumps, valves, 
and water bags, that are used to control the CO2 concentration inside 
the chamber, and to sample sea water in the chamber at designated 
times. At the time of recovery, the bottom of the chamber is closed, 
weights are released, and the system returns to the surface of the 
ocean using buoyancy provided by the glass bulbs (yellow structures 
around the top).

long history, with an emphasis on freshwater organisms (Wolff 
et al., 1988). Observed consequences of lowered water pH (at 
constant pCO2) include changes in production/productivity 
patterns in algal and heterotrophic bacterial species, changes 
in biological calcification/ decalcification processes, and acute 
and sub-acute metabolic impacts on zooplankton species, 
ocean bottom species, and fish. Furthermore, changes in the 
pH of marine environments affect: (1) the carbonate system, 
(2) nitrification (Huesemann et al., 2002) and speciation of 
nutrients such as phosphate, silicate and ammonia (Zeebe 
and Wolf-Gladrow, 2001), and (3) speciation and uptake of 
essential and toxic trace elements. Observations and chemical 
calculations show that low pH conditions generally decrease 
the association of metals with particles and increase the 
proportion of biologically available free metals (Sadiq, 1992; 
Salomons and Forstner, 1984). Aquatic invertebrates take 
up both essential and non-essential metals, but final body 
concentrations of metals vary widely across invertebrates. In 
the case of many trace metals, enhanced bioavailability is likely 
to have toxicological implications, since free forms of metals 
are of the greatest toxicological significance (Rainbow, 2002).
6.7.2.3 
Acute CO2 sensitivity: oxygen transport in squid and 
fish
CO2 accumulation and uptake can cause anaesthesia in many 
animal groups. This has been observed in deep-sea animals close 
to hydrothermal vents or experimental CO2 pools. A narcotic 
effect of high, non-determined CO2 levels was observed in deep-
sea hagfish after CO2 exposure in situ (Tamburri et al., 2000). 
Prior to anaesthesia high CO2 levels can exert rapid effects on 
oxygen transport processes and thereby contribute to acute CO2 
effects including early mortality.
 
Among invertebrates, this type of CO2 sensitivity may be 
highest in highly complex, high performance organisms like 
squid (reviewed by Pörtner et al., 2004). Blue-blooded squid 
do not possess red blood cells (erythrocytes) to protect their 
extracellular blood pigment (haemocyanin) from excessive 
pH fluctuations. Acute CO2 exposure causes acidification of 
the blood, will hamper oxygen uptake and binding at the gills 
and reduce the amount of oxygen carried in the blood, limiting 
performance, and at high concentrations could cause death. 
Less oxygen is bound to haemocyanin in squid than is bound to 
haemoglobin in bony fish (teleosts). Jet-propulsion swimming 
of squid demands a lot of oxygen. Oxygen supply is supported 
by enhanced oxygen binding with rising blood pH (and reduced 
binding of oxygen with falling pH – a large Bohr effect3). 
Maximizing of oxygen transport in squid thus occurs by means 
of extracellular pH oscillations between arterial and venous 
blood. Therefore, finely controlled extracellular pH changes 
are important for oxygen transport. At high CO2 concentrations, 
animals can asphyxiate because the blood cannot transport 
enough oxygen to support metabolic functions. In the most 
active open ocean squid (Illex illecebrosus), model calculations 
predict acute lethal effects with a rise in pCO2 by 6500 ppm and 
a 0.25 unit drop in blood pH. However, acute CO2 sensitivity 
varies between squid species. The less active coastal squid 
(Loligo pealei) is less sensitive to added CO2.
 
In comparison to squid and other invertebrates, fish (teleosts) 
appear to be less sensitive to added CO2, probably due to their 
lower metabolic rate, presence of red blood cells (erythrocytes 
containing haemoglobin) to carry oxygen, existence of a 
venous oxygen reserve, tighter epithelia, and more efficient 
acid-base regulation. Thus, adult teleosts (bony fish) exhibit a 
larger degree of independence from ambient CO2. A number of 
tested shallow-water fish have shown relatively high tolerance 
to added CO2, with short-term lethal limits of adult fish at a 
pCO2 of about 50,000 to 70,000 ppm. European eels (Anguilla 
anguilla) displayed exceptional tolerance of acute hypercapnia 
up to 104,000 ppm (for review see Ishimatsu et al., 2004, Pörtner 
et al., 2004). The cause of death in fish involves a depression 
of cardiac functions followed by a collapse of oxygen delivery 
to tissues (Ishimatsu et al., 2004). With mean lethal CO2 levels 
of 13,000 to 28,000 ppm, juveniles are more sensitive to acute 
CO2 stress than adults. In all of these cases, the immediate cause 
of death appears to be entry of CO2 into the organism (and not 
primarily some other pH-mediated effect).
3 The Bohr Effect is an adaptation in animals to release oxygen in the oxygen 
starved tissues in capillaries where respiratory carbon dioxide lowers blood 
pH. When blood pH decreases, the ability of the blood pigment to bind to 
oxygen decreases. This process helps the release of oxygen in the oxygen-poor 
environment of the tissues. Modified after ISCID Encyclopedia of Science 
and Philosophy. 2004. International Society for Complexity, Information, and 
Design. 12 October 2004 <http://www.iscid.org/encyclopedia/Bohr_Effect>.

IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
 
Fish may be able to avoid contact to high CO2 exposure 
because they possess highly sensitive CO2 receptors that could 
be involved in behavioural responses to elevated CO2 levels 
(Yamashita et al., 1989). However, not all animals avoid low 
pH and high concentrations of CO2; they may actively swim 
into CO2-rich regions that carry the odour of potential food 
(e.g., bait; Tamburri et al., 2000, Box 6.6).
 
Direct effects of dissolved CO2 on diving marine air 
breathers (mammals, turtles) can likely be excluded since they 
possess higher pCO2 values in their body fluids than water 
breathers and gas exchange is minimized during diving. They 
may nonetheless be indirectly affected through potential CO2 
effects on the food chain (see 6.7.5).
6.7.2.4 
Deep compared with shallow acute CO2 sensitivity
Deep-sea organisms may be less sensitive to high CO2 levels 
than their cousins in surface waters, but this is controversial. 
Fish (and cephalopods) lead a sluggish mode of life with reduced 
oxygen demand at depths below 300 to 400 m. Metabolic 
activity of pelagic animals, including fish and cephalopods, 
generally decreases with depth (Childress, 1995; Seibel et 
al., 1997). However, Seibel and Walsh (2001) postulated that 
deep-sea animals would experience serious problems in oxygen 
supply under conditions of increased CO2 concentrations. They 
refer to midwater organisms that may not be representative of 
deep-sea fauna; as residents of so-called ‘oxygen minimum 
layers’ they have special adaptations for efficient extraction of 
oxygen from low-oxygen waters (Sanders and Childress, 1990; 
Childress and Seibel, 1998).
6.7.2.5 
Long-term CO2 sensitivity
Long-term impacts of elevated CO2 concentrations are more 
pronounced on early developmental than on adult stages 
of marine invertebrates and fish. Long-term depression of 
physiological rates may, over time scales of several months, 
contribute to enhanced mortality rates in a population 
(Shirayama and Thornton, 2002, Langenbuch and Pörtner, 
2004). Prediction of future changes in ecosystem dynamics, 
structure and functioning therefore requires data on sub-lethal 
effects over the entire life history of organisms.
 
The mechanisms limiting performance and long-term 
survival under moderately elevated CO2 levels are even 
less clear than those causing acute mortality. However, they 
appear more important since they may generate impacts in 
larger ocean volumes during widespread distribution of CO2 
at moderate levels on long time scales. In animals relying on 
calcareous exoskeletons, physical damage may occur under 
permanent CO2 exposure through reduced calcification and 
even dissolution of the skeleton, however, effects of CO2 on 
calcification processes in the deep ocean have not been studied 
to date. Numerous studies have demonstrated the sensitivity of 
calcifying organisms living in surface waters to elevated CO2 
levels on longer time scales (Gattuso et al. 1999, Reynaud et 
al., 2003, Feeley et al., 2004 and refs. therein). At least a dozen 
laboratory and field studies of corals and coralline algae have 
suggested reductions in calcification rates by 15–85% with 
a doubling of CO2 (to 560 ppmv) from pre-industrial levels. 
Shirayama and Thornton (2002) demonstrated that increases in 
dissolved CO2 levels to 560 ppm cause a reduction in growth 
rate and survival of shelled animals like echinoderms and 
gastropods. These findings indicate that previous atmospheric 
CO2 accumulation may already be affecting the growth of 
calcifying organisms, with the potential for large-scale changes 
in surface-ocean ecosystem structure. Due to atmospheric CO2 
accumulation, global calcification rates could decrease by 50% 
over the next century (Zondervan et al., 2001), and there could 
be significant shifts in global biogeochemical cycles. Despite 
the potential importance of biogeochemical feedback induced 
by global change, our understanding of these processes is still 
in its infancy even in surface waters (Riebesell, 2004). Much 
less can be said about potential ecosystem shifts in the deep sea 
(Omori et al., 1998).
 
Long-term effects of CO2 elevations identified in individual 
animal species affects processes in addition to calcification 
(reviewed by Ishimatsu et al., 2004, Pörtner and Reipschläger, 
1996, Pörtner et al., 2004, 2005). In these cases, CO2 entry into 
the organism as well as decreased water pH values are likely to 
have been the cause. Major effects occur through a disturbance 
in acid-base regulation of several body compartments. Falling 
pH values result and these affect many metabolic functions, 
since enzymes and ion transporters are only active over a 
narrow pH range. pH decreases from CO2 accumulation are 
counteracted over time by an accumulation of bicarbonate anions 
in the affected body compartments (Heisler, 1986; Wheatly and 
Henry, 1992, Pörtner et al., 1998; Ishimatsu et al. 2004), but 
compensation is not always complete. Acid-base relevant ion 
transfer may disturb osmoregulation due to the required uptake 
of appropriate counter ions, which leads to an additional NaCl 
load of up to 10% in marine fish in high CO2 environments 
(Evans, 1984; Ishimatsu et al., 2004). Long-term disturbances 
in ion equilibria could be involved in mortality of fish over 
long time scales despite more or less complete compensation of 
acidification.
 
Elevated CO2 levels may cause a depression of aerobic energy 
metabolism, due to incomplete compensation of the acidosis, as 
observed in several invertebrate examples (reviewed by Pörtner 
et al. 2004, 2005). In one model organism, the peanut worm 
Sipunculus nudus, high CO2 levels caused metabolic depression 
of up to 35% at 20,000 ppm pCO2. A central nervous mechanism 
also contributed, indicated by the accumulation of adenosine in 
the nervous tissue under 10,000 ppm pCO2. Adenosine caused 
metabolic depression linked to reduced ventilatory activity even 
more so when high CO2 was combined with oxygen deficiency 
(anoxia; Lutz and Nilsson, 1997). Studies addressing the specific 
role of adenosine or other neurotransmitters at lower CO2 levels 
or in marine fish during hypercapnia are not yet available.
 
The depression of metabolism observed under high CO2 
concentrations in marine invertebrates also includes inhibition 
of protein synthesis – a process that is fundamental to growth 
and reproduction. A CO2 induced reduction of water pH to 7.3 
caused a 55% reduction in growth of Mediterranean mussels 
(Michaelidis et al. 2005; for review see Pörtner et al. 2004, 
Chapter 6: Ocean storage
305
2005). Fish may also grow slowly in high CO2 waters. Reduced 
growth was observed in juvenile white sturgeon (Crocker and 
Cech, 1996). In this case, the stimulation of ventilation and the 
associated increase in oxygen consumption indicated a shift 
in energy budget towards maintenance metabolism, which 
occurred at the expense of growth. This effect was associated 
with reductions in foraging activity. A harmful influence of CO2 
on reproductive performance was found in two species of marine 
copepods (Acartia steuri, Acartia erythrea) and sea urchins 
(Hemicentrotus purcherrimus, Echinometra mathaei). While 
survival rates of adult copepods were not affected during 8 days 
at pCO2 up to 10,000 ppm, egg production and hatching rates 
of eggs were significantly reduced concomitant to an increased 
mortality of young-stage larvae seen at water pH 7.0 (Kurihara 
et al., 2004). In both sea urchin species tested, fertilization 
rates decreased with pCO2 rising above1000 ppm (below water 
pH 7.6; Kurihara et al., 2004). Hatching and survival of fish 
larvae also declined with water pCO2 and exposure time in all 
examined species (Ishimatsu et al., 2004).
6.7.3 
From physiological mechanisms to ecosystems
CO2 effects propagate from molecules via cells and tissues 
to whole animals and ecosystems (Figure 6.26; Table 6.4). 
Organisms are affected by chemistry changes that modulate 
crucial physiological functions. The success of a species can 
depend on effects on the most sensitive stages of its life cycle 
(e.g., egg, larvae, adult). Effects on molecules, cells, and tissues 
thus integrate into whole animal effects (Pörtner et al., 2004), 
affecting growth, behaviour, reproduction, and development of 
eggs and larvae. These processes then determine the ecological 
success (fitness) of a species, which can also depend on complex 
interaction among species. Differential effects of chemistry 
changes on the various species thus affect the entire ecosystem. 
Studies of CO2 susceptibility and affected mechanisms in 
individual species (Figure 6.26) support development of a cause 
and effect understanding for an entire ecosystem’s response to 
changes in ocean chemistry, but need to be complemented by 
field studies of ecosystem consequences.

IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
 
Tolerance thresholds likely vary between species and 
phyla, but still await quantification for most organisms. Due 
to differential sensitivities among and within organisms, a 
continuum of impacts on ecosystems is more likely than the 
existence of a well-defined threshold beyond which CO2 
cannot be tolerated. Many species may be able to tolerate 
transient CO2 fluctuations, but may not be able to settle and 
thrive in areas where CO2 levels remain permanently elevated. 
At concentrations that do not cause acute mortality, limited 
tolerance may include reduced capacities of higher functions, 
that is added CO2 could reduce the capacity of growth and 
reproduction, or hamper resistance to infection (Burnett, 1997). 
It could also reduce the capacity to attack or escape predation, 
which would have consequences for the organism’s food supply 
and thus overall fitness with consequences for the rest of the 
ecosystem.
 
Complex organisms like animals proved to be more 
sensitive to changing environmental conditions like temperature 
extremes than are simpler, especially unicellular, organisms 
(Pörtner, 2002). It is not known whether animals are also more 
sensitive to extremes in CO2. CO2 affects many physiological 
mechanisms that are also affected by temperature and hypoxia 
(Figure 6.26). Challenges presented by added CO2 could 
lower long-term resistance to temperature extremes and thus 
narrow zoogeographical distribution ranges of affected species 
(Reynaud et al., 2003, Pörtner et al., 2005).
 
At the ecosystem level, few studies carried out in surface 
oceans report that species may benefit under elevated CO2 
levels. Riebesell (2004) summarized observations in surface 
ocean mesocosms under glacial (190 ppm) and increased CO2 
concentrations (790 ppm). High CO2 concentrations caused 
higher net community production of phytoplankton. Diatoms 
dominated under glacial and elevated CO2 conditions, whereas 
Emiliania huxleyi dominated under present CO2 conditions. This 
example illustrates how species that are less sensitive to added 
CO2 could become dominant in a high CO2 environment, in this 
case due to stimulation of photosynthesis in resource limited 
phytoplankton species (Riebesell 2004). These conclusions 
have limited applicability to the deep sea, where animals and 
bacteria dominate. In animals, most processes are expected to 
be depressed by high CO2 and low pH levels (Table 6.4).
6.7.4 
Biological consequences for water column release 
scenarios
Overall, extrapolation from knowledge mostly available for 
surface oceans indicates that acute CO2 effects (e.g., narcosis, 
mortality) will only occur in areas where pCO2 plumes reach 
significantly above 5000 ppm of atmospheric pressure (in 
the most sensitive squid) or above 13,000 or 40,000 ppm for 
juvenile or adult fish, respectively. Such effects are thus expected 
at CO2 increases with ∆pH < –1.0 for squid. According to the 
example presented in Figure 6.12, a towed pipe could avoid pH 
changes of this magnitude, however a fixed pipe without design 
optimization would produce a volume of several km3 with this 
pH change for an injection rate of 100 kg s–1. Depending on the 
scale of injection such immediate effects may thus be chosen 
to be confined to a small region of the ocean (Figures 6.13 and 
6.14).
 
Available knowledge of CO2 effects and underlying 
mechanisms indicate that effects on marine fauna and their 
ecosystems will likely set in during long-term exposure to pCO2 
of more than 400 to 500 ppm or associated moderate pH changes 
(by about 0.1–0.3 units), primarily in marine invertebrates 
(Pörtner et al. 2005) and, possibly, unicellular organisms. For 
injection at a rate of 0.37 GtCO2 yr–1 for 100 years (Figure 
6.14), such critical pH shifts would occur in less than 1% of 
the total ocean volume by the end of this period. However, 
table 6.4 Physiological and ecological processes affected by CO2 
(note that listed effects on phytoplankton are not relevant in the 
deep sea, but may become operative during large-scale mixing 
of CO2). Based on reviews by Heisler, 1986, Wheatly and Henry, 
1992, Claiborne et al., 2002, Langdon et al., 2003 Shirayama, 2002, 
Kurihara et al., 2004, Ishimatsu et al., 2004, 2005, Pörtner et al. 2004,

baseline pH shifts by 0.2 to 0.4 pH-units expected from the 
WRE550 stabilization scenario already reach that magnitude 
of change. Additional long-term repeated large-scale global 
injection of 10% of the CO2 originating from 18,000 GtCO2 
fossil fuel would cause an extension of these pH shifts from the 
surface ocean to significantly larger (deeper) fractions of the 
ocean by 2100 to 2300 (Figure 6.15). Finally, large-scale ocean 
disposal of all of the CO2 would lead to pH decreases of more 
than 0.3 and associated long-term effects in most of the ocean. 
Expected effects will include a reduction in the productivity of 
calcifying organisms leading to higher ratios of non-calcifiers 
over calcifiers (Pörtner et al., 2005). 
 
Reduced capacities for growth, productivity, behaviours, 
and reduced lifespan imply a reduction in population densities 
and productivities of some species, if not reduced biodiversity. 
Food chain length and composition may be reduced associated 
with reduced food availability for high trophic levels. This may 
diminish resources for local or global fisheries. The suggested 
scenarios of functional depression also include a CO2 induced 
reduction in tolerance to thermal extremes, which may go hand 
in hand with reduced distribution ranges as well as enhanced 
geographical distribution shifts. All of these expectations result 
from extrapolations of current physiological and ecological 
knowledge and require verification in experimental field studies. 
The capacity of ecosystems to compensate or adjust to such 
CO2 induced shifts is also unknown. Continued research efforts 
could identify critical mechanisms and address the potential for 
adaptation on evolutionary time scales.
6.7.5 
Biological consequences associated with CO2 lakes
Strategies that release liquid CO2 close to the sea floor will be 
affecting two ecosystems: the ecosystem living on the sea floor, 
and deep-sea ecosystem living in the overlying water. Storage 
as a topographically confined ‘CO2 lake’ would limit immediate 
large-scale effects of CO2 addition, but result in the mortality 
of most organisms under the lake that are not able to flee and 
of organisms that wander into the lake. CO2 will dissolve from 
the lake into the bottom water, and this will disperse around 
the lake, with effects similar to direct release of CO2 into the 
overlying water. According to the scenarios depicted in Figures 
6.11 and 6.12 for CO2 releases near the sea floor, pH reductions 
expected in the near field are well within the scope of those 
expected to exert significant effect on marine biota, depending 
on the length of exposure.
6.7.6 
Contaminants in CO2 streams
The injection of large quantities of CO2 into the deep ocean 
will itself be the topic of environmental concern, so the matter 
of possible small quantities of contaminants in the injected 
material is of additional but secondary concern. In general there 
are already stringent limits on contaminants in CO2 streams 
due to human population concerns, and technical pipeline 
considerations. The setting of any additional limits for ocean 
disposal cannot be addressed with any certainty at this time.
 
There are prohibitions in general against ocean disposal; 
historical concerns have generally focused on heavy metals, 
petroleum products, and toxic industrial chemicals and their 
breakdown products.
 
A common contaminant in CO2 streams is H2S. There are 
very large sources of H2S naturally occurring in the ocean: 
many marine sediments are anoxic and contain large quantities 
of sulphides; some large ocean basins (the Black Sea, the 
Cariaco Trench etc.) are anoxic and sulphidic. As a result ocean 
ecosystems that have adapted to deal with sulphide and sulphur-
oxidizing bacteria are common throughout the worlds oceans. 
Nonetheless the presence of H2S in the disposal stream would 
result in a lowering of local dissolved oxygen levels, and have 
an impact on respiration and performance of higher marine 
organisms.
6.7.7 
Risk management
There is no peer-reviewed literature directly addressing risk 
management for intentional ocean carbon storage; however, 
there have been risk management studies related to other uses 
of the ocean. Oceanic CO2 release carries no expectation of 
risk of catastrophic atmospheric degassing such as occurred at 
Lake Nyos (Box 6.7). Risks associated with transporting CO2 to 
depth are discussed in Chapter 4 (Transport).
 
It may be possible to recover liquid CO2 from a lake on 
the ocean floor. The potential reversibility of the production 
of CO2 lakes might be considered a factor that diminishes risk 
associated with this option.
6.7.8 
Social aspects; public and stakeholder perception 
The study of public perceptions and perceived acceptability of 
intentional CO2 storage in the ocean is at an early stage and 
comprises only a handful of studies (Curry et al., 2005; Gough 
et al., 2002; Itaoka et al., 2004; Palmgren et al., 2004). Issues 
crosscutting public perception of both geological and ocean 
storage are discussed in Section 5.8.5.
 
All studies addressing ocean storage published to date have 
shown that the public is largely uninformed about ocean carbon 
storage and thus holds no well-developed opinion. There is 
very little awareness among the public regarding intentional or 
unintentional ocean carbon storage. For example, Curry et al. 
(2005) found that the public was largely unaware of the role of 
the oceans in absorbing anthropogenic carbon dioxide released 
to the atmosphere. In the few relevant studies conducted thus 
far, the public has expressed more reservations regarding ocean 
carbon CO2 storage than for geological CO2 storage.
 
Education can affect the acceptance of ocean storage 
options. In a study conducted in Tokyo and Sapporo, Japan 
(Iatoka et al, 2004), when members of the public, after 
receiving some basic information, were asked to rate ocean and 
geologic storage options on a 1 to 5 scale (1 = no, 5 = yes) the 
mean rating for dilution-type ocean storage was 2.24, lake-type 
ocean storage was rated at 2.47, onshore geological storage 
was rated at 2.57, and offshore geological storage was rated at 
308
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
2.75. After receiving additional information from researchers, 
the mean rating for dilution-type and lake-type ocean storage 
increased to 2.42 and 2.72, respectively, while the mean ratings 
for onshore and offshore geologic storage increased to 2.65 and 
2.82, respectively. In a similar conducted study in Pittsburgh, 
USA, Palmgren et al. (2004) found that when asked to rate 
ocean and geologic storage on a 1 to 7 scale (1 = completely 
oppose, 7 = completely favour) respondents’ mean rating was 
about 3.2 for ocean storage and about 3.5 for geological storage. 
After receiving information selected by the researchers, the 
respondents changed their ratings to about 2.4 for ocean storage 
and 3.0 for geological storage. Thus, in the Itaoka et al. (2004) 
study the information provided by the researchers increased 
the acceptance of all options considered whereas in the Study 
of Palmgren et al. (2004) the information provided by the 
researchers decreased the acceptance of all options considered. 
The differences could be due to many causes, nevertheless, they 
suggest that the way information is provided by researchers 
could affect whether the added information increases or 
decreases the acceptability of ocean storage options.
 
Gough et al. (2002) reported results from discussions 
of carbon storage from two unrepresentative focus groups 
comprising a total of 19 people. These focus groups also 
preferred geological storage to ocean storage; this preference 
appeared to be based, ‘not primarily upon concerns for the 
deep-sea ecological environment’, but on ‘the lack of a visible 
barrier to prevent CO2 escaping’ from the oceans. Gough et al. 
(2002) notes that ‘significant opposition’ developed around a 
proposed ocean CO2 release experiment in the Pacific Ocean 
(see Section 6.2.1.2).
6.8 Legal issues 
6.8.1 
International law
Please refer to Sections 5.8.1.1 (Sources and nature of 
international obligations) and 5.8.1.2 (Key issues in the 
application of the treaties to CO2 storage) for the general 
position of both geological and ocean storage of CO2 under 
international law. It is necessary to look at and interpret the 
primary sources, the treaty provisions themselves, to determine 
the permissibility or otherwise of ocean storage. Some secondary 
sources, principally the 2004 OSPAR Jurists Linguists’ paper 
containing the States Parties’ interpretation of the Convention 
(considered in detail in Section 5.8.1.3) and conference papers 
prepared for the IEA workshop in 1996, contain their authors’ 
individual interpretations of the treaties. 
 
McCullagh (1996) considered the international legal control 
of ocean storage, and found that, whilst the UN Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) encourages the use 
of the oceans as a reservoir for CO2, the UN Convention on the 
Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) is ambiguous in its application to 
ocean storage. Whilst ocean storage will reduce CO2 emissions 
and combat climate change, to constitute an active use of sinks 
and reservoirs as required by the UNFCCC, ocean storage 
would need to be the most cost-effective mitigation option. 
As for UNCLOS, it is unclear whether ocean storage will be 
allowable in all areas of the ocean, but provisions on protecting 
and preserving the marine environment will be applicable if CO2 
is deemed to be ‘pollution’ under the Convention (which will be 
so, as the large quantity of CO2 introduced is likely to cause 
harm to living marine resources). In fulfilling their obligation to 
prevent, reduce and control pollution of the marine environment, 
states must act so as not to transfer damage or hazards from one 
area to another or transform one type of pollution into another, 
About 2 million tonnes of CO2 gas produced by volcanic activity were released in one night in 1986 by Lake Nyos, Cameroon, 
causing the death of at least 1700 people (Kling et al., 1994). Could CO2 released in the deep sea produce similar catastrophic 
release at the ocean surface?
  
Such a catastrophic degassing involves the conversion of dissolved CO2 into the gas phase. In the gas phase, CO2 is 
buoyant and rises rapidly, entraining the surrounding water into the rising plume. As the water rises, CO2 bubbles form more 
readily. These processes can result in the rapid release of CO2 that has accumulated in the lake over a prolonged period of 
magmatic activity.
  
Bubbles of CO2 gas can only form in sea water shallower than about 500 m when the partial pressure of CO2 in sea water 
exceeds the ambient total pressure. Most release schemes envision CO2 release deeper than this. CO2 released below 3000 m 
would tend to sink and then dissolve into the surrounding seawater. CO2 droplets released more shallowly generally dissolve 
within a few 100 vertical metres of release.
  
The resulting waters are too dilute in CO2 to produce partial CO2 pressures exceeding total ambient pressure, thus CO2 
bubbles would not form. Nevertheless, if somehow large volumes of liquid CO2 were suddenly transported above the liquid-
gas phase boundary, there is a possibility of a self-accelerating regime of fluid motion that could lead to rapid degassing at 
the surface. The disaster at Lake Nyos was exacerbated because the volcanic crater confined the CO2 released by the lake; the 
open ocean surface does not provide such topographic confinement. Thus, there is no known mechanism that could produce an 
unstable volume of water containing 2 MtCO2 at depths shallower than 500 m, and thus no mechanism known by which ocean 
carbon storage could produce a disaster like that at Lake Nyos.
Box 6.7 Lake Nyos and deep-sea carbon dioxide storage.
Chapter 6: Ocean storage

a requirement that could be relied upon by proponents and 
opponents alike.
 
Churchill (1996) also focuses on UNCLOS in his assessment 
of the international legal issues, and finds that the consent of 
the coastal state would be required if ocean storage occurred 
in that state’s territorial sea (up to12 miles from the coast). In 
that state’s Exclusive Economic Zone (up to 200 miles), the 
storage of CO2 via a vessel or platform (assuming it constituted 
‘dumping’ under the Convention) would again require the 
consent of that state. Its discretion is limited by its obligation 
to have due regard to the rights and duties of other states in the 
Exclusive Economic Zone under the Convention, by other treaty 
obligations (London and OSPAR) and the Convention’s general 
duty on parties not to cause damage by pollution to other states’ 
territories or areas beyond their national jurisdiction. He finds 
that it is uncertain whether the definition of ‘dumping’ would 
apply to use of a pipeline system from land for ocean storage, 
but, in any event, concludes that the discharge of CO2 from a 
pipeline will, in many circumstances, constitute pollution and 
thus require the coastal state to prevent, reduce and control 
such pollution from land-based sources. But ocean storage by 
a pipeline from land into the Exclusive Economic Zone will 
not fall within the rights of a coastal or any other state and any 
conflict between them will be resolved on the basis of equity 
and in the light of all the relevant circumstances, taking into 
account the respective importance of the interests involved to 
the parties as well as to the international community as a whole. 
He finds that coastal states do have the power to regulate and 
control research in their Exclusive Economic Zones, although 
such consent is not normally withheld except in some cases.
 
As for the permissibility of discharge of CO2 into the high 
seas (the area beyond the Exclusive Economic Zone open to all 
states), Churchill (1996) concludes that this will depend upon 
whether the activity is a freedom of the high sea and is thus 
not prohibited under international law, and finds that the other 
marine treaties will be relevant in this regard.
 
Finally, the London Convention is considered by Campbell 
(1996), who focuses particularly on the ‘industrial waste’ 
definition contained in Annex I list of prohibited substances, 
but does not provide an opinion upon whether CO2 is covered 
by that definition ‘waste materials generated by manufacturing 
or processing operations’, or indeed the so-called reverse list 
exceptions to this prohibition, or to the general prohibition 
under the 1996 Protocol.
6.8.2 
National laws 
6.8.2.1 
Introduction
CO2 ocean storage, excluding injection from vessels, platforms 
or other human-made structures into the subseabed to which the 
Assessment made in Section 5.8 applies, is categorized into the 
following two types according to the source of injection of the 
CO2 (land or sea) and its destination (sea): (1) injection from 
land (via pipe) into the seawater; (2) injection from vessels, 
platforms or other human-made structures into sea water (water 
column, ocean floor).
 
States are obliged to comply with the provisions of 
international law mentioned above in Section 6.8.1, in particular 
treaty law to which they are parties. States have to implement 
their international obligations regarding CO2 ocean storage 
either by enacting relevant national laws or revising existing 
ones. There have been a few commentaries and papers on the 
assessment of the legal position of ocean storage at national 
level. However, the number of countries covered has been quite 
limited. Summaries of the assessment of the national legal 
issues having regard to each type of storage mentioned above to 
be considered when implementing either experimental or fully-
fledged ocean storage of CO2 are provided below.
 
With regard to the United States, insofar as CO2 from a 
fossil-fuel power plant is considered industrial waste, it would 
be proscribed under the Ocean Dumping Ban Act of 1988. 
The Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 
(codified as 33 U.S.C. 1401–1445, 16 U.S.C. 1431–1447f, 33 
U.S.C. 2801–2805), including the amendments known as the 
Ocean Dumping Ban Act of 1988, has the aim of regulating 
intentional ocean disposal of materials, while authorizing 
related research. The Ocean Dumping Ban Act of 1988 placed 
a ban on ocean disposal of sewage sludge and industrial wastes 
after 31 December 1991.
 
The US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) 
specified protective criteria for marine waters, which held pH 
to a value between 6.5 and 8.5, with a limit on overall excursion 
of no more than 0.2 pH units outside the naturally occurring 
range (see: Train, 1979). Much of the early work on marine 
organisms reflected concerns about the dumping of industrial 
acid wastes (e.g., acid iron wastes from TiO2 manufacture) into 
marine waters. For the most part, however, these studies failed 
to differentiate between true pH effects and the effects due to 
CO2 liberated by the introduction of acid into the test systems.
6.8.2.2 
Injection from land (via pipe) into seawater
States can regulate the activity of injection within their 
jurisdiction in accordance with their own national rules and 
regulations. Such rules and regulations would be provided by, 
if any, the laws relating to the treatment of high-pressure gases, 
labour health and safety, control of water pollution, dumping at 
sea, waste disposal, biological diversity, environmental impact 
assessment etc. It is, therefore, necessary to check whether 
planned activities of injection fall under the control of relevant 
existing rules and regulations.
6.8.2.3 
Injection from vessels, platforms or other humanmade 
structures into sea water (water column, ocean floor)
It is necessary to check whether the ocean storage of CO2 is 
interpreted as ‘dumping’ of ‘industrial waste’ by relevant 
national laws, such as those on dumping at sea or waste 
disposal, because this could determine the applicability of the 
London Convention and London Protocol (see Section 6.8.1). 
Even if ocean storage is not prohibited, it is also necessary to 
check whether planned activities will comply with the existing 
relevant classes of rules and regulations, if any, mentioned 
above.

Costs
6.9.1 
Introduction
Studies on the engineering cost of ocean CO2 storage have been 
published for cases where CO2 is transported from a power 
plant located at the shore by either ship to an offshore injection 
platform or injection ship (Section 6.9.2), or pipeline running 
on the sea floor to an injection nozzle (Section 6.9.3). Costs 
considered in this section include those specific to ocean storage 
described below and include the costs of handling of CO2 and 
transport of CO2 offshore, but not costs of onshore transport 
(Chapter 4).
6.9.2 
Dispersion from ocean platform or moving ship 
Costs have been estimated for ship transport of CO2 to an 
injection platform, with CO2 injection from a vertical pipe 
into mid- to deep ocean water, or a ship trailing an injection 
pipe (Akai et al., 2004; IEA-GHG, 1999; Ozaki, 1997; Akai 
et al., 1995; Ozaki et al., 1995). In these cases, the tanker ship 
transports liquid CO2 at low temperature (–55 to –50ºC) and 
high pressure (0.6 to 0.7 MPa).
 
Table 6.5 shows storage costs for cases (Akai et al., 2004) 
of ocean storage using an injection platform. In these cases, 
CO2 captured from three power plants is transported by a CO2 
tanker ship to a single floating discharge platform for injection 
at a depth of 3000 m. The cost of ocean storage is the sum of 
three major components: tank storage of CO2 onshore awaiting 
shipping; shipping of CO2; and the injection platform pipe and 
nozzle. The sum of these three components is 11.5 to 12.8 US$/
tCO2 shipped 100 to 500 km. Assuming an emission equal to 
3% of shipped CO2 from boil-off and fuel consumption, the 
estimated cost is 11.9 to 13.2 US$/tCO2 net stored.
 
Liquid CO2 could be delivered by a CO2 transport ship to 
the injection area and then transferred to a CO2 injection ship, 
which would tow a pipe injecting the CO2 into the ocean at 
a depth of 2,000 to 2,500 m. Estimated cost of ocean storage 
(Table 6.6) is again the sum of three major components: tank 
storage of CO2 onshore awaiting shipping; shipping of CO2; and 
the injection ship, pipe and nozzle (Table 6.6; Akai et al., 2004). 
The sum of these three components is 13.8 to 15.2 US$/tCO2 
shipped 100 to 500 km. Assuming an emission equal to 3% of 
shipped CO2 from boil-off and fuel consumption, the estimated 
cost is 14.2 to 15.7 US$/tCO2 net stored.
6.9.3 
Dispersion by pipeline extending from shore into 
shallow to deep water
Compared with the ship transport option (6.9.2), pipeline 
transport of CO2 is estimated to cost less for transport over 
shorter distances (e.g., 100 km) and more for longer distances 
(e.g., 500 km), since the cost of ocean storage via pipeline 
scales with pipeline length.
 
The cost for transporting CO2 from a power plant located 
at the shore through a pipeline running on the sea floor to an 
injection nozzle has been estimated by IEA-GHG (1994) and 
Akai et al. (2004). In the recent estimate of Akai et al. (2004), 
CO2 captured from a pulverized coal fired power plant with a 
net generation capacity of 600 MWe is transported either 100 or 
500 km by a CO2 pipeline for injection at a depth of 3000 m at 
a cost of 6.2 US$/tCO2 net stored (100 km case) to 31.1 US$/
tCO2 net stored (500 km case).
 
There are no published cost estimates specific to the 
production of a CO2 lake on the sea floor; however, it might 
be reasonable to assume that there is no significant difference 
between the cost of CO2 lake production and the cost of water 
column injection given this dominance of pipeline costs.

6.9.4 
Cost of carbonate neutralization approach
Large-scale deployment of carbonate neutralization would 
require a substantial infrastructure to mine, transport, crush, 
and dissolve these minerals, as well as substantial pumping of 
seawater, presenting advantages for coastal power plants near 
carbonate mineral sources.
 
There are many trade-offs to be analyzed in the design of 
an economically optimal carbonate-neutralization reactor along 
the lines of that described by Rau and Caldeira (1999). Factors 
to be considered in reactor design include water flow rate, gas 
flow rate, particle size, pressure, temperature, hydrodynamic 
conditions, purity of reactants, gas-water contact area, etc. 
Consideration of these factors has led to preliminary cost 
estimates for this concept, including capture, transport, and 
energy penalties, of 10 to 110 US$/tCO2 net stored (Rau and 
Caldeira, 1999).
6.9.5 
Cost of monitoring and verification
The cost of a monitoring and verification program could involve 
deploying and maintaining a large array of sensors in the ocean. 
Technology exists to conduct such monitoring, but a significant 
fraction of the instrument development and production is 
limited to research level activities. No estimate of costs for 
near-field monitoring for ocean storage have been published, 
but the costs of limited near-field monitoring would be small 
compared to the costs of ocean storage in cases of the scale 
considered in 6.9.2 and 6.9.3. Far field monitoring can benefit 
from international research programs that are developing global 
monitoring networks.
6.10  
Gaps in knowledge
The science and technology of ocean carbon storage could 
move forward by addressing the following major gaps:
-  Biology and ecology: Studies of the response of biological 
systems in the deep sea to added CO2, including studies that 
are longer in duration and larger in scale than yet performed.
-  Research facilities: Research facilities where ocean storage 
concepts (e.g., release of CO2 from a fixed pipe or ship, or 
carbonate-neutralization approaches) can be applied and their 
effectiveness and impacts assessed in situ at small-scale on a 
continuing basis for the purposes of both scientific research 
and technology development.
-  Engineering: Investigation and development of technology for 
working in the deep sea, and the development of pipes, nozzles, 
diffusers, etc., which can be deployed in the deep sea with 
assured flow and be operated and maintained cost-effectively.
-  Monitoring: Development of techniques and sensors to 
detect CO2 plumes and their biological and geochemical 
consequences.

Chapter 7: Mineral carbonation and industrial uses of carbon dioxide
321
ExECutivE SuMMARy
This Chapter describes two rather different options for carbon 
dioxide�(CO2)�storage:�(i)�the�fixation�of�CO2 in the form of 
inorganic carbonates, also known as ‘mineral carbonation’ or 
‘mineral sequestration’, and (ii) the industrial utilization of 
CO2�as�a�technical�fluid�or�as�feedstock�for�carbon�containing�
chemicals.
 
In the case of mineral carbonation (see Section 7.2), captured 
CO2�is�reacted�with�metal-oxide�bearing�materials,�thus�forming�
the corresponding carbonates and a solid byproduct, silica for 
example.� Natural� silicate� minerals� can� be� used� in� artificial�
processes that mimic natural weathering phenomena, but also 
alkaline industrial wastes can be considered. The products of 
mineral carbonation are naturally occurring stable solids that 
would provide storage capacity on a geological time scale. 
Moreover,�magnesium�and�calcium�silicate�deposits�are�sufficient�
to�fix�the�CO2 that could be produced from the combustion of all 
fossil�fuels�resources.�To�fix�a�tonne�of�CO2 requires about 1.6 to 
3.7�tonnes�of�rock.�From�a�thermodynamic�viewpoint,�inorganic�
carbonates�represent�a�lower�energy�state�than�CO2; hence the 
carbonation�reaction�is�exothermic�and�can�theoretically�yield�
energy. However, the kinetics of natural mineral carbonation is 
slow; hence all currently implemented processes require energy 
intensive preparation of the solid reactants to achieve affordable 
conversion rates and/or additives that must be regenerated  
 
 
and� recycled� using� external� energy� sources.� The� resulting�
carbonated solids must be stored at an environmentally suitable 
location. The technology is still in the development stage and 
is not yet ready for implementation. The best case studied so 
far is the wet carbonation of the natural silicate olivine, which 
costs�between�50�and�100�US$/tCO2 stored and translates into 
a�30-50%�energy�penalty�on�the�original�power�plant.�When�
accounting�for�the�10-40%�energy�penalty�in�the�capture�plant�
as well, a full CCS system with mineral carbonation would 
need�60-180%�more�energy�than�a�power�plant�with�equivalent�
output without CCS.
�
The�industrial�use�of�CO2�(see�Section�7.3)�as�a�gas�or�a�
liquid or as feedstock for the production of chemicals could 
contribute�to�keeping�captured�CO2 out of the atmosphere by 
storing it in anthropogenic carbon products. Industrial uses 
provide a carbon sink, as long as the pool size keeps growing 
and the lifetime of the compounds produced is long. Neither 
prerequisite� is� fulfilled� in� practice,� since� the� scale� of� CO2 
utilization�is�small�compared�to�anthropogenic�CO2 emissions, 
and the lifetime of the chemicals produced is too short with 
respect�to�the�scale�of�interest�in�CO2 storage. Therefore, the 
contribution�of�industrial�uses�of�captured�CO2 to the mitigation 
of�climate�change�is�expected�to�be�small.

IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
7.1 
 introduction
This�chapter�deals�with:�(i)�the�fixation�of�CO2 in the form of 
inorganic carbonates, also known as ‘mineral carbonation’ or 
‘mineral sequestration’ that is discussed in Section 7.2, and (ii) 
the�industrial�uses�of�CO2�as�a�technical�fluid�or�as�feedstock�for�
carbon containing chemicals, which is the subject of Section 
7.3.
7.2 
 Mineral carbonation
7.2.1�
Definitions,�system�boundaries�and�motivation
Mineral�carbonation�is�based�on�the�reaction�of�CO2 with metal 
oxide� bearing� materials� to� form� insoluble� carbonates,� with�
calcium and magnesium being the most attractive metals. In 
nature such a reaction is called silicate weathering and takes 
place on a geological time scale. It involves naturally occurring 
silicates as the source of alkaline and alkaline-earth metals and 
consumes�atmospheric�CO2. This chapter deals, however, with 
so-called�mineral�carbonation,�where�high�concentration�CO2 
from�a�capture�step�(see�Chapter�3)�is�brought�into�contact�with�
metal�oxide�bearing�materials�with�the�purpose�of�fixing�the�
CO2�as�carbonates�(Seifritz,�1990;�Dunsmore,�1992;�Lackner�
et al.,�1995).�Suitable�materials�may�be�abundant�silicate�rocks,�
serpentine�and�olivine�minerals�for�example,�or�on�a�smaller-
scale alkaline industrial residues, such as slag from steel 
production�or�fly�ash.�In�the�case�of�silicate�rocks,�carbonation�
can be carried out either ex-situ in a chemical processing plant 
after mining and pretreating the silicates, or in-situ, by injecting 
CO2 in silicate-rich geological formations or in alkaline aquifers. 
Industrial residues on the other hand can be carbonated in the 
same plant where they are produced. It is worth noting that 
products of in-situ mineral carbonation and geological storage 
may�be�similar�for�the�fraction�of�the�CO2 injected for geological 
storage that reacts with the alkaline or alkaline-earth metals in 
the cap rock leading to ‘mineral trapping’ (see Chapter 5.2.2).
 
In terms of material and energy balances, mineral carbonation 
can be schematized as illustrated in Figure 7.1, which applies 
to� a� power� plant� with� CO2 capture and subsequent storage 
through�mineral�carbonation.�With�respect�to�the�same�scheme�
for a power plant with capture and either geological or ocean 
storage�(see�Figure�1.4)�two�differences�can�be�observed.�First,�
there�is�an�additional�material�flux�corresponding�to�the�metal�
oxide� bearing� materials;� this� is� present� as� input� and� also� as�
output, in the form of carbonates, silica, non-reacted minerals 
and for some input minerals product water. Secondly, for the 
same usable energy output, the relative amounts of fossil fuels 
as input and of energy rejected as lower grade heat are different. 
In-situ carbonation is an operation similar to geological storage, 
while ex-situ carbonation involves processing steps requiring 
additional� energy� input� that� are� difficult� to� compensate� for�
with the energy released by the carbonation reaction. Given 
the similarities of in-situ carbonation with geological storage, 
this chapter will focus on ex-situ mineral� carbonation.� With�
present technology there is always a net demand for high grade 
energy to drive the mineral carbonation process that is needed 
for: (i) the preparation of the solid reactants, including mining, 
transport, grinding and activation when necessary; (ii) the 
processing, including the equivalent energy associated with the 
use, recycling and possible losses of additives and catalysts; 
(iii) the disposal of carbonates and byproducts. The relative 
importance of the three items differs depending on the source of 
the�metal�oxides,�for�example�whether�they�are�natural�silicates�
or industrial wastes.
 
Despite this potential energy penalty, interest in mineral 
carbonation stems from two features that make it unique among 
the different storage approaches, namely the abundance of metal 
oxide�bearing�materials,�particularly�of�natural�silicates,�and�the�
permanence�of�storage�of�CO2 in a stable solid form. However, 
Figure 7.1 Material� and� energy� balances� through� the� system� boundaries� for� a� power� plant� with� CO2 capture and storage through mineral 
carbonation.�The�fossil�fuel�input�provides�energy�both�to�the�power�plant�that�produces�CO2 and to the mineralization process (either directly or 
indirectly�via�the�power�plant).�The�‘other�materials’�input�serves�all�processes�within�the�system�boundaries�and�includes�the�metal�oxide�bearing�
materials for mineralization. The ‘other emissions’ output is made up of the byproducts of the mineralization reaction - silica and possibly water 
- as well as of non-reacted input materials.

mineral carbonation is today still an immature technology. 
Studies reported in the literature have not yet reached a level 
where a thorough assessment of the technology, potential, costs 
and impacts is possible.

where M is a divalent metal, e.g., calcium, magnesium, or iron) 
the corresponding carbonate is formed and heat is released 
according to the following chemical reaction:
MO�+�CO2 →�MCO3�+�heat�
(1)
The�amount�of�heat�depends�on�the�specific�metal�and�on�the�
material�containing�the�metal�oxide.�In�general�this�is�a�large�
fraction�(up�to�46%�in�the�case�of�calcium�oxide)�of�the�heat�
released� by� the� upstream� combustion� process� forming� CO2 
(393.8� kJ� mol–1CO2 for combustion of elemental carbon).  
In�the�case�of�a�few�natural�silicates�the�following�exothermic�
chemical reactions take place (in all cases heat values are given 
per�unit�mol�of�CO2 and standard conditions 25°C�and�0.1�MPa,�
Robie et al.�1978):
Olivine:
Mg2SiO4�+�2CO2 →�2MgCO3�+�SiO2
�
+�89�kJ�mol–1CO2 
(2a)
Serpentine:
Mg3Si2O5(OH)4�+�3�CO2 →�3MgCO3�+�2SiO2�+�2H2O�
�
+�64�kJ�mol–1CO2  
(2b)
Wollastonite:
CaSiO3�+�CO2 →��CaCO3�+�SiO2 +�90�kJ�mol–1CO2  
(2c)
Since the reaction releases heat, the formation of carbonates 
is thermodynamically favoured at low temperature, whereas 
at�high�temperature�(above�900°C�for�calcium�carbonate�and�
above�300°C�for�magnesium�carbonate,�at�a�CO2 partial pressure 
of one bar) the reverse reaction, that is calcination, is favoured. 
The representative member of the olivine family considered in 
the�first�reaction�above�is�forsterite,�which�is�iron-free.�In�nature�
most�olivines�contain�some�iron�that�can�form�iron�oxides�or�
siderite�(FeCO3).
�
Even�at�the�low�partial�pressure�of�atmospheric�CO2 and 
at� ambient� temperature,� carbonation� of� metal� oxide� bearing�
minerals occurs spontaneously, though on geological time scales 
(Robie et al.,� 1978;� Lasaga� and� Berner,� 1998).� Limitations�

arise from the formation of silica or carbonate layers on the 
mineral surface during carbonation that tend to hinder further 
reaction and to limit conversion (Butt et al.,�1996)�and�from�the�
rate�of�CO2 uptake from the gas phase in the case of aqueous 
reactions.�The�challenge�for�mineral�carbonation�is�to�find�ways�
to� accelerate� carbonation� and� to� exploit� the� heat� of� reaction�
within�the�environmental�constraints,�for�example�with�minimal�
energy and material losses.
7.2.3�
Sources�of�metal�oxides
Most processes under consideration for mineral carbonation 
focus�on�metal�oxide�bearing�material�that�contains�alkaline-earth�
metals (such as calcium and magnesium) as opposed to alkali 
metals (such as sodium and potassium) whose corresponding 
carbonates�are�very�soluble�in�water.�Oxides�and�hydroxides�of�
calcium and magnesium would be the ideal source materials, but 
because�of�their�reactivity�they�are�also�extremely�rare�in�nature.�
Therefore,�suitable�metal�oxide�bearing�minerals�may�be�silicate�
rocks or alkaline industrial residues, the former being abundant 
but�generally�difficult�to�access�and�the�latter�scarcer�but�easily�
available.
�
Among�silicate�rocks,�mafic�and�ultramafic�rocks�are�rocks�
that contain high amounts of magnesium, calcium and iron and 
have a low content of sodium and potassium. Some of their main 
mineral�constituents�are�olivines,�serpentine,�enstatite�(MgSiO3), 
talc (Mg3Si4O10(OH)2) and wollastonite. Although molar 
abundances of magnesium and calcium silicates in the Earth’s 
crust�are�similar,�rocks�containing�magnesium�silicate�exhibit�a�
higher�MgO�concentration�(up�to�50%�by�weight,�corresponding�
to�a�theoretical�CO2�storage�capacity�of�0.55�kg�CO2/kg rock), 
than�rocks�containing�calcium�silicates,�for�example�basalts,�that�
have�CaO�content�of�about�10%�by�weight�only�(with�a�theoretical�
CO2�storage�capacity�of�0.08�kg�CO2/kg rock) (Goff and Lackner, 
1998).�Deposits�of�wollastonite,�the�most�calcium-rich�silicate,�
are much rarer than those of magnesium-rich silicates.
 
Serpentine and olivine are mainly found in ophiolite belts 
– geological zones where colliding continental plates lead to 
an�uplifting�of�the�earth’s�crust�(Coleman�1977).�For�example,�
considering�ultramafic�deposits�containing�serpentine�and�olivine�
in�the�Eastern�United�States�and�in�Puerto�Rico,�it�was�found�
that they have RCO2�values�between�1.97�and�2.51,�depending�on�
purity and type (the RCO2 is the ratio of the mass of mineral needed 
to�the�mass�of�CO2�fixed�when�assuming�complete�conversion�
of the mineral upon carbonation, that is the reciprocal of the 
theoretical�CO2�storage�capacity�introduced�above).�Peridotites�
and�serpentinites�exceed�the�total�Mg�requirement�to�neutralize�
the�CO2�from�all�worldwide�coal�resources�estimated�at�10,000�
Gt (Lackner et al.,� 1995).� Specific� ore� deposits� identified� in�
two�studies�in�the�USA�and�Puerto�Rico�add�to�approximately�
300GtCO2� (Goff� and� Lackner,� 1998;� Goff� et al.,� 2000).� 
This� should� be� compared� to� CO2 emissions of about  
5.5�
GtCO2 
in 
the 
United 
States 
and 
about  
24� GtCO2/yr-1 worldwide. No comprehensive mapping of the 
worldwide storage potential in ophiolite belts has been reported. 
However,� their� total� surface� exposure� is� estimated� to� be� of�
the�order�of�1000�km�by�100�km�(Goff�et al.,�2000).�It�is�well�
known however that magnesium silicate reserves are present in 
all continents, but since they tend to follow present or ancient 
continental boundaries, they are not present in all countries. The 
feasibility of their use for ex-situ or in-situ mineral carbonation is 
yet�to�be�established�(Brownlow,�1979;�Newall�et al.,�2000).
�
On� a� smaller-scale,� industrial� wastes� and� mining� tailings�
provide sources of alkalinity that are readily available and 
reactive. Even though their total amounts are too small to 
substantially�reduce�CO2 emissions, they could help introduce the 
technology.�Waste�streams�of�calcium�silicate�materials�that�have�
been considered for mineral carbonation include pulverized fuel 
ash�from�coal�fired�power�plants�(with�a�calcium�oxide�content�
up�to�65%�by�weight),�bottom�ash�(about�20%�by�weight�CaO)�
and�fly�ash�(about�35%�by�weight�CaO)�from�municipal�solid�
waste incinerators, de-inking ash from paper recycling (about 
35%�by�weight�CaO),�stainless�steel�slag�(about�65%�by�weight�
CaO�and�MgO)�and�waste�cement�(Johnson,�2000;�Fernández�
Bertos et al.,�2004;�Iizuka�et al.,�2004).
7.2.4�
Processing
7.2.4.1 
Mining and mine reclamation
Mining serpentine would not differ substantially from 
conventional mining of other minerals with similar properties, 
for�example�copper�ores.�Serpentine�and�olivine�are�both�mined�
already, although rarely on the scale envisioned here (Goff and 
Lackner,�1998;�Goff�et al.,�2000).�Like�in�other�mining�operations,�
disposal of tailings and mine reclamation are important issues to 
consider. Tailing disposal depends on the material characteristics 
– particle size and cohesion, moisture content and chemical 
stability against natural leaching processes – and these depend 
in�turn�on�the�specific�process.�It�is�likely�that�carbonation�plants�
will�be�located�near�the�metal�oxide�bearing�material,�either�the�
factory producing the residues to be treated or the silicate mine, 
to avoid transport of solid materials (see Figure 7.2).
 
Economies of scale applying to today’s mining technology 
suggest� a� minimum� mining� operation� of� 50,000� to� 100,000�
tonnes day–1�(Hartman,�1992),�which�translates�into�a�minimum�
mineable�volume�of�about�0.3�km3�for�a�mine�with�a�30�year�life.�
This is a rather small size for ophiolite ore bodies, which are 
often kilometres wide and hundreds of meters thick (Goff and 
Lackner,�1998;�Goff�et al.,�2000;�Newall�et al., 2000).�Since�coal,�
in contrast to ophiolite bodies, occurs in thin seams and is buried 
under substantial overburden, it has been argued that a typical 
above ground coal mine must move more material (Lackner 
et al.,�1995)�and�disturb�a�far�larger�area�(Ziock�and�Lackner,�
2000)� for� the� same� amount� of� carbon� atoms� treated� than� the�
equivalent�ophiolite�mine,�assuming�maximum�conversion�of�the�
mineral�to�carbonate�(one�carbon�atom�yields�one�CO2 molecule 
upon� combustion,� which� has� to� be� fixed� in� one� molecule� of�
carbonate).
 
Serpentine can take many different forms, from decorative 
stones�to�chrysotile�asbestos�(O’Hanley,�1996).�The�possibility�
of�encountering�asbestos�requires�adequate�precautions.�With�
current best practice it would reportedly not be an obstacle 
Chapter 7: Mineral carbonation and industrial uses of carbon dioxide
325
(Newall� et� al.,� 2000).� Moreover,� since� the� asbestos� form� of�
serpentine�is�the�most�reactive,�reaction�products�are�expected�
to�be�asbestos�free�(O’Connor�et�al.,�2000).�Mineral�carbonation�
could therefore remediate large natural asbestos hazards that 
occur� in� certain� areas,� in� California� for� example� (Nichols,�
2000).
7.2.4.2 
Mineral pretreatment
Mineral� pretreatment,� excluding� the� chemical� processing�
steps, involves crushing, grinding and milling, as well as some 
mechanical� separation,� for� example� magnetic� extraction� of�
magnetite (Fe3O4).
7.2.4.3 
CO2 pre-processing
Mineral�carbonation�requires�little�CO2�pre-processing.�If�CO2 
is pipelined to the disposal site, the constraints on pipeline 
operations�are�likely�to�exceed�pre-processing�needs�for�mineral�
carbonation.�The� current� state� of� research� suggests� that� CO2 
should be used at a pressure similar to the pipeline pressure, 
thus� requiring� minimal� or� no� compression� (Lackner,� 2002;�
O’Connor� et al.,� 2002).� Purity� demands� in� carbonation� are�
minimal;�acidic�components�of�the�flue�gas�could�pass�through�
the same process as they would also be neutralized by the base 
and could probably be disposed of in a similar manner. Most 
carbonation�processes�would�preheat�CO2, typically to between 
100°C�and�150°C for aqueous processes, whereas in gas-solid 
reactions�temperatures�could�reach�300°C�to�500°C (Butt et al., 
1996).
7.2.4.4 
Carbonation reaction engineering
The simplest approach to mineral carbonation would be 
the� reaction� of� gaseous� CO2� with� particulate� metal� oxide�
bearing material at suitable temperature and pressure levels. 
Unfortunately, such direct gas-solid reactions are too slow to 
be practical in the case of the materials mentioned in Section 
7.2.3�(Newall�et al.,�2000)�and�are�only�feasible�at�reasonable�
pressures�for�refined,�rare�materials�like�the�oxides�or�hydroxides�
of calcium and magnesium (Butt and Lackner, 1997;�Bearat�et 
al., 2002;�Zevenhoven�and�Kavaliauskaite,�2004).�As�a�result,�
mineral�carbonation�without�refined�materials�cannot�directly�
capture�CO2�from�flue�gases,�but�could�possibly�in�the�case�of�
pressurized�CO2 rich gases from IGCC plants.
�
Since�the�direct�fixation�of�carbon�dioxide�on�solid�unrefined�
material particles seems at present not feasible, the alternative 
requires�the�extraction�of�the�metal�from�the�solid.�This�can�be�
accomplished by suspending the solid material in an aqueous 
solution and by letting it dissolve and release metal ions, for 
example�calcium�or�magnesium�ions.�These�ions�come�in�contact�
with carbonic acid (H2CO3) that is formed in the same solution 
upon�carbon�dioxide�dissolution.�Conditions�can�be�achieved�
where the carbonate and the byproducts – silica in the case of 
silicate� carbonation� for� example� –� precipitate.� This� involves�
proper choice of the operating parameters of this single-step or 
multi-step process – particularly temperature, concentration of 
possible�additives�and�CO2 pressure (that controls the carbonic 
acid concentration in solution). At the end of the operation a 
suspension�of�fine�particles�of�carbonate,�byproducts�and�non-
reacted solid materials remains. These have to be separated 
by�filtration�and�drying�from�the�solution�from�which�residual�
metal ions and additives are to be quantitatively recovered.
 
This wet process scheme is currently in the research phase 
and has to overcome three major hurdles to become cost-
effective and to be considered as a viable option for carbon 
storage: (i) acceleration of the overall rate of the process, 
which may be limited by the dissolution rate of the metal 
oxide� bearing� material;� (ii)� elimination� of� the� interference�
between�the�concomitant�metal�oxide�dissolution�and�carbonate�
precipitation; (iii) complete recovery of all the chemical species 
involved, if additives are used.
 
Mineral carbonation starting from natural silicates is a 
slow process that can be kinetically enhanced by raising the 
temperature, although thermodynamics are a limiting factor. In 
aqueous�systems,�this�is�typically�kept�below�200°C,�since�high�
temperature�favours�gaseous�CO2 over precipitated carbonates. 
It�is�believed�that�the�metal�oxide�dissolution�constitutes�the�
rate-limiting step and most research efforts have been devoted 
to�finding�ways�to�speed�up�the�metal�extraction�from�the�solid�
input materials. This could be achieved either by activating the 
mineral to make it more labile and reactive, or by enhancing 
the� metal� oxide� extraction� through� the� presence� of� additives�
or catalysts in solution. Activation can take different forms, 
namely�heat-treatment�at�650ºC�for�serpentine�(Barnes�et al., 
1950;�Drägulescu�et al., 1972;�O’Connor�et al.,�2000)�and�ultra-
fine�(attrition)�grinding�for�olivine�and�wollastonite�(O’Connor�
et al.,� 2002;� Kim� and� Chung,� 2002).� The� energy� cost� of�
activation�has�been�estimated�to�be�of�300�kWh�t–1 of mineral 
and� 70–150� kWh� t–1 of mineral for thermal and mechanical 
activation,�respectively�(O’Connor�et al.,�2005).�Carbonation�
has been successfully performed after such pretreatment, 
but�it�is�so�expensive�and�energy-intensive�that�its�feasibility�
is� questionable� (see� Box� 7.1� and� O’Connor� et al.,� 2005).�
Dissolution catalysts that can be added to the aqueous solution 
include�strong�and�weak�acids�(Pundsack,�1967;�Lackner�et al., 
1995;�Fouda�et al.,�1996;�Park�et al.,�2003;�Maroto-Valer�et 
al.,�2005),�bases�(Blencoe�et al.,�2003)�and�chelating�agents�
to�extract�SiO2�or�MgO�groups�from�the�mineral�(Park�et al., 
2003).� All� three� approaches� have� been� studied� and� at� least�
partially�experimentally�tested,�but�in�all�cases�catalyst�recovery�
represents the key hurdle. It is worth noting that the carbonation 
of�metal�oxides�from�industrial�wastes�can�be�faster�than�that�of�
natural�silicates�(Johnson,�2000;�Fernández�Bertos�et al.,�2004;�
Huijgen et al.,�2004;�Iizuka�et al.,�2004;�Stolaroff�et al.,�2005).
 
Hydrochloric acid (HCl) dissolution of serpentine or 
olivine�was�proposed�first�(Houston,�1945;�Barnes�et al.,�1950;�
Wendt et al.,�1998a).�The�process�requires�a�number�of�steps�
to� precipitate� magnesium� hydroxide� (Mg(OH)2), which can 
then� directly� react� with� gaseous� CO2, and to recover HCl. 
Exothermic�and�endothermic�steps�alternate�and�heat�recovery�
is not always possible, thus making the overall process very 
energy-intensive�and�not�viable�(Wendt�et al.,�1998a;�Newall�et 
al.,�2000;�Lackner,�2002).�Likewise,�strong�alkaline�solutions�
(with� NaOH)� will� dissolve� the� silica� from� the� magnesium�

IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
A�comprehensive�energy�and�economic�evaluation�of�the�single-step�wet�carbonation�process�has�been�reported�(O’Connor�
et�al.,�2005).�Though�limited�to�the�specific�carbonation�process�illustrated�in�Figure�7.3,�this�study�is�based�on�about�600�
experimental�tests�and�looks�not�only�at�the�fundamental�and�technical�aspects�of�the�process,�but�also�at�the�matching�of�
carbon�dioxide�sources�and�potential�sinks�that�in�this�case�are�natural�silicate�deposits.�In�particular,�seven�large�ultramafic�
ores in the USA have been considered (two olivines, four serpentines (three lizardites and one antigorite) and one wollastonite). 
Three�are�located�on�the�west�coast,�three�on�the�east�coast�and�one�in�Texas.�The�selection�of�the�seven�ores�has�also�been�based�
on�considerations�of�regional�coal�consumption�and�potential�CO2 availability.
�
The�three�different�minerals�exhibit�different�reactivity,�measured�as�the�extent�of�the�carbonation�reaction�after�one�hour�
under�specified�operating�conditions.�A�trade-off�has�been�observed�between�the�extent�of�reaction�and�mineral�pretreatment,�
thus higher reactivity is obtained for more intense pretreatment, which represents an energy cost. Mechanical activation is 
effective for the olivine and the wollastonite and involves the use of both conventional rod and ball milling techniques with 
an�energy�consumption�of�up�to�about�100�kWh�t–1�mineral�(standard�pretreatment)�and�ultra-fine�grinding�for�up�to�more�than�
200�kWh�t–1�mineral�(activated�process).�Conversion�is�no�more�than�60%�in�the�former�case�and�up�to�above�80%�in�the�latter.�
In�the�case�of�the�serpentine,�after�milling�(standard�pretreatment),�thermal�activation�at�630°C�is�effective�for�the�antigorite�
(up�to�92%�conversion)�but�only�partially�for�the�lizardite�(maximum�conversion�not�larger�than�40%)�and�requires�an�energy�
consumption�of�about�350�kWh�t–1�mineral.�Optimal�operating�conditions�for�this�wet�process�are�mineral�dependent�and�
correspond�to�185°C�and�15�MPa�for�the�olivine,�155°C�and�11.5�MPa�for�the�heat�treated�serpentine,�and�100°C�and�4�MPa�for�
the�wollastonite.�In�the�first�two�cases,�the�carbonation�reaction�takes�place�in�the�presence�of�0.64�mol�L–1 sodium bicarbonate 
and 1 mol L–1 sodium chloride.
Process�costs�have�been�calculated�for�these�seven�ores�in�the�case�of�both�standard�mineral�pretreatment�and�activated�process.�
Costs�include�only�storage,�thus�neither�CO2�capture�nor�CO2�transport�and�are�based�on�the�assumption�that�CO2 is received 
pure�at�15�MPa�at�the�plant.�Investment�costs�are�calculated�accounting�for�the�different�reactor�costs�depending�on�the�different�
operating conditions corresponding to the different mineral ores. Storage costs are calculated per tonne of silicate ore and per 
tonne�of�CO2�stored�and�are�complemented�by�the�energy�consumption�per�tonne�of�CO2 stored in the above Table. The table 
highlights�a�trade-off�between�energy�input�associated�with�the�pretreatment�procedure�and�cost�per�unit�carbon�dioxide�stored.�

silicate, thus allowing for further digestion of the remaining 
(Mg(OH)2);�however,�also�in�this�case�the�recovery�of�the�NaOH�
catalyst�seems�to�be�very�difficult�(Blencoe�et al.,�2003).�To�
overcome the substantial energy penalty of water evaporation 
in the hydrochloric acid process, it was proposed to dissolve the 
silicate minerals in a magnesium chloride melt in order either to 
precipitate�Mg(OH)2 as before or to allow for direct carbonation 
in�the�melt�(Wendt�et al.,�1998a;�1998b;�1998c;�1998d).�No�
experimental�demonstration�of�this�process�has�been�provided,�
possibly also because of the corrosive conditions of the reaction; 
energy and material balances indicate that either version of the 
process will hardly be viable (Newall et al.,�2000;�Haywood�et 
al.,�2001).
 
Weaker�acids�that�might�reduce�the�energy�requirements�for�
recovery include acetic acid (Kakizawa et al.,�2001),�oxalic�acid�
(Park�et al.,�2003),�orthophosphoric�acid�(Park�et al.,�2003)�and�
ammonium�bisulphate�(Pundsack�1967).�Among�the�possible�
chelating agents that keep either silicates or magnesium ions 
in� solution� by� forming� water-soluble� complexes,� is� EDTA�
– ethylene-diamine-tetra-acetic acid (Carey et al.,�2003;�Park�
et al.,�2003;�Park�and�Fan,�2004).�Citric�acid�is�also�effective�
because it combines its acidic properties with strong chelating 
properties (Carey et al.,�2003).�All�these�additives�have�been�
proven to enhance the dissolution of silicate minerals, but only 
in the acetic acid case has a complete process scheme, including 
acid recovery, been described and evaluated (Kakizawa et al., 
2001).� This� is� based� on� two� steps,� whereby� the� metal� ions�
are�extracted�first�using�acetic�acid�and�then�the�carbonate�is�

‘Single-step’ indicates that mineral dissolution and carbonate precipitation take place simultaneously in the same carbonation reactor, whereas 
more steps are of course needed for the whole process, including preparation of the reactants and separation of the products.

the�mineral�is�ground�first.�Subsequently�it�is�dissolved�in�an�
aqueous solution of sodium chloride (NaCl, 1 mol L–1) and 
sodium�bicarbonate�(NaHCO3,�0.64�mol�L–1) in contact with high 
pressure�CO2�and�carbonated�therein�(O’Connor�et al.,�2002;�
O’Connor�et al.,�2005).�The�additives�are�easily�recovered�upon�
filtration�of�the�solid�particles,�since�the�sodium�and�chloride�
ions do not participate in the reaction and remain in solution, 
whereas the bicarbonate ion is replenished by contacting the 
solution�in�the�carbonation�reactor�with�the�CO2 atmosphere. 
A�maximum�conversion�of�81%�in�one�hour�was�obtained�with�
an�olivine�of�37�µm�particle�size,�at�a�temperature�of�185°C�
and�a�CO2�partial�pressure�of�15�MPa.�An�important�element�of�
the�process�scheme�in�Figure�7.3�is�the�classification�(sieving)�
that allows separating the carbonate and silica products from 
the olivine that has to be recycled. This is possible since non-
reacted olivine minerals are coarse, whereas the carbonate and 
silica� consist� of� finer� particles� (O’Connor� et al.,� 2002).� An�
additional�difficulty�of�single-step�carbonation�is�when,�upon�
extraction�of�the�metal�oxide�from�the�solid�particles,�a�silica�
layer forms or a carbonate layer precipitates on the particles 
themselves,� thus� hindering� further� dissolution.� Experimental�
evidence indicates that this does not occur in the case of olivine 
(O’Connor�et al.,�2002),�whereas�it�does�occur�in�the�case�of�
steel slag (Huijgen et al.,�2004).
�
Using� the� process� scheme� illustrated� in� Figure� 7.3,� it� is�
possible to calculate the material balances by considering 
that�the�molecular�mass�of�carbon�dioxide�is�44.0�g�mol–1, of 
magnesium�carbonate�is�84.3�g�mol–1,�of�silica�is�60.1�g�mol–1 
and�of�olivine�is�140.7�g�mol–1. For the sake of simplicity only 
two assumptions are made, namely the degree of conversion 
in the carbonation reactor – the fraction of olivine fed to the 
reactor that is converted to carbonate in a single pass – and 
the�fraction�of�non-reacted�mineral�in�the�classifier�that�is�not�
recycled, but ends up with the material for disposal. Based on 
the stoichiometry of the carbonation reaction, 1.6 tonnes of 
olivine�would�be�needed�to�fix�one�tonne�of�CO2, thus producing 
2.6� tonnes� of� solid� material� for� disposal.� Assuming� 90%�
carbonation�conversion�and�10%�losses�in�the�classifier,�1.62�
tonnes of olivine would be needed and 2.62 tonnes of solids 
per�tonne�of�CO2 mineralized would be for disposal. Assuming 
only�50%�conversion�and�20%�losses,�for�one�tonne�of�CO2 
stored,�1.87�tonnes�of�olivine�would�be�needed�and�2.87�tonnes�
would be disposed of. In the latter case however the carbonation 
reactor would be twice as big as in the former case.
�
Olivine�has�the�highest�concentration�of�reactive�magnesium�
oxide� among� the� natural� minerals� (57%� by� weight).� Other�
minerals in general contain a lower concentration. For pure 
serpentine� the� magnesium� oxide� concentration� is� about� 44%�
and� for� typical� ores� about� 50%� of� that� of� the� pure� mineral.�
Therefore,�the�mineral�feedstock�required�to�fix�1�tonne�of�CO2 
in�carbonates�is�between�1.6�and�3.7�tonnes�and�the�process�
yields�between�2.6�and�4.7�tonnes�of�products�to�be�handled.�
The�carbonation�process�consumes�energy�and�thus�causes�CO2 
emissions�that�reduce�the�net�storage�of�CO2 accordingly. For 
the olivine carbonation process, having the lowest unit cost 
among�those�described�in�Box�7.1,�the�energy�requirement�is� 
1.1� GJ/tCO2. If this is provided by the same coal derived 
electricity�it�would�cause�CO2�emissions�equal�to�30%�of�the�
fixed�CO2.
7.2.5�
Product�handling�and�disposal
Disposal options for mineral carbonates are determined by the 
mass of the resulting material (see Figure 7.2). It is not cost-
effective to ship the bulk of these materials over long distances. 
As a result the obvious disposal location is at the mine site. As in 
any large-scale mining operation, the logistics of mining a site 
and�reclaiming�it�after�refilling�it�with�the�tailings�is�substantial,�
but it does not pose novel problems (Newall et al.,�2000).�The�
amount�of�material�to�be�disposed�of�is�between�50�and�100%�
by volume more than that originally mined. These volumes are 
comparable to volumes commonly handled in mining operations 
and are subject to standard mine reclamation practice (Lackner 
et al.,�1997;�Newall�et al.,�2000).
�
The� fine� grinding� of� the� mineral� ore� might� allow� for� the�
extraction� of� valuable� mineral� constituents.� Serpentine� and�
olivine mines could provide iron ore that either would be 
removed as magnetite by magnetic separation or result from 
chemical�precipitation�during�magnesium�extraction,�yielding�
concentrated� iron� oxide� or� hydroxide� (Park� and� Fan,� 2004).�
Peridotite�rocks�may�contain�chromite,�elements�like�nickel�and�
manganese and also elements in the platinum group, but how 
these can be recovered has still to be studied (Goff and Lackner, 
1998).�It�has�been�suggested,�that�magnesium�carbonate�and�
silica� may� find� uses� as� soil� enhancers,� roadfill� or� filler� for�
mining operations. Eventually mineral carbonation would have 
to operate at scales that would saturate any product or byproduct 
market, but products and byproducts, when usable, could help 
make a demonstration of the process more viable (Lackner et 
al.,�1997;�Goff�and�Lackner,�1998).
7.2.6�
Environmental�impact
The central environmental issue of mineral carbonation is 
the associated large-scale mining, ore preparation and waste-
product�disposal�(Goff�and�Lackner,�1998).�It�can�directly�lead�
to land clearing and to the potential pollution of soil, water and 
air in surrounding areas. It may also indirectly result in habitat 
degradation. An environmental impact assessment would be 
required to identify and prevent or minimize air emissions, 
solid waste disposal, wastewater discharges, water use, as well 
Chapter 7: Mineral carbonation and industrial uses of carbon dioxide
329
as social disturbances. As for many other mining activities, the 
preventing and mitigating practices are relatively basic and well 
developed.
 
Land clearing: The amount of material required to store 
CO2� involves� extensive� land� clearing� and� the� subsequent�
displacement of millions of tonnes of earth, rock and soil, 
increasing the potential for erosion, sedimentation and habitat 
loss in the area. Access roads would also lead to clearing of 
vegetation and soil. Standard practices recommended to 
minimize these impacts include storage of topsoil removed for 
use�in�future�reclamation�activities,�use�of�existing�tracks�when�
constructing access roads and pipelines and use of drainage and 
sediment collection systems to catch runoff or divert surface 
water, minimizing erosion.
 
Air quality: Mining activities like blasting, drilling, earth 
moving� and� grading� can� generate� dust� and� fine� particulate�
matter that affect visibility and respiration and pollute local 
streams and vegetation. Dust prevention measures are widely 
applied at mining operations today, but if not properly 
controlled, dust can threaten human respiratory health. This is 
particularly important in serpentine mining because serpentine 
often contains chrysotile, a natural form of asbestos. Even 
though chrysotile is not as hazardous as amphibole asbestos 
(tremolite, actinolite)�(Hume�and�Rimstidt,�1992),�the�presence�
of�chrysotile�requires�covering�of�exposed�veins�and�monitoring 
of� air� quality� (Nichols,� 2000).� On� the� other� hand,� mineral�
carbonation products are asbestos free, as the reaction destroys 
chrysotile, which reacts faster than other serpentines, even 
if conversion of the starting material is not complete. This 
makes mineral carbonation a potentially effective method for 
the� remediation� of� asbestos� in� serpentine� tailing� (O’Connor�
et al.,� 2000).�The� resulting� mineral� carbonates� are� inert,� but�
large volumes of powders would also have to be controlled, for 
example�by�cementing�them�together�to�avoid�contamination�of�
soil and vegetation, as well as habitat destruction.
 
Tailings: Tailings� consist� of� finely� ground� particles,�
including ground-up ore and process byproducts. Tailings 
management systems should be designed and implemented from 
the earliest stages of the project. Usually tailings are stored in 
tailings impoundments designed to hold tailings behind earth-
fill�dams�(Newall�et al.,�2000).�Other�control�measures�depend�
on whether tailings are dry or wet, on particle size and chemical 
reactivity.
 
Leaching of metals: Although the low acidity of the resulting 
byproducts reduces the possibility of leaching, certainty about 
leaching can only be obtained by conducting tests. If necessary, 
a lining system would prevent ground water contamination. 
Leaching containment is also possible without lining where 
underlying rock has been shown to be impermeable.
 
Reclamation: To minimize water contamination, restore 
wildlife habitat and ecosystem health and improve the aesthetics 
of the landscape, a comprehensive reclamation programme has 
to be designed during the planning phase of the mining project 
and be implemented concurrently throughout operations. 
Concurrent incorporation of reclamation with the mining of the 
site reduces waste early, prevents clean-up costs and decreases 
potential liabilities. Land rehabilitation will involve the re-
shaping of landform, because the volume of tailings will be 
larger than the mined rock. The main environmental concern 
regarding reclamation is major soil movements by erosion or 
landslides. This can be controlled by adequate vegetation cover 
and by covering the soil with protective mulch, by maintaining 
moisture in the soil, or by constructing windbreaks to protect 
the�landform�from�exposure�to�high�winds.
7.2.7�
Life�Cycle�Assessment�and�costs
At the current stage of development, mineral carbonation 
consumes� additional� energy� and� produces� additional� CO2 
compared to other storage options. This is shown in Figure 
7.1�and�is�why�a�Life�Cycle�Assessment�of�the�specific�process�
routes is particularly important. The potential of mineral 
carbonation depends on the trade-off between costs associated 
with the energy consuming steps (mining, pre-processing of the 
mineral ore, its subsequent disposal and mine reclamation) and 
benefits�(the�large�potential�capacity�due�to�the�vast�availability�
of�natural�metal�oxide�bearing�silicates�and�the�permanence�of�
CO2 storage).
 
A life cycle analysis of the mining, size reduction process, 
waste disposal and site restoration calculated additional annual 
CO2�emissions�of�0.05�tCO2/tCO2 stored (Newall et al.,�2000).�
This�included�grinding�of�the�rock�to�particle�sizes�less�than�100�
microns;�a�ratio�of�2.6�tonnes�of�serpentine�per�tonne�of�CO2 was 
assumed.�The�cost�was�assessed�to�be�about�14�US$/tCO2 stored; 
the�capital�cost�being�about�20%�of�the�total.�All�cost�estimates�
were�based�on�OECD�Western�labour�costs�and�regulations.�The�
conversion�factor�from�electrical�energy�to�CO2 emissions was 
0.83�tCO2/MWh�electricity.�Costs�were�calculated�on�the�basis�
of�an�electricity�price�of�US$�0.05�kWh–1 electricity. Results 
from other studies were converted using these values (Newall 
et al.,�2000).�Other�estimates�of�these�costs�are�between�6�and�
10�US$/tCO2�stored,�with�2%�additional�emissions�(Lackner�et 
al.,�1997).
 
As far as the scale of mining and disposal is concerned 
–�about�1.6�to�3.7�tonnes�of�silicate�and�2.6�to�4.7�tonnes�of�
disposable�materials�per�tonne�of�CO2�fixed�in�carbonates,�as�
reported�in�Section�7.2.4�–�this�is�of�course�a�major�operation.�
When�considering�that�one�tonne�of�carbon�dioxide�corresponds�
to�0.27�tonnes�of�carbon�only�in�theory,�but�in�practice�to�about�
2 tonnes of raw mineral due to the overburden, it follows that 
mineral� carbonation� to� store� the� CO2 produced by burning 
coal would require the installation of a mining industry of a 
scale comparable to the coal industry itself. Such large mining 
operations�are�significant,�but�placing�them�in�the�context�of�the�
operations needed for the use of fossil fuels and geological or 
ocean storage, the volumes are comparable.
 
The energy requirements and the costs of the carbonation 
reaction�are�very�much�process�dependent�and�more�difficult�
to estimate, due to scarcity of data. The most detailed study 
has been carried out for the process where the silicates are 
dissolved in a magnesium chloride melt (Newall et al.,�2000).�
An overall cost (including the operations mentioned in the 
330
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
previous�paragraph)�of�80�US$/tCO2 stored was obtained, with 
27.5%�additional�CO2�emissions,�thus�leading�to�110�US$/tCO2 
avoided. In the case of the two-step acetic acid process, an 
overall�cost�of�27�US$/tCO2 avoided has been reported, but the 
assumptions�are�based�on�a�rather�limited�set�of�experimental�
data (Kakizawa et al.,� 2001).� A� comprehensive� energy� and�
economic evaluation of the single step wet carbonation process 
illustrated�in�Figure�7.3�has�been�recently�reported�(O’Connor�
et al.,�2005)�and�is�discussed�in�detail�in�Box�7.1.�This�study�
calculates�storage�costs�between�50�and�100�US$/tCO2
  stored, 
with� between� 30%� and� 50%� of� the� energy� produced� needed�
as input to the mineral carbonation step, i.e. a corresponding 
reduction�of�power�plant�efficiency�from�35%�for�instance�to�
25%�and�18%,�respectively.�This�implies�that�a�full�CCS�system�
with� mineral� carbonation� would� need� 60-180%� more� energy�
than a power plant with equivalent output without CCS, when 
the�10-40%�energy�penalty�in�the�capture�plant�is�accounted�
too. No similar economic evaluation is available for either dry 
mineral carbonation or carbonation using industrial residues. 
However,�it�is�worth�pointing�out�that�the�carbonation�of�toxic�
wastes may lead to stabilized materials with reduced leaching 
of heavy metals. Therefore these materials might be disposed of 
more easily or even used for applications such as in construction 
work�(see�Figure�7.2)�(Venhuis�and�Reardon,�2001;�Meima�et 
al.,�2002).
�
Once�the�carbon�has�been�stored�through�mineral�carbonation,�
there�are�virtually�no�emissions�of�CO2 due to leakage. To the 
extent�that�weathering�at�the�disposal�site�occurs�and�leaches�
out magnesium carbonate from the carbonation products, 
additional�CO2 would be bound in the transformation of solid 
magnesium carbonate to dissolved magnesium bicarbonate 
(Lackner,�2002).�It�can�therefore�be�concluded�that�the�fraction�
of�carbon�dioxide�stored�through�mineral�carbonation�that�is�
retained�after�1000�years�is�virtually�certain�to�be�100%.�As�a�
consequence, the need for monitoring the disposal sites will be 
limited in the case of mineral carbonation.
7.2.8�
Future�scope
7.2.8.1 
Public acceptance
Public�acceptance�of�mineral�carbonation�is�contingent�on�the�
broader acceptance of CCS. Acceptance might be enhanced 
by� the� fact� that� this� method� of� storage� is� highly� verifiable�
and� unquestionably� permanent.� On� the� downside,� mineral�
carbonation involves large-scale mining and associated 
environmental concerns: terrain changes, dust pollution 
exacerbated�by�potential�asbestos�contamination�and�potential�
trace element mobilization. Generally, public acceptance will 
require a demonstration that everything possible is done to 
minimize secondary impacts on the environment.
7.2.8.2 
Gap analysis
Mineral carbonation technology must reduce costs and reduce 
the energy requirements associated with mineral pretreatment 
by� exploiting� the� exothermic� nature� of� the� reaction.� Mineral�
carbonation� will� always� be� more� expensive� than� most�
applications of geological storage, but in contrast has a virtually 
unlimited permanence and minimal monitoring requirements. 
Research towards reducing costs for the application of mineral 
carbonation to both natural silicates and industrial wastes, where 
the kinetics of the reaction is believed to be more favourable, 
is ongoing. Moreover, an evaluation is needed to determine 
the fraction of the natural reserves of silicates, which greatly 
exceed�the�needs,�that�can�be�effectively�exploited�for�mineral�
carbonation. This will require thorough study, mapping the 
resources�and�matching�sources�and�sinks,�as�in�O’Connor�et al. 
(2005).�The�actual�size�of�the�resource�base�will�be�significantly�
influenced� by� the� legal� and� societal� constraints� at� a� specific�
location. Integrating power generation, mining, carbonation 
reaction, carbonates’ disposal and the associated transport of 
materials�and�energy�needs�to�be�optimized�in�a�site-specific�
manner.�A�final�important�gap�in�mineral�carbonation�is�the�lack�
of a demonstration plant.

 industrial uses of carbon dioxide and its emission 
reduction potential 
7.3.1�
Introduction
As� an� alternative� to� storing� captured� CO2 in geological 
formations (see Chapter 5), in the oceans (see Chapter 6), or in 
mineral form as carbonates (see Section 7.2), this section of the 
report�assesses�the�potential�for�reducing�net�CO2 emissions to 
the�atmosphere�by�using�CO2 either directly or as a feedstock 
in chemical processes that produce valuable carbon containing 
products.� The� utilization� of� CO2 establishes an inventory of 
stored� CO2, the so-called carbon chemical pool, primarily 
in the form of carbon-containing fuels, chemicals and other 
products� (Xiaoding� and� Moulijn,� 1996).�The� production� and�
use of these products involve a variety of different ‘life cycles’ 
(i.e., the chain of processes required to manufacture a product 
from raw materials, to use the product for its intended purpose 
and ultimately to dispose of it or to reuse it in some fashion). 
Depending�on�the�product�life-cycle,�CO2 is stored for varying 
periods of time and in varying amounts. As long as the recycled 
carbon remains in use, this carbon pool successfully stores 
carbon.�Withdrawal� from� this� pool,� by� decay� or� by� disposal�
typically re-injects this carbon into the atmospheric pool.
�
CO2 that has been captured using one of the options described 
in�Chapter�3�could�reduce�net�CO2 emissions to the atmosphere 
if used in industrial processes as a source of carbon, only if the 
following criteria are met:
1.� �The�use�of�captured�CO2 must not simply replace a source 
of� CO2 that would then be vented to the atmosphere. 
Replacement� of� CO2 derived from a lime kiln or a  
fermentation process would not lead to a net reduction in 
CO2�emissions,�while�on�the�other�hand�replacement�of�CO2 
derived from natural geological deposits, which would thus 
be�left�undisturbed,�would�lead�to�a�net�reduction�of�CO2 
emissions.�This�would�apply�to�the�majority�of�the�CO2 used 
for�enhanced�oil�recovery�in�the�USA�(see�Section�5.3.2)�
Chapter 7: Mineral carbonation and industrial uses of carbon dioxide
331
that is currently provided from natural geological deposits 
(Audus�et�Oonk,�1997).
2.� �The�compounds�produced�using�captured�CO2 must have a 
long�lifetime�before�the�CO2 is liberated by combustion or 
other degradation processes.
3.� �When�considering�the�use�of�captured�CO2 in an industrial 
process, the overall system boundary must be carefully 
defined�to�include�all�materials,�fossil�fuels,�energy�flows,�
emissions and products in the full chain of processes used to 
produce a unit of product in order to correctly determine the 
overall�(net)�CO2 avoided.
CO2�reductions�solely�due�to�energy�efficiency�improvements�
are not within the scope of this report, which is focused on 
capture� and� storage� rather� than� efficiency� improvements.�
Similarly�while�environmental�benefits�like�those�obtained�in�
replacing�organic�solvents�with�supercritical�CO2 may slightly 
increase the carbon chemical pool, these primary drivers are 
not�discussed�in�this�report.�Similarly,�this�report�specifically�
excludes�all�uses�of�captured�CO2 to replace other chemicals 
that are released into the atmosphere and that have high 
greenhouse-gas�potential,�fluorocarbons�for�example.�This�area�
is�covered�by�the�IPCC/TEAP�Special�Report�on�Safeguarding�
the�Ozone�Layer�and�the�Global�Climate�System:�issues�related�
to� Hydrofluorocarbons� and� Perfluorocarbons� (IPCC/TEAP,�
2005).
 
The third point is especially important in any effort to estimate 
the�potential�for�net�CO2 reductions from the substitution of a 
CO2-utilizing process for alternative routes to manufacturing 
a desired product. In particular, it is essential that the system 
boundary encompasses all ‘upstream’ processes in the overall 
life� cycle� and� does� not� focus� solely� on� the� final� production�
process of interest. The appropriate system boundary is shown 
schematically�in�Figure.�7.4�This�is�an�extension�of�the�system�
boundary diagrams shown earlier in Section 7.2 (Figure 7.1) 
and�in�Chapter�1�(Figure�1.4)�in�the�context�of�a�CO2 capture 
and storage system. The inputs include all fossil fuels together 
with all other materials used within the system. The fossil fuel 
input provides energy to the power or industrial plant, including 
the�CO2 capture system, as well as the elemental carbon used as 
building�blocks�for�the�new�chemical�compound.�Flows�of�CO2, 
energy and materials pass from the primary fuel-consuming 
processes�to�the�industrial�process�that�utilizes�the�captured�CO2. 
This produces a desired product (containing carbon derived 
from�captured�CO2) together with other products (such as useful 
energy from the power plant) and environmental emissions that 
may�include�CO2 plus other gaseous, liquid or solid residuals.
�
Once�the�overall�system�has�been�defined�and�analyzed�in�
this way, it can also be compared to an alternative system that 
does�not�involve�the�use�of�captured�CO2. Using basic mass and 
energy�balances,�the�overall�avoided�CO2 can then be assessed 
as the difference in net emissions associated with the production 
of a desired product. In general, the difference could be either 
positive�or�negative,�thus�meaning�that�utilization�of�CO2 could 
result� in� either� a� decrease� or� increase� in� net� CO2 emissions, 
depending on the details of the processes being compared. Note 
that only fossil fuels as a primary energy source are considered 
in this framework. Renewable energy sources and nuclear 
power� are� specifically� excluded,� as� their� availability� would�
have�implications�well�beyond�the�analysis�of�CO2 utilization 
options� (see� Chapter� 8� for� further� discussion).� Note� too� that�
other�emissions�from�the�process�may�include�toxic�or�harmful�
materials,�whose�flows�also�could�be�either�reduced�or�increased�
by�the�adoption�of�a�CO2-based process.

provides�energy�to�the�power�or�industrial�plant,�including�the�CO2 capture system, as well as the elemental carbon used as building blocks for the 
new�chemical�compound.�From�the�primary�fuel-consuming�processes,�flows�of�CO2, energy and materials pass to the industrial process, which 
utilizes�the�captured�CO2.�This�produces�a�desired�product�(containing�carbon,�derived�from�captured�CO2) together with other products (such as 
useful�energy�from�the�power�plant)�and�environmental�emissions�that�may�include�CO2 plus other gaseous, liquid or solid residuals.

IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
�
The�application�of�this�framework�to�the�assessment�of�CO2 
utilization processes is discussed in more detail later in this 
chapter.�First,�however,�we�will�examine�current�uses�of�CO2 
in� industrial� processes� and� their� potential� for� long-term� CO2 
storage.
7.3.2�
Present�industrial�uses�of�carbon�dioxide�
Carbon�dioxide�is�a�valuable�industrial�gas�with�a�large�number�
of� uses� that� include� production� of� chemicals,� for� example�
urea, refrigeration systems, inert agent for food packaging, 
beverages,�welding�systems,�fire�extinguishers,�water�treatment�
processes, horticulture, precipitated calcium carbonate for the 
paper industry and many other smaller-scale applications. Large 
quantities� of� carbon� dioxide� are� also� used� for� enhanced� oil�
recovery,�particularly�in�the�United�States�(see�Section�5.3.2).�
Accordingly,�there�is�extensive�technical�literature�dealing�with�
CO2�uses�in�industry�and�active�research�groups�are�exploring�
new�or�improved�CO2 utilization processes.
�
Much�of�the�carbon�dioxide�used�commercially�is�recovered�
from synthetic fertilizer and hydrogen plants, using either a 
chemical or physical solvent scrubbing system (see Section 
3.5.2).�Other�industrial�sources�of�CO2 include the fermentation 
of�sugar�(dextrose)�used�to�produce�ethyl�alcohol:
C6H12O6 → 2C2H5OH�+�2CO2�
(3)
Industrial�CO2 is also produced from limekilns, such as those 
used in the production of sodium carbonate and in the Kraft 
wood pulping process. This involves the heating (calcining) of 
a raw material such as limestone:
CaCO3 →�CaO�+�CO2�
(4)
In some parts of the world, such as the United States, Italy, 
Norway�and�Japan,�some�CO2�is�extracted�from�natural�CO2 
wells. It is also recovered during the production and treatment 
of�raw�natural�gas�that�often�contains�CO2 as an impurity (see 
Chapter�2�for�more�details�about�CO2 sources).
A�large�proportion�of�all�CO2 recovered is used at the point 
of production to make further chemicals of commercial 
importance,�chiefly�urea�and�methanol.�The�CO2 recovered for 
other�commercial�uses�is�purified,�liquefied,�delivered�and�stored�

New�processes�for�CO2�abatement
7.3.3.1 
Organic chemicals and polymers
A number of possible new process routes for the production of 
chemicals�and�polymers�have�been�considered�in�which�CO2 is 
used as a substitute for other C1 building blocks, such as carbon 
monoxide,�methane�and�methanol.�The�use�of�CO2, an inert gas 
whose�carbon�is�in�a�highly�oxidized�state,�requires�development�
of� efficient� catalytic� systems� and,� in� general,� the� use� of�
additional�energy�for�CO2 reduction. Chemicals that have been 
considered include polyurethanes and polycarbonates, where 
the motivation has primarily been to avoid the use of phosgene 
because�of�its�extreme�toxicity,�rather�than�to�find�a�sink�for�
CO2. The proposed processes can have a lower overall energy 
consumption than the current phosgene-based routes leading to 
further�CO2 emission reductions. Current world consumption 
of polycarbonates is about 2.7 Mt yr–1. If all polycarbonate 
production� was� converted� to� CO2-based processes the direct 
consumption�of�CO2�would�be�about�0.6�MtCO2yr-1.�Some�CO2

are claimed for energy/materials changes in the process.
 
Similarly, if all world polyurethane production was 
converted,� then� direct� CO2 consumption would be about 2.7 
MtCO2/yr. However, little progress in commercial application 
of�CO2-based production has been reported. And as indicated 
earlier,�these�possible�CO2 applications directly affect only a 
very� small� fraction� of� the� anthropogenic� CO2 emitted to the 
atmosphere.� The� net� savings� in� CO2 would be even smaller 
or could be negative, as the energy that was available in the 
hydrocarbon�resource�is�missing�in�the�CO2 feedstock and unless 
compensated�for�by�improved�process�efficiency�it�would�have�
to be made up by additional energy supplies and their associated 
CO2 emissions.
7.3.3.2 
Fuel production using carbon dioxide
Liquid carbon-based fuels, gasoline and methanol for 
example,� are� attractive� because� of� their� high� energy� density�
and convenience of use, which is founded in part on a well-
established� infrastructure.� Carbon� dioxide� could� become� the�
raw material for producing carbon-based fuels with the help 
of additional energy. Since energy is conserved, this cannot 
provide�a�net�reduction�in�carbon�dioxide�emissions�as�long�as�
the underlying energy source is fossil carbon. If a unit of energy 
from� a� primary� resource� produces� a� certain� amount� of� CO2, 
then�producing�a�fuel�from�CO2�will�recycle�CO2 but release 
an�equivalent�amount�of�CO2 to provide the necessary energy 
for the conversion. Since all these conversion processes involve 
energy� losses,� the� total� CO2 generated during fuel synthesis 
tends�to�exceed�the�CO2 converted, which once used up, is also 
emitted.
�
Production� of� liquid� carbon-based� fuels� from� CO2 only 
reduces�CO2 emissions if the underlying energy infrastructure 
is� not� based� on� fossil� energy.� For� example,� one� could� still�
use gasoline or methanol rather than converting the transport 
sector�to�hydrogen,�by�using�hydrogen�and�CO2 as feedstocks 
for producing gasoline or methanol. The hydrogen would be 
produced from water, using hydropower, nuclear energy, solar 
energy or wind energy. As long as some power generation 
using�fossil�fuels�remains,�carbon�dioxide�for�this�conversion�
will� be� available� (Eliasson,� 1994).�Alternatively,� it� might� be�
possible�to�create�a�closed�cycle�with�CO2 being retrieved from 
the atmosphere by biological or chemical means. Such cycles 
would rely on the availability of cheap, clean and abundant 
non-fossil energy, as would the hydrogen economy, and as such 
they are beyond the scope of this report.
�
Methanol�production�is�an�example�of�the�synthesis�of�liquid�
fuels�from�CO2�and�hydrogen.�Today�a�mixture�of�CO,�CO2 and 
hydrogen�is�produced�through�reforming�or�partial�oxidation�
or auto thermal reforming of fossil fuels, mainly natural gas. 
The�methanol�producing�reactions,�which�are�exothermic,�take�
place�over�a�copper/zinc/alumina�catalyst�at�about�260°C�(Inui,�
1996;�Arakawa,� 1998;� Ushikoshi� et al.,� 1998;� Halmann� and�
Steinberg,�1999):
CO�+�2H2 → CH3OH�
(5)
CO2�+�3H2 → CH3OH�+�H2O�
(6)
Alternatively� one� could� exploit� only� reaction� (6),� by� using�
captured�CO2 and hydrogen from water hydrolysis powered for 
instance by solar energy (Sano et al.,�1998).
7.3.3.3 
Capture of CO2 in biomass
Biomass production of fuels also falls into the category of 
generating� fuels� from� CO2.�With� the� help� of� photosynthesis,�
solar�energy�can�convert�water�and�CO2 into energetic organic 
compounds like starch. These in turn can be converted into 
industrial fuels like methane, methanol, hydrogen or bio-
diesel�(Larson,�1993).�Biomass�can�be�produced�in�natural�or�
agricultural settings, or in industrial settings, where elevated 
concentrations�of�CO2 from the off-gas of a power plant would 
feed�micro-algae�designed�to�convert�CO2 into useful chemicals 
(Benemann,� 1997).� Since� biological� processes� collect� their�
own�CO2,�they�actually�perform�CO2�capture�(Dyson,�1976).�
If the biomass is put to good use, they also recycle carbon by 
returning it to its energetic state. Biomass production eliminates 
the need for fossil fuels, because it creates a new generation of 
biomass-based carbonaceous fuels. As a replacement for fossil 
energy�it�is�outside�the�scope�of�this�report.�As�a�CO2 capture 
technology, biomass production is ultimately limited by the 
efficiency� of� converting� light� into� chemically� stored� energy.�
Currently� solar� energy� conversion� efficiencies� in� agricultural�
biomass�production�are�typically�below�1%�(300�GJ�ha–1 yr–1 or 
1�W�m–2�(Larson,�1993)).�Micro-algae�production�is�operating�
at�slightly�higher�rates�of�1�to�2%�derived�by�converting�photon�
utilization�efficiency�into�a�ratio�of�chemical�energy�per�unit�
of solar energy (Melis et al.,�1998;�Richmond�and�Zou,�1999).�
Hence the solar energy collection required for micro-algae to 
capture�a�power�plant’s�CO2 output is about one hundred times 
larger than the power plant’s electricity output. At an average 
of�200�W�m–2�solar�irradiation,�a�100�MW�power�plant�would�
require�a�solar�collection�area�in�the�order�of�50�km2.
7.3.4�
Assessment�of�the�mitigation�potential�of�CO2 
utilization
This�final�section�aims�at�clarifying�the�following�points:�(i)�
to�what�extent�the�carbon�chemical�pool�stores�CO2; (ii) how 
long�CO2 is stored in the carbon chemical pool; (iii) how large 
the contribution of the carbon chemical pool is to emission 
mitigation.
�
To� consider� the� first� point,� the� extent� of� CO2 storage 
provided by the carbon chemical pool, it is worth referring 
again�to�Table�7.2.�As�reported�there,�total�industrial�CO2 use is 
approximately�115�MtCO2 yr-1.�Production�of�urea�is�the�largest�
consumer�of�CO2,�accounting�for�over�60%�of�that�total.�To�put�
it�in�perspective,�the�total�is�only�0.5%�of�total�anthropogenic�
CO2�emissions�–�about�24�GtCO2 yr-1. However, it is essential 
to�realize�that�these�figures�represent�only�the�yearly�CO2�flux�
in and out of the carbon chemical pool, and not the actual size 
of the pool, which is controlled by marketing and product 
distribution considerations and might be rather smaller than 
334
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
the�total�yearly�CO2 consumption. Moreover, the contribution 
to the storage of carbon – on a yearly basis for instance – does 
not correspond to the size of the pool, but to its size variation 
on a yearly basis, or in general on its rate of change that might 
be�positive�(increase�of�carbon�storage�and�reduction�of�CO2 
emissions) or negative (decrease of carbon storage and increase 
of�CO2 emissions) depending on the evolution of the markets and 
of�the�distribution�systems�(see�also�Box�7.2�for�a�quantitative�
example).�Data�on�the�amount�of�carbon�stored�as�inventory�of�
these materials in the supply chain and on the rate of change of 
this�amount�is�not�available,�but�the�figures�in�Table�7.2�and�the�
analysis above indicate that the quantity of captured carbon that 
could be stored is very small compared with total anthropogenic 
carbon�emissions.�Thus,�the�use�of�captured�CO2 in industrial 
processes could have only a minute (if any) effect on reduction 
of�net�CO2 emissions.
�
As�to�the�second�point,�the�duration�of�CO2 storage in the 
carbon�chemical�pool�and�typical�lifetime�of�the�CO2 consuming 
chemicals�when�in�use�before�being�degraded�to�CO2 that is 
emitted to the atmosphere, are given in the last column of 
Table 7.2 Rather broad ranges are associated with classes of 
compounds consisting of a variety of different chemicals. The 
lifetime�of�the�materials�produced�that�could�use�captured�CO2 
could vary from a few hours for a fuel such as methanol, to a 
few months for urea fertilizer, to decades for materials such as 
plastics and laminates, particularly those materials used in the 
construction industry. This indicates that even when there is a 
net�storage�of�CO2 as discussed in the previous paragraph, the 
duration of such storage is limited.
�
As� to� the� last� point,� the� extent� of� emission� mitigation�
provided�by�the�use�of�captured�CO2 to produce the compounds 
in the carbon chemical pool. Replacing carbon derived from a 
fossil�fuel�in�a�chemical�process,�for�example�a�hydrocarbon,�
with�captured�CO2 is sometimes possible, but does not affect 
the�overall�carbon�budget,�thus�CO2 does not replace the fossil 
fuel feedstock. The hydrocarbon has in fact two functions – it 
provides energy and it provides carbon as a building block. The 
CO2 fails to provide energy, since it is at a lower energy level than 
the�hydrocarbon�(see�Box�7.3).�The�energy�of�the�hydrocarbon�
is often needed in the chemical process and, as in the production 
of most plastics, it is embodied in the end product. Alternatively, 
the energy of the hydrocarbon is available and likely to be 
utilized�in�other�parts�of�the�process,�purification,�pretreatment�
for�example,�or�in�other�processes�within�the�same�plant.�If�this�
energy�is�missing,�since�CO2 is used as carbon source, it has to 
be replaced somehow to close the energy balance of the plant. 
As long as the replacement energy is provided from fossil fuels, 
net�CO2 emissions will remain unchanged. It is worth noting 
that an economy with large non-fossil energy resources could 
consider�CO2 feedstocks to replace hydrocarbons in chemical 
synthesis. Such approaches are not covered here, since they 
are�specific�examples�of�converting�to�non-fossil�energy�and�as�
such are driven by the merits of the new energy source rather 
than�by�the�need�for�capture�and�storage�of�CO2.
7.3.5�
Future�scope
The�scale�of�the�use�of�captured�CO2 in industrial processes is 
too small, the storage times too short and the energy balance too 
unfavourable�for�industrial�uses�of�CO2�to�become�significant�
as a means of mitigating climate change. There is a lack of data 
available�to�adequately�assess�the�possible�overall�CO2 inventory 
of� processes� that� involve� CO2 substitution with associated 
energy balances and the effects of changes in other feedstocks 
The�carbon�chemical�pool�is�the�ensemble�of�anthropogenic�carbon�containing�organic�chemicals.�This�box�aims�to�provide�
criteria�for�measuring�the�quantitative�impact�on�carbon�mitigation�of�such�a�pool.�If�this�impact�were�significant,�using�carbon�
from�CO2�could�be�an�attractive�storage�option�for�captured�CO2. 
�
� Considering�a�specific�chemical�A,�whose�present�worldwide�production�is�12�Mt�yr–1, whose worldwide inventory is 1 Mt 
–�the�monthly�production�–�and�whose�lifetime�before�degradation�to�CO2 and release to the atmosphere is less than one year. 
If�next�year�production�and�inventory�of�A�do�not�change,�the�contribution�to�CO2 storage of this member of the chemical pool 
will�be�null.�If�production�increased�by�a�factor�ten�to�120�Mt�yr–1, whereas inventory were still 1 Mt, again the contribution 
of�A�to�CO2 storage would be null.
�
If�on�the�contrary�next�year�production�increases�and�inventory�also�increases,�for�example�to�3�Mt,�to�cope�with�increased�
market�demand,�the�contribution�of�A�to�CO2�storage�over�the�year�will�be�equivalent�to�the�amount�of�CO2 stoichiometrically 
needed to produce 2 Mt of A. However, if due to better distribution policies and despite increased production, the worldwide 
inventory�of�A�decreased�to�0.7�Mt,�then�A�would�yield�a�negative�contribution�to�CO2 storage, thus over the year the amount 
of�CO2�stoichiometrically�needed�to�produce�0.3�Mt�of�A�would�be�additionally�emitted�to�the�atmosphere.
�
Therefore,�the�impact�on�carbon�dioxide�mitigation�of�the�carbon�chemical�pool�does�not�depend�on�the�amounts�of�carbon�
containing�chemical�products�produced;�there�is�CO2 emission reduction in a certain time only if the pool has grown during 
that�time.�With�increasing�production,�such�impact�can�be�positive�or�negative,�as�shown�above.�It�is�clear�that�since�this�would�
be a second or third order effect with respect to the overall production of carbon containing chemicals – itself much smaller in 
terms�of�fossil�fuel�consumption�than�fossil�fuel�combustion�–�this�impact�will�be�insignificant�compared�with�the�scale�of�the�
challenge�that�carbon�dioxide�capture�and�storage�technologies�have�to�confront.

CO2 can be used as a provider of carbon atoms for chemical synthesis, as an alternative to standard processes where the carbon 
atom�source�is�fossil�carbon,�as�coal�or�methane�or�other.�This�includes�processes�where�the�carbon�atom�in�the�CO2 molecule 
is�either�reduced�by�providing�energy,�for�example�methanol�synthesis,�or�does�not�change�its�oxidation�state�and�does�not�need�
energy,�synthesis�of�polycarbonates�for�example.
�
For�the�sake�of�simplicity�let�us�consider�a�reaction�from�carbon�to�an�organic�final�product�A�(containing�n�carbon�atoms)�
that takes place in a chemical plant (standard process):
 
nC → A 
(7)
Let�us�also�consider�the�alternative�route�whereby�CO2 captured from the power plant where carbon has been burnt is used in 
the chemical plant where the synthesis of A is carried out. In this case the sequence of reactions would be:
 
nC →�nCO2 → A�
(8)
The�overall�energy�change�upon�transformation�of�C�into�A,�ΔH,�is�the�same�in�both�cases.�The�difference�between�the�two�
cases�is�that�in�case�(8)�this�overall�energy�change�is�split�into�two�parts�–�ΔH=ΔHcom+ΔHsyn – one for combustion in the power 
plant�and�the�other�for�the�synthesis�of�A�from�CO2�in�the�chemical�plant�(ΔHcom�will�be�–400�which�means�400�are�made�
available�by�the�combustion�of�carbon).�If�ΔH�is�negative,�that�means�an�overall�exothermic�reaction�(1),�then�ΔHsyn will be 
either�negative�or�even�positive.�If�ΔH�is�positive,�that�means�an�overall�endothermic�reaction�(7),�then�ΔHsyn will be even 
more�positive.�In�both�cases,�exothermic�or�endothermic�reaction,�the�chemical�plant�will�lack�400�kJ/molC�energy�in�case�(2)�
with�respect�to�case�(1).�This�energy�has�already�been�exploited�in�the�power�plant�and�is�no�longer�available�in�the�chemical�
plant.�It�is�worth�noting�that�large-scale�chemical�plants�(these�are�those�of�interest�for�the�purpose�of�carbon�dioxide�emission�
mitigation)�make�the�best�possible�use�of�their�energy�by�applying�so-called�heat�integration,�for�example�by�optimizing�energy�
use�through�the�whole�plant�and�not�just�for�individual�processes.�In�case�(1)�chemical�plants�make�good�use�of�the�400�kJ/
molC�that�are�made�available�by�the�reaction�(7)�in�excess�of�the�second�step�of�reaction�(8).
�
Therefore,�in�terms�of�energy�there�is�no�benefit�in�choosing�path�(8)�rather�than�path�(7).�In�terms�of�efficiency�of�the�
whole chemical process there might be a potential improvement, but there might also be a potential disadvantage, since route 
(7)�integrates�the�heat�generation�associated�with�the�oxidation�of�carbon�and�the�conversion�to�product�A.�These�effects�are�
of�second�order�importance�and�have�to�be�evaluated�on�a�case-by-case�basis.�Nevertheless,�the�scale�of�the�reduction�in�CO2 
emissions would be rather small, since it would be even smaller than the scale of the production of the chemicals that might be 
impacted�by�the�technology�change,�that�is�by�the�change�from�path�(7)�to�path�(8)�(Audus�and�Oonk,�1997).
and emissions. However, the analysis above demonstrates that, 
although�the�precise�figures�are�difficult�to�estimate�and�even�
their sign is questionable, the contribution of these technologies 
to�CO2 storage is negligible. Research is continuing on the use 
of�CO2 in organic chemical polymer and plastics production, 
but the drivers are generally cost, elimination of hazardous 
chemical� intermediates� and� the� elimination� of� toxic� wastes,�
rather�than�the�storage�of�CO2.

ExECutivE SummARy
The major components of a carbon dioxide capture and storage 
(CCS) system include capture (separation plus compression), 
transport, and storage (including measurement, monitoring 
and verification). In one form or another, these components 
are commercially available. However, there is relatively 
little commercial experience with configuring all of these 
components into fully integrated CCS systems at the kinds of 
scales which would likely characterize their future deployment. 
The literature reports a fairly wide range of costs for employing 
CCS systems with fossil-fired power production and various 
industrial processes. The range spanned by these cost estimates 
is driven primarily by site-specific considerations such as the 
technology characteristics of the power plant or industrial 
facility, the specific characteristics of the storage site, and the 
required transportation distance of carbon dioxide (CO2). In 
addition, estimates of the future performance of components 
of the capture, transport, storage, measurement and monitoring 
systems are uncertain. The literature reflects a widely held belief 
that the cost of building and operating CO2 capture systems will 
fall over time as a result of technological advances. 
 
The cost of employing a full CCS system for electricity 
generation from a fossil-fired power plant is dominated by the 
cost of capture. The application of capture technology would 
add about 1.8 to 3.4 US$ct kWh–1 to the cost of electricity from 
a pulverized coal power plant, 0.9 to 2.2 US$ct kWh–1 to the cost 
for electricity from an integrated gasification combined cycle 
coal power plant, and 1.2 to 2.4 US$ct kWh–1 from a natural-
gas combined-cycle power plant. Transport and storage costs 
would add between –1 and 1 US$ct kWh–1 to this range for 
coal plants, and about half as much for gas plants. The negative 
costs are associated with assumed offsetting revenues from CO2 
storage in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) or enhanced coal bed 
methane (ECBM) projects. Typical costs for transportation and 
geological storage from coal plants would range from 0.05–0.6 
US$ct kWh–1. CCS technologies can also be applied to other 
industrial processes, such as hydrogen (H2) production. In 
some of these non-power applications, the cost of capture is 
lower than for capture from fossil-fired power plants, but the 
concentrations and partial pressures of CO2 in the flue gases 
from these sources vary widely, as do the costs. In addition to 
fossil-based energy conversion processes, CCS may be applied 
to biomass-fed energy systems to create useful energy (electricity 
or transportation fuels). The product cost of these systems is 
very sensitive to the potential price of the carbon permit and the 
associated credits obtained with systems resulting in negative 
emissions. These systems can be fuelled solely by biomass, or 
biomass can be co-fired in conventional coal-burning plants, in 
which case the quantity is normally limited to about 10–15% of 
the energy input.
 
Energy and economic models are used to study future 
scenarios for CCS deployment and costs. These models indicate 
that CCS systems are unlikely to be deployed on a large scale 
in the absence of an explicit policy that substantially limits 
greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere. The literature and 
current industrial experience indicate that, in the absence of 
measures to limit CO2 emissions, there are only small, niche 
opportunities for the deployment of CCS technologies. These 
early opportunities for CCS deployment – that are likely to 
involve CO2 captured from high-purity, low-cost sources and 
used for a value-added application such as EOR or ECBM 
production – could provide valuable early experience with 
CCS deployment, and create parts of the infrastructure and 
knowledge base needed for the future large-scale deployment 
of CCS systems.
 
With greenhouse gas emission limits imposed, many 
integrated assessment analyses indicate that CCS systems will 
be competitive with other large-scale mitigation options, such 
as nuclear power and renewable energy technologies. Most 
energy and economic modelling done to date suggests that 
the deployment of CCS systems starts to be significant when 
carbon prices begin to reach approximately 25–30 US$/tCO2 
(90–110 US$/tC). They foresee the large-scale deployment 
of CCS systems within a few decades from the start of any 
significant regime for mitigating global warming. The literature 
indicates that deployment of CCS systems will increase in line 
with the stringency of the modelled emission reduction regime. 
Least-cost CO2 concentration stabilization scenarios, that 
also take into account the economic efficiency of the system, 
indicate that emissions mitigation becomes progressively more 
stringent over time. Most analyses indicate that, notwithstanding 
significant penetration of CCS systems by 2050, the majority 
of CCS deployment will occur in the second half of this 
century. They also indicate that early CCS deployment will 
be in the industrialized nations, with deployment eventually 
spreading worldwide. While different scenarios vary the 
quantitative mix of technologies needed to meet the modelled 
emissions constraint, the literature consensus is that CCS could 
be an important component of a broad portfolio of energy 
technologies and emission reduction approaches. In addition, 
CCS technologies are compatible with the deployment of other 
potentially important long-term greenhouse gas mitigation 
technologies such as H2 production from biomass and fossil 
fuels. 
 
Published estimates (for CO2 stabilization scenarios between 
450–750 ppmv) of the global cumulative amount of CO2 that 
might be stored over the course of this century in the ocean 
and various geological formations span a wide range: from 
very small contributions to thousands of gigatonnes of CO2. 
This wide range can largely be explained by the uncertainty 
of long-term, socio-economic, demographic and technological 
change, the main drivers of future CO2 emissions. However, it 
is important to note that the majority of stabilization scenarios 
from 450–750 ppmv tend to cluster in the range of 220–2200 
GtCO2 (60–600 GtC). This demand for CO2 storage appears to 
be within global estimates of total CO2 storage capacity. The 
actual use of CCS is likely to be lower than the estimates for 
economic potential indicated by these energy and economic 
models, as there are other barriers to technology development 
not adequately accounted for in these modelling frameworks. 
Examples include concerns about environmental impact, the lack 
342

of a clear legal framework and uncertainty about how quickly 
learning-by-doing will lower costs. This chapter concludes with 
a review of knowledge gaps that affect the reliability of these 
model results.
 
Given the potential for hundreds to thousands of gigatonnes 
of CO2 to be stored in various geological formations and the 
ocean, questions have been raised about the implications of 
gradual leakage from these reservoirs. From an economic 
perspective, such leakage – if it were to occur – can be thought 
of as another potential source of future CO2 emissions, with 
the cost of offsetting this leaked CO2 being equal to the cost of 
emission offsets when the stored CO2 leaks to the atmosphere. 
Within this purely economic framework, the few studies that 
have looked at this topic indicate that some CO2 leakage can be 
accommodated while progressing towards the goal of stabilizing 
atmospheric concentrations of CO2.
8.1  
introduction 
In this chapter, we address two of the key questions about 
any CO2 mitigation technology: ‘How much will it cost?’ and 
‘How do CCS technologies fit into a portfolio of greenhouse 
gas mitigation options?’ There are no simple answers to 
these questions. Costs for CCS technologies depend on many 
factors: fuel prices, the cost of capital, and costs for meeting 
potential regulatory requirements like monitoring, to just name 
a few. Add to this the uncertainties associated with technology 
development, the resource base for storage potential, the 
regulatory environment, etc., and it becomes obvious why there 
are many answers to what appear to be simple questions.
 
This chapter starts (in Section 8.2) by looking at the costs 
of the system components, namely capture and compression, 
transport, and storage (including monitoring costs and by-
product credits from operations such as EOR). The commercial 
operations associated with each of these components provide a 
basis for the assessment of current costs. Although it involves 
greater uncertainty, an assessment is also included of how 
these costs will change in the future. The chapter then reviews 
the findings from economic modelling (Section 8.3). These 
models take component costs at various levels of aggregation 
and then model how the costs change with time and how CCS 
technologies compete with other CO2 mitigation options given 
a variety of economic and policy assumptions. The chapter 
concludes with an examination of the economic implications 
of different storage times (Section 8.4) and a summary of the 
known knowledge gaps (Section 8.5).
8.2  
Component costs
This section presents cost summaries for the three key 
components of a CCS system, namely capture (including 
compression), transport, and storage. Sections 8.2.1–8.2.3 
summarize the results from Chapters 3–7. Readers are referred 
to those chapters for more details of component costs. Results 
are presented here in the form most convenient for each section. 
Transport costs are given in US$/tCO2 per kilometre, while 
storage costs are stated in US$/tCO2 stored. Capture costs for 
different types of power plants are represented as an increase 
in the electricity generation cost (US$ MWh–1). A discussion of 
how one integrates the costs of capture, transport and storage 
for a particular system into a single value is presented in Section 
8.2.4.
8.2.1 
Capture and compression1
For most large sources of CO2 (e.g., power plants), the cost of 
capturing CO2 is the largest component of overall CCS costs. 
In this report, capture costs include the cost of compressing 
the CO2 to a pressure suitable for pipeline transport (typically 
about 14 MPa). However, the cost of any additional booster 
compressors that may be needed is included in the cost of 
transport and/or storage.
 
The total cost of CO2 capture includes the additional capital 
requirements, plus added operating and maintenance costs 
incurred for any particular application. For current technologies, 
a substantial portion of the overall cost is due to the energy 
requirements for capture and compression. As elaborated in 
Chapter 3, a large number of technical and economic factors 
related to the design and operation of both the CO2 capture 
system, and the power plant or industrial process to which it is 
applied, influence the overall cost of capture. For this reason, 
the reported costs of CO2 capture vary widely, even for similar 
applications.
 
Table 8.1 summarizes the CO2 capture costs reported in 
Chapter 3 for baseload operations of new fossil fuel power 
plants (in the size range of 300–800 MW) employing current 
commercial technology. The most widely studied systems are 
new power plants based on coal combustion or gasification. 
For costs associated with retrofitting existing power plants, see 
Table 3.8. For a modern (high-efficiency) coal-burning power 
plant, CO2 capture using an amine-based scrubber increases 
the cost of electricity generation (COE) by approximately 40 
to 70 per cent while reducing CO2 emissions per kilowatt-hour 
(kWh) by about 85%. The same CO2 capture technology applied 
to a new natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) plant increases 
the COE by approximately 40 to 70 per cent. For a new coal-
based plant employing an integrated gasification combined 
cycle (IGCC) system, a similar reduction in CO2 using current 
technology (in this case, a water gas shift reactor followed by a 
physical absorption system) increases the COE by 20 to 55%. 
The lower incremental cost for IGCC systems is due in large 
part to the lower gas volumes and lower energy requirements 
for CO2 capture relative to combustion-based systems. It should 
be noted that the absence of industrial experience with large-
scale capture of CO2 in the electricity sector means that these 
numbers are subject to uncertainties, as is explained in Section 
3.7.

IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
Studies indicate that, in most cases, IGCC plants are slightly 
higher in cost without capture and slightly lower in cost with 
capture than similarly sized PC plants fitted with a CCS 
system. On average, NGCC systems have a lower COE than 
both types of new coal-based plants with or without capture 
for baseload operation. However, the COE for each of these 
systems can vary markedly due to regional variations in fuel 
cost, plant utilization, and a host of other parameters. NGCC 
costs are especially sensitive to the price of natural gas, which 
has risen significantly in recent years. So comparisons of 
alternative power system costs require a particular context to 
be meaningful.
 
For existing, combustion-based, power plants, CO2 capture 
can be accomplished by retrofitting an amine scrubber to the 
existing plant. However, a limited number of studies indicate 
that the post-combustion retrofit option is more cost-effective 
when accompanied by a major rebuild of the boiler and turbine 
to increase the efficiency and output of the existing plant by 
converting it to a supercritical unit. For some plants, similar 
benefits can be achieved by repowering with an IGCC system 
that includes CO2 capture technology. The feasibility and cost 
of any of these options is highly dependent on site-specific 
circumstances, including the size, age and type of unit, and 
the availability of space for accommodating a CO2 capture 
system. There has not yet been any systematic comparison of 
the feasibility and cost of alternative retrofit and repowering 
options for existing plants, as well as the potential for more 
cost-effective options employing advanced technology such as 
oxyfuel combustion.
 
Table 8.1 also illustrates the cost of CO2 capture in the 
production of H2, a commodity used extensively today for fuels 
and chemical production, but also widely viewed as a potential 
energy carrier for future energy systems. Here, the cost of 
CO2 capture is mainly due to the cost of CO2 compression, 
since separation of CO2 is already carried out as part of the H2 
production process. Recent studies indicate that the cost of CO2 
capture for current processes adds approximately 5 to 30 per 
cent to the cost of the H2 product.
 
In addition to fossil-based energy conversion processes, CO2 
could also be captured in power plants fuelled with biomass. 
At present, biomass plants are small in scale (<100 MWe). 
Hence, the resulting costs of capturing CO2 are relatively high 
compared to fossil alternatives. For example, the capturing of 
0.19 MtCO2 yr-1 in a 24 MWe biomass IGCC plant is estimated 
to be about 82 US$/tCO2 (300 US$/tC), corresponding to an 
increase of the electricity costs due to capture of about 80 
US$ MWh–1 (Audus and Freund, 2004). Similarly, CO2 could 
be captured in biomass-fuelled H2 plants. The cost is reported 
to be between 22 and 25 US$/tCO2 avoided (80–92 US$/tC) 
in a plant producing 1 million Nm3 d–1 of H2 (Makihira et al., 
2003). This corresponds to an increase in the H2 product costs 
of about 2.7 US$ GJ–1 (i.e., 20% of the H2 costs without CCS). 
The competitiveness of biomass CCS systems is very sensitive 
to the value of CO2 emission reductions, and the associated 
credits obtained with systems resulting in negative emissions. 
Moreover, significantly larger biomass plants could benefit from 
economies of scale, bringing down costs of the CCS systems to 
broadly similar levels as those in coal plants. However, there is 
too little experience with large-scale biomass plants as yet, so 
that their feasibility has still not been proven and their costs are 
difficult to estimate.
 
CCS technologies can also be applied to other industrial 
processes. Since these other industrial processes produce 
off-gases that are very diverse in terms of pressure and CO2 
concentration, the costs range very widely. In some of these 
non-power applications where a relatively pure CO2 stream 
is produced as a by-product of the process (e.g., natural gas 
processing, ammonia production), the cost of capture is 
significantly lower than capture from fossil-fuel-fired power 
plants. In other processes like cement or steel production, 
capture costs are similar to, or even higher than, capture from 
fossil-fuel-fired power plants.
 
New or improved technologies for CO2 capture, combined 
with advanced power systems and industrial process designs, 
can significantly reduce the cost of CO2 capture in the future. 
While there is considerable uncertainty about the magnitude 
and timing of future cost reductions, studies suggest that 
improvements to current commercial technologies could lower 
CO2 capture costs by at least 20–30%, while new technologies 
currently under development may allow for more substantial 
cost reductions in the future. Previous experience indicates that 
the realization of cost reductions in the future requires sustained 
R&D in conjunction with the deployment and adoption of 
commercial technologies.
8.2.2 
Transport2
The most common and usually the most economical method 
to transport large amounts of CO2 is through pipelines. A cost-
competitive transport option for longer distances at sea might 
be the use of large tankers. 
 
The three major cost elements for pipelines are construction 
costs (e.g., material, labour, possible booster station), operation 
and maintenance costs (e.g., monitoring, maintenance, possible 
energy costs) and other costs (e.g., design, insurance, fees, 
right-of-way). Special land conditions, like heavily populated 
areas, protected areas such as national parks, or crossing 
major waterways, may have significant cost impacts. Offshore 
pipelines are about 40% to 70% more costly than onshore pipes 
of the same size. Pipeline construction is considered to be a 
mature technology and the literature does not foresee many cost 
reductions.
 
Figure 8.1 shows the transport costs for ‘normal’ terrain 
conditions. Note that economies of scale dramatically reduce 
the cost, but that transportation in mountainous or densely 
populated areas could increase cost. 
 
Tankers could also be used for transport. Here, the main cost 
elements are the tankers themselves (or charter costs), loading 
and unloading facilities, intermediate storage facilities, harbour 
2 This section is based on material presented in Section 4.6. The reader is 
referred to that section for a more detailed analysis and literature references.
Chapter 8: Cost and economic potential
345
fees, and bunker fuel. The construction costs for large special-
purpose CO2 tankers are not accurately known since none have 
been built to date. On the basis of preliminary designs, the costs 
of CO2 tankers are estimated at US$ 34 million for ships of 
10,000 tonnes, US$ 58 million for 30,000-tonne vessels, and 
US$ 82 million for ships with a capacity of 50,000 tonnes. 
 
To transport 6 MtCO2 per year a distance of 500 km by 
ship would cost about 10 US$/tCO2 (37 US$/tC) or 5 US$/
tCO2/250km (18 US$/tC/250km). However, since the cost 
is relatively insensitive to distance, transporting the same 6 
MtCO2 a distance of 1250 km would cost about 15 US$/tCO2 
(55 US$/tC) or 3 US$/tCO2/250km (11 US$/tC/250km). This is 
close to the cost of pipeline transport, illustrating the point that 
ship transport becomes cost-competitive with pipeline transport 
if CO2 needs to be transported over larger distances. However, 
the break-even point beyond which ship transportation becomes 
cheaper than pipeline transportation is not simply a matter of 
distance; it involves many other aspects.
8.2.3 
Storage 
8.2.3.1 
Geological storage3
Because the technologies and equipment used for geological 
storage are widely used in the oil and gas industries, the cost 
estimates can be made with confidence. However, there will 
be a significant range and variability of costs due to site-
specific factors: onshore versus offshore, the reservoir depth 
3 This section is based on material presented in Section 5.9. The reader is 
referred to that section for a more detailed analysis and literature references.
and the geological characteristics of the storage formation 
(e.g., permeability, thickness, etc.). Representative estimates of 
the cost for storage in saline formations and disused oil and 
gas fields (see Table 8.2) are typically between 0.5–8.0 US$/
tCO2 stored (2–29 US$/tC), as explained in Section 5.9.3. The 
lowest storage costs will be associated with onshore, shallow, 
high permeability reservoirs and/or the reuse of wells and 
infrastructure in disused oil and gas fields. 
 
The full range of cost estimates for individual options is 
very large. Cost information for storage monitoring is currently 
limited, but monitoring is estimated to add 0.1–0.3 US$ per 
tonne of CO2 stored (0.4–1.1 US$/tC). These estimates do not 
include any well remediation or long-term liabilities. The costs 
of storage monitoring will depend on which technologies are 
used for how long, regulatory requirements and how long-term 
monitoring strategies evolve.
 
When storage is combined with EOR, enhanced gas recovery 
(EGR) or ECBM, the benefits of enhanced production can offset 
some of the capture and storage costs. Onshore EOR operations 
have paid in the range of 10–16 US$ per tonne of CO2 (37–59 
US$/tC). The economic benefit of enhanced production depends 
very much on oil and gas prices. It should be noted that most 
of the literature used as the basis for this report did not take 
into account the rise in oil and gas prices that started in 2003. 
For example, oil at 50 US$/barrel could justify a credit of 30 
US$/tCO2 (110 US$/tC). The economic benefits from enhanced 
production make EOR and ECBM potential early cost-effective 
options for geological storage.

lines) and high ranges (dotted lines). Data based on various sources (for details see Chapter 4).

8.2.3.2 
Ocean storage4
The cost of ocean storage is a function of the distance offshore 
and injection depth. Cost components include offshore 
transportation and injection of the CO2. Various schemes for 
ocean storage have been considered. They include:
•� tankers to transport low temperature (–55 to –50oC), high 
pressure (0.6–0.7 MPa) liquid CO2 to a platform, from 
where it could be released through a vertical pipe to a depth 
of 3000 m;
•� carrier ships to transport liquid CO2, with injection through 
a towed pipe from a moving dispenser ship;
•� undersea pipelines to transport CO2 to an injection site.
Table 8.2 provides a summary of costs for transport distances of 
100–500 km offshore and an injection depth of 3000 m. 
Chapter 6 also discusses the option of carbonate neutralization, 
where flue-gas CO2 is reacted with seawater and crushed 
limestone. The resulting mixture is then released into the 
upper ocean. The cost of this process has not been adequately 
addressed in the literature and therefore the possible cost of 
employing this process is not addressed here.
8.2.3.3 
Storage via mineral carbonation5
Mineral carbonation is still in its R&D phase, so costs are 
uncertain. They include conventional mining and chemical 
processing. Mining costs include ore extraction, crushing and 
grinding, mine reclamation and the disposal of tailings and 
carbonates. These are conventional mining operations and 
several studies have produced cost estimates of 10 US$/tCO2 
(36 US$/tC) or less. Since these estimates are based on similar 
mature and efficient operations, this implies that there is a 
strong lower limit on the cost of mineral storage. Carbonation 
costs include chemical activation and carbonation. Translating 
today’s laboratory implementations into industrial practice 
yields rough cost estimates of about 50–100 US$/tCO2 stored

(180–370 US$/tC). Costs and energy penalties (30–50% of 
the power plant output) are dominated by the activation of 
the ore necessary to accelerate the carbonation reaction. For 
mineral storage to become practical, additional research must 
reduce the cost of the carbonation step by a factor of three to 
four and eliminate a significant portion of the energy penalty 
by, for example, harnessing as much as possible the heat of 
carbonation.
8.2.4 
Integrated systems 
The component costs given in this section provide a basis for 
the calculation of integrated system costs. However, the cost 
of mitigating CO2 emissions cannot be calculated simply by 
summing up the component costs for capture, transport and 
storage in units of ‘US$/tCO2’. This is because the amount of

Figure 8.2 CO2 capture and storage from power plants. The increased 
CO2 production resulting from loss in overall efficiency of power 
plants due to the additional energy required for capture, transport and 
storage, and any leakage from transport result in a larger amount of 
‘CO2 produced per unit of product’(lower bar) relative to the reference 
plant (upper bar) without capture
Chapter 8: Cost and economic potential
347
Box 8.1 Defining avoided costs for a fossil fuel power plant
In general, the capture, transport, and storage of CO2 require energy inputs. For a power plant, this means that amount of fuel 
input (and therefore CO2 emissions) increases per unit of net power output. As a result, the amount of CO2 produced per unit 
of product (e.g., a kWh of electricity) is greater for the power plant with CCS than the reference plant, as shown in Figure 8.2 
To determine the CO2 reductions one can attribute to CCS, one needs to compare CO2 emissions of the plant with capture to 
those of the reference plant without capture. These are the avoided emissions. Unless the energy requirements for capture and 
storage are zero, the amount of CO2 avoided is always less than the amount of CO2 captured. The cost in US$/tonne avoided 
is therefore greater than the cost in US$/tonne captured.
CO2 captured will be different from the amount of atmospheric 
CO2 emissions ‘avoided’ during the production of a given 
amount of a useful product (e.g., a kilowatt-hour of electricity 
or a kilogram of H2). So any cost expressed per tonne of CO2 
should be clearly defined in terms of its basis, e.g., either a 
captured basis or an avoided basis (see Box 8.1). Mitigation 
cost is best represented as avoided cost. Table 8.3 presents 
ranges for total avoided costs for CO2 capture, transport, and 
storage from four types of sources.
 
The mitigation costs (US$/tCO2 avoided) reported in Table 
8.3 are context-specific and depend very much on what is 
chosen as a reference plant. In Table 8.3, the reference plant is a 
power plant of the same type as the power plant with CCS. The 
mitigation costs here therefore represent the incremental cost of 
capturing and storing CO2 from a particular type of plant. 
 
In some situations, it can be useful to calculate a cost of CO2 
avoided based on a reference plant that is different from the 
CCS plant (e.g., a PC or IGCC plant with CCS using an NGCC 
reference plant). In Table 8.4, the reference plant represents the 
least-cost plant that would ‘normally’ be built at a particular 
location in the absence of a carbon constraint. In many regions 
today, this would be either a PC plant or an NGCC plant. 
 
A CO2 mitigation cost also can be defined for a collection of 
plants, such as a national energy system, subject to a given level 
of CO2 abatement. In this case the plant-level product costs 
presented in this section would be used as the basic inputs to 
energy-economic models that are widely used for policy analysis 
and for the quantification of overall mitigation strategies and 
costs for CO2 abatement. Section 8.3 discusses the nature of 
these models and presents illustrative model results, including 
the cost of CCS, its economic potential, and its relationship to 
other mitigation options.

CCS deployment scenarios
Energy-economic models seek the mathematical representation 
of key features of the energy system in order to represent the 
evolution of the system under alternative assumptions, such 
as population growth, economic development, technological 
change, and environmental sensitivity. These models have 
been employed increasingly to examine how CCS technologies 
would deploy in a greenhouse gas constrained environment. In 
this section we first provide a brief introduction to the types 
of energy and economic models and the main assumptions 
driving future greenhouse gas emissions and the corresponding 
measures to reduce them. We then turn to the principal focus of 
this section: an examination of the literature based on studies 
using these energy and economic models, with an emphasis on 
what they say about the potential use of CCS technologies. 
8.3.1 
Model approaches and baseline assumptions
The modelling of climate change abatement or mitigation 
scenarios is complex and a number of modelling techniques have 
been applied, including input-output models, macroeconomic 
(top-down) models, computable general equilibrium (CGE) 
models 
and 
energy-sector-based 
engineering 
models 
(bottom-up).

8.3.1.1 
Description of bottom-up and top-down models
The component and systems level costs provided in Section 
8.2 are based on technology-based bottom-up models. These 
models can range from technology-specific, engineering-
economic calculations embodied in a spreadsheet to broader, 
multi-technology, 
integrated, 
partial-equilibrium 
models. 
This may lead to two contrasting approaches: an engineering-
economic approach and a least-cost equilibrium one. In the 
first approach, each technology is assessed independently, 
taking into account all its parameters; partial-equilibrium least-
cost models consider all technologies simultaneously and at a 
higher level of aggregation before selecting the optimal mix of 
technologies in all sectors and for all time periods. 
 
Top-down models evaluate the system using aggregate 
economic variables. Econometric relationships between 
aggregated variables are generally more reliable than those 
between disaggregated variables, and the behaviour of the 
models tends to be more stable. It is therefore common to adopt 
high levels of aggregation for top-down models; especially 
when they are applied to longer-term analyses. Technology 
diffusion is often described in these top-down models in a more 
stylized way, for example using aggregate production functions 
with price-demand or substitution elasticities.
 
Both types of models have their strengths and weaknesses. 
Top-down models are useful for, among other things, calculating 
gross economic cost estimates for emissions mitigation. Most of 
these top-down macro-economic models tend to overstate costs 
of meeting climate change targets because, among other reasons, 
they do not take adequate account of the potential for no-regret 
measures and they are not particularly adept at estimating the 
benefits of climate change mitigation. On the other hand, many 
of these models – and this also applies to bottom-up models 
– are not adept at representing economic and institutional 
inefficiencies, which would lead to an underestimation of 
emissions mitigation costs.
 
Technologically disaggregated bottom-up models can take 
some of these benefits into account but may understate the 
costs of overcoming economic barriers associated with their 
deployment in the market. Recent modelling efforts have 
focused on the coupling of top-down and bottom-up models 
in order to develop scenarios that are consistent from both 
the macroeconomic and systems engineering perspectives. 
Readers interested in a more detailed discussion of these 
modelling frameworks and their application to understanding 
future energy, economic and emission scenarios are encouraged 
to consult the IPCC’s Working Group III’s assessment of the 
international work on both bottom-up and top-down analytical 
approaches (Third Assessment Report; IPCC, 2001).
8.3.1.2 
Assumptions embodied in emissions baselines
Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) constitute a particular 
category of energy and economic models and will be used 
here to describe the importance of emissions baselines before 
examining model projections of potential future CCS use. IAMs 
integrate the simulation of climate change dynamics with the 
modelling of the energy and economic systems. A common and 
illuminating type of analysis conducted with IAMs, and with 
other energy and economic models, involves the calculation of 
the cost differential or the examination of changes in the portfolio 
of energy technologies used when moving from a baseline (i.e., 
no climate policy) scenario to a control scenario (i.e., a case 
where a specific set of measures designed to constrain GHG 
emissions is modelled). It is therefore important to understand 
what influences the nature of these baseline scenarios. A 
number of parameters spanning economic, technological, 
natural and demographic resources shape the energy use and 
resulting emissions trajectories of these baseline cases. How 
these parameters change over time is another important aspect 
driving the baseline scenarios. A partial list of some of the 
major parameters that influence baseline scenarios include, for 
example, modelling assumptions centring on:
•� global 
and 
regional 
economic 
and 
demographic 
developments;
•� costs and availability of  
1) global and regional fossil fuel resources; 
2) fossil-based energy conversion technologies (power 
generation, H2 production, etc.), including technology-
specific parameters such as efficiencies, capacity 
factors, operation and maintenance costs as well as fuel 
costs;
3) zero-carbon energy systems (renewables and nuclear), 
which might still be non-competitive in the baseline 
but may play a major role competing for market shares 
with CCS if climate policies are introduced;
•� �rates of technological change in the baseline and the specific 
way in which technological change is represented in the 
model;
•� �the relative contribution of CO2 emissions from different 
economic sectors. 
Modelling all of these parameters as well as alternative 
assumptions for them yields a large number of ‘possible 
futures’. In other words, they yield a number of possible 
baseline scenarios. This is best exemplified by the Special 
Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES, 2000): it included four 
different narrative storylines and associated scenario families, 
and identified six ‘illustrative’ scenario groups – labelled 
A1FI, A1B, A1T, A2, B1, B2 – each representing different 
plausible combinations of socio-economic and technological 
developments in the absence of any climate policy (for a 
detailed discussion of these cases, see SRES, 2000). The six 
scenario groups depict alternative developments of the energy 
system based on different assumptions about economic and 
demographic change, hydrocarbon resource availability, energy 
demand and prices, and technology costs and their performance. 
They lead to a wide range of possible future worlds and CO2 
emissions consistent with the full uncertainty range of the 
underlying literature (Morita and Lee, 1998). The cumulative 
emissions from 1990 to 2100 in the scenarios range from less 
than 2930 to 9170 GtCO2 (800 to 2500 GtC). This range is 
divided into four intervals, distinguishing between scenarios 
350
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
with high, medium-high, medium-low, and low emissions:
•� high (≥6600 GtCO2 or ≥1800 GtC);
•� medium-high (5320–6600 GtCO2 or 1450–1800 GtC);
•� medium-low (4030–5320 GtCO2 or 1100–1450 GtC);
•� low (≤4030 GtCO2 or ≤1100 GtC). 
As illustrated in Figure 8.3, each of the intervals contains 
multiple scenarios from more than one of the six SRES 
scenario groups (see the vertical bars on the right side of Figure 
8.3, which show the ranges for cumulative emissions of the 
respective SRES scenario group). Other scenario studies, such 
as the earlier set of IPCC scenarios developed in 1992 (Pepper 
et al., 1992) project similar levels of cumulative emissions over 
the period 1990 to 2100, ranging from 2930 to 7850 GtCO2 
(800 to 2,140 GtC). For the same time horizon, the IIASA-
WEC scenarios (Nakicenovic et al., 1998) report 2,270–5,870 
GtCO2 (620–1,600 GtC), and the Morita and Lee (1998) 
database – which includes more than 400 emissions scenarios 
– report cumulative emissions up to 12,280 GtCO2 (3,350 GtC).  
 
The SRES scenarios illustrate that similar future emissions 
can result from very different socio-economic developments, 
and that similar developments in driving forces can nonetheless 
result in wide variations in future emissions. The scenarios also 
indicate that the future development of energy systems will play 
a central role in determining future emissions and suggests that 
technological developments are at least as important a driving 
force as demographic change and economic development. 
These findings have major implications for CCS, indicating that 
the pace at which these technologies will be deployed in the 
future – and therefore their long-term potential – is affected not 
so much by economic or demographic change but rather by the 
choice of the technology path of the energy system, the major 
driver of future emissions. For a detailed estimation of the 
technical potential of CCS by sector for some selected SRES 
baseline scenarios, see Section 2.3.2. In the next section we 
shall discuss the economic potential of CCS in climate control 
scenarios.
8.3.2 
CCS economic potential and implications
As shown by the SRES scenarios, uncertainties associated with 
alternative combinations of socio-economic and technological 
developments may lead to a wide range of possible future 
emissions. Each of the different baseline emissions scenarios has

alternative scenarios from the six SRES scenario groups that lead to comparable cumulative emissions. The vertical bars on the right-hand side

different implications for the potential use of CCS technologies 
in emissions control cases.10 Generally, the size of the future 
market for CCS depends mostly on the carbon intensity 
of the baseline scenario and the stringency of the assumed 
climate stabilization target. The higher the CO2 emissions in 
the baseline, the more emissions reductions are required to 
achieve a given level of allowable emissions, and the larger the 
markets for CCS. Likewise, the tighter the modelled constraint 
on CO2 emissions, the more CCS deployment there is likely 
to be. This section will examine what the literature says about 
possible CCS deployment rates, the timing of CCS deployment, 
the total deployment of these systems under various scenarios, 
the economic impact of CCS systems and how CCS systems 
interact with other emissions mitigation technologies.
8.3.2.1 
Key drivers for the deployment of CCS
Energy and economic models are increasingly being employed to 
examine how CCS technologies would deploy in environments 
where CO2 emissions are constrained (i.e., in control cases). A 
number of factors have been identified that drive the rate of 
CCS deployment and the scale of its ultimate deployment in 
modelled control cases:11 
1.  The policy regime; the interaction between CCS deployment 
and the policy regime in which energy is produced and 
consumed cannot be overemphasized; the magnitude and 
timing of early deployment depends very much on the 
policy environment; in particular, the cumulative extent 
of deployment over the long term depends strongly on 
the stringency of the emissions mitigation regime being 
modelled; comparatively low stabilization targets (e.g., 450 
ppmv) foster the relatively faster penetration of CCS and 
the more intensive use of CCS (where ‘intensity of use’ is 
measured both in terms of the percentage of the emissions 
reduction burden shouldered by CCS as well as in terms of 
how many cumulative gigatonnes of CO2 is to be stored) 
(Dooley et al., 2004b; Gielen and Podanski, 2004; Riahi 
and Roehrl, 2000);
2.  The reference case (baseline); storage requirements for 
stabilizing CO2 concentrations at a given level are very 
sensitive to the choice of the baseline scenario. In other 
words, the assumed socio-economic and demographic 
trends, and particularly the assumed rate of technological 
change, have a significant impact on CCS use (see Section 
8.3.1, Riahi and Roehrl, 2000; Riahi et al., 2003);
3.  The nature, abundance and carbon intensity of the energy 
resources / fuels assumed to exist in the future (e.g., a 
future world where coal is abundant and easily recoverable 
would use CCS technologies more intensively than a 
world in which natural gas or other less carbon-intensive 
technologies are inexpensive and widely available). See 
Edmonds and Wise (1998) and Riahi and Roehrl (2000) 
for a comparison of two alternative regimes of fossil fuel 
availability and their interaction with CCS;
4.  The introduction of flexible mechanisms such as emissions 
trading can significantly influence the extent of CCS 
deployment. For example, an emissions regime with few, 
or significantly constrained, emissions trading between 
nations entails the use of CCS technologies sooner and 
more extensively than a world in which there is efficient 
global emissions trading and therefore lower carbon permit 
prices (e.g., Dooley et al., 2000 and Scott et al., 2004). 
Certain regulatory regimes that explicitly emphasize CCS 
usage can also accelerate its deployment (e.g., Edmonds 
and Wise, 1998). 
5.  The rate of technological change (induced through learning 
or other mechanisms) assumed to take place with CCS and 
other salient mitigation technologies (e.g., Edmonds et al., 
2003, or Riahi et al., 2003). For example, Riahi et al. (2003) 
indicate that the long-term economic potential of CCS 
systems would increase by a factor of 1.5 if it assumed that 
technological learning for CCS systems would take place 
at rates similar to those observed historically for sulphur 
removal technologies when compared to the situation 
where no technological change is specified.12
The marginal value of CO2 emission reduction permits is one 
of the most important mechanisms through which these factors 
impact CCS deployment. CCS systems tend to deploy quicker 
and more extensively in cases with higher marginal carbon 
values. Most energy and economic modelling done to date 
suggests that CCS systems begin to deploy at a significant level 
when carbon dioxide prices begin to reach approximately 25–
30 US$/tCO2 (90–110 US$/tC) (IEA, 2004; Johnson and Keith, 
2004; Wise and Dooley, 2004; McFarland et al., 2004). The only 
caveat to this carbon price as a lower limit for the deployment 
of these systems is the ‘early opportunities’ literature discussed 
below.
 
Before turning to a specific focus on the possible contribution 
of CCS in various emissions mitigation scenarios, it is worth 
reinforcing the point that there is a broad consensus in the 
12 The factor increase of 1.5 corresponds to about 250 to 360 GtCO2 of additional 
capture and storage over the course of the century.
10  As no climate policy is assumed in SRES, there is also no economic value 
associated with carbon. The potential for CCS in SRES is therefore limited to 
applications where the supplementary benefit of injecting CO2 into the ground 
exceeds its costs (e.g., EOR or ECBM). The potential for these options is 
relatively small as compared to the long-term potential of CCS in stabilization 
scenarios. Virtually none of the global modelling exercises in the literature that 
incorporate SRES include these options and so there is also no CCS system 
deployment assumed in the baseline scenarios.
11 Integrated assessment models represent the world in an idealized way, 
employing different methodologies for the mathematical representation of socio-
economic and technological developments in the real world. The representation 
of some real world factors, such as institutional barriers, inefficient legal 
frameworks, transaction costs of carbon permit trading, potential free-rider 
behaviour of geopolitical agents and the implications of public acceptance has 
traditionally been a challenge in modelling. These factors are represented to 
various degrees (often generically) in these models
352
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
technical literature that no single mitigation measure will be 
adequate to achieve a stable concentration of CO2. This means 
that the CO2 emissions will most likely be reduced from baseline 
scenarios by a portfolio of technologies in addition to other 
social, behavioural and structural changes (Edmonds et al., 2003; 
Riahi and Roehrl, 2000). In addition, the choice of a particular 
stabilization level from any given baseline significantly affects 
the technologies needed for achieving the necessary emissions 
reduction (Edmonds et al., 2000; Roehrl and Riahi, 2000). For 
example, a wider range of technological measures and their 
widespread diffusion, as well as more intensive use, are required 
for stabilizing at 450 ppmv compared with stabilization at higher 
levels (Nakicenovic and Riahi, 2001). These and other studies 
(e.g., IPCC, 2001) have identified several classes of robust 
mitigation measures: reductions in demand and/or efficiency 
improvements; substitution among fossil fuels; deployment of 
non-carbon energy sources (i.e., renewables and nuclear); CO2 
capture and storage; and afforestation and reforestation.
8.3.3 
The share of CCS in total emissions mitigation
When used to model energy and carbon markets, the aim of 
integrated assessment models is to capture the heterogeneity 
that characterizes energy demand, energy use and the varying 
states of development of energy technologies that are in use at 
any given point in time, as well as over time. These integrated 
Figure 8.4 The set of graphs shows how two different integrated assessment models (MiniCAM and MESSAGE) project the development of 
global primary energy (upper panels) and the corresponding contribution of major mitigation measures (middle panels). The lower panel depicts 
the marginal carbon permit price in response to a modelled mitigation regime that seeks to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of CO2 at 550 
ppmv. Both scenarios adopt harmonized assumptions with respect to the main greenhouse gas emissions drivers in accordance with the IPCC-
SRES B2 scenario (Source: Dooley et al., 2004b; Riahi and Roehrl, 2000).
Chapter 8: Cost and economic potential
353
assessment tools are also used to model changes in market 
conditions that would alter the relative cost-competitiveness of 
various energy technologies. For example, the choice of energy 
technologies would vary as carbon prices rise, as the population 
grows or as a stable population increases its standard of living.  
 
The graphs in Figure 8.4 show how two different integrated 
assessment models (MiniCAM and MESSAGE) project the 
development of global primary energy (upper panels), the 
contribution of major mitigation measures (middle panels), 
and the marginal carbon permit price in response to a modelled 
policy that seeks to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of 
CO2 at 550 ppmv in accordance with the main greenhouse gas 
emissions drivers of the IPCC-SRES B2 scenario (see Box 8.2). 
As can be seen from Figure 8.4, CCS coupled with coal and 
natural-gas-fired electricity generation are key technologies in 
the mitigation portfolio in both scenarios and particularly in 
the later half of the century under this particular stabilization 
scenario. However, solar/wind, biomass, nuclear power, etc. 
still meet a sizeable portion of the global demand for electricity. 
This demonstrates that the world is projected to continue to 
use a multiplicity of energy technologies to meet its energy 
demands and that, over space and time, a large portfolio of 
these technologies will be used at any one time.
 
When assessing how various technologies will contribute 
to the goal of addressing climate change, these technologies 
are modelled in such a way that they all compete for market 
share to provide the energy services and emissions reduction 
required by society, as this is what would happen in reality. 
There are major uncertainties associated with the potential and 
costs of these options, and so the absolute deployment of CCS 
depends on various scenario-specific assumptions consistent 
with the underlying storyline and the way they are interpreted 
in the different models. In the light of this competition and the 
wide variety of possible emissions futures, the contribution of 
CCS to total emissions reduction can only be assessed within 
relatively wide margins. 
 
The uncertainty with respect to the future deployment of 
CCS and its contribution to total emissions reductions for 
achieving stabilization of CO2 concentrations between 450 and 
750 ppmv is illustrated by the IPCC TAR mitigation scenarios 
(Morita et al., 2000; 2001). The TAR mitigation scenarios are 
based upon SRES baseline scenarios and were developed by nine 
different modelling teams. In total, 76 mitigation scenarios were 
developed for TAR, and about half of them (36 scenarios from 
three alternative models: DNE21, MARIA, and MESSAGE) 
consider CO2 capture and storage explicitly as a mitigation 
option. An overview of the TAR scenarios is presented in Morita 
et al. (2000). It includes eleven publications from individual 
modelling teams about their scenario assumptions and results. 
 
As illustrated in Figure 8.5, which is based upon the 
TAR mitigation scenarios, the average share of CCS in total 
emissions reductions may range from 15% for scenarios aiming 
Box 8.2 Two illustrative 550 ppmv stabilization scenarios based on IPCC SRES B2
The MESSAGE and MiniCAM scenarios illustrated in Figure 8.4 represent two alternative quantifications of the B2 scenario 
family of the IPCC SRES. They are used for subsequent CO2 mitigation analysis and explore the main measures that would 
lead to the stabilization of atmospheric concentrations at 550 ppmv. 
  The scenarios are based on the B2 storyline, a narrative description of how the world will evolve during the twenty-first 
century, and share harmonized assumptions concerning salient drivers of CO2 emissions, such as economic development, 
demographic change, and final energy demand.
In accordance with the B2 storyline, gross world product is assumed to grow from US$ 20 trillion in 1990 to about US$ 
235 trillion in 2100 in both scenarios, corresponding to a long-term average growth rate of 2.2%. Most of this growth takes 
place in today’s developing countries. The scenarios adopt the UN median 1998 population projection (UN, 1998), which 
assumes a continuation of historical trends, including recent faster-than-expected fertility declines, towards a completion of the 
demographic transition within the next century. Global population increases to about 10 billion by 2100. Final energy intensity 
of the economy declines at about the long-run historical rate of about one per cent per year through 2100. On aggregate, 
these trends constitute ‘dynamics-as-usual’ developments, corresponding to middle-of-the-road assumptions compared to the 
scenario uncertainty range from the literature (Morita and Lee, 1999).
  In addition to the similarities mentioned above, the MiniCAM and MESSAGE scenarios are based on alternative 
interpretations of the B2 storyline with respect to a number of other important assumptions that affect the potential future 
deployment of CCS. These assumptions relate to fossil resource availability, long-term potentials for renewable energy, the 
development of fuel prices, the structure of the energy system and the sectoral breakdown of energy demand, technology costs, 
and in particular technological change (future prospects for costs and performance improvements for specific technologies and 
technology clusters). 
  The two scenarios therefore portray alternative but internally consistent developments of the energy technology portfolio, 
associated CO2 emissions, and the deployment of CCS and other mitigation technologies in response to the stabilization target 
of 550 ppmv CO2, adopting the same assumptions for economic, population, and aggregated demand growth. Comparing the 
scenarios’ portfolio of mitigation options (Figure 8.4) illustrates the importance of CCS as part of the mitigation portfolio. For 
more details, see Dooley et al. (2004b) and Riahi and Roehrl (2000).

at the stabilization of CO2 concentrations at 750 ppmv to 54% 
for 450 ppmv scenarios.13 However, the full uncertainty range 
of the set of TAR mitigation scenarios includes extremes on 
both the high and low sides, ranging from scenarios with zero 
CCS contributions to scenarios with CCS shares of more than 
90% in total emissions abatement.
8.3.3.1 
Cumulative CCS deployment
Top-down and bottom-up energy-economic models have 
been used to examine the likely total deployment of CCS 
technologies (expressed in GtC). These analyses reflect the fact 
that the future usage of CCS technologies is associated with 
large uncertainties. As illustrated by the IPCC-TAR mitigation 
scenarios, global cumulative CCS during the 21st century could 
range – depending on the future characteristics of the reference 
world (i.e., baselines) and the employed stabilization target 
(450 to 750 ppmv) – from zero to more than 5500 GtCO2 (1500 
GtC) (see Figure 8.6). The average cumulative CO2 storage 
(2000–2100) across the six scenario groups shown in Figure 8.6 
ranges from 380 GtCO2 (103 GtC) in the 750 ppmv stabilization 
scenarios to 2160 GtCO2 (590 GtC) in the 450 ppmv scenarios 
(Table 8.5).14    However, it is important to note that the majority 
of the six individual TAR scenarios (from the 20th to the 80th 
percentile) tend to cluster in the range of 220–2200 GtCO2 (60–
600 GtC) for the four stabilization targets (450–750 ppmv).
 
The deployment of CCS in the TAR mitigation scenarios is 
comparable to results from similar scenario studies projecting 
storage of 576–1370 GtCO2 (157–374 GtC) for stabilization 
scenarios that span 450 to 750 ppmv (Edmonds et al., 2000) and 
storage of 370 to 1250 GtCO2 (100 to 340 GtC) for stabilization 
scenarios that span 450 to 650 ppmv (Dooley and Wise, 2003). 
Riahi et al. (2003) project 330–890 GtCO2 (90–243 GtC) of 
stored CO2 over the course of the current century for various 
Figure 8.5 Relationship between (1) the imputed share of CCS in total cumulative emissions reductions in per cent and (2) total cumulative CCS 
deployment in GtCO2 (2000–2100). The scatter plots depict values for individual TAR mitigation scenarios for the six SRES scenario groups. 
The vertical dashed lines show the average share of CCS in total emissions mitigation across the 450 to 750 ppmv stabilization scenarios, and the 
dashed horizontal lines illustrate the scenarios’ average cumulative storage requirements across 450 to 750 ppmv stabilization.
14 Note that Table 8.5 and Figure 8.6 show average values of CCS across 
alternative modelling frameworks used for the development of the TAR 
mitigation scenarios. The deployment of CCS over time, as well as cumulative 
CO2 storage in individual TAR mitigation scenarios, are illustrated in Figures 
8.5 and 8.7.
13 The range for CCS mitigation in the TAR mitigation scenarios is calculated 
on the basis of the cumulative emissions reductions from 1990 to 2100, and 
represents the average contribution for 450 and 750 ppmv scenarios across 
alternative modelling frameworks and SRES baseline scenarios. The full range 
across all scenarios for 450 ppmv is 20 to 95% and 0 to 68% for 750 ppmv 
scenarios respectively. 
Chapter 8: Cost and economic potential
355
550 ppmv stabilization cases. Fujii and Yamaji (1998) have 
also included ocean storage as an option. They calculate that, 
for a stabilization level of 550 ppmv, 920 GtCO2 (250 GtC) of 
the emissions reductions could be provided by the use of CCS 
technologies and that approximately one-third of this could be 
stored in the ocean. This demand for CO2 storage appears to be 
within global estimates of total CO2 storage capacity presented 
in Chapters 5 and 6.
8.3.3.2 
Timing and deployment rate
Recently, two detailed studies of the cost of CO2 transport and 
storage costs have been completed for North America (Dooley 
et al., 2004a) and Western Europe (Wildenborg et al., 2004). 
These studies concur about the large potential of CO2 storage 
capacity in both regions. Well over 80% of the emissions from 
current CO2 point sources could be transported and stored in 
candidate geologic formations for less than 12–15 US$/tCO2 
in North America and 25 US$/tCO2 in Western Europe. These 
studies are the first to define at a continental scale a ‘CO2 
storage supply curve’, conducting a spatially detailed analysis 
in order to explore the relationship between the price of CO2 
transport and storage and the cumulative amount of CO2 stored. 
Both studies conclude that, at least for these two regions, the 
CO2 storage supply curves are dominated by a very large single 
plateau (hundreds to thousands of gigatonnes of CO2), implying 
roughly constant costs for a wide range of storage capacity15. 
In other words, at a practical level, the cost of CO2 transport 
and storage in these regions will have a cap. These studies and a 
handful of others (see, for example, IEA GHG, 2002) have also 
shown that early (i.e., low cost) opportunities for CO2 capture 
and storage hinge upon a number of factors: an inexpensive 
(e.g., high-purity) source of CO2; a (potentially) active area of 
advanced hydrocarbon recovery (either EOR or ECBM); and 
the relatively close proximity of the CO2 point source to the 
candidate storage reservoir in order to minimize transportation 
costs. These bottom-up studies provide some of the most 
detailed insights into the graded CCS resources presently 
available, showing that the set of CCS opportunities likely to be 
encountered in the real world will be very heterogeneous. These

of the stabilization target and differs considerably across the SRES scenario groups.

capacity.

studies, as well as those based upon more top-down modelling 
approaches, also indicate that, once the full cost of the complete 
CCS system has been accounted for, CCS systems are unlikely 
to deploy on a large scale in the absence of an explicit policy 
or regulatory regime that substantially limits greenhouse gas 
emissions to the atmosphere. The literature and current industrial 
experience indicate that, in the absence of measures to limit 
CO2 emissions, there are only small, niche opportunities for 
the deployment of CCS technologies. These early opportunities 
could provide experience with CCS deployment, including the 
creation of parts of the infrastructure and the knowledge base 
needed for the future large-scale deployment of CCS systems.
 
Most analyses of least-cost CO2 stabilization scenarios 
indicate that, while there is significant penetration of CCS 
systems over the decades to come, the majority of CCS 
deployment will occur in the second half of this century 
(Edmonds et al., 2000, 2003; Edmonds and Wise, 1998; Riahi 
et al., 2003). One of the main reasons for this trend is that the 
stabilization of CO2 concentrations at relatively low levels 
(<650 ppmv) generally leads to progressively more constraining 
mitigation regimes over time, resulting in carbon permit prices 
that start out quite low and steadily rise over the course of this 
century. The TAR mitigation scenarios (Morita et al., 2000) 
based upon the SRES baselines report cumulative CO2 storage 
due to CCS ranging from zero to 1100 GtCO2 (300 GtC) for 
the first half of the century, with the majority of the scenarios 
clustering below 185 GtCO2 (50 GtC). By comparison, the 
cumulative contributions of CCS range from zero to 4770 
GtCO2 (1300 GtC) in the second half of the century, with the 
majority of the scenarios stating figures below 1470 GtCO2 (400 
GtC). The deployment of CCS over time in the TAR mitigation 
scenarios is illustrated in Figure 8.7. As can be seen, the use

the four SRES regions are shown for four alternative stabilization targets (450, 550, 650, and 750 ppmv) and six SRES scenario groups. Values

of CCS is highly dependent upon the underlying base case.  
For example, in the high economic growth and carbon-intensive 
baseline scenarios (A1FI), the development path of CCS is 
characterized by steadily increasing contributions, driven by 
the rapidly growing use of hydrocarbon resources. By contrast, 
other scenarios (e.g., A1B and B2) depict CCS deployment 
to peak during the second half of the century. In a number of 
these scenarios, the contribution of CCS declines to less than 
11 GtCO2 per year (3 GtC per year) until the end of the century. 
These scenarios reflect the fact that CCS could be viewed as 
a transitional mitigation option (bridging the transition from 
today’s fossil-intensive energy system to a post-fossil system 
with sizable contributions from renewables). 
 
Given these models’ relatively coarse top-down view of the 
world, there is less agreement about when the first commercial 
CCS units will become operational. This is – at least in part 
– attributable to the importance of policy in creating the context 
in which initial units will deploy. For example, McFarland et al. 
(2003) foresee CCS deployment beginning around 2035. Other 
modelling exercises have shown CCS systems beginning to 
deploy – at a lower level of less than 370 MtCO2 a year (100 MtC 
a year) – in the period 2005–2020 (see, for example, Dooley et 
al., 2000). Moreover, in an examination of CCS deployment in 
Japan, Akimoto et al. (2003) show CCS deployment beginning 
in 2010–2020. In a large body of literature (Edmonds et al. 
2003; Dooley and Wise, 2003; Riahi et al. 2003; IEA, 2004), 
there is agreement that, in a CO2-constrained world, CCS 
systems might begin to deploy in the next few decades and 
that this deployment will expand significantly after the middle 
of the century. The variation in the estimates of the timing of 
CCS-system deployment is attributable to the different ways 
energy and economic models parameterize CCS systems and to 
the extent to which the potential for early opportunities – such 
as EOR or ECBM – is taken into account. Other factors that 
influence the timing of CCS diffusion are the rate of increase 
and absolute level of the carbon price. 
8.3.3.3 
Geographic distribution
McFarland et al. (2003) foresee the eventual deployment of 
CCS technologies throughout the world but note that the timing 
of the entry of CCS technologies into a particular region is 
influenced by local conditions such as the relative price of coal 
and natural gas in a region. Dooley et al. (2002) show that the 
policy regime, and in particular the extent of emissions trading, 
can influence where CCS technologies are deployed. In the 
specific case examined by this paper, it was demonstrated that, 
where emissions trading was severely constrained (and where 
the cost of abatement was therefore higher), CCS technologies 
tended to deploy more quickly and more extensively in the US 
and the EU. On the other hand, in the absence of an efficient 
emissions-trading system spanning all of the Annex B nations, 
CCS was used less intensively and CCS utilization was spread 
more evenly across these nations as the EU and US found it 
cheaper to buy CCS-derived emission allowances from regions 
like the former Soviet Union. 
 
Table 8.5 gives the corresponding deployment of CCS in 
the IPCC TAR mitigation scenarios for four world regions.
All values are given as averages across scenario results from 
different modelling teams. The data in this table (in particular 
the far left-hand column which summarizes average CO2 
storage across all scenarios) help to demonstrate a common 
and consistent finding of the literature: over the course of this 
century, CCS will deploy throughout the world, most extensively 
in the developing nations of today (tomorrow’s largest emitters 
of CO2). These nations will therefore be likely candidates for 
adopting CCS to control their growing emissions.16
 
Fujii et al. (2002) note that the actual deployment of CCS 
technologies in any given region will depend upon a host of 
geological and geographical conditions that are, at present, 
poorly represented in top-down energy and economic models. 
In an attempt to address the shortcomings noted by Fujii et al. 
(2002) and others, especially in the way in which the cost of CO2 
transport and storage are parameterized in top-down models, 
Dooley et al. (2004b) employed graded CO2 storage supply 
curves for all regions of the world based upon a preliminary 
assessment of the literature’s estimate of regional CO2 storage 
Figure 8.7 Deployment of CCS systems as a function of time from 
1990 to 2100 in the IPCC TAR mitigation scenarios where atmospheric 
CO2 concentrations stabilize at between 450 to 750 ppmv. Coloured 
thick lines show the minimum and maximum contribution of CCS for 
each SRES scenario group, and thin lines depict the contributions in 
individual scenarios. Vertical axes on the right-hand side illustrate the 
range of CCS deployment across the stabilization levels for each SRES 
scenario group in the year 2100.
16 This trend can be seen particularly clearly in the far left-hand column of Table 
8.5, which gives the average CCS deployment across all scenarios from the 
various models. Note, nevertheless, a few scenarios belonging to the B1 and 
B2 scenario family, which suggest larger levels of deployment for CCS in the 
developed world.

IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
capacity. In this framework, where the cost of CO2 storage varies 
across the globe depending upon the quantity, quality (including 
proximity) and type of CO2 storage reservoirs present in the 
region, as well as upon the demand for CO2 storage (driven by 
factors such as the size of the regional economy, the stringency 
of the modelled emissions reduction regime), the authors show 
that the use of CCS across the globe can be grouped into three 
broad categories: (1) countries in which the use of CCS does 
not appear to face either an economic or physical constraint on 
CCS deployment given the large potential CO2 storage resource 
compared to projected demand (e.g., Australia, Canada, and the 
United States) and where CCS should therefore deploy to the 
extent that it makes economic sense to do so; (2) countries in 
which the supply of potential geological storage reservoirs (the 
authors did not consider ocean storage) is small in comparison 
to potential demand (e.g., Japan and South Korea) and where 
other abatement options must therefore be pressed into service 
to meet the modelled emissions reduction levels; and (3) the 
rest of the world in which the degree to which CCS deployment 
is constrained is contingent upon the stringency of the emission 
constraint and the useable CO2 storage resource. The authors 
note that discovering the true CO2 storage potential in regions 
of the world is a pressing issue; knowing whether a country or a 
region has ‘sufficient’ CO2 storage capacity is a critical variable 
in these modelling analyses because it can fundamentally alter 
the way in which a country’s energy infrastructure evolves in 
response to various modelled emissions constraints.
8.3.3.4 
Long-term economic impact
An increasing body of literature has been analyzing short- and 
long-term financial requirements for CCS. The World Energy 
Investment Outlook 2003 (IEA, 2003) estimates an upper limit 
for investment in CCS technologies for the OECD of about 
US$ 350 to 440 billion over the next 30 years, assuming that 
all new power plant installations will be equipped with CCS. 
Similarly, Riahi et al. (2004) estimate that up-front investments 
for initial niche market applications and demonstration plants 
could amount to about US$ 70 billion or 0.2% of the total 
global energy systems costs over the next 20 years. This would 
correspond to a market share of CCS of about 3.5% of total 
installed fossil-power generation capacities in the OECD 
countries by 2020, where most of the initial CCS capacities are 
expected to be installed. 
 
Long-term investment requirements for the full integration 
of CCS in the electricity sector as a whole are subject to major 
uncertainties. Analyses with integrated assessment models 
indicate that the costs of decarbonizing the electricity sector 
via CCS might be about three to four per cent of total energy-
related systems costs over the course of the century (Riahi et al., 
2004). Most importantly, these models also point out that the 
opportunity costs of CCS not being part of the CO2 mitigation 
portfolio would be significant. Edmonds et al. (2000) indicate 
that savings over the course of this century associated with the 
wide-scale deployment of CCS technologies when compared 
to a scenario in which these technologies do not exist could 
be in the range of tens of billions of 1990 US dollars for high 
CO2 concentrations limits such as 750 ppmv, to trillions of 
dollars for more stringent CO2 concentrations such as 450 ppm 
17. Dooley et al. (2002) estimate cost savings in excess of 36% 
and McFarland et al. (2004) a reduction in the carbon permit 
price by 110 US$/tCO2 in scenarios where CCS technologies 
are allowed to deploy when compared to scenarios in which 
they are not.
8.3.3.5 
Interaction with other technologies
As noted above, the future deployment of CCS will depend on 
a number of factors, many of which interact with each other. 
The deployment of CCS will be impacted by factors such as 
the development and deployment of renewable energy and 
nuclear power (Mori, 2000). Edmonds et al. (2003) report 
that CCS technologies can synergistically interact with other 
technologies and in doing so help to lower the cost and therefore 
increase the overall economic potential of less carbon-intensive 
technologies. The same authors note that these synergies are 
perhaps particularly important for the combination of CCS, 
H2 production technologies and H2 end-use systems (e.g., 
fuel cells). On the other hand, the widespread availability of 
CCS technologies implies an ability to meet a given emissions 
reduction at a lower marginal cost, reducing demand for 
substitute technologies at the margin. In other words, CCS is 
competing with some technologies, such as energy-intensity 
improvements, nuclear, fusion, solar power options, and wind. 
The nature of that interaction depends strongly on the climate 
policy environment and the costs and potential of alternative 
mitigation options, which are subject to large variations 
depending on site-specific, local conditions (IPCC, 2001). 
At the global level, which is spatially more aggregated, this 
variation translates into the parallel deployment of alternative 
options, taking into account the importance of a diversified 
technology portfolio for addressing emissions mitigation in a 
cost-effective way.
 
An increasing body of literature (Willams, 1998; Obersteiner 
et al., 2001; Rhodes and Keith, 2003; Makihira et al., 2003; 
Edmonds et al., 2003, Möllersten et al., 2003) has begun to 
examine the use of CCS systems with biomass-fed energy 
systems to create useful energy (electricity or transportation 
fuels) as well as excess emissions credits generated by the 
system’s resulting ‘negative emissions’. These systems can 
be fuelled solely by biomass, or biomass can be co-fired in 
conventional coal-burning plants, in which case the quantity 
is normally limited to about 10–15% of the energy input. 
Obersteiner et al. (2001) performed an analysis based on the 
SRES scenarios, estimating that 880 to 1650 GtCO2 (240 
to 450 GtC) of the scenario’s cumulative emissions that are 
vented during biomass-based energy-conversion processes 
could potentially be available for capture and storage over the 
course of the century. Rhodes and Keith (2003) note that, while 
this coupled bio-energy CCS system would generate expensive

contrast to a world where CCS is not considered to be part of the mitigation 
portfolio.

electricity in a world of low carbon prices, this system could 
produce competitively priced electricity in a world with carbon 
prices in excess of 54.5 US$/tCO2 (200 US$/tC). Similarly, 
Makihira et al. (2003) estimate that CO2 capture during hydrogen 
production from biomass could become competitive at carbon 
prices above 54.5 to 109 US$/tCO2 (200 to 400 US$/tC). 
8.4 
Economic impacts of different storage times
As discussed in the relevant chapters, geological and ocean 
storage might not provide permanent storage for all of the CO2 
injected. The question arises of how the possibility of leakage 
from reservoirs can be taken into account in the evaluation of 
different storage options and in the comparison of CO2 storage 
with mitigation options in which CO2 emissions are avoided. 
 
Chapters 5 and 6 discuss the expected fractions of CO2 retained 
in storage for geological and ocean reservoirs respectively. For 
example, Box 6.7 suggests four types of measures for ocean 
storage: storage efficiency, airborne fraction, net present value, 
and global warming potential. Chapter 9 discusses accounting 
issues relating to the possible impermanence of stored CO2. 
Chapter 9 also contains a review of the broader literature on the 
value of delayed emissions, primarily focusing on sequestration 
in the terrestrial biosphere. In this section, we focus specifically 
on the economic impacts of differing storage times in geological 
and ocean reservoirs. 
 
Herzog et al. (2003) suggest that CO2 storage and leakage 
can be looked upon as two separate, discrete events. They 
represent the value of temporary storage as a familiar economic 
problem, with explicitly stated assumptions about the discount 
rate and carbon prices. If someone stores a tonne of CO2 today, 
they will be credited with today’s carbon price. Any future 
leakage will have to be compensated by paying the carbon price 
in effect at that time. Whether non-permanent storage options 
will be economically attractive depends on assumptions about 
the leakage rate, discount rate and relative carbon permit prices. 
In practice, this may turn out to be a difficult issue since the 
commercial entity that undertakes the storage may no longer 
exist when leakage rates have been clarified (as Baer (2003) 
points out), and hence governments or society at large might 
need to cover the leakage risk of many storage sites rather than 
the entity that undertakes the storage.
 
Ha-Duong and Keith (2003) explore the trade-offs 
between discounting, leakage, the cost of CO2 storage and the 
energy penalty. They use both an analytical approach and an 
integrated assessment numerical model in their assessment. In 
the latter case, with CCS modelled as a backstop technology, 
they find that, for an optimal mix of CO2 abatement and CCS 
technologies, ‘an (annual) leakage rate of 0.1% is nearly the 
same as perfect storage while a leakage rate of 0.5% renders 
storage unattractive’. 
 
Some fundamental points about the limitations of the 
economic valuation approaches presented in the literature have 
been raised by Baer (2003). He argues that financial efficiency, 
which is at the heart of the economic approaches to the valuation 
of, and decisions about, non-permanent storage is only one of a 
number of important criteria to be considered. Baer points out 
that at least three risk categories should to be taken into account 
as well:
•� ecological risk: the possibility that ‘optimal’ leakage may 
preclude future climate stabilization;
•� financial risk: the possibility that future conditions will 
cause carbon prices to greatly exceed current expectations, 
with consequences for the maintenance of liability and 
distribution of costs; and
•� political risk: the possibility that institutions with an interest 
in CO2 storage may manipulate the regulatory environment 
in their favour.
As these points have not been extensively discussed in the 
literature so far, the further development of the scientific debate 
on these issues must be followed closely. 
 
In summary, within this purely economic framework, the 
few studies that have looked at this topic indicate that some 
CO2 leakage can be accommodated while still making progress 
towards the goal of stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of 
CO2. However, due to the uncertainties of the assumptions, the 
impact of different leakage rates and therefore the impact of 
different storage times are hard to quantify.
8.5 
Gaps in knowledge
Cost developments for CCS technologies are now estimated 
based on literature, expert views and a few recent CCS 
deployments. Costs of large-scale integrated CCS applications 
are still uncertain and their variability depends among other 
things on many site-specific conditions. Especially in the case 
of large-scale CCS biomass based applications, there is a lack 
of experience and therefore little information in the literature 
about the costs of these systems. 
 
There is little empirical evidence about possible cost 
decreases related to ‘learning by doing’ for integrated CCS 
systems since the demonstration and commercial deployment of 
these systems has only recently begun. Furthermore, the impact 
of targeted research, development and deployment (RD&D) of 
CCS investments on the level and rate of CCS deployment is 
poorly understood at this time. This lack of knowledge about 
how technologies will deploy in the future and the impact of 
RD&D on the technology’s deployment is a generic issue and 
is not specific to CCS deployment.
 
In addition to current and future CCS technological costs, 
there are other possible issues that are not well known at this 
point and that would affect the future deployment of CCS 
systems: for example, costs related to the monitoring and 
regulatory framework, possible environmental damage costs, 
costs associated with liability and possible public-acceptance 
issues. 
 
There are at present no known, full assessments of life-cycle 
costs for deployed CCS systems, and in particular the economic 
impact of the capture, transport and storage of non-pure CO2 
streams.
 
The development of bottom-up CCS deployment cost 
360
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
curves that take into account the interplay between large CO2 
point sources and available storage capacity in various regions 
of the world should continue; these cost curves would help to 
show how CCS technologies will deploy in practice and would 
also help improve the economic modelling of CCS deployment 
in response to various modelled scenarios.
 
Recent changes in energy prices and changes in policy 
regimes related to climate change are not fully reflected in 
the literature available as this chapter was being written. This 
suggests a need for a continuous effort to update analyses 
and perhaps draft a range of scenarios with a wider range of 
assumptions (e.g., fuel prices, climate policies) in order to 
understand better the robustness and sensitivity of the current 
outcomes.

ExECutIvE SummARy
This chapter addresses how methodologies to estimate and 
report reduced or avoided greenhouse gas emissions from the 
main options for CO2 capture and storage (CCS) systems could 
be included in national greenhouse gas inventories, and in 
accounting schemes such as the Kyoto Protocol. 
 
The IPCC Guidelines and Good Practice Guidance reports 
(GPG2000 and GPG-LULUCF) 1are used in preparing national 
inventories under the UNFCCC. These guidelines do not 
specifically address CO2 capture and storage, but the general 
framework and concepts could be applied for this purpose. The 
IPCC guidelines give guidance for reporting on annual emissions 
by gas and by sector. The amount of CO2 captured and stored 
can be measured, and could be reflected in the relevant sectors 
and categories producing the emissions, or in new categories 
created specifically for CO2 capture, transportation and storage 
in the reporting framework. In the first option, CCS would be 
treated as a mitigation measure and, for example, power plants 
with CO2 capture or use of decarbonized fuels would have 
lower emissions factors (kgCO2/kg fuel used) than conventional 
systems. In the second option, the captured and stored amounts 
would be reported as removals (sinks) for CO2. In both options, 
emissions from fossil fuel use due to the additional energy 
requirements in the capture, transportation and injection 
processes would be covered by current methodologies. But 
under the current framework, they would not be allocated to the 
CCS system. 
 
Methodologies to estimate, monitor and report physical 
leakage from storage options would need to be developed. 
Some additional guidance specific to the systems would need 
to be given for fugitive emissions from capture, transportation 
and injection processes. Conceptually, a similar scheme could 
be used for mineral carbonation and industrial use of CO2. 
However, detailed methodologies would need to be developed 
for the specific processes. 
 
Quantified commitments, emission trading or other similar 
mechanisms need clear rules and methodologies for accounting 
for emissions and removals. There are several challenges for 
the accounting frameworks. Firstly, there is a lack of knowledge 
about the rate of physical leakage from different storage options 
including possibilities for accidental releases over a very long 
time period (issues of permanence and liability). Secondly, there 
are the implications of the additional energy requirements of the 
options; and the issues of liability and economic leakage where 
CO2 capture and storage crosses the traditional accounting 
boundaries.
1 Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
(IPCC 1997) – abbreviated as IPCC Guidelines in this chapter; IPCC Good 
Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse 
Gas Inventories (IPCC 2000) – abbreviated as GPG2000; and IPCC Good 
Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry ( IPCC 2003) 
– abbreviated as GPG-LULUCF.
The literature on accounting for the potential impermanence of 
stored CO2 focuses on sequestration in the terrestrial biosphere. 
Although notably different from CCS in oceans or in geological 
reservoirs (with respect to ownership, the role of management, 
measurement and monitoring, expected rate of physical 
leakage; modes of potential physical leakage; and assignment 
of liability), there are similarities. Accounting approaches, such 
as discounting, the ton-year approach, and rented or temporary 
credits, are discussed. Ultimately, political processes will decide 
the value of temporary storage and allocation of responsibility 
for stored carbon. Precedents set by international agreements 
on sequestration in the terrestrial biosphere provide some 
guidance, but there are important differences that will have to 
be considered.
9.1  
Introduction
CO2 capture and storage (CCS) can take a variety of forms. 
This chapter discusses how the main CCS systems as well 
as mineral carbonation and industrial uses of CO2, described 
in the previous chapters could be incorporated into national 
greenhouse gas inventories and accounting schemes. However, 
inventory or accounting issues specific to enhanced oil recovery 
or enhanced coal bed methane are not addressed here.
 
The inclusion of CCS systems in national greenhouse 
gas inventories is discussed in Section 9.2 (Greenhouse gas 
inventories). The section gives an overview of the existing 
framework, the main concepts and methodologies used in 
preparing and reporting national greenhouse gas emissions 
and removals with the aim of identifying inventory categories 
for reporting CCS systems. In addition, areas are identified 
where existing methodologies could be used to include these 
systems in the inventories, and areas where new methodologies 
(including emission/removal factors and uncertainty estimates) 
would need to be developed. Treatment of CCS in corporate or 
company reporting is beyond the scope of the chapter.
 
Issues related to accounting2 under the Kyoto Protocol; 
or under other similar accounting schemes that would limit 
emissions, provide credits for emission reductions, or encourage 
emissions trading; are addressed in Section 9.3 (Accounting 
issues). The section addresses issues that could warrant special 
rules and modalities in accounting schemes because of specific 
features of CCS systems, such as permanence of CO2 storage 
and liability issues related to transportation and storage in 
international territories and across national borders. Specific 
consideration is also given to CCS systems in relation to the 
mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol (Emission Trading, Joint 
Implementation and the Clean Development Mechanism). 
2 ‘Accounting’ refers to the rules for comparing emissions and removals as 
reported with commitments. In this context, ‘estimation’ is the process of 
calculating greenhouse gas emissions and removals, and ‘reporting’ is the 
process of providing the estimates to the UNFCCC (IPCC 2003).

9.2  
National greenhouse gas inventories
Information on pollutant emissions is usually compiled in 
‘emission inventories’. Emissions are listed according to 
categories such as pollutants, sectors, and source and compiled 
per geographic area and time interval. Many different emission 
inventories have been prepared for different purposes. Among 
the commitments in the United Nations Framework Convention 
on Climate Change (UNFCCC, 1992) all Parties, taking into 
account their common but differentiated responsibilities, and 
their specific national and regional development priorities, 
objectives and circumstances, shall: ‘Develop, periodically 
update, publish and make available to the Conference of the 
Parties, national inventories of anthropogenic emissions 
by sources and removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases 
not controlled by the Montreal Protocol, using comparable 
methodologies to be agreed upon by the Conference of the 
Parties’.3
 
Industrialized countries (Annex I Parties) are required 
to report annually and developing countries (non-Annex I 
Parties) to report on greenhouse gas emissions and removals 
to the Convention periodically, as part of their National 
Communications to the UNFCCC. National greenhouse 
gas inventories are prepared using the methodologies in the 
IPCC Guidelines as complemented by the GPG2000 and 
GPGLULUCF, or methodologies consistent with these. These 
inventories should include all anthropogenic greenhouse gas 
emissions by sources and removals by sinks not covered by 
the Montreal Protocol. To ensure high quality and accuracy, 
inventories by Annex I Parties are reviewed by expert review 
teams coordinated by the UNFCCC Secretariat. The review 
reports are published on the UNFCCC website4.
 
The rules and modalities for accounting are elaborated 
under the Kyoto Protocol (UNFCCC, 1997) and the Marrakech 
Accords5 (UNFCCC, 2002). The Kyoto Protocol specifies 
emission limitation or reduction commitments by the Annex I 
Parties for six gases/gas groups: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane 
(CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), 
perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6). 
  
At present, CCS is practiced on a very small scale. CCS 
projects have not generally been described in the national 
inventory reports of the countries where they take place. An 
exception is the Sleipner CCS project, which is included in 
Norway’s inventory report.6 Norway provides information 
on the annual captured and stored amounts, as well as on 
the amounts of CO2 that escape to the atmosphere during the 
injection process (amounts have varied from negligible to about 
0.8% of the captured amount). The escaping CO2 emissions are

Framework Convention of Climate Change (UNFCCC).

included in the total emissions of Norway. The spread of the CO2 
in the storage reservoir has been monitored by seismic methods. 
No physical leakage has been detected. An uncertainty estimate 
has not been performed but it is expected to be done when 
more information is available from the project’s monitoring 
programme.
 
The scarce reporting of current CCS projects is due largely 
to the small number and size of industrial CCS projects in 
operation, as well as to the lack of clarity in the reporting 
methodologies. 
9.2.1 
Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines and IPCC Good 
Practice Guidance
The reporting guidelines under the UNFCCC7, and under the 
Kyoto Protocol as specified in the Marrakech Accords require 
Annex I Parties to use the IPCC Guidelines1, as elaborated by 
the GPG20001, in estimating and reporting national greenhouse 
gas inventories. The use of the GPG-LULUCF1 will start in 
2005 with a one-year trial period8. Non-Annex I Parties also use 
the IPCC Guidelines in their reporting, and use of GPG2000 
and GPG-LULUCF reports is encouraged.9 The main reporting 
framework (temporal, spatial and sectoral) and the guiding 
principles of the IPCC Guidelines and good practice guidance 
reports are given in Box 9.1.
 
The IPCC Guidelines will be revised and updated by early 
200610. In the draft outline for the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for 
National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, CCS is mentioned in 
a footnote in the Energy Sector: ‘It is recognized that CO2 
capture and storage is an important emerging issue in inventory 
development. The coverage of CO2 storage in this report will 
be closely coordinated with progress on IPCC SR on CO2 
capture and storage. CO2 capture activities will be integrated 
as appropriate into the methods presented for source categories 
where it may occur.’
9.2.2 
Methodological framework for CO2 capture 
and storage systems in national greenhouse gas 
inventories
The two main options for including CCS in national  greenhouse 
gas inventories have been identified and analysed using the 
current methodological framework for total chain from capture 
to storage (geological and ocean storage). These options are: 
• 
 Source reduction: To evaluate the CCS systems as mitigation 
options to reduce emissions to the atmosphere;

communications by Parties included in Annex I to the Convention, part I:

The IPCC methodologies for estimating and reporting national greenhouse gas inventories are based on sectoral guidance for 
reporting of actual emissions and removals of greenhouse gases by gas and by year. The IPCC Guidelines give the framework 
for the reporting (sectors, categories and sub-categories), default methodologies and default emission/removal factors (the 
so called Tier 1 methodologies) for the estimation. Higher tier methodologies are based on more sophisticated methods for 
estimating emissions/removals and on the use of national or regional parameters that accommodate the specific national 
circumstances. These methodologies are not always described in detail in the IPCC Guidelines. Use of transparent and well-
documented national methodologies consistent with those in the IPCC Guidelines is encouraged. 
 The Good Practice Guidance (GPG) reports facilitate the development of inventories in which the emissions/removals are not 
over- or under-estimated, so far as can be judged, and in which the uncertainties are reduced as far as practicable. Further aims 
are to produce transparent, documented, consistent, complete, comparable inventories, which are i) assessed for uncertainties, 
ii) subject to quality assurance and quality control, and iii) efficient in the use of resources. The GPG reports give guidance on 
how to choose the appropriate methodologies for specific categories in a country, depending on the importance of the category 
(key category analysis is used to determine the importance) and on availability of data and resources for the estimation. 
Decision trees guide the choice of estimation method most suited to the national circumstances. The category-specific guidance 
linked to the decision trees also provides information on the choice of emission factors and activity data. The GPG reports give 
guidance on how to meet the requirements of transparency, consistency, completeness, comparability, and accuracy required 
by the national greenhouse gas inventories.
 The Sectors covered in the IPCC Guidelines are: (i) Energy, (ii) Industrial Processes, (iii) Solvent and Other Product Use, 
(iv) Agriculture, (v) Land Use Change and Forestry, (vi) Waste and (vii) Other. The use of the seventh sector ‘Other’ is 
discouraged: ‘Efforts should be made to fit all emission sources/sinks into the six categories described above. If it is impossible 
to do so, however, this category can be used, accompanied by a detailed explanation of the source/sink activity’’ (IPCC 
1997).
Box 9.1 Main reporting framework (temporal, spatial and sectoral) and guiding principles of the IPCC Guidelines and good practice guidance 
reports.
• 
Sink enhancement: To evaluate the CCS systems using an 
analogy with the treatment made to CO2 removals by sinks 
in the sector Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry. 
A balance is made of the CO2 emissions and removals to 
obtain the net emission or removal. In this option, removals 
by sinks are related to CO2 storage.
In both options, estimation methodologies could be developed to 
cover most of the emissions in the CCS system (see Figure 9.1), 
and reporting could use the current framework for preparation 
of national greenhouse gas inventories. 
 
In the first option, reduced emissions could be reported in 
the category where capture takes place. For instance, capture 
in power plants could be reported using lower emission factors 
than for plants without CCS. But this could reduce transparency 
of reporting and make review of the overall impact on emissions 
more difficult, especially if the capture process and emissions 
from transportation and storage are not linked. This would be 
emphasized where transportation and storage includes captured 
CO2 from many sources, or when these take place across national 
borders. An alternative would be to track CO2 flows through the 
entire capture and storage system making transparent how much 
CO2 was produced, how much was emitted to the atmosphere 
at each process stage, and how much CO2 was transferred to 
storage. This latter approach, which appears fully transparent 
and consistent with earlier UNFCCC agreements, is described 
in this chapter.
 
The second option is to report the impact of the CCS system 
as a sink. For instance, reporting of capture in power plants 
would not alter the emissions from the combustion process but 
the stored amount of CO2 would be reported as a removal in 
the inventory. Application of the second option would require 
adoption of new definitions not available in the UNFCCC or 
in the current methodological framework for the preparation 
of inventories. UNFCCC (1992) defines a sink as ‘any 
process, activity or mechanism which removes a greenhouse 
gas, an aerosol, or a precursor of a greenhouse gas from the 
atmosphere’. Although ‘removal’ was not included explicitly in 
the UNFCCC definitions, it appears associated with the ‘sink’ 
concept. CCS11 systems do not meet the UNFCCC definition for 
a sink, but given that the definition was agreed without having 
CCS systems in mind, it is likely that this obstacle could be 
solved (Torvanger et al., 2005). 
 
General issues of relevance to CCS systems include system 
boundaries (sectoral, spatial and temporal) and these will vary 
in importance with the specific system and phases of the system. 
The basic methodological approaches for system components, 
together with the status of the methods and availability of 
data for these are discussed below. Mineral carbonation and 
industrial use of CO2 are addressed separately.
• 
Sectoral boundaries: The draft outline for the 2006 IPCC 
Guidelines (see Section 9.2.1) states that: ‘CO2 capture 
activities will be integrated as appropriate into the methods 
presented for source/sink categories where they may 
11 Few cases are nearer to the ‘sink’ definition. For example, mineralization 
can also include fixation from the atmosphere.

occur’. This approach is followed here when addressing the 
sectors under which the specific phases of the CCS systems 
could be reported. The reporting of emissions/removals 
associated with CO2 capture, transportation, injection and 
storage processes should be described clearly to fulfil the 
requirement of transparent reporting.
• 
Spatial boundaries: National inventories include greenhouse 
gas emissions and removals taking place within national 
(including administered) territories and offshore areas over 
which that country has jurisdiction. Some of the emissions 
and removals of CCS systems could occur outside the areas 
under the jurisdiction of the reporting country, an aspect that 
requires additional consideration and is addressed mainly in 
Section 9.3.
• 
Temporal boundaries: Inventories are prepared on a 
calendar year basis. Some aspects of CCS systems (such 
as the amount of CO2 captured or fugitive emissions from 
transportation) could easily be incorporated into an annual 
reporting system (yearly estimates would be required). 
However, other emissions (for example, physical leakage 
of CO2 from geological storage) can occur over a very long 
period after the injection has been completed - time frames 
range from hundreds to even millions of years (see further 
discussion in Section 9.3).
Table 9.1 lists potential sources and emissions of greenhouse 
gases in the different phases of a CCS system and their 
relationship with the framework for the reporting (sectors, 
categories and sub-categories) of the IPCC Guidelines. The 
relative importance of these potential sources for the national 
greenhouse inventory can vary from one CCS project to 
another, depending on factors such as capture technologies 
and storage site characteristics. Emissions from some of these 
sources are probably very small, sometimes even insignificant, 
but to guarantee an appropriate completeness12 of the national 
inventory, it is necessary to evaluate their contribution.
 
Some important considerations relative to the source 
categories and emissions included in Table 9.1 are the 
following:
• 
Capture, transportation and injection of CO2 into storage 
requires energy (the additional energy requirements have been 
addressed in previous chapters). Greenhouse gas emissions 
from this energy use are covered by the methodologies and 
reporting framework in the IPCC Guidelines and GPG2000. 
Additional methodologies and emission factors can be 
found in other extensive literature, such as EEA (2001) and 
US EPA (1995, 2000). Where capture processes take place 
at the fuel production site, the emissions from the fuel used 
in the capture process may not be included in the national 
statistics. Additional methods to cover emissions from this 
source may be needed. In the current reporting framework, 
emissions from the additional energy requirements would 
not be linked to the CCS system.
• 
Fugitive emissions from CCS systems can occur during 
capture, compression, liquefaction, transportation and 
injection of CO2 to the storage reservoir. A general 
framework for estimation of fugitive emissions is included 
in the IPCC Guidelines in the Energy sector. The estimation 
and reporting of fugitive emissions from CCS need further 
12 Completeness means that an inventory covers all sources and sinks, as well 
as all gases included in the IPCC Guidelines and also other existing relevant 
source/sink categories specific to individual Parties, and therefore may not be 
included in the IPCC Guidelines. Completeness also means full geographic 
coverage of sources and sinks of a Party (FCCC/CP/1999/7).

b)  Emissions from transportation include both GHG emissions from fossil fuel use and fugitive emissions of CO2 from pipelines and other equipment/processes. 
Besides ships and pipelines, limited quantities of CO2 could be transported by railway or by trucks, source categories identified in the IPCC Guidelines/
GPG2000.
c)  Long-term physical leakage of stored CO2 is not covered by the existing framework for reporting of emissions in the IPCC Guidelines. Different potential 
options exist to report these emissions in the inventories (for example, in the relevant sectors/categories producing the emissions, creating a separate and new 
category for the capture, transportation and/or storage industry). No conclusion can yet be made on the most appropriate reporting option taking into account 
the different variants adopted by the CCS systems. 
d)  International Marine (Bunkers). Emissions based on fuel sold to ships engaged in international transport should not be included in national totals but reported 
separately under Memo Items. 
e) National Navigation.
f)  Emissions related to the capture (removal) of CO2 in natural gas processing installations to improve the heating valued of the gas or to meet pipeline specifi-
cations.

fugitive emissions from CCS needs further elaboration of the methodologies.

IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
elaboration in methodologies.
• 
The long-term physical leakage of stored CO2 (escape of 
CO2 from a storage reservoir) is not covered by the existing 
framework for reporting emissions in the IPCC Guidelines. 
Different options exist to report these emissions in the 
inventories (for example, in the relevant sectors/categories 
producing the emissions initially, by creating a separate and 
new category under fugitive emissions, or by creating a 
new category for the capture, transportation and/or storage 
industry). 
• 
Application of CCS to CO2 emissions from biomass 
combustion, and to other CO2 emissions of biological origin 
(for example, fermentation processes in the production 
of food and drinks) would require specific treatment 
in inventories. It is generally assumed that combustion 
of biomass fuels results in zero net CO2 emissions if the 
biomass fuels are produced sustainably. In this case, the 
CO2 released by combustion is balanced by CO2 taken up 
during photosynthesis. In greenhouse gas inventories, CO2 
emissions from biomass combustion are, therefore, not 
reported under Energy. Any unsustainable production should 
be evident in the calculation of CO2 emissions and removals 
in Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry Sector. Thus, 
CCS from biomass sources would be reported as negative 
CO2 emissions.
9.2.2.1 
 Capture
The capture processes are well defined in space and time, and 
their emissions (from additional energy use, fugitives, etc.) 
could be covered by current national and annual inventory 
systems. The capture processes would result in reduced 
emissions from industrial plants, power plants and other sites 
of fuel combustion. For estimation purposes, the reduced CO2 
emissions could be determined by measuring the amount of 
CO2 captured and deducting this from the total amount of CO2 
produced (see Figure 8.2 in Chapter 8).
 
The total amount of CO2, including emissions from the 
additional energy consumption necessary to operate the capture 
process, could be estimated using the methods and guidance 
in the IPCC Guidelines and GPG2000. The capture process 
could produce emissions of other greenhouse gases, such as 
CH4 from treatment of effluents (for example, from amine 
decomposition). These emissions are not included explicitly 
in the IPCC Guidelines and GPG2000. Estimates on the 
significance of these emissions are not available, but are likely 
to be small or negligible compared to the amount of captured 
CO2.
 
Although not all possible CCS systems can be considered 
here, it is clear that some cases would require different 
approaches. For example, pre-combustion decarbonization 
in fuel production units presents some important differences 
compared to the post-combustion methods, and the simple 
estimation process described above might not be applicable. 
For example, the capture of CO2 may take place in a different 
country than the one in which the decarbonized fuel is used. This 
would mean that emissions associated with the capture process 
(possible fugitive CO2 emissions) would need to be estimated 
and reported separately to those resulting from the combustion 
process (see also Section 9.3 on issues relating to accounting 
and allocation of the emissions and emissions reductions).
9.2.2.2 
 Transportation
Most research on CCS systems focuses on the capture and storage 
processes and fugitive emissions from CO2 transportation are 
often overlooked (Gale and Davison, 2002). CO2 transportation 
in pipelines and ships is discussed in Chapter 4. Limited 
quantities of CO2 could also be transported via railway or by 
trucks (Davison et al., 2001). The additional energy required 
for pipeline transport is mostly covered by compression at the 
capture site. Additional compression may be required when 
CO2 is transported very long distances. The emissions from 
fossil fuel in transportation by ships, rail or trucks would be 
covered under the category on mobile combustion and other 
subcategories in the Energy sector. However, according to 
the current IPCC guidelines, emissions from fuels sold to any 
means of international transport should be excluded from the 
national total emissions and be reported separately as emissions 
from international bunkers. These emissions are not included 
in national commitments under the Kyoto Protocol (e.g., IPCC 
1997 and 2000, see also Section 9.3).
 
Any fugitive emissions or accidental releases from 
transportation modes could be covered in the Energy sector 
under the category ‘Fugitive Emissions’. CO2 emissions 
from a pipeline can occur at the intake side during pumping 
and compression, at the pipeline joints, or at the storage site. 
Emission rates can differ from surface, underground and sub-
sea pipelines. Explicit guidance for CO2 transportation in 
pipelines is not given in the current IPCC methodologies, but a 
methodology for natural gas pipelines is included. A distinction 
is to be made between leakage during normal operation and 
CO2 losses during accidents or other physical disruptions. As 
described in Chapter 4, statistics on the incident rate in pipelines 
for natural gas and CO2 varied from 0.00011 to 0.00032 incidents 
km-1 year-1 (Gale and Davison, 2002). However, as an analogy 
of CO2 transportation to natural gas transportation, Gielen 
(2003) reported that natural gas losses during transportation can 
be substantial.
 
Total emissions from pipelines could be calculated on the 
basis of the net difference between the intake and discharge flow 
rates of the pipelines. Because CO2 is transported in pipelines as 
a supercritical or dense phase fluid, the effect of the surrounding 
temperature on the estimated flow rate would need to be taken 
into account. Volumetric values would need to be corrected 
accordingly when CO2 is transmitted from a cooler climate to a 
moderate or hot climate, and vice versa. In some cases, fugitive 
losses could be lower than metering accuracy tolerances. Hence, 
all metering devices measuring CO2 export and injection should 
be to a given standard and with appropriate tolerances applied. 
But metering uncertainties may prohibit measurement of small 
quantities of losses during transportation. For transportation by 
CO2 pipeline across the borders of several countries, emissions 
would need to be allocated to the countries where they occur. 
Chapter 9: Implications of carbon dioxide capture and storage for greenhouse gas inventories and accounting
371
 
No methodologies for estimation of fugitive emission 
from ship, rail or road transportation are included in the IPCC 
Guidelines.
9.2.2.3 
 Storage
Some estimates of CO2 emissions (physical leakage rates) 
from geological and ocean storage are given in Chapters 5 
and 6. Physical leakage rates are estimated to be very small 
for geological formations chosen with care. In oil reservoirs 
and coal seams, storage times could be significantly altered if 
exploitation or mining activities in these fields are undertaken 
after CO2 storage. Some of the CO2 injected into oceans would 
be released to the atmosphere over a period of hundreds to 
thousands of years, depending on the depth and location of 
injection.
 
The amount of CO2 injected or stored could be easily 
measured in many CCS systems. Estimation of physical leakage 
rates would require the development of new methodologies. 
Very limited data are available in relation to the physical leakage 
of CO2. 
 
Despite the essential differences in the nature of the physical 
processes of CO2 retention in oceans, geological formations, 
saline aquifers and mineralized solids, the mass of CO2 stored 
over a given time interval can be defined by the Equation 1.
CO2 stored= 
T
∫
O
  (CO2 injected(t) – CO2 emitted(t)dt            (1)
where t is time and T is the length of the assessment time 
period.
 
Use of this simple equation requires estimates or 
measurements of the injected CO2 mass and either default values 
of the amount of CO2 emitted from the different storage types, or 
rigorous source-specific evaluation of mass escaped CO2. This 
approach would be possible when accurate measurements of 
mass of injected and escaped CO2 are applied on site. Thus, for 
monitoring possible physical leakage of CO2 from geological 
formations, direct measurement methods for CO2 detection, 
geochemical methods and tracers, or indirect measurement 
methods for CO2 plume detection could be applied (see Section 
5.6, Monitoring and verification technology). 
 
Physical leakage of CO2 from storage could be defined as 
follows (Equation 2):
 
Emissions of CO2 from storage= 
T
∫
O
  m(t)dt                        (2)
where m(t) is the mass of CO2 emitted to the atmosphere per 
unit of time and T is the assessment time period. 
 
This addresses physical leakage that might occur in a specific 
timeframe after the injection, perhaps far into the future. The 
issue is discussed further in Section 9.3.
9.2.2.4 
 Mineral carbonation
Mineral carbonation of CO2 captured from power plants and 
industrial processes is discussed in Chapter 7. These processes 
are still under development and aim at permanent fixation of 
the CO2 in a solid mineral phase. There is no discussion in the 
literature about possible modes and rates of physical leakage of 
CO2 from mineral carbonation, probably because investigations 
in this field have been largely theoretical character (for 
example, Goldberg et al., 2000). However, the carbonate 
produced would be unlikely to release CO2. Before and during 
the carbonation process, some amount of gas could escape into 
the atmosphere.
  
The net benefits of mineral carbonation processes would 
depend on the total energy use in the chain from capture to 
storage. The general framework discussed above for CCS 
systems can also be applied in preparing inventories of emissions 
from these processes. The emissions from the additional energy 
requirements would be seen in the energy sector under the 
current reporting framework. The amount of CO2 captured 
and mineralized could be reported in the category where the 
capture takes place, or as a specific category addressing mineral 
carbonation, or in the sector ‘Other’.
9.2.2.5 
 Industrial uses
Most industrial uses of CO2 result in release of the gas to the 
atmosphere, often after a very short time period. Because 
of the short ‘storage times’, no change may be required in 
the inventory systems provided they are robust enough to 
avoid possible double counting or omission of emissions. 
The benefits of these systems are related to the systems they 
substitute for, and the relative net efficiencies of the alternate 
systems. Comparison of the systems would need to take into 
account the whole cycle from capture to use of CO2. As an 
example, methanol production by CO2 hydrogenation could be 
a substitute for methanol production from fossil fuels, mainly 
natural gas. The impacts of the systems are in general covered 
by current inventory systems, although they are not addressed 
explicitly, because the emissions and emission reductions are 
related to relative energy use (reduction or increase depending 
on the process alternatives).
 
In cases where industrial use of CO2 would lead to more 
long-term carbon storage in products, inventory methodologies 
would need to be tailored case by case. 
9.2.3�
Monitoring,�verification�and�uncertainties
The IPCC Guidelines and good practice reports give guidance 
on monitoring, verification and estimation of uncertainties, 
as well as on quality assurance and quality control measures. 
General guidance is given on how to plan monitoring, what to 
monitor and how to report on results. The purpose of verifying 
national inventories is to establish their reliability and to check 
the accuracy of the reported numbers by independent means. 
 
Section 5.6, on monitoring and verification technology, 
assesses the current status of monitoring and verification 
techniques for CCS systems. The applicability of monitoring 
techniques as well as associated detection limits and uncertainties 
vary greatly depending on the type and specific characteristics of 
the CCS projects. There is insufficient experience in monitoring 
CCS projects to allow conclusions to be drawn on physical 
leakage rates.
372
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
 
Reporting of uncertainties in emission and removal estimates, 
and how they have been derived, is an essential part of national 
greenhouse gas inventories. Uncertainty estimates can be based 
on statistical methods where measured data are available, or on 
expert judgement. No information on uncertainties related to 
emissions from different phases of CCS systems was available. 
In Section 5.7.3, the probability of release from geological 
storage is assessed based on data from analogous natural 
or engineered systems, fundamental physical and chemical 
processes, as well as from experience with current geological 
storage projects. The probabilities of physical leakage are 
estimated to be small and the risks are mainly associated with 
leakage from well casings of abandoned wells.
9.3  
Accounting issues
One of the goals of an accounting system is to ensure that CCS 
projects produce real and quantifiable environmental benefits. 
One ton of CO2 permanently stored has the same benefit in terms 
of atmospheric CO2 concentrations as one ton of CO2 emissions 
avoided. But one ton of CO2 temporarily stored has less value 
than one ton of CO2 emissions avoided. This difference can 
be reflected in the accounting system. Accounting for CCS 
may have to go beyond measuring the amount of CO2 stored 
in order to ensure the credibility of storage credits and that 
credits claimed are commensurate with benefits gained. CO2 
storage should not avoid properly accounting for emissions that 
have been moved to other times, other places, or other sectors. 
Yet, Kennett (2003) notes that if there is benefit to potentially 
permanent or even to known temporary storage, accounting 
systems should contribute to their credibility and transparency 
while minimizing transaction costs. 
 
In a political environment where only some parties have 
commitments to limit greenhouse gas emissions and where 
emissions from all sources are not treated the same, the amount 
by which emissions are reduced may not be equal to the amount of 
CO2 stored. Differences can occur because CO2 can be captured 
in one country but released in another country or at a later time. 
Also, CCs requires energy and likely additional emissions of 
CO2 to produce this additional energy. Yoshigahara et al. (2004) 
note that emission reduction through CCS technology differs 
from many other modes of emission reduction. Although the 
former avoids CO2 release to the atmosphere, it creates the 
long-term possibility that stored CO2 could eventually flow to 
the atmosphere through physical leakage. 
 
In this Chapter, the general term ‘leakage’ is used in the 
economist’s sense, to describe displacement of greenhouse 
gas emissions beyond the boundaries of the system under 
discussion. The term ‘physical leakage’ refers to escape of CO2 
from a storage reservoir. As discussed above, some physical 
leakage effects and the additional energy requirements will 
be reported within standard, national reporting procedures for 
greenhouse gas emissions. Additional complexities arise when 
new or unexpected sources of emissions occur, for example, if 
CO2 injected into an uneconomic coal seam forces the release 
of methane from that seam. Complexities also arise when new 
or unexpected sources of emissions occur in different countries, 
for example, if CO2 is captured in one country but released in 
another, or at later times, for example, if CO2 is captured during 
one time period and physically leaked to the atmosphere at a 
later time. 
 
The problems of economic leakage are not unique to CCS 
systems, but the problems of physical leakage are unique to 
CCS. In particular, when emission inventories are done by 
country and year they may fail to report emissions that are 
delayed in time, displaced to other countries or to international 
waters, or that stimulate emissions of other greenhouse gases 
not identified as sources or for which methodologies have not 
been developed.
 
In this section, ideas on the issues involved in accounting 
are summarized for the stored CO2 of CCS systems. The 
consequences for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions are 
discussed, and ideas on alternative accounting strategies to 
address them are presented. Figure 9.2 provides a simple flow 
diagram of how CCS emissions can create flows of greenhouse 
gases that transcend traditional accounting boundaries. The 
diagram also shows how emissions might escape reporting 
because they occur outside normal system boundaries (sectoral, 
national, or temporal) of reporting entities. 
 
Concern about displacement of emissions across national 
boundaries is a consequence of the political and economic 
constructs being developed to limit greenhouse gas emissions. 
Most notably, the Kyoto Protocol imposes limits on greenhouse 
gas emissions from developed countries and from countries 
with economies in transition, but no such limits on emissions 
from developing countries or international transport. 
 
Concern about displacement of emissions across temporal 
boundaries is essentially the widely posed question: ‘if we store 
carbon away from the atmosphere, how long must it be stored?’ 
The same question is phrased by Herzog et al. (2003) as ‘What 
is the value of temporary storage?’ 
 
Concern about leakage among countries, sectors, or 
gases; or physical leakage from reservoirs is largely about the 
completeness and accuracy of emissions accounting. Kennett 
(2003), for example, emphasizes the importance of ‘establishing 
general rules and procedures to simplify transactions, and 
increasing certainty by defining legal rights and by providing 
dispute resolution and enforcement procedures’ and of ensuring 
the credibility of sinks-based emissions offsets or storage-based 
emissions reductions. The operation of a market requires clearly 
defined rights (i.e. who has the rights to the carbon stored), 
what those rights entail, how those rights can be transferred, 
and liability and remedies in the event of unanticipated release 
(Kennett, 2003). The core of establishing rights, liabilities, and 
markets will be the accounting and certification systems. Yet, a 
well-designed accounting system should not lead to transaction 
costs that unnecessarily discourage meritorious activities.

methodology
9.3.1.1 
Dealing with the impermanence of carbon dioxide 
storage
CO2 storage is not necessarily permanent. Physical leakage 
from storage reservoirs is possible via (1) gradual and long-
term release or (2) sudden release of CO2 caused by disruption 
of the reservoir. There is very little literature on accounting 
for the potential impermanence of CCS. There are, however, 
a significant number of publications on accounting for the 
impermanence of CO2 sequestration in the terrestrial biosphere. 
Although sequestration in the terrestrial biosphere is notably 
different from CO2 storage in the ocean or in geological 
reservoirs, there are also similarities. 13CO2 stored in the

energy required to operate the system, plus fugitive emissions from separation, 
transport and injection. 
terrestrial biosphere is subject to potential future release if, 
for example, there is a wildfire, change in land management 
practices, or climate change renders the vegetative cover 
unsustainable. Although the risks of CO2 loss from well-chosen 
geological reservoirs are very different, such risks do exist. 
The literature suggests various accounting strategies so that 
sequestration in the biosphere could be treated as the negative 
equivalent of emissions. Sequestration could be shown in 
national emission accounts and trading of emissions credits, and 
debits between parties could occur for sequestration activities 
in the terrestrial biosphere. Whether CCS is treated as a CO2 
sink or as a reduction in emissions, the issues of accounting for 
physical leakage from storage are similar.

IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
 
Chomitz (2000) suggests two primary approaches to 
accounting for stored CO2: (1) acknowledge that CO2 storage 
is likely not permanent, assess the environmental and economic 
benefits of limited-term storage, and allot credits in proportion 
to the time period over which CO2 is stored, and (2) provide 
reasonable assurance of indefinite storage. Examples discussed 
for sequestration in the terrestrial biosphere include (under the 
first approach) ton-year accounting (described below); and 
(under the second approach) various combinations of reserve 
credits and insurance replacing lost CO2 by sequestration reserves 
or other permanent emissions reductions. For further discussion 
on these issues, see Watson et al., 2000; Marland et al., 2001; 
Subak, 2003; Aukland et al., 2003; Wong and Dutschke, 2003; 
and Herzog et al., 2003. There are also proposals to discount 
credits so that there is a margin of conservativeness in the 
number of credits acknowledged. With this kind of discussion 
and uncertainty, negotiations toward the Kyoto Protocol have 
chosen to place limits on the number of credits that can be 
claimed for some categories of terrestrial CO2 sequestration 
during the Protocol’s first commitment period (UNFCCC, 
2002). 
 
To illustrate the concept of allotting credits in proportion 
to storage time, one alternative, the ton-year approach is 
described. The ton-year alternative for accounting defines an 
artificial equivalence so that capture and storage for a given 
time interval (for example, t years) are equated with permanent 
storage. Availability of credits can be defined in different ways 
but typically capture and storage for one year would result in 
a number of credits equal to 1/t, and thus storage for t years 
would result in one full credit (Watson et al., 2000). A variety 
of constructs have been proposed for defining the number of 
storage years that would be equated with permanent storage 
(see, for example, Marland et al., 2001). But as Chomitz (2000) 
points out, despite being based on scientific and technical 
considerations, this equivalence is basically a political decision. 
Although ton-year accounting typifies the first approach, it has 
been subject to considerable discussion. Another derivative 
of Chomitz’s first approach that has been further developed 
within negotiations on the Kyoto Protocol (Columbia, 2000; 
UNFCCC, 2002; UNFCCC, 2004) is the idea of expiring credits 
or rented temporary credits (Marland et el., 2001; Subak, 2003). 
Temporary or rented credits would have full value over a time 
period defined by rule or by contract, but would result in debits 
or have to be replaced by permanent credits at expiration. In 
essence, credit for stored CO2 would create liability for the 
possible subsequent CO2 release or commitment to storage was 
ended. 
 
UNFCCC (2002), Marland et al. (2001), Herzog et al. 
(2003), and others agree that the primary issue for stored CO2 
is liability. They argue that if credit is given for CO2 stored, 
there should be debits if the CO2 is subsequently released. 
Physical leakage from storage and current emissions produce 
the same result for the atmosphere. Accounting problems 
arise if ownership is transferred or stored CO2 is transferred 
to a place or party that does not accept liability (for example, 
if CO2 is stored in a developing country without commitments 
under the Kyoto protocol). Accounting problems also arise if 
potential debits are transferred sufficiently far into the future 
with little assurance that the systems and institutions of liability 
will still be in place if and when CO2 is released. The system 
of expiring credits in the Marrakech Accords for sequestration 
in the terrestrial biosphere fulfils the requirement of continuing 
liability. Limiting these credits to five years provides reasonable 
assurance that the liable institutions will still be responsible. 
This arrangement also addresses an important concern of those 
who might host CO2 storage projects, that they might be liable 
in perpetuity for stored CO2. Under most proposals, the hosts for 
CO2 storage would be liable for losses until credits expire and 
then liability would return to the purchaser/renter of the expiring 
credits. Kennett (2003) suggests that long-term responsibility 
for regulating, monitoring, certifying, and supporting credits 
will ultimately fall to governments (see also section 5.8.4). 
With this kind of ultimate responsibility, governments may 
wish to establish minimum requirements for CCS reservoirs 
and projects (see Torvanger et al., 2005). 
 
The 
published 
discussions 
on 
‘permanence’ 
have 
largely been in the context of sequestration in the terrestrial 
biosphere. It is not clear whether the evolving conclusions 
are equally appropriate for CCS in the ocean or in geological 
reservoirs. Important differences between modes of CCS 
may influence the accounting scheme chosen (see Table 9.2). 
An apparent distinction is that sequestration in the terrestrial 
biosphere involves initial release of CO2 to the atmosphere 
and subsequent removal by growing plants. But as storage in 
geological reservoirs does not generally involve release to the 
atmosphere, it might be envisioned as a decrease in emissions 
rather than as balancing source with sink. In either case, a mass 
of CO2 must be managed and isolated from the atmosphere. 
Storage in the terrestrial biosphere leaves open the possibility 
that sequestration will be reversed because of decisions on 
maintenance or priorities for resource management. Ocean and 
geological storage have very different implications for the time 
scale of commitments and for the role of physical processes 
versus decisions in potential physical releases.
 
An important question for crediting CCS is whether future 
emissions have the same value as current emissions. Herzog et 
al. (2003) define ‘sequestration effectiveness’ as the net benefit 
from temporary storage compared to the net benefit of permanent 
storage, but this value cannot be known in advance. They go one 
step further and argue that while CO2 storage is not permanent, 
reducing emissions may not be permanent either, unless some 
backstop energy technology assures all fossil fuel resources are 
not eventually consumed. According to Herzog et al. (2003), 
stored CO2 emissions are little different, to fossil fuel resources 
left in the ground. Most analysts, however, assume that all fossil 
fuels will never be consumed so that refraining from emitting 
fossil-fuel CO2 does not, like CO2 storage, give rise directly to 
a risk of future emissions. Wigley et al. (1996) and Marland 
et al. (2001) argue that there is value in delaying emissions. 
If storage for 100 years were to be defined as permanent, then 
virtually all carbon injected below 1500 m in the oceans would 
be considered to be permanent storage (Herzog et al., 2003). 
Chapter 9: Implications of carbon dioxide capture and storage for greenhouse gas inventories and accounting
375
At the other temporal extreme, Kheshgi et al. (1994) point 
out that over the very long term of equilibration between the 
ocean and atmosphere (over 1000 years), capture and storage 
in the ocean will lead to higher CO2 levels in the atmosphere 
than without emissions controls, because of the additional 
energy requirements for operating the system. It is also true that 
chronic physical leakage over long time periods could increase 
the difficulty of meeting targets for net emissions at some time 
in the future (see Hawkins, 2003; Hepple and Benson, 2003; 
and Pacala, 2003).
 
The fundamental question is then, how to deal with 
impermanent storage of CO2. Although Findsen et al. (2003) 
detail many circumstances where accounting for CCS is 
beginning or underway, and although the rates of physical 
leakage for well-designed systems may sometimes be in the 
range of the uncertainty of other components of emissions, the 
risks of physical leakage need to be acknowledged. A number 
of questions remains to be answered: how to deal with liability 
and continuity of institutions in perpetuity, how to quantify the 
benefits of temporary storage; the needs in terms of monitoring 
and verification, whether or not there is a need for a reserve 
of credits or other ways to assure that losses will be replaced, 
whether or not there is need for a system of discounting to 
consider expected or modelled duration of storage, the utility 
of expiring, temporary, or rented credits over very long time 
periods, whether there is a need to consider different accounting 
practices as a function of expected duration of storage or mode 
of storage. The implications if storage in the terrestrial biosphere 
and in geological formations are sufficiently different that the 
former might be considered carbon management and the latter 
CO2 waste disposal. 
 
Ultimately, the political process will decide the value of 
temporary storage and the allocation of responsibility for 
stored CO2. Some guidance is provided by precedents set by 
international agreements on sequestration in the terrestrial 
biosphere. But there are important differences to be considered. 
The reason for rules and policies is presumably to influence 
behaviour. Accounting rules for CO2 storage can best influence 
permanence if they are aimed accordingly: at liability for 
CO2 stored in the terrestrial biosphere but at the initial design 
and implementation requirements for CCS in the oceans or 
geological reservoirs.

physical leakage 
The previous section deals largely with the possibility that CO2 
emissions stored now will be released at a later time. It also 
introduces the possibility that emissions stored now will result in 
additional, current emissions in different countries or in different 
sectors. CO2 injected into the ocean could leak physically 
from international waters. Accounting for stored CO2 raises 
questions such as responsibility for the emissions from energy 
used in CO2 transport and injection, especially if transport and/
or storage is in a developing country or in international waters. 
Similarly, questions about physical leakage of stored CO2 will 
need to address liability for current year physical leakage that 
occurs in developing countries or from international waters. 
These questions may be especially complex when multiple 
countries have injected CO2 into a common reservoir such as 
the deep Atlantic Ocean, or into a deep aquifer under multiple 
countries, or if multiple countries share a common pipeline for 
CO2 transport. 
 
There may also be a need for international agreement on 
certification of CCS credits or performance standards for CCS 
projects. Standards would minimize the risk of leakage and 
maximize the time for CO2 storage. Performance standards 
could minimize the possibility of parties looking for the least 
cost, lowest quality storage opportunities - opportunities most 
susceptible to physical leakage - when liability for spatial or 
temporal leakage is not clear. Performance standards could be 
used to limit the choice of technologies, quality of operations, 
or levels of measurement and monitoring.
9.3.2 
Accounting issues related to Kyoto mechanisms 
(JI14 , CDM15, and ET16)
CCS is not currently addressed in the decisions of the COP to the 
UNFCCC in relation to the Kyoto mechanisms. Little guidance 
has been provided so far by international negotiations regarding 
the methodologies to calculate and account for project-related 
CO2 reductions from CCS systems under the various project-
based schemes in place or in development. The only explicit 
14 Kyoto Protocol Article 6.1 ‘For the purpose of meeting its commitments 
under Article 3, any Party included in Annex I may transfer to, or acquire from, 
any other such Party emission reduction units resulting from projects aimed 
at reducing anthropogenic emissions by sources or enhancing anthropogenic 
removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in any sector of the economy…’
15 Kyoto Protocol Article 12.2 ‘The purpose of the clean development mechanism 
shall be to assist Parties not included in Annex I in achieving sustainable 
development and in contributing to the ultimate objective of the Convention, 
and to assist Parties included in Annex I in achieving compliance with their 
quantified emission limitation and reduction commitments under Article 3.’
16 Kyoto Protocol Article 17 ‘The Conference of the Parties shall define the 
relevant principles, modalities, rules and guidelines, in particular for verification, 
reporting and accountability for emissions trading. The Parties included in 
Annex B may participate in emissions trading for the purpose of fulfilling 
their commitments under Article 3. Any such trading shall be supplemental to 
domestic actions for the purpose of meeting quantified emission limitation and 
reduction commitments under that Article.’
reference to CCS in the Kyoto Protocol states that Annex I 
countries need to “research, promote, develop and increasingly 
use CO2 sequestration technologies”17. The Marrakech Accords 
further clarify the Protocol regarding technology cooperation, 
stating that Annex I countries should indicate how they give 
priority to cooperation in the development and transfer of 
technologies relating to fossil fuel that capture and store 
greenhouse gases (Paragraph 26, Decision 5/CP.7). No text 
referring explicitly to CCS project-based activities can be found 
in the CDM and JI-related decisions (Haefeli et al., 2004). 
Further, Haefeli et al. (2004) note that CCS is not explicitly 
addressed in any form in CO2 reporting schemes that include 
projects (i.e., the Chicago Climate Exchange and the EU 
Directive for Establishing a Greenhouse Gas Emissions 
Trading Scheme (implemented in 2005) along with the EU 
Linking Directive (linking the EU Emissions Trading Scheme 
with JI and the CDM). At present, it is unclear how CCS will 
be dealt with in practice. According to Haines et al. (2004), the 
eligibility of CCS under CDM could be resolved in a specific 
agreement similar to that for land use, land-use change and 
forestry (LULUCF) activities. As with biological sinks, there 
will be legal issues as well as concerns about permanence and 
economic leakage, or emissions outside a system boundary. At 
the same time, CCS could involve a rather less complex debate 
because of the geological time scales involved. Moreover, 
Haefeli et al. (2004) noted that guidelines on how to account for 
CO2 transfers between countries would need to be agreed either 
under the UNFCCC or the Kyoto Protocol. Special attention 
would need to be given to CO2 exchange between an Annex I 
country and a non-Annex I country, and between an Annex I 
country party to the Kyoto Protocol and an Annex I country that 
has not ratified the Kyoto Protocol.
9.3.2.1 
 Emission baselines 
The term ‘baseline’, used mostly in the context of project-
based accounting, is a hypothetical scenario for greenhouse 
gas emissions in the absence of a greenhouse gas reduction 
project or activity (WRI, 2004). Emission baselines are the 
basis for calculation of net reductions (for example, storage) of 
emissions from any project-based activity. Baselines need to be 
established to show the net benefits of emissions reductions. The 
important issue is to determine which factors need to be taken 
into account when developing an emissions baseline. At present, 
there is little guidance on how to calculate net reductions in CO2 
emissions through CCS project-based activities. An appropriate 
baseline scenario could minimize the risk that a project receives 
credits for avoiding emissions that would have been avoided in 
the absence of the project (Haefeli et al., 2004).
9.3.2.2 
 Leakage in the context of the Kyoto mechanisms
The term ‘Leakage’ is defined according to Marrakech Accords 
as ‘the net change of anthropogenic emissions by sources and/
or removals by sinks of greenhouse gases which occurs outside

the project boundary, and that is measurable and attributable to 
the Article 6 project’. The term has been proposed for leakage 
of emissions resulting from capture, transport and injection, 
which should not be confused with releases of CO2 from a 
geological reservoir (escaped CO2). According to Haefeli et 
al. (2004), current legislation does not deal with cross-border 
CCS projects and would need further clarification. Guidance 
would be especially needed to deal with cross-border projects 
involving CO2 capture in an Annex I country that is party to the 
Kyoto Protocol and storage in a country not party to the Kyoto 
Protocol or in an Annex I country not bound by the Kyoto 
Protocol. 
 
Table 9.3 provides an overview of the Kyoto mechanisms 
and the general principles and requirements of each (practical 
indices and specific accounting rules and procedures) for 
developing CCS accounting systems that can be employed 
for emissions control and reduction within these mechanisms. 
Although the political process has not yet decided how CCS 
systems will be accepted under the Kyoto mechanisms, these 
general procedures could be applicable to them as well as to 
other similar schemes on emission trading and projects. 
9.4  
Gaps in knowledge
Methodologies for incorporating CCS into national inventories 
and accounting schemes are under development. CCS (see 
Sections 9.2 and 9.3) can be incorporated in different ways and 
data requirements may differ depending on the choices made. 
The following gaps in knowledge and need for decisions by the 
political process have been identified: 
• 
Methodologies to estimate physical leakage from storage, 
and emission factors (fugitive emissions) for estimating 
emissions from capture systems and from transportation and 
injection processes are not available.
• 
Geological and ocean storage open new challenges 
regarding a) uncertainty on the permanence of the stored 
emissions, b) the need for protocols on transboundary 
transport and storage, c) accounting rules for CCS and, d) 
insight on issues such as emission measurement, long term 
monitoring, timely detection and liability/responsibility.
• 
Methodologies for reporting and verification of reduced 
emission under the Kyoto Mechanisms have not been agreed 
upon. 
• 
Methodologies for estimating and dealing with potential 
emissions resulting from system failures, such as sudden 
geological faults and seismic activities or pipeline disruptions 
have not been developed.

Introduction
This Annex presents data about the relevant physical and 
chemical properties of CO2 together with an outline of the effects 
of CO2 on human health and a summary of some of the typical 
recommendations for avoiding harm to humans. Established 
uses for CO2 are listed and some common conversion factors 
relevant to this report are presented. An introduction is also 
provided to the main types of fossil fuels and other carbon-
containing fuels, as background to considering how their use 
produces CO2.
AI.2 
Carbon dioxide
Carbon dioxide is a chemical compound of two elements, carbon 
and oxygen, in the ratio of one to two; its molecular formula is 
CO2. It is present in the atmosphere in small quantities (370 
ppmv) and plays a vital role in the Earth’s environment as a 
necessary ingredient in the life cycle of plants and animals. 
During photosynthesis plants assimilate CO2 and release 
oxygen. Anthropogenic activities which cause the emission of 
CO2 include the combustion of fossil fuels and other carbon-
containing materials, the fermentation of organic compounds 
such as sugar and the breathing of humans. Natural sources of 
CO2, including volcanic activity, dominate the Earth’s carbon 
cycle. 
 
CO2 gas has a slightly irritating odour, is colourless and is 
denser than air. Although it is a normal, if minor, constituent of 
air, high concentrations of CO2 can be dangerous.
AI.2.1 
Physical properties of CO2
AI.2.1.1 General
At normal temperature and pressure, carbon dioxide is a gas. 
The physical state of CO2 varies with temperature and pressure 
as shown in Figure AI.1 − at low temperatures CO2 is a solid; on 
warming, if the pressure is below 5.1 bar, the solid will sublime 
directly into the vapour state. At intermediate temperatures 
(between −56.5oC, the temperature of the triple point, and 
31.1oC, the critical point), CO2 may be turned from a vapour 
into a liquid by compressing it to the corresponding liquefaction 
pressure (and removing the heat produced). 
 
At temperatures higher than 31.1oC (if the pressure is greater 
than 73.9 bar, the pressure at the critical point), CO2 is said

to be in a supercritical state where it behaves as a gas; indeed 
under high pressure, the density of the gas can be very large, 
approaching or even exceeding the density of liquid water (also 
see Figure AI.2). This is an important aspect of CO2’s behaviour 
and is particularly relevant for its storage. 
 
Heat is released or absorbed in each of the phase changes 
across the solid-gas, solid-liquid and liquid-gas boundaries (see 
Figure AI.1). However, the phase changes from the supercritical 
condition to liquid or from supercritical to gas do not require 
or release heat. This property is useful for the design of CO2 
compression facilities since, if this can be exploited, it avoids 
the need to handle the heat associated with the liquid-gas phase 
change.
AI.2.1.2� Specific�physical�properties
There is a substantial body of scientific information available 
on the physical properties of CO2. Selected physical properties 
of CO2 are given in Table AI.1 The phase diagram for CO2 
is shown in Figure AI.1 Many authors have investigated the 
equation of state for CO2 (e.g., Span and Wagner, 1996). The 
variation of the density of CO2 as a function of temperature 
and pressure is shown in Figure AI.2, the variation of vapour 
pressure of CO2 with temperature in Figure AI.3, and the 
variation of viscosity with temperature and pressure in Figure 
AI.4 Further information on viscosity can be found in Fenghour 
et al. (1998). The pressure-enthalpy chart for CO2 is shown 
in Figure AI.5. The solubility of CO2 in water is described in 
Figure AI.6.
AI.2.2 
Chemical properties of CO2
AI.2.2.1 General
Some thermodynamic data for CO2 and a few related compounds 
are given in Table AI.2.
 
In an aqueous solution CO2 forms carbonic acid, which 
is too unstable to be easily isolated. The solubility of CO2 in 
water (Figure AI.6) decreases with increasing temperature and 
increases with increasing pressure. The solubility of CO2 in

water also decreases with increasing water salinity by as much as 
one order of magnitude (Figure AI.7). The following empirical 
relation (Enick and Klara, 1990) can be used to estimate CO2 
solubility in brackish water and brine:
 
wCO2, b = wCO2, w · (1.0 – 4.893414 · 10−2 · S + 
0.1302838 · 10−2 · S2 – 0.1871199 · 10−4 · S3)

where wCO2 is CO2 solubility, S is water salinity  
(expressed as total dissolved solids in % by weight) and the 
subscripts w and b stand for pure water and brine, respectively.
A solid hydrate separates from aqueous solutions of CO2 that are 
chilled (below about 11oC) at elevated pressures. A hydrate is a 
crystalline compound consisting of the host (water) plus guest 
molecules. The host is formed from a tetrahedral hydrogen-
bonding network of water molecules; this network is sufficiently 
open to create pores (or cavities) that are large enough to 
contain a variety of other small molecules (the guests). Guest 
molecules can include CH4 and CO2. CO2 hydrates have similar 
(but not identical) properties to methane hydrates, which have 
been extensively studied due to their effects on natural gas 
production and their potential as future sources of hydrocarbons.

AI.2.2.2 Impact of CO2 on pH of water
The dissolution of CO2 in water (this may be sea water, or 
the saline water in geological formations) involves a number 
of chemical reactions between gaseous and dissolved carbon 
dioxide (CO2), carbonic acid (H2CO3), bicarbonate ions 
(HCO3
−) and carbonate ions (CO3
2−) which can be represented 
as follows:
CO2 (g) ↔ CO2 (aq)

CO2 (aq) + H2O ↔ H2CO3 (aq)

Addition of CO2 to water initially leads to an increase in the 
amount of dissolved CO2. The dissolved CO2 reacts with 
water to form carbonic acid. Carbonic acid dissociates to form 
bicarbonate ions, which can further dissociate into carbonate 
ions. The net effect of dissolving anthropogenic CO2 in water 
is the removal of carbonate ions and production of bicarbonate 
ions, with a lowering in pH.
 
Figure AI.8 shows the dependence of pH on the extent 
to which CO2 dissolves in sea water at temperatures of 0oC 
and 25oC based on theoretical calculations (IEA Greenhouse 
Gas R&D Programme, 2000) by iterative solution of the 
relationships (Horne, 1969) for the carbonic acid/bicarbonate/
carbonate equilibria combined with activity coefficients for the 
bicarbonate and carbonate ions in sea water. The temperature 
dependence of the ionization of water and the bicarbonate 
equilibria were also included in this calculation. This gives 
values for the pH of typical sea water of 7.8−8.1 at 25oC and 
8.1−8.4 at 0oC. These values, which are strongly dependent on 
carbonate/bicarbonate buffering, are in line with typical data 
for sea water (Figure AI.8 shows 2 experimental data points 
reported by Nishikawa et al., 1992).
 
Figure AI.8 also shows that there is a small effect of 
temperature on the reduction in pH that results from dissolution 
of CO2. A minor pressure dependence of water ionization is 
also reported (Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 2000). 
The effect on water ionization of an increase in pressure from 
atmospheric to 250 bar (equivalent to 2500 m depth) is minor 
and about the same as would result from increasing temperature 
by about 2oC. The effect of pressure can therefore be ignored.
AI.2.3 
Health and safety aspects of exposure to CO2
As a normal constituent of the atmosphere, where it is present 
in low concentrations (currently 370 ppmv), CO2 is considered 
harmless. CO2 is non-flammable. 
 
As it is 1.5 times denser than air at normal temperature and 
pressure, there will be a tendency for any CO2 leaking from 
pipework or storage to collect in hollows and other low-lying 
confined spaces which could create hazardous situations. The 
hazardous nature of the release of CO2 is enhanced because the 
gas is colourless, tasteless and is generally considered odourless 
Figure AI.8 Dependence of pH on CO2 concentration in sea water.

correlation developed by those authors (TDS stands for total dissolved 
solids).

unless present in high concentrations. 
 
When contained under pressure, escape of CO2 can present 
serious hazards, for example asphyxiation, noise level (during 
pressure relief), frostbite, hydrates/ice plugs and high pressures 
(Jarrell et al., 2002). The handling and processing of CO2 must 
be taken into account during the preparation of a health, safety 
and environment plan for any facility handling CO2. 
AI.2.3.1 Effects of exposure to CO2
At normal conditions, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 
is 0.037%, a non-toxic amount. Most people with normal 
cardiovascular, 
pulmonary-respiratory 
and 
neurological 
functions can tolerate exposure of up to 0.5−1.5% CO2 for one 
to several hours without harm.
 
Higher concentrations or exposures of longer duration are 
hazardous – either by reducing the concentration of oxygen 
in the air to below the 16% level required to sustain human 
life1, or by entering the body, especially the bloodstream, 
and/or altering the amount of air taken in during breathing; 
such physiological effects can occur faster than the effects 
resulting from the displacement of oxygen, depending on the 
concentration of CO2. This is reflected in, for example, the 
current US occupational exposure standard of 0.5% for the 
maximum allowable concentration of CO2 in air for eight hours 
continuous exposure; the maximum concentration to which 
operating personnel may be exposed for a short period of time 
is 3.0%.
 
The impact of elevated CO2 concentrations on humans 
depends on the concentration and duration of exposure. At 
concentrations up to 1.5%, there are no noticeable physical 
consequences for healthy adults at rest from exposure for 
an hour or more (Figure AI.9); indeed, exposure to slightly 
elevated concentrations of CO2, such as in re-breathing masks 
on aeroplanes at high altitude, may produce beneficial effects 
(Benson et al., 2002). Increased activity or temperature may 
affect how the exposure is perceived. Longer exposure, even 
to less than 1% concentration, may significantly affect health. 
Noticeable effects occur above this level, particularly changes 
in respiration and blood pH level that can lead to increased heart 
rate, discomfort, nausea and unconsciousness. 
 
It is noted (Rice, 2004) that most studies of the effects of 
CO2 have involved healthy young male subjects, especially in 
controlled atmospheres such as submarines. Carbon dioxide 
tolerance in susceptible subgroups, such as children, the elderly, 
or people with respiratory deficiency, has not been studied to 
such an extent. 
 
Acute exposure to CO2 concentrations at or above 3% 
may significantly affect the health of the general population. 
Hearing loss and visual disturbances occur above 3% CO2. 
Healthy young adults exposed to more than 3% CO2 during 
exercise experience adverse symptoms, including laboured 
1 Signs of asphyxia will be noted when atmospheric oxygen 
concentration falls below 16%. Unconsciousness, leading to death, 
will occur when the atmospheric oxygen concentration is reduced to  
≤ 8% although, if strenuous exertion is being undertaken, this can 
occur at higher oxygen concentrations (Rice, 2004).
breathing, headache, impaired vision and mental confusion. 
CO2 acts as an asphyxiant in the range 7−10% and can be fatal 
at this concentration; at concentrations above 20%, death can 
occur in 20 to 30 minutes (Fleming et al., 1992). The effects of 
CO2 exposure are summarized in Table AI.3, which shows the 
consequences at different concentrations.
 
Health risks to the population could therefore occur if a 
release of CO2 were to produce:
• 
relatively low ambient concentrations of CO2 for prolonged 
periods;
• 
or intermediate concentrations of CO2 in relatively anoxic 
environments;
• 
 or high concentrations of CO2.
CO2 intoxication is identified by excluding other causes, as 
exposure to CO2 does not produce unique symptoms.
AI.2.3.2 Occupational standards 
Protective standards have been developed for workers who 
may be exposed to CO2 (Table AI.4 shows US standards but 
similar standards are understood to apply in other countries). 
These standards may or may not be relevant for protection of 
the general population against exposure to CO2. Nevertheless, 
the occupational standards exist and provide a measure of the 
recommended exposure levels for this class of individual.
 
Site-specific risk assessments using these and other health 
data are necessary to determine potential health risks for the 
general population or for more sensitive subjects.
AI.2.3.3 Sensitive populations
Rice (2004) has indicated that there may be certain specific 
groups in the population which are more sensitive to elevated 
CO2 levels than the general population. Such groups include 
those suffering from certain medical conditions including 
cerebral disease as well as patients in trauma medicated patients 
and those experiencing panic disorder, as well as individuals 
Figure AI.9 Effects of CO2 exposure on humans (Fleming et al., 
1992).
392
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
with pulmonary disease resulting in acidosis, children and 
people engaged in complex tasks. 
 
CO2 is a potent cerebrovascular dilator and significantly 
increases the cerebral blood flow. CO2 exposure can seriously 
compromise patients in a coma or with a head injury, with 
increased intra-cranial pressure or bleeding, or with expanding 
lesions. An elevated partial pressure of CO2 in arterial blood can 
further dilate cerebral vessels already dilated by anoxia.
 
Anoxia and various drugs (Osol and Pratt, 1973) can 
depress the stimulation of the respiratory centre by CO2. In 
such patients, as well as patients with trauma to the head, the 
normal compensatory mechanisms will not be effective against 
exposure to CO2 and the symptoms experienced will not 
necessarily alert the individuals or their carers to the presence 
of high CO2 levels.
 
Patients susceptible to panic disorder may experience an 
increased frequency of panic attacks at 5% CO2 (Woods et al., 
1988). Panic attack and significant anxiety can affect the ability 
of the individual to exercise appropriate judgment in dangerous 
situations.
 
CO2 exposure can increase pulmonary pressure as well as 
systemic blood pressure and should be avoided in individuals 
with systemic or pulmonary hypertension. The rise in cardiac 
work during CO2 inhalation could put patients with coronary 
artery disease or heart failure in jeopardy (Cooper et al., 1970).
 
Infants and children breathe more air than adults relative to 
their body size and they therefore tend to be more susceptible 
to respiratory exposures (Snodgrass, 1992). At moderate to 
high CO2 concentrations, the relaxation of blood vessels and 
enhanced ventilation could contribute to rapid loss of body heat 
in humans of any age. Carbon dioxide can significantly diminish 
an individual’s performance in carrying out complex tasks.
AI.2.3.4 CO2 control and response procedures
Suitable control procedures have been developed by industries 
which use CO2, for example, minimizing any venting of CO2 
unless this cannot be avoided for safety or other operational 
reasons. Adequate ventilation must be provided when CO2 is 
discharged into the air to ensure rapid dispersion.
 
Due its high density, released CO2 will flow to low-levels 
and collect there, especially under stagnant conditions. High 
concentrations can persist in open pits, tanks and buildings. For 
this reason, monitors should be installed in areas where CO2 
might concentrate, supplemented by portable monitors. If CO2 
escapes from a vessel, the consequent pressure drop can cause a 
hazardous cold condition with danger of frostbite from contact 
with cold surfaces, with solid CO2 (dry ice) or with escaping 
liquid CO2. Personnel should avoid entering a CO2 vapour

also because of the danger of frostbite. 
 
Hydrates, or ice plugs, can form in the piping of CO2 
facilities and flowlines, especially at pipe bends, depressions 
and locations downstream of restriction devices. Temperatures 
do not have to fall below 0oC for hydrates to form; under 
elevated pressures this can occur up to a temperature of 11oC. 
AI.2.4 
Established uses for CO2
A long-established part of the industrial gases market involves the 
supply of CO2 to a range of industrial users (source: Air Liquide). 
In several major industrial processes, CO2 is manufactured on 
site as an intermediate material in the production of chemicals. 
Large quantities of CO2 are used for enhanced oil recovery. 
Other uses of CO2 include:
• 
Chemicals 
-    Carbon dioxide is used in synthesis chemistry and to 
control reactor temperatures. CO2 is also employed 
to neutralize alkaline effluents.
-    The main industrial use of CO2 is in the manufacture 
of urea, as a fertilizer.
-    Large amounts of CO2 are also used in the manufacture 
of inorganic carbonates and a lesser amount is 
used in the production of organic monomers and 
polycarbonates.
-    Methanol is manufactured using a chemical process 
which makes use of CO2 in combination with other 
feedstocks.
-    CO2 
is 
also 
used 
in 
the 
manufacture 
of 
polyurethanes.
• 
Pharmaceuticals
-    CO2 is used to provide an inert atmosphere, for 
chemical synthesis, supercritical fluid extraction 
and for acidification of waste water and for product 
transportation at low temperature (−78oC). 
• 
Food and Beverage
-    CO2 is used in the food business in three main areas: 
Carbonation of beverages; packaging of foodstuffs 
and as cryogenic fluid in chilling or freezing 
operations or as dry ice for temperature control 
during the distribution of foodstuffs. 
• 
Health care
-    Intra-abdominal 
insufflation 
during 
medical 
procedures to expand the space around organs or 
tissues for better visualization.
• 
Metals industry
-    CO2 is typically used for environmental protection; 
for example for red fume suppression during scrap 
and carbon charging of furnaces, for nitrogen pick-up 
reduction during tapping of electric arc furnaces and 
for bottom stirring. 
-    In non-ferrous metallurgy, carbon dioxide is used for 
fume suppression during ladle transfer of matte (Cu/
Ni production) or bullion (Zn/Pb production). 
-    A small amount of liquid CO2 is used in recycling 
waters from acid mine drainage.
• 
Pulp and paper
-    CO2 enables fine-tuning of the pH of recycled 
mechanical or chemical pulps after an alkaline 
bleaching. CO2 can be used for increasing the 
performance of paper production machines.
• 
Electronics 
-    CO2 is used in waste water treatment and as a cooling 
medium in environmental testing of electronic 
devices. CO2 can also be used to add conductivity 
to ultra-pure water and, as CO2 snow, for abrasive 
cleaning of parts or residues on wafers; CO2 can 
also be used as a supercritical fluid for removing 
photoresist from wafers, thus avoiding use of organic 
solvents.
• 
Waste treatment
-  
 Injection of CO2 helps control the pH of liquid 
effluents.
• 
Other applications
-   CO2 snow is used for fire extinguishers, for pH control 
and for regulation of waste waters in swimming 
pools.

 Fuels and emissions
AI.4.1 
Carbonaceous fuels
Carbonaceous fuels can be defined as materials rich in carbon 
and capable of producing energy on oxidation. From a historical 
perspective, most of these fuels can be viewed as carriers of solar 
energy, having been derived from plants which depended on 
solar energy for growth. Thus, these fuels can be distinguished 
by the time taken for their formation, which is millions of years 
for fossil fuels, hundreds of years for peat and months-to-years 
for biofuels. On the scale of the human lifespan, fossil fuels are 
regarded as non-renewable carbonaceous fuels while biofuels 
are regarded as renewable. Coal, oil and natural gas are the major 
fossil fuels. Wood, agro-wastes, etcetera are the main biofuels 
for stationary uses but, in some parts of the world, crops such 
as soya, sugar cane and oil-seed plants are grown specifically to 
produce biofuels, especially transport fuels such as bioethanol 
and biodiesel. Peat is close to being a biofuel in terms of its 
relatively short formation time compared with fossil fuels.
AI.4.1.1 Coal
Coal is the most abundant fossil fuel present on Earth. Coal 
originated from the arrested decay of the remains of plant 
life which flourished in swamps and bogs many millions of 
years ago in a humid, tropical climate with abundant rainfall. 
394
IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage
Subsequent action of heat and pressure and other physical 
phenomena metamorphosed it into coal. Because of various 
degrees of metamorphic change during the process, coal is not a 
uniform substance; no two coals are the same in every respect. 
The composition of coal is reported in two different ways: The 
proximate analysis and the ultimate analysis, both expressed in 
% by weight. In a proximate analysis, moisture, volatile matter, 
fixed carbon and ash are measured using prescribed methods, 
which enable the equipment designer to determine how much 
air is to be supplied for efficient combustion, amongst other 
things. An ultimate analysis determines the composition in 
terms of the elements that contribute to the heating value, such

as carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulphur, the oxygen content 
(by difference), as well as ash. Along with these analyses, the 
heating value (expressed as kJ kg−1) is also determined.
 
Carpenter (1988) describes the various coal classification 
systems in use today. In general, these systems are based on 
hierarchy and rank. The rank of a coal is the stage the coal has 
reached during the coalification2 process – that is its degree of 
metamorphism or maturity. Table AI.7 shows the classification 
system adopted by the American Society for Testing Materials 
(ASTM), D388-92A (Carpenter, 1988; Perry and Green, 1997). 
This rank-based system is extensively used in North America 
and many other parts of the world. This system uses two 
parameters to classify coals by rank, fixed carbon (dry, mineral-
matter-free) for the higher rank coals and gross calorific value 
(moist, mineral-matter-free) for the lower rank coals. The 
agglomerating character of the coals is used to differentiate 
between adjacent coal groups.
AI.4.1.2 Oil and petroleum fuels
During the past 600 million years, the remains of incompletely 
decayed plant have become buried under thick layers of rock 
and, under high pressure and temperature, have been converted 
to petroleum which may occur in gaseous, liquid or solid form. 
The fluid produced from petroleum reservoirs may be crude oil 
(a mixture of light and heavy hydrocarbons and bitumen) or 
natural gas liquids. Hydrocarbons can also be extracted from 
tar sands or oil shales; this takes place in several parts of the 
world. 
 
Fuels are extracted from crude oil through fractional 
distillation, with subsequent conversion and upgrading. Such 
fuels are used for vehicles (gasoline, jet fuel, diesel fuel and 
liquefied petroleum gases (LPG)), heating oils, lighting oils, 
solvents, lubricants and building materials such as asphalts, plus 
a variety of other products. The compositions of heating fuels 
may differ in their composition, density, etcetera but general 
categories are recognized worldwide: kerosene-type vaporizing 
fuel, distillate (or ‘gas oil’) and more viscous blends and 
residuals. Tables AI.8 and AI.9 provide typical specifications 
of some common fuels (Perry and Green, 1997; Kaantee et al., 
2003).
AI.4.1.3 Natural gas
Natural gas is combustible gas that occurs in porous rock of 
the Earth’s crust; it is often found with or near accumulations 
of crude oil. It may occur in separate reservoirs but, more 
commonly, it forms a gas cap entrapped between the petroleum 
and an impervious, capping rock layer in a petroleum reservoir. 
Under high-pressure conditions, it becomes partially mixed 
with or dissolved in the crude oil. Methane (CH4) is the main 
component of natural gas, usually making up more than 80% 
of the constituents by volume. The remaining constituents 
are ethane (C2H6), propane (C3H8), butane (C4H10), hydrogen 
sulphide (H2S) and inerts (N2, CO2 and He). The amounts of 
2 Coalification refers to the progressive transformation of peat through lignite/
brown coal, to sub-bituminous, bituminous and anthracite coals.
these compounds can vary greatly depending on location. 
Natural gas is always treated prior to use, mainly by drying, and 
by removing H2S and, depending on the amount present, CO2. 
There are no universally accepted specification systems for 
marketed natural gas; however a typical composition of natural 
gas is given in Table AI.10 (Spath and Mann, 2000).
AI.4.1.4 Biofuels
Biofuels may be defined as fuels produced from organic matter 
or combustible oils produced by plants (IPCC, 2001). Dedicated 
energy crops, including short-rotation woody crops such as 
hardwood trees and herbaceous crops such as switch grass, are 
agricultural crops that are solely grown for use as biofuels. These 
crops have very fast growth rates and can therefore provide a 
regular supply of fuel. The category of biofuels also includes 
wood from trees and wood waste products (e.g., sawdust, 
wood chips, etc.), crop residues (e.g., rice husks, bagasse, corn 
husks, wheat chaff, etc.). This category of fuel is often taken to 
include some types of municipal, animal and industrial wastes 
(e.g., sewage sludge, manure, etc.). These would be combusted 
in stationary plants. Chemical properties of typical biofuels, 
including peat, are given in Table AI.11 (Sami et al., 2001; 
Hower, 2003).
 
Biomass-derived fuels can also be manufactured for use 
as transport fuels, for example ethanol from fermentation of 
plant material or biodiesel produced by transesterification of 
vegetable oils. The energy efficiency of fermentation systems 
can be improved by combustion of the solid residues to produce 
electricity.
AI.4.2 
Examples of emissions from carbonaceous fuels 
Depending on the fuel type and application, the utilization of 
carbonaceous fuels causes direct and indirect emissions of one 
or more of the following: SOx, NOx, particulate matter, trace 
metals and elements, volatile organic carbons and greenhouse 
gases (e.g., CO2, CH4, N2O). Direct emissions are usually 
confined to the point of combustion of the fuel. Indirect 
emissions include those that arise from the upstream recovery, 
processing and distribution of the fuel. Life cycle analysis 
(LCA) can be used to account for all emissions (direct as well 
as indirect) arising from the recovery, processing, distribution 
and end-use of a fuel. Table AI.12 (Cameron, 2002) and Table 
AI.13 (EPA, 2004) give an idea of some direct and indirect 
emissions anticipated, but these should only be viewed as 
examples due to the considerable variation there can be in many 
of these values.
