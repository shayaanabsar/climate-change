2. INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES
2.1 
Overview
Greenhouse gas emissions are produced from a variety of industrial activities which are
not related to energy.  The main emission sources are industrial production processes
which chemically or physically transform materials.  During these processes, many
different greenhouse gases, including CO2, CH4, N2O, and PFCs, can be released.
Cement production is a notable example of an industrial process that releases a significant
amount of CO2.  Different halocarbons (and SF6) are also consumed in industrial
processes or used as alternatives to ozone depleting substances (ODS) in various
applications.  Table 2-1 gives an overview of potential industrial emission sources of
GHGs and ozone and aerosol precursors (NOx, NMVOCs, CO and SO2).
In some instances industrial process emissions are produced in combination with fuel
combustion emissions and it may be difficult to decide whether a particular emission
should be reported within the energy or industrial processes sector.  Where the main
purpose of the fuel combustion is to use the heat released, the resulting emissions are
included as energy emissions, not industrial process emissions.  There are, however, some
chemical processes or stages of processes, which oxidise carbon as a feedstock and are
exothermic.  The reduction of iron in a blast furnace through the combustion of coke is
an example.  Invariably the heat released is used within the processes or for other energy
needs of the producer.  However, in this case, since the primary purpose of coke
oxidisation is to produce pig iron, the emissions are considered to be industrial.
In some cases not all fuel feedstock delivered to petrochemical plants is used for
manufacture of other products.  Some feedstock may in fact be used for energy purposes
in the sense that it is combusted for the heat released.  This may be included as energy in
the national energy balance, but not necessarily.  The separation of the feedstock and
energy uses and the identification of any fuel by-products from the processes is a
notoriously difficult area of energy statistics.
Where a country has difficulty in distinguishing whether an emission is energy- or
industrial-based, compilers of industrial-process emissions statistics should liaise closely
with their energy counterparts and compare their basic data for fuel use in the industrial
processes to avoid double counting.
All emissions, including evaporative emissions, which occur in energy transformation
activities are discussed in the Energy Chapter.  Emissions from petrochemical processes
are, however, covered in this chapter.  Emissions of NMVOCs from use of solvents are
discussed in the chapter “Solvents and other product use” even if they originate from an
industrial process.
CO2 from use of biological carbon as feedstock and fermentation processes should not
be reported under “Industrial Processes” or  any other sector of the IPCC Guidelines if
they originate from sources of carbon that are from a closed cycle.
Non-combustion industrial processes resulting in N2O emissions are recognised as
important anthropogenic contributors to global N2O emissions.  It is estimated that this
source category represents 10 to 50 per cent of anthropogenic N2O emissions and 3 to
20 per cent of all global emissions of N2O (IPCC, 1992).  The main sources of industrial
anthropogenic N2O emissions are adipic acid and nitric acid production.

Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) are
used as alternatives to ozone depleting substances being phased out under the Montreal
Protocol.  Current and expected applications of these compounds include refrigeration
and air-conditioning, fire extinguishing, aerosols, solvents, and foam production.  These
chemicals are either emitted instantaneously or slowly being leaked out over time.  Many
of these compounds have high global warming potentials (GWPs) and long atmospheric
lifetimes.  Consumption of HFCs, and to some extent PFCs and SF6, is expected to grow
substantially in the next decades due to their importance as substitutes for ozone
depleting substances.
HFCs, PFCs and SF6 are also emitted from industrial processes, such as production of
aluminium, magnesium and halocarbons (e.g., HCFC-22).  In some countries PFC
emissions from industrial processes could be an important contributor to national GHG
emissions, due to high GWPs.
Much of the information on the greenhouse gases contained within this chapter is based
on four key documents: ”Anthropogenic Emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O in Norway”,
(Rypdal, 1993), “Greenhouse gas emissions in Norway”,  Norwegian Pollution Control
Authority (1994), “Workbook for Industrial Emissions and Solvent Use”, National
Greenhouse Gas Inventory Committee, Australia (Workbook, Australia, 1995), and the
previous version of the Industrial Processes Chapter in the IPCC Guidelines for National
Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC, 1995).  In addition, several experts, within and outside
of the Industrial Processes Expert Group, have contributed to this chapter.

2.2 
General Methodology
2 . 2 . 1  O v e r v i e w
The general methodology employed to estimate emissions associated with each industrial
process involves the product of activity level data, e.g., amount of material produced or
consumed, and an associated emission factor per unit of consumption/production
according to the following method:
TOTALij = Aj x EFij
where:
TOTALij
=
process emission (tonnes) of gas i from
industrial sector j
Aj
=
amount of activity or production of process
material in industrial sector j (tonnes/yr)
EFij
=
emission factor associated with gas i per unit of
activity in industrial sector j (tonne/tonne)
This general method represents the fundamental relationship to evaluate industrial
process emissions.  It should be noted, however, that a number of mathematical steps
may be involved in reducing more complex mathematical formulae to the simplified form
of the formula above.  In cases where mathematical transformations are involved,
justifications are presented.
Often process emissions from a certain industrial sector are caused by emissions from a
few plants in each country.  Therefore, measurement data are often available.  Emission
estimates should be based on such data if they exist instead of a more generalised
methodology.  Even if measurements are not available, calculations should preferably be
based on plant-specific data.

The IPCC Methodology for national GHG inventories requires an intentional double
reporting of NMVOCs, methane and carbon monoxide, firstly in their individual
inventories, and as CO2 equivalent in the national CO2 inventory.  Whether an explicit
addition to the CO2 inventory is required depends on how the national CO2 inventory
has been calculated.  Guidance on this point is contained under “Double Counting of
Emissions” (See Overview) contained in each volume of the IPCC Guidelines.

Cement Production
2 . 3 . 1  O v e r v i e w
Carbon dioxide emitted during the cement production process represents the most
important source of non-energy industrial process of global carbon dioxide emissions.
Cement production accounts for about 2.4 per cent of total global industrial and energy
CO2 emissions (Marland et al., 1989).  Carbon dioxide is produced during the production
of clinker and intermediate product from which cement is made.  High temperatures in
cement kilns chemically change raw materials into cement clinker (greyish-black pellets
about the size of 12 mm-diameter marbles).  Specifically, calcium carbonate (CaCO3)
from limestone, chalk or  other calcium-rich materials is heated, forming lime (calcium
oxide or CaO) and carbon dioxide in a process called calcination or calcining:
CaCO3 + Heat  →  CaO + CO2
This lime combines with silica-containing materials, provided to the kiln as clays or shales,
to form dicalcium or tricalcium silicates, two of the four major compounds in cement
clinker (Griffin, 1987).  The clinker is then removed from the kiln, cooled, and pulverised
into an extremely fine grey powder.  During this operation a small amount of gypsum is
added to regulate the setting time of the cement.  The finished product is called
"Portland" cement1.
It should be noted that when poured concrete is curing, some CO2 is reabsorbed by the
concrete from the atmosphere.  This CO2 reabsorption is, however, believed to be only
a small fraction of the CO2 emission resulting from cement production and is therefore
usually ignored in emission calculations.
Most of the cement currently produced in the world is of Portland cement type, which
contains 60 per cent to 67 per cent lime by weight.  Other speciality cements are lower
in lime, but are typically used in small quantities.  Research is underway on cement
formulations that have similar structural properties to Portland cement, but require less
lime (Tresouthick and Mishulovich, 1990).  Carbon dioxide emissions from cement
production are essentially directly proportional to lime content, so production of
cements lower in lime yield less CO2.
Because CO2 is emitted during clinker production (rather than cement production itself),
emission estimates should be based on the lime content and production of clinker.
Estimating emissions based on the lime content and production of finished cement ignores
the consideration that some domestic cement may be made from imported clinker, or
that some finished cement may use additional lime that is not accounted for in the cement
calculations.  Clinker statistics, however, may not be readily available in some countries.
If this is the case, cement statistics can be used.  The differences between the lime
content and production of clinker and cement, in most countries, are not significant enough
to affect the emission estimates.
                                                  
     1 In some countries, e.g., Japan, an effort has been made to substitute blast furnace slag
for lime.  If this non-Portland type forms a significant quantity of cement production, it
can reduce the average emission factor.

Estimation of CO2 emissions from cement production is accomplished by applying an
emission factor, in tonnes of CO2 released per tonne of clinker produced, to the annual
clinker output.2  The emission factor (EF) is the product of the fraction of lime used in
the cement clinker and a constant reflecting the mass of CO2 released per unit lime.
EFclinker = Fraction CaO x (44.01 g/mole CO2 / 56.08 g/mole CaO)
or
EFclinker = Fraction CaO x 0.785
There are two methods for calculating this emission factor.  The first is to assume an
average CaO fraction in clinker.  Since clinker is mixed with gypsum, which contains no
lime per unit, to make cement, clinker has a higher lime percentage than finished cement.
The average clinker lime percentage has been estimated to be 64.6 per cent.3  This
number when multiplied by the molecular weight ratio of CO2/CaO (0.785) gives a
clinker emission factor of 0.5071 tonnes of CO2/tonne of clinker produced.
EFclinker = 0.646 x 0.785 = 0.5071
A second method is to assemble country or regional data on clinker production by type
and clinker CaO content by type, then calculate a weighted average for cement lime
content in the country.  In most countries, the difference in the results of these two
methods is likely to be small; any error in the lime content assumption is likely to be
smaller than the uncertainty in clinker and cement production figures (Griffin, 1987).
If information on clinker production is not readily available, an emission factor in tonnes
of CO2 released per tonne of cement produced can be applied to annual cement
production instead.  This approach has been followed by Marland et al. (1989), who took
the average CaO content of cement to be 63.5 per cent, yielding an emission factor of
0.4985 CO2/cement (0.136 tonne CO2 as C/tonne cement).
EFcement =  0.635 x 0.785 =  0.4985
Additional research indicates that "masonry cement", as opposed to "Portland cement",
requires additional lime, over and above the lime used in its clinker.  The following
formula can be used to account for this activity:
                                                  
     2 Note that the estimation of CO2 from energy use during cement production is
explained in the energy chapter; these emissions should be reported under Energy: Fuel
Combustion activities.

The recommended method for estimating CO2 emissions from cement production is to
multiply the most reliable figures available for tonnes of clinker produced by an emission
factor of 0.5071 tonne CO2/tonne clinker.  Alternatively, cement production can be
multiplied by an emission factor of 0.4985 tonne CO2/tonne cement.
International cement production data are available from the United Nations (1988) and
from the U.S. Bureau of Mines (1988).  In some countries, national data may be available
from appropriate government ministries.  There is substantial overlap between the U.S.
Bureau of Mines and the UN data sets, but the former is more complete.  Published
information is also available from the European Cement Association (CEMBUREAU,
1990).

EMEP/CORINAIR has classified cement production as both an industrial combustion and
an industrial process (SNAP codes 30311 and 40612, respectively).  However, no
description of emission factors for the non-combustion emissions are presented.  A
default methodology is, therefore, presented below.
SO2 emissions will originate from sulphur in the fuel and in the clay raw material.  Most
(about 70-95 per cent) of the SO2 generated in the process will be absorbed in the
produced alkaline clinker (U.S. EPA 1995).  The fuel emissions are counted as energy
emissions while the SO2 from the clay should be counted as non-combustion emissions.
A non-combustion emission factor of 0.3 kg SO2/tonne cement has been calculated from
measurements in Norwegian plants (Rypdal 1995).  This factor may vary from plant to
plant as the sulphur content of raw materials and degree of absorption will vary.  If no
information on sulphur content and degree of absorption is available and there are no
measurement data, a factor of 0.3 kg SO2/tonne cement is suggested.

Lime Production
2 . 4 . 1  O v e r v i e w
Calcined limestone (or quicklime) is formed by heating limestone to decompose the
carbonates.  This is usually done at high temperatures in a rotary kiln and the process
releases carbon dioxide.  Depending on the product requirements (e.g., metallurgy, pulp
and paper, construction materials, effluent treatment, water softening, pH control and
soil stabilisation), primarily high calcium limestone (calcite) is processed in this manner
from the quarried limestone to produce quicklime in accordance with the following
reaction:
CaCO3 (limestone) + heat  →  CaO (quicklime) + CO2
Hydrated (slaked) lime is also produced, with additional hydration operations, at some
facilities.  Dolomitic limestone or magnesite may also be processed at high temperature
to obtain dolomitic lime (and release CO2) in accordance with the following reaction:
CaCO3.Mg CO3 (dolomite) + heat → CaO.MgO (dolomitic lime) + 2CO2
The production of lime involves a series of steps comparable to those used in the
production of Portland cement clinker.  These include quarrying the raw materials,
crushing and sizing, calcining (i.e., high temperature heat processing ~ 1100° C) the raw
materials to produce lime, hydrating the lime to calcium hydroxide followed by
miscellaneous transfer, storage and handling operations.

The mass of CO2 produced per unit of lime manufactured may be estimated from the
molecular weights and the lime content of products.  On the basis of the calcination
reaction, one mole of carbon dioxide is formed for each mole of quicklime produced
from burning calcium carbonate.  This was used to derive an emission factor based on the
amount of quicklime produced (ORTECH, 1991), assuming complete dissociation of the
carbonate rock and no reabsorption of CO2 by lime in the kiln.  In instances where
dolomitic limestone is calcined, the emission factor was derived based on the lime:
magnesia product (ORTECH, 1991).  The emission factors are tabulated in Table 2-2.
For high calcium lime, CO2 emissions are estimated according to:
EF =  44.01 g/mole CO2 /56.08 g/mole CaO
 
=  785 kg CO2 /tonne high calcium lime

For dolomitic lime, CO2 emissions are estimated according to:
 EF =  2 x 44 .01 g/mole CO2 /96.39 g/mole CaO • MgO
                    =  913 kg CO2 /tonne dolomitic lime
The coefficient 2 relates to the stoichiometric ratio of CO2 to CaO.MgO in the
calcination process.
Both formulas assume pure lime, but in some cases the purity may range from 85 to 95
per cent (Workbook, Australia, 1995).  In these cases, the formulas should be adjusted
according to the lime purity.

The consumption of lime may in cases result in the removal of CO2 from the
atmosphere.  The use of hydrated lime (for water softening) for example, results in CO2
reacting with lime to form calcium carbonate.  Lime is also used as a CO2 absorbent for
atmospheric control in the storage of fruit.  At this time, data is not available to reliably
estimate the extent of atmospheric CO2 removal from the use of lime.

Details for deriving emissions for this sector are not yet available.  SO2 should be
considered.  The non-combustion emissions will depend on the sulphur content and
mineralogical form (pyrite or gypsum) of the stone feed, the quality of the lime produced
and the type of kiln (U.S. EPA 1995).  In this process, SO2 emissions from combustion will
usually exceed the non-combustion emissions (U.S. EPA 1995).  Until more information
becomes available, it is recommended that only emissions from fuel combustion (Energy
Chapter) are considered.

Limestone and Dolomite Use
2 . 5 . 1  O v e r v i e w
Limestone (CaCO3) and dolomite (CaCO3.MgCO3) are basic raw materials having
commercial applications in a number of industries including metallurgy (e.g., iron and
steel), glass manufacture, agriculture, construction and environmental pollution control.
In industrial applications involving the heating of limestone or dolomite at high
temperatures, CO2 is generated.

The mass of CO2 emitted from the use of limestone and dolomite may be estimated from
a consideration of consumption, purity of the raw materials and the stoichiometry of the
chemical processes.
Emission factor, EFls, for limestone use:
EFls = f x [44.01 g/mole CO2] / [(100.09 g/mole CaCO3)]
             = (440 x f ) kg CO2 / tonne limestone
where:
f is the fractional purity of limestone in CaCO3 per tonne of total raw material
weight (if unknown, the default factor for f is equal to 1).
Emission factor, EFls, for dolomite use:
Efd =  f x [2 x 44.01 g/mole CO2] / [(184.41 g/mole CaCO3�MgCO3)]
           = (477 x f) kg CO2 / tonne dolomite
The total CO2 emission from limestone and dolomite use in Gg/yr calculated as:
TotalId = {(Als x EFls) + (Ad x EFd) }/106
                    = {(440 x f x Als) + (477 x f x Ad)}/106
where:
Totalld is the process emission of CO2 from limestone and dolomite use (Gg/yr)
Als is the consumption of limestone (tonnes/yr).  Consumption is assumed to equal
material mined (or dredged) plus material imported minus material exported.  The
consumption entering this calculation excludes limestone used for producing cement
and lime, agriculture and processes where CO2 is not generated.
Ad is the consumption of dolomite (tonnes/yr).  Consumption is assumed to equal
material mined plus material imported minus material exported.  The consumption
entering this calculation excludes limestone used for producing lime and magnesium,
and processes where CO2 is not generated.

Soda Ash Production and Use
2 . 6 . 1  O v e r v i e w
Soda ash (sodium carbonate, Na2CO3) is a white crystalline solid that is used as a raw
material in a large number of industries including glass manufacture, soap and detergents,
pulp and paper production and water treatment.  Carbon dioxide is emitted from the use
of soda ash, and may be emitted during production, depending on the industrial process
used to manufacture soda ash.
Emissions of CO2 from the production of soda ash vary substantially with the
manufacturing process.  Four different processes may be used commercially to produce
soda ash.  Three of these processes, monohydrate, sesquicarbonate and direct
carbonation, are referred to as natural processes.  The fourth, the Solvay process, is
classified as a synthetic process.
About 25 per cent of the world production is produced from natural sodium carbonate-
bearing deposits referred to as natural processes.  During the production process, trona
(the principal ore from which natural soda ash is made) is calcined in a rotary kiln and
chemically transformed into a crude soda ash.  Carbon dioxide and water are generated
as by-products of this process.  Carbon dioxide emissions can be estimated based on the
following chemical reaction:
Na2CO3 x NaHCO3 x 2H2O→ 3Na2CO3 + 5H2O + CO2
                       Trona
Soda Ash
According to this reaction, it takes 10.27 tonnes of trona to produce 1 tonne of carbon
dioxide.  Hence, for natural soda ash production, emissions of carbon dioxide can be
calculated by the following formula:
EF = 0.097 tonne CO2 / tonne of Trona
About 75 per cent of the world production is synthetic ash made from sodium chloride.
In the Solvay process, sodium chloride brine, limestone, coke and ammonia are the raw
materials in a series of reactions leading to the production of soda ash.  Ammonia,
however, is recycled and only a small amount is lost.  The series of reactions involved in
the Solvay process may be presented as follows:
CaCO3 + heat → CaO + CO2
CaO + H2O → Ca(OH)2
NaCl + H2O + NH3 + CO2 → NaHCO3 + NH4Cl
2NaHCO3 + heat → Na2CO3  + CO2 + H2O
Ca(OH)2  + 2NH4Cl → CaCl2 + 2NH3 + 2H2O

The net overall reaction may be summarised as:
CaCO3 + 2NaCl → Na2CO3  + CaCl2
From the series of reactions presented above, CO2 is generated in two pyrolysis
processes.  The CO2 generated is captured, compressed and directed to Solvay
precipitating towers for consumption in a mixture of brine (aqueous NaCl) and ammonia.
Although CO2 is generated as a by-product, the carbon dioxide is recovered and recycled
for use in the carbonation stage and in theory the process is neutral, i.e., generation of
CO2 equals uptake.
In practice, however, CO2 is emitted to the atmosphere during the production of soda
ash because more CO2 is produced than is stoichiometrically required.  The excess CO2
is produced by calcining limestone with metallurgical grade coke (approximately 7 per
cent of limestone weight).  In order to avoid double counting, CO2 emissions associated
with the use of coke in soda ash production should be accounted for separately and those
emissions associated with the non-energy use of coke subtracted from the totals in the
combustion section.
Carbon dioxide emissions are associated with the use of soda ash.  Some of the major
uses include glass manufacture, chemicals, soaps, detergents and flue gas desulphurisation.
For each of these uses, it is assumed that for each mole of soda ash use, one mole of
CO2 is emitted (U.S. EPA, 1994b).

Soda Ash Production
From stoichiometric considerations, the industrial process emission of CO2 associated
with the Solvay process is zero.  The excess CO2 emitted from soda ash production
originates from coke oxidation (see the Energy Chapter for appropriate emission rate for
coke combustion and use appropriate national statistics on coke use in soda ash
production).  For processes utilising trona, emissions can be calculated by the following
formula:
EF = 0.097 tonne CO2 / tonne of Trona
During the production of soda ash in the Solvay process, calcium chloride is produced.  In
cases where calcium chloride is discharged to the sea, calcium chloride dissolves to form
calcium and chloride ions.  Calcium ions in turn take part in a number of chemical
reactions, including the sequestering of carbonate ions to form calcium carbonate which
represents a sink for CO2.  Available experimental data from Australia indicate that
approximately 0.23 tonnes of CO2 is sequestered from the ocean for each tonne of soda
ash produced (Workbook, Australia, 1995).

For each mole of soda ash use, one mole of CO2 is emitted, so that the mass of CO2

Asphalt blowing (SNAP 60310) is the process of polymerising and stabilising asphalt to
improve its weathering characteristics.  Air blown asphalts are used in the production of
asphalt roofing products.  The blowing may take place in a refinery, an asphalt processing
plant or an asphalt roofing plant.  This activity leads to emissions of NMVOC.  The
emission factors in the EMEP/CORINAIR Guidebook range from 0.1 to 30 kg total
organic compounds/tonne asphalt blown depending on the degree of control and it may
be assumed that all the mass of asphalt used for non-paving use will be blown.

Asphalt road surfaces are composed of compacted aggregate and asphalt binder.  Gases
are emitted from the asphalt plant, the road surfacing operations and from the
subsequent road surface.  The emissions of NMVOC depend on the type of asphalt (slow,
medium or rapid cure) and the amount of diluent.  Emission factors given in Table 2-4 use
the default assumptions given in the EMEP/CORINAIR Guidebook (SNAP 40611).  The
amount of diluent used is usually lower in warm countries than in the colder, and hence
lower emission factors may be expected in warm countries.

There may be several other mineral production processes emitting pollutants.  These are
probably not significant on a global scale, but may be significant on a national or local
scale.  There is generally little information about emissions from these processes.
One emission source is the production of concrete pumice stone.  As for cement
production, SO2 emissions will originate from the fuel use and sulphur in clay.  About 45
per cent of the SO2 generated in the process will be sequestered in the product.  An
emission factor of about 0.5kg SO2/tonne product has been calculated from
measurements in Norwegian plants (Rypdal 1995), and used where plant-specific data are
not available.
NMVOCs may be emitted from manufacture of glass.  An emission factor of 4.5 kg/tonne
product has been derived from CASPER (1995).

Ammonia Production
2 . 8 . 1  O v e r v i e w
In most instances, anhydrous ammonia is produced by catalytic steam reforming of natural
gas (mostly CH4) or other fossil fuels.  As can be seen in the following reactions with
methane as a feedstock, carbon dioxide is produced.
C + H2O  →  CO + H2
CH4 + H2O  →  CO + 3H2
N2 + 3H2  → 2NH3

In general, the processes that affect CO2 emissions in the production of ammonia are:
• carbon monoxide shift at two temperatures using iron oxide, copper oxide and/or
chromium oxide catalyst for conversion to carbon dioxide;
• carbon dioxide absorption by a scrubber solution of hot potassium carbonate,
monoethanolamine (MEA), Sulfinol (alkanol amine and tetrahydrothiophene dioxide)
or  others;
• methanation of residual CO2 to methane with nickel catalysts to purify the synthesis
gas.
Natural gas is used as the feedstock in most plants, while other fuels (e.g., heavy oils) may
be used with the partial oxidation process.  In addition, plants may use by-product
hydrogen, rather than natural gas, to produce ammonia (thereby eliminating the release
of CO2 from the synthesis process) (CFI, 1992).  The production of ammonia represents
a significant non-energy industrial source of CO2 emissions.
2 . 8 . 2  P r o c e s s  D e s c r i p t i o n
The primary release of CO2 at plants using the natural gas catalytic steam reforming
process occurs during regeneration of the CO2 scrubbing solution with lesser emissions
resulting from condensate stripping.
Carbon Dioxide Regenerator
After absorption of CO2 from the process gas, the saturated scrubbing solutions (e.g.,
potassium carbonate, MEA, etc.) are regenerated (i.e., for re-use) with steam stripping
and/or boiling to release CO2 from the bicarbonates according to the following reactions:
Heat
2KHCO3  →  K2CO3 + H2O + CO2
Heat
(C2H5ONH2) 2 + H2CO3  →  2C2H5ONH2 + H2O + CO2
The stripping gas, containing CO2 and other impurities, may be directed to a urea plant
(where operational), to a liquid carbonic acid plant, or vented to the atmosphere
(Environment Canada, 1987).
Condensate Stripper
Cooling the synthesis gas after low temperature shift conversion forms a condensate
containing small quantities of CO2 and other process impurities.  The condensate is
stripped by steam, whereby the components may be vented to the atmosphere, but
normally recycled to the process together with the process stream (U.S. EPA, 1985).

Emissions of CO2 will depend on the amount and composition of gas (or oil) used in the
process.  It is assumed that all carbon will be emitted to air.  It is recommended that
inventory contributions are compiled using point source methods due to the rather
limited number of plants.  Where greatest accuracy is desired, this will require direct
contact with producers.  Alternatively, total sector emissions may be determined on an
area source basis using available emission factors and methods noted below.

The most accurate method of estimation will be:
Emission (kt) = Consumption of gas (kt) x carbon content x 44/12
If the gas consumption is not available, an alternative is to calculate the emissions from
the ammonia production:
Emission (kt) = Production of ammonia x Emission factor
In both cases, in order to avoid double counting, the quantities of oil or gas used must be
subtracted from the quantity reported under energy and non-energy use in the Energy
Chapter.
The CO2 from ammonia production may be used for producing urea or dry ice.  This
carbon will only be stored for a short time.  Therefore, no account should consequently
be taken for intermediate binding of CO2 in downstream manufacturing processes and
products.
Emission Factor Information
If the emissions are calculated from the gas or oil consumption, the standard emission
factors suggested in the energy chapter will be relevant.  The carbon content of natural
gas may vary, and it is recommended that this is determined for each plant.
Some emission factors related to the production of ammonia are shown in Table 2-5.

Nitric acid Production
2 . 9 . 1  O v e r v i e w
The production of nitric acid (HNO3) generates nitrous oxide (N2O) as a by-product of
the high temperature catalytic oxidation of ammonia (NH3).
Nitric acid is used as a raw material mainly in the manufacture of nitrogenous-based
fertiliser.  Nitric acid may also be used in the production of adipic acid and explosives
(e.g., dynamite), for metal etching and in the processing of ferrous metals.
Nitric acid production involves three distinct chemical reactions:
4NH3 + 5O2  →  4NO + 6H2O
2NO + O2  →  2NO2
3NO2 + H2O  →  2HNO3 + NO
Nitrous oxide generation during the production of nitric acid is not well documented.
Nitrogen oxidation steps under overall reducing conditions are considered to be potential
sources of N2O.  Nitric oxide (NO), an intermediate in the production of nitric acid, is
also documented to readily decompose to N2O and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) at high
pressures for a temperature range of 30 to 50°C (Cotton and Wilkinson, 1988).

There are usually only very few plants in each country producing nitric acid, so measured
data on N2O emissions are often available.  These data also take into account the effect
of any abatement technology installed at the specific plants.  Emissions vary significantly
from one plant to another, and if measured data are available, emission estimates should
be based upon such data.  Every effort should therefore be made to obtain measurement
data.
However, if such data are not available, emissions should be calculated from production
data of nitric acid within a country, and specific emission figures based on the actual
technology, for which Table 2-7 can be consulted.  When no measured data exist, specific
emission factors at the upper end of the appropriate range should be chosen.

Nitric acid is produced from the catalytic oxidation of ammonia.  The process is described
in Section 2.9.1 and in the EMEP/CORINAIR Guidebook (under SNAP 40402).  In
addition to the GHGs described in Section 2.9.1, there may be non-combustion emissions
of NOx.
Emissions are estimated from the amount of nitric acid produced.  Factors range from
0. 1- 1.0 NOx/tonnes acid produced for the direct strong acid production process to 10-
20 kg/tonnes acid produced for the low pressure process.  12.0 kg NOx/tonnes nitric acid
should be used where the process and technology details are not known.
There will usually be few nitric acid plants in a country, and it is recommended that
emissions are calculated from plant specific data.

2.10 Adipic Acid Production
2 . 1 0 . 1  O v e r v i e w
Adipic acid is used in the manufacture of a large number of products including synthetic
fibres, coatings, plastics, urethane foams, elastomers and synthetic lubricants.  The
production of Nylon 6.6 accounts for the bulk of adipic acid use.
Adipic acid is a dicarboxylic acid manufactured by a two-stage process.  The first stage of
manufacturing involves the oxidation of cyclohexane or cyclohexanone to form a
cyclohexanone/cyclohexanol mixture.  The mixture is then oxidised by nitric acid in the
presence of a catalyst to form adipic acid.  N2O is generated as a by-product of the nitric
acid oxidation stage:

Adipic acid production also results in the emissions of NMVOC, CO and NOx.  Process
emissions from the production of adipic acid vary substantially with the level of emission
control employed.

Adipic acid production unavoidably produces N2O as a by-product with an associated
emission factor (for unabated emissions) of 300g N2O/kg adipic acid produced (Thiemens
and Trogler, 1991).  Japanese emissions (measured at 264 g N2O/kg adipic acid) are
consistent with this value (Japan Environment Agency, 1995).
N2O emissions (kg)  =  Adipic Acid Production(tonnes)
x  300 kg  N2O/ tonne Adipic Acid
Often, the abatement of N2O results from the treatment of the off-gases4 in a reductive
furnace.  A number of adipic acid producers treat the off-gases with the aim of reducing
NOx emissions, but the treatment also destroys N2O (Reimer et al., 1992).
There is a range of abatement efficiencies attainable with currently available technologies.
Any reduction in N2O emissions due to the installation of abatement systems should be
assessed on a plant-specific basis where possible.

In the production of silicon carbide, CO2 is released as a by-product from a reaction
between quartz and carbon.  Petrol coke is used as a carbon source.  Silicon carbide is
extremely hard and is widely used as an abrasive.  The formula describing the reaction is
given below but in practice it does not proceed in the stoichiometric proportions
indicated.

SiO2 + 3C  →  SiC + 2CO  →  2CO2
Some carbon, about 35 per cent, is sequestered in the product.
Generally, the emissions from silicon carbide production can be calculated from a mass
balance approach as:
CO2 emissions (tonnes)  =  A x C (100-S) x 3.67 x 10-4
where:
