CO2 Emissions from Biomass
P = Potential emissions based on Tier 1 Approach.  A  =  Actual emissions based on Tier 2 Approach.
(1)  For verification purposes, countries are asked to report the results of their calculations using the Reference Approach and explain any differences with the Sectoral Approach.  Do not include the
results of both the Reference Approach and the Sectoral Approach in national totals.
(2)  Please do not provide an estimate of both CO2 emissions and CO2 removals.  You should estimate “net” emissions of CO2 and place a single number in either the CO2 emissions or CO2 removals
column, as appropriate.  Please note that for the purposes of reporting, the signs for uptake are always (-) and for emissions (+).
