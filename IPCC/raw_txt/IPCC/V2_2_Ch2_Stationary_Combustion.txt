2 STATIONARY COMBUSTION 
2.1 
OVERVIEW 
This chapter describes the methods and data necessary to estimate emissions from Stationary Combustion, and 
the categories in which these emissions should be reported. Methods are provided for the sectoral approach in 
three tiers based on: 
• 
Tier 1: fuel combustion from national energy statistics and default emission factors; 
• 
Tier 2: fuel combustion from national energy statistics, together with country-specific emission factors, 
where possible, derived from national fuel characteristics; 
• 
Tier 3: fuel statistics and data on combustion technologies applied together with technology-specific 
emission factors; this includes the use of models and facility level emission data where available. 
The chapter provides default Tier 1 emission factors for all source categories and fuels. The IPCC Emission 
Factor Database1 may be consulted for information appropriate to national circumstances, though the correct use 
of information from the database is the responsibility of greenhouse gas inventory compilers. 
This chapter covers elements formerly presented in the ‘Energy’ chapter of the GPG2000. The organisation of 
the IPCC 2006 Guidelines is different from both the IPCC 1996 Guidelines and the GPG2000. The changes to 
the stationary combustion information are summarised below. 
Content: 
• 
A table detailing which sectors this chapter covers, and which IPCC source codes the emissions are to be 
reported under is included. 
• 
Some of the emission factors have been revised, and some new factors have also been included. The tables 
containing the emission factors indicate which factors are new, and which have been revised from the IPCC 
1996 Guidelines and GPG2000. 
• 
The default oxidation factor is assumed to be 1, unless better information is available. 
• 
In the Tier 1 sectoral approach, the oxidation factor is included with the emission factor, which simplifies 
the worksheet. 
• 
Building on the GPG2000, this chapter includes extended information about uncertainty assessment of both 
the activity data and the emission factors. 
• 
Some definitions have changed or been refined. 
• 
A new section on carbon dioxide capture and storage has been added. 
Structure: 
• 
The methodology for estimating emissions is now subdivided into smaller sections for each Tier approach. 
• 
The tables have been designed to present emission factors for CO2, CH4, and N2O together, where possible. 
2.2 
DESCRIPTION OF SOURCES 
In the Sectoral Approach, emissions from stationary combustion are specified for a number of societal and 
economic activities, defined within the IPCC sector 1A, Fuel Combustion Activities (see Table 2.1). A 
distinction is made between stationary combustion in energy industries (1.A.1), manufacturing industries and 
construction (1.A.2) and other sectors (1.A.4). Although these distinct subsectors are intended to include all 
stationary combustion, an additional category is available in sector 1.A.5 for any emissions that cannot be 
allocated to one of the other subcategories. Table 2.1 also indicates the mobile source categories in 1.A.4 and 
1.A.5 that are treated in Chapter 3 of this Volume.

The category “Manufacturing industries and Construction” has been subdivided using the International Standard 
Industrial Classification6. This industrial classification is widely used in energy statistics. Note that this table 
adds a number of industrial sectors in the category “Manufacturing Industries and Construction” to better align 
to the ISIC definitions and common practice in energy statistics. 
Emissions from autoproducers (public or private undertakings that generate electricity/heat wholly or partly for 
their own use, as an activity that supports their primary activity, see Box 2.1) should be assigned to the sector 
where they were generated and not under 1 A 1 a.

BOX 2.1 
AUTOPRODUCERS 
An autoproducer of electricity and/or heat is an enterprise that, in support of its primary activity, 
generates electricity and/or heat for its own use or for sale, but not as its main business. This 
should be contrasted with main activity producers who generate and sell electricity and/or heat as 
their primary activity. Main activity producers were previously referred to as “Public” electricity 
and heat suppliers, although, as with autoproducers, they might be publicly or privately owned. 
Note that the ownership does not determine the allocation of emissions. 
The IPCC 2006 Guidelines follow the  IPCC 1996 Guidelines  in attributing emissions from 
autoproduction to the industrial or commercial branches in which the generation activity occurred, 
rather than to 1 A 1 a. Category 1 A 1a is for main activity producers only. 
With the complexity of plant activities and inter-relationships, there may not always be a clear 
separation between autoproducers and main activity producers. The most important issue is that all 
facilities be accounted under the most appropriate category and in a complete and consistent 
manner. 
2.3 
METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES 
This section explains how to choose an approach, and summarises the necessary activity data and emission 
factors the inventory compiler will need. These sections are subdivided into Tiers as set out in Volume 1 General 
Guidance. The Tier 1 sections set out the steps needed for the simplest calculation methods, or the methods that 
require the least data. These are likely to provide the least accurate estimates of emissions. The Tier 2 and Tier 3 
approaches require more detailed data and resources (time, expertise and country-specific data) to produce an 
estimate of emissions. Properly applied, the higher tiers should be more accurate. 
2.3.1 
Choice of method 
In general, emissions of each greenhouse gas from stationary sources are calculated by multiplying fuel 
consumption by the corresponding emission factor. In the Sectoral Approach, “Fuel Consumption” is estimated 
from energy use statistics and is measured in terajoules. Fuel consumption data in mass or volume units must 
first be converted into the energy content of these fuels. All tiers described below use the amount of fuel 
combusted as the activity data. Section 1.4.1.2 of the Introduction chapter contains information on how to find 
and apply energy statistics data. Different tiers can be applied for different fuels and gases, consistent with the 
requirements of key category analysis and avoidance of double counting (see also the General Decision Tree in 
section 1.3.1.2). 
2.3.1.1 
TIER 1 APPROACH 
Applying a Tier 1 emission estimate requires the following for each source category and fuel: 
• 
Data on the amount of fuel combusted in the source category 
• 
A default emission factor 
Emission factors come from the default values provided together with associated uncertainty range in Section 
2.3.2.1. The following equation is used: 
EQUATION 2.1 
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM STATIONARY COMBUSTION

Where: 
EmissionsGHG ,fuel

Fuel Consumptionfuel 
=  amount of fuel combusted (TJ) 
Emission FactorGHG,fuel           =  default emission factor of a given GHG by type of fuel (kg gas/TJ). For 
CO2, it includes the carbon oxidation factor, assumed to be 1. 
Volume 2: Energy 
2.12 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
To calculate the total emissions by gas from the source category, the emissions as calculated in Equation 2.1 are 
summed over all fuels:

2.3.1.2 
TIER 2 APPROACH 
Applying a Tier 2 approach requires: 
• 
Data on the amount of fuel combusted in the source category; 
• 
A country-specific emission factor for the source category and fuel for each gas. 
Under Tier 2, the Tier 1 default emission factors in Equation 2.1 are replaced by country-specific emission 
factors. Country-specific emission factors can be developed by taking into account country-specific data, for 
example carbon contents of the fuels used, carbon oxidation factors, fuel quality and (for non-CO2 gases in 
particular) the state of technological development. The emission factors may vary over time and, for solid fuels, 
should take into account the amount of carbon retained in the ash, which may also vary with time. It is good 
practice to compare any country-specific emission factor with the default ones given in Tables 2.2 to 2.5. If such 
country-specific emission factors are outside the 95 percent confidence intervals, given for the default values, an 
explanation should be sought and provided on why the value is significantly different from the default value.  
A country-specific emission factor can be identical to the default one, or it may differ. Since the country-specific 
value should be more applicable to a given country’s situation, it is expected that the uncertainty range 
associated with a country-specific value will be smaller than the uncertainty range of the default emission factor. 
This expectation should mean that a Tier 2 estimate provides an emission estimate with lower uncertainty than a 
Tier 1 estimate. 
Emissions can be also estimated as the product of fuel consumption on a mass or volume basis, and an emission 
factor expressed on a compatible basis. For example, the use of activity data expressed in mass unit is relevant 
when the Tier 2 approach described in Chapter 5 of Volume 5 is used alternatively to estimate emissions that 
arise when waste is incinerated for energy purposes.  
2.3.1.3 
TIER 3 APPROACH 
The Tier 1 and Tier 2 approaches of estimating emissions described in the previous sections necessitate using an 
average emission factor for a source category and fuel combination throughout the source category. In reality, 
emissions depend on the: 
• 
fuel type used, 
• 
combustion technology, 
• 
operating conditions, 
• 
control technology, 
• 
quality of maintenance, 
• 
age of the equipment used to burn the fuel. 
In a Tier 3 approach this is taken into account by splitting the fuel combustion statistics over the different 
possibilities and using emission factors that are dependent upon these differences. In Equation 2.3, this is 
indicated by making the variables and parameters technology dependent. Technology here stands for any device, 
combustion process or fuel property that might influence the emissions.

When the amount of fuel combusted for a certain technology is not directly known, it can be estimated by means 
of models. For example, a simple model for this is based on the penetration of the technology into the source 
category.

differences in utilisation between technologies. 
To calculate the emissions of a gas for a source category, the result of Equation 2.3 must be summed over all 
technologies applied in the source category.

Total emissions are again calculated by summing over all fuels (Equation 2.2). 
Application of a Tier 3 emission estimation approach requires: 
• 
Data on the amount of fuel combusted in the source category for each relevant technology (fuel type used, 
combustion technology, operating conditions, control technology, and maintenance and age of the 
equipment). 
• 
A specific emission factor for each technology (fuel type used, combustion technology, operating conditions, 
control technology, oxidation factor, and maintenance and age of the equipment). 
• 
Facility level measurements can also be used when available. 
Using a Tier 3 approach to estimate emissions of CO2 is often unnecessary because emissions of CO2 do not 
depend on the combustion technology. However, plant-specific data on CO2 emissions are increasingly available 
and they are of increasing interest because of the possibilities for emissions trading. Plant-specific data can be 
based on fuel flow measurements and fuel chemistry or on flue gas flow measurements and flue gas chemistry 
data. Continuous emissions monitoring (CEM) of flue gases is generally not justified for accurate measurement 
of CO2 emissions alone (because of the comparatively high cost) but could be undertaken particularly when 
monitors are installed for measurement of other pollutants such as SO2 or NOx. Continuous emissions 
monitoring is also particularly useful for combustion of solid fuels where it is more difficult to measure fuel flow 
rates, or when fuels are highly variable, or fuel analysis is otherwise expensive. Rigorous, continuous monitoring 
is required to provide a comprehensive accounting of emissions. Care is required when continuous emissions 
monitoring of some facilities is used but monitoring data are not available for a full reporting category. 
Continuous emissions monitoring requires attention to quality assurance and quality control. This includes 
certification of the monitoring system, re-certification after any changes in the system, and assurance of 
continuous operation8. For CO2 measurements, data from CEM systems can be compared with emissions 
estimates based on fuel flows. 
                                                           
7 Fuel consumption could be expressed on a mass or volume basis, and emissions can be estimated as the product of fuel 
consumption and an emission factor expressed on a compatible basis.  
8 See for example: U.S. EPA (2005a). 
Volume 2: Energy 
2.14 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
If detailed monitoring shows that the concentration of a greenhouse gas in the discharge from a combustion 
process is equal to or less than the concentration of the same gas in the ambient intake air to the combustion 
process, then emissions may be reported as zero. Reporting these emissions as “negative emissions” would 
require continuous high quality monitoring of both the air intake and the atmospheric emissions.  
2.3.1.4 
DECISION TREES 
The tier used to estimate emissions will depend on the quantity and quality of data that are available. If a 
category is key, it is good practice to estimate emissions using a Tier 2 or Tier 3 approach. The decision tree 
(Figure 2.1) below will help in selecting which tier should be used to estimate emissions from sources of 
stationary combustion. 
To use a decision tree correctly, the inventory compiler needs to undertake a thorough survey of available 
national activity data and national or regional emission factor data, by relevant source category. This survey 
needs to be completed before the first inventory is compiled, and the results of the survey should be reviewed 
regularly. It is good practice to improve the data quality if an initial calculation with a Tier 1 approach indicates 
a key source, or if an estimate is associated with a high level of uncertainty. The decision tree and key source 
category determination should be applied to CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions separately. 
2.3.2 
Choice of emission factors 
This section provides default emission factors for CO2, CH4 and N2O, and discusses provision of emission 
factors at higher Tiers. CO2 emission factors for all Tiers reflect the full carbon content of the fuel less any non-
oxidised fraction of carbon retained in the ash, particulates or soot. Since this fraction is usually small, the Tier 1 
default emission factors derived in Chapter 1 of this Volume neglect this effect by assuming a complete 
oxidation of the carbon contained in the fuel (carbon oxidation factor equal to 1). For some solid fuels, this 
fraction will not necessarily be negligible, and higher Tier estimates can be applied. Where this is known to be 
the case it is good practice to use country-specific values, based on measurements or other well documented data. 
The Emission Factor Database (EFDB) provides a variety of well-documented emission factors and other 
parameters that may be better suited to national circumstances than the default values, although the responsibility 
to ensure appropriate application of material from the database remains with the inventory compiler.  
2.3.2.1 
TIER 1 
This section presents for each of the fuels used in stationary sources a set of default emission factors for use in 
Tier 1 emission estimates for the source categories. In a number of source categories, the same fuels are used. 
These will have the same emission factors for CO2. The derivation of the CO2 emission factors is presented in the 
Introduction chapter of this Volume. Emission factors for CO2 are in units of kg CO2/TJ on a net calorific value 
basis and reflect the carbon content of the fuel and the assumption that the carbon oxidation factor is 1. 
Emission factors for CH4 and N2O for different source categories differ due to differences in combustion 
technologies applied in the different source categories. The default factors presented for Tier 1 apply to 
technologies without emission controls. The default emission factors, particularly those in Tables 2.2 and 2.3, 
assume effective combustion in high temperature. They are applicable for steady and optimal conditions and do 
not take into account the impact of start-ups, shut downs or combustion with partial loads. 
Default emission factors for stationary combustion are given in Tables 2.2 to 2.5. The CO2 emission factors are 
the same ones as presented in Table 1.4 of the Introduction chapter. The emission factors for CH4 and N2O are 
based on the IPCC 1996 Guidelines. These emission factors were established using the expert judgement of a 
large group of inventory experts and are still considered valid. Since not many measurements of these types of 
emission factors are available, the uncertainty ranges are set at plus or minus a factor of three. Tables 2.2 to 2.5 
do not provide default emission factors for CH4 and N2O emissions from combustion by off-road machinery that 
are reported in the 1A category. These emission factors are provided in Section 3.3 of this Volume.

Volume 2: Energy 
2.24 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
2.3.2.2 
TIER 2 COUNTRY-SPECIFIC EMISSION FACTORS 
Good practice is to use the most disaggregated, technology-specific and country-specific emission factors 
available, particularly those derived from direct measurements at the different stationary combustion sources. 
When using the Tier 2 approach, two possible types of emission factors exist:  
• 
National emission factors: These emission factors may be developed by national programmes already 
measuring emissions of indirect greenhouse gases such as NOx, CO and NMVOCs for local air quality;  
• 
Regional emission factors. 
Chapter 2 of Volume 1 provides general guidance for acquiring and compiling information from different 
sources, specific guidance for generating new data (Section 2.2.3) and generic guidance on emission factors 
(Section 2.2.4). When measurements are used to obtain emission factors, it is good practice to test a reasonable 
number of sources representing the average conditions in the country including fuel type and composition, type 
and size of the combustion unit, firing conditions, load, type of control technologies and maintenance level. 
2.3.2.3 
TIER 3 TECHNOLOGY-SPECIFIC EMISSION FACTORS 
Due to the nature of the emissions of non-CO2 greenhouse gases, technology-specific emission factors are 
needed for Tier 3. Tables 2.6 to 2.10 give, for example purposes, give representative emission factors for CH4 
and N2O by main technology and fuel type. National experts working on detailed bottom-up inventories may use 
these factors as a starting point or for comparison. They show uncontrolled emission factors for each of the 
technologies indicated. These emission factor data, therefore, do not include the level of control technology that 
might be in place in some countries. For instance, for use in countries where control policies have significantly 
influenced the emission profile, either the individual factors or the final estimate will need to be adjusted. 
2.3.3 
Choice of activity data 
For Stationary Combustion, the activity data for all tiers are the amounts and types of fuel combusted. Most fuels 
consumers (enterprises, small commercial consumers, or households) normally pay for the solid, liquid and 
gaseous fuels they consume. Therefore, the masses or volumes of fuels they consume are measured or metered. 
Quantities of carbon dioxide can normally be easily calculated from fuel consumption data and the carbon 
contents of the fuels, taking into account the fraction of carbon unoxidised. 
The quantities of non-CO2 greenhouse gases formed during combustion depend on the combustion technology 
used, and therefore detailed statistics on fuel combustion technology are needed to rigorously estimate emissions 
of non-CO2 greenhouse gases. 
The amount and types of fuel combusted are obtained from one, or a combination, of the sources in the list 
below: 
• 
national energy statistics agencies (national energy statistics agencies may collect data on the amount and 
types of fuel combusted from individual enterprises that consume fuels) 
• 
reports provided by enterprises to national energy statistics agencies (these reports are most likely to be 
produced by the operators or owners of large combustion plants) 
• 
reports provided by enterprises to regulatory agencies (for example, reports produced to demonstrate how 
enterprises are complying with emission control regulations) 
• 
individuals within the enterprise responsible for the combustion equipment 
• 
periodic surveys, by statistical agencies, of the types and quantities of fuels consumed by a sample of 
enterprises 
• 
suppliers of fuels (who may record the quantities of fuels delivered to their customers, and may also record 
the identity of their customers usually as an economic activity code).

There are a number of points of good practice that inventory compilers should follow when they collect and use 
fuel consumption data. It is good practice to use, where possible, the quantities of fuel combusted rather than the 
quantities of fuel delivered. 9  Agencies collecting emission data from companies under an environmental 
reporting regulation may request fuel combustion data on this basis. For further information on the general 
framework for the derivation or review of activity data, check Chapter 2, Approaches to Data Collection, in 
Volume 1. 
Due to the technology-specific nature of emissions of non-CO2 greenhouse gases, detailed fuel combustion 
technology statistics are needed in order to provide rigorous emission estimates. It is good practice to collect 
activity data in units of fuel used, and to disaggregate as far as possible into the share of fuel used by major 
technology types. Disaggregation can be achieved through a bottom-up survey of fuel consumption and 
combustion technology, or through top-down allocations based on expert judgement and statistical sampling. 
Specialised statistical offices or ministerial departments are generally in charge of regular data collection and 
handling. Including representatives from these departments in the inventory process is likely to facilitate the 
acquisition of appropriate activity data. For some source categories (e.g. combustion in the Agriculture Sector), 
there may be some difficulty in separating fuel used in stationary equipment from fuel used in mobile machinery. 
Given the different emission factors for non-CO2 gases of these two sources, good practice is to derive shares of 
energy use of each of these sources by using indirect data (e.g. number of pumps, average consumption, needs 
for water pumping etc.). Expert judgement and information available from other countries may also be relevant.  
Good practice for electricity autoproduction (self-generation) is to assign emissions to the source categories (or 
sub-source categories) where they were generated and to identify them separately from those associated with 
other end-uses such as process heat. In many countries, the statistics related to autoproduction are available and 
regularly updated, so activity data should not represent a serious obstacle to estimating non-CO2 emissions. 
Where confidentiality is an issue, direct discussion with the company affected often allows the data to be used. 
Otherwise aggregation of the fuel consumption or emissions with those from other companies is usually 
sufficient. For further information on dealing with restricted data sources or confidentiality issues, check Chapter 
2, Approaches to Data Collection, in Volume 1. 
 
 
                                                           
9 Quantities of solid and liquid fuels delivered to enterprises will, in general, differ from quantities combusted. This 
difference is normally the amount put into or taken from stocks held by the enterprise. Stock figures shown in national fuel 
balances may not include stocks held by final consumers, or may include only stocks held by a particular source category 
(for example electricity producers). Delivery figures may also include quantities used for mobile sources or as feedstock.

2.3.3.1 
TIER 1 AND TIER 2 
The activity data used in a Tier 1 approach for combustion in the energy sector are derived from energy statistics, 
compiled by the national statistical agency. Comparable statistics are published by the International Energy 
Agency (IEA), based on national returns. If national data are not directly available to the national inventory 
compiler, a request could be sent to the IEA at stats@iea.org to receive the country’s data free of charge. 
Primary data on fuel consumption are normally collected in mass or in volume units. Because the carbon content 
of fuels is generally correlated with the energy content, and because the energy content of fuels is generally 
measured, it is recommended to convert values for fuel consumption into energy units. Default values for the 
conversion of fuel consumption numbers into conventional energy units are given in section 1.4.1.2. 
Information on energy statistics and balances methodology is available in the "Energy Statistics Manual" 
published by the IEA. This manual can be downloaded free of charge from www.iea.org. Key issues about more 
important source categories are given below. 
Volume 2: Energy 
2.30 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
ENERGY INDUSTRIES 
In energy industries, fossil fuels are both raw materials for the conversion processes, and sources of energy to 
run these processes. The energy industry comprises three kinds of activities: 
1 
Primary fuel production (e.g. coal mining and oil and gas extraction); 
2 
Conversion to secondary or tertiary fossil fuels (e.g. crude oil to petroleum products in refineries, coal 
to coke and coke oven gas in coke ovens); 
3 
Conversion to non-fossil energy vectors (e.g. from fossil fuel into electricity and/or heat). 
Emissions from combustion during production and conversion processes are counted under energy industries. 
Emissions from the secondary fuels produced by the energy industries are counted in the sector where they are 
used. When collecting activity data, it is essential to distinguish between the fuel that is combusted and the fuel 
that is converted into a secondary or tertiary fuel in Energy Industries. 
MAIN ACTIVITY ELECTRICITY AND HEAT PRODUCTION 
The main activity electricity and heat production (formerly known as public electricity and heat production) 
converts the chemical energy stored in the fuels to either electrical power (counted under electricity generation) 
or heat (counted under heat production) or both (counted under combined heat and power, CHP); see Table 2.1. 
Figure 2.2 shows the energy flows. In conventional power plants, the total energy losses to the environment 
might be as high as 70 percent of the chemical energy in the fuels, depending on the fuel and the specific 
technology. In a modern high efficiency power plant, losses are down to about half of the chemical energy 
contained in the fuels. In a combined heat and power plant most of the energy in the fuel is delivered to final 
users, either as electricity or as heat (for industrial processes or residential heating or similar uses). The width of 
the arrows roughly represents the relative magnitude of the energy flows involved.

PETROLEUM REFINING 
In a petroleum refinery, crude oil is converted to a broad range of products (Figure 2.3). For this transformation 
to occur, part of the energy content of the products obtained from crude oil is used in the refinery (See Table 
2.1.). This complicates the derivation of activity data from energy statistics.  
Figure 2.3 
A refinery uses energy to transform crude oil into petroleum products. 
 
In principle all petroleum products are combustible as fuel to provide the process heat and steam needed for the 
refining processes. The petroleum products include a broad range from the heavy products like tar, bitumen, 
heavy fuel oils via the middle distillates like gas oils, naphtha, diesel oils, kerosenes to light products like motor 
gasoline, LPG and refinery gas. 
In many cases, the exact products and fuels used in refineries to produce the heat and steam needed to run the 
refinery processes are not easily derived from the energy statistics. The fuel combusted within petroleum 
refineries typically amounts to 6 to 10 percent of the total fuel input to the refinery, depending on the complexity 
and vintage of the technology. It is good practice to ask the refinery industry for fuel consumption in order to 
select or verify the appropriate values reported by energy statistics. 
MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES AND CONSTRUCTION 
In manufacturing industries, raw materials are converted into products as is schematically presented in Figure 2.4. 
For construction, the same principle holds: the inputs include the building materials and the outputs are the 
buildings. 
Manufacturing industries are generally classified according to the nature of their products. This is done via the 
International Standard Industrial Classification of economic activities that is used in Table 2.1 for convenient 
cross-referencing.  
Figure 2.4 
Fuels are used as an energy source in manufacturing industries to convert 
raw materials into products.10

2.32 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Raw materials used in manufacturing industries can also include fossil fuels. Examples include production of 
petrochemicals (eg methanol), other bulk chemicals (eg ammonia) and primary iron where coke is an input. In 
some cases, the situation is more complicated, because the energy to drive the process might be directly 
delivered from the chemical reactions of the manufacturing processes. An example of this is the manufacture of 
primary iron and steel, where the chemical reaction between the coke and the iron ore produces gas and heat that 
are sufficient to run the process11. The reporting of emissions from gases obtained from processing feedstock and 
process fuels obtained directly from the feedstock (e.g. ammonia production) follows the principle stated in 
Section 1.2 of this Volume and detailed guidance given in the IPPU Volume. In summary, if the emissions occur 
in the IPPU source category which produced the gases emitted they remain as industrial processes emissions in 
that source category. If the gases are exported to another source category in the IPPU sector, or to the energy 
sector, then the fugitive, combustion or other emissions associated with them should be reported in the sector 
where they occur. Inventory compilers are reminded to discriminate between emissions from processes where 
the same fossil fuel is used both for energy and for feedstock purposes (e.g. synthesis gas production, carbon 
black production), and to report these emissions in the correct sectors. 
Some countries may face some difficulties in obtaining disaggregated activity data or may have different 
definitions for industrial source categories. For example, some countries may include residential energy 
consumption of the workers in industry consumption. In this case, any deviations from the definitions should be 
documented. 
2.3.3.2 
TIER 3 
Tier 3 estimates incorporate data at the level of individual facilities, and this type of information is increasingly 
available, because of the requirements of emissions trading schemes. It is often the case, that coverage of facility 
level data does not correspond exactly to coverage of classifications within the national energy statistics, and this 
can give rise to difficulties in combining the various sources of information. Methods for combining data are 
discussed in Chapter 2 of Volume 1 on General Guidance and Reporting. 
2.3.3.3 
AVOIDING DOUBLE COUNTING ACTIVITY DATA WITH 
OTHER SECTORS 
The use of fuel combustion statistics rather than fuel delivery statistics is key to avoid double counting in 
emission estimates. Fuel combustion data, however, are very seldom complete, since it is not practical to 
measure the fuel consumption or emissions of every residential or commercial source. Hence, national 
inventories using this approach will generally contain a mixture of combustion data for larger sources and 
delivery data for other sources. The inventory compiler must take care to avoid both double counting and 
omission of emissions when combining data from multiple sources. 
When activity data are not quantities of fuel combusted but are instead deliveries to enterprises or main 
subcategories, there is a risk of double counting emissions from the IPPU or Waste Sectors. Identifying double 
counting is not always easy. Fuels delivered and used in certain processes may give rise to by-products used as 
fuels elsewhere in the plant or sold for fuel use to third parties (e.g. blast furnace gas that is derived from coke 
and other carbon inputs to blast furnaces). It is good practice to coordinate estimates between the stationary 
source category and relevant industrial categories to avoid double counting or omissions. Some of the categories 
and subcategories where fossil fuel carbon is reported and between which double counting of fossil fuel carbon 
could, in principle, occur are summarized below. 
• 
IPPU – Production of non-fuel products from energy feedstocks such as coke, ethane, gas/diesel oil, LPG, 
naphtha and natural gas. 
The production of synthesis gas (syngas), namely the mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, through 
steam reforming or partial oxidation of energy feedstocks deserves particular attention since these processes 
produce CO2 emissions. Synthesis gas is an intermediate in the production of chemicals such as ammonia, 
formaldehyde, methanol, pure carbon monoxide and pure hydrogen. Emissions from these processes should 
be accounted for in the IPPU sector. Note that CO2 emissions should be counted at the point of emission if 
the gas is stored for only a short time (e.g. CO2 used in the food and drink industry generated as a by product 
of ammonia production). 
                                                           
11 The best available techniques reference documents (BREFs) of the European Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control 
Bureau (IPPC) for Iron and Steel (http://eippcb.jrc.es/) show that about one third of the heat requirement for the process 
comes from the blast furnace gas produced and combusted in the blast air heaters. Also the heat produced by the 
production of CO as the blast air passes over the coke is not strictly part of the reduction of the ore. 
 
Chapter 2: Stationary Combustion 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
2.33 
Synthesis gas is also produced by partial oxidation/gasification of solid and liquid fuel feedstocks in the 
relatively newer Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) technology for power generation. When 
synthesis gas is produced in IGCC for the purpose of generating power, associated emissions should be 
accounted for in 1A, fuel combustion. 
In the production of carbides, CO2 is released when carbon-rich fuels, particularly petroleum coke, are used 
as a carbon source. These emissions should be accounted for in the IPPU sector. 
For further information, refer to Volume 3, which gives details of completeness check of carbon emissions 
from feedstock and other non-energy use. 
• 
IPPU, AFOLU – Use of carbon as reducing agent in metal production 
The greenhouse gas emissions originating from the use of coal, coke, natural gas, prebaked anodes and coal 
electrodes as reducing agents in the commercial production of metals from ores should be accounted for in 
the IPPU sector. Wood chips and charcoal may also be used in some of the processes. In this case, the 
resulting emissions are counted in the AFOLU sector. By-product fuels (coke oven gas and blast furnace gas) 
are produced in some of these processes. These fuels may be sold or used within the plant. They may or may 
not be included in the national energy balance. Care should consequently be taken not to double count 
emissions. 
• 
ENERGY, WASTE – methane from coal mine waste, landfill gas and sewage gas 
In these cases, it is important to ensure that the amounts of fuel accounted for in stationary combustion are 
the same as the quantities netted out from “Fugitive emissions from coal mining and handling”, “Waste 
Incineration” and “Wastewater Treatment and Discharge” respectively. 
• 
WASTE – Incineration of waste 
When energy is recovered from waste combustion, the associated greenhouse gas emissions are accounted 
for in the Energy sector under stationary combustion. Waste incineration with no associated energy purposes 
should be reported in the Waste source category; see Chapter 5 (Incineration and Open Burning of Waste) of 
Volume 5. It is good practice to assess the content of waste and differentiate between the part containing 
plastics and other fossil carbon materials from the biogenic part and estimate the associated emissions 
accordingly. The CO2 emission from the fossil-carbon part can be included in the fuel category Other fuels, 
while the CO2 emissions from the biomass part should be reported as an information item. For higher tier 
estimations, inventory compiler may refer to Chapter 5 of the Waste Volume. It is good practice to contact 
those responsible for recovering used oils in order to assess the extent to which used oils are burned in the 
country and estimate and report these emissions in the Energy sector if they are used as fuel.  
• 
ENERGY – Mobile combustion 
The main issue is to ensure that double counting of agricultural and off-road vehicles is avoided. 
2.3.3.4 
TREATMENT OF BIOMASS 
Biomass is a special case:  
• 
Emissions of CO2 from biomass fuels are estimated and reported in the AFOLU sector as part of the 
AFOLU methodology. In the reporting tables, emissions from combustion of biofuels are reported as 
information items but not included in the sectoral or national totals to avoid double counting. In the emission 
factor tables presented in this chapter, default CO2 emission factors are presented to enable the user to 
estimate these information items.  
• 
For biomass, only that part of the biomass that is combusted for energy purposes should be estimated for 
inclusion as an information item in the Energy sector. 
• 
The emissions of CH4 and N2O, however, are estimated and included in the sector and national totals 
because their effect is in addition to the stock changes estimated in the AFOLU sector. 
• 
For fuel wood, activity data are available from the IEA or the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organisation of 
the United Nations). These data originate from national sources and inventory compilers can obtain a better 
understanding of national circumstances by contacting national statistical agencies to find the organisations 
involved. 
• 
For agricultural crop residues (part of other primary solid biomass) and also for fuel wood, estimation 
methods for activity data are available in Chapter 5 of the AFOLU volume.  
Volume 2: Energy 
2.34 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
• 
In some instances, biofuels will be combusted jointly with fossil fuels. In this case, the split between the 
fossil and non-fossil fraction of the fuel should be established and the emission factors applied to the 
appropriate fractions. 
2.3.4 
Carbon dioxide capture 
Capture and storage removes carbon dioxide from the gas streams that would otherwise be emitted to the 
atmosphere, and transfers it for indefinite long term storage in geological reservoirs, such as depleted oil and gas 
fields or deep saline aquifers. In the energy sector, candidates for carbon dioxide capture and storage 
undertakings include large stationary sources such as power stations and natural gas sweetening units. This 
chapter deals only with CO2 capture associated with combustion activities, particularly those relative to power 
plants. Fugitive emissions arising from the transfer of carbon dioxide from the point of capture to the geological 
storage, and emissions from the storage site itself, are covered in Chapter 5 of this Volume. Other possibilities 
also exist in industry to capture CO2 from process streams. These are covered in Volume 3. 
There are three main approaches for capturing CO2 arising from the combustion of fossil fuels and/or biomass 
(Figure 2.5). Post-combustion capture refers to the removal of CO2 from flue gases produced by combustion of a 
fuel (oil, coal, natural gas or biomass) in air. Pre-combustion capture involves the production of synthesis gas 
(syngas), namely the mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, by reacting energy feedstocks with steam 
and/or oxygen or air. The resulting carbon monoxide is reacted with steam by the shift reaction to produce CO2 
and more hydrogen. The stream leaving the shift reactor is separated into a high purity CO2 stream and H2-rich 
fuel that can be used in many applications, such as boilers, gas turbines and fuel cells.  
Oxy-fuel combustion uses either almost pure oxygen or a mixture of almost pure oxygen and a CO2-rich 
recycled flue gas instead of air for fuel combustion. The flue gas contains mainly H2O and CO2 with excess 
oxygen required to ensure complete combustion of the fuel. It will also contain any other components in the fuel, 
any diluents in the oxygen stream supplied, any inert matter in the fuel and from air leakage into the system from 
the atmosphere. The net flue gas, after cooling to condense water vapour, contains from about 80 to 98 percent 
CO2 depending on the fuel used and the particular oxy-fuel combustion process.  
Figure 2.5 
CO2 capture systems from stationary combustion sources 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Carbon dioxide capture has some energy requirements with a corresponding increase in fossil fuel consumption. 
Also the capture process is less than 100 percent efficient, so a fraction of CO2 will still be emitted from the gas 
stream. Chapter 3 of the IPCC Special Report on CO2 Capture and Storage (Thambimuthu et al., 2005) provides 
a thorough overview of the current and emerging technologies for capturing CO2 from different streams arising 
in the energy and the industrial processes sectors.

The general scheme concerning the carbon flows in the three approaches for capturing CO2 from streams arising 
in combustion processes is depicted in Figure 2.6. The system boundary considered in this chapter includes the 
power plant or other process of interest, the CO2 removal unit and compression/dehydration of the captured CO2 
but does not include CO2 transport and storage systems. This general scheme also contemplates the possibility 
that pre-combustion capture systems can also be applied to multi-product plants (also known as polygeneration 
plants). The type of polygeneration plant considered in this chapter employs fossil fuel feedstocks to produce 
electricity and/or heat plus a variety of co-products such as hydrogen, chemicals and liquid fuels. In those 
processes associated with post-combustion and oxyfuel combustion capture systems, no carbonaceous co-
products are typically produced.

The CO2 capture efficiency of any system represented in Figure 2.6 is given in Equation 2.6. Table 2.11 
summarises estimates of CO2 capture efficiencies for post and pre-combustion systems of interest that have been 
recently reported in several studies. This information is provided for illustrative purposes only as it is good 
practice to use measured data on volume captured rather than efficiency factors to estimate emissions from a 
CO2 capture installation.

TIER 3 CO 2 EMISSION ESTIMATES 
Because this is an emerging technology, it requires plant-specific reporting at Tier 3. Plants, with capture and 
storage will most probably meter the amount of gas removed by the gas stream and transferred to geological 
storage. Capture efficiencies derived from the measured data can be compared with the values in Table 2.11 as a 
verification cross-check.  
Under Tier 3, the CO2 emissions are therefore estimated from the fuel consumption estimated as described in 
earlier sections of this chapter minus the metered amount removed.

This method automatically takes into account any increase in energy consumption at the plant because of the 
capture process (since this will be reflected in the fuel statistics), and it does not require independent estimation 
of the capture efficiency, since the residual emissions are estimated more accurately by the subtraction. If the 
plant is supplied with biofuels, the corresponding CO2 emissions will be zero (these are already included in 
national totals due to their treatment in the AFOLU sector), so the subtraction of the amount of gas transferred to 
long-term storage may give negative emissions. This is correct since if the biomass carbon is permanently stored, 
it is being removed from the atmosphere. The corollary of this is that any subsequent emissions from CO2 
transport, CO2 injection and the storage reservoir itself should be counted in national total emissions, irrespective 
of whether the carbon originates from fossil sources or recent biomass production. This is why in sections 5.3 
(CO2 transport), 5.4 (Injection) and 5.5 (Geological Storage) no reference is made to the origin of the CO2 stored 
in underground reservoirs. The metering for the amount removed should be installed in line with industrial 
practice and will normally be accurate to about 1 percent.  
Quantities of CO2 for later use and short-term storage should not be deducted from CO2 emissions except when 
the CO2 emissions are accounted for elsewhere in the inventory12. 
2.3.5 
Completeness 
A complete estimate of emissions from fuel combustion should include emissions from all fuels and all source 
categories identified within the IPCC 2006 Guidelines. Completeness should be established by using the same 
underlying activity data to estimate emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O from the same source categories.  
All fuels delivered by fuel producers must be accounted for. Misclassification of enterprises and the use of 
distributors to supply small commercial customers and households increase the chance of systematic errors in the 
allocation of fuel delivery statistics. Where sample survey data that provide figures for fuel consumption by 
specific economic sectors exist, the figures may be compared with the corresponding delivery data. Any 
systematic difference should be identified and the adjustment to the allocation of delivery data may then be made 
accordingly. 
Systematic under-reporting of solid and liquid fuels may also occur if final consumers import fuels directly. 
Direct imports will be included in customs data and therefore in fuel supply statistics, but not in the statistics of 
fuel deliveries provided by national suppliers. If direct importing by consumers is significant, then the statistical 
difference between supplies and deliveries will reveal the magnitude. Own use of fuels supplied by dedicated 
mines may occur in such sectors of manufacturing as iron and steel and cement, and is also a potential source of 
under-reporting. Once again, a comparison with consumption survey results will reveal which main source 
categories are involved in direct importing. Concerning biomass fuels, the national energy statistics agencies 
should be consulted about their use, including possible use of non-commercially traded biomass fuels. 
Experience has shown that some activities such as change in producer stocks of fossil fuels and own fuel 
combustion by energy industries may be poorly covered in existing inventories. This also applies to statistics on 
biomass fuels and from waste combustion. Their presence should be specifically checked with statistical 
agencies, sectoral experts and organisations as well as supplementary sources of data included if necessary. 
Chapter 2 of Volume 1 covers data collection in general. 
2.3.6 
Developing a consistent time series and recalculation 
Using a consistent method to estimate emissions is the main mechanism for ensuring time series consistency. 
However, the variability in fuel quality over time is also important to consider within the limits of the national 
fuel characterisation or the fuel types listed in Tables 2.2 to 2.5. This includes variation in carbon content, 
typically reflected in variation in the calorific values used to convert the fuels from mass or volume units to the 
energy units used in the estimation. It is good practice for inventory compilers to check that variations of 
calorific values over time are in fact reflected in the information used to construct the national energy statistics. 
                                                           
12 Examples include urea production (Volume 3, section 3.2) and the use of CO2 in methanol production (Volume 3, section 
3.9) where the CO2 due to the final products is accounted for. 
Volume 2: Energy 
2.38 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Application of these IPCC 2006 Guidelines may result in revisions in some components of the emissions 
inventory, such as emissions factors or the sectoral classification of some emissions. For example, the 
component of emissions of CO2 from non-fuel use of fossil fuels will move from the Energy Sector under the 
IPCC 1996  Guidelines to the IPPU sector under the IPCC 2006 Guidelines. Whereas the IPCC 1996 Guidelines 
for the energy sector estimated total potential emissions from fossil-fuel use and then subtracted the portion of 
the carbon that ended up stored in long-lived products, the IPCC 2006 Guidelines include all non-fuel uses in the 
IPPU sector. This should result in slightly decreased CO2 emissions reported from the Energy sector and 
increased emissions reported in the IPPU sector. For further information on ensuring a consistent time series, 
check Chapter 5, Time Series Consistency, in Volume 1. 
2.4 
UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT 
2.4.1 
Emission factor uncertainties 
For fossil fuel combustion, uncertainties in CO2 emission factors are relatively low. These emission factors are 
determined by the carbon content of the fuel and thus there are physical constraints on the magnitude of their 
uncertainty. However, it is important to note there are likely to be intrinsic differences in the uncertainties of 
CO2 emission factors of petroleum products, coal and natural gas. Petroleum products typically conform to fairly 
tight specifications which limit the possible range of carbon content and calorific value, and are also sourced 
from a relatively small number of refineries and/or import terminals. Coal by contrast may be sourced from 
mines producing coals with a very wide range of carbon contents and calorific values and is mostly supplied 
under contract to users who adapt their equipment to match the characteristics of the particular coal. Hence at the 
national level, the single energy commodity "black coal" can have a range of CO2 emission factors. 
Emission factors for CH4 and especially N2O are highly uncertain. High uncertainties in emission factors may be 
ascribed to lack of relevant measurements and subsequent generalisations, uncertainties in measurements, or an 
insufficient understanding of the emission generating process. Furthermore, due to stochastic variations in 
process conditions, a high variability of the real time emission factors for these gases might also occur (Pulles 
and Heslinga, 2004). Such variability obviously will also contribute to the uncertainty in the emission estimates. 
The uncertainties of emission factors are seldom known or accessible from empirical data. Consequently, 
uncertainties are customarily derived from indirect sources or by means of expert judgements. The IPCC 1996 
Guidelines (Table A1-1, Vol. I, p. A1.4) suggest an overall uncertainty value of 7 per cent for the CO2 emission 
factors of Energy.  
The default uncertainties shown in Table 2.12 derived from the EMEP/CORINAIR Guidebook ratings 
(EMEP/CORINAIR, 1999) may be used in the absence of country-specific estimates.

While these default uncertainties can be used for the existing emission factors (whether country-specific or taken 
from the IPCC Guidelines), there may be additional uncertainties associated with applying emission factors that 
are not representative of the combustion conditions in the country. Uncertainties can be lower than the values in 
Table 2.12 if country-specific emission factors are used. It is good practice to obtain estimates of these 
uncertainties from national experts taking into account the guidance concerning expert judgements provided in 
Volume 1. 
There is currently relatively little experience in assessing and compiling inventory uncertainties and more 
experience is needed to assess whether the few available results are typical and comparable, and what the main 
weaknesses in such analyses are. Some articles addressing uncertainty assessment of greenhouse inventories 
have recently appeared in the peer-reviewed literature. Rypdal and Winiwater (2001) evaluated the uncertainties 
in greenhouse gas inventories and compared the results reported by five countries namely Austria (Winiwarter 
and Rypdal, 2001), the Netherlands (van Amstel et al., 2000), Norway (Rypdal, 1999), UK (Baggott et al., 2005) 
 
Chapter 2: Stationary Combustion 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
2.39 
and USA (EIA, 1999). More recently, Monni et al. (2004) evaluated the uncertainties in the Finnish greenhouse 
gas emission inventory. 
Tables 2.13 and 2.14 summarise the uncertainty assessments of emission factors for stationary combustion 
reported in the studies noted above. To complement this information, the approaches and emission factors used 
by each country as (reported in the corresponding 2003 National Greenhouse Gas Inventory submission to the 
UNFCCC) have been added to Tables 2.13 and 2.14. It can be seen that higher tier approaches and a higher 
number of country-specific (CS) emission factors were used for CO2 as compared to CH4 and N2O. Conversely, 
lower tier approaches and greater reliance on default emission factors were used for N2O. This information is 
provided primarily for illustrative purposes. These uncertainty ranges could be used as a starting point or for 
comparison by national experts working on uncertainty assessment.

2.4.2 
Activity data uncertainties 
Statistics of fuel combusted at large sources obtained from direct measurement or obligatory reporting are likely 
to be within 3 percent of the central estimate. For some energy intensive industries, combustion data are likely to 
be more accurate. It is good practice to estimate the uncertainties in fuel consumption for the main sub-
categories in consultation with the sample survey designers, because the uncertainties depend on the quality of 
the survey design and the size of sample used. 
In addition to any systematic bias in the activity data as a result of incomplete coverage of consumption of fuels, 
the activity data will be subject to random errors in the data collection that will vary from year to year. Countries 
with good data collection systems, including data quality control, may be expected to keep the random error in 
total recorded energy use to about 2-3 percent of the annual figure. This range reflects the implicit confidence 
limits on total energy demand seen in models using historical energy data and relating energy demand to 
economic factors. Percentage errors for individual energy use activities can be much larger. 
Overall uncertainty in activity data is a combination of both systematic and random errors. Most developed 
countries prepare balances of fuel supply and deliveries and this provides a check on systematic errors. In these 
circumstances, overall systematic errors are likely to be small. Experts believe that the uncertainty resulting from 
the two errors combined is probably in the range of ±5 percent for most developed countries. For countries with 
 
Chapter 2: Stationary Combustion 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
2.41 
less well-developed energy data systems, this could be considerably larger, probably about ±10 percent. Informal 
activities may increase the uncertainty up to as much as 50 percent in some sectors for some countries.  
Uncertainty ranges for stationary combustion activity data are shown in Table 2.15. This information may be 
used when reporting uncertainties. It is good practice for inventory compilers to develop, if possible, country-
specific uncertainties using expert judgement and/or statistical analysis.

INVENTORY QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY 
CONTROL QA/QC 
Specific QA/QC procedures to optimise the quality of estimates of emissions from stationary combustion are 
given in Table 2.16. 
2.5.1 
Reporting and Documentation 
It is good practice to document and archive all information required to produce the national emissions inventory 
estimates, as outlined in Chapter 8 of Volume 1. It is not practical to include all documentation in the inventory 
report. However, the inventory should include summaries of methods used and references to data sources such 
that the reported emissions estimates are transparent and steps in their calculation can be retraced. Some 
examples of specific documentation and reporting that are relevant to stationary combustion sources are 
discussed below. 
For all tiers, it is good practice to provide the sources of the energy data used and observations on the 
completeness of the data set. Most energy statistics are not considered confidential. If inventory compilers do not 
report disaggregated data due to confidentiality concerns, it is good practice to explain the reasons for these 
concerns, and to report the data in a more aggregated form. 
The current IPCC reporting format (spreadsheet tables, aggregate tables) tries to provide a balance between the 
requirement of transparency and the level of effort that is realistically achievable by most inventory compilers. 
Good practice involves some additional effort to fulfil the transparency requirements completely. In particular, if 
Tier 3 is used, additional tables showing the activity data that are directly associated with the emission factors 
should be prepared. 
For country-specific CO2 emission factors, it is good practice to provide the sources of the calorific values, 
carbon content and oxidation factors (whether the default factor of 100 percent is used or a different value 
depending on circumstances). For country- and technology-specific non-CO2 greenhouse gas estimates, it may 
be necessary to cite different references or documents. It is good practice to provide citations for these 
references, particularly if they describe new methodological developments or emission factors for particular 
technologies or national circumstances. For all country- and technology-specific emission factors, it is good 
practice to provide the date of the last revision and any verification of the accuracy. 
Volume 2: Energy 
2.42 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
In those circumstances where double counting could occur, it is good practice to state clearly whether emission 
estimates have been allocated to the Energy or to other sectors such as AFOLU, IPPU or Waste, to show that no 
double counting has occurred.

WORKSHEETS 
The four pages of the worksheets (Annex 1 of this Volume) for the Tier I Sectoral Approach should be filled in 
for each of the source categories indicated in Table 2.16. Only the amount of fuel combusted for energy purposes 
should be included in column A of the worksheets. When filling in column A of the worksheets, the following 
issues should be taken into account: 1) some fuels are used for purposes other than for combustion, 2) waste-
derived fuels are sometimes burned for energy purposes, and 3) some of the fuel combustion emissions should 
be included in Industrial Processes.  Table 1 in the Annex lists the main considerations that should be taken into 
consideration in deciding what fraction of consumption should be included in the activity data for each fuel.

Comparison 
of emission 
estimates 
using 
different 
approaches 
• 
The inventory compiler should compare estimates of CO2 emissions 
from fuel combustion prepared using the Sectoral Approach with the 
Reference Approach, and account for any difference greater than or 
equal to 5 percent. In this comparative analysis, emissions from fuels 
other than by combustion, that are accounted for in other sections of a 
GHG inventory, should be subtracted from the Reference Approach. 
• 
If a Tier 2 approach with country-specific factors is used, the inventory 
compiler should compare the result to emissions calculated using the 
Tier 1 approach with default IPCC factors. This type of comparison may 
require aggregating Tier 2 emissions to the same sector and fuel 
groupings as the Tier 1 approach. The approach should be documented 
and any discrepancies investigated.  
• 
If possible, the inventory compiler should compare the consistency of 
the calculations in relation to the maximum carbon content of fuels that 
are combusted by stationary sources. Anticipated carbon balances should 
be maintained throughout the combustion sectors. 
 
Activity data 
check 
• 
The national agency in charge of energy statistics should construct, if resources permit, national commodity balances expressed in mass units, and 
construct mass balances of fuel conversion industries. The time series of statistical differences should be checked for systematic effects (indicated by the 
differences persistently having the same sign) and these effects eliminated where possible.  
• 
The national agency in charge of energy statistics should also construct, if resources permit, national energy balances expressed in energy units and energy 
balances of fuel conversion industries. The time series of statistical differences should be checked, and the calorific values cross-checked with the default 
values given in the Introduction chapter. This step will only be of value where different calorific values for a particular fuel (for example, coal) are applied 
to different headings in the balance (such as production, imports, coke ovens and households). Statistical differences that change in magnitude or sign 
significantly from the corresponding mass values provide evidence of incorrect calorific values. 
• 
The inventory compiler should confirm that gross carbon supply in the Reference Approach has been adjusted for fossil fuel carbon from imported or 
exported non-fuel materials in countries where this is expected to be significant.  
• 
Energy statistics should be compared with those provided to international organisations to identify inconsistencies. 
• 
There may be routine collections of emissions and fuel combustion statistics at large combustion plants for pollution legislation purposes. If possible, the 
inventory compiler can use these plant-level data to cross-check national energy statistics for representativeness. 
• 
If secondary data from national organisations are used, the inventory compiler should ensure that these organisations have appropriate QA/QC 
programmes in place.

Emission 
factors check 
and review 
• 
The inventory compiler should construct national energy balances 
expressed in carbon units and carbon balances of fuel conversion 
industries. The time series of statistical differences should be checked. 
Statistical differences that change in magnitude or sign significantly 
from the corresponding mass values provide evidence of incorrect 
carbon content.  
• 
Monitoring systems at large combustion plants may be used to check the 
emission and oxidation factors in use at the plant. 
• 
Some countries estimate emissions from fuel consumed and the carbon 
contents of those fuels. In this case, the carbon contents of the fuels 
should be regularly reviewed. 
• 
If country-specific emission factors are used, the inventory compiler 
should compare them to the IPCC defaults, and explain and document 
differences. 
• 
The inventory compiler should compare the emission factors used with 
site or plant level factors, if these are available. This type of comparison 
provides an indication of how reasonable and representative the national 
factor is. 
 
Evaluation of 
direct 
measurements 
• 
The inventory compiler should evaluate the quality control associated 
with facility-level fuel measurements that have been used to calculate 
site-specific emission and oxidation factors. If it is established that there 
is insufficient quality control associated with the measurements and 
analysis used to derive the factor, continued use of the factor may be 
questioned. 
• 
If direct measurements are used, the inventory compiler should ensure 
that they are made according to good measurement practices including 
appropriate QA/QC procedures. Direct measurements should be 
compared to the results derived from using IPCC default factors.  
 
CO2 capture 
• 
CO2 capture should be reported only when linked with long-term 
storage. The captured amounts should be checked with amount of CO2 
stored. The reported CO2 captured should not exceed the amount of 
stored CO2 plus reported fugitive emissions from the measure. The 
amount of stored CO2 should be based on measurements of the amount 
injected to storage. 
Not applicable 
External 
review 
• 
The inventory compiler should carry out a review involving national experts and stakeholders in the different fields related to emissions from stationary 
sources, such as: energy statistics, combustion efficiencies for different sectors and equipment types, fuel use and pollution controls. In developing 
countries, expert review of emissions from biomass combustion is particularly important.
