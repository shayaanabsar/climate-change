6 ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY EMISSIONS 
Users are expected to go to the Mapping Tables in Annex 5, before reading this chapter. This is required to 
correctly understand both the refinements made and how the elements in this chapter relate to the corresponding 
chapter in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.  
This Chapter 6 Volume 3 of the 2019 Refinement is a complete update of Chapter 6 Volume 3 of the 2006 IPCC 
Guidelines and should be used instead of Chapter 6 Volume 3 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.  
The 2019 Refinement of Volume 3 Chapter 6 was designed to maintain the scientific validity of GHG emissions 
estimates from the electronics industry. Compared to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, the 2019 Refinement takes into 
account the changes in manufacturing processes and equipment that have occurred in the electronics industry 
during the thirteen-year interim period and reflect the much larger set of experimental data available (as of 2018 
compared to 2006) to calculate default emissions factors for the sector. Also, several methodological refinements 
are introduced in an attempt to increase accuracy and flexibility, depending on how reporting facilities track gas 
usage and implement emissions control technologies. The 2019 Refinement includes six revised methods (Tier 1, 
2a, 2b, 2c, 3a, and 3b), compared to four for the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. Section 6.1.2 and the mapping Tables in 
Annex 5 summarize the substantial refinements of this Chapter. Annex 5 provides a list of the sections, equations, 
tables, figures, and boxes that have been refined in this chapter, describing the type of refinement and a comparison 
between the 2006 IPCC Guidelines and the 2019 Refinement. 
 
 
6.1 
INTRODUCTION 
6.1.1 
Overview of emissions and their sources  
As part of its manufacturing processes, the electronics industry uses and emits greenhouse gases (GHGs) from the 
family of fluorinated compounds (FCs) and nitrous oxide (N2O). The specific electronic industry sub-sectors 
discussed in this chapter include the manufacturing of semiconductor devices, microelectromechanical systems 
(MEMS), photovoltaic (PV) devices, and displays, which in turn consist of thin-film-transistors (TFTs) for 
displays and organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). FC emissions from waterproofing of electronic circuits are 
discussed in Chapter 8 of this Volume. 
6.1.1.1 COMPOUNDS USED AND EMITTED 
The electronics industry currently emits both FCs that are gases at room temperature (FC gases) and fluorinated 
compounds that are liquids at room temperature (fluorinated liquids) and that enter the atmosphere through 
evaporation.  FC gases are used in two important steps of electronics manufacturing: (i) plasma etching and wafer 
cleaning (EWC) of silicon-containing materials and (ii) cleaning of the chamber walls of thin-film deposition (TFD) 
and diffusion tools after processing substrates. Electronic manufacturers also use fluorinated liquids as heat 
transfer fluids (HTFs) for temperature control during certain processes, as well as during testing of packaged 
semiconductor devices and during vapour phase reflow soldering of electronic components to circuit boards. In 
addition, fluorinated liquids are sometimes used to clean substrate surfaces, e.g., for MEMS. (Before 2010, 
fluorinated liquids were occasionally used to clean TFT-display panels during manufacture, but this is no longer 
believed to be the case.) Finally, electronics manufacturers use N2O as an input gas during TFD processes and for 
other N2O-using manufacturing processes such as diffusion and dry removal of photoresist. 
For the purpose of this Chapter, FC gases are defined to include perfluoromethane (CF4), perfluoroethane C2F6, 
perfluoropropane 
(C3F8), 
1,3-hexafluorobutadiene 
(C4F6), 
perfluorocyclobutane 
(c-C4F8), 
octafluorotetrahydrofuran (C4F8O), octafluorocyclopentene (c-C5F8), trifluoromethane (CHF3), difluoromethane 
(CH2F2), fluoromethane (CH3F), pentafluoroethane (C2HF5), nitrogen trifluoride (NF3), and sulphur hexafluoride 
(SF6).  Although not considered to be greenhouse gases, carbonyl fluoride (COF2), and fluorine (F2) should be 
tracked as input gases because they are known to create FC gas by-products which should be included in the 
inventory. Fluorinated liquid emissions consist primarily of hydrofluoroethers, perfluoropolyethers (including 
PFPMIE), and other fully fluorinated liquids (perfluorinated amines and perfluoroalkylmorpholines). More than 
40 different fluorinated liquids are marketed to the electronics industry, often as mixtures of fully fluorinated 
compounds. Although this list of FC gases and classes of fluorinated liquids is believed to include all relevant 
compounds used in appreciable quantities for the production of electronic devices as of this writing, FC gases and 
 Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use

2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
fluorinated liquids that should be considered for inventory purposes under this Chapter could also include other 
fluorinated compounds currently used in small quantities for production or for research and development (R&D) 
purposes, and FC gases and fluorinated liquids that may be used in the future for manufacturing electronic devices. 
In general, fluorinated compounds that are greenhouse gases or whose use during the manufacturing of electronic 
devices could result in emissions of greenhouse gases should be considered.  
 
6.1.1.2 PROCESSES LEADING TO EMISSIONS 
Both plasma etching and wafer and thin film deposition chamber cleaning processes use plasma or thermal energy 
to break down fluorinated compounds into fluorine atoms and other reactive species to perform these process steps. 
TFD and other N2O-using processes also use plasma or thermal energy to break down N2O molecules and generate 
oxygen or nitrogen atoms or molecules and other excited species to perform the process. The majority of FC gases 
and N2O emissions result from the failure to completely break down the FC gases or N2O molecules that are fed 
into the process, causing the utilisation efficiency of the input gases to be limited. In this chapter, input gases are 
generally designated with the subscript “i.” In addition, a fraction of FC input gases used in the production process 
can be converted into FC gas by-products such as CF4, C2F6, C4F6, C4F8, C3F8, CHF3, CH2F2, and CH3F. Several 
of these by-products can also be formed even if no carbon-containing FCs are fed into the process. In particular, 
processes using molecular fluorine (F2), nitrogen trifluoride (NF3), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), or chlorine 
trifluoride (ClF3) input gases can generate CF4, C2F6, CHF3, CH2F2, CH3F (and potentially other FC gases) as by-
products of etching carbon-containing materials or cleaning chambers previously used to deposit carbon-
containing thin films.1 Moreover, under certain circumstances, CF4 may be formed in combustion-based emissions 
control systems using hydrocarbon fuels by reaction between the fuel and fluorinated species (e.g. F2) emitted 
during F2 and remote NF3 chamber cleans; thus, an appropriate CF4 by-product emission factor (ABCF4, F2) should 
be used to account for this phenomenon. In this chapter, by-product gases are generally designated with the 
subscript “k” (or “k,i” where a particular input gas “i” reacts to form the by-product “k”). Finally, with respect to 
fluorinated liquids, emissions occur through evaporative losses. Table 6.1 summarizes the sources and types of 
GHGs emitted during electronics manufacturing and identifies the section of this Refinement where they are 
discussed.  
 
 
 
1 When using cleaning or etching gases that do not contain carbon (e.g. F2, NF3, SF6, or ClF3), CF4 and other FCs with high 
GWPs can be formed during the etching or cleaning of carbon-containing thin films, thus resulting in global warming 
emissions from the process. In particular, it should be noted that emissions of CF4 and other FC by-products with high GWPs 
should be taken into account, even when the cleaning or etching precursor itself has no or low global warming potential (such 
as F2, COF2, or ClF3). Please see section 6.2.2.1 for more detail.

6.1.2 
Summary of refinements 
The Tier 1 method of the 2019 Refinement uses the same approach as in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, where 
emissions are estimated based on the surface area of substrate produced for each sub-sector, but the Tier 1 default 
emissions factors (EFs) for semiconductor and display manufacturing have been updated to account for 
technological advancements and for the use of a broader basket of FC gases and fluorinated liquids. In addition, 
default EFs for MEMS have been introduced.  
The Tier 2 and 3 methods of the 2019 Refinement, like their predecessors in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, are based 
on gas consumption. The 2006 Tier 2a method is updated as a new refined 2019 Tier 2a method for the 
semiconductor sub-sector with revised emission factors, also accounting for additional precursors and by-products. 
For the display sub-sector, the 2019 Refinement no longer provides a Tier 2a method because it is typically not 
needed. For the PV sub-sector, the 2006 Tier 2a method default factors cannot be applied to the 2019 Tier 2a 
method.  
The 2006 Tier 2b method, which formerly distinguished emission factors by process type (etch versus chemical 
vapour deposition (CVD) 2 chamber clean) is now replaced with a new refined 2019 Tier 2b method using emission 
factors applicable to different wafer sizes for the semiconductor sub-sector (≤200 mm or 300 mm). Note that the 
revised 2019 Tier 2b method no longer distinguishes EFs by process type (this is now done under the new 2019 
Tier 2c method), and that the 2019 Tier 2b method is applicable only to the semiconductor sub-sector.  
The new 2019 Tier 2c method for the semiconductor sub-sector distinguishes emissions factors by both wafer size 
(≤200 mm or 300 mm), and by refined process type. For the display and PV sub-sectors, the Tier 2c method does 
not distinguish by substrate size but provides differentiated emission factors by process type. 
Using the Tier 2 and Tier 3a methods requires some degree of apportioning of gas consumption. That is, the 
consumption of input gases should be differentiated by process type (e.g. etching vs. chamber cleaning). Compared 
to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, the 2019 Refinement provides additional guidance to apportion gas consumption to 
different process types.  
 
2 This chapter uses the term “thin-film deposition,” which encompasses chemical vapour deposition as well as other thin film 
deposition techniques. 
 Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
 
6.10 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
The 2006 Tier 3 method, which was based on process-specific parameters, has evolved into a new 2019 Tier 3a 
method, which provides increased guidance for estimating emissions using measured, site-specific emissions 
factors (as opposed to the default emission factors used for the Tier 2 methods). In principle, the Tier 3a method 
is applicable to all sub-sectors (semiconductor, display, MEMS, PV).  
The 2019 Refinement includes a new ‘stack’ Tier 3b method to develop site-specific emission factors based on 
measurements at the stack level. Like the Tier 3a method, the 3b method is applicable to all sub-sectors.  
Finally, it should be noted that, in addition to emissions arising from the direct manufacture of semiconductor, 
display, MEMS, and PV devices themselves, account has also been taken in the 2019 Refinement for GHG 
emissions (including a variety of FC gases) from the application of thin, conformal waterproofing films to 
assembled circuit boards as used in electronic devices that are likely to be exposed to the weather; a good example 
being mobile (“cellular” or “smart”) phones. This is discussed separately in Chapter 8 of the 2019 Refinement. 
Table 6.2 summarizes the refinements and applicability of each Tier by electronics industry sub-sector.

1For display, the Tier 2c method now includes a default emission factor for N2O TFD but is otherwise similar to the former 2b method. 
The Tier 2c method does not distinguish by substrate size for display. 
2While the Tier 2 methods for all electronics sub-sectors were updated (e.g., to include additional guidance on gas apportioning and 
abatement), the default Tier 2c emission factors for photovoltaic manufacturing were not updated and are the same as for the 2006 IPCC 
Guidelines Tier 2b method. 
3Data were not available to calculate separate Tier 2 default EFs for MEMS manufacturing, but the corresponding Tier 2 EFs for 
semiconductors may be applied to MEMS manufacturing that uses semiconductor manufacturing tools.  
 
6.2 
METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES 
6.2.1 
Choice of method 
6.2.1.1 GASEOUS FLUORINATED COMPOUNDS AND NITROUS OXIDE  
Emissions of gaseous fluorinated compounds (FCs) and nitrous oxide from electronics manufacturing vary 
according to the quantities of the gases used (which vary roughly with the quantity of substrate processed), the 
identities of the gases used, the processes used, the wafer size (for semiconductors), and the type and 
implementation of emissions control technologies. The choice of methods will depend on data availability and 
whether the electronics source category is key. See Figure 6.1 (Decision tree for estimation of GHG emissions 
from electronics manufacturing) and Tables 6.3 and 6.4 (Information for sources necessary for completing the 
tiered emissions estimating methods for electronics manufacturing) for more information. 
Continuous (in-situ) emissions monitoring is not currently considered an economically viable means to estimate 
emissions from the electronics industry; however, greenhouse gas emissions are periodically measured at the 
process tool exhaust during the development of new processes and tools, generally for centreline process

aggregation, form the basis of the Tier 1 and Tier 2 default emission factors presented in this guidance. They can 
also be performed by individual facilities and/or their tool suppliers to develop emission factors for specific process 
recipes or families of recipes when using the Tier 3a method. Finally, some facilities may periodically (for short 
periods of time) install equipment to measure emissions from their stacks for purposes of developing facility-
specific emission factors to estimate emissions over the long term, as required by the Tier 3b method.  
As discussed further below, the precision of the emissions estimate generally improves as one moves from lower 
to higher Tiers, accounting for more and more site-specific factors. For any single facility, the accuracy of the 
methods depends, among other things, on the differences between the emission factors of the processes actually 
used in production and the emission factors of a particular method, and on potential errors in calculating the overall 
efficiency and uptime of emissions control equipment. These differences and errors are likely to decrease (though 
not to disappear) as the Tier is increased. Errors in gas consumption measurements and apportioning can also occur 
and can limit the improvement in precision achieved by characterizing processes at a highly detailed level (e.g., in 
the Tier 3a method).  However, apportioning errors depend on the measurements or model used and, if the guidance 
provided below is followed, are not expected to become important at the Tier 2 level (e.g., in moving from Tier 2a 
to Tier 2c). Thus, the use of higher tiered methods is strongly encouraged, especially in the case where default 
emission factors do not exist.  
Where no gas consumption data is available and the electronics category is not key, emissions can be estimated 
using the Tier 1 method based on production figures (surface area of substrate used during the production of 
electronic devices).  However, this approach is the least accurate and should be used only in cases where company-
specific gas consumption data is not available. The uncertainty of the Tier 1 method is very high because it does 
not account for the quantities of the gases consumed (which are only loosely correlated with production), the 
identities of the gases consumed, the process type, the wafer size (for semiconductors), or the use of emissions 
control technology. 
The Tier 2 methods are expected to be more accurate than the Tier 1 method because they rely on the actual 
consumption of individual gases and account for the use of emissions control technology. To varying extents, they 
also distinguish among process types and, for semiconductor manufacturing, wafer sizes. Note that insufficient 
data was available to calculate Tier 2 factors specifically for MEMS manufacturing; however, the corresponding 
semiconductor Tier 2 emission factors may be applied unless the MEMS are manufactured using MEMS-specific 
processes and manufacturing tools. If MEMS-specific manufacturing tools are used, the only higher-Tiered 
methods available are the Tier 3a and 3b methods. 
The Tier 2a method does not distinguish among process types for most GHGs. The exceptions are NF3 and C3F8, 
for which the Tier 2a method distinguishes between two process types (remote plasma clean vs. all other processes), 
and N2O, for which the Tier 2a method distinguishes between two process types for semiconductor manufacturing 
(TFD and “other”). In addition, the 2a method does not distinguish between wafer sizes for semiconductor or 
MEMS manufacturing. Because emission factors for semiconductor manufacturing vary significantly based on 
wafer size, the Tier 2a method should only be used in the case of semiconductor facilities processing multiple 
substrate sizes where it is not possible to distinguish (apportion) gas consumption between the different substrate 
sizes. The 2019 Refinement does not provide a Tier 2a method for the display sub-sector because display 
manufacturers typically use separate gas supplies for different process types, thus enabling the direct use of the 
more accurate Tier 2c method without having to apportion gas usage.4 For the PV sub-sector, it should be noted 
that the 2006 Tier 2a default factors cannot be applied to the 2019 Tier 2a method because no data was available 
to calculate default γi,p and γk,i,p values for PV manufacturing. Thus, for PV manufacturing, only the 2019 Tier 2c 
or the 2019 Tier 3 methods are available.  
The 2b method applies only to semiconductor manufacturing and to MEMS manufacturing that uses tools and 
processes which are similar to those used to manufacture semiconductors. The Tier 2b method is identical to the 
2a method except that it provides emission factors that depend on the size of the wafers used for manufacturing 
(≤200 mm or 300 mm). The Tier 2b method is therefore more accurate than the Tier 2a method for semiconductor 
and MEMS manufacturing, and it should be used instead of the Tier 2a method when a facility only has one wafer 
size.  
The Tier 2c method is expected to provide more accurate emission estimates than either of the other Tier 2 methods 
because it distinguishes among all process types for all GHGs, and it also distinguishes between wafer sizes in the 
semiconductor sub-sector. In addition, the method provides more accurate estimates of the quantities of FCs 
 
been provided by a tool manufacturer who standardized its equipment for sale. Note that it is common for electronic devices 
manufacturers to modify centreline process conditions (developed in-house or by tool manufacturers) to optimise for 
particular needs or for a particular product. 
4 In the case display manufacturers use the same gas supply containers for multiple process types, a gas consumption 
apportioning model should be used.  
 Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use

exhausted5 from tools which are connected to emission control systems (see discussion on the γi,p and γk,i,p factors 
and on the calculation of ai and ak,i in the next paragraph as well as in the Tier 2a method section, particularly Box 
6.3). The Tier 2c method is the only Tier 2 method available for the display and PV sub-sectors. Note that the 
definitions of process types are specific to each sub-sector: there are 6 distinct process types for the semiconductor 
sub-sector, 4 process types for the display sub-sector, and 2 process types for the PV sub-sector (see Tier 3a method 
description for details). 
Apportioning is required to track gas consumption to process types. The Tier 2a and 2b methods require only 
limited apportioning. They are therefore simpler to use than the Tier 2c method, which requires apportioning of 
all gases to all process types that use those gases. However, the limited apportioning of the Tier 2a and Tier 2b 
methods significantly increases the uncertainty of their results. Instead of using facility-specific values as the Tier 
2c and Tier 3a methods do, the Tier 2a and Tier 2b methods rely on industry average values for (1) the allocation 
of consumption of each gas to each process type, and (2) in the case of emissions control calculations, the per-tool 
pre-control emissions of each gas from each process type. These averages are respectively embodied in (1) 
weighted average emission factors for the process gases and (2) default weighting factors (γi,p and γk,i,p) to account 
for average per-tool emissions from EWC vs. TFD tools for purposes of calculating  the impacts of emissions 
control systems (Di and Dk,i). (All of these quantities are discussed further below.)  To the extent that the gas 
consumption patterns at individual facilities depart from these averages, the Tier 2a and Tier 2b methods will be 
inaccurate for those facilities. There is potential for large errors because emission factors can vary widely among 
process types, and the shares of each gas flowing to different process types (as well as per-tool emissions for 
different process types) vary widely among facilities. For these reasons, the Tier 2a and 2b methods should only 
be used when it is not possible to distinguish (apportion) gas consumption among the larger number of process 
types identified in the Tier 2c method. 
The methods believed to provide the most accurate and least uncertain estimates of greenhouse gas emissions for 
electronic devices manufacturing are the Tier 3a and Tier 3b methods.  
The Tier 3a method uses the same equations as the Tier 2c method. However, instead of using default emission 
factors for relatively broad process types, the Tier 3a method uses, at least in part, measured facility-specific 
emission factors. This enables the Tier 3a method to capture the variability in emission factors that can occur 
across processes within the same process type, using the same FC gas, and (for semiconductors) occurring on the 
same wafer size.6 In theory, the Tier 3a method could be used to assign an emission factor to each centreline 
process, recipe, or families of similar recipes (see footnotes 2 and 5 and Tier 3a method discussion), or to assign a 
specific destruction removal efficiency (DRE) to a particular gas or by-product and emissions control system. It 
should be noted however that the new Tier 3a method provides more flexibility than the 2006 Tier 3 method in 
that using it does not require a complete set of measured values (see discussion on the use of ‘hybrid’ methods in 
the section on Adapting Tier 2 Methods to Account for Technological Changes). In the case of the Tier 3b method, 
reporting companies estimate their emissions based on fab7-specific emission factors. These emission factors are 
developed through periodic measurements of stack emissions correlated to 1) the consumption of input gases by 
the production tools connected to the stack system, and 2) the efficacy of the emissions control technologies used 
with those tools. 
Because the new Tier 3b method is based on the measurement of emissions at the end-of-pipe (stack) level, it can 
be characterized as a ‘top-down’ method and contrasted to the Tier 2 and Tier 3a methods, which provide a 
‘bottom-up’ approach by estimating emissions based on consumption at the inlet of the process tools. Thus, 
comparing the results of the various Tier 2 or Tier 3a bottom-up methods to the new top-down Tier 3b method 
could provide a measure of the accuracy (or inaccuracy) of the methods. 
With respect to accounting for emissions control technologies, it should be noted that the 2019 Refinement includes 
significant updates to the guidance on how to account for the use of emission control systems. One significant 
 
5  In this chapter, the fraction of gas or quantity of gas “exhausted” from process tools refers to the fraction or quantity of that 
gas that emerges from the tools before abatement is accounted for (i.e., the pre-control emissions). For example, if half of the 
tools that run etch processes with CHF3 are equipped with suitable emissions control technologies, then the fraction of CHF3 
exhausted from etch process tools that are equipped with suitable emissions control technologies is 50 percent. 
6  Emission factors for input gas utilisation efficiencies and by-product formation rates can be strongly affected by changes in 
process variables other than FC gas, substrate size, and process type; these include film and tool type, combination of gases, 
as well as process recipes variables such as pressure, flow, temperature and plasma power. Further, emission factors for a 
recipe ‘tuned’ for a particular purpose or product can differ from those of the centreline process recipe that may have been 
used for measuring emissions (see Footnote 2). Emission factors can also be affected by the design of the process reactors 
and can substantially fluctuate from one tool manufacturer to another, even when the process function is similar (e.g. 
deposition of un-doped silicon dioxide using N2O, cleaning a TFD reactor after deposition of silicon nitride using NF3, 
etching of a trench in an interconnect structure using C4F6, etc.).  
7 The term ‘fab’ is synonymous with clean room/manufacturing facility. Semiconductor and flat panel display manufacturing 
plants are often called fabrication plants, from which the abbreviation ‘fab’ follows. 
 Chapter 6: Electronics Industry Emissions

update is the consideration of the uptime of emissions control systems. Another update is guidance to determine 
the suitability of using particular emissions control technologies (e.g., cartridge, catalyst, hot-wet, plasma, 
combustion, new technology) for specific gases. Further, an applicability condition for using default DRE values 
(Tier 2 and Tier 3 methods) is to obtain a certification by the emissions control system manufacturers that their 
emissions control systems are capable of removing a particular gas to at least the default DRE in the worst-case flow 
conditions, as defined by each reporting site. This is important because the efficacy of greenhouse gas emissions 
control equipment depends on whether it is designed to abate the target gas and on whether it is operated and 
maintained according to the manufacturer’s specifications, especially as regards to not exceeding the individual 
process gas and total gas flow rates (including any added purge gases) as stated by the emissions control equipment 
supplier. Guidance is also provided for using site-specific (measured) destruction removal efficiencies to claim DREs 
that may be different than the default values. 
Finally, it should be noted that, even though the logic depicted in Figure 6.1 does not show the possibility of 
combining tiers, such an approach can be used to improve the accuracy of emissions estimates. If default emission 
factors are not available under Tier 2 (e.g. if a new wafer size or process type is introduced), or when a default 
emission factor is known to substantially differ from a facility-specific emission factor, inventory compilers can 
undertake process emissions characterization under Tier 3a and measure (1-U) and B factors for those new 
processes without defaults (or with an emission factor different than the default) while using Tier 2 defaults for 
existing processes (hybrid approach). Similarly, the Tier 2c method might be used for a particular sub-section of 
a facility and then combined with the Tier 3b method to estimate emissions from another sub-section of a facility, 
where emissions estimates would be based on measured (stack) emission factors.  However, reporting companies 
should not combine the Tier 1 method with any other method.

For semiconductor 450 mm substrate size, facilities should test and develop measured emission factors (Tier 3a). 
Tier 2a should not be used for 450 mm. Measured factors can be phased in over time; previous generation Tier 2c 
default factors can be used during the phase in period. Tier 3a measured factors should be submitted to IPCC 
EFDB to allow development of Tier 2 defaults. See section “Adapting Tier 2 Methods to account for technological 
changes” for more details.

TIER 1 METHOD – DEFAULT EMISSION FACTORS BASED ON 
PRODUCTION 
The Tier 1 method is the least accurate estimation method and should be used only in cases where facility-specific 
data are not available. The Tier 1 method is based on production figures (surface area of substrate used during the 
production of electronic devices, e.g. silicon, glass). Unlike the Tier 2 or Tier 3 methods, the Tier 1 method is 
designed to give an aggregated estimate of greenhouse gas and N2O emissions with an estimated but uncertain 
break-out among specific gases. Estimates are made simultaneously for all the gases listed in Table 6.6, and the 
Tier 1 method can only be used if these gases are reported as a complete set. For each class (sub-sector) of 
electronic products being manufactured (semiconductors, display, PV, MEMS), the calculation of emissions relies 
on a different set of default, gas-specific emission factors.  Each default emission factor expresses the average 
emissions of the relevant gas per unit area of the relevant substrate used during manufacture (including test 
substrates).  
For any class of electronic products (input material), the default emission factors are multiplied by the annual 
production (P, in units of square meters (m2)). The result is a set of annual emissions estimates expressed in kg of 
the gases emitted during the manufacture of that class of electronic products. Because the use of greenhouse gases 
varies widely during PV manufacture, a third factor to account for the proportion of PV manufacture that employs

This method does not account for actual gas consumption or for differences in emission factors among process 
types (etching versus cleaning), individual processes, or tools. It also does not account for the possible use of

In using Tier 1, inventory compilers should not modify, in any way, the set of the gases assumed in Table 6.6. For 
any given manufacturing facility, inventory compilers should not combine emissions estimated using Tier 1 
method with emissions estimated using the Tier 2 or 3 methods. Neither may inventory compilers use, for example, 
the Tier 1 factor for CF4 to estimate the emissions of CF4 from semiconductors and combine it with the results of 
other FC gases from a Tier 2 or Tier 3 method. (See also Section 6.2.2.1.) 
 
GAS CONSUMPTION AND APPORTIONING FOR TIERS 2 AND 3 
In using the Tier 2 and Tier 3a methods, input gas consumption (Ci) should be determined and apportioned to 
specific process types (Ci, p). Where the Tier 2c or 3a methods are used to estimate emissions from a semiconductor 
facility that manufactures on multiple wafer sizes, gas consumption should be apportioned to specific wafer sizes 
as well. In this situation, the equations below can be used twice, substituting “wafer size” for “process” as a first 
step and then using the equation again for “process”. Total annual input gas i consumption (Ci) on a facility basis 
for each fluorinated compound and N2O is calculated using Equation 6.2 below.

the pressure and converting the pressure to mass using the ideal gas law or based on the weight of the gas provided 
to the facility in gas supplier documents. If the reporting facility uses less than 50 kg of an FC gas or N2O in one 
reporting year, inventory compilers may assume that any hi,c for that FC gas or N2O is equal to zero.   
For the Tier 2 and Tier 3a methods, varying degrees of gas use apportioning are required. For the semiconductor 
sub-sector, the Tier 2a and 2b methods require apportioning of NF3 and C3F8 consumption between the remote 
plasma clean (RPC) process type and other NF3- or C3F8-using process types, while N2O is apportioned between 
the N2O TFD process type and “Other” N2O-using process types. The Tier 2c (for the semiconductor, MEMS, and 
display sub-sectors) and the Tier 3a (for all sub-sectors) methods require apportioning for each input gas i and 
each process type p. Apportioning is calculated using Equation 6.4.

To minimize apportioning uncertainty and increase accuracy, it is good practice to implement a gas consumption 
monitoring system using direct measurement to apportion gas use at the process type-, stack system- or facility-
level as appropriate. This can be achieved by various methods including monitoring and integrating the signal of 
Mass Flow Controllers (MFCs) and using weigh scales; however, it is noted that measurement to specific tools or 
processes may not be feasible. If gas consumption measurement at the process level is not deemed feasible for a 
particular facility, apportioning factors (Φi,p) can be calculated using a site-specific engineering model. This model 
should be based on a quantifiable metric, such as substrate passes or substrate starts. To verify the apportioning 
model, it is good practice to demonstrate its precision and accuracy as follows: 
(1)  Demonstrate that the FC gases and N2O apportioning factors are developed using calculations that are 
repeatable, which means that the variables used in the formulas for the facility's engineering model for gas 
apportioning factors should be based on observable and measurable quantities that govern gas consumption 
rather than engineering judgment about those quantities or gas consumption. Note that research and 
development (R&D) and tool commissioning activities may be excluded from the apportioning calculations, 
but that gas purchases in support of these activities should be included in the emissions calculation. In the 
event of the introduction of new manufacturing technologies or new gases, this demonstration should be 
repeated. 
 (2) Demonstrate the accuracy of the site-specific apportioning model by comparing the actual amount of input 
gas i consumed and the modelled amount of input gas i consumed in the facility, by: 
(i) 
 Analysing actual and modelled gas consumption for a sustained period (at least 30 days) when the fab 
is at a representative operating level (at least 70 percent of the average production rate for the year in 
terms of monthly substrate starts). In the event of the introduction of new technologies or substrate size 
this analysis should be repeated. 
(ii) 
Comparing the actual gas consumed to the modelled gas consumed for the highest use fluorinated 
compound (or compounds) used in multiple process types at the facility (e.g., NF3 use in remote plasma 
clean and other processes).  
(iii)  Demonstrating that the comparison performed for the largest quantity of gas(es), on a mass basis, 
consumed in the facility, does not result in a difference between the actual and modelled gas 
consumption that exceeds 20 percent relative to actual gas consumption.   
(iv) If 20 percent is not achieved, the model should be revised until the difference between actual and the 
modelled gas consumption does not exceed 20 percent. 
Note that inventory compilers may use a combination of apportioning factors developed using a facility-specific 
engineering model and apportioning factors developed through the use of direct measurement.

TIER 2 METHODS – DEFAULT EMISSION FACTORS BASED ON GAS 
CONSUMPTION 
Tier 2a Method 
The Tier 2a method is applicable to semiconductor manufacturing and to MEMS manufacturing that is carried out 
using tools and processes similar to those used to manufacture semiconductors (for further details see discussion 
in the Choice of method section, in particular footnote 3). As discussed above, the Tier 2a method does not 
distinguish between wafer sizes or among process types for most FCs; however, the Tier 2a method does provide 
different default emission factors for C3F8 RPC vs. other C3F8-using processes, for NF3 RPC vs. other NF3-using 
processes, and for N2O TFD processes vs. ‘other’ N2O-using processes. Thus, when using the Tier 2a method, the 
consumption of C3F8 and NF3 should be apportioned between RPC and other processes, and consumption of N2O 
should be apportioned between TFD and “Other” N2O-using processes, as applicable to each reporting site.  
The Tier 2a method uses the default emission factors provided in Table 6.7, which represent average utilisation 
efficiencies of the gases used in manufacturing processes (Ui) and the formation of by-products during the use of 
each input gas i (Bk,i). The other default factors used for the Tier 2a method include the destruction removal 
efficiency of gases i and by-products k (di, dk - see Table 6.17) and the ratio of per-tool uncontrolled emissions of 
gases i (and by-products k) from TFD process tools to per-tool uncontrolled emissions of gases i (and by-products 
k) from EWC process tools (γi,p, γk,i,p - see Table 6.8).  
The Tier 2a method also uses site-specific data on gas consumption and emissions control.  Inventory compilers 
using the Tier 2a method should directly communicate with industry to gather consumption and emissions control-
related data and to ensure that reductions are not attributed to emissions control devices unless the devices are 
installed and used in accordance with the guidance provided in section 6.2.2.1. Inventory compilers should note 
that the consumption of gas i (Ci) takes into account the heel factor (hi,c), which represents the fraction of gas i 
remaining in the shipping container after use, and which can be based on industry-wide default or site-specific 
measured values (see Section on Gas Consumption and Apportioning).  
Total Tier 2a emissions are calculated using Equations 6.5, 6.6, and 6.7 below, and are equal to the sum of 
emissions from all unreacted gases i used in the production process (Ei), plus emissions of all by-products k (BPEk) 
resulting from the conversion of all input gases i used during production, plus emissions of CF4 from hydrocarbon-
fuel-based combustion emissions control systems (EABi,CF4). However, note that EABi,CF4 may be set equal to zero 
if the emissions control equipment manufacturer can certify that reactions between hydrocarbon fuel and F2 to 
form CF4 are not occurring within their emissions control systems (i.e. certify that ABi,CF4 = 0).

FLUORINATED GREENHOUSE GAS BY-PRODUCTS 
As discussed briefly in the introduction, the formation of fluorinated GHG by-products resulting 
from the decomposition of input gases or from the reaction with the materials being etched or cleaned 
should be taken into account. To this effect, by-product emission factors (BCF4,i , BC2F6,i, BC3F8,i, 
BC4F6,i, BC4F8,i, BC5F8,i, BCH3F.i  BCH2F2,i, and BCHF3,i, emission factors indicating the mass ratio of by-
product produced from the use of input gas i) are included as part of the default emission factors 
tables for the Tier 2 methods. In some cases, perfluorinated carbon by-product emission factors are 
provided, even when the etching or cleaning gas i itself contains fluorine but does not contain carbon 
(e.g. NF3, SF6, F2). This is because the fluorine atoms and other excited F species generated from 
the decomposition of NF3, SF6 or F2 can react with the carbon contained in the film to form CF4 and 
other carbon-containing greenhouse gas by-products. Such reactions are particularly significant 
during the etching or cleaning of ‘low k’ (low dielectric constant) materials that often present high 
carbon content, but formation of carbon-containing by-products also occur when small amounts of 
carbon are present in the film, for example in the case of thin films deposited with organic precursors 
such as tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS). However, when using NF3, SF6, F2 or other etching or 
cleaning precursors that do not contain carbon, and when the film being etched or cleaned does not 
contain carbon, then no CF4 or other carbon-containing greenhouse gases are expected to be formed 
during the process. 
As noted in Box 6.2 the formation of FC gas by-products such as CF4, C2F6, CH3F, CH2F2, and CHF3 can occur 
when etching or cleaning carbon-containing films, even when input gases do not contain carbon (e.g. NF3, SF6, 
F2).   However, when using NF3, SF6, F2 or other etching or cleaning precursors that do not contain carbon, and 
when the film being etched or cleaned does not contain carbon, then no CF4 or other carbon-containing greenhouse 
gases are formed during the process. Thus, in such cases (and in such cases only), the Bk,i factors may be set equal 
 Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
 
6.24 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
to zero in Equation 6.6. It should be noted, however, that sometimes both carbon-containing and non-carbon-
containing films are included in the film stacks forming final electronic devices. In such cases, there are two 
options: 1) if it is practical to track the gas consumption used to clean or etch films containing carbon vs. not 
containing carbon, the non-zero and zero Bk.i factors may be applied accordingly, or 2) if it is not practical or 
desired to track gas consumption to this level of detail, the non-zero BPE factors should be applied to all 
consumption of a gas if any film containing carbon is run with that gas during the year. 
Emissions and emission reductions from emission control devices 
When NF3 is used in RPC processes or F2 is used as an input gas and when hydrocarbon-fuel-based combustion 
emissions control technology is used, direct reaction with hydrocarbon fuel and F2 (including F2 resulting from the 
decomposition of NF3 in RPC processes) to form CF4 can occur. Unless the emissions control system manufacturer 
(referred to below as the “original equipment manufacturer” or “OEM”) or electronics manufacturer can certify 
that the rate of conversion from F2 to CF4 or from NF3 to CF4 is <0.1 percent on a mass basis, Equation 6.7 should 
be used to estimate the amount of CF4 produced within and emitted from the emissions control equipment.

Calculation of a i and a k, i using the default weighting factors γ i, p and γ k, i, p  
When using the Tier 2a method, inventory compilers should calculate the fractions of gas i and by-products k 
formed from gas i (based on mass) exhausted from process tools equipped with suitable emissions control 
technologies (ai and ak,i). “Suitable” means that an emissions control technology is capable of abating a particular 
gas to a minimum destruction removal efficiency in a site-specific worst-case scenario (please see Section 6.2.2.1 
on Emissions Control Technology Factors for more details).  
For NF3 and C3F8 used in RPC processes, and for N2O used in either TFD or “other” processes, inventory compilers 
should use Equations 6.18 and 6.19 to estimate the fractions of the input gas and associated by-product abated for 
each of those process types (ai,p and ak,i,p). For other input-gas and process-type combinations, inventory compilers 
using the Tier 2a method (or the Tier 2b or Tier 3b method) should use Equations 6.10 and 6.11 to estimate the 
fractions of input gas and by-product abated across multiple process types (ai and ak,i).  
In all of these equations (6.10, 6.11, 6.18, and 6.19), the fraction of pre-control emissions that is exhausted to 
emissions control systems is approximated using the fraction of the total number of tools that exhaust to emissions 
control systems.8  This approximation is expected to be reasonably good by itself if all the tools are running the 
same process type (e.g., chamber cleaning vs. etching). However, the approximation may be poor by itself if the 
tools are running different process types, because emissions per tool can vary greatly across different process types. 
In Equations 6.10 and 6.11, the fraction of emissions destroyed is estimated across different process types. Thus, 
in these equations, new default weighting factors (γi,p for input gases and γk,i,p for by-product gases, provided in 
Table 6.8) are applied to tools that run chamber cleaning processes to increase the accuracy of the estimate. 
As discussed in Box 6.3, the gamma factors reflect the ratio of the uncontrolled emissions per tool of gas i or by-
product k from tools running the weighted process type “p” to the uncontrolled emissions per tool of gas i or by-
product k from tools running  the reference process type “q.” When Equation 6.10 or 6.11 is used for the Tier 2a 
or Tier 2b method, p includes the in-situ plasma cleaning (IPC) and the in-situ thermal cleaning (ITC) process 
types, while q consists of the etching and wafer cleaning (EWC) process type. (These terms include additional 
 
8  If a facility monitors input gas consumption by tool (e.g., using MFCs), this information rather than tool counts may be used 
to calculate ai,p and ak,i,p. Similarly, if a facility using the 3b method monitors or otherwise apportions gas consumption by 
process type, Equations 6.18 and 6.19 may be used to estimate ai,p and ak,i,p for all process types at the facility.  
 Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
 
6.26 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
process types for Tier 3b; see the definitions of the terms “p” and “q” in Equations 6.10 and 6.11. 9) For Tiers 2a 
and 2b, taking gamma values into account is necessary when (1) an input gas is consumed (or a by-product k is 
produced) both by chamber cleaning processes and by EWC processes, (2) the use of the input gas is not 
apportioned between chamber cleaning processes and EWC processes, and (3) the fractions of tools equipped with 
emissions control technologies are different for chamber cleaning processes and EWC processes. To calculate ai 
and ak,i, inventory compilers should use Equations 6.10 and 6.11 and the default gamma factors, as well as the 
numbers of tools in the reporting facility using gas i or producing by-product k from gas i while running process 
type p or q (ni,p, mi,q, nk,i,p, mk,i,q), and the numbers of those tools equipped with suitable emissions control 
technology for gas i or by-product k while running process type p or q (ni,p,a mi,q,a, nk,i,p,a, m,k,i,q,a).  
For each gas where a value for γi,p or γk,i,p exists, Table 6.8 provides gamma values relating per-tool emissions from 
the weighted process type p to per-tool emissions from the reference process type q. The gamma value column 
selected by a facility depends on the gas(es) emitted by the facility and the process(es) used by the facility.  The 
gamma value row depends on the method used by the facility (Tier 2a, 2b, or 3b), whether the gas is emitted as an 
input gas or by-product, and (for Tier 2b and 3b), the wafer size. For example, a facility emitting CF4 from both 
IPC processes and ITC processes would use a gamma value from the second column from the left in Table 6.8. If 
the facility were using the Tier 2a method to estimate emissions of CF4 as an input gas, it would use the γi value 
in the row immediately below the “Tier 2a” title row in the table. The corresponding tool counts ni,p would be the 
total numbers of tools that emit CF4 as an input gas and that run IPC and ITC processes, respectively, and the 
corresponding tool counts ni,p,a would be the total numbers of tools that emit CF4 as an input gas, that run IPC and 
ITC processes, respectively, and that are abated.     
Where a facility requires a gamma value for a gas-process type combination that is not covered by the table (e.g., 
c-C4F8 IPC), the facility should use a default gamma value of 10. 
 
9 For the Tier 3b method (stack testing), gamma values are also provided for remote plasma clean (RPC) for FCs and for thin-
film deposition (TFD) for N2O. The Tier 2a and 2b methods require apportioning between TFD and “Other” N2O processes 
and between RPC and other FC processes and therefore do not need gamma values for TFD and RPC.

BOX 6.3 (NEW) 
THE IMPORTANCE AND LIMITATIONS OF THE DEFAULT GAMMA VALUES FOR CALCULATING AI AND AK,I 
To estimate the fraction of an FC abated when that FC is exhausted from both chamber cleaning 
processes and EWC processes, the Tier 2a, Tier 2b, and Tier 3b methods apply default weighting 
factors (γi,p and γk,i,p) to the numbers of abated and unabated tools running chamber cleaning 
processes (see Equations 6.10 and 6.11). (As discussed above, the Tier 3b method also applies 
default weighting factors to the numbers of abated and unabated tools running N2O-using TFD 
processes.) These default weighting factors have been introduced in the Refinement because, for 
most FCs, the Tier 2a, Tier 2b, and Tier 3b methods do not otherwise track per-tool emissions by 
process type (i.e., through apportioning), and per-tool emissions can vary significantly between 
process types. For example, C2F6 input gas flows (and emissions) for chamber cleaning processes 
can typically be in the order of one or more litres per minute while C2F6 input gas flows (and 
emissions) for etching processes are only typically in the order of one tenth to a few tenth of litres 
per minute. These differences are reflected in the default gamma values, which range from 1.4 to 26 
for FC input gases, for example. Not accounting for such differences (that is, using unweighted tool 
counts) could result in large errors in the emissions estimate when the fraction of process tools 
equipped with emissions control technologies is different for different process types.  (Note: Where 
the Tier 2a and 2b methods do track emissions and emission reductions by process type, that is, for 
NF3 and C3F8 used in RPC and for N2O used in either TFD or “other” processes, Equations 6.18 
and 6.19 should be used to calculate the fractions of input gas and by-products abated for each of 
those process types.)  
Default gamma values have been calculated based on the consumption patterns of representative 
semiconductor manufacturing facilities, accounting for the emissions of unreacted gases i and by-
products k as well as for the number of tools emitting gases i or by-products k in such facilities. The 
default gamma values therefore represent industry averages. However, the gammas found for 
individual facilities are highly variable depending on gas usage patterns at those facilities. For 
example, two facilities could have similar numbers of etching tools and use similar total quantities 
of a particular FC in their etching processes. However, one of the facilities may concentrate their 
use of that FC in a relatively small subset of their etching tools (e.g., because that FC is the only gas 
used in that subset of tools), while the other facility may spread their use of that FC across all of 
their etching tools (e.g., because that FC is used in combination with other FCs in the tools). The 
per-tool emissions of the FC from etching for the first facility would be much higher than the per-
tool emissions of the FC from etching at the second. If the per-tool emissions from TFD tools were 
the same at both facilities, the first facility’s gamma factor (ratio of per-tool emissions from TFD 
tools to per-tool emissions from etch tools) would be much smaller than the second facility’s gamma 
factor. As a result of such variability, the gamma values are highly uncertain (see Table 6.22) and 
can lead to errors in emissions estimates. 
Because actual (site-specific) γi,p and γk,i,p values may significantly differ from the defaults used in 
the Tier 2a and 2b methods, and because – as a result – the Tier 2a method is highly uncertain, 
inventory compilers are strongly encouraged to apportion gas consumption by process type and to 
use the Tier 2c method, a hybrid Tier 2c / Tier 3a method, or ultimately a full Tier 3a method. If 
apportioning gas usage proves problematic for a particular facility, the Tier 3b method could be an 
alternate approach providing higher accuracy without the need to develop a complex apportioning 
model for the facility.

Finally, inventory compilers should calculate, for each reporting site, the average uptime of all emissions control 
systems connected to process tools (UT), using Equation 6.12. To this end, inventory compilers should account 
for the total time (Tdn) that any emissions control system n connected to process tool(s) in the reporting facility is 
not in operational mode when at least one of the manufacturing tools connected to emissions control system n is 
in operation, and the total time (TTn) in which emissions control system n has at least one associated manufacturing 
tool in operation. For determining the amount of tool operating time, inventory compilers may assume that tools 
that were installed for the whole of the year were operated for 525,600 minutes per year. For tools that were 
installed or uninstalled during the year, inventory compilers should prorate the operating time to account for the 
days in which the tool was not installed and treat any partial day that a tool was installed as a full day (1,440 
minutes) of tool operation. For an emissions control system that has more than one connected tool, the tool 
operating time is 525,600 minutes per year if at least one tool was installed at all times throughout the year. For 
tools that are idle with no gas flowed through the tool for part of the year, inventory compilers may calculate total 
tool time using the actual time that gas is flowing through the tool. Inventory compilers should also note that UT 
may be set to one (1) if suitable backup emissions control equipment or interlocking with the process tool is 
implemented for each emissions control system. Thus, using interlocked process tools or backup emissions control 
systems reduces uncertainty by eliminating the need to estimate UT for the reporting facility.

Tier 2b method 
The Tier 2b method is applicable to the semiconductor sub-sector and to MEMS manufacturing that uses tools and 
processes similar to those used to manufacture semiconductors (for further details see discussion in the Choice of 
method section, in particular footnote 3). As discussed in section 6.2.1, the Tier 2b method is preferred over the 
Tier 2a method unless it is not possible to distinguish gas consumption by wafer size (e.g., for semiconductor 
manufacturing facilities that process multiple wafer sizes and cannot apportion gas consumption between them).  
The Tier 2b method uses the same set of equations as the Tier 2a method (Equations 6.5 to 6.12), but distinct Ui, 
Bk,i, γi,p, and γk,i,p default factors are provided by the wafer size being manufactured (≤200 mm vs. 300 mm, see 
Tables 6.8 and 6.9). With this distinction in mind, all other site-specific Tier 2b factors (which are the same as for 
the Tier 2a method) are estimated in the same manner as for the Tier 2a method. Thus, inventory compilers using 
the Tier 2b method should have direct communication with industry to gather consumption and emissions control-
related data and verify that emissions control technologies for which reductions are being claimed are installed 
and used in accordance with the guidance provided in section 6.2.2.1. 
 Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
 
6.30 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Total Tier 2b emissions are calculated using Equations 6.5, 6.6, and 6.7 and are equal to the sum of emissions from 
all unreacted gases i used in the production process (Ei), plus emissions of all by-products k (BPEk) resulting from 
the conversion of all input gases i used during production, plus emissions of CF4 from hydrocarbon-fuel-based 
combustion emissions control systems (EABi,CF4). As in the Tier 2a method, EABi,CF4 may be set to zero if the 
emissions control equipment manufacturer can certify that reactions between hydrocarbon fuel and F2 to form CF4 
is not occurring within their emissions control system (i.e. certify that ABi,CF4 = 0). 
 
Tier 2c method 
The Tier 2c method is applicable to the semiconductor, display, and PV sub-sectors, and to MEMS manufacturing 
that is carried out using tools and processes similar to those used to manufacture semiconductors (for further details 
see discussion in the Choice of method section, in particular footnote 3). The Tier 2c method is based on a set of 
equations that account for default emission factors that are provided for distinct process types p (Ui,p and Bk,i,p). In 
the Tier 2c method for the semiconductor sub-sector, there are six process types p defined as 1) etching and wafer 
cleaning (EWC), 2) remote plasma cleaning (RPC), 3) in-situ plasma cleaning (IPC), 4) in-situ thermal cleaning (ITC), 
5) N2O TFD, and 6) N2O ‘Other’. In the Tier 2c method for the display sub-sector there are only 4 process types p 
defined as 1) etching, 2) remote plasma cleaning (RPC), 3) in-situ plasma cleaning (IPC), and 4) N2O TFD. In the 
case of the Tier 2c method for the PV subsector, process types are defined as 1) etch and 2) TFD chamber cleaning. 
In addition, the Tier 2c method provides distinct emission factors for different substrate sizes for the semiconductor 
sub-sector (≤200 mm and 300 mm), but the Tier 2c method does not distinguish emission factors for different 
substrate size for the display sub-sector (the same Tier 2c default emissions factors are applicable to display 
manufacturing tools for generations 4, 5, 6, 7, etc.) and the PV sub-sector.  
The Ui,p and Bk,i,p default emission factors for the Tier 2c method are included in Tables 6.10 to 6.11 for the 
semiconductor sub-sector (≤200 mm and 300 mm substrate sizes respectively), Table 6.12 for the display sub-
sector, and Table 6.13 for the PV sub-sector. The other default emission factors used for the Tier 2c method are 
the destruction removal efficiencies (DRE) of gases i and by-products k (di, dk - see Table 6.17), which are assumed 
to be the same across all sub-sectors and across all Tier 2 methods. The Tier 2c method also uses site-specific 
factors (Ci,p, Di,p, Dk,i,p, ai,p, ak,i,p, ni,p,a, ni,p, nk,i,p,a, nk,i,p, UTp, Tdn,p, TTn,p), and inventory compilers using the Tier 
2c method should directly communicate with industry to gather consumption and emissions control-related data 
and to ensure that reductions are not attributed to emissions control devices unless the devices are installed and 
used in accordance with the guidance provided in section 6.2.2.1. Inventory compilers should note that the 
consumption of gas i (Ci,p) takes into account the heel factor (hi,l), which represents the fraction of gas i remaining 
in the shipping container after use, and which can be based on industry-wide default or site-specific measured 
values (see Section on Gas Consumption and Apportioning).  
As discussed in section 6.2.1, the use of the Tier 2c method is preferred over the Tier 2a or Tier 2b methods in the 
semiconductor sub-sector because the Tier 2c default emission factors are expected to be more accurate than the Tier 
2b or 2a factors. However, using the Tier 2c method requires apportioning gas consumption for all gases and process 
types, which introduces additional complexity. Please see the section on Gas Consumption and Apportioning for 
further detail.  
Tier 2c total emissions are equal to the sum of emissions from all unreacted gases i used in the production process 
(Ei) plus the emissions of all by-products k (BPEk) resulting from the conversion of all input gases i used during 
production, plus emissions of CF4 from hydrocarbon-fuel-based combustion emissions control systems (EABi,CF4, 
which may be set to zero if the emissions control equipment manufacturer can certify that reactions between 
hydrocarbon fuel and F2 to form CF4 is not occurring within their emissions control systems).  Tier 2c emissions 
are calculated using process-type-dependent Equations 6.13 to 6.20.

When neither the gases used nor the films etched or cleaned contain carbon, the Bk,i,p factors may be equated to 
zero in Equation 6.14. When both carbon-containing and non-carbon-containing films are included in the film 
stacks forming final electronic devices,  there are two options: 1) if it is practical to track the gas consumption used 
to clean or etch films containing carbon vs. not containing carbon, the non-zero and zero Bk.i,p factors may be 
applied accordingly, or 2) if it is not practical or desired to track gas consumption to this level of detail, the non-
zero BPE factors should be applied to all consumption of a gas if any film containing carbon is run with that gas 
during the year. (See Box 6.2 and the discussion under Equation 6.6 for more on this issue.) 
When NF3 is used in RPC processes or F2 is used as an input gas and when hydrocarbon-fuel-based combustion 
emissions control technology is used, direct reaction with hydrocarbon fuel and F2 (including F2 resulting from the 
decomposition of NF3 in RPC processes) to form CF4 can occur. Unless the emissions control equipment original 
equipment manufacturer (OEM) or electronics manufacturer can certify that the rate of conversion from F2 to CF4 
or from NF3 to CF4 is <0.1 percent on a mass basis, Equation 6.15 should be used to estimate the amount of CF4

The use of gamma weighting factors is not required in the Tier 2c method because uncontrolled emissions from 
different process types are accounted for separately through gas consumption allocation. Instead, to estimate the 
site-specific ai,p value, inventory compilers may calculate the ratio of the number of tools running process type p 
(emitting gas i) that are equipped with suitable emissions control technologies (ni,p,a) to the total number of  tools 
running process type p and emitting gas i, using Equation 6.18.“Suitable” means that an emissions control 
technology is capable of abating a particular gas to a minimum destruction removal efficiency in a site-specific 
worst-case scenario (please see Section 6.2.2.1 on Emissions Control Technology Factors for more details).  Note 
that inventory compilers may obtain more refined estimates of ai,p by counting the number of process chambers 
running process type p (emitting gas i) that are connected to suitable emissions control technologies, or by using 
other site-specific approaches that may be more accurate.

Finally, inventory compilers should calculate, for each reporting site, the average uptime of all emissions control 
systems connected to process tools running process type p (UTp), using Equation 6.20. To this end, inventory 
compilers should account for the total time (Tdn,p) that any emissions control system n connected to process tool(s) 
running process type p in the reporting facility is not in operational mode when at least one of the manufacturing 
tools connected to emissions control system n is in operation, and the total time (TTn,p) in which emissions control 
system n has at least one associated manufacturing tool in operation. For determining the amount of tool operating 
time, inventory compilers may assume that tools that were installed for the whole of the year were operated for 
525,600 minutes per year. For tools that were installed or uninstalled during the year, inventory compilers should 
prorate the operating time to account for the days in which the tool was not installed and treat any partial day that 
a tool was installed as a full day (1,440 minutes) of tool operation. For an emissions control system that has more 
than one connected tool, the tool operating time is 525,600 minutes per year if at least one tool was installed at all 
times throughout the year. For tools that are idle with no gas flowed through the tool for part of the year, inventory 
compilers may calculate total tool time using the actual time that gas is flowing through the tool. Inventory 
compilers should also note that UTp may be set to one (1) if suitable backup emissions control equipment or 
interlocking with the process tool is implemented for each emissions control system. Thus, using interlocked 
process tools or backup emissions control systems reduces uncertainty by eliminating the need to estimate UT for 
the reporting facility.

ADAPTING TIER 2 METHODS TO ACCOUNT FOR TECHNOLOGICAL 
CHANGES 
Given the rapid pace of technological change in electronics manufacturing, Tier 2 default emission factors may 
need to be supplemented or updated in order to remain representative of industry emission rates.  A change in any 
of the following parameters can result in the Tier 2 default emission factors becoming unrepresentative:  
• 
Substrate type (e.g. Si, SiC, or glass) and size (e.g., moving to 450 mm wafers in semiconductor 
manufacturing); 
 Chapter 6: Electronics Industry Emissions 
 
 
 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
6.35 
• 
Use of a new gas in an existing process type (i.e. in-situ plasma cleaning, remote plasma cleaning, or in-situ 
thermal cleaning; etching; thin film deposition process) or use of a new process type; 
• 
Film type introduced after 2018; 
• 
Tool platform introduced by a supplier after 2018 or those introduced earlier but used for a new process type;  
• 
Use of new input process GHGs, use of new combinations of process greenhouse gases, or use of low- or no-
GWP materials that have the potential to form GHG by-products. 
 
If default emission factors are not available under Tier 2 (e.g., a new gas or process type is introduced), facilities 
can estimate emissions using Tier 2 and assume a default emission factor (1-U) = 0.8 with by-product emission 
factors of 0.15 for CF4 and 0.05 for C2F6. 10  Alternatively, facilities can undertake process emissions 
characterization under Tier 3a and use a hybrid method. A hybrid method would involve applying the Tier 2 
defaults to processes and technologies that have not changed while applying Tier 3a site-specific emission factors 
to processes and technologies that have changed. It is good practice to undertake process emissions 
characterization and use a hybrid method when the new gas and process type combination accounts for 1 percent 
or more of facility GHG consumption by mass and results in estimated emissions of more than 500 mtCO2e, based 
on the 0.8, 0.15, and 0.05 default emission factors above. 
It is good practice for inventory compilers to work with electronics manufacturers to periodically assess whether 
Tier 2 defaults remain representative of manufacturing conditions, considering the criteria above. If the Tier 2 
defaults are found not to be representative in one or more respects, inventory compilers should work with 
electronics manufacturers to encourage use of hybrid Tier 2 and Tier 3a methods, or to develop country-specific 
default emission factors that reflect the applicable technological and process changes cited above. Any country-
specific default emission factors should represent the full range of processes in the country for each process type, 
including not only the emission factors for the new or changed processes, but also emission factors for previously 
existing processes that are still used. Most countries are likely to find it challenging to develop robust, 
representative country-specific emission factors, and technological changes in a particular country are likely to 
quickly diffuse into other countries. Thus, it is generally preferable to refine default emission factors at the global 
rather than at the country level. In this context, facilities are encouraged to report measured emission factors to the 
IPCC Emission Factor Database (EFDB) in a transparent manner through a process allowing protection of any 
underlying confidential information.  
Figure 6.2. Decision tree to determine need for measured emission factors, should be used to determine when Tier 
3a measured emission factors may be necessary to supplement Tier 2 default emission factors. 
In the case where a new substrate type or size will be used in a facility (e.g., 450 mm wafers), emission factors 
may be measured and applied in phases. For example, in the first year of operation of the 450 mm fab, 300 mm 
Tier 2c default factors could be used to estimate emissions.  In subsequent years, Tier 2 defaults should be used to 
estimate emissions for up to 50 percent of total gas used in year 2; 25 percent in year 3; 10 percent in year 4; and 
0 percent in year 5. See the discussion of the Tier 3a method below for criteria to prioritize these measurements. 
Once measurements of the 450 mm processes are complete, inventory compilers should work with semiconductor 
manufacturers to recalculate emissions from years 1-4 to ensure time series consistency. 
 
 
 
10 These defaults assume that all of the input gas is either emitted or converted into CF4 or C2F6.  In the majority of cases where 
emission factor data are available, both CF4 and C2F6 are emitted as by-products.  The default (1-U) is conservatively based on the least 
efficient (1-U) for etch or wafer cleaning processes (0.8 for C2F6 in Table 6.10). Due to a generally higher CF4 by-product emission factor 
for most input gas/process combinations, the majority (75 percent) of the remaining mass is assigned to CF4 and the rest to C2F6.

TIER 3 METHODS – SITE-SPECIFIC PARAMETERS 
Tier 3a – Measured process-specific parameters 
The Tier 3a method can be applied to all sub-sectors covered in Chapter 6 (semiconductor, display, PV and MEMS) 
and uses the same set of equations as the Tier 2c method; however, Tier 3a uses measured values for parameters 
in Equations 6.13 to 6.20 (see Table 6.3 for details). As discussed earlier, Tier 3a measured emission factors may 
be used to supplement Tier 2 default factors where some, but not all, processes and technologies have changed. 
Tier 3a can also be undertaken to develop facility-specific emission factors for broader application in the facility. 
For example, a facility may have abatement efficiencies that are different from the default DRE values for emission 
control systems installed on a certain subset of process tools, or may account for emissions from a particular recipe 
or technology that is more efficient or that may have been developed for the purpose of reducing emissions. Note 
that in the case of a comprehensive technology change, such as the adoption of a new substrate size (e.g., 450 mm 
in semiconductor industry), the Tier 3a method would be broadly applied.  
For the Tier 3a method, the (1-Ui,p) and Bk,i,p emission factors in Equations 6.13 to 6.15 and 6.18 to 6.19 are 
measured for recipes or for families of similar recipes. Thus, the main distinction between the Tier 3a method and 
the Tier 2c method is that, for the Tier 3a method, p in Equations 6.13 to 6.20 is to be interpreted as meaning a 
‘recipe’ or a family of similar recipes. A recipe can be defined as a specific combination of process conditions 
(input gas type and flows, plasma power, pressure, temperature, duration, etc.) and technologies used to etch 
patterns onto electronics devices, to clean film deposition chambers, or to deposit films on substrates. A centreline 
recipe can be used to establish Tier 3a emission factors for a recipe and each family of similar recipes. Recipes are 
deemed ‘similar’ when the centreline process can reasonably be deemed representative of facility-specific process 
conditions despite potential variability of such process conditions around the centreline process during normal 
manufacturing operations, and when the substrate size, process type, tool platform and process chamber, film type 
(SiOx, SiOxNy, SixNy, W, etc.), and input process gas(es) are the same.  However, even when similar recipes are 
grouped, it may not be practicable or economically feasible to implement the Tier 3a methodology across 
all families of similar recipes or across the many emissions control systems that may be used in a 
particular electronics manufacturing facility. For this reason, it is good practice for facilities undertaking a more 
comprehensive Tier 3a approach to prioritize testing as follows: 
1. Recipe families with highest GHG usage (e.g., chamber cleans) and/or expected emissions should be 
tested first (e.g., testing should account for the top 75 percent of total process greenhouse gas usage in kg 
and the top 50 percent of emissions in kg CO2e.). 
2. Stable processes which do not change from wafer to wafer or run to run should have higher priority than 
processes that change frequently. 
 
Whenever Tier 3a measurements are made, the reporting facility should document the following: 
• 
Date measurements were made; 
• 
Industry sub-sector; 
• 
Substrate size; 
• 
Process type; 
• 
Film type; 
• 
Tool manufacturer, platform and model/chamber name; 
• 
Input gases; 
• 
Process conditions (gas flows, pressure, temperature, power, duration, etc.); 
• 
Input gas emission factors; 
• 
By-product emission factors;  
• 
Fluorine mass balance closure; 
• 
Measurement protocol used.    
 
In addition, facilities using the 3a approach should document all facility-specific process emission factors or 
emissions control equipment DREs that have been measured by the reporting facility, document which recipes are 
deemed similar to the measured centreline process, use the measured Tier 3a factors for all similar recipes, and be

6.38 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
able to demonstrate to a reasonable degree of certainty that the Tier 3a approach does lead to increased accuracy 
in reporting emissions. When facility-specific emission factors or destruction removal efficiencies have been 
measured for a particular recipe or for a family of similar recipes and for a particular emissions control technology 
or emissions control system, it is NOT good practice to revert to default Tier 2 emission factors when such default 
emission factors are more favourable than the corresponding measured Tier 3a factors as such practice would result 
in knowingly underestimating emissions. 
 
Tier 3b method—Stack testing 
The Tier 3b method may be applied to all sub-sectors covered in Chapter 6 (semiconductor, display, PV and 
MEMS).  Stack testing measures the amount of greenhouse gases emitted from a specific facility through stack 
systems.  A stack system is considered to be one or more stacks that are connected by a common header or 
manifold, through which an FC- or N2O-containing gas stream originating from one or more processes is, or has 
the potential to be, released to the atmosphere. Stack testing is a method commonly used by electronic devices 
manufacturing facilities to quantify emissions and demonstrate compliance for regulated pollutants used in 
manufacturing, such as acid gases (e.g., hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen chloride, fluorine, nitric acid, ammonia) and 
volatile organic compounds (VOCs).  The individual process chamber operations that use greenhouse gases, as is 
the case with acid gases and VOCs, are conducted as batch processes. The fact that they are run concurrently, in 
rapid succession on a large number of tools which are exhausted to typically a relatively small number of stacks, 
leads to the expectation that the emissions will largely emulate a continuous process.   
The analytical methods available for measuring greenhouse gas emissions from facility stack systems are Fourier 
Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and gas chromatography followed by mass spectrometry (GC/MS).  In 
the case of FTIR, the analytical instrument is brought to the stack system for in-situ analysis. In the case of the 
GC/MS approach, stack emission samples are collected using sample containers and transported to a laboratory 
for analysis.  
Stack testing may be used to develop site-specific emission factors. The stack method may not be appropriate for 
facilities with many stacks, frequent changes in production technology or product mix, or an inability to track gas 
use during testing or emissions control equipment uptime during testing.  It is important to perform stack testing 
when production levels in the fab are representative of year-round production, and when emissions control system 
uptime is representative of year-round uptime.   
 
Testing Frequency 
It is good practice for reporting facilities to test all stack systems at the reporting facility that have the potential to 
emit greenhouse gases in the first year of testing.  Typically, this means all acid and caustic/alkali stack systems 
at the facility should be tested because these are generally the stack systems connected to processes using FC 
compounds in a fab.  It is also important to test all stacks on relevant stack systems during the first year of testing 
to determine that there are negligible differences in flow or concentration between these stacks.  If a facility 
determines that no substantive changes have occurred in the year following a stack test, the emission factors 
determined may remain unchanged and retesting is not required; however, stack testing should occur every 3 years 
at a minimum.  In subsequent years, reporting facilities may consider less frequent testing for stack systems that 
comprise less than 10 percent of total process GHG emissions (expressed in CO2e).  On the other hand, facilities 
with a highly variable product mix should consider undertaking annual testing for the first three years to assess the 
impact that the changing product mix has on their measured emission factors.  For all facilities, the following are 
considered to be substantive changes, and testing should be undertaken in the subsequent year after a stack test if 
any of the following are met: 
 
(i) 
If annual consumption, in terms of CO2e, for any individual FC gas compared with the total of 
all FC gases changes by more than 10 percentage points from the most recent emissions test.  
For example, if the use of a single gas converted to CO2e goes from 25 percent of total gas 
consumption to greater than 35 percent of total gas consumption, a retest would be triggered for 
the subsequent year. 
(ii)  
Annual consumption of an FC that was not used during the emissions test and that is not included 
in the facility-specific emission factors rises to 5 percent (expressed in CO2e) of the annual FC 
consumption of the fab. (For FCs that were not used during the emissions test and whose 
consumption falls below 5% of annual fab consumption, Tier 2 or 3a methods should be used to 
estimate emissions to ensure completeness.) 
 Chapter 6: Electronics Industry Emissions 
 
 
 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
6.39 
(iii)  
A change by more than 20 percent in the fraction of process tools equipped with emissions 
control systems, compared to the fraction during the most recent emissions test. 
(iv)  
A change in the substrate size used by the facility since the most recent emissions test. 
 
Stack test method 
For each stack system in the reporting facility for which testing is required, inventory compilers should measure 
the emissions of each FC gas and N2O from the stack system by conducting an emission test using the methods 
mentioned in Table 6.14, or their equivalents.  In addition, inventory compilers should measure the facility-specific 
emissions and consumption of each FC and N2O according to the following steps: 
• 
Measure total gas flow rate up the stack on the test day using EPA Method 1 or 2 or an equivalent method. 
• 
Measure process GHG concentrations of designated gases from relevant stacks using an analytical method 
with demonstrated accuracy.  The analytical method should be validated using US EPA Method 320 or an 
equivalent validation method. 
• 
Emissions testing should be conducted during a period of 8 hours or longer per stack system while the facility 
is operating at a representative level with representative emissions control system uptime. (Representative 
uptime is particularly important for emission control systems that have not been certified not to form CF4 from 
F2 exhausted by the process.)  Representative in this case means that normal process tools’ or emissions control 
systems’ maintenance is being performed during the stack emissions test and that processes running during 
the test are indicative of normal facility operations. 
• 
Measurements should be taken for N2O and all FC gases known to be used by the facility and any possible 
FC gas by-products.  It is recommended measurements be taken for CF4, C2F6, C3F8, C4F8, C5F8, CHF3, CH2F2, 
and CH3F as these gases may be formed as by-products. 
• 
The amount of each FC and N2O gas consumed by each facility during the sampling period should be 
determined. Where starting and ending gas container pressures are used to estimate consumption, appropriate 
adjustments for temperature and deviations from ideal gas law behaviour should be made (e.g., by applying 
the Redlich, Kwong, Soave equation of state with appropriate values for each FC gas and N2O).  Because 
stack testing is conducted over a relatively brief period, measurements and calculations of gas consumption 
during that period should be precise to ensure that the resulting emission factors are accurate. 
• 
If consumption of an FC gas is too low to be accurately measured during the testing period, then in order to 
account for usage, either the testing period should be increased or consumption should be calculated for the 
testing period by pro-rating long-term consumption data. 
 
Inventory compilers should calculate the emissions of each FC gas and N2O consumed as an input gas using 
Equation 6.21 and each FC gas formed as a by-product using Equation 6.22.  If a stack system is comprised of 
multiple stacks, inventory compilers should sum the emissions from each stack in the stack system when using 
Equation 6.21 or Equation 6.22.

When calculating emissions, inventory compilers should use the following guidance and the accompanying 
requirements of recognized maximum field detection limits (FDLs) as detailed in Table 6.15.  Field detection 
limits for instrumentation used in stack testing should not exceed those depicted in Table 6.15 
a. 
If an FC gas or N2O is consumed during the sampling period, but its emissions are not detected, the ½ FDL 
value determined for the target compound should be used for the value of Xi,s,m in Equation 6.21 . 
b. 
If an FC gas or N2O is consumed during the sampling period but only detected intermittently during the 
sampling period, the detected concentration should be used for the value of Xi,s,m in Equation 6.21 when 
available, and a concentration corresponding to one-half of the FDL determined for the target compound 
should be used for the value of Xi,s,m when the target compound is not detected. 
c. 
If an FC gas is not consumed during the sampling period, is not detected during the sampling period, but is 
an expected by-product, a concentration corresponding to one-half of the FDL determined for the target 
compound should be used for the value of Xk,s,m in Equation 6.22.  Expected by-products are CF4, C2F6, 
CHF3, CH2F2, and CHF3. 
d. 
If an FC gas or N2O is not consumed during the sampling period, is not detected during the sampling period, 
and is not an expected by-product listed in c above, then inventory compilers may assume that emissions for 
the target compound for the tested stack system are zero. 
After calculating ESi,s and ESk,s, inventory compilers should calculate a facility-specific emission factor for each 
input gas consumed (in kg of FC gas or N2O emitted per kg of input gas i consumed) in the tools that vent to stack 
systems that are tested, as applicable. For FC gases, use Equations 6.23a and 6.23b or 6.23a and 6.23c of this 
section.  For N2O, always use Equation 6.23b, even if this results in an emission factor greater than 1. 
Equation 6.23a calculates ESimax,f, the controlled emissions that would result during the sampling period if the 
utilization rate for the FC input gas i were equal to 0.2 (the minimum discussed above in “Adapting Tier 2 Methods 
to Account for Technological Changes”).  If ∑sESi,s  (the total measured emissions of the FC across all stack 
systems) falls below ESimax,f, then use Equation 6.23b to calculate EFi,f (the abated 1-U factor for the FC input gas

i). If ∑sESi,s equals or exceeds ESimax,f, use Equation 6.23c to calculate EFi,f, and treat the difference between 
∑sESi,s and ESimax,f as a by-product of the other input gases, using Equation 6.24 of this section.

an FC input gas i for which ∑sESi,s equals or exceeds ESimax,f, inventory compilers should exclude the consumption 
of that input gas from the term ∑ Activityi,f.

Finally, inventory compilers should calculate, for each reporting site, the average uptime of all emissions control 
equipment connected to process tools for facility f (UTf), using Equation 6.27. To this end, inventory compilers 
should account for the total time (Tdn,f) that any emissions control equipment n connected to process tool(s) in 
reporting facility f is not in operational mode when at least one of the manufacturing tools connected to emissions 
control equipment n is in operation, and the total time (TTn,f) in which emissions control equipment n has at least 
one associated manufacturing tool in operation.  For determining the amount of tool operating time, inventory 
compilers may assume that tools that were installed for the whole of the year were operated for 525,600 minutes 
per year.  Inventory compilers should adjust the total minutes to reflect sampling time for the purposes of Equation 
6.23 and Equation 6.24.  For tools that were installed or uninstalled during the year, inventory compilers should 
prorate the operating time to account for the days in which the tool was not installed and treat any partial day that 
a tool was installed as a full day (1,440 minutes) of tool operation.  For an emissions control equipment that has 
more than one connected tool, the tool operating time is 525,600 minutes per year if at least one tool was installed 
at all times throughout the year.  For tools that are idle with no gas flowed through the tool for part of the year, 
inventory compilers may calculate total tool time using the actual time that gas is flowing through the tool. 
Inventory compilers should also note that UTf may be set to one (1) if suitable backup emissions control equipment

or interlocking with the process tool is implemented for each emissions control system.  Thus, using interlocked

the reporting facility.  Facility records such as maintenance records for emissions control systems can also be used 
to estimate emissions control system uptime.

6.2.1.2 FLUORINATED LIQUIDS 
Fluorinated liquids are used as HTFs for temperature control, device testing, cleaning substrate surfaces and other 
parts, and soldering in certain types of electronics manufacturing production processes. Leakage and evaporation 
of these fluids during use is a source of fluorinated greenhouse gas emissions. 
Fluorinated liquid emissions consist primarily of hydrofluoroethers, perfluoropolyethers (including PFPMIE) and 
other fully fluorinated liquids (perfluorinated amines and perfluoroalkylmorpholines). With the exception of the 
hydrofluoroethers, all of these compounds are very long-lived in the atmosphere and have high GWPs (near 
10,000). It should be noted that some lower GWP fluorinated liquids have been marketed in recent years for some 
applications, but that such materials may be regulated in some regions (e.g. as volatile organic compounds), and 
this should be considered when choosing alternative fluorinated liquids. Table 6.5 lists fluorinated liquids that are 
commonly used in the electronics industry, along with their 100-year GWPs. Note that the list of fluorinated liquids 
in Table 6.5 is not exhaustive and that additional fluorinated liquids may be used.

1The GWP in the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) is provided if the compound has a GWP in AR4. Otherwise, the GWP in the Fifth 
Assessment Report (AR5) is provided.   
2This is the GWP for the PFPMIE distillate fraction that is sold under the name Solvay Galden HT-70 (Young et al).  Solvay has stated that 
the HT, LS, HS, SV, and Perfluorosolv series, as well as DET, D02, D02-TS, D03, and D05, have similar chemical structures (varying only 
in their chain lengths) and are manufactured with the same production process. They differ in their molecular weights because they are 
different fractions of the source “bulk fluid.”  
3The GWPs for these compounds have not been published in the peer-reviewed literature. However, evaluations by the manufacturer indicate 
that their GWPs are near 10,000 (US Federal Register Volume 78, Issue 66 (April 5, 2013), pp. 20632-37). This is expected given that these 
compounds are both fully fluorinated and saturated, as are, for example, the PFCs listed above. The US EPA assigns a default 100-year GWP 
of 10,000 to compounds that are both saturated and fully fluorinated and that do not have chemical-specific GWPs in either the Fourth or the 
Fifth Assessment Reports. 
4In addition to the PFCs and HFCs listed here, some facilities reporting emissions under the US EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program 
have reported emissions of SF6 and low-boiling point PFCs and HFCs that are used as heat transfer fluids. 
5The US EPA estimates a 100-year GWP for methoxytridecafluoroheptene of 2.5 (US Federal Register Volume 80, page 42058, July 16, 
2015) and a 100-year GWP for trans-1,2-dichloroethylene of less than five due to its structure and brief atmospheric lifetime (US Federal 
Register Volume 81, page 32241, May 23, 2016). 
6The GWPs for these compounds have not been published in the peer-reviewed literature. However, based on their similarity to HFEs for 
which GWPs have been published (saturated HFEs and HCFEs with 3 or more carbon-hydrogen bonds), the US EPA assigns a default 100-
year GWP of 270 to these compounds. 
 
There are two methods for estimating emissions from the use of fluorinated liquids. The choice of methods will 
depend on the availability of inventory data on the use of fluorinated liquids and is outlined in the decision tree 
(see Figure 6.3, Decision Tree for Estimation of FC Emissions from Fluorinated Liquids, and see Section 1.5 of 
Chapter 1, Choosing between the Mass Balance and Emission Factor Approach).   
 
TIER 1 – FLUORINATED LIQUIDS 
Tier 1 is appropriate when company-specific data are not available on the consumption of fluorinated liquids. Tier 
1 factors are available for semiconductor manufacturing (including both factors for heat transfer fluid applications 
and for testing, packaging and soldering) and for display (for heat transfer fluid applications). It is the less accurate 
of the two methods for estimating emissions from losses of fluorinated liquids. The method, unlike the Tier 2 
method, gives estimates of emissions for three fluorinated liquids that represent the three main types of compounds 
used as heat transfer fluids globally (see Table 6.18). For any class of electronic products (semiconductor, MEMS, 
display), the default emission factors are multiplied by the annual production, P. For fluorinated heat transfer fluid 
applications, P is the area of substrate processed in units of square meters (m2). For testing, packaging and soldering, 
P is the number of packaged devices in thousands (kpcs). The result is a set of annual emissions estimates expressed 
in kg of materials emitted during the manufacture of a particular class of electronic products. The Tier 1 method 
for estimating emissions from fluorinated liquids is analogous to the Tier 1 method for estimating greenhouse gas 
emissions during electronic devices manufacturing. The formula is shown in Equation 6.28.

plant production capacity utilisation (fraction) of that producer.

2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
6.47 
For semiconductor manufacturing, it is good practice to apply equation 6.28 twice—once to estimate emissions 
of fluorinated liquids from heat transfer fluid applications and again to estimate emissions of fluorinated liquids 
from testing, packaging, and soldering—and then to sum the results of both calculations to obtain total emissions 
of fluorinated liquids. Tier 1 factors for fluorinated liquids are not available for PV. Tier 1 factors are also not 
available for substrate cleaning.  Thus, the Tier 2 approach should be used to estimate fluorinated liquid 
emissions from these sources.  
TIER 2 METHOD – FLUORINATED LIQUIDS 
There is one Tier 2 method for estimating actual emissions from the use of any and each fluorinated liquid, 
applicable to all electronics manufacturing sub-sectors (semiconductor, display MEMS, PV) and to each 
application (temperature control, device testing, cleaning substrate surfaces and other parts, and soldering). This 
method is a mass-balance approach that accounts for fluorinated liquid usage over an annual period. This Tier 2 
method is appropriate when company-specific data are available; it is the only method applicable to the use of 
fluorinated liquids for cleaning substrates surfaces and other parts, and for the PV sub-sector. Over the course of 
a year, fluorinated liquids are used to fill newly purchased equipment and to replace fluorinated liquid loss from 
equipment operation through evaporation. Inventory compilers should provide the chemical composition of the 
fluid(s) for which emissions are estimated for each application. The method is expressed in Equation 6.29.

6.2.2 
Choice of emission factors 
This section provides the default emission factors that should be used for reporting emissions under the Tier 1 and 
Tier 2 methods. Please refer to the corresponding emission factor tables (Tables 6.6 to 6.13 and Tables 6.17 and 
6.18) for each method. 
The main sources of default emission factors are the U.S. EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule (GHGRP, 40 U.S. 
Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 98; Subpart I), the 2006 IPCC Guidelines (Volume 3, Chapter 6), the 
World Semiconductor Council (2011, 2012, 2014 and 2016), the World Display device Industry Cooperation 
Committee, and industry surveys conducted during the 2019 Refinement. 
In the case where a new input gas is used for which no default emission factor (1-Ui) has been established, facilities 
can estimate emissions using the Tier 2 methods and assume a default emission factor of (1-Ui) = 0.8 with by-
product emission factors of BCF4,i=0.15 and BC2F6,i=0.05. However, this provision could lead to incomplete and 
inaccurate results if the use of the new chemical leads to the formation of by-products other than CF4 and C2F6 or 
if the default emission factors fail to accurately represent actual emissions from the new gas or process. Thus, 
reporters should measure the emission factors for the new gas or process and use a partial Tier 3a method to 
account for emissions resulting from the use of the new chemical or new process if the consumption of the new 
gas exceeds 1 percent of the facility’s GHG consumption by mass.

6.49 
6.2.2.1 GASEOUS FLUORINATED COMPOUNDS AND NITROUS OXIDE  
TIER 1 
The default emission factors for the Tier 1 method are presented in Table 6.6 below.    Because the Tier 1 default 
emission factors for the semiconductor sector in Table 6.6 are based on a 50/50 split between 200mm and 300mm 
production, it is good practice to use the Tier 1 default emission factors for the semiconductor sector that are 
available in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines in cases where the wafer size produced is known to be 200 mm or smaller. 
In using Tier 1, it is not good practice to modify, in any way, the set of greenhouse gases or the values of the 
emission factors assumed in Table 6.6. For any given electronics manufacturing facility, inventory compilers 
should not combine emissions estimated using the Tier 1 method with emissions estimated using the Tier 2 or 3 
methods. For example, inventory compilers may not use the Tier 1 factor for CF4 to estimate the emissions of CF4 
from semiconductors and combine it with the results of other gases from a Tier 2 or Tier 3 method. It should also 
be noted that the Tier 1 emission factors presented in Table 6.6 should not be used for any purpose other than 
estimating annual process gas-aggregate emissions from semiconductor, display, MEMS, or PV manufacturing for 
compilation of the national greenhouse gas inventory. Tier 1 emissions for the semiconductor sub-sector are 
calculated based on the surface area of wafer produced. Display emissions are calculated based on the surface area 
of input glass corresponding to array processes, i.e. the processes used to manufacture the thin film transistors that 
are part of the display devices. Note that the array input glass area is different than the input glass area used for 
the manufacturing of colour filters used in display devices, which does not involve the use (or emissions) of 
fluorinated GHGs. Also note that the Tier 1 factors for MEMS are highly uncertain due to the fact that they were 
generated from a limited data set. Additionally, as previously discussed in the Choice of Method section, the high 
Tier 1 emission factor for SF6 corresponds to a MEMS-specific process consisting of etching vias through the 
substrate, a process which consumes significant amounts of SF6.

on seven years of data collected by the regions comprising the World Semiconductor Council (WSC), i.e. China, Chinese Taipei, Europe, 
Japan, Korea, and the United States. Included is data for facilities operated by WSC companies outside the WSC regions e.g., Singapore.  
The factors are calculated starting from the purchased quantities of the listed gases and by considering the emission factors reported in the 
Table 6.7 for Tier 2a, including the formation of by-products. The emissions calculated in this way have then been divided by the total area 
of silicon produced.  As the Tier 2a default emission factors used to develop the Tier 1 default emission factors for the semiconductor sector 
in Table 6.7 assumed a 50/50 split between 200mm and 300mm production, it is good practice to use the Tier 1 default emission factors 
for the semiconductors sector that are available in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines in cases where the wafer size produced is known to be 200 
mm or smaller. 
  
TIER 2 
The default emission factors for the Tier 2 methods are presented in Tables 6.7 to 6.13 and Table 6.17 below. 
Note that F2 and COF2 are included in the list of input gases for the Tier 2 methods because these gases are known 
to be used for TFD chamber cleaning and because the use of F2 and COF2 for chamber cleaning can lead to the 
formation of CF4 and other high-GWP by-products, but no data was available to derive emission factors for these 
gases. Note also that, although COF2 is a known by-product of chamber cleaning processes using fluorinated 
carbon gases (e.g. CF4, C2F6, etc.), no by-product factor for COF2 (i.e. BCOF2,i) was included in the Tier 2 default 
tables dues to the low GWP (~1) and short atmospheric life of COF2.

*Gamma weighting factors for semiconductor manufacturing may be applied to MEMS manufacturing processes that are carried out using tools 
and processes similar to those used to manufacture semiconductors (for further details see discussion in the Choice of method section, in particular 
footnote 3).  
† The gamma values for (IPC or ITC)/EWC for 200 mm were developed based on IPC only and the values for 300 mm were developed based on 
the total emissions and tool count from ITC and IPC. Gamma is assigned based on analogy due to similar emission factors for IPC and ITC, where 
known, for the same gas and wafer size. For all other cases where no gamma has been measured and a gamma is needed, compiler may assume γi 
= 10, γk = 10.

6.58                           2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
EMISSIONS CONTROL TECHNOLOGY FACTORS 
Since 2006, the performance of emissions control devices in production conditions has been more extensively 
characterized, and the 2019 Refinement provides revised default DRE values for a larger basket of gases (see Table 
6.17). Figure 6.4 provides guidance for deciding when a particular emissions control technology may be suitable 
to abate fluorinated compounds (FCs) and N2O emissions from electronic devices manufacturing, when default 
emissions control technology factors may be used, or when site-specific destruction removal efficiencies can or 
should be measured. With regards to emissions control equipment, “exhaust gases” refers to the combination of 
all gases exiting the process chamber (unreacted precursors plus by-products formed in the process), plus any gases 
subsequently added such as pump purge gases.  
First, in the case of emissions control technologies using hydrocarbon fuel, inventory compilers should consider 
whether emissions to be abated originate from NF3- or F2-based remote plasma clean (RPC) applications (step [1] 
in Figure 6.4). These processes lead to the formation of significant amounts of molecular fluorine (F2) originating 
from the conversion of NF3 into F2 or the limited utilization efficiency of F2 (when the latter is used as a cleaning 
precursor).  When the exhaust gases contain large amounts of F2 and when hydrocarbon-fuel-based combustion 
emissions control technology is used, direct reaction with the hydrocarbon fuel and F2 to form CF4 can occur.11,12,13 
Unless the emissions control system manufacturer (referred to below as the “original equipment manufacturer” or 
OEM”) or the electronic devices manufacturer can certify that the rate of conversion from F2 to CF4 or from NF3 
to CF4 is <0.1 percent on a mass basis, a default value of ABNF3,CF4 = 0.093 or ABF2,CF4 = 0.0116 should be used in 
Equations 6.7 (Tier 2a/2b) or Equation 6.15 (Tier 2c/3a) to estimate the amount of CF4 produced within and emitted 
from the emissions control device (step [2] in Figure 6.4).  
Second, inventory compilers should verify whether site-specific emissions control technologies are suitable for 
the gas to be abated (step [3] in Figure 6.4). In doing so, inventory compilers should consult Table 6.16, where an 
‘X’ indicates which technology is, in principle, capable of abating a certain gas. Definitions of common emissions 
control technologies are provided in the footnotes of Table 6.16. Note that the absence of an ‘X’ in Table 6.16 for 
a particular combination of gas and emissions control technology does not necessarily preclude the ability of the 
technology to abate a particular gas, but such ability should be supported by experimental data from the original 
equipment manufacturer (OEM) or the electronic devices manufacturer. Because new emissions control 
technologies could emerge, a ‘T’ in last row of Table 6.16 indicates that, to be considered as being suitable for 
treating a specific gas, the OEM or the electronic devices manufacturer would need to provide testing data to show 
that, when the new emissions control technology is tested under representative gas flow conditions, defaults (or 
site-specific) DREs can be achieved using an industry-accepted measurement methodology that accounts for 
dilution.14,15,16 
Third, inventory compilers should verify that emissions control systems have been tested and are certified by the 
OEM(s) to meet the default DRE values indicated in Table 6.17 (step [4] in Figure 6.4). To do so, the reporting 
facility should define its worst-case scenarios as the highest total FC or N2O flows through each model of emissions 
control systems (gas by gas and process type by process type across the facility) and highest total flow scenarios 
(with N2 dilution accounted for, see step [6]), and the reporting facility should request the emissions control 
equipment manufacturer(s) to certify that the default DREs can be met in the worst-case scenarios for each model 
of emissions control systems. In the case that the OEM(s) cannot certify that the emissions control system(s) can 
meet the default DRE values of Table 6.17 (step [5] of Figure 6.4), the corresponding DRE value should be set to 
zero (0 percent), or the reporting facility may set the DRE value using DREs measured by the electronics device 
manufacturer (site-specific DREs) or certified by the OEM using an industry-accepted measurement methodology 
for the site-specific worst case scenarios as previously described (OEM certified DREs).  If a facility wishes to 
claim a DRE value higher than the default DRE values of Table 6.17, it should perform site specific testing (step 
[7] of Figure 6.4).  When using site-specific DREs, a suitable DRE testing frequency should be adopted to ensure

that at least 5 percent of the installed emissions control equipment population is tested annually for a representative 
sample of process applications. To use OEM-specific DREs, it is good practice to state the test conditions and 
range of input process gas and total gas for which the DRE is applicable. 
Fourth, to ensure that DRE values remain accurate, it is essential that facilities ensure that emissions control 
equipment is installed, maintained and operated per manufacturer’s specifications. Proper operation requires all 
parameters to be within manufacturer’s specifications, including items such as vacuum pumps’ purges, fuel / 
oxidizer settings, supply and exhaust flows and pressures, and utilities to the emissions control equipment (fuel 
gas flow and pressure, calorific value, water quality, flow & pressure, extract flow and pressure, etc.). Please note 
that not exceeding the emissions control equipment suppliers’ maximum flow specifications requires that all gases, 
including post-process-chamber purges, are taken into account. Also note that some vacuum pumps’ purge flow 
indicators are inaccurate and could deliver higher-than-indicated purge flows, exceeding the emissions control 
equipment suppliers’ maximum flow specifications. Accurate flows can be determined using a calibrated portable 
mass flow meter (MFM) with a minimum accuracy of +/- 5 percent. It is suggested to perform calibration every 
time a vacuum pump is serviced or exchanged.

‘X’ indicates that the technology is potentially suitable to use the default DRE for the particular gas. 
“T” indicates that, to be considered as being suitable for treating a specific gas, the OEM would need to provide testing data to show that, 
when the new emissions control technology is tested on worst-case gas flow conditions, defaults (or site-specific) DREs can be achieved 
using an industry-accepted measurement methodology that accounts for dilution. 
Emissions Control Equipment technology definitions: 
Cartridge – Any form of dry-bed passive gas treatment, either heated or working at ambient-temperature. The active media is consumed 
by reaction with the target gas. 
Catalyst – This includes wet or dry beds, possible heating of the catalyst bed, and possible wet pre- or post-scrubbing. The media is not 
consumed by reaction with the target gas, it simply reduces the energy barrier of the reaction chemistry. 
Hot-wet – This includes emissions control equipment described as “thermal wet” and indicates electrical heating followed by wet 
scrubbing. May also include a pre-wet scrubber. 
Plasma – This involves the use of plasmas (e.g. RF, DC, or microwave) operated at atmospheric or sub-atmospheric pressures potentially 
combined with wet or dry scrubbing of by-products. May also include introduction of water, air, hydrogen and/or oxygen as chemical 
reagents. 
Combustion – This includes all configurations of fuel combustion and reaction zone design, water- or air-cooled, and dry or wet post-
scrubbing. 
New Technology – This is to account for the possibility of new emissions control technologies emerging that are not included in the 
categories above.

Note: 
1. The default emission factors for semiconductor manufacturing from heat transfer fluid applications are based on the arithmetic average 
of the emission factors for the United States, Europe and Taiwan, Province of China. The US emission factors are based on reporting 
from several manufacturers in 2016. The European emission factors are based on reporting from four facilities, averaged over three years. 
The Taiwan emission factors are based on reporting from manufacturers representing 95% market share, averaged over five years. For all 
regions, the number of fluorinated liquids emitted was ten or more; these fluorinated liquids were sorted into three groups of chemically 
similar fluorinated liquids represented by the fluorinated liquids in the table. HFE-449sl is used to represent hydrofluoroethers; C6F14 is 
used to represent fully fluorinated liquids manufactured by 3M™; and PFPMIE is used to represent fully fluorinated liquids 
manufactured by Solvay™. 
2. Default emission factors for semiconductor testing, packaging, and soldering are based on reporting by semiconductor manufacturers 
in Taiwan, Province of China, averaged over three and a half years. These manufacturers represent 80% of the market share in Taiwan, 
Province of China. 
3. The default emission factors for display are based on reporting by display manufacturers in Taiwan, Province of China, averaged over 
three years. These manufacturers represent 90% of market share in Taiwan, Province of China. The number of fluorinated liquids emitted 
was seven; these fluorinated liquids were sorted into three groups of chemically similar fluorinated liquids represented by the fluorinated 
liquids in the table. 
4. There is no heat transfer fluid Tier 1 default for PV and thus the only solution for estimating emissions of fluorinated liquids from 
these subsectors is the Tier 2 method.  
5. There is no Tier 1 default for substrate cleaning and, therefore, the Tier 2 method should be used to estimate emissions from this 
source.

6.2.3 
Choice of activity data 
Activity data for the electronics industry consists of data on gas consumption and/or production figures (surface 
area of substrate used during the production of electronic devices, e.g. silicon, glass). For the more data-intensive 
Tier 2 and Tier 3 methods, gas consumption data is necessary at the facility, substrate-size, process-type, or recipe 
levels, depending on the Tier. See the guidance regarding the calculation and apportioning of gas consumption 
under “Choice of Method.” For the Tier 1 methods, inventory compilers will need to determine the total surface 
area of electronic substrates used during the production of electronic devices for a given year. The best sources of 
either gas usage data or substrate area data are the owners and operators of the electronics manufacturing facilities 
in each country. However, if it is not possible to obtain the activity data from the owners and operators, Tier 1 
estimates may be developed using data on substrate area that is available from purchasable databases. Silicon 
consumption may be estimated using an appropriate edition of the World Fab Forecast (WFF) database, published 
quarterly by Semiconductor Equipment & Materials International (SEMI). The database contains a list of plants 
(production as well as R&D, pilot plants, etc.) worldwide, with information about location, design capacity, wafer 
size, product type (including MEMS), and more. Other databases are available e.g., IC Insights, Gartner and 
VLSI. 17 , 18 , 19 Similarly, SEMI’s ‘Flat Panel Display Fabs on Disk’ database provides an estimate of glass 
consumption for global TFT-Display manufacturing. IHS provide market data on the Solar/PV and display 
industries.20 
Table 6.7 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines provided design capacity figures, but these values, which were estimated 
for 2003 through 2005, are no longer accurate. Table 6.7 is not updated in this 2019 Refinement because the update 
would lose its accuracy very quickly given the rapid pace of growth and change in the electronics industry. 
Nevertheless, the following guidance remains applicable to design capacity data extracted from the purchasable 
databases above. Note that electronic devices manufacturing plants may not be operated at design capacities for 
sustained periods, such as a full year, as production typically fluctuates depending on product demand. For 
semiconductor manufacturing, publicly available industry statistics show that the global annual average capacity 
utilisation during the period 1991 – 2000 varied between 76 and 91 percent, with an average value of 82 percent 
and most probable value of 80 percent. When country-specific capacity utilisation data are not available, the 
suggested capacity utilisation for semiconductor manufacturing is 80 percent, which should be used consistently 
for a time series of estimates. For display manufacturing, 2016 fab capacity utilisation ranged between 76 and 91 
percent.21 For PV manufacturing, published capacity utilisation data ranges between 77 – 92 percent, with the 
average for the years 2003 and 2004 of 86 percent. Therefore, 86 percent is the recommended default figure to use 
for Cu (see Equation 6.1).  
When estimating emissions during PV manufacture, one should account for the fraction of the industry that actually 
employs FCs (FPV in Equation 6.1).  
6.2.4 
Completeness 
Completeness for electronics manufacturing requires accounting for all fluorinated GHGs, N2O (see section 6.1.1) 
and fluorinated liquids (see Table 6.522) emitted from all emissions sources (see Table 6.1) at all facilities in all 
electronics manufacturing subsectors (see Table 6.2) in a country. Complete accounting of emissions from the 
electronics industry should be achievable in most countries because there are a limited number of companies and 
plants. Inventory compilers can contact national or international industry associations (e.g., the appropriate 
national or regional Semiconductor Industry Association) and/or FC suppliers to obtain contact information for 
electronics manufacturers in their countries. Note that national statistical databases usually do not provide detailed 
information about electronic devices manufacturing plants, and information about the manufacturing capacities 
and utilization of such plants is often considered confidential (e.g. actual surface area of substrate used or quantity 
of final product produced). Nevertheless, commercially-available databases provide facility-specific information

22 Note that the list of fluorinated liquids in Table 6.5 is not exhaustive and that additional fluorinated liquids may be used. 
Thus, for completeness purposes, inventory compilers should check whether any fluorinated liquids other than those listed 
in Table 6.5 may be used at any particular facility 
 Chapter 6: Electronics Industry Emissions 
 
 
 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories                              6.63 
with production capacity estimates that can be used for the Tier 1 method (see section 6.2.3 “Choice of activity 
data”).  
FC Consumption: Generally, electronics devices manufacturers will have good records of consumption of FC 
gases, N2O, and fluorinated liquids. In compiling annual consumption of the relevant chemicals, completeness 
requires that the inventory of gases and fluorinated liquids account for the mass or volume of such chemicals stored 
in containers at the beginning and at the end of the year, acquisitions during the year through purchases and other 
transactions, but also transfers of chemicals and of equipment that may contain chemicals, including heels. Also, 
when apportioning gas consumption between process types, inventory compilers should ensure that the 
apportioning model does not omit or double count consumption for any particular process type. 
By-Product Generation: Completeness also requires tracking emissions of all FC by-products that result from 
reactions of input gases with each other, with carbon-containing films, and with hydrocarbon fuels. See the 
guidance on these by-product emissions in section 6.2.1.1.   
Fluorinated Liquids: A complete accounting of fluorinated liquids requires accounting for all uses of these liquids 
in all electronics subsectors in the country. As discussed in section 6.1.1, fluorinated liquids are used to control 
temperatures during manufacturing, to test devices, for soldering, and for cleaning of substrates and other parts. 
Because the Tier 1 default emission factors do not cover all of these uses in all subsectors, using the Tier 1 method 
for fluorinated liquids could affect the completeness of emissions estimates. Specifically, insufficient data was 
available to devise Tier 1 emission factors for the use of fluorinated liquids in cleaning substrates for all sub-
sectors, as well as for heat transfer applications in the PV sub-sector, and for testing, packaging and soldering in 
the display and PV sub-sectors. Thus, for such applications and sub-sectors, inventory compilers should check 
whether fluorinated liquids are used at any particular facility, and, to ensure completeness, use only the Tier 2 
method in such cases. 
Other products, research and development (R&D) and tool commissioning activities: Inventory compilers 
should be aware that new guidance was added to Volume 3, Chapter 8 of the 2019 Refinement to account for 
fluorochemicals emissions used to waterproof electronic circuits. As mentioned above, new products and processes 
may be introduced from time to time during the course of electronic devices manufacturing, and good practice for 
this industry is to incorporate a mechanism that accounts for reporting the introduction of new products and 
processes that may affect emissions estimates, and for periodically reporting newly measured emission factors to 
the IPCC emission factors database (EFDB). Note that it is good practice to include gas purchases in support of 
R&D and tool commissioning activities in the consumption figures used for a particular facility.  
6.2.5 
Developing a consistent time series 
Use of FCs and N2O by the semiconductor industry began in the late 1970s and accelerated significantly beginning 
in the early 1990s. Determining a base year emissions level may present difficulties because few data are available 
for emissions occurring before 1995. If historical emissions estimates were based on simple assumptions (e.g., use 
equals emissions), then these estimates could be improved by applying the methods described above. Emission 
factors for the electronics industry have also been revised since the publication of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines and 
the consistency of the time series could be improved by applying the revised emission factors to the full time 
series.  The 2019 Tier 2a, 2b or 2c emission factors can be applied to the historical emissions previously calculated 
with the 2006 Tier 2a or Tier 2b emission factors.  For the semiconductor sub-sector, if the wafer size manufactured 
is not known, 2019 Tier 2a emission factors should be applied to data from 2005 or later.  Due to the prevalence 
of 200 mm or smaller wafer sizes prior to 2005, the 2019 Tier 2b emission factors for 200 mm should be applied 
to data from 2004 or earlier instead of the Tier 2a emission factors. If historical data are not available to permit 
use of a Tier 3 or 2 methods, then the Tier 1 method using default emission parameters can be used retrospectively. 
In this case, it is good practice to use the Tier 1 factors from the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for years through 2010. 
For 2011 and the following years, it is good practice to use the Tier 1 factors from the 2019 Refinement for most 
sub-sectors; however, for the semiconductor sub-sector, in cases where it is known that the wafer size 
manufactured is 200 mm or smaller, it is good practice to continue to use the Tier 1 factors from the 2006 IPCC 
Guidelines. Both Tier 1 and Tier 2 could then be applied simultaneously for the years in which more data become 
available to provide a comparison for purposes of splicing the results of the Tier 1 and Tier 2 methods. This should 
be done according to the guidance provided in Volume 1, Chapter 5. 
In order to ensure a consistent emissions record over time, an inventory compiler should recalculate FC and N2O 
emissions for all years reported whenever emissions calculation procedures are changed (e.g., if an inventory 
compiler changes from the use of default values to actual values determined at the plant level). If plant-specific 
data are not available for all years in the time series, the inventory compiler will need to consider how current plant 
data can be used to recalculate emissions for these years. It may be possible to apply current facility-specific 
emission parameters to sales data from previous years, provided that facility operations have not changed

6.64                           2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
substantially. Such a recalculation is required to ensure that any changes in emission trends are real and not an 
artefact of changes in procedure. If substantial changes have occurred at a facility which prevent full recalculation 
or new variables are introduced in the equations such as emissions control equipment uptime or apportioning 
abated gas use to process type, the inventory compiler can apply both the previously used and the new method for 
at least one year and preferably more to provide a comparison. If the trends observed using this overlap splicing 
technique are not consistent then use of an alternate technique provided in Volume 1, Chapter 5 should be 
implemented. 
6.3 
UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT 
6.3.1 
Emission factor uncertainties 
As discussed in the Choice of Method section, the Tier 1 emission factors are expected to be highly uncertain 
because they do not account for the identities and quantities of the gases actually consumed, for the process types 
in which those gases are used, for wafer size (for semiconductors), or for the use of emission control systems. A 
quantitative estimate of the uncertainty of the Tier 1 emission factors (EFs) could not be developed based on the 
data available, but gas consumption is known to vary widely by device type (e.g., memory vs. logic for 
semiconductor manufacturing), and gas-specific EFs are known to vary widely by process type, by wafer size and 
by the fraction of emissions abated. Thus, the Tier 1 method is the least accurate estimation method and should be 
used only in cases where facility-specific data are not available. 
The relative uncertainties at the 95 percent confidence level, estimated for each emission factor of the Tier 2b and 
2c methods, are shown in Tables 6.19, and 6.20 for semiconductor manufacturing. It was not possible to estimate 
the uncertainty of the Tier 2a emission factors for the semiconductor sub-sector and of the Tier 2c emission factors 
for the display sub-sector due to lack of data. To estimate uncertainties, the relative standard deviations for each 
Tier 2c entry were first calculated across all experimental data points (measured utilization efficiencies and by-
product emission factors) for each particular gas i, process type, and wafer size. The relative standard deviations 
were then rounded to one significant figure and doubled to estimate uncertainties at the 95 percent confidence 
level. The same method was used for the Tier 2b entries for each gas and wafer size. The large uncertainties of 
Tier 2 emission factors are due to the wide distributions of individual experimental emission factors, which depend 
on process conditions and on the design of the process chambers. Because process conditions such as gas flows, 
pressure, temperature, or plasma power can vary widely for a particular gas and process chamber design, the 
utilization efficiencies or by-product emission factors can also significantly change from one process recipe to 
another, even within a particular process type. Although electronic devices manufacturers can typically run 
hundreds or even thousands of different recipes (with differing process conditions and manufacturing tool types) 
– providing an averaging effect over all recipe-specific emission factors –, actual emission factors (for any 
particular facility) may nevertheless differ from the Tier 2c, 2b, or 2a default emission factors. Because the Tier 
2a and Tier 2b methods provide lower resolution than the Tier 2c method (Tier 2a emission factors are only 
disaggregated by input gas i, and Tier 2b emission factors are only disaggregated by input gas and by wafer size), 
the overall uncertainty of the Tier 2a and 2b methods can be expected to be higher than for the Tier 2c method.  
The impact of the Tier 2 emission factors’ uncertainties on the overall emissions estimate for a particular electronic 
device manufacturing facility can be estimated by combining the probability distribution functions (PDFs) of the 
emission factors. Approaches to combine uncertainties include the propagation of error method and Monte Carlo 
simulations (see Volume 1, Chapter 3 of the 2019 Refinement). For electronic devices manufacturing, the Monte 
Carlo approach is suggested because the propagation of error method theoretically requires that the standard 
deviation divided by the mean value of a variable is less than 0.3, which is often not the case for Tier 2 emission 
factors (Id.).  
Using the Tier 3a method can help significantly reduce reporting uncertainties, even in the case of a hybrid method 
when a partial Tier 3a method is used in combination with the Tier 2c method. This is because the standard 
deviations of emission factors for a specific recipe or for a family of similar recipes (Tier 3a factors) can be much 
lower than those of default Tier 2c factors. Indeed, when running a particular recipe, process conditions such as 
gas flows, temperature, pressure, or plasma power are tightly controlled, and the wafer-to-wafer variability of 
emission factors is typically less than 5 percent in terms of relative standard deviations. When using Monte Carlo 
simulations to estimate the uncertainty of combined Tier 2c / Tier 3a emissions estimates for a particular facility, 
reporters should use a PDF describing the distribution functions of each Tier 2b or Tier 3a factor and combine 
such functions to determine the impact of the individual EF uncertainties on the uncertainty of the overall emissions 
estimate. Normal, lognormal, or other appropriate functions should be used to describe the PDFs of the variables. 
Then, suitable PDFs should be used to describe the variations of activity data (e.g. heel, input gas consumption, 
emissions control equipment efficiency – see Section 6.3.2) and such PDFs should be combined with those of the 
emission factors to estimate the uncertainty of the total emissions calculations.

6.3.2 
Activity data uncertainty 
Activity data uncertainty originates from multiple variables and particular attention should be taken to minimize 
the uncertainty and the potential bias of the measurements or of the models used to estimate activity data.  
For the Tier 1 method, the unit of activity is annual production, preferably measured as the surface area of substrate 
used during the production of electronic devices. Because annual production may be considered confidential by 
electronic devices manufacturers, it may be difficult to accurately estimate production at the facility level, and, 
consequently, at the country level. Further, if annual production is calculated as the product of annual plants’ 
manufacturing capacity and of utilization efficiencies provided by secondary sources (i.e. commercial databases), 
additional sources of uncertainties can be introduced. This is because manufacturing capacity figures available in 
commercial databases may be inaccurate, and because capacity utilization figures are often averaged for the global 
industry or may only be available for certain types of electronic products (e.g. memory, logic, discrete devices). 
Therefore, inventory compilers should keep in mind that annual production figures calculated from secondary 
sources may not accurately represent country-specific activities. Because of such limitations, the Tier 1 method 
should only be used in cases where facility-specific data are not available. 
For the Tier 2 and Tier 3 methods, gas consumption constitutes the principal unit of activity to estimate emissions 
and can therefore be a major potential source of uncertainty and errors. Gas consumption can be either measured 
or estimated from data on gas purchases, and requires knowledge of the heel, the unused gas returned to gas 
suppliers in the shipping containers. Using facility-specific heel measurements or accurate heel modelling as 
opposed to using the default heel value of 0.1 can help reduce uncertainty and error. Another major source of 
uncertainty and potential errors in activity data is related to gas consumption apportioning, where consumption 
may need to be apportioned by wafer size (Tier 2b), by specific process type (Tier 2c and, to a limited extent, Tiers 
2a and 2b), and/or by specific recipes or families of similar recipes (Tier 3a).  
To minimize apportioning uncertainty and increase accuracy, it is good practice to implement a gas consumption 
monitoring system using direct measurement to apportion gas use at the process type-, stack system- or facility-
level as appropriate. This can be achieved by various methods including monitoring and integrating the signal of 
MFCs and using weigh scales; however, it is noted that measurement to specific tools or processes may not be 
feasible.  
Finally, activity data related to the effective use of emissions control systems should be accurately assessed as part 
of any Tier 2 or Tier 3 method to minimize uncertainties and potential errors. In particular, accurately estimating 
the fraction of gases used or produced in processes with emissions control technologies (ai, ak), the average uptime 
of emissions control systems (UT), and the overall reduction of input gases and by-products (Di, Dk,i) is essential 
in producing reliable emissions estimates. With respect to the calculation of ai and ak,i in the Tier 2a or Tier 2b 
estimates, using default gamma values (γi,p and γk,i,p) to estimate the ratio of the uncontrolled emissions per tool of 
input gases ‘i’ or by-products ‘k’ from thin film deposition tools to the uncontrolled emissions per tool of input 
gases ‘i’ or by-products ‘k’ from etch and wafer cleaning or other tools, introduces a significant source of 
uncertainty and potential errors (see Table 6.22). Thus, to reduce uncertainty, avoiding the use of gamma default 
values by apportioning gas consumption by process type (i.e. using the Tier 2c method rather than the Tier 2a or 
Tier 2b methods) is encouraged. 
For fluorinated liquids, the uncertainty of the Tier 2 method will depend on the accuracy of the inventory method. 
Accurately tracking the number of fluorinated liquid containers at the beginning and at the end of the year, as well 
as the total nameplate capacity of equipment that uses fluorinated liquids and that is newly installed in or removed 
from the fab during the reporting year will ensure that uncertainties are minimized and that fluorinated liquid 
emissions estimates are reliable. 
As described in section 6.3.1, Monte Carlo simulations can be used to estimate the impact of uncertainties in 
activity data by measuring or modelling the probabilities of distributions functions (PDF) of uncertain activity 
data, and by combining the PDFs of activity-related variables and the PDFs of emission factors.

Source: Survey of industrial facility data conducted by the authors of Chapter 6.  
*The uncertainties for the Tier 2a gamma weighting factors are estimated using the higher of the uncertainties for the gamma factors for 200- and 
300-mm wafer manufacturing for that input gas and process type combination.  
† The gamma values for (IPC or ITC)/EWC for 200 mm, and their corresponding uncertainties, were developed based on IPC only, and the values 
(and corresponding uncertainties) for 300 mm were developed based on the total emissions and tool count from ITC and IPC. Gamma is assigned 
based on analogy due to similar emission factors for IPC and ITC, where known, for the same gas and wafer size. For cases where no gamma has 
been measured and a general default gamma factor of 10 is used (see footnote to Table 6.8), the inventory compiler may assume an uncertainty of 
500 percent.

QUALITY ASSURANCE / QUALITY CONTROL 
(QA/QC), REPORTING AND 
DOCUMENTATION 
6.4.1 
Quality Assurance / Quality Control (QA/QC) 
It is good practice to conduct quality control checks as outlined in Volume 1, Chapter 6 of the 2019 Refinement, 
and an expert review of the emissions estimates. Additional quality control checks as outlined in Volume 1 and 
quality assurance procedures may also be applicable, particularly if higher tier methods are used to determine 
emissions from this source category. Inventory compilers are encouraged to use higher tier QA/QC for key 
categories as identified in Volume 1, Chapter 4. 
Additional general guidance for higher tier QA/QC procedures is also included in Volume 1, Chapter 6 of the 2019 
Refinement. Due to the highly competitive nature of the electronics industry, provisions for handling confidential 
business information should be incorporated into the verification process. Methods used should be documented, 
and a periodic audit of the measurement and calculation of data should be considered. A QA audit of the processes 
and procedures should also be considered.  
It should be noted that comparing Tier 2 and Tier 3a (bottom-up) estimates with Tier 3b (top-down) estimates for 
representative facilities could help assess the accuracy (or inaccuracy) of the various methods. The Tier 2 and Tier 
3a methods are deemed ‘bottom-up’ approaches because they are based upon consumption at the input of the 
process tools, while the Tier 3b method is considered a ‘top-down’ approach as it is based on measuring stack-
specific (end of pipe) emission factors. Thus, comparing Tier 2 (or preferably Tier 3a) estimates with Tier 3b 
estimates would help assess whether biases may exist between top-down and bottom-up estimates.  
6.4.2 
Reporting and Documentation 
Care should be taken not to include emissions of HFCs used as ODS substitutes with those used in electronic 
devices manufacturing. It is good practice to document and archive all information required to produce facility-
level and national emissions inventory estimates as outlined in Volume 1, Section 6.11 of the 2019 Refinement. It 
is not practical to include all documentation in the national inventory report. However, the inventory should include 
summaries of methods used and references to source data such that the reported emissions estimates are transparent 
and that steps in their calculation may be retraced. 
Efforts to increase transparency should take into account the protection of confidential business information related 
to specific gas use. Country-level aggregation of gas-specific emissions data should protect this information in 
countries with three or more manufacturers. Table 6.23 (Information Necessary for Full Transparency of Estimates 
of Emissions from Electronics Manufacturing), shows the supporting information necessary for full transparency 
in reported emissions estimates. 
Good practice for Tier 3a and 3b is to document the development of company-specific emission factors, and to 
explain deviations from default values. Given confidentiality concerns, inventory compilers may wish to aggregate 
this information across manufacturers. In cases where manufacturers in a country have reported different emission 
or conversion factors for a given fluorinated compound or N2O and for specific recipes or families of similar 
recipes, inventory compilers may provide the range of factors reported and used.
