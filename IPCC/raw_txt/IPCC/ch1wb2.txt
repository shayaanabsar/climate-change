Operations of aircraft are divided into two parts:
• 
The Landing/Take-Off (LTO) cycle4 which includes all activities near the
airport that take place under the altitude of 914 metres (3000 feet).
This includes taxi-in and out, climbing and descending.
• 
Cruise is defined as all activities that take place at altitudes above
914 metres (3000 feet).  No upper limit is given.
D a t a  s o u r c e s
Locally available data should be used whenever possible.  The fuel
consumption and LTO information can be obtained from the national
airports.  Total number of aircraft per type and engines types can be
obtained from the airline companies.  Some emission factors are in the
Reference Manual tables.  At the Tier 2 level, emission factors are based on
the specific national aircraft fleet and typical airport TIM (ICAO Engine
Exhaust Emissions Databank, International Civil Aviation Organization).
Another possibility is US EPA (1985): Compilation of air pollutant emission
factors, Vol. II: Mobile sources, 4th edition, or US Office of Environment and
Energy (1991) FAA Aircraft Emission Database User’s Manual.
M e t h o d o l o g y
To use the Tier 2 method, the aircraft types used for both domestic and
international flights, as well as the number of LTO’s carried out by the
various aircraft types, must be known.  If this information on a per aircraft
type basis is not available, it is recommended that the Tier 1 method be
used.
The Tier 2 Approach breaks the calculation of emissions from aviation into
4 steps:
Step 1: Estimate the total fuel consumption for domestic and international
aviation
Step 2: Estimate the fuel consumption for LTO activities by aircraft type
Step 3: Estimate the fuel consumption for cruise activities by aircraft type
Step 4: Estimate the emissions for each gas

     4 Some statistics count either a landing or a take-off as one operation.
However it is both one take-off and one landing, that together
define one LTO-operation.

Methane Emissions from Coal
Mining and Handling
I n t r o d u c t i o n
The process of coal formation, commonly called coalification, inherently
generates methane and other by-products. The degree of coalification
(defined by the rank of the coal) determines the quantity of methane
generated and, once generated, the amount of methane stored in coal is
controlled by the pressure and temperature of the coal seam and by other,
less well-defined characteristics of the coal.  The methane will remain
stored in the coal until the pressure on the coal is reduced, which can occur
through the erosion of overlying strata or the process of coal mining. Once
the methane has been released, it flows through the coal toward a region of
lower pressure (such as a coal mine) and into the atmosphere.
The amount of CH4 generated during coal mining is primarily a function of
coal rank and depth, as well as other factors such as moisture.  If two coal
seams have the same rank, the deeper seam will hold larger amounts of
CH4 because the pressure is greater at lower depths, all other things being
equal.  As a result, most methane released to the atmosphere from coal
mining is assumed to come from underground rather than surface mining.
As a result, the methane emission factors for surface-mined coal are
assumed to be lower than for underground mining.
Methane is also emitted from post-mining activities such as coal processing,
transportation, and utilisation. Methane is released mainly because the
increased surface area allows more CH4 to desorb from the coal.
Transportation of the coal contributes to CH4 emissions, because CH4
desorbs directly from the coal to the atmosphere while in transit (e.g., in
railroad cars).  Coal may also release methane during its preparation for
final use.  For instance, in steel production coal is crushed to a particle size
of less than 5 mm, vastly increasing the surface area of the coal and allowing
more CH4 to desorb.
D a t a  S o u r c e s
The basic data necessary to perform these calculations are, at a minimum,
quantity of coal mined by type of mine (underground or surface).  Use
locally available data where these are reliable.
Country statistics on underground and surface coal production are available
from the OECD/IEA (for certain OECD Member countries). Data on coal
production by type (hard coal and lignite) are also available for most
countries in the world.

M e t h o d o l o g y
On the advice of an expert group (see the Section 1.7 in the Reference
Manual), calculations have been organised around a single formula which
relates tonnes of coal production to total CH4 emissions from mining and
post-mining activities.
The Workbook enables the user to operate at several different levels of
detail or "tiers" (discussed in more detail in the Reference Manual).
Tier 1 is the least accurate and is based upon global average emission
factors.
Tier 2 is possible when a country has enough information to develop
average emission factors of its own. More detailed calculations can be
accommodated by making extra copies of the worksheet and breaking the
calculations into sub-national components for which more specific emissions
factors may be available.
Tier 3 is based on mine-specific measurement of emissions from mine
ventilation and degasification. This method is recommended if data are
available as it should provide much more accurate country-based estimates.
The equation for calculating CH4 emissions from mining activities is:

Select an Emission Factor using Table 1-5 below. Do this for each type
of mining activity involved in your inventory. Select a point within the
possible range of values which is appropriate to your country. If you do
not have the information to select a point, use an average value. Enter
the value in Column B.
ALTERNATIVE LEVELS OF DETAIL -
TIERS
The information provided in this
Workbook, including global default
emission 
factors, 
allows 
for
calculation at the Tier 1 level. Tier 2
calculations 
follow 
the 
same
structure, but would use country or
basin-specific emission factors if
available locally. If a country is
capable of Tier 3 estimates this
would indicate that the emissions
estimates 
are 
already 
available
(having been directly measured) and
the Workbook 
methodology for
calculating emissions is not needed.
Countries with Tier 3 estimates can
move directly to the Reporting
Instructions 
volume 
of 
these
Guidelines for guidance on reporting
and 
documenting 
emissions
estimates.
The highest tier of estimation
methodology possible should be
used for each component of mining
activity. It is acceptable to provide
estimates using different tiers for
various components, provided that
the level of calculation is clearly
identified in each component. For
example, even if Tier 3 is used to
estimate 
underground 
emissions,
Tier 1 or 2 can be used to estimate
emissions from other components
of mining activity.

Methane Emissions from Oil and
Natural Gas Activities
I n t r o d u c t i o n
Fugitive emissions of methane from oil and gas activities probably account
for about 30 to 70 teragrams per year of global methane emissions.  The
category includes all emissions from the production, processing, transport
and use of oil and natural gas, and from non-productive combustion.  It
excludes use of oil and gas or derived fuel products to provide energy for
internal use, in energy production processing and transport. The latter are
considered fuel combustion and treated in an earlier section of this chapter.
Fugitive emissions do include, however, emissions which result from the
combustion of natural gas during flaring operations.  Sources of emissions
within oil and gas systems include:
• 
emissions during normal operation, such as emissions associated with
venting and flaring during oil and gas production, chronic leaks or
discharges from process vents;
• 
emissions during repair and maintenance, ; and
• 
emissions during system upsets and accidents.
To calculate methane emissions from oil and gas activities in your country, you
require the following energy data:
Oil
Gas
Number of wells drilled
Quantity of gas produced
Quantity of oil produced
Quantity of gas consumed
Quantity of oil refined
In addition, emission factors will be required as discussed below.
D a t a  s o u r c e s
Locally available data should be used wherever possible.  Energy data for a
large number of countries are also published by the International Energy
Agency and the United Nations Statistical Division.  See Reference Manual
Sections 1.8.2 and 1.8.3.
In addition to energy data, default emissions factors and other input
assumptions, are provided in the Workbook methodology where available.
In calculating national emissions, users of this method are free to override
any of these assumptions or recommendations if other information is
preferred.  Wherever information is used other than the values
recommended in the Workbook, this should be noted and documentation
should be provided on the sources of the information.
Users should ensure that data used in this section are consistent with those
entered in the CO2 from Energy calculations.  Countries which have significant
emissions from oil and natural gas should consult the discussion in the Reference

more country-specific factors.
M e t h o d o l o g y
Three different tiers or levels of detail for calculating these emissions are
presented in the Reference Manual.
•
Tier 1  Production-Based Average Emission Factors Approach
•
Tier 2  Mass Balance Approach
•
Tier 3  Rigorous Source-Specific Approach
Only Tier 1 is presented in this Workbook.
This requires assembling activity data (production etc.) for the country,
selecting emission factors based on information in the tables of typical
regional values (or from locally available data), and multiplying through to
produce emissions estimates by major subcategory. Explanations of the
regions used are provided below.
Regional Definitions
Regions have been defined recognising the limitations in data on emissions
factors and activity levels, and key differences in oil and gas activities
throughout the world. The following five regions have been chosen:
•
USA and Canada:
•
Former USSR and Eastern Europe:  This region includes the
former USSR (which is by far the largest oil and gas producer in the
region), Albania, Bulgaria, Czech & Slovak Republics, Hungary, Poland,
Romania, and the former Yugoslav republics.
•
Western Europe:  This region includes: Austria, Belgium, Denmark,
Faroe Islands, Finland, France, Germany, Gibraltar, Greece, Iceland,
Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain,
Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.
•
Other Oil Exporting Countries:  This region includes the world's
other major oil producing countries: the 11 OPEC members (Algeria,
Libya, Nigeria, Venezuela, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates) Gabon, Ecuador and Mexico.
•
Rest of the World: This region includes the remaining countries of
Asia, Africa, Middle East, Oceania and Latin America.

Ozone Precursors and SO 2  Emissions
from Oil Refining
I n t r o d u c t i o n
A basic refinery converts crude petroleum into a variety of sub-products.
Principal products of a refinery may include liquid fuels, coke, feedstocks
and primary petrochemicals (like ethylene).  This section covers basic
refineries, not the synthesis of petrochemicals.  Chemical production is
included in Chapter 2, Industrial Processes, whether or not the actual
production takes place at a refinery or in a separate plant.
D a t a  S o u r c e s
Data on crude oil throughput, required for the simplified Tier 1 approach, is
usually readily available from national sources or international compendia of
energy statistics.  The Tier 2 methods require data on internal refinery
operations which can be obtained only locally either through a national
industry association including refiners or by direct contact with the refiners.
These contacts also provide the opportunity to obtain local emission factors
for use in place of the default factors provided below.

Separate methods for the estimation of the four pollutants from catalytic
cracking, SO2 from desulphurisation and NMVOCs from oil storage are
presented below.
The discussion in Section 1.8.9 of the Reference Manual makes clear that the
default emission factors for SO2 and NOx are subject to wide ranges.
Efforts should be made to use local values for these pollutants and for
NMVOCs.

Using Worksheet 1-8, Sheet 2
1
Enter the oil throughput of the catalytic cracker units in Column A
expressed in 1000 tonnes.
2
In Column C, overwrite the default emission factors with local values if
available.
3
Multiply, in turn, the figure in Column A by each of the emission
factors entered in Column C and place the results in the
corresponding rows of Column D.
4
Divide the figures in Column D by 1000 to convert to gigagrams and
place the results in Column E.

Using Worksheet 1-8, Sheet 3
1
Enter the quantity of sulphur recovered in tonnes in Column A.
2
Multiply this figure by 139 (the default emission factor in kg/t) and
place the result in Column C.
3
Divide the figure in kg in Column C by 106 to convert to gigagrams
and put the result in Column D.

Using Worksheet 1-8, Sheet 4
1
For each refinery in the country, identify the major storage type.  Sum
the crude oil throughputs for each storage type and enter the result in
Column A expressed in 1000 tonnes.
2
Multiply the emission factor by the crude oil throughput in Column A
and place the result in the appropriate row in Column D.
3
Divide the figure in Column D by 1000 and put the result in gigagrams
in Column E.
