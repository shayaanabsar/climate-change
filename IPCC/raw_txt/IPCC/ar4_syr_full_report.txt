CLIMATE CHANGE 2007 – SYNTHESIS REPORT
T
he Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was set up jointly by the World Meteorological Organization and the
United Nations Environment Programme to provide an authoritative international statement of scientific understanding of
climate change. The IPCC’s periodic assessments of the causes, impacts and possible response strategies to climate change are
the most comprehensive and up-to-date reports available on the subject, and form the standard reference for all concerned with
climate change in academia, government and industry worldwide. This Synthesis Report is the fourth element of the IPCC Fourth
Assessment Report “Climate Change 2007”. Through three working groups, many hundreds of international experts assess
climate change in this Report. The three working group contributions are available from Cambridge University Press:

Climate Change 2007 – Synthesis Report is based on the assessment carried out by the three Working Groups of the IPCC. It
provides an integrated view of climate change and addresses the following topics:
• Observed changes in climate and their effects
• Causes of change
• Climate change and its impacts in the near and long term under different scenarios
• Adaptation and mitigation options and responses, and the interrelationship with sustainable development, at global and
regional levels
• The long-term perspective: scientific and socio-economic aspects relevant to adaptation and mitigation, consistent with the
objectives and provisions of the Convention, and in the context of sustainable development
• Robust findings, key uncertainties

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was
jointly established in 1988, by the World Meteorological Or-
ganization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment
Programme (UNEP), with the mandate to assess scientific in-
formation related to climate change, to evaluate the environ-
mental and socio-economic consequences of climate change,
and to formulate realistic response strategies. The IPCC
multivolume assessments have since then played a major role
in assisting governments to adopt and implement policies in
response to climate change, and in particular have responded
to the need for authoritative advice of the Conference of the
Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which was established in
1992, and its 1997 Kyoto Protocol.
Since its establishment, the IPCC has produced a series of
Assessment Reports (1990, 1995, 2001 and this one in 2007),
Special Reports, Technical Papers and Methodology Reports,
which have become standard works of reference, widely used
by policymakers, scientists, other experts and students. The
most recent publications include a Special Report on “Car-
bon Dioxide Capture and Storage” and one on “Safeguarding
the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System”, published
in 2005, and the “Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas
Inventories” re-edited in 2006. A Technical Paper on “Cli-
mate Change and Water” is under preparation.
This Synthesis Report (SYR), adopted in Valencia, Spain, on
17 November 2007, completes the four-volume Fourth As-
sessment Report (AR4), which was released in various steps
throughout the year under the title “Climate Change 2007”. It
summarises the findings of the three Working Group reports
and provides a synthesis that specifically addresses the issues
of concern to policymakers in the domain of climate change:
it confirms that climate change is occurring now, mostly as a
result of human activities; it illustrates the impacts of global
warming already under way and to be expected in future, and
describes the potential for adaptation of society to reduce its
vulnerability; finally it presents an analysis of costs, policies
and technologies intended to limit the extent of future changes
in the climate system.
The AR4 is a remarkable achievement involving more than
500 Lead Authors and 2000 Expert Reviewers, building on
the work of a wide scientific community and submitted to the
scrutiny of delegates from more than one hundred participat-
ing nations. It is the result of the enthusiasm, dedication, and
cooperation of experts from many different but related disci-
plines. We would like to express our gratitude to all of them,
to the Members of the IPCC Bureau, to the staff of the Tech-
nical Support Units, particularly of the Technical Support Unit
for the IPCC Synthesis Report in The Energy and Resources
Institute (TERI) in Delhi, to Dr Renate Christ, Secretary of
the IPCC, and to the Secretariat staff.
We acknowledge with gratitude the governments and
organisations that contribute to the IPCC Trust Fund and pro-
vide support to experts in different ways. The IPCC has been
especially successful in engaging in its work a large number
of experts from the developing countries and countries with
economies in transition; the Trust Fund enables extending fi-
nancial assistance for their travel to IPCC meetings. We also
acknowledge the cooperative spirit in which all government
delegates have worked together in the IPCC Sessions to reach
a meaningful and powerful consensus.
Finally, we would like to thank the Chairman of the IPCC,
Dr Rajendra K. Pachauri, for leading tirelessly and with dedi-
cation the effort of all. This is particularly appropriate at this
time as the IPCC as a whole, under his guidance, has been
awarded the 2007 Nobel Peace Price.
We would also like at this occasion to express deep recogni-
tion and sorrow in remembrance of Prof. Bert Bolin, who led
the way twenty years ago as first Chairman of IPCC, and who
sadly passed away on 30 December 2007 after a brilliant ca-
reer in meteorology and climate science.

This Synthesis Report with its Summary for Policymakers is
the fourth and final part of the Fourth Assessment Report
(AR4) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) – “Climate Change 2007”. It draws together and inte-
grates for the benefit of policy makers and those from others
professions, up to date policy-relevant scientific, technical and
socio-economic information on climate change. This report is
intended to assist governments and other decision-makers in
the public and private sector in formulating and implement-
ing appropriate responses to the threat of human-induced cli-
mate change.
The scope of the Synthesis Report includes the information
contained in the three Working Group contributions to the
IPCC AR4, the Working Group I report on “The Physical Sci-
ence Basis”, the Working Group II report on “Impacts, Adap-
tation and Vulnerability” and the Working Group III report on
“Mitigation of Climate Change”. It also draws on other IPCC
reports, in particular recently published IPCC Special Reports.
The Synthesis Report was written by a team dedicated to this
task drawn from the authors of each Working Group report of
the AR4 led by the Chair of the IPCC. As instructed by the
Panel, the authors prepared the draft in a non-technical style
while ensuring that scientific and technical facts are recorded
correctly.
The Synthesis Report addresses a range of broad policy-rel-
evant questions, structured around 6 topic headings agreed by
the Panel, and it gives careful attention to cross-cutting themes.
It consists of two parts, a Summary for Policymakers (SPM)
and a longer report. The sections of the SPM follow largely
the topic structure of the longer report, but for brevity and
clarity, certain issues covered in more than one topic are
summarised in one section of the SPM.
Topic 1 brings together information from Working Groups I
and II on observed changes in climate and the effects of past
climate change on natural systems and human society.
Topic 2 addresses causes of change, considering both natural
and anthropogenic drivers of climate change. It analyses the
chain including greenhouse gas emissions and concentrations,
to radiative forcing and resultant climate change, and evalu-
ates whether observed changes in climate and in physical and
biological systems can be attributed to natural or anthropo-
genic causes. In providing that information it draws on infor-
mation contained in all three Working Group contributions to
the AR4.
Topic 3 presents information from the three Working Group
reports on projected future climate change and its impacts. It
provides updated information on emissions scenarios and pro-
Preface
jected future changes in climate in the 21st century and be-
yond, and describes the projected impacts of future climate
change on systems, sectors and regions. Special attention is
given to issues of human well-being and development.
Topic 4 describes adaptation and mitigation options and re-
sponses as assessed in the reports of Working Groups II and
III, and the inter-relationship of climate change and response
measures with sustainable development. The focus of this topic
is on response measures that can be implemented by 2030.
Technologies, policies, measures and instruments as well as
barriers to implementation are addressed along with syner-
gies and trade-offs.
Topic 5 covers the long-term perspective and analyses scien-
tific, technical and socio-economic aspects relevant to adap-
tation and mitigation, consistent with the objectives and pro-
visions of the United Nations Framework Convention on Cli-
mate Change (UNFCCC). It places decision-making about
climate change in a risk management perspective, paying at-
tention to broader environmental and integration issues. The
topic describes emissions trajectories for stabilisation of green-
house gas concentrations at various levels and associated tem-
perature increases, along with information about the costs of
mitigation, required technology development and deployment,
and avoided climate impacts. It also explores in detail five
main reasons for concern regarding climate change, which it
finds have become stronger due to new knowledge since the
TAR.
Topic 6 highlights robust findings and key uncertainties.
While the Synthesis Report is a largely self-contained docu-
ment, it needs to be viewed in the context of the other vol-
umes of “Climate Change 2007” and it is recommended that
for further details the contributions of the three Working
Groups be consulted. Each of the Working Group reports con-
sists of a series of chapters which contain a detailed scientific
technical assessment, a Technical Summary, and a Summary
for Policymakers that has been approved by the IPCC line by
line.
The longer Synthesis Report contains extensive references to
the relevant chapters in the Working Group contributions to
the AR4 and other relevant IPCC reports. For easy reading,
references in the Summary for Policymakers only lead to the
relevant sections of the longer Synthesis Report. The CD RoM
included in this report contains the full text of the three Work-
ing Group contributions to the AR4 in English, as well as the
Summaries for Policymakers and Technical Summaries and
the Synthesis Report in all official UN languages. References
in these electronic versions are provided as hyperlinks to en-
v
able the reader to easily find further scientific, technical and
socio-economic information. A user guide, glossary of terms,
and lists of acronyms, authors, Review Editors and Expert
Reviewers are provided in the Annexes to this report.
The preparation of the Synthesis Report was carried out in
accordance with the Procedures for the Preparation, Review,
Acceptance, Adoption, Approval and Publication of IPCC
Reports, and it was adopted and approved by the IPCC at its
Twenty Seventh Session (Valencia, Spain, 12-17 November
2007).

Introduction
This Synthesis Report is based on the assessment carried
out by the three Working Groups of the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). It provides an integrated
view of climate change as the final part of the IPCC’s Fourth
Assessment Report (AR4).
A complete elaboration of the Topics covered in this sum-
mary can be found in this Synthesis Report and in the under-
lying reports of the three Working Groups.
1. Observed changes in climate and
their effects
Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as is
now evident from observations of increases in global
average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melt-
ing of snow and ice and rising global average sea level
(Figure SPM.1). {1.1}
Eleven of the last twelve years (1995-2006) rank among
the twelve warmest years in the instrumental record of global
surface temperature (since 1850). The 100-year linear trend
(1906-2005) of 0.74 [0.56 to 0.92]°C1  is larger than the cor-
responding trend of 0.6 [0.4 to 0.8]°C (1901-2000) given in
the Third Assessment Report (TAR) (Figure SPM.1). The tem-
perature increase is widespread over the globe and is greater
at higher northern latitudes. Land regions have warmed faster
than the oceans (Figures SPM.2, SPM.4). {1.1, 1.2}
Rising sea level is consistent with warming (Figure
SPM.1). Global average sea level has risen since 1961 at an
average rate of 1.8 [1.3 to 2.3] mm/yr and since 1993 at 3.1
[2.4 to 3.8] mm/yr, with contributions from thermal expan-
sion, melting glaciers and ice caps, and the polar ice sheets.
Whether the faster rate for 1993 to 2003 reflects decadal varia-
tion or an increase in the longer-term trend is unclear. {1.1}
Observed decreases in snow and ice extent are also con-
sistent with warming (Figure SPM.1). Satellite data since 1978
show that annual average Arctic sea ice extent has shrunk by
2.7 [2.1 to 3.3]% per decade, with larger decreases in summer
of 7.4 [5.0 to 9.8]% per decade. Mountain glaciers and snow
cover on average have declined in both hemispheres. {1.1}
From 1900 to 2005, precipitation increased significantly
in eastern parts of North and South America, northern Europe
and northern and central Asia but declined in the Sahel, the
Mediterranean, southern Africa and parts of southern Asia.
Globally, the area affected by drought has likely2  increased
since the 1970s. {1.1}
It is very likely that over the past 50 years: cold days, cold
nights and frosts have become less frequent over most land
areas, and hot days and hot nights have become more frequent.
It is likely that: heat waves have become more frequent over
most land areas, the frequency of heavy precipitation events
has increased over most areas, and since 1975 the incidence
of extreme high sea level3  has increased worldwide. {1.1}
There is observational evidence of an increase in intense
tropical cyclone activity in the North Atlantic since about 1970,
with limited evidence of increases elsewhere. There is no clear
trend in the annual numbers of tropical cyclones. It is difficult
to ascertain longer-term trends in cyclone activity, particularly
prior to 1970. {1.1}
Average Northern Hemisphere temperatures during the
second half of the 20th century were very likely higher than
during any other 50-year period in the last 500 years and likely
the highest in at least the past 1300 years. {1.1}
Observational evidence4 from all continents and most
oceans shows that many natural systems are being
affected by regional climate changes, particularly tem-
perature increases. {1.2}
Changes in snow, ice and frozen ground have with high con-
fidence increased the number and size of glacial lakes, increased
ground instability in mountain and other permafrost regions and
led to changes in some Arctic and Antarctic ecosystems. {1.2}
There is high confidence that some hydrological systems
have also been affected through increased runoff and earlier
spring peak discharge in many glacier- and snow-fed rivers
and through effects on thermal structure and water quality of
warming rivers and lakes. {1.2}
In terrestrial ecosystems, earlier timing of spring events
and poleward and upward shifts in plant and animal ranges
are with very high confidence linked to recent warming. In
some marine and freshwater systems, shifts in ranges and
changes in algal, plankton and fish abundance are with high
confidence associated with rising water temperatures, as well
as related changes in ice cover, salinity, oxygen levels and
circulation. {1.2}
Of the more than 29,000 observational data series, from
75 studies, that show significant change in many physical and
biological systems, more than 89% are consistent with the
direction of change expected as a response to warming (Fig-
1 Numbers in square brackets indicate a 90% uncertainty interval around a best estimate, i.e. there is an estimated 5% likelihood that the value
could be above the range given in square brackets and 5% likelihood that the value could be below that range. Uncertainty intervals are not
necessarily symmetric around the corresponding best estimate.
2 Words in italics represent calibrated expressions of uncertainty and confidence. Relevant terms are explained in the Box ‘Treatment of uncer-
tainty’ in the Introduction of this Synthesis Report.
3 Excluding tsunamis, which are not due to climate change. Extreme high sea level depends on average sea level and on regional weather
systems. It is defined here as the highest 1% of hourly values of observed sea level at a station for a given reference period.

balance in data and literature on observed changes, with
marked scarcity in developing countries. {1.2, 1.3}
There is medium confidence that other effects of re-
gional climate change on natural and human environ-
ments are emerging, although many are difficult to dis-
cern due to adaptation and non-climatic drivers. {1.2}
They include effects of temperature increases on: {1.2}
�
agricultural and forestry management at Northern Hemi-
sphere higher latitudes, such as earlier spring planting of
crops, and alterations in disturbance regimes of forests
due to fires and pests
�
some aspects of human health, such as heat-related mor-
tality in Europe, changes in infectious disease vectors in
some areas, and allergenic pollen in Northern Hemisphere
high and mid-latitudes
�
some human activities in the Arctic (e.g. hunting and travel
over snow and ice) and in lower-elevation alpine areas
(such as mountain sports).

Changes in physical and biological systems and surface temperature 1970-2004
Figure SPM.2. Locations of significant changes in data series of physical systems (snow, ice and frozen ground; hydrology; and coastal pro-
cesses) and biological systems (terrestrial, marine and freshwater biological systems), are shown together with surface air temperature changes
over the period 1970-2004. A subset of about 29,000 data series was selected from about 80,000 data series from 577 studies. These met the
following criteria: (1) ending in 1990 or later; (2) spanning a period of at least 20 years; and (3) showing a significant change in either direction,
as assessed in individual studies. These data series are from about 75 studies (of which about 70 are new since the TAR) and contain about
29,000 data series, of which about 28,000 are from European studies. White areas do not contain sufficient observational climate data to
estimate a temperature trend. The 2 × 2 boxes show the total number of data series with significant changes (top row) and the percentage of
those consistent with warming (bottom row) for (i) continental regions: North America (NAM), Latin America (LA), Europe (EUR), Africa (AFR),
Asia (AS), Australia and New Zealand (ANZ), and Polar Regions (PR) and (ii) global-scale: Terrestrial (TER), Marine and Freshwater (MFW), and
Global (GLO). The numbers of studies from the seven regional boxes (NAM, EUR, AFR, AS, ANZ, PR) do not add up to the global (GLO) totals
because numbers from regions except Polar do not include the numbers related to Marine and Freshwater (MFW) systems. Locations of large-
area marine changes are not shown on the map. {Figure 1.2}

Summary for Policymakers
2. Causes of change
Changes in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse
gases (GHGs) and aerosols, land cover and solar radiation al-
ter the energy balance of the climate system. {2.2}
Global GHG emissions due to human activities have
grown since pre-industrial times, with an increase of
70% between 1970 and 2004 (Figure SPM.3).5 {2.1}
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most important anthropogenic
GHG. Its annual emissions grew by about 80% between 1970
and 2004. The long-term trend of declining CO2 emissions
per unit of energy supplied reversed after 2000. {2.1}
Global atmospheric concentrations of CO2, methane
(CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) have increased markedly
as a result of human activities since 1750 and now far
exceed pre-industrial values determined from ice cores
spanning many thousands of years. {2.2}
Atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (379ppm) and CH4
(1774ppb) in 2005 exceed by far the natural range over the
last 650,000 years. Global increases in CO2 concentrations
are due primarily to fossil fuel use, with land-use change pro-
viding another significant but smaller contribution. It is very
likely that the observed increase in CH4 concentration is pre-
dominantly due to agriculture and fossil fuel use. CH4 growth
rates have declined since the early 1990s, consistent with to-
tal emissions (sum of anthropogenic and natural sources) be-
ing nearly constant during this period. The increase in N2O
concentration is primarily due to agriculture. {2.2}
There is very high confidence that the net effect of human
activities since 1750 has been one of warming.6 {2.2}
Most of the observed increase in global average tempera-
tures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the
observed increase in anthropogenic GHG concentra-
tions.7 It is likely that there has been significant anthro-
pogenic warming over the past 50 years averaged over
each continent (except Antarctica) (Figure SPM.4). {2.4}
During the past 50 years, the sum of solar and volcanic
forcings would likely have produced cooling. Observed pat-
terns of warming and their changes are simulated only by
models that include anthropogenic forcings. Difficulties re-
main in simulating and attributing observed temperature
changes at smaller than continental scales. {2.4}

GHGs are weighted by their 100-year Global Warming Potentials, using values consistent with reporting under the UNFCCC.
6 Increases in GHGs tend to warm the surface while the net effect of increases in aerosols tends to cool it. The net effect due to human activities
since the pre-industrial era is one of warming (+1.6 [+0.6 to +2.4] W/m2). In comparison, changes in solar irradiance are estimated to have
caused a small warming effect (+0.12 [+0.06 to +0.30] W/m2).

Advances since the TAR show that discernible human
influences extend beyond average temperature to other
aspects of climate. {2.4}
Human influences have: {2.4}
�
very likely contributed to sea level rise during the latter
half of the 20th century
�
likely contributed to changes in wind patterns, affecting
extra-tropical storm tracks and temperature patterns
�
likely increased temperatures of extreme hot nights, cold
nights and cold days
�
more likely than not increased risk of heat waves, area
affected by drought since the 1970s and frequency of heavy
precipitation events.
Anthropogenic warming over the last three decades has likely
had a discernible influence at the global scale on observed
changes in many physical and biological systems. {2.4}
Spatial agreement between regions of significant warm-
ing across the globe and locations of significant observed
changes in many systems consistent with warming is very
unlikely to be due solely to natural variability. Several model-
ling studies have linked some specific responses in physical
and biological systems to anthropogenic warming. {2.4}
More complete attribution of observed natural system re-
sponses to anthropogenic warming is currently prevented by
the short time scales of many impact studies, greater natural
climate variability at regional scales, contributions of non-
climate factors and limited spatial coverage of studies. {2.4}

Summary for Policymakers
8 For an explanation of SRES emissions scenarios, see Box ‘SRES scenarios’ in Topic 3 of this Synthesis Report. These scenarios do not include
additional climate policies above current ones; more recent studies differ with respect to UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol inclusion.
9 Emission pathways of mitigation scenarios are discussed in Section 5.
3. Projected climate change
and its impacts
There is high agreement and much evidence that with
current climate change mitigation policies and related sus-
tainable development practices, global GHG emissions
will continue to grow over the next few decades. {3.1}
The IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES,
2000) projects an increase of global GHG emissions by 25 to
90% (CO2-eq) between 2000 and 2030 (Figure SPM.5), with
fossil fuels maintaining their dominant position in the global en-
ergy mix to 2030 and beyond. More recent scenarios without
additional emissions mitigation are comparable in range.8,9 {3.1}
Continued GHG emissions at or above current rates
would cause further warming and induce many changes
in the global climate system during the 21st century that
would very likely be larger than those observed during
the 20th century (Table SPM.1, Figure SPM.5). {3.2.1}
For the next two decades a warming of about 0.2°C per de-
cade is projected for a range of SRES emissions scenarios. Even
if the concentrations of all GHGs and aerosols had been kept
constant at year 2000 levels, a further warming of about 0.1°C
per decade would be expected. Afterwards, temperature projec-
tions increasingly depend on specific emissions scenarios. {3.2}
The range of projections (Table SPM.1) is broadly con-
sistent with the TAR, but uncertainties and upper ranges for
temperature are larger mainly because the broader range of
available models suggests stronger climate-carbon cycle feed-
backs. Warming reduces terrestrial and ocean uptake of atmo-
spheric CO2, increasing the fraction of anthropogenic emis-
sions remaining in the atmosphere. The strength of this feed-
back effect varies markedly among models. {2.3, 3.2.1}
Because understanding of some important effects driving
sea level rise is too limited, this report does not assess the
likelihood, nor provide a best estimate or an upper bound for
sea level rise. Table SPM.1 shows model-based projections
Scenarios for GHG emissions from 2000 to 2100 (in the absence of additional climate policies)
and projections of surface temperatures

(coloured lines) and the 80th percentile range of recent scenarios published since SRES (post-SRES) (gray shaded area). Dashed lines show the
full range of post-SRES scenarios. The emissions include CO2, CH4, N2O and F-gases. Right Panel: Solid lines are multi-model global averages
of surface warming for scenarios A2, A1B and B1, shown as continuations of the 20th-century simulations. These projections also take into
account emissions of short-lived GHGs and aerosols. The pink line is not a scenario, but is for Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Model
(AOGCM) simulations where atmospheric concentrations are held constant at year 2000 values. The bars at the right of the figure indicate the
best estimate (solid line within each bar) and the likely range assessed for the six SRES marker scenarios at 2090-2099. All temperatures are

10 TAR projections were made for 2100, whereas the projections for this report are for 2090-2099. The TAR would have had similar ranges to
those in Table SPM.1 if it had treated uncertainties in the same way.

of global average sea level rise for 2090-2099.10  The projec-
tions do not include uncertainties in climate-carbon cycle feed-
backs nor the full effects of changes in ice sheet flow, there-
fore the upper values of the ranges are not to be considered
upper bounds for sea level rise. They include a contribution
from increased Greenland and Antarctic ice flow at the rates
observed for 1993-2003, but this could increase or decrease
in the future.11 {3.2.1}
There is now higher confidence than in the TAR in pro-
jected patterns of warming and other regional-scale
features, including changes in wind patterns, precipi-
tation and some aspects of extremes and sea ice. {3.2.2}
Regional-scale changes include: {3.2.2}
�
warming greatest over land and at most high northern lati-
tudes and least over Southern Ocean and parts of the North
Atlantic Ocean, continuing recent observed trends (Fig-
ure SPM.6)
�
contraction of snow cover area, increases in thaw depth
over most permafrost regions and decrease in sea ice ex-
tent; in some projections using SRES scenarios, Arctic
late-summer sea ice disappears almost entirely by the lat-
ter part of the 21st century
�
very likely increase in frequency of hot extremes, heat
waves and heavy precipitation
�
likely increase in tropical cyclone intensity; less confidence
in global decrease of tropical cyclone numbers
�
poleward shift of extra-tropical storm tracks with conse-
quent changes in wind, precipitation and temperature pat-
terns
�
very likely precipitation increases in high latitudes and
likely decreases in most subtropical land regions, continu-
ing observed recent trends.
There is high confidence that by mid-century, annual river
runoff and water availability are projected to increase at high
latitudes (and in some tropical wet areas) and decrease in some
dry regions in the mid-latitudes and tropics. There is also high
confidence that many semi-arid areas (e.g. Mediterranean
Basin, western United States, southern Africa and
north-eastern Brazil) will suffer a decrease in water resources
due to climate change. {3.3.1, Figure 3.5}
Studies since the TAR have enabled more systematic
understanding of the timing and magnitude of impacts
related to differing amounts and rates of climate
change. {3.3.1, 3.3.2}
Figure SPM.7 presents examples of this new information
for systems and sectors. The top panel shows impacts increas-
ing with increasing temperature change. Their estimated mag-
nitude and timing is also affected by development pathway
(lower panel). {3.3.1}

Systems and sectors: {3.3.3}

particular ecosystems:
- terrestrial: tundra, boreal forest and mountain regions
because of sensitivity to warming; mediterranean-type
ecosystems because of reduction in rainfall; and tropi-
cal rainforests where precipitation declines
- coastal: mangroves and salt marshes, due to multiple
stresses
- marine: coral reefs due to multiple stresses; the sea ice
biome because of sensitivity to warming
�
water resources in some dry regions at mid-latitudes13 and
in the dry tropics, due to changes in rainfall and evapo-
transpiration, and in areas dependent on snow and ice melt
�
agriculture in low latitudes, due to reduced water avail-
ability
�
low-lying coastal systems, due to threat of sea level rise
and increased risk from extreme weather events
�
human health in populations with low adaptive capacity.
Regions: {3.3.3}
�
the Arctic, because of the impacts of high rates of projected
warming on natural systems and human communities
�
Africa, because of low adaptive capacity and projected
climate change impacts
�
small islands, where there is high exposure of population
and infrastructure to projected climate change impacts
�
Asian and African megadeltas, due to large populations
and high exposure to sea level rise, storm surges and river
flooding.
Within other areas, even those with high incomes, some
people (such as the poor, young children and the elderly) can
be particularly at risk, and also some areas and some activi-
ties. {3.3.3}
Ocean acidification
The uptake of anthropogenic carbon since 1750 has led to
the ocean becoming more acidic with an average decrease in
pH of 0.1 units. Increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations
lead to further acidification. Projections based on SRES sce-
narios give a reduction in average global surface ocean pH of
between 0.14 and 0.35 units over the 21st century. While the ef-
fects of observed ocean acidification on the marine biosphere are
as yet undocumented, the progressive acidification of oceans is
expected to have negative impacts on marine shell-forming or-
ganisms (e.g. corals) and their dependent species. {3.3.4}

Summary for Policymakers
Table SPM.2. Examples of some projected regional impacts. {3.3.2}
Africa
� By 2020, between 75 and 250 million of people are projected to be exposed to increased water stress due to
climate change.
� By 2020, in some countries, yields from rain-fed agriculture could be reduced by up to 50%. Agricultural
production, including access to food, in many African countries is projected to be severely compromised. This
would further adversely affect food security and exacerbate malnutrition.
� Towards the end of the 21st century, projected sea level rise will affect low-lying coastal areas with large
populations. The cost of adaptation could amount to at least 5 to 10% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
� By 2080, an increase of 5 to 8% of arid and semi-arid land in Africa is projected under a range of climate
scenarios (TS).
Asia
� By the 2050s, freshwater availability in Central, South, East and South-East Asia, particularly in large river
basins, is projected to decrease.
� Coastal areas, especially heavily populated megadelta regions in South, East and South-East Asia, will be at
greatest risk due to increased flooding from the sea and, in some megadeltas, flooding from the rivers.
� Climate change is projected to compound the pressures on natural resources and the environment
associated with rapid urbanisation, industrialisation and economic development.
� Endemic morbidity and mortality due to diarrhoeal disease primarily associated with floods and droughts
are expected to rise in East, South and South-East Asia due to projected changes in the hydrological cycle.
Australia and
� By 2020, significant loss of biodiversity is projected to occur in some ecologically rich sites, including the
New Zealand
Great Barrier Reef and Queensland Wet Tropics.
� By 2030, water security problems are projected to intensify in southern and eastern Australia and, in
New Zealand, in Northland and some eastern regions.
� By 2030, production from agriculture and forestry is projected to decline over much of southern and
eastern Australia, and over parts of eastern New Zealand, due to increased drought and fire. However, in
New Zealand, initial benefits are projected in some other regions.
� By 2050, ongoing coastal development and population growth in some areas of Australia and New Zealand
are projected to exacerbate risks from sea level rise and increases in the severity and frequency of storms
and coastal flooding.
Europe
� Climate change is expected to magnify regional differences in Europe’s natural resources and assets.
Negative impacts will include increased risk of inland flash floods and more frequent coastal flooding and
increased erosion (due to storminess and sea level rise).
� Mountainous areas will face glacier retreat, reduced snow cover and winter tourism, and extensive species
losses (in some areas up to 60% under high emissions scenarios by 2080).
� In southern Europe, climate change is projected to worsen conditions (high temperatures and drought) in
a region already vulnerable to climate variability, and to reduce water availability, hydropower potential,
summer tourism and, in general, crop productivity.
� Climate change is also projected to increase the health risks due to heat waves and the frequency of wildfires.
Latin America
� By mid-century, increases in temperature and associated decreases in soil water are projected to lead to
gradual replacement of tropical forest by savanna in eastern Amazonia. Semi-arid vegetation will tend to
be replaced by arid-land vegetation.
� There is a risk of significant biodiversity loss through species extinction in many areas of tropical Latin America.
� Productivity of some important crops is projected to decrease and livestock productivity to decline, with
adverse consequences for food security. In temperate zones, soybean yields are projected to increase.
Overall, the number of people at risk of hunger is projected to increase (TS; medium confidence).
� Changes in precipitation patterns and the disappearance of glaciers are projected to significantly affect
water availability for human consumption, agriculture and energy generation.
North America
� Warming in western mountains is projected to cause decreased snowpack, more winter flooding and
reduced summer flows, exacerbating competition for over-allocated water resources.
� In the early decades of the century, moderate climate change is projected to increase aggregate yields of
rain-fed agriculture by 5 to 20%, but with important variability among regions. Major challenges are
projected for crops that are near the warm end of their suitable range or which depend on highly utilised
water resources.
� Cities that currently experience heat waves are expected to be further challenged by an increased
number, intensity and duration of heat waves during the course of the century, with potential for adverse
health impacts.
� Coastal communities and habitats will be increasingly stressed by climate change impacts interacting
with development and pollution.

Summary for Policymakers

Altered frequencies and intensities of extreme weather,
together with sea level rise, are expected to have mostly
adverse effects on natural and human systems. {3.3.5}
Examples for selected extremes and sectors are shown in
Table SPM.3.
Anthropogenic warming and sea level rise would con-
tinue for centuries due to the time scales associated
with climate processes and feedbacks, even if GHG
concentrations were to be stabilised. {3.2.3}
Estimated long-term (multi-century) warming correspond-
ing to the six AR4 Working Group III stabilisation categories
is shown in Figure SPM.8.
Contraction of the Greenland ice sheet is projected to con-
tinue to contribute to sea level rise after 2100. Current models
suggest virtually complete elimination of the Greenland ice
sheet and a resulting contribution to sea level rise of about 7m
if global average warming were sustained for millennia in
excess of 1.9 to 4.6°C relative to pre-industrial values. The
corresponding future temperatures in Greenland are compa-
rable to those inferred for the last interglacial period 125,000
years ago, when palaeoclimatic information suggests reductions
of polar land ice extent and 4 to 6m of sea level rise. {3.2.3}
Current global model studies project that the Antarctic ice
sheet will remain too cold for widespread surface melting and
gain mass due to increased snowfall. However, net loss of ice
mass could occur if dynamical ice discharge dominates the
ice sheet mass balance. {3.2.3}
Table SPM.2. continued...
Polar Regions
� The main projected biophysical effects are reductions in thickness and extent of glaciers, ice sheets
and sea ice, and changes in natural ecosystems with detrimental effects on many organisms including
migratory birds, mammals and higher predators.
� For human communities in the Arctic, impacts, particularly those resulting from changing snow and ice
conditions, are projected to be mixed.
� Detrimental impacts would include those on infrastructure and traditional indigenous ways of life.
� In both polar regions, specific ecosystems and habitats are projected to be vulnerable, as climatic barriers to
species invasions are lowered.
 Small Islands
� Sea level rise is expected to exacerbate inundation, storm surge, erosion and other coastal hazards, thus
threatening vital infrastructure, settlements and facilities that support the livelihood of island communities.
� Deterioration in coastal conditions, for example through erosion of beaches and coral bleaching, is expected
to affect local resources.
� By mid-century, climate change is expected to reduce water resources in many small islands, e.g. in
the Caribbean and Pacific, to the point where they become insufficient to meet demand during low-rainfall
periods.
� With higher temperatures, increased invasion by non-native species is expected to occur, particularly on
mid- and high-latitude islands.
Note:
Unless stated explicitly, all entries are from Working Group II SPM text, and are either very high confidence or high confidence state-
ments, reflecting different sectors (agriculture, ecosystems, water, coasts, health, industry and settlements). The Working Group II SPM
refers to the source of the statements, timelines and temperatures. The magnitude and timing of impacts that will ultimately be realised
will vary with the amount and rate of climate change, emissions scenarios, development pathways and adaptation.
Figure SPM.8. Estimated long-term (multi-century) warming corresponding to the six AR4 Working Group III stabilisation categories (Table
SPM.6). The temperature scale has been shifted by -0.5°C compared to Table SPM.6 to account approximately for the warming between pre-
industrial and 1980-1999. For most stabilisation levels global average temperature is approaching the equilibrium level over a few centuries. For
GHG emissions scenarios that lead to stabilisation at levels comparable to SRES B1 and A1B by 2100 (600 and 850ppm CO2-eq; category IV
and V), assessed models project that about 65 to 70% of the estimated global equilibrium temperature increase, assuming a climate sensitivity
of 3°C, would be realised at the time of stabilisation. For the much lower stabilisation scenarios (category I and II, Figure SPM.11), the equilib-
rium temperature may be reached earlier. {Figure 3.4}

Summary for Policymakers
Table SPM.3. Examples of possible impacts of climate change due to changes in extreme weather and climate events, based on
projections to the mid- to late 21st century. These do not take into account any changes or developments in adaptive capacity. The
likelihood estimates in column two relate to the phenomena listed in column one. {Table 3.2}
Anthropogenic warming could lead to some impacts
that are abrupt or irreversible, depending upon the rate
and magnitude of the climate change. {3.4}
Partial loss of ice sheets on polar land could imply metres
of sea level rise, major changes in coastlines and inundation
of low-lying areas, with greatest effects in river deltas and
low-lying islands. Such changes are projected to occur over
millennial time scales, but more rapid sea level rise on cen-
tury time scales cannot be excluded. {3.4}
Climate change is likely to lead to some irreversible im-
pacts. There is medium confidence that approximately 20 to
30% of species assessed so far are likely to be at increased
risk of extinction if increases in global average warming ex-
ceed 1.5 to 2.5°C (relative to 1980-1999). As global average

Summary for Policymakers

temperature increase exceeds about 3.5°C, model projections
suggest significant extinctions (40 to 70% of species assessed)
around the globe. {3.4}
Based on current model simulations, the meridional over-
turning circulation (MOC) of the Atlantic Ocean will very likely
slow down during the 21st century; nevertheless temperatures
over the Atlantic and Europe are projected to increase. The
MOC is very unlikely to undergo a large abrupt transition dur-
ing the 21st century. Longer-term MOC changes cannot be as-
sessed with confidence. Impacts of large-scale and persistent
changes in the MOC are likely to include changes in marine
ecosystem productivity, fisheries, ocean CO2 uptake, oceanic
oxygen concentrations and terrestrial vegetation. Changes in
terrestrial and ocean CO2 uptake may feed back on the cli-
mate system. {3.4}
4. Adaptation and mitigation options14
A wide array of adaptation options is available, but more
extensive adaptation than is currently occurring is re-
quired to reduce vulnerability to climate change. There
are barriers, limits and costs, which are not fully un-
derstood. {4.2}
Societies have a long record of managing the impacts of
weather- and climate-related events. Nevertheless, additional
adaptation measures will be required to reduce the adverse
impacts of projected climate change and variability, regard-
less of the scale of mitigation undertaken over the next two to
three decades. Moreover, vulnerability to climate change can
be exacerbated by other stresses. These arise from, for ex-
ample, current climate hazards, poverty and unequal access to
resources, food insecurity, trends in economic globalisation,
conflict and incidence of diseases such as HIV/AIDS. {4.2}
Some planned adaptation to climate change is already
occurring on a limited basis. Adaptation can reduce vulner-
ability, especially when it is embedded within broader sectoral
initiatives (Table SPM.4). There is high confidence that there
are viable adaptation options that can be implemented in some
sectors at low cost, and/or with high benefit-cost ratios. How-
ever, comprehensive estimates of global costs and benefits of
adaptation are limited. {4.2, Table 4.1}
Adaptive capacity is intimately connected to social and
economic development but is unevenly distributed
across and within societies. {4.2}
A range of barriers limits both the implementation and
effectiveness of adaptation measures. The capacity to adapt is
dynamic and is influenced by a society’s productive base, in-
cluding natural and man-made capital assets, social networks
and entitlements, human capital and institutions, governance,
national income, health and technology. Even societies with
high adaptive capacity remain vulnerable to climate change,
variability and extremes. {4.2}
Both bottom-up and top-down studies indicate that
there is high agreement and much evidence of sub-
stantial economic potential for the mitigation of global
GHG emissions over the coming decades that could
offset the projected growth of global emissions or re-
duce emissions below current levels (Figures SPM.9,
SPM.10).15  While top-down and bottom-up studies are
in line at the global level (Figure SPM.9) there are con-
siderable differences at the sectoral level. {4.3}
No single technology can provide all of the mitigation
potential in any sector. The economic mitigation potential,
which is generally greater than the market mitigation poten-
tial, can only be achieved when adequate policies are in place
and barriers removed (Table SPM.5). {4.3}
Bottom-up studies suggest that mitigation opportunities
with net negative costs have the potential to reduce emissions
by around 6 GtCO2-eq/yr in 2030, realising which requires
dealing with implementation barriers. {4.3}
14 While this Section deals with adaptation and mitigation separately, these responses can be complementary. This theme is discussed in
Section 5.
15 The concept of ‘mitigation potential’ has been developed to assess the scale of GHG reductions that could be made, relative to emission
baselines, for a given level of carbon price (expressed in cost per unit of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions avoided or reduced). Mitigation
potential is further differentiated in terms of ‘market mitigation potential’ and ‘economic mitigation potential’.
Market mitigation potential is the mitigation potential based on private costs and private discount rates (reflecting the perspective of private
consumers and companies), which might be expected to occur under forecast market conditions, including policies and measures currently in
place, noting that barriers limit actual uptake.
Economic mitigation potential is the mitigation potential that takes into account social costs and benefits and social discount rates (reflect-
ing the perspective of society; social discount rates are lower than those used by private investors), assuming that market efficiency is
improved by policies and measures and barriers are removed.
Mitigation potential is estimated using different types of approaches. Bottom-up studies are based on assessment of mitigation options,
emphasising specific technologies and regulations. They are typically sectoral studies taking the macro-economy as unchanged. Top-down
studies assess the economy-wide potential of mitigation options. They use globally consistent frameworks and aggregated information about
mitigation options and capture macro-economic and market feedbacks.

Future energy infrastructure investment decisions, ex-
pected to exceed US$20 trillion16  between 2005 and 2030,
will have long-term impacts on GHG emissions, because of
the long lifetimes of energy plants and other infrastructure
capital stock. The widespread diffusion of low-carbon tech-
nologies may take many decades, even if early investments in
these technologies are made attractive. Initial estimates show
that returning global energy-related CO2 emissions to 2005
levels by 2030 would require a large shift in investment pat-
terns, although the net additional investment required ranges
from negligible to 5 to 10%. {4.3}

Figure SPM.10. Estimated economic mitigation potential by sector in 2030 from bottom-up studies, compared to the respective baselines
assumed in the sector assessments. The potentials do not include non-technical options such as lifestyle changes. {Figure 4.2}
Notes:
a) The ranges for global economic potentials as assessed in each sector are shown by vertical lines. The ranges are based on end-use allocations of
emissions, meaning that emissions of electricity use are counted towards the end-use sectors and not to the energy supply sector.
b) The estimated potentials have been constrained by the availability of studies particularly at high carbon price levels.
c) Sectors used different baselines. For industry, the SRES B2 baseline was taken, for energy supply and transport, the World Energy Outlook
(WEO) 2004 baseline was used; the building sector is based on a baseline in between SRES B2 and A1B; for waste, SRES A1B driving
forces were used to construct a waste-specific baseline; agriculture and forestry used baselines that mostly used B2 driving forces.
d) Only global totals for transport are shown because international aviation is included.
e) Categories excluded are: non-CO2 emissions in buildings and transport, part of material efficiency options, heat production and co-genera-
tion in energy supply, heavy duty vehicles, shipping and high-occupancy passenger transport, most high-cost options for buildings, wastewa-
ter treatment, emission reduction from coal mines and gas pipelines, and fluorinated gases from energy supply and transport. The underes-
timation of the total economic potential from these emissions is of the order of 10 to 15%.

Summary for Policymakers
18
A wide variety of policies and instruments are avail-
able to governments to create the incentives for miti-
gation action. Their applicability depends on national
circumstances and sectoral context (Table SPM.5). {4.3}
They include integrating climate policies in wider devel-
opment policies, regulations and standards, taxes and charges,
tradable permits, financial incentives, voluntary agreements,
information instruments, and research, development and dem-
onstration (RD&D). {4.3}
An effective carbon-price signal could realise significant
mitigation potential in all sectors. Modelling studies show that
global carbon prices rising to US$20-80/tCO2-eq by 2030 are
consistent with stabilisation at around 550ppm CO2-eq by 2100.
For the same stabilisation level, induced technological change
may lower these price ranges to US$5-65/tCO2-eq in 2030.17 {4.3}
There is high agreement and much evidence that mitiga-
tion actions can result in near-term co-benefits (e.g. improved
health due to reduced air pollution) that may offset a substan-
tial fraction of mitigation costs. {4.3}
There is high agreement and medium evidence that Annex
I countries’ actions may affect the global economy and global
emissions, although the scale of carbon leakage remains un-
certain.18  {4.3}
Fossil fuel exporting nations (in both Annex I and non-An-
nex I countries) may expect, as indicated in the TAR, lower de-
mand and prices and lower GDP growth due to mitigation poli-
cies. The extent of this spillover depends strongly on assump-
tions related to policy decisions and oil market conditions. {4.3}
There is also high agreement and medium evidence that
changes in lifestyle, behaviour patterns and management prac-
tices can contribute to climate change mitigation across all sec-
tors. {4.3}
Many options for reducing global GHG emissions
through international cooperation exist. There is high
agreement and much evidence that notable achieve-
ments of the UNFCCC and its Kyoto Protocol are the
establishment of a global response to climate change,
stimulation of an array of national policies, and the cre-
ation of an international carbon market and new insti-
tutional mechanisms that may provide the foundation
for future mitigation efforts. Progress has also been made
in addressing adaptation within the UNFCCC and addi-
tional international initiatives have been suggested. {4.5}
Greater cooperative efforts and expansion of market mecha-
nisms will help to reduce global costs for achieving a given level
of mitigation, or will improve environmental effectiveness. Ef-
forts can include diverse elements such as emissions targets;
sectoral, local, sub-national and regional actions; RD&D
programmes; adopting common policies; implementing devel-
opment-oriented actions; or expanding financing instruments. {4.5}
In several sectors, climate response options can be
implemented to realise synergies and avoid conflicts
with other dimensions of sustainable development.
Decisions about macroeconomic and other non-climate
policies can significantly affect emissions, adaptive
capacity and vulnerability. {4.4, 5.8}
Making development more sustainable can enhance miti-
gative and adaptive capacities, reduce emissions and reduce
vulnerability, but there may be barriers to implementation. On
the other hand, it is very likely that climate change can slow
the pace of progress towards sustainable development. Over
the next half-century, climate change could impede achieve-
ment of the Millennium Development Goals. {5.8}
5. The long-term perspective
Determining what constitutes “dangerous anthropo-
genic interference with the climate system” in relation
to Article 2 of the UNFCCC involves value judgements.
Science can support informed decisions on this issue,
including by providing criteria for judging which vul-
nerabilities might be labelled ‘key’. {Box ‘Key Vulnerabili-
ties and Article 2 of the UNFCCC’, Topic 5}
Key vulnerabilities19  may be associated with many cli-
mate-sensitive systems, including food supply, infrastructure,
health, water resources, coastal systems, ecosystems, global
biogeochemical cycles, ice sheets and modes of oceanic and
atmospheric circulation. {Box ‘Key Vulnerabilities and Article 2 of
the UNFCCC’, Topic 5}
17 Studies on mitigation portfolios and macro-economic costs assessed in this report are based on top-down modelling. Most models use a
global least-cost approach to mitigation portfolios, with universal emissions trading, assuming transparent markets, no transaction cost, and
thus perfect implementation of mitigation measures throughout the 21st century. Costs are given for a specific point in time. Global modelled
costs will increase if some regions, sectors (e.g. land use), options or gases are excluded. Global modelled costs will decrease with lower
baselines, use of revenues from carbon taxes and auctioned permits, and if induced technological learning is included. These models do not consider
climate benefits and generally also co-benefits of mitigation measures, or equity issues. Significant progress has been achieved in applying ap-
proaches based on induced technological change to stabilisation studies; however, conceptual issues remain. In the models that consider induced
technological change, projected costs for a given stabilisation level are reduced; the reductions are greater at lower stabilisation level.
18 Further details may be found in Topic 4 of this Synthesis Report.
19 Key vulnerabilities can be identified based on a number of criteria in the literature, including magnitude, timing, persistence/reversibility, the
potential for adaptation, distributional aspects, likelihood and ‘importance’ of the impacts.
19
Summary for Policymakers
The five ‘reasons for concern’ identified in the TAR re-
main a viable framework to consider key vulnerabili-
ties. These ‘reasons’ are assessed here to be stronger
than in the TAR. Many risks are identified with higher con-
fidence. Some risks are projected to be larger or to occur
at lower increases in temperature. Understanding about
the relationship between impacts (the basis for ‘reasons
for concern’ in the TAR) and vulnerability (that includes
the ability to adapt to impacts) has improved. {5.2}
This is due to more precise identification of the circum-
stances that make systems, sectors and regions especially vul-
nerable and growing evidence of the risks of very large im-
pacts on multiple-century time scales. {5.2}
�
Risks to unique and threatened systems.  There is new
and stronger evidence of observed impacts of climate
change on unique and vulnerable systems (such as polar
and high mountain communities and ecosystems), with
increasing levels of adverse impacts as temperatures in-
crease further. An increasing risk of species extinction and
coral reef damage is projected with higher confidence than
in the TAR as warming proceeds. There is medium confi-
dence that approximately 20 to 30% of plant and animal
species assessed so far are likely to be at increased risk of
extinction if increases in global average temperature ex-
ceed 1.5 to 2.5°C over 1980-1999 levels. Confidence has
increased that a 1 to 2°C increase in global mean tem-
perature above 1990 levels (about 1.5 to 2.5°C above pre-
industrial) poses significant risks to many unique and
threatened systems including many biodiversity hotspots.
Corals are vulnerable to thermal stress and have low adap-
tive capacity. Increases in sea surface temperature of about
1 to 3°C are projected to result in more frequent coral
bleaching events and widespread mortality, unless there
is thermal adaptation or acclimatisation by corals. Increasing
vulnerability of indigenous communities in the Arctic and
small island communities to warming is projected. {5.2}
�
Risks of extreme weather events.  Responses to some re-
cent extreme events reveal higher levels of vulnerability
than the TAR. There is now higher confidence in the pro-
jected increases in droughts, heat waves and floods, as
well as their adverse impacts. {5.2}
�
Distribution of impacts and vulnerabilities.  There are
sharp differences across regions and those in the weakest
economic position are often the most vulnerable to cli-
mate change. There is increasing evidence of greater vul-
nerability of specific groups such as the poor and elderly
not only in developing but also in developed countries.
Moreover, there is increased evidence that low-latitude
and less developed areas generally face greater risk, for
example in dry areas and megadeltas. {5.2}
�
Aggregate impacts.  Compared to the TAR, initial net mar-
ket-based benefits from climate change are projected to
peak at a lower magnitude of warming, while damages
would be higher for larger magnitudes of warming. The
net costs of impacts of increased warming are projected
to increase over time. {5.2}
�
Risks of large-scale singularities. There is high confi-
dence that global warming over many centuries would lead
to a sea level rise contribution from thermal expansion
alone that is projected to be much larger than observed
over the 20th century, with loss of coastal area and associ-
ated impacts. There is better understanding than in the TAR
that the risk of additional contributions to sea level rise
from both the Greenland and possibly Antarctic ice sheets
may be larger than projected by ice sheet models and could
occur on century time scales. This is because ice dynami-
cal processes seen in recent observations but not fully in-
cluded in ice sheet models assessed in the AR4 could in-
crease the rate of ice loss. {5.2}
There is high confidence that neither adaptation nor
mitigation alone can avoid all climate change impacts;
however, they can complement each other and together
can significantly reduce the risks of climate change. {5.3}
Adaptation is necessary in the short and longer term to ad-
dress impacts resulting from the warming that would occur even
for the lowest stabilisation scenarios assessed. There are barriers,
limits and costs, but these are not fully understood. Unmitigated
climate change would, in the long term, be likely to exceed the
capacity of natural, managed and human systems to adapt. The
time at which such limits could be reached will vary between
sectors and regions. Early mitigation actions would avoid further
locking in carbon intensive infrastructure and reduce climate
change and associated adaptation needs. {5.2, 5.3}
Many impacts can be reduced, delayed or avoided by
mitigation. Mitigation efforts and investments over the
next two to three decades will have a large impact on
opportunities to achieve lower stabilisation levels. De-
layed emission reductions significantly constrain the
opportunities to achieve lower stabilisation levels and
increase the risk of more severe climate change im-
pacts. {5.3, 5.4, 5.7}
In order to stabilise the concentration of GHGs in the at-
mosphere, emissions would need to peak and decline thereaf-
ter. The lower the stabilisation level, the more quickly this
peak and decline would need to occur.20 {5.4}
Table SPM.6 and Figure SPM.11 summarise the required

Notes:
a) The emission reductions to meet a particular stabilisation level reported in the mitigation studies assessed here might be underesti-
mated due to missing carbon cycle feedbacks (see also Topic 2.3).
b) Atmospheric CO2 concentrations were 379ppm in 2005. The best estimate of total CO2-eq concentration in 2005 for all long-lived
GHGs is about 455ppm, while the corresponding value including the net effect of all anthropogenic forcing agents is 375ppm CO2-eq.
c) Ranges correspond to the 15th to 85th percentile of the post-TAR scenario distribution. CO2 emissions are shown so multi-gas scenarios
can be compared with CO2-only scenarios (see Figure SPM.3).
d) The best estimate of climate sensitivity is 3°C.
e) Note that global average temperature at equilibrium is different from expected global average temperature at the time of stabilisation of
GHG concentrations due to the inertia of the climate system. For the majority of scenarios assessed, stabilisation of GHG concentra-
tions occurs between 2100 and 2150 (see also Footnote 21).
f)
Equilibrium sea level rise is for the contribution from ocean thermal expansion only and does not reach equilibrium for at least many
centuries. These values have been estimated using relatively simple climate models (one low-resolution AOGCM and several EMICs
based on the best estimate of 3°C climate sensitivity) and do not include contributions from melting ice sheets, glaciers and ice caps.
Long-term thermal expansion is projected to result in 0.2 to 0.6m per degree Celsius of global average warming above pre-industrial.
(AOGCM refers to Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Model and EMICs to Earth System Models of Intermediate Complexity.)
21 Estimates for the evolution of temperature over the course of this century are not available in the AR4 for the stabilisation scenarios. For most
stabilisation levels, global average temperature is approaching the equilibrium level over a few centuries. For the much lower stabilisation
scenarios (category I and II, Figure SPM.11), the equilibrium temperature may be reached earlier.
term sea level rise due to thermal expansion only.21  The tim-
ing and level of mitigation to reach a given temperature
stabilisation level is earlier and more stringent if climate sen-
sitivity is high than if it is low. {5.4, 5.7}
Sea level rise under warming is inevitable. Thermal ex-
pansion would continue for many centuries after GHG con-
centrations have stabilised, for any of the stabilisation levels
assessed, causing an eventual sea level rise much larger than
projected for the 21st century. The eventual contributions from
Greenland ice sheet loss could be several metres, and larger
than from thermal expansion, should warming in excess of
1.9 to 4.6°C above pre-industrial be sustained over many cen-
turies. The long time scales of thermal expansion and ice sheet
response to warming imply that stabilisation of GHG concen-
trations at or above present levels would not stabilise sea level
for many centuries. {5.3, 5.4}
There is high agreement and much evidence that
all stabilisation levels assessed can be achieved by
deployment of a portfolio of technologies that are ei-
ther currently available or expected to be commercialised
in coming decades, assuming appropriate and effec-
tive incentives are in place for their development,
acquisition, deployment and diffusion and addressing
related barriers. {5.5}
All assessed stabilisation scenarios indicate that 60 to 80%
of the reductions would come from energy supply and use
and industrial processes, with energy efficiency playing a key
role in many scenarios. Including non-CO2 and CO2 land-use
and forestry mitigation options provides greater flexibility and
cost-effectiveness. Low stabilisation levels require early invest-
ments and substantially more rapid diffusion and
commercialisation of advanced low-emissions technologies. {5.5}
Without substantial investment flows and effective tech-
nology transfer, it may be difficult to achieve emission reduc-
tion at a significant scale. Mobilising financing of incremen-
tal costs of low-carbon technologies is important. {5.5}

hand panel); and the corresponding relationship between the stabilisation target and the likely equilibrium global average temperature increase

Coloured shadings show stabilisation scenarios grouped according to different targets (stabilisation category I to VI). The right-hand panel
shows ranges of global average temperature change above pre-industrial, using (i) ‘best estimate’ climate sensitivity of 3°C (black line in middle
of shaded area), (ii) upper bound of likely range of climate sensitivity of 4.5°C (red line at top of shaded area) (iii) lower bound of likely range of
climate sensitivity of 2°C (blue line at bottom of shaded area). Black dashed lines in the left panel give the emissions range of recent baseline
scenarios published since the SRES (2000). Emissions ranges of the stabilisation scenarios comprise CO2-only and multigas scenarios and
correspond to the 10th to 90th percentile of the full scenario distribution. Note: CO2 emissions in most models do not include emissions from decay
of above ground biomass that remains after logging and deforestation, and from peat fires and drained peat soils. {Figure 5.1}

The macro-economic costs of mitigation generally rise
with the stringency of the stabilisation target (Table
SPM.7). For specific countries and sectors, costs vary
considerably from the global average.22 {5.6}
In 2050, global average macro-economic costs for mitiga-
tion towards stabilisation between 710 and 445ppm CO2-eq are
between a 1% gain and 5.5% decrease of global GDP (Table
SPM.7). This corresponds to slowing average annual global GDP
growth by less than 0.12 percentage points. {5.6}

Summary for Policymakers

23 Net economic costs of damages from climate change aggregated across the globe and discounted to the specified year.
Responding to climate change involves an iterative risk
management process that includes both adaptation and
mitigation and takes into account climate change dam-
ages, co-benefits, sustainability, equity and attitudes
to risk. {5.1}
Impacts of climate change are very likely to impose net
annual costs, which will increase over time as global tem-
peratures increase. Peer-reviewed estimates of the social cost
of carbon23  in 2005 average US$12 per tonne of CO2, but the
range from 100 estimates is large (-$3 to $95/tCO2). This is
due in large part to differences in assumptions regarding cli-
mate sensitivity, response lags, the treatment of risk and eq-
uity, economic and non-economic impacts, the inclusion of
potentially catastrophic losses and discount rates. Aggregate
estimates of costs mask significant differences in impacts
across sectors, regions and populations and very likely under-
estimate damage costs because they cannot include many non-
quantifiable impacts. {5.7}
Limited and early analytical results from integrated analy-
ses of the costs and benefits of mitigation indicate that they
are broadly comparable in magnitude, but do not as yet permit
an unambiguous determination of an emissions pathway or
stabilisation level where benefits exceed costs. {5.7}
Climate sensitivity is a key uncertainty for mitigation sce-
narios for specific temperature levels. {5.4}
Choices about the scale and timing of GHG mitigation
involve balancing the economic costs of more rapid emission
reductions now against the corresponding medium-term and
long-term climate risks of delay. {5.7}

Climate Change 2007:
Synthesis Report
Synthesis Report
An Assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
This underlying report, adopted section by section at IPCC Plenary XXVII (Valencia, Spain, 12-17 November 2007),
represents the formally agreed statement of the IPCC concerning key findings and uncertainties contained in the Working
Group contributions to the Fourth Assessment Report.

Introduction
This Synthesis Report is based on the assessment carried out
by the three Working Groups (WGs) of the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change (IPCC). It provides an integrated view of cli-
mate change as the final part of the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Re-
port (AR4).
Topic 1 summarises observed changes in climate and their ef-
fects on natural and human systems, regardless of their causes, while
Topic 2 assesses the causes of the observed changes. Topic 3 pre-
sents projections of future climate change and related impacts un-
der different scenarios.
Topic 4 discusses adaptation and mitigation options over the
next few decades and their interactions with sustainable develop-

ment. Topic 5 assesses the relationship between adaptation and
mitigation on a more conceptual basis and takes a longer-term per-
spective. Topic 6 summarises the major robust findings and remain-
ing key uncertainties in this assessment.
A schematic framework representing anthropogenic drivers,
impacts of and responses to climate change, and their linkages, is
shown in Figure I.1. At the time of the Third Assessment Report
(TAR) in 2001, information was mainly available to describe the
linkages clockwise, i.e. to derive climatic changes and impacts from
socio-economic information and emissions. With increased under-
standing of these linkages, it is now possible to assess the linkages
also counterclockwise, i.e. to evaluate possible development path-
ways and global emissions constraints that would reduce the risk
of future impacts that society may wish to avoid.

Treatment of uncertainty
The IPCC uncertainty guidance note1  defines a framework for the treatment of uncertainties across all WGs and in this Synthesis Report.
This framework is broad because the WGs assess material from different disciplines and cover a diversity of approaches to the treatment of
uncertainty drawn from the literature. The nature of data, indicators and analyses used in the natural sciences is generally different from that
used in assessing technology development or the social sciences. WG I focuses on the former, WG III on the latter, and WG II covers aspects
of both.
Three different approaches are used to describe uncertainties each with a distinct form of language. Choices among and within these three
approaches depend on both the nature of the information available and the authors’ expert judgment of the correctness and completeness of
current scientific understanding.
Where uncertainty is assessed qualitatively, it is characterised by providing a relative sense of the amount and quality of evidence (that is,
information from theory, observations or models indicating whether a belief or proposition is true or valid) and the degree of agreement (that is,
the level of concurrence in the literature on a particular finding). This approach is used by WG III through a series of self-explanatory terms
such as: high agreement, much evidence; high agreement, medium evidence; medium agreement, medium evidence; etc.
Where uncertainty is assessed more quantitatively using expert judgement of the correctness of underlying data, models or analyses, then
the following scale of confidence levels is used to express the assessed chance of a finding being correct: very high confidence at least 9 out
of 10; high confidence about 8 out of 10; medium confidence about 5 out of 10; low confidence about 2 out of 10; and very low confidence less
than 1 out of 10.
Where uncertainty in specific outcomes is assessed using expert judgment and statistical analysis of a body of evidence (e.g. observations
or model results), then the following likelihood ranges are used to express the assessed probability of occurrence: virtually certain >99%;
extremely likely >95%; very likely >90%; likely >66%; more likely than not > 50%; about as likely as not 33% to 66%; unlikely <33%; very
unlikely <10%; extremely unlikely <5%; exceptionally unlikely <1%.
WG II has used a combination of confidence and likelihood assessments and WG I has predominantly used likelihood assessments.
This Synthesis Report follows the uncertainty assessment of the underlying WGs. Where synthesised findings are based on information
from more than one WG, the description of uncertainty used is consistent with that for the components drawn from the respective WG reports.
Unless otherwise stated, numerical ranges given in square brackets in this report indicate 90% uncertainty intervals (i.e. there is an
estimated 5% likelihood that the value could be above the range given in square brackets and 5% likelihood that the value could be below that
range). Uncertainty intervals are not necessarily symmetric around the best estimate.

Observed changes in climate and their effects
30
1.1 Observations of climate change
Since the TAR, progress in understanding how climate is chang-
ing in space and time has been gained through improvements and
extensions of numerous datasets and data analyses, broader geo-
graphical coverage, better understanding of uncertainties and a wider
variety of measurements. {WGI SPM}
Definitions of climate change
Climate change in IPCC usage refers to a change in the state
of the climate that can be identified (e.g. using statistical tests)
by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties,
and that persists for an extended period, typically decades or
longer. It refers to any change in climate over time, whether
due to natural variability or as a result of human activity. This
usage differs from that in the United Nations Framework Con-
vention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), where climate change
refers to a change of climate that is attributed directly or indi-
rectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global
atmosphere and that is in addition to natural climate variability
observed over comparable time periods.
Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as is now
evident from observations of increases in global average
air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow
and ice and rising global average sea level (Figure 1.1). {WGI
3.2, 4.8, 5.2, 5.5, SPM}
Eleven of the last twelve years (1995-2006) rank among the
twelve warmest years in the instrumental record of global surface
temperature (since 1850). The 100-year linear trend (1906-2005)
of 0.74 [0.56 to 0.92]°C is larger than the corresponding trend of
0.6 [0.4 to 0.8]°C (1901-2000) given in the TAR (Figure 1.1). The
linear warming trend over the 50 years from 1956 to 2005 (0.13
[0.10 to 0.16]°C per decade) is nearly twice that for the 100 years
from 1906 to 2005. {WGI 3.2, SPM}
The temperature increase is widespread over the globe and is
greater at higher northern latitudes (Figure 1.2). Average Arctic tem-
peratures have increased at almost twice the global average rate in
the past 100 years. Land regions have warmed faster than the oceans
(Figures 1.2 and 2.5). Observations since 1961 show that the aver-
age temperature of the global ocean has increased to depths of at
least 3000m and that the ocean has been taking up over 80% of the
heat being added to the climate system. New analyses of balloon-
borne and satellite measurements of lower- and mid-tropospheric
temperature show warming rates similar to those observed in sur-
face temperature. {WGI 3.2, 3.4, 5.2, SPM}
Increases in sea level are consistent with warming (Figure 1.1).
Global average sea level rose at an average rate of 1.8 [1.3 to 2.3]mm
per year over 1961 to 2003 and at an average rate of about 3.1 [2.4
to 3.8]mm per year from 1993 to 2003. Whether this faster rate for
1993 to 2003 reflects decadal variation or an increase in the longer-
term trend is unclear. Since 1993 thermal expansion of the oceans
has contributed about 57% of the sum of the estimated individual
contributions to the sea level rise, with decreases in glaciers and
ice caps contributing about 28% and losses from the polar ice sheets
contributing the remainder. From 1993 to 2003 the sum of these
climate contributions is consistent within uncertainties with the total
sea level rise that is directly observed. {WGI 4.6, 4.8, 5.5, SPM, Table
SPM.1}
Observed decreases in snow and ice extent are also consistent
with warming (Figure 1.1). Satellite data since 1978 show that an-
nual average Arctic sea ice extent has shrunk by 2.7 [2.1 to 3.3]%
per decade, with larger decreases in summer of 7.4 [5.0 to 9.8]%
per decade. Mountain glaciers and snow cover on average have
declined in both hemispheres. The maximum areal extent of sea-
sonally frozen ground has decreased by about 7% in the Northern
Hemisphere since 1900, with decreases in spring of up to 15%.
Temperatures at the top of the permafrost layer have generally in-
creased since the 1980s in the Arctic by up to 3°C. {WGI 3.2, 4.5, 4.6,
4.7, 4.8, 5.5, SPM}
At continental, regional and ocean basin scales, numerous long-
term changes in other aspects of climate have also been observed.
Trends from 1900 to 2005 have been observed in precipitation
amount in many large regions. Over this period, precipitation in-
creased significantly in eastern parts of North and South America,
northern Europe and northern and central Asia whereas precipita-
tion declined in the Sahel, the Mediterranean, southern Africa and
parts of southern Asia. Globally, the area affected by drought has
likely2 increased since the 1970s. {WGI 3.3, 3.9, SPM}
Some extreme weather events have changed in frequency and/
or intensity over the last 50 years:
�
It is very likely that cold days, cold nights and frosts have be-
come less frequent over most land areas, while hot days and
hot nights have become more frequent. {WGI 3.8, SPM}
�
It is likely that heat waves have become more frequent over
most land areas. {WGI 3.8, SPM}
�
It is likely that the frequency of heavy precipitation events (or
proportion of total rainfall from heavy falls) has increased over
most areas. {WGI 3.8, 3.9, SPM}
�
It is likely that the incidence of extreme high sea level3  has
increased at a broad range of sites worldwide since 1975. {WGI
5.5, SPM}
There is observational evidence of an increase in intense tropical
cyclone activity in the North Atlantic since about 1970, and sugges-
tions of increased intense tropical cyclone activity in some other re-
gions where concerns over data quality are greater. Multi-decadal vari-
ability and the quality of the tropical cyclone records prior to routine
satellite observations in about 1970 complicate the detection of long-
term trends in tropical cyclone activity. {WGI 3.8, SPM}
Average Northern Hemisphere temperatures during the second
half of the 20th century were very likely higher than during any other
50-year period in the last 500 years and likely the highest in at least
the past 1300 years. {WGI 6.6, SPM}

1.2 Observed effects of climate changes
The statements presented here are based largely on data sets
that cover the period since 1970. The number of studies of observed
trends in the physical and biological environment and their rela-
tionship to regional climate changes has increased greatly since the
TAR. The quality of the data sets has also improved. There is a
notable lack of geographic balance in data and literature on ob-
served changes, with marked scarcity in developing countries.
{WGII SPM}
These studies have allowed a broader and more confident as-
sessment of the relationship between observed warming and im-
pacts than was made in the TAR. That assessment concluded that
“there is high confidence2 that recent regional changes in tempera-
ture have had discernible impacts on physical and biological sys-
tems”. {WGII SPM}
Observational evidence from all continents and most oceans
shows that many natural systems are being affected by re-
gional climate changes, particularly temperature increases.
{WGII SPM}
There is high confidence that natural systems related to snow, ice
and frozen ground (including permafrost) are affected. Examples are:
�
enlargement and increased numbers of glacial lakes {WGII 1.3, SPM}
�
increasing ground instability in permafrost regions and rock
avalanches in mountain regions {WGII 1.3, SPM}
�
changes in some Arctic and Antarctic ecosystems, including
those in sea-ice biomes, and predators at high levels of the food
web. {WGII 1.3, 4.4, 15.4, SPM}
Based on growing evidence, there is high confidence that the
following effects on hydrological systems are occurring: increased
runoff and earlier spring peak discharge in many glacier- and snow-
fed rivers, and warming of lakes and rivers in many regions, with
effects on thermal structure and water quality. {WGII 1.3, 15.2, SPM}

Figure 1.2.  Locations of significant changes in data series of physical systems (snow, ice and frozen ground; hydrology; and coastal processes) and
biological systems (terrestrial, marine, and freshwater biological systems), are shown together with surface air temperature changes over the period 1970-
2004. A subset of about 29,000 data series was selected from about 80,000 data series from 577 studies. These met the following criteria: (1) ending in 1990
or later; (2) spanning a period of at least 20 years; and (3) showing a significant change in either direction, as assessed in individual studies. These data
series are from about 75 studies (of which about 70 are new since the TAR) and contain about 29,000 data series, of which about 28,000 are from European
studies. White areas do not contain sufficient observational climate data to estimate a temperature trend. The 2 x 2 boxes show the total number of data
series with significant changes (top row) and the percentage of those consistent with warming (bottom row) for (i) continental regions: North America (NAM),
Latin America (LA), Europe (EUR), Africa (AFR), Asia (AS), Australia and New Zealand (ANZ), and Polar Regions (PR) and (ii) global-scale: Terrestrial
(TER), Marine and Freshwater (MFW), and Global (GLO). The numbers of studies from the seven regional boxes (NAM, …, PR) do not add up to the global

area marine changes are not shown on the map. {WGII Figure SPM.1, Figure 1.8, Figure 1.9; WGI Figure 3.9b}

There is very high confidence, based on more evidence from a
wider range of species, that recent warming is strongly affecting
terrestrial biological systems, including such changes as earlier tim-
ing of spring events, such as leaf-unfolding, bird migration and
egg-laying; and poleward and upward shifts in ranges in plant and
animal species. Based on satellite observations since the early 1980s,
there is high confidence that there has been a trend in many regions
towards earlier ‘greening’ of vegetation in the spring linked to longer
thermal growing seasons due to recent warming. {WGII 1.3, 8.2, 14.2,
SPM}
There is high confidence, based on substantial new evidence,
that observed changes in marine and freshwater biological systems
are associated with rising water temperatures, as well as related
changes in ice cover, salinity, oxygen levels and circulation. These
include: shifts in ranges and changes in algal, plankton and fish
abundance in high-latitude oceans; increases in algal and zooplank-
ton abundance in high-latitude and high-altitude lakes; and range
changes and earlier fish migrations in rivers. While there is increas-
ing evidence of climate change impacts on coral reefs, separating
the impacts of climate-related stresses from other stresses (e.g. over-
fishing and pollution) is difficult. {WGII 1.3, SPM}
Other effects of regional climate changes on natural and
human environments are emerging, although many are dif-
ficult to discern due to adaptation and non-climatic drivers.
{WGII SPM}
Effects of temperature increases have been documented with
medium confidence in the following managed and human systems:
�
agricultural and forestry management at Northern Hemisphere
higher latitudes, such as earlier spring planting of crops, and
alterations in disturbances of forests due to fires and pests {WGII
1.3, SPM}
�
some aspects of human health, such as excess heat-related
mortality in Europe, changes in infectious disease vectors in
parts of Europe, and earlier onset of and increases in seasonal
production of allergenic pollen in Northern Hemisphere high
and mid-latitudes {WGII 1.3, 8.2, 8.ES, SPM}
�
some human activities in the Arctic (e.g. hunting and shorter
travel seasons over snow and ice) and in lower-elevation alpine
areas (such as limitations in mountain sports). {WGII 1.3, SPM}
Sea level rise and human development are together contribut-
ing to losses of coastal wetlands and mangroves and increasing
damage from coastal flooding in many areas. However, based on
the published literature, the impacts have not yet become estab-
lished trends. {WGII 1.3, 1.ES, SPM}
1.3 Consistency of changes in physical and
biological systems with warming
Changes in the ocean and on land, including observed decreases
in snow cover and Northern Hemisphere sea ice extent, thinner sea
ice, shorter freezing seasons of lake and river ice, glacier melt, de-
creases in permafrost extent, increases in soil temperatures and
borehole temperature profiles, and sea level rise, provide additional
evidence that the world is warming. {WGI 3.9}
Of the more than 29,000 observational data series, from 75 stud-
ies, that show significant change in many physical and biological
systems, more than 89% are consistent with the direction of change
expected as a response to warming (Figure 1.2). {WGII 1.4, SPM}
1.4 Some aspects of climate have not been
observed to change
Some aspects of climate appear not to have changed and, for
some, data inadequacies mean that it cannot be determined if they
have changed. Antarctic sea ice extent shows inter-annual variabil-
ity and localised changes but no statistically significant average
multi-decadal trend, consistent with the lack of rise in near-surface
atmospheric temperatures averaged across the continent. There is
insufficient evidence to determine whether trends exist in some other
variables, for example the meridional overturning circulation (MOC)
of the global ocean or small-scale phenomena such as tornadoes,
hail, lightning and dust storms. There is no clear trend in the annual
numbers of tropical cyclones. {WGI 3.2, 3.8, 4.4, 5.3, SPM}

Causes of change
This Topic considers both natural and anthropogenic drivers of
climate change, including the chain from greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions to atmospheric concentrations to radiative forcing4  to
climate responses and effects.
2.1 Emissions of long-lived GHGs
The radiative forcing of the climate system is dominated by the
long-lived GHGs, and this section considers those whose emissions
are covered by the UNFCCC.
Global GHG emissions due to human activities have grown
since pre-industrial times, with an increase of 70% between
1970 and 2004 (Figure 2.1).5 {WGIII 1.3, SPM}
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most important anthropogenic GHG.
Its annual emissions have grown between 1970 and 2004 by about
80%, from 21 to 38 gigatonnes (Gt), and represented 77% of total
anthropogenic GHG emissions in 2004 (Figure 2.1). The rate of
growth of CO2-eq emissions was much higher during the recent
10-year period of 1995-2004 (0.92 GtCO2-eq per year) than during
the previous period of 1970-1994 (0.43 GtCO2-eq per year). {WGIII
1.3, TS.1, SPM}
4 Radiative forcing is a measure of the influence a factor has in altering the balance of incoming and outgoing energy in the Earth-atmosphere system and
is an index of the importance of the factor as a potential climate change mechanism. In this report radiative forcing values are for changes relative to pre-
industrial conditions defined at 1750 and are expressed in watts per square metre (W/m2).
5 Includes only carbon dioxide (CO2 ), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphurhexafluoride
(SF6), whose emissions are covered by the UNFCCC. These GHGs are weighted by their 100-year Global Warming Potentials (GWPs), using values
consistent with reporting under the UNFCCC.
6 This report uses 100-year GWPs and numerical values consistent with reporting under the UNFCCC.
7 Such values may consider only GHGs, or a combination of GHGs and aerosols.
Carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO2-eq) emissions and
concentrations
GHGs differ in their warming influence (radiative forcing) on
the global climate system due to their different radiative prop-
erties and lifetimes in the atmosphere. These warming influ-
ences may be expressed through a common metric based on
the radiative forcing of CO2.
•
CO2-equivalent emission is the amount of CO2 emission
that would cause the same time-integrated radiative forcing,
over a given time horizon, as an emitted amount of a long-
lived GHG or a mixture of GHGs. The equivalent CO2 emis-
sion is obtained by multiplying the emission of a GHG by its
Global Warming Potential (GWP) for the given time horizon.6
For a mix of GHGs it is obtained by summing the equivalent
CO2 emissions of each gas. Equivalent CO2 emission is a
standard and useful metric for comparing emissions of dif-
ferent GHGs but does not imply the same climate change
responses (see WGI 2.10).
•
CO2-equivalent concentration is the concentration of CO2
that would cause the same amount of radiative forcing as a
given mixture of CO2 and other forcing components.7

The effect on global emissions of the decrease in global energy
intensity (-33%) during 1970 to 2004 has been smaller than the com-
bined effect of global income growth (77%) and global population
growth (69%); both drivers of increasing energy-related CO2 emis-
sions. The long-term trend of declining CO2 emissions per unit of en-
ergy supplied reversed after 2000. {WGIII 1.3, Figure SPM.2, SPM}
Differences in per capita income, per capita emissions and
energy intensity among countries remain significant. In 2004,
UNFCCC Annex I countries held a 20% share in world population,
produced 57% of the world’s Gross Domestic Product based on
Purchasing Power Parity (GDPPPP) and accounted for 46% of glo-
bal GHG emissions (Figure 2.2). {WGIII 1.3, SPM}
2.2 Drivers of climate change
Changes in the atmospheric concentrations of GHGs and aero-
sols, land cover and solar radiation alter the energy balance of the
climate system and are drivers of climate change. They affect the
absorption, scattering and emission of radiation within the atmo-
sphere and at the Earth’s surface. The resulting positive or negative
changes in energy balance due to these factors are expressed as
radiative forcing4, which is used to compare warming or cooling
influences on global climate. {WGI TS.2}
Human activities result in emissions of four long-lived GHGs:
CO2, methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and halocarbons (a group
of gases containing fluorine, chlorine or bromine). Atmospheric
concentrations of GHGs increase when emissions are larger than
removal processes.
Global atmospheric concentrations of CO2, CH4 and N2O
have increased markedly as a result of human activities
since 1750 and now far exceed pre-industrial values deter-
mined from ice cores spanning many thousands of years
(Figure 2.3). The atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and CH4
in 2005 exceed by far the natural range over the last 650,000
years. Global increases in CO2 concentrations are due pri-
marily to fossil fuel use, with land-use change providing
another significant but smaller contribution. It is very likely
that the observed increase in CH4 concentration is predomi-
nantly due to agriculture and fossil fuel use. The increase
in N2O concentration is primarily due to agriculture. {WGI
2.3, 7.3, SPM}
The global atmospheric concentration of CO2 increased from a
pre-industrial value of about 280ppm to 379ppm in 2005. The an-
nual CO2 concentration growth rate was larger during the last 10
years (1995-2005 average: 1.9ppm per year) than it has been since
the beginning of continuous direct atmospheric measurements
(1960-2005 average: 1.4ppm per year), although there is year-to-
year variability in growth rates. {WGI 2.3, 7.3, SPM; WGIII 1.3}
The global atmospheric concentration of CH4 has increased from
a pre-industrial value of about 715ppb to 1732ppb in the early 1990s,
and was 1774ppb in 2005. Growth rates have declined since the
early 1990s, consistent with total emissions (sum of anthropogenic
and natural sources) being nearly constant during this period. {WGI
2.3, 7.4, SPM}
The global atmospheric N2O concentration increased from a
pre-industrial value of about 270ppb to 319ppb in 2005. {WGI 2.3,
7.4, SPM}
Many halocarbons (including hydrofluorocarbons) have in-
creased from a near-zero pre-industrial background concentration,
primarily due to human activities. {WGI 2.3, SPM; SROC SPM}
There is very high confidence that the global average net
effect of human activities since 1750 has been one of warm-
ing, with a radiative forcing of +1.6 [+0.6 to +2.4] W/m2
(Figure 2.4). {WGI 2.3, 6.5, 2.9, SPM}
The combined radiative forcing due to increases in CO2, CH4
and N2O is +2.3 [+2.1 to +2.5] W/m2, and its rate of increase during

the industrial era is very likely to have been unprecedented in more
than 10,000 years (Figures 2.3 and 2.4). The CO2 radiative forcing
increased by 20% from 1995 to 2005, the largest change for any
decade in at least the last 200 years. {WGI 2.3, 6.4, SPM}
Anthropogenic contributions to aerosols (primarily sulphate,
organic carbon, black carbon, nitrate and dust) together produce a
cooling effect, with a total direct radiative forcing of -0.5 [-0.9 to
-0.1] W/m2 and an indirect cloud albedo forcing of -0.7 [-1.8 to
-0.3] W/m2. Aerosols also influence precipitation. {WGI 2.4, 2.9, 7.5,
SPM}
In comparison, changes in solar irradiance since 1750 are esti-
mated to have caused a small radiative forcing of +0.12 [+0.06 to
+0.30] W/m2, which is less than half the estimate given in the TAR.
{WGI 2.7, SPM}
2.3 Climate sensitivity and feedbacks
The equilibrium climate sensitivity is a measure of the climate
system response to sustained radiative forcing. It is defined as the
equilibrium global average surface warming following a doubling
of CO2 concentration. Progress since the TAR enables an assess-
ment that climate sensitivity is likely to be in the range of 2 to 4.5°C
with a best estimate of about 3°C, and is very unlikely to be less
than 1.5°C. Values substantially higher than 4.5°C cannot be ex-
cluded, but agreement of models with observations is not as good
for those values. {WGI 8.6, 9.6, Box 10.2, SPM}
Feedbacks can amplify or dampen the response to a given forc-
ing. Direct emission of water vapour (a greenhouse gas) by human
activities makes a negligible contribution to radiative forcing. How-
ever, as global average temperature increases, tropospheric water
vapour concentrations increase and this represents a key positive
feedback but not a forcing of climate change. Water vapour changes
represent the largest feedback affecting equilibrium climate sensi-
tivity and are now better understood than in the TAR. Cloud feed-
backs remain the largest source of uncertainty. Spatial patterns of
climate response are largely controlled by climate processes and
feedbacks. For example, sea-ice albedo feedbacks tend to enhance
the high latitude response. {WGI 2.8, 8.6, 9.2, TS.2.1.3, TS.2.5, SPM}
Warming reduces terrestrial and ocean uptake of atmospheric
CO2, increasing the fraction of anthropogenic emissions remaining
in the atmosphere. This positive carbon cycle feedback leads to
larger atmospheric CO2 increases and greater climate change for a
given emissions scenario, but the strength of this feedback effect
varies markedly among models. {WGI 7.3, TS.5.4, SPM; WGII 4.4}
2.4 Attribution of climate change
Attribution evaluates whether observed changes are quantita-
tively consistent with the expected response to external forcings
(e.g. changes in solar irradiance or anthropogenic GHGs) and in-
consistent with alternative physically plausible explanations. {WGI
TS.4, SPM}

important agents and mechanisms, together with the typical geographical extent (spatial scale) of the forcing and the assessed level of scientific understand-
ing (LOSU). Aerosols from explosive volcanic eruptions contribute an additional episodic cooling term for a few years following an eruption. The range for
linear contrails does not include other possible effects of aviation on cloudiness. {WGI Figure SPM.2}
Most of the observed increase in global average tempera-
tures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the
observed increase in anthropogenic GHG concentrations.8
This is an advance since the TAR’s conclusion that “most
of the observed warming over the last 50 years is likely to
have been due to the increase in GHG concentrations” (Fig-
ure 2.5). {WGI 9.4, SPM}
The observed widespread warming of the atmosphere and ocean,
together with ice mass loss, support the conclusion that it is ex-
tremely unlikely that global climate change of the past 50 years can
be explained without external forcing and very likely that it is not
due to known natural causes alone. During this period, the sum of
solar and volcanic forcings would likely have produced cooling,
not warming. Warming of the climate system has been detected in
changes in surface and atmospheric temperatures and in tempera-
tures of the upper several hundred metres of the ocean. The ob-
served pattern of tropospheric warming and stratospheric cooling
is very likely due to the combined influences of GHG increases and
stratospheric ozone depletion. It is likely that increases in GHG
concentrations alone would have caused more warming than ob-
served because volcanic and anthropogenic aerosols have offset
some warming that would otherwise have taken place. {WGI 2.9, 3.2,
3.4, 4.8, 5.2, 7.5, 9.4, 9.5, 9.7, TS.4.1, SPM}
It is likely that there has been significant anthropogenic
warming over the past 50 years averaged over each conti-
nent (except Antarctica) (Figure 2.5). {WGI 3.2, 9.4, SPM}
The observed patterns of warming, including greater warming
over land than over the ocean, and their changes over time, are
simulated only by models that include anthropogenic forcing. No
coupled global climate model that has used natural forcing only
has reproduced the continental mean warming trends in individual
continents (except Antarctica) over the second half of the 20th cen-
tury. {WGI 3.2, 9.4, TS.4.2, SPM}

Global and continental temperature change

natural or both natural and anthropogenic forcings. Decadal averages of observations are shown for the period 1906-2005 (black line) plotted against the
centre of the decade and relative to the corresponding average for the 1901-1950. Lines are dashed where spatial coverage is less than 50%. Blue shaded
bands show the 5 to 95% range for 19 simulations from five climate models using only the natural forcings due to solar activity and volcanoes. Red shaded
bands show the 5 to 95% range for 58 simulations from 14 climate models using both natural and anthropogenic forcings. {WGI Figure SPM.4}
Difficulties remain in simulating and attributing observed tem-
perature changes at smaller scales. On these scales, natural climate
variability is relatively larger, making it harder to distinguish changes
expected due to external forcings. Uncertainties in local forcings,
such as those due to aerosols and land-use change, and feedbacks
also make it difficult to estimate the contribution of GHG increases
to observed small-scale temperature changes. {WGI 8.3, 9.4, SPM}
Advances since the TAR show that discernible human in-
fluences extend beyond average temperature to other as-
pects of climate, including temperature extremes and wind
patterns. {WGI 9.4, 9.5, SPM}
Temperatures of the most extreme hot nights, cold nights and
cold days are likely to have increased due to anthropogenic forcing.
It is more likely than not that anthropogenic forcing has increased
the risk of heat waves. Anthropogenic forcing is likely to have con-
tributed to changes in wind patterns, affecting extra-tropical storm
tracks and temperature patterns in both hemispheres. However, the
observed changes in the Northern Hemisphere circulation are larger
than simulated by models in response to 20th century forcing change.
{WGI 3.5, 3.6, 9.4, 9.5, 10.3, SPM}
It is very likely that the response to anthropogenic forcing con-
tributed to sea level rise during the latter half of the 20th century.

on the hydrological cycle, including the observed large-scale pat-
terns of changes in land precipitation over the 20th century. It is
more likely than not that human influence has contributed to a glo-
bal trend towards increases in area affected by drought since the
1970s and the frequency of heavy precipitation events. {WGI 3.3,
5.5, 9.5, TS.4.1, TS.4.3}
Anthropogenic warming over the last three decades has
likely had a discernible influence at the global scale on ob-
served changes in many physical and biological systems.
{WGII 1.4}
A synthesis of studies strongly demonstrates that the spatial
agreement between regions of significant warming across the globe
and the locations of significant observed changes in many natural
systems consistent with warming is very unlikely to be due solely
to natural variability of temperatures or natural variability of the
systems. Several modelling studies have linked some specific re-
sponses in physical and biological systems to anthropogenic warm-
ing, but only a few such studies have been performed. Taken to-
gether with evidence of significant anthropogenic warming over
the past 50 years averaged over each continent (except Antarctica),
it is likely that anthropogenic warming over the last three decades
has had a discernible influence on many natural systems. {WGI 3.2,
9.4, SPM; WGII 1.4, SPM}
Limitations and gaps currently prevent more complete attribu-
tion of the causes of observed natural system responses to anthro-
pogenic warming. The available analyses are limited in the number
of systems, length of records and locations considered. Natural tem-
perature variability is larger at the regional than the global scale,
thus affecting identification of changes to external forcing. At the re-
gional scale, other non-climate factors (such as land-use change, pol-
lution and invasive species) are influential. {WGII 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, SPM}

3.1
Emissions scenarios
There is high agreement and much evidence9 that with cur-
rent climate change mitigation policies and related sustain-
able development practices, global GHG emissions will con-
tinue to grow over the next few decades. Baseline emis-
sions scenarios published since the IPCC Special Report
on Emissions Scenarios (SRES, 2000) are comparable in
range to those presented in SRES (see Box on SRES sce-
narios and Figure 3.1).10 {WGIII 1.3, 3.2, SPM}
The SRES scenarios project an increase of baseline global GHG
emissions by a range of 9.7 to 36.7 GtCO2-eq (25 to 90%) between
2000 and 2030. In these scenarios, fossil fuels are projected to
maintain their dominant position in the global energy mix to 2030
and beyond. Hence CO2 emissions from energy use between 2000
and 2030 are projected to grow 40 to 110% over that period. {WGIII
1.3, SPM}
Studies published since SRES (i.e. post-SRES scenarios) have
used lower values for some drivers for emissions, notably popula-
tion projections. However, for those studies incorporating these new
population projections, changes in other drivers, such as economic
growth, result in little change in overall emission levels. Economic
growth projections for Africa, Latin America and the Middle East
to 2030 in post-SRES baseline scenarios are lower than in SRES,
but this has only minor effects on global economic growth and over-
all emissions. {WGIII 3.2, TS.3, SPM}
Aerosols have a net cooling effect and the representation of
aerosol and aerosol precursor emissions, including sulphur diox-
ide, black carbon and organic carbon, has improved in the post-
SRES scenarios. Generally, these emissions are projected to be lower
than reported in SRES. {WGIII 3.2, TS.3, SPM}
Available studies indicate that the choice of exchange rate for

9 Agreement/evidence statements in italics represent calibrated expressions of uncertainty and confidence. See Box ‘Treatment of uncertainty’ in the Intro-
duction for an explanation of these terms.
10 Baseline scenarios do not include additional climate policies above current ones; more recent studies differ with respect to UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol
inclusion. Emission pathways of mitigation scenarios are discussed in Topic 5.
11 Since the TAR, there has been a debate on the use of different exchange rates in emissions scenarios. Two metrics are used to compare GDP between
countries. Use of MER is preferable for analyses involving internationally traded products. Use of PPP is preferable for analyses involving comparisons of
income between countries at very different stages of development. Most of the monetary units in this report are expressed in MER. This reflects the large
majority of emissions mitigation literature that is calibrated in MER. When monetary units are expressed in PPP, this is denoted by GDPPPP. {WGIII SPM}
SRES scenarios
SRES refers to the scenarios described in the IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES, 2000). The SRES scenarios are
grouped into four scenario families (A1, A2, B1 and B2) that explore alternative development pathways, covering a wide range of
demographic, economic and technological driving forces and resulting GHG emissions. The SRES scenarios do not include additional
climate policies above current ones. The emissions projections are widely used in the assessments of future climate change, and their
underlying assumptions with respect to socio-economic, demographic and technological change serve as inputs to many recent climate
change vulnerability and impact assessments. {WGI 10.1; WGII 2.4; WGIII TS.1, SPM}
The A1 storyline assumes a world of very rapid economic growth, a global population that peaks in mid-century and rapid introduc-
tion of new and more efficient technologies. A1 is divided into three groups that describe alternative directions of technological change:
fossil intensive (A1FI), non-fossil energy resources (A1T) and a balance across all sources (A1B). B1 describes a convergent world,
with the same global population as A1, but with more rapid changes in economic structures toward a service and information economy.
B2 describes a world with intermediate population and economic growth, emphasising local solutions to economic, social, and environ-
mental sustainability. A2 describes a very heterogeneous world with high population growth, slow economic development and slow
technological change. No likelihood has been attached to any of the SRES scenarios. {WGIII TS.1, SPM}

Projections of future changes in climate
For the next two decades a warming of about 0.2°C per de-
cade is projected for a range of SRES emissions scenarios.
Even if the concentrations of all GHGs and aerosols had
been kept constant at year 2000 levels, a further warming of
about 0.1°C per decade would be expected. Afterwards, tem-
perature projections increasingly depend on specific emis-
sions scenarios (Figure 3.2). {WGI 10.3, 10.7; WGIII 3.2}
Since the IPCC’s first report in 1990, assessed projections have
suggested global averaged temperature increases between about 0.15
and 0.3°C per decade from 1990 to 2005. This can now be com-
pared with observed values of about 0.2°C per decade, strengthen-
ing confidence in near-term projections. {WGI 1.2, 3.2}
3.2.1
21st century global changes
Continued GHG emissions at or above current rates would
cause further warming and induce many changes in the glo-
bal climate system during the 21st century that would very
likely be larger than those observed during the 20th century.
{WGI 10.3}
Advances in climate change modelling now enable best esti-
mates and likely assessed uncertainty ranges to be given for pro-
jected warming for different emissions scenarios. Table 3.1 shows
best estimates and likely ranges for global average surface air warm-
ing for the six SRES marker emissions scenarios (including cli-
mate-carbon cycle feedbacks). {WGI 10.5}
Although these projections are broadly consistent with the span
quoted in the TAR (1.4 to 5.8°C), they are not directly comparable.
Assessed upper ranges for temperature projections are larger than
in the TAR mainly because the broader range of models now avail-
able suggests stronger climate-carbon cycle feedbacks. For the A2
scenario, for example, the climate-carbon cycle feedback increases
the corresponding global average warming at 2100 by more than
1°C. Carbon feedbacks are discussed in Topic 2.3. {WGI 7.3, 10.5,
SPM}
Because understanding of some important effects driving sea
level rise is too limited, this report does not assess the likelihood,
nor provide a best estimate or an upper bound for sea level rise.
Model-based projections of global average sea level rise at the end
of the 21st century (2090-2099) are shown in Table 3.1. For each
scenario, the mid-point of the range in Table 3.1 is within 10% of
the TAR model average for 2090-2099. The ranges are narrower
than in the TAR mainly because of improved information about
some uncertainties in the projected contributions.12  The sea level
projections do not include uncertainties in climate-carbon cycle
feedbacks nor do they include the full effects of changes in ice
sheet flow, because a basis in published literature is lacking. There-
fore the upper values of the ranges given are not to be considered
upper bounds for sea level rise. The projections include a contribu-
tion due to increased ice flow from Greenland and Antarctica at the
rates observed for 1993-2003, but these flow rates could increase
or decrease in the future. If this contribution were to grow linearly
with global average temperature change, the upper ranges of sea
level rise for SRES scenarios shown in Table 3.1 would increase by
0.1 to 0.2m.13 {WGI 10.6, SPM}

Notes:
a) These estimates are assessed from a hierarchy of models that encompass a simple climate model, several Earth Models of Intermediate
Complexity, and a large number of Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs) as well as observational constraints.
b) Year 2000 constant composition is derived from AOGCMs only.
c) All scenarios above are six SRES marker scenarios. Approximate CO2-eq concentrations corresponding to the computed radiative forcing due to
anthropogenic GHGs and aerosols in 2100 (see p. 823 of the WGI TAR) for the SRES B1, AIT, B2, A1B, A2 and A1FI illustrative marker scenarios
are about 600, 700, 800, 850, 1250 and 1550ppm, respectively.
d) Temperature changes are expressed as the difference from the period 1980-1999. To express the change relative to the period 1850-1899 add
0.5°C.
12 TAR projections were made for 2100, whereas the projections for this report are for 2090-2099. The TAR would have had similar ranges to those in
Table 3.1 if it had treated uncertainties in the same way.

3.2.2
21st century regional changes
There is now higher confidence than in the TAR in projected
patterns of warming and other regional-scale features, in-
cluding changes in wind patterns, precipitation and some
aspects of extremes and sea ice. {WGI 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 9.4, 9.5,
10.3, 11.1}
Projected warming in the 21st century shows scenario-indepen-
dent geographical patterns similar to those observed over the past
several decades. Warming is expected to be greatest over land and
at most high northern latitudes, and least over the Southern Ocean
(near Antarctica) and northern North Atlantic, continuing recent
observed trends (Figure 3.2 right panels). {WGI 10.3, SPM}
Snow cover area is projected to contract. Widespread increases
in thaw depth are projected over most permafrost regions. Sea ice
is projected to shrink in both the Arctic and Antarctic under all
SRES scenarios. In some projections, Arctic late-summer sea ice
disappears almost entirely by the latter part of the 21st century. {WGI
10.3, 10.6, SPM; WGII 15.3.4}
It is very likely that hot extremes, heat waves and heavy pre-
cipitation events will become more frequent. {SYR Table 3.2; WGI
10.3, SPM}
Based on a range of models, it is likely that future tropical cy-
clones (typhoons and hurricanes) will become more intense, with
larger peak wind speeds and more heavy precipitation associated
with ongoing increases of tropical sea-surface temperatures. There
is less confidence in projections of a global decrease in numbers of
tropical cyclones. The apparent increase in the proportion of very
intense storms since 1970 in some regions is much larger than simu-
lated by current models for that period. {WGI 3.8, 9.5, 10.3, SPM}
Extra-tropical storm tracks are projected to move poleward, with
consequent changes in wind, precipitation and temperature patterns,
continuing the broad pattern of observed trends over the last half-
century. {WGI 3.6, 10.3, SPM}
Since the TAR there is an improving understanding of projected
patterns of precipitation. Increases in the amount of precipitation
are very likely in high-latitudes, while decreases are likely in most
subtropical land regions (by as much as about 20% in the A1B sce-
nario in 2100, Figure 3.3), continuing observed patterns in recent
trends. {WGI 3.3, 8.3, 9.5, 10.3, 11.2-11.9, SPM}
3.2.3
Changes beyond the 21st century
Anthropogenic warming and sea level rise would continue
for centuries due to the time scales associated with climate
processes and feedbacks, even if GHG concentrations were
to be stabilised. {WGI 10.4, 10.5, 10.7, SPM}
If radiative forcing were to be stabilised, keeping all the radia-
tive forcing agents constant at B1 or A1B levels in 2100, model
experiments show that a further increase in global average tem-
perature of about 0.5°C would still be expected by 2200. In addi-
tion, thermal expansion alone would lead to 0.3 to 0.8m of sea
level rise by 2300 (relative to 1980-1999). Thermal expansion would
continue for many centuries, due to the time required to transport
heat into the deep ocean. {WGI 10.7, SPM}

The bars in the middle of the figure indicate the best estimate (solid line within each bar) and the likely range assessed for the six SRES marker scenarios

Models (AOGCMs) in the left part of the figure, as well as results from a hierarchy of independent models and observational constraints.

Topic 3
Climate change and its impacts in the near and long term under different scenarios
Contraction of the Greenland ice sheet is projected to continue
to contribute to sea level rise after 2100. Current models suggest
ice mass losses increase with temperature more rapidly than gains
due to increased precipitation and that the surface mass balance
becomes negative (net ice loss) at a global average warming (rela-
tive to pre-industrial values) in excess of 1.9 to 4.6°C. If such a
negative surface mass balance were sustained for millennia, that
would lead to virtually complete elimination of the Greenland ice
sheet and a resulting contribution to sea level rise of about 7m. The
corresponding future temperatures in Greenland (1.9 to 4.6°C glo-
bal) are comparable to those inferred for the last interglacial period
125,000 years ago, when palaeoclimatic information suggests re-
ductions of polar land ice extent and 4 to 6m of sea level rise. {WGI
6.4, 10.7, SPM}
Dynamical processes related to ice flow – which are not in-
cluded in current models but suggested by recent observations –
could increase the vulnerability of the ice sheets to warming, in-
creasing future sea level rise. Understanding of these processes is
limited and there is no consensus on their magnitude. {WGI 4.6, 10.7,
SPM}
Current global model studies project that the Antarctic ice sheet
will remain too cold for widespread surface melting and gain mass
due to increased snowfall. However, net loss of ice mass could oc-
cur if dynamical ice discharge dominates the ice sheet mass bal-
ance. {WGI 10.7, SPM}
Both past and future anthropogenic CO2 emissions will con-
tinue to contribute to warming and sea level rise for more than a
millennium, due to the time scales required for the removal of this
gas from the atmosphere. {WGI 7.3, 10.3, Figure 7.12, Figure 10.35, SPM}
Estimated long-term (multi-century) warming corresponding to
the six AR4 WG III stabilisation categories is shown in Figure 3.4.

Figure 3.4. Estimated long-term (multi-century) warming corresponding to the six AR4 WG III stabilisation categories (Table 5.1). The temperature scale has
been shifted by -0.5°C compared to Table 5.1 to account approximately for the warming between pre-industrial and 1980-1999. For most stabilisation levels
global average temperature is approaching the equilibrium level over a few centuries. For GHG emissions scenarios that lead to stabilisation at levels
comparable to SRES B1 and A1B by 2100 (600 and 850 ppm CO2-eq; category IV and V), assessed models project that about 65 to 70% of the estimated
global equilibrium temperature increase, assuming a climate sensitivity of 3°C, would be realised at the time of stabilisation. For the much lower stabilisation
scenarios (category I and II, Figure 5.1), the equilibrium temperature may be reached earlier. {WGI 10.7.2}

Impacts of future climate changes
More specific information is now available across a wide
range of systems and sectors concerning the nature of fu-
ture impacts, including some fields not covered in previous
assessments. {WGII TS.4, SPM}
The following is a selection of key findings14  regarding the
impacts of climate change on systems, sectors and regions, as well
as some findings on vulnerability15, for the range of climate changes
projected over the 21st century. Unless otherwise stated, the confi-
dence level in the projections is high. Global average temperature
increases are given relative to 1980-1999. Additional information
on impacts can be found in the WG II report. {WGII SPM}
3.3.1
Impacts on systems and sectors
Ecosystems
�
The resilience of many ecosystems is likely to be exceeded this
century by an unprecedented combination of climate change,
associated disturbances (e.g. flooding, drought, wildfire, insects,
ocean acidification) and other global change drivers (e.g. land-
use change, pollution, fragmentation of natural systems, over-
exploitation of resources). {WGII 4.1-4.6, SPM}
�
Over the course of this century, net carbon uptake by terrestrial
ecosystems is likely to peak before mid-century and then weaken
or even reverse16, thus amplifying climate change. {WGII 4.ES,
Figure 4.2, SPM}
�
Approximately 20 to 30% of plant and animal species assessed
so far are likely to be at increased risk of extinction if increases
in global average temperature exceed 1.5 to 2.5°C (medium con-
fidence). {WGII 4.ES, Figure 4.2, SPM}
�
For increases in global average temperature exceeding 1.5 to
2.5°C and in concomitant atmospheric CO2 concentrations, there
are projected to be major changes in ecosystem structure and
function, species’ ecological interactions and shifts in species’
geographical ranges, with predominantly negative consequences
for biodiversity and ecosystem goods and services, e.g. water
and food supply. {WGII 4.4, Box TS.6, SPM}
Food
�
Crop productivity is projected to increase slightly at mid- to
high latitudes for local mean temperature increases of up to 1
to 3°C depending on the crop, and then decrease beyond that in
some regions (medium confidence). {WGII 5.4, SPM}
�
At lower latitudes, especially in seasonally dry and tropical
regions, crop productivity is projected to decrease for even small
local temperature increases (1 to 2°C), which would increase
the risk of hunger (medium confidence). {WGII 5.4, SPM}
�
Globally, the potential for food production is projected to in-
crease with increases in local average temperature over a range
of 1 to 3°C, but above this it is projected to decrease (medium
confidence). {WGII 5.4, 5.5, SPM}
Coasts
�
Coasts are projected to be exposed to increasing risks, includ-
ing coastal erosion, due to climate change and sea level rise.
The effect will be exacerbated by increasing human-induced
pressures on coastal areas (very high confidence). {WGII 6.3, 6.4,
SPM}
�
By the 2080s, many millions more people than today are pro-
jected to experience floods every year due to sea level rise. The
numbers affected will be largest in the densely populated and
low-lying megadeltas of Asia and Africa while small islands
are especially vulnerable (very high confidence). {WGII 6.4, 6.5,
Table 6.11, SPM}
Industry, settlements and society
�
The most vulnerable industries, settlements and societies are
generally those in coastal and river flood plains, those whose
economies are closely linked with climate-sensitive resources
and those in areas prone to extreme weather events, especially
where rapid urbanisation is occurring. {WGII 7.1, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5,
SPM}
�
Poor communities can be especially vulnerable, in particular
those concentrated in high-risk areas. {WGII 7.2, 7.4, 5.4, SPM}
Health
�
The health status of millions of people is projected to be af-
fected through, for example, increases in malnutrition; increased
deaths, diseases and injury due to extreme weather events; in-
creased burden of diarrhoeal diseases; increased frequency of
cardio-respiratory diseases due to higher concentrations of
ground-level ozone in urban areas related to climate change;
and the altered spatial distribution of some infectious diseases.
{WGI 7.4, Box 7.4; WGII 8.ES, 8.2, 8.4, SPM}
�
Climate change is projected to bring some benefits in temper-
ate areas, such as fewer deaths from cold exposure, and some
mixed effects such as changes in range and transmission poten-
tial of malaria in Africa. Overall it is expected that benefits will
be outweighed by the negative health effects of rising tempera-
tures, especially in developing countries. {WGII 8.4, 8.7, 8ES, SPM}
�
Critically important will be factors that directly shape the health
of populations such as education, health care, public health ini-
tiatives, and infrastructure and economic development. {WGII
8.3, SPM}
Water
�
Water impacts are key for all sectors and regions. These are
discussed below in the Box ‘Climate change and water’.
14 Criteria of choice: magnitude and timing of impact, confidence in the assessment, representative coverage of the system, sector and region.
15 Vulnerability to climate change is the degree to which systems are susceptible to, and unable to cope with, adverse impacts.

Topic 3
Climate change and its impacts in the near and long term under different scenarios
Climate change and water
Climate change is expected to exacerbate current stresses on water resources from population growth and economic and land-use
change, including urbanisation. On a regional scale, mountain snow pack, glaciers and small ice caps play a crucial role in freshwater
availability. Widespread mass losses from glaciers and reductions in snow cover over recent decades are projected to accelerate
throughout the 21st century, reducing water availability, hydropower potential, and changing seasonality of flows in regions supplied by
meltwater from major mountain ranges (e.g. Hindu-Kush, Himalaya, Andes), where more than one-sixth of the world population cur-
rently lives. {WGI 4.1, 4.5; WGII 3.3, 3.4, 3.5}
Changes in precipitation (Figure 3.3) and temperature (Figure 3.2) lead to changes in runoff (Figure 3.5) and water availability.
Runoff is projected with high confidence to increase by 10 to 40% by mid-century at higher latitudes and in some wet tropical areas,
including populous areas in East and South-East Asia, and decrease by 10 to 30% over some dry regions at mid-latitudes and dry
tropics, due to decreases in rainfall and higher rates of evapotranspiration. There is also high confidence that many semi-arid areas
(e.g. the Mediterranean Basin, western United States, southern Africa and north-eastern Brazil) will suffer a decrease in water re-
sources due to climate change. Drought-affected areas are projected to increase in extent, with the potential for adverse impacts on
multiple sectors, e.g. agriculture, water supply, energy production and health. Regionally, large increases in irrigation water demand as
a result of climate changes are projected. {WGI 10.3, 11.2-11.9; WGII 3.4, 3.5, Figure 3.5, TS.4.1, Box TS.5, SPM}
The negative impacts of climate change on freshwater systems outweigh its benefits (high confidence). Areas in which runoff is
projected to decline face a reduction in the value of the services provided by water resources (very high confidence). The beneficial
impacts of increased annual runoff in some areas are likely to be tempered by negative effects of increased precipitation variability and
seasonal runoff shifts on water supply, water quality and flood risk. {WGII 3.4, 3.5, TS.4.1}
Available research suggests a significant future increase in heavy rainfall events in many regions, including some in which the mean
rainfall is projected to decrease. The resulting increased flood risk poses challenges to society, physical infrastructure and water quality.
It is likely that up to 20% of the world population will live in areas where river flood potential could increase by the 2080s. Increases in
the frequency and severity of floods and droughts are projected to adversely affect sustainable development. Increased temperatures
will further affect the physical, chemical and biological properties of freshwater lakes and rivers, with predominantly adverse impacts on
many individual freshwater species, community composition and water quality. In coastal areas, sea level rise will exacerbate water
resource constraints due to increased salinisation of groundwater supplies. {WGI 11.2-11.9; WGII 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 4.4}
Projections and model consistency of relative changes in runoff by the end of the 21st century
Figure 3.5. Large-scale relative changes in annual runoff (water availability, in percent) for the period 2090-2099, relative to 1980-1999. Values
represent the median of 12 climate models using the SRES A1B scenario. White areas are where less than 66% of the 12 models agree on the sign of
change and hatched areas are where more than 90% of models agree on the sign of change. The quality of the simulation of the observed large-scale
20th century runoff is used as a basis for selecting the 12 models from the multi-model ensemble. The global map of annual runoff illustrates a large
scale and is not intended to refer to smaller temporal and spatial scales. In areas where rainfall and runoff is very low (e.g. desert areas), small changes
in runoff can lead to large percentage changes. In some regions, the sign of projected changes in runoff differs from recently observed trends. In some
areas with projected increases in runoff, different seasonal effects are expected, such as increased wet season runoff and decreased dry season
runoff. Studies using results from few climate models can be considerably different from the results presented here. {WGII Figure 3.4, adjusted to match
the assumptions of Figure SYR 3.3; WGII 3.3.1, 3.4.1, 3.5.1}

17 Unless stated explicitly, all entries are from WG II SPM text, and are either very high confidence or high confidence statements, reflecting different sectors
(agriculture, ecosystems, water, coasts, health, industry and settlements). The WG II SPM refers to the source of the statements, timelines and tempera-
tures. The magnitude and timing of impacts that will ultimately be realised will vary with the amount and rate of climate change, emissions scenarios,
development pathways and adaptation.
Studies since the TAR have enabled more systematic un-
derstanding of the timing and magnitude of impacts related
to differing amounts and rates of climate change. {WGII SPM}
Examples of this new information for systems and sectors are
presented in Figure 3.6. The upper panel shows impacts increasing
with increasing temperature change. Their estimated magnitude and
timing is also affected by development pathways (lower panel).
{WGII SPM}
Depending on circumstances, some of the impacts shown in Fig-
ure 3.6 could be associated with ‘key vulnerabilities’, based on a num-
ber of criteria in the literature (magnitude, timing, persistence/
reversibility, the potential for adaptation, distributional aspects, likeli-
hood and ‘importance’ of the impacts) (see Topic 5.2). {WGII SPM}

Impacts on regions17
Africa
�
By 2020, between 75 and 250 million of people are projected
to be exposed to increased water stress due to climate change.
{WGII 9.4, SPM}
�
By 2020, in some countries, yields from rain-fed agriculture
could be reduced by up to 50%. Agricultural production, in-
cluding access to food, in many African countries is projected
to be severely compromised. This would further adversely af-
fect food security and exacerbate malnutrition. {WGII 9.4, SPM}
�
Towards the end of the 21st century, projected sea level rise
will affect low-lying coastal areas with large populations. The
cost of adaptation could amount to at least 5 to 10% of GDP.
{WGII 9.4, SPM}
�
By 2080, an increase of 5 to 8% of arid and semi-arid land in
Africa is projected under a range of climate scenarios (high
confidence). {WGII Box TS.6, 9.4.4}
Asia
�
By the 2050s, freshwater availability in Central, South, East
and South-East Asia, particularly in large river basins, is pro-
jected to decrease. {WGII 10.4, SPM}
�
Coastal areas, especially heavily populated megadelta regions
in South, East and South-East Asia, will be at greatest risk due
to increased flooding from the sea and, in some megadeltas,
flooding from the rivers. {WGII 10.4, SPM}
�
Climate change is projected to compound the pressures on natu-
ral resources and the environment associated with rapid
urbanisation, industrialisation and economic development. {WGII
10.4, SPM}
�
Endemic morbidity and mortality due to diarrhoeal disease pri-
marily associated with floods and droughts are expected to rise
in East, South and South-East Asia due to projected changes in
the hydrological cycle. {WGII 10.4, SPM}
Australia and New Zealand
�
By 2020, significant loss of biodiversity is projected to occur
in some ecologically rich sites, including the Great Barrier Reef
and Queensland Wet Tropics. {WGII 11.4, SPM}
�
By 2030, water security problems are projected to intensify in
southern and eastern Australia and, in New Zealand, in
Northland and some eastern regions. {WGII 11.4, SPM}
�
By 2030, production from agriculture and forestry is projected
to decline over much of southern and eastern Australia, and
over parts of eastern New Zealand, due to increased drought
and fire. However, in New Zealand, initial benefits are pro-
jected in some other regions. {WGII 11.4, SPM}
�
By 2050, ongoing coastal development and population growth
in some areas of Australia and New Zealand are projected to
exacerbate risks from sea level rise and increases in the sever-
ity and frequency of storms and coastal flooding. {WGII 11.4,
SPM}
Europe
�
Climate change is expected to magnify regional differences in
Europe’s natural resources and assets. Negative impacts will
include increased risk of inland flash floods and more frequent
coastal flooding and increased erosion (due to storminess and
sea level rise). {WGII 12.4, SPM}
�
Mountainous areas will face glacier retreat, reduced snow cover
and winter tourism, and extensive species losses (in some areas
up to 60% under high emissions scenarios by 2080). {WGII 12.4,
SPM}
�
In southern Europe, climate change is projected to worsen con-
ditions (high temperatures and drought) in a region already vul-
nerable to climate variability, and to reduce water availability,
hydropower potential, summer tourism and, in general, crop
productivity. {WGII 12.4, SPM}
�
Climate change is also projected to increase the health risks
due to heat waves and the frequency of wildfires. {WGII 12.4,
SPM}
Latin America
�
By mid-century, increases in temperature and associated de-
creases in soil water are projected to lead to gradual replace-
ment of tropical forest by savanna in eastern Amazonia. Semi-
arid vegetation will tend to be replaced by arid-land vegeta-
tion. {WGII 13.4, SPM}
�
There is a risk of significant biodiversity loss through species
extinction in many areas of tropical Latin America. {WGII 13.4,
SPM}
�
Productivity of some important crops is projected to decrease
and livestock productivity to decline, with adverse consequences
for food security. In temperate zones, soybean yields are pro-
jected to increase. Overall, the number of people at risk of hun-
ger is projected to increase (medium confidence). {WGII 13.4,
Box TS.6}
�
Changes in precipitation patterns and the disappearance of gla-
ciers are projected to significantly affect water availability for
human consumption, agriculture and energy generation. {WGII

Climate change and its impacts in the near and long term under different scenarios
52
North America
�
Warming in western mountains is projected to cause decreased
snowpack, more winter flooding and reduced summer flows,
exacerbating competition for over-allocated water resources.
{WGII 14.4, SPM}
�
In the early decades of the century, moderate climate change is
projected to increase aggregate yields of rain-fed agriculture
by 5 to 20%, but with important variability among regions. Ma-
jor challenges are projected for crops that are near the warm
end of their suitable range or which depend on highly utilised
water resources. {WGII 14.4, SPM}
�
Cities that currently experience heat waves are expected to be
further challenged by an increased number, intensity and dura-
tion of heat waves during the course of the century, with poten-
tial for adverse health impacts. {WGII 14.4, SPM}
�
Coastal communities and habitats will be increasingly stressed
by climate change impacts interacting with development and
pollution. {WGII 14.4, SPM}
Polar Regions
�
The main projected biophysical effects are reductions in thick-
ness and extent of glaciers, ice sheets and sea ice, and changes
in natural ecosystems with detrimental effects on many organ-
isms including migratory birds, mammals and higher predators.
{WGII 15.4, SPM}
�
For human communities in the Arctic, impacts, particularly those
resulting from changing snow and ice conditions, are projected
to be mixed. {WGII 15.4, SPM}
�
Detrimental impacts would include those on infrastructure and
traditional indigenous ways of life. {WGII 15.4, SPM}
�
In both polar regions, specific ecosystems and habitats are pro-
jected to be vulnerable, as climatic barriers to species invasions
are lowered. {WGII 15.4, SPM}
Small Islands
�
Sea level rise is expected to exacerbate inundation, storm surge,
erosion and other coastal hazards, thus threatening vital infra-
structure, settlements and facilities that support the livelihood
of island communities. {WGII 16.4, SPM}
�
Deterioration in coastal conditions, for example through ero-
sion of beaches and coral bleaching, is expected to affect local
resources. {WGII 16.4, SPM}
�
By mid-century, climate change is expected to reduce water
resources in many small islands, e.g. in the Caribbean and Pa-
cific, to the point where they become insufficient to meet de-
mand during low-rainfall periods. {WGII 16.4, SPM}
�
With higher temperatures, increased invasion by non-native
species is expected to occur, particularly on mid- and high-lati-
tude islands. {WGII 16.4, SPM}
3.3.3
Especially affected systems, sectors and regions
Some systems, sectors and regions are likely to be espe-
cially affected by climate change.18 {WGII TS.4.5}
Systems and sectors: {WGII TS.4.5}
�
particular ecosystems:
-
terrestrial: tundra, boreal forest and mountain regions be-
cause of sensitivity to warming; mediterranean-type ecosys-
tems because of reduction in rainfall; and tropical rainforests
where precipitation declines
-
coastal: mangroves and salt marshes, due to multiple stresses
-
marine: coral reefs due to multiple stresses; the sea-ice biome
because of sensitivity to warming
�
water resources in some dry regions at mid-latitudes19 and in
the dry tropics, due to changes in rainfall and evapotranspira-
tion, and in areas dependent on snow and ice melt
�
agriculture in low latitudes, due to reduced water availability
�
low-lying coastal systems, due to threat of sea level rise and
increased risk from extreme weather events
�
human health in populations with low adaptive capacity.
Regions: {WGII TS.4.5}
�
the Arctic, because of the impacts of high rates of projected
warming on natural systems and human communities
�
Africa, because of low adaptive capacity and projected climate
change impacts
�
small islands, where there is high exposure of population and
infrastructure to projected climate change impacts
�
Asian and African megadeltas, due to large populations and
high exposure to sea level rise, storm surges and river flooding.
Within other areas, even those with high incomes, some people
(such as the poor, young children and the elderly) can be particu-
larly at risk, and also some areas and some activities. {WGII 7.1, 7.2,
7.4, 8.2, 8.4, TS.4.5}
3.3.4
Ocean acidification
The uptake of anthropogenic carbon since 1750 has led to the
ocean becoming more acidic with an average decrease in pH of 0.1
units. Increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations lead to further
acidification. Projections based on SRES scenarios give a reduc-
tion in average global surface ocean pH of between 0.14 and 0.35
units over the 21st century. While the effects of observed ocean acidi-
fication on the marine biosphere are as yet undocumented, the pro-
gressive acidification of oceans is expected to have negative im-
pacts on marine shell-forming organisms (e.g. corals) and their de-
pendent species. {WGI SPM; WGII SPM}
3.3.5
Extreme events
Altered frequencies and intensities of extreme weather, to-
gether with sea level rise, are expected to have mostly adverse
effects on natural and human systems (Table 3.2). {WGII SPM}
Examples for selected extremes and sectors are shown in Table 3.2.

Risk of abrupt or irreversible changes
Anthropogenic warming could lead to some impacts that
are abrupt or irreversible, depending upon the rate and
magnitude of the climate change. {WGII 12.6, 19.3, 19.4, SPM}
Abrupt climate change on decadal time scales is normally
thought of as involving ocean circulation changes. In addition on
longer time scales, ice sheet and ecosystem changes may also play
a role. If a large-scale abrupt climate change were to occur, its im-
pact could be quite high (see Topic 5.2). {WGI 8.7, 10.3, 10.7; WGII
4.4, 19.3}
Partial loss of ice sheets on polar land and/or the thermal ex-
pansion of seawater over very long time scales could imply metres
of sea level rise, major changes in coastlines and inundation of
low-lying areas, with greatest effects in river deltas and low-lying
Topic 3

54
islands. Current models project that such changes would occur over
very long time scales (millennial) if a global temperature increase
of 1.9 to 4.6°C (relative to pre-industrial) were to be sustained.
Rapid sea level rise on century time scales cannot be excluded.
{SYR 3.2.3; WGI 6.4, 10.7; WGII 19.3, SPM}
Climate change is likely to lead to some irreversible impacts.
There is medium confidence that approximately 20 to 30% of spe-
cies assessed so far are likely to be at increased risk of extinction if
increases in global average warming exceed 1.5 to 2.5°C (relative
to 1980-1999). As global average temperature increase exceeds
about 3.5°C, model projections suggest significant extinctions (40
to 70% of species assessed) around the globe. {WGII 4.4, Figure SPM.2}
Based on current model simulations, it is very likely that the
meridional overturning circulation (MOC) of the Atlantic Ocean
will slow down during the 21st century; nevertheless temperatures
in the region are projected to increase. It is very unlikely that the
MOC will undergo a large abrupt transition during the 21stcentury.
Longer-term changes in the MOC cannot be assessed with confi-
dence. {WGI 10.3, 10.7; WGII Figure, Table TS.5, SPM.2}
Impacts of large-scale and persistent changes in the MOC are
likely to include changes in marine ecosystem productivity, fisher-
ies, ocean CO2 uptake, oceanic oxygen concentrations and terres-
trial vegetation. Changes in terrestrial and ocean CO2 uptake may
feed back on the climate system. {WGII 12.6, 19.3, Figure SPM.2}

Adaptation and mitigation options and responses,
and the inter-relationship with sustainable
development, at global and regional levels
Topic 4
Adaptation and mitigation options and responses, and the inter-relationship with sustainable development, at global and regional levels
56
4.1 Responding to climate change
Societies can respond to climate change by adapting to its impacts
and by reducing GHG emissions (mitigation), thereby reducing the
rate and magnitude of change. This Topic focuses on adaptation and
mitigation options that can be implemented over the next two to three
decades, and their inter-relationship with sustainable development.
These responses can be complementary. Topic 5 addresses their comple-
mentary roles on a more conceptual basis over a longer timeframe.
The capacity to adapt and mitigate is dependent on socio-eco-
nomic and environmental circumstances and the availability of in-
formation and technology20 . However, much less information is
available about the costs and effectiveness of adaptation measures
than about mitigation measures. {WGII 17.1, 17.3; WGIII 1.2}
4.2 Adaptation options
Adaptation can reduce vulnerability, both in the short and
the long term. {WGII 17.2, 18.1, 18.5, 20.3, 20.8}
Vulnerability to climate change can be exacerbated by other
stresses. These arise from, for example, current climate hazards,
poverty, unequal access to resources, food insecurity, trends in eco-
nomic globalisation, conflict and incidence of diseases such as HIV/
AIDS. {WGII 7.2, 7.4, 8.3, 17.3, 20.3, 20.4, 20.7, SPM}
Societies across the world have a long record of adapting and
reducing their vulnerability to the impacts of weather- and climate-
related events such as floods, droughts and storms. Nevertheless,
additional adaptation measures will be required at regional and lo-
cal levels to reduce the adverse impacts of projected climate change
and variability, regardless of the scale of mitigation undertaken over
the next two to three decades.  However, adaptation alone is not
expected to cope with all the projected effects of climate change,
especially not over the long term as most impacts increase in mag-
nitude. {WGII 17.2, SPM; WGIII 1.2}
A wide array of adaptation options is available, but more ex-
tensive adaptation than is currently occurring is required to reduce
vulnerability to climate change. There are barriers, limits and costs,
which are not fully understood. Some planned adaptation is already
occurring on a limited basis. Table 4.1 provides examples of planned
20 Technology is defined as the practical application of knowledge to achieve particular tasks that employs both technical artefacts (hardware, equipment)
and (social) information (‘software’, know-how for production and use of artefacts).
adaptation options by sector. Many adaptation actions have mul-
tiple drivers, such as economic development and poverty allevia-
tion, and are embedded within broader development, sectoral, re-
gional and local planning initiatives such as water resources plan-
ning, coastal defence and disaster risk reduction strategies.  Ex-
amples of this approach are the Bangladesh National Water Man-
agement Plan and the coastal defence plans of The Netherlands
and Norway, which incorporate specific climate change scenarios.
{WGII 1.3, 5.5.2, 11.6, 17.2}
Comprehensive estimates of the costs and benefits of adapta-
tion at the global level are limited in number. However, the number
of adaptation cost and benefit estimates at the regional and project
levels for impacts on specific sectors, such as agriculture, energy
demand for heating and cooling, water resources management and
infrastructure, is growing. Based on these studies there is high con-
fidence that there are viable adaptation options that can be imple-
mented in some of these sectors at low cost and/or with high ben-
efit-cost ratios. Empirical research also suggests that higher ben-
efit-cost ratios can be achieved by implementing some adaptation
measures at an early stage compared to retrofitting long-lived in-
frastructure at a later date. {WGII 17.2}
Adaptive capacity is intimately connected to social and eco-
nomic development, but it is not evenly distributed across
and within societies. {WGII 7.1, 7.2, 7.4, 17.3}
The capacity to adapt is dynamic and is influenced by a society’s
productive base, including natural and man-made capital assets,
social networks and entitlements, human capital and institutions,
governance, national income, health and technology. It is also af-
fected by multiple climate and non-climate stresses, as well as de-
velopment policy. {WGII 17.3}
Recent studies reaffirm the TAR finding that adaptation will be
vital and beneficial. However, financial, technological, cognitive,
behavioural, political, social, institutional and cultural constraints limit
both the implementation and effectiveness of adaptation measures.
Even societies with high adaptive capacity remain vulnerable to cli-
mate change, variability and extremes. For example, a heat wave in
2003 caused high levels of mortality in European cities (especially
among the elderly), and Hurricane Katrina in 2005 caused large hu-
man and financial costs in the United States. {WGII 7.4, 8.2, 17.4}

4.3 Mitigation options
Both bottom-up and top-down studies21 indicate that there
is high agreement and much evidence of substantial eco-
nomic potential21 for the mitigation of global GHG emissions
over the coming decades that could offset the projected
growth of global emissions or reduce emissions below cur-
rent levels. {WGIII 11.3, SPM}
Figure 4.1 compares global economic mitigation potential in
2030 with the projected emissions increase from 2000 to 2030.
Bottom-up studies suggest that mitigation opportunities with net
negative costs22 have the potential to reduce emissions by about 6
GtCO2-eq/yr in 2030. Realising these requires dealing with imple-
mentation barriers. The economic mitigation potential, which is
generally greater than the market mitigation potential, can only be
achieved when adequate policies are in place and barriers removed.21
{WGIII 11.3, SPM}
Sectoral estimates of economic mitigation potential and mar-
ginal costs derived from bottom-up studies corrected for double
counting of mitigation potential are shown in Figure 4.2. While
top-down and bottom-up studies are in line at the global level, there
are considerable differences at the sectoral level. {WGIII 11.3, SPM}
No single technology can provide all of the mitigation
potential in any sector. Table 4.2 lists selected examples of key tech-
nologies, policies, constraints and opportunities by sector. {WGIII SPM}
Future energy infrastructure investment decisions, expected to
total over US$20 trillion23  between 2005 and 2030, will have long-
term impacts on GHG emissions, because of the long lifetimes of
energy plants and other infrastructure capital stock. The widespread
diffusion of low-carbon technologies may take many decades, even
if early investments in these technologies are made attractive. Ini-
tial estimates show that returning global energy-related CO2 emis-
sions to 2005 levels by 2030 would require a large shift in the pat-
tern of investment, although the net additional investment required
ranges from negligible to 5 to 10%. {WGIII 4.1, 4.4, 11.6, SPM}
21 The concept of ‘mitigation potential’ has been developed to assess the scale of GHG reductions that could be made, relative to emission baselines, for
a given level of carbon price (expressed in cost per unit of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions avoided or reduced). Mitigation potential is further differen-
tiated in terms of ‘market mitigation potential’ and ‘economic mitigation potential’.
Market mitigation potential is the mitigation potential based on private costs and private discount rates (reflecting the perspective of private consumers
and companies ), which might be expected to occur under forecast market conditions, including policies and measures currently in place, noting that
barriers limit actual uptake.
Economic mitigation potential is the mitigation potential that takes into account social costs and benefits and social discount rates (reflecting the
perspective of society; social discount rates are lower than those used by private investors ), assuming that market efficiency is improved by policies and
measures and barriers are removed.
Mitigation potential is estimated using different types of approaches. Bottom-up studies are based on assessment of mitigation options, emphasising
specific technologies and regulations. They are typically sectoral studies taking the macro-economy as unchanged. Top-down studies assess the
economy-wide potential of mitigation options. They use globally consistent frameworks and aggregated information about mitigation options and capture
macro-economic and market feedbacks.
22 Net negative costs (no regrets opportunities) are defined as those options whose benefits such as reduced energy costs and reduced emissions of local/
regional pollutants equal or exceed their costs to society, excluding the benefits of avoided climate change.
23 20 trillion = 20,000 billion = 20×1012
Comparison between global economic mitigation potential and projected emissions increase in 2030
Figure 4.1. Global economic mitigation potential in 2030 estimated from bottom-up (Panel a) and top-down (Panel b) studies, compared with the projected
emissions increases from SRES scenarios relative to year 2000 GHG emissions of 40.8 GtCO2-eq (Panel c). Note: GHG emissions in 2000 are exclusive of
emissions of decay of above-ground biomass that remains after logging and deforestation and from peat fires and drained peat soils, to ensure consistency
with the SRES emissions results. {WGIII Figures SPM.4, SPM.5a, SPM.5b}

Economic mitigation potentials by sector in 2030 estimated from bottom-up studies
Figure 4.2. Estimated economic mitigation potential by sector and region using technologies and practices expected to be available in 2030. The potentials
do not include non-technical options such as lifestyle changes. {WGIII Figure SPM.6}
Notes:
a) The ranges for global economic potentials as assessed in each sector are shown by vertical lines. The ranges are based on end-use allocations of
emissions, meaning that emissions of electricity use are counted towards the end-use sectors and not to the energy supply sector.
b) The estimated potentials have been constrained by the availability of studies particularly at high carbon price levels.
c) Sectors used different baselines. For industry the SRES B2 baseline was taken, for energy supply and transport the World Energy Outlook (WEO) 2004
baseline was used; the building sector is based on a baseline in between SRES B2 and A1B; for waste, SRES A1B driving forces were used to construct
a waste-specific baseline; agriculture and forestry used baselines that mostly used B2 driving forces.
d) Only global totals for transport are shown because international aviation is included.
e) Categories excluded are non-CO2 emissions in buildings and transport, part of material efficiency options, heat production and cogeneration in energy
supply, heavy duty vehicles, shipping and high-occupancy passenger transport, most high-cost options for buildings, wastewater treatment, emission
reduction from coal mines and gas pipelines, and fluorinated gases from energy supply and transport. The underestimation of the total economic potential
from these emissions is of the order of 10 to 15%.

While studies use different methodologies, there is high
agreement and much evidence that in all analysed world
regions near-term health co-benefits from reduced air pol-
lution, as a result of actions to reduce GHG emissions, can
be substantial and may offset a substantial fraction of miti-
gation costs. {WGIII 11.8, SPM}
Energy efficiency and utilisation of renewable energy offer syn-
ergies with sustainable development. In least developed countries,
energy substitution can lower mortality and morbidity by reducing
indoor air pollution, reduce the workload for women and children
and decrease the unsustainable use of fuelwood and related defor-
estation. {WGIII 11.8, 11.9, 12.4}
Literature since the TAR confirms with high agreement and
medium evidence that there may be effects from Annex I
countries’ action on the global economy and global emis-
sions, although the scale of carbon leakage remains uncer-
tain. {WGIII 11.7, SPM}
Fossil fuel exporting nations (in both Annex I and non-Annex I
countries) may expect, as indicated in the TAR, lower demand and
prices and lower GDP growth due to mitigation policies. The ex-
tent of this spillover depends strongly on assumptions related to
policy decisions and oil market conditions. {WGIII 11.7, SPM}
Critical uncertainties remain in the assessment of carbon leak-
age. Most equilibrium modelling supports the conclusion in the
TAR of economy-wide leakage from Kyoto action in the order of 5
to 20%, which would be less if competitive low-emissions tech-
nologies were effectively diffused. {WGIII 11.7, SPM}
There is also high agreement and medium evidence that
changes in lifestyle and behaviour patterns can contribute
to climate change mitigation across all sectors. Manage-
ment practices can also have a positive role. {WGIII SPM}
Examples that can have positive impacts on mitigation include
changes in consumption patterns, education and training, changes
in building occupant behaviour, transport demand management and
management tools in industry. {WGIII 4.1, 5.1, 6.7, 7.3, SPM}
Policies that provide a real or implicit price of carbon could
create incentives for producers and consumers to signifi-
cantly invest in low-GHG products, technologies and pro-
cesses. {WGIII SPM}
An effective carbon-price signal could realise significant miti-
gation potential in all sectors. Modelling studies show that global
carbon prices rising to US$20-80/tCO2-eq by 2030 are consistent
with stabilisation at around 550ppm CO2-eq by 2100. For the same

Adaptation and mitigation options and responses, and the inter-relationship with sustainable development, at global and regional levels
stabilisation level, studies since the TAR that take into account in-
duced technological change may lower these price ranges to US$5-
65/tCO2-eq in 2030.24  {WGIII 3.3, 11.4, 11.5, SPM}
There is high agreement and much evidence that a wide
variety of national policies and instruments are available to
governments to create the incentives for mitigation action.
Their applicability depends on national circumstances and
an understanding of their interactions, but experience from
implementation in various countries and sectors shows
there are advantages and disadvantages for any given in-
strument. {WGIII 13.2, SPM}
Four main criteria are used to evaluate policies and instruments:
environmental effectiveness, cost effectiveness, distributional
effects including equity, and institutional feasibility. {WGIII 13.2, SPM}
General findings about the performance of policies are: {WGIII
13.2, SPM}
�
Integrating climate policies in broader development policies
makes implementation and overcoming barriers easier.
�
Regulations and standards generally provide some certainty
about emission levels. They may be preferable to other instru-
ments when information or other barriers prevent producers and
consumers from responding to price signals. However, they may
not induce innovations and more advanced technologies.
�
Taxes and charges can set a price for carbon, but cannot guar-
antee a particular level of emissions. Literature identifies taxes
as an efficient way of internalising costs of GHG emissions.
�
Tradable permits will establish a carbon price. The volume of
allowed emissions determines their environmental effectiveness,
while the allocation of permits has distributional consequences.
Fluctuation in the price of carbon makes it difficult to estimate
the total cost of complying with emission permits.
�
Financial incentives (subsidies and tax credits) are frequently
used by governments to stimulate the development and diffu-
sion of new technologies.  While economic costs are generally
higher than for the instruments listed above, they are often criti-
cal to overcome barriers.
�
Voluntary agreements between industry and governments are
politically attractive, raise awareness among stakeholders and
have played a role in the evolution of many national policies.
The majority of agreements have not achieved significant emis-
sions reductions beyond business as usual. However, some re-
cent agreements, in a few countries, have accelerated the appli-
cation of best available technology and led to measurable emis-
sion reductions.
�
Information instruments (e.g. awareness campaigns) may posi-
tively affect environmental quality by promoting informed
choices and possibly contributing to behavioural change, how-
ever, their impact on emissions has not been measured yet.
�
Research, development and demonstration (RD&D) can stimu-
late technological advances, reduce costs and enable progress
toward stabilisation.
Some corporations, local and regional authorities, NGOs and
civil groups are adopting a wide variety of voluntary actions. These
voluntary actions may limit GHG emissions, stimulate innovative
policies and encourage the deployment of new technologies. On
their own, they generally have limited impact on national- or re-
gional-level emissions. {WGIII 13.4, SPM}
4.4 Relationship between adaptation and
mitigation options and relationship with
sustainable development
There is growing understanding of the possibilities to
choose and implement climate response options in several
sectors to realise synergies and avoid conflicts with other
dimensions of sustainable development. {WGIII SPM}
Climate change policies related to energy efficiency and renew-
able energy are often economically beneficial, improve energy se-
curity and reduce local pollutant emissions. Reducing both loss of
natural habitat and deforestation can have significant biodiversity,
soil and water conservation benefits, and can be implemented in a
socially and economically sustainable manner. Forestation and
bioenergy plantations can restore degraded land, manage water run-
off, retain soil carbon and benefit rural economies, but could com-
pete with food production and may be negative for biodiversity, if
not properly designed. {WGII 20.3, 20.8; WGIII 4.5, 9.7, 12.3, SPM}
There is growing evidence that decisions about macro-economic
policy, agricultural policy, multilateral development bank lending,
insurance practices, electricity market reform, energy security and
forest conservation, for example, which are often treated as being
apart from climate policy, can significantly reduce emissions (Table
4.3). Similarly, non-climate policies can affect adaptive capacity
and vulnerability. {WGII 20.3; WGIII SPM, 12.3}
Both synergies and trade-offs exist between adaptation and
mitigation options. {WGII 18.4.3; WGIII 11.9)
Examples of synergies include properly designed biomass pro-
duction, formation of protected areas, land management, energy
use in buildings, and forestry, but synergies are rather limited in
other sectors. Potential trade-offs include increased GHG emissions
due to increased consumption of energy related to adaptive re-
sponses. {WGII 18.4.3, 18.5, 18.7, TS.5.2; WGIII 4.5, 6.9, 8.5, 9.5, SPM}
24 Studies on mitigation portfolios and macro-economic costs assessed in this report are based on top-down modelling. Most models use a global least-cost
approach to mitigation portfolios, with universal emissions trading, assuming transparent markets, no transaction cost, and thus perfect implementation of
mitigation measures throughout the 21st century. Costs are given for a specific point in time. Global modelled costs will increase if some regions, sectors (e.g.
land use), options or gases are excluded. Global modelled costs will decrease with lower baselines, use of revenues from carbon taxes and auctioned
permits, and if induced technological learning is included. These models do not consider climate benefits and generally also co-benefits of mitigation
measures, or equity issues. Significant progress has been achieved in applying approaches based on induced technological change to stabilisation studies;
however, conceptual issues remain. In the models that consider induced technological change, projected costs for a given stabilisation level are reduced; the
reductions are greater at lower stabilisation level.

4.5 International and regional cooperation
There is high agreement and much evidence that notable
achievements of the UNFCCC and its Kyoto Protocol are
the establishment of a global response to the climate change
problem, stimulation of an array of national policies, the
creation of an international carbon market and the estab-
lishment of new institutional mechanisms that may provide
the foundation for future mitigation efforts. Progress has
also been made in addressing adaptation within the UNFCCC
and additional initiatives have been suggested. {WGII 18.7;
WGIII 13.3, SPM}
The impact of the Protocol’s first commitment period relative
to global emissions is projected to be limited. Its economic impacts
on participating Annex-B countries are projected to be smaller than
presented in the TAR, which showed 0.2 to 2% lower GDP in 2012
without emissions trading and 0.1 to 1.1% lower GDP with emis-
sions trading among Annex-B countries. To be more environmen-
tally effective, future mitigation efforts would need to achieve deeper
reductions covering a higher share of global emissions (see Topic
5). {WGIII 1.4, 11.4, 13.3, SPM}
The literature provides high agreement and much evidence
of many options for achieving reductions of global GHG
emissions at the international level through cooperation. It
also suggests that successful agreements are environmen-
tally effective, cost-effective, incorporate distributional con-
siderations and equity, and are institutionally feasible. {WGIII
13.3, SPM}
Greater cooperative efforts to reduce emissions will help to re-
duce global costs for achieving a given level of mitigation, or will
improve environmental effectiveness. Improving and expanding the
scope of market mechanisms (such as emission trading, Joint Imple-
mentation and Clean Development Mechanism) could reduce overall
mitigation costs. {WGIII 13.3, SPM}
Efforts to address climate change can include diverse elements
such as emissions targets; sectoral, local, sub-national and regional
actions; RD&D programmes; adopting common policies; imple-
menting development-oriented actions; or expanding financing in-
struments. These elements can be implemented in an integrated
fashion, but comparing the efforts made by different countries
quantitatively would be complex and resource intensive. {WGIII 13.3,
SPM}
Actions that could be taken by participating countries can be
differentiated both in terms of when such action is undertaken, who
participates and what the action will be. Actions can be binding or
non-binding, include fixed or dynamic targets, and participation
can be static or vary over time. {WGIII 13.3, SPM}

5.1 Risk management perspective
Responding to climate change involves an iterative risk
management process that includes both mitigation and ad-
aptation, taking into account actual and avoided climate
change damages, co-benefits, sustainability, equity and at-
titudes to risk. {WGII 20. 9, SPM; WGIII SPM}
Risk management techniques can explicitly accommodate sectoral,
regional and temporal diversity, but their application requires informa-
tion about not only impacts resulting from the most likely climate sce-
narios, but also impacts arising from lower-probability but higher-con-
sequence events and the consequences of proposed policies and mea-
sures. Risk is generally understood to be the product of the likelihood
of an event and its consequences. Climate change impacts depend on
the characteristics of natural and human systems, their development
pathways and their specific locations. {SYR 3.3, Figure 3.6; WGII 20.2,
20.9, SPM; WGIII 3.5, 3.6, SPM}
5.2 Key vulnerabilities, impacts and risks –
long-term perspectives
The five ‘reasons for concern’ identified in the TAR are now
assessed to be stronger with many risks identified with
higher confidence. Some are projected to be larger or to
occur at lower increases in temperature. This is due to (1)
better understanding of the magnitude of impacts and risks
associated with increases in global average temperature and
GHG concentrations, including vulnerability to present-day
climate variability, (2) more precise identification of the cir-
cumstances that make systems, sectors, groups and regions
especially vulnerable and (3) growing evidence that the risk
of very large impacts on multiple century time scales would
continue to increase as long as GHG concentrations and
temperature continue to increase. Understanding about the
relationship between impacts (the basis for ‘reasons for con-
cern’ in the TAR) and vulnerability (that includes the ability
to adapt to impacts) has improved. {WGII 4.4, 5.4, 19.ES, 19.3.7,
TS.4.6; WGIII 3.5, SPM}
The TAR concluded that vulnerability to climate change is a func-
tion of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. Adaptation can re-
duce sensitivity to climate change while mitigation can  reduce the
exposure to climate change, including its rate and extent. Both conclu-
sions are confirmed in this assessment. {WGII 20.2, 20.7.3}
No single metric can adequately describe the diversity of key
vulnerabilities or support their ranking. A sample of relevant im-
pacts is provided in Figure 3.6. The estimation of key vulnerabili-
ties in any system, and damage implied, will depend on exposure
(the rate and magnitude of climate change), sensitivity, which is
determined in part and where relevant by development status, and
adaptive capacity. Some key vulnerabilities may be linked to thresh-
olds; in some cases these may cause a system to shift from one state
to another, whereas others have thresholds that are defined subjec-
tively and thus depend on societal values. {WGII 19.ES, 19.1}
The five ‘reasons for concern’ that were identified in the TAR
were intended to synthesise information on climate risks and key
vulnerabilities and to “aid readers in making their own determina-
tion” about risk. These remain a viable framework to consider key
vulnerabilities, and they have been updated in the AR4. {TAR WGII
Chapter 19; WGII SPM}
�
Risks to unique and threatened systems.  There is new and
stronger evidence of observed impacts of climate change on
unique and vulnerable systems (such as polar and high moun-
tain communities and ecosystems), with increasing levels of
adverse impacts as temperatures increase further. An increas-
ing risk of species extinction and coral reef damage is projected
with higher confidence than in the TAR as warming proceeds.
There is medium confidence that approximately 20 to 30% of
plant and animal species assessed so far are likely to be at in-
creased risk of extinction if increases in global average tem-
perature exceed 1.5 to 2.5°C over 1980-1999 levels. Confidence
has increased that a 1 to 2°C increase in global mean tempera-
ture above 1990 levels (about 1.5 to 2.5°C above pre-indus-
25 Key Vulnerabilities can be identified based on a number of criteria in the literature, including magnitude, timing, persistence/reversibility, the
potential for adaptation, distributional aspects, likelihood and ‘importance’ of the impacts.
Key Vulnerabilities and Article 2 of the UNFCCC
Article 2 of the UNFCCC states:
“The ultimate objective of this Convention and any related legal instruments that the Conference of the Parties may adopt is to
achieve, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Convention, stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmo-
sphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Such a level should be achieved
within a time frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened
and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner.”
Determining what constitutes “dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system” in relation to Article 2 of the UNFCCC
involves value judgements. Science can support informed decisions on this issue, including by providing criteria for judging which
vulnerabilities might be labelled ‘key’. {SYR 3.3, WGII 19.ES}
Key vulnerabilities25  may be associated with many climate-sensitive systems, including food supply, infrastructure, health, water
resources, coastal systems, ecosystems, global biogeochemical cycles, ice sheets and modes of oceanic and atmospheric circulation.
{WGII 19.ES}
More specific information is now available across the regions of the world concerning the nature of future impacts, including for some
places not covered in previous assessments. {WGII SPM}

The long-term perspective
trial) poses significant risks to many unique and threatened sys-
tems including many biodiversity hotspots. Corals are vulner-
able to thermal stress and have low adaptive capacity. Increases
in sea surface temperature of about 1 to 3°C are projected to
result in more frequent coral bleaching events and widespread
mortality, unless there is thermal adaptation or acclimatisation
by corals. Increasing vulnerability of Arctic indigenous com-
munities and small island communities to warming is projected.
{SYR 3.3, 3.4, Figure 3.6, Table 3.2; WGII 4.ES, 4.4, 6.4, 14.4.6, 15.ES,

�
Risks of extreme weather events.  Responses to some recent
extreme climate events reveal higher levels of vulnerability in
both developing and developed countries than was assessed in
the TAR. There is now higher confidence in the projected in-
creases in droughts, heat waves and floods, as well as their ad-
verse impacts. As summarised in Table 3.2, increases in drought,
heat waves and floods are projected in many regions and would
have mostly adverse impacts, including increased water stress
and wild fire frequency, adverse effects on food production,
adverse health effects, increased flood risk and extreme high
sea level, and damage to infrastructure. {SYR 3.2, 3.3, Table 3.2;
WGI 10.3, Table SPM.2; WGII 1.3, 5.4, 7.1, 7.5, 8.2, 12.6, 19.3, Table
19.1, Table SPM.1}
�
Distribution of impacts and vulnerabilities.  There are sharp
differences across regions and those in the weakest economic
position are often the most vulnerable to climate change and
are frequently the most susceptible to climate-related damages,
especially when they face multiple stresses. There is increasing
evidence of greater vulnerability of specific groups such as the
poor and elderly not only in developing but also in developed
countries. There is greater confidence in the projected regional
patterns of climate change (see Topic 3.2) and in the projec-
tions of regional impacts, enabling better identification of par-
ticularly vulnerable systems, sectors and regions (see Topic 3.3).
Moreover, there is increased evidence that low-latitude and less-
developed areas generally face greater risk, for example in dry
areas and megadeltas. New studies confirm that Africa is one
of the most vulnerable continents because of the range of pro-
jected impacts, multiple stresses and low adaptive capacity.
Substantial risks due to sea level rise are projected particularly
for Asian megadeltas and for small island communities. {SYR

�
Aggregate impacts.  Compared to the TAR, initial net market-
based benefits from climate change are projected to peak at a
lower magnitude and therefore sooner than was assessed in the
TAR. It is likely that there will be higher damages for larger
magnitudes of global temperature increase than estimated in
the TAR, and the net costs of impacts of increased warming are
projected to increase over time. Aggregate impacts have also
been quantified in other metrics (see Topic 3.3): for example,
climate change over the next century is likely to adversely af-
fect hundreds of millions of people through increased coastal
flooding, reductions in water supplies, increased malnutrition
and increased health impacts. {SYR 3.3, Figure 3.6; WGII 19.3.7,
20.7.3, TS.5.3}
�
Risks of large-scale singularities.26   As discussed in Topic 3.4,
during the current century, a large-scale abrupt change in the
meridional overturning circulation is very unlikely. There is high
confidence that global warming over many centuries would lead
to a sea level rise contribution from thermal expansion alone
that is projected to be much larger than observed over the 20th
century, with loss of coastal area and associated impacts. There
is better understanding than in the TAR that the risk of addi-
tional contributions to sea level rise from both the Greenland
and possibly Antarctic ice sheets may be larger than projected
by ice sheet models and could occur on century time scales.
This is because ice dynamical processes seen in recent obser-
vations but not fully included in ice sheet models assessed in
the AR4 could increase the rate of ice loss. Complete
deglaciation of the Greenland ice sheet would raise sea level
by 7m and could be irreversible. {SYR 3.4; WGI 10.3, Box 10.1;
WGII 19.3.7, SPM}
5.3 Adaptation and mitigation
There is high confidence that neither adaptation nor mitiga-
tion alone can avoid all climate change impacts. Adaptation
is necessary both in the short term and longer term to ad-
dress impacts resulting from the warming that would occur
even for the lowest stabilisation scenarios assessed. There
are barriers, limits and costs that are not fully understood.
Adaptation and mitigation can complement each other and
together can significantly reduce the risks of climate change.
{WGII 4.ES, TS 5.1, 18.4, 18.6, 20.7, SPM; WGIII 1.2, 2.5, 3.5, 3.6}
Adaptation will be ineffective for some cases such as natural
ecosystems (e.g. loss of Arctic sea ice and marine ecosystem vi-
ability), the disappearance of mountain glaciers that play vital roles
in water storage and supply, or adaptation to sea level rise of sev-
eral metres27. It will be less feasible or very costly in many cases for
the projected climate change beyond the next several decades (such
as deltaic regions and estuaries). There is high confidence that the
ability of many ecosystems to adapt naturally will be exceeded this
century. In addition, multiple barriers and constraints to effective
adaptation exist in human systems (see Topic 4.2). {SYR 4.2; WGII
17.4.2, 19.2, 19.4.1}
Unmitigated climate change would, in the long term, be likely
to exceed the capacity of natural, managed and human systems to
adapt. Reliance on adaptation alone could eventually lead to a mag-
nitude of climate change to which effective adaptation is not pos-
sible, or will only be available at very high social, environmental
and economic costs. {WGII 18.1, SPM}
26 See glossary
27 While it is technically possible to adapt to several metres of sea level rise, the resources required are so unevenly distributed that in reality this risk is
outside the scope of adaptation. {WGII 17.4.2, 19.4.1}

The long-term perspective

28 Peaking means that the emissions need to reach a maximum before they decline later.
29 For the lowest mitigation scenario category assessed, emissions would need to peak by 2015 and for the highest by 2090 (see Table 5.1). Scenarios that
use alternative emission pathways show substantial differences on the rate of global climate change. {WGII 19.4}
Efforts to mitigate GHG emissions to reduce the rate and
magnitude of climate change need to account for inertia in
the climate and socio-economic systems. {SYR 3.2; WGI 10.3,
10.4, 10.7, SPM; WGIII 2.3.4}
After GHG concentrations are stabilised, the rate at which the
global average temperature increases is expected to slow within a
few decades. Small increases in global average temperature could
still be expected for several centuries. Sea level rise from thermal
expansion would continue for many centuries at a rate that eventu-
ally decreases from that reached before stabilisation, due to ongo-
ing heat uptake by oceans. {SYR 3.2, WGI 10.3, 10.4, 10.7, SPM}
Delayed emission reductions significantly constrain the oppor-
tunities to achieve lower stabilisation levels and increase the risk
of more severe climate change impacts. Even though benefits of
mitigation measures in terms of avoided climate change would take
several decades to materialise, mitigation actions begun in the short
term would avoid locking in both long-lived carbon intensive in-
frastructure and development pathways, reduce the rate of climate
change and reduce the adaptation needs associated with higher lev-
els of warming. {WGII 18.4, 20.6, 20.7, SPM; WGIII 2.3.4, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6,
SPM}
5.4 Emission trajectories for stabilisation
In order to stabilise the concentration of GHGs in the atmo-
sphere, emissions would need to peak and decline thereaf-
ter.28 The lower the stabilisation level, the more quickly this
peak and decline would need to occur (Figure 5.1).29  {WGIII
3.3, 3.5, SPM}
Advances in modelling since the TAR permit the assessment of
multi-gas mitigation strategies for exploring the attainability and
costs for achieving stabilisation of GHG concentrations. These
scenarios explore a wider range of future scenarios, including
lower levels of stabilisation, than reported in the TAR. {WGIII 3.3,
3.5, SPM}
Mitigation efforts over the next two to three decades will
have a large impact on opportunities to achieve lower
stabilisation levels (Table 5.1 and Figure 5.1). {WGIII 3.5,
SPM}
Table 5.1 summarises the required emission levels for different
groups of stabilisation concentrations and the resulting equilibrium
CO2 emissions and equilibrium temperature increases for a range of stabilisation levels
Figure 5.1. Global CO2 emissions for 1940 to 2000 and emissions ranges for categories of stabilisation scenarios from 2000 to 2100 (left-hand panel); and
the corresponding relationship between the stabilisation target and the likely equilibrium global average temperature increase above pre-industrial (right-
hand panel). Approaching equilibrium can take several centuries, especially for scenarios with higher levels of stabilisation. Coloured shadings show
stabilisation scenarios grouped according to different targets (stabilisation category I to VI). The right-hand panel shows ranges of global average tempera-
ture change above pre-industrial, using (i) ‘best estimate’ climate sensitivity of 3°C (black line in middle of shaded area), (ii) upper bound of likely range of
climate sensitivity of 4.5°C (red line at top of shaded area) (iii) lower bound of likely range of climate sensitivity of 2°C (blue line at bottom of shaded area).
Black dashed lines in the left panel give the emissions range of recent baseline scenarios published since the SRES (2000). Emissions ranges of the
stabilisation scenarios comprise CO2-only and multigas scenarios and correspond to the 10th to 90th percentile of the full scenario distribution. Note: CO2
emissions in most models do not include emissions from decay of above ground biomass that remains after logging and deforestation, and from peat fires
and drained peat soils. {WGIII Figures SPM.7 and SPM.8}

Notes:
a) The emission reductions to meet a particular stabilisation level reported in the mitigation studies assessed here might be underestimated due to
missing carbon cycle feedbacks (see also Topic 2.3).
b) Atmospheric CO2 concentrations were 379ppm in 2005. The best estimate of total CO2-eq concentration in 2005 for all long-lived GHGs is about
455ppm, while the corresponding value including the net effect of all anthropogenic forcing agents is 375ppm CO2-eq.
c) Ranges correspond to the 15th to 85th percentile of the post-TAR scenario distribution. CO2 emissions are shown so multi-gas scenarios can be
compared with CO2-only scenarios (see Figure 2.1).
d) The best estimate of climate sensitivity is 3°C.
e) Note that global average temperature at equilibrium is different from expected global average temperature at the time of stabilisation of GHG
concentrations due to the inertia of the climate system. For the majority of scenarios assessed, stabilisation of GHG concentrations occurs
between 2100 and 2150 (see also Footnote 30).
f)
Equilibrium sea level rise is for the contribution from ocean thermal expansion only and does not reach equilibrium for at least many centuries.
These values have been estimated using relatively simple climate models (one low-resolution AOGCM and several EMICs based on the best
estimate of 3°C climate sensitivity) and do not include contributions from melting ice sheets, glaciers and ice caps. Long-term thermal expansion
is projected to result in 0.2 to 0.6m per degree Celsius of global average warming above pre-industrial. (AOGCM refers to Atmosphere-Ocean
General Circulation Model and EMICs to Earth System Models of Intermediate Complexity.)
global average temperature increases, using the ‘best estimate’ of
climate sensitivity (see Figure 5.1 for the likely range of uncer-
tainty). Stabilisation at lower concentration and related equilibrium
temperature levels advances the date when emissions need to peak
and requires greater emissions reductions by 2050.30  Climate sen-
sitivity is a key uncertainty for mitigation scenarios that aim to meet
specific temperature levels. The timing and level of mitigation to
reach a given temperature stabilisation level is earlier and more
stringent if climate sensitivity is high than if it is low. {WGIII 3.3,
3.4, 3.5, 3.6, SPM}
Sea level rise under warming is inevitable. Thermal expansion
would continue for many centuries after GHG concentrations have
stabilised, for any of the stabilisation levels assessed, causing an
eventual sea level rise much larger than projected for the 21st cen-
tury (Table 5.1). If GHG and aerosol concentrations had been
stabilised at year 2000 levels, thermal expansion alone would be
expected to lead to further sea level rise of 0.3 to 0.8m. The even-
tual contributions from Greenland ice sheet loss could be several
metres, and larger than from thermal expansion, should warming in
excess of 1.9 to 4.6°C above pre-industrial be sustained over many
centuries. These long-term consequences would have major impli-
cations for world coastlines. The long time scale of thermal expan-
sion and ice sheet response to warming imply that mitigation strat-
egies that seek to stabilise GHG concentrations (or radiative forc-
ing) at or above present levels do not stabilise sea level for many
centuries. {WG1 10.7}
Feedbacks between the carbon cycle and climate change affect
the required mitigation and adaptation response to climate change.
Climate-carbon cycle coupling is expected to increase the fraction
of anthropogenic emissions that remains in the atmosphere as the
climate system warms (see Topics 2.3 and 3.2.1), but mitigation
studies have not yet incorporated the full range of these feedbacks.
As a consequence, the emission reductions to meet a particular
stabilisation level reported in the mitigation studies assessed in Table
5.1 might be underestimated. Based on current understanding of
climate-carbon cycle feedbacks, model studies suggest that
stabilising CO2 concentrations at, for example, 450ppm31 could re-
quire cumulative emissions over the 21st century to be less than
1800 [1370 to 2200] GtCO2, which is about 27% less than the 2460
[2310 to 2600] GtCO2 determined without consideration of carbon
cycle feedbacks. {SYR 2.3, 3.2.1; WGI 7.3, 10.4, SPM}
30 Estimates for the evolution of temperature over the course of this century are not available in the AR4 for the stabilisation scenarios. For most stabilisation
levels global average temperature is approaching the equilibrium level over a few centuries. For the much lower stabilisation scenarios (category I and II,
Figure 5.1), the equilibrium temperature may be reached earlier.
31 To stabilise at 1000ppm CO2, this feedback could require that cumulative emissions be reduced from a model average of approximately 5190 [4910 to
5460] GtCO2 to approximately 4030 [3590 to 4580] GtCO2.  {WGI 7.3, 10.4, SPM}

Illustrative mitigation portfolios for achieving stabilisation of GHG concentrations
Figure 5.2 Cumulative emissions reductions for alternative mitigation measures for 2000-2030 (left-hand panel) and for 2000-2100 (right-hand panel). The
figure shows illustrative scenarios from four models (AIM, IMAGE, IPAC and MESSAGE) aiming at the stabilisation at low (490 to 540ppm CO2-eq) and
intermediate levels (650ppm CO2-eq) respectively. Dark bars denote reductions for a target of 650ppm CO2-eq and light bars denote the additional reduc-
tions to achieve 490 to 540ppm CO2-eq. Note that some models do not consider mitigation through forest sink enhancement (AIM and IPAC) or CCS (AIM)
and that the share of low-carbon energy options in total energy supply is also determined by inclusion of these options in the baseline. CCS includes CO2
capture and storage from biomass. Forest sinks include reducing emissions from deforestation. The figure shows emissions reductions from baseline
scenarios with cumulative emissions between 6000 to 7000 GtCO2-eq (2000-2100). {WGIII Figure SPM.9}
5.5 Technology flows and development
There is high agreement and much evidence that all
stabilisation levels assessed can be achieved by deploy-
ment of a portfolio of technologies that are either currently
available or expected to be commercialised in coming de-
cades, assuming appropriate and effective incentives are
in place for development, acquisition, deployment and dif-
fusion of technologies and addressing related barriers. {WGIII
SPM}
Worldwide deployment of low-GHG emission technologies as
well as technology improvements through public and private RD&D
would be required for achieving stabilisation targets as well as cost
reduction.32 Figure 5.2 gives illustrative examples of the contribu-
tion of the portfolio of mitigation options. The contribution of dif-
ferent technologies varies over time and region and depends on the
baseline development path, available technologies and relative costs,
and the analysed stabilisation levels. Stabilisation at the lower of
the assessed levels (490 to 540ppm CO2-eq) requires early invest-
ments and substantially more rapid diffusion and commercialisation
of advanced low-emissions technologies over the next decades
(2000-2030) and higher contributions across abatement options in
the long term (2000-2100). This requires that barriers to develop-
ment, acquisition, deployment and diffusion of technologies are
effectively addressed with appropriate incentives. {WGIII 2.7, 3.3,
3.4, 3.6, 4.3, 4.4, 4.6, SPM}
Without sustained investment flows and effective technology
transfer, it may be difficult to achieve emission reduction at a sig-
nificant scale. Mobilising financing of incremental costs of low-
carbon technologies is important. {WGIII 13.3, SPM}
There are large uncertainties concerning the future contribu-
tion of different technologies. However, all assessed stabilisation
scenarios concur that 60 to 80% of the reductions over the course
of the century would come from energy supply and use and indus-
trial processes. Including non-CO2 and CO2 land-use and forestry
mitigation options provides greater flexibility and cost-effective-
ness. Energy efficiency plays a key role across many scenarios for
most regions and time scales. For lower stabilisation levels, sce-
narios put more emphasis on the use of low-carbon energy sources,
such as renewable energy, nuclear power and the use of CO2 cap-
ture and storage (CCS). In these scenarios, improvements of car-
bon intensity of energy supply and the whole economy needs to be
much faster than in the past (Figure 5.2). {WGIII 3.3, 3.4, TS.3, SPM}
32 By comparison, government funding in real absolute terms for most energy research programmes has been flat or declining for nearly two decades (even
after the UNFCCC came into force) and is now about half of the 1980 level. {WGIII 2.7, 3.4, 4.5, 11.5, 13.2}

Topic 5
The long-term perspective
5.6 Costs of mitigation and long-term
stabilisation targets
The macro-economic costs of mitigation generally rise with
the stringency of the stabilisation target and are relatively
higher when derived from baseline scenarios characterised
by high emission levels. {WGIII SPM}
There is high agreement and medium evidence that in 2050 glo-
bal average macro-economic costs for multi-gas mitigation towards
stabilisation between 710 and 445ppm CO2-eq are between a 1%
gain to a 5.5% decrease of global GDP (Table 5.2). This corre-
sponds to slowing average annual global GDP growth by less than
0.12 percentage points. Estimated GDP losses by 2030 are on aver-
age lower and show a smaller spread compared to 2050 (Table 5.2).
For specific countries and sectors, costs vary considerably from the
global average.33  {WGIII 3.3, 13.3, SPM}
5.7 Costs, benefits and avoided climate
impacts at global and regional levels
Impacts of climate change will vary regionally. Aggregated
and discounted to the present, they are very likely to im-
pose net annual costs, which will increase over time as glo-
bal temperatures increase. {WGII SPM}
For increases in global average temperature of less than 1 to 3°C
above 1980-1999 levels, some impacts are projected to produce
market benefits in some places and sectors while, at the same time,
imposing costs in other places and sectors. Global mean losses could
be 1 to 5% of GDP for 4°C of warming, but regional losses could
be substantially higher. {WGII 9.ES, 10.6, 15.ES, 20.6, SPM}
Peer-reviewed estimates of the social cost of carbon (net eco-
nomic costs of damages from climate change aggregated across the
globe and discounted to the present) for 2005 have an average value
of US$12 per tonne of CO2, but the range from 100 estimates is
large (-$3 to $95/tCO2). The range of published evidence indicates
that the net damage costs of climate change are projected to be
significant and to increase over time. {WGII 20.6, SPM}
It is very likely that globally aggregated figures underestimate
the damage costs because they cannot include many non-quantifi-
able impacts. It is virtually certain that aggregate estimates of costs
mask significant differences in impacts across sectors, regions, coun-
tries and populations. In some locations and amongst some groups
of people with high exposure, high sensitivity and/or low adaptive
capacity, net costs will be significantly larger than the global aver-
age. {WGII 7.4, 20.ES, 20.6, 20.ES, SPM}
Limited and early analytical results from integrated analy-
ses of the global costs and benefits of mitigation indicate
that these are broadly comparable in magnitude, but do not
as yet permit an unambiguous determination of an emis-
sions pathway or stabilisation level where benefits exceed
costs. {WGIII SPM}
Comparing the costs of mitigation with avoided damages would
require the reconciliation of welfare impacts on people living in
different places and at different points in time into a global aggre-
gate measure of well-being. {WGII 18.ES}
Choices about the scale and timing of GHG mitigation involve
balancing the economic costs of more rapid emission reductions
now against the corresponding medium-term and long-term climate
risks of delay. {WGIII SPM}
Many impacts can be avoided, reduced or delayed by miti-
gation. {WGII SPM}
Although the small number of impact assessments that evalu-
ate stabilisation scenarios do not take full account of uncertainties
in projected climate under stabilisation, they nevertheless provide
indications of damages avoided and risks reduced for different

amounts of emissions reduction. The rate and magnitude of future
human-induced climate change and its associated impacts are de-
termined by human choices defining alternative socio-economic
futures and mitigation actions that influence emission pathways.
Figure 3.2 demonstrates that alternative SRES emission pathways
could lead to substantial differences in climate change throughout
the 21st century. Some of the impacts at the high temperature end of
Figure 3.6 could be avoided by socio-economic development path-
ways that limit emissions and associated climate change towards
the lower end of the ranges illustrated in Figure 3.6. {SYR 3.2, 3.3;
WGIII 3.5, 3.6, SPM}
Figure 3.6 illustrates how reduced warming could reduce the
risk of, for example, affecting a significant number of ecosystems,
the risk of extinctions, and the likelihood that cereal productivity
in some regions would tend to fall. {SYR 3.3, Figure 3.6; WGII 4.4, 5.4,
Table 20.6}
5.8 Broader environmental and
sustainability issues
Sustainable development can reduce vulnerability to climate
change, and climate change could impede nations’ abilities
to achieve sustainable development pathways. {WGII SPM}
It is very likely that climate change can slow the pace of progress
toward sustainable development either directly through increased
exposure to adverse impacts or indirectly through erosion of the
capacity to adapt. Over the next half-century, climate change could
impede achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. {WGII
SPM}
Climate change will interact at all scales with other trends in
global environmental and natural resource concerns, including
water, soil and air pollution, health hazards, disaster risk, and de-
forestation. Their combined impacts may be compounded in future
in the absence of integrated mitigation and adaptation measures.
{WGII 20.3, 20.7, 20.8, SPM}
Making development more sustainable can enhance miti-
gative and adaptive capacities, reduce emissions, and re-
duce vulnerability, but there may be barriers to implementa-
tion. {WGII 20.8; WGIII 12.2, SPM}
Both adaptive and mitigative capacities can be enhanced through
sustainable development. Sustainable development can, thereby,
reduce vulnerability to climate change by reducing sensitivities
(through adaptation) and/or exposure (through mitigation). At
present, however, few plans for promoting sustainability have ex-
plicitly included either adapting to climate change impacts, or pro-
moting adaptive capacity. Similarly, changing development paths
can make a major contribution to mitigation but may require re-
sources to overcome multiple barriers. {WGII 20.3, 20.5, SPM; WGIII

Robust findings, key uncertainties

Robust findings, key uncertainties
As in the TAR, a robust finding for climate change is defined
as one that holds under a variety of approaches, methods, models
and assumptions, and is expected to be relatively unaffected by
uncertainties. Key uncertainties are those that, if reduced, could
lead to new robust findings. {TAR SYR Q.9}
Robust findings do not encompass all key findings of the AR4.
Some key findings may be policy-relevant even though they are
associated with large uncertainties. {WGII 20.9}
The robust findings and key uncertainties listed below do not
represent an exhaustive list.
6.1 Observed changes in climate and their
effects, and their causes
Robust findings
Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as is now evi-
dent from observations of increases in global average air and ocean
temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice and rising glo-
bal average sea level. {WGI 3.9, SPM}
Many natural systems, on all continents and in some oceans,
are being affected by regional climate changes. Observed changes
in many physical and biological systems are consistent with warm-
ing. As a result of the uptake of anthropogenic CO2 since 1750, the
acidity of the surface ocean has increased. {WGI 5.4, WGII 1.3}
Global total annual anthropogenic GHG emissions, weighted
by their 100-year GWPs, have grown by 70% between 1970 and
2004. As a result of anthropogenic emissions, atmospheric concen-
trations of N2O now far exceed pre-industrial values spanning many
thousands of years, and those of CH4 and CO2 now far exceed the
natural range over the last 650,000 years. {WGI SPM; WGIII 1.3}
Most of the global average warming over the past 50 years is
very likely due to anthropogenic GHG increases and it is likely that
there is a discernible human-induced warming averaged over each
continent (except Antarctica). {WGI 9.4, SPM}
Anthropogenic warming over the last three decades has likely
had a discernible influence at the global scale on observed changes
in many physical and biological systems. {WGII 1.4, SPM}
Key uncertainties
Climate data coverage remains limited in some regions and there
is a notable lack of geographic balance in data and literature on
observed changes in natural and managed systems, with marked
scarcity in developing countries. {WGI SPM; WGII 1.3, SPM}
Analysing and monitoring changes in extreme events, includ-
ing drought, tropical cyclones, extreme temperatures and the fre-
quency and intensity of precipitation, is more difficult than for cli-
matic averages as longer data time-series of higher spatial and tem-
poral resolutions are required. {WGI 3.8, SPM}
Effects of climate changes on human and some natural systems
are difficult to detect due to adaptation and non-climatic drivers.
{WGII 1.3}
Difficulties remain in reliably simulating and attributing ob-
served temperature changes to natural or human causes at smaller
than continental scales. At these smaller scales, factors such as land-
use change and pollution also complicate the detection of anthro-
pogenic warming influence on physical and biological systems. {WGI
8.3, 9.4, SPM; WGII 1.4, SPM}
The magnitude of CO2 emissions from land-use change and
CH4 emissions from individual sources remain as key uncertain-
ties. {WGI 2.3, 7.3, 7.4; WGIII 1.3, TS.14}
6.2 Drivers and projections of future climate
changes and their impacts
Robust findings
With current climate change mitigation policies and related sus-
tainable development practices, global GHG emissions will con-
tinue to grow over the next few decades. {WGIII 3.2, SPM}
For the next two decades a warming of about 0.2°C per decade
is projected for a range of SRES emissions scenarios. {WGI 10.3,
10.7, SPM}
Continued GHG emissions at or above current rates would cause
further warming and induce many changes in the global climate
system during the 21st century that would very likely be larger than
those observed during the 20th century. {WGI 10.3, 11.1, SPM}
The pattern of future warming where land warms more than the
adjacent oceans and more in northern high latitudes is seen in all
scenarios. {WGI 10.3, 11.1, SPM}
Warming tends to reduce terrestrial ecosystem and ocean up-
take of atmospheric CO2, increasing the fraction of anthropogenic
emissions that remains in the atmosphere. {WGI 7.3, 10.4, 10.5, SPM}
Anthropogenic warming and sea level rise would continue for
centuries even if GHG emissions were to be reduced sufficiently
for GHG concentrations to stabilise, due to the time scales associ-
ated with climate processes and feedbacks. {WGI 10.7, SPM}
Equilibrium climate sensitivity is very unlikely to be less than
1.5°C. {WGI 8.6, 9.6, Box 10.2, SPM}
Some systems, sectors and regions are likely to be especially
affected by climate change. The systems and sectors are some eco-
systems (tundra, boreal forest, mountain, mediterranean-type, man-
groves, salt marshes, coral reefs and the sea-ice biome), low-lying
coasts, water resources in some dry regions at mid-latitudes and in
the dry topics and in areas dependent on snow and ice melt, agri-
culture in low-latitude regions, and human health in areas with low
adaptive capacity. The regions are the Arctic, Africa, small islands
and Asian and African megadeltas. Within other regions, even those
with high incomes, some people, areas and activities can be par-
ticularly at risk. {WGII TS.4.5}
Impacts are very likely to increase due to increased frequencies
and intensities of some extreme weather events. Recent events have
demonstrated the vulnerability of some sectors and regions, includ-
ing in developed countries, to heat waves, tropical cyclones, floods
and drought, providing stronger reasons for concern as compared

Topic 6
Robust findings, key uncertainties
Key uncertainties
Uncertainty in the equilibrium climate sensitivity creates un-
certainty in the expected warming for a given CO2-eq stabilisation
scenario. Uncertainty in the carbon cycle feedback creates uncer-
tainty in the emissions trajectory required to achieve a particular
stabilisation level. {WGI 7.3, 10.4, 10.5, SPM}
Models differ considerably in their estimates of the strength of
different feedbacks in the climate system, particularly cloud feed-
backs, oceanic heat uptake and carbon cycle feedbacks, although
progress has been made in these areas. Also, the confidence in pro-
jections is higher for some variables (e.g. temperature) than for
others (e.g. precipitation), and it is higher for larger spatial scales
and longer time averaging periods. {WGI 7.3, 8.1-8.7, 9.6, 10.2, 10.7,
SPM; WGII 4.4}
Aerosol impacts on the magnitude of the temperature response,
on clouds and on precipitation remain uncertain. {WGI 2.9, 7.5, 9.2,
9.4, 9.5}
Future changes in the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheet mass,
particularly due to changes in ice flow, are a major source of uncer-
tainty that could increase sea level rise projections. The uncertainty
in the penetration of the heat into the oceans also contributes to the
future sea level rise uncertainty. {WGI 4.6, 6.4, 10.3, 10.7, SPM}
Large-scale ocean circulation changes beyond the 21st century
cannot be reliably assessed because of uncertainties in the meltwa-
ter supply from the Greenland ice sheet and model response to the
warming. {WGI 6.4, 8.7, 10.3 }
Projections of climate change and its impacts beyond about 2050
are strongly scenario- and model-dependent, and improved projections
would require improved understanding of sources of uncertainty and
enhancements in systematic observation networks. {WGII TS.6}
Impacts research is hampered by uncertainties surrounding re-
gional projections of climate change, particularly precipitation.
{WGII TS.6}
Understanding of low-probability/high-impact events and the
cumulative impacts of sequences of smaller events, which is re-
quired for risk-based approaches to decision-making, is generally
limited. {WGII 19.4, 20.2, 20.4, 20.9, TS.6}
6.3 Responses to climate change
Robust findings
Some planned adaptation (of human activities) is occurring now;
more extensive adaptation is required to reduce vulnerability to cli-
mate change. {WGII 17.ES, 20.5, Table 20.6, SPM}
Unmitigated climate change would, in the long term, be likely
to exceed the capacity of natural, managed and human systems to
adapt. {WGII 20.7, SPM}
A wide range of mitigation options is currently available or pro-
jected to be available by 2030 in all sectors. The economic mitiga-
tion potential, at costs that range from net negative up to US$100/
tCO2-equivalent, is sufficient to offset the projected growth of glo-
bal emissions or to reduce emissions to below current levels in 2030.
{WGIII 11.3, SPM}
Many impacts can be reduced, delayed or avoided by mitiga-
tion. Mitigation efforts and investments over the next two to three
decades will have a large impact on opportunities to achieve lower
stabilisation levels. Delayed emissions reductions significantly con-
strain the opportunities to achieve lower stabilisation levels and
increase the risk of more severe climate change impacts. {WGII SPM,
WGIII SPM}
The range of stabilisation levels for GHG concentrations that
have been assessed can be achieved by deployment of a portfolio
of technologies that are currently available and those that are ex-
pected to be commercialised in coming decades, provided that ap-
propriate and effective incentives are in place and barriers are re-
moved.  In addition, further RD&D would be required to improve
the technical performance, reduce the costs and achieve social ac-
ceptability of new technologies. The lower the stabilisation levels,
the greater the need for investment in new technologies during the
next few decades. {WGIII 3.3, 3.4}
Making development more sustainable by changing develop-
ment paths can make a major contribution to climate change miti-
gation and adaptation and to reducing vulnerability. {WGII 18.7, 20.3,
SPM; WGIII 13.2, SPM}
Decisions about macro-economic and other policies that seem
unrelated to climate change can significantly affect emissions. {WGIII
12.2}
Key uncertainties
Understanding of how development planners incorporate in-
formation about climate variability and change into their decisions
is limited.  This limits the integrated assessment of vulnerability.
{WGII 18.8, 20.9}
The evolution and utilisation of adaptive and mitigative capac-
ity depend on underlying socio-economic development pathways.
{WGII 17.3, 17.4, 18.6, 19.4, 20.9}
Barriers, limits and costs of adaptation are not fully understood,
partly because effective adaptation measures are highly dependent
on specific geographical and climate risk factors as well as institu-
tional, political and financial constraints. {WGII SPM}
Estimates of mitigation costs and potentials depend on assump-
tions about future socio-economic growth, technological change
and consumption patterns. Uncertainty arises in particular from
assumptions regarding the drivers of technology diffusion and the
potential of long-term technology performance and cost improve-
ments. Also little is known about the effects of changes in behaviour
and lifestyles. {WGIII 3.3, 3.4, 11.3}
The effects of non-climate policies on emissions are poorly
quantified. {WGIII 12.2}

Annex I
User guide and access to more detailed information
As defined in the IPCC Procedures, the Synthesis Report (SYR) synthesises and integrates material contained within IPCC Assessment
Reports and Special Reports. The scope of the SYR of the Fourth Assessment Report includes material contained in the three Working
Group contributions to the AR4, and it draws on information contained in other IPCC Reports as required. The SYR is based exclusively
on assessments by the IPCC Working Groups, it does not refer to or assess the primary scientific literature itself.
The SYR is largely self-contained but provides only a very condensed summary of the much richer information contained in the underlying
Working Group reports. Users may wish to access relevant material at the required level of detail in the following manner:
�
The Summary for Policymakers (SPM) of the SYR provides the most condensed summary of our current understanding of scientific,
technical and socio-economic aspects of climate change. All references in curly brackets in this Summary for Policymakers refer to
numbered sections of this SYR.
�
The Introduction and six Topics of this SYR provide more detailed and more comprehensive information than the SYR SPM. Refer-
ences in curly backets in the Introduction and six Topics of this SYR point to chapter sections, Summaries for Policymakers and
Technical Summaries of the three underlying Working Group reports of the AR4, and in some instances to other topic sections of the
SYR itself. References to the IPCC Third Assessment Report in 2001 (TAR) are identified by adding “TAR” in front of the cited report.
�
Users who wish to gain a better understanding of scientific details or access the primary scientific literature on which the SYR is based,
should refer to chapter sections of the underlying Working Group reports that are cited in the longer report of the SYR. The individual
chapters of the Working Group reports provide comprehensive references to the primary scientific literature on which IPCC assess-
ments are based, and also offer the most detailed region- and sector-specific information.
A comprehensive glossary, list of acronyms, abbreviations and scientific units, and an index are provided below to facilitate use of this
report by as wide an audience as possible.

A.
Abrupt climate change
The nonlinearity of the climate system may lead to abrupt climate change,
sometimes called rapid climate change, abrupt events or even surprises.
The term abrupt often refers to time scales faster than the typical time
scale of the responsible forcing. However, not all abrupt climate changes
need be externally forced. Some possible abrupt events that have been
proposed include a dramatic reorganisation of the thermohaline circula-
tion, rapid deglaciation and massive melting of permafrost or increases in
soil respiration leading to fast changes in the carbon cycle. Others may be
truly unexpected, resulting from a strong, rapidly changing, forcing of a
non-linear system.
Absorption, scattering and emission of radiation
Electromagnetic radiation may interact with matter, be it in the form of the
atoms and molecules of a gas (e.g. the gases in the atmosphere) or in the
form of particulate, solid or liquid, matter (e.g. aerosols), in various ways.
Matter itself emits radiation in accordance with its composition and tem-
perature. Radiation may be absorbed by matter, whereby the absorbed en-
ergy may be transferred or re-emitted. Finally, radiation may also be de-
flected from its original path (scattered) as a result of interaction with
matter.
Activities Implemented Jointly (AIJ)
The pilot phase for Joint Implementation, as defined in Article 4.2(a) of
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)
that allows for project activity among developed countries (and their com-
panies) and between developed and developing countries (and their com-
panies). AIJ is intended to allow parties to the UNFCCC to gain experi-
ence in jointly implemented projects. There is no credit for AIJ during the
pilot phase. A decision remains on the future of AIJ projects and how they
may relate to the Kyoto Mechanisms.  As a simple form of tradable per-
mits, AIJ and other market-based schemes represent potential mechanisms
for stimulating additional resource flows for reducing emissions. See also
Clean Development Mechanism, and Emissions Trading.
Adaptation
Initiatives and measures to reduce the vulnerability of natural and human sys-
tems against actual or expected climate change effects. Various types of adap-
tation exist, e.g. anticipatory and reactive, private and public, and autono-
mous and planned. Examples are raising river or coastal dikes, the substitu-
tion of more temperature-shock resistant plants for sensitive ones, etc.
Adaptation benefits
The avoided damage costs or the accrued benefits following the adoption
and implementation of adaptation measures.
Adaptation costs
Costs of planning, preparing for, facilitating, and implementing adapta-
tion measures, including transition costs.
Adaptive capacity
The whole of capabilities, resources and institutions of a country or region
to implement effective adaptation measures.
Aerosols
A collection of airborne solid or liquid particles, with a typical size be-
tween 0.01 and 10 micrometer (a millionth of a meter) that reside in the
atmosphere for at least several hours. Aerosols may be of either natural or
anthropogenic origin. Aerosols may influence climate in several ways:
directly through scattering and absorbing radiation, and indirectly through
acting as cloud condensation nuclei or modifying the optical properties
and lifetime of clouds.
Afforestation
Planting of new forests on lands that historically have not contained for-
ests (for at least 50 years). For a discussion of the term forest and related
terms such as afforestation, reforestation, and deforestation see the IPCC
Report on Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (IPCC, 2000). See
also the Report on Definitions and Methodological Options to Inventory
Emissions from Direct Human-induced Degradation of Forests and
Devegetation of  Other Vegetation Types (IPCC, 2003).
Aggregate impacts
Total impacts integrated across sectors and/or regions. The aggregation of
impacts requires knowledge of (or assumptions about) the relative impor-
tance of impacts in different sectors and regions. Measures of aggregate
impacts include, for example, the total number of people affected, or the
total economic costs.
Albedo
The fraction of solar radiation reflected by a surface or object, often expressed
as a percentage. Snow-covered surfaces have a high albedo, the surface al-
bedo of soils ranges from high to low, and vegetation-covered surfaces and
oceans have a low albedo. The Earth’s planetary albedo varies mainly through
varying cloudiness, snow, ice, leaf area and land cover changes.
Albedo feedback
A climate feedback involving changes in the Earth’s albedo. It usually
refers to changes in the cryosphere which has an albedo much larger (~0.8)
than the average planetary albedo (~0.3). In a warming climate, it is an-
ticipated that the cryosphere would shrink, the Earth’s overall albedo would
decrease and more solar energy would be absorbed to warm the Earth still
further.
Algal bloom
A reproductive explosion of algae in a lake, river, or ocean.
Alpine
The biogeographic zone made up of slopes above the tree line, characterised
by the presence of rosette-forming herbaceous plants and low shrubby slow-
growing woody plants.

Annex I countries
The group of countries included in Annex I (as amended in 1998) to the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC),
including all the OECD countries in the year 1990 and countries with econo-
mies in transition. Under Articles 4.2 (a) and 4.2 (b) of the Convention,
Annex I countries committed themselves specifically to the aim of return-
ing individually or jointly to their 1990 levels of greenhouse gas emis-
sions by the year 2000. By default, the other countries are referred to as
Non-Annex I countries. For a list of Annex I countries, see http://unfccc.int.
Annex II countries
The group of countries included in Annex II to the United Nations Frame-
work Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), including all OECD
countries in the year 1990. Under Article 4.2 (g) of the Convention, these
countries are expected to provide financial resources to assist developing
countries to comply with their obligations, such as preparing national re-
ports. Annex II countries are also expected to promote the transfer of envi-
ronmentally sound technologies to developing countries. For a list of An-
nex II countries, see http://unfccc.int.
Annex B countries

associated with human activities, including the burning of fossil fuels, de-
forestation, land-use changes, livestock, fertilisation, etc.
Arid region
A land region of low rainfall, where low is widely accepted to be <250 mm
precipitation per year.
Atmosphere
The gaseous envelope surrounding the Earth. The dry atmosphere consists
almost entirely of nitrogen (78.1% volume mixing ratio) and oxygen (20.9%
volume mixing ratio), together with a number of trace gases, such as argon
(0.93% volume mixing ratio), helium and radiatively active greenhouse
gases such as carbon dioxide (0.035% volume mixing ratio) and ozone. In
addition, the atmosphere contains the greenhouse gas water vapour, whose
amounts are highly variable but typically around 1% volume mixing ratio.
The atmosphere also contains clouds and aerosols.
Attribution
See Detection and attribution.
B.
Barrier
Any obstacle to reaching a goal, adaptation or mitigation potential that
can be overcome or attenuated by a policy, programme, or measure. Bar-
rier removal includes correcting market failures directly or reducing the
transactions costs in the public and private sectors by e.g. improving insti-
tutional capacity, reducing risk and uncertainty, facilitating market trans-
actions, and enforcing regulatory policies.
Baseline
Reference for measurable quantities from which an alternative outcome
can be measured, e.g. a non-intervention scenario used as a reference in
the analysis of intervention scenarios.
Basin
The drainage area of a stream, river, or lake.
Biodiversity
The total diversity of all organisms and ecosystems at various spatial scales
(from genes to entire biomes).
Biofuel
A fuel produced from organic matter or combustible oils produced by plants.
Examples of biofuel include alcohol, black liquor from the paper-manu-
facturing process, wood, and soybean oil.
Biomass
The total mass of living organisms in a given area or volume; recently
dead plant material is often included as dead biomass. The quantity of
biomass is expressed as a dry weight or as the energy, carbon, or nitrogen
content.
Biome
A major and distinct regional element of the biosphere, typically consist-
ing of several ecosystems (e.g. forests, rivers, ponds, swamps within a
region of similar climate). Biomes are characterised by typical communi-
ties of plants and animals.
Biosphere (terrestrial and marine)
The part of the Earth system comprising all ecosystems and living organ-
isms, in the atmosphere, on land (terrestrial biosphere) or in the oceans
(marine biosphere), including derived dead organic matter, such as litter,
soil organic matter and oceanic detritus.
Boreal forest
Forests of pine, spruce, fir, and larch stretching from the east coast of
Canada westward to Alaska and continuing from Siberia westward across
the entire extent of Russia to the European Plain.
Borehole temperature
Borehole temperatures are measured in boreholes of tens to hundreds of
meters depth into the subsurface of the Earth. Borehole temperature depth
profiles are commonly used to infer time variations in the ground surface
temperature on centennial time scales.
Bottom-up models
Bottom-up models represent reality by aggregating characteristics of spe-
cific activities and processes, considering technological, engineering and
cost details. See also Top-down models.
C.
Carbon (Dioxide) Capture and Storage (CCS)
A process consisting of separation of carbon dioxide from industrial and
energy-related sources, transport to a storage location, and long-term iso-
lation from the atmosphere.
Carbon cycle
The term used to describe the flow of carbon (in various forms, e.g. as
carbon dioxide) through the atmosphere, ocean, terrestrial biosphere and
lithosphere.
Carbon dioxide (CO2)
A naturally occurring gas, also a by-product of burning fossil fuels from
fossil carbon deposits, such as oil, gas and coal, of burning biomass and of
land use changes and other industrial processes. It is the principal anthro-
pogenic greenhouse gas that affects the Earth’s radiative balance. It is the
reference gas against which other greenhouse gases are measured and there-
fore has a Global Warming Potential of 1.
Carbon dioxide (CO2) fertilisation
The enhancement of the growth of plants as a result of increased atmo-
spheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration. Depending on their mecha-
nism of photosynthesis, certain types of plants are more sensitive to changes
in atmospheric CO2 concentration.
Appendix II
Glossary
78
Carbon intensity
The amount of emission of carbon dioxide per unit of Gross Domestic
Product.
Carbon leakage
The part of emissions reductions in Annex B countries that may be offset
by an increase of the emissions in the non-constrained countries above
their baseline levels. This can occur through (1) relocation of energy-in-
tensive production in non-constrained regions; (2) increased consumption
of fossil fuels in these regions through decline in the international price of
oil and gas triggered by lower demand for these energies; and (3) changes
in incomes (thus in energy demand) because of better terms of trade.
Carbon sequestration
See Uptake
Catchment
An area that collects and drains rainwater.
Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)
See Halocarbons
Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)
Defined in Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol, the CDM is intended to meet
two objectives: (1) to assist parties not included in Annex I  in achieving
sustainable development and in contributing to the ultimate objective of
the convention; and (2) to assist parties included in Annex I in achieving
compliance with their quantified emission limitation and reduction com-
mitments. Certified Emission Reduction Units from CDM projects under-
taken in non-Annex I countries that limit or reduce greenhouse gas emis-
sions, when certified by operational entities designated by Conference of
the Parties/Meeting of the Parties, can be accrued to the investor (govern-
ment or industry) from parties in Annex B. A share of the proceeds from
the certified project activities is used to cover administrative expenses as
well as to assist developing country parties that are particularly vulnerable
to the adverse effects of climate change to meet the costs of adaptation.
Climate
Climate in a narrow sense is usually defined as the average weather, or
more rigorously, as the statistical description in terms of the mean and
variability of relevant quantities over a period of time ranging from months
to thousands or millions of years. The classical period for averaging these
variables is 30 years, as defined by the World Meteorological Organiza-
tion. The relevant quantities are most often surface variables such as tem-
perature, precipitation and wind. Climate in a wider sense is the state,
including a statistical description, of the climate system. In various parts
of this report different averaging periods, such as a period of 20 years, are
also used.
Climate-carbon cycle coupling
Future climate change induced by atmospheric emissions of greenhouse
gases will impact on the global carbon cycle. Changes in the global car-
bon cycle in turn will influence the fraction of anthropogenic greenhouse
gases that remains in the atmosphere, and hence the atmospheric concen-
trations of greenhouse gases, resulting in further climate change. This feed-
back is called climate-carbon cycle coupling. The first generation coupled
climate-carbon cycle models indicates that global warming will increase
the fraction of anthropogenic CO2 that remains in the atmosphere.
Climate change
Climate change refers to a change in the state of the climate that can be
identified (e.g., by using statistical tests) by changes in the mean and/or
the variability of its properties, and that persists for an extended period,
typically decades or longer. Climate change may be due to natural internal
processes or external forcings, or to persistent anthropogenic changes in
the composition of the atmosphere or in land use. Note that the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), in its
Article 1, defines climate change as: ‘a change of climate which is attrib-
uted directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of
the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variabil-
ity observed over comparable time periods’. The UNFCCC thus makes a
distinction between climate change attributable to human activities alter-
ing the atmospheric composition, and climate variability attributable to
natural causes. See also Climate variability; Detection and Attribution.
Climate feedback
An interaction mechanism between processes in the climate system is called
a climate feedback when the result of an initial process triggers changes in
a second process that in turn influences the initial one. A positive feedback
intensifies the original process, and a negative feedback reduces it.
Climate model
A numerical representation of the climate system based on the physical,
chemical and biological properties of its components, their interactions
and feedback processes, and accounting for all or some of its known prop-
erties. The climate system can be represented by models of varying com-
plexity, that is, for any one component or combination of components a
spectrum or hierarchy of models can be identified, differing in such as-
pects as the number of spatial dimensions, the extent to which physical,
chemical or biological processes are explicitly represented, or the level at
which empirical parametrisations are involved. Coupled Atmosphere-Ocean
General Circulation Models (AOGCMs) provide a representation of the cli-
mate system that is near the most comprehensive end of the spectrum currently
available. There is an evolution towards more complex models with interac-
tive chemistry and biology (see WGI Chapter 8). Climate models are applied
as a research tool to study and simulate the climate, and for operational pur-
poses, including monthly, seasonal and interannual climate predictions.
Climate prediction
A climate prediction or climate forecast is the result of an attempt to pro-
duce an estimate of the actual evolution of the climate in the future, for
example, at seasonal, interannual or long-term time scales. Since the fu-
ture evolution of the climate system may be highly sensitive to initial con-
ditions, such predictions are usually probabilistic in nature. See also Cli-
mate projection, climate scenario.
Climate projection
A projection of the response of the climate system to emission or concen-
tration scenarios of greenhouse gases and aerosols, or radiative forcing
scenarios, often based upon simulations by climate models. Climate pro-
jections are distinguished from climate predictions in order to emphasise
that climate projections depend upon the emission/concentration/radiative
forcing scenario used, which are based on assumptions concerning, for
example, future socioeconomic and technological developments that may
or may not be realised and are therefore subject to substantial uncertainty.
Climate response
See Climate sensitivity
Climate scenario
A plausible and often simplified representation of the future climate, based
on an internally consistent set of climatological relationships that has been
constructed for explicit use in investigating the potential consequences of
anthropogenic climate change, often serving as input to impact models.
Climate projections often serve as the raw material for constructing cli-
mate scenarios, but climate scenarios usually require additional informa-
tion such as about the observed current climate. A climate change sce-
nario is the difference between a climate scenario and the current climate.
Climate sensitivity
In IPCC reports, equilibrium climate sensitivity refers to the equilibrium
change in the annual mean global surface temperature following a dou-
bling of the atmospheric equivalent carbon dioxide concentration. Due to
computational constraints, the equilibrium climate sensitivity in a climate
model is usually estimated by running an atmospheric general circulation
model coupled to a mixed-layer ocean model, because equilibrium climate
sensitivity is largely determined by atmospheric processes. Efficient mod-
els can be run to equilibrium with a dynamic ocean.
Appendix II
Glossary
79
The transient climate response is the change in the global surface tem-
perature, averaged over a 20-year period, centred at the time of atmo-
spheric carbon dioxide doubling, that is, at year 70 in a 1%/yr compound
carbon dioxide increase experiment with a global coupled climate model.
It is a measure of the strength and rapidity of the surface temperature re-
sponse to greenhouse gas forcing.
Climate shift
An abrupt shift or jump in mean values signalling a change in climate
regime (see Patterns of climate variability). Most widely used in conjunc-
tion with the 1976/1977 climate shift that seems to correspond to a change
in El Niño-Southern Oscillation behaviour.
Climate system
The climate system is the highly complex system consisting of five major
components: the atmosphere, the hydrosphere, the cryosphere, the land
surface and the biosphere, and the interactions between them. The climate
system evolves in time under the influence of its own internal dynamics
and because of external forcings such as volcanic eruptions, solar varia-
tions and anthropogenic forcings such as the changing composition of the
atmosphere and land-use change.
Climate variability
Climate variability refers to variations in the mean state and other statis-
tics (such as standard deviations, the occurrence of extremes, etc.) of the
climate on all spatial and temporal scales beyond that of individual weather
events. Variability may be due to natural internal processes within the cli-
mate system (internal variability), or to variations in natural or anthropo-
genic external forcing (external variability). See also Climate change.
Cloud feedback
A climate feedback involving changes in any of the properties of clouds as
a response to other atmospheric changes. Understanding cloud feedbacks
and determining their magnitude and sign require an understanding of how
a change in climate may affect the spectrum of cloud types, the cloud
fraction and height, and the radiative properties of clouds, and an estimate
of the impact of these changes on the Earth’s radiation budget. At present,
cloud feedbacks remain the largest source of uncertainty in climate sensi-
tivity estimates. See also Radiative forcing.
CO2-equivalent
See Box “Carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO2-eq) emissions and concentra-
tions” in Topic 2 of the Synthesis Report and Working Group I Chapter
2.10.
CO2-fertilization
See Carbon dioxide fertilization.
Co-benefits
The benefits of policies implemented for various reasons at the same time,
acknowledging that most policies designed to address greenhouse gas miti-
gation have other, often at least equally important, rationales (e.g., related
to objectives of development, sustainability, and equity).
Combined Heat and Power (CHP)
The use of waste heat from thermal electricity generation plants. The heat
is e.g. condensing heat from steam turbines or hot flue gases exhausted
from gas turbines, for industrial use, buildings or district heating. Also
called co-generation.
Compliance
Compliance is whether and to what extent countries do adhere to the pro-
visions of an accord. Compliance depends on implementing policies or-
dered, and on whether measures follow up the policies. Compliance is the
degree to which the actors whose behaviour is targeted by the agreement,
local government units, corporations, organisations, or individuals, con-
form to the implementing obligations. See also Implementation.
Confidence
The level of confidence in the correctness of a result is expressed in this
report, using a standard terminology defined  as follows:
Terminology
Degree of confidence in being correct
Very high confidence
At least 9 out of 10 chance of being correct
High confidence
About 8 out of 10 chance
Medium confidence
About 5 out of 10 chance
Low confidence
About 2 out of 10 chance
Very low confidence
Less than 1 out of 10 chance
See also Likelihood; Uncertainty
Coral
The term coral has several meanings, but is usually the common name for
the Order Scleractinia, all members of which have hard limestone skel-
etons, and which are divided into reef-building and non-reef-building, or
cold- and warm-water corals. See Coral bleaching; Coral reefs
Coral bleaching
The paling in colour which results if a coral loses its symbiotic, energy-
providing, organisms.
Coral reefs
Rock-like limestone structures built by corals along ocean coasts (fring-
ing reefs) or on top of shallow, submerged banks or shelves (barrier reefs,
atolls), most conspicuous in tropical and subtropical oceans.
Cost
The consumption of resources such as labour time, capital, materials, fu-
els, etc. as a consequence of an action. In economics all resources are
valued at their opportunity cost, being the value of the most valuable alter-
native use of the resources. Costs are defined in a variety of ways and
under a variety of assumptions that affect their value. Cost types include:
administrative costs, damage costs (to ecosystems, people and economies
due to negative effects from climate change), and implementation costs of
changing existing rules and regulation, capacity building efforts, informa-
tion, training and education, etc. Private costs are carried by individuals,
companies or other private entities that undertake the action, whereas so-
cial costs include also the external costs on the environment and on soci-
ety as a whole. The negative of costs are benefits (also sometimes called
negative costs). Costs minus benefits are net costs.
Cryosphere
The component of the climate system consisting of all snow, ice and frozen
ground (including permafrost) on and beneath the surface of the Earth and
ocean. See also Glacier; Ice sheet.
D.
Deforestation
Conversion of forest to non-forest. For a discussion of the term forest and
related terms such as afforestation, reforestation, and deforestation see
the IPCC Report on Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (IPCC,
2000). See also the Report on Definitions and Methodological Options to
Inventory Emissions from Direct Human-induced Degradation of Forests
and Devegetation of  Other Vegetation Types (IPCC, 2003).
Demand-side management (DSM)
Policies and programmes for influencing the demand for goods and/or ser-
vices. In the energy sector, DSM aims at reducing the demand for electric-
ity and energy sources. DSM helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Detection and attribution
Climate varies continually on all time scales. Detection of climate change
is the process of demonstrating that climate has changed in some defined
statistical sense, without providing a reason for that change. Attribution of
causes of climate change is the process of establishing the most likely
causes for the detected change with some defined level of confidence.

Development path or pathway
An evolution based on an array of technological, economic, social, institu-
tional, cultural, and biophysical characteristics that determine the interac-
tions between natural and human systems, including production and con-
sumption patterns in all countries, over time at a particular scale. Alterna-
tive development paths refer to different possible trajectories of develop-
ment, the continuation of current trends being just one of the many paths.
Discounting
A mathematical operation making monetary (or other) amounts received
or expended at different points in time (years) comparable across time.
The operator uses a fixed or possibly time-varying discount rate (>0) from
year to year that makes future value worth less today. In a descriptive
discounting approach one accepts the discount rates people (savers and
investors) actually apply in their day-to-day decisions (private discount
rate). In a prescriptive (ethical or normative) discounting approach the
discount rate is fixed from a social perspective, e.g. based on an ethical
judgement about the interests of future generations (social discount rate).
Discount rate
See Discounting
Drought
In general terms, drought is a ‘prolonged absence or marked deficiency of
precipitation’, a ‘deficiency that results in water shortage for some activ-
ity or for some group’, or a ‘period of abnormally dry weather sufficiently
prolonged for the lack of precipitation to cause a serious hydrological im-
balance’ (Heim, 2002). Drought has been defined in a number of ways.
Agricultural drought relates to moisture deficits in the topmost 1 metre or
so of soil (the root zone) that affect crops, meteorological drought is mainly
a prolonged deficit of precipitation, and hydrologic drought is related to
below-normal streamflow, lake and groundwater levels. A megadrought is
a longdrawn out and pervasive drought, lasting much longer than normal,
usually a decade or more.
Dynamical ice discharge
Discharge of ice from ice sheets or ice caps caused by the dynamics of the
ice sheet or ice cap (e.g. in the form of glacier flow, ice streams and calv-
ing icebergs) rather than by melt or runoff.

Economic (mitigation) potential
See Mitigation potential.
Economies in Transition (EITs)
Countries with their economies changing from a planned economic system
to a market economy.
Ecosystem
A system of living organisms interacting with each other and their physi-
cal environment. The boundaries of what could be called an ecosystem are
somewhat arbitrary, depending on the focus of interest or study. Thus, the
extent of an ecosystem may range from very small spatial scales to, ulti-
mately, the entire Earth.
El Nińo-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
The term El Niño was initially used to describe a warm-water current that
periodically flows along the coast of Ecuador and Perú, disrupting the
local fishery. It has since become identified with a basinwide warming of
the tropical Pacific east of the dateline. This oceanic event is associated
with a fluctuation of a global-scale tropical and subtropical surface pres-
sure pattern called the Southern Oscillation. This coupled atmosphere-
ocean phenomenon, with preferred time scales of two to about seven years,
is collectively known as El Niño-Southern Oscillation, or ENSO. It is of-
ten measured by the surface pressure anomaly difference between Darwin
and Tahiti and the sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern equa-
torial Pacific. During an ENSO event, the prevailing trade winds weaken,
reducing upwelling and altering ocean currents such that the sea surface
temperatures warm, further weakening the trade winds. This event has a
great impact on the wind, sea surface temperature and precipitation pat-
terns in the tropical Pacific. It has climatic effects throughout the Pacific
region and in many other parts of the world, through global teleconnections.
The cold phase of ENSO  is called La Niña.
Emission scenario
A plausible representation of the future development of emissions of sub-
stances that are potentially radiatively active (e.g., greenhouse gases, aero-
sols), based on a coherent and internally consistent set of assumptions
about driving forces (such as demographic and socioeconomic develop-
ment, technological change) and their key relationships. Concentration
scenarios, derived from emission scenarios, are used as input to a climate
model to compute climate projections. In IPCC (1992) a set of emission
scenarios was presented which were used as a basis for the climate projec-
tions in IPCC (1996). These emission scenarios are referred to as the IS92
scenarios. In the IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios (Nakic4enovic4
and Swart, 2000) new emission scenarios, the so-called SRES scenarios,
were published. For the meaning of some terms related to these scenarios,
see SRES scenarios.
Emission(s) trading
A market-based approach to achieving environmental objectives. It allows
those reducing greenhouse gas emissions below their emission cap to use
or trade the excess reductions to offset emissions at another source inside
or outside the country. In general, trading can occur at the intra-company,
domestic, and international levels. The Second Assessment Report by the
IPCC adopted the convention of using permits for domestic trading sys-
tems and quotas for international trading systems. Emissions trading un-
der Article 17 of the Kyoto Protocol is a tradable quota system based on
the assigned amounts calculated from the emission reduction and limita-
tion commitments listed in Annex B of the Protocol.
Emission trajectory
A projected development in time of the emission of a greenhouse gas or
group of greenhouse gases, aerosols and greenhouse gas precursors.
Energy
The amount of work or heat delivered. Energy is classified in a variety of
types and becomes useful to human ends when it flows from one place to
another or is converted from one type into another. Primary energy (also
referred to as energy sources) is the energy embodied in natural resources
(e.g., coal, crude oil, natural gas, uranium) that has not undergone any
anthropogenic conversion. This primary energy needs to be converted and
transported to become usable energy (e.g. light). Renewable energy is
obtained from the continuing or repetitive currents of energy occurring in
the natural environment, and includes non-carbon technologies such as
solar energy, hydropower, wind, tide and waves, and geothermal heat, as
well as carbon neutral technologies such as biomass. Embodied energy is
the energy used to produce a material substance (such as processed metals,
or building materials), taking into account energy used at the manufactur-
ing facility (zero order), energy used in producing the materials that are
used in the manufacturing facility (first order), and so on.
Energy balance
The difference between the total incoming and total outgoing energy in the
climate system. If this balance is positive, warming occurs; if it is nega-
tive, cooling occurs. Averaged over the globe and over long time periods,
this balance must be zero. Because the climate system derives virtually all
its energy from the Sun, zero balance implies that, globally, the amount of
incoming solar radiation on average must be equal to the sum of the out-
going reflected solar radiation and the outgoing thermal infrared radia-
tion emitted by the climate system. A perturbation of this global radiation
balance, be it anthropogenic or natural, is called radiative forcing.
Energy efficiency
Ratio of useful energy output of a system, conversion process or activity,
to its energy input.
Appendix II
Glossary
81
Energy intensity
Energy intensity is the ratio of energy use to economic or physical output.
At the national level, energy intensity is the ratio of total primary energy
use or final energy use to Gross Domestic Product. At the activity level,
one can also use physical quantities in the denominator, e.g. litre fuel/
vehicle km.
Equivalent carbon dioxide concentration

tions” in Topic 2 of the Synthesis Report.
Equivalent carbon dioxide emission

Erosion
The process of removal and transport of soil and rock by weathering, mass
wasting, and the action of streams, glaciers, waves, winds, and under-
ground water.
Evapotranspiration
The combined process of water evaporation from the Earth’s surface and
transpiration from vegetation.
External forcing
External forcing refers to a forcing agent outside the climate system caus-
ing a change in the climate system. Volcanic eruptions, solar variations
and anthropogenic changes in the composition of the atmosphere and land-
use change are external forcings.
Extinction
The complete disappearance of an entire biological species.
Extreme weather event
An event that is rare at a particular place and time of year. Definitions of
“rare” vary, but an extreme weather event would normally be as rare as or
rarer than the 10th or 90th percentile of the observed probability density
function. By definition, the characteristics of what is called extreme weather
may vary from place to place in an absolute sense. Single extreme events
cannot be simply and directly attributed to anthropogenic climate change,
as there is always a finite chance the event in question might have oc-
curred naturally.When a pattern of extreme weather persists for some time,
such as a season, it may be classed as an extreme climate event, especially
if it yields an average or total that is itself extreme (e.g., drought or heavy
rainfall over a season).
F.
F-gases
This term refers to the groups of gases hydrofluorocarbons,
perfluorocarbons, and sulphurhexafluoride, which are covered under the
Kyoto Protocol.
Feedback
See Climate feedback.
Food security
A situation that exists when people have secure access to sufficient amounts
of safe and nutritious food for normal growth, development and an active
and healthy life. Food insecurity may be caused by the unavailability of
food, insufficient purchasing power, inappropriate distribution, or inad-
equate use of food at the household level.
Forcing

Forecast
See Climate forecast; Climate projection; Projection.
Forest
A vegetation type dominated by trees. Many definitions of the term forest
are in use throughout the world, reflecting wide differences in
biogeophysical conditions, social structure, and economics. Particular cri-
teria apply under the Kyoto Protocol. For a discussion of the term forest
and related terms such as afforestation, reforestation, and deforestation
see the IPCC Special Report on Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry
(IPCC, 2000). See also the Report on Definitions and Methodological
Options to Inventory Emissions from Direct Human-induced Degradation
of Forests and Devegetation of  Other Vegetation Types (IPCC, 2003)
Fossil fuels
Carbon-based fuels from fossil hydrocarbon deposits, including coal, peat,
oil, and natural gas.
Framework Convention on Climate Change
See United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC).
Frozen ground
Soil or rock in which part or all of the pore water is frozen (Van Everdingen,
1998). Frozen ground includes permafrost. Ground that freezes and thaws
annually is called seasonally frozen ground.
Fuel cell
A fuel cell generates electricity in a direct and continuous way from the
controlled electrochemical reaction of hydrogen or another fuel and oxy-
gen. With hydrogen as fuel it emits only water and heat (no carbon diox-
ide) and the heat can be utilised. See Combined Heat and Power.
Fuel switching
In general this is substituting fuel A for fuel B. In the climate change dis-
cussion it is implicit that fuel A has a lower carbon content than fuel B,
e.g. natural gas for coal.
G.
Glacial lake
A lake formed by glacier meltwater, located either at the front of a glacier
(known as a proglacial lake), on the surface of a glacier (supraglacial
lake), within the glacier (englacial lake) or at the glacier bed (subglacial
lake).
Glacier
A mass of land ice which flows downhill under gravity (through internal
deformation and/or sliding at the base) and is constrained by internal stress
and friction at the base and sides. A glacier is maintained by accumulation
of snow at high altitudes, balanced by melting at low altitudes or discharge
into the sea. See Mass balance
Global surface temperature
The global surface temperature is an estimate of the global mean surface
air temperature. However, for changes over time, only anomalies, as de-
partures from a climatology, are used, most commonly based on the area-
weighted global average of the sea surface temperature anomaly and land
surface air temperature anomaly.
Global Warming Potential (GWP)
An index, based upon radiative properties of well mixed greenhouse gases,
measuring the radiative forcing of a unit mass of a given well mixed green-
house gas in today’s atmosphere integrated over a chosen time horizon,
relative to that of carbon dioxide. The GWP represents the combined ef-
fect of the differing times these gases remain in the atmosphere and their
relative effectiveness in absorbing outgoing thermal infrared radiation.
The Kyoto Protocol is based on GWPs from pulse emissions over a 100-
year time frame.
Greenhouse effect
Greenhouse gases effectively absorb thermal infrared radiation, emitted
by the Earth’s surface, by the atmosphere itself due to the same gases, and
Appendix II
Glossary
82
by clouds. Atmospheric radiation is emitted to all sides, including down-
ward to the Earth’s surface. Thus greenhouse gases trap heat within the
surface-troposphere system. This is called the greenhouse effect.Thermal
infrared radiation in the troposphere is strongly coupled to the temperature
of the atmosphere at the altitude at which it is emitted. In the troposphere,
the temperature generally decreases with height. Effectively, infrared ra-
diation emitted to space originates from an altitude with a temperature of,
on average, –19°C, in balance with the net incoming solar radiation,
whereas the Earth’s surface is kept at a much higher temperature of, on
average, +14°C. An increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases leads
to an increased infrared opacity of the atmosphere, and therefore to an
effective radiation into space from a higher altitude at a lower tempera-
ture. This causes a radiative forcing that leads to an enhancement of the
greenhouse effect, the so-called enhanced greenhouse effect.
Greenhouse gas (GHG)
Greenhouse gases are those gaseous constituents of the atmosphere, both
natural and anthropogenic, that absorb and emit radiation at specific wave-
lengths within the spectrum of thermal infrared radiation emitted by the
Earth’s surface, the atmosphere itself, and by clouds. This property causes
the greenhouse effect. Water vapour (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous
oxide (N2O), methane (CH4) and ozone (O3) are the primary greenhouse
gases in the Earth’s atmosphere. Moreover, there are a number of entirely
human-made greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as the halocar-
bons and other chlorine and bromine containing substances, dealt with
under the Montreal Protocol. Beside CO2, N2O and CH4, the Kyoto Proto-
col deals with the greenhouse gases sulphur hexafluoride (SF6),
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs).
Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the monetary value of all goods and
services produced within a nation.
H.
Halocarbons
A collective term for the group of partially halogenated organic species,
including the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons
(HCFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), halons, methyl chloride, methyl
bromide, etc. Many of the halocarbons have large Global Warming Poten-
tials. The chlorine and bromine containing halocarbons are also involved
in the depletion of the ozone layer.
Human system
Any system in which human organisations play a major role. Often, but
not always, the term is synonymous with society or social system e.g.,
agricultural system, political system, technological system, economic sys-
tem; all are human systems in the sense applied in the Fourth Assessment
Report.
Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs)
See Halocarbons
Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)
One of the six greenhouse gases or groups of greenhouse gases to be curbed
under the Kyoto Protocol. They are produced commercially as a substitute
for chlorofluorocarbons. HFCs largely are used in refrigeration and semi-
conductor manufacturing. See Halocarbons
Hydrosphere
The component of the climate system comprising liquid surface and sub-
terranean water, such as oceans, seas, rivers, fresh water lakes, underground
water, etc.
Hydrological cycle
The cycle in which water evaporates from the oceans and the land surface,
is carried over the Earth in atmospheric circulation as water vapour, con-
densates to form clouds, precipitates again as rain or snow, is intercepted
by trees and vegetation, provides runoff on the land surface, infiltrates into
soils, recharges groundwater, discharges into streams, and ultimately, flows
out into the oceans, from which it will eventually evaporate again (AMS,
2000). The various systems involved in the hydrological cycle are usually
referred to as hydrological systems.
Hydrological systems
See Hydrological cycle
I.
Ice cap
A dome shaped ice mass, usually covering a highland area, which is con-
siderably smaller in extent than an ice sheet.
Ice core
A cylinder of ice drilled out of a glacier or ice sheet.
Ice sheet
A mass of land ice that is sufficiently deep to cover most of the underlying
bedrock topography, so that its shape is mainly determined by its dynam-
ics (the flow of the ice as it deforms internally and/or slides at its base). An
ice sheet flows outwards from a high central ice plateau with a small aver-
age surface slope. The margins usually slope more steeply, and most ice is
discharged through fast-flowing ice streams or outlet glaciers, in some
cases into the sea or into ice shelves floating on the sea. There are only
three large ice sheets in the modern world, one on Greenland and two on
Antarctica, the East and West Antarctic Ice Sheet, divided by the
Transantarctic Mountains. During glacial periods there were others.
(Climate change) Impact assessment
The practice of identifying and evaluating, in monetary and/or non-mon-
etary terms, the effects of climate change on natural and human systems.
(Climate change) Impacts
 The effects of climate change on natural and human systems. Depending
on the consideration of adaptation, one can distinguish between potential
impacts and residual impacts:
–
Potential impacts: all impacts that may occur given a projected
change in climate, without considering adaptation.
–
Residual impacts: the impacts of climate change that would oc
cur after adaptation.
See also aggregate impacts, market impacts, and non-market impacts.
Implementation
Implementation describes the actions taken to meet commitments under a
treaty and encompasses legal and effective phases.
Legal implementation refers to legislation, regulations, judicial decrees,
including other actions such as efforts to administer progress which gov-
ernments take to translate international accords into domestic law and
policy. Effective implementation needs policies and programmes that in-
duce changes in the behaviour and decisions of target groups. Target groups
then take effective measures of mitigation and adaptation. See also Com-
pliance.
Indigenous peoples
No internationally accepted definition of indigenous peoples exists. Com-
mon characteristics often applied under international law, and by United
Nations agencies to distinguish indigenous peoples include: residence within
or attachment to geographically distinct traditional habitats, ancestral ter-
ritories, and their natural resources; maintenance of cultural and social
identities, and social, economic, cultural and political institutions separate
from mainstream or dominant societies and cultures; descent from popula-
tion groups present in a given area, most frequently before modern states
or territories were created and current borders defined; and self-identifica-
tion as being part of a distinct indigenous cultural group, and the desire to
preserve that cultural identity.
Induced technological change

Industrial revolution
A period of rapid industrial growth with far-reaching social and economic
consequences, beginning in Britain during the second half of the eigh-
teenth century and spreading to Europe and later to other countries includ-
ing the United States. The invention of the steam engine was an important
trigger of this development. The industrial revolution marks the beginning
of a strong increase in the use of fossil fuels and emission of, in particular,
fossil carbon dioxide. In this Report the terms pre-industrial and indus-
trial refer, somewhat arbitrarily, to the periods before and after 1750,
respectively.
Inertia
In the context of climate change mitigation, inertia relates to the difficulty
of change resulting from pre-existing conditions within society such as
physical man-made capital, natural capital, and social non-physical capi-
tal, including institutions, regulations, and norms. Existing structures lock
in societies making change more difficult.
In the context of the climate system, inertia relates to the delay in climate
change after an external forcing has been applied, and to the continuation
of climate change even after the external forcing has been stabilised.
Infectious disease
Any disease caused by microbial agents that can be transmitted from one
person to another or from animals to people. This may occur by direct
physical contact, by handling of an object that has picked up infective
organisms, through a disease carrier, via contaminated water, or by spread
of infected droplets coughed or exhaled into the air.
Infrastructure
The basic equipment, utilities, productive enterprises, installations, and
services essential for the development, operation, and growth of an organi-
zation, city, or nation.
Integrated assessment
A method of analysis that combines results and models from the physical,
biological, economic and social sciences, and the interactions between these
components in a consistent framework to evaluate the status and the con-
sequences of environmental change and the policy responses to it. Models
used to carry out such analysis are called Integrated Assessment Models.
Integrated water resources management (IWRM)
The prevailing concept for water management which, however, has not
been defined unambiguously. IWRM is based on four principles that were
formulated by the International Conference on Water and the Environment
in Dublin, 1992: 1) fresh water is a finite and vulnerable resource, essen-
tial to sustain life, development and the environment; 2) water develop-
ment and management should be based on a participatory approach, in-
volving users, planners and policymakers at all levels; 3) women play a
central part in the provision, management and safeguarding of water; 4)
water has an economic value in all its competing uses and should be
recognised as an economic good.
Interglacials
The warm periods between ice age glaciations. The previous interglacial,
dated approximately from 129,000 to 116,000 years ago, is referred to as
Last Interglacial. (AMS, 2000)
J.
Joint Implementation (JI)
A market-based implementation mechanism defined in Article 6 of the
Kyoto Protocol, allowing Annex I countries or companies from these coun-
tries to implement projects jointly that limit or reduce emissions or en-
hance sinks, and to share the Emissions Reduction Units. JI activity is also
permitted in Article 4.2(a) of the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change (UNFCCC). See also Kyoto Mechanisms; Activities
Implemented Jointly.
K.
Kyoto Mechanisms (also called Flexibility Mechanisms)
Economic mechanisms based on market principles that parties to the Kyoto
Protocol can use in an attempt to lessen the potential economic impacts of
greenhouse gas emission-reduction requirements. They include Joint Imple-
mentation (Article 6), Clean Development Mechanism (Article 12), and
Emissions Trading (Article 17).
Kyoto Protocol
The Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Cli-
mate Change (UNFCCC) was adopted in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan, at the
Third Session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the UNFCCC. It
contains legally binding commitments, in addition to those included in the
UNFCCC. Countries included in Annex B of the Protocol (most Organiza-
tion for Economic Cooperation and Development countries and countries
with economies in transition) agreed to reduce their anthropogenic green-
house gas emissions (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide,
hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulphur hexafluoride) by at
least 5% below 1990 levels in the commitment period 2008 to 2012. The
Kyoto Protocol entered into force on 16 February 2005.
L.
Land use and Land-use change
Land use refers to the total of arrangements, activities and inputs under-
taken in a certain land cover type (a set of human actions). The term land
use is also used in the sense of the social and economic purposes for which
land is managed (e.g., grazing, timber extraction, and conservation).
Land-use change refers to a change in the use or management of land by
humans, which may lead to a change in land cover. Land cover and land-
use change may have an impact on the surface albedo, evapotranspira-
tion, sources and sinks of greenhouse gases, or other properties of the
climate system and may thus have a radiative forcing and/or other impacts
on climate, locally or globally. See also: the IPCC Report on Land Use,
Land-Use Change, and Forestry (IPCC, 2000).

Learning by Doing
As researchers and firms gain familiarity with a new technological pro-
cess, or acquire experience through expanded production they can dis-
cover ways to improve processes and reduce cost. Learning by Doing is a
type of experience-based technological change.
Level of Scientific Understanding (LOSU)
This is an index on a 5-step scale (high, medium, medium-low, low  and
very low) designed to characterise the degree of scientific understanding
of the radiative forcing agents that affect climate change. For each agent,
the index represents a subjective judgement about the evidence for the physi-
cal/chemical mechanisms determining  the forcing and the consensus sur-
rounding the quantitative estimate and its uncertainty.
Likelihood
The likelihood of an occurrence, an outcome or a result, where this can be
estimated probabilistically, is expressed in IPCC reports using a standard
terminology defined as follows:

Macroeconomic costs
These costs are usually measured as changes in Gross Domestic Product
or changes in the growth of Gross Domestic Product, or as loss of welfare
or of consumption.
Malaria
Endemic or epidemic parasitic disease caused by species of the genus Plas-
modium (Protozoa) and transmitted to humans by mosquitoes of the genus
Anopheles; produces bouts of high fever and systemic disorders, affects
about 300 million and kills approximately 2 million people worldwide
every year.
Market Exchange Rate (MER)
This is the rate at which foreign currencies are exchanged. Most econo-
mies post such rates daily and they vary little across all the exchanges. For
some developing economies official rates and black-market rates may dif-
fer significantly and the MER is difficult to pin down.
Market impacts
Impacts that can be quantified in monetary terms, and directly affect Gross
Domestic Product – e.g. changes in the price of agricultural inputs and/or
goods. See also Non-market impacts.
Market potential
See Mitigation potential.
Mass balance (of glaciers, ice caps or ice sheets)
The balance between the mass input to an  ice body (accumulation) and the
mass loss (ablation, iceberg calving). Mass balance terms include the
following:
Specific mass balance: net mass loss or gain over a hydrological cycle
at a point on the surface of a glacier.
Total mass balance (of the glacier):  The specific mass balance spa-
tially integrated over the entire glacier area; the total mass a glacier gains
or loses over a hydrological cycle.
Mean specific mass balance:  The total mass balance per unit area of
the glacier. If surface is specified (specific surface mass balance, etc.)
then ice-flow contributions are not considered; otherwise, mass balance
includes contributions from ice flow and iceberg calving. The specific sur-
face mass balance is positive in the accumulation area and negative in the
ablation area.
Mean Sea Level
Mean sea level is normally defined as the average relative sea level over a
period, such as a month or a year, long enough to average out transients
such as waves and tides. Relative sea level is sea level measured by a tide
gauge with respect to the land upon which it is situated.
See Sea level change/sea level rise.
Measures
Measures are technologies, processes, and practices that reduce green-
house gas emissions or effects below anticipated future levels. Examples
of measures are renewable energy technologies, waste minimisation pro-
cesses, and public transport commuting practices, etc. See also Policies.
Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC)
A zonally averaged, large scale meridional (north-south) overturning cir-
culation in the oceans. In the Atlantic such a circulation transports rela-
tively warm upper-ocean waters northward, and relatively cold deep wa-
ters southward. The Gulf Stream forms part of this Atlantic circulation.
Methane (CH4)
Methane is one of the six greenhouse gases to be mitigated under the Kyoto
Protocol and is the major component of natural gas and associated with all
hydrocarbon fuels, animal husbandry and agriculture. Coal-bed methane
is the gas found in coal seams.
Methane recovery
Methane emissions, e.g. from oil or gas wells, coal beds, peat bogs, gas
transmission pipelines, landfills, or anaerobic digesters, may be captured
and used as a fuel or for some other economic purpose (e.g. chemical feed-
stock).
Metric
A consistent measurement of a characteristic of an object or activity that is
otherwise difficult to quantify.
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)
A set of time-bound and measurable goals for combating poverty, hunger,
disease, illiteracy, discrimination against women and environmental deg-
radation, agreed at the UN Millennium Summit in 2000.
Mitigation
Technological change and substitution that reduce resource inputs and
emissions per unit of output. Although several social, economic and tech-
nological policies would produce an emission reduction, with respect to
Climate Change, mitigation means implementing policies to reduce green-
house gas emissions and enhance sinks.
Mitigative capacity
This is a country’s ability to reduce anthropogenic greenhouse gas emis-
sions or to enhance natural sinks, where ability refers to skills, competen-
cies, fitness and proficiencies that a country has attained and depends on
technology, institutions, wealth, equity, infrastructure and information.
Mitigative capacity is rooted in a country’s sustainable development path.
Mitigation Potential
In the context of climate change mitigation, the mitigation potential is the
amount of mitigation that could be – but is not yet – realised over time.
Market potential  is the mitigation potential based on private costs and
private discount rates, which might be expected to occur under forecast
market conditions, including policies and measures currently in place, not-
ing that barriers limit actual uptake. Private costs and discount rates re-
flect the perspective of private consumers and companies.
Economic potential is the mitigation potential that takes into account
social costs and benefits and social discount rates, assuming that market
efficiency is improved by policies and measures and barriers are removed.
Social costs and discount rates reflect the perspective of society. Social
discount rates are lower than those used by private investors.
Studies of market potential can be used to inform policy makers about
mitigation potential with existing policies and barriers, while studies of
economic potential show what might be achieved if appropriate new and
additional policies were put into place to remove barriers and include so-
cial costs and benefits. The economic potential is therefore generally greater
than the market potential.
Technical potential is the amount by which it is possible to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions or improve energy efficiency by implementing
a technology or practice that has already been demonstrated. No explicit
reference to costs is made but adopting ‘practical constraints’ may take
implicit economic considerations into account.

Monsoon
A monsoon is a tropical and subtropical seasonal reversal in both the sur-

Morbidity
Rate of occurrence of disease or other health disorder within a population,
taking account of the age-specific morbidity rates. Morbidity indicators
include chronic disease incidence/ prevalence, rates of hospitalisation, pri-
mary care consultations, disability-days (i.e., days of absence from work),
and prevalence of symptoms.
Mortality
Rate of occurrence of death within a population; calculation of mortality
takes account of age-specific death rates, and can thus yield measures of
life expectancy and the extent of premature death.
N.
Net market benefits
Climate change, especially moderate climate change, is expected to bring
positive and negative impacts to market-based sectors, but with signifi-
cant differences across different sectors and regions and depending on both
the rate and magnitude of climate change. The sum of the positive and
negative market-based benefits and costs summed across all sectors and
all regions for a given period is called net market benefits. Net market
benefits exclude any non-market impacts.
Nitrous oxide (N2O)
One of the six types of greenhouse gases to be curbed under the Kyoto
Protocol. The main anthropogenic source of nitrous oxide is agriculture
(soil and animal manure management), but important contributions also
come from sewage treatment, combustion of fossil fuel, and chemical in-
dustrial processes. Nitrous oxide is also produced naturally from a wide
variety of biological sources in soil and water, particularly microbial ac-
tion in wet tropical forests.

Non-market impacts
Impacts that affect ecosystems or human welfare, but that are not easily
expressed in monetary terms, e.g., an increased risk of premature death, or
increases in the number of people at risk of hunger. See also market im-
pacts.
O.
Ocean acidification
A decrease in the pH of sea water due to the uptake of anthropogenic
carbon dioxide.
Opportunities
Circumstances to decrease the gap between the market potential of any
technology or practice and the economic potential, or technical potential.
Ozone (O3)
Ozone, the tri-atomic form of oxygen, is a gaseous atmospheric constitu-
ent. In the troposphere, ozone is created both naturally and by photochemi-
cal reactions involving gases resulting from human activities (smog). Tro-
posphere ozone acts as a greenhouse gas. In the stratosphere, ozone is
created by the interaction between solar ultraviolet radiation and molecu-
lar oxygen (O2). Stratospheric ozone plays a dominant role in the strato-
spheric radiative balance. Its concentration is highest in the ozone layer.
P.
Paleoclimate
Climate during periods prior to the development of measuring instruments,
including historic and geologic time, for which only proxy climate records
are available.
Patterns of climate variability
Natural variability of the climate system, in particular on seasonal and
longer time scales, predominantly occurs with preferred spatial patterns
and time scales, through the dynamical characteristics of the atmospheric
circulation and through interactions with the land and ocean surfaces. Such
patterns are often called regimes, modes or teleconnections. Examples are
the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the Pacific-North American pattern
(PNA), the El Niño- Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Northern Annular
Mode (NAM; previously called Arctic Oscillation, AO) and the Southern
Annular Mode (SAM; previously called the Antarctic Oscillation, AAO).
Many of the prominent modes of climate variability are discussed in sec-
tion 3.6 of the Working Group I Report.
Percentile
A percentile is a value on a scale of zero to one hundred that indicates the
percentage of the data set values that is equal to or below it. The percentile
is often used to estimate the extremes of a distribution. For example, the
90th (10th) percentile may be used to refer to the threshold for the upper
(lower) extremes.
Perfluorocarbons (PFCs)
Among the six greenhouse gases to be abated under the Kyoto Protocol.
These are by-products of aluminium smelting and uranium enrichment.
They also replace chlorofluorocarbons in manufacturing semiconductors.
Permafrost
Ground (soil or rock and included ice and organic material) that remains at
or below 0°C for at least two consecutive years (Van Everdingen, 1998) .
See also Frozen ground.
pH
pH is a dimensionless measure of the acidity of water (or any solution).
Pure water has a pH=7. Acid solutions have a pH smaller than 7 and basic
solutions have a pH larger than 7. pH is measured on a logarithmic scale.
Thus, a pH decrease of 1 unit corresponds to a 10-fold increase in the
acidity.
Phenology
The study of natural phenomena in biological systems that recur periodi-
cally (e.g., development stages, migration) and their relation to climate
and seasonal changes.
Photosynthesis
The process by which green plants, algae and some bacteria take carbon
dioxide from the air (or bicarbonate in water) to build carbohydrates. There
are several pathways of photosynthesis with different responses to atmo-
spheric carbon dioxide concentrations. See Carbon dioxide fertilisation.
Plankton
Micro-organisms living in the upper layers of aquatic systems. A distinc-
tion is made between phytoplankton, which depend on photosynthesis for
their energy supply, and zooplankton, which feed on phytoplankton.
Policies
In United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)
parlance, policies are taken and/or mandated by a government – often in
conjunction with business and industry within its own country, or with
other countries – to accelerate mitigation and adaptation measures. Ex-
amples of policies are carbon or other energy taxes, fuel efficiency stan-
dards for automobiles, etc. Common and co-ordinated or harmonised poli-
cies refer to those adopted jointly by parties. See also Measures.
Portfolio
A coherent set of a variety of measures and/or technologies that policy
makers can use to achieve a postulated policy target. By widening the scope
in measures and technologies more diverse events and uncertainties can be
addressed.

Post-SRES (scenarios)
Baseline and mitigation emission scenarios published after completion of
the IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) (Nakic4enovic4 and
Swart, 2000), i.e. after the year 2000.
Pre-industrial
See Industrial revolution.
Projection
A potential future evolution of a quantity or set of quantities, often com-
puted with the aid of a model. Projections are distinguished from predic-
tions in order to emphasise that projections involve assumptions concern-
ing, for example, future socio-economic and technological developments
that may or may not be realised, and are therefore subject to substantial
uncertainty. See also Climate projection; Climate prediction.
Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)
The purchasing power of a currency is expressed using a basket of goods
and services that can be bought with a given amount in the home country.
International comparison of e.g. Gross Domestic Products (GDP) of coun-
tries can be based on the purchasing power of currencies rather than on
current exchange rates. PPP estimates tend to lower per capita GDPs in
industrialised countries and raise per capita GDPs in developing coun-
tries.
R.
Radiative forcing
Radiative forcing is the change in the net, downward minus upward, irra-
diance (expressed in Watts per square metre, W/m2) at the tropopause due
to a change in an external driver of climate change, such as, for example,
a change in the concentration of carbon dioxide or the output of the Sun.
Radiative forcing is computed with all tropospheric properties held fixed
at their unperturbed values, and after allowing for stratospheric tempera-
tures, if perturbed, to readjust to radiative-dynamical equilibrium. Radia-
tive forcing is called instantaneous if no change in stratospheric tempera-
ture is accounted for. For the purposes of this report, radiative forcing is
further defined as the change relative to the year 1750 and, unless other-
wise noted, refers to a global and annual average value.
Reforestation
Planting of forests on lands that have previously contained forests but that
have been converted to some other use. For a discussion of the term forest
and related terms such as afforestation, reforestation and deforestation,
see the IPCC Report on Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (IPCC,
2000). See also the Report on Definitions and Methodological Options to
Inventory Emissions from Direct Human-induced Degradation of Forests
and Devegetation of Other Vegetation Types (IPCC, 2003)
Region
A region is a territory characterised by specific geographical and climato-
logical features. The climate of a region is affected by regional and local
scale forcings like topography, land-use characteristics, lakes etc., as well
as remote influences from other regions.
Resilience
The ability of a social or ecological system to absorb disturbances while
retaining the same basic structure and ways of functioning, the capacity
for self-organisation, and the capacity to adapt to stress and change.
Retrofitting
Retrofitting means to install new or modified parts or equipment, or un-
dertake structural modifications, to existing infrastructure that were ei-
ther not available or not considered necessary at the time of construction.
The purpose of retrofitting in the context of climate change is generally to
ensure that existing infrastructure meets new design specifications that
may be required under altered climate conditions.
Runoff
That part of precipitation that does not evaporate and is not transpired, but
flows over the ground surface and returns to bodies of water. See Hydro-
logical cycle
S.
Salinisation
The accumulation of salts in soils.
Saltwater intrusion
Displacement of fresh surface water or groundwater by the advance of
saltwater due to its greater density. This usually occurs in coastal and es-
tuarine areas due to reducing land-based influence (e.g., either from re-
duced runoff and associated groundwater recharge, or from excessive wa-
ter withdrawals from aquifers) or increasing marine influence (e.g., rela-
tive sea-level rise).
Scenario
A plausible and often simplified description of how the future may de-
velop, based on a coherent and internally consistent set of assumptions
about driving forces and key relationships. Scenarios may be derived from
projections, but are often based on additional information from other
sources, sometimes combined with a narrative storyline. See also SRES
scenarios; Climate scenario; Emission scenarios.
Sea-ice biome
The biome formed by all marine organisms living within or on the floating
sea ice (frozen seawater) of the polar oceans.
Sea ice
Any form of ice found at sea that has originated from the freezing of sea
water. Sea ice may be discontinuous pieces (ice floes) moved on the ocean
surface by wind and currents (pack ice), or a motionless sheet attached to
the coast (land-fast ice). Sea ice less than one year old is called first-year
ice. Multi-year ice is sea ice that has survived at least one summer melt
season.
Sea level change/sea level rise
Sea level can change, both globally and locally, due to (i) changes in the
shape of the ocean basins, (ii) changes in the total mass of water and (iii)
changes in water density. Factors leading to sea level rise under global
warming include both increases in the total mass of water from the melting
of land-based snow and ice, and changes in water density from an increase
in ocean water temperatures and salinity changes. Relative sea level rise
occurs where there is a local increase in the level of the ocean relative to
the land, which might be due to ocean rise and/or land level subsidence.
See also Mean Sea Level, Thermal expansion.
Seasonally frozen ground
See Frozen ground
Sensitivity
Sensitivity is the degree to which a system is affected, either adversely or
beneficially, by climate variability or climate change. The effect may be
direct (e.g., a change in crop yield in response to a change in the mean,
range, or variability of temperature) or indirect (e.g., damages caused by
an increase in the frequency of coastal flooding due to sea level rise).
This concept of sensitivity is not to be confused with climate sensitivity,
which is defined separately above.
Singularity
A trait marking one phenomenon or aspect as distinct from others; some-
thing singular, distinct, peculiar, uncommon or unusual.
Sink
Any process, activity or mechanism which removes a greenhouse gas, an
aerosol or a precursor of a greenhouse gas or aerosol from the atmosphere.
Appendix II
Glossary
87
Snow pack
A seasonal accumulation of slow-melting snow.
Soil temperature
The temperature of the ground near the surface (often within the first
10cm).
Solar activity
The Sun exhibits periods of high activity observed in numbers of sunspots,
as well as radiative output, magnetic activity, and emission of high energy
particles. These variations take place on a range of time-scales from mil-
lions of years to minutes
Solar radiation
Electromagnetic radiation emitted by the Sun. It is also referred to as short-
wave radiation. Solar radiation has a distinctive range of wavelengths (spec-
trum) determined by the temperature of the Sun, peaking in visible wave-
lengths. See also Thermal infrared radiation, Total Solar Irradiance
Source
Source mostly refers to any process, activity or mechanism that releases a
greenhouse gas, an aerosol, or a precursor of a greenhouse gas or aerosol
into the atmosphere. Source can also refer to e.g. an energy source.
Spatial and temporal scales
Climate may vary on a large range of spatial and temporal scales. Spatial
scales may range from local (less than 100,000 km2), through regional
(100,000 to 10 million km2) to continental (10 to 100 million km2). Tem-
poral scales may range from seasonal to geological (up to hundreds of
millions of years).
SRES scenarios
SRES scenarios are emission scenarios developed by Nakic4enovic4 and
Swart (2000) and used, among others, as a basis for some of the climate
projections used in the Fourth Assessment Report. The following terms
are relevant for a better understanding of the structure and use of the set of
SRES scenarios:
Scenario Family: Scenarios that have a similar demographic, societal,
economic and technical-change storyline. Four scenario families comprise
the SRES scenario set: A1, A2, B1 and B2.
Illustrative Scenario: A scenario that is illustrative for each of the six
scenario groups reflected in the Summary for Policymakers of Nakic4enovic4
et al. (2000). They include four revised ‘scenario markers’ for the scenario
groups A1B, A2, B1, B2, and two additional scenarios for the A1FI and
A1T groups. All scenario groups are equally sound.
Marker Scenario: A scenario that was originally posted in draft form
on the SRES website to represent a given scenario family. The choice of
markers was based on which of the initial quantifications best reflected
the storyline, and the features of specific models. Markers are no more
likely than other scenarios, but are considered by the SRES writing team
as illustrative of a particular storyline. They are included in revised form
in Nakic4enovic4 and Swart (2000). These scenarios received the closest
scrutiny of the entire writing team and via the SRES open process. Sce-
narios were also selected to illustrate the other two scenario groups.
Storyline: A narrative description of a scenario (or family of scenarios),
highlighting the main scenario characteristics, relationships between key
driving forces and the dynamics of their evolution.
Stabilisation
Keeping constant the atmospheric concentrations of one or more green-
house gases (e.g. carbon dioxide) or of a CO2-equivalent basket of green-
house gases. Stabilisation analyses or scenarios address the stabilisation
of the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
Stakeholder
A person or an organisation that has a legitimate interest in a project or
entity, or would be affected by a particular action or policy.
Standards
Set of rules or codes mandating or defining product performance (e.g.,
grades, dimensions, characteristics, test methods, and rules for use). Prod-
uct, technology or performance standards establish minimum requirements
for affected products or technologies. Standards impose reductions in green-
house gas emissions associated with the manufacture or use of the prod-
ucts and/or application of the technology.
Storm surge
The temporary increase, at a particular locality, in the height of the sea due
to extreme meteorological conditions (low atmospheric pressure and/or
strong winds). The storm surge is defined as being the excess above the
level expected from the tidal variation alone at that time and place.
Storm tracks
Originally, a term referring to the tracks of individual cyclonic weather
systems, but now often generalised to refer to the regions where the main
tracks of extratropical disturbances occur as sequences of low (cyclonic)
and high (anticyclonic) pressure systems.
Stratosphere
The highly stratified region of the atmosphere above the troposphere ex-
tending from about 10 km (ranging from 9 km in high latitudes to 16 km in
the tropics on average) to about 50 km altitude.
Streamflow
Water flow within a river channel, for example expressed in m3/s. A syn-
onym for river discharge.
Structural change
Changes, for example, in the relative share of Gross Domestic Product
produced by the industrial, agricultural, or services sectors of an economy;
or more generally, systems transformations whereby some components are
either replaced or potentially substituted by other ones.
Sulphurhexafluoride (SF6)
One of the six greenhouse gases to be curbed under the Kyoto Protocol. It
is largely used in heavy industry to insulate high-voltage equipment and to
assist in the manufacturing of cable-cooling systems and semi-conductors.
Surface temperature
See Global surface temperature.
Sustainable Development (SD)
The concept of sustainable development was introduced in the World Con-
servation Strategy (IUCN 1980) and had its roots in the concept of a sus-
tainable society and in the management of renewable resources. Adopted
by the WCED in 1987 and by the Rio Conference in 1992 as a process of
change in which the exploitation of resources, the direction of investments,
the orientation of technological development, and institutional change are
all in harmony and enhance both current and future potential to meet hu-
man needs and aspirations. SD integrates the political, social, economic
and environmental dimensions.
T.
Tax
A carbon tax is a levy on the carbon content of fossil fuels. Because virtu-
ally all of the carbon in fossil fuels is ultimately emitted as carbon diox-
ide, a carbon tax is equivalent to an emission tax on each unit of CO2-
equivalent emissions. An energy tax - a levy on the energy content of fuels
- reduces demand for energy and so reduces carbon dioxide emissions from
fossil fuel use. An eco-tax is designed to influence human behaviour (spe-
cifically economic behaviour) to follow an ecologically benign path. An
international carbon/emission/energy tax is a tax imposed on specified
sources in participating countries by an international agreement. A
harmonised tax commits participating countries to impose a tax at a com-
mon rate on the same sources. A tax credit is a reduction of tax in order to
stimulate purchasing of or investment in a certain product, like GHG emis-
sion reducing technologies. A carbon charge is the same as a carbon tax.
Appendix II
Glossary
88
Technological change
Mostly considered as technological improvement, i.e. more or better goods
and services can be provided from a given amount of resources (produc-
tion factors). Economic models distinguish autonomous (exogenous), en-
dogenous and induced technological change. Autonomous (exogenous) tech-
nological change is imposed from outside the model, usually in the form
of a time trend affecting energy demand or world output growth. Endog-
enous technological change is the outcome of economic activity within
the model, i.e. the choice of technologies is included within the model and
affects energy demand and/or economic growth. Induced technological
change implies endogenous technological change but adds further changes
induced by policies and measures, such as carbon taxes triggering R&D
efforts.
Technology
The practical application of knowledge to achieve particular tasks that
employs both technical artefacts (hardware, equipment) and (social) in-
formation (‘software’, know-how for production and use of artefacts).
Technology transfer
The exchange of knowledge, hardware and associated software, money
and goods among stakeholders that leads to the spreading of technology
for adaptation or mitigation The term encompasses both diffusion of tech-
nologies and technological cooperation across and within countries.
Thermal expansion
In connection with sea-level rise, this refers to the increase in volume (and
decrease in density) that results from warming water. A warming of the
ocean leads to an expansion of the ocean volume and hence an increase in
sea level. See Sea level change.
Thermal infrared radiation
Radiation emitted by the Earth’s surface, the atmosphere and the clouds. It
is also known as terrestrial or longwave radiation, and is to be distin-
guished from the near-infrared radiation that is part of the solar spectrum.
Infrared radiation, in general, has a distinctive range of wavelengths (spec-
trum) longer than the wavelength of the red colour in the visible part of the
spectrum. The spectrum of thermal infrared radiation is practically dis-
tinct from that of shortwave or solar radiation because of the difference in
temperature between the Sun and the Earth-atmosphere system.
Tide gauge
A device at a coastal location (and some deep sea locations) that continu-
ously measures the level of the sea with respect to the adjacent land. Time
averaging of the sea level so recorded gives the observed secular changes
of the relative sea level. See Sea level change/sea level rise.
Top-down models
Top-down model apply macroeconomic theory, econometric and optimi-
zation techniques to aggregate economic variables. Using historical data
on consumption, prices, incomes, and factor costs, top-down models as-
sess final demand for goods and services, and supply from main sectors,
like the energy sector, transportation, agriculture, and industry. Some top-
down models incorporate technology data, narrowing the gap to bottom-
up models.
Total Solar Irradiance (TSI)
The amount of solar radiation received outside the Earth’s atmosphere on
a surface normal to the incident radiation, and at the Earth’s mean distance
from the sun. Reliable measurements of solar radiation can only be made
from space and the precise record extends back only to 1978. The gener-
ally accepted value is 1,368 Watts per square meter (W m-2) with an accu-
racy of about 0.2%. Variations of a few tenths of a percent are common,
usually associated with the passage of sunspots across the solar disk. The
solar cycle variation of TSI is on the order of 0.1%. Source: AMS, 2000.
Tradable permit
A tradable permit  is an economic policy instrument under which rights to
discharge pollution – in this case an amount of  greenhouse gas emissions
– can be exchanged through either a free or a controlled permit-market. An
emission permit is a non-transferable or tradable entitlement allocated by
a government to a legal entity (company or other emitter) to emit a speci-
fied amount of a substance.
Tropopause
The boundary between the troposphere and the stratosphere.
Troposphere
The lowest part of the atmosphere from the surface to about 10 km in
altitude in mid-latitudes (ranging from 9 km in high latitudes to 16 km in
the tropics on average), where clouds and weather phenomena occur. In
the troposphere, temperatures generally decrease with height.
U.
Uncertainty
An  expression of the degree to which a value (e.g., the future state of the
climate system) is unknown. Uncertainty can result from lack of informa-
tion or from disagreement about what is known or even knowable. It may
have many types of sources, from quantifiable errors in the data to am-
biguously defined concepts or terminology, or uncertain projections of
human behaviour. Uncertainty can therefore be represented by quantita-
tive measures, for example, a range of values calculated by various mod-
els, or by qualitative statements, for example, reflecting the judgement of
a team of experts (see Moss and Schneider, 2000; Manning et al., 2004).
See also Likelihood; Confidence.
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)
The Convention was adopted on 9 May 1992 in New York and signed at
the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro by more than 150 countries and
the European Community. Its ultimate objective is the “stabilisation of
greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would pre-
vent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system”. It
contains commitments for all Parties. Under the Convention, Parties in-
cluded in Annex I (all OECD member countries in the year 1990 and coun-
tries with economies in transition) aim to return greenhouse gas emissions
not controlled by the Montreal Protocol to 1990 levels by the year 2000. The
Convention entered in force in March 1994. See Kyoto Protocol.
Uptake
The addition of a substance of concern to a reservoir. The uptake of carbon
containing substances, in particular carbon dioxide, is often called (car-
bon) sequestration.
Urbanisation
The conversion of land from a natural state or managed natural state (such
as agriculture) to cities; a process driven by net rural-to-urban migration
through which an increasing percentage of the population in any nation or
region come to live in settlements that are defined as urban centres.
V.
Vector
An organism, such as an insect, that transmits a pathogen from one host to
another.
Voluntary action
Informal programmes, self-commitments and declarations, where the par-
ties (individual companies or groups of companies) entering into the ac-
tion set their own targets and often do their own monitoring and reporting.
Voluntary agreement
An agreement between a government authority and one or more private
parties to achieve environmental objectives or to improve environmental
performance beyond compliance to regulated obligations. Not all volun-
tary agreements are truly voluntary; some include rewards and/or penal-
ties associated with joining or achieving commitments.
Appendix II
Glossary
89
Vulnerability
Vulnerability is the degree to which a system is susceptible to, and unable
to cope with, adverse effects of climate change, including climate vari-
ability and extremes. Vulnerability is a function of the character, magni-
tude, and rate of climate change and variation to which a system is ex-
posed, its sensitivity, and its adaptive capacity.
W.
Water consumption
Amount of extracted water irretrievably lost during its use (by evaporation
and goods production). Water consumption is equal to water withdrawal
minus return flow.
Water stress
A country is water stressed if the available freshwater supply relative to
water withdrawals acts as an important constraint on development. In glo-
bal-scale assessments, basins with water stress are often defined as having
a per capita water availability below 1,000 m3/yr (based on long-term av-
erage runoff). Withdrawals exceeding 20% of renewable water supply have
also been used as an indicator of water stress. A crop is water stressed if
soil available water, and thus actual evapotranspiration, is less than po-
tential evapotranspiration demands.

CLIMATE CHANGE 2007 – SYNTHESIS REPORT
T
he Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was set up jointly by the World Meteorological Organization and the
United Nations Environment Programme to provide an authoritative international statement of scientific understanding of
climate change. The IPCC’s periodic assessments of the causes, impacts and possible response strategies to climate change are
the most comprehensive and up-to-date reports available on the subject, and form the standard reference for all concerned with
climate change in academia, government and industry worldwide. This Synthesis Report is the fourth element of the IPCC Fourth
Assessment Report “Climate Change 2007”. Through three working groups, many hundreds of international experts assess
climate change in this Report. The three working group contributions are available from Cambridge University Press:

Climate Change 2007 – Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability
Contribution of Working Group II to the Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC
(978 0521 88010-7 Hardback; 978 0521 70597-4 Paperback)
Climate Change 2007 – Mitigation of Climate Change
Contribution of Working Group III to the Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC
(978 0521 88011-4 Hardback; 978 0521 70598-1 Paperback)
Climate Change 2007 – Synthesis Report is based on the assessment carried out by the three Working Groups of the IPCC. It
provides an integrated view of climate change and addresses the following topics:
• Observed changes in climate and their effects
• Causes of change
• Climate change and its impacts in the near and long term under different scenarios
• Adaptation and mitigation options and responses, and the interrelationship with sustainable development, at global and
regional levels
• The long-term perspective: scientific and socio-economic aspects relevant to adaptation and mitigation, consistent with the
objectives and provisions of the Convention, and in the context of sustainable development
• Robust findings, key uncertainties
