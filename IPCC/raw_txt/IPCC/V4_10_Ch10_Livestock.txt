10 EMISSIONS FROM LIVESTOCK AND 
MANURE MANAGEMENT 
10.1 
INTRODUCTION 
This chapter provides guidance on methods to estimate emissions of methane from Enteric Fermentation in 
livestock, and methane and nitrous oxide emissions from Manure Management. CO2 emissions from livestock 
are not estimated because annual net CO2 emissions are assumed to be zero – the CO2 photosynthesized by 
plants is returned to the atmosphere as respired CO2.  A portion of the C is returned as CH4 and for this reason 
CH4 requires separate consideration.  
Livestock production can result in methane (CH4) emissions from enteric fermentation and both CH4 and nitrous 
oxide (N2O) emissions from livestock manure management systems.  Cattle are an important source of CH4 in 
many countries because of their large population and high CH4 emission rate due to their ruminant digestive 
system.  Methane emissions from manure management tend to be smaller than enteric emissions, with the most 
substantial emissions associated with confined animal management operations where manure is handled in 
liquid-based systems.  Nitrous oxide emissions from manure management vary significantly between the types of 
management system used and can also result in indirect emissions due to other forms of nitrogen loss from the 
system.  The calculation of the nitrogen loss from manure management systems is also an important step in 
determining the amount of nitrogen that will ultimately be available in manure applied to managed soils, or used 
for feed, fuel, or construction purposes – emissions that are calculated in Chapter 11, Section 11.2 (N2O 
emissions from managed soils).     
The methods for estimating CH4 and N2O emissions from livestock require definitions of livestock subcategories, 
annual populations and, for higher Tier methods, feed intake and characterisation. The procedures employed to 
define livestock subcategories, develop population data, and characterize feed are described in Section 10.2 
(Livestock Population and Feed Characterisation).  Suggested feed digestibility coefficients for various livestock 
categories have been provided to help estimation of feed intake for use in calculation of emissions from enteric 
and manure sources.  A coordinated livestock characterisation as described in Section 10.2 should be used to 
ensure consistency across the following source categories: 
• 
Section 10.3 - CH4 emissions from Enteric Fermentation; 
• 
Section 10.4 - CH4 emissions from Manure Management; 
• 
Section 10.5 - N2O emissions from Manure Management (direct and indirect); 
• 
Chapter 11, Section 11.2 - N2O emissions from Managed Soils (direct and indirect).

CHARACTERISATION 
10.2.1 
Steps to define categories and subcategories of 
livestock 
Good practice is to identify the appropriate method for estimating emissions for each source category, and then 
base the characterisation on the most detailed requirements identified for each livestock species. The livestock 
characterisation used by a country will probably undergo iterations as the needs of each source category are 
assessed during the emissions estimation process (see Figure 10.1, Decision Tree for Livestock Population 
Characterisation). The steps are: 
• 
Identify livestock species applicable to each emission source category: The livestock species that 
contribute to more than one emission source category should first be listed. These species are typically: 
cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, swine, horses, camels, mules/asses, and poultry. 
• 
Review the emission estimation method for each relevant source category: For the source categories of 
Enteric Fermentation and Manure Management, identify the emission estimating method for each species 
for that source category. For example, enteric fermentation emissions from cattle, buffalo, and sheep should 
each be examined to assess whether the trend or level of emissions warrant a Tier 2 or Tier 3 emissions 
estimate. Similarly, manure management methane emissions from cattle, buffalo, swine, and poultry should 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
10.8 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
be examined to determine whether the Tier 2 or Tier 3 emissions estimate is appropriate. Existing inventory 
estimates can be used to conduct this assessment. If no inventory has been developed to date, Tier 1 
emission estimates should be calculated to provide initial estimates for conducting this assessment. See 
Volume 1, Chapter 4 (Methodological Choice and Identification of Key Categories) for guidance on the 
general issues of methodological choice. 
• 
Identify the most detailed characterisation required for each livestock species: Based on the 
assessments for each species under each source category, identify the most detailed characterisation required 
to support each emissions estimate for each species. Typically, the ‘Basic’ characterisation can be used 
across all relevant source categories if the enteric fermentation and manure sources are both estimated with 
their Tier 1 methods. An ‘Enhanced’ characterisation should be used to estimate emissions across all the 
relevant sources if the Tier 2 method is used for either enteric fermentation or manure.   
10.2.2 
Choice of method  
TIER 1: BASIC CHARACTERISATION FOR LIVESTOCK POPULATIONS 
Basic characterisation for Tier 1 is likely to be sufficient for most animal species in most countries. For this 
approach it is good practice to collect the following livestock characterisation data to support the emissions 
estimates: 
Livestock species and categories: A complete list of all livestock populations that have default emission factor 
values must be developed (e.g., dairy cows, other cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, camels, llamas, alpacas, deer, 
horses, rabbits, mules and asses, swine, and poultry) if these categories are relevant to the country.  More 
detailed categories should be used if the data are available. For example, more accurate emission estimates can 
be made if poultry populations are further subdivided (e.g., layers, broilers, turkeys, ducks, and other poultry), as 
the waste characteristics among these different populations varies significantly.  
Annual population: If possible, inventory compilers should use population data from official national statistics 
or industry sources. Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) data can be used if national data are unavailable. 
Seasonal births or slaughters may cause the population size to expand or contract at different times of the year, 
which will require the population numbers to be adjusted accordingly. It is important to fully document the 
method used to estimate the annual population, including any adjustments to the original form of the population 
data as it was received from national statistical agencies or from other sources. 
Annual average populations are estimated in various ways, depending on the available data and the nature of the 
animal population.  In the case of static animal populations (e.g., dairy cows, breeding swine, layers), estimating 
the annual average population may be as simple as obtaining data related to one-time animal inventory data.  
However, estimating annual average populations for a growing population (e.g., meat animals, such as broilers, 
turkeys, beef cattle, and market swine) requires more evaluation.  Most animals in these growing populations are 
alive for only part of a complete year.  Animals should be included in the populations regardless if they were 
slaughtered for human consumption or die of natural causes. Equation 10.1 estimates the annual average of 
livestock population.

Where:

NAPA = number of animals produced annually 
Broiler chickens are typically grown approximately 60 days before slaughter.  Estimating the average annual 
population as the number of birds grown and slaughtered over the course of a year would greatly overestimate 
the population, as it would assume each bird lived the equivalent of 365 days.  Instead, one should estimate the 
average annual population as the number of animals grown divided by the number of growing cycles per year.  
For example, if broiler chickens are typically grown in flocks for 60 days, an operation could turn over 
approximately 6 flocks of chickens over the period of one year.  Therefore, if the operation grew 60,000 
chickens in a year, their average annual population would be 9,863 chickens. For this example the equation 
would be: 
Annual average population = 60 days ● 60,000 / 365 days / yr = 9,863 chickens

Dairy cows and milk production:  The dairy cow population is estimated separately from other cattle (see 
Table 10.1).  Dairy cows are defined in this method as mature cows that are producing milk in commercial 
quantities for human consumption.  This definition corresponds to the dairy cow population reported in the FAO 
Production Yearbook. In some countries the dairy cow population is comprised of two well-defined segments: (i) 
high-producing (also called improved) breeds in commercial operations; and (ii) low-producing cows managed 
with traditional methods.  These two segments can be combined, or can be evaluated separately by defining two 
dairy cow categories.  However, the dairy cow category does not include cows kept principally to produce calves 
for meat or to provide draft power.  Low productivity multi-purpose cows should be considered as other cattle. 
Dairy buffalo may be categorized in a similar manner to dairy cows. 
Data on the average milk production of dairy cows are also required. Milk production data are used in estimating 
an emission factor for enteric fermentation using the Tier 2 method. Country-specific data sources are preferred, 
but FAO data may also be used.  These data are expressed in terms of kilograms of whole fresh milk produced 
per year per dairy cow.  If two or more dairy cow categories are defined, the average milk production per cow is 
required for each category. 
TIER 2: ENHANCED CHARACTERISATION FOR LIVESTOCK 
POPULATIONS 
The Tier 2 livestock characterisation requires detailed information on: 
• 
Definitions for livestock subcategories; 
• 
Livestock population by subcategory, with consideration for estimation of annual population as per Tier 1; 
and 
• 
Feed intake estimates for the typical animal in each subcategory. 
The livestock population subcategories are defined to create relatively homogenous sub-groupings of animals. 
By dividing the population into these subcategories, country-specific variations in age structure and animal 
performance within the overall livestock population can be reflected. 
The Tier 2 characterisation methodology seeks to define animals, animal productivity, diet quality and 
management circumstances to support a more accurate estimate of feed intake for use in estimating methane 
production from enteric fermentation.  The same feed intake estimates should be used to provide harmonised 
estimates of manure and nitrogen excretion rates to improve the accuracy and consistency of CH4 and N2O 
emissions from manure management. 
Definitions for livestock subcategories 
It is good practice to classify livestock populations into subcategories for each species according to age, type of 
production, and sex. Representative livestock categories for doing this are shown in Table 10.1. Further 
subcategories are also possible:  
• 
Cattle and buffalo populations should be classified into at least three main subcategories: mature dairy, other 
mature, and growing cattle. Depending on the level of detail in the emissions estimation method, 
subcategories can be further classified based on animal or feed characteristics.  For example, growing / 
fattening cattle could be further subdivided into those cattle that are fed a high-grain diet and housed in dry 
lot vs. those cattle that are grown and finished solely on pasture.    
• 
Subdivisions similar to those used for cattle and buffalo can be used to further segregate the sheep 
population in order to create subcategories with relatively homogenous characteristics.   For example, 
growing lambs could be further segregated into lambs finished on pasture vs. lambs finished in a feedlot.  
The same approach applies to national goat herds.  
• 
Subcategories of swine could be further segregated based on production conditions.  For example, growing 
swine could be further subdivided into growing swine housed in intensive production facilities vs. swine that 
are grown under free-range conditions.   
• 
Subcategories of poultry could be further segregated based on production conditions.  For example, poultry 
could be divided on the basis of production under confined or free-range conditions.   
For large countries or for countries with distinct regional differences, it may be useful to designate regions and 
then define categories within those regions. Regional subdivisions may be used to represent differences in 
climate, feeding systems, diet, and manure management. However, this further segregation is only useful if 
correspondingly detailed data are available on feeding and manure management system usage by these livestock 
categories.

For each of the representative animal categories defined, the following information is required: 
• 
annual average population (number of livestock or poultry as per calculations for Tier 1); 
• 
average daily feed intake (megajoules (MJ) per day and / or kg per day of dry matter); and 
• 
methane conversion factor (percentage of feed energy converted to methane). 
Generally, data on average daily feed intake are not available, particularly for grazing livestock.   Consequently, 
the following general data should be collected for estimating the feed intake for each representative animal 
category: 
• 
weight (kg); 
• 
average weight gain per day (kg)1;  
• 
feeding situation: confined, grazing, pasture conditions;  
• 
milk production per day (kg/day) and fat content (%)2;  
• 
average amount of work performed per day (hours day-1); 
• 
percentage of females that give birth in a year3;   
• 
wool growth; 
• 
number of offspring; and 
• 
feed digestibility (%).  
 
Feed intake estimates  
Tier 2 emissions estimates require feed intakes for a representative animal in each subcategory. Feed intake is 
typically measured in terms of gross energy (e.g., megajoules (MJ) per day) or dry matter (e.g., kilograms (kg) 
per day).  Dry matter is the amount of feed consumed (kg) after it has been corrected for the water content in the 
complete diet.  For example, consumption of 10 kg of a diet that contains 70% dry matter would result in a dry 
matter intake of 7 kg.  To support the enteric fermentation Tier 2 method for cattle, buffalo, and sheep (see 
Section 10.3), detailed data requirements and equations to estimate feed intake are included in guidance below. 
Constants in the equations have been combined to simplify overall equation formats. The remainder of this 
subsection presents the typical data requirements and equations used to estimate feed intake for cattle, buffalo, 
and sheep. Feed intake for other species can be estimated using similar country-specific methods appropriate for 
each. 
 For all estimates of feed intake, good practice is to: 
• 
Collect data to describe the animal’s  typical diet and performance in each subcategory; 
• 
Estimate feed intake from the animal performance and diet data for each subcategory. 
In some cases, the equations may be applied on a seasonal basis, for example under conditions in which 
livestock gain weight in one season and lose weight in another.  This approach may require a more refined 
variation of   Tier 2 or more complex Tier 3 type methodology.  
The following animal performance data are required for each animal subcategory to estimate feed intake for the 
subcategory: 
• 
Weight (W), kg: Live-weight data should be collected for each animal subcategory. It is unrealistic to 
perform a complete census of live-weights, so live-weight data should be obtained from representative 
sample studies or statistical databases if these already exist. Comparing live-weight data with slaughter-
weight data is a useful cross-check to assess whether the live-weight data are representative of country 
conditions. However, slaughter-weight data should not be used in place of live-weight data as it fails to 
account for the complete weight of the animal.  Additionally, it should be noted that the relationship 
between live-weight and slaughter-weight varies with breed and body condition. For cattle, buffalo and 
                                                           
1 This may be assumed to be zero for mature animals. 
2 Milk production data  are required for dairy animals. These can be estimated for non-dairy animals providing milk to 
young, where data are available. 
3 This is only relevant for mature females. 
 Chapter 10: Emissions from Livestock and Manure Management 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
10.13 
mature sheep, the yearly average weight for each animal category (e.g., mature beef cows) is needed. For 
young sheep, weights are needed at birth, weaning, one year of age or at slaughter if slaughter occurs within 
the year. 
• 
Average weight gain per day (WG), kg day-1: Data on average weight gain are generally collected for 
feedlot animals and young growing animals. Mature animals are generally assumed to have no net weight 
gain or   loss over an entire year. Mature animals frequently lose weight during the dry season or during 
temperature extremes and gain weight during the following season. However, increased emissions 
associated with this weight change are likely to be small.  Reduced intakes and emissions associated with 
weight loss are largely balanced by increased intakes and emissions during the periods of gain in body 
weight.   
• 
Mature weight (MW), kg: The mature weight of the adult animal of the inventoried group is required to 
define a growth pattern, including the feed and energy required for growth.  For example, mature weight of a 
breed or category of cattle or buffalo is generally considered to be the body weight at which skeletal 
development is complete.   The mature weight will vary among breeds and should reflect the animal’s 
weight when in moderate body condition. This is termed ‘reference weight’ (ACC, 1990) or ‘final shrunk 
body weight’ (NRC, 1996).  Estimates of mature weight are typically available from livestock specialists 
and producers.  
• 
Average number of hours worked per day: For draft animals, the average number of hours worked per 
day must be determined. 
• 
Feeding situation: The feeding situation that most accurately represents the animal subcategory must be 
determined using the definitions shown below (Table 10.5). If the feeding situation lies between the 
definitions, the feeding situation should be described in detail. This detailed information may be needed 
when calculating the enteric fermentation emissions, because interpolation between the feeding situations 
may be necessary to assign the most appropriate coefficient. Table 10.5 defines the feeding situations for 
cattle, buffalo, and sheep. For poultry and swine, the feeding situation is assumed to be under confinement 
conditions and consequently the activity coefficient (Ca )is assumed to be zero as under these conditions 
very little energy is expended in acquiring feed.  Activity coefficients have not been developed for free-
ranging swine or poultry, but in most instances these livestock subcategories are likely to represent a small 
proportion of the national inventory. 
• 
Mean winter temperature (ºC): Detailed feed intake models consider ambient temperature, wind speed, 
hair and tissue insulation and the heat of fermentation (NRC, 2001; AAC, 1990) and are likely more 
appropriate in Tier 3 applications.  A more general relationship adapted from North America data suggest 
adjusting the Cfi of Equation 10.3 for maintenance requirements of open-lot fed cattle in colder climates  
according to the following equation (Johnson, 1986):

Where:

°C = mean daily temperature during winter season 
Considering the average temperature during winter months, net energy for maintenance (NEm) requirements 
may increase by as much as 30% in northern North America.  This increase in feed use for maintenance is 
also likely associated with greater methane emissions. 
     
• 
Average daily milk production (kg day-1): These data are for milking ewes, dairy cows and buffalo. The 
average daily production should be calculated by dividing the total annual production by 365, or reported as 
average daily production along with days of lactation per year, or estimated using seasonal production 
divided by number of days per season. If using seasonal production data, the emission factor must be 
developed for that seasonal period. 
• 
Fat content (%): Average fat content of milk is required for lactating cows, buffalo, and sheep producing 
milk for human consumption. 
• 
Percent of females that give birth in a year: This is collected only for mature cattle, buffalo, and sheep.

• 
Number of off spring produced per year:  This is relevant to female livestock that have multiple births per 
year (e.g., ewes). 
• 
Feed digestibility (DE%): The portion of gross energy (GE) in the feed not excreted in the faeces is known 
as digestible feed. The feed digestibility is commonly expressed as a percentage (%) of GE or TDN (total 
digestible nutrients).   That percentage of feed that is not digested represents the % of dry matter intake that 
will be excreted as faeces. Typical digestibility values for a range of livestock classes and diet types are 
presented in Table 10.2 as a guideline.  For ruminants, common ranges of feed digestibility are 45-55% for 
crop by-products and range lands; 55-75% for good pastures, good preserved forages, and grain 
supplemented forage-based diets; and 75-85% for grain-based diets fed in feedlots. Variations in diet 
digestibility results in major variations in the estimate of feed needed to meet animal requirements and 
consequently associated methane emissions and amounts of manure excreted.  It is also important to note 
that digestibility, intake, and growth are co-dependent phenomena.  For example, a low digestibility will 
lead to lower feed intake and consequently reduced growth. Conversely, feeds with high digestibility will 
often result in a higher feed intake and increased growth. A 10% error in estimating DE will be magnified to 
12 to 20% when estimating methane emissions and even more (20 to 45%) for manure excretion (volatile 
solids).   
Digestibility data should be based on measured values for the dominant feeds or forages being consumed by 
livestock with consideration for seasonal variation. In general, the digestibility of forages decreases with 
increasing maturity and is typically lowest during the dry season.  Due to significant variation, digestibility 
coefficients should be obtained from local scientific data wherever possible.  Although a complete census of 
digestibility is considered unrealistic, at a minimum digestibility data from research studies should be 
consulted. While developing the digestibility data, associated feed characteristic data should also be 
recorded when available, such as measured values for Neutral Detergent Fiber (NDF), Acid Detergent Fiber 
(ADF), crude protein, and the presence of anti-nutritional factors (e.g., alkaloids, phenolics, % ash). NDF 
and ADF are feed characteristics measured in the laboratory that are used to indicate the nutritive value of 
the feed for ruminant livestock. Determination of these values can enable DE to be predicted as defined in 
the recent dairy NRC (2001).  The concentration of crude protein in the feed can be used in the process of 
estimating nitrogen excretion (Section 10.5.2). 
• 
Average annual wool production per sheep (kg yr-1): The amount of wool produced in kilograms (after 
drying out but before scouring) is needed to estimate the amount of energy allocated for wool production.

1 The range in digestibility of feed consumed by free-range swine and poultry is extremely variable due to the selective 
nature of these diets.  Often it is likely that the amount of manure produced in these classes will be limited by the amount 
of feed available for consumption as opposed to its degree of digestibility.  In instances where feed is not limiting and high 
quality feed sources are readily accessible for consumption, digestibility may approach values that are similar to those 
measured under confinement conditions.

Gross energy calculations 
Animal performance and diet data are used to estimate feed intake, which is the amount of energy (MJ/day) an 
animal needs for maintenance and for activities such as growth, lactation, and pregnancy. For inventory 
compilers who have well-documented and recognised country-specific methods for estimating intake based on 
animal performance data, it is good practice to use the country-specific methods. The following section provides 
methods for estimating gross energy intake for the key ruminant categories of cattle, buffalo and sheep.  The 
equations listed in Table 10.3 are used to derive this estimate. If no country-specific methods are available, 
intake should be calculated using the equations listed in Table 10.3. As shown in the table, separate equations are 
used to estimate net energy requirements for sheep as compared with cattle and buffalo. The equations used to 
calculate GE are as follows:

Net energy for maintenance: (NEm ) is the net energy required for maintenance, which is the amount of energy 
needed to keep the animal in equilibrium where body energy is neither gained nor lost (Jurgen, 1988).

Net energy for activity: (NEa) is the net energy for activity, or the energy needed for animals to obtain their food, 
water and shelter. It is based on its feeding situation rather than characteristics of the feed itself. As presented in 
Table 10.3, the equation for estimating NEa for cattle and buffalo is different from the equation used for sheep.  
Both equations are empirical with different definitions for the coefficient Ca.

Net energy for lactation: (NEl ) is the net energy for lactation. For cattle and buffalo the net energy for lactation 
is expressed as a function of the amount of milk produced and its fat content expressed as a percentage (e.g., 4%)

Where:

Fat  = fat content of milk, % by weight. 
Two methods for estimating the net energy required for lactation (NEl) are presented for sheep. The first method 
(Equation 10.9) is used when the amount of milk produced is known, and the second method (Equation 10.8) is 
used when the amount of milk produced is not known. Generally, milk production is known for ewes kept for 
commercial milk production, but it is not known for ewes that suckle their young to weaning. With a known 
amount of milk production, the total annual milk production is divided by 365 days to estimate the average daily 
milk production in kg/day (Equation 10.9). When milk production is not known, AFRC (1990) indicates that for 
a single birth, the milk yield is about 5 times the weight gain of the lamb. For multiple births, the total annual 
milk production can be estimated as five times the combined weight gain of all lambs birthed by a single ewe. 
The daily average milk production is estimated by dividing the resulting estimate by 365 days as shown in 
Equation 10.10.

Net energy for work: (NEwork ) is the net energy for work. It is used to estimate the energy required for draft 
power for cattle and buffalo. Various authors have summarised the energy intake requirements for providing 
draft power (e.g., Lawrence, 1985; Bamualim and Kartiarso, 1985; and Ibrahim, 1985). The strenuousness of the 
work performed by the animal influences the energy requirements, and consequently a wide range of energy 
requirements have been estimated. The values by Bamualim and Kartiarso show that about 10 percent of a day’s 
NEm requirements are required per hour for typical work for draft animals. This value is used as follows:

Productionwool = annual wool production per sheep, kg yr-1 
 
Net energy for pregnancy: (NEp) is the energy required for pregnancy. For cattle and buffalo, the total energy 
requirement for pregnancy for a 281-day gestation period averaged over an entire year is calculated as 10% of 
NEm. For sheep, the NEp requirement is similarly estimated for the 147-day gestation period, although the 
percentage varies with the number of lambs born (Table 10.7, Constant for Use in Calculating NEp in Equation 
10.13). Equation 10.13 shows how these estimates are applied.

When using NEp to calculate GE for cattle and sheep, the NEp estimate must be weighted by the portion of the 
mature females that actually go through gestation in a year. For example, if 80% of the mature females in the 
animal category give birth in a year, then 80% of the NEp value would be used in the GE equation below. 
To determine the proper coefficient for sheep, the portion of ewes that have single births, double births, and 
triple births is needed to estimate an average value for Cpregnancy. If these data are not available, the coefficient 
can be calculated as follows: 
• 
If the number of lambs born in a year divided by the number of ewes that are pregnant in a year is less than 
or equal to 1.0, then the coefficient for single births can be used. 
• 
If the number of lambs born in a year divided by the number of ewes that are pregnant in a year exceeds 1.0 
and is less than 2.0, calculate the coefficient as follows: 
Cpregnancy = [(0.126  •  Double birth fraction) + (0.077 •  Single birth fraction)] 
Where: 
Double birth fraction = [(lambs born / pregnant ewes) – 1] 
Single birth fraction = [1 – Double birth fraction]

Once the values for GE are calculated for each animal subcategory, the feed intake in units of kilograms of dry 
matter per day (kg day-1) should also be calculated.  To convert from GE in energy units to dry matter intake 
(DMI), divide GE by the energy density of the feed. A default value of 18.45 MJ kg-1 of dry matter can be used 
if feed-specific information is not available. The resulting daily dry matter intake should be in the order of 2% to 
3% of the body weight of the mature or growing animals.  In high producing milk cows, intakes may exceed 4% 
of body weight.

Feed intake estimates using a simplified Tier 2 method 
Prediction of DMI for cattle based on body weight and estimated dietary net energy concentration (NEma) or 
digestible energy values (DE%): It is also possible to predict dry matter intake for mature and growing cattle 
based on body weight of the animal and either the NEma concentration of the feed (NRC, 1996) or  DE%.  
Dietary NEma concentration can range from 3.0 to 9.0 MJ kg-1 of dry matter.  Typical values for high, moderate 
and low quality diets are presented in Table 10.8.  These figures can also be used to estimate NEma values for 
mixed diets based on estimate of diet quality.  For example, a mixed forage-grain diet could be assumed to have 
a NEma value similar to that of a high-quality forage diet.  A mixed grain-straw diet could be assumed to have a 
NEma value similar to that of a moderate quality forage.  Nutritionists within specific geographical areas should 
be able to provide advice with regard to the selection of NEma values that are more representative of locally fed 
diets.

Equations 10.17, 10.18a, and 10.18b provide a good check to the main Tier 2 method to predict feed intake.  
They can be viewed as asking ‘what is an expected intake for a given diet quality?’ and used to independently 
predict DMI from BW and diet quality (NEma or DE%).  In contrast, the main Tier 2 method predicts DMI based 
on how much feed must be consumed to meet estimated requirements (i.e., NEm and NEg) and does not consider 
the biological capacity of the animal to in fact consume the predicted quantity of feed.   Consequently, the 
simplified Tier 2 method can be used to confirm that DMI values derived from the main Tier 2 method are 
biologically realistic.  These estimates are also subject to the cross check that dry matter intake should be in the 
order of 2% to 3% of the bodyweight of the mature or growing animals.

10.2.3 
Uncertainty assessment  
The first step in collecting data should be to investigate existing national statistics, industry sources, research 
studies and FAO statistics. The uncertainty associated with populations will vary widely depending on source, 
but should be known within +20%.  Often, national livestock population statistics already have associated 
uncertainty estimates in which case these should be used.   If published data are not available from these sources, 
interviews of key industry and academic experts can be undertaken. Estimates of digestibility are also 
particularly important in Tier 2 estimates of gross energy intake.  Uncertainty estimates for digestibility 
estimates may be as high as +20%.  Volume 1, Chapter 3 (Uncertainties) describes how to elicit expert 
judgement for uncertainty ranges. Similar expert elicitation protocols can be used to obtain the information 
required for the livestock characterisation if published data and statistics are not available. 
10.2.4 
Characterisation for livestock without species: 
Specific emission estimation methods 
Some countries may have domesticated livestock for which there are currently no Tier 1 or Tier 2 emissions 
estimating methods (e.g., llamas, alpacas, wapiti, emus, and ostriches). Good practice in estimating emissions 
from these livestock is to first assess whether their emissions are likely to be significant enough to warrant 
characterising them and developing country-specific emission factors. Volume 1, Chapter 4 (Methodological 
Choice and Identification of Key Categories) presents guidance for assessing the significance of individual 
source categories within the national inventory. Similar approaches can be used to assess the importance of sub-
source categories (i.e. species) within a source category. If the emissions from a particular sub-species are 
determined to be significant, then country-specific emission factors should be developed, and a characterisation 
should be performed to support the development of the emission factors. Research into the estimation of 
emission levels from these non-characterized species should be encouraged.  The data and methods used to 
characterise the animals should be well documented. 
As emissions estimation methods are not available for these animals, approximate emission factors based on 
‘order of magnitude calculations’ are appropriate for conducting the assessment of the significance of their 
emissions. One approach for developing the approximate emission factors is to use the Tier 1 emissions factor 
for an animal with a similar digestive system and to scale the emissions factor using the ratio of the weights of 
the animals raised to the 0.75 power. The Tier 1 emission factors can be classified by digestive system as follows: 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
10.24 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
• 
Ruminant animals: Cattle, Buffalo, Sheep, Goats, Camels 
• 
Non-ruminant herbivores: Horses, Mules/Asses 
• 
Poultry: Chickens, Ducks, Turkeys, Geese 
• 
Non-poultry monogastric animals: Swine 
For example, an approximate enteric fermentation methane emissions factor for alpacas could be estimated from 
the emissions factor for sheep (also a ruminant animal) as follows: 
 
Approximate emissions factor = [(alpaca weight) / (sheep weight)]0.75  •  sheep emissions factor 
Similarly, an approximate manure methane emissions factor for ostriches could be estimated using the Tier 1 
emission factor for chickens. Approximate emission factors developed using this method can only be used to 
assess the significance of the emissions from the animals, and are not considered sufficiently accurate for 
estimating emissions as part of a national inventory. 
10.3 
METHANE EMISSIONS FROM ENTERIC 
FERMENTATION 
Methane is produced in herbivores as a by-product of enteric fermentation, a digestive process by which 
carbohydrates are broken down by micro-organisms into simple molecules for absorption into the bloodstream.  
The amount of methane that is released depends on the type of digestive tract, age, and weight of the animal, and 
the quality and quantity of the feed consumed.  Ruminant livestock (e.g., cattle, sheep) are major sources of 
methane with moderate amounts produced from non-ruminant livestock (e.g., pigs, horses).  The ruminant gut 
structure fosters extensive enteric fermentation of their diet.   
Digestive system 
The type of digestive system has a significant influence on the rate of methane emission.  Ruminant livestock 
have an expansive chamber, the rumen, at the fore-part of their digestive tract that supports intensive microbial 
fermentation of their diet which yields several nutritional advantages including the capacity to digest cellulose in 
their diet. The main ruminant livestock are cattle, buffalo, goats, sheep, deer and camelids.  Non-ruminant 
livestock (horses, mules, asses) and monogastric livestock (swine) have relatively lower methane emissions 
because much less methane-producing fermentation takes place in their digestive systems. 
Feed intake 
Methane is produced by the fermentation of feed within the animal's digestive system. Generally, the higher the 
feed intake, the higher the methane emission. Although, the extent of methane production may also be affected 
by the composition of the diet. Feed intake is positively related to animal size, growth rate, and production (e.g., 
milk production, wool growth, or pregnancy). 
To reflect the variation in emission rates among animal species, the population of animals should be divided into 
subgroups, and an emission rate per animal is estimated for each subgroup.  Types of population subgroups are 
provided in Section 10.2 (Livestock and Feed Characterisation).  The amount of methane emitted by a 
population subgroup is calculated by multiplying the emission rate per animal by the number of animals within 
the subgroup. 
Natural wild ruminants are not considered in the derivation of a country’s emission estimate.  Emissions should 
only be considered from animals under domestic management (e.g., farmed deer, elk, and buffalo).  
10.3.1 
Choice of method 
It is good practice to choose the method for estimating methane emissions from enteric fermentation according 
to the decision tree in Figure 10.2. The method for estimating methane emission from enteric fermentation 
requires three basic steps:

2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Step 1: Divide the livestock population into subgroups and characterize each subgroup as described in Section 
10.2.  It is recommended that national experts use annual averages estimated with consideration for the impact of 
production cycles and seasonal influences on population numbers.   
Step 2: Estimate emission factors for each subgroup in terms of kilograms of methane per animal per year. 
Step 3: Multiply the subgroup emission factors by the subgroup populations to estimate subgroup emission, and 
sum across the subgroups to estimate total emission. 
These three steps can be performed at varying levels of detail and complexity.  This chapter presents the 
following three approaches: 
Tier 1 
A simplified approach that relies on default emission factors either drawn from the literature or calculated using 
the more detailed Tier 2 methodology.  The Tier 1 method is likely to be suitable for most animal species in 
countries where enteric fermentation is not a key source category, or where enhanced characterization data are 
not available.  When approximate enteric emissions are derived by extrapolation from main livestock categories 
they should be considered to be a Tier 1 method. 
Tier 2 
A more complex approach that requires detailed country-specific data on gross energy intake and methane 
conversion factors for specific livestock categories.  The Tier 2 method should be used if enteric fermentation is 
a key source category for the animal category that represents a large portion of the country’s total emissions.  
Tier 3  
Some countries for which livestock emissions are particularly important may wish to go beyond the Tier 2 
method and incorporate additional country-specific information in their estimates.  This approach could employ 
the development of sophisticated models that consider diet composition in detail, concentration of products 
arising from ruminant fermentation, seasonal variation in animal population or feed quality and availability, and 
possible mitigation strategies. Many of these estimates would be derived from direct experimental measurements.  
Although countries are encouraged to go beyond the Tier 2 method presented below when data are available, 
these more complex analyses are only briefly discussed here.   A Tier 3 method should be subjected to a wide 
degree of international peer review such as that which occurs in peer-reviewed publications to ensure that they 
improve the accuracy and / or precision of estimates.  
Countries with large populations of domesticated animal species for which there are no IPCC default emission 
factors (e.g., llamas and alpacas) are encouraged to develop national methods that are similar to the Tier 2 
method and are based on well-documented research (if it is determined that emissions from these livestock are 
significant).  The approach is described in Section 10.2.4 under the heading ‘Characterisation for livestock 
without species-specific emission estimation methods’ for more information. 
Table 10.9 summarises the suggested approaches for the livestock emissions included in this inventory. 
10.3.2 
Choice of emission factors 
Tier 1 Approach for methane emissions from Enteric Fermentation 
This Tier 1 method is simplified so that only readily-available animal population data are needed to estimate 
emissions.  Default emission factors are presented for each of the recommended population subgroups.  Each 
step is discussed in turn. 
Step 1: Animal population 
The animal population data should be obtained using the approach described in Section 10.2.  
Step 2: Emission factors 
The purpose of this step is to select emission factors that are most appropriate for the country's livestock 
characteristics. Default emission factors for enteric fermentation have been drawn from previous studies, and are 
organised by region for ease of use.  
The data used to estimate the default emission factors for enteric fermentation are presented in Annex 10A.1 at 
the end of this section.

a The Tier 2 method is recommended for countries with large livestock populations.  Implementing 
the Tier 2 method for additional livestock subgroups may be desirable when the category emissions 
are a large portion of total methane emissions for the country. 
 
Table 10.10 shows the enteric fermentation emission factors for each of the animal species except cattle.  As 
shown in the table, emission factors for sheep and swine vary for developed and developing countries.  The 
differences in the emission factors are driven by differences in feed intake and feed characteristic assumptions 
(see Annex 10A.1).  Table 10.11 presents the enteric fermentation emission factors for cattle.  A range of 
emission factors is shown for typical regional conditions.  As shown in the table, the emission factors vary by 
over a factor of four on a per head basis. 
While the default emission factors shown in Table 10.11 are broadly representative of the emission rates within 
each of the regions described, emission factors vary within each region. Animal size and milk production are 
important determinants of emission rates for dairy cows.  Relatively smaller dairy cows with low levels of 
production are found in Asia, Africa, and the Indian subcontinent.  Relatively larger dairy cows with high levels 
of production are found in North America and Western Europe. 
Animal size and population structure are important determinants of emission rates for other cattle.  Relatively 
smaller other cattle are found in Asia, Africa, and the Indian subcontinent.  Also, many of the other cattle in 
these regions are young.  Other cattle in North America, Western Europe and Oceania are larger, and young 
cattle constitute a smaller portion of the population. 
To select emission factors from Tables 10.10 and 10.11, identify the region most applicable to the country being 
evaluated. Scrutinise the tabulations in Annex 10A.1 to ensure that the underlying animal characteristics such as 
weight, growth rate and milk production used to develop the emission factors are similar to the conditions in the 
country. The data collected on the average annual milk production by dairy cows should be used to help select a 
dairy cow emission factor. If necessary, interpolate between dairy cow emission factors shown in the table using 
the data collected on average annual milk production per head.  
Note that using the same Tier 1 emission factors for the inventories of successive years means that no allowance 
is being made for changing livestock productivity, such as increasing milk productivity or trend in live weight. If 
it is important to capture the trend in methane emission that results from a trend in livestock productivity, then 
livestock emissions can become a key source category based on trend and a Tier 2 calculation should be used.

1 One approach for developing the approximate emission factors is to use the Tier 1 emissions factor for an animal with a similar 
digestive system and to scale the emissions factor using the ratio of the weights of the animals raised to the 0.75 power. Liveweight 
values have been included for this purpose. Emission factors should be derived on the basis of characteristics of the livestock and feed 
of interest and should not be restricted solely to within regional characteristics. 
 
Step 3: Total emission 
To estimate total emission, the selected emission factors are multiplied by the associated animal population 
(Equation 10.19) and summed (Equation 10.20):

Tier 2 Approach for methane emissions from Enteric Fermentation 
The Tier 2 method is applied to more disaggregated livestock population categories and used to calculate 
emission factors, as opposed to default values. The key considerations for the Tier 2 method are the development 
of emission factors and the collection of detailed activity data.  
Step 1: Livestock population 
The animal population data and related activity data should be obtained following the approach described in 
Section 10.2. 
Step 2: Emission factors 
When the Tier 2 method is used, emission factors are estimated for each animal category using the detailed data 
developed in Step 1.  
The emission factors for each category of livestock are estimated based on the gross energy intake and methane 
conversion factor for the category. The gross energy intake data should be obtained using the approach described 
in Section 10.2.  The following two sub-steps need to be completed to calculate the emission factor under the 
Tier 2 method: 
1. Obtaining the methane conversion factor (Ym) 
The extent to which feed energy is converted to CH4 depends on several interacting feed and animal factors. If 
CH4 conversion factors are unavailable from country-specific research, the values provided in Table 10.12, 
Cattle/Buffalo CH4 conversion factors, can be used for cattle and buffalo. These general estimates are a rough 
guide based on the general feed characteristics and production practices found in many developed and 
developing countries. When good feed is available (i.e., high digestibility and high energy value) the lower 
bounds should be used. When poorer feed is available, the higher bounds are more appropriate. A CH4 
conversion factor of zero is assumed for all juveniles consuming only milk (i.e., milk-fed lambs as well as 
calves). 
Due to the importance of Ym in driving emissions, substantial ongoing research is aimed at improving estimates 
of Ym for different livestock and feed combinations. Such improvement is most needed for animals fed on 
tropical pastures as the available data are sparse.   For example, a recent study (Kurihara et al., 1999) observed 
Ym values outside the ranges described in Table 10.12.

Regional, national and global estimates of enteric methane generation rely on small scale determinations both of 
Ym and of the influence of feed and animal properties upon Ym.  Traditional methods for measuring Ym include 
the use of respiration calorimeters for housing individual animals (Johnson and Johnson, 1995). A tracer 
technique using SF6 enables methane emissions from individual animals to be estimated under both housed or 
grazing conditions (Johnson et al., 1994). The results of recent measurements have been surveyed by Lassey 
( 2006) who also examines the "upscaling" of such measurements to national and global inventories.  
It is also important to examine the influences of feed properties and animal attributes on Ym. Such influences are 
important to better understand the microbiological mechanisms involved in methanogenesis with a view to 
designing emission abatement strategies, as well as to identify different values for Ym according to animal 
husbandry practices. To date, the search for such influences is equivocal, and consequently there is little 
variability evident both in the values reported in Table 10.12 as supported by the recent survey of Ym 
measurements in the literature (Lassey, 2006).

2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
10.31 
Table 10.13 proposes a common Ym   value for all mature sheep irrespective of feed quality, but with different 
values for mature and juvenile sheep with demarcation at 1 year of age. These values are based on data by 
Lassey et al. (1997), Judd et al. (1999) and Ulyatt et al. (2002a, 2002b, 2005) and while consistent with 
measurements by other researchers (Murray et al., 1978; Leuning et al., 1999), may not span the full range of 
pastures to be found. The median value is appropriate for most applications, but for poor quality feed the upper 
limits may be more appropriate, and for high-digestibility high-energy feeds the lower limits may be used.

Note that in some cases, CH4 conversion factors may not exist for specific livestock types.  In these instances, 
CH4 conversion factors from the reported livestock that most closely resembles those livestock types can be 
reported.   For examples, CH4 conversion factors for other cattle or buffalo could be applied to estimate an 
emission factor for camels. 
2. Emission factor development 
An emission factor for each animal category should be developed following Equation 10.21:

This emission factor equation assumes that the emission factors are being developed for an animal category for 
an entire year (365 days). While a full year emission factor is typically used, in some circumstances the animal 
category may be defined for a shorter period (e.g., for the wet season of the year or for a 150-day feedlot feeding 
period). In this case, the emission factor would be estimated for the specific period (e.g., the wet season) and the 
365 days would be replaced by the number of days in the period. The definition of the period to which the 
emission factor applies is described in Section 10.2.  
Step 3: Total emissions 
To estimate total emissions, the selected emission factors are multiplied by the associated animal population and 
summed.  As described above under Tier 1, the emissions estimates should be reported in gigagrams (Gg). 
 
Potential for refinement of Tier 2 or development of a Tier 3 method to enteric 
methane emission inventories 
Increased accuracy and identification of causes of variation in emissions are at the heart of inventory purpose.  
Improvements in country methodology, whether as components of current Tier 1 or 2 or if additional refinements 
are implemented (Tier 3), are encouraged. 
Current Tier 1 and Tier 2 enteric methane emissions factors and estimation procedures are driven by first 
estimating daily and annual gross energy consumption by individual animals within an inventory class which are 
then multiplied by an estimate of CH4 loss per unit of feed (Ym).  There is considerable room for improvement in 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
10.32 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Tier 2 prediction of both feed intake and in Ym. Factors potentially impacting feed requirements and/or 
consumption that are not considered include: 
• 
breed or genotype variation in maintenance requirement; 
• 
heat and cold stress effects on intake and maintenance requirements; and 
• 
depression in digestibility with increasing levels of consumption, or diet composition limits to diet intake. 
Likewise, a host of interacting factors that control variations in Ym are not included in Tier 2 methodology, 
including: 
• 
effects of digestibility  (DE%); 
• 
diet dry matter intake as it relates to live body weight; 
• 
diet chemical composition; 
• 
particle passage and digestion kinetics, or plant microbial defensive compounds; and 
• 
variation in the microbial populations within the digestive tract.   
Accurate estimation of diet DE% is singularly important in the estimation of feed intake and thus emissions, as 
previously emphasized. A 10% error in the average diet DE% or TDN% will result in CH4 errors ranging from 
12 to 20% depending on beginning circumstance. The depression in DE% with increasing daily amounts of diet 
consumed is not considered. This will underestimate feed intakes of high producing dairy cows consuming 
mixtures of concentrates and forages, e.g., as is common in the North America and Europe, although some of the 
resulting error in methane emission estimate will be compensated by reductions in Ym as intake per day increases.  
Methods to estimate digestibility depressions have been described (NRC, 1996; NRC, 2001). 
There have been many attempts to refine estimates of Ym.  Several researchers have developed models which 
relate the chemical composition of the diet consumed, or in more detail, the composition of digested 
carbohydrate and other chemical components to Ym.  These models typically predict diet particle and chemical 
component rates of passage and digestion in each enteric compartment at varying intake and the resulting H2 
balance, volatile fatty acids, and microbial and CH4 yields.  These approaches have generated Ym values that are 
consistent with direct measurements using chamber and SF6 techniques. 
The literature contains many examples of the positive relationship of plant cell wall digestion to high acetic to 
propionic end-product ratios, and to high CH4 yields.  While fibrous carbohydrate digestion is undeniably the 
strongest single indicator of CH4 yield, the CH4 per digested fiber is not constant, e.g., when soyhulls or beet 
pulp are fed as single feed at varying levels of intake, Ym will vary from 8 to 11% when measured at restricted 
feed intakes and from 5 to 6% when measure at ad libitum intakes (Kujawa, 1994; Diarra, 1994). Thus, enteric 
fermentation of the same fibrous substrate can result in quite different Ym values.  Perhaps the most severe 
limitation to development of more complex prediction models lies in the difficulty of applying them to broad 
country inventories.  The difficulty is to provide the data needed to drive these more complex models of feed 
intake or Ym.  It is often difficult to define animal characteristics, productivity, and %DE accurately for a class of 
livestock in a region of the country, let alone detailed carbohydrate fraction, rates of passage and digestion, etc. 
The amount of global research on mitigation strategies currently going on, such as vaccines, ionophores, 
polyunsaturated vegetable oils, condensed tannins etc, suggests a need to address how they should be reflected in 
inventory compilation at Tier 2 or Tier 3. First, the inventory should reflect only those technologies that conform 
to QA/QC principles and have attracted a wide degree of international acceptance such as through peer-reviewed 
articles that include a description of the technology, its efficacy and its validation under field conditions. Second, 
the inventory should be accompanied by evidence of the take-up of the technology, and apply it only to 
emissions by those livestock where take-up can be validated. Third, for a newly implemented technology (such 
as an administered dose of a mitigating agent), the inventory could also present an accompanying calculation of 
the emissions in the absence of a mitigation measure in order to make transparent the magnitude of the emission 
reductions that are being claimed.  Mitigation measures should be supported by peer-reviewed publications. 
Approaches to improve estimates of feed intake and Ym and to consider mitigation approaches are to be 
encouraged, given due care on limitations of scope, production circumstance, etc. to which the predictive 
relationships apply.

2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
10.33 
10.3.3 
Choice of activity data 
Livestock population data should be obtained using the approach described in Section 10.2. If using default 
enteric emission factors for livestock (Tables 10.10, 10.11) to estimate enteric emissions, a basic (Tier 1) 
livestock population characterisation is sufficient. To estimate enteric emissions from livestock using estimation 
of Gross Energy Intake (Equations 10.16, 10.17 or 10.18), a Tier 2 characterisation is needed. As noted in 
Section 10.2, good practice in characterising livestock populations is to conduct a single characterisation that 
will provide the activity data for all emissions sources that depend on livestock population data. 
10.3.4 
Uncertainty assessment 
Emission factors  
As the emission factors for the Tier 1 method are not based on country-specific data, they may not accurately 
represent a country’s livestock characteristics, and may be highly uncertain as a result. Emission factors 
estimated using the Tier 1 method are unlikely to be known more accurately than +30% and may be uncertain to 
+50%. The uncertainty under the Tier 2 method will depend on the accuracy of the livestock characterisation 
(e.g., homogeneity of livestock categories), and also on the extent to which the methods for defining the 
coefficients in the various relationships that make up the net energy approach correspond to national 
circumstances. Emission factor estimates using the Tier 2 method are likely to be in the order of +20%. 
Inventory compilers using the Tier 2 method should undertake an analysis of uncertainties reflecting their 
particular situation, and in the absence of this analysis the uncertainty under the Tier 2 method should be 
assumed similar to the uncertainty under the Tier 1 method. 
Although a Tier 3 method has the potential to improve the accuracy of emission estimates, a substantial body of 
scientific data is required to develop a viable Tier 3 method.  The use of unreliable and unsubstantiated data in a 
Tier 3 method could result in estimates that are inferior to Tier 2 or even Tier 1 methods.  In many instances, 
direct measurements of methane emissions from livestock are lacking or have been conducted using a limited 
number of diet types.  A considerable amount of research on potential mitigation strategies is ongoing, but few 
of these have been validated to the point that they can be extrapolated to non-research conditions. As the 
foundational research on emission related science continues to expand, Tier 3 method should theoretically result 
in the lowest degree of uncertainty.  
Activity data 
There will be an added uncertainty associated with the livestock and feed characterisation. Improving the 
livestock and feed characterisation will often be the priority in reducing overall uncertainty. Accurate estimates 
of feed digestibility (DE%) are also critical for reducing the degree of uncertainty.  Uncertainty estimates can be 
derived from the good practice approach to agricultural census data outlined in the uncertainty section for 
livestock and feed characterisation (see Section 10.2). 
General information on the procedures to assess uncertainty is presented in Volume 1, Chapter 3 (Uncertainties).   
10.3.5 
Completeness, Time series, Quality 
Assurance/Quality Control and Reporting 
To achieve completeness, all the major animal categories managed in the country should be considered. In the 
event that animals are included in the inventory for which default data are not available and for which no 
guidelines are provided, the emissions estimate should be developed using the same general principles presented 
in the discussion in Section 10.2. 
Care must be taken to use a consistent set of estimates for the CH4 conversion factors over time. In some cases, 
there may be reasons to modify methane conversion factors over time. These changes may be due to the 
implementation of explicit greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation measures, or may be due to changing agricultural 
practices such as feed conditions or other management factors without regard to GHGs. Regardless of the driver 
of change, the data and methane conversion factors used to estimate emissions must reflect the change in farm 
practices. If methane conversion factors over a time series are affected by a change in management practice 
and/or the implementation of GHG mitigation measures, the inventory compiler should ensure that the inventory 
data reflect these practices. The inventory text should thoroughly explain how the changes in management 
practice and/or implementation of mitigation measures has affected the time series of methane conversion factors. 
For general good practice guidance on developing a consistent time series, see Volume 1, Chapter 5 (Time 
Series Consistency).  
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
10.34 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
It is good practice to implement quality control checks as outlined in Volume 1, Chapter 6 (Quality 
Assurance/Quality Control and Verification). In addition to the guidance in Volume 1, specific procedures of 
relevance to this source category are outlined below: 
Activity data check 
• 
The inventory compiler should review livestock data collection methods, in particular checking that 
livestock subspecies data were collected and aggregated correctly. The data should be cross-checked with 
previous years to ensure the data are reasonable and consistent with the expected trend. Inventory compilers 
should document data collection methods, identify potential areas of bias, and evaluate the 
representativeness of the data.  Population modeling can be used to support this approach. 
Review of emission factors 
• 
If using the Tier 2/Tier 3 method, the inventory compiler should cross-check country-specific factors against 
the IPCC defaults. Significant differences between country-specific factors and default factors should be 
explained and documented. 
External review 
 
• 
If Tier 2/Tier 3 method is used, the inventory compiler is encouraged to conduct national and international 
expert review, including from industry, academic institutions, and extension expertise.  
• 
It is important to maintain internal documentation on review results. 
To improve transparency, emission estimates from this source category should be reported along with the 
activity data and emission factors used to determine the estimates. 
The following information should be documented: 
• 
All activity data including animal population data by category and region. 
• 
Activity data documentation including: 
(i) 
The sources of all activity data used in the calculations (i.e., complete citation for the statistical 
database from which data were collected); 
(ii) 
The information and assumptions that were used to develop the activity data, in cases where 
activity data were not directly available from databases; and 
(iii) 
The frequency of data collection, and estimates of accuracy and precision. 
• 
If Tier 1 method is used, all default emission factors used in the estimation of emissions for the specific 
animal categories. 
• 
If Tier 2 method is used: 
(i) 
Values for Ym; 
(ii) 
DE values estimated or taken from other studies; and 
(iii) 
Full documentation of the data used including their references. 
• 
For inventories in which country- or region-specific emission factors are used or in which new methods, 
such as Tier 3 are used, the scientific basis of these emission factors and the principles of the new method 
should be thoroughly documented. Documentation should include definitions of input parameters and a 
description of the principle and process by which these emission factors and methods are derived, as well as 
describing sources and magnitudes of uncertainties.

METHANE EMISSIONS FROM MANURE 
MANAGEMENT 
This section describes how to estimate CH4 produced during the storage and treatment of manure, and from 
manure deposited on pasture. The term ‘manure’ is used here collectively to include both dung and urine (i.e., 
the solids and the liquids) produced by livestock. The emissions associated with the burning of dung for fuel are 
to be reported under Volume 2 (Energy), or under Volume 5 (Waste) if burned without energy recovery. The 
decomposition of manure under anaerobic conditions (i.e., in the absence of oxygen), during storage and 
treatment, produces CH4. These conditions occur most readily when large numbers of animals are managed in a 
confined area (e.g., dairy farms, beef feedlots, and swine and poultry farms), and where manure is disposed of in 
liquid-based systems. Emissions of CH4 related to manure handling and storage are reported under ‘Manure 
Management.’   
The main factors affecting CH4 emissions are the amount of manure produced and the portion of the manure that 
decomposes anaerobically. The former depends on the rate of waste production per animal and the number of 
animals, and the latter on how the manure is managed. When manure is stored or treated as a liquid (e.g., in 
lagoons, ponds, tanks, or pits), it decomposes anaerobically and can produce a significant quantity of CH4. The 
temperature and the retention time of the storage unit greatly affect the amount of methane produced. When 
manure is handled as a solid (e.g., in stacks or piles) or when it is deposited on pastures and rangelands, it tends 
to decompose under more aerobic conditions and less CH4 is produced.   
10.4.1 
Choice of method 
There are three tiers to estimate CH4 emissions from livestock manure. Guidance for determining which tier to 
use is shown in Figure 10.3 decision tree. 
Tier 1 
A simplified method that only requires livestock population data by animal species/category and climate region 
or temperature, in combination with IPCC default emission factors, to estimate emissions. Because some 
emissions from manure management systems are highly temperature dependent, it is good practice to estimate 
the average annual temperature associated with the locations where manure is managed. 
Tier 2 
A more complex method for estimating CH4 emissions from manure management should be used where a 
particular livestock species/category represents a significant share of a country’s emissions. This method 
requires detailed information on animal characteristics and manure management practices, which is used to 
develop emission factors specific to the conditions of the country.  
Tier 3 
Some countries for which livestock emissions are particularly important may wish to go beyond the Tier 2 
method and develop models for country-specific methodologies or use measurement–based approaches to 
quantify emission factors.   
The method chosen will depend on data availability and national circumstances. Good practice in estimating 
CH4 emissions from manure management systems entails making every effort to use the Tier 2 method, 
including calculating emission factors using country-specific information. The Tier 1 method should only be 
used if all possible avenues to use the Tier 2 method have been exhausted and/or it is determined that the source 
is not a key category or subcategory.  
Regardless of the method chosen, the animal population must first be divided into categories as described in 
Section 10.2 that reflect the varying amounts of manure produced per animal. 
 The following four steps are used to estimate CH4 emissions from manure management:  
Step 1: Collect population data from the Livestock Population Characterisation (see Section 10.2). 
Step 2: Use default values or develop country-specific emission factors for each livestock subcategory in terms 
of kilograms of methane per animal per year. 
Step 3: Multiply the livestock subcategory emission factors by the subcategory populations to estimate 
subcategory emissions, and sum across the subcategories to estimate total emissions by primary livestock species. 
Step 4: Sum emissions from all defined livestock species to determine national emissions.

10.4.2 
Choice of emission factors 
The best way to determine emission factors is to conduct non-invasive or non-disturbing measurements of 
emissions in actual systems representative of those in use in the country. These field results can be used to 
develop models to estimate emission factors (Tier 3). Such measurements are difficult to conduct, and require 
significant resources and expertise, and equipment that may not be available. Thus, while such an approach is 
recommended to improve accuracy, it is not required for good practice. This section provides two alternatives 
for developing emission factors, with the selection of emission factors depending on the method (i.e., Tier 1 or 
Tier 2) chosen for estimating emissions. 
Tier 1 
When using the Tier 1 method, methane emission factors by livestock category or subcategory are used. Default 
emission factors by average annual temperature are presented in Table 10.14, Table 10.15, and Table 10.16 for 
each of the recommended population subcategories. These emission factors represent the range in manure 
volatile solids content and in manure management practices used in each region, as well as the difference in 
emissions due to temperature. Tables 10A-4 through 10A-9 located in Annex 10A.2 present the underlying 
assumptions used for each region. Countries using a Tier 1 method to estimate methane emissions from manure 
management should review the regional variables in these tables to identify the region that most closely matches 
their animal operations, and use the default emission factors for that region. 
Table 10.14 shows the default emission factors for cattle, swine, and buffalo for each region and temperature 
classification. Emission factors are listed by the annual average temperature for the climate zone where the 
livestock manure is managed.  The temperature data should be based on national meteorological statistics where 
available. Countries should estimate the percentage of animal populations in different temperature zones and 
compute a weighted average emission factor. Where this is not possible, the annual average temperature for the 
entire country could be utilized; however, this may not give an accurate estimate of emissions that are highly 
sensitive to temperature variations (e.g., liquid/slurry systems).  
Tables 10.15 and 10.16 present the default manure management emission factors for other animal species. 
Separate emission factors are shown for developed and developing countries in Table 10.15, reflecting the 
general differences in feed intake and feed characteristics of the animals in the two regions. Except for poultry 
“layers (wet),” these emission factors reflect the fact that virtually all the manure from these animals is managed 
in ‘dry’ manure management systems, including pastures and ranges, drylots, and daily spreading on fields 
(Woodbury and Hashimoto, 1993).

factors (see Annex 10A.1); Except for poultry in developed countries, methane conversion factor (MCF), and maximum methane 
producing capacity (Bo) values reported in Woodbury and Hashimoto (1993). Poultry for developed countries was subdivided into five 
categories. Layers (dry) represent layers in a "without bedding" waste management system; layers (wet) represent layers in an anaerobic 
lagoon waste management system. For layers, volatile solids (VS) are values reported in USDA (1996); typical animal mass values are 
from ASAE (1999); and Bo values for Layers are values reported by Hill (1982). For broilers and turkeys, Bo values are from Hill (1984); 
typical animal mass values are from ASAE (1999); and VS values are those reported in USDA (1996). Bo values for ducks were 
transferred from broilers and turkeys; typical animal mass values are from MWPS-18; and VS values are from USDA, AWMFH. 
Typical mass of sheep, goats and horses, and VS and Bo values of goats and horses for developed countries updated according to the 
analysis of GHG inventories of Annex I countries. All manure, with the exception of Layers (wet), is assumed to be managed in dry 
systems, which is consistent with the manure management system usage reported in Woodbury and Hashimoto (1993). 
a When selecting a default emission factor, be sure to consult the supporting tables in Annex 10A.2 for the distribution of manure 
management systems and animal waste characteristics used to estimate emissions. Select an emission factor for a region that most 
closely matches your own in these characteristics.

Tier 2 
The Tier 2 method is applicable when Manure Management is a key source or when the data used to develop the 
default values do not correspond well with the country's livestock and manure management conditions. Because 
cattle, buffalo and swine characteristics and manure management systems can vary significantly by country, 
countries with large populations of these animals should consider using the Tier 2 method for estimating 
methane emissions.  The Tier 2 method relies on two primary types of inputs that affect the calculation of 
methane emission factors from manure:   
Manure characteristics: Includes the amount of volatile solids (VS) produced in the manure and the maximum 
amount of methane able to be produced from that manure (Bo). Production of manure VS can be estimated based 
on feed intake and digestibility, which are the variables also used to develop the Tier 2 enteric fermentation 
emission factors. Alternatively, VS production rates can be based on laboratory measurements of livestock 
manure. Bo varies by animal species and feed regimen and is a theoretical methane yield based on the amount of 
VS in the manure.  Bedding materials (straw, sawdust, chippings, etc.) are not included in the VS modelled 
under the Tier 2 method.  The type and use of these materials is highly variable from country to country.  Since 
they typically are associated with solid storage systems, their contribution would not add significantly to overall 
methane production.  
Manure management system characteristics: Includes the types of systems used to manage manure and a 
system-specific methane conversion factor (MCF) that reflects the portion of Bo that is achieved. Regional 
assessments of manure management systems are used to estimate the portion of the manure that is handled with 
each manure management technique. A description of manure management systems is included in Table 10.18.  
The system MCF varies with the manner in which the manure is managed and the climate, and can theoretically 
range from 0 to 100%. Both temperature and retention time play an important role in the calculation of the MCF. 
Manure that is managed as a liquid under warm conditions for an extended period of time promotes methane 
formation. These manure management conditions can have high MCFs, of 65 to 80%. Manure managed as dry 
material in cold climates does not readily produce methane, and consequently has an MCF of about 1%.  
Development of Tier 2 emission factors involves determining a weighted average MCF using the estimates of 
the manure managed by each waste system within each climate region. The average MCF is then multiplied by 
the VS excretion rate and the Bo for the livestock categories. In equation form, the estimate is as follows:

MCF(S,k) = methane conversion factors for each manure management system S by climate region k, % 
MS(T,S,k) = fraction of livestock category T's manure handled using manure management system S in 
climate region k, dimensionless 
Even when the level of detail presented in the Tier 2 method is not possible in some countries, country-specific 
data elements such as animal mass, VS excretion, and others can be used to improve emission estimates. If 
country-specific data are available for only a portion of these variables, countries are encouraged to calculate 
country-specific emission factors, using the data in Tables 10A-4 through 10A-9 to fill gaps. 
Measurement programs can be used to improve the basis for making the estimates. In particular, measurements 
of emissions from manure management systems under field conditions are useful to verify MCFs. Also, 
measurements of Bo from livestock in tropical regions and for varying diet regimens are needed to expand the 
representativeness of the default factors. 
As emissions can vary significantly by region and livestock species/category, emission estimates should reflect 
as much as possible the diversity and range of animal populations and manure management practices between 
different regions within a country. This may require separate estimates to be developed for each region. 
Emission factors should be updated periodically to account for changes in manure characteristics and 
management practices. These revisions should be based on reliable scientifically reviewed data. Frequent 
monitoring is desirable to verify key model parameters and to track changing trends in the livestock industry. 
 
VS excretion rates 
Volatile solids (VS) are the organic material in livestock manure and consist of both biodegradable and non-
biodegradable fractions. The value needed for the Equation 10.23 is the total VS (both degradable and non-
biodegradable fractions) as excreted by each animal species since the Bo values are based on total VS entering 
the systems.  The best way to obtain average daily VS excretion rates is to use data from nationally published 
sources. If average daily VS excretion rates are not available, country-specific VS excretion rates can be 
estimated from feed intake levels. Feed intake for cattle and buffalo can be estimated using the ‘Enhanced’ 
characterisation method described in Section 10.2. This will also ensure consistency in the data underlying the 
emissions estimates. For swine, country-specific swine production data may be required to estimate feed intake.  
The VS content of manure equals the fraction of the diet consumed that is not digested and thus excreted as fecal 
material which, when combined with urinary excretions, constitutes manure. Countries should estimate gross 
energy (GE) intake (Section 10.2, Equation 10.16) and its fractional digestibility, DE, in the process of 
estimating enteric methane emissions.   
Once these are estimated, the VS excretion rate is estimated as:

VS = volatile solid excretion per day on a dry-organic matter basis, kg VS day-1 
GE = gross energy intake, MJ day-1 
DE% = digestibility of the feed in percent (e.g. 60%) 
(UE • GE) = urinary energy expressed as fraction of GE.  Typically 0.04GE can be considered urinary 
energy excretion by most ruminants (reduce to 0.02 for ruminants fed with 85% or more grain in the 
diet or for swine).  Use country-specific values where available. 
ASH = the ash content of manure calculated as a fraction of the dry matter feed intake (e.g., 0.08 for 
cattle).  Use country-specific values where available. 
18.45 = conversion factor for dietary GE per kg of dry matter (MJ kg-1).  This value is relatively constant 
across a wide range of forage and grain-based feeds commonly consumed by livestock. 
Representative DE% values for various livestock categories are provided in Section 10.2, Table 10.2 of this 
report.  The value for ash content fraction can range substantially between livestock types and should reflect 
national circumstances.

Bo values 
The maximum methane-producing capacity of the manure (Bo) varies by species and diet. The preferred method 
to obtain Bo measurement values is to use data from country-specific published sources, measured with a 
standardised method. It is important to standardise the Bo measurement, including the method of sampling, and 
to confirm if the value is based on total as-excreted VS or biodegradable VS, since the Tier 2 calculation is based 
on total as-excreted VS. If country-specific Bo measurement values are not available, default values are provided 
in Tables 10A-4 through 10A-9. 
MCFs 
Default methane conversion factors (MCFs) are provided in Table 10.17 for different manure management 
systems and by annual average temperatures. MCFs are determined for a specific manure management system 
and represent the degree to which Bo is achieved. The amount of methane generated by a specific manure 
management system is affected by the extent of anaerobic conditions present, the temperature of the system, and 
the retention time of organic material in the system.  Default MCF values for lagoons presented in Table 10.17 
include the effect of longer retention times, and as a result, are higher than other systems under most 
circumstances. 
Since liquid-based systems are very sensitive to temperature effects, where possible default MCF values for 
these systems have been presented in Table 10.17 for specific annual average temperatures in each climate range. 
While these temperature ranges should cover most climate conditions, areas that have extreme high or low 
annual average temperatures outside the 10 to 28 degree Celsius range should utilize the end-of-range (i.e., 10 or 
28 degree) values or investigate developing country-specific values.  
These default values may not encompass the potentially wide variation within the defined categories of 
management systems. Therefore, country-specific MCFs that reflect the specific management systems used in 
particular countries or regions should be developed if possible. This is particularly important for countries with 
large animal populations or with multiple climate regions. In such cases, and if possible, field measurements 
should be conducted for each climate region to replace the default MCF values. Measurements should include 
the following factors: 
• 
Timing of storage/application; 
• 
Feed and animal characteristics at the measurement site (see Section 10.2 for the type of data that would be 
pertinent); 
• 
Length of storage; 
• 
Manure characteristics (e.g., VS influent and effluent concentrations for liquid systems); 
• 
Determination of the amount of manure left in the storage facility (methanogenic inoculum); 
• 
Time and temperature distribution between indoor and outdoor storage; 
• 
Daily temperature fluctuation; and 
• 
Seasonal temperature variation.

and has large VS values. It is important to 
identify the next management process for the 
sludge and estimate the emissions from that 
management process if significant.  
Formula 1 (Timeframe for inputs should reflect operating period of digester): 
MCF = [{CH4 prod - CH4 used - CH4 flared + (MCFstorage /100 * Bo * VSstorage * 0.67 )}/ (Bo* VSstorage * 0.67)] *100 
Where: 
CH4 prod = methane production in digester , (kg CH4) . Note: When a gas tight coverage of the storage for digested manure is used, the gas production of the storage should be included. 
CH4 used = amount of methane gas used for energy, (kg CH4) 
CH4 flared = amount of methane flared, (kg CH4) 
MCFstorage = MCF for CH4 emitted during storage of digested manure (%) 
VSstorage = amount of VS excreted that goes to storage prior to digestion (kg VS)   
When a gas tight storage is included: MCFstorage = 0 ; otherwise MCFstorage = MCF value for liquid storage

10.4.3 
Choice of activity data 
There are two main types of activity data for estimating CH4 emissions from manure management: (1) animal 
population data; and (2) manure management system usage data. 
The animal population data should be obtained using the approach described in Section 10.2.  As noted in 
Section 10.2, it is good practice to conduct a single livestock characterisation that will provide the activity data 
for all emissions sources relying on livestock population data. It is important to note, however, that the level of 
disaggregation in the livestock population data required to estimate emissions from manure management, may 
differ from those used for other sources, such as Enteric Fermentation. For example, for some livestock 
population species/categories, such as cattle, the enhanced characterisation required for the Tier 2 enteric 
fermentation estimate could be aggregated to broader categories that are sufficient for this source category.   For 
other livestock species, such as swine, it may be preferable to have more disaggregation of weight categories for 
manure management calculations than for enteric fermentation. However, consistency in livestock categories 
should be retained throughout the inventory. 
Inventory agencies in countries with varied climatic conditions are encouraged to obtain population data for each 
major climatic zone. In addition, where possible, the associated annual average temperature for locations where 
livestock manure is managed in liquid-based systems (e.g., pits, tanks, and lagoons) should be obtained. This 
will allow more specific selection of default factors or MCF values for those systems more sensitive to 
temperature changes. Ideally, the regional population breakdown can be obtained from published national 
livestock statistics, and the temperature data from national meteorological statistics. If regional data are not 
available, experts should be consulted regarding regional production (e.g., milk, meat, and wool) patterns or land 
distribution, which may provide the required information to estimate the regional animal distributions. 
To implement the Tier 2 method, the portion of manure managed in each manure management system must also 
be collected for each representative animal species. Table 10.18 summarizes the main types of manure 
management systems. Quantitative data should be used to distinguish whether the system is judged to be a solid 
storage or liquid/slurry. The borderline between dry and liquid can be drawn at 20% dry matter content.  Note 
that in some cases, manure may be managed in several types of manure management systems. For example, 
manure flushed from a dairy freestall barn to an anaerobic lagoon may first pass through a solids separation unit 
where some of the manure solids are removed and managed as a solid. Therefore, it is important to carefully 
consider the fraction of manure that is managed in each type of system. 
The best means of obtaining manure management system distribution data is to consult regularly published 
national statistics. If such statistics are unavailable, the preferred alternative is to conduct an independent survey 
of manure management system usage. If the resources are not available to conduct a survey, experts should be 
consulted to obtain an opinion of the system distribution. Volume 1, Chapter 2 Approaches to Data Collection 
describes how to elicit expert judgement. Similar expert elicitation protocols can be used to obtain manure 
management system distribution data. 
10.4.4 
Uncertainty assessment 
EMISSION FACTORS 
There are large uncertainties associated with the default emission factors for Tier 1 (see Tables 10.14 to 10.16). 
The uncertainty range for the default factors is estimated to be +30%.  Improvements achieved by Tier 2 
methodologies are estimated to reduce uncertainty ranges in the emission factors to +20%.  Accurate and well-
designed emission measurements from well characterised types of manure and manure management systems can 
help reduce these uncertainties further. These measurements must account for temperature, moisture conditions, 
aeration, VS content, duration of storage, and other aspects of treatment.  
The default values may have a large uncertainty for an individual country because they may not reflect the 
specific manure management conditions present within the country. Uncertainties can be reduced by developing 
and using MCF, Bo, and VS values that reflect country/region specific conditions.

TABLE 10.18 
DEFINITIONS OF MANURE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS 
System  
Definition 
Pasture/Range/Paddock The manure from pasture and range grazing animals is allowed to lie as deposited, and is not 
managed. 
Daily spread 
Manure is routinely removed from a confinement facility and is applied to cropland or pasture 
within 24 hours of excretion. 
Solid storage 
The storage of manure, typically for a period of several months, in unconfined piles or stacks. 
Manure is able to be stacked due to the presence of a sufficient amount of bedding material or 
loss of moisture by evaporation. 
Dry lot 
A paved or unpaved open confinement area without any significant vegetative cover where 
accumulating manure may be removed periodically.   
Liquid/Slurry 
Manure is stored as excreted or with some minimal addition of water in either tanks or earthen 
ponds outside the animal housing, usually for periods less than one year. 
Uncovered anaerobic 
lagoon 
A type of liquid storage system designed and operated to combine waste stabilization and 
storage. Lagoon supernatant is usually used to remove manure from the associated confinement 
facilities to the lagoon. Anaerobic lagoons are designed with varying lengths of storage (up to a 
year or greater), depending on the climate region, the volatile solids loading rate, and other 
operational factors. The water from the lagoon may be recycled as flush water or used to irrigate 
and fertilise fields. 
Pit storage below 
animal confinements 
Collection and storage of manure usually with little or no added water typically below a slatted 
floor in an enclosed animal confinement facility, usually for periods less than one year. 
Anaerobic digester 
Animal excreta with or without straw are collected and anaerobically digested in a large 
containment vessel or covered lagoon. Digesters are designed and operated for waste 
stabilization by the microbial reduction of complex organic compounds to CO2  and  CH4, which 
is captured and flared or used as a fuel.  
Burned for fuel 
The dung and urine are excreted on fields. The sun dried dung cakes are burned for fuel. 
Cattle and Swine deep 
bedding 
As manure accumulates, bedding is continually added to absorb moisture over a production cycle 
and possibly for as long as 6 to 12 months. This manure management system also is known as a 
bedded pack manure management system and may be combined with a dry lot or pasture.  
Composting - in-
vessela 
Composting, typically in an enclosed channel, with forced aeration and continuous mixing. 
Composting - Static 
pilea 
Composting in piles with forced aeration but no mixing. 
Composting - Intensive 
windrowa 
Composting in windrows with regular (at least daily) turning for mixing and aeration. 
Composting - Passive 
windrowa 
Composting in windrows with infrequent turning for mixing and aeration.  
Poultry manure with 
litter 
Similar to cattle and swine deep bedding except usually not combined with a dry lot or pasture. 
Typically used for all poultry breeder flocks and for the production of meat type chickens 
(broilers) and other fowl. 
Poultry manure without 
litter 
May be similar to open pits in enclosed animal confinement facilities or may be designed and 
operated to dry the manure as it accumulates. The latter is known as a high-rise manure 
management system and is a form of passive windrow composting when designed and operated 
properly. 
Aerobic treatment 
The biological oxidation of manure collected as a liquid with either forced or natural aeration. 
Natural aeration is limited to aerobic and facultative ponds and wetland systems and is due 
primarily to photosynthesis. Hence, these systems typically become anoxic during periods 
without sunlight. 
a Composting is the biological oxidation of a solid waste including manure usually with bedding or another organic carbon source typically 
at thermophilic temperatures produced by microbial heat production.

ACTIVITY DATA – LIVESTOCK POPULATIONS 
See Section 10.2 Livestock and Feed Characterisation for discussion on uncertainty of animal population and 
characterisation data.  
ACTIVITY DATA – MANURE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM USAGE 
The uncertainty of the manure management system usage data will depend on the characteristics of each 
country's livestock industry and how information on manure management is collected.   For example, for 
countries that rely almost exclusively on one type of management system, such as pasture and range, the 
uncertainty associated with management system usage data can be 10% or less.    However, for countries where 
there is a wide variety of management systems used with locally different operating practices, the uncertainty 
range in management system usage data can be much higher, in the range of 25% to 50%, depending on the 
availability of reliable and representative survey data that differentiates animal populations by system usage.  
Preferably, each country should estimate the uncertainty associated with their management system usage data by 
using the methods described in Volume 1, Chapter 3.   
10.4.5 
Completeness, Time series, Quality assurance / 
Quality control and Reporting  
A complete inventory should estimate CH4 emissions from all systems of manure management for all livestock 
species/categories identified in Section 10.2. Countries are encouraged to use manure management system 
definitions that are consistent with those presented in Table 10.18 to ensure that all types of systems are being 
accounted for.  Population data should be cross-checked between main reporting mechanisms (such as FAO and 
national agricultural statistics databases) to ensure that information used in the inventory is complete and 
consistent. Because of the widespread availability of the FAO database of livestock information, most countries 
should be able to prepare, at a minimum, Tier 1 estimates for the major livestock categories.   For more 
information regarding the completeness of livestock characterisation, see Section 10.2. 
Developing a consistent time series of emission estimates for this source category requires, at a minimum, 
collection of an internally consistent time series of livestock population statistics. General guidance on the 
development of a consistent time series is addressed in Volume 1, Chapter 5 (Time Series Consistency).  
If significant changes in manure management practices have occurred over time, the Tier 1 method will not 
provide an accurate time series of emissions (since the Tier 1 default factors are based on a historical set of  
parameters), and the Tier 2 method should be considered. When developing a time series for the Tier 2 method it 
is also necessary to collect country-specific manure management system data. In cases when manure 
management system data are not available for some period during the time series, trends can be used to 
extrapolate data from a sample area or region to the entire country, if climatic conditions are similar (i.e., 
temperature and rainfall). National livestock experts from government, industry, or universities should be 
consulted where possible to develop trends in management system usage and characteristics.  
If the emission estimation method has changed, historical data that are required by the current method should be 
collected and used to recalculate emissions for that period. If such data are not available, it may be appropriate to 
create a trend with recent data and use the trend to back-estimate management practices for the time series. For 
example, it may be known that certain livestock industries are converting to more intensive management systems 
in lieu of grazing. Historically, this changeover should be captured in the time series of emissions, through 
modifications to the manure management system allocation. It may be necessary to base this allocation on expert 
judgment from national experts where extensive survey data are not available. Volume 1, Chapter 5 provides 
additional guidance on how to address recalculation issues. Also, Section 10.2 suggests approaches for the 
animal population aspects. The inventory text should thoroughly explain how the change in farm practices or 
implementation of mitigation measures has affected the time series of activity data or emission factors.  
It is good practice to implement general quality control checks as outlined in Volume 1, Chapter 6, Quality 
Assurance/Quality Control and Verification, and expert review of the emission estimates. Additional quality 
control checks and quality assurance procedures may also be applicable, particularly if higher tier methods are 
used to determine emissions from this source. The general QA/QC related to data processing, handling, and 
reporting should be supplemented with procedures discussed below. 
ACTIVITY DATA CHECK 
• 
The inventory agency should review livestock data collection methods, in particular checking that livestock 
subspecies data were collected and aggregated correctly. The data should be cross-checked with previous 
years to ensure the data are reasonable and consistent with the expected trend. Inventory agencies should 
document data collection methods, identify potential areas of bias (e.g., systematic under-reporting of 
Chapter 10: Emissions from Livestock and Manure Management 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
10.51 
animal populations to statistical agencies by individual livestock owners), and evaluate the 
representativeness of the data. 
• 
Manure management system allocation should be reviewed on a regular basis to determine if changes in the 
livestock industry are being captured. Conversion from one type of management system to another, and 
technical modifications to system configuration and performance, should be captured in the system 
modeling for the affected livestock.  
• 
National agricultural policy and regulations may have an effect on parameters that are used to calculate 
manure emissions, and should be reviewed regularly to determine what impact they may have. For example, 
guidelines to reduce manure runoff into water bodies may cause a change in management practices, and thus 
affect the MCF value for a particular livestock category. Consistency should be maintained between the 
inventory and ongoing changes in agricultural practices. 
REVIEW OF EMISSION FACTORS 
• 
If using the Tier 1 method (using default IPCC emission factors), the inventory agency should evaluate how 
well the default VS excretion rates, Bo values, and manure management practices represent the defined 
animal population and manure characteristics of the country. This should be done by reviewing the 
background information from Tables 10A-4 to 10A-9 to see how well the default input parameters match the 
inventory area. If there is not a good match, substitution of more appropriate country-specific parameters 
can be used to develop an improved emission factor. 
• 
If using the Tier 2 method, the inventory agency should cross-check the country-specific parameters (e.g., 
VS excretion rates, Bo, and MCF) against the IPCC defaults. Significant differences between country-
specific parameters and default parameters should be explained and documented.  
• 
If using the Tier 2 method, derivation of VS rates should be compared to background assumptions used for 
the enteric fermentation Tier 2 inventory where applicable. For example, the gross energy and digestible 
energy components used in the enteric fermentation inventory can be used to cross-check independently-
derived VS rates. Application of Equation 10.24 (Volatile solid excretion rates) can be used in this case for 
such a cross-comparison on ruminants. For all animals, on a gross basis, VS rates should be consistent with 
the feed intake of the animal (i.e., waste energy should not exceed intake energy) and be consistent with the 
range of DE% values reported in Section 10.2, Table 10.2 of this report.  
• 
Whenever possible, available measurement data, even if they represent only a small sample of systems, 
should be reviewed relative to assumptions for MCF values and CH4 production estimates. Representative 
measurement data may provide insights into how well current assumptions predict CH4 production from 
manure management systems in the inventory area, and how certain factors (e.g., temperature, system 
configuration, retention time) are affecting emissions. Because of the relatively small amount of 
measurement data available for these systems worldwide, any new results can improve the understanding of 
these emissions and possibly their prediction.  
EXTERNAL REVIEW 
• 
The inventory agency should utilise experts in manure management and animal nutrition to conduct expert 
peer review of the methods and data used. While these experts may not be familiar with greenhouse gas 
emissions, their knowledge of key input parameters to the emission calculation can aid in the overall 
verification of the emissions. For example, animal nutritionists can evaluate VS production rates to see if 
they are consistent with feed utilization research for certain livestock species. Practicing farmers can provide 
insights into actual manure management techniques, such as storage times and mixed-system usage. 
Wherever possible, these experts should be completely independent of the inventory process in order to 
allow a true external review. 
It is good practice to document and archive all information required to produce the national emissions inventory 
estimates as outlined in Volume 1, Chapter 6 (Quality assurance/Quality control and Verification). When 
country-specific data (e.g., emission factors, manure management practices, and manure characteristics such as 
VS and Bo) have been used, the derivation of or references for these data should be clearly documented and 
reported along with the inventory results under the appropriate IPCC source category. To improve transparency, 
emission estimates from this source category should be reported along with the activity data and emission factors 
used to determine the estimates.  
The following information should be documented:  
• 
All activity data (e.g., livestock population data by species/category and by region), including sources used, 
complete citations for the statistical database from which data were collected, and (in cases where activity

data were not available directly from databases) the information and assumptions that were used to derive 
the activity data. 
• 
Climatic conditions (e.g., average temperature during manure storage) in regions if applicable. 
• 
Manure management system data, by livestock species/category and by region, if applicable.  If manure

N2O EMISSIONS FROM MANURE 
MANAGEMENT 
The section describes how to estimate the N2O produced, directly and indirectly, during the storage and 
treatment of manure before it is applied to land or otherwise used for feed, fuel, or construction purposes. The 
term ‘manure’ is used here collectively to include both dung and urine (i.e., the solids and the liquids) produced 
by livestock. The N2O emissions generated by manure in the system ‘pasture, range, and paddock’ occur directly 
and indirectly from the soil, and are therefore reported under the category ‘N2O Emissions from Managed Soils’ 
(see Chapter 11, Section 11.2). The emissions associated with the burning of dung for fuel are to be reported 
under ‘Fuel Combustion’ (see Volume 2: Energy), or under ‘Waste Combustion’ (see Volume 5: Waste) if 
burned without energy recovery.   
Direct N2O emissions occur via combined nitrification and denitrification of nitrogen contained in the manure. 
The emission of N2O from manure during storage and treatment depends on the nitrogen and carbon content of 
manure, and on the duration of the storage and type of treatment. Nitrification (the oxidation of ammonia 
nitrogen to nitrate nitrogen) is a necessary prerequisite for the emission of N2O from stored animal manures. 
Nitrification is likely to occur in stored animal manures provided there is a sufficient supply of oxygen. 
Nitrification does not occur under anaerobic conditions. Nitrites and nitrates are transformed to N2O and 
dinitrogen (N2) during the naturally occurring process of denitrification, an anaerobic process.  There is general 
agreement in the scientific literature that the ratio of N2O to N2 increases with increasing acidity, nitrate 
concentration, and reduced moisture.  In summary, the production and emission of N2O from managed manures 
requires the presence of either nitrites or nitrates in an anaerobic environment preceded by aerobic conditions 
necessary for the formation of these oxidized forms of nitrogen. In addition, conditions preventing reduction of 
N2O to N2, such as a low pH or limited moisture, must be present. 
Indirect emissions result from volatile nitrogen losses that occur primarily in the forms of ammonia and NOx. 
The fraction of excreted organic nitrogen that is mineralized to ammonia nitrogen during manure collection and 
storage depends primarily on time, and to a lesser degree temperature. Simple forms of organic nitrogen such as 
urea (mammals) and uric acid (poultry) are rapidly mineralized to ammonia nitrogen, which is highly volatile 
and easily diffused into the surrounding air (Asman et al., 1998; Monteny and Erisman, 1998). Nitrogen losses 
begin at the point of excretion in houses and other animal production areas (e.g., milk parlors) and continue 
through on-site management in storage and treatment systems (i.e., manure management systems). Nitrogen is 
also lost through runoff and leaching into soils from the solid storage of manure at outdoor areas, in feedlots and 
where animals are grazing in pastures.  Pasture losses are considered separately in Chapter 11, Section 11.2, N2O 
Emissions from Managed Soils, as are emissions of nitrogen compounds from grazing livestock. 
Chapter 10: Emissions from Livestock and Manure Management 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
10.53 
Due to significant direct and indirect losses of manure nitrogen in management systems it is important to 
estimate the remaining amount of animal manure nitrogen available for application to soils or for use in feed, 
fuel, or construction purposes. This value is used for calculation N2O emissions from managed soils (see Chapter 
11, Section 11.2). The methodology to estimate manure nitrogen that is directly applied to soils, or available for 
use in feed, fuel, or construction purposes is described in this chapter under Section 10.5.4 “Coordination with 
reporting for N2O emissions from managed soils". 
10.5.1 
Choice of method  
The level of detail and methods chosen for estimating N2O emissions from manure management systems will 
depend upon national circumstances and the decision tree in Figure 10.4 describes good practice in choosing a 
method accordingly.  The following sections describe the different tiers referenced in the decision tree for 
calculating direct and indirect N2O emissions from manure management systems. 
Direct N2O emissions from Manure Management 
Tier 1 
The Tier 1 method entails multiplying the total amount of N excretion (from all livestock species/categories) in 
each type of manure management system by an emission factor for that type of manure management system (see 
Equation 10.25). Emissions are then summed over all manure management systems.  The Tier 1 method is 
applied using IPCC default N2O emission factors, default nitrogen excretion data, and default manure 
management system data (see Annex 10A.2, Tables 10A-4 to 10A-8 for default management system allocations).  
Tier 2 
A Tier 2 method follows the same calculation equation as Tier 1 but would include the use of country-specific 
data for some or all of these variables.  For example, the use of country-specific nitrogen excretion rates for 
livestock categories would constitute a Tier 2 methodology.   
Tier 3 
A Tier 3 method utilizes alternative estimation procedures based on a country-specific methodology.  For 
example, a process-based, mass balance approach which tracks nitrogen throughout the system starting with feed 
input through final use/disposal could be utilized as a Tier 3 procedure.  Tier 3 methods should be well 
documented to clearly describe estimation procedures.  
To estimate emissions from manure management systems, the livestock population must first be divided into 
categories that reflect the varying amounts of manure produced per animal as well as the manner in which the 
manure is handled. This division of manure by type of system should be the same as that used to characterize 
methane emissions from manure management (see Section 10.4). For example, if Tier 1 default emission factors 
are used for calculating CH4 emissions, then the manure management systems usage data from Tables 10A-4 to 
10A-8 should be applied. Detailed information on how to characterise the livestock population for this source is 
provided in Section 10.2. 
The following five steps are used to estimate direct N2O emissions from Manure Management:  
Step 1: Collect population data from the Livestock Population Characterisation; 
Step 2: Use default values or develop the annual average nitrogen excretion rate per head (Nex(T)) for each 
defined livestock species/category T; 
Step 3: Use default values or determine the fraction of total annual nitrogen excretion for each livestock 
species/category T that is managed in each manure management system S (MS(T,S)); 
Step 4: Use default values or develop N2O emission factors for each manure management system S (EF3(S)); 
and 
Step 5: For each manure management system type S, multiply its emission factor (EF3(S)) by the total amount of 
nitrogen managed (from all livestock species/categories) in that system, to estimate N2O emissions from that 
manure management system. Then sum over all manure management systems. 
In some cases, manure nitrogen may be managed in several types of manure management systems. For example, 
manure flushed from a dairy freestall barn to an anaerobic lagoon may first pass through a solids separation unit 
where some of the manure nitrogen is removed and managed as a solid. Therefore, it is important to consider 
carefully the fraction of manure nitrogen that is managed in each type of system. 
The calculation of direct N2O emissions from manure management is based on the following equation:

There may be losses of nitrogen in other forms (e.g., ammonia and NOx) as manure is managed on site. Nitrogen 
in the volatilized form of ammonia may be deposited at sites downwind from manure handling areas and 
contribute to indirect N2O emissions (see below). Countries are encouraged to consider using a mass balance 
approach (Tier 3) to track the manure nitrogen excreted, managed on site in manure management systems, and 
ultimately applied to managed soils.  The estimation of the amount of manure nitrogen which is directly applied 
to managed soils or otherwise available for use as feed, fuel or construction purposes is described in the Section 
10.5.4, Coordination with reporting for N2O emissions from managed soils.  See Chapter 11, Section 11.2 for 
procedures to calculate N2O emissions from managed manure nitrogen applied to soils. 
Indirect N2O emissions from Manure Management 
Tier 1 
The Tier 1 calculation of N volatilisation in forms of NH3 and NOx from manure management systems is based 
on multiplication of the amount of nitrogen excreted (from all livestock categories) and managed in each manure 
management system by a fraction of volatilised nitrogen (see Equation 10.26). N losses are then summed over all 
manure management systems.  The Tier 1 method is applied using default nitrogen excretion data, default 
manure management system data (see Annex 10A.2, Tables 10A-4 to 10A-8) and default fractions of N losses 
from manure management systems due to volatilisation (see Table 10.22):

Tier 2 
Countries may wish to develop a Tier 2 methodology for better consideration of national circumstances and to 
reduce uncertainty of estimates as much as possible. As for direct N2O emission from manure management, a 
Tier 2 method would follow the same calculation equation as Tier 1 but include the use of country-specific data 
for some or all of these variables.  For example, the use of country-specific nitrogen excretion rates for livestock 
categories would constitute a Tier 2 method.  National NH3 emission inventories developed by some countries 
could be used for Tier 2 estimation of nitrogen volatilisation from manure management systems.  A Tier 2 
method would require more detailed characterisation of the flow of nitrogen throughout the animal housing and 
manure management systems used in the country.  Double counting of emissions associated with the application 
of managed manure should be avoided, as well as manure associated with pasture and grazing operations, which 
should be calculated and reported under Chapter 11, Section 11.2 (N2O emissions from managed soils).  
There are extremely limited measurement data on leaching and runoff losses from various manure management 
systems.  The greatest N losses due to runoff and leaching typically occur where animals are on a drylot. In drier 
climates, runoff losses are smaller than in high rainfall areas and have been estimated in the range from 3 to 6% 
of N excreted (Eghball and Power, 1994).  Studies by Bierman et al. (1999) found nitrogen lost in runoff was 5 
to 19% of N excreted and 10 to 16% leached into soil, while other data show relatively low loss of nitrogen 
through leaching in solid storage (less than  5% of N excreted) but greater loss could also occur (Rotz, 2004). 
Further research is needed in this area to improve the estimated losses and the conditions and practices under 
which such losses occur.  Equation 10.28 should only be used where there is country-specific information on the 
fraction of nitrogen loss due to leaching and runoff from manure management systems available. Therefore, 
estimation of N losses from leaching and runoff from manure management should be considered part of a Tier 2 
or Tier 3method. 
Nitrogen that leaches into soil and/or runs off during solid storage of manure at outdoor areas or in feedlots is 
derived as follows:

from managed soils, for guidance on calculating total N losses from manure management systems. 
10.5.2 
Choice of emission factors 
Annual average nitrogen excretion rates, Nex(T) 
Tier 1 
Annual nitrogen excretion rates should be determined for each livestock category defined by the livestock 
population characterisation.  Country-specific rates may either be taken directly from documents or reports such 
as agricultural industry and scientific literature, or derived from information on animal nitrogen intake and 
retention (as explained below). In some situations, it may be appropriate to use excretion rates developed by 
other countries that have livestock with similar characteristics.  
If country-specific data cannot be collected or derived, or appropriate data are not available from another country, 
the IPCC default nitrogen excretion rates presented in Table 10.19 can be used. These rates are presented in units 
of nitrogen excreted per 1000 kg of animal per day. These rates can be applied to livestock sub-categories of 
varying ages and growth stages using a typical average animal mass (TAM) for that population sub-category, as 
shown in Equation 10.30.

TAM(T)  = typical animal mass for livestock category T, kg animal-1 
 
Default TAM values are provided in Tables 10A-4 to 10A-9 in Annex 10A.2.  However, it is preferable to 
collect country-specific TAM values due to the sensitivity of nitrogen excretion rates to different weight 
categories.  For example, market swine may vary from nursery pigs weighing less than 30 kilograms to finished 
pigs that weigh over 90 kilograms. By constructing animal population groups that reflect the various growth 
stages of market pigs, countries will be better able to estimate the total nitrogen excreted by their swine 
population. 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use

2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
When estimating the Nex(T) for animals whose manure is classified in the manure management system burned 
for fuel (Table 10.21, Default emission factors for direct N2O emissions from Manure Management), it should be 
kept in mind that the dung is burned and the urine stays in the field. As a rule of thumb, 50% of the nitrogen 
excreted is in the dung and 50% is in the urine. If the burned dung is used as fuel, then emissions are reported 
under the IPCC category Fuel Combustion (Volume 2: Energy), whereas if the dung is burned without energy 
recovery the emissions should be reported under the IPCC category Waste Incineration (Volume 5: Waste).  
Tier 2 
The annual amount of N excreted by each livestock species/category depends on the total annual N intake and 
total annual N retention of the animal. Therefore, N excretion rates can be derived from N intake and N retention 
data. Annual N intake (i.e., the amount of N consumed by the animal annually) depends on the annual amount of 
feed digested by the animal, and the protein content of that feed. Total feed intake depends on the production 
level of the animal (e.g., growth rate, milk production, draft power). Annual N retention (i.e., the fraction of N 
intake that is retained by the animal for the production of meat, milk, or wool) is a measure of the animal's 
efficiency of production of animal protein from feed protein. Nitrogen intake and retention data for specific 
livestock species/categories may be available from national statistics or from animal nutrition specialists. 
Nitrogen intake can also be calculated from data on feed and crude protein intake developed in Section 10.2.  
Default N retention values are provided in Table 10.20, Default values for the fraction of nitrogen in feed taken 
in by animals that is retained by the different animal species/categories. Rates of annual N excretion for each 
livestock species/category (Nex(T)) are derived as follows: 
 
EQUATION 10.31 
ANNUAL N EXCRETION RATES (TIER 2) 
Nex(T) = Nintake(T) ● (1 – Nretention_frac(T)) ● 365 
Where: 
Nex(T) = annual N excretion rates, kg N animal-1 yr-1 
Nintake(T) = the daily N intake per head of animal of species/category T , kg N animal-1 day-1 
Nretention_frac(T) = fraction of N intake that is retained by animal of species/category T,  dimensionless 
 
Example of Tier 2 method for estimating nitrogen excretion for cattle 
Nitrogen excretion may be calculated based on the same dietary assumptions used in modelling enteric 
fermentation emissions (see Section 10.2). The amount of nitrogen excreted by cattle can be estimated as the 
difference between the total nitrogen taken in by the animal and the total nitrogen retained for growth and milk 
production. Equations 10.32 and 10.33 can be used to calculate the variables for nitrogen intake and nitrogen 
retained for use in Equation 10.31.  The total nitrogen intake rate is derived as follows:

Annual nitrogen excretion data are also used for the calculation of direct and indirect N2O emissions from 
managed soils (see Chapter 11, Section 11.2, N2O emissions from managed soils). The same rates of N excretion, 
and methods of derivation, that are used to estimate N2O emissions from Manure Management should be used to 
estimate N2O emissions from managed soils. 
Emission factors for direct N2O emissions from Manure Management 
The best estimate will be obtained using country-specific emission factors that have been fully documented in 
peer reviewed publications. It is good practice to use country-specific emission factors that reflect the actual 
duration of storage and type of treatment of animal manure in each management system that is used. Good 
 Chapter 10: Emissions from Livestock and Manure Management 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
10.61 
practice in the derivation of country-specific emission factors involves the measurement of emissions (per unit 
of manure N) from different management systems, taking into account variability in duration of storage and 
types of treatment. When defining types of treatment, conditions such as aeration and temperature should be 
taken into account. If inventory agencies use country-specific emission factors, they are encouraged to provide 
justification for these values via peer-reviewed documentation.  
If appropriate country-specific emission factors are unavailable, inventory agencies are encouraged to use the 
default emission factors presented in Table 10.21, Default emission factors for direct N2O emissions from 
Manure Management. This table contains default emission factors by manure management system. Note that 
emissions from liquid/slurry systems without a natural crust cover, anaerobic lagoons, and anaerobic digesters 
are considered negligible based on the absence of oxidized forms of nitrogen entering these systems combined 
with the low potential for nitrification and denitrification to occur in the system. 
Emission factors for indirect N2O emissions from Manure Management 
In order to estimate indirect N2O emissions from Manure Management, two fractions of nitrogen losses (due to 
volatilization and leaching/runoff), and two indirect N2O emissions factors associated with these losses (EF4 and 
EF5) are needed.  Default values for volatilization N losses are presented in the Table 10.22. Values represent 
average rates for N loss in the forms of NH3 and NOx, with most of the loss in the form of NH3.  Ranges reflect 
values that appear in the literature. The values represent conditions without any significant nitrogen control 
measures in place.  Countries are encouraged to develop country-specific values, particularly related to ammonia 
losses where component emissions may be well characterized as part of larger air quality assessments and where 
emissions may be affected by nitrogen reduction strategies.   For example, detailed methodologies for estimating 
NH3 and other nitrogen losses using mass balance/mass flow procedures are described in the EMEP/CORINAIR 
Atmospheric Inventory Guidebook, Chapter 1009  (European Environmental Agency, 2002).   
The fraction of manure nitrogen that leaches from manure management systems (FracleachMS) is highly uncertain 
and should be developed as a country-specific value applied in Tier 2 method. 
Default values for EF4 (N volatilisation and re-deposition) and EF5 (N leaching/runoff) are given in Chapter 11, 
Table 11.3 (Default emission, volatilisation and leaching factors for indirect soil N2O emissions). 
10.5.3 
Choice of activity data 
There are two main types of activity data for estimating N2O emissions from manure management systems: (1) 
livestock population data, and (2) manure management system usage data. 
Livestock population data, N(T)  
The animal population data should be obtained using the approach described in Section 10.2. If using default 
nitrogen excretion rates to estimate N2O emissions from manure management systems, a Tier 1 livestock 
population characterisation is sufficient. To estimate N2O emissions from Manure Management using calculated 
nitrogen excretion rates, a Tier 2 characterisation must be performed. As noted in Section 10.2, good practice in 
characterising livestock populations is to conduct a single characterisation that will provide the activity data for 
all emissions sources that depend on livestock population data. 
Manure management system usage data, MS(T,S) 
The manure management system usage data used to estimate N2O emissions from Manure Management should 
be the same as those that are used to estimate CH4 emissions from Manure Management (see Table 10.18 for a 
summary of the main types of manure management systems). The portion of manure managed in each manure 
management system must be collected for each representative livestock category. Note that in some cases, 
manure may be managed in several types of manure management systems. For example, manure flushed from a 
dairy freestall barn to an anaerobic lagoon may first pass through a solids separation unit where some of the 
manure solids are removed and managed as a solid. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the fraction of 
manure that is managed in each type of system. 
The best means of obtaining manure management system distribution data is to consult regularly published 
national statistics. If such statistics are unavailable, the preferred alternative is to conduct an independent survey 
of manure management system usage. If the resources are not available to conduct a survey, experts should be 
consulted to obtain an opinion of the system distribution. If country-specific manure management system usage 
data are not available, default values should be used. The IPCC default values for dairy cows, other cattle, 
buffalo, swine (market and breeding swine), and poultry should be taken from Tables 10A-4 through 10A-8 of 
Annex 10A.2. Manure from other animal categories is typically managed in pastures and grazing operations.

10.5.4 
Coordination with reporting for N2O emissions from 
managed soils 
Following storage or treatment in any system of manure management, nearly all the manure will be applied to 
land. The emissions that subsequently arise from the application of the manure to soil are to be reported under 
the category N2O emissions from managed soils. The methods for estimating these emissions are discussed in 
Chapter 11, Section 11.2. In estimating N2O emissions from managed soils, the amount of animal manure 
nitrogen that is directly applied to soils, or available for use in feed, fuel, or construction purposes, are 
considered. 
A significant proportion of the total nitrogen excreted by animals in managed systems (i.e., all livestock except 
those in pasture and grazing conditions) is lost prior to final application to managed soils or for use as feed, fuel, 
or for construction purposes.  In order to estimate the amount of animal manure nitrogen that is directly applied 
to soils, or available for use in feed, fuel, or construction purposes (i.e., the value which is used in Chapter 11, 
Equation 11.1 or 11.2), it is necessary to reduce the total amount of nitrogen excreted by animals in managed 
systems by the losses of N through volatilisation (i.e., NH3, N2 and NOx), conversion to N2O and losses through 
leaching and runoff.  
Where organic forms of bedding material (straw, sawdust, chippings, etc.) are used, the additional nitrogen from 
the bedding material should also be considered as part of the managed manure N applied to soils. Bedding is 
typically collected with the remaining manure and applied to soils.  It should be noted, however, that since 
mineralization of nitrogen compounds in beddings occurs more slowly compared to manure and the 
concentration of ammonia fraction in organic beddings is negligible, both volatilization and leaching losses 
during storage of bedding are assumed to be zero (European Environmental Agency, 2002).

Where: 
NMMS_Avb = amount of managed manure nitrogen available for application to managed soils or for feed, 
fuel, or construction purposes, kg N yr-1 
N(T) = number of head of livestock species/category T in the country 
Nex(T) = annual average N excretion per animal of species/category T in the country, kg N animal-1 yr-1  
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use  
10.66 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
MS(T,S) = fraction of total annual nitrogen excretion for each livestock species/category T that is managed 
in manure management system S in the country, dimensionless 
FracLossMS = amount of managed manure nitrogen for livestock category T that is lost in the manure 
management system S, % (see Table 10.23) 
NbeddingMS = amount of nitrogen from bedding (to be applied for solid storage and deep bedding MMS if 
known organic bedding usage), kg N animal-1 yr-1 
S = manure management system  
T = species/category of livestock 
 
Bedding materials vary greatly and inventory compilers should develop values for NbeddingMS based on the 
characteristics of bedding material used in their livestock industries. Limited data from scientific literature 
indicates the amount of nitrogen contained in organic bedding material applied for dairy cows and heifers is 
usually around 7 kg N animal-1 yr-1, for other cattle is 4 kg N animal-1 yr-1, for market and breeding swine is 
around 0.8 and 5.5 kg N animal-1 yr-1, respectively. For deep bedding systems, the amount of N in litter is 
approximately double these amounts (Webb, 2001; Döhler et al., 2002). 
Table 10.23 presents default values for total nitrogen losses from manure management systems.   These default 
values include losses that occur from the point of excretion, including animal housing losses, manure storage 
losses, and losses from leaching and runoff at the manure storage system where applicable.  For example, values 
provided for dairy anaerobic lagoon systems include nitrogen losses that occur in the dairy barn and milking 
parlour prior to the collection and treatment of manure, as well as those that occur from the lagoon.   
There is a high level of variability in the range of total nitrogen losses from managed manure systems.  As shown 
in Table 10.23, the majority of these are due to volatilization losses, primarily ammonia losses that occur rapidly 
following the excretion of the manure.  However, losses also occur in the form of NO3, N2O, and N2 as well from 
leaching and runoff that occurs where manure is stored in piles.  The values in Table 10.23 reflect average values 
for typical housing/storage combinations for each animal category. Countries are encouraged to develop country-
specific values, particularly related to ammonia losses where component emissions may be well characterised for 
local practices as part of larger air quality assessments and where emissions may be affected by nitrogen 
reduction strategies.   
Countries may wish to develop an alternative approach for better consideration of national circumstances and to 
reduce uncertainty of estimates as much as possible. This approach would entail more detailed characterisation 
of the flow of nitrogen through the components of the animal housing and manure management systems used in 
the country,  accounting for any mitigation activity (e.g., the use of covers over slurry tanks), and consideration 
of local practices, such as type of bedding material used.  
10.5.5 
Uncertainty assessment 
EMISSION FACTORS – NITROGEN EXCRETION RATES 
Uncertainty ranges for the default N excretion rates are estimated at about +50% (Source: Judgement by IPCC 
Expert Group). The uncertainty ranges for the default N retention values provided here are also +50% (see Table 
10.20). If inventory agencies derive N excretion rates using accurate in-country statistics on N intake and N 
retention, the uncertainties associated with the N excretion rates may be reduced substantially.  The degree of 
uncertainty may be further reduced by using direct emission measurements of nitrogen losses from specific 
manure management systems. 
EMISSION FACTORS – DIRECT N2O EMISSIONS 
There are large uncertainties associated with the default emission factors for this source category (–50% to 
+100%). Accurate and well-designed emission measurements from well characterised types of manure and 
manure management systems can help reduce these uncertainties. These measurements must account for 
temperature, moisture conditions, aeration, manure N content, metabolisable carbon, duration of storage, and 
other aspects of treatment.

b Total N loss rates based on judgement of IPCC Expert Group and following sources:  Rotz ( 2003), Hutchings et al. 
(2001), and U.S EPA (2004).  Rates include losses in forms of NH3, NOx, N2O, and N2 as well from leaching and runoff 
from solid storage and dry lots.  Values represent average rates for typical housing and storage components without any 
significant nitrogen control measures in place.  Ranges reflect values that appear in the literature.  Where measures to 
control nitrogen losses are in place, alternative rates should be developed to reflect those measures. 
c Other includes sheep, horses, and fur-bearing animals. 
 
EMISSION FACTORS – INDIRECT N2O EMISSIONS 
Uncertainty ranges for default N losses due to volatilisation of NH3 and NOx and total N losses from manure 
management systems are presented in the Tables 10.22 and 10.23, respectively. The uncertainty associated with 
default emission factor for nitrogen volatilisation and re-deposition (EF4) is given in Table 11.3 of Chapter 11. 
The uncertainty range for the default emission factor for leaching and runoff (EF5) is also provided in Table 11.3. 
Caution should be taken when developing country-specific emission factors for volatilisation and re-deposition 
of nitrogen, since direct measurements could include transboundary atmospheric transport. 
ACTIVITY DATA – LIVESTOCK POPULATIONS 
See Section 10.2 (Livestock Population and Feed Characterisation) for discussion on uncertainty of animal 
population and feed characterisation data. 
ACTIVITY DATA – MANURE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM USAGE 
The uncertainty of the manure management system usage data will depend on the characteristics of each 
country's livestock industry and how information on manure management is collected.   For example, for 
countries that rely almost exclusively on one type of management system, such as dry lot, the uncertainty 
associated with management system usage data can be 10% or less.    However, for countries where there is a 
wide variety of management systems used with locally different operating practices, the uncertainty in 
management system usage data can be much higher, in the range of 25% to 50%, depending on the availability 
of reliable and representative survey data that differentiates animal populations by system usage.  Preferably, 
each country should estimate the uncertainty associated with their management system usage data by using the 
methods described in Volume 1, Chapter 3.  
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use  
10.68 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
10.5.6 
Completeness, Time series, Quality assurance/Quality 
control and Reporting 
A complete inventory should estimate N2O emissions from all systems of manure management for all livestock 
species/categories. Countries are encouraged to use manure management system definitions that are consistent 
with those presented in Table 10.18. Population data should be cross-checked between main reporting 
mechanisms (such as FAO and national agricultural statistics databases) to ensure that information used in the 
inventory is complete and consistent. Because of the widespread availability of the FAO database of livestock 
information, most countries should be able to prepare, at a minimum, Tier 1 estimates for the major livestock 
categories. For more information regarding the completeness of livestock characterisation, see Section 10.2. 
Developing a consistent time series of emission estimates for this source category requires, at a minimum, the 
collection of an internally consistent time series of livestock population statistics. General guidance on the 
development of a consistent time series is addressed in Volume 1, Chapter 5 of this report. In most countries, the 
other two activity data sets required for this source category (i.e., N excretion rates and manure management 
system usage data), as well as the manure management emission factors, will be kept constant for the entire time 
series. However, in some cases, there may be reasons to modify these values over time. For example, farmers 
may alter livestock feeding practices which could affect nitrogen excretion rates.  A particular system of manure 
management may change due to operational practices or new technologies such that a revised emission factor is 
warranted. These changes in practices may be due to the implementation of explicit greenhouse gas mitigation 
measures, or may be due to changing agricultural practices without regard to greenhouse gases. Regardless of the 
driver of change, the parameters and emission factors used to estimate emissions must reflect the change. The 
inventory text should thoroughly explain how the change in farm practices or implementation of mitigation 
measures has affected the time series of activity data or emission factors.  
It is good practice to implement general quality control checks as outlined in Volume 1, Chapter 6, Quality 
Assurance/Quality Control and Verification, and expert review of the emission estimates. Additional quality 
control checks and quality assurance procedures may also be applicable, particularly if higher tier methods are 
used to determine emissions from this source. The general QA/QC related to data processing, handling, and 
reporting should be supplemented with procedures discussed below: 
Activity data check 
• 
The inventory agency should review livestock data collection methods, in particular checking that livestock 
subspecies data were collected and aggregated correctly with consideration for the duration of production 
cycles. The data should be cross-checked with previous years to ensure the data are reasonable and 
consistent with the expected trend. Inventory agencies should document data collection methods, identify 
potential areas of bias, and evaluate the representativeness of the data. 
• 
Manure management system allocation should be reviewed on a regular basis to determine if changes in the 
livestock industry are being captured. Conversion from one type of management system to another, and 
technical modifications to system configuration and performance, should be captured in the system 
modelling for the affected livestock.  
• 
National agricultural policy and regulations may have an effect on parameters that are used to calculate 
manure emissions, and should be reviewed regularly to determine what impact they may have. For example, 
guidelines to reduce manure runoff into water bodies may cause a change in management practices, and 
thus affect the N distribution for a particular livestock category. Consistency should be maintained between 
the inventory and ongoing changes in agricultural practices. 
• 
If using country-specific data for Nex(T) and MS(T,S), the inventory agency should compare these values to 
the IPCC default values. Significant differences, data sources, and methods of data derivation, should be 
documented. 
• 
The nitrogen excretion rates, whether default or country-specific values, should be consistent with feed 
intake data as determined through animal nutrition analyses. 
Review of emission factors 
• 
The inventory agency should evaluate how well the implied N2O emission factors and nitrogen excretion 
rates compare with alternative national data sources and with data from other countries with similar 
livestock practices. Significant differences should be investigated. 
• 
If using country-specific emission factors, the inventory agency should compare them to the default factors 
and note differences. The development of country-specific emission factors should be explained and 
documented, and the results peer-reviewed by independent experts.  
 Chapter 10: Emissions from Livestock and Manure Management 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
10.69 
• 
Whenever possible, available measurement data, even if they represent only a small sample of systems, 
should be reviewed relative to assumptions for N2O emission estimates. Representative measurement data 
may provide insights into how well current assumptions predict N2O production from manure management 
systems in the inventory area, and how certain factors (e.g., feed intake, system configuration, retention time) 
are affecting emissions. Because of the relatively small amount of measurement data available for these 
systems worldwide, any new results can improve the understanding of these emissions and possibly their 
prediction.  
External review 
• 
The inventory agency should utilise experts in manure management and animal nutrition to conduct expert 
peer review of the methods and data used. While these experts may not be familiar with greenhouse gas 
emissions, their knowledge of key input parameters to the emission calculation can aid in the overall 
verification of the emissions. For example, animal nutritionists can evaluate N production rates to see if 
they are consistent with feed utilization research for certain livestock species. Practicing farmers can 
provide insights into actual manure management techniques, such as storage times and mixed-system usage. 
Wherever possible, these experts should be completely independent of the inventory process in order to 
allow a true external review. 
It is good practice to document and archive all information required to produce the national emissions inventory 
estimates as outlined in Volume 1, Chapter 6, Quality Assurance/Quality Control and Verification. When 
country-specific emission factors, fractions of N losses, N excretion rates, or manure management system usage 
data have been used, the derivation of or references for these data should be clearly documented and reported 
along with the inventory results under the appropriate IPCC source category.  
N2O emissions from different types of manure management systems have to be reported according to categories 
in Table 10.18. N2O emissions from all types of manure management systems are to be reported under Manure 
Management, with two exceptions: 
• 
Emissions from the manure management system for pasture, range, and paddock are to be reported under 
the IPCC source category N2O emissions from managed soils because this manure is deposited directly on 
soils by the livestock. 
• 
Emission from the manure management system burned for fuel, are to be reported under the IPCC category 
Fuel Combustion if the dung is used as fuel and under the IPCC category Waste Incineration if the dung is 
burned without energy recovery. It should be noted, however, if the urine nitrogen is not collected for 
burning it must be reported under N2O emissions from pasture, range, and paddock animals. 
10.5.7 
Use of worksheets  
Use the worksheets for Livestock N2O contained in Annex 1 (AFOLU Worksheets) to calculate and report 
inventory information for default methodologies described in Section 10.5 N2O emission from manure 
management.  The following is a summary of the step-by-step instructions to follow when completing the 
worksheets. Note that columns are referred to using the symbols of the variables that both appear in the 
equations, as well as in column headings of the worksheets. 
Step 1: Calculation of N excretion from manure management systems (see worksheet for category Manure 
Management: Direct N2O emissions from Manure Management, Category code 3A2, Sheet 1 of 1). Make extra 
copies of the worksheet and complete one for each manure management systems (MMS). 
 
Step 1A: 
Collect population data from the Livestock Population Characterisation and enter 
corresponding values in column N(T); 
 
Step 1B: 
Use default values for Nrate and TAM (Equation 10.30 and using data from Table 10.19 and 
Tables 10A-4 to 10A-9) or develop the annual average nitrogen excretion rate per head (Nex(T)) for each 
defined livestock species/category T and enter these values in columns Nrate and TAM, or Nex(T), respectively; 
 
Step 1C: 
Enter in column MS(T,S) default values (see Tables 10A-4 through 10A-8 of Annex 10A.2) or 
determine the fraction of total annual nitrogen excretion for each livestock species/category T that is 
managed in each manure management system S (MS(T,S)); 
 
Step 1D: 
Multiply the number of heads (column N(T)) by the value of N excretion rate per head (Nex(T)) 
for each livestock species/category T (column Nex(T)) and by the fraction of manure nitrogen per MMS 
(column MS(T,S)) in order to estimate total nitrogen excretion for each MMS in kilograms per year (column 
NEMMS).  Enter the results in column NEMMS of this sheet, and in column NEMMS of Sheet 1of 2 and Sheet 2 
of 2 for worksheets under category Indirect N2O emissions from Manure Management, Category code 3C6. 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use  
10.70 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Step 2: Calculation of direct N2O emissions from manure management systems (see worksheet for category 
Manure Management: Direct N2O emissions from Manure Management, Category code 3A2, Sheet 1 of 1). 
 
Step 2A: 
Use default values (see Table 10.21) or develop direct N2O emission factors for each manure 
management system S (EF3(S)) and enter corresponding emission factor in the column EF3(S); 
 
Step 2B: 
For each manure management system type S, multiply its emission factor (column EF3(S)) by 
the amount of nitrogen managed (column NEMMS) in that system, to estimate direct N2O emissions per MMS.  
Note that emissions estimates should be reported in kg of N2O.  Enter the results in the column N2OD(mm)  of 
this sheet. 
Step 3: Calculation of indirect N2O emissions from manure management systems (see worksheet for category 
Indirect N2O emissions from Manure Management, Category code 3C6, Sheet 1 of 2). Make extra copies of the 
worksheet using one for each MMS). 
 
Step 3A: 
Enter in column FracGasMS default values (see Table 10.22) or determine country-specific 
fraction of managed livestock manure nitrogen that volatilises as NH3 and NOx for each defined livestock 
species/category T per each MMS (FracGasMS); 
 
Step 3B: 
Multiply the fraction of manure nitrogen that volatilises as NH3 and NOx (column FracGasMS) 
by the total amount of nitrogen excreted in each MMS per livestock categories (column NEMMS) to estimate 
amount of manure nitrogen that is lost due to volatilisation of NH3 and NOx (Nvolatilizations-MMS); 
 
Step 3C: 
Use default value (see Table 11.3, Chapter 11, Section 11.2 N2O emissions from managed soils) 
or develop country-specific emission factor for indirect N2O emission from atmospheric deposition of 
nitrogen on soils and water surfaces and enter the emission factor in the column EF4; 
 
Step 3D: 
Multiply the amount of manure nitrogen that is lost due to volatilisation of NH3 and NOx 
(column Nvolatilizations-MMS) by the emission factor (column EF4), to calculate annual indirect N2O emissions 
per MMS.  Note that emissions estimates should be reported in kg of N2O.  Enter the results in the column 
N2OG(mm) of this sheet. 
Step 4: Calculation of manure N that is available for application to soils or for use in feed, fuel or construction 
purposes from manure management systems (see worksheet for category Indirect N2O emissions from Manure 
Management, Category code 3C6, Sheet 2 of 2).  Make extra copies of the worksheet using one for each MMS). 
 
Step 4A: 
Enter in column FraclossMS default values (see Table 10.23) or develop country-specific fraction 
of total nitrogen loss from manure managed in each MMS for each livestock species/category T (FraclossMS); 
 
Step 4B: 
If country-specific values for organic bedding usage are available for solid storage or deep 
bedding MMS, calculate the amount of N from bedding by multiplying the number of animals associated 
with these two systems by the N content in bedding per animal. Enter results obtained in the column 
NbeddingMS.  
 
 
Step 4C: 
Calculate managed manure N available for application to managed soils, feed, fuel or 
construction using Equation 10.34 and enter obtained results in column NMMS_Avb.  Then sum over all 
manure management systems.  This value is used for calculation of N2O emissions from managed soils (see 
worksheets in Annex 1).

Manure Management System Usage (MS%)
Region 
Sources: For North America, dairy cow mass values are from Safley (2000) and VS values are estimated based on an analysis of feed data from Petersen et.al (2003). North American manure management 
system usage values are estimated using data from the 1992 and 1997 USDA's Census of Agriculture and National Animal Health Monitoring System Reports. Bo values are from Morris (1976) and 
Bryant, et.al. (1976). For Western and Eastern Europe manure management system usage, mass and VS values based on the analysis of national GHG inventories of Annex I countires submitted to the 
secretariat UNFCCC in 2004. For the rest of the world, the detailed information for dairy cows are developed in Gibbs and Johnson (1993), and manure management system usage and Bo estimates are 
from Safley et. al (1992). Methane conversion factor data are from Woodbury and Hashimoto (1993). MCFs for lagoons and liquid/slurry systems are based on data obtained from an analysis of these 
systems in the United States.
a Average dairy cow mass for each region (default estimates are ±10%)
Emission Factors (EF) for each region are calculated based on eq.10.23.
c Average VS production per head per day for the average dairy cow (default estimates are 
±20%)
b Bo estimates are ±15%
d For North America, "Other" manure management system MCFs represent deep pits, which 
have the same MCF values as Liquid/Slurry. 
1 Lagoon and Liquid/Slurry MCFs are calculated based on the van't Hoff-Arrhenius 
equation relating temperature to biological activity. Lagoon MCFs are also calculated 
based on longer (up to a year) retention times. [Mangino, et. al (2001)]

Sources: For North America, other cattle mass are from Safley (2000) and USDA's Agricultural Waste Management Field Handbook and VS values are estimated based on an analysis of feed data from 
Petersen, et.al (2003). North American manure management system usage values are estimated using data from the 1992 and 1997 USDA's Census of Agriculture and National Animal Health 
Monitoring System Reports. Bo data are values reported in Hashimoto (1981). For Western and Eastern Europe manure management system usage, average mass, Bo, and VS values based on the 
analysis of national GHG inventories of Annex I countires submitted to the secretariat UNFCCC in 2004. For the rest of the world, the detailed information for cattle are developed in Gibbs and 
Johnson (1993), and manure management system usage and Bo estimates are from Safley et. al (1992). Methane conversion factor data are from Woodbury and Hashimoto (1993).  MCFs for lagoons 
and liquid/slurry systems are based on data obtained from an analysis of these systems in the United States.
Emission Factors (EF) for each region are calculated based on eq.10.23.

b Bo estimates are ±15%
Sources: For North America, mass, VS, and Bo values are from Safley (2000), USDA's Agricultural Waste Management Field Handbook, and Hashimoto (1984), respectively. North American manure 
management system usage data are estimated using data from the 1992 and 1997 USDA's Census of Agriculture and National Animal Health Monitoring System Reports. For Western and Eastern Europe 
manure management system usage, mass of animals, Bo and VS values based on the analysis of national GHG inventories of Annex I countires submitted to the secretariat UNFCCC in 2004. For the rest 
of the world, swine feed intake data are from Crutzen et. al (1986), and manure management system usage and Bo estimates are from Safley et. al (1992). Methane conversion factor data are from 
Woodbury and Hashimoto (1993). MCFs for lagoons and liquid/slurry systems are based on data obtained from an analysis of these systems in the United States.
c Average VS production per head per day for the average breed swine (default estimates 
are ±25%)
Emission Factors (EF) for each region are calculated based on eq.10.23.
a Average breed swine mass for each region (default estimates are ±20%)
1 Lagoon and Liquid/Slurry MCFs are calculated based on the van't Hoff-Arrhenius 
equation relating temperature to biological activity. Lagoon MCFs are also calculated 
based on longer (up to a year) retention times. [Mangino, et. al (2001)]

Emission factors, except for poultry, were developed from feed intake values and feed digestibilities used to develop the enteric fermentation emission factors (see Appendix 10A.1). MCFs and Bo values are reported in Woodbury 
and Hashimoto (1993). All manure except for Layers (wet) is assumed to be managed in dry systems, which is consistent with the manure management system usage reported in Woodbury and Hashimoto (1993). Poultry for 
developed countries was subdivided into five categories. Layers (dry) represent layers in a "without bedding" waste management system; Layers (wet) represent layers in an anaerobic lagoon waste managemnet system. 
Estimates of animal mass are ±30%, VS values are ±50% and Bo values are ±15%
