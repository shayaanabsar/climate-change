determine MCFs.  If no data are available, as a default, use 0 for aerobic systems, and
1.0 for anaerobic.4
Since aerobic and anaerobic handling are the only handling systems considered, the CH4
conversion rate can be used to characterise a broad range of systems falling between
aerobic and anaerobic handling systems.
Equation 10 presents the emission factor calculation for wastewater:
EQUATION 10
EFi = Boi x ∑ (WSix x MCFx )
where:
EFi
=
emission factor (kg CH4 /kg DC) for wastewater type (e.g., fertiliser
industry, domestic, etc.)
Boi
=
maximum methane producing capacity (kg CH4/kg DC) for
wastewater type i
WSix
=
fraction of wastewater type i treated using wastewater handling
system x
MCFx
=
methane conversion factors of each wastewater system x
Equation 11 presents the emission factor calculation for sludge:
EQUATION 11
EFj = Boj x ∑(SSjy x MCFy)
where:
EFj
=
emission factor (kg CH4 /kg DC) for sludge type j (e.g., fertiliser
industry wastewater, domestic wastewater, etc.)
Boj
=
maximum methane producing capacity (kg CH4/kg DC) for sludge type 
j
SSjy
=
fraction of sludge type j treated using sludge handling system y
MCFy
=
methane conversion factors of each sludge handling system y (See
footnote 4)
                                                  
     4 If sludge is disposed of in landfills then the resulting emissions are already accounted
for in the IPCC/OECD SWDS emission methodology (Section 6.2.4).  If sludge is
incinerated or burned as part of an energy recovery system, then the resulting emissions
should be reported for in the Energy Chapter, classified as an industrial waste fuel.  In
these cases, to ensure that emissions are not counted twice an “MCF” of zero should be
used in this methodology for sludge disposed in SWDSs or incinerated, or burned as part
of an energy recovery system.  In all other cases, an appropriate MCF value should be
selected based on the specific characteristics of the system used to dispose of the sludge.

Step 3 - Wastewater Emissions
To estimate total emissions from wastewater, the selected emissions factors are multiplied
by the associated organic wastewater production and summed.  Subtract the amount of
CH4, if any, that is recovered and thus not emitted into the atmosphere for each handling
method.  If no data are readily available, the default assumption is that this amount is zero.
Sum the results for each handling method to determine total CH4 emissions from
wastewater.  In equation form, the estimate of total CH4 emissions from wastewater
handling is as follows:
EQUATION 12
WM = Σi (TOWi x EFi - MRi)
where:
WM
=
total methane emissions from wastewater in kg CH4
TOWi
=
total organic waste for wastewater type i in kg DC/yr.  For domestic
streams, the DC is BOD; for industrial streams it is the COD (Step
1)
EFi
=
emission factor for wastewater type i in kg CH4/kg DC (Step 2)
MRi
=
total amount of methane recovered or flared from wastewater type i
in kg CH4.  If no data are available, use the default value of zero
Step 4 - Sludge Emissions
To estimate total emissions from sludge, the selected emissions factors are multiplied by
the associated organic sludge production and summed.  Subtract the amount of CH4, if
any, that is recovered and thus not emitted into the atmosphere for each handling
method.  If no data are readily available, the default assumption is that this amount is zero.
Sum the results for each handling method to determine total CH4 emissions from
wastewater.  In equation form, the estimate of total CH4 emissions from sludge handling is
as follows:
EQUATION 13
SM = ∑j (TOSj x EFj - MRj)
where:
SM
=
total methane emissions from sludge in kg CH4
TOSj
=
total organic waste for sludge type j in kg DC/yr.  For domestic
streams, the DC is BOD; for industrial streams it is COD (Step 1)
EFj
=
emission factor for sludge type j in kg CH4/kg DC (Step 2)
MRj
=
total amount of methane recovered or flared from sludge type j in kg
CH4.  If no data are available, the default is zero

Step 5 - Total Emissions
Total emissions from wastewater and sludge can be determined by summing the results of
Steps 3 and 4.  This is expressed as follows in Equation 14:
EQUATION 14
TM = WM + SM
where:
TM
=
total methane from wastewater and sludge handling in kg CH4
WM
=
total methane emissions from wastewater in kg CH4
SM
=
total methane emissions from sludge in kg CH4

The quality of CH4 emissions estimates for wastewater handling is directly related to the
quality and availability of the waste management data used to derive these estimates.
Country specific data on wastewater quantities, characteristics, and wastewater
management methods are very limited.  The principal sources of uncertainty are described
below.
Organic Wastewater Quantity and Composition
Often the amount of degradable organic wastewater that is produced and the volumes
handled in the various systems is not well known.  Consequently, limitations exist for
quantifying the fraction of wastewater subject to specific systems.
Physical and Chemical Data
Country-specific data on wastewater characteristics are very limited.  For example,
reported organic component values in industrial source categories are averages from
several processes.  Accurate and detailed data on the chemical characteristics and volumes
of process wastewater streams could improve the emissions estimates.
Wastewater Handling Facility Efficiency and Output
Aerobically treated wastewater by handling plants may be subject to anaerobic conditions
due to poorly managed and functioning facilities.  This contributes to an underestimate of
emissions.  Additionally, current estimates from wastewater handling lagoons are relatively
uncertain due to the limited available data.  Work is on-going to develop better emission
factors from these sources.

Nitrous Oxide from Human Sewage
Since N2O emissions from human sewage are closely linked to the agricultural N cycle,
the method is further discussed in the Agriculture Chapter.  For a detailed description of
the proposed methodology, the reader is referred to Section 4.5.4 (on indirect N2O
emissions from nitrogen used in agriculture).
The emissions of N2O from human sewage are calculated as follows:
EQUATION 15
N2O(S) = Protein x FracNPR x NRPEOPLE x EF6
where:
N2O(s)
=
N2O emissions from human sewage (kg N2O-N/yr)
Protein
=
annual per capita protein intake (kg/person/yr)
NRPEOPLE
=
number of people in country
EF6
=
emissions factor (default 0.01 (0.002-0.12) kg N2O-N/kg sewage-
N produced) (See Table 4-18 in Agriculture Chapter)
FracNPR
=
fraction of nitrogen in protein (default = 0.16 kg N/kg protein)
(See Table 4-19 in Agriculture Chapter)
6.5 
Emissions from Waste Incineration
6 . 5 . 1  I n t r o d u c t i o n
Waste incineration like other types of combustion, is a source of GHG emissions.  Few
data have been compiled on the global emissions from waste incineration.  Preliminary
indicators are that this source represents a small percentage of the total GHG output
from the waste source category.
6 . 5 . 2  E m i s s i o n s
Certainly waste incineration produces CO2, but it is difficult to identify the portion which
should be considered net emissions.  A large fraction of the carbon in waste combusted
(e.g., paper, food waste) is derived from biomass raw materials which are replaced by
regrowth on an annual basis.  These emissions should not be considered net
anthropogenic CO2 emissions in the IPCC Methodology.  If the agricultural or forestry
sources are not being sustainably managed, net CO2 emissions (equivalent to reductions
in biomass stocks) should be accounted for in those source categories.  On the other
hand, some carbon in waste is in the form of plastics or other products based on fossil
fuel.  Combustion of these materials, like fossil fuel combustion, releases net CO2
emissions.  In estimating emissions from waste incineration, the desired approach is to
separate carbon in the incinerated waste into biomass and fossil fuel based fractions.
Only the fossil based portion should be considered net carbon emissions.  Any such
detailed analysis should ensure that carbon emissions are not double counted in the
treatment of stored carbon under energy emissions.  See Overview to the IPCC Guidelines.

6.29
A recent Belgian analysis (Debruyn and Van Rensbergen, 1994) offers an example of a
very detailed approach.
Other relevant gases released from combustion are net GHG emissions.  Methane
emissions from waste incineration are highly uncertain.  An expert working group
recognised waste incineration as a source of methane production, but was not able to
give global estimates or default emissions factors.  Although this source is considered to
be relatively small compared to the other CH4 sources in waste, it was recognised as an
area for further research in the future (Berdowski et al., 1993).
Recent studies have also shown that N2O may be an important GHG produced from
incineration.  Table 6-10 provides data from studies of several incineration plants and the
N2O produced from the waste incineration (de Soete, 1993).  Studies in Belgium (IPCC,
1993), Japan (Tanaka et al., 1992) and Norway (Rosland, 1993) have estimated N2O
production from their waste incineration processes.  It has also been found that the
emission level depends on the nature of the waste burned.  Research in Japan has noted
that while all types of incineration produce N2O, sludge incinerators produce the highest
emissions rates (Tanaka et al., 1992).
Traditional air pollutants from combustion - NOx, CO, NMVOC - are characterised in
existing emissions inventory systems.  The IPCC does not provide a new methodology for
these gases, but recommends that national experts use existing published methods.  Some
key examples of the current literature providing methods are: Default Emission Factor
Handbook (CORINAIR, 1994), as well as the US EPA's Compilation of Air Pollutant
Emissions Factors (AP-42) (US EPA, 1985) and Criteria Pollutant Emission Factors for the
1985 NAPAP Emissions Inventory (Stockton and Stelling, 1987).
