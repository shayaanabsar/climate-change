7 PRECURSORS AND INDIRECT EMISSIONS 
7.1 
INTRODUCTION 
Although they are not included in global warming potential-weighted greenhouse gas emission totals, emissions of 
carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), and 
sulphur dioxide (SO2) are reported in greenhouse gas inventories. Carbon monoxide (CO), Nitrogen oxides (NOx) 
and NMVOC in the presence of sunlight contribute to the formation of the greenhouse gas ozone (O3) in the 
troposphere and are therefore often called ‘ozone precursors’. Furthermore, NOx emission plays an important role in 
the earth’s nitrogen cycle. Sulphur Dioxide emissions lead to formation of sulphate particles, which also play a role 
in climate change. Ammonia (NH3) is an aerosol precursor, but is less important for aerosol formation than SO2. 
Section 7.2 addresses the estimation and reporting of the precursors for national inventories. The methodologies 
for ambient air quality emission inventories have been elaborated in detail in the EMEP1/CORINAIR Emission 
Inventory Guidebook (Guidebook), and these methodologies for CO, NOx, NMVOCs, and SO2 emissions are 
referenced in this chapter rather than to be included in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas 
Inventories (2006 Guidelines). Exceptions are for sources not well-covered by the Guidebook. 
Section 7.3 addresses nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions that result from the deposition of the nitrogen emitted as NOx 
and NH3. Nitrous oxide is produced in soils through the biological processes of nitrification and denitrification. 
Simply defined, nitrification is the aerobic microbial oxidation of ammonium to nitrate and denitrification is the 
anaerobic microbial reduction of nitrate to nitrogen gas (N2). Nitrous oxide is a gaseous intermediate in the reaction 
sequence of denitrification and a by-product of nitrification that leaks from microbial cells into the soil atmosphere. 
One of the main controlling factors in this reaction is the availability of inorganic nitrogen in the soil and therefore 
deposition of nitrogen resulting from NOx and ammonia (NH3) will enhance emissions. N2O emissions will also be 
enhanced if nitrogen is deposited in the ocean or in lakes. For this reason the 2006 Guidelines include guidance for 
estimating N2O emissions resulting from nitrogen deposition of all anthropogenic sources of NOx and NH3. Only 
agricultural sources of nitrogen were considered in the Revised 1996 Guidelines (IPCC, 1997).  
Guidance is provided in Section 7.3 on estimating N2O emissions from atmospheric deposition resulting from all 
categories except agricultural soil management and manure management. Section 7.3 provides information on 
NOx emissions. Countries may use national methodologies to estimate emissions of NH3 not originating from 
agriculture. NH3 emissions are also covered in the EMEP/CORINAIR Emission Inventory Guidebook. 
7.2 
PRECURSOR EMISSIONS 
Where the country already has inventories for precursors, the results should be reported in the inventory. In some 
countries, air pollutant emission inventories are collected via separate procedures than the inventory of direct 
greenhouse gases, and the methods to produce these inventories can differ from those for greenhouse gases. Also, 
while the greenhouse gas emissions and sinks inventories are often based on national statistics, air pollutant 
emission inventories are often developed using plant specific data. Countries should consider whether there is any 
scope for improving consistency between inventories or cross-checking estimates. 
Detailed methodologies for estimating the emissions of precursors are provided in the EMEP/CORINAIR 
Emission Inventory Guidebook (http://reports.eea.eu.int/EMEPCORINAIR4/en). This guidebook has been 
developed for emission inventories of substances regulated under the UNECE Convention on Long-Range 
Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP) (see Box 7.1) and covers all source sectors and should therefore be 
considered as primary source of information for estimation of these emissions. 
Table 7.1 provides a linkage between the IPCC categories and the corresponding methodology chapters in the 
EMEP/CORINAIR Guidebook. This table provides information on the specific EMEP/CORINAIR chapters that list 
methodologies for preparing NOx, CO, NMVOCs, NH3 and SO2
2
 inventories. It also includes information on the 
availability of methods and the significant precursor emissions from particular categories.  
Some of the methodologies and emission factors in the EMEP/CORINAIR Guidebook are technology-specific 
and are relevant to conditions and categories in both developed and developing countries. However, for some 
                                                           
1  Cooperative programme for the monitoring and evaluation of the long-range transmission of air pollutants in Europe   
(EMEP). 
2  The EMEP/CORINAIR Nomenclature for Reporting (NFR) source categories have been developed to be compatible to the 
IPCC reporting categories.

sectors, like solvents, small combustion sources (biomass in particular) and open burning, differences between 
the developed and developing countries may be larger, and the EMEP/CORINAIR Guidebook should be used 
with great care. 
BOX 7.1 
 CLRTAP AND EMISSION INVENTORY GUIDEBOOK 
The Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution has been in force since 1979 and 
includes eight protocols with requirements to reduce emissions and technical annexes on 
abatement techniques. More detailed information on the Convention is available at 
http://www.unece.org/env/lrtap/welcome.html. As emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx), carbon 
monoxide (CO), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), and sulphur dioxide (SO2) 
are reported both to the UNFCCC and UNECE CLRTAP it is important to ensure consistent 
methodologies and reporting between these two Conventions. (UNECE, 2003) 
The EMEP/CORINAIR Guidebook has been prepared by the LRTAP Task Force on Emission 
Inventories and Projections (TFEIP) and is updated regularly by the Expert Panels under the 
TFEIP (http://tfeip-secretariat.org/unece.htm) to provide comprehensive information and 
methodologies for estimating emissions. The EMEP/CORINAIR Emission Inventory Guidebook is 
published by the European Environment Agency (EEA). 
 
7.2.1 
Inventory of precursors 
An inventory of precursors typically includes oxides of nitrogen, carbon monoxide, non-methane volatile organic 
compounds, and emissions of sulphur compounds. When estimating emissions of these air pollutants, the use of 
detailed process or facility-specific data (bottom-up data) gives more accurate estimates than the use of general 
aggregated emission factors. For all pollutants and source categories it is critical to apply methodologies and 
emission factors that account for the presence of any emission controls or abatement measures. For large point 
sources many countries have a registry of individual air quality pollutant emissions reported by the plants. When 
using data reported by the plants it is good practice to ensure that emissions are not double counted with the top-
down inventory data. Data reported by the plants can also be used to check completeness of the inventory. 
7.2.1.1 
ENERGY 
For most countries, road transportation will be a major source of NOx, CO, and NMVOC emissions. Public 
electricity and heat production will likely be the major source of SO2 emissions in countries where coal is used 
extensively, and also an important source of NOx emissions. Industrial combustion will also be a source of SO2, 
NOx and CO emissions and residential combustion a source of CO emissions. Oil production will likely be a 
source of NMVOC, NOx, and, CO emissions in countries that produce oil and gas. 
Most NOx emissions resulting from fuel combustion are typically ‘fuel-NO’ that is formed from the conversion 
of chemically bound nitrogen in the fuel. The content of nitrogen in different fuel varies. Depending on the 
combustion temperature, thermal-NOx can also be formed from nitrogen contained in the combustion intake air. 
Carbon monoxide and NMVOCs are generated during under-stoichiometric combustion conditions and are 
dependent on a variety of factors, including fuel type and combustion conditions. 
Emissions of sulphur oxides (SOx) are primarily related to the sulphur content of the fuel, although some sulphur 
can be retained in the ash. Abatement in stationary combustion can reduce the amount emitted. 
7.2.1.2 
INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES AND PRODUCT USE 
Industrial processes can generate NOx, CO, NMVOC and SO2 emissions. Emissions of these gases depend on the 
type of process, abatement techniques, and other conditions. Industrial process and product use emissions include 
both channelled emissions (e.g., point sources emissions from a stack) and diffuse emission sources. For example, 
diffuse emissions from the evaporation of solvents and storage and handling of products are typical primary sources 
of NMVOC emissions. In some cases, exceptional emissions (e.g., accidental releases) can constitute major 
emissions from source. Further guidance on estimating total emissions from an industrial site are provided in the 
EU IPPC (European Union Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control) Reference Document on Monitoring of 
Volume 1: General Guidance and Reporting

Emissions (EC, 2002) 3.  
7.2.1.3 
AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY AND OTHER LAND USE 
The burning of crop residues emits NOx as does the addition of nitrogen to the soils from nitrogen fertilizers and other 
nutrients. CO and SO2 are emitted when biomass is burned. The primary sources of the NMVOC emissions are 
burning of crop residues and other plant wastes, and the anaerobic degradation of livestock feed and animal excreta. 
Plants, mainly trees and cereals, also contribute to NMVOC concentrations in the atmosphere. 
The EMEP/CORINAIR Guidebook does not fully cover emissions from burning of biomass, therefore additional 
guidance is given in AFOLU Volume, Chapter 4.2.4 for Non-CO2 emissions from biomass burning from forest, 
Chapter 5.2.4 and 5.3.4 for Non-CO2 emissions from biomass burning in Cropland, and Chapter 6.2.4 and 6.3.4 
for Non-CO2 emissions from biomass burning in Grassland (CO, CH4, N2O, NOx). Biomass burning when forest 
and grasslands are converted to other uses, forest fires, and biomass burning due to forest management practices 
are discussed in these chapters of Volume 4 for AFOLU sector. 
7.2.1.4 
WASTE 
Emissions of NOx, CO, and SO2 are produced by domestic and municipal waste incineration processes as well as 
the incineration of sledges from wastewater treatment. NMVOC emissions can originate from wastewater 
treatment plants and solid waste disposal on land. 
 
7.2.1.5 
CARBON EMITTTED IN GASES OTHER THAN CO2 
The 2006 Guidelines estimate carbon emissions in terms of the species which are emitted. Most of the carbon 
emitted in the form of non-CO2 species eventually oxidises to CO2 in the atmosphere and this amount can be 
estimated from the emissions estimates of the non-CO2 gases. Box 7.2 provides an approach for making this 
calculation. 
In some cases the emissions of these non-CO2 gases contain very small amounts of carbon compared to the CO2 
estimate and it may be more accurate to base the CO2 estimate on the total carbon. Examples are fossil fuel 
combustion (where the emission factor is derived from the carbon content of the fuel) and a few IPPU categories 
where the carbon mass balance can be estimated much better than individual gases.  
BOX 7.2  
CALCULATING CO2 INPUTS TO THE ATMOSPHERE FROM EMISSIONS OF CARBON-CONTAINING COMPOUNDS 
Methane, carbon monoxide (CO) or NMVOC emissions will eventually be oxidised to CO2 in the 
atmosphere. These CO2 inputs could be included in national inventories. They can be calculated 
from emissions of methane, CO and NMVOCs. The basic calculation principles are: 
From CH4:  
InputsCO2 =  EmissionsCH4 • 44/16 
From CO:  
InputsCO2 =  EmissionsCO • 44/28 
From NMVOC:  
InputsCO2 =  EmissionsNMVOC • C • 44/12 
Where C is the fraction carbon in NMVOC by mass (default  = 0.6) 
The carbon content in NMVOCs will vary depending on the source. Therefore, an inventory based 
on the speciation of the NMVOC compounds gives more accurate results. 
In making these estimates inventory compilers should assess each category to ensure that this 
carbon is not already covered by the assumptions and approximations made in estimating CO2 
emissions. Relevant examples include carbon from; 
• 
Fugitive emissions from energy use, 
• 
Carbon from Non-CO2 gases from IPPU, 
• 
AFOLU emissions where non-CO2 gases have been explicitly deducted.

Link to relevant methodology chapters in the 
EMEP/CORINAIR Emission Inventory Guidebook 
Table 7.1 provides specific information on methodologies for preparing national emission inventories of NOx, 
CO, NMVOCs, and SO2. The table includes information on the availability of methodologies in the 
EMEP/CORINAIR Emission Inventory Guidebook and the expected significance of the emissions for each IPCC 
category under the 2006 Guidelines (see Table 8.2 of Chapter 8 of this Volume) and gas. The Guidebook’s codes 
are equivalents in function to the IPCC reporting categories under the 1996 Guidelines. A mapping between the 
EMEP/CORINAIR Nomenclature for Reporting (NFR) and the IPCC common reporting framework (CRF) of 
the 1996 Guidelines with categories under the 2006 Guidelines is also provided in the table.  
In case the inventory compiler does not find a corresponding category to a specific IPCC 2006 category in Table 
7.1, it is advisable to attempt to find a similar category (e.g., a corresponding boiler size for another industrial 
branch) in Table 7.1 and apply the corresponding methodology in the EMEP/CORINAIR Emission Inventory 
Guidebook for this category or to search for other sources of information (see also Chapter 2 of this Volume). 
The following codes are used to indicate whether the emissions from the specific source are relevant and covered 
by the Guidebook: 
A 
=  Emissions of this gas from this category are likely to be emitted and a methodology is provided 
in the EMEP/CORINAIR Guidebook. 
NI 
=  Emissions of this gas from this category are likely to be emitted, but a methodology is not 
currently included in the EMEP/CORINAIR Guidebook. 
B 
=  Emissions of this air pollutant from this category are likely to be emitted and the methodology 
may be included in the EMEP/CORINAIR Guidebook in the future. 
NS =  Emissions of this gas from this category not expected to be significant. 
NO =  Emissions of this gas from this category do not occur.

Chapter 7: Precursors and Indirect Emissions 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
7.15 
7.3 
INDIRECT N2O EMISSIONS FROM THE 
ATMOSPHERIC DEPOSITION OF NITROGEN 
IN NOX AND NH3 
In this Guidance, direct nitrous oxide emissions are estimated on the basis of human-induced net nitrogen input 
to managed soils (e.g., synthetic or organic fertilizers, deposited manure, crop residues, sewage sludge), or of 
other changes in inorganic nitrogen in the soil as a result of interventions by management practices in nitrogen 
cycling,  e.g., mineralization of nitrogen in soil organic matter, following drainage/management of organic soils, 
or cultivation/land use change on mineral soils. 
In addition to these direct emissions of N2O, indirect emissions also take place as a result of two different 
nitrogen loss pathways. These pathways are (1) the volatilization/emission of nitrogen as NH3 and NOx and the 
subsequent deposition of these forms of nitrogen as ammonium (NH4
+) and oxidised nitrogen (NOx) on soils and 
waters, and (2) the leaching and runoff of nitrogen from synthetic and organic nitrogen fertilizer inputs, crop 
residues, mineralization of nitrogen through land use change or management practices, and urine and dung 
deposition from grazing animals, into groundwater, riparian areas and wetlands, rivers and eventually the coastal 
ocean.  
The volatilization of nitrogen as NH3 and NOx results both from agricultural fertilizer applied to land and from 
manure management, as well as from fossil fuel and biomass combustion, and industrial processes. Before being 
redeposited, NOx and NH3 are typically transformed to other nitrogen containing compounds. Oxides of nitrogen 
are commonly hydrolysed in the atmosphere or upon deposition to form nitric acid (HNO3), while NH3 gas 
generally combines with atmospheric nitric acid or sulphuric acid (H2SO4) to form ammonium nitrate and 
ammonium sulphate aerosols, which are then transformed to a particulate ammonium (NH4
+) form. The 
deposition of these reactive nitrogen compounds from non-agricultural sources onto soils and waters causes N2O 
emissions in an exactly analogous way to those resulting from their deposition from agricultural sources. 
Therefore the indirect N2O emissions resulting from these various sources are included in these Guidelines using 
the assumption that same emission factor applies to soil and water deposition. 
7.3.1 
Methodology  
All anthropogenic NH3 or NOx emissions are potential sources of N2O emissions4. Specific guidance on 
estimating N2O emissions from that portion of nitrogen compounds associated with the volatilisation of NOx and 
NH3 from (1) manure management systems and applied sewage sludge and (2) synthetic and organic nitrogen 
input to managed soils, and urine and dung nitrogen deposited by grazing animals, are provided in Section 10.5 
of Chapter 10, Emissions from livestock and manure management, and Section 11.2.2 of Chapter 11, N2O and 
CO2 emissions from soil amendment, of Volume 4 of AFOLU.  
This section provides guidance on estimating N2O emissions from the atmospheric deposition of nitrogen 
compounds from all other sources of NOx and NH3 emissions, such as fuel combustion, industrial processes, and 
burning of crop residues and agricultural wastes. The method needs only to be applied where data on NOx and 
NH3 emissions from these sources are available, e.g., from the inventories identified Section 7.2.    
Equation 7.1 and EF4 from Equation 11.9 in Section 11.2.2.1 of Volume 4 can be used to estimate N2O 
emissions from the atmospheric deposition of nitrogen resulting from NOx and NH3.

4   In addition to being redeposited on soils and surface waters, NH3 can also lead to the formation of N2O from atmospheric 
chemical reactions.  However, there is currently no method available for estimating conversion of NH3 to N2O in the 
atmosphere.

2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Where: 
N2O(i)  
=  
N2O produced from atmospheric deposition of N from NOx and NH3 emissions from 
source i, in Gg 
NOx-N(i)  =  
Nitrogen content of NOx emissions from source i assuming that NOx is reported in NO2 
equivalents (Gg NOx-N or Gg NO2 • 14/46) 
NH3-N(i)  =  
Nitrogen content of NH3 emissions from source i (Gg NH3-N or Gg NH3 • 14/17) 
EF4  
=  
Emission factor for N2O emissions from atmospheric deposition of N on soils and water 
surfaces (kg N2O-N/kg NH3-N or NOx-N emitted).  
 
 
The activity data NOx-N(i) and NH3 –N(i) are taken from the inventories as identified in 
Section 7.2, if available. 
This method assumes that N2O emissions from atmospheric deposition are reported by the country that produced 
the original NOx and NH3 emissions. In reality the ultimate formation of N2O may occur in another country due 
to atmospheric transport of emissions. The method also does not account for the probable lag time between NOx 
and NH3 emissions and subsequent production of N2O in soils and surface waters. This time lag is expected to be 
small relative to an annual reporting cycle.  
7.3.2 
Quality Assurance/Quality Control, Reporting and 
Documentation 
It is good practice to estimate and report N2O emissions from atmospheric deposition of NOx and NH3 where a 
country already has an inventory of these gases. For the purposes of calculation, it is assumed that N2O is 
emitted in the same year that the original NOx and NH3 were emitted.  
It is good practice to estimate emissions ensuring consistency with the emissions estimated for agriculture 
sources and avoiding double-counting. Because N2O emissions may occur outside the country emitting NH3 or 
NOx, use of country- or region-specific emission factors should be thoroughly documented. 
N2O emissions from atmospheric deposition of NH3 and NOx are reported in Table 5A of reporting tables in 
Annex 8A.2 for all sectors, and the AFOLU Sector is also reported in Table 3.8 in Annex 8A.2.
