REPORTING THE NATIONAL
INVENTORY
This chapter contains step by step instructions for reporting a national
greenhouse gas inventory.
How To Report Your Inventory
 At the end of these reporting instructions you should have
•
filled in the Sectoral Report Tables
•
filled in the Summary Report and Overview Tables
•
prepared an Inventory Report which contains the required numerical
and text documentation (see step 5)
Do Step 1 if you have an existing inventory and would like to report it to
the IPCC.  If you are working  from a completed CORINAIR inventory (see
Annex 2).  If you are using the Workbook methods and you now want to
report your inventory, go directly to Step 2 to begin to fill out the Sectoral
Report  Tables.
Remember that the Reference Manual (Volume 3) contains background
information and full explanations of the methodologies referred to here.

You are requested to provide a complete inventory for 1990. This should
include all anthropogenic emissions by source and removals by sink of
greenhouse gases and ozone precursors, except those covered by the
Montreal Protocol.
You  have the option to add other greenhouse gases or precursors to your
inventory report.  If you add other gases you should use the IPCC source
category structure as far as possible. If you add or change the definitions of
any categories to report these additional gases, you should clearly explain
these changes. Use the spare copies of Tables 7A & 7B with blank column
headings to report these emissions. Countries that wish to report Montreal
Protocol  substances for completeness may do so using this procedure.

All estimates should be reported in gigagrams (Gg) of the pollutant.
Preferred units for activity data, emission factors and other data are
indicated in each of the worksheets of the Workbook (Volume 2).

S o u r c e / S i n k  C a t e g o r i e s
Your emissions inventories should use the IPCC source/sink categories as
far as possible. The structure for reporting inventory information is
summarised in the preceding chapter and in the Tables in this book.
Compare the IPCC source/sink categories (Chapter 1: Understanding the
Common Reporting Framework) with the categories already used in your
national inventory.  Where there are differences it may be possible to
allocate a larger category among appropriate smaller IPCC categories.
Alternatively, if there is no way to allocate the category, you could report
several of your smaller categories at a higher level of aggregation in the
IPCC structure. .
If your inventory cannot be re-structured to fit the IPCC model, or if you
must show estimates under an "other" category, you should:
•
explain precisely where there are differences and what they are, and
•
explain precisely what is included in "other" categories.
T i m e  P e r i o d s
Inventories are prepared on a calendar year basis.  In the Agriculture and
Land-Use Change/Forestry categories, it may be desirable to estimate
average emissions over a several year period. The Workbook methods
describe default recommendations which are summarised in the table
below.

clearly footnote on the corresponding table(s) any differences and provide
an explanation of the differences in the documentation note of the
inventory. If you have estimated ranges of uncertainty for emission or
supporting data, read Task (c) of this step before beginning.
Task a: Complete Sectoral Report Tables.  
EITHER:
transfer emission estimates data from worksheets
OR
convert your existing inventory data into Sectoral Report  format
(Tables 1 to 6).  As explained above under Step 1, this may
require transforming your data to fit the IPCC source/sink
category structure.
Task b: Complete Summary Report Tables.
This is done by transferring data from the Sectoral Report Tables into
Summary Report Tables 7A & 7B.
Task c: Report Uncertainty Ranges
An approach to estimating the uncertainty associated with point emission
estimates and emission factors is described in Annex 1.
If you have ranges of uncertainty for point emission estimates by
source/sink of greenhouse gas, as well as for emission factors or activity
data, you can report the ranges by using the same Sectoral and Summary
Report Tables. These tables should be in addition to the point estimates
that are requested in Task (a) and (b) of this Step (above).
If you have ranges that you would like to report, please:
•
make copies of the Sectoral or Summary Report Tables.
•
mark them clearly with a heading "UNCERTAINTY RANGES"  and the
corresponding uncertainty area, e.g. EMISSION ESTIMATES, EMISSION
FACTORS and/or ACTIVITY DATA.
•
for each data point fill in the ranges if available.

Task a: Checking Results
Countries are asked to carry out the following types of verification and
summarise results (in text form) in the inventory report:
•
checks for arithmetic errors
•
checks of country estimates against independently published estimates
•
checks of national activity data with international statistics (default data)
•
checks of CO2 emissions from fuel combustion calculated using national
methods with the IPCC Reference Approach (see below).
Further verification checks that may be done centrally, or assisted centrally
are:
•
cross-country comparisons of estimates through use of a single set of
source categories
CONVERTING CORINAIR
INVENTORIES
CORINAIR is one type of detailed
inventory system. Guidance for
converting a CORINAIR Inventory
into an IPCC inventory is given in
Annex 2.

cross-country comparisons of emission factors
A more detailed sample set of questions for countries to consider in
reviewing the quality of their own inventories is provided below.
V e r i f i c a t i o n
In completing the inventory you should also make a report in which you summarise
the verification procedures you have used. This report should include an overall
assessment of the quality and completeness of each of the main source and sink
estimates for each greenhouse gas. You should ask yourself the following questions
about your inventory when attempting to provide an overall assessment of the
inventory’s quality and completeness.
M e t h o d
•
Is the approach well documented and reproducible?
•
Have results been checked against other methods of estimation?
•
Are measurement data part of the estimate?  If so, has the source activity been
summarised in part (for the remaining non-measured part of the activity) and
has it been summarised in total?  Have you verified that the emissions from a
given activity are not included in several source categories?
E m i s s i o n  e s t i m a t e s
•
Have any estimates been compared with measured emission and concentration
data?
•
In some instances it is possible to cross-check emission estimates against
roughly comparable statistics (e.g. for NMVOC, solvent production + imports
- exports should equal total of applications).  Have these checks been done
and if so how do these data compare?
•
Have results been compared for reasonableness with outside or independently
published estimates? This could include comparison with estimates from a
country of similar size or economic profile.
A c t i v i t y  d a t a  a s s u m p t i o n s
•
Does the level of activity reported cross-check reasonably well with other
sources of information on this activity, e.g. with international statistics?
•
Do units match emission factors reported?
E m i s s i o n  f a c t o r s
•
Do emission factors represent operating cycles or conditions from the region
reporting?
•
Are the sources of emission factors well documented? Are the conventions
the same as those found in the activity data e.g. using net calorific value?
•
Have emission factors been compared with other sources (taking into account
technologies, maintenance, operating cycles, or other conditions that may
influence emission factors)?
If you have already performed some verification, please describe what you
did and what you found.

Task b: CO2 from Fuel Combustion - Standard Verification
With respect to CO2 emissions from energy, all users are asked to provide
a standard set of information that will assist the verification process.  This
means that:
•
Users who have estimated their CO2 emissions from energy using the
Reference Approach outlined in Volume 2 of the Guidelines should
include the worksheets used to estimate these emissions in the
documentation submitted with their inventory.
•
Users who have used their own methodology or the IPCC Sectoral
Approach to estimate CO2 emissions from energy should present the
results of their work in the Sectoral Table for Energy provided in the
Reporting Instructions, along with the worksheets used for
calculations. They should also estimate their CO2 emissions from
energy using the Reference Approach provided in Volume 2 of the
Guidelines. It is recommended that users provide (in text form) an
explanation for any significant differences between these two sets of
results.
Task c: Assessing Quality
Prepare a brief self-assessment of the quality of the resulting inventory and of
the verification that has been performed. A simplified format for reporting on
the quality and completeness of the inventory is suggested in the Overview
Table and Disaggregation Key (Tables 8A and 8B) in this book. This should be
included with the other tables in the Inventory Report.

of greenhouse gases and precursors;
•
clearly describe the estimation methods, as well as major assumptions
that may not have been captured in the worksheets , for all greenhouse
gases contained in the inventory;
•

DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS
•  National inventory reports should
provide minimum information to
enable 
the 
results 
to 
be
reconstructed, and to justify the
choice of methodology and data
used.  This means, for example, that
to the extent possible, activity data
should be provided at the level of
detail at which the emissions are
estimated.
•  If worksheets from Volume 2 of
the Guidelines have been used to
estimate greenhouse gas emissions
in the inventory, these worksheets
should be part of the documentation
included 
in 
the 
inventory
submission. Comparable worksheets
should be provided when estimation
procedures other than the IPCC
Guidelines are used.
•  Documentation should contain
enough 
information 
to 
explain
differences 
between 
national
methods and data, and the IPCC
default methods and assumptions.
Reasons for the differences should
be 
explained 
and 
sources 
of
emission factors and other national
data should also be clearly cited.
Minimum 
requirements 
include:
emission factors, activity data, and a
list of references documenting any
differences from IPCC recommend-
ations.
•  Measurement studies containing
new values should be referenced,
and made available upon request. It
is preferable that new emission
factors be taken from published
sources.
•  Any significant changes in
emission 
factors 
and 
other
assumptions from those used in
previous inventories that have been
submitted 
should 
be 
clearly
referenced and explained.
•  Documentation should be kept
for future years (by the country and
by the IPCC) and countries are
encouraged 
to 
publish 
the
documentation of their inventories.
This extensive record keeping will
facilitate 
the 
recalculation 
of
historical inventory estimates when
changes in national methods or
assumptions occur.
