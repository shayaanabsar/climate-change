Methane Emissions from Rice Cultivation:
Flooded Rice Fields
4 . 3 . 1  O v e r v i e w
Anaerobic decomposition of organic material in flooded rice fields produces methane
(CH4), which escapes to the atmosphere primarily by diffusive transport through the rice
plants during the growing season.  Upland rice fields, which are not flooded and therefore
do not produce significant quantities of CH4, account for approximately 10 per cent of
the global rice production and about 15 per cent of the global rice area under cultivation.
The remaining area is grown for wetland rice, consisting of irrigated, rainfed, and
deepwater rice.  The global wetland rice area harvested annually in the early 1980s was
about 123.2 million hectares (total harvested area including upland rice is 144 Mha), over
90 per cent of which was in Asia (Neue et al., 1990).14
Of the wide variety of sources of atmospheric CH4, rice paddy fields are considered one
of the most important.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 1996)
estimated the global emission rate from paddy fields at 60 Tg/yr, with a range of 20 to
100 Tg/yr.  This is about 5-20 per cent of the total emission from all anthropogenic
sources.  This figure is mainly based on field measurements of CH4 fluxes from paddy
fields in the United States, Spain, Italy, China, India, Australia, Japan and Thailand.
The measurements at various locations of the world show that there are large temporal
variations of CH4 fluxes and that the flux differs markedly with soil type and texture,
application of organic matter and mineral fertiliser (Neue and Sass, 1994).  The wide
variations in CH4 fluxes also indicate that the flux is critically dependent upon several
factors including climate, characteristics of soils and paddy, and agricultural practices,
particularly water regime.  The parameters that affect methane emissions vary widely
both spatially and temporally.  Multiple year data sets near the same location and under
similar conditions can lead to substantial differences in seasonal methane emission levels,
making it difficult to establish a single number as the methane emission level from a field,
let alone at a regional or country level.  Thus, at the current level of understanding, a
reported range in methane emission levels for a country is more realistic than a single
number.
Methane production processes
The major pathways of CH4 production in flooded soils are the reduction of CO2 with
H2, with fatty acids or alcohols as hydrogen donor, and the transmethylation of acetic acid
or methanol by methane-producing bacteria (Takai, 1970; Conrad 1989).  In paddy fields,
the kinetics of the reduction processes are strongly affected by the composition and
texture of soil and its content of inorganic electron acceptors.  The period between
flooding of the soil and the onset of methanogenesis can apparently be different for the
various soils.  However, it is unclear if soil type also affects the rates of methanogenesis
and CH4 emission when steady state conditions have been reached (Conrad, 1989).
                                                  
     14 The term "harvested area" has a different meaning from "cultivated area" in that the
former accounts for double and triple cropping.  For example, if a country has 10 million
hectares of land under rice cultivation, all of which are double-cropped (i.e., two crops of
rice are grown on each hectare each year), then this country has 20 million hectares of
rice area harvested annually.

The redox15 potential is one important factor for production of CH4 in soils.  The Eh, or
electron activity, of the soil gradually decreases after flooding.  Patrick (1981)
demonstrated that the redox potential of a soil must be below approximately -150 mV in
order to have CH4 production.  Yamane and Sato (1964) also showed that the evolution
of CH4 from flooded paddy soils did not commence until the Eh fell below -150 mV.
Carbon substrate and nutrient availability are also important factors.  Application of rice
straw to paddy fields significantly increases the CH4 emission rate compared with
application of compost prepared with rice straw or chemical fertiliser.
Soil temperature is known to be an important factor in affecting the activity of soil micro-
organisms.  This is to a certain extent related to the soil moisture content because both
the heat capacity and the heat conductivity are lower for a dry soil than for a wet soil.
Yamane and Sato (1961) have already found that CH4 formation reached a maximum at
35
oC in waterlogged alluvial soils.  The rate of methane formation was very small below
20
oC.
Because the conversion rate of substrate to CH4 depends on the temperature, it is
generally observed that the momentary local emission of CH4 from the soil to the
atmosphere depends on the temperature.  However, the dependence of the seasonally
integrated emissions of CH4 on temperature is much weaker.  That emission depends
primarily on the total input of organic substrate: although the temperature determines
the time it takes to convert the substrate to CH4, that time is generally short compared
to a season.  Thus the methodology proposed here will be based on the seasonally
integrated CH4 emission, whose temperature dependence can be neglected in first
approximation.
It is generally recognised that CH4 formation is only efficient in a narrow pH range
around neutrality (pH from 6.4 to 7.8).  The effect of flooding is to increase the pH in
acid soil, while it decreases the pH in alkaline soil.  The increase of pH in acid soils is
mainly due to the reduction of acidic Fe3+ to Fe2+ which simultaneously reduces the Eh.
The addition of nitrate as chemical fertiliser to flooded soils may suppress the production
of CH4, because nitrate acts, as well as Fe3+, Mn4+, as a terminal electron acceptor in the
absence of molecular oxygen during anaerobic respiration, and poises the redox potential
of soils at values such that the activity of strict anaerobes is prevented.  The addition of
sulphate may also inhibit methane production for similar reasons as nitrate.
There are three processes of CH4 release into the atmosphere from rice fields.  Diffusion
loss of CH4 across the water surface is the least important process.  Methane loss as
bubbles (ebullition) from paddy soils is a common and significant mechanism, especially if
the soil texture is not clayey.  During land preparation and initial growth of rice, ebullition
is the major release mechanism.  The third process is CH4 transport through rice plants,
which has been reported as the most important phenomenon (Seiler et al., 1984; Sch√ºtz
et al., 1989b).
Many researchers reported that more than 90 per cent of total CH4 emitted during the
cropping season is released by diffusive transport through the aerenchyma system of the
rice plants and not by diffusion or ebullition.  Emission through rice plant, may be
expected to show great seasonal variations as a function of changes in soil conditions and
variations in plant growth.
                                                  
     15 Redox (Eh) refers to oxidation-reduction, two processes that take place
simultaneously.  Oxidation is the loss of an electron by an atom, and reduction is the gain
of an electron by an atom.

Methane emission rates are also a function of the partial pressure of CH4 in the soil.  Part
of the CH4 produced in the soil is consumed in the oxidised rhizosphere of rice roots or
in the oxidised soil-floodwater interface.  It is known that soil methanotrophic bacteria
can grow with CH4 as their sole energy source, and other soil bacteria, such as
Nitrosomonas species are also able to consume CH4 (Conrad, 1993).  Methane is also
leached to ground water, as a small part dissolves in water.  Therefore a reduction in soil
methane does not necessarily mean that all this CH4 has been emitted into the
atmosphere.
Global emissions from rice fields
The total harvested area of rice has increased from 86 Mha in 1935 to 144 Mha in 1985,
which means an annual average increase of 1.05 per cent.  The average annual increase
was 1.23 per cent between 1959 and 1985.  However, in the last few years, the rate of
expansion of the total rice acreage has decreased (Minami, 1994).
Table 4-9 provides a summary of measured emissions at a number of specific research
sites around the world.  It should be noted that methane fluxes from paddy rice fields
vary substantially from day to day, and during a day (e.g., day and night).  The data
presented here are based on frequent measurements which capture the diurnal
variations, and variations over the growing season.  Based on area and production
statistics, with average emission values, a number of researchers have estimated global
emissions from rice.

Global emissions of CH4 from rice paddies reported by several researchers are
summarised in Table 4-10.  Extrapolation of emission rates to a global scale is very
difficult, because the effects of variations in agricultural practices, number of crops per
year, soil types and other factors discussed above are uncertain.
The IPCC (IPCC, 1996) presented a candidate list of CH4 sources to the atmosphere as
annual release rates.  The total annual source is constrained by the observed rate of
atmospheric increase of concentrations and by the estimated atmospheric lifetime to be
535 Tg CH4/yr.  Rice paddies are listed as a source of 60 ¬± 40 Tg CH4/yr.

Emissions of methane from rice fields can be represented as follows:
EQUATION 1
Fc = EF √ó A √ó 10-12
where:
Fc
=
estimated annual emission of methane from a particular
rice water regime and for a given organic amendment, in
Tg per year;
EF
=
methane emission factor integrated over integrated
cropping season, in g/m2;
A
=
annual harvested area cultivated under conditions defined
above.  It is given by the cultivated area times the number
of cropping seasons per year, i.e., in m2/yr.
The seasonally integrated emission factor is evaluated from direct field measurements of
methane fluxes for a single crop.
In practice, it will be necessary to calculate the total annual emissions from a country as a
sum of the emissions over a number of conditions.  Total rice production can be divided
into subcategories based on different biological, chemical and physical factors that control
methane emissions from rice fields.  In large countries, this may include different
geographic regions.  To account for the different conditions, F is defined as the sum of Fc
(see Equation 1).  This approach to emissions estimation can be represented as follows:
EQUATION 2
F = ‚àëi ‚àëj ‚àëk EFijk x 10-12
where:
‚Ä¢
ijk: are categories under which methane emissions from rice fields may vary.
For instance, i may represent water levels in the rice fields such as fields inundated for the
duration of the growing season (flooded regime) or fields under water only
intermittently.  This occurs either under managed irrigation when water is not readily
available or when rains do not maintain flooded conditions throughout the growing
season (intermittent regime) as given in Table 4-12.  j, k, may represent water regimes
modified by other factors like organic inputs, soil textures, fertilisation regimes under
each of the conditions represented by the index i, and so on.  As more factors are
identified, more categories need to be included.  Inclusion of additional parameters should
lead to an improvement of the estimate of the total emissions.  The summation should
include all cropping seasons.
The factors clearly identified by field experiments as being most important are (1) water
regime with inorganic fertilisers (except sulphate-containing inorganic fertilisers which
inhibit CH4 production); (2) organic fertiliser applications; (3) soil type, and soil texture;
(4) cultivar; and (5) agricultural practices such as direct seeding or transplanting.  Data

show that in continuously flooded fields, some types of organic fertilisers and certain
cultivars lead to higher emissions compared to rice grown without organic amendments
or intermittent or managed irrigation in which the fields are not continuously inundated
and only where chemical fertilisers are used.
At present there are insufficient data to incorporate most of these factors.  Nonetheless,
the estimates can be improved substantially by incorporating the current knowledge on
water regimes, organic amendments and soil types etc.  For some countries the effects of
organic fertiliser can be included.

Basic Method
Data on rice cultivation under different water management techniques should be available
from most of the important rice-producing countries.  Therefore, the basic method for
estimating emissions from each country includes estimates based on rice ecosystems
(Kush,1984; Neue, 1989) relating to water regime (Table 4-12), namely:
‚Ä¢
Upland: Fields are never flooded for a significant period of time.
‚Ä¢
Lowland: Fields are flooded for a significant period of time.
‚Ä¢ Irrigated: Water regime is fully controlled.
‚Ä¢ Continuously flooded: Fields have standing water throughout 
the rice growing season and may only dry for harvest.
‚Ä¢ Intermittently flooded : Fields have at least one aeration period of 
more than 3 days during the cropping season.
‚Ä¢  Single aeration: Fields have a single aeration during the 
cropping season at any growth stage.
‚Ä¢  Multiple aeration: Fields have more than one aeration 
period during the cropping season.
‚Ä¢ Rainfed: Water regime depends solely on precipitation.
‚Ä¢ Flood prone: The water level may rise up to 50 cm during the 
cropping season.
‚Ä¢ Drought prone: Drought periods occur during every cropping 
season.
‚Ä¢ Deep water rice: Floodwater rises to more than 50 cm for a significant 
period of time during the cropping season.
‚Ä¢ Fields inundated with water depth from 50-100 cm.
‚Ä¢ Fields inundated with water depth > 100 cm.
The discussion refers to a single inventory (or base) year, (e.g., 1990) but an average over
three years around the base year (e.g., 1989-1991) is recommended for the activity data,
if possible.

Default data
In many cases, especially at the beginning of the process, there will be important rice-
growing areas for which specific fluxes will not be available.  In such cases the regional
and country-specific default data provided in Tables 4-12 and 4-13 can be used to carry
out first order estimates.  These data may also be used by national experts for
comparison.  Several ongoing activities to improve comparable measurement data have
been identified.  See Appendix for further information.

Table 4-11 contains information on harvested area of rice according to statistics from the

irrigated, rainfed (flood prone and lowland rainfed) and upland rice for main rice-
producing countries were based on the IRRI Rice Almanac (IRRI, 1994) and for other
rice-producing countries these categories were based on IRRI (1990), Huke (1982) and
Grist (1986).  Actual percentage of the irrigated, rainfed, and flood prone areas which are
continuously flooded or have an aeration period greater than 3 days or multiple
aerations, are to be obtained from the country specific data.
Seasonally Integrated flux values
Tables 4-12 and 4-13 provides default EF values for various categories of water regimes
and multiplication factors for organic amendments.  Emissions from upland rice are
assumed to be 0 and ignored in the emission calculations.
For continuously flooded rice, a ‚Äúmodel‚Äù average seasonally integrated emissions for rice-
growing countries of the world was estimated from existing data (Table 4-13) to be
20 g/m2.  These flux values are representative of flooded rice fields where organic
fertiliser is not used.
For intermittently flooded rice, a simple correction is  applied.  Fluxes are taken to be 50
per cent of the flooded (non-organic) value of 20 g/m2 for single aeration and 20 per cent
for multiple aeration.  For other water regimes new default values are given in Table 4-2.
For irrigated and continuously flooded, lowland rice ecosystems, the default seasonally
integrated methane emission is 20 g/m2 (see Table 4-13) for soils ‚Äòwithout organic
amendments‚Äô.  For conversion to methane emissions from soils ‚Äòwith organic
amendments‚Äô, a default correction factor of 2 (Range 2-5) is applied to the corresponding
rice ecosystems for the ‚Äòwithout organic amendment‚Äô category.  This is because organic
amendments of flooded rice paddies increase methane emission to the atmosphere
(Yagi and Minami, 1990a; Sass et al., 1991a, 1991b; Neue et al., 1994).  A comprehensive

review of methane flux measurements over the past decade from a variety of countries
and with different organic amendments and inorganic fertiliser treatments, is presented by
Minami (1995).  The amount of methane that is emitted as a result of organic soil
amendments depends greatly on the amount and condition of readily available
decomposable carbon contained in the treatment.  Sch√ºtz et al (1989a) observed
increases from a control value of 28.6 g CH4 m2/yr to 68.4 g CH4 m2/yr with added rice
straw, (a factor of 2.4).  Cicerone et al. (1992) observed increases from a control value of
1.4 g CH4 m2/yr to up to 58.2 g CH4 m2/yr with added straw, a factor of over 40 times
higher.  In field studies in the Philippines, Denier van der Gon and Neue (1995) found
that fields treated with green manure applied at a rate of 22 tonnes/ha emitted over twice
as much methane as fields in which the application rate was 11 tonnes/ha.
Methane emission rates are highly sensitive to water management.  Periodic drainage of
irrigated rice paddies results in a significant decrease in methane emissions.  Yagi and
Minami (1990a) reported a decrease in methane emission rates as a result of a
mid-season drainage in Japanese rice fields.  Sass et al. (1992) found that a single
midseason drain reduced seasonal emission rates by 50 per cent (from 9.27 g/m2 to
4.86 g/m2).  In addition, multiple short periods of drainage (2-3 days) approximately every
three weeks during the growing season reduced methane emissions  to an insignificant
amount (1.15 g/m2) without decreasing rice grain yield.  Yagi et al. (1996) compared a
continuously flooded plot with constant irrigation with an intermittently drained plot with
short-term draining periods several times during the rice growing season.  Total seasonal
methane emission rates during the cultivation period were 14.8 g/m2 and 8.6 g/m2 for
1991 and 9.5 g/m2 and 5.2 g/m2 for 1993 in the continuously flooded and intermittently
drained plots, respectively.  Scaling factors in Table 4-12 have been developed using the
data from the literature.
Default values in Tables 4-12 and 4-13 can be used for initial calculation where local
measurements are not adequate.  However, national experts are encouraged to use
locally available data if available.  If this is done it is important to ensure that these
coefficients are based on a sufficient number of measurements to capture the variability
and produce a representative seasonal average value, which is needed for inventory
calculations (see Appendix).
Possible Refinements
National experts are encouraged to go beyond the basic method, and add as much detail
as can be scientifically justified, based on laboratory and field experiments on various
amendments and theoretical calculations, to arrive at the estimate of emissions from rice
cultivation in their country.  These details should be incorporated into subcategories
(indices j,k  in Equation 2) under each of the main water management categories in
Equation 2 so that they can be compared at that level with data from other countries.
For example:
Where emission data are available for different fertiliser types, this may be
incorporated into the calculations.  Each category, (e.g., continuously flooded) would
be further divided as follows:
F (continuously flooded) = F ( flooded chemical) + F (flooded/organic amendment)
This procedure would then be repeated for as many separate subcategories as have been
defined.  Each amendment may be incorporated in the same manner.

In all cases, the emission inventory must be fully documented.  The documentation has
two aspects.  First, method of calculation must be specified as in Equation 2.  Matrices of
amendments must be delineated.  Second, all data and original sources must be
referenced, if not included explicitly as part of the inventory report.  It is desirable in all
cases to rely on published information, whether from the county‚Äôs government/scientific
institutions  an international organisation such as the UN-FAO, or the scientific literature.

Intercomparability 
of 
Methane 
Emission
Data from Rice Cultivation
Chamber measurements
Each laboratory should provide a standardised emission program of control flux
measurements to ensure the intercomparibilty and intercalibration of extended data sets.
An emission standardisation programme will consist of a specified experimental plan for
seasonal and annual flux measurements along with specific accompanying data on location
and climate, soil, water management, plant characteristics, fertiliser treatment and a
detailed cropping calendar.
‚Ä¢ 
Methane flux measurements should be recorded at least twice per week over an
entire season.  Experiments should be continued during fallow and/or alternate
cropping times as well as during the entire normal local rice growing season including
land preparation.  In areas where double or triple cropping is practised, data should
be collected for all growing seasons.
‚Ä¢ 
Since emissions are strongly influenced by daily temperature changes, the diel pattern
of emission (6-12 flux rates within a 24 hour period) should be determined at least
three times during the season.
‚Ä¢ 
A data log of all agricultural events should be kept., e.g., transplant date, panicle
initiation, heading, anthesis, harvest, etc.  as well as fertilisation, water management
schedule, weeding schedule, herbicide and pesticide treatments.
‚Ä¢ 
At the time of each flux measurement, one should also collect the air temperature,
flood water temperature, and the soil temperature.
‚Ä¢ 
Fertilisation treatment in the standardisation (continuous irrigation) plots should be
according to local practices, but limited to inorganic fertiliser.  The application rate as
kg N ha-1 and number and timing of applications should be reported.
‚Ä¢ 
Fertilisation treatment in other experimental areas, including organic fertilisers,
should reflect local practices.  Amounts, type, and timing of applications should be
reported for each phase of the cropping sequence at all scales.
‚Ä¢ 
Standardisation chamber plots are to be kept flooded from shortly before
transplanting until maturity.  During flood, the water should be kept at a 5 cm
minimum constant depth.  A daily log should be kept of the amount of water added
and when.
 
Other water management regimes should be investigated when they are practised
locally.  A daily log should be kept of times and durations of draining, the amounts of
water added and other applicable data.
For further information, see ‚ÄòGlobal Measurements Standards of methane emissions for
irrigated rice cultivation‚Äô, IGAC (1994).

Greenhouse Gas Emissions from
Agricultural Burning
4 . 4 . 1  I n t r o d u c t i o n
Where there is open burning associated with agricultural practices, a number of
greenhouse gases (GHGs) are emitted from combustion.  All burning of biomass
produces substantial CO2 emissions.  However, in agricultural burning, the CO2 released
is not considered to be net emission.  The biomass burned is generally replaced by
regrowth over the subsequent year.  An equivalent amount of carbon is removed from
the atmosphere during this regrowth, to offset the total carbon released from
combustion.  Therefore the long term net emissions of CO2 are considered to be zero.
Agricultural burning releases other gases in addition to CO2 which are by-products of
incomplete combustion: methane, carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide, and oxides of
nitrogen, among others.  These non-CO2 trace gas emissions from biomass burning are
net transfers from the biosphere to the atmosphere.  It is important to estimate these
emissions in national inventories.16
There are two major types of agricultural burning addressed in this section ‚Äì savanna
burning and field burning of crop residues.  The approach is essentially the same as that
used for non-CO2 trace gases for all burning of unprocessed biomass, including traditional
biomass fuels and open burning of cleared forests.  For all these activities, there is a
common approach in the proposed methodology, in that crude estimates of non-CO2
trace gas emissions can be based on ratios to the total carbon released.  The carbon
trace gas releases (CH4 and CO) are treated as direct ratios to total carbon released.
Non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) can be treated in a similar way.
However, no default values for NMVOC are provided in this version of the Guidelines.
To handle nitrogen trace gases, nitrogen to carbon ratios are used to derive total
nitrogen released and then emissions of N2O and NOx are estimated based on ratios of
these gases to total nitrogen released.  Tables 4-15 and 4-16 provide suggested default
values for non-CO2 trace gas emission ratios.  These are presented with ranges, which
                                                  
     16 For biomass combustion, CO2 emissions are frequently not considered net
emissions, and this is the case for agricultural burning. One could argue, in such cases,
that this burning could be considered a short term sink of CO2. That is, a portion of
carbon in biomass is being released as net emissions of CH4 and CO, while regrowth is
removing the full amount of the original carbon from the atmosphere in the next cycle.
Each year plants take up a certain amount of carbon from the atmosphere. When they
are burned some of that carbon is converted to CO, and CH4, so that an amount less
than the total CO2 which was taken up by the plants is re-emitted as CO2. See Howden
et al. (1996), for a more detailed discussion of this proposal. Treating emissions of CO
and CH4 to the atmosphere, as a sink for atmospheric CO2, however, is inconsistent with
the proposed IPCC emissions methodology.  In particular, the other carbon compounds
emitted are converted back into CO2 in the atmosphere over periods of days up to a
decade or so. Thus, over the time horizons of interest for CO2, (i.e. more than 100
years) there is no sink of CO2.

emphasise their uncertainty.  However, the basic calculation methodology requires that
users select a best estimate value.17
The calculation of immediate trace gas emissions, based on the default emission ratios
provided in Tables 4-15 and 4-16, produces relatively crude estimates with substantial
uncertainties.18  Use of specific emission ratios which vary by type of burning, region, etc.
may allow for more precise calculations.  The calculations described here ignore the
contemporary fluxes associated with past burning activities.  These delayed releases are
known to exist, but are poorly understood at present.  This and other possible
refinements are discussed at the end of this section.

The term savanna refers to tropical and subtropical vegetation formations with a
predominantly continuous grass cover, occasionally interrupted by trees and shrubs
(Bouliere and Hadley 1970).  These formations exist in Africa, Latin America, Asia, and
Australia.  The growth of vegetation in savannas is controlled by alternating wet and dry
seasons: most of the growth occurs during the wet season; man-made and/or natural fires
are frequent and generally occur during the dry season.  The global area of savannas is
uncertain, in part due to lack of data and in part due to differing ecosystem classifications.
Estimates of the areal extent of savannas range from 1300-1900 million hectares world-
wide, about 60 per cent of which are humid savannas (annual rainfall of 700 mm or more)
and 40 per cent are arid savannas (annual rainfall of less than 700 mm) (Bolin et al., 1979;
Whittaker and Likens, 1975; Lanly, 1982; Lacey et al., 1982; and Hao et al., 1990).  Large-
scale burning takes place primarily in the humid savannas because the arid savannas lack
sufficient grass cover to sustain fire.  Humid savannas are burned every one to four years
on average with the highest frequency in the humid savannas of Africa (as cited in Hao et
al., 1990).
                                                  
     17 Emissions inventory developers are encouraged to provide estimates of uncertainty
along with these best estimate values where possible or to provide some expression of
the level of confidence associated with various point estimates provided in the inventory.
Procedures for reporting this uncertainty or confidence information are discussed in
Volume 1: Reporting Instructions.
     18 Emission ratios used in this section and presented in the tables are derived from
Crutzen and Andreae (1990), Delmas (1993), Delmas and Ahuja (1993) and Lacaux, et al.
(1993). They are based on measurements in a wide variety of fires, including forest and
savanna fires in the tropics and laboratory fires using grasses and agricultural wastes as
fuel. In many cases these ratios are general averages for all biomass burning. Research will
need to be conducted in the future to determine if more specific emission ratios, e.g.,
specific to the type of biomass and burning  conditions, can be obtained. Also, emission
ratios vary significantly between the flaming and smouldering phases of a fire. CO2, N2O,
and NOx are mainly emitted in the flaming stage, while CH4 and CO are mainly emitted
during the smouldering stage (Lobert et al., 1990). The relative importance of these two
stages will vary between fires in different ecosystems and under different climatic
conditions, and so the emission ratios will vary. As inventory methodologies are refined,
emission ratios should be chosen to represent as closely as possible the ecosystem type
being burned, as well as the characteristics of the fire.

Savannas are intentionally burned during the dry season primarily for agricultural
purposes such as ridding the grassland of weeds and pests, promoting nutrient cycling,
and encouraging the growth of new grasses for animal grazing.  Savanna burning may be
distinguished from other biomass burning activities like open forest clearing because there
is little net change in the ecosystem biomass in the savanna after the vegetation regrows
during the wet season.  Consequently, while savanna burning results in instantaneous
gross emissions of CO2, it is reasonable to assume that the net carbon dioxide released
to the atmosphere is essentially zero because the vegetation typically regrows between
burning cycles.19  Savanna burning does release several other important trace gases:
methane (CH4), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrous oxide (N2O), oxides of nitrogen (NOx,
i.e., NO and NO2) and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs).
Estimates of global emissions of these gases due to savanna burning have been based on
estimates of the annual instantaneous gross release of carbon from this activity and on
ratios of the other trace gases released from burning to the total carbon released by
burning.  Estimates of the annual instantaneous gross release of carbon from savanna
burning are highly uncertain because of lack of data on:
‚Ä¢
the aboveground biomass density of different savannas;
‚Ä¢
the savanna area burned annually;
‚Ä¢
the fraction of aboveground biomass which actually burns; and
‚Ä¢
the fraction which oxidises.
The methodology that is proposed in the next section, although conceptually quite simple,
takes these factors into account.  The approach allows for estimation of non-CO2 trace
gases released by savanna burning, based on default data sets and on assumptions from
average literature values for various regions and types of savannas.  It also allows for
more accurate national estimates if data and assumptions can be developed to reflect
national average conditions accurately.  Nonetheless, a wide variety of technical details
and open scientific issues remain important research topics.
Calculations
There are two basic components to the calculation.  First, it is necessary to estimate the
total amount of carbon released to the atmosphere from savanna burning.  These are not
considered to be net emissions, but are needed to derive non-CO2 trace gas emissions,
which are net emissions.  What is required is the annual area burned for the various
types of savannas, where type is based primarily upon above and below ground biomass,
and perhaps climatological conditions and nutrient status.  It is generally recommended
for all emissions from agriculture that three-year averages of activity data (e.g., hectares
burned) be used instead of a single year‚Äôs data where possible.  This is especially
important for savanna burning which is highly variable from year to year.  This variability
should also be taken into account  by national experts in planning data collection
programmes to provide more accurate inputs to national inventory calculations.  If data
are not directly available, estimates can be derived based on total savanna area20 and
                                                  
     19 If grazing pressure coupled with burning too often reduces biomass (i.e., degrades
the quality of savannas), then this needs to be considered as a carbon dioxide source. This
is not assumed in the basic calculations but could be included as a refinement if
considered important.
     20 Most countries with significant savanna area should have national statistics on the
total area, but FAO publications (e.g. FAO, 1993) also provide country-specific estimates.
