ANNEX 4 GLOSSARY FOR INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES AND 
PRODUCT USE SECTOR 
This annex provides new definitions and abbreviations for terms used in this volume on Industrial Processes and 
Product Use (IPPU) Sector (Annex 4 Volume 3 of the 2019 Refinement).  
This annex should be used in conjunction with glossary in Annex 4 of Volume 3 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines 
and general glossary of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines and the 2019 Refinement.  
 
Glossary (new) 
 
ANODE EFFECT (HIGH VOLTAGE & LOW VOLTAGE ANODE EFFECT) 
In primary aluminium and rare earth metals production (by fluoride electrolysis), an anode effect is a process 
upset condition where an insufficient amount of metal oxide (alumina in aluminium production, rare earth oxides 
in rare earth metal production) is dissolved in the electrolyte, resulting in the emission of PFC gases. This often 
causes voltage on industrial cells to be elevated above the normal operating range; however, PFC gases can also 
be generated in the absence of elevated voltage. A high voltage anode effect (HVAE) corresponds to emissions 
of PFCs gases when the cell voltage exceeds the specific voltage threshold defined for anode effects at the 
facility (e.g. >8 volts for aluminium production). A low voltage anode effect (LVAE) corresponds to emission of 
PFC gases in cases where the cell voltage doesn’t exceed the voltage threshold (e.g. <8 volts for aluminium 
production).

RARE EARTH 
Rare earth elements or rare earth metals (REM) are a group of 17 chemically similar metallic elements in the 
periodic table, i.e.: scandium (Sc), yttrium (Y) and the lanthanides – lanthanum (La), cerium (Ce), 
praseodymium (Pr), neodymium (Nd), promethium (Pm), samarium (Sm), europium (Eu), gadolinium (Gd), 
terbium (Tb), dysprosium (Dy), holmium (Ho), erbium (Er), thulium (Tm), ytterbium (Yb) and lutetium (Lu). 
‘Rare earths’ typically refers to the rare earth oxide.
