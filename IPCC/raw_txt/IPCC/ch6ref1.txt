6.1 
Overview
Disposal and treatment of industrial and municipal wastes can produce emissions of most
of the important greenhouse gases (GHG).  Solid wastes can be disposed of through
landfilling, recycling, incineration or waste-to-energy.  This chapter will deal with
emissions resulting from landfilling of solid waste, treatment of liquid wastes and waste
incineration.  Greenhouse gas emissions from waste-to-energy, where waste material is
used directly as fuel or converted into a fuel, should be calculated and reported under the
Energy Chapter.
The most important gas produced in this source category is methane (CH4).
Approximately 5-20 per cent (IPCC, 1992) of annual global anthropogenic CH4 produced
and released into the atmosphere is a by-product of the anaerobic decomposition of
waste.  Two major sources of this type of CH4 production are solid waste disposal to
land and wastewater treatment.  In each case, methanogenic bacteria break down organic
matter in the waste to produce CH4.
In previous editions of the IPCC Guidelines (1995), solid waste disposal sites were
characterised as “open dumps” or “sanitary landfills,” both of which can produce CH4 if
the waste deposited in them contains organic matter (IPCC, 1995).  Open dumps were
defined as shallow, open piles, generally only loosely compacted, and with no provision
for control of any pollutants generated, where scavenging by animals and humans can
remove much of the biodegradable wastes.  Sanitary landfills, in contrast, were defined as
sites specifically designed to receive wastes, which may manage these waste with practices
such as compacting, use of liners, daily cover, and a final cap.  Recognising that the
distinction between landfills and open dumps is not always clear, the Revised 1996 IPCC
Guidelines (this chapter) instead characterises all sites at which solid waste is deposited to
land as “solid waste disposal sites” (SWDSs).
In addition to CH4, solid waste disposal sites can also produce substantial amounts of
CO2 and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs).  Decomposition of
organic material derived from biomass sources (e.g., crops, forests) which are regrown
on an annual basis is the primary source of CO2 released from waste.  Hence, these CO2
emissions are not treated as net emissions from waste in the IPCC Methodology.  If
biomass raw materials are not being sustainably produced, the net CO2 release should be
calculated and reported under the Agriculture and Land-Use Change and Forestry
Chapters.
The process of wastewater treatment produces NMVOCs as well as CH4 (CORINAIR,
1994).  These emissions are not currently addressed in the Revised Guidelines.
Wastewater treatment is also a source of N2O, and a methodology for estimating N2O
emissions is included in this Chapter for human sewage.  (Chapter 4 of these Revised
Guidelines addresses N2O emissions from agriculture, using a life-cycle emissions
approach.)
Waste incineration, like all combustion, can produce CO2, CH4, CO, NOx, N2O and
NMVOCs.  No detailed methodologies are provided here for this source category.
Instead, the section on waste incineration later in this chapter provides references to
methods available for some of the gases.  For CH4 and N2O it is only possible to report
preliminary estimates and research results at this time.  Further studies are needed to

give more information about GHG emissions from this source category.  For additional
information, refer to the discussion of emissions from combustion in Chapter 1.
The sections in this chapter dealing with land disposal of solid waste and wastewater
treatment give background information on the source, describe a methodology to
estimate CH4 and N2O emissions, and discuss uncertainties associated with estimating
emissions.  This is consistent with the priorities under the IPCC Methodology
programme.  National experts are encouraged to report any other relevant emissions for
which data are available, along with documentation of methods used.  This will greatly
assist in the development of more complete methods for future editions of IPCC
Guidelines.  For information on estimation procedures and emissions factors for other
GHGs which are currently not provided in this chapter, experts should consult extensive
existing literature developed by other emissions inventory programmes.  Some key
examples are:
• Default Emissions Factor Handbook (CORINAIR, 1994);
• Joint Atmospheric Emission Inventory Guidebook (1st edition) (EMEP/CORINAIR,
1996);
• US EPA's Compilation of Air Pollutant Emissions Factors (AP-42) (US EPA, 1995);
• Criteria Pollutant Emission Factors for the 1985 NAPAP Emissions Inventory
(Stockton and Stelling, 1987);
• Air Emissions from Municipal Solid Waste Landfills - Background Information for
Proposed Standards and Guidelines (US EPA, 1991; Doorn and Barlaz, 1995);

Specific Data and Preliminary Emission Models (Doorn and Eklund, 1995).

The gases produced in solid waste disposal sites, particularly CH4, can be a local
environmental hazard if precautions are not taken to prevent uncontrolled emissions or
migration into surrounding land.  Landfill gas is known to be produced both in managed
“landfill” and “open dump” sites.  Both are considered here as solid waste disposal sites
(SWDSs).  Gas can migrate from SWDSs either laterally or by venting to atmosphere,
causing vegetation damage and unpleasant odours at low concentrations, while at
concentrations of 5-15 per cent in air, the gas may form explosive mixtures.
More recently, increasing attention has focused on the role of CH4 in global atmospheric
change.  Methane from SWDSs contributes a significant proportion of annual global CH4
emissions, although the estimation is subject to a great deal of uncertainty.  Estimates of
global CH4 emissions from SWDSs range from less than 20 to 70 Tg/yr (Bingemer and
Crutzen, 1987, US EPA, 1994), or about 5 per cent to 20 per cent of the total estimated
emissions of 375 Tg/yr (IPCC, 1996) from anthropogenic sources globally.
This section will describe the processes that result in gas generation from SWDSs and
the factors which affect the amount of CH4 produced.  It will then describe two
methodologies for estimating CH4 emissions from SWDSs.  One of these methods is a
default base method which all countries can use to estimate CH4 emissions from different

types of SWDSs.  It is recommended that countries which have adequate data also
estimate their emissions using the second method presented.  Finally, this section
discusses sources of uncertainty associated with any estimates of CH4 emissions from
SWDSs, in particular the availability and quality of data required.

Organic waste in SWDSs is broken down by bacterial action in a series of stages that
result in the formation of CH4 and CO2 (termed biogas or landfill gas) and further
bacterial biomass.  In the initial phase of degradation, organic matter is broken down to
small soluble molecules including a variety of sugars.  These are broken down further to
hydrogen, CO2, and a range of carboxylic acids.  These acids are then converted to acetic
acid which, together with hydrogen and CO2, forms the major substrate for growth of
methanogenic bacteria.
Landfill gas consists of approximately 50 per cent CO2 and 50 per cent CH4 by volume.
However, the percentage of CO2 in landfill gas may be smaller because of decomposition
of substrates with a high hydrogen/oxygen ratio (e.g., fats, hemicellulose) and because
some of the CO2 dissolves in water within the site.
SWDSs are by nature heterogeneous.  Microbiological investigations into site
characteristics have shown that there are considerable differences between different
SWDSs and even different regions within the same SWDS (Westlake, 1990).  This makes
it very difficult to extrapolate from observations on single SWDSs to predictions of global
CH4 emissions.  Nevertheless, a better understanding of the factors thought to most
significantly influence the generation of CH4 from land disposal of solid waste can reduce
the uncertainty associated with emissions estimates.

This section will provide a brief summary of the most significant factors affecting CH4
generation.
Waste disposal practices
Waste disposal practices of concern for CH4 emissions vary in the degree of control of
the placement of waste and management of the site.  In general, waste disposal on land
will result in CH4 production if the waste contains organic matter.  Managed disposal
(controlled placement of waste), in particular, tends to encourage development and
maintenance of anaerobic activity.
Waste composition
The composition of waste is one of the main factors influencing both the amount and the
extent of CH4 production within SWDSs.  Municipal solid waste (MSW) typically contains
significant quantities of degradable organic matter.  Different countries and regions are
known to have MSW with widely differing compositions.
Physical factors
Moisture content is an important physical factor influencing landfill gas production.
Moisture is essential for bacterial growth and metabolism, as well as for transport of
nutrients and bacteria within the SWDS.  The moisture content of a SWDS depends on

the initial moisture content of the waste, the extent of infiltration from surface and
groundwater sources, and the amount of water produced during the decomposition
processes.
Temperature, pH, and nutrient availability will affect the growth rate of the bacteria.
Under anaerobic conditions, landfill temperatures are generally between 25-40oC.  These
temperatures can be maintained within the SWDS regardless of the ambient surface
temperatures.  Outside of these temperatures, CH4 production is reduced.  Optimal pH
for CH4 production is around neutral (pH 7.0).  Important nutrients for efficient bacterial
growth include sulphur, phosphorus, sodium and calcium.  The significance of these
physical factors to CH4 generation can be demonstrated within controlled laboratory
conditions.

A number of methods have been used to estimate CH4 emissions from solid waste
disposal sites.  These methods vary widely, not only in the assumptions that they make,
but also in their complexity, and in the amount of data they require.  This chapter will
deal only with those methods that can be applied to whole regions or countries.  There
are some very complex models that are concerned with movement of CH4 and other
gases through individual disposal sites; however these models cannot be applied to site
populations and therefore will not be considered further here.
The methods described below include the theoretical gas yield methodology, of which the
default methodology is one variation, and a first order kinetics methodology.
Theoretical gas yield methodology
This is the simplest method for calculating CH4 emissions from SWDSs.  It is based on a
mass balance approach, and does not incorporate any time factors into the methodology.
Rather, this methodology assumes that all potential CH4 is released from waste in the
year that the waste is disposed of.  Although this is not what actually occurs, it gives a
reasonable estimate of the current year’s emissions if the amount and composition of the
waste disposed of has been relatively constant over the previous several years.  If,
however, there have been significant changes in the rate of waste disposal, this simple
method will likely not provide a good estimate of current emissions.
Default methodology
The default methodology is a mass balance approach that involves estimating the
degradable organic carbon (DOC) content of the solid waste, i.e., the organic carbon that
is accessible to biochemical decomposition, and using this estimate to calculate the
amount of CH4 that can be generated by the waste.  This is the approach taken by
Bingemer and Crutzen (1987), who divided the world into four economic regions (the
United States, Canada and Australia; other OECD countries; the Former USSR and
Eastern and Central Europe; developing countries), and applied different DOC values to
the waste generated within each of these regions.  It is the most widely accessible, easy-
to-apply methodology for calculating country-specific emissions of CH4 from SWDSs.  It
requires the least amount of data to perform the calculations, and it can be modified and
refined as the amount of data available for each country increases.  This approach was
provided as the default methodology in the IPCC Guidelines (IPCC, 1995).
The revised default methodology provided here modifies the IPCC Guidelines (IPCC, 1995)
in three important ways:

• Rather than distinguishing between “landfills” and “open dumps,” the methodology
uses a continuum of solid waste disposal sites, characterised by the degree of waste
management and depth.
• Default DOC values are provided for different waste streams so that countries can
calculate the DOC content of their waste rather than relying on single default values.
• Emphasising the fact that this methodology estimates CH4 generation rather than
emission, and that oxidation often occurs in the upper layers of the waste mass and in
site cover material, a CH4 oxidation factor (OX) is included in the equation (currently
equal to 0, pending the availability of further data).
The determination of annual CH4 emissions for each country or region can be calculated
from Equation 1:
EQUATION 1
Methane emissions (Gg/yr)
=
(MSWT x MSWF x MCF x DOC x DOCF x F x 16/12 - R) x (1-OX)
where:
MSWT
=
total MSW generated (Gg/yr)
MSWF
=
fraction of MSW disposed to solid waste disposal sites
MCF
=
methane correction factor (fraction)
DOC
=
degradable organic carbon (fraction)
DOCF
=
fraction DOC dissimilated
F
=
fraction of CH4 in landfill gas (default is 0.5)
R
=
recovered CH4 (Gg/yr)
OX
=
oxidation factor (fraction - default is 0)
Total MSW (MSWT) can be calculated from Population (thousand persons) x Annual
MSW generation rate (Gg/thousand persons/yr).  Per capita MSW generation rates are
provided for many countries and regions in Table 6-1.  The components of MSW may
vary from country to country.  These differences can play an important role in the
resulting emissions estimate, as each waste stream may have a different DOC content
and hence a different CH4 generation potential.  In general, countries should include the
following waste streams in their estimate of total MSW generated:
1. household waste;
2. yard/garden waste; and
3. commercial/market waste.
In some countries, significant quantities of organic industrial solid waste are generated.
The default values in Table 6-1 should not include industrial waste or construction and
demolition material.  If a significant quantity of organic industrial solid waste is generated

and disposed of in solid waste disposal sites, this waste should be included in the MSW
generation rates and reflected in the corresponding DOC value chosen (see below under
Degradable Organic Carbon).
In countries where no organised waste collection or disposal takes place in rural areas,
the population considered should include only the urban population.  The default values in
Table 6-1 for developing countries and countries with economies-in-transition do not
include rural area information.

The Fraction MSW Disposed to Solid Waste Disposal Sites (MSWF) and Methane
Correction Factor (MCF) reflect the way in which MSW is managed and the effect of
management practices on CH4 generation.  The methodology requires countries to
provide data or estimates of the quantity of waste that is disposed of to each of three
categories of solid waste disposal sites (Table 6-2).

1. Managed solid waste disposal sites.  These must have controlled placement of
waste (i.e., waste directed to specific deposition areas and a degree of control of
scavenging and a degree of control of fires) and will include at least one of the
following:
• cover material;
• mechanical compacting; or
• levelling of the waste.
2. Unmanaged-deep solid waste disposal sites.  All SWDSs not meeting the criteria
of managed SWDSs and which have depths of greater than or equal to 5 metres.
3. Unmanaged-shallow solid waste disposal sites.  All SWDSs not meeting the
criteria of managed SWDSs and which have depths of less than 5 metres.
A methane correction factor (MCF) is assigned to each of these categories, as shown in
Table 6-2.  The MCF reflects the lower methane-generating potential of unmanaged sites.
The classification recognises that some developing countries or countries with
economies-in-transition may have a small number of well-managed waste disposal sites,
with the majority of sites less well-managed or unmanaged, often shallow and with lower
methane-generating potential.  A default value is provided for countries where the
quantity of waste disposed to each SWDS is not known.  A country’s classification of its
waste sites into managed or unmanaged may change over a number of years as national
waste management policies are implemented.
Degradable Organic Carbon (DOC) content is based on the composition of waste, and
can be calculated from a weighted average of the carbon content of various components
of the waste stream.  Country/region default data for DOC, where available, are
presented in Table 6-1 (in general, these values are for wet waste).  It is highly
recommended, however, for countries where the composition of the fractions in the
waste stream are known, that these be combined with a knowledge of the carbon
content of these various fractions to produce a country-specific value for DOC.  It is
critical that the DOC value corresponds to the waste generation/disposal rate on which
the CH4 estimate is based.  For example, a country that includes industrial waste in its
MSW estimate should ensure that the DOC value used reflects this component of the
waste stream.
To assist countries to calculate the DOC of waste streams, a set of default DOC values
for different waste types is given in Table 6-3.  Note that these values are for wet (or
fresh) waste.

Fraction dissimilated DOC (DOCF) is the portion of DOC that is converted to landfill
gas.  To date, estimates of how much carbon may be dissimilated have relied on a
theoretical model that varies only with the temperature in the anaerobic zone of a landfill:
0.014T + 0.28, where T = temperature (Tabasaran, 1981).  If one assumes that the
temperature in the anaerobic zone of a SWDS remains constant at about 35
oC,
regardless of ambient temperature (Bingemer and Crutzen, 1987), this method yields a
figure of 0.77 dissimilated DOC.  This value is currently under review.
Recovered CH4 (R) is the amount of CH4 that is captured for flaring or use.  No default
values are provided for the quantity of CH4 recovered, as this value is country-specific.
See Section 6.2.6 below for more information.
Oxidation Factor (OX) accounts for the CH4 that is oxidised in the upper layers of the
waste mass and in cover material, where oxygen is present.  Because the default
methodology relies on an estimate of CH4 generation, it is important to recognise the
oxidation may reduce the quantity of CH4 generated that is ultimately emitted.  A number
of researchers are investigating and quantifying the effects of CH4 oxidation in waste
disposal sites.  However, as yet there is no internationally accepted factor that can be
applied to account for CH4 oxidation.  The CH4 oxidation factor in the equation has
therefore been set equal to 0, pending the availability of new data.  A better

understanding of the factors influencing CH4 oxidation, and more accurate quantification
of it, may allow for a revised oxidation factor (or default values) in future editions of the
IPCC Guidelines.  It is important that the oxidation factor be applied after subtraction of
CH4 recovered, as this CH4 is generally pulled from well below the surface of the SWDS,
before oxidation can occur.
It is proposed that the default methodology, based on the theoretical gas yield
methodology developed by Bingemer and Crutzen (1987), remain as the methodology
that can be used by all countries to calculate CH4 emissions from their SWDSs.  The
Workbook provides a detailed step-by-step version of this methodology.
Theoretical first order kinetics methodologies
More complex methods for estimating CH4 emissions from SWDSs acknowledge the fact
that CH4 is emitted over a long period of time rather than instantaneously.  A kinetic
approach therefore needs to take into account the various factors which influence the
rate and extent of CH4 generation and release from SWDSs.  A number of countries
have applied this or similar modelling approaches to their own situation (Aitchison et al.,
1996; UK, DOE, 1993; Van Amstel et al., 1993; Environment Canada, 1992).
First Order Decay Model
A first order decay model (Equation 3) can be used to model the rate of CH4 generation
over time.  This approach has been used extensively to model landfill gas generation rate
curves for individual landfills.  It can also be used to model gas generation for a set of
SWDSs to develop country emissions estimates or can be applied in a more general way
to entire regions.

Methane generation potential (Lo).  The methane generation potential depends upon the

Time since SWDS closure (c).  This is the length of time in years, not including the year

Time since initial refuse replacement (t).  This is the length of time in years since the

Countries with sufficient data on annual waste disposal to SWDSs are encouraged to
apply the derivative of the first order decay model (Equation 4), to provide a comparison
to the default methodology as well as to test the feasibility of including this approach in
future inventories guidelines.
To allow for variances in annual acceptance rates, the derivative of Equation 3 with
respect to t can be used to estimate CH4 generation from waste landfilled in a single year
(Rx).  In this equation, the variable t is replaced with T-x, which represents the number of
years the waste has been in the SWDS.  The resulting equation thus becomes:

There are two areas of uncertainty in the estimate of CH4 emissions from solid waste
disposal sites: (1) the uncertainty attributable to the method; and (2) data uncertainty.
Uncertainty attributable to the method.  As discussed previously, the default methodology
assumes that waste disposal into solid waste disposal sites is relatively constant and that
the CH4 generated by the waste is released in the same year the waste is deposited.
However, if waste disposal into solid waste disposal sites is increasing over time, then the
WASTE

default method will overestimate CH4 emissions.  For example, it can be shown that if
waste disposal into solid waste disposal sites is increasing at about 2 per cent per year
over a 20- to 30-year period, then the default method will overestimate emissions by
about 20-25 per cent.  This is the principal type of uncertainty attributable to the default
methodology itself.  The amount of waste disposed of is therefore a sensitive parameter
in this default methodology.
Data uncertainty.  This source of uncertainty is simply the uncertainty attributable to each
of the data inputs.  In the case of the default methodology, this includes the uncertainty in
the estimates for each of the factors used in Equation 1 (e.g., total MSW generated,
fraction of MSW disposed to solid waste disposal sites).  Although the uncertainty in any
single one of these factors may be relatively large, if the sources of uncertainty for one
factor are not related to the uncertainty for the other factors, then the uncertainty of the
overall CH4 emissions estimate can remain relatively low.  For example, if the values for
each of the factors used in Equation 1 are assumed to have an uncertainty of ± 10 per
cent, then the overall uncertainty in the CH4 emissions estimate will be about ± 20 per
cent.  If the uncertainty for each factor increases by ± 20 per cent, then the overall
uncertainty in the CH4 emissions estimate increases to ± 40-50 per cent.
The following key uncertainties related to the data are discussed further below:
• The quantity and composition of landfilled waste;
• The quantity of CH4 that is actually generated from the waste in the SWDS;
• The quantity of CH4 that is actually emitted to the atmosphere.
Waste quantity and composition: The quality of CH4 emissions estimates is directly
related to the quality and availability of the waste management data used to derive these
estimates.  However, an accurate knowledge of the quantity and composition of wastes
already in place may not be available.  For most countries, limitations on funds available
will prevent extensive investigations of old and smaller sites.  It is therefore more cost-
effective to concentrate efforts on improving the quality of data being collected on
existing landfilling operations, including total waste quantity as well as more detailed site-
specific data.
Quantity of methane generated: The degradable organic carbon (DOC) content of waste
is an essential component in all calculations of CH4 generated, and small variations in the
assumed values for DOC can result in large variations in the overall estimate of CH4
emissions.  Different countries have widely differing MSW compositions and therefore
DOC content.  Both the rate and the extent of degradation of the various waste
fractions need to be taken into account where data are available.  Waste management
practices also have significant effects on CH4 generation, for example the method of
landfilling and the water management practices.  Future changes in waste management
practices may change the composition of waste to SWDSs considerably, resulting in
different CH4 emissions levels.
Quantity of methane generated that is emitted to the atmosphere: The main uncertainty
influencing the quantity of CH4 emitted is the degree of oxidation that occurs as the gas
diffuses through the landfill cover material.  The presence, thickness, and other
characteristics of SWDS cover materials can play a large role in determining the quantity
of CH4 ultimately emitted from a site.

Flaring and gas recovery schemes successfully reduce CH4 emissions from SWDSs.  Any
national inventory of CH4 emissions from SWDSs must therefore take into account the
reductions achieved by these practices.
For sites recovering CH4 for energy use, the quantity of gas utilised is generally well
documented.  Estimates of the extent of flaring are more difficult to achieve with
accuracy, and generally have to be estimated from a knowledge of the state of SWDS
management within the country.  If data on gas flaring are not readily available for a
country, the following steps might be useful in development of this information:
1. Creation of an inventory of gas flares purchased in the country for use with landfill
gas, including year purchased, estimated useful life, and flow rates.
2. Use of this inventory to estimate quantity of landfill gas flared each year.

A default methodology is presented here that allows simple calculation of CH4 emissions
from SWDSs by all countries.  Countries are encouraged to use more sophisticated
methods that incorporate country-specific data, if available.  In particular, countries with
sufficient data are encouraged to apply the first order decay model presented in Section
6.2.4 above, and compare the results to the basic default approach.  If such data are not
available, countries are encouraged to collect data for future application of a first order
methodology.  The additional information required includes: i) the CH4 generation
potential of the waste; ii) the rate at which CH4 is generated from the waste each year;
iii) the year of waste input; and iv) the amount of waste disposed of to SWDSs each year.

Handling
6 . 3 . 1  I n t r o d u c t i o n
Methane production from wastewater handling (WWH) under anaerobic conditions is
estimated to range from 30 to 40 teragrams per year (Tg/yr).  This represents 8 to 11
per cent of total global anthropogenic CH4 emissions estimated at 375 Tg/yr.  Industrial
WWH sources are estimated to be the major contributor to WWH emissions,
accounting for 26 to 40 Tg/yr.  Domestic and commercial WWH is estimated to emit
approximately 2 Tg/yr (IPCC, 1995; US EPA 1994).
Wastewater can produce CH4 if it is handled anaerobically.  Anaerobic methods are used
to handle wastewater from municipal sewage and from food processing and other
industrial facilities, particularly in developing countries.  In contrast, developed countries
typically use aerobic processes for municipal wastewater treatment or anaerobic
processes in enclosed systems where CH4 is recovered and utilised.
This section provides the default methodology for estimating CH4 emissions from WWH.

Handling of wastewater and its residual solids by-product (sludge) under anaerobic
conditions results in CH4 production.  The extent of CH4 production depends primarily
on the following factors:
A)
Wastewater Characteristics
The principal factor in determining the CH4 generation potential of wastewater is the
amount of degradable organic material in the wastewater.  Common parameters used to
measure the organic component of the wastewater are the BOD (Biochemical Oxygen
Demand) and COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand).  Under the same conditions,
wastewater with higher COD (or BOD) concentrations will generally yield more CH4
than wastewater with lower COD (or BOD) concentrations.
B)
Handling Systems
Handling systems vary in the environment that they provide for CH4 production.  Systems
that provide anaerobic environments will generally produce CH4 whereas systems that
provide aerobic environments will normally produce little or no methane.
For example, the depth of a lagoon treatment system is a critical factor in CH4
production.  Shallow lagoons, less than 1 metre in depth, generally provide aerobic
conditions and little CH4 is likely to be produced.  Lagoons deeper than about 2-3 metres
will generally provide anaerobic environments and significant methane production is
expected.
C)
Temperature
With increases in temperature, the rate of CH4 production increases.  This is especially
important in uncontrolled systems and in warm climates.  CH4 production typically
requires a temperature higher than 15°C.  Fermentation and thus CH4 production is
negligible at temperatures below 15°C, at which point the lagoon serves principally as a
sedimentation tank (Gloyna, 1971).  Below 15°C significant amounts of CH4 will be
produced only in instances where sedimentation and extended sludge retention occur.
Other factors that influence CH4 generation in wastewater are retention time, degree of
wastewater treatment, and other site specific characteristics.
D)
BOD vs. COD
The BOD (Biochemical Oxygen Demand) concentration indicates only the amount of
carbon that is aerobically biodegradable.  The standard measurement for BOD is a 5-day
test1, denoted as BOD5.  The time period used in the BOD indicates whether only easily
biodegradable materials or more resistant compounds are taken into account.  COD
(Chemical Oxygen Demand) measures the total material available for oxidation (both
biodegradable and non-biodegradable).  Since the BOD is an aerobic parameter, it may be
less appropriate for determining the organic components in anaerobic environments.
Also, both the type of wastewater and the type of bacteria present in the wastewater
influence the BOD concentration of the wastewater.  Although BOD is the more
                                                  
     1 A seven day test, denoted as BOD7, is used in some countries instead of BOD5.
The conversion between BOD5 and BOD7 is dependent on the characteristics of the
wastewater.  Experts within individual countries should be consulted to obtain
appropriate conversion coefficients.

Wastewater handling systems involve processes that transfer wastewater from its source
to a disposal site.  In most developed countries, wastewater treatment systems are used
to chemically or biologically stabilise the wastewater before disposal.  In many developing
countries however, wastewater receives little or no formal treatment and is simply
handled by transporting untreated wastewater to a disposal site.
Formal wastewater treatment methods can be classified as primary, secondary, and
tertiary treatment.  In primary treatment, physical barriers remove larger solids from the
wastewater.  Remaining particulates are then allowed to settle.  Secondary treatment
consists of a combination of biological processes that promote biodegradation by micro-
organisms.  These may include aerobic and anaerobic stabilisation ponds, trickling filters,
and activated sludge processes.  Tertiary treatment processes are used to further purify
the wastewater of contaminants and pathogens.  This is achieved using one or a
combination of processes, including maturation/polishing ponds, advanced filtration,
carbon adsorption, ion exchange, and disinfection.
Sludge is produced in both the primary and secondary stages of treatment.  Sludge that is
produced in primary treatment consists of solids that are removed from the wastewater.
Sludge produced in secondary treatment is a result of biological growth in the biomass, as
well as the collection of small particles (Lexmond and Zeeman, 1995).  This sludge must
be treated further before it can be safely disposed of.  Methods of sludge treatment
include aerobic and anaerobic stabilisation (digestion), conditioning, centrifugation,
composting, and drying.  Anaerobic stabilisation will produce CH4.

Wastewater handling methods differ between developed and developing countries.  The
most common methods of wastewater handling in developed countries are aerobic
wastewater treatment plants and lagoons (Lexmond and Zeeman, 1995).  To avoid high
discharge fees, many large industrial facilities pretreat their wastewater before releasing it
into the sewage system.  There is also an increasing trend towards anaerobic treatment
systems, which can be cheaper and produce less sludge than aerobic systems.
The degree of wastewater treatment is variable in most developing countries.  Most
industrial wastewater is discharged directly into local bodies of water, and only a few
major industries have comprehensive in-plant treatment facilities.  Less than half of
municipal wastewater produced is collected in a sewage system.  Collected wastewater is
usually discharged into unmanaged lagoons or waterways; in coastal cities it is discharged
directly into the ocean.  In many cases, the domestic wastewater handling facilities are pit
                                                  
     2 Lexmond and Zeeman estimated a minimum value of the wastewater COD/BOD
ratio to be 1.70 (Lexmond and Zeeman 1995).  The COD/BOD ratio may vary
significantly depending upon the characteristics of the wastewater.  This is especially true
for industrial wastewater which may include inorganic oxidisable materials.  Some
countries report BOD7 (or other) values rather than BOD5 values.  In this case, domestic
wastewater experts should be consulted to convert the available BOD data into the
BOD5 form.

developing countries.
Wastewater streams
Wastewater originates from a variety of domestic and industrial sources.  Domestic
wastewater streams include wastewater from toilets, bathrooms, kitchens, and in some
cases, urban run-off.  Industry classifies sources of wastewater into different industrial
sectors (Lexmond and Zeeman, 1995), for example:
• Food and Beverages
• Paper and Pulp
• Textile
• Petrochemical
• Fertiliser
• Iron and Steel
• Non-Ferrous Metals
• Miscellaneous
Assessment of CH4 production potential from industrial wastewater streams is based on
the concentration of degradable organic matter in the wastewater, the volume of
wastewater, and the propensity of the industry to treat their wastewater in anaerobic
lagoons.  Using these criteria, Doorn and Eklund (1995) prioritised industrial wastewater
sources with high CH4 gas production potential.  These are characterised as follows:
• Paper and Pulp manufacture
• Slaughterhouses
• Alcohol, Beer, Starch
• Organic Chemicals
• Others (vegetable oil production, textiles, rubber, petroleum refineries, fruits and
vegetables)
Both the paper and pulp industry and the meat and poultry processing industries produce
large volumes of wastewater that contain high levels of degradable organics.  Additionally,
both industries utilise large facilities that often have their own wastewater handling
systems.  The meat and poultry processing facilities commonly employ anaerobic lagoons
to treat their wastewater, while the paper and pulp industry is known to use lagoons.
The non-animal food and beverage industries collectively produce considerable amounts
of waste water with significant BOD levels.

Methane emissions from wastewater handling should be calculated for two different
wastewater and resulting sludge types:

For each category, the method for estimating CH4 emissions from wastewater handling
requires three basic steps:

Step 1 - Determine the total amount of organic material in the wastewater
produced for each wastewater handling system.  The principal factor in
determining the CH4 generation potential of wastewater is the amount of degradable
organic material of the wastewater.  The most common parameters used to measure the
degradable organic component (DC) of the wastewater are the BOD (Biochemical
Oxygen Demand) and COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand).  Data permitting, COD is the
recommended parameter for estimating the DC of wastewater.  The DC indicator,
usually indicated in units of mass DC per unit volume (e.g., kg COD per m3 wastewater)
is multiplied by the volume of the source of wastewater (e.g., industry or domestic) to
estimate the total amount of organic wastewater produced.
Step 2 - Estimate emissions factors for each wastewater handling system in kg
CH4 per kg DC.  The emissions factors depend on the fraction of wastewater managed
by each wastewater handling method, maximum CH4 producing capacity of the
wastewater, and the characteristics of the wastewater handling process (principally, the
degree to which it is anaerobic).
Step 3 - Multiply the emissions factors for each wastewater handling system by
the total amount of organic material in the wastewater produced for each
system, and sum across the wastewater systems to estimate total CH4 emissions.
Approach for Estimating Methane Emissions from Wastewater and
Wastewater Sludge Handling
This approach is adapted from Doorn and Ecklund (1995) and Lexmond and Zeeman
(1995).
Step 1 -Total Organic Wastewater and Sludge
The greenhouse gas (GHG) generation potential of the wastewater is driven by the
organic content of the wastewater stream and the volume of wastewater.  For the
categories of wastewater types defined (domestic and industrial), the following is the
method for estimating the total organic wastewater (TOW):
Domestic
Data needed are:
1.
Degradable organic component (DC) indicator in kg DC per 1000 persons per year.
For domestic wastewater and sludge, BOD is the recommended DC indicator.
Although COD is considered a more appropriate indicator for the organic
component of the waste, BOD is the more frequently reported indicator for
domestic wastewater.  Consequently, the use of BOD estimates will result in more
precise calculations than when COD is used.  (Default BOD values are provided for
different regions in Table 6-5).
2.
Country population in thousands (developing countries may choose to estimate
wastewater and sludge handling emissions based only on the urban population of the
country if wastes produced in rural areas decompose in an aerobic environment -
see Table 6-4 for a list of anaerobic and aerobic handling methods).

Data needed are:
1.
Degradable organic component (DC) indicator in kg DC per m3 of industrial
wastewater/sludge produced per unit product.  For industrial wastewater and sludge
streams COD is the appropriate DC indicator.  Data on COD values should be
available in most countries.  It is recommended that country-specific information, if
available, be used.  Default COD values are provided for different industries by
region in Table 6-6.  (Although the default values in Table 6-6 are provided by

within each region.)

Step 2 - Emissions Factors
To calculate emissions factors for each wastewater and sludge type, a weighted average of
methane conversion factors (MCF) is calculated using estimates of wastewater managed
by each wastewater handling method.  The average MCF is then multiplied by the
maximum methane producing capacity (Bo) of the wastewater type.
• Maximum methane producing capacity (Bo): The methane producing potential, Bo, is the
maximum amount of CH4 that can be produced from a given quantity of wastewater
or sludge.  The CH4 producing potential varies by the composition of the
wastewater/sludge and its degradability.  The default (theoretical) value for Bo is 0.25
kg CH4/kg BOD for wastewater and for sludge (Lexmond et al., 1995).3
• Fraction of wastewater treated by certain handling systems (WS%): These are the fractions
of wastewater treated by a specific handling system, i.e., aerobic or anaerobic.
Country specific estimates for WS should be used where available.  Default estimates
of WS per cent for different countries are provided in Table 6-7 to 6-9.
• Fraction of sludge treated by certain handling systems (SS%): These are the fractions of
sludge treated by a specific handling system, i.e., aerobic or anaerobic.  Country-
specific estimates for SS should be used where available.
• Methane conversion factor: The amount of methane that is actually emitted depends on the
CH4 conversion factor.  The MCF defines the portion of CH4 producing potential (Bo)
that is achieved.  The MCF varies between 0.0 for a completely aerobic system to 1.0
for a completely anaerobic system.  Countries should contact wastewater experts to
                                                  
     3 Bo is expressed in units of kg CH4/kg DC, where DC is the indicator of degradable
component of the waste (either COD or BOD).  By definition, BOD is less than or equal
to COD; the maximum BOD possible is, in fact, the COD.  Therefore, when estimating
the maximum CH4 producing potential from BOD or COD, the maximum potential CH4
produced per unit of BOD is equivalent to the maximum potential CH4 produced per
unit of COD.  This value is 0.25 kg CH4/kg COD.
