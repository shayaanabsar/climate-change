Introduction
This module gives instructions for estimating the emissions of SO2 and
greenhouse gases from energy activities. It is divided into two main
categories, fuel combustion and fugitive emissions.  Within these categories
the divisions are made pragmatically using methodological criteria:
•
Fuel Combustion
Tier 1 Methods
- CO2 emissions
Reference Approach
By main source categories
- Non-CO2 from fuel combustion by source categories
Tier 2 Methods
- Emissions from aircraft
•
Fugitive
- Methane Emissions from Coal Mining and Handling
- Methane Emissions from Oil and Natural Gas Activities
- Ozone Precursors and SO2 from Oil Refining
Estimation of emissions for the activity/source categories used in the
following methodologies must be done using the definitions for these
categories given in the Reporting Instructions, Volume 1.  These definitions
have been carefully drafted to provide the maximum conformity with other
international reporting systems and to minimise the risks of double
counting.

CO 2 Emissions
The calculation of CO2 emissions from fuel combustion may be done at
three different levels referred to as Tiers 1, 2 and 3 in the IPCC Guidelines.
Tier 1 methods, described here, concentrate on estimating the emissions
from the carbon content of fuels supplied to the country as a whole (the
Reference Approach) or to the main fuel combustion activities (source
categories).  This last method has been recently developed in parallel with
its counterpart for estimating non-CO2 emissions from fuel combustion and
responds to the need for emissions figures by sector for monitoring and
abatement policy formulation.

I n t r o d u c t i o n
Carbon dioxide emissions are produced when carbon-based fuels are
burned. National emissions estimates are made based on amounts of fuels
used and the carbon content of fuels.
Fuel combustion is widely dispersed throughout most activities in national
economies and a complete record of the quantities of each fuel type
consumed in each "end use" activity is a considerable task, which some
countries have not undertaken. Fortunately, it is possible to obtain an
accurate estimate of national CO2 emissions by accounting for the carbon in
fuels supplied to the economy. The supply of fuels is simple to record and
the statistics are more likely to be available in many countries.
In accounting for fuels supplied it is important to distinguish between
primary fuels (i.e. fuels which are found in nature such as coal, crude oil,
natural gas), and secondary fuels or fuel products, such as gasoline and
lubricants, which are derived from primary fuels.
Accounting for carbon is based mainly on the supply of primary fuels and
the net quantities of secondary fuels brought into the country.
To calculate supply of fuels to the country you require the following data
for each fuel and year chosen:
•
the amounts of primary fuels produced (production of secondary fuels
is excluded)
•
the amounts of primary and secondary fuels imported
•
the amounts of primary and secondary fuels exported
•
the amounts of fuel used for international marine and aviation bunkers
•
the net increases or decreases in stocks of the fuels
For each fuel, the production (where appropriate) and imports are added
together and the exports, bunkers, and stock changes are subtracted to
calculate the apparent consumption of the fuels.
The manufacture of secondary fuels should be ignored in the main
calculation, as the carbon in these fuels has already been accounted for in
the supply of primary fuels from which they are derived. However,
information on production of some secondary fuel products is required to
adjust for carbon stored in these products.
The procedure calculates the supply of primary fuels to the economy with
adjustments for net imports (imports - exports), bunkers and stock changes
in secondary fuels. It is important to note that, in cases where exports of
secondary fuels exceed imports or stock increases exceed net imports,
negative numbers will result. This is correct, and should not give rise to
concern.

1.3
Three other important points influence the accounting methodology:
•
Stored carbon
Not all fuel supplied to an economy is burned for heat energy.  Some
is used as a raw material (or feedstock) for manufacture of products
such as plastics or in a non-energy use (e.g. bitumen for road
construction), without oxidation (emissions) of the carbon. This is
called stored carbon, and is deducted from the carbon emissions
calculation.  Estimation of the stored carbon requires data for fuel use
by activities using the fuel as raw material. These requirements are
explained later.
•
International Bunker fuels
The procedures given for calculating emissions ensure that emissions
from the use of fuels for international marine and air transport are
excluded from national emissions totals.  However, for information
purposes, the quantities and types of fuels delivered for international
marine and aviation bunkers and the emissions should be separately
reported.
•
Biomass fuels
Biomass fuels are included in the national energy and CO2 emissions
accounts for information only.  Within the energy module biomass
consumption is assumed to equal its regrowth.  Any departures from
this hypothesis are counted within the Land Use Change and Forestry
module.
D a t a  S o u r c e s
Locally available data should be used wherever possible.  Energy data for a
large number of countries are also published by the International Energy
Agency and the United Nations Statistical Division.  See Reference Manual
Chapter 1, Section 1-2.
In addition to energy data, default emissions factors and other input
assumptions are provided in the Workbook where available.  In calculating
national emissions, users of this method are free to override any of these
assumptions or recommendations if other information is preferred.
Wherever 
information 
is 
used 
other 
than 
the 
values
recommended in the Workbook, this should be noted and
documentation should be provided on the sources of the
information.
M e t h o d o l o g y
The IPCC methodology breaks the calculation of carbon dioxide emissions
from fuel combustion into 6 steps:
Step 1: Estimate Apparent Fuel Consumption in Original Units
Step 2: Convert to a Common Energy Unit
Step 3: Multiply by Emission Factors to Compute the Carbon Content
Step 4: Compute Carbon Stored

Apparent consumption is the basis for calculating the carbon supply to
the country.  To calculate apparent consumption (or total fuel supplied)
for each fuel, enter the following data for primary fuels.
• Production (Column A)
• Imports (Column B)
• Exports (Column C)
• International Bunkers (Column D)
• Stock Change (Column E)
For secondary fuels and products, the only figures to be entered are:
• Imports (Column B)
• Exports (Column C)
• International Bunkers (Column D)
• Stock Change (Column E)
These allow the overall calculation to account for all consumption.
Amounts of all fuels can be expressed in joules (J), megajoules (MJ),
gigajoules (GJ), terajoules (TJ), thousands of tonnes of oil equivalent (ktoe).
Solid or liquid fuels can be expressed as thousands of tonnes (kt) and dry
natural gas can be expressed as teracalories (Tcal) or cubic metres.
Note that the figure for production of natural gas, used in the
Worksheet 1-1, must not include quantities of gas vented, flared or re-
injected into the well.
If you report quantities of fuel expressed in energy units (terajoules, toe,
etc.), you should ensure that the quantities have been calculated using the
net calorific values (NCV) of the fuels concerned. NCV is sometimes
referred to as the lower heating value (LHV). NCVs are approximately
95 per cent of the gross calorific value (GCV) for liquid fossil, solid fossil
and biomass fuels, and 90 per cent of the GCV for natural gas. For other
fuels, you should determine if the figures have been derived using the net or
gross calorific values  and make the conversion to NCV if necessary.

When you have entered data in Columns A to E, calculate Apparent

Apparent Consumption = Production + Imports - Exports - 
International Bunkers - Stock Change
Enter the result in Column F.
Particular attention should be given to the algebraic sign of “stock
change” as it is entered in Column E.  When more fuel is added to
stock than is taken from it during the year there is a net stock build and
the quantity is entered in Column E with a plus sign.  In the converse
case (a stock draw) the quantity should be entered in Column E with a
minus sign.  When calculating Apparent Consumption using the above
formula the usual algebraic rules for combining signs should be used.

Manual provide different conversion values for Production (Column A), Imports (Column B), and
Exports (Column C). For these fuels, the user should calculate Apparent Consumption by converting
Production, Imports, Exports, and Stock Changes to TJ first.  For International Bunkers (Column D)
and Stock Change (Column E), use either a weighted average net calorific value or select a factor
appropriate to the dominant source of supply.

Enter the conversion factor used for each fuel in Column G.
Table 1-3 included here and other tables provided in the Reference
Manual show net calorific values.
2
Multiply the Apparent Consumption by the relevant Conversion
Factor (NCV or scaling factor) to give Apparent Consumption in
terajoules. Enter the result in Column H.
STOCK CHANGE DATA
An increase in stock is a positive
stock change and, since it is
subtracted, will decrease Apparent
Consumption; a stock reduction
(use of fuel from existing stocks) is a
negative value and will increase
Apparent Consumption.
NET CALORIFIC VALUES (NCV)
The calorific value of a fuel is a
measure of its value for heating
purposes.  If NCVs are available for
the fuels in your country, they
should be used. Default NCVs for
oil and coal products for many
countries are provided in the
Reference Manual (Volume 3). If
NCVs for your country are not
provided, select NCVs for a country
that uses fuels similar to those used
in your country.
NCVs 
for 
Refined 
Petroleum
Products and some other products
are shown in Workbook Table 1-3.
In all cases, you should report the
net calorific values which you have
used in Column G.  If you use values
other than those provided, please
include a note explaining the source
of the factors.

A sectoral breakdown of national CO2 emissions using the defined IPCC
source categories is needed for monitoring and abatement policy
discussions.  The IPCC Reference Approach provides a rapid estimate of
the total CO2 emissions from fuels supplied to the country but it does not
break down the emissions by sector.  The development of a Tier 1 method
giving non-CO2 emissions from fuel combustion by sector (Worksheets 1-3
and 1-4) has been extended to CO2 so that sectoral information can be
obtained simply for this gas.  However, the simplicity of CO2 estimation and
the special consideration given to CO2 emissions from biofuels means that
the methodology for CO2 differs in a number of respects from that used
for the non-CO2 gases.
The more detailed calculations used for this approach are essentially similar
in content to those used for the Reference Approach.

Units
Amounts of all fuels can be expressed in joules (J), megajoules (MJ),
gigajoules (GJ), terajoules (TJ), thousands of tonnes of oil equivalent (ktoe).
Solid or liquid fuels can be expressed as thousands of tonnes (kt) and dry
natural gas can be expressed as teracalories (Tcal) or cubic metres (m3).
Energy and Transformation Sector
Special care needs to be taken when considering the fuel use of the Energy
and Transformation sector so that double counting is avoided.
Fuel use in the Energy and Transformation Sector can be divided into three
groups:
Transformation Sector
1. Fuels transformed into secondary fuels by physical or chemical processes
not involving combustion (e.g. crude oil to petroleum products in
refineries, coal to coke and coke oven gas in coke ovens)
2. Fuels combusted to generate electricity and/or heat (excluding fuels used
for autoproduction of electricity and heat, which are reported in the
sector where they are used)
Energy Sector
3. Fuels combusted by the energy (energy extraction and transformation)
industries for heating, pumping, traction and lighting purposes (e.g.
refinery gas for heating distillation columns, use of colliery methane at
mines for heating purposes).
In this worksheet only fuel use by Groups 2 and 3 (fuels that are
combusted) are reported. However, see Step 4 for the reporting of
lubricants used by the energy industries.  For emissions resulting from fuel
use by Group 1 no worksheets are available.  They should be reported
under the source/sink category 1B: Fugitive Emissions from Fuels.  It is most
important that this distinction be appreciated.  The quantities of primary
fuels reported in Column A will understate the quantities used for Group 1
activities.  The reported quantities will cover only the combustion needs of
these industries.

For the calculation of carbon stored, fuels are distinguished into four groups.
• 
Fuels used as feedstocks, such as naphtha, natural gas, gas/diesel oil,
LPG or ethane
• 
Lubricants
• 
Bitumen and Coal Tars
• 
Fuels for which no carbon is stored
Fuels used as feedstocks, such as naphtha, natural gas,
gas/diesel oil, LPG or ethane:
This subsection on feedstocks applies only to the Industry Source Category.
Additional data are needed for this step. Use AUXILIARY WORKSHEET 1-2:
ESTIMATING CARBON STORED IN PRODUCTS.

Estimating Fuel Quantities
Estimate the amount of fuel that is used as a feedstock for non-energy
purposes and enter it in Column A of the Auxiliary Worksheet 1-2.
2
Converting to TJ
Insert the appropriate Conversion Factors in Column B.  Multiply
Feedstock Use (Column A) by the relevant Conversion Factor to give
NET CALORIFIC VALUES (NCV)
The calorific value of a fuel is a
measure of its value for heating
purposes.  If NCVs are available for
the fuels in your country, they
should be used. Default NCVs for
oil and coal products for many
countries are provided in the
Reference Manual (Volume 3). If
NCVs for your country are not
provided, select NCVs for a country
that uses fuels similar to those used
in your country.
NCVs 
for 
Refined 
Petroleum
Products and some other products
are shown in Workbook Table 1-3.
In all cases, you should report the
conversion factors which you have
used in Column B.  If you use values
other than those provided, please
include a note explaining the source
of the factors.

Lubricants:
It has been estimated that during the first use, recycling and final
disappearance of lubricants, approximately half of the production is oxidised
as CO2.

For each sector where lubricants are used, enter the Fraction of
Carbon Stored for lubricants in Column G.  If better information is
not available use 0.5 as a default value.

Bitumen and Coal Tars:
Bitumen and coal tars are usually not combusted but used in a manner that
stores almost all of the carbon. Therefore, in contrast to the IPCC
Reference Approach, bitumen and coal tars do not figure in the list of CO2
emitting fuels.  Emissions of NMVOCs from the use of bitumen for road
paving are estimated in the Industrial Processes Chapter.

Non-CO 2 from Fuel Combustion by
Source Categories
I n t r o d u c t i o n
The purpose of a Tier 1 approach is to assist countries that can not access
detailed fuel use and technology data in developing emission inventories.
Consequently, the Tier 1 approach should enable at least rough emission
estimations of CH4, N2O, NOx, CO and NMVOC using energy statistics,
and of SO2 by using additional assumptions on the sulphur content of the
fuels.
The Tier 1 methodology for non-CO2 gases estimates emissions by applying
emission factors to fuel statistics which are organised by sector. In reality,
emissions of these gases depend on the fuel type used, combustion
technology, operating conditions, control technology, and on maintenance
and age of the equipment.  However, since it is unlikely that many countries
will have this detailed data, the Tier 1 methodology ignores these
refinements.
Countries wishing to make more detailed emission estimations may use the
Tier 2 method described in Section 1.4.2 of the Reference Manual.  A third
option which may be used (Tier 3) is the CORINAIR 94 methodology which
is described in the EEA TF Emission Inventory Guidebook and is available on
CD-ROM1.
D a t a  s o u r c e s
Locally available data should be used wherever possible.  Energy data for a
large number of countries are published by the International Energy Agency
and the United Nations Statistical Division.  See Section 1.2 of the Reference
Manual. However, users of international statistics should bear in mind that
the recent changes to the definitions of the manufacturing sector and
energy transformation sector mean that the figures given within the
international compendia no longer correspond to the activities covered in
these sectors according to the IPCC and CORINAIR definitions.  See
Reference Manual Section 1.1.1.
Section 1.4.2 provides average non-CO2 emission factors for the agreed
IPCC source categories together with additional information on the range
of these factors and their use. The proposed values are based on emission
factors included in Radian Corporation (1990), US EPA (1995), the EDGAR
database2, the CORINAIR 1990 database and scientific reports from
                                                  
     1 The CD-ROM may be obtained by contacting the European
Environment Agency, Kongens Nytorv 6, 1050 Copenhagen, Denmark.
     2 EDGAR Version 2.0 was developed by TNO and RIVM and is a set of
global emission inventories of greenhouse gases and ozone-depleting
substances for all anthropogenic and most natural sources on a per country
basis and on 1° x 1° grid (Olivier et al., 1995).
In the Tier 1 method for non-CO2
gases, the fuels are aggregated into the
following main groups:
• • 
coal
• • 
natural gas
• 
oil
gasoline for transport
diesel oil for transport
other oil products
• 
biomass
wood/wood waste
charcoal
other biomass and wastes*
Note:  Refer to Section 1.2 Common Reporting
Framework in the Reporting Instructions for
details on which products are included in each of
the main groups.

industrial wastes, bagasse and agricultural
residues.

different countries.  SO2 emission factors are estimated using a formula
based on sulphur content in the fuel. The compilation of default factors for
biomass fuels in the “Other Sectors” has been based on measurement data
reported by Smith and Ramakrishna (1990), Berdowski et al. (1993), Delmas
(1993), Smith et al. (1993), Delmas et al. (1995), Veldt and Berdowski
(1995) and Brocard et al. (1996).  For aircraft, the emission factors for the
Tier 1 approach are based on the fleet average values of NOX, CO and
NMVOC of the global inventories compiled by NASA, ECAC/ANCAT,
WSL and NLR [Wuebbles et al. (1993);  Olivier (1995);  Brok (1995)].
The default emission factors are internally consistent and it is essential to
preserve this consistency when replacing the default by local values so that
total emissions of carbon (for example) do not exceed the carbon available
in the fuel.
When information is used that differs from values recommended in the
Workbook/Reference Manual, this should be noted and documentation should
be provided on the sources of the information.

Emissions from Aircraft
I n t r o d u c t i o n
Emissions from aircraft come from jet kerosene and aviation gasoline which
are used as fuel for the aircraft.  Non-CO2 emissions vary significantly with
operating mode and engine design.  Reliable estimates of non-CO2 gases
from aircraft require a detailed consideration of the characteristics of the
fleet, type and amount of fuel consumed and the Time-in-Modes (or TIM) of
specific aircraft fleet using national airports.
This Tier 2 methodology is applicable only for jet fuel used in jet engines.
Aviation gasoline is used only in very small aircraft and generally represents
less than 1 per cent of fuel consumption for aviation.
For the purposes of the emissions inventory a distinction is made between
domestic and international flights.
• Domestic aviation (1 A 3 a ii) includes all civil domestic passenger and
freight traffic inside a country.  All flight stages between two airports in
one country are considered domestic no matter the nationality of the
carrier or the subsequent destination of the aircraft.3
• International aviation (1 A 3 a i) includes all civil air traffic coming to or
leaving a country.  It is assumed that the number of out-bound flights
equals the number of in-bound flights.
• LTOs take the classification (domestic or international) of the flight stage
to which they belong.  As most flights are regarded as return flights, fuel
used during landing and take-off will be regarded as equal to a take-off
and landing.
                                                  
     3 If an aircraft goes from one airport in one country to another in the
same country and then leaves for a third airport in another country, the
first flight stage is considered a domestic trip while the second is considered
an international trip.  It is not important whether the airport is a domestic
or an international airport.  In addition, the type of activity (LTO, cruise,
domestic, international) is independent of the nationality of the carrier. This
treatment of domestic and international differs from that recommended to
States by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO,1994).  ICAO
defines as domestic all flight stages flown between domestic points by an
airline registered in that State and therefore excludes flights between
domestic points by foreign airlines.
