Executive Summary
This chapter assesses the state of physical, biological and social 
knowledge concerning the Arctic and Antarctic ocean and cryosphere, 
how they are affected by climate change, and how they will evolve 
in future. Concurrently, it assesses the local, regional and global 
consequences and impacts of individual and interacting polar system 
changes, and it assesses response options to reduce risk and build 
resilience in the polar regions. Key ﬁndings are:
The polar regions are losing ice, and their oceans are changing 
rapidly. The consequences of this polar transition extend to 
the whole planet, and are affecting people in multiple ways.
Arctic surface air temperature has likely1 increased by more 
than double the global average over the last two decades, with 
feedbacks from loss of sea ice and snow cover contributing to 
the ampliﬁed warming. For each of the ﬁve years since the IPCC 
5th Asesssment Report (AR5) (2014–2018), Arctic annual surface 
air temperature exceeded that of any year since 1900. During the 
winters (January to March) of 2016 and 2018, surface temperatures 
in the central Arctic were 6ºC above the 1981–2010 average, 
contributing to unprecedented regional sea ice absence. These trends 
and extremes provide medium evidence2 with high agreement of the 
contemporary coupled atmosphere-cryosphere system moving well 
outside the 20th century envelope. {Box 3.1; 3.2.1.1}
The Arctic and Southern Oceans are continuing to remove 
carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and to acidify (high 
conﬁdence). There is medium conﬁdence that the amount of CO 2 
drawn into the Southern Ocean from the atmosphere has experienced 
signiﬁcant decadal variations since the 1980s. Rates of calciﬁcation (by 
which marine organisms form hard skeletons and shells) declined in the 
Southern Ocean by 3.9 ± 1.3% between 1998 and 2014. In the Arctic 
Ocean, the area corrosive to organisms that form shells and skeletons 
using the mineral aragonite expanded between the 1990s and 2010, 
with instances of extreme aragonite undersaturation. {3.2.1.2.4}
Both polar oceans have continued to warm in recent years, 
with the Southern Ocean being disproportionately and 
increasingly important in global ocean heat increase (high 
conﬁdence). Over large sectors of the seasonally ice-free Arctic, 
summer upper mixed layer temperatures increased at around 0.5ºC 
per decade during 1982–2017, primarily associated with increased 
absorbed solar radiation accompanying sea ice loss, and the inﬂow 
of ocean heat from lower latitude increased since the 2000s (high 
conﬁdence). During 1970–2017, the Southern Ocean south of 30ºS 
accounted for 35–43% of the global ocean heat gain in the upper

In this Report, the following terms have been used to indicate the assessed likelihood of an outcome or a result: Virtually certain 99–100% probability, Very likely 
90–100%, Likely 66–100%, About as likely as not 33–66%, Unlikely 0–33%, Very unlikely 0–10%, and Exceptionally unlikely 0–1%. Additional terms (Extremely likely: 
95–100%, More likely than not >50–100%, and Extremely unlikely 0–5%) may also be used when appropriate. Assessed likelihood is typeset in italics, e.g., very likely (see 
Section 1.9.2 and Figure 1.4 for more details). This Report also uses the term ‘likely range’ to indicate that the assessed likelihood of an outcome lies within the 17–83% 
probability range.

In this Report, the following summary terms are used to describe the available evidence: limited, medium, or robust; and for the degree of agreement: low, medium, or high. 
A level of conﬁdence is expressed using ﬁve qualiﬁers: very low, low, medium, high, and very high, and typeset in italics, e.g., medium conﬁdence. For a given evidence and 
agreement statement, different conﬁdence levels can be assigned, but increasing levels of evidence and degrees of agreement are correlated with increasing conﬁdence 
(see Section 1.9.2 and Figure 1.4 for more details).
2000 m (high conﬁdence), despite occupying ~25% of the global 
ocean area. In recent years (2005–2017), the Southern Ocean was 
responsible for an increased proportion of the global ocean heat 
increase (45–62%) (high conﬁdence). {3.2.1.2.1}
Climate-induced changes in seasonal sea ice extent and 
thickness and ocean stratiﬁcation are altering marine primary 
production (high conﬁdence), with impacts on ecosystems 
(medium conﬁdence). Changes in the timing, duration and intensity 
of primary production have occurred in both polar oceans, with 
marked regional or local variability (high conﬁdence). In the Antarctic, 
such changes have been associated with locally-rapid environmental 
change, including retreating glaciers and sea ice change (medium 
conﬁdence). In the Arctic, changes in primary production have 
affected regional species composition, spatial distribution, and 
abundance of many marine species, impacting ecosystem structure 
(medium conﬁdence). {3.2.1; 3.2.3, 3.2.4} 
In both polar regions, climate-induced changes in ocean and 
sea ice, together with human introduction of non-native 
species, have expanded the range of temperate species and 
contracted the range of polar ﬁsh and ice-associated species 
(high conﬁdence). Commercially and ecologically important ﬁsh 
stocks like Atlantic cod, haddock and mackerel have expanded their 
spatial distributions northwards many hundreds of kilometres, and 
increased their abundance. In some Arctic areas, such expansions have 
affected the whole ﬁsh community, leading to higher competition 
and predation on smaller sized ﬁsh species, while some commercial 
ﬁsheries have beneﬁted. There has been a  southward shift in the 
distribution of Antarctic krill in the South Atlantic, the main area 
for the krill ﬁshery (medium conﬁdence). These changes are altering 
biodiversity in polar marine ecosystems (medium conﬁdence). {3.2.3; 
Box 3.4}
Arctic sea ice extent continues to decline in all months of 
the year (very high conﬁdence); the strongest reductions in 
September (very likely –12.8 ± 2.3% per decade; 1979–2018) 
are unprecedented in at least 1000 years (medium conﬁdence). 
Arctic sea ice has thinned, concurrent with a  shift to younger ice: 
since 1979, the areal proportion of thick ice at least 5 years old has 
declined by approximately 90% (very high conﬁdence). Approximately 
half the observed sea ice loss is attributable to increased atmospheric 
greenhouse gas concentrations (medium conﬁdence). Changes in Arctic 
sea ice have potential to inﬂuence mid-latitude weather on timescales 
of weeks to months (low to medium conﬁdence). {3.2.1.1; Box 3.2}
It is very likely that Antarctic sea ice cover exhibits no 
signiﬁcant trend over the period of satellite observations

(1979–2018). While the drivers of historical decadal variability are 
known with medium conﬁdence, there is currently limited evidence 
and low agreement concerning causes of the strong recent decrease 
(2016–2018), and low conﬁdence in the ability of current-generation 
climate models to reproduce and explain the observations. {3.2.1.1}
Shipping activity during the Arctic summer increased over the 
past two decades in regions for which there is information, 
concurrent with reductions in sea ice extent (high conﬁdence). 
Transit times across the Northern Sea Route have shortened due 
to lighter ice conditions, and while long-term, pan-Arctic datasets 
are incomplete, the distance travelled by ships in Arctic Canada 
nearly tripled during 1990–2015 (high conﬁdence). Greater levels 
of Arctic ship-based transportation and tourism have socioeconomic 
and political implications for global trade, northern nations, and 
economies linked to traditional shipping corridors; they will also 
exacerbate region speciﬁc risks for marine ecosystems and coastal 
communities if further action to develop and adequately implement 
regulations does not keep pace with increased shipping (high 
conﬁdence). {3.2.1.1; 3.2.4.2; 3.2.4.3; 3.4.3.3.2; 3.5.2.7}
Permafrost temperatures have increased to record high levels 
(very high conﬁdence), but there is medium evidence and low 
agreement that this warming is currently causing northern 
permafrost regions to release additional methane and 
carbon dioxide. During 2007–2016, continuous-zone permafrost 
temperatures in the Arctic and Antarctic increased by 0.39 ± 0.15ºC 
and 0.37 ± 0.10ºC respectively. Arctic and boreal permafrost region 
soils contain 1460–1600 Gt organic carbon (medium conﬁdence). 
Changes in permafrost inﬂuence global climate through emissions of 
carbon dioxide and methane released from the microbial breakdown 
of organic carbon, or the release of trapped methane. {3.4.1; 3.4.3}
Climate-related changes to Arctic hydrology, wildﬁre and 
abrupt thaw are occurring (high conﬁdence), with impacts 
on vegetation and water and food security. Snow and lake 
ice cover has declined, with June snow extent decreasing 13.4 
±  5.4% per decade (1967–2018) (high conﬁdence). Runoff into 
the Arctic Ocean increased for Eurasian and North American rivers 
by 3.3 ± 1.6% and 2.0 ± 1.8% respectively (1976–2017; medium 
conﬁdence). Area burned and frequency of ﬁres (including extreme 
ﬁres) are unprecedented over the last 10,000 years (high conﬁdence). 
There has been an overall greening of the tundra biome, but also 
browning in some regions of tundra and boreal forest, and changes 
in the abundance and distribution of animals including reindeer and 
salmon (high conﬁdence). Together, these impact access to (and food 
availability within) herding, hunting, ﬁshing, forage and gathering 
areas, affecting the livelihood, health and cultural identity of residents 
including Indigenous peoples (high conﬁdence). {3.4.1; 3.4.3; 3.5.2}
Limited knowledge, ﬁnancial resources, human capital and 
organisational capacity are constraining adaptation in many 
human sectors in the Arctic (high conﬁdence). Harvesters of 
renewable resources are adjusting timing of activities to changes 
in seasonality and less safe ice travel conditions. Municipalities

and industry are addressing infrastructure failures associated with 
ﬂooding and thawing permafrost, and coastal communities and 
cooperating agencies are in some cases planning for relocation 
(high conﬁdence). In spite of these adaptations, many groups are 
making decisions without adequate knowledge to forecast near- and 
long-term conditions, and without the funding, skills and institutional 
support to engage fully in planning processes (high conﬁdence). 
{3.5.2, 3.5.4, Cross-Chapter Box 9}
It is extremely likely that the rapid ice loss from the Greenland 
and Antarctic ice sheets during the early 21st century has 
increased into the near present day, adding to the ice sheet 
contribution to global sea level rise. From Greenland, the 2012–
2016 ice losses (–247 ± 15 Gt yr–1) were similar to those from 2002 
to 2011 (–263 ± 21 Gt yr–1) and extremely likely greater than from 
1992 to 2001 (–8 ± 82 Gt yr–1). Summer melting of the Greenland 
Ice Sheet (GIS) has increased since the 1990s (very high conﬁdence) 
to a  level unprecedented over at least the last 350 years, and 
two-to-ﬁvefold the pre-industrial level (medium conﬁdence). From 
Antarctica, the 2012–2016 losses (–199 ± 26 Gt yr–1) were extremely 
likely greater than those from 2002 to 2011 (–82 ± 27 Gt yr–1) and 
likely greater than from 1992 to 2001 (–51 ± 73 Gt yr–1). Antarctic 
ice loss is dominated by acceleration, retreat and rapid thinning 
of major West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) outlet glaciers (very high 
conﬁdence), driven by melting of ice shelves by warm ocean waters 
(high conﬁdence). The combined sea level rise contribution from both 
ice sheets for 2012–2016 was 1.2 ± 0.1 mm yr–1, a 29% increase on 
the 2002–2011 contribution and a ~700% increase on the 1992–
2001 period. {3.3.1}
Mass loss from Arctic glaciers  (–212 ±  29 Gt yr–1) during 
2006–2015 contributed to sea level rise at a  similar rate 
(0.6 ± 0.1 mm yr–1) to the GIS (high conﬁdence). Over the same 
period in Antarctic and subantarctic regions, glaciers separate from 
the ice sheets changed mass by –11 ± 108 Gt yr–1 (low conﬁdence). 
{2.2.3, 3.3.2}
There is limited evidence and high agreement that recent 
Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) mass losses could be irreversible 
over decades to millennia. Rapid mass loss due to glacier ﬂow 
acceleration in the Amundsen Sea Embayment (ASE) of West 
Antarctica and in Wilkes Land, East Antarctica, may indicate the 
beginning of Marine Ice Sheet Instability (MISI), but observational 
data are not yet sufﬁcient to determine whether these changes mark 
the beginning of irreversible retreat. {3.3.1; Cross-Chapter Box 8 in 
Chapter 3; 4.2.3.1.2}
The polar regions will be profoundly different in future 
compared with today, and the degree and nature of that 
difference will depend strongly on the rate and magnitude 
of global climatic change3. This will challenge adaptation 
responses regionally and worldwide.
It is very likely that projected Arctic warming will result in 
continued loss of sea ice and snow on land, and reductions in 
207

the mass of glaciers. Important differences in the trajectories 
of loss emerge from 2050 onwards, depending on mitigation 
measures taken (high conﬁdence). For stabilised global warming 
of 1.5ºC, an approximately 1% chance of a given September being sea 
ice free at the end of century is projected; for stabilised warming at 
a 2ºC increase, this rises to 10–35% (high conﬁdence). The potential 
for reduced (further 5–10%) but stabilised Arctic autumn and spring 
snow extent by mid-century for Representative Concentration 
Pathway (RCP)2.6 contrasts with continued loss under RCP8.5 (a 
further 15–25% reduction to end of century) (high conﬁdence). 
Projected mass reductions for polar glaciers between 2015 and 2100 
range from 16 ± 7% for RCP2.6 to 33 ± 11% for RCP8.5 (medium 
conﬁdence). {3.2.2; 3.3.2; 3.4.2, Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 2}
Both polar oceans will be increasingly affected by CO2 
uptake, causing conditions corrosive for calcium carbonate 
shell-producing organisms (high conﬁdence), with associated 
impacts on marine organisms and ecosystems (medium 
conﬁdence). It is very likely that both the Southern Ocean and the 
Arctic Ocean will experience year-round conditions of surface water 
undersaturation for mineral forms of calcium carbonate by 2100 
under RCP8.5; under RCP2.6 the extent of undersaturated waters 
are reduced markedly. Imperfect representation of local processes 
and sea ice interaction in global climate models limit the ability to 
project the response of speciﬁc polar areas and the precise timing of 
undersaturation at seasonal scales. Differences in sensitivity and the 
scope for adaptation to projected levels of ocean acidiﬁcation exist 
across a broad range of marine species groups. {3.2.1; 3.2.2.3; 3.2.3}
Future climate-induced changes in the polar oceans, sea ice, 
snow and permafrost will drive habitat and biome shifts, 
with associated changes in the ranges and abundance of 
ecologically important species (medium conﬁdence). Projected 
shifts will include further habitat contraction and changes in 
abundance for polar species, including marine mammals, birds, ﬁsh, 
and Antarctic krill (medium conﬁdence). Projected range expansion 
of subarctic marine species will increase pressure for high-Arctic 
species (medium conﬁdence), with regionally variable impacts. 
Continued loss of Arctic multi-year sea ice will affect ice-related and 
pelagic primary production (high conﬁdence), with impacts for whole 
ice-associated, seaﬂoor and open ocean ecosystems. On Arctic land, 
projections indicate a loss of globally unique biodiversity as some 
high Arctic species will be outcompeted by more temperate species 
and very limited refugia exist (medium conﬁdence). Woody shrubs 
and trees are projected to expand, covering 24–52% of the current 
tundra region by 2050. {3.2.2.1; 3.2.3; 3.2.3.1; Box 3.4; 3.4.2; 3.4.3}
The projected effects of climate-induced stressors on 
polar marine ecosystems present risks for commercial and 
subsistence ﬁsheries with implications for regional economies, 
cultures and the global supply of ﬁsh, shellﬁsh, and Antarctic 
krill (high conﬁdence). Future impacts for linked human 
systems depend on the level of mitigation and especially the 
responsiveness of precautionary management approaches 
(medium conﬁdence). Polar regions support several of the 
world’s largest commercial ﬁsheries. Speciﬁc impacts on the stocks 
and economic value in both regions will depend on future climate 
change and on the strategies employed to manage the effects on 
stocks and ecosystems (medium conﬁdence). Under high emission 
scenarios current management strategies of some high-value stocks 
may not sustain current catch levels in the future (low conﬁdence); 
this exempliﬁes the limits to the ability of existing natural resource 
management frameworks to address ecosystem change. Adaptive 
management that combines annual measures and within-season 
provisions informed by assessments of future ecosystem trends 
reduces the risks of negative climate change impacts on polar 
ﬁsheries (medium conﬁdence). {3.2.4; 3.5.2; 3.5.4}
Widespread disappearance of Arctic near-surface permafrost 
is projected to occur this century as a result of warming (very 
high conﬁdence), with important consequences for global 
climate. By 2100, near-surface permafrost area will decrease 
by  2–66% for RCP2.6 and 30–99% for RCP8.5. This is projected 
to release 10s to 100s of billions of tons (Gt C), up to as much as 
240 Gt C, of permafrost carbon as carbon dioxide and methane to 
the atmosphere with the potential to accelerate climate change. 
Methane will contribute a small proportion of these additional carbon 
emissions, on the order of 0.01–0.06 Gt CH4 yr–1, but could contribute 
40–70% of the total permafrost-affected radiative forcing because of 
its higher warming potential. There is medium evidence but with low 
agreement whether the level and timing of increased plant growth 
and replenishment of soil will compensate these permafrost carbon 
losses. {3.4.2; 3.4.3}
Projected permafrost thaw and decrease in snow will affect 
Arctic hydrology and wildﬁre, with impacts on vegetation and 
human infrastructure (medium conﬁdence). About 20% of Arctic 
land permafrost is vulnerable to abrupt permafrost thaw and ground 
subsidence, which is expected to increase small lake area by over 
50% by 2100 for RCP8.5 (medium conﬁdence). Even as the overall 
regional water cycle intensiﬁes, including increased precipitation, 
evapotranspiration, and river discharge to the Arctic Ocean, decreases 
in snow and permafrost may lead to soil drying (medium conﬁdence). 
Fire is projected to increase for the rest of this century across most 
tundra and boreal regions, while interactions between climate and 
shifting vegetation will inﬂuence future ﬁre intensity and frequency 
(medium conﬁdence). By 2050, 70% of Arctic infrastructure is located 
in regions at risk from permafrost thaw and subsidence; adaptation 
measures taken in advance could reduce costs arising from thaw and 
other climate change related impacts such as increased ﬂooding, 
precipitation, and freeze-thaw events by half (medium conﬁdence). 
{3.4.1; 3.4.2; 3.4.3; 3.5.2}
Response options exist that can ameliorate the impacts of 
polar change, build resilience and allow time for effective 
mitigation measures. Institutional barriers presently limit 
their efﬁcacy.
Responding to climate change in polar regions will be more 
effective if attention to reducing immediate risks (short-term 
adaptation) is concurrent with long-term planning that builds 
resilience to address expected and unexpected impacts (high 
conﬁdence). Emphasis on short-term adaptation to speciﬁc problems 
will ultimately not succeed in reducing the risks and vulnerabilities to

society given the scale, complexity and uncertainty of climate change. 
Moving toward a  dual focus of short- and long-term adaptation 
involves knowledge co-production, linking knowledge with decision 
making and implementing ecosystem-based stewardship, which 
involves the transformation of many existing institutions (high 
conﬁdence). {3.5.4}
Innovative tools and practices in polar resource management 
and planning show strong potential in improving society’s 
capacity to respond to climate change (high conﬁdence). 
Networks of protected areas, participatory scenario analysis, decision 
support systems, community-based ecological monitoring that 
draws on local and indigenous knowledge, and self assessments 
of community resilience contribute to strategic plans for sustaining 
biodiversity and limit risk to human livelihoods and wellbeing. Such 
practices are most effective when linked closely to the policy process. 
Experimenting, assessing, and continually reﬁning practices while 
strengthening the links with decision making has the potential to 
ready society for the expected and unexpected impacts of climate 
change (high conﬁdence). {3.5.1, 3.5.2, 3.5.4}
Institutional arrangements that provide for strong multiscale 
linkages with Arctic local communities can beneﬁt from 
including indigenous knowledge and local knowledge in the 
formulation of adaptation strategies (high conﬁdence). The 
tightly coupled relationship of northern local communities and their 
environment provide an opportunity to better understand climate 
change and its effects, support adaptation and limit unintended 
consequences. Enabling conditions for the involvement of local 
communities in climate adaptation planning include investments in 
human capital, engagement processes for knowledge co-production 
and systems of adaptive governance. {3.5.3}
The capacity of governance systems in polar regions to 
respond to climate change has strengthened recently, but 
the development of these systems is not sufﬁciently rapid or 
robust to address the challenges and risks to societies posed 
by projected changes (high conﬁdence). Human responses 
to climate change in the polar regions occur in a  fragmented 
governance landscape. Climate change, new polar interests from 
outside the regions, and an increasingly active role played by informal 
organisations are compelling stronger coordination and integration 
between different levels and sectors of governance. The governance 
landscape is currently not sufﬁciently equipped to address cascading

Introduction: Polar Regions,  
People and the Planet
This chapter provides an integrated assessment of climate change 
across the physical, biological and human dimensions of the polar 
regions, based on emerging understanding that assessing these 
dimensions in isolation is not sufﬁcient or forward-looking. This 
offers the opportunity, for the ﬁrst time in a global report, to trace 
cause and consequence of climate change from polar ocean and 
cryosphere systems to biological and social impacts, and relate 
them to responses to reduce risks and enhance adaptation options 
and resilience. To achieve this, the chapter draws on the body of 
literature and assessments pertaining to climate-induced dynamics 
and functioning of the polar regions published since the AR5, which 
has expanded considerably motivated in large part by growing 
appreciation of the importance of these regions to planetary systems 
and to the lives and livelihoods of people across the globe.
As integral parts of the Earth system, the polar regions interact with 
the rest of the world through shared ocean, atmosphere, ecological 
and social systems; notably, they are key components of the global 
climate system. This chapter therefore takes a  systems approach 
that emphasises the interactions of cryosphere and ocean changes 
and their diverse consequences and impacts to assess key issues 
of climatic change for the polar regions, the planet and its people 
(Figure 3.1).
The spatial footprints of the polar regions (Figure 3.2) include a vast 
share of the world’s ocean and cryosphere: they encompass surface 
areas equalling 20% of the global ocean and more than 90% of the 
world’s continuous and discontinuous permafrost area, 69% of the 
world’s glacier area including both of the world’s ice sheets, almost 
all of the world’s sea ice, and land areas with the most persistent 
winter snow cover.
Important differences in the physical setting of the two polar regions – 
the Arctic, an ocean surrounded by land, the Antarctic, a continent 
surrounded by an ocean – structure the nature and magnitude of 
interactions of cryosphere and ocean systems and their global 
linkages. The different physical settings have also led to the evolution 
of unique marine and terrestrial biology in each polar region and 
shape effects, impacts and adaptation of polar ecosystems.
It is important to recognise the existence of multiple and diverse 
perspectives of the polar regions, many of them overlapping. These 
multiple perspectives encompass the polar regions as a  source 
of resources, a  key part of the global climate system, a  place for 
preserving intact ecosystems, a place for international cooperation 
and, importantly, a homeland. While many of these perspectives are 
equally relevant for both polar regions, only the Arctic has a population 
for whom the region is a permanent home: approximately four million 
people reside there, of whom 10% are indigenous. By contrast, the 
Antarctic population changes seasonally between approximately 
1100 and 4400, based predominantly at research stations. When 
assessing knowledge relating to climate change in the context of 
adaptation options, limits and enhancing resilience (Cross-Chapter 
Box 2 in Chapter 1), such differences are important as they are linked 
to diverse human values, social processes, and use of resources.
Consideration of all peer-reviewed scientiﬁc knowledge is a hallmark 
of the IPCC assessment process. Indigenous knowledge and local 
knowledge are different and unique sources of knowledge that are 
increasingly recognised to contribute to observing, understanding, 
and responding to climate-induced changes (Cross-Chapter Box 
4  in Chapter  1). Considering indigenous knowledge and local 
knowledge facilitates cooperation in the development, identiﬁcation, 
and decision making processes for responding to climate change 
in communities across the Arctic, and better understanding of the 
challenges facing Indigenous peoples. This chapter incorporates 
published indigenous knowledge and local knowledge for assessing 
climate change impacts and responses.

northern continuous and discontinuous permafrost zone, the Arctic biome inclusive of glacial ice, and the parts of the boreal biome that are characterised by cryosphere 
elements, such as permafrost and persistent winter season snow cover.

Box 3.1 |  Polar Region Climate Trends
Over the last two decades, Arctic surface air temperature has increased at more than double the global average (high conﬁdence) 
(Notz and Stroeve, 2016; Richter-Menge et al., 2017). Attribution studies show the important role of anthropogenic increases in 
greenhouse gases in driving observed Arctic surface temperature increases (Fyfe et al., 2013; Najaﬁ et al., 2015), so there is high 
conﬁdence in projections of further Arctic warming (Overland et al., 2018a). Mechanisms for Arctic ampliﬁcation are still debated, 
but include: reduced summer albedo due to sea ice and snow cover loss, the increase of total water vapour content in the Arctic 
atmosphere, changes in total cloudiness in summer, additional heat generated by newly formed sea ice across more extensive open 
water areas in the autumn, northward transport of heat and moisture and the lower rate of heat loss to space from the Arctic relative 
to the subtropics (Serreze and Barry, 2011; Pithan and Mauritsen, 2014; Goosse et al., 2018; Stuecker et al., 2018) (SM3.1.1).
A number of recent events in the Arctic indicate new extremes in the Arctic climate system. Annual Arctic surface temperature for 
each of the past ﬁve years since AR5 (2014–2018; relative to a 1980–2010 base line) exceeded that of any year since 1900 (Overland 
et al., 2018b). Winter (January to March) near-surface temperature anomalies of +6ºC (relative to 1981–2010) were recorded in the 
central Arctic during both 2016 and 2018, nearly double the previous record anomalies (Overland and Wang, 2018a). These events 
were caused by a split of the tropospheric polar vortex into two cells, which facilitated the intrusion of subarctic storms (Overland and 
Wang, 2016). The resulting advection of warm air and moisture from the Paciﬁc and Atlantic Oceans into the central Arctic increased 
downward longwave radiation, delayed sea ice freeze-up, and contributed to an unprecedented absence of sea ice. Delayed freeze-up 
of sea ice in subarctic seas (Chukchi, Barents and Kara) acts as a positive feedback allowing warmer temperatures to progress further 
toward the North Pole (Kim et al., 2017). In addition to dramatic Arctic summer sea ice loss over the past 15 years, all Arctic winter 
sea ice maxima of the last 4 years were at record low levels relative to 1979–2014 (Overland, 2018). Multi-year, large magnitude 
extreme positive Arctic temperatures and sea ice minimums (Section 3.2.1.1) since AR5 provide high agreement and medium evidence 
of contemporary conditions well outside the envelope of previous experience (1900–2017) (AMAP, 2017d; Walsh et al., 2017).
In contrast to the Arctic, the Antarctic continent has seen less uniform temperature changes over the past 30–50 years, with warming 
over parts of West Antarctica and no signiﬁcant overall change over East Antarctica (Nicolas and Bromwich, 2014; Jones et al., 
2016; Turner et al., 2016), though there is low conﬁdence in these changes given the sparse in situ records and large interannual 
to interdecadal variability. This weaker ampliﬁed warming compared to the Arctic is due to deep ocean mixing and ocean heat 
uptake over the Southern Ocean (Collins et al., 2013). The Southern Annular Mode (SAM), Paciﬁc South American mode (by which 
tropical Paciﬁc convective heating signals are transmitted to high southern latitudes) and zonal-wave 3 are the dominant large-scale 
atmospheric circulation drivers of Antarctic surface climate and sea ice changes (SM3.1.3). Over recent decades the SAM has exhibited 
a positive trend during austral summer, indicating a strengthening of the surface westerly winds around Antarctica. This extended 
positive phase of the SAM is unprecedented in at least 600 years, according to palaeoclimate reconstructions (Abram et al., 2014; 
Dätwyler et al., 2017) and is associated with cooler conditions over the continent.
Consistent with AR5, it is likely that Antarctic ozone depletion has been the dominant driver of the positive trend in the SAM 
during austral summer from the late 1970s to the late 1990s (Schneider et al., 2015; Waugh et al., 2015; Karpechko et al., 2018), 
the period during which ozone depletion was increasing. There is high conﬁdence through a growing body of literature that variability 
of tropical sea surface temperatures can inﬂuence Antarctic temperature changes (Li et al., 2014; Turner et al., 2016; Clem et al., 2017; 
Smith and Polvani, 2017) and the Southern Hemisphere mid-latitude circulation (Li et al., 2015a; Raphael et al., 2016; Turney et al., 
2017; Evtushevsky et al., 2018; Yuan et al., 2018). New research suggests a stronger role of tropical sea surface temperatures in driving 
changes in the SAM since 2000 (Schneider et al., 2015; Clem et al., 2017).

Consequences and Impacts

3.2.1.1 
Sea Ice
Sea ice reﬂects a high proportion of incoming solar radiation back 
to space, provides thermal insulation between the ocean and 
atmosphere, inﬂuences thermohaline circulation, and provides
habitat for ice-associated species. Sea ice characteristics differ 
between the Arctic and Antarctic. Expansion of winter sea ice in the 
Arctic is limited by land, and ice circulates within the central Arctic 
basin, some of which survives the summer melt season to form 
multi-year ice. Arctic sea ice variability and impacts on communities 
includes indigenous knowledge and local knowledge from across the 
circumpolar Arctic (Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 1). The Antarctic 
continent is surrounded by sea ice which interacts with adjacent ice 
shelves; winter season expansion is limited by the inﬂuence of the 
Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC).

3.2.1.1.1 Extent and concentration 
The pan-Arctic loss of sea ice cover is a prominent indicator of climate 
change. Sea ice extent (the total area of the Arctic with at least 15% 
sea ice concentration) has declined since 1979 in each month of the 
year (very high conﬁdence) (Barber et al., 2017; Comiso et al., 2017b; 
Stroeve and Notz, 2018) (Figure 3.3). Changes are largest in summer 
and smallest in winter, with the strongest trends in September 
(1979–2018; summer month with the lowest sea ice cover) of 
–83,000 km2 yr–1 (–12.8% per decade ± 2.3% relative to 1981–2010 
mean), and –41,000 km2 yr–1 (–2.7% per decade ± 0.5% relative to 
1981–2010 mean) for March (1979–2019; winter month with the 
greatest sea ice cover) (Onarheim et al., 2018). Regionally, summer 
ice loss is dominated by reductions in the East Siberian Sea (explains 
22% of the September trend), and large declines in the Beaufort, 
Chukchi, Laptev and Kara seas (Onarheim et al., 2018). Winter ice loss 
is dominated by reductions within the Barents Sea, responsible for 
27% of the pan-Arctic March sea ice trends (Onarheim and Årthun, 
2017). Summer Arctic sea ice loss since 1979 is unprecedented in 
150 years based on historical reconstructions (Walsh et al., 2017) and 
more than 1000 years based on palaeoclimate evidence (Polyak et al., 
2010; Kinnard et al., 2011; Halfar et al., 2013) (medium conﬁdence).
Approximately half of the observed Arctic summer sea ice loss is 
driven by increased concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases, 
with the remainder attributed to internal climate variability (Kay 
et al., 2011; Notz and Marotzke, 2012) (medium conﬁdence). The sea 
ice albedo feedback (increased air temperature reduces sea ice cover, 
allowing more energy to be absorbed at the surface, fostering more 
melt) is a key driver of sea ice loss (Perovich and Polashenski, 2012;

Stroeve et al., 2012b; Serreze et al., 2016) and is exacerbated by the 
transition from perennial to seasonal sea ice (Haine and Martin, 
2017; see Section 3.2.1.1.2). Other drivers include increased warm, 
moist air intrusions into the Arctic during both winter (Box 3.1) and 
spring (Boisvert et al., 2016; Cullather et al., 2016; Kapsch et al., 
2016; Mortin et al., 2016; Graham et al., 2017; Hegyi and Taylor, 
2018), radiative feedbacks associated with cloudiness and humidity 
(Kapsch et al., 2013; Pithan and Mauritsen, 2014; Hegyi and Deng, 
2016; Morrison et al., 2018), and increased exchanges of sensible 
and latent heat ﬂux from the ocean to the atmosphere (Serreze et al., 
2012; Taylor et al., 2018). A lack of complete process understanding 
limits a more deﬁnitive differentiation between anthropogenic versus 
internal drivers of summer Arctic sea ice loss (Serreze et al., 2016; 
Ding et al., 2017; Meehl et al., 2018). The unabated reduction in Arctic 
summer sea ice since AR5 means contributions to additional global 
radiative forcing (Flanner et al., 2011) have continued, with estimates 
of up to an additional 6.4 ± 0.9 W/m2 of solar energy input to the 
Arctic Ocean region since 1979 (Pistone et al., 2014).
Although Arctic ice freeze-up is occurring later (Section 3.2.1.1.3), 
rapid thermodynamic ice growth occurs over thin ice areas after air 
temperatures drop below freezing in autumn. Later freeze-up also 
delays snowfall accumulation on sea ice, leading to a thinner and 
less insulating snowpack (Section  3.2.1.1.6) (Sturm and Massom, 
2016). These two negative feedbacks help to mitigate sudden and 
irreversible loss of Arctic sea ice (Armour et al., 2011).
Total Antarctic sea ice cover exhibits no signiﬁcant trend over the 
period of satellite observations (Figure  3.3; 1979–2018) (high 
conﬁdence) (Ludescher et al., 2018). A  signiﬁcant positive trend 
in mean annual ice cover between 1979 and 2015 (Comiso et al., 
2017a) has not persisted, due to three consecutive years of below 
average ice cover (2016–2018) driven by atmospheric and oceanic 
forcing (Turner et al., 2017b; Kusahara et al., 2018; Meehl et al., 
2019; Wang et al., 2019). The overall Antarctic sea ice extent trend 
is composed of near-compensating regional changes, with rapid ice 
loss in the Amundsen and Bellingshausen seas counteracted by rapid 
ice gain in the Weddell and Ross seas (Holland, 2014) (Figure 3.3). 
These regional trends are strongly seasonal in character (Holland, 
2014); only the western Ross Sea has a  trend that is statistically 
signiﬁcant in all seasons, relative to the variance during the period of 
satellite observations.
Multiple factors contribute to the regionally variable nature of 
Antarctic sea ice extent trends (Matear et al., 2015; Hobbs et al., 
2016b). Sea ice trends are closely related to meridional wind trends 
(high conﬁdence) (Holland and Kwok, 2012; Haumann et al., 2014): 
poleward wind trends in the Bellingshausen Sea push sea ice closer 
to the coast (Holland and Kwok, 2012) and advect warm air to the 
sea ice zone (Kusahara et al., 2017), and the reverse is true over 
much of the Ross Sea. These meridional wind trends are linked to 
Paciﬁc variability (Coggins and McDonald, 2015; Meehl et al., 2016; 
Purich et al., 2016b). Ozone depletion may also affect meridional 
winds (Fogt and Zbacnik, 2014; England et al., 2016), but there is 
low conﬁdence that this explains observed sea ice trends (Landrum 
et al., 2017).
Coupled climate models indicate that anthropogenic warming at 
the surface is delayed by the Southern Ocean circulation, which 
transports heat downwards into the deep ocean (Armour et al., 2016). 
This overturning circulation (Cross-Chapter Box 7  in Chapter  3), 
along with differing cloud and lapse rate feedbacks (Goosse et al., 
2018), may explain the weak response of Antarctic sea ice cover to 
increased atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations compared 
to the Arctic (medium conﬁdence). Because Antarctic sea ice extent 
has remained below climatological values since 2016, there is still 
potential for longer-term changes to emerge in the Antarctic (Meehl 
et al., 2019), similar to the Arctic.
Historical surface observations (Murphy et al., 2014), reconstructions 
(Abram et al., 2013b), ship records (de la Mare, 2009; Edinburgh 
and Day, 2016), early satellite images (Gallaher et al., 2014), and 
model simulations (Gagné et al., 2015) indicate a decrease in overall 
Antarctic sea ice cover since the early 1960s which is too modest 
to be separated from natural variability (Hobbs et al., 2016a) 
(high conﬁdence).
3.2.1.1.2 Age and thickness
The proportion of Arctic sea ice at least 5 years old declined from 
30% to 2% between 1979 and 2018; over the same period ﬁrst-year 
sea ice proportionally increased from approximately 40% to 60–70% 
(Stroeve and Notz, 2018) (very high conﬁdence) (Sections 3.2.1.1.3 
and 3.2.1.1.4). Arctic sea ice has thinned through volume reductions 
in satellite altimeter retrievals (Laxon et al., 2013; Kwok, 2018), 
ocean–sea ice reanalyses (Chevallier et al., 2017) and in situ 
measurements (Renner et al., 2014; Haas et al., 2017) (very high 
conﬁdence). Data from multiple satellite altimeter missions show 
declines in Arctic Basin ice thickness from 2000 to 2012 of –0.58 
± 0.07 m per decade (Lindsay and Schweiger, 2015). Integration of 
data from submarines, moorings, and earlier satellite radar altimeter 
missions shows ice thickness declined across the central Arctic by 
65%, from 3.59 to 1.25 m between 1975 and 2012 (Lindsay and 
Schweiger, 2015). There is emerging evidence that this sea ice volume 
loss may be unprecedented over the past century (Schweiger et al., 
2019). New estimates of ice thickness are available for the marginal 
seas (up to a maximum thickness of ~1 metre) from low-frequency 
satellite passive microwave measurements (Kaleschke et al., 2016; 
Ricker et al., 2017) but data are only available since 2010. The 
shift to thinner seasonal sea ice contributes to further ice extent 
reductions through enhanced summer season melt via increased 
energy absorption (Nicolaus et al., 2012), and it is vulnerable to 
fragmentation from the passage of intense Arctic cyclones in summer 
and increased ocean swell conditions (Zhang et al., 2013; Thomson 
and Rogers, 2014).
Surface observations of Antarctic sea ice thickness are extremely sparse 
(Worby et al., 2008). There are no consistent long-term observations 
from which trends in ice volume may be derived. Calibrated model 
simulations suggest that ice thickness trends closely follow those 
of ice concentration (Massonnet et al., 2013; Holland et al., 2014) 
(medium conﬁdence). Satellite altimeter datasets of Antarctic sea ice 
thickness are emerging (Paul et al., 2018) but deﬁnitive trends are 
not yet available.

3.2.1.1.3 Seasonality
There is high conﬁdence that the Arctic sea ice melt season has 
extended by 3 days per decade since 1979 due earlier melt onset, 
and 7  days per decade due to later freeze-up (Stroeve and Notz, 
2018). This longer melt season is consistent with the observed loss 
of sea ice extent and thickness (Sections 3.2.1.1.1; 3.2.1.1.2). While 
the melt onset trends are smaller, they play a large role in the earlier 
development of open water (Stroeve et al., 2012b; Serreze et al., 
2016) and melt pond development (Perovich and Polashenski, 2012) 
which enhance the sea ice albedo feedback (Stroeve et al., 2014b; Liu 
et al., 2015a). Observed reductions in the duration of seasonal sea ice 
cover are reﬂected in community-based observations of decreased 
length of time in which activities can safely take place on sea ice 
(Laidler et al., 2010; Eisner et al., 2013; Fall et al., 2013; Ignatowski 
and Rosales, 2013).
Changes in the duration of Antarctic sea ice cover over 1979–2011 
largely followed the spatial pattern of sea ice extent trends with 
reduced ice cover duration in the Amundsen/Bellingshausen Sea 
region in summer and autumn owing to earlier retreat and later 
advance, and increases in the Ross Sea due to later ice retreat and 
earlier advance (Stammerjohn et al., 2012).

pattern drive the Beaufort Gyre (Dewey et al., 2018; Meneghello 
et al., 2018) and the Transpolar Drift Stream (Vihma et al., 2012), 
which retains sea ice within the central Arctic Basin, and exports sea 
ice out of the Fram Strait, respectively. There is high conﬁdence that 
sea ice drift speeds have increased since 1979, both within the Arctic 
Basin and through Fram Strait (Rampal et al., 2009; Krumpen et al., 
2019), attributed to thinner ice (Spreen et al., 2011) and changes 
in wind forcing (Olason and Notz, 2014). Fram Strait sea ice area 
export estimates range between 600,000 to 1  million km2 of ice 
annually, which represents approximately 10% of the ice within the 
Arctic Basin (medium conﬁdence) (Kwok et al., 2013; Krumpen et al., 
2016; Smedsrud et al., 2017; Zamani et al., 2019). Sea ice volume 
ﬂux estimates through Fram Strait are now available from satellite 
altimeter datasets (Ricker et al., 2018), but they cover too short a time 
period for robust trend analysis. Observations of extreme Arctic sea 
ice deformation is attributed to the combination of decreased ice 
thickness and increased ice motion (Itkin et al., 2017).
Satellite estimates of sea ice drift velocity show signiﬁcant trends in 
Antarctic ice drift (Holland and Kwok, 2012). Increased northward drift 
in the Ross Sea and decreased northward drift in the Bellingshausen 
and Weddell seas agree with the respective ice extent gains and 
losses in these regions, but there is only medium conﬁdence in these 
trends due to a small number of ice drift data products derived from 
temporally inconsistent satellite records (Haumann et al., 2016).
3.2.1.1.5 Landfast ice
Immobile sea ice anchored to land or ice shelves is referred to as 
‘landfast’. The few long term surface (auger hole) records of Arctic 
landfast sea ice thickness all exhibit thinning trends in springtime 
maximum sea ice thickness since the mid-1960s (high conﬁdence): 
declines of 11 cm per decade in the Barents Sea (Gerland et al., 
2008), 3.3 cm per decade along the Siberian Coast (Polyakov et al., 
2010), and 3.5 cm per decade in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago 
(Howell et al., 2016). Over a  shorter 1976–2007 period, winter 
season landfast sea ice extent from measurements across the 
Arctic signiﬁcantly decreased at a rate of 7% per decade, with the 
largest decreases in the regions of Svalbard (24% per decade) and 
the northern coast of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (20% per 
decade) (Yu et al., 2013). Svalbard and the Chukchi Sea regions 
are experiencing the largest declines in landfast sea ice duration 
(~1 week per decade) since the 1970s (Yu et al., 2013; Mahoney 
et al., 2014). While most Arctic landfast sea ice melts completely 
each summer, perennial landfast ice (also termed an ‘ice-plug’) 
occurs in Nansen Sound and the Sverdrup Channel in the Canadian 
Arctic Archipelago. These ice-plugs were in place continuously from 
the start of observations in the early 1960s, until they disappeared 
during the anomalously warm summer of 1998, and they have rarely 
re-formed since 2005 (Pope et al., 2017). The loss of this perennial sea 
ice is associated with reduced landfast ice duration in the northern 
Canadian Arctic Archipelago (Galley et al., 2012; Yu et al., 2013) and 
increased inﬂow of multi-year ice from the Arctic Ocean into the 
northern Canadian Arctic Archipelago (Howell et al., 2013).
Arctic landfast ice is important to northern residents as 
a  platform for travel, hunting, and access to offshore regions 
(Sections 3.4.3.3, 3.5.2.2). Reports of thinning, less stable, and less 
predictable landfast ice have been documented by residents of 
coastal communities in Alaska (Eisner et al., 2013; Fall et al., 2013; 
Huntington et al., 2017), the Canadian Arctic (Laidler et al., 2010), 
and Chukotka (Inuit Circumpolar Council, 2014). The impact of 
changing prevailing wind forcing on local ice conditions has been 
speciﬁcally noted (Rosales and Chapman, 2015) including impacts on 
the landfast ice edge and polynyas (Box 3.3) (Gearheard et al., 2013). 
Long-term records of Antarctic landfast ice are limited in space 
and time (Stammerjohn and Maksym, 2016), with a high degree of 
regional variability in trends (Fraser et al., 2011) (low conﬁdence).
3.2.1.1.6 Snow on ice
Snow accumulation on sea ice inhibits sea ice melt through a high 
albedo, but the insulating properties limit sea ice growth (Sturm and 
Massom, 2016) and inhibits photosynthetic light (important for in- 
and under-ice biota) from reaching the bottom of the ice (Mundy 
et al., 2007). If snow on ﬁrst-year ice is sufﬁciently thick, it can 
depress the ice below the sea level surface, which forms snow-ice 
due to surface ﬂooding. This process is widespread in the Antarctic 
(Maksym and Markus, 2008) and the Atlantic Sector of the Arctic 
(Merkouriadi et al., 2017), and may become more common across 
the Arctic (with implications for sea ice ecosystems) as the ice 
regime shifts to thinner seasonal ice (Olsen et al., 2017; Granskog 
et al., 2018) (medium conﬁdence).
Despite the importance of snow on sea ice (Webster et al., 2018), 
surface or satellite derived observations of snowfall over sea ice, and 
snow depth on sea ice are lacking (Webster et al., 2014). The primary 
216
Chapter 3

source of snow depth on Arctic sea ice are based on observations 
collected decades ago (Warren et al., 1999) the utility of which are 
impacted by the rapid loss of multi-year ice across the central Arctic 
(Stroeve and Notz, 2018), and large interannual variability in snow 
depth on sea ice (Webster et al., 2014). Airborne radar retrievals of 
snow depth on sea ice provide more recent estimates, but spatial and 
temporal sampling is highly discontinuous (Kurtz and Farrell, 2011). 
Multi-source time series provide evidence of declining snow depth 
on Arctic sea ice (Webster et al., 2014) consistent with estimates of 
higher fractions of liquid precipitation since 2000 (Boisvert et al., 
2018) but there is low conﬁdence because surface measurements 
for validation are extremely limited and suggest a high degree of 
regional variability (Haas et al., 2017; Rösel et al., 2018). 
Although there are regional estimates of snow depth on Antarctic 
sea ice from satellite (Kern and Ozsoy-Çiçek, 2016), airborne remote 
sensing (Kwok and Maksym, 2014), ﬁeld measurements (Massom 
et al., 2001) and ship-based observations (Worby et al., 2008), 
data are not sufﬁcient in time nor space to assess changes in snow 
accumulation on Antarctic sea ice.
Box 3.2 |  Potential for the Polar Cryosphere to Inﬂuence Mid-latitude Weather
Since AR5, understanding how observed changes in the Arctic can inﬂuence mid-latitude weather has emerged as a  societally 
important topic because hundreds of millions of people can potentially be impacted (Jung et al., 2015). The early to middle part 
of the Holocene coincided with substantial decreases in net precipitation that may be due to weakening jet stream winds related 
to Arctic temperatures (Routson et al., 2019). There is only low to medium conﬁdence in the current nature of Arctic/mid-latitude 
weather linkages because conclusions of recent analyses are inconsistent (National Research Council, 2014; Barnes and Polvani, 
2015; Francis, 2017). The atmosphere interacts with the ocean and cryosphere through radiation, heat, precipitation and wind, 
but a full understanding of complex interconnected physical processes is lacking. Arctic forcing on the atmosphere from loss of sea 
ice and terrestrial snow is increasing, but the potential for Arctic/mid-latitude weather linkages varies for different jet stream patterns 
(Grotjahn et al., 2016; Messori et al., 2016; Overland and Wang, 2018a). Connectivity is reduced by the inﬂuence of chaotic internal 
natural variability and other tropical and oceanic forcing. Part of the scientiﬁc disagreement is due to irregular connections in the 
Arctic to mid-latitude linkage pathways, both within and between years (Overland and Wang, 2018b).
Considerable literature exists on the potential for sea ice loss in the Barents and Kara Seas to drive cold episodes in eastern Asia (Kim 
et al., 2014; Kretschmer et al., 2016), while sea ice anomalies in the Chukchi Sea and areas west of Greenland are associated with cold 
events in eastern North America (Kug et al., 2015; Ballinger et al., 2018; Overland and Wang, 2018a). Such connections, however, are 
only episodic (Cohen et al., 2018). While there is evidence of an increase in the frequency of weak polar vortex events (Screen et al., 
2018), studies do not show increases in the number of mid-latitude cold events in observations or model projections (Ayarzaguena and 
Screen, 2016; Trenary et al., 2016). Potential Arctic/mid-latitude interactions have a more regional tropospheric pathway in November 
to December (Honda et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2016a; McKenna et al., 2018), whereas January to March has a more hemispheric 
stratospheric pathway involving migration of the polar vortex off of its usual centred location on the North Pole (Cohen et al., 2012; 
Nakamura et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2018b). Overall, changes in the stratospheric polar vortex and Northern Annual Mode are not 
separable from natural variability, and so cannot be attributed to greenhouse gas forced sea ice loss (Screen et al., 2018).
Only a few studies have focused on the potential impact of Antarctic sea ice changes on the mid-latitude circulation (Kidston et al., 
2011; Raphael et al., 2011; Bader et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2017b; England et al., 2018); these ﬁnd that any impacts on the jet stream 
are strongly dependent on the season and model examined. England et al. (2018) suggest that the response of the jet stream to future 
Antarctic sea ice loss may in fact be less seasonal than the response to Arctic sea ice loss.
3.2.1.2 
Ocean Properties
The Polar Oceans are amongst the most rapidly changing oceans of 
the world, with consequences for global-scale storage and cycling 
of heat, carbon and other climatically and ecologically important 
properties (SM3.2.1; Figure SM3.2). 
3.2.1.2.1 Temperature
Ocean temperatures and associated heat ﬂuxes have a  primary 
inﬂuence on sea ice (e.g., Carmack et al., 2015; Steele and Dickinson, 
2016). WGI AR5 (their Section  3.2.2) reported that Canada Basin 
surface waters warmed from 1993 to 2007, and observations over 
1950–2010 show the Arctic Ocean water of Atlantic origin (i.e., the 
Atlantic Water Layer) warming starting in the 1970s. Warming trends 
have continued: August trends for 1982–2017 reveal summer mixed 
layer temperatures increasing at about 0.5ºC per decade over large 
sectors of the Arctic basin that are ice-free in summer (Timmermans 
et al., 2017) (Figure  3.3). This is primarily the result of increased 
absorption of solar radiation accompanying sea ice loss (Perovich, 
2016). Between 1979 and 2011, the decrease in Arctic Ocean albedo 
corresponded to more solar energy input to the ocean (virtually 
certain) of approximately  6.4 ±  0.9 Wm–2 (Pistone et al., 2014), 
likely reducing the growth of sea ice by up to 25% in both Eurasian 
and Canadian basins (Timmermans, 2015; Ivanov et al., 2016) 
(Section 3.2.1.1).

Chapter 3

While Atlantic Water Layer temperatures appear to show less 
variability since 2008, total heat content in this layer continues to 
increase (Polyakov et al., 2017). Recent changes have been dubbed the 
‘Atlantiﬁcation’ of the Northern Barents Sea and Eurasian Basin (Arthun 
et al., 2012; Lind et al., 2018), characterised by weaker stratiﬁcation 
and enhanced Atlantic Water Layer heat ﬂuxes further northeast 
(medium conﬁdence). Polyakov et al. (2017) estimate 2–4 times larger 
heat ﬂuxes in 2014–2015 compared with 2007–2008. In the Canadian 
Basin, the maximum temperature of the Paciﬁc Water Layer increased 
by ~0.5ºC between 2009 and 2013 (Timmermans et al., 2014), with 
a doubling in integrated heat content over 1987–2017 (Timmermans 
et al., 2018). Over 2001–2014, heat transport associated with Bering 
Strait inﬂow increased by 60%, from around 10 TW in 2001 to 16 TW in 
2014, due to increases in both volume ﬂux and temperature (Woodgate 
et al., 2015; Woodgate, 2018) (low conﬁdence).
The Southern Ocean is important for the transfer of heat from the 
atmosphere to the global ocean, including heat from anthropogenic 
warming (Frölicher et al., 2015; Shi et al., 2018). The Southern 
Ocean accounted for ~75% of the global ocean uptake of excess 
heat during 1870–1995 (Figure SM3.2; Frölicher et al., 2015), of 
which ~43% resided in the Southern Ocean with the remainder 
redistributed to lower latitudes. Over 1970–2017, observations show 
that the upper 2000 m of the ocean south of 30ºS was responsible 
for 35–43% of the increase in global ocean heat content (Table 3.1). 
Both models and observations show that, relative to its size (Table 
SM3.1), the Southern Ocean is disproportionately important in the 
increase in global upper ocean heat content (high conﬁdence). 
Multi-decadal warming of the Southern Ocean has been attributed 
to anthropogenic factors, especially the role of greenhouse gases but 
also ozone depletion (Armour et al., 2016; Shi et al., 2018; Swart 
et al., 2018; Irving et al., 2019) (medium conﬁdence).
Surface warming during 1982–2016 was strongest along the northern 
ﬂank of the ACC, contrasting with cooling further south (Figure 3.3). 
Interior warming was strongest in the upper 2000  m, peaking 
around 40ºS–50ºS (Armour et al., 2016) (SM3.2.1; Figures SM3.2 and 
SM3.3). There is high conﬁdence that this pattern of change is driven 
by upper-ocean overturning circulation and mixing (Cross-Chapter 
Box 7 in Chapter 3), whereby heat uptake at the surface by newly 
upwelled waters is transmitted to the ocean interior in intermediate 
depth layers (Armour et al., 2016). Whilst temperature trends in the 
ACC itself are driven predominantly by air-sea ﬂux changes (Swart 
et al., 2018), the warming on its northern side appears strongly 
inﬂuenced by wind-forced changes in the thickness and depth of 
the mode water layer (Desbruyeres et al., 2017; Gao et al., 2018) 
(medium conﬁdence). Below the surface south of the ACC, warming 
extends close to Antarctica, intruding onto the continental shelf in 
the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Sea where temperature increases 
of  0.1ºC–0.3ºC per decade have been observed over 1983–2012 
(Schmidtko et al., 2014) (Section 3.3.1.5). This latter warming may be 
driven by changes in wind forcing (Spence et al., 2014), and exhibits 
signiﬁcant decadal variability (Jenkins et al., 2018).
After around 2005, improved upper ocean heat content estimates 
became available via Argo proﬁling ﬂoats (Section 1.8.1; Section 5.2). 
For 2005–2017, multiple datasets show that the heat gained by the 
Southern Ocean south of 30ºS was 45–62% of the global ocean heat 
gain (Table  3.1) (equivalent ﬁgures for other indicative Southern 
Ocean extents are in Table SM3.2). This accords with Roemmich et al. 
(2015), who found that during 2006–2013 the ocean south of 20ºS 
accounted for 67–98% of total heat gain in the upper 2000 m of the 
global ocean. (The smaller proportion for 2005–2017 c.f. 2006–2013 
is due to comparatively greater warming in the earlier part of the 
common period). The recent Southern Ocean heat gain is thus larger 
than its long-term trend over either the preceding several decades 
(1970–2004, 30–51%, Table SM3.3) or the full period 1970–2017 
(35–43%; Table 3.1 and above). There is high conﬁdence that the 
Southern Ocean has increased its role in global ocean heat content in 
recent years compared with the past several decades. Attribution of 
this increased role is currently lacking.
The ocean below 2000 m  globally stores ~19% of the excess 
anthropogenic heat in the Earth system, with a large fraction (6% 
of global total heat excess) located in the deep Southern Ocean 
south of 30ºS (Frölicher et al., 2015; Talley et al., 2016) (medium 
conﬁdence). The WGI AR5-quantiﬁed warming of these waters was 
recently updated (Desbruyeres et al., 2017) to an equivalent heat 
uptake of 0.07 ± 0.06 W m−2 below 2000 m since the beginning of 
the century, resulting in an extra 34 ± 14 TW south of 30ºS from 1980 
to 2012 (Purkey and Johnson, 2013). Antarctic Bottom Water volume 
is decreasing (Purkey and Johnson, 2012), resulting in a deepening 
of density surfaces and driving much of the warming on depth 
surfaces below 2000 m (Desbruyeres et al., 2017). This reduction in

bottom water volume is suggestive of a decrease in its production 
(Purkey and Johnson, 2013). In the Indian and Paciﬁc basins close 
to Antarctica, bottom water is freshening (Purkey and Johnson, 
2013; Menezes et al., 2017) consistent with the uptake of enhanced 
Antarctic ice shelf and glacial melt (Purkey and Johnson, 2013).
3.2.1.2.2 Salinity
Salinity is the dominant determinant of polar ocean density, and 
exerts major controls on stratiﬁcation, circulation and mixing. Salinity 
changes are induced by freshwater runoff to the ocean (rivers and 
land ice), net precipitation, sea ice, and advection of mid-latitude 
waters, with the potential to impact water mass formation and 
circulation (e.g., Thornalley et al., 2018; see also Section 6.7.1).
Updating WGI AR5 (their Section  3.3.3.3), recent Arctic-wide 
estimates yield a freshwater increase (relative to salinity of 34.8 on 
the Practical Salinity Scale, used throughout this chapter) of 600 
± 300 km3 yr–1 over 1992–2012, with about two-thirds concomitant 
with decreasing salinity, and the remainder with a  thickening of 
the freshwater layer (medium conﬁdence) (Rabe et al., 2014; Haine 
et al., 2015; Carmack et al., 2016). The Beaufort Gyre region has 
increased its freshwater by ~40% (6600 km3) over 2003–2017; this, 
and the Gyre’s strengthening, have been attributed to dominance of 
clockwise wind patterns over the Canadian Basin over 1997–2016 
and freshwater accumulation from sea ice-melt (Krishﬁeld et al., 2014; 
Proshutinsky et al., 2015). Freshwater decreases in the East Siberian, 
Laptev, Chukchi and Kara seas are estimated to be ~180 km3 over 
2003–2014 (Armitage et al., 2016). During the 2000s, freshwater 
content in the upper 100 m of the northern Barents Sea declined by 
about 32%, from a mean of ~2.5 m (relative to a salinity of 35) in 
1970–1999, to 1.7 m in 2010–2016 (Lind et al., 2018). An increasing 
trend of 30 ± 20 km3 yr–1 in freshwater ﬂux through Bering Strait, 
primarily due to increased volume ﬂux, was measured from 1991 
to 2015, with record maximum freshwater inﬂux in 2014 of around 
3500 km3 in that year (Woodgate, 2018). Freshwater ﬂuxes from rivers 
are also increasing (Section 3.4.1.2.2), and there have been observed 
increases in discharge of glacial ice from Greenland (Section 3.3.1.3).
Observed Southern Ocean freshening trends are consistent with WGI 
AR5; subsequent studies have increased conﬁdence in their magnitude 
and sign, and also attributed them to anthropogenic inﬂuences (Swart 
et al., 2018). Changes over 1950–2010 show persistent surface water 
freshening over the whole Southern Ocean, with subducted mode/
intermediate waters carrying trends of 0.0002–0.0008 yr–1 to below 
1500 m (Skliris et al., 2014), whilst de Lavergne et al. (2014) observe 
a  circumpolar freshening south of the ACC of  0.0011 ±  0.0004 
yr–1 in the upper 100 m since the 1960s (medium conﬁdence). This 
intensiﬁes over the Antarctic continental shelves (except along the 
Western Antarctic Peninsula), where freshening of up to 0.01 yr–1 
is observed (Schmidtko et al., 2014). Freshening may be driven by 
increases in precipitation, but while models (Pauling et al., 2016) and 
observations suggest an increase may have occurred over the last 
60 years, uncertainty is presently too high to quantify its net impact 
(Skliris et al., 2014). Recently, there has been increased recognition 
of the importance of sea ice in driving Southern Ocean salinity 
changes, with Haumann et al. (2016) demonstrating that wind driven 
sea ice export has increased by 20 ± 10% from 1982 to 2008, and 
that this may have driven freshening of 0.002 ± 0.001 yr–1 in the 
surface and intermediate waters. Separately, the central role of sea 
ice in driving water mass transformations in the Southern Ocean 
has been highlighted (Abernathey et al., 2016; Pellichero et al., 
2018; Swart et al., 2018), hence such changes have the potential to 
affect overturning circulation (Cross-Chapter Box 7  in Chapter  3). 
Freshwater input to the ocean from the Antarctic Ice Sheet also has 
the potential to affect the properties and circulation of Southern 
Ocean water masses; see Section 3.3.3.
3.2.1.2.3 Stratiﬁcation
See Supplementary Material (SM3.2.2).
3.2.1.2.4 Carbon and ocean acidiﬁcation
Various elements of marine biogeochemistry and geochemistry in the 
polar regions are of global importance. Here we focus on aspects 
relevant to carbon and ocean acidiﬁcation; others (e.g., changes in 
dissolved oxygen) are assessed in Section 5.2.2. Compiled datasets 
on observed trends in ocean acidiﬁcation from different observational 
platforms can be found in Table SM5.3.
About a quarter of carbon dioxide (CO2) released by human activities 
is taken up by the ocean (WGI AR5, their Section 3.8). This dissolves in 
surface water to form carbonic acid, which, upon dissociation, causes 
a decrease in pH (acidiﬁcation) and carbonate ion (CO32– ) concentration. 
This can affect organisms that form shells and skeletons using calcium 
carbonate (CaCO3, aragonite and calcite as dominant mineral forms). 
Since AR5, new observations have demonstrated the spatial and 
temporal variability of ocean acidiﬁcation and controlling mechanisms 
of carbon systems in different regions (Bellerby et al., 2018). 
Robbins et al. (2013) showed aragonite undersaturation for about 
20% of surface waters in the Canada and Makarov Basins, where 
substantial sea ice melt occurred. Qi et al. (2017) reported that 
aragonite undersaturation has expanded northward by at least 5º of 
latitude, and deepened by ~100 m between the 1990s and 2010 
primarily due to increased Paciﬁc Winter Water transport. In the East 
Siberian Arctic Shelf, extreme aragonite undersaturation was driven 
by the degradation of terrestrial organic matter and runoff of Arctic 
river water with elevated CO2 concentrations, reﬂecting pH changes 
in excess of those projected in this region for 2100 (Semiletov 
et al., 2016) (high conﬁdence); this was also observed along the 
continental margin and traced in the deep Makarov and Canada 
Basins (Anderson et al., 2017a). The variable buffering capacities of 
rivers ﬂowing through watersheds with different bedrock geology 
also inﬂuenced the state of ocean acidiﬁcation in coastal regions 
(Tank et al., 2012; Azetsu-Scott et al., 2014).
The dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentration increased 
in subsurface waters (150–1400  m) in the central Arctic 
between 1991 and 2011 (Ericson et al., 2014). The rate of 
increase was  0.6–0.9 μmol kg–1 yr–1 in the Arctic Atlantic Water 
and 0.4–0.6 μmol kg–1 yr–1 in the upper Polar Deep Water due to 
anthropogenic CO2, while no trend was observed in nutrient

concentrations. In waters below 2000 m, no signiﬁcant trend was 
observed for DIC and nutrient concentrations. Observation-based 
estimates (MacGilchrist et al., 2014) revealed a  net summertime 
pan-Arctic export of 231 ± 49 TgC yr–1 of DIC across the Arctic Ocean 
gateways to the North Atlantic; at least 166 ± 60 TgC yr–1 of this 
was sequestered from the atmosphere (medium conﬁdence). Similar 
to other regions (Table SM5.3), observed changes in the carbonate 
chemistry of the Arctic are indicative of ongoing ocean acidiﬁcation 
(high conﬁdence).
Studies covering seasonal-to-decadal variability in the Arctic are 
limited, with most conducted in ice-free or low ice periods during 
summer to autumn. However, it has been demonstrated that biological 
processes, respiration and photosynthesis, control the CaCO3 saturation 
states in Chukchi Sea bottom water (Yamamoto-Kawai et al., 2016). 
Sea ice formation and melt inﬂuence the dynamics of ikaite (CaCO3 
precipitation trapped in sea ice during brine rejection), and therefore 
local carbonate chemistry (Rysgaard et al., 2013; Bates et al., 2014; 
Geilfus et al., 2016; Fransson et al., 2017). Although the increase of 
pH and saturation states by biological carbon ﬁxation that consumes 
DIC in surface water is well documented (Azetsu-Scott et al., 2014; 
Yamamoto-Kawai et al., 2016) (high conﬁdence), it has been shown 
that long photoperiods in Arctic summers sustain high pH in kelp 
forests, slowing ocean acidiﬁcation (Krause-Jensen et al., 2016).
Since AR5, there are new constraints on the seasonal-to-decadal 
variability in the Southern Ocean CO2 ﬂux (McNeil and Matear, 2013; 
Landschützer et al., 2014; Landschützer et al., 2015; Gregor et al., 2017; 
Ritter et al., 2017; Keppler and Landschutzer, 2019) (Figure SM3.4), 
with mean annual ﬂux anomalies varying from 0.3 ± 0.1 Pg C yr–1 
in 2001–2002 to –0.4 Pg C yr–1 in 2012 (Landschützer et al., 2015); 
this can affect the magnitude of the global CO2 sink (Section 5.2.2). 
A  weakening CO2 sink during the 1990s (Le Quéré et al., 2007) 
reversed in the 2000s as part of a  decadal cycle (Landschützer 
et al., 2015; Munro et al., 2015; Williams et al., 2017) (SM3.2.3; 
Figure SM3.4), with a  weakening again since 2011 (Keppler and 
Landschutzer, 2019). While the weakening sink during the 1990s 
was explained as a response to changes in the circumpolar winds 
over the Southern Ocean enhancing the outgassing of natural CO2, 
the subsequent changes appear due to a combination of changes 
in regional winds, temperature and circulation (Landschützer et al., 
2015; Gregor et al., 2017; Keppler and Landschutzer, 2019). Data 
scarcity, especially in winter, remains a challenge (Ritter et al., 2017; 
Fay et al., 2018; Gruber et al., 2019b); recent data from pH-enabled 
ﬂoats highlighted the potential role for winter outgassing south of 
the Polar Front (Williams et al., 2017; Gray et al., 2018). Overall, 
there is medium conﬁdence that the Southern Ocean CO 2 sink has 
experienced signiﬁcant decadal variations since the 1980s. 
Southern Ocean carbon storage is affected by changes in overturning 
circulation (Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 3), with the storage of 
anthropogenic and natural carbon being both variable and out of 
phase on decadal timescales (DeVries et al., 2017; Tanhua et al., 
2017) (Table SM3.4). Mode and intermediate waters are strongly 
involved in changing storage, also showing high sensitivity to shifts 
in winds (Swart et al., 2014; Swart et al., 2015a; Tanhua et al., 2017; 
Gruber et al., 2019a). Zonal basin differences in the uptake and 
storage of anthropogenic carbon are not well resolved and there is 
weak agreement between reanalysis products and Coupled Model 
Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models (Swart et al., 2014). 
The presence of subduction hotspots suggest that basin-wide studies 
may be underestimating the importance of mode water subduction 
as a principal storage mechanism (Langlais et al., 2017). 
Strengthening impacts of Southern Ocean acidiﬁcation are 
illustrated by the 3.9 ± 1.3% decrease in derived calciﬁcation rates 
(1998–2014) (Freeman and Lovenduski, 2015). These have strong 
regional character, with decreases in the Indian and Paciﬁc sectors 
(7.5–11.6%) and increases in the Atlantic (14.3 ± 5.1%). There have 
also been changes in the seasonality of pCO2 linked to decreasing 
buffer capacity (McNeil and Sasse, 2016) (SM3.2.4) or adjustments 
to primary production (Conrad and Lovenduski, 2015); seasonal 
changes are discussed further in Section 5.2.2.
3.2.1.3 
Ocean Circulation
The major elements of Southern Ocean circulation are assessed 
in Cross-Chapter Box 7  in Chapter  3; Arctic Ocean circulation is 
considered here. Arctic processes, such as discharge of freshwater 
from the Greenland Ice Sheet, have the potential to impact 
on the formation of the headwaters of the Atlantic Meridional 
Overturning Circulation (Section  6.7.1), and can impact on the 
structure and function of the marine ecosystem with implications for 
commercially-harvested species (Sections 3.2.3, 3.2.4).
Satellite data indicate a  general strengthening of the surface 
geostrophic currents in the Arctic basin (Armitage et al., 2017). 
Between 2003 and 2014, the strength of some currents in the Beaufort 
Gyre approximately doubled (Armitage et al., 2017). Over 2001–2014, 
annual Bering Strait volume transport from the Paciﬁc to the Arctic 
Ocean increased from 0.7 × 106 m3s–1 to 1.2 × 106 m3s–1 (Woodgate 
et al., 2015). Mesoscale eddies are characterised by horizontal scales 
of ~10 km in the Arctic, and are important components of the ocean 
system. Increased wind power input to the Arctic Ocean system can 
in principle be compensated by the production of eddy kinetic energy; 
analysis of observations in the Beaufort Gyre region suggest this is 
about as likely as not (Meneghello et al., 2017). Data of sufﬁciently 
high resolution is limited in the boundary regions of the Arctic Ocean, 
precluding estimates of eddy variability on a basin-wide scale. In the 
central basin regions, a statistically signiﬁcant higher concentration of 
eddies was sampled in the Canadian Basin compared to the Eurasian 
Basin between 2003 and 2014; further, a medium correspondence 
was found between eddy activity in the Beaufort Gyre region and 
intensiﬁed gyre ﬂow (Zhao et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2016).
In contrast to the Southern Ocean (Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 3), 
there is comparatively little knowledge on changing Arctic frontal 
positions and current cores since AR5. An exception is that the 
Beaufort Gyre expanded to the northwest between 2003 and 2014, 
contemporaneous with changes in its freshwater accumulation and 
alterations in wind forcing, resulting in increased proximity to the 
Chukchi Plateau and Mendeleev Ridge (Armitage et al., 2017; Regan 
et al., 2019) (Section 3.2.1.2.2).

Horizontal Circulation and Movement of Fronts
The Southern Ocean is disproportionately important in global climate and ecological systems, being the major connection linking the 
Atlantic, Paciﬁc and Indian Oceans in the global circulation. The horizontal circulation in the circumpolar Southern Ocean is comprised 
of an eastward-ﬂowing mean current concentrated in a series of sinuous, braided jets exhibiting strong meandering variability and 
shedding small-scale transient eddies (Figure CB7.1). The mean ﬂow circumnavigates Antarctica as the world’s largest ocean current, 
the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), transporting approximately 173.3 ± 10.7 × 106 m3 s–1 (Donohue et al., 2016) of water 
eastward in a geostrophic balance set up by the contrasting properties of waters around Antarctica and those inside the subtropical 
gyres to the north of ACC. This contrast is maintained by a combination of strong westerly winds and ocean heat loss south of the ACC. 
Trends in the atmospheric forcing of the Southern Ocean are dominated by a strengthening of westerly winds in recent decades (Swart 
et al., 2015a), but there is no evidence that this enhanced wind stress has signiﬁcantly altered the ACC transport. While the annual 
mean value of transport is stable in the instrumental period (Chidichimo et al., 2014; Koenig et al., 2014; Donohue et al., 2016) it is 
difﬁcult to resolve changes in barotropic transport; overall there is medium conﬁdence that ACC transport is only weakly sensitive 
to changes in winds. This is consistent with longer-term analyses that ﬁnd only minimal changes in ACC transport since the last 
glaciation (McCave et al., 2013). Theoretical predictions and high-resolution ocean modelling suggest that the weak sensitivity of the 
ACC to changes in wind stress is a consequence of eddy saturation (Munday et al., 2013), whereby the time-mean state of the ocean 
remains close to a marginal condition for eddy instability and hence additional energy input from stronger winds cascades rapidly 
into the smaller-scale eddy ﬁeld. Satellite measurements of eddy kinetic energy over the last two decades are consistent with this, 
showing a statistically signiﬁcant upward trend in eddy energy in the Paciﬁc and Indian Ocean sectors of the Southern Ocean (Hogg 
et al., 2015) (medium conﬁdence). This is supported by eddy-resolving models, which also show a marked regional variability (Patara 
et al., 2016), and there is evidence that local hotspots in eddy energy, especially downstream of major topographic features including 
the Drake Passage, Kerguelen Plateau, Campbell Plateau and the East Paciﬁc Rise, may dominate the regional ﬁelds (Thompson and 
Naveira Garabato, 2014). 
Working Group I (WGI) of the IPCC’s 5th Assessment Report (AR5) assessed that there was medium conﬁdence that the mean position 
of the ACC had moved southwards in response to a contraction of the Southern Ocean circumpolar winds. Such movements can in 
principle have profound effects on marine ecosystems via, e.g., changing habitat ranges for different species (e.g., Cristofari et al., 2018; 
Meijers et al., 2019) (Section 3.2.3.2). Since AR5, however, substantial contrary evidence has emerged. While winds have strengthened 
over the Southern Ocean, reanalysis products show no signiﬁcant shift in the annual mean latitude of zonal wind jets between 1979–
2009 (Swart et al., 2015a). Similarly, a variety of methods applied to satellite data have found no long-term trend and no statistically 
signiﬁcant correlation of ACC position with winds (Gille, 2014; Chapman, 2017; Chambers, 2018). The discrepancy between these 
studies and those assessed in WGI AR5 appears to be caused by issues associated with using a ﬁxed sea surface height contour as 
a proxy for frontal position in the presence of strongly eddying ﬁelds (Chapman, 2014) and large-scale increases in sea surface height 
consistent with mean global trends in sea level rise (Gille, 2014). The increase in sea surface height is ascribed largely to warming-driven 
steric expansion in the upper ocean, but the mechanism driving such warming is still uncertain (Gille, 2014). These recent ﬁndings do 
not preclude more local changes in frontal position, but it is now assessed as unlikely that there has been a statistically signiﬁcant net 
southward movement of the mean ACC position over the past 20 years.
Overturning Circulation and Water Mass Formation
The Southern Ocean is the key region globally for the upwelling of interior ocean waters to the surface, enabling waters that were last 
ventilated in the pre-industrial era to interact with the industrial-era atmosphere and the cryosphere. New water masses are produced 
that sink back into the ocean interior. Such export of both extremely cold and dense Antarctic Bottom Water and the lighter mode and 
intermediate waters (Figure CB7.1) represents important pathways for surface properties to be sequestered from the atmosphere for 
decades to millennia. This upwelling and sinking constitutes a two-limbed overturning circulation, by which much of the global deep 
ocean is renewed. 
The Southern Ocean overturning circulation plays a strong role in mediating climate change via the transfer of heat and carbon 
(including that of anthropogenic origin) with the atmosphere (Sections  3.2.1.2;  5.2.2.2); it also has an impact on sea ice 
extent and concentration, with implications for climate via albedo (Section  3.2.1.1). It acts to oxygenate the ocean interior 
221
Polar Regions 
Chapter 3

and sequesters nutrients that ultimately end up supporting a signiﬁcant fraction of primary production in the rest of the world 
ocean (Section 5.2.2.2). The upwelling waters in the overturning bring heat to the Antarctic shelf seas, with consequences for ice 
shelves, marine-terminating glaciers and the stability of the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) (Section 3.3.1). The lower limb of this overturning 
circulation supplies Antarctic Bottom Water that forms the abyssal layer of much of the world ocean (Section 3.2.1.2; 5.2.2.2).
It is challenging to measure the Southern Ocean overturning directly, and misinterpretation of Waugh et al. (2013) led to AR5 
erroneously reporting the upper cell to have slowed (AR5 WGI, Section 3.6.4). However, additional indirect estimates since AR5 
provide support for the increase in the upper ocean overturning proposed by Waugh et al. (2013). Waugh (2014) and Ting and Holzer 
(2017) suggest that over the 1990s–2000s water mass ages changed in a manner consistent with an increase in upwelling and 
overturning. However, inverse analyses suggest that such overturning experiences signiﬁcant inter-decadal variability in response

to wind forcing, with reductions in 2000–2010 relative to 1990–2000 (DeVries et al., 2017). This variability, combined with 
the indirect nature of observational estimates, means that there is low conﬁdence in assessments of long-term changes in upper 
cell overturning.
Available evidence indicates that the volume of Antarctic Bottom Water in the global ocean has decreased (Purkey and Johnson, 2013; 
Desbruyeres et al., 2017) (medium conﬁdence), thinning at a rate of 8.1 m yr−1 since the 1950s (Azaneu et al., 2013); recently updated 
analyses conﬁrm this trend to present day (Figure 5.4). This suggests that the production and export of this water mass has probably 
slowed, though direct observational evidence is difﬁcult to obtain. The large-scale impacts of Antarctic Bottom Water changes include 
a potential modulation to the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (e.g., Patara and Böning, 2014; see also 
Section 5.2.2.2.1).
Projections
Projections of future trends in the Southern Ocean are dominated by the potential for a continued strengthening of the westerly winds 
(Bracegirdle et al., 2013), as well as a combination of warming and increased freshwater input from both increased net precipitation 
and changes in sea ice export (Downes and Hogg, 2013). Dynamical considerations and numerical simulations indicate that, if further 
increases in the westerly winds are sustained, then it is very likely that the eddy ﬁeld will continue to grow in intensity (Morrison and 
Hogg, 2013; Munday et al., 2013), with potential consequences for the upper-ocean overturning circulation and transport of tracers 
(Abernathey and Ferreira, 2015) (including heat, carbon, oxygen and nutrients), and likely that the mean position and strength of the 
ACC will remain only weakly sensitive to winds.
The considerable Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) inter-model variations in Southern Ocean time-mean 
circulation projections reported in WGI AR5 (Meijers et al., 2012; Downes and Hogg, 2013) remain largely unchanged. Some of the 
differences in projected changes have been found to be correlated with biases in the various models’ ability to simulate the historical 
state of the Southern Ocean, such as mixed layer depth (Sallée et al., 2013a) and westerly wind jet latitude (Bracegirdle et al., 2013). 
This suggests that bias reduction against observed historical metrics (Russell et al., 2018) in future generations of coupled models 
(e.g., Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6)) should lead to improved conﬁdence in aspects of projected Southern 
Ocean changes. CMIP5 models suggest that the subduction of mode and intermediate water will increase (Sallée et al., 2013b), which 
will affect oxygen and nutrient transports, and the overall transport of the Southern Ocean upper overturning cell will increase by up 
to 20% (Downes and Hogg, 2013), but model performance is limited by the inability to explicitly resolve eddy processes (Gent, 2016; 
Downes et al., 2018). The formation and export of Antarctic Bottom Water is predicted to continue decreasing (Heuzé et al., 2015) 
due to warming and freshening of surface source waters near the continent. These are, however, some of the most poorly represented 
processes in global models. Further uncertainty derives from increased meltwater from the AIS not being considered in the CMIP5 
climate models, despite its potential for signiﬁcant impact on Southern Ocean dynamics and the global climate, and its potential for 
positive feedbacks (Bronselaer et al., 2018). Due to these uncertainties, low conﬁdence is therefore ascribed to the CMIP5-based 
model projections of future Southern Ocean circulation and watermasses.
3.2.2 
Projected Changes in Sea Ice and Ocean
3.2.2.1 
Sea Ice
The multi-model ensemble of historical simulations from CMIP5 
models identify declines in total Arctic sea ice extent and thickness 
(Sections  3.2.1.1.1;  3.2.1.1.2; Figure  3.3) which agree with 
observations (Massonnet et al., 2012; Stroeve et al., 2012a; Stroeve 
et al., 2014a; Stroeve and Notz, 2015). There is a range in the ability 
of individual models to simulate observed sea ice thickness spatial 
patterns and sea ice drift rates (Jahn et al., 2012; Stroeve et al., 
2014a; Tandon et al., 2018). Reductions in Arctic sea ice extent scale 
linearly with both global temperatures and cumulative CO2 emissions 
in simulations and observations (Notz and Stroeve, 2016), although 
aerosols inﬂuenced historical sea ice trends (Gagné et al., 2017). The 
uncertainty in sea ice sensitivity (ice extent loss per unit of warming) 
is quite large (Niederdrenk and Notz, 2018) and the model sensitivity 
is too low in most CMIP5 models (Rosenblum and Eisenman, 2017). 
Emerging evidence suggests, however, that internal variability, 
including links between the Arctic and lower latitude, strongly 
inﬂuences the ability of models to simulate observed reductions in 
Arctic sea ice extent (Swart et al., 2015b; Ding et al., 2018).
CMIP5 models project continued declines in Arctic sea ice through 
the end of the century (Figure 3.3) (Notz and Stroeve, 2016) (high 
conﬁdence). There is a large spread in the timing of when the Arctic 
may become ice free in the summer, and for how long during the 
season (Massonnet et al., 2012; Stroeve et al., 2012a; Overland and 
Wang, 2013) as a result of natural climate variability (Notz, 2015; 
Swart et al., 2015b; Screen and Deser, 2019), scenario uncertainty 
(Stroeve et al., 2012a; Liu et al., 2013), and model uncertainties 
related to sea ice dynamics (Rampal et al., 2011; Tandon et al., 2018) 
223
Polar Regions 
Chapter 3
3
and thermodynamics (Massonnet et al., 2018). Internal climate 
variability results in an uncertainty of approximately 20 years in the 
timing of seasonally ice-free conditions (Notz, 2015; Jahn, 2018), but 
the clear link between summer sea ice extent and cumulative CO2 
emissions provides a basis for when consistent ice-free conditions 
may be expected (high conﬁdence). For stabilised global warming 
of 1.5ºC, sea ice in September is likely to be present at end of century 
with an approximately 1% chance of individual ice-free years (Notz 
and Stroeve, 2016; Sanderson et al., 2017; Jahn, 2018; Sigmond 
et al., 2018); after 10 years of stabilised warming at a 2ºC increase, 
more frequent occurrence of an ice-free summer Arctic is expected 
(around 10–35%) (Mahlstein and Knutti, 2012; Jahn et al., 2016; 
Notz and Stroeve, 2016). Model simulations show that a temporary 
temperature overshoot of a warming target has no lasting impact 
on ice cover (Armour et al., 2011; Ridley et al., 2012; Li et al., 2013).
CMIP5 models show a  wide range of mean states and trends in 
Antarctic sea ice (Turner et al., 2013; Shu et al., 2015). The ensemble 
mean across multiple models show a  decrease in total Antarctic 
sea ice extent during the satellite era, in contrast to the lack of 
any observed trend (Figure 3.3; Section 3.2.1.1.1). Interannual sea 
ice variability in the models is larger than observations (Zunz et al., 
2013), which may mask disparity between models and observations. 
Internal variability (Polvani and Smith, 2013; Zunz et al., 2013), and 
model sensitivity to warming (Rosenblum and Eisenman, 2017) are 
also important sources of uncertainty. During the historical period, 
regional trends of Antarctic sea ice are not captured by the models, 
particularly the decrease in the Bellingshausen Sea and the expansion 
in the Ross Sea (Hobbs et al., 2015). There is a very wide spread of 
model responses in the Weddell Sea (Hobbs et al., 2015; Ivanova 
et al., 2016), a region with complex ocean-sea ice interactions that 
many models do not replicate (de Lavergne et al., 2014).
There is low conﬁdence in projections of Antarctic sea ice because 
there are multiple anthropogenic forcings (ozone and greenhouse 
gases) and complicated processes involving the ocean, atmosphere, 
and adjacent ice sheet (Section 3.2.1.1.). Model deﬁciencies are related 
to stratiﬁcation (Sallée et al., 2013a), freshening by ice shelf melt 
water (Bintanja et al., 2015), atmospheric processes including clouds 
(Schneider and Reusch, 2015; Hyder et al., 2018), and wind and ocean 
driven processes (Purich et al., 2016a; Purich et al., 2016b; Schroeter 
et al., 2017; Purich et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018a). Uncertainty in sea 
ice projections reduces conﬁdence in projections of Antarctic Ice Sheet 
surface mass balance because sea ice affects Antarctic temperature and 
precipitation trends (Bracegirdle et al., 2015), and impacts projected 
changes in the Southern Hemisphere westerly jet (Bracegirdle et al., 
2018; England et al., 2018) with implications for the Southern Ocean 
overturning circulation (Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 3).
Box 3.3 |  Polynyas
Arctic Coastal Polynyas
Arctic polynyas (areas of open water surrounded by sea ice) are important because they ventilate the Arctic Ocean. The polynyas induce 
bottom reaching convection on shallow shelves (Damm et al., 2018) because the warm and exposed ocean surface creates very high 
heat ﬂuxes and new sea ice formation during winter, releasing brine and creating dense water (Barber et al., 2012). On the shallow 
Siberian shelves, the ocean surface waters are dominated by river runoff which is rich with sediments (Damm et al., 2018), which end 
up both in the dense bottom water and in new sea ice (Bauch et al., 2012; Janout et al., 2015). This process maintains the Arctic Ocean 
halocline (Bauch et al., 2011), which insulates the sea ice cover from the heat of the underlying Atlantic-derived waters.
Polynyas are projected to change in different ways depending on regional ice conditions and ice formation processes. Further reductions 
in sea ice are projected for Arctic shelf seas which have already lost ice in recent decades (Barnhart et al., 2015; Onarheim et al., 2018) 
so polynyas will cease to exist where seasonal sea ice disappears or evolve to become part of the marginal sea ice zone due to changes 
in ice dynamics (i.e., the North Water polynya and the Circumpolar Flaw Lead); new or enlarged polynyas could result in regions where 
thinner ice becomes more effectively advected offshore, or where marine terminating glaciers increase land ice ﬂuxes to the marine 
system (medium conﬁdence). The reduced survival rate of sea ice in the Transpolar Drift interrupts the transport of sediment-laden ice 
produced from Siberian shelf polynyas (Krumpen et al., 2019), with consequences for the associated biogeochemical matter and gas 
ﬂuxes (Damm et al., 2018) (medium conﬁdence).
Projected changes to polynyas are important because the spring phytoplankton bloom starts early as the ocean is often well-ventilated 
and nutrient rich, so the entire biological range from phytoplankton to seabirds to marine mammals thrive in polynya waters (high 
conﬁdence) (Stirling, 1997; Arrigo and van Dijken, 2004; Karnovsky et al., 2009). Secondary production and upper food web processes 
are typically adapted to the early availability of energy to the system with arrival of higher trophic species (Asselin et al., 2011). 
Because of the abundance of marine food resources including seals, whales and ﬁsh in and around polynyas, Arctic peoples have 
hunted regularly in these areas for thousands of years (Barber and Massom, 2007). Recent implementation of Inuit-led marine 
management areas acknowledge the Inuit knowledge of polynyas, and recognise the potential for development of ﬁsheries and 
other resources in polynya systems, provided these activities minimise harm on the environment and wildlife. The Inuit Circumpolar 
Council’s Pikialasorsuaq Commission is an example of a proposal to develop an Inuit management area in the North Water Polynya 
(Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 1).

Antarctic Coastal Polynyas
The Antarctic continent is surrounded by coastal polynyas, which form from the combined effects of winds and landfast ice in the lee of 
coastal features that protrude into the westward coastal current (Nihashi and Ohshima, 2015; Tamura et al., 2016). Intense ice growth 
within these polynyas contributes to the production of Antarctic Bottom Water, the densest and most voluminous water mass in the 
global ocean (Jacobs, 2004; Nicholls et al., 2008; Orsi and Wiederwohl, 2009; Ohshima et al., 2013). Sea ice production is greatest in 
Ross and Weddell sea polynyas and around East Antarctica (Drucker et al., 2011; Nihashi and Ohshima, 2015; Tamura et al., 2016) 
(high conﬁdence).
Antarctic coastal polynyas are biological hot-spots that support high rates of primary production (Ainley et al., 2015; Arrigo et al., 
2015) due to a combination of both high light (Park et al., 2017) and high nutrient levels, especially iron (Gerringa et al., 2015). Basal 
ice shelf melt is the primary supplier of iron to coastal polynyas (Arrigo and van Dijken, 2015) although sea ice melt and intrusions 
of Circumpolar Deep Water are signiﬁcant in the Ross Sea (McGillicuddy et al., 2015; Hatta et al., 2017). As ice shelves retreat, the 
polynyas created in their wake also increase local primary production: the new polynyas created after the collapse of the Larsen A and 
B ice shelves are as productive as other Antarctic shelf regions, likely increasing organic matter export and altering marine ecosystem 
evolution (Cape et al., 2013). The recent calving of Mertz Glacier Tongue in East Antarctica has altered sea ice and ocean stratiﬁcation 
(Fogwill et al., 2016) such that polynyas there are now twice as productive (Shadwick et al., 2017). 
The productivity associated with these polynyas is a critical food source for some of the most abundant top predators in Antarctic 
waters, including penguins, albatross and seals (Raymond et al., 2014; Malpress et al., 2017) (Section 3.2.3.2.4). However, only 
a fraction of the carbon ﬁxed by phytoplankton in coastal polynyas is consumed by upper trophic levels. The rest sinks to the seaﬂoor 
where it is re-mineralised or sequestered (Shadwick et al., 2017), or is advected off the shelf (Lee et al., 2017b). Given the high amount 
of residual macronutrients in polynya surface waters, there is evidence that future changes in ice shelf melt rates could increase water 
column productivity (Gerringa et al., 2015; Rickard and Behrens, 2016; Kaufman et al., 2017), inﬂuencing Antarctic coastal ecosystems 
and increasing the ability of continental shelf waters to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide (Arrigo and van Dijken, 2015).
The Weddell Polynya
The Weddell Polynya is a large area of open water within the winter ice pack of the Weddell Sea close to the Maud Rise seamount 
(at approximately 65ºS, 3ºE), and has importance on a global scale for deep water ventilation. The polynya opens intermittently, and 
remained open from 1974 to 1976, with an area of 0.2–0.3 million km2 (Carsey, 1980). A similar polynya appeared in spring 2017, 
with a smaller area in 2016, but did not occur in 2018 (Campbell et al., 2019; Jena et al., 2019). Based on these recent events, there is 
medium conﬁdence in the drivers of Weddell Polynya formation; it forms over deep water and appears connected to sea ice divergence 
created by ocean eddies (Holland, 2001) or strong winds (Campbell et al., 2019; Francis et al., 2019; Wilson et al., 2019). Around Maud 
Rise, the ocean is weakly stratiﬁed, and winter sea ice formation causes brine release and the related deepening mixed layer brings 
warmer deep waters towards the surface. This causes heat loss to the atmosphere above 200 W m-² (Campbell et al., 2019). These 
polynya formation processes cause deep ocean convection that releases heat from the deep ocean to the atmosphere (Smedsrud, 
2005), and may contribute to the uptake of anthropogenic carbon (Bernardello et al., 2014).
In some CMIP5 models, phases of Weddell polynya activity appear for decades or centuries at a time, and then cease for a similar 
period (Reintges et al., 2017). The observational era is not sufﬁciently long to rule out this behaviour. Models indicate that under 
anthropogenic climate change, surface freshening caused by increased precipitation reduces the occurrence of the Weddell polynya 
(de Lavergne et al., 2014). There are systematic biases in modelled ocean stratiﬁcation resulting in low conﬁdence in future Weddell 
Polynya projections (Reintges et al., 2017).
3.2.2.2 
Physical Oceanography
Consistent with the projected sea ice decline, there is high conﬁdence 
that the Arctic Ocean will warm signiﬁcantly towards the end of this 
century at the surface and in the deeper layers. Most CMIP5 models 
capture the seasonal changes in surface heat and freshwater ﬂuxes 
for the present day climate, and show that the excess summer solar 
heating is used to melt sea ice, in a positive ice albedo feedback 
(Ding et al., 2016). Using RCP8.5, Vavrus et al. (2012) found that the 
Atlantic layer is projected to warm by 2.5ºC at around 400 m depth 
at the end of the century, but only by 0.5ºC in the surface mixed layer. 
Consistent results for lower Atlantic Water layer warming were found 
by Koenigk and Brodeau (2014) for RCP2.5 (0.5ºC), RCP4.5 (1.0ºC) 
and RCP8.5 (2.0ºC).
Poleward ocean heat transport contributes to Arctic Ocean warming 
(medium conﬁdence). Comparing 20 CMIP5 simulations for RCP8.5, 
Nummelin et al. (2017) found a 2ºC–6ºC range in Arctic ampliﬁcation 
of surface air temperature north of 70ºN, consistent with increased 
ocean heat transport. Comparing 26 different CMIP5 simulations for 
RCP4.5, Burgard and Notz (2017) found that ocean heat transport 
changes explain the Arctic Ocean multi-model mean warming, but 
225
Polar Regions

that differences between models are compensated by changes in 
surface ﬂuxes. Increased ocean heat transport into the Barents Sea 
beyond 2020 appears as a  probable mechanism with continued 
warming (Koenigk and Brodeau, 2014; Årthun et al., 2019). Based 
on four CMIP5 models, the Barents Sea is projected to become 
ice-free during winter beyond 2050 under RCP8.5 (Onarheim and 
Årthun, 2017), to which the main response is an increased ocean-to-
atmosphere heat ﬂux and related surface warming (Smedsrud et al., 
2013). The ocean heat transport increases in all Arctic gateways, but 
is dominated by the Barents Sea, and when winter sea ice disappears 
here the heat loss cannot increase further and the excess ocean heat 
continues into the Arctic Basin (Koenigk and Brodeau, 2014). 
The surface mixed layer of the Arctic Ocean is expected to freshen 
in future because an intensiﬁed hydrological cycle will increase river 
runoff (Haine et al., 2015) (medium conﬁdence). The related increase 
in stratiﬁcation has the potential to contribute to the warming of the 
deep Atlantic Water layer, as upward vertical mixing will be reduced 
(Nummelin et al., 2016). There are, however, biases in salinity of ~1 
across the Arctic Basin for the present day climate (Ilicak et al., 2016) 
in forced global ice-ocean models with conﬁgurations comparable to 
CMIP5, suggesting limited predictive skill for the Arctic freshwater cycle.
CMIP5 projections (Figure 3.3) indicate that observed Southern Ocean 
warming trends will continue under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, 
leading to 1ºC–3ºC warming by 2100 mostly in the upper ocean 
(Sallée et al., 2013a). Projections demonstrate a similar distribution of 
heat storage to historical observations, notably focused in deep pools 
north of the Subantarctic Front (e.g., Armour et al., 2016). Antarctic 
Bottom Water becomes coherently warmer by up to 0.3ºC by 2100 
across the model ensemble under RCP8.5 (Heuzé et al., 2015). The 
upper ocean also becomes considerably fresher (salinity decrease of 
approximately 0.1) (Sallée et al., 2013b) with an overall increase in 
stratiﬁcation and a shallowing of mixed layers (Sallée et al., 2013a). 
Although the sign of model changes appear mostly robust, there is 
low conﬁdence in magnitude due to the large inter-model spread 
in projections and signiﬁcant warm biases in historical water mass 
properties (Sallée et al., 2013a) and sea surface temperature, which 
may be up to 3ºC too high in the historical runs (Wang et al., 2014). 
Projections of changes in Southern Ocean circulation are discussed in 
Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 3.
3.2.2.3 
Carbon and Ocean Acidiﬁcation
The Arctic and Southern Ocean have a  systemic vulnerability to 
aragonite undersaturation (Orr et al., 2005). For the RCP8.5 scenario, 
the entire Arctic and Southern Ocean surface waters will very likely 
be typiﬁed by year-around conditions corrosive for aragonite minerals 
for 2090–2100 (Figure 3.4) (Hauri et al., 2015; Sasse et al., 2015), 
whilst under RCP2.6 the extent of undersaturated waters are reduced 
markedly. At a basin/circumpolar scale, there is high conﬁdence in 
these projections due to our robust understanding of the driving 
mechanisms. However, there is medium conﬁdence for the response 
of speciﬁc locations, due to the need for improved resolution of the 
local circulation, interactions with sea ice, and other processes that 
modulate the rate of acidiﬁcation.
Under RCP8.5, melting ice causes the greatest declining rate of pH 
and CaCO3 saturation state in the Central Arctic, Canadian Arctic 
Archipelago and Bafﬁn Bay (Popova et al., 2014). In the Canada 
Basin, projections using RCP8.5 show reductions in mean surface 
pH from approximately  8.1 in 1986–2005 to  7.7 by 2066–2085, 
and aragonite saturation from  1.52–0.74 during the same period 
(Steiner et al., 2014). A  shoaling of the aragonite saturation 
horizon of approximately 1200 m, a large increase in area extent 
of undersaturated surface waters, and a pH change in the surface 
water of –0.19 are projected using the SRES A1B scenario (broadly 
comparable to RCP6.0) in the Nordic Sea from 2000 to 2065 (Skogen 
et al., 2014). Under the same scenario, aragonite undersaturation is 
projected to occur in the bottom waters over the entire Kara Sea shelf 
by 2040 and over most of the Barents and East Greenland shelves 
by 2070 due to the accumulation of anthropogenic CO2 (Wallhead 
et al., 2017).
Under RCP8.5, the rate of CO2 uptake by the Southern Ocean 
is projected to increase from the contemporary  0.91 Pg C  yr–1 
to  2.38 (1.65–2.55) Pg C  yr–1 by 2100, but the growth in uptake 
rate will slow and likely stop around 2070 ± 10 corresponding to 
cumulative CO2 emissions of 1600 Gt C (Kessler and Tjiputra, 2016;

Wang et al., 2016b). This halt in the increase in the uptake rate of CO2 
is linked to the combined feedbacks from well-understood reductions 
in buffering capacity and warming, as well as the increased upwelling 
rate of carbon-rich Circumpolar Deep Water (Hauck and Volker, 2015) 
(Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 3). Although there is high agreement 
amongst models, contemporary biases in the ﬂuxes of CO2 in CMIP5 
models in the Southern Ocean (Mongwe et al., 2018) suggest medium 
conﬁdence levels for these projections.
Alongside the mean state changes, Southern Ocean aragonite 
saturation is also affected by the seasonal cycle of carbonate as 
well as by the impact of reduced buffering capacity (SM3.2.4) on the 
seasonal cycle of CO2 (Sasse et al., 2015; McNeil and Sasse, 2016). 
This leads to an ampliﬁcation of the seasonal variability of pCO2 
(Hauck and Volker, 2015; McNeil and Sasse, 2016; Landschützer et al., 
2018) and the hydrogen ion concentration that accelerates the onset 
of hypercapnia (i.e., high pCO2 levels; pCO2 > 1000 μatm) to nearly 
2 decades (~2085) ahead of anthropogenic CO2 forcing (McNeil and 
Sasse, 2016). The seasonal cycles of pH and aragonite saturation 
will be attenuated (Kwiatkowski and Orr, 2018) (Section  5.2.2.3), 
however when the mean state changes are combined with the 
changes in seasonality, the onset of undersaturation is brought 
forward by 10–20 years (Table SM3.5). Model projections remain 
uncertain and affected by the resolution of local ocean physics, which 
leads to overall medium conﬁdence in the timing of undersaturation 
and hypercapnia.
3.2.3 
Impacts on Marine Ecosystems
3.2.3.1 
Arctic
Climate change has, and is projected to continue to have, signiﬁcant 
implications for Arctic marine ecosystems, with consequences at 
different trophic levels both in the pelagic, benthic, and sympagic 
(sea ice related) realms (Figure 3.5). Speciﬁcally, climate change is 
projected to alter the distribution and properties of Arctic marine 
habitats with associated implications for species composition, 
production and ecosystem structure and function (Frainer et al., 
2017; Kaartvedt and Titelman, 2018; Moore et al., 2018). The rate 
and severity of ecosystem impacts will be spatially heterogeneous 
and dependent on future emission scenarios.
In the few Arctic regions where data is sufﬁcient to assess trends in 
biodiversity, the ecosystem level responses appear to be products 
of multiple interacting physical, chemical and biological processes 
(Frederiksen, 2017) (medium conﬁdence). Climate change impacts 
on vertical ﬂuxes and stratiﬁcation (Sections 3.2.1.2.3, 3.2.2.2) will 
contribute to changes in bentho-pelagic-sympagic coupling. For 
instance, projected climate driven changes in ocean properties and 
hydrography (Section 3.2.2.2) and the abundance of pelagic grazers 
(Box 3.4) could alter the export of organic matter to the sea ﬂoor with 
associated impacts on the benthos in some Arctic shelf ecosystems 
(Moore and Stabeno, 2015; Stasko et al., 2018) (low conﬁdence). 
Projected future reductions in summer sea ice (Section  3.2.1.1), 
increased stratiﬁcation in summer, shifting currents and fronts 
and increased ocean temperatures (Section  3.2.2.2) and ocean 
acidiﬁcation (Section 3.2.2.3) are all expected to impact the future 
production and distribution of several marine ﬁsh and invertebrates 
(high conﬁdence). 
Ocean acidiﬁcation (Section  3.2.2.3) will affect several key Arctic 
species (medium conﬁdence). The effects of current and projected 
levels of acidiﬁcation have been examined for a broad suite of species 
groups (bivalves, cephalopods, echinoderms, crustaceans, corals 
and ﬁshes) and these studies reveal species-speciﬁc differences in 
sensitivity, as well as differences in the scope for, and energetic cost 
of, adaptation (Luckman et al., 2014; Howes et al., 2015; Falkenberg 
et al., 2018). 
3.2.3.1.1 Plankton and primary production
There is evidence that the combination of loss of sea ice, freshening, 
and regional stratiﬁcation (Sections 3.2.1.1 and 3.2.1.2) has affected 
the timing, distribution and production of primary producers (Moore 
et al., 2018) (high conﬁdence). Satellite data show that the decline 
in ice cover has resulted in a >30% increase in annual net primary 
production (NPP) in ice-free Arctic waters since 1998 (Arrigo and 
van Dijken, 2011; Bélanger et al., 2013; Arrigo and van Dijken, 2015; 
Kahru et al., 2016), a  phenomenon corroborated by both in situ 
data (Stanley et al., 2015) and modelling studies (Vancoppenolle 
et al., 2013; Jin et al., 2016). Ice loss has also resulted in earlier 
phytoplankton blooms (Kahru et al., 2011) with blooms being 
dominated by larger-celled phytoplankton (Fujiwara et al., 2016). 
The longer open water season in the Arctic has also increased the 
incidence of autumn blooms, a  phenomenon previously rarely 
observed in Arctic waters (Ardyna et al., 2017).
Thinner Arctic sea ice cover has led to the appearance of intense 
phytoplankton blooms that develop beneath ﬁrst-year sea ice 
(medium conﬁdence). Blooms of this size (1000s of km2) and 
intensity (peaks of approximately 30 mg Chla-m–3) were previously 
thought to be restricted to the marginal ice zone and the open ocean 
where ample light reaches the surface ocean for rapid phytoplankton 
growth (Arrigo et al., 2012). Evidence shows that these blooms 
can thrive beneath sea ice in areas of reduced thickness, increased 
coverage of melt ponds (Arrigo et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015; Jin 
et al., 2016; Horvat et al., 2017), ﬁrst-year ridges at the snow-ice 
interface (Fernández-Méndez et al., 2018), and a large number of 
cracks (high lead fractions) in the ice (Assmy et al., 2017), although 
the latter has not changed signiﬁcantly in the last three decades 
(Wang et al., 2016a). Local features including snow-free or thin 
snow, hummocks and ridges commonly found on multi-year ice also 
provide habitat for ice algae (Lange et al., 2017).
The reduction in sea ice area and thickness in the Arctic Ocean 
appears to be indirectly impacting rates of NPP through increased 
exposure of the surface ocean to atmospheric forcing (medium 
conﬁdence) and these indirect impacts will possibly increase in the 
future (low conﬁdence). Greater wind stress has been shown to 
increase upwelling of nutrients at the shelf break both over ice-free 
waters (Williams and Carmack, 2015) and a partial ice cover (Schulze 
and Pickart, 2012), leading to more new production (Williams and 
Carmack, 2015). At the same time, enhanced vertical stratiﬁcation 
227

(Section  3.2.1.2.2, SM3.2.2) and decreased upwelling of nutrients 
into surface waters (Capotondi et al., 2012; Nummelin et al., 2016) 
may reduce Arctic NPP in the future, especially in the central basin 
(Ardyna et al., 2017). It could also impact phytoplankton community 
composition and size structure, with small-celled phytoplankton, 
which require less nutrients, becoming more dominant as nutrient 
concentrations in surface waters decline (Yun et al., 2015). 
In addition to its impact on phytoplankton bloom dynamics, the 
decline in the proportion of multi-year sea ice and proliferation of 
a thinner ﬁrst year sea ice cover may favour growth of microalgae 
within the ice due to increased light availability (medium conﬁdence). 
Recent studies suggest that the contribution of sea ice algae to total 
Arctic NPP is higher now than values measured previously (Song et al., 
2016), accounting for nearly 10% of total NPP (ice plus water) and 
as much as 60% in places like the central Arctic (Fernández-Méndez 
et al., 2015).
Ongoing changes in NPP will impact the biogeochemistry and 
ecology of large parts of the Arctic Ocean (high conﬁdence). In areas 
of enhanced nutrient availability and greater NPP, dominance by 
larger-celled microalgae increases vertical export efﬁciency from the 
surface downwards in both ice covered (Boetius et al., 2013; Lalande 
et al., 2014; Mäkelä et al., 2017) and open ocean (Le Moigne et al., 
2015) areas. However, because exported biomass production may be 
increasing in some areas but declining in others, the net impact may 
be small (Randelhoff and Guthrie, 2016) (Sections 3.2.3.1.2, 5.3.6, 
SM3.2.6). Phytoplankton may have the capacity to compensate for 
ocean acidiﬁcation under a  range of temperatures and pH values 
(Hoppe et al., 2018).
Increased water temperatures (Section 3.2.1) and shifts in the spatial 
pattern and timing of the ice algal and phytoplankton blooms, have 
impacted the phenology, magnitude and duration of zooplankton 
production with associated changes in the zooplankton community 
composition (medium conﬁdence). Negative effects of reductions in 
ice algae on zooplankton may be partially offset by predicted increases 
in water column phytoplankton production in the Bering Sea (Wang 
et al., 2015). Changes in sea ice coverage and thickness may alter the 
phenology, abundance and distribution of zooplankton in the future. 
Projected changes will initially have the most pronounced impact 
on sympagic amphipods, but will subsequently affect food web 
functioning and carbon dynamics of the pelagic system (Kohlbach 
et al., 2016).
At the more southern boundaries of the Arctic such as the southeastern 
Bering Sea, warm conditions have led to reduced production of large 
copepods and euphausiids (medium conﬁdence) (Sigler et al., 2017; 
Kimmel et al., 2018). On more northern shelves, the increased open 
water period has led to increases in large copepods over a 60 year 
period within the Chukchi Sea (Ershova et al., 2015) and in recent 
years also the Beaufort Sea (Smoot and Hopcroft, 2017), while in the 
Central Basins zooplankton biomass in general has increased (Hunt 
et al., 2014; Rutzen and Hopcroft, 2018) (medium conﬁdence).
There are inconsistent ﬁndings concerning the future development 
of copepods in the Arctic. Coupled biophysical model results suggest 
that sea ice loss will increase primary production and that will 
primarily be consumed pelagically by zooplankton grazers such as 
Calanus hyperboreus; increasing their abundances in the central 
Arctic (Kvile et al., 2018). Feng et al. (2018) concluded that C. glacialis 
should continue to beneﬁt from a  warmer Arctic Ocean. On the 
other hand, in the transition zone between Arctic and Atlantic water 
masses, C. glacialis may face increasing competition from the more 
boreal C. ﬁnmarchicus (Dalpadado et al., 2016). Renaud et al. (2018) 
found the lipid content of Calanus spp. was related to size and not 
species. This suggests that climate driven shifts in dominant Calanus 
species may, because of overlap in size spectrum and contrary to 
earlier assumptions, not negatively impact their consumers in the 
Barents Sea.
The effects of ocean acidiﬁcation on Arctic zooplankton and 
pteropods (small pelagic molluscs) have been examined for only 
a few species and these studies reveal that the severity of effects 
is dependent on emission scenarios and the species sensitivity and 
adaptive capacity. The copepod  C. glacialis exhibits stage-speciﬁc 
sensitivities to ocean acidiﬁcation with some stages being relatively 
insensitive to decreases in pH and other stages exhibiting substantial 
reductions in scope for growth (Bailey et al., 2017; Thor et al., 2018). 
Although there is strong evidence that pteropods are sensitive to 
the effects of ocean acidiﬁcation (Manno et al., 2017) recent studies 
indicate they may exhibit some ability to adapt (Peck et al., 2016; 
Peck et al., 2018). However, the metabolic costs of adaptation may 
be constraining, especially during periods of low food availability 
(Lischka and Riebesell, 2016).
3.2.3.1.2 Benthic communities
There is evidence that earlier spring sea ice retreat and later autumn 
sea ice formation (Section  3.2.1.1) are changing the phenology 
of primary production with cascading effects on Arctic benthic 
community biodiversity and production (Link et al., 2013) (medium 
conﬁdence). In the Barents Sea, evidence suggests that factors 
directly related to climate change (sea ice dynamics, ocean mixing, 
bottom-water temperature change, ocean acidiﬁcation, river/glacier 
freshwater discharge; Sections  3.2.1.1,  3.2.1.2) are impacting the 
benthic species composition (Birchenough et al., 2015). Other human 
inﬂuenced activities, such as commercial bottom trawling and the 
introduction of non-native species are also regarded as major drivers 
of observed and expected changes in benthic community structure 
(Johannesen et al., 2017), and may interact with climate impacts.
Rapid and extensive structural changes in the rocky-bottom 
communities of two Arctic fjords in the Svalbard Archipelago during 
1980–2010 have been documented and linked to gradually increasing 
seawater temperature and decreasing sea ice cover (Kortsch et al., 
2012; Kortsch et al., 2015). Also, there are indications of declining 
benthic biomass in the northern Bering Sea (Grebmeier and Cooper, 
2016) and southern Chukchi Sea (Grebmeier et al., 2015). It is unclear 
whether these rapid ecosystem changes will be tipping points for 
local ecosystems (Chapter  6, Table  6.1; Wassmann and Lenton, 
2012). However, biomass of kelps have increased considerably 
in the intertidal to shallow subtidal in Arctic regions over the last 
two decades, connected to reduced physical impact by ice scouring 
228
Chapter 3 
Polar Regions

and increased light availability as a consequence of warming and 
concomitant fast-ice retreat (Kortsch et al., 2012; Paar et al., 2016) 
(medium conﬁdence) (see Section  5.3.3 and SM3.2.6 for further 
information on kelp).
The growth, early survival and production of commercially important 
crab stocks in the Bering Sea are inﬂuenced by time-varying exposure 
to multiple interacting drivers including bottom temperature, larval 
advection, predation, competition and ﬁshing (Burgos et al., 2013; 
Long et al., 2015; Ryer et al., 2016). In Newfoundland and Labrador 
waters and on the western Scotian Shelf, snow crab (Chionoecetes 
opilio) productivity has declined (Mullowney et al., 2014; Zisserson 
and Cook, 2017). Contrary to this, snow crabs have expanded their 
distribution in the Barents Sea and commercial harvesting increased 
(Hansen, 2016; Lorentzen et al., 2018) (high conﬁdence). 
Bering sea crabs exhibit species-speciﬁc sensitivities to reduced pH 
(Long et al., 2017; Swiney et al., 2017; Long et al., 2019). However, 
current pH levels do not appear to have negatively impacted crab 
production in the Bering or Barents Seas (Mathis et al., 2015; Punt 
et al., 2016).
3.2.3.1.3 Fish
Since AR5, additional evidence shows climate-induced physical and 
biogeochemical changes are impacting, and will continue to impact, 
the distribution and production of marine ﬁsh (medium conﬁdence). 
Changes in the spatial distribution and production of Arctic ﬁsh are 
best documented for ecologically and commercially important stocks 
in the Bering and Barents Seas (Box 3.4; Figure 3.5), while data is 
severely limited in other Arctic shelf regions and the Central Arctic 
Ocean (CAO). 
Higher temperature and changes in the quality and distribution 
of prey is already affecting marine ﬁsh (Wassmann et al., 2015; 
Dalpadado et al., 2016; Hunt et al., 2016; Section  3.2.3.1) (high 
conﬁdence for detection, medium conﬁdence for attribution). In 
the northern Barents Sea, Atlantic Sector, higher temperatures 
(Section 3.2.1.2) have expanded suitable feeding areas for boreal/
subarctic species (Box 3.4) and has contributed to increased Atlantic 
cod (Gadus morhua) production (Kjesbu et al., 2014). In contrast, 
Arctic species like polar cod (Boreogadus saida) are expected to be 
affected negatively by a shortened ice covered season and reduced 
sea ice extent through loss of spawning habitat and shelter, increased 
predatory pressure, reduced prey availability (Christiansen, 2017),

Figure 3.5 |  Schematic summary of key drivers that are causing, or are projected to cause, direct effects on Arctic marine ecosystems (Section 3.2.1.2). Effects presented here 
are described in the main text (Sections 3.2.3.1; 3.2.4.1.1; 3.2.4.2; 3.2.4.3) with associated conﬁdence levels and citations. For mixed effects, no conﬁdence level is given 
(see main text for details on how multiple drivers cause interacting positive and negative effects). Projected effects are conceptual representations based on high emission 
scenarios (Section 3.2.1.2). The cross-sectional view of the Arctic ecosystem shows the association of key functional groups (marine mammals, birds, ﬁsh, zooplankton, 
phytoplankton and benthic assemblages) with Arctic marine habitats. Species depicted in the ﬁshing net are not a comprehensive depiction of all target species.

and impaired growth and reproductive success (Nahrgang et al., 
2014). These changes may cause structural changes in food webs, 
with large piscivorous and semipelagic boreal ﬁsh species replacing 
small bodied Arctic benthivores (Box  3.4; Fossheim et al., 2015; 
Frainer et al., 2017).
Time series on responses of anadromous ﬁsh (including salmon) in 
the high Arctic are limited, although these stocks will also be exposed 
to a wide range of future stressors (Reist et al., 2016). There is some 
evidence that environmental variability inﬂuences the production of 
anadromous species such as Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), brown 
trout (Salmo trutta), and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) through its 
inﬂuence on growth and winter survival (Jensen et al., 2018).
The scope for adaptation of marine ﬁsh to a changing ocean conditions 
is uncertain, but knowledge is informed by previous biogeographic 
studies (Chernova, 2011; Lynghammar et al., 2013). The present 
niche partitioning between subarctic and Arctic pelagic ﬁsh species 
is expected to become more diffuse with potential negative impacts 
on cold adapted species such as polar cod (Laurel et al., 2017; Alabia 
et al., 2018; Logerwell et al., 2018) (low conﬁdence). Winter ocean 
conditions in the high Arctic are projected to remain cold in most 
regions (Section 3.2.3.1), limiting the immigration of subarctic species 
that spawn in positive temperatures onto the high Arctic shelves 
(Landa et al., 2014). Projected increases in summer temperature may 
open gateways to subarctic pelagic foragers in summer, particularly 
in the inﬂow regions of the Kara and Chukchi Seas, and the shelf 
regions of east and west Greenland (Mueter et al., 2017; Joli et al., 
2018). For example, the pelagic capelin (Mallotus villosus) are capable 
of entering the CAO, but may be restricted in winter by availability 
of suitable spawning areas and lack of antifreeze proteins (Hop and 
Gjøsæter, 2013; Christiansen, 2017). 
Regional climate scenarios, derived from down-scaled global climate 
scenarios, have been used to drive environmentally linked ﬁsh 
population models (Hermann et al., 2016; Holsman et al., 2016; Ianelli 
et al., 2016; Hermann et al., 2019). Hermann et al. (2019) contrasted 
future production of copepods and euphausiids in the eastern 
Bering Sea under scenarios derived from projected downscaled 
high spatial and temporal resolution ocean habitats under RCP4.5 
and RCP8.5. Consistent with AR5, these updated scenarios project 
future declines in the abundance of large copepods under RCP8.5, 
a  result that has been shown to negatively impact production of 
walleye pollock, Paciﬁc cod (Gadus microcephalus) and arrowtooth 
ﬂounder (Atheresthes stomias) (Sigler et al., 2017; Kimmel et al., 
2018) (medium conﬁdence). Hedger et al. (2013) predicts increases 
in Atlantic salmon abundance in northern Norway (river Alta 
around 70ºN) with future warming (low conﬁdence). Under end of 
century RCP8.5 projections, ocean acidiﬁcation and higher ocean 
temperatures are expected to reduce production of Barents Sea cod 
(Stiasny et al., 2016; Koenigstein et al., 2018) (low conﬁdence).
3.2.3.1.4 Seabirds and marine mammals
Environmental alterations caused by global warming are resulting in 
phenological, behavioural, physiological, and distributional changes 
in Arctic marine mammal and seabird populations (Gilg et al., 2012; 
Laidre et al., 2015; Gall et al., 2017) (high conﬁdence). These changes 
include altered ecological interactions as well as direct responses to 
habitat degradation induced especially via loss of sea ice. Population 
responses to warming have not all been linear, some have been 
particularly strong and abrupt due to environmental regime shifts, as 
seen in black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla). A steep population 
decline in kittiwake colonies distributed throughout their breeding 
range coincided with an abrupt warming of sea-surface temperature in 
the 1990s, while their population dynamics did not seem to be affected 
during periods of more gradual warming (Descamps et al., 2017).
Seabirds and marine mammals are mobile animals that respond to 
changes in the distribution of their preferred habitats and prey, by 
shifting their range, altering the timing or pathways for migration 
or prey shifting when this is feasible (Post et al., 2013; Hamilton 
et al., 2019) (very high conﬁdence). However, some species display 
strong site ﬁdelity that can be maladaptive in a changing climate and 
Arctic endemic marine mammals (all of which are ice-afﬁliated for 
breeding) in general have little scope to move northward in response 
to warming (Kovacs et al., 2012; Hamilton et al., 2015). Changes in the 
location or availability of polar fronts, polynyas, tidal glacier fronts or 
ice edges have impacted where Arctic sea birds and marine mammals 
concentrate because of the inﬂuence these physical features have on 
productivity; traditionally these areas have been key foraging sites 
for top predators in the Arctic (deHart and Picco, 2015; Hamilton 
et al., 2017; Hunt et al., 2018).
In some species, shifts in distribution in response to changes in 
suitable habitat have been associated with increased mortality. 
Increased mortality rates of walrus (Odobenus rosmarus) calves have 
been observed during on-shore stampedes of unusually large herds, 
because Paciﬁc walrus females are no longer able to haul out on ice 
over the shelf in summer due to the retraction of the southern ice 
edge into the deep Arctic Ocean (Kovacs et al., 2016). Shifts in the 
temporal and spatial distribution and availability of suitable areas 
of sea ice for ice-breeding seals have occurred (Bajzak et al., 2011; 
Øigård et al., 2013) with increases in strandings and pup mortality 
in years with little ice (Johnston et al., 2012c; Soulen et al., 2013; 
Stenson and Hammill, 2014). 
Climate impacts that reduce the availability of prey resources can 
negatively impact marine mammals (Asselin et al., 2011; Øigård 
et al., 2014; Choy et al., 2017) (very high conﬁdence). Sea ice changes 
have increased the foraging effort of ringed seals (Pusa hispida) in 
the marginal ice zone north of Svalbard (Hamilton et al., 2015), also 
causing diet shifts (Lowther et al., 2017). Ringed seals in Svalbard 
are using terrestrial haul out sites during summer for the ﬁrst time 
in observed history, following major declines in sea ice (Lydersen 
et al., 2017), an example of an adaptive behavioural response to 
extreme habitat changes. Sea ice related changes in the export of 
production to the benthos (Section 3.3.3.1) and associated changes 
in the benthic community (Section  3.4.1.1.2) may impact marine 
230

mammals dependent on benthic prey (e.g., walruses and gray whales, 
Eschrichtius robustus) (Brower et al., 2017; Udevitz et al., 2017; Szpak 
et al., 2018).
Changes in the timing, distribution and thickness of sea ice and 
snow (Sections  3.2.1.1,  3.4.1.1) have been linked to phenological 
shifts, and changes in distribution, denning, foraging behaviour and 
survival rates of polar bears (Ursus maritimus) (Andersen et al., 2012; 
Hamilton et al., 2017; Escajeda et al., 2018) (high conﬁdence). Less 
ice is also driving polar bears to travel over greater distances and 
swim more than previously both in offshore and in coastal areas, 
which can be particularly dangerous for young cubs (Durner et al., 
2017; Pilfold et al., 2017; Lone et al., 2018). Cumulatively, changes 
in sea ice patterns are driving demographic changes in polar bears, 
including declines in some populations (Lunn et al., 2016; McCall 
et al., 2016), while others are stable or increasing (Voorhees et al., 
2014; Aars et al., 2017). This is because protective management 
measures have been successful in allowing severely depleted 
populations to recover or because new food sources, such as carrion, 
are becoming available to polar bears in some regions (Galicia et al., 
2016; Stapleton et al., 2016). Changes in the spatial distribution of 
polar bears and killer whales can have top-down effects on other 
marine mammal prey populations (Øigård et al., 2014; Breed et al., 
2017; Smith et al., 2017a). 
Several studies from different parts of the Arctic show evidence 
that changing temperatures impact seabird diets (Dorresteijn et al., 
2012; Divoky et al., 2015; Vihtakari et al., 2018), reproductive success 
and body condition (Gaston et al., 2012; Provencher et al., 2012; 
Gaston and Elliott, 2014) (high conﬁdence). Recent studies also 
show that changes in sea surface temperature and sea ice dynamics 
have impacts on the distribution and abundance of seabird prey 
with cascading impacts on seabird community composition (Gall 
et al., 2017), nutritional stress and decreased reproductive output 
(Dorresteijn et al., 2012; Divoky et al.; Kokubun et al., 2018) and 
survival (Renner et al., 2016; Hunt et al., 2018).
3.2.3.2 
Southern Ocean
Marine ecosystem dynamics in the Antarctic region are dominated by 
the ACC and its frontal systems (Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 3), 
subpolar gyres, polar seasonality, the annual advance and retreat of 
sea ice (Section 3.2.1.1) and the supply of limiting micronutrients 
for productivity (most commonly iron) (Section  5.2.2.5). Antarctic 
krill (Euphausia superba) play a  central role in Southern Ocean 
foodwebs as grazers and as prey items for ﬁsh, squid, marine 
mammals and seabirds (Schmidt and Atkinson, 2016; Trathan and 
Hill, 2016) (SM3.2.6). This is due in part to the high abundance and 
circumpolar distribution of Antarctic krill, although the abundance 
and importance of this species varies between different regions of 
the Southern Ocean (Larsen et al., 2014; Siegel, 2016; McCormack 
et al., 2017). Recent work has characterised the nature of habitat 
change for Southern Ocean biota at regional and circumpolar 
scales (Constable et al., 2014; Gutt et al., 2015; Constable et al., 
2016; Hunt et al., 2016; Gutt et al., 2018), and the direct responses 
of biota to these changes (Constable et al., 2014) (summarised in 
Figure  3.6). These ﬁndings indicate that overlapping changes in 
key ocean and sea ice habitat characteristics (temperature, sea ice 
cover, iceberg scour, mixed layer depth, aragonite undersaturation; 
Sections  3.2.1,  3.2.2) will be important in determining future 
states of Southern Ocean ecosystems (Constable et al., 2014; Gutt 
et al., 2015) (medium conﬁdence). However, there is a need to better 
characterise the nature and importance of indirect responses to 
physical change using models and observations. Important advances 
have also been made since AR5 in (i) identifying key variables to 
detect and attribute change in Southern Ocean ecosystems, as part 
of long-term circumpolar modelling designs (Constable et al., 2016), 
and (ii) reﬁning methods for using sea ice projections from global 
climate models in ecological studies and ecosystem models for the 
Southern Ocean (Cavanagh et al., 2017).
3.2.3.2.1 Plankton and pelagic primary production
Changes in column-integrated phytoplankton biomass for the 
Southern Ocean are coupled with changes in the spatial extent of 
ice-free waters, suggesting little overall change in biomass per area 
at the circumpolar scale (Behrenfeld et al., 2016). Arrigo et al. (2008) 
also report no overall trend in remotely-sensed column-integrated 
primary production south of 50ºS from 1998 to 2006. At a regional 
scale, local-scale forcings (e.g.,  retreating glaciers, topographically 
steered circulation and sea ice duration) and associated changes in 
stratiﬁcation are key determinants of phytoplankton bloom dynamics 
at coastal stations on the West Antarctic Peninsula (Venables et al., 
2013; Schoﬁeld et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2018; Schoﬁeld et al., 2018) 
(medium conﬁdence). For example, a  shallowing trend in mixed 
layer depth in the southern part of the Peninsula (as opposed to no 
trend in the north) associated with changes in sea ice duration over 
a 24-year period (from 1993 to 2017) has been linked to enhanced 
phytoplankton productivity (Schoﬁeld et al., 2018). The phenology 
of Southern Ocean phytoplankton blooms in this region may also 
be shifting to earlier in the growth season (Arrigo et al., 2017a). 
However, the effect of climate change on Southern Ocean pelagic 
primary production is difﬁcult to determine given that the length 
of time series data is insufﬁcient (less than 30 years) to enable the 
climate change signature to be detected and attributed; and that, 
even when records are of sufﬁcient length, data trends are often 
reported as being driven by climate change when they are due to 
a combination of climate change andvariability.
Recent studies on the ecological effects of acidiﬁcation in coastal 
waters near the Antarctic continent indicate a detrimental effect of 
acidiﬁcation on primary production and changes to the structure 
and function of microbial communities (Hancock et al., 2017; 
Deppeler et al., 2018; Westwood et al., 2018) (medium conﬁdence). 
Trimborn et al. (2017) report that Southern Ocean diatoms are more 
sensitive to ocean acidiﬁcation and changes in irradiance than the 
prymnesiophyte Phaeocystis antarctica, which may have implications 
for biogeochemical cycling because diatoms and prymnesiophytes 
are generally considered key drivers of these cycles. Both laboratory 
manipulations and in situ experiments indicate that sea ice algae are 
tolerant to acidiﬁcation (McMinn, 2017) (medium conﬁdence). Model 
projections of trends in primary production in the Southern Ocean 
due to climate change from Leung et al. (2015) are summarised in 
Table 3.2.

supply in the Southern Ocean (Hutchins and Boyd, 2016). Acidiﬁcation was not reported as an important driver in this modelling experiment.

Previously reported declines in Antarctic krill abundance in the South 
Atlantic Sector (Atkinson et al., 2004) cited in WGII AR5 (Larsen et 
al., 2014) may not represent a long-term, climate driven, regional-
scale decline (Fielding et al., 2014; Kinzey et al., 2015; Steinberg et 
al., 2015; Cox et al., 2018) (medium conﬁdence) but could reﬂect 
a  sudden, discontinuous change following an episodic period of 
anomalous peak abundance for this species (Loeb and Santora, 2015) 
(low conﬁdence). Recent analyses have not detected trends in long-
term krill abundance in the South Atlantic Sector in acoustic surveys 
(Fielding et al., 2014; Kinzey et al., 2015), net-based surveys (Steinberg 
et al., 2015) or reanalysis of historical data (Cox et al., 2018). 
Nevertheless, the spatial distribution and size composition of Antarctic 
krill may already have changed in association with change in the sea 
ice environment (Atkinson et al., 2019) (medium conﬁdence) and may 
result in different regional trends in numerical krill abundance (Cox et 
al., 2018; Atkinson et al., 2019) (medium conﬁdence). 
The distribution of Antarctic krill is expected to change under 
future climate change because of changes in the location of the 
optimum conditions for growth and recruitment (Melbourne-Thomas 
et al., 2016; Piñones and Fedorov, 2016; Meyer et al., 2017; Murphy 
et al., 2017; Klein et al., 2018). The optimum conditions for krill are 
predicted to move southwards, with the decreases most apparent 
in the areas with the most rapid warming (Hill et al., 2013; Piñones 
and Fedorov, 2016) (Section  3.2.1.2.1) (medium conﬁdence). The 
greatest projected reductions in krill due to the effects of warming 
and ocean acidiﬁcation are predicted for the southwest Atlantic/
Weddell Sea region (Kawaguchi et al., 2013; Piñones and Fedorov, 
2016) (low conﬁdence), which is the area of highest current krill 
concentrations, contains important foraging grounds for krill 
predators, and is also the main area of operation of the krill ﬁshery. 
Modelled effects of warming on krill growth in the Scotia Sea and 
northern Antarctic Peninsula (AP) region resulted in reductions in 
total krill biomass under both RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 (Klein et al., 2018). 
Projections from a food web model for the West Antarctic Peninsula 
under simple scenarios for change in open water and sea ice-
associated primary production from 2010 to 2050 (6, 15, and 41% 
increases in phytoplankton production with equivalent percentage 
decreases in ice algal production) indicate a decline in krill biomass 
with contemporaneous increases in the biomass of gelatinous salps 
(Suprenand and Ainsworth, 2017).
Current understanding of climate change effects on Southern Ocean 
zooplankton is largely based on observations and predictions from 
the South Atlantic and the West Antarctic Peninsula. Comparison of 
the mesozooplankton community in the southwestern Atlantic Sector 
between 1926–1938 and 1996–2013 showed no evidence of change 
despite surface ocean warming (Tarling et al., 2018). These results 
suggest that predictions of distributional shifts based on temperature 
niches may not reﬂect the actual levels of thermal resilience of 
key taxa. Sub-decadal cycles of macrozooplankton community 
composition adjacent to the West Antarctic Peninsula are strongly 
linked to climate indices, with evidence of increasing abundance for 
some species over the period from 1993 to 2013 (Steinberg et al., 
2015). Pteropods are vulnerable to the effects of acidiﬁcation, and 
new evidence indicates that eggs released at high CO2 concentrations 
lack resilience to ocean acidiﬁcation in the Scotia Sea region (Manno 
et al., 2016) (medium conﬁdence).
3.2.3.2.2 Benthic communities
Carbon uptake and storage by Antarctic benthic communities is 
predicted to increase with sea ice losses, because across-shelf growth 
gains from longer algal blooms outweigh ice scour mortality in the 
shallows (Barnes, 2017). Bentho-pelagic coupling and vertical energy 
ﬂux will also inﬂuence Southern Ocean ecosystem responses to climate 
change (Jansen et al., 2017). Benthic communities in shallow water 
habitats mostly consist of dark-adapted invertebrates and rely on sea 
ice to create low-light marine environments. Increases in the amount 
of light reaching the shallow seabed under climate change may 
result in ecological regime shifts, in which invertebrate-dominated 
communities are replaced by macroalgal beds (Clark et al., 2015; 
Clark et al., 2017) (low conﬁdence) (Table 6.1). Grifﬁths et al. (2017a) 
modelled distribution changes for 963 benthic invertebrate species 
in the Southern Ocean under RCP8.5 for 2099. Their results suggest 
that 79% of Antarctica’s endemic species will face a reduction in 
suitable temperature habitat (an average 12% reduction) over the 
current century. Predicted reductions in the number of species are 
most pronounced for the West Antarctic Peninsula and the Scotia Sea 
region (Grifﬁths et al., 2017a).
3.2.3.2.3 Fish
Many Antarctic ﬁsh have a  narrow thermal tolerance as a  result 
of physiological adaptations to cold water (Pörtner et al., 2014; 
Mintenbeck, 2017), which makes them vulnerable to the effects 
of increasing temperatures (Mueller et al., 2012; Beers and 
Jayasundara, 2015). Increasing water temperatures may displace 
232

iceﬁsh (family Channichthyidae) in marginal habitats (e.g., shallow 
regions around subantarctic islands) as they lack haemoglobin and 
are unable to adjust blood parameters to an increasing oxygen 
demand (Mintenbeck et al., 2012) (low conﬁdence). Future warming 
may also reduce the planktonic duration and increase egg and 
larval mortality for ﬁsh species, which is predicted to affect dispersal 
patterns, with implications for population connectivity and the ability 
of ﬁsh species to adapt to ongoing environmental change (Young 
et al., 2018). The Antarctic silverﬁsh (Pleuragramma antarctica) is 
an important prey species in some regions of the Southern Ocean, 
and has an ice-dependent life cycle (Mintenbeck et al., 2012; Vacchi 
et al., 2012). Documented declines in the abundance of this species in 
some parts of the West Antarctic Peninsula may have consequences 
for associated food webs (Parker et al., 2015; Mintenbeck and Torres, 
2017) (low conﬁdence).
Myctophids and toothﬁsh are important ﬁsh groups from both 
a food web (myctophids) and ﬁshery (toothﬁsh) perspective. Species 
distribution models for Electrona antarctica, a dominant myctophid 
species in the Southern Ocean, project habitat loss for this species 
under RCP4.5 (6.2 ± 6.0% loss) and RCP8.5 (13.1 ± 10.2% loss) by 
2090, associated with increased sea surface temperature (Freer et al., 
2018). There have been no observed effects of climate change on 
the two species of toothﬁsh that are found in the Southern Ocean: 
Patagonian and Antarctic toothﬁsh (Dissostichus eleginoides and D. 
mawsoni), but recruitment is inversely correlated with sea surface 
temperature for Patagonian toothﬁsh at South Georgia (Belchier 
and Collins, 2008). Given differences in temperature tolerances 
for Patagonian toothﬁsh (with a wide temperature tolerance) and 
Antarctic toothﬁsh (limited by a low tolerance for water temperatures 
above 2ºC), the latter may be faced with reduced habitat and 
potential competition with southward-moving Patagonian toothﬁsh 
under climate change (Mintenbeck, 2017) (very low conﬁdence).
3.2.3.2.4 Seabirds and marine mammals
Since AR5, there has been an increasing body of evidence of 
climate-induced changes in populations of some Antarctic 
higher predators such as seabirds and marine mammals. These 
changes vary between different regions of the Southern Ocean 
and reﬂect differences in key drivers (Bost et al., 2009; Gutt et al., 
2015; Constable et al., 2016; Hunt et al., 2016; Gutt et al., 2018), 
particularly sea ice extent and food availability (high conﬁdence) 
across regions (Sections  3.2.1.1.1,  5.2.3.1,  5.2.3.2,  5.2.4). The 
predictability of foraging grounds and ice cover are associated with 
variations in climate (Dugger et al., 2014; Youngﬂesh et al., 2017; 
Abrahms et al., 2018) (Section 3.2.1.1) and are the main drivers of 
observed population changes of Southern Ocean higher predators 
(high conﬁdence) (Descamps et al., 2015; Jenouvrier et al., 2015; 
Sydeman et al., 2015; Abadi et al., 2017; Bjorndal et al., 2017; 
Fluhr et al., 2017; Hinke et al., 2017a; Hinke et al., 2017b; Pardo 
et al., 2017). The suitability of breeding habitats and the location of 
environmental features that facilitate the aggregation of prey are also 
inﬂuenced by climate change, and in turn inﬂuence the distribution 
in space and time of marine mammals and birds (Bost et al., 2015; 
Kavanaugh et al., 2015; Hindell et al., 2016; Santora et al., 2017) 
(medium conﬁdence). Finally, biological parameters (reproductive 
success, mortality, fecundity and body condition), life history traits, 
morphological, physiological and behavioural characteristics of 
top predators in the Southern Ocean, as well as their patterns of 
activity (migration, distribution, foraging and reproduction) are also 
changing as a result of climate change (Braithwaite et al., 2015a; 
Whitehead et al., 2015; Seyboth et al., 2016; Hinke et al., 2017b) 
(high conﬁdence).
Trends of populations of Antarctic penguins affected by climate 
change include both increases for gentoo penguins, (Pygoscelis 
papua) (Lynch et al., 2013; Dunn et al., 2016; Hinke et al., 2017a), 
and decreases for Adélie (P. adeliae), chinstrap (P. antarctica), king 
(Aptenodytes patagonicus) and Emperor (A. forsteri) penguins 
(Trivelpiece et al., 2011; LaRue et al., 2013; Jenouvrier et al., 2014; 
Bost et al., 2015; Southwell et al., 2015; Younger et al., 2015; Cimino 
et al., 2016) (high conﬁdence). Yet population shifts in Adélie 
penguins (Youngﬂesh et al., 2017) may have resulted from strong 
interannual environmental variability in good and bad years for prey 
and breeding habitat rather than climate change (low conﬁdence). 
New evidence suggests that present Emperor penguin population 
estimates should be evaluated with caution based on the existence of 
breeding colonies yet to be discovered/conﬁrmed (Ancel et al., 2017) 
as well as studies that draw conclusions based on trend estimates 
from single colonies (Kooyman and Ponganis, 2017).
Evidence for climate change impacts on Antarctic ﬂying birds 
indicates that contraction of sea ice (seasonally and in speciﬁc 
regions), increases in sea surface temperatures, extreme events 
(snowstorms) and wind regime shifts can reduce breeding success 
and population growth rates in some species: southern fulmars 
(Fulmarus glacialoides), Antarctic petrels (Thalassoica antarctica) 
and 
black-browed 
albatrosses 
(Thalassarche 
melanophris) 
(Descamps et al., 2015; Jenouvrier et al., 2015; Pardo et al., 2017) 
(low conﬁdence). Poleward population shifts with increased intensity 
and frequency of westerly winds affect functional traits, demographic 
rates, foraging range, rates of travel and ﬂight speeds of ﬂying birds 
(Weimerskirch et al., 2012; Jenouvrier et al., 2018) but also increase 
overlap with ﬁsheries activities thus increasing the risk of bycatch 
and the need for mitigation measures (Krüger et al., 2018) (medium 
conﬁdence).
Changes in local- and regional-scale oceanographic features 
(Section 3.2.1.2) together with bathymetry control prey aggregation 
and distribution, and affect the ecological responses and biological 
traits of higher predators (particularly marine mammals) in the 
Southern Ocean (Lyver et al., 2014; Bost et al., 2015; Jenouvrier et al., 
2015; Whitehead et al., 2015; Cimino et al., 2016; Hinke et al., 2017a; 
Pardo et al., 2017) (medium conﬁdence) and likely explain most of 
the observed population shifts (Kavanaugh et al., 2015; Hindell et al., 
2016; Gurarie et al., 2017; Santora et al., 2017). Decadal climate 
cycles affect access to mesopelagic prey by southern elephant seals 
(Mirounga leonina) in the Indian Sector of the Southern Ocean and 
breeding females are excluded from highly productive continental 
shelf waters in years of increased sea ice extent and duration (Hindell 
et al., 2016) (medium conﬁdence). To date there is no uniﬁed global 
estimate of the abundance of Antarctic pack ice seal species (Ross 
seals (Ommatophoca rossi), crabeater seals (Lobodon carcinophaga), 
233

leopard seals (Hydrurga leptonyx) and Weddell seals (Leptonychotes 
weddellii)) as a reference point for understanding climate change 
impacts on these species (Southwell et al., 2012; Bester et al., 2017), 
although some regional population estimates for pack ice seals 
are available (Gurarie et al., 2017 and references therein). Analysis 
of long-term data suggests a genetic component to adaptation to 
climate change (low conﬁdence) in Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus 
gazella, Forcada and Hoffman (2014)) and pigmy blue whales 
(Balaenoptera musculus brevicauda, Attard et al. (2015)).
Population trends of migratory baleen whales have been associated 
with krill abundance in the Atlantic and Paciﬁc sectors of the 
Southern Ocean which is reﬂected in increased reproductive success, 
body condition and energy allocation (milk availability and transfer) 
to calves (Braithwaite et al., 2015a; Braithwaite et al., 2015b; 
Seyboth et al., 2016) (high conﬁdence). There have been predictions 
of negative future impacts of climate change on krill and all whale 
species, although the magnitude of impacts differs among populations 
(Tulloch et al., 2019) as for other higher predators (Section 5.2.3). 
Paciﬁc blue (Tulloch et al., 2019) (Balaenoptera musculus), ﬁn  
(B. physalus) and southern right whales (Eubalaena australis) are the 
most at risk but humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) are also 
at risk, as consequence of reduced prey and increasing interspeciﬁc 
competition. Importantly, climate-related risks for whale populations 
are a product of environmental conditions and connectivity between 
whale foraging grounds (Southern Ocean) and breeding grounds 
(lower latitudes) (Section 5.2.3.1).
3.2.3.2.5 Pelagic foodwebs and ecosystem structure
This section assesses the impacts of ocean and sea ice changes on 
pelagic foodwebs and ecosystem structure. The ecological impacts of 
loss of ice shelves and retreat of coastal glaciers around Antarctica 
are assessed in Section 3.3.3.4. Recent syntheses of Southern Ocean 
ecosystem structure and function recognise the importance of at least 
two dominant energy pathways in pelagic foodwebs – a short trophic 
pathway transferring primary production to top predators via krill, and at 
least one other pathway that moves energy from smaller phytoplankton 
to top predators via copepods and small mesopelagic ﬁshes – and 
indicate that the relative importance of these pathways will change 
under climate change (Murphy et al., 2013; Constable et al., 2016; 
Constable et al., 2017; McCormack et al., 2017) (medium conﬁdence). 
Using an ecosystem model, Klein et al. (2018) found that the effects 
of warming on krill growth off the AP and in the Scotia Sea translated 
to increased risks of declines in krill predator populations, particularly 
penguins, under both RCP2.6 and RCP8.5. The relative importance of 
different energy pathways in Southern Ocean foodwebs has important 
implications for resource management, in particular the management 
of krill and toothﬁsh ﬁsheries by the Commission for the Conservation 
of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) (Constable et al., 2016; 
Constable et al., 2017) (Sections 3.2.4.1.2, 3.5.3.2.2). 
In summary, advances in knowledge regarding the impacts of climate 
change on Antarctic marine ecosystems since AR5 are consistent 
with the impacts described in Larsen et al. (2014) (also summarised 
in Figure  3.6). These advances include further descriptions of 
local-scale, climate-related inﬂuences (sea ice and stratiﬁcation)

on primary productivity, particularly in the West Antarctic Peninsula 
region (Section 3.2.3.2.1) (medium conﬁdence). At the circumpolar 
scale, primary production is projected to increase in regions south 
of 65ºS over the period from now to 2100 under RCP8.5 (Leung 
et al., 2015) (low conﬁdence). However, ocean acidiﬁcation may have 
a detrimental effect on coastal phytoplankton communities around 
the Antarctic continent (Section  3.2.3.2.1) (medium conﬁdence). 
Increased information is also available regarding climate-driven 
changes in Antarctic krill populations in the south Atlantic, including 
the observed southward shift in the spatial distribution of krill in this 
region (Atkinson et al., 2019) (medium conﬁdence) but evidence of 
a long-term trend in overall abundance in the region is equivocal 
(Section 3.2.3.2.1). Further habitat contraction for Antarctic krill is 
predicted in the future (medium conﬁdence) (references detailed in 
Section 3.2.3.2.1). Under high emissions scenarios the majority of 
Antarctic seaﬂoor species are projected to be negatively impacted 
by the end of the century (Grifﬁths et al., 2017a) (low conﬁdence). 
Observed changes in the geography of ice-associated habitats 
(sea ice, ice shelves and polynyas) have both positive and negative 
effects on seabirds and marine mammals, and will interact with 
ice dependent changes in Antarctic krill populations to compound 
the impacts on krill dependent predators (Klein et al., 2018) 
(Sections 3.2.3.2.1, 3.2.3.2.4) (medium conﬁdence).
3.2.4 
Impacts on Social-Ecological Systems
3.2.4.1 
Fisheries
3.2.4.1.1 Arctic
Arctic ﬁsheries are important economically and societally. Large 
commercial ﬁsheries exist off the coasts of Greenland and in the 
Barents and Bering Seas (Holsman et al., 2018; Peck and Pinnegar, 
2018). First-wholesale value for commercial harvest of all species in 
2017 in the Eastern Bering Sea was 2.68 billion USD, and for the 
Barents Sea around 1 billion USD to Norwegian ﬁshers alone. The 
target species for these commercial ﬁsheries include gadoids, ﬂatﬁsh, 
herring, red ﬁsh (Sebastes sp.), salmonids, and capelin. Fisheries in 
other Arctic regions are relatively small-scale, locally operated, and 
target a limited number of species (Reist, 2018). Still, these ﬁsheries 
are of considerable cultural, economic and subsistence importance to 
local communities (Section 3.5.2.1).
Climate change will affect the spatial distribution and productivity of 
some commercially important marine ﬁsh and shellﬁsh under most 
RCPs (Section 3.2.3.1) with associated impacts on the distribution 
and economic viability of commercial ﬁsheries (high conﬁdence). 
Past performance suggests that high latitude ﬁsheries have been 
resilient to changing environmental and market drivers. For example, 
the Norwegian cod ﬁshery has exported dried cod over an unbroken 
period of more than a thousand years (Barrett et al., 2011), reﬂecting 
the resilience of the northern Norwegian cod ﬁsheries to historic 
climate variability (Eide, 2017). Also, model projections indicate that 
expansions in suitable habitat for subarctic species and increased 
production of planktonic prey due to increasing temperatures and 
ice retreat, will continue to support commercially important ﬁsheries 
(Lam et al., 2016; Eide, 2017; Haug et al., 2017; Peck and Pinnegar, 
2018) (Section 3.2.3.1.3, Box 3.4) (medium conﬁdence).
However, recent studies in the Bering Sea suggest that future ﬁsh 
production will also depend on how climate change and ocean 
acidiﬁcation will alter the quality, quantity and availability of suitable 
prey; the thermal stress and metabolic demands of resident ﬁsh; and 
species interactions (Section 3.2.3.1.3), suggesting that the future 
of commercial ﬁsheries in Arctic regions is uncertain (Holsman 
et al., 2018). It is also uncertain whether future autumn and winter 
ocean conditions will be conducive to the establishment of resident 
overwintering spawning populations that are large enough to 
support sustainable commercial ﬁshing operations at higher latitude 
Arctic shelf regions (Section 3.2.3.1) (medium conﬁdence).
Projecting the impacts of climate change on marine ﬁsheries is 
inextricably intertwined with response scenarios regarding risk 
tolerance in future management of marine resources, advancements 
in ﬁsh capture technology, and markets drivers (e.g., local and global 
demand, emerging product lines, competition, processing efﬁciencies 
and energy costs) (Groeneveld et al., 2018). Seasonal and interannual 
variability in ocean conditions inﬂuences product quality and costs 
of ﬁsh capture (Haynie and Pfeiffer, 2012) (Table 3.4). Further, past 
experience suggests that barriers to diversiﬁcation may limit the 
portfolio of viable target ﬁsheries available to small-scale ﬁsheries 
(Ward et al., 2017) (low conﬁdence).
3.2.4.1.2 Southern Ocean
This section examines climate change impacts on Southern Ocean 
ﬁsheries for Antarctic krill and ﬁnﬁsh. Management of these ﬁsheries 
by CCAMLR and responses to climate change are discussed in 
Section 3.5.2.1. The main Antarctic ﬁsheries are for Antarctic krill, and 
for Antarctic and Patagonian toothﬁsh; in 2016 the reported catches 
for these species were approximately 260 thousand tons for krill 
(CCAMLR, 2017b) and 11 thousand tons for Antarctic and Patagonian 
toothﬁsh combined (CCAMLR, 2017a). The mean annual wholesale 
value of the Antarctic krill ﬁshery was 69.5 USD million yr–1 for the 
period from 2011 to 2015, and 206.7 million USD yr–1 for toothﬁsh 
ﬁsheries (combined) over the same period (CCAMLR, 2016b). The 
ﬁshery for Antarctic krill in the southern Atlantic Sector and the 
northern West Antarctic Peninsula (together the current area of 
focus for the ﬁshery) has become increasingly concentrated in space 
over recent decades, which has raised concern regarding localised 
impacts on krill predators (Hinke et al., 2017a). The krill ﬁshery has 
also changed its peak season of operation. In the early years of the 
ﬁshery, most krill were taken in summer and autumn, with lowest 
catches being taken in spring. In recent years the lowest catches have 
occurred over summer, catches have peaked in late autumn, and very 
little ﬁshing activity has occurred in spring (Nicol and Foster, 2016). 
Some of these temporal and spatial shifts in the ﬁshery over time have 
been attributed to reductions in winter sea ice extent in the region 
(Kawaguchi et al., 2009) (low conﬁdence). Recent increases in the 
use of krill catch to produce krill oil (as a human health supplement) 
has also led to vessels concentrating on ﬁshing in autumn and winter 
when krill are richest in lipids (Nicol and Foster, 2016). Available 
evidence regarding future changes to Antarctic krill populations 
235
Polar Regions 
Chapter 3

(Section 3.2.3.2.1) indicates that the impacts of climate change will 
be most pronounced in the areas that are currently most important 
for the Antarctic krill ﬁshery: the Scotia Sea and the northern tip of 
the AP. Major future changes in the krill ﬁshery itself are expected to 
be driven by global issues external to the Southern Ocean, including 
conservation decision making and socioeconomic drivers.
There is limited understanding of the consequences of climate change 
for Southern Ocean ﬁnﬁsh ﬁsheries. Lack of recovery of mackerel 
iceﬁsh (Champsocephalus gunnari) after cessation of ﬁshing in 1995 
has been related to anomalous water temperatures (~2ºC increase 
related to a strong El Niño) in the subantarctic Indian Ocean and 
to availability of krill prey in the Atlantic region (Mintenbeck, 2017) 
(low conﬁdence). Differences in temperature tolerance of Patagonian 
and Antarctic toothﬁsh described in Section  3.2.3.2.3 may have 
implications for future ﬁsheries of these two species.
3.2.4.2 
Tourism
Reductions in sea ice have facilitated an increase in marine and 
cruise tourism opportunities across the Arctic related to an increase 
in accessibility (Dawson et al., 2014; Johnston et al., 2017) (high 
conﬁdence). While not exclusively ‘polar’, Alaska attracts the highest 
number of cruise passengers annually at just over one million; 
Svalbard attracts 40,000–50,000; Greenland 20,000–30,000; and 
Arctic Canada  3,500–5,000 (Johnston et al., 2017). Compared to 
a decade ago, there are more cruises on offer, ships travel further 
in a single season, larger vessels with more passenger berths are 
in operation, more purpose-built polar cruise vessels are being 
constructed, and private pleasure craft are appearing in the Arctic 
more frequently (Lasserre and Têtu, 2015; Johnston et al., 2017; 
Dawson et al., 2018). In Antarctica, almost 37,000 (predominantly 
shipborne) tourists visited in 2016–2017, with 51,707 during 
2017–2018; there were 6700 tourists in 1992–1993 (the ﬁrst year 
of record) (ATCM, 2018). Due to accessibility and convenience, these 
tourism operations are mostly based around the few ice-free areas of 
Antarctica, concentrated on the AP (Pertierra et al., 2017).
Canada’s Northwest Passage (southern route), which only saw 
occasional cruise ship transits in the early 2000s is now reliably 
accessible during the summer cruising season, and as a result has 
experienced a doubling and quadrupling of cruise and pleasure craft 
activity over the past decade (Johnston et al., 2017; Dawson et al., 
2018). There is high conﬁdence that demand for Arctic cruise tourism 
will continue to grow over the coming decade (Johnston et al., 2017). 
The anticipated implications of future climate change have become 
a  driver for polar tourism. A  niche market known as ‘last chance 
tourism’ has emerged whereby tourists explicitly seek to experience 
vanishing landscapes or seascapes, and natural and social heritage in 
the Arctic and Antarctic, before they disappear (Lemelin et al., 2010; 
Lamers et al., 2013).
Increases in polar cruise tourism pose risks and opportunities related 
to development, education, safety (including search and rescue), 
security within communities and environmental sustainability 
(Johnston et al., 2012a; Johnston et al., 2012b; Stewart et al., 
2013; Dawson et al., 2014; Lasserre and Têtu, 2015; Stewart et al., 
2015). In the Arctic, there are also risks and opportunities related 
to employment, health and well-being, and the commodiﬁcation 
of culture (Stewart et al., 2013; Stewart et al., 2015). There is high 
conﬁdence that biodiversity supported by ice-free areas, particularly 
those on the AP, are vulnerable to the introduction of terrestrial 
alien species via tourists and scientists (Chown et al., 2012; Huiskes 
et al., 2014; Hughes et al., 2015; Duffy et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2017a) 
(Box 3.3) as well as to the direct impacts of humans (Pertierra et al., 
2017). The tourism sector relies on a set of regulations that apply to 
all types of maritime shipping, yet cruise ships intentionally travel off 
regular shipping corridors and serve a very different purpose than 
other vessel types, so there is a need for region-speciﬁc governance 
regimes, specialised infrastructure, and focused policy attention 
(Dawson et al., 2014; Pashkevich et al., 2015; Pizzolato et al., 
2016; Johnston et al., 2017). Private pleasure craft remain almost 
completely unregulated, and will pose unique risks in the future 
(Johnston et al., 2017).
3.2.4.3 
Transportation
The Arctic is reliant on marine transportation for the import of 
food, fuel and other goods. At the same time, the global appetite 
for maritime trade and commerce through the Arctic (including 
community re-supply, mining and resource development, tourism, 
ﬁsheries, cargo, research, and military and icebreaking, etc.) is 
increasing as the region becomes more accessible because of reduced 
sea ice cover. There are four potential Arctic international trade routes: 
the Northwest Passage, the Northern Sea Route, the Arctic Bridge and 
the Transpolar Sea Route. All of these routes offer signiﬁcant trade 
beneﬁts because they provide substantial distance savings compared 
to traditional routes via the Suez or Panama Canals.
There is high conﬁdence that shipping activity during the Arctic 
summer increased over the past two decades in regions for which 
there is information, concurrent with reductions in Arctic sea ice 
extent and the shift to predominantly seasonal ice cover (Pizzolato 
et al., 2014; Eguíluz et al., 2016; Pizzolato et al., 2016). Long term 
datasets over the pan-Arctic are incomplete, but the distance 
travelled by ships in Arctic Canada nearly tripled between 1990 
and 2015 (from ~365,000 to ~920,000 km) (Dawson et al., 2018). 
Other non-environmental factors which inﬂuence Arctic shipping 
are natural resource development, regional trade, geopolitics, 
commodity prices, global economic and social trends, national 
priorities, tourism demand, ship building technologies and insurance 
costs (Lasserre and Pelletier, 2011; Têtu et al., 2015; Johnston et al., 
2017). Current impacts associated with the observed increase in 
Arctic shipping include a higher rate of reported accidents per km 
travelled compared to southern waters (CCA, 2016), increases in 
vessel noise propagation (Halliday et al., 2017) and air pollution 
(Marelle et al., 2016). Disruptions to cultural and subsistence 
hunting activities from increased shipping (Huntington et al., 2015; 
Olsen et al., 2019) compound climate-related impacts to people 
(Sections 3.4.3.3.2, 3.4.3.3.3). 
It is projected that shipping activity will continue to rise across the 
Arctic as northern routes become increasingly accessible (Stephenson 
et al., 2011; Stephenson et al., 2013; Barnhart et al., 2015; Melia et al., 
236
Chapter 3 
Polar Regions
3
2016), although mitigating economic and operational factors remain 
uncertain and could inﬂuence future trafﬁc volume (Zhang et al., 
2016). The Northern Sea Route is expected to be more viable than 
other routes because of infrastructure already in place (Milaković et al., 
2018); favourable summer ice conditions in recent years have reduced 
transit times (Aksenov et al., 2017). In comparison, the Northwest 
Passage and Arctic Bridge presently have limited port and marine 
transportation infrastructure, incomplete soundings and hydrographic 
charting, challenging sea ice conditions and limited search and rescue 
capacity; these compound the risks from shipping activity (Stephenson 
et al., 2013; Johnston et al., 2017; Andrews et al., 2018). 
Future shipping impacts will be regionally diverse considering the 
unique geographies, sea ice dynamics, infrastructure and service 
availability and regulatory regimes that exist across different 
Arctic nations. Considerations include socioeconomic and political 
implications related to safety (marine and local accidents), security 
(trafﬁcking, terrorism and local issues), and environmental and 
cultural sustainability (invasive species, release of biocides, 
chemicals and other waste, marine mammal strikes, fuel spills, air 
and underwater noise pollution and impacts to subsistence hunting) 
(Arctic Council, 2015a; Halliday et al., 2017; Hauser et al., 2018). 
Black carbon emissions from shipping activity within the Arctic are 
projected to increase (Arctic Council, 2017) and are more easily 
deposited at the surface in the region compared with emissions from 
lower latitudes (Sand et al., 2013). Commercial shipping mainly uses 
heavy fuel oil, with associated emissions of sulphur, nitrogen, metals, 
hydrocarbons, organic compounds, black carbon and ﬂy ash to the 
atmosphere during combustion (Turner et al., 2017a). Mitigation 
approaches include banning heavy fuel oil as already implemented 
in Antarctica and the waters around Svalbard, and the use of new 
technology like scrubbers.
The predominant shipborne activities in Antarctica are ﬁshing, 
logistic support to land-based stations, and marine research vessels 
operating for both non-governmental and governmental sectors. 
Uncertainty in future Antarctic sea ice conditions (Section 3.2.2.1) 
pose challenges to considering potential impacts on these activities 
(Chown, 2017).
3.3 
Polar Ice Sheets and Glaciers:  
Changes, Consequences and Impacts
3.3.1 
Ice Sheet Changes
Changes in ice sheet mass have been derived repeatedly over the 
satellite era using complementary methods based on time series of 
satellite altimetry to measure volume change, ice-ﬂux measurements 
combined with modelled surface mass balance (SMB) to calculate 
mass inputs and outputs, and satellite gravimetry to measure regional 
mass change. Ice sheet changes over earlier periods have also been 
reconstructed from ﬁrn/ice core and geological evidence (SM3.3.1).
3.3.1.1 
Antarctic Ice Sheet Mass Change
It is virtually certain that the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) and West 
Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) combined have cumulatively lost mass since 
widespread measurements began in 1992, and that the rate of loss has 
increased since around the year 2006 and continued post-AR5 (Martín-
Español et al., 2016; Zwally et al., 2017; Bamber et al., 2018; Gardner 
et al., 2018; The IMBIE Team, 2018; Rignot et al., 2019), extending 
and reinforcing previous ﬁndings (IPCC, 2013) (Figure 3.7, Table 3.3, 
SM3.3.1.1). From medium evidence, there is high agreement in the sign 
and medium agreement in the magnitude of both WAIS and AP mass 
change between the complementary satellite methods (Mémin et al., 
2015; The IMBIE Team, 2018).

WAIS mass loss and recent increases in loss were concentrated in the 
Amundsen Sea Embayment (ASE) (high conﬁdence) with increases 
particularly in the late 2000s (Mouginot et al., 2014), accounting 
for most of the –112 ± 10 Gt yr–1 WAIS loss from 2003 to 2013 
(Martín-Español et al., 2016). The ice sheet margins of nearby Getz 
Ice Shelf also lost mass rapidly  (–67 ±  27 Gt yr–1, 2008–2015) 
(Gardner et al., 2018). This region also experienced losses during 
previous warm periods (Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3).
On the AP, the Bellingshausen Sea ice sheet margin shifted from close 
to mass balance in the 2000s to rapid loss from 2009 (–56 ± 8 Gt yr–1 
from 2010 to 2014) (high conﬁdence) (Helm et al., 2014; McMillan 
et al., 2014b; Wouters et al., 2015; Hogg et al., 2017). This shift 
accompanied ongoing mass loss (high conﬁdence) from the smaller 
northeastern AP glaciers that fed the former Prince Gustav, Larsen 
A and B ice shelves, though now at a lower rate than immediately 
following shelf collapse in 1995 and 2002 (Seehaus et al., 2015; 
Wuite et al., 2015; Rott et al., 2018). Of 860 marine-terminating AP 
glaciers, 90% retreated from their 1940s positions (Cook et al., 2014), 
established in the early to mid-Holocene (Ó Cofaigh et al., 2014) 
(medium conﬁdence). Early 21st century combined AP glacier (Fieber 
et al., 2018) and ice sheet loss was around –30 Gt yr–1 (Table 3.3).
The East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS, covering 85% of the Antarctic 
Ice Sheet (AIS)) has remained close to balance, with large interannual 
variability and no clear mass trend over the satellite record (medium 
conﬁdence) (Table  3.3, Figure  3.7, SM3.3.1.2), and relatively 
large observation uncertainties (SM3.3.1) (Velicogna et al., 2014; 
Martin-Español et al., 2017; Bamber et al., 2018). SMB trends are 
particularly ambiguous, leading to disagreement between one 
altimetry and one ﬂux-based estimate of 136 ± 43 Gt yr–1 (spanning 
1992–2008) (Zwally et al., 2017), and –41 ± 8 Gt yr–1 (1979–2017) 
(Rignot et al., 2019), respectively. Both differ from the multi-method 
averages reported here (Table 3.3).
EAIS mass gains on the Siple Coast and Dronning Maud Land 
(e.g., 63 ± 6 Gt yr–1 from 2003 to 2013 (Velicogna et al., 2014)) 
contrast with Wilkes Land losses e.g., from –17 ± 4 Gt yr–1 from the 
Totten Glacier area, 2003–2013 (Velicogna et al., 2014) that drain 
a large area of deeply-grounded EAIS with potential for multi-metre 
sea level contributions (Zwally et al., 2017; Rignot et al., 2019). 
Limited palaeo ice sheet evidence suggests that this area has 
previously lost substantial mass in previous interglacials (medium 
conﬁdence) (Aitken et al., 2016; Wilson etal.,2018).
Overall, 2012–2016 Antarctic Ice Sheet mass losses were extremely 
likely greater than those from 2002 to 2011 and likely greater than 
from 1992 to 2001, and it is extremely likely that the negative 2012–
2016 Antarctic Ice Sheet mass balance was dominated by losses from 
WAIS (Table 3.3).
3.3.1.2 
Components of Antarctic Ice Sheet Mass Change
Antarctic Ice Sheet mass changes are dominated by changes in 
snowfall and glacier ﬂow. The WAIS and AP loss trends in recent 
decades are dominated by glacier ﬂow acceleration (also known as 
dynamic thinning) (very high conﬁdence) (Figure SM3.8). Dynamic 
thinning losses were –112 ± 12 Gt yr–1 for 2003–2013, largely from 
the Amundsen Sea Embayment  (Figure SM3.8) (Martín-Español 
et al., 2016), which contributed –102 ± 10 Gt yr–1 from 2003 to 2011 
(Sutterley et al., 2014). Total Amundsen Sea Embayment  ice discharge 
increased by 77% since the 1970s (Mouginot et al., 2014), primarily 
from acceleration of Pine Island Glacier that began around 1945, Smith, 
Pope and Kohler glaciers around 1980, and Thwaites Glacier around 
2000 (Mouginot et al., 2014; Konrad et al., 2017; Smith et al., 2017c). 
Dynamic thinning in the Amundsen Sea Embayment  and western AP 
accounted for 88% of the –36 ± 15 Gt yr–1 increase in Antarctic Ice 
Sheet mass loss from 2008 to 2015 (Gardner et al., 2018). Glacier 
acceleration of up to 25% also affected the Getz Ice Shelf margin from 
2007 to 2014 (Chuter et al., 2017).
Reduction or loss of ice shelf buttressing has dominated Antarctic Ice 
Sheet dynamic thinning (high conﬁdence). Ice shelves buttress 90% 
of Antarctic Ice Sheet outﬂow (Depoorter et al., 2013; Rignot et al., 
2014; Fürst et al., 2016; Reese et al., 2018), and ice shelf thinning 
increased in WAIS by 70% in the decade to 2012, averaged  8% 
thickness loss from 1994 to 2012 in the Amundsen Sea Embayment  
(Paolo et al., 2015), and explains the post-2009 onset of rapid dynamic 
thinning on the southern-AP Bellingshausen Sea coast (Wouters 
et al., 2015; Hogg et al., 2017; Martin-Español et al., 2017) (Figure 
SM3.8). Grounding line retreat, an indicator of thinning, has been 
observed with high conﬁdence (Rignot et al., 2014; Christie et al.,

2016; Hogg et al., 2017; Konrad et al., 2018; Roberts et al., 2018). From 
2010 to 2016, 22%, 3% and 10% of grounding lines in WAIS, EAIS and 
the AP respectively retreated at rates faster than 25 m yr−1 (the average 
pace since the Last Glacial Maximum; Konrad et al., 2018), with highest 
rates along the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Sea coasts, and around 
Totten Glacier, Wilkes Land, EAIS (Konrad et al., 2018), where dynamic 
thinning has occurred at least since 1979 (Roberts et al., 2018; Rignot 
et al., 2019). Ice shelf collapse has driven dynamic thinning in the 
northern AP over recent decades (high conﬁdence) (Seehaus et al., 
2015; Wuite et al., 2015; Friedl et al., 2018; Rott et al., 2018).
ASE ice shelf basal melting, grounding line retreat and dynamic 
thinning have varied with ocean forcing (medium conﬁdence) (Dutrieux 
et al., 2014; Paolo et al., 2015; Christianson et al., 2016; Jenkins et al., 
2018) but this variability is superimposed on sustained mass losses 
compatible with the onset of Marine Ice Sheet Instability (MISI) for 
several major glaciers (medium conﬁdence) (Favier et al., 2014; Joughin 
et al., 2014; Mouginot et al., 2014; Rignot et al., 2014; Christianson 
et al., 2016). Whether unstable WAIS retreat has begun or is imminent 
remains a critical uncertainty (Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3).
Mass gains due to increased snowfall have somewhat offset 
dynamic-thinning losses (high conﬁdence). On the AP, snowfall began 
to increase in the 1930s, accelerated in the 1990s (Thomas et al., 
2015; Goodwin et al., 2016), and now offsets sea-level rise by 6.2 
± 1.7 mm per century (Medley and Thomas, 2018). EAIS and WAIS 
snowfall increases offset 20th century sea-level rise by 7.7 ± 4.0 mm 
and 2.8 ± 1.7 mm respectively (Medley and Thomas, 2018) (medium 
conﬁdence). AIS snowfall increased by 4 ± 1 then 14 ± 1 Gt per 
decade over the 19th and 20th centuries, of which EAIS contributed 
10% (Thomas et al., 2017b). Longer records suggest either an AIS 
snowfall decrease over the last 1000 years (Thomas et al., 2017a) 
or a  statistically negligible change over the last 800 years (low 
conﬁdence) (Frezzotti et al., 2013).
Mass balance contributions from ice sheet basal melting were not 
described in AR5 (IPCC, 2013) and the sensitivity of the AIS subglacial 
hydrological system to climate change is poorly understood. Around 
half of the AIS bed melts (Siegert et al., 2017), producing ~65 Gt yr–1 
of water (Pattyn, 2010) (low conﬁdence), some of which refreezes (Bell, 
2008) and some accumulates in subglacial lakes with a total volume of 
10s of 1000s of km3 (Popov and Masolov, 2007; Lipenkov et al., 2016; 
Siegert, 2017). This system contributes fresh water and nutrients to the 
ocean (Section 3.3.3.3) (Fricker et al., 2007; Siegert et al., 2007; Carter 
and Fricker, 2012; Horgan et al., 2013; Le Brocq, 2013; Flament et al., 
2014; Siegert et al., 2016), and lubricates glacier sliding (e.g., Dow et al., 
2018b). Changes in the ice sheet thickness can redistribute subglacial 
water, affecting drainage pathways and ice ﬂow (Fricker et al., 2016), 
but hydrological observations areveryscarce.
3.3.1.3 
Greenland Ice Sheet Mass Change
The Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) experienced a marked shift to strongly 
negative mass balance between the early 1990s and mid–2000s 
(very high conﬁdence) (Shepherd et al., 2012; Schrama et al., 2014; 
Velicogna et al., 2014; van den Broeke et al., 2016; Bamber et al., 
2018; King et al., 2018; Sandberg Sørensen et al., 2018; WCRP, 2018). 
It is extremely likely that the 2002–2011 and 2012–2016 ice losses 
were greater than in the 1992–2001 period (Bamber et al., 2018) 
(Table 3.3, Figure 3.7, SM3.3.1.3). Greenland Ice Sheet mass balance 
is characterised by large interannual variability (e.g., van den Broeke 
et al., 2017) but from 2005 to 2016, Greenland Ice Sheet was the 
largest terrestrial contributor to global sea level rise (WCRP, 2018).
A geodetic reconstruction of past ice sheet elevations indicates 
a Greenland Ice Sheet mass change of –75.1 ± 29.4 Gt yr–1 from 1900 to 
1983, –73.8 ± 40.5 Gt yr–1 from 1983 to 2003, and –186.4 ± 18.9 Gt yr–1 
from 2003 to 2010, with the losses consistently concentrated along the 
northwest and southeast coasts, and more locally in the southwest and 
on the large west coast Jakobshavn Glacier, though intensifying and 
spreading to the remainder of the coastal ice sheet in the latest period 
(Kjeldsen et al., 2015). Palaeo evidence also suggests that the GIS has 
contributed substantially to sea level rise during past warm intervals 
(Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3).
3.3.1.4 
Components of Greenland Ice Sheet Mass Change
Ongoing GIS mass loss over recent years has resulted from 
a combined increase in dynamic thinning and a decrease in SMB. Of 
these, reduced SMB due to an increase in surface melting and runoff 
recently came to dominate (high conﬁdence) (Andersen et al., 2015; 
Fettweis et al., 2017; van den Broeke et al., 2017; King et al., 2018), 
accounting for 42% of losses for 2000–2005, 64% for 2005–2009 
and 68% for 2009–2012 (Enderlin et al., 2014) (Figure 3.7). 
The GIS was close to balance in the early years of the 1990s (Hanna 
et al., 2013; Khan et al., 2015), the interior above 2000 m altitude 
gained mass from 1961 to 1990 (Colgan et al., 2015) and both 
coastal and ice sheet sites experienced an increasing precipitation 
trend from 1890 to 2012 and 1890 to 2000 respectively (Mernild 
et al., 2015), but since the early 1990s multiple observations and 
modelling studies show strong warming and an increase in runoff 
(very high conﬁdence). High-altitude GIS sites NEEM and Summit 
warmed by, respectively, 2.7ºC ± 0.33ºC over the past 30 years (Orsi 
et al., 2017) and by 2.7ºC ± 0.3ºC from 1982 to 2011 (McGrath et al., 
2013), while satellite thermometry showed statistically signiﬁcant 
widespread surface warming over northern GIS from 2000 to 2012 
(Hall et al., 2013). The post-1990s period experienced the warmest 
GIS near-surface summer air temperatures of 1840–2010 (+1.1˚C) 
(statistically highly signiﬁcant) (Box, 2013), and ice core analysis 
found the 2000–2010 decade to be the warmest for around 2000 
years (Vinther et al., 2009; Masson-Delmotte et al., 2012), and 
possibly around 7000 years (Lecavalier et al., 2017). This signiﬁcant 
summer warming since the early 1990s increased GIS melt event 
duration (Mernild et al., 2017) and intensity to levels exceptional 
over at least 350 years (Trusel et al., 2018), and melt frequency to 
levels unprecedented for at least 470 years (Graeter et al., 2018). GIS 
melt intensity for 1994–2013 was two to ﬁvefold the pre-industrial 
intensity (medium conﬁdence) (Trusel et al., 2018). In response, GIS 
meltwater production and runoff increased (Hanna et al., 2012; Box, 
2013; Fettweis et al., 2013; Tedstone et al., 2015; van den Broeke 
et al., 2016; Fettweis et al., 2017), resulting in 1994–2013 runoff 
being 33% higher the 20th century mean and 50% higher than the 
18th century (Trusel et al., 2018), and 80% higher in a western-GIS 
239

marginal river catchment in 2003–2014 relative to 1976–2002 
(Ahlstrom et al., 2017).
Only around half of the 1960–2014 surface melt ran off, most of the 
rest being retained in ﬁrn and snow (Steger et al., 2017), particularly 
in recently observed ﬁrn aquifers in south and west Greenland 
(Humphrey et al., 2012; Forster et al., 2013; Munneke et al., 2014; 
Poinar et al., 2017) that cover up to 5% of GIS (Miège et al., 2016; 
Steger et al., 2017) and stored around one ﬁfth of the meltwater 
increase since the late 1990s (Noël et al., 2017) (medium conﬁdence). 
While potential aquifer storage is equivalent to about a quarter of 
annual GIS melt production (Koenig et al., 2014; van den Broeke et al., 
2016) and aquifers have spread to higher altitudes (Steger et al., 2017), 
their potential to buffer runoff has been reduced by ﬁrn densiﬁcation 
(Polashenski et al., 2014), diversion of water to the bed via crevasses 
(Poinar et al., 2017), and the formation of ice layers that prevent 
drainage and promote surface ponding on the ﬁrn (Charalampidis 
et al., 2016) (high conﬁdence). Such ponding lowers the ﬁrn albedo, 
promoting further melting (high conﬁdence) (e.g.,  Charalampidis 
et al., 2015), but the extent of bare ice is a ﬁvefold stronger control 
on melt (Ryan et al., 2019). Bare ice produced ~78% of runoff from 
1960 to 2014, and its extent is expected to increase non-linearly as 
snow cover retreats to higher, ﬂatter areas of ice sheet (Steger et al., 
2017). This extent is not well reproduced in climate models, however, 
with biases of –6% to 13% (Ryan et al., 2019).
The remaining ~40% of non-SMB GIS mass loss from 1991 to 2015 
has resulted from increased ice discharge due to dynamic thinning 
(high conﬁdence) (Enderlin et al., 2014; van den Broeke et al., 2016; 
King et al., 2018) (Figure 3.7). From 2000 to 2016, dynamic thinning of 
89% of GIS outlet glaciers accounted for –682 ± 31 Gt mass change, 
of which 92% came from the northwest and southeast GIS (King 
et al., 2018). Half came from only four glaciers (Jakobshavn Isbræ, 
Kangerdlugssuaq, Koge Bugt, and Ikertivaq South) (Enderlin et al., 
2014). Glacier thinning has decreased glacier discharge, however, 
reducing the dynamic contribution to GIS mass loss (e.g., from 58% 
from 2000 to 2005 to 32% between 2009 and 2012; Enderlin et al., 
2014). Furthermore, there is now high conﬁdence that for most of 
the GIS, increased surface melt has not led to sustained increases 
in glacier ﬂux on annual timescales because subglacial drainage 
networks have evolved to drain away the additional water inputs 
(e.g., Sole et al., 2013; Tedstone et al., 2015; Stevens et al., 2016; 
Nienow et al., 2017; King et al.,2018).
3.3.1.5 
Drivers of Ice Sheet Mass Change
3.3.1.5.1 Ocean drivers
The reduction of ice shelf buttressing that has dominated AIS mass 
loss (Section  3.3.1.2) has been driven primarily by increases in 
sub-ice shelf melting (Khazendar et al., 2013; Pollard et al., 2015; 
Cook et al., 2016; Rintoul et al., 2016; Walker and Gardner, 2017; 
Adusumilli et al., 2018; Dow et al., 2018a; Minchew et al., 2018) 
(high conﬁdence). Shoaling of relatively warm Circumpolar Deep 
Water has controlled recent variability in melting in the Amundsen 
and Bellingshausen seas, Wilkes Land (Roberts et al., 2018) and the 
AP (medium conﬁdence) (Jacobs et al., 2011; Pritchard et al., 2012; 
Depoorter et al., 2013; Rignot et al., 2013; Dutrieux et al., 2014; Paolo 
et al., 2015; Wouters et al., 2015; Christianson et al., 2016; Cook 
et al., 2016; Jenkins et al., 2018; Roberts et al., 2018). Changes in 
winds have driven this shoaling by affecting continental shelf edge 
undercurrents (Walker et al., 2013; Dutrieux et al., 2014; Kimura et al., 
2017) and overturning in coastal polynyas (St-Laurent et al., 2015; 
Webber et al., 2017) (medium conﬁdence). Winds over the Amundsen 
Sea are highly variable, however, with complex interactions between 
SAM, El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Atlantic Multidecadal 
Oscillation, and the Amundsen Sea Low (Uotila et al., 2013; Li et al., 
2014; Turner et al., 2016) (SM3.1.3). 
Through their effects on Antarctic coastal ocean circulation, ENSO or 
other tropical-ocean variability may have triggered changes to Pine 
Island Glacier in the 1940s (Smith et al., 2017c) and again in the 
1970s and 1990s (Jenkins et al., 2018), and recent ENSO variability 
is correlated with recent changes in ice shelf thickness (Paolo et al., 
2018) (medium conﬁdence). Such coupling between wind variability, 
ocean upwelling, ice shelf melt, buttressing and glacier ﬂow rate has 
also been observed in EAIS, at Totten Glacier, Wilkes Land (Greene 
et al., 2017).
Around Greenland, an anomalous inﬂow of subtropical water driven 
by wind changes, multi-decadal natural ocean variability (Andresen 
et al., 2012), and a  long-term increase in the North Atlantic’s 
upper ocean heat content since the 1950s (Cheng et al., 2017), all 
contributed to a warming of the subpolar North Atlantic (Häkkinen 
et al., 2013) (medium conﬁdence). Water temperatures near the 
grounding zone of GIS outlet glaciers are critically important to their 
calving rate (O’Leary and Christoffersen, 2013) (medium conﬁdence), 
and warm waters have been observed interacting with major GIS 
outlet glaciers (high conﬁdence) (e.g., Holland et al., 2008; Straneo 
et al., 2017).
The processes behind warm-water incursions in coastal Greenland 
that force glacier retreat remain unclear, however (Straneo et al., 
2013; Xu et al., 2013b; Bendtsen et al., 2015; Murray et al., 2015; 
Cowton et al., 2016; Miles et al., 2016), and there is low conﬁdence in 
understanding coastal GIS glacier response to ocean forcing because 
submarine melt rates, calving rates (Rignot et al., 2010; Todd and 
Christoffersen, 2014; Benn et al., 2017), bed and fjord geometry and 
the roles of ice melange and subglacial discharge (Enderlin et al., 
2013; Gladish et al., 2015; Slater et al., 2015; Morlighem et al., 2016; 
Rathmann et al., 2017) are poorly understood, and extrapolation 
from a small sample of glaciers is impractical (Moon et al., 2012; Carr 
et al., 2013; Straneo et al., 2016; Cowton et al., 2018). 
3.3.1.5.2 Atmospheric drivers
Snow accumulation and surface melt in Antarctica are inﬂuenced 
by the Southern Hemisphere extratropical circulation (SM3.1.3), 
which has intensiﬁed and shifted poleward in austral summer from 
1950 to 2012 (Arblaster et al., 2014; Swart et al., 2015a) (medium 
conﬁdence). The austral summer SAM has been in its most positive 
extended state for the past 600 years (Abram et al., 2014; Dätwyler 
et al., 2017), and from 1979 to 2013 has contributed to intensiﬁed 
atmospheric circulation and increasing and decreasing snowfall 
240

in the western and eastern AP respectively (Marshall et al., 2017) 
(medium conﬁdence). WAIS accumulation trends (Section  3.3.1.2) 
resulted from a deepening of the Amundsen Sea Low over recent 
decades (Raphael et al., 2016) (high conﬁdence). 
During the 1990s, WAIS experienced record surface warmth relative to 
the past 200 years, though similar conditions occurred for 1% of the 
preceding 2000 years (Steig et al., 2013), and WAIS surface melting 
remains limited. In contrast, AP surface melting has intensiﬁed since 
the mid-20th century and the last three decades were unprecedented 
over 1000 years (Abram et al., 2013a). The northeast AP began 
warming 600 years ago and past-century rates were unusual over 
2000 years (Mulvaney et al., 2012; Stenni et al., 2017). Increased 
föhn winds due to the more positive SAM (Cape et al., 2015) caused 
increased surface melting on the Larsen ice shelves (Grosvenor 
et al., 2014; Luckman et al., 2014; Elvidge et al., 2015) and after 
11,000 years intact, the 2002 melt-driven collapse of the Larsen B ice 
shelf followed strong warming between the mid–1950s and the late 
1990s (Domack et al., 2005) (medium conﬁdence). 
In Greenland, associations between atmospheric pressure indices 
such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and temperature, 
insolation and snowfall indicate with high conﬁdence that, as in 
Antarctica, variability of large-scale atmospheric circulation is an 
important driver of SMB changes (Fettweis et al., 2013; Tedesco et al., 
2013; Ding et al., 2014; Tedesco et al., 2016b; Ding et al., 2017; Hofer 
et al., 2017). A post-1990s decrease in summer NAO reﬂects increased 
anticyclonic weather (e.g., Tedesco et al., 2013; Hanna et al., 2015) 
that advected warm air over the GIS, explaining ~70% of summer 
surface warming from 2003 to 2013 (Fettweis et al., 2013; Tedesco 
et al., 2013; Mioduszewski et al., 2016), and reduced the cloud cover, 
increasing shortwave insolation (Tedesco et al., 2013) that, combined 
with albedo feedbacks (Box et al., 2012; Charalampidis et al., 2015; 
Tedesco et al., 2016a; Stibal et al., 2017; Ryan et al., 2018) (high 
conﬁdence), explains most of the post-1990s melt increase (Hofer 
et al., 2017). These drivers culminated in July 2012 in exceptional 
warmth and surface melt up to the ice sheet summit (Nghiem et al., 
2012; Tedesco et al., 2013; Hanna et al., 2014; Hanna et al., 2016; 
McLeod and Mote, 2016).
3.3.1.6 
Natural and Anthropogenic Forcing
There is medium agreement but limited evidence of anthropogenic 
forcing of AIS mass balance through both SMB and glacier dynamics 
(low conﬁdence). Partitioning between natural and human drivers of 
atmospheric and ocean circulation changes remains very uncertain. 
Partitioning is challenging because, along with the effects of 
greenhouse gas increases and stratospheric ozone depletion (Waugh 
et al., 2015; England et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016a), atmospheric and 
ocean variability in the areas of greatest AIS mass change are affected 
by a complex chain of processes (e.g., Fyke et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 
2018a) that exhibit considerable natural variability and have multiple 
interacting links to sea surface conditions in the Paciﬁc (Schneider 
et al., 2015; England et al., 2016; Raphael et al., 2016; Clem et al., 
2017; Steig et al., 2017; Paolo et al., 2018) and Atlantic (Li et al., 
2014), with additional local feedbacks (e.g., Stammerjohn et al., 
2012; Goosse and Zunz, 2014). Recent AP warming and consequent 
ice shelf collapses have evidence of a link to anthropogenic ozone and 
greenhouse gas forcing via the SAM (e.g., Marshall, 2004; Shindell, 
2004; Arblaster and Meehl, 2006; Marshall et al., 2006; Abram et al., 
2014) and to anthropogenic Atlantic sea surface warming via the 
Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (e.g., Li et al., 2014). This warming 
was highly unusual over the last 1000 years but not unprecedented, 
and along with subsequent cooling is within the bounds of the large 
natural decadal-scale climate variability in this region (Mulvaney 
et al., 2012; Turner et al., 2016). More broadly over the AP and 
coastal WAIS where dynamic mass losses are concentrated, natural 
variability in atmospheric and ocean forcing appear to dominate 
observed mass balance (medium conﬁdence) (Smith and Polvani, 
2017; Jenkins et al., 2018).
Evidence exists for an anthropogenic role in the atmospheric circulation 
(NAO) changes that have driven GIS mass loss (Section 3.3.1.5.2) 
(medium conﬁdence), although this awaits formal attribution testing 
(e.g., Easterling et al., 2016). Arctic ampliﬁcation of anthropogenic 
warming (e.g., Serreze et al., 2009) affects atmospheric circulation 
(Francis and Vavrus, 2015; Mann et al., 2017) and has reduced sea ice 
extent (Section 3.2.1.1.1), feeding back to exacerbate both warming 
and NAO changes (Screen and Simmonds, 2010) that impact GIS 
mass balance. Negative-NAO wind patterns increased GIS melt 
observed in a 40-year runoff signal (Ahlstrom et al., 2017), and an 
increase in melting beginning in the mid-1800s closely followed the 
onset of industrial era Arctic warming and emerged beyond the range 
of natural variability in the last few decades (Graeter et al., 2018; 
Trusel et al., 2018) (Section 3.3.1.4).

3.3.2 
Polar Glacier Changes
3.3.2.1 
Observations, Components of Change, and Drivers
Chapter 3 assesses changes in polar glaciers in the Canadian and 
Russian Arctic, Svalbard, Greenland and Antarctica, independent of 
the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets (Figure 3.8). Glaciers in all 
other regions including Alaska, Scandinavia and Iceland are assessed 
in Chapter 2. 
Changes in the mass of Arctic glaciers for the ‘present day’ (2006–
2015) are assessed using a  combination of satellite observations 
and direct measurements (Figure  3.8; Appendix  2.A, Table  1). 
During this period, glacier mass loss was largest in the periphery 
of Greenland  (–47 ±  16 Gt yr–1), followed by Arctic Canada 
North (–39 ± 8 Gt yr–1), Arctic Canada South (–33 ± 9 Gt yr–1), the Russian 
Arctic (–15 ± 12 Gt yr–1) and Svalbard and Jan Mayen (–9 ± 5 Gt yr–1). 
When combined with the Arctic regions covered in Chapter 2 (Alaska, 
the Yukon territory of Canada, Iceland and Scandinavia), Arctic 
glaciers as a whole lost mass at a rate of –213 ± 29 Gt yr–1, a sea 
level contribution of 0.59 ± 0.08 mm yr–1 (high conﬁdence). Overall 
during this period, Arctic glaciers caused a similar amount of sea

level rise to the GIS (Section 3.3.1.3), but their rate of mass loss per 
unit area was larger (Bolch et al., 2013). 
There is limited evidence (high agreement) that the current rate of 
glacier mass loss is larger than at any time during the past 4000 years 
(Fisher et al., 2012; Zdanowicz et al., 2012). Further back in time during 
the early to mid- Holocene, pre-historic glacial deposits, ice core 
records, and numerical modelling evidence shows that many Arctic 
glaciers were at various stages similar to or smaller than present 
(Gilbert et al., 2017; Zekollari et al., 2017), experienced greater melt 
rates (Lecavalier et al., 2017), or may have disappeared altogether 
(Solomina et al., 2015) (medium conﬁdence). This evidence, however, 
does not provide a complete assessment of the rates and magnitudes 
of past glacier mass loss.
Atmospheric circulation changes (Box et al., 2018) have led to 
pan-Arctic variability in glacier mass balance (high conﬁdence), 
including different rates of retreat between eastern and western 
glaciers in Greenland’s periphery (Bjørk et al., 2018), and a  high 
rate of surface melt in the Canadian Arctic (Gardner et al., 2013; 
Van Wychen et al., 2016; Millan et al., 2017) through persistently 
high summer air temperatures (Bezeau et al., 2014; McLeod and 
Mote, 2016). Atmospheric circulation anomalies from 2007 to 2012 
associated with glacier mass loss are also linked to enhanced GIS 
melt (Section 3.3.1.4) and Arctic sea ice loss (Section 3.2.1.1), and 
exceed by a factor of two the interannual variability in daily mean 
pressure (sea level and 500 hPa) of the Arctic region over the 1871–
2014 period (Belleﬂamme et al., 2015) (Section 3.3.1.6).
Increased surface melt on Arctic glaciers has led to a positive feedback 
from lowered surface albedo, causing further melt (Box et al., 2012), 
and in Svalbard, mean glacier albedo has reduced between 1979 and 
2015 (Möller and Möller, 2017). Across the Arctic, increased surface 
melt and subsequent ice-layer formation via refreezing within snow 
and ﬁrn also reduces the ability of glaciers to store meltwater, 
increasing runoff (Zdanowicz et al., 2012; Gascon et al., 2013a; 
Gascon et al., 2013b; Noël et al., 2017; Noël et al., 2018).
Between the 1990s and 2017, tidewater glaciers have exhibited 
regional patterns in glacier dynamics; glaciers in Arctic Canada 
have largely decelerated, while glaciers in Svalbard and the Russian 
Arctic have accelerated (Van Wychen et al., 2016; Strozzi et al., 
2017). Annual retreat rates of tidewater glaciers in Svalbard and the 
Russian Arctic for 2000–2010, have increased by a factor 2 and 2.5 
respectively, between 1992 and 2000 (Carr et al., 2017). Acceleration

has dominated dynamic ice discharge on time-scales of years to 
decades (Van Wychen et al., 2014; Dunse et al., 2015). 
The recent acceleration and surge behaviour of polythermal glaciers 
in Svalbard and the Russian Arctic is caused by destabilisation of the 
marine termini due to increased surface melt, and changes in basal 
temperature, lubrication and weakening of subglacial sediments (Dunse 
et al., 2015; Sevestre et al., 2018; Willis et al., 2018) or terminus thinning 
and response to warmer ocean temperatures (McMillan et al., 2014a) 
(low conﬁdence). Iceberg calving rates in Svalbard are linked to ocean 
temperatures which control rates of submarine melt (Luckman et al., 
2015; Vallot et al., 2018) (medium conﬁdence). Rapid disintegration of 
ice shelves in the Canadian and Russian Arctic continues and has led to 
acceleration and thinning in tributary-glacier basins (high conﬁdence) 
(Willis et al., 2015; Copland and Mueller, 2017).
Little information is available on Holocene and historic changes 
in glaciers in Antarctica (separate from the ice sheet), and on 
sub-Antarctic islands (Hodgson et al., 2014). Mass changes of glaciers 
in these regions between 2006 and 2015 (–90 ± 860 Gt yr–1) have low 
conﬁdence as they are based on a single data compilation with large 
uncertainties in the Antarctic region (Zemp et al., 2019) (Figure 3.8). 
Limited evidence with high agreement from individual glaciers 
suggests that regional variability in glacier mass changes may be 
linked to changes in the large-scale Southern Hemisphere atmospheric 
circulation (Section 3.3.1.5.2). On islands adjacent to the AP, glaciers 
experienced retreat and mass loss during the mid to late 20th century, 
but since around 2009 there has been a reduction in mass loss rate 
or a  return to slightly positive balance (Navarro et al., 2017; Oliva 
et al., 2017). Reduced mass loss has been linked to increased winter 
snow accumulation and decreased summer melt at these locations, 
associated with recent deepening of the circumpolar pressure trough 
(Oliva et al., 2017). Conversely, on the sub-Antarctic Kerguelen Islands, 
increased glacier mass loss (Verfaillie et al., 2015) may be due to 
reduced snow accumulation rather than increased air temperature as 
a result of southward migration of storm tracks (Favier et al., 2016).

Sea Level
Chapter 4  assesses the sea level impacts from observed and 
projected changes in ice sheets (Section  3.3.1) and polar glaciers 
(Section 3.3.2), including uncertainties related to marine ice sheets 
(Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3).
3.3.3.2 
Physical Oceanography
The major large-scale impacts of freshwater release from Greenland on 
ocean circulation relate to the potential modulation/inhibition of the 
formation of water masses that represent the headwaters of the Atlantic 
Meridional Overturning Circulation. The timescales and likelihood 
of such effects are assessed separately in Chapter 6  (Section  6.7). 
Freshwater release also affects local circulation within fjords through 
two principle mechanisms; subglacial release from tidewater 
glaciers enhances buoyancy driven circulation, whereas runoff from 
land-terminating glaciers contributes to surface layer freshening and 
estuarine circulation (Straneo and Cenedese, 2015). There is limited 
evidence that freshening occurred between 2003 and 2015 in North 
East Greenland fjords and coastal waters (Sejr et al., 2017).
For Antarctica, freshwater input to the ocean from the ice sheet is 
divided approximately equally between melting of calved icebergs 
and of ice shelves in situ (Depoorter et al., 2013; Rignot et al., 2014). 
There is high conﬁdence that the input of ice shelf meltwater has 
increased in the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas since the 1990s, 
but low conﬁdence in trends in other sectors (Paolo et al., 2015). 
Freshwater injected from the AIS affect water mass circulation and 
transformation, though sea ice dominates upper ocean properties 
away from the Antarctic ice shelves (Abernathey et al., 2016; Haumann 
et al., 2016). Over the ice shelf regions, where dense waters sink and 
ﬂood the global ocean abyss, the role of glacial freshwater input is 
clearer. From 1980 to 2012, the salinity of Antarctic Bottom Water 
reduced by an amount equivalent to 73 ± 26 Gt y–1 of freshwater 
added, around half the estimated increase in freshwater input by 
Antarctic glacial discharge up to that time (Purkey and Johnson, 
2013). In some places, notably the Indian-Australian sector, Antarctic 
Bottom Water freshening may be accelerating (Menezes et al., 2017). 
There is medium conﬁdence in an overall freshening trend and low 
conﬁdence that this is accelerating, given the sparsity of information 
and signiﬁcant interannual variability in Antarctic Bottom Water 
properties at other export locations (Meijers et al., 2016).
For the Southern Ocean, there is limited evidence for stratiﬁcation 
changes in the post-AR5 period, and low conﬁdence in how 
stratiﬁcation changes are affecting sea ice and basal ice shelf melt. 
An increase in stratiﬁcation caused by release of freshwater from the 
AIS was invoked as a mechanism to suppress vertical heat ﬂux and 
permit an increase in sea ice extent (Bintanja et al., 2013; Bronselaer 
et al., 2018; Purich et al., 2018), though some studies conclude that 
glacial freshwater input is insufﬁcient to cause a signiﬁcant sea ice 
expansion (Swart and Fyfe, 2013; Pauling et al., 2017) (Section 3.2.1.1). 
In contrast, where warm water intrusions drive melting within ice 
shelf cavities, a  signiﬁcant entrained heat ﬂux to the surface can 
exist and increase stratiﬁcation and potentially reduce sea ice extent 
(Jourdain et al., 2017; Merino et al., 2018). It has been argued that 
freshening from glacial melt can enhance basal melting of ice shelves 
by reducing dense water production and modulating oceanic heat 
ﬂow into ice shelf cavities (Silvano et al., 2018).
3.3.3.3 
Biogeochemistry
Both polar ice sheets have the potential to release dissolved and 
sediment-bound nutrients and organic carbon directly to the surface 
ocean via subglacial and surface meltwater, icebergs, melting of the 
base of ice shelves (Shadwick et al., 2013; Wadham et al., 2013; 
Hood et al., 2015; Herraiz-Borreguero et al., 2016; Raiswell et al., 
243

2016; Yager et al., 2016; Hodson et al., 2017), in addition to indirectly 
stimulating nutrient input via upwelling associated with subglacial 
meltwater plumes (Meire et al., 2016b; Cape et al., 2018; Hopwood 
et al., 2018; Kanna et al., 2018) (Figure 3.9). These nutrient additions 
stimulate primary production in the surrounding ocean waters in 
some regions (medium conﬁdence) (Gerringa et al., 2012; Death et al., 
2014; Duprat et al., 2016; Arrigo et al., 2017b). There is also some 
evidence to support melting ice sheets as source of contaminants 
(AMAP, 2015).
In Greenland, direct measurements suggest that meltwater is 
a signiﬁcant source of bioavailable silica and iron (Bhatia et al., 2013; 
Hawkings et al., 2014; Meire et al., 2016a; Hawkings et al., 2017) 
but may be less important for the supply of bioavailable forms of 
dissolved nitrogen or phosphorous (Hawkings et al., 2016; Wadham 
et al., 2016), which often limit the integrated primary production 
during summer in fjords (Meire et al., 2016a; Hopwood et al., 2018). 
The offshore export of iron, however, has been linked to primary 
productivity in surface ocean waters in the Labrador Sea (Arrigo 
et al., 2017b) (limited evidence, high agreement).
Subglacial meltwater plumes from tidewater glaciers have emerged 
recently as an important indirect source of nutrients to fjords, by 
entraining nutrient-replete seawater (Meire et al., 2016b; Meire 
et al., 2017; Cape et al., 2018; Hopwood et al., 2018; Kanna et al., 
2018) (medium evidence, high agreement). There is medium evidence 
with high agreement that these upwelled nutrient ﬂuxes enhance 
primary production in fjords over a distance of up to 100 km along 
the trajectory of the outﬂowing plume (Juul-Pedersen et al., 2015; 
Cape et al., 2018; Kanna et al., 2018).
In Antarctica, there is medium evidence with high agreement that 
enhanced input of iron from ice shelves, glacial meltwater and 
icebergs stimulates primary production in polynyas, coastal regions 
and the wider Southern Ocean (Gerringa et al., 2012; Shadwick et al., 
2013; Herraiz-Borreguero et al., 2016). Satellite observations and 
modelling also indicate variable potential for icebergs to fertilise the 
Southern Ocean beyond the coastal zone (Death et al., 2014; Duprat 
et al., 2016; Wu and Hou, 2017).
Dissolved nutrient ﬂuxes from ice sheets may be increasing 
during high melt years (Hawkings et al., 2015). The dominant 
sediment-bound fraction, however, may not increase with rising melt 
(Hawkings et al., 2015). Thus, there is low conﬁdence overall in the 
magnitude of the response of direct nutrient ﬂuxes from ice sheets 
to enhanced melting. 
Future predictions of nutrient cycling proximal to ice sheets is made 
more challenging by the landward progression of marine-terminating 
glaciers and the collapse of ice shelves (Cook et al., 2016). This has 
the potential to drive major shifts in nutrient supply to coastal waters 
(Figure 3.9). The erosion of newly exposed glacial sediments in front of 
retreating land-terminating glaciers (Monien et al., 2017) and changes 
in the diffuse nutrient ﬂuxes from newly exposed glacial sediments 
on the seaﬂoor (Wehrmann et al., 2014) may amplify nutrient supply, 
whilst other nutrient sources may be cut off (e.g., icebergs, upwelling 
of marine water; Meire et al., 2017) (low conﬁdence).
There is medium evidence with high agreement that long-term 
tidewater glacier retreat into shallower water or onto land, a plausible 
scenario for about 55% of the 243 distinct outlet glaciers in Greenland 
(Morlighem et al., 2017), will reduce or diminish upwelling a source 
of nutrients, thereby reducing summer productivity in Greenland fjord 
ecosystems (Meire et al., 2017; Hopwood et al., 2018).

3.3.3.4 
Ecosystems
For Greenland and Svalbard, there is limited evidence with high 
agreement that the retreat of marine-terminating glaciers will alter 
food supply to higher trophic levels of marine food webs (Meire et al., 
2017; Milner et al., 2017). The consequences of changes in glacial 
systems on marine ecosystems are often mediated via the fjordic 
environments that fringe the edge of the ice sheets, for example 
changing physical-chemical conditions have affected the benthic 
ecosystems of Arctic fjords (Bourgeois et al., 2016). The ampliﬁcation 
of nutrient ﬂuxes caused by enhanced upwelling at calving fronts 
(Meire et al., 2017), combined with high carbon/nutrient burial and 
recycling rates (Wehrmann et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2015), plays 
an important role in sustaining high productivity of the Arctic fjord 
ecosystems of Greenland and Svalbard (Lydersen et al., 2014). Glacier 
retreat, causing glaciers to shift from being marine-terminating to 
land-terminating, can reduce the productivity in coastal areas 
off Greenland with potentially large ecological implications, also 
negatively affecting production of commercially harvested ﬁsh (Meire 
et al., 2017). There is also evidence that marine-terminating glaciers 
are important feeding areas for marine mammals and seabirds at 
Greenland (Laidre et al., 2016) and Svalbard (Lydersen et al., 2014).
For Antarctica, there is high agreement based on medium evidence 
that ice shelf retreat or collapse is leading to new marine habitats 
and to biological colonisation (Gutt et al., 2011; Fillinger et al., 2013; 
Trathan et al., 2013; Hauquier et al., 2016; Ingels et al., 2018). The loss 
of ice shelves and retreat of coastal glaciers around the AP in the last 
50 years has exposed at least 2.4 × 104 km2 of new open water. These 
newly-revealed habitats have allowed new phytoplankton blooms 
to be produced resulting in new marine zooplankton and seabed 
communities (Gutt et al., 2011; Fillinger et al., 2013; Trathan et al., 
2013; Hauquier et al., 2016) (Section 3.2.3.2.1), and have resulted 
in enhanced carbon uptake by coastal marine ecosystems (medium 
conﬁdence), although quantitative estimates of biological carbon 
uptake are highly variable (Trathan et al., 2013; Barnes et al., 2018). 
Newly available habitat on coastlines may also provide breeding 
or haul out sites for land-based predators such as penguins and 
seals (Trathan et al., 2013) (low conﬁdence). Fjords that have been 
studied in the subpolar western AP are hotspots of abundance and 
biodiversity of benthic macro-organisms (Grange and Smith, 2013) 
and there is evidence that glacier retreat in these environments can 
impact the structure and function of benthic communities (Moon 
et al., 2015; Sahade et al., 2015) (low conﬁdence).
Cross-Chapter Box 8 |  Future Sea Level Changes and Marine Ice Sheet Instability

(Netherlands), Jeremy Bassis (USA)
Over the last century, glaciers were the main contributors to increasing ocean water mass (Section 4.2.1.2). However, most terrestrial 
frozen water is stored in Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets, and future changes in their dynamics and mass balance will cause sea 
level rise over the 21st century and beyond (Section 4.2.3).
About a third of the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) is ‘marine ice sheet’, i.e., rests on bedrock below sea level (Figure 4.5), with most of the 
ice sheet margin terminating directly in the ocean. These features make the overlying ice sheet vulnerable to dynamical instabilities 
with the potential to cause rapid ice loss; so-called Marine Ice Sheet and Marine Ice Cliff instabilities, as discussed below.
In many places around the AIS margin, the seaward-ﬂowing ice forms ﬂoating ice shelves (Figure CB8.1). Ice shelves in contact with 
bathymetric features on the sea ﬂoor or conﬁned within embayments provide back stress (buttressing) that impedes the seaward 
ﬂow of the upstream ice and thereby stabilises the ice sheet. The ice shelves are thus a key factor controlling AIS dynamics. Almost 
all Antarctic ice shelves provide substantial buttressing (Fürst et al., 2016) but some are currently thinning at an increasing rate 
(Khazendar et al., 2016). Today, thinning and retreat of ice shelves is associated primarily with ocean driven basal melt that, in turn, 
promotes iceberg calving (Section 3.3.1.2).
Accumulation and percolation of surface melt and rain water also impact ice shelves by lowering albedo, deepening surface crevasses, 
and causing ﬂexural stresses that can lead to hydrofracturing and ice shelf collapse (Macayeal and Sergienko, 2013). In some cases 
supraglacial (i.e., ﬂowing on the glacier surface) rivers might diminish destabilising impact of surface melt by removing meltwater 
before it ponds on the ice shelf surface (Bell et al., 2017). In summary, both ocean forcing and surface melt affect ice shelf mechanical 
stability (high conﬁdence), but the precise importance of the different mechanisms remains poorly understood and observed.
The future dynamic response of the AIS to warming will largely be determined by changes in ice shelves, because their thinning 
or collapse will reduce their buttressing capacity, leading to an acceleration of the grounded ice and to thinning of the ice margin. In 
turn, this thinning can initiate grounding line retreat (Konrad et al., 2018). If the grounding line is located on bedrock sloping downwards 
toward the ice sheet interior (retrograde slope), initial retreat can trigger a positive feedback, due to non-linear response of the 
seaward ice ﬂow to the grounding line thickness change. As a result, progressively more ice will ﬂow into the ocean (Figure CB8.1a).

This self-sustaining process is known as Marine Ice Sheet Instability (MISI). The onset and persistence of MISI is dependent on several 
factors in addition to overall bed slope, including the details of the bed geometry and conditions, ice shelf pinning points, lateral shear 
from the walls, self-gravitation effects on local sea level and isostatic adjustment. Hence, long-term retreat on every retrograde sloped 
bed is not necessarily unstoppable (Gomez et al., 2015).
The MISI process might be particularly important in West Antarctica, where most of the ice sheet is grounded on bedrock below sea 
level (Figure 4.5). Since AR5, there is growing observational and modelling evidence that accelerated retreat may be underway in 
several major Amundsen Sea outlets, including Thwaites, Pine Island, Smith, and Kohler glaciers (e.g., Rignot et al., 2014) supporting 
the MISI hypothesis, although observed grounding line retreat on retrograde slope is not deﬁnitive proof that MISI isunderway.
It has been shown recently (Barletta et al., 2018) that the Amundsen Sea Embayment (ASE) experiences unexpectedly fast bedrock 
uplift (up to 41 mm yr–1, due to mantle viscosity much lower than the global average) as an adjustment to reduced ice mass loading, 
which could help stabilise grounding line retreat. 
One of the largest outlets of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS), Totten glacier, has also been retreating and thinning in recent decades (Li 
et al., 2015b). Totten’s current behaviour suggests that East Antarctica could become a substantial contributor to future sea level rise, as it 
has been in the previous warm periods (Aitken et al., 2016). It is not clear, however, if the changes observed recently are a linear response 
to increased ocean forcing (Section 3.3.1.2), or an indication that MISI has commenced (Roberts et al., 2018).
The disappearance of ice shelves may allow the formation of ice cliffs, which may be inherently unstable if they are tall enough 
(subaerial cliff height between 100 and 285 m) to generate stresses that exceed the strength of the ice (Parizek et al., 2019). This ice 
cliff failure can lead to ice sheet retreat via a process called marine ice cliff instability (MICI; Figure CB8.1b), that has been hypothesised 
to cause partial collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) within a few centuries (Pollard et al., 2015; DeConto and Pollard, 2016).
Limited evidence is available to conﬁrm the importance of MICI. In Antarctica, marine-terminating ice margins with the grounding 
lines thick enough to produce unstable ice cliffs are currently buttressed by ice shelves, with a possible exception of Crane glacier 
on the Antarctic Peninsula (Section 4.2.3.1.2). 
Overall, there is low agreement on the exact MICI mechanism and limited evidence of its occurrence in the present or the past. 
Thus the potential of MICI to impact the future sea level remains very uncertain (Edwards et al., 2019).
Limited evidence from geological records and ice sheet modelling suggests that parts of AIS experienced rapid (i.e., on centennial 
time-scale) retreat likely due to ice sheet instability processes between 20,000 and 9,000 years ago (Golledge et al., 2014; Weber 
et al., 2014; Small et al., 2019). Both the WAIS (including Pine Island glacier) and EAIS also experienced rapid thinning and

Figure CB8.1 |  Schematic representation of Marine Ice Sheet Instability (MISI, a) and Marine Ice Cliff Instability (MICI, b) from Pattyn (2018). (a) thinning of the 
buttressing ice shelf leads to acceleration of the ice sheet ﬂow and thinning of the marine-terminated ice margin. Because bedrock under the ice sheet is sloping 
towards ice sheet interior, thinning of the ice causes retreat of the grounding line followed by an increase of the seaward ice ﬂux, further thinning of the ice margin, 
and further retreat of the grounding line. (b) disintegration of the ice shelf due to bottom melting and/or hydro-fracturing produces an ice cliff. If the cliff is tall 
enough (at least ~800 m of total ice thickness, or about 100 m of ice above the water line), the stresses at the cliff face exceed the strength of the ice, and the cliff 
fails structurally in repeated calving events. Note that MISI requires a retrograde bed slope, while MICI can be realised on a ﬂat or seaward-inclined bed. Like MISI, 
the persistence of MICI depends on the lack of ice shelf buttressing, which can stop or slow brittle ice failure at the grounding line by providing supportive backstress.

grounding line retreat during the early to mid-Holocene (Jones et al., 2015b; Wise et al., 2017). In the Ross Sea, grounding lines  
may have retreated several hundred kilometers inland and then re-advanced to their present-day positions due to bedrock uplift after 
ice mass removal (Kingslake et al., 2018), thus supporting the stabilising role of glacial isostatic adjustment on ice sheets (Barletta et al., 
2018). These past rapid changes have likely been driven by the incursion of Circumpolar Deep Water onto the Antarctic continental 
shelf (Section 3.3.1.5.1) (Golledge et al., 2014; Hillenbrand et al., 2017) and MISI (Jones et al., 2015b). Limited evidence of past MICI 
in Antarctica is provided by deep iceberg plough marks on the sea-ﬂoor (Wise et al., 2017).
The ability of models to simulate the processes controlling MISI has improved since AR5 (Pattyn, 2018), but signiﬁcant discrepancies 
in projections remain (Section 4.2.3.2) due to poor understanding of mechanisms and lack of observational data on bed topography, 
isostatic rebound rates, etc. to constrain the models. Inclusion of MICI in one ice sheet model has improved its ability to match (albeit 
uncertain) geological sea level targets in the Pliocene (Pollard et al., 2015) and Last Interglacial (DeConto and Pollard, 2016), although 
the MICI solution may not be unique (Aitken et al., 2016) (Section 4.2.3.1.2).
The Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) has limited direct access to the ocean through relatively narrow subglacial troughs (Morlighem et al., 
2017), and most of the bedrock at the ice sheet margin is above sea level (Figure 4.5). However, since AR5 it has been argued 
that several Greenland outlet glaciers (Petermann, Kangerdlugssuaq, Jakobshavn Isbræ, Helheim, Zachariæ Isstrøm) and North-East 
Greenland Ice Stream may contribute more than expected to future sea level rise (Mouginot et al., 2015). It has also been shown that 
Greenland was nearly ice free for extensive episodic periods during the Pleistocene, suggesting a sensitivity to deglaciation under 
climates similar to or slightly warmer than present (Schaefer et al., 2016).
A MICI-style behaviour is seen today in Greenland at the termini of Jakobshavn and Helheim glaciers (Parizek et al., 2019), but calving 
of these narrow outlets is controlled by a combination of ductile and brittle processes, which might not be representative examples of 
much wider Antarctic outlet glaciers, like Thwaites. 
Overall, this assessment ﬁnds that unstable retreat and thinning of some Antarctic glaciers, and to a lesser extent Greenland outlet 
glaciers, may be underway. However, the timescale and future rate of these processes is not well known, casting deep uncertainty on 
projections of the sea level contributions from the AIS (Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 1, Section 4.2.3.1).

Arctic Snow, Freshwater Ice and 
Permafrost: Changes, Consequences  
and Impacts
3.4.1 
Observations
3.4.1.1 
Seasonal Snow Cover
Terrestrial snow cover is a deﬁning characteristic of the Arctic land 
surface for up to nine months each year, with changes inﬂuencing the 
surface energy budget, ground thermal regime and freshwater budget. 
Snow cover also interacts with vegetation, inﬂuences biogeochemical 
activity and affects habitats and species, with consequences for 
ecosystem services. Arctic land areas are almost always completely 
snow covered in winter, so the transition seasons of autumn and 
spring are key when characterising variability and change.
3.4.1.1.1 Extent and duration
Dramatic reductions in Arctic (land areas north of 60ºN) spring snow 
cover extent have occurred since satellite charting began in 1967 
(Estilow et al., 2015). Declines in May and June of –3.5% (± 1.9%) 
and –13.4% respectively per decade (± 5.4%) between 1967 and 
2018 (relative to the 1981–2010 mean) were determined from 
multiple datasets based on the methodology of (Mudryk et al., 
2017) (Figure 3.10) (high conﬁdence). The loss of spring snow extent 
is reﬂected in shorter snow cover duration estimated from surface 
observations (Bulygina et al., 2011; Brown et al., 2017), satellite 
data (Wang et al., 2013; Estilow et al., 2015; Anttila et al., 2018), and 
model-based analyses (Liston and Hiemstra, 2011) (high conﬁdence). 
These trends range between –0.7 and –3.9 days per decade 
depending on region and time period, but all spring snow cover 
duration trends from all datasets are negative (Brown et al., 2017). 
These same multi-source datasets also identify reductions in autumn 
snow extent and duration (-0.6 to -1.4 days per decade; summarized 
in Brown et al., 2017) (high conﬁdence). There is low conﬁdence in 
positive October and November snow cover extent trends apparent 
in a single dataset (Hernández-Henríquez et al., 2015) because they 
are not replicated in other surface, satellite and model datasets 
(Brown and Derksen, 2013; Mudryk et al., 2017).
3.4.1.1.2 Depth and water equivalent
Weather station observations across the Russian Arctic identify 
negative trends in the maximum snow depth between 1966 and 
2014 (Bulygina et al., 2011; Osokin and Sosnovsky, 2014). There is 
medium conﬁdence in this trend because the pointwise nature of 
these measurements does not capture prevailing conditions across 
247

the landscape. Seasonal maximum snow depth trends over the North 
American Arctic are mixed and largely statistically insigniﬁcant 
(Vincent et al., 2015; Brown et al., 2017). The timing of maximum 
snow depth has shifted earlier by  2.7 days per decade for the 
North American Arctic (Brown et al., 2017); comparable analysis is 
not available for Eurasia. Gridded products from remote sensing 
and land surface models identify negative trends in snow water 
equivalent between 1981 and 2016 for both the Eurasian and 
North American sectors of the Arctic (Brown et al., 2017). While 
the snow water equivalent anomaly time series show reasonable 
consistency between products when averaged at the continental 
scale, considerable inter-dataset variability in the spatial patterns of 
change (Liston and Hiemstra, 2011; Park et al., 2012; Brown et al., 
2017) mean there is only medium conﬁdence in these trends.
3.4.1.1.3 Drivers
Despite uncertainties due to sparse observations (Cowtan and Way, 
2014), surface temperature has increased across Arctic land areas in 
recent decades (Hawkins and Sutton, 2012; Fyfe et al., 2013), driving 
reductions in Arctic snow extent and duration (high conﬁdence). 
Changes in Arctic snow extent can be directly related to extratropical 
temperature increases (Brutel-Vuilmet et al., 2013; Thackeray et al., 
2016; Mudryk et al., 2017). Based on multiple historical datasets, there 
is a  consistent temperature sensitivity for Arctic snow extent, with 
approximately 800,000 km2 of snow cover lost per degrees Celsius 
warming in spring (Brown and Derksen, 2013; Brown et al., 2017), 
and 700,000–800,000 km2 lost in autumn (Derksen and Brown, 2012; 
Brown and Derksen, 2013) (high conﬁdence).
There is high conﬁdence that darkening of snow through the deposition 
of black carbon and other light absorbing particles enhances snow 
melt (Bullard et al., 2016; Skiles et al., 2018; Boy et al., 2019). The 
global direct radiative forcing for black carbon in seasonal snow and 
over sea ice is estimated to be 0.04 W m–2, but the effective forcing 
can be up to threefold greater at regional scales due to the enhanced 
albedo feedback triggered by the initial darkening (Bond et al., 2013). 
Lawrence et al. (2011) estimate the present-day radiative effect of 
black carbon and dust in land-based snow to be 0.083 W m–2, only 
marginally greater than the simulated 1850 effect (0.075 W  m–2) 
due to offsetting effects from increased black carbon emissions and 
reductions in dust darkening (medium conﬁdence). Kylling et al. 
(2018) estimate a  surface radiative effect of  0.292 W  m–2 caused 
by dust deposition (largely transported from Asia) to Arctic snow, 
approximately half of the black carbon central scenario estimate 
of Flanner et al. (2007). The forcing from brown carbon deposited 
in snow (associated with both combustion and secondary organic 
carbon) is estimated to be 0.09−0.25 W m–2, with the range due to 
assumptions of particle absorptivity (Lin et al., 2014) (low conﬁdence).
Precipitation remains a  sparse and highly uncertain measurement 
over Arctic land areas: in situ datasets remain uncertain (Yang, 2014) 
and are largely regional (Kononova, 2012; Vincent et al., 2015). 
Atmospheric reanalyses show increases in Arctic precipitation in recent 
decades (Lique et al., 2016; Vihma et al., 2016), but there remains 
low conﬁdence in reanalysis-based closure of the Arctic freshwater 
budget due to a  wide spread between available reanalysis derived 
precipitation estimates (Lindsay et al., 2014). Despite improved 
process understanding, estimates of sublimation loss during blowing 
snow events remain a key uncertainty in the mass budget of the Arctic 
snowpack (Sturm and Stuefer, 2013).
3.4.1.2 
Permafrost
3.4.1.2.1 Temperature
Record high temperatures at ~10–20 m  depth in the permafrost 
(near or below the depths affected by intra-annual ﬂuctuation in 
temperature) have been documented at many long-term monitoring 
sites in the Northern Hemisphere circumpolar permafrost region 
(AMAP, 2017d) (Figure  3.10) (very high conﬁdence). At some 
locations, the temperature is 2ºC–3ºC higher than 30 years ago. 
During the decade between 2007 and 2016, the rate of increase in 
permafrost temperatures was 0.39ºC ± 0.15ºC for colder continuous 
zone permafrost monitoring sites,  0.20ºC ±  0.10ºC for warmer 
discontinuous zone permafrost, giving a  global average of  0.29 
± 0.12ºC across all polar and mountain permafrost (Biskaborn et al., 
2019). Relatively smaller increases in permafrost temperature in 
warmer sites indicate that permafrost is thawing with heat absorbed 
by the ice-to-water phase change, and as a result, the active layer may 
be increasing in thickness. In contrast to temperature, there is only 
medium conﬁdence that active layer thickness across the region has 
increased. This conﬁdence level is because decadal trends vary across 
regions and sites (Shiklomanov et al., 2012) and because mechanical 
probing of the active layer can underestimate the degradation 
of permafrost in some cases because the surface subsides when 
ground ice melts and drains (Mekonnen et al., 2016; AMAP, 2017d; 
Streletskiy et al., 2017). Permafrost in the Southern Hemisphere 
polar region occurs in ice-free exposed areas (Bockheim et al., 
2013), 0.18% of the total land area of Antarctica (Burton-Johnson 
et al., 2016). This area is three orders of magnitude smaller than 
the 13–18 × 106 km2 area underlain by permafrost in the Northern 
Hemisphere terrestrial permafrost region (Gruber, 2012). Antarctic 
permafrost temperatures are generally colder (Noetzli et al., 2017) 
and increased 0.37ºC ± 0.10ºC between 2007 and 2016 (Biskaborn 
et al., 2019).
3.4.1.2.2 Ground ice
Permafrost thaw and loss of ground ice causes the land surface 
to subside and collapse into the volume previously occupied by 
ice, resulting in disturbance to overlying ecosystems and human 
infrastructure (Kanevskiy et al., 2013; Raynolds et al., 2014). Excess 
ice in permafrost is typical, varying for example from 40% of total 
volume in some sands up to 80–90% of total volume in ﬁne-grained 
soil/sediments (Kanevskiy et al., 2013). Ice rich permafrost areas 
where impacts of thaw could be greatest include the Yedoma deposits 
in Siberia, Alaska, and the Yukon in Canada, with ice divided between 
massive wedges interspersed with frozen soil/sediment containing 
pore ice and smaller ice features (Schirrmeister et al., 2011; Strauss 
et al., 2017). Other areas including, for example, Northwestern Canada, 
the Canadian Archipelago, the Yamal and Gydan peninsulas of West 
Siberia, and smaller portions of Eastern Siberia and Alaska contain 
buried glacial ice bodies of signiﬁcant thickness and extent (Lantuit

and Pollard, 2008; Leibman et al., 2011; Kokelj et al., 2017; Coulombe 
et al., 2019). The location and volume of ground ice integrated across 
the northern permafrost region (5.63–36.55 × 103 km3, equivalent 
to 2–10 cm sea level rise) is known with medium conﬁdence and 
with no recent updates at the circumpolar scale (Zhang et al., 2008). 
3.4.1.2.3 Carbon
The permafrost region represents a large, climate sensitive reservoir 
of organic carbon with the potential for some of this pool to be rapidly 
decayed and transferred to the atmosphere as CO2 and methane as 
permafrost thaws in a warming climate, thus accelerating the pace of 
climate change (Schuur et al., 2015). The current best mean estimate 
of total (surface plus deep) organic soil carbon (terrestrial) in the 
northern circumpolar permafrost region (17.8 × 106 km2 area) is 1460 
to 1600 petagrams (medium conﬁdence) (Pg; 1 Pg = 1 billion metric 
tonnes) (Schuur et al., 2018). All permafrost region soils estimated 
to 3 m in depth (surface) contain 1035 ± 150 Pg C (Tarnocai et al., 
2009; Hugelius et al., 2014) (high conﬁdence). Of the carbon in the 
surface, 800–1000 Pg C  is perennially frozen, with the remainder 
contained in seasonally-thawed soils. The northern circumpolar 
permafrost region occupies only 15% of the total global soil area,

but the 1035 Pg C adds another 50% to the rest of the 3 m soil 
carbon inventory (2050 Pg C for all global biomes excluding tundra 
and boreal; Jobbágy and Jackson, 2000; Schuur et al., 2015).
Substantial permafrost carbon exists below 3  m depth (medium 
conﬁdence). Deep carbon (>3 m) has been best quantiﬁed for the 
Yedoma region of Siberia and Alaska, characterised by wind- and 
water-moved permafrost sediments tens of meters thick. The Yedoma 
region covers a 1.4 × 106 km2 area that remained ice-free during the 
last Ice Age (Strauss et al., 2013) and accounts for 327–466 Pg C in 
deep sediment accumulations below 3 m (Strauss et al., 2017).
The current inventory has also highlighted additional carbon pools 
that are likely to be present but are so poorly quantiﬁed (low 
conﬁdence) that they cannot yet be added into the number reported 
above. There are deep terrestrial soil/sediment deposits outside of the 
Yedoma region that may contain about 400 Pg C (Schuur et al., 2015). 
An additional pool is organic carbon remaining in permafrost but that 
is now submerged on shallow Arctic sea shelves that were formerly 
exposed as terrestrial ecosystems during the Last Glacial Maximum 
~20,000 years ago (Walter et al., 2007). This permafrost is degrading 
slowly due to seawater intrusion, and it is not clear what amounts 
of permafrost and organic carbon still remain in the sediment versus 
what has already been converted to greenhouse gases. A  recent 
synthesis of permafrost extent for the Beaufort Sea shelf showed 
that most remaining subsea permafrost in that region exists near 
shore with much reduced area (high conﬁdence) as compared to 
original subsea permafrost maps that outlined the entire 3 × 106 km2 
shelf area (<120 m below sea level depth) that was formerly exposed 
as land (Ruppel et al., 2016). These observations are supported by 
similar studies in the Siberian Arctic Seas (Portnov et al., 2013), and 
by modelling that suggests that subsea permafrost would be thawed 
many meters below the seabed under current submerged conditions 
(Anisimov et al., 2012; AMAP, 2017d; Angelopoulos et al., 2019).
3.4.1.2.4 Drivers
Changes in temperature and precipitation act as gradual ‘press’ 
(i.e.,  continuous) disturbances that directly affect permafrost 
by modifying the ground thermal regime, as discussed in 
Section  3.4.1.2.1. Climate change can also modify the occurrence 
and magnitude of abrupt physical disturbances such as ﬁre, and 
soil subsidence and erosion resulting from ice rich permafrost thaw 
(thermokarst). These ‘pulse’ (i.e., discrete) disturbances (Smith et al., 
2009) often are part of the ongoing disturbance and successional 
cycle in Arctic and boreal ecosystems (Grosse et al., 2011), but 
changing rates of occurrence alter the landscape distribution of 
successional ecosystem states, with permafrost characteristics 
deﬁned by the ecosystem and climate state (Kanevskiy et al., 2013).
Pulse disturbances often rapidly remove the insulating soil organic 
layer, leading to permafrost degradation (Gibson et al., 2018). Of all 
pulse disturbance types, wildﬁre affects the most high-latitude land 
area annually at the continental scale. In some well-studied regions, 
there is high conﬁdence that area burned, ﬁre frequency and extreme 
ﬁre years are higher now than the ﬁrst half of the last century, or 
even the last 10,000 years (Kasischke and Turetsky, 2006; Flannigan 
et al., 2009; Kelly et al., 2013; Hanes et al., 2019). Recent climate 
warming has been linked to increased wildﬁre activity in the boreal 
forest regions in Alaska and western Canada where this has been 
studied (Gillett, 2004; Veraverbeke et al., 2017). Based on satellite 
imagery, an estimated 80,000 km2 of boreal area was burned 
globally per year from 1997 to 2011 (van der Werf et al., 2010; 
Giglio et al., 2013). Extreme ﬁre years in northwest Canada during 
2014 and Alaska during 2015 doubled the long-term (1997–2011) 
average area burned annually in this region (Canadian Forest Service, 
2017), surpassing Eurasia to contribute 60% of the global boreal 
area burned (van der Werf et al., 2010; Randerson et al., 2012; Giglio 
et al., 2013). These extreme North American ﬁre years were balanced 
by lower-than-average area burned in Eurasian forests, resulting in 
a 5% overall increase in global boreal area burned. The annual area 
burned in Arctic tundra is generally small compared to the forested 
boreal biome. In Alaska – the only region where estimates of burned 
area exist for both boreal forest and tundra vegetation types – tundra 
burning averaged approximately 270 km2 yr–1 during the last half 
century (French et al., 2015), accounting for 7% of the average annual 
area burned throughout the state (Pastick et al., 2017). There is high 
conﬁdence that changes in the ﬁre regime are degrading permafrost 
faster than had occurred over the historic successional cycle (Turetsky 
et al., 2011; Rupp et al., 2016; Pastick et al., 2017), and that the 
effect of this driver of permafrost change is under-represented in the 
permafrost temperature observation network.
Abrupt permafrost thaw occurs when changing environmental and 
ecological conditions interact with geomorphological processes. 
Melting ground ice causes the ground surface to subside. Pooling 
or ﬂowing water causes localised permafrost thaw and sometimes 
mass erosion. Together, these localised feedbacks can thaw through 
meters of permafrost within a short time, much more rapidly than 
would be caused by increasing air temperature alone. This process 
is a pulse disturbance to permafrost that can occur in response to 
climate, such as an extreme precipitation event (Balser et al., 2014; 
Kokelj et al., 2015), or coupled with other disturbances such as 
wildﬁre that affects the ground thermal regime (Jones et al., 2015a). 
There is medium conﬁdence in the importance of abrupt thaw for 
driving change in permafrost at the circumpolar scale because 
it occurs at point locations rather than continuously across the 
landscape, but the risk for widespread change from this mechanism 
remains high because of the rapidity of change in these locations 
(Kokelj et al., 2017; Nitze et al., 2018). New research at the global 
scale has revealed that 3.6 × 106 km2, about 20% of the northern 
permafrost region, appears to be vulnerable to abrupt thaw (Olefeldt 
et al., 2016).
3.4.1.3 
Freshwater Systems
There is increasing awareness of the inﬂuence of a changing climate 
on freshwater systems across the Arctic, and associated impacts 
on hydrological, biogeophysical and ecological processes (Prowse 
et al., 2015; Walvoord and Kurylyk, 2016), and northern populations 
(Takakura, 2018) (Section 3.4.3.3.1). Assessing these impacts requires 
consideration of complex interconnected processes, many of which are 
incompletely observed. The increasing imprint of human development,

such as ﬂow regulation on major northerly ﬂowing rivers adds 
complexity to the determination of climate-driven changes.
3.4.1.3.1 Freshwater ice
Long-term in situ river ice records indicate that the duration of ice 
cover in Russian Arctic rivers decreased by 7–20 days between 1955 
and 2012 (Shiklomanov and Lammers, 2014) (high conﬁdence). This 
is consistent with historical reductions in Arctic river ice cover derived 
from models (Park et al., 2015) and regional analysis of satellite data 
(Cooley and Pavelsky, 2016).
Analysis of satellite imagery between 2000 and 2013 identiﬁed 
a signiﬁcant trend of earlier spring ice break-up across all regions 
of the Arctic (Šmejkalová et al., 2016); independent satellite data 
showed approximately 80% of Arctic lakes experienced declines in 
ice cover duration during 2002–2015, due to both a later freeze-up 
and earlier break-up (Du et al., 2017) (high conﬁdence). There are 
indications that lake ice across Alaska has thinned in recent decades 
(Alexeev et al., 2016), but ice thickness trends are not available at 
the pan-Arctic scale. Analysis of satellite data over northern Alaska 
show that approximately one-third of bedfast lakes (the entire water 
volume freezes by the end of winter) experienced a regime change to 
ﬂoating ice over the 1992–2011 period (Surdu et al., 2014; Arp et al., 
2015). This can result in degradation of underlying permafrost (Arp 
et al., 2016; Bartsch et al., 2017). Lakes of the central and eastern 
Canadian High Arctic are transitioning from a perennial to seasonal 
ice regime (Surdu et al., 2016).
3.4.1.3.2 Runoff and surface water
A general trend of increasing discharge has been observed for large 
Siberian (Troy et al., 2012; Walvoord and Kurylyk, 2016) and Canadian 
(Ge et al., 2013; Déry et al., 2016) rivers that drain to the Arctic Ocean 
(medium conﬁdence). Between 1976 and 2017, trends are 3.3 ± 1.6% 
for Eurasian rivers and 2.0 ± 1.8% for North American rivers (Holmes 
et al., 2018) (Figure 3.10). Extreme regional runoff events have also 
been identiﬁed (Stuefer et al., 2017). An observed increase in baseﬂow 
in the North American (Walvoord and Striegl, 2007; St. Jacques and 
Sauchyn, 2009) and Eurasian Arctic (Smith et al., 2007; Duan et al., 
2017) over the last several decades is attributable to permafrost thaw 
and concomitant enhancement in groundwater discharge. The timing 
of spring season peak ﬂow is generally earlier (Ge et al., 2013; Holmes 
et al., 2015). There is consistent evidence of decreasing summer 
season discharge for the Yenisei, Lena, and Ob watersheds in Siberia 
(Ye et al., 2003; Yang et al., 2004a; Yang et al., 2004b) and the majority 
of northern Canadian rivers (Déry et al., 2016). Long-term records 
indicate water temperature increases (Webb et al., 2008; Yang and 
Peterson, 2017); attribution to rising air temperatures is complicated 
by the inﬂuence of reservoir regulation over Siberian regions (Liu 
et al., 2005; Lammers et al., 2007). Increases in discharge and water 
temperature in the spring season represent notable freshwater and 
heat ﬂuxes to the Arctic Ocean (Yang et al., 2014).
A large proportion of low-lying Arctic land areas are covered by 
lakes because permafrost limits surface water drainage and supports 
ponding even across areas with high moisture deﬁcits (Grosse 
et al., 2013). While thaw in continuous permafrost is linked to 
intensiﬁed thermokarst activity and subsequent ponding (resulting 
in lake/wetland expansion), observations of change in surface water 
coverage across the Arctic are regionally variable (Nitze et al., 2017; 
Ulrich et al., 2017; Pastick et al., 2019). In landscapes with degrading 
ice-wedge polygons, subsidence can reduce inundation, increase 
runoff, and decrease surface water (Liljedahl et al., 2016; Perreault 
et al., 2017). In discontinuous permafrost, thaw opens up pathways 
of subsurface ﬂow, improving the connection among inland water 
systems which supports the drainage of lakes and overall reduction 
in surface water cover (Jepsen et al., 2013). Enhanced subsurface 
connectivity from thaw in discontinuous permafrost serves tempers 
short-term lake ﬂuctuations (Rey et al., 2019).
3.4.1.3.3 Drivers
There is high conﬁdence that environmental drivers of Arctic surface 
water change are diverse and depend on local and regional factors 
such as permafrost properties and geomorphology (Nitze et al., 2018). 
Thermokarst lake expansion has been observed in the continuous 
permafrost of northern Siberia (Smith et al., 2005; Polishchuk et al., 
2015) and Alaska (Jones et al., 2011); surface water area reduction has 
been observed in discontinuous permafrost of central and southern 
Siberia (Smith et al., 2005; Sharonov et al., 2012), western Canada 
(Labrecque et al., 2009; Carroll et al., 2011; Lantz and Turner, 2015) 
and interior Alaska (Chen et al., 2012; Rover et al., 2012). Increased 
evaporation from warmer/longer summers, decreased recharge due 
to reductions in snow melt volume, and dynamic processes such as 
ice-jam ﬂooding (Chen et al., 2012; Bouchard et al., 2013; Jepsen 
et al., 2015) are important considerations for understanding observed 
surface water area change across the Arctic.
Satellite and model-derived estimates of evapotranspiration show 
increases across the Arctic (Rawlins et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2014; 
Liu et al., 2015b; Fujiwara et al., 2016; Suzuki et al., 2018) (medium 
conﬁdence). Increases in the seasonal active layer thickness impact 
temporary water storage and thus runoff regimes in drainage 
basins. Formation of taliks underneath lakes and rivers may result 
in reconnection of surface with sub-permafrost ground water 
aquifers with varying hydrological consequences depending on local 
geological and hydraulic settings (Wellman et al., 2013).
3.4.2 
Projections
3.4.2.1 
Seasonal Snow
Historical simulations from CMIP5 models tend to underestimate 
observed reductions in spring snow cover extent due to uncertainty 
in the parameterisation of snow processes (Essery, 2013; Thackeray 
et al., 2014), challenges in simulating snow-albedo feedback (Qu 
and Hall, 2014; Fletcher et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016b), unrealistic 
temperature sensitivity (Brutel-Vuilmet et al., 2013; Mudryk et al., 
2017), and biases in climatological spring snow cover (Thackeray 
et al., 2016). The role of precipitation biases is not well understood 
(Thackeray et al., 2016).
251
Polar Regions 
Chapter 3

Reductions in Arctic snow cover duration are projected by the CMIP5 
multi-model ensemble due to later snow onset in the autumn and 
earlier snow melt in spring (Brown et al., 2017) driven by increased 
surface temperature over essentially all Arctic land areas (Hartmann 
et al., 2013). There is high conﬁdence that projected snow cover declines 
are proportional to the amount of future warming in each model 
realisation (Thackeray et al., 2016; Mudryk et al., 2017). Projections to 
mid-century are primarily dependent on natural variability and model 
dependent uncertainties rather than the choice of forcing scenario 
(Hodson et al., 2013). By end of century, however, differences between 
scenarios emerge. Under RCP2.6 and RCP4.5, Arctic snow cover 
duration stabilises at 5–10% reduction (compared to a 1986–2005 
reference period); under RCP8.5, snow cover duration declines reach 
–15 to –25% (Brown et al., 2017) (Figure 3.10) (high conﬁdence).
Positive Arctic snow water equivalent changes emerge across the 
eastern Eurasian Arctic by mid-century for both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 
(Brown et al., 2017) (medium conﬁdence). Projected snow water 
equivalent increases across the North American Arctic are only 
modest, emerge later in the century, and only under RCP8.5 (Brown 
et al., 2017). These projected increases are due to enhanced snowfall 
(Krasting et al., 2013) from a more moisture-rich Arctic atmosphere 
coupled with winter season temperatures that remain sufﬁciently low 
for precipitation to fall as snow. There is low conﬁdence in changes 
to snow properties such as density and stratigraphy (relevant for 
understanding the impacts of changes to Arctic snow on ecosystems) 
which are not resolved directly by climate model simulations, but 
require detailed snow physics models.
3.4.2.2 
Permafrost
Circumpolar- 
or 
global-scale 
models 
represent 
permafrost 
degradation in response to warming scenarios as increases in 
thaw depth only. The CMIP5 models project with high conﬁdence 
that thaw depth will increase and areal extent of near-surface 
permafrost will decrease substantially (Koven et al., 2013; Slater 
and Lawrence, 2013) (Figure 3.10). However, there is only medium 
conﬁdence in the magnitude of these changes due to at least a ﬁve-
fold range of estimated present day near-surface permafrost area 
(<5 – >25 × 106 km2) by these models. This was caused by a wide 
range of model sensitivity in permafrost area to air temperature 
change, resulting in a large range of projected near-surface permafrost 
loss by 2100: 2–66% for RCP2.6 (24 ± 16%; likely range), 15–87% 
under RCP4.5 and 30–99% (69 ± 20%; likely range) under RCP8.5. 
A  more recent analysis of near-surface permafrost trends from 
a subset of models that self-identiﬁed as structurally representing 
the permafrost region had a signiﬁcantly smaller range of estimated 
present day near-surface permafrost area (13.1–19.3 ×  106 km2; 
mean ± SD, 14.1 ± 3.5 × 106 km2) (McGuire et al., 2018). This subset 
of models also showed large reductions of near-surface permafrost 
area, averaging a 90% loss (12.7 ± 5.1 × 106 km2) of permafrost area 
by 2300 for RCP8.5 and 29% loss (4.1 ± 0.6 × 106 km2) for RCP4.5, 
with much of that long-term loss already occurring by 2100.
Pulse disturbances are not included in the permafrost projections 
described above, and there is high conﬁdence that ﬁre and abrupt 
thaw will accelerate change in permafrost relative to climate effects 
alone, if the rates of these disturbances increase. The observed 
trend of increasing ﬁre is projected to continue for the rest of the 
century across most of the tundra and boreal region for many climate 
scenarios, with the boreal region projected to have the greatest 
increase in total area burned (Balshi et al., 2009; Kloster et al., 2012; 
Wotton et al., 2017). Due to vegetation-climate interactions, there is 
only medium conﬁdence in projections of future area burned. As ﬁre 
activity increases, ﬂammable vegetation, such as the black spruce 
forest that dominates boreal Alaska, is projected to decline as it is 
replaced by low-ﬂammability deciduous forest (Johnstone et al., 2011; 
Pastick et al., 2017). In other regions such as western Canada, by 
contrast, black spruce could be replaced by the even more ﬂammable 
jack pine, creating regional-scale feedbacks that increase the spread 
of ﬁre on the landscape (Héon et al., 2014). A regional process-model 
study of Alaska projected annual median area burned during the 
21st century to be 1.3–1.7 times higher compared with the historical 
average (Pastick et al., 2017). Fire also appears to be expanding as 
a novel disturbance into tundra and forest-tundra boundary regions 
previously protected by a cool, moist climate (Jones et al., 2009; Hu 
et al., 2010; Hu et al., 2015) (medium conﬁdence). Annual tundra area 
burned in Alaska is projected to double under RCP6.0 from a historic 
rate of 270 km2 yr–1 to 500–610 km2 yr–1 over the 21st century (Hu 
et al., 2015). A statistical approach projected a fourfold increase in the 
30-year probability of ﬁre occurrence in the forest-tundra boundary 
by 2100 (Young et al., 2017). In contrast to ﬁre, there has not yet 
been a comprehensive circumpolar projection of how abrupt thaw 
rates may change in the future, but one component of abrupt thaw, 
change in abrupt thaw lake area, has been projected to increase to 
increase by 53% under RCP8.5 (Walter Anthony et al., 2018) above 
the 1.4 × 106 km2 of small lakes and ponds that currently exist in 
the permafrost region (Muster et al., 2017). As a result, there is low 
conﬁdence in the ability to assess the magnitude by which abrupt 
thaw across the entire landscape will affect regional permafrost, 
even though this mechanism for rapid change appears critically 
important for projecting future change (Kokelj et al., 2017). 
3.4.2.3 
Freshwater Systems
Climate model simulations project a  warmer and wetter Arctic 
(Krasting et al., 2013), with increased speciﬁc humidity due to 
enhanced evaporation (Laîné et al., 2014), and moisture ﬂux 
convergence increases into the Arctic (Skiﬁc and Francis, 2013). 
Increased cold-season precipitation is projected across the Arctic 
by CMIP5 models (Lique et al., 2016) due to increased moisture 
ﬂux convergence from outside the Arctic (Zhang et al., 2012) and 
enhanced moisture availability from reduced sea ice cover (Bintanja 
and Selten, 2014) (high conﬁdence). Increases in precipitation 
extremes are also projected over northern watersheds (Kharin 
et al., 2013; Sillmann et al., 2013), while rain on snow events are 
expected to increase (Hansen et al., 2014). A net increased ratio of 
precipitation minus evaporation is projected, resulting in increased 
freshwater ﬂux from the land surface to the Arctic Ocean, projected 
to be 30% above current values by 2100 under RCP4.5 (Haine et al., 
2015) (Figure 3.10). This is consistent with CMIP5 model projections 
of increased discharge from Arctic watersheds (van Vliet et al., 2013; 
Gelfan et al., 2016; MacDonald et al., 2018). The water temperature 
of this increased discharge is projected to be approximately 1ºC 
252

warmer than current conditions, increasing the heat ﬂux to Arctic 
Ocean (van Vliet et al., 2013).
Lake ice phenology is sensitive to projected changes in surface 
temperature (Sharma et al., 2019). Lake ice models project an earlier 
spring break-up of between 10–25 days by mid-century (compared 
with 1961–1990), and up to a  15-day delay in the freeze-up for 
lakes in the North American Arctic, with more extreme reductions for 
coastal regions (Brown and Duguay, 2011; Dibike et al., 2011; Prowse 
et al., 2011) (medium conﬁdence). Mean maximum ice thickness is 
projected to decrease by 10–50 cm over the same period (Brown and 
Duguay, 2011). High-latitude warming is projected to drive earlier 
river ice break-up in spring due to both decreasing ice strength, and 
earlier onset of peak discharge (Cooley and Pavelsky, 2016). Complex 
interplay between hydrology and hydraulics in controlling spring 
ﬂooding and ice jam events complicate projections of these events 
(Prowse et al., 2010; Prowse et al., 2011).
3.4.3 
Consequences and Impacts
3.4.3.1 
Global Climate Feedbacks
3.4.3.1.1 Carbon cycle
Climate warming is expected to change the storage of carbon in 
vegetation and soils in northern regions, and net carbon transferred 
to the atmosphere as CO2 and methane acts as a  feedback to 
accelerate global climate change. There is high conﬁdence that the 
northern region acted as a net carbon sink as carbon accumulated in 
terrestrial ecosystems over the Holocene (Loisel et al., 2014; Lindgren 
et al., 2018). There is medium evidence with low agreement whether 
changing climate in the modern period has shifted these ecosystems 
into net carbon sources. Syntheses of ecosystem CO2 ﬂuxes have 
alternately showed tundra ecosystems as carbon sinks or neutral 
averaged across the circumpolar region for the 1990s and 2000s 
(McGuire et al., 2012), or carbon sources over the same time period 
(Belshe et al., 2013). Both syntheses agree that the summer growing 
season is a period of net carbon uptake into terrestrial ecosystems 
(high conﬁdence), and this uptake appears to be increasing as 
a function of vegetation density/biomass (Ueyama et al., 2013). The 
discrepancy between these syntheses may be a result of CO2 release 
rates during the non-summer season that are now thought to be 
higher than previously estimated (high conﬁdence) (Webb et al., 2016) 
or the separation of upland and wetland ecosystem types, which was 
done in one synthesis but not the other. Moisture status is a primary 
control over ecosystem carbon sink/source strength with wetlands 
more often than not still acting as annual net carbon sinks even while 
methane is emitted (Lund et al., 2010). Recent aircraft measurements 
of atmospheric CO2 concentrations over Alaska showed that 
tundra regions of Alaska were a consistent net CO2 source to the 
atmosphere, whereas boreal forest regions were either neutral or net 
CO2 sinks for the period 2012–2014 (Commane et al., 2017). That 
study region as a whole was estimated to be a net carbon source of 
4 
For context, total annual anthropogenic CO2 emissions were 10.8 ± 0.8 GtC yr–1 (39.6 ± 2.9 GtCO2 yr–1) on average over the period 2008–2017. Total annual anthropogenic 
methane emissions were 0.35 ± 0.01 GtCH4 yr–1, on average over the period 2003–2012 (Saunois et al., 2016; Le Quéré et al., 2018).
25 ± 14 Tg CO2-C yr–1 averaged over the land area of both biomes for 
the entire study period. For comparison to projected global emissions, 
this would be equivalent to a net source of 0.3 Pg CO2-C yr–1 assuming 
the Alaska study region (1.6 × 106 km2) could be scaled to the entire 
northern circumpolar permafrost region soil area (17.8 × 106 km2).
The permafrost soil carbon pool is climate sensitive and an order of 
magnitude larger than carbon stored in plant biomass (Schuur et al., 
2018) (very high conﬁdence). Initial estimates were converging on 
a range of cumulative emissions from soils to the atmosphere by 
2100, but recent studies have actually widened that range somewhat 
(Figure 3.11) (medium conﬁdence). Expert assessment and laboratory 
soil incubation studies suggest that substantial quantities of C (tens to 
hundreds Pg C) could potentially be transferred from the permafrost 
carbon pool into the atmosphere under RCP8.5 (Schuur et al., 2013; 
Schädel et al., 2014)4. Global dynamical models supported these 
ﬁndings, showing potential carbon release from the permafrost zone 
ranging from 37–174 Pg C  by 2100 under high emission climate 
warming trajectories, with an average across models of 92 ± 17 Pg C 
(mean ± SE) (Zhuang et al., 2006; Koven et al., 2011; Schaefer et al., 
2011; MacDougall et al., 2012; Burke et al., 2013; Schaphoff et al., 
2013; Schneider von Deimling et al., 2015). This range is generally 
consistent with several newer data-driven modelling approaches that 
estimated that soil carbon releases by 2100 (for RCP8.5) will be 57 
Pg C (Koven et al., 2015) and 87 Pg C (Schneider von Deimling et al., 
2015), as well as an updated estimate of 102 Pg C from one of the 
previous models (MacDougall and Knutti, 2016). However, the latest 
model runs performed with either structural enhancements to better 
represent permafrost carbon dynamics (Burke et al., 2017a), or common 
environmental input data (McGuire et al., 2016) show similar soil carbon 
losses, but also indicate the potential for stimulated plant growth 
(nutrients, temperature/growing season length, CO2 fertilisation) to 
offset some (Kleinen and Brovkin, 2018) or all of these losses, at least 
during this century, by sequestering new carbon into plant biomass and 
increasing carbon inputs into the surface soil (McGuire et al., 2018). 
These future carbon emission levels would be a signiﬁcant fraction of 
those projected from fossil fuels with implications for allowable carbon 
budgets that are consistent with limiting global warming, but will also 
depend on how vegetation responds (high conﬁdence). Furthermore, 
there is high conﬁdence that climate scenarios that involve mitigation 
(e.g., RCP4.5) will help to dampen the response of carbon emissions 
from the Arctic and boreal regions.
Northern ecosystems contribute signiﬁcantly to the global methane 
budget, but there is low conﬁdence about the degree to which 
additional methane from northern lakes, ponds, wetland ecosystems, 
and the shallow Arctic Ocean shelves is currently contributing to 
increasing atmospheric concentrations. Analyses of atmospheric 
concentrations in Alaska concluded that local ecosystems surrounding 
the observation site have not changed in the exchange of methane 
from the 1980s until the present, which suggests that either the local 
wetland ecosystems are responding similarly to other northern wetland 
ecosystems, or that increasing atmospheric methane concentrations 
in northern observation sites is derived from methane coming from 
253
Polar Regions

mid-latitudes (Sweeney et al., 2016). However, this contrasts with 
indirect integrated estimates of methane emissions from observations 
of expanding permafrost thaw lakes that suggest a  release of an 
additional 1.6–5 Tg CH4 yr–1 over the last 60 years (Walter Anthony 
et al., 2014). At the same time, there is high conﬁdence that methane 
ﬂuxes at the ecosystem to regional scale have been under-observed, in 
part due to the low solubility of methane in water leading to ebullution 
(bubbling) ﬂux to the atmosphere that is heterogeneous in time 
and space. Some new quantiﬁcations include: cold-season methane 
emissions that can be >50% of the annual budget of terrestrial 
ecosystems (Zona et al., 2016); geological methane seeps that may 
be climate sensitive if permafrost currently serves as a cap preventing 
atmospheric release (Walter Anthony et al., 2012; Ruppel and Kessler, 
2016; Kohnert et al., 2017); estimates of shallow Arctic Ocean shelf 
methane emissions where the range of estimates based on methane 
concentrations in air and water has widened with more observations 
and now ranges from 3 Tg CH4 yr–1 (Thornton et al., 2016) to 17 Tg 
CH4 yr–1 (Shakhova et al., 2013). Observations such as these underlie 
the fact that source estimates for methane made from atmospheric 
observations are typically lower than methane source estimates made 
from upscaling of ground observations (e.g., Berchet et al., 2016), and 
this problem has not improved, even at the global scale, over several 
decades of research (Saunois et al., 2016; Crill and Thornton, 2017).
In many of the dynamical model projections previously discussed, 
methane release is not explicitly represented because ﬂuxes are 
small even though higher global warming potential of methane 
makes these emissions relatively more important than on a  mass 
basis alone. Global models that do include methane show that 
emissions may already (from 2000 to 2012) be increasing at a rate 
of  1.2 Tg CH4 yr–1 in the northern region as a  direct response 
to temperature (Riley et al., 2011; Gao et al., 2013; Poulter et al., 
2017). A  model intercomparison study forecast northern methane 
emissions to increase from 18 Tg CH4 yr–1 to 42 Tg CH4 yr–1 under 
RCP8.5 by 2100 largely as a result of an increase in wetland extent 
(Zhang et al., 2017). However, projected methane emissions are 
sensitive to changes in surface hydrology (Lawrence et al., 2015) and 
a suite of models that were thought to perform well in high-latitude 
ecosystems showed a general soil drying trend even as the overall 
water cycle intensiﬁed (McGuire et al., 2018). Furthermore, most 
models described above do not include many of the abrupt thaw 
processes that can result in lake expansion, wetland formation, and 
massive erosion and exposure to decomposition of previously frozen 
carbon-rich permafrost, leading to medium conﬁdence in future 
model projections of methane. Recent studies that addressed some 
of these landscape controls over future emissions projected increases 
in methane above the current levels on the order 10–60 Tg CH4 yr–1 
under RCP8.5 by 2100 (Schuur et al., 2013; Koven et al., 2015; 
Lawrence et al., 2015; Schneider von Deimling et al., 2015; Walter 
Anthony et al., 2018). These additional methane ﬂuxes are projected 
to cause 40–70% of total permafrost-affected radiative forcing in 
this century even though methane emissions are much less than CO2 
by mass (Schneider von Deimling et al., 2015; Walter Anthony et al., 
2018). As with total carbon emissions, there is high conﬁdence that 
mitigation of anthropogenic methane sources could help to dampen 
the impact of increased methane emissions from the Arctic and 
boreal regions (Christensen et al., 2019).
3.4.3.1.2 Energy budget
Warming induced reductions in the duration and extent of Arctic 
spring snow cover (Section 3.4.1.1) lower albedo because snow-free 
land reﬂects much less solar radiation than snow. The corresponding 
increase in net radiation absorption at the surface provides a positive 
feedback to global temperatures (Flanner et al., 2011; Qu and Hall, 
2014; Thackeray and Fletcher, 2016) (high conﬁdence). Estimates of 
increases in global net solar energy ﬂux due to snow cover loss range 
from 0.10–0.22 W m–2 (± 50%; medium conﬁdence) depending on 
dataset and time period (Flanner et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2015; Singh 
et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2016b). Sources of uncertainty include the 
range in observed spring snow cover extent trends (Hori et al., 2017) 
and the inﬂuence of clouds on shortwave feedbacks (Sedlar, 2018; 
Sledd and  L’Ecuyer, 2019). Terrestrial snow changes also affect the 
longwave energy budget via altered surface emissivity (Huang et al., 
2018). Climate model simulations show that changes in snow cover 
dominate land surface related positive feedbacks to atmospheric 
heating (Euskirchen et al., 2016), but regional variations in surface 
albedo are also inﬂuenced by vegetation (Loranty et al., 2014). There is 
evidence for positive sensitivity of surface temperatures to increased 
northern hemisphere boreal and tundra leaf area index, which 
contributes a positive feedback to warming (Forzieri et al., 2017). 
3.4.3.2 
Ecosystems and their Services
3.4.3.2.1 Vegetation
Changes in tundra vegetation can have important ecosystem effects, 
in particular on hydrology, carbon and nutrient cycling and surface 
energy balance, which together impact permafrost (e.g., Myers-Smith 
and Hik, 2013; Frost and Epstein, 2014; Nauta et al., 2014). Aside 
from physical impacts, changing vegetation inﬂuences the diversity 
and abundance of herbivores (e.g., Fauchald et al., 2017b; Horstkotte 
et al., 2017) in the Arctic. The overall trend for tundra vegetation 
across the 36–year satellite period (1982–2017) shows increasing 
above ground biomass (greening) throughout a  majority of the 
circumpolar Arctic (high conﬁdence) (Xu et al., 2013a; Ju and Masek, 
2016; Bhatt et al., 2017). Increasing greenness has been in some cases 
linked with shifts in plant species dominance away from graminoids 
(grasses and sedges) towards shrubs (high conﬁdence) (Myers-Smith 
et al., 2015). Within the overall trend of increases (greening), some 
tundra areas show declines (browning) (Bhatt et al.,2017).
The spatial variation in greening and browning trends in tundra 
are also not consistent over time (decadal scale) and can vary 
across landform/ecosystem types (Lara et al., 2018), suggesting 
interactions between the changing environment and the biological 
components of the system that control these trends. There is high 
conﬁdence that increases in summer, spring and winter temperatures 
lead to tundra greening, as well as increases in growing season 
length (e.g., Vickers et al., 2016; Myers-Smith and Hik, 2018) that 
are in part linked to reductions in Arctic Ocean sea ice cover (Bhatt 
et al., 2017; Macias-Fauria et al., 2017). Other factors that stimulate 
tundra greening include increases in snow water equivalent and soil 
moisture (Westergaard-Nielsen et al., 2017), increases in active layer 
thickness (via nutrient availability or changes in moisture), changes 
254

in herbivore activity, and to a lesser degree, human use of the land 
(e.g., Salmon et al., 2016; Horstkotte et al., 2017; Martin et al., 2017; 
Yu et al., 2017). Research on tundra browning is more limited but 
suggests causal mechanisms that include changes in winter climate – 
speciﬁcally reductions in snow cover due to winter warming events 
that expose tundra to subsequent freezing and desiccation – , insect 
and pathogen outbreaks, increased herbivore grazing and ground ice 
melting and subsidence that increases surface water (Phoenix and 
Bjerke, 2016; Bjerke et al., 2017) (medium conﬁdence).
Projections of tundra vegetation distribution across the Arctic by 
2050 in response to changing environmental conditions suggest 
that the areal extent of most tundra types will decrease by at least 
50% (Pearson et al., 2013) (medium conﬁdence). Woody shrubs and 
trees are projected to expand to cover 24–52% of the current tundra 
region by 2050, or 12–33% if tree dispersal is restricted. Adding 
to this, the expansion of ﬁre into tundra that has not experienced 
large-scale disturbance for centuries causes large reductions in soil 
carbon stocks (Mack et al., 2011), shifts in vegetation composition 
and productivity (Bret-Harte et al., 2013), and can lead to widespread 
permafrost degradation (Jones et al., 2015a) at faster rates than 
would occur by changing environmental conditions alone. In tundra 
regions, graminoid (grasses and sedges) tundra is projected to be 
replaced by more ﬂammable shrub tundra in future climate scenarios, 
and tree migration into tundra could further increase fuel loading 
(Pastick et al., 2017) (medium conﬁdence).
Similar to tundra, boreal forest vegetation shows trends of both 
greening and browning over multiple years in different regions across 
the satellite record (Beck and Goetz, 2011; Ju and Masek, 2016) (high 
conﬁdence). Here, patterns of changing vegetation are a result of 
direct responses to changes in climate (temperature, precipitation 
and seasonality) and other driving factors for vegetation (nutrients, 
disturbance) similar to what has been reported in tundra. While boreal 
forest may expand at the northern edge (Pearson et al., 2013), climate 
projections suggest that it could diminish at the southern edge and 
be replaced by lower biomass woodland/shrublands (Koven, 2013; 
Gauthier et al., 2015) (medium conﬁdence). Furthermore, changes in 
ﬁre disturbance are leading to shifts in landscape distribution of early 
and late successional ecosystem types, which is also a major factor in 
satellite trends. Fires that burn deeply into the organic soil layer can 
alter permafrost stability, hydrology and vegetation. Loss of the soil 
organic layer exposes mineral soil seedbeds (Johnstone et al., 2009), 
leading to recruitment of deciduous tree and shrub species that do 
not establish on organic soil (Johnstone et al., 2010). This recruitment 
has been shown to shift post-ﬁre vegetation to alternate successional 
trajectories (Johnstone et al., 2010). Model projections suggest that 
Alaskan boreal forest soon may cross a point where recent increases 
in ﬁre activity have made deciduous stands as abundant as spruce 
stands on the landscape (Mann et al., 2012) (medium conﬁdence). 
This projected trend of increasing deciduous forest at the expense 
of evergreen forest is mirrored in Russian and Chinese boreal forests 
as well (Shakhova et al., 2013; Shuman et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2017) 
(medium conﬁdence).

3.4.3.2.2 Wildlife
Reindeer and caribou (Rangifer tarandus), through their numbers and 
ecological role as a large-bodied herbivores, are a key driver of Arctic 
ecology. The seasonal migrations that characterise Rangifer link 
the coastal tundra to the continental boreal forests for some herds, 
while others live year-round on the tundra. Population estimates and 
trends exist for most herds, and indicate that pan-Arctic migratory 
tundra Rangifer have declined from about 5 million in the 1990s to 
about 2 million in 2017 (Gunn, 2016; Fauchald et al., 2017a) (high 
conﬁdence). Numbers have recently increased for two Alaska herds 
and the Porcupine caribou herd straddling Yukon and Alaska is at 
a historic high.
There is low conﬁdence in understanding the complex drivers of 
observed Rangifer changes. Hunting and predation (the latter 
exacerbated by modiﬁcation of the landscape for exploration and 
resource extraction; Dabros et al., 2018) increase in importance 
as populations decline. Climate strongly inﬂuences productivity: 
extremes in heat, drought, winter icing and snow depth reduce 
Rangifer survival (Mallory and Boyce, 2017). Changes in the timing 
of sea ice formation have direct effects on risks during Rangifer 
migration via inter-island movement and connection to the mainland 
(Poole et al., 2010). Summer warming is changing the composition 
of tundra plant communities, modifying the relationship between 
climate, forage and Rangifer (Albon et al., 2017), which also impacts 
other Arctic species such as musk ox (Ovibos moschatus) (Schmidt 
et al., 2015). As polar trophic systems are highly connected (Schmidt 
et al., 2017), changes will propagate through the ecosystem with 
effects on other herbivores such as geese and voles, as well as 
predators such as wolves (Hansen et al., 2013; Klaczek et al., 2016).
In northern Fennoscandia, there are approximately 600,000 
semi-domesticated reindeer. Lichen rangelands are key to sustaining 
reindeer carrying capacity, with variable response to climate change: 
enhanced summer precipitation increases lichen biomass, while an 
increase in winter precipitation lowers it (Kumpula et al., 2014). Fire 
disturbance reduces the amount of pasture available for domestic 
reindeer and increases predation on herding lands (Lavrillier and 
Gabyshev, 2017). Later ice formation on waterbodies can impact 
herding activities (Turunen et al., 2016). Ice formation from rain-on-
snow events is associated with population changes including cases 
of catastrophic mass starvation (Bartsch et al., 2010; Forbes et al., 
2016), but there is no evidence of trends in rain-on-snow events 
(Cohen et al., 2015; Dolant et al., 2017).
Management of keystone species requires an understanding of 
pathogens and disease in the context of climate warming, but evidence 
of changing patterns across northern ecosystems (spanning terrestrial, 
aquatic, and marine environments) is hindered by an incomplete 
picture of pathogen diversity and distribution (Hoberg, 2013; Jenkins 
et al., 2013; Cook et al., 2017). Among ungulates, it is virtually certain 
that the emergence of disease attributed to nematode pathogens has 
accelerated since 2000 in the Canadian Arctic islands and Fennoscandia 
(Kutz et al., 2013; Hoberg and Brooks, 2015; Laaksonen et al., 2017; 
Kaﬂe et al., 2018). Discovery of the pathogenic bacterium Erysipelothrix 
rhusiopathiae has been linked to massive and widespread mortality 
among muskoxen from the Canadian Arctic Archipelago; loss of >50% 
of the population since 2010 may be attributable to disease interacting 
with extreme temperature events, although unequivocal links to 
climate have not been established (Kutz et al., 2015; Forde et al., 
2016a; Forde et al., 2016b). Anthrax is projected to expand northward 
in response to warming, and resulted in substantial mortality events for 
reindeer on the Yamal Peninsula of Russia in 2016 with mobilisation of 
bacteria possibly from a frozen reindeer carcass or melting permafrost 
(Walsh et al., 2018). In concert with climate forcing, pathogens are 
very likely responsible for increasing mortality in Arctic ungulates 
(muskox, caribou/reindeer) and alteration of transmission patterns in 
marine food chains, broadly threatening sustainability of subsistence 
and commercial hunting and ﬁshing and safety of traditional foods 
for northern cultures at high latitudes (Jenkins et al., 2013; Kutz et al., 
2014; Hoberg et al., 2017).
3.4.3.2.3 Freshwater
Climate-driven changes in seasonal ice and permafrost conditions 
inﬂuence water quality (high conﬁdence). Shortened duration of 
freshwater ice cover (more light absorption, increased nutrient 
input) is expected to result in higher primary productivity (Hodgson 
and Smol, 2008; Vincent et al., 2011; Grifﬁths et al., 2017b) and 
may also encourage greater methane emissions from Arctic lakes 
(Greene et al., 2014; Tan and Zhuang, 2015). Thaw slumps, active 
layer detachments and peat plateau collapse affect surface water 
connectivity (Connon et al., 2014) and enhance sediment, particulate 
and solute ﬂuxes in river and stream networks (Kokelj et al., 2013). 
The transfer of enhanced nutrients from land to water (driven by 
active layer thickening and thermokarst processes; Abbott et al., 
2015; Vonk et al., 2015) has been linked to heightened autotrophic 
productivity in freshwater ecosystems (Wrona et al., 2016). Still, there 
is low conﬁdence in the inﬂuence of permafrost changes on dissolved 
organic carbon, because of competing mechanisms that inﬂuence 
carbon export. Permafrost thaw could contribute to the mobilisation of 
previously frozen organic carbon (Abbott et al., 2014; Wickland et al., 
2018; Walvoord et al., 2019) thereby enhancing both particulate and 
dissolved organic carbon export to aquatic systems. Increased delivery 
of this dissolved carbon from enhanced river discharge to the Arctic 
Ocean (Section 3.4.3.1.2) can exacerbate regionally extreme aragonite 
undersaturation of shelf waters (Semiletov et al., 2016) driven by 
ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2 (Section 3.2.1.2.4). Conversely, 
reduced dissolved organic carbon export could accompany permafrost 
thaw as (1) water inﬁltrates deeper and has longer residence times 
for decomposition (Striegl et al., 2005) and (2) the proportion of 
groundwater (typically lower in dissolved organic carbon and higher 
in DIC than runoff) to total streamﬂow increases (Walvoord and 
Striegl, 2007). Increased thermokarst also has the potential to impact 
freshwater cycling of inorganic carbon (Zolkos et al., 2018).
Enhanced subsurface water ﬂuxes resulting from permafrost 
degradation has consequences for inorganic natural and anthropogenic 
constituents. Emerging evidence suggests large natural stores of 
mercury (Schuster et al., 2018; St Pierre et al., 2018) and other trace 
elements in permafrost (Colombo et al., 2018) may be released upon 
thaw, thereby having effects (largely unknown at this point) on aquatic 
ecosystems. In parallel, increased development activity in the Arctic is 
256

likely to lead to enhanced local sources of anthropogenic chemicals 
of emerging Arctic concern, including siloxanes, parabens, ﬂame 
retardants, and per- and polyﬂuoroalkyl substances (AMAP, 2017c). 
For legacy pollutants, there is high conﬁdence that black carbon 
and persistent organic pollutants (e.g.,  hexachlorocyclohexanes, 
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and polychlorinated biphenyls) can 
be transferred downstream and affect water quality (Hodson, 2014). 
Lakes can become sinks of these contaminants, while ﬂoodplains can 
be contaminated (Sharma et al.,2015).
There is high conﬁdence that habitat loss or change due to climate 
change impact Arctic ﬁshes. Thinning ice on lakes and streams 
changes the overwintering habitat for aquatic fauna by impacting 
winter water volumes and dissolved oxygen levels (Leppi et al., 2016). 
Surface water loss, reduced surface water connectivity among aquatic 
habitats, and changes to the timing and magnitude of seasonal ﬂows 
(Section 3.4.1.2) result in a direct loss of spawning, feeding, or rearing 
habitats (Poesch et al., 2016). Changes to permafrost landscapes 
have reduced freshwater habitat available for ﬁsh and other aquatic 
biota, including aquatic invertebrates upon which the ﬁsh depend 
for food (Chin et al., 2016). Gullying deepens channels (Rowland 
et al., 2011; Liljedahl et al., 2016) that otherwise may connect lake 
habitats occupied by ﬁshes. This can lead to the loss of surface water 
connectivity, limit ﬁsh access to key habitats, and lower ﬁsh diversity 
(Haynes et al., 2014; Laske et al., 2016). Small connecting stream 
channels, which are vulnerable to drying, provide necessary migratory 
pathways for ﬁshes, allowing them to access spawning and summer 
rearing grounds (Heim et al., 2016; McFarland et al., 2017).
Changes to the timing, duration and magnitude of high surface ﬂow 
events in early and late summer threaten Arctic ﬁsh dispersal and 
migration activities (Heim et al., 2016) (high conﬁdence). Timing 
of important life history events such as spawning can become 
mismatched with changing stream ﬂows (Lique et al., 2016). 
There is regional evidence that migration timing has shifted earlier 
and winter egg incubation temperature has increased for pink 
salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha), directly related to warming 
(Taylor, 2007). While long-term, pan-Arctic data on run timing of 
ﬁshes are limited, phenological shifts could create mismatches 
with food availability or habitat suitability in both marine and 
freshwater environments for anadromous species, and in freshwater 
environments for freshwater resident species. Changes to the Arctic 
growing season (Xu et al., 2013a) increase the risk of drying of 
surface water habitats and pose a potential mismatch in seasonal 
availability of food in rearing habitats.
Freshwater systems across the Arctic are relatively shallow, and 
thus are expected to warm (high conﬁdence). This may make some 
surface waters inhospitably warm for cold water species such as 
Arctic Grayling (Thymallus arcticus) and whiteﬁshes (Coregonus 
spp.), or may increase the risk of Saprolegnia fungus that appears 
to have recently spread rapidly, infecting whiteﬁshes at much higher 
rates in Arctic Alaska than noted in the past (Sformo et al., 2017). 
High infection rates may be driven by stress or nutrient enrichment 
from thawing permafrost, which increases pathogen virulence with 
ﬁsh (Wedekind et al., 2010). Warmer water and longer growing 
seasons will also affect food abundance because invertebrate life 
histories and production are temperature and degree-day dependent 
(Régnière et al., 2012). Increased nutrient export from permafrost 
loss (Frey et al., 2007), facilitated by warmer temperatures, will likely 
increase food resources for consumers, but the impact on lower 
trophic levels within food webs is not clearly understood.
Box 3.4 |  Impacts and Risks for Polar Biodiversity from Range Shifts and Species Invasions 
Related to Climate Change
In polar regions climate-induced changes in terrestrial, ocean and sea ice environments, together with human introduction of non-native 
species, have expanded the range of some temperate species and contracted the range of some polar ﬁsh and ice-associated species 
(Section 3.2.3.2; Duffy et al., 2017) (high conﬁdence for detection, medium conﬁdence for attribution). In some cases, spatial shifts 
in distribution have also been inﬂuenced by ﬂuctuations in population abundance linked to climate-induced impacts on reproductive 
success (Section 3.2.3). These changes have the potential to alter biodiversity in polar marine and terrestrial ecosystems (Frenot et al., 
2005; Frederiksen, 2017; McCarthy et al., 2019) (medium conﬁdence).
Ongoing climate change induced reductions in suitable habitat for Arctic sea ice afﬁliated endemic marine mammals is an 
escalating threat (Section 3.2.3.1) (high conﬁdence). This is further complicated by the northward expansion of the summer ranges 
of a variety of temperate whale species, documented recently in both the Paciﬁc and Atlantic sides of the Arctic (Brower et al., 2017; 
Storrie et al., 2018) and increasing pressure from anthropogenic activities. Also, over the recent decade a northward shift in benthic 
species, with subsequent changes in community composition has been detected in both the northern Bering Sea (Grebmeier, 2012), off 
Western Greenland (Renaud et al., 2015) and the Barents Sea (Kortsch et al., 2012) (medium conﬁdence). At the same time as these 
northward expansions or shifts, a number of populations of species as different as polar bear and Arctic char show range contraction 
or population declines (Winﬁeld et al., 2010; Bromaghin et al., 2015; Laidre et al., 2018).
In the Arctic a number of ﬁsh species have changed their spatial distribution substantially over the recent decades (high conﬁdence). 
The most pronounced recent range expansion into the Arctic may be that of the summer feeding distribution of the temperate 
Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus) in the Nordic Seas. From 1997 to 2016 the total area occupied by this large stock expanded  
from 0.4 to 2.5 million km2 and the centre-of-gravity of distribution shifted westward by 1650 km and northward by 400 km (Olafsdottir

et al., 2019), far into Icelandic and Greenland waters and even up to Svalbard (Berge et al., 2015; Jansen et al., 2016; Nøttestad et al., 
2016). This range expansion was linked both to a pronounced increase in stock size and warming of the ocean (Berge et al., 2015; 
Olafsdottir et al., 2019) (high conﬁdence). Under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 further range expansions of mackerel are projected in Greenland 
waters (Jansen et al., 2016) (medium conﬁdence). However, further northwards expansion of planktivorous species may generally be 
restricted by them not being adapted to lack of primary production during winter (Sundby et al., 2016). Range shifts have also been 
observed in the Bering Sea since 1993, with warm bottom temperatures being associated with range contractions of Arctic species, 
and range expansions of sub-arctic species, with responses dependent on species speciﬁc vulnerably (Alabia et al., 2018; Stevenson 
and Lauth, 2018).
In the Barents Sea, major expansions in distribution over the recent years to decades have been well documented for both 
individual species and whole biological communities (high conﬁdence). New information strengthens ﬁndings reported in WGII AR5 
of ecologically and commercially important ﬁsh stocks having extended their habitats markedly to the north and east, concomitant 
to increased sea temperature and retreating sea ice. This includes capelin (Ingvaldsen and Gjøsæter, 2013), Atlantic cod (Kjesbu 
et al., 2014) and haddock (Landa et al., 2014). Of even greater importance is novel evidence of distinct distributional changes at the 
community level (Fossheim et al., 2015; Kortsch et al., 2015; Frainer et al., 2017) (Box 3.4 Figure 1). Until recently, the northern Barents 
Sea was dominated by small-sized, slow-growing ﬁsh species with specialised diets, mostly living in close association with the sea 
ﬂoor. Simultaneous with rising sea temperatures and retreating sea ice, these Arctic ﬁshes are being replaced by boreal, fast-growing, 
large-bodied generalist ﬁsh moving in from the south. These large, migratory predators take advantage of increased production while 
the Arctic ﬁsh species suffer from higher competition and predation and are retracting northwards and eastwards. Consequently, 
climate change is inducing structural change over large spatial scales, leading to a borealisation (‘Atlantiﬁcation’) of the European 
Arctic biological communities (Fossheim et al., 2015; Kortsch et al., 2015; Frainer et al., 2017) (medium conﬁdence). 
There is evidence based on population genetics that the ecosystem off Northeast Greenland could also become populated by a larger 
proportion of boreal species with ocean warming. Andrews et al. (2019) show that Atlantic cod, beaked redﬁsh (Sebastes mentella), 
and deep-sea shrimp (Pandalus borealis) recently found on the Northeast Greenland shelf originate from the quite distant Barents Sea, 
and suggested that pelagic offspring were dispersed via advection across the Fram Strait.
Physical barriers to range expansions into the high Arctic interior shelf systems and the outﬂow systems of Eurasia and the Canadian 
Archipelago will continue to govern future expansions of ﬁsh populations (medium conﬁdence). The limited available information on 
marine ﬁsh from other Arctic shelf regions reveals a latitudinal cline in the abundance of commercially harvestable ﬁsh species. For 
instance, there is evidence of latitudinal partitioning between the four dominant mid-water species (Polar cod, saffron cod (Eleginus 
gracilis), capelin, and Paciﬁc herring (Clupea pallasii)) in the Chuckchi and Northern Bering Sea, with Polar cod being most abundant to 
the north (De Robertis et al., 2017). These latitudinal gradients suggest that future range expansions of ﬁsh populations will continue 
to be governed by a combination of physical factors affecting overwintering success and the availability, quality and quantity of prey 
(medium conﬁdence).

In Antarctic marine systems, there is evidence of recent climate-related range shifts in the southwest Atlantic and West Antarctic 
Peninsula for penguin species (Pygoscelis papua and P. antarctica) and for Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), but mesozooplankton 
communities do not appear to have changed or shifted in response to ocean warming (Section 3.2.3.2). Recent evidence suggests 
that the ACC and its associated fronts and thermal gradients may be more permeable to biological dispersal than previously thought, 
with storm-forced surface waves and ocean eddies enhancing oceanographic connectivity for drift particles in surface layers of the 
Southern Ocean (Fraser et al., 2017; Fraser et al., 2018) (low conﬁdence), but it is unclear whether this will be an increasingly important 
pathway under climate change. Greater ship activity in the Southern Ocean may also present a risk for increasing introduction of 
non-native marine species, with the potential for these species to become invasive with changing environmental conditions (McCarthy 
et al., 2019). Current evidence of invasions by shell-crushing crabs on the Antarctic continental slope and shelf remains equivocal 
(Grifﬁths et al., 2013; Aronson et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2017d).
On Arctic land, northward range expansions have been recorded in species from all major taxon groups based both on scientiﬁc 
studies and local observations (high conﬁdence) (CAFF, 2013a; AMAP, 2017a; AMAP, 2017b; AMAP, 2018). The most recent examples 
of terrestrial vertebrates expanding northwards include a whole range of mammals in Yakutia, Russia (Safronov, 2016), moose (Alces 
alces) into the Arctic region of both northern continents (Tape et al., 2016) and North American beaver (Castor canadensis) in Alaska 
(Tape et al., 2018). In parallel with these expansions, pathogens and pests are also spreading north (CAFF, 2013a; Taylor et al., 2015; 
Forde et al., 2016b; Burke et al., 2017b; Kaﬂe et al., 2018). A widespread change is tundra greening, which in some cases is linked to 
shifting plant dominance within Arctic plant communities, in particular an increase in woody shrub biomass as conditions become 
more favorable for them (Myers-Smith et al., 2015; Bhatt et al., 2017).
Expansion of subarctic terrestrial species and biological communities into the Arctic and displacing native species is considered 
a major threat, since unique Arctic species may be less competitive than encroaching subarctic species favoured by changing climatic 
conditions (CAFF, 2013a). Similar displacements may take place within zones of the Arctic when low- and mid-Arctic species expand 
northward. Here, the most vulnerable species and communities may be in the species-poor, but unique, northernmost sub-zone of the 
Arctic because species cannot migrate northward as southern species encroach (CAVM Team, 2003; Walker et al., 2016; AMAP, 2018). 
This ‘Arctic squeeze’ is a combined effect of the fact that the area of the globe increasingly shrinks when moving poleward and that 
there is nowhere further north on land to go for terrestrial biota at the northern coast. The expected overall result of these shifts and 
limits will be a loss of biodiversity (CAFF, 2013a; CAFF, 2013b; AMAP, 2018) (medium conﬁdence). At the southern limit of the Arctic, 
thermal hotspots may support high biological productivity, but not necessarily high biodiversity (Walker et al., 2015) and may even 
act as advanced bridgeheads for expansion of subarctic species into the true Arctic (medium conﬁdence). At the other end of the 
Arctic zonal range, a temperature increase of only 1ºC–2ºC in the northernmost subzone may allow the establishment of woody dwarf 
shrubs, sedges and other species into bare soil areas that may radically change its appearance and ecological functions (Walker et al., 
2015; Myers-Smith et al., 2019) (medium conﬁdence). 
Range expansions also include the threat from alien species brought in by humans to become invasive and outcompete native species. 
Relatively few invasive alien species are presently well established in the Arctic, but many are thriving in the subarctic and may expand 
as a result of climate change (CAFF, 2013a; CAFF, 2013b). Examples of this include: American mink (Neovison vison) and Nootka lupin 
(Lupinus nootkatensis) in Arctic western Eurasia, Greenland and Iceland that are already causing severe problems to native fauna and 
ﬂora (CAFF and PAME, 2017).
Alien species are a major driver of terrestrial biodiversity change also in the Antarctic region (Frenot et al., 2005; Chown et al., 2012; 
McClelland et al., 2017). The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty restricts the introduction of non-native 
species to Antarctica as do the management authorities of sub-Antarctic islands (De Villiers et al., 2006). Despite this, alien species 
and their propagules continue to be introduced to the Antarctic continent and sub-Antarctic islands (Hughes et al., 2015). To date, 14 
non-native terrestrial species have colonised the Antarctic Treaty area (excluding sub-Antarctic islands) (Hughes et al., 2015), while the 
number in the sub-Antarctic is much higher (on the order of 200 species) (Frenot et al., 2005) (low conﬁdence). Species distribution 
models for terrestrial invasive species indicate that climate does not currently constitute a barrier for the establishment of invasive 
species on all subantarctic islands, and that the AP region will be the most vulnerable location on the Antarctic continent to invasive 
species establishment under RCP8.5 (Duffy et al., 2017). Thus, for continental Antarctica, existing climatic barriers to alien species 
establishment will weaken as warming continues across the region (medium conﬁdence). An increase in the ice-free area linked to 
glacier retreat in Antarctica is expected to increase the area available for new terrestrial ecosystems (Lee et al., 2017a). Along with 
growing number of visitors, this is expected to increase in the establishment probability of terrestrial alien species (Chown et al., 2012; 
Hughes et al., 2015) (medium conﬁdence).

3.4.3.3 
Impacts on Social-Ecological Systems
The Arctic is home to over four million people, with large regional 
variation in population distribution and demographics (Heleniak, 
2014). ‘Connection with nature’ is a deﬁning feature of Arctic identity 
for indigenous communities (Schweitzer et al., 2014) because the 
lands, waters and ice that surround communities evoke a  sense 
of home, freedom and belonging, and are crucial for culture, life 
and survival (Cunsolo Willox et al., 2012; Durkalec et al., 2015). 
Climate-driven environmental changes are affecting local ecosystems 
and inﬂuencing travel, hunting, ﬁshing and gathering practises. This 
has implications for people’s livelihoods, cultural practices, economies 
and self-determination.
3.4.3.3.1 Food and water security
Impacts of climate change on food and water security in the Arctic can 
be severe in regions where infrastructure (including ice roads), travel 
and subsistence practices are reliant on elements of the cryosphere 
such as snow cover, permafrost and freshwater or sea ice (Cochran 
et al., 2013; Inuit Circumpolar Council-Alaska (ICC-AK), 2015).
There is high conﬁdence in indicators that food insecurity risks are on 
the rise for Indigenous Arctic peoples. Food is strongly tied to culture, 
identity, values and ways of life (Donaldson et al., 2010; Cunsolo Willox 
et al., 2015; Inuit Circumpolar Council-Alaska (ICC-AK), 2015); thus, 
impacts to food security go beyond access to food and physical health. 
Food systems in northern communities are intertwined with northern 
ecosystems because of subsistence hunting, ﬁshing and gathering 
activities. Environmental changes to animal habitat, population sizes 
and movement mean that culturally important food species may no 
longer be found within accessible ranges or familiar areas (Parlee and 
Furgal, 2012; Rautio et al., 2014; Inuit Circumpolar Council-Alaska 
(ICC-AK), 2015; Lavrillier et al., 2016) (Section 3.4.3.2.2). This impacts 
negatively the accessibility of culturally important local food sources 
(Lavrillier, 2013; Rosol et al., 2016) that make important contributions 
to a nutritious diet (Donaldson et al., 2010; Hansen et al., 2013; Dudley 
et al., 2015). Longer open water seasons and poorer ice conditions on 
lakes impact ﬁshing options (Laidler, 2012) and waterfowl hunting 
(Goldhar et al., 2014). Permafrost warming and increases in active 
layer thickness (Section 3.4.1.3) reduce the reliability of permafrost 
for natural refrigeration. In some cases these changes have reduced 
access to, and consumption of, locally resourced food and can result 
in increased incidence of illness (Laidler, 2012; Cochran et al., 2013; 
Cozzetto et al., 2013; Rautio et al., 2014; Beaumier et al., 2015). These 
consequences of climate change are intertwined with processes of 
globalisation, whereby complex social, economic and cultural factors 
are contributing to a  dietary transformation from locally resourced 
foods to imported market foods across the Arctic (Harder and Wenzel, 
2012; Parlee and Furgal, 2012; Nymand and Fondahl, 2014; Beaumier 
et al., 2015). Limiting exposures to zoonotic, foodborne and waterborne 
pathogens (Section 3.4.3.2.2) depends on accurate and comprehensive 
data on species diversity, biology and distribution and pathways for 
invasion (Hoberg and Brooks, 2015; Kaﬂe et al., 2018).
There is high conﬁdence that changes to travel conditions impact 
food security through access to hunting grounds. Shorter snow cover 
duration (Section 3.4.1.1), and changes to snow conditions (such as 
density) make travel more difﬁcult and dangerous (Laidler, 2012; Ford 
et al., 2019). Changes in dominant wind direction and speed reduce 
the reliability of traditional navigational indicators such as snow 
drifts, increasing safety concerns (Ford and Pearce, 2012; Laidler, 2012; 
Ford et al., 2013; Clark et al., 2016b). Permafrost warming, increased 
active layer thickness and landscape instability (Section 3.4.1.3), ﬁre 
disturbance and changes to water levels (Section  3.4.1.2) impact 
overland navigability in summer (Goldhar et al., 2014; Brinkman 
et al., 2016; Dodd et al., 2018).
There is high conﬁdence that both risks and opportunities arise for 
coastal communities with changing sea ice and open water conditions. 
Of particular concern for coastal communities is landfast sea ice 
(Section 3.3.1.1.5), which creates an extension of the land in winter 
that facilitates travel (Inuit Circumpolar Council Canada, 2014). The 
ﬂoe edge position, timing and dynamics of freeze-up and break-up, 
sea ice stability through the winter, and length of the summer open 
water season are important indicators of changing ice conditions 
and safe travel (Gearheard et al., 2013; Eicken et al., 2014; Baztan 
et al., 2017). Warming water temperature, altered salinity proﬁles, 
snow properties, changing currents and winds all have consequences 
for the use of sea ice as a travel or hunting platform (Hansen et al., 
2013; Eicken et al., 2014; Clark et al., 2016a). More leads (areas 
of open water), especially in the spring, can mean more hunting 
opportunities such as whaling off the coast of Alaska (Hansen et al., 
2013; Eicken et al., 2014). In Nunavut, a ﬂoe edge closer to shore 
improves access to marine mammals such as seals or narwhal (Ford 
et al., 2013). However, these conditions also hamper access to coastal 
or inland hunting grounds (Hansen et al., 2013; Durkalec et al., 2015), 
have increased potential for break-off events at the ﬂoe edge (Ford 
et al., 2013), or can result in decreased presence (or total absence) of 
ice-associated marine mammals with an absence of summer sea ice 
(Eicken et al., 2014).
Many northern communities rely on ponds, streams and lakes for 
drinking water (Cochran et al., 2013; Goldhar et al., 2013; Nymand 
and Fondahl, 2014; Daley et al., 2015; Dudley et al., 2015; Masina 
et al., 2019), so there is high conﬁdence that projected changes in 
hydrology will impact water supply (Section 3.4.2.2). Surface water 
is vulnerable to thermokarst disturbance and drainage, as well as 
bacterial contamination, the risks of which are increased by warming 
ground and water temperatures (Cozzetto et al., 2013; Goldhar 
et al., 2013; Dudley et al., 2015; Masina et al., 2019). Icebergs or 
old multi-year ice are important sources of drinking water for some 
coastal communities, so reduced accessibility to stable sea ice 
conditions affects local water security. Small remote communities 
have limited capacity to respond quickly to water supply threats, 
which ampliﬁes vulnerabilities to water security (Daley et al., 2015).
3.4.3.3.2 Communities
Culture and knowledge
Spending time on the land is culturally important for indigenous 
communities (Eicken et al., 2014; Durkalec et al., 2015). There is high 
conﬁdence that daily life is inﬂuenced by changes to ice freeze-up 
and break-up (rivers/lakes/sea ice), snow onset/melt, vegetation 
260
Chapter 3 
Polar Regions
3
phenology, and related wildlife/ﬁsh/bird behaviour (Inuit Circumpolar 
Council-Alaska (ICC-AK), 2015). Inter-generational knowledge 
transmission of associated values and skills is also inﬂuenced by 
climate change because younger generations do not have the same 
level of experience or conﬁdence with traditional indicators (Ford, 
2012; Parlee and Furgal, 2012; Eicken et al., 2014; Pearce et al., 
2015). Climate-driven changes undermine conﬁdence in indigenous 
knowledge holders in regards to traditional indicators used for safe 
travel and navigation (Parlee and Furgal, 2012; Golovnev, 2017; Ford 
et al., 2019).
Economics
The Arctic mixed economy is characterised by a  combination of 
subsistence activities, and employment and cash income. There is low 
conﬁdence about the extent and nature of impact of climate change 
on local subsistence activities and economic opportunities across 
the Arctic (e.g.,  hunting, ﬁshing, resource extraction, tourism and 
transportation; see Section 3.2.4) because of high variability between 
communities (Harder and Wenzel, 2012; Cochran et al., 2013; Clark 
et al., 2016b; Fall, 2016; Ford et al., 2016; Lavrillier et al., 2016). Longer 
ice-free travel windows in Arctic seas could lower the costs of access 
and development of northern resources (delivering supplies and 
shipping resources to markets) and thus, may contribute to increased 
opportunities for marine shipping, commercial ﬁsheries, tourism 
and resource development (Sections  3.2.4.2,  3.2.4.3) (Ford et al., 
2012; Huskey et al., 2014; Overland et al., 2017). This has important 
implications for economic development, particularly in relation to local 
employment opportunities but also raises concerns of detrimental 
impacts on animals, habitat and subsistence activities (Cochran et al., 
2013; Inuit Circumpolar Council-Alaska (ICC-AK),2015).
3.4.3.3.3 Health and wellbeing
For many polar residents, especially Indigenous peoples, the physical 
environment underpins social determinants of well-being, including 
physical and mental health. Changes to the environment impact 
most dimensions of health and well-being (Parlee and Furgal, 2012; 
Ostapchuk et al., 2015). Climate change consequences in polar 
regions (Sections 3.3.1.1, 3.4.1.2) have impacted key transportation 
routes (Gearheard et al., 2006; Laidler, 2006; Ford et al., 2013; Clark 
et al., 2016a) and pose increased risk of injury and death during 
travel (Durkalec et al., 2014; Durkalec et al., 2015; Clark et al., 2016b; 
Driscoll et al., 2016).
Foodborne disease is an emerging concern in the Arctic because 
warmer waters, loss of sea ice (Section  3.3.1.1) and resultant 
changes in contaminant pathways can lead to bioaccumulation and 
biomagniﬁcation of contaminants in key food species. While many 
hypothesised foodborne diseases are not well studied (Parkinson and 
Berner, 2009), foodborne gastroenteritis is associated with shellﬁsh 
harvested from warming waters (McLaughlin et al., 2005; Young 
et al., 2015). Mercury presently stored in permafrost (Schuster et al., 
2018) has potential to accumulate in aquatic ecosystems.
Climate change increases the risk of waterborne disease in the Arctic 
via warming water temperatures and changes to surface hydrology 
(Section 3.4.1.2) (Parkinson and Berner, 2009; Brubaker et al., 2011; 
Dudley et al., 2015). After periods of rapid snowmelt, bacteria can 
increase in untreated drinking water, with associated increases in 
acute gastrointestinal illness (Harper et al., 2011). Consumption of 
untreated drinking water may increase duration and frequency of 
exposure to local environmental contaminants (Section  3.4.3.2.3) 
or potential waterborne diseases (Goldhar et al., 2014; Daley et al., 
2015). The potential for infectious gastrointestinal disease is not well 
understood, and there are concerns in relation to the safety of storage 
containers of raw water in addition to the quality of the source water 
itself (Goldhar et al., 2014; Wright et al., 2018; Masina et al., 2019).
Climate change has negatively affected place attachment via hunting, 
ﬁshing, trapping and traveling disruptions, which have important 
mental health impacts (Cunsolo Willox et al., 2012; Durkalec et al., 
2015; Cunsolo and Ellis, 2018). The pathways through which climate 
change impacts mental wellness in the Arctic varies by gender 
(Bunce and Ford, 2015; Ostapchuk et al., 2015; Bunce et al., 2016) 
and age (Petrasek-MacDonald et al., 2013; Ostapchuk et al., 2015). 
Emotional impacts of climate-related changes in the environment 
were signiﬁcantly higher for women compared to men, linked to 
concern for family members (Ostapchuk et al., 2015). However, men 
are also vulnerable due to gendered roles in subsistence and cultural 
activities (Bunce and Ford, 2015). In coastal areas, sea ice means 
freedom for travel, hunting and ﬁshing, so changes in sea ice affect 
the experience of and connection with place. In turn, this inﬂuences 
individual and collective mental/emotional health, as well as spiritual 
and social vitality according to relationships between sea ice use, 
culture, knowledge and autonomy (Cunsolo Willox et al., 2013a; 
Cunsolo Willox et al., 2013b; Gearheard et al., 2013; Durkalec et al., 
2015; Inuit Circumpolar Council-Alaska (ICC-AK), 2015).
3.4.3.3.4 Infrastructure
Permafrost is undergoing rapid change (Section  3.4.1.2), creating 
challenges for planners, decision makers and engineers (AMAP, 
2017d). The observed changes in the ground thermal regime 
(Romanovsky et al., 2010; Romanovsky et al., 2017; Biskaborn et al., 
2019) threaten the structural stability and functional capacities of 
infrastructure, in particular that which is located on ice rich frozen 
ground. Extensive summaries of construction damages along with 
adaptation and mitigation strategies are available (Larsen et al., 
2014; Dore et al., 2016; AMAP, 2017d; Pendakur, 2017; Shiklomanov 
et al., 2017a; Shiklomanov et al., 2017b; Vincent et al., 2017).
Projections of climate and permafrost suggest that a  wide range 
current infrastructure will be impacted by changing conditions 
(medium conﬁdence). A circumpolar study found that approximately 
70% of infrastructure (residential, transportation and industrial 
facilities), including over 1200 settlements (~40 with population 
more than 5000) are located in areas where permafrost is projected 
to thaw by 2050 under RCP4.5 (Hjort et al., 2018). Regions associated 
with the highest hazard are in the thaw-unstable zone characterised 
by relatively high ground-ice content and thick deposits of frost 
susceptible sediments (Shiklomanov et al., 2017b). By 2050, these 
high hazard environments contain one-third of existing pan-Arctic 
infrastructure. Onshore hydrocarbon extraction and transportation 
in the Russian Arctic are at risk: 45% of the oil and natural gas 
261
Polar Regions 
Chapter 3

production ﬁelds in the Russian Arctic are located in the highest 
hazard zone.
In a  regional study of the state of Alaska, cumulative expenses 
projected for climate-related damage to public infrastructure totalled 
USD 5.5 billion between 2015 and 2099 under RCP8.5 (Melvin et al., 
2017). The top two causes of damage related costs were projected to 
be road ﬂooding from increased precipitation, and building damage 
associated with near-surface permafrost thaw. These costs decreased 
by 24% to USD 4.2 billion for the same time frame under RCP4.5, 
indicating that reducing greenhouse gas emissions globally could 
lessen damages (Figure 3.13). In a related study that included these 
costs and others, as well as positive gains from climate change in 
terms of a reduction in heating costs attributable to warmer winter, 
annual net costs were still USD 340–700  million, or  0.6–1.3% of 
Alaska’s GDP, suggesting that climate change costs will outweigh 
positive beneﬁts, at least for this region (Berman and Schmidt, 2019).
Winter roads (snow covered ground and frozen lakes) are distinct from 
the infrastructure considered earlier, but have a strong inﬂuence on 
the reliability and costs of transportation in some remote northern 
communities and industrial development sites (Parlee and Furgal, 
2012; Huskey et al., 2014; Overland et al., 2017). For these communities, 
changing lake and river levels and the period of safe ice cover all affect 
the duration of use of overland travel routes and inland waterways, 
with associated implications for increased travel risks, time, and costs 
(Laidler, 2012; Ford et al., 2013; Goldhar et al., 2014). There have been 
recent instances of severely curtailed ice road shipping seasons due 
to unusually warm conditions in the early winter (Sturm et al., 2017). 
While the impact of human effort on the maintenance of winter roads 
is difﬁcult to quantify, a reduction in the operational time window due 
to winter warming is projected (Mullan et al., 2017).
3.5 
Human Responses to Climate Change  
in Polar Regions
3.5.1 
The Polar Context for Responding
Human responses to climate change in the Arctic and Antarctica 
are shaped by their unique physical, ecological, social, cultural 
and political conditions. Extreme climatic conditions, remoteness 
from densely populated regions, limited human mobility, short 
seasons of biological productivity, high costs in monitoring and 
research, sovereignty claims to lands and waters by southern-based 
governments, a rich diversity of indigenous cultures and institutional 
arrangements that in some cases recognise indigenous rights and 
support regional and international cooperation in governance are 
among the many factors that impede and or facilitate adaptation.
The social and cultural differences are an especially noteworthy 
factor in assessing polar responses. Approximately four million people 
currently reside in the Arctic with about three quarters residing in 
urban areas, and approximately 10% being Indigenous (AHDR, 2014). 
Regions of the Arctic differ widely in population, ranging from 94% of 
Iceland’s population living in urban environments to 68% of Nunavut’s 
population living in rural areas. And while there has been a general 
movement to greater urbanisation in the Arctic (AHDR, 2014), that 
trend is not true for all regions (Heleniak, 2014). About 4400 people 
reside in Antarctic in the summer and about 1100 in the winter, 
predominantly based at research stations of which approximately 40 
are occupied year-round (The World Factbook, 2016).
For most Arctic Indigenous peoples, human responses to climate 
change are viewed as a matter of cultural survival (Greaves, 2016) 
(Cross-Chapter Box 3  in Chapter  1). However, Indigenous people 
are not homogenous in their perspectives. While in some cases 
Indigenous people are negatively impacted by sectoral activities such 
as mining and oil and gas development (Nymand and Fondahl, 2014), 
in other cases they beneﬁt ﬁnancially (Shadian, 2014), setting up 
dilemmas and potential internal conﬂicts (Huskey, 2018; Southcott 
and Natcher, 2018) (high conﬁdence). Geopolitical complexities also 
confound responses.
Together these conditions make for complexity and uncertainty in 
human decision making, be it at the household and community levels 
to the international level. Adding to uncertainty in human choice 
related to climate change is the interaction of climate with other 
forces for change, such as globalisation and land and sea-use change. 
These interactions necessitate that responses to climate change 
consider cumulative effects as well as context-speciﬁc pathways for 
building resilience (Nymand and Fondahl, 2014; ARR, 2016). 
3.5.2 
Responses of Human Sectors
The sections below assess human responses to climate change in 
polar regions by examining various sectors of human-environment 
activity (i.e., social-ecological subsystems), reviewing their respective 
systems of governance related to climate change, and considering 
possible resilience pathways. Table 3.4 summarises the consequences, 
interacting drivers, responses and assets for responding to climate 
change by social-ecological subsystems (i.e., sectors) of Arctic 
and Antarctic regions. An area of response not elaborated in this 
assessment is geoengineered sea ice remediation to support local-to-
regional ecosystem restoration and which may also affect climate via 
albedo changes. There is an emerging body of literature on this topic 
(e.g., Berdahl et al., 2014; Desch et al., 2017; Field et al., 2018), which 
at present is too limited to allow assessing dimensions of feasibility, 
beneﬁts and risks, and governance.
3.5.2.1 
Commercial Fisheries
Responses addressing changes in the abundance and distribution of 
ﬁsh resources (Section 3.2.4.1) differ by region. In some polar regions, 
strategies of adaptive governance, biodiversity conservation, scenario 
planning and the precautionary approach are in use (NPFMC, 2018). 
Further development of coordinated monitoring programs (Cahalan 
et al., 2014; Ganz et al., 2018), data sharing, social learning and 
decision support tools that alert managers to climate change impacts 
on species and ecosystems would allow for appropriate and timely 
responses including changes in overall ﬁshing capacity, individual 
stock quotas, shifts between different target species, opening/closure 
of different geographic areas and balance between different ﬁshing 
262

ﬂeets (Busch et al., 2016; NPFMC, 2019; see Section 3.5.4). Scenario 
planning, adaptive management and similar efforts will contribute 
to the resilience and conservation of these social-ecological systems 
(medium conﬁdence).
Five Arctic States, known as ‘Arctic 5’ (Canada, Denmark, Norway, 
Russia and the United States) have sovereign rights for exploring 
and exploiting resources within their 200 nautical mile Exclusive 
Economic Zones (EEZs) in the High Arctic and manage their resources 
within their own regulatory measures. A  review of future harvest 
in the European Arctic (Haug et al., 2017) points towards high 
probability of increased northern movement of several commercial 
ﬁsh species (Section 3.3.3.1, Box 3.4), but only to the shelf slope for 
the demersal species. This shift suggests increased northern ﬁshing 
activity, but within the EEZs and present management regimes (Haug 
et al., 2017) (medium conﬁdence).
In 2009, a new Marine Resources Act entered into force for Norway’s 
EEZ. This act applies to all wild living marine resources, and states 
that its purpose is to ensure sustainable and economically proﬁtable 
management of resources. Conservation of biodiversity is described 
as an integral part of its sustainable ﬁsheries management and it is 
mandatory to apply “an ecosystem approach, taking into account 
habitats and biodiversity” (Gullestad et al., 2017). In addition 
to national management, the Joint Norwegian-Russian Fisheries 
Commission provides cooperative management of the most important 
ﬁsh stocks in the Barents and Norwegian Seas. The stipulation of the 
total quota for the various joint ﬁsh stocks is a key element, as is more 
long-term precautionary harvesting strategies, better allowing for 
responses to climate change (medium conﬁdence). A scenario-based 
approach to identify management strategies that are effective under 
changing climate conditions is being explored for the Barents Sea 
(Planque et al., 2019).
In the US Arctic, an adaptive management approach has been 
introduced that utilises future ecological scenarios to develop 
strategies for mitigating the future risks and impacts of climate 
change (NPFMC, 2018). The ﬁsheries of the southeastern Bering Sea 
are managed through a complex suite of regulations that includes 
catch shares (Ono et al., 2017), habitat protections, restrictions 
on forage ﬁsh, bycatch constraints (DiCosimo et al., 2015) and 
community development quotas. This intricate regulatory framework 
has inherent risks and beneﬁts to ﬁshers and industry by limiting 
ﬂexibility (Anderson et al., 2017b). To address these challenges, 
the North Paciﬁc Fishery Management Council recently adopted 
a Fishery Ecosystem Plan that includes a multi-model climate change 
action module (Punt et al., 2016; Holsman et al., 2017; Zador et al., 
2017; Holsman et al., 2019). Despite this complex ecosystem-based 
approach to ﬁsheries management, it may not be possible to prevent 
projected declines of some high value species at high rates of global 
warming (Ianelli et al., 2016).
In the US portion of the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas EEZ, ﬁshing is 
prohibited until sufﬁcient information is obtained to sustainably 
manage the resource (Wilson and Ormseth, 2009). In the Canadian 
sector of the Beaufort Sea, commercial ﬁsheries are currently only 
small-scale and locally operated. However, with decreasing ice cover 
and potential interest in expanding ﬁsheries, the Inuvialuit subsistence 
ﬁshers of the western Canadian Arctic developed a  new proactive 
ecosystem-based Fisheries Management Framework (Ayles et al., 
2016). Also in Western Canada, the commercial ﬁshery for Arctic char 
(Salvenius alpinus) in Cambridge Bay is co-managed by local Inuit 
organisations and Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO, 2014).
The high seas region of the CAO is per deﬁnition outside of any 
nation’s EEZ. Recent actions of the international community show 
that a precautionary approach to considerations of CAO ﬁsheries has 
been adopted (high conﬁdence) and that expansion of commercial 
ﬁsheries into the CAO will be constrained until sufﬁcient information is 
obtained to manage the ﬁsheries according to an ecosystem approach 
to ﬁsheries management (high conﬁdence). The Arctic 5  ofﬁcially 
adopted the precautionary approach to ﬁshing in 2015 by signing the 
Oslo Declaration concerning the prevention of unregulated ﬁshing in 
the CAO. The declaration established a moratorium to limit potential 
expansion of CAO commercial ﬁshing until sufﬁcient information, also 
on climate change impacts, is available to manage it sustainably. The 
Arctic 5 and several other nations subsequently agreed to a treaty 
(the Central Arctic Ocean Fisheries Agreement) that imposed a 16-year 
moratorium on commercial ﬁshing in the CAO.
CCAMLR is responsible for the conservation of marine resources 
south of the Antarctic Polar Front (CCAMLR, 1982), and has 
ecosystem-based ﬁsheries management embedded within its 
convention (Constable, 2011). This includes the CCAMLR Ecosystem 
Monitoring Program, which aims to monitor important land-based 
predators of krill to detect the effects of the krill ﬁshery on the 
ecosystem. Currently, there is no formal mechanism for choosing 
which data are needed in a management procedure for krill or how 
to include such data. However, this information will be important in 
enabling CCAMLR ﬁsheries management to respond to the effects of 
climate change on krill and krill predators in the future. 
Commercial ﬁsheries management responses to climate change 
impacts in the Southern Ocean may need to address the displacement 
of ﬁshing effort due to poleward shifts in species distribution (Pecl 
et al., 2017) (Box 3.4) (low conﬁdence). Fisheries in the Southern 
Ocean are relatively mobile and are potentially able to respond to 
range shifts in target species, which is in contrast to small-scale 
coastal ﬁsheries in other regions. Management responses will also 
need to adapt to the effects of future changes in sea ice extent and 
duration on the spatial distribution of ﬁshing operations (ATCM, 
2017; Jabour, 2017) (Section 3.2.4).
3.5.2.2 
Arctic Subsistence Systems
Subsistence users have responded to climate change by adapting 
their wildfood production systems and engaging in the climate policy 
processes at multiple levels of governance. The limitations of many 
formal institutions, however, suggest that in order to achieve greater 
resilience of subsistence systems with climate change, transformations 
in governance are needed to provide greater power sharing, 
including more resources for engaging in climate change studies and 
regional-to-national policy making (see Sections 3.2.4.1.1, 3.4.3.2.2, 
3.4.3.3.1, 3.4.3.3.2, 3.4.3.3.3, 3.5.3).

Adaptation by subsistence users to climate change falls into several 
categories. In some cases harvesters are shifting the timing of 
harvesting and the selection of harvest areas due to changes in 
seasonality and access to traditional use areas (AMAP, 2017a; 
AMAP, 2017b; AMAP, 2018). Changes in the navigability of rivers 
(i.e., shallower) and more open (i.e., dangerous) seas have resulted in 
harvesters changing harvesting gear, such as shifting from propeller 
to jet-propelled boats or all-terrain vehicles, and to larger ocean-going 
vessels for traditional whaling (Brinkman et al., 2016). In many cases, 
using different gear results in an increase in fuel costs (e.g., jet boats 
are about 30% less efﬁcient). Unsafe ice conditions have resulted in 
greater risks of travel on rivers and the ocean in the frozen months. 
In Savoonga, Alaska, whalers reported limitations in harvesting 
larger bowhead because of thin ice conditions that do not allow for 
safe haul outs, and as a result, community residents now anticipate 
a greater dependence on western Alaska’s reindeer as a source of 
meat in the future (Rosales and Chapman, 2015). Harvesters have 
also responded with switching of harvested species and in some 
cases doing without (AMAP, 2018). In many cases, adaption has 
allowed for continued provisioning of wildfoods in spite of climate 
change impacts (BurnSilver et al., 2016; AMAP, 2017a; Fauchald et al., 
2017b) (medium conﬁdence).
The impacts of climate change have also required adaptation to 
the non-harvesting aspects of wildfood production, such as an 
abandonment of traditional food storage and drying practices 
(e.g., ice cellars) and an increased use of household and community 
freezers (AMAP, 2017a). In several cases there has been an increased 
emphasis on community self-reliance, such as use of household and 
community gardens for food production (Loring et al., 2016). In the 
future, agriculture may be more possible with improved conditions at 
the southern limit of the Arctic, and could supplement hunting and 
ﬁshing (AMAP, 2018).
Climate change may in the future bring both new harvestable ﬁsh, 
birds, mammals and berry producing plants to the north, and reduced 
populations and or access to currently harvested species (AMAP, 
2017a; AMAP, 2017b; AMAP, 2018). Adaptive co-management and 
stronger links of local-to-regional level management with national 
to international level agreements necessitate consideration for 
sustainable harvest of new resources, as well as securing sustainable 
harvest or even full protection of dwindling or otherwise vulnerable 
populations. In these cases, adaptive co-management could be an 
efﬁcient tool to achieve consensus on population goals, including 
international cooperation and agreements regarding migratory 
species shared between more countries (Kocho-Schellenberg and 
Berkes, 2014) (Section 3.5.4.3). 
While there has been involvement of subsistence users in 
monitoring and research on climate change (Section  3.5.4.1.1), 
resource management regimes that regulate harvesting are largely 
dictated by science-based paradigms that give limited legitimacy 
to the knowledge and suggested preferences of subsistence users 
(Section 3.5.4.2, Cross-Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 1).
The social costs and social learning associated with responding 
to climate change are often related. Involvement in adaptive 
co-management comes with high transaction costs (e.g.,  greater 
demands on overburdened indigenous leaders, added stress of 
communities living with limited resources) (Forbes et al., 2015). In 
some cases, co-management has given communities a greater voice 
in decision making, but when ineffective, these arrangements can 
perpetuate dominant paradigms of resource management (AMAP, 
2018). The perceived risks of climate change can at the same time 
reinforce cultural identify and motivate greater political involvement, 
which in turn, gives indigenous leaders experience as agents 
of change in policy making. Penn et al. (2016) pointed to these 
conﬂicting forces, arguing the need for a greater focus on community 
capacity and cumulative effects.
Greater involvement of indigenous subsistence users in Canada 
occurs at the national and regional levels through the structures 
and provisions of indigenous settlement agreements (e.g.,  1993 
Nunavut Land Claims Agreement, 1984 Inuvialuit Final Agreement), 
ﬁsh and wildlife co-management agreements (e.g., Porcupine 
Caribou Management Agreement of 1986), and through various 
boundary organisations (e.g, CircumArctic Rangifer Monitoring and 
Assessment Network). Home rule in Greenland, established in 1979, 
gives the Naalakkersuisut (government of Greenland) authority on 
most domestic matters of governance.
Indigenous leaders are responding to the risks of climate change by 
engaging in political processes at multiple levels and through different 
venues. However, indigenous involvement in IPCC assessments 
remains limited (Ford et al., 2016). At the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the discursive space 
for incorporating perspectives of Indigenous peoples on climate 
change adaptation has expanded since 2010, which is reﬂected in 
texts and engagement with most activity areas (Ford et al., 2015) 
and by the establishment of the Local Communities and Indigenous 
Peoples Platform Facilitative Working Group in December 2018. 
Aleut International Association, Arctic Athabaskan Council, Gwich’in 
Council International, Inuit Circumpolar Council, Russian Association 
of Indigenous Peoples of the North, and the Saami Council, which 
sit as ‘Permanent Participants’ of the Arctic Council, are involved in 
many of its working groups and partake also at the political level 
(Section 3.5.3.2.1). 
3.5.2.3 
Arctic Reindeer Herding
Herders’ responses to climate change have varied by region and 
respective herding practices, and in some cases are constrained 
by limited access to pastures (Klokov, 2012; Forbes et al., 2016; 
Uboni et al., 2016; Mallory and Boyce, 2017). These conditions are 
exacerbated in some cases by high numbers of predators (Lavrillier 
and Gabyshev, 2018). In Fennoscandia, husbandry practices of 
reindeer by some (mostly Sami) include supplemental feeding, which 
provide a  buffer for unfavourable conditions. In Alaska, reindeer 
herding is primarily free range, where herders must manage herd 
movements in the event of icing events and the potential loss of 
reindeer because the movements of caribou herds (wild reindeer), 
both of which are partially driven by climate. For Nenets of the 
Yamal, Russia, resilience in herding has been facilitated through 
herders’ own agency and, to some extent, the willingness of the gas 
264
Chapter 3 
Polar Regions

industry to observe non-binding guidelines that provide for herders’ 
continued use of traditional migrations routes (Forbes et al., 2015). In 
response to climate change (i.e., icing events and early spring runoffs 
blocking migration), the only way of avoiding high deer mortality is 
to change migration routes or take deer to other pastures. In practice, 
however, the full set of challenges has meant more Yamal herders 
opting out of the traditional collective migration partially or entirely 
to manage their herds privately. The reason to have private herds 
is one of adaptive advantage; smaller, privately owned herds are 
nimbler in the face of rapid changes in land cover and the expansion 
of infrastructure (Forbes, 2013). The same logic has more recently 
been applied by some herders in the wake of recent rain-on-snow 
events (Section 3.4.3.2.2) (Forbes et al., 2016). In all these regions, 
restrictions affecting the movement of reindeer to pastures are 
expected to negatively interact with the effects of climate and affect 
the future sustainability of herding systems (high conﬁdence).
3.5.2.4 
Tourism
The growth of the polar tourism market is, in part, a  response to 
climate change, as travellers seek ‘last-chance’ opportunities, which, 
in turn, is creating new challenges in governance (Section 3.2.4.2). 
Polar-class expedition cruise vessels are now, for the ﬁrst time, being 
purposefully built for recreational Arctic sea travel. The anticipated 
near- and long-term growth of Arctic tourism, especially with small 
vessels (yachts) (Johnston et al., 2017), points to a deﬁciency in current 
regulations and policies to address human safety, environmental 
risks and cultural impacts. Industry growth also points to the need 
for operators, governments, destination communities and others to 
identify and evaluate adaptation strategies, such as disaster relief 
management plans, updated navigation technologies for vessels, codes 
of conduct for visitors and improved maps (Pizzolato et al., 2016) and 
to respond to perceptions of tourism by residents of local destinations 
(Kaján, 2014; Stokke and Haukeland, 2017). Efforts were initiated 
with stakeholders in Arctic Canada to identify strategies that would 
lower risks (Pizzolato et al., 2016); a next step to lower risks and build 
resilience is to further develop those strategies (AMAP, 2017a; AMAP, 
2017b; AMAP, 2018). Opportunities for tourism vessels in the Arctic to 
contribute to international research activities (‘ships of opportunity’) 
may improve sovereignty claims in some regions, contribute to science 
and enhance education of the public (Stewart et al., 2013; Arctic 
Council, 2015a; Stewart et al., 2015; de la Barre et al., 2016).
Tourism activities in the Antarctic are conducted in accordance with 
the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, 
which establishes general environmental principles, environmental 
assessment requirements, a scheme of establishing protected areas 
and restrictions on waste disposal. Site-specific management tools 
are in place. While there are varying views amongst Antarctic Treaty 
Parties on the best management regulations for Antarctic tourism, 
these Parties continue to work to manage tourism activity, including 
growth in numbers of visitors. In addition to the Protocol, mandatory 
measures have been agreed to manage aspects of tourism activity. 
Industry self-regulation supplements these requirements, coordinated 
by the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators, which 
has worked with Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties to manage 
changes in operations and their impact on ice-free areas (ATCM, 2016). 
3.5.2.5 
Arctic Non-Renewable Extractive Industries
Climate change has resulted a limited response by non-renewable 
resource extraction industries and agencies in the Arctic to changes 
in sea ice, thawing permafrost, spring runoffs, and resultant timing 
of exploration, construction and use of ice roads, and infrastructure 
design (AHDR, 2014). In some regions, climate change has offered 
new development opportunities, although off-shore prospects 
remaining cost prohibitive given current world markets (Petrick et al., 
2017). (In the area covered by the Antarctic Treaty, exploitation of 
mineral resources is prohibited by the Protocol on Environmental 
Protection to the Antarctic Treaty.)
Climate change in some Arctic regions is facilitating easier access 
to natural resources (Section 3.5.2.3), which may generate ﬁnancial 
capital for Arctic residents and their governments, including 
Indigenous peoples but also greater exposure to risks such as 
oil spills and increases in noise. Receding sea ice and glaciers has 
opened new possibilities for development, such as areas of receding 
glaciers of eastern Greenland (Smits et al., 2017). As mineral 
development commenced in Greenland, its home rule government 
developed environmental impact assessment protocols to provide 
for improved public participation (Forbes et al., 2015). Indigenous 
peoples are considered as non-state actors and in many, but not 
all cases, promote environmental protection in support of the 
sustainability of their traditional livelihoods. This protection is at 
times in opposition to the industrial development business sector, 
which is well-funded and lobbies strongly. Bilateral agreements for 
resource development in the Arctic are typically state dominated and 
controlled, and are negotiated with powerful non-state actors, such 
as state-dominated companies (Young, 2016). Among the non-state 
actors, new networks and economic forums have been established 
(Wehrmann, 2016). One example is the Arctic Economic Council, 
created by the Arctic Council during 2013–2015 as an independent 
organisation that facilitates Arctic business-to-business activities and 
supports economic development.
Several regional governments are assessing the long-term viability of 
ice roads, historically used for accessing mineral development sites, 
as well as some Arctic human settlements. In Northwest Territories, 
Canada, several ice roads are being replaced with all-season roads, 
with other replacements proposed. Assessing future conditions is key 
for planning and initiating new projects (Hori et al., 2018; Kiani et al., 
2018) but is often constrained by uncertainties of available climate 
models (Mullan et al., 2017).
On the North Slope of Alaska, oil and gas development is now 
undergoing new expansion, while industry concurrently faces 
increasing challenges of climate change, such as shorter and warmer 
winters, the main season for oil exploration and production (Lilly, 
2017). The method for building of ice roads on the North Slope 
has been somewhat modiﬁed to account for warmer temperatures 
during construction. There are also knowledge gaps in understanding 
implications of seismic studies with climate change on the landscape 
(Dabros et al., 2018). The issue of cumulative effects also raises 
questions of current practice of environmental impact assessment to 
evaluate potential cumulative effects (Kirkfeldt et al., 2016).
265
Polar Regions 
Chapter 3

Lilly (2017) reported that optimising Alaska North Slope transportation 
networks during winter ﬁeld operations is critical in managing 
increasing resource development and could potentially provide 
a  better framework for environmentally responsible development. 
Better understanding of environmental change is also important in 
ensuring continued oil ﬁeld operations with protection of natural 
resources. Improved forecasting of short-term conditions (i.e., snow, 
soil temperatures, spring runoffs) could allow management agencies 
to respond to conditions more proactively and give industry more 
time to plan winter mobilisation, such as construction of ice roads 
(low conﬁdence).
3.5.2.6 
Infrastructure
Reducing and avoiding the impacts of climate change on infrastructure 
will require special attention to engineering, land use planning, 
maintenance operations, local culture and private and public budgeting 
(AMAP, 2017a; AMAP, 2017b; AMAP, 2018). In some cases, relocation 
of human settlements will be required, necessitating more formal 
methods of assessing relocation needs and identifying sources of 
funding to support relocations (Cross-Chapter Box 9) (high conﬁdence).
A discussion of the relocation of Alaska’s coastal villages is found 
in Cross-Chapter Box  9. Alaskan coastal communities are not the 
only settlements potentially requiring relocation. Subsidence due 
to thawing permafrost and river and delta erosion makes other 
rural communities of Alaska and Russia vulnerable, potentially 
requiring relocation in the future (Bronen, 2015; Romero Manrique 
et al., 2018). These situations raise issues of environmental justice 
and human rights (Bronen, 2017), and illustrate the limits of 
incremental adaptation when transformation change is needed 
(Kates et al., 2012). In other cases, cultural resources in the form of 
historic infrastructure are being threatened and require mitigation 
(Radosavljevic et al., 2015). Responsibility for funding has been a key 
issue in the relocation process (Iverson, 2013) as well as the overall 
role of government and local communities in relocation planning 
(Marino, 2012; Romero Manrique et al., 2018). The Alaska Denali 
Commission, an independent federal agency designed to provide 
critical utilities, infrastructure and economic support throughout 
Alaska, is now serving as the lead coordinating organisation for 
Alaska village relocations and managing federal funding allocations. 
Several efforts have also been undertaken to provide assessment 
frameworks and protocols for settlement relocation as an adaptive 
resource (Bronen, 2015; Ristroph, 2017).
While there has been discussion of future ‘climigration’ in rural Alaska 
(Bronen and Chapin, 2013; Matthews and Potts, 2018), a study of Alaska 
rural villages threated by climate change showed no outmigration 
response (Hamilton et al., 2016). Several factors explain the lack of 
outmigration, including an unwillingness to move, attachment to place, 
people’s inability to relocate, the effectiveness of alternative ways of 
achieving acceptable outcomes and methods of buffering through 
subsidies (Huntington et al., 2018) (medium conﬁdence).
The current pan-Arctic trend of urbanisation (AHDR, 2014), suggests 
that climate change responses related to infrastructure in towns and 
cities of the North will require signiﬁcant adaptation in designs and 
increases in spending (Streletskiy et al., 2012). These costs do not 
include costs related to ﬂooding and other stressors associated with 
warming or additional costs of commercial and industrial operations. 
Engineers in countries with permafrost are actively working to adapt 
the design of structures to degrading permafrost conditions (Dore 
et al., 2016) and the effects of a warming climate, for example the 
Cold Climate Housing Research Center of Alaska.
An analysis of the costs of total damages from climate change 
to public infrastructure in Alaska show the ﬁnancial beneﬁts of 
proactive adaptation (Melvin et al., 2017) (Figure 3.12). In addition 
to global carbon emission mitigation, hardening and redesigning of 
infrastructure can reduce costs of future climate-related impacts. For 
example, retroﬁtting and redesigning of infrastructure in order to 
handle increased precipitation and warmer temperatures can reduce

climate-related costs by 50%, from USD  5.5 to  2.9  billion under 
RCP8.5 by 2100. The cost savings of retroﬁtting and redesigning 
infrastructure is even higher than the savings from carbon mitigation, 
where impact costs are estimated at USD 4.2 billion under RCP4.5 
by 2100. Engineering adaptation provide proportionally similar cost 
savings no matter which emission scenario was used.
3.5.2.7 
Marine Transportation
Increases in Arctic marine transportation create impacts and risks for 
ecosystems and people, such as an increased likelihood of accidents, 
the introduction of invasive species, oil spills, waste discharges, 
detrimental impacts on animals, habitat and subsistence activities 
(Sections  3.2.4.3,  3.4.3.3.2). There has been a  rise in geopolitical 
debate regarding national and international level regulations and 
policies, and maritime infrastructure to support Arctic shipping 
development (Heininen and Finger, 2017; AMAP, 2018; Drewniak 
et al., 2018; Nilsson and Christensen, 2019). Without further action 
leading to adequate implementation of well-developed management 
plans and region-speciﬁc regulations, anticipated future increases in 
Arctic shipping will pose a greater risk to people and ecosystems 
(high conﬁdence).
The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has responsibility for 
the safety and security of shipping and the prevention of marine and 
atmospheric pollution by ships, including in the Arctic and Antarctic. 
There are a  number of mechanisms standardising regulation and 
governance, such as the International Convention for the Prevention 
of Pollution from Ships; the International Convention for the Safety 
of Life at Sea; the International Convention on Standards of Training, 
and the Certiﬁcation and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, and the newly 
implemented International Code for Ships Operating in Polar Waters, 
or Polar Code (IMO, 2017).
The Polar Code of 2017 sets new standards for vessels travelling in 
polar areas to mitigate environmental damage and improve safety 
(IMO, 2017). The Polar Code, however, currently excludes ﬁshing 
vessels and vessels on government service, thereby excluding many 
shipping activities, particularly in the Antarctic region (IMO, 2017). 
Many ships travelling these waters will therefore continue to pose 
risks to the environment and to themselves, as they are not regulated 
under the Polar Code (high conﬁdence). The Polar Code does not 
enhance enforcement capabilities or include environmental protection 
provisions to address a  number of particular polar region-speciﬁc 
risks such as black carbon, ballast water and heavy fuel oil transport 
and use in the Arctic (Anderson, 2012; Sakhuja, 2014; IMO, 2017). 
However, both Russian and Canadian legislation provide the possibility 
for stricter shipping provisions in ice-covered waters. The IMO has 
prohibited the use of heavy fuel oil in the Antarctic.
States can individually or cooperatively pursue the establishment of 
Special Areas and Particularly Sensitive Sea Areas at the IMO with 
a view to protect ecologically unique or vulnerable and economically 
or culturally important areas in national and international waters 
from risks and impacts of shipping, including through routing, 
discharge and equipment measures. Continued, and in some areas, 
greater, international cooperation on shipping governance can 
facilitate addressing emerging climate change issues (Arctic Council, 
2015a; ARR, 2016; PEW Charitable Trust, 2016; Chénier et al., 2017; 
IMO, 2017) (high conﬁdence). Cooperation of the member states of 
the Arctic Council resulted in the 2011 Agreement on Cooperation 
on Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue in the Arctic and 
in the 2013 Agreement on Cooperation on Marine Oil Pollution 
Preparedness and Response in the Arctic. These agreements can, if 
adequately implemented, reduce risks from increased Arctic shipping 
(medium conﬁdence), however, developing more effective measures 
is needed as preparedness and response gaps still exist, for example, 
for the central Arctic Ocean.
Industry has responded to the increase in shipping activity by 
investing in development of shipping designs for travel in mixed-ice 
environments (Stephenson et al., 2011; Stephenson et al., 2013). 
These increases in investments are occurring in spite of the limited 
total savings when comparing shorter travel to increased CO2 
emissions (Lindstad et al., 2016). In anticipation of spills, research 
in several regions has explored oil spill response viability and new 
methods of oil spill response for the Arctic environment (Bullock et al., 
2017; Dilliplaine, 2017; Holst-Andersen et al., 2017; Lewis and Prince, 
2018) (medium conﬁdence). A comparative risk assessment for spills 
has been developed for the Arctic waters (Robinson et al., 2017) and 
Statoil has developed and uses risk assessment decision-support 
tools for environmental management, together with environmental 
monitoring (Utvik and Jahre-Nilsen, 2016). These tools facilitate the 
assessment of Arctic oil-spill response capability, ice detection in 
low visibility, improved management of sea ice and icebergs, and 
numerical modelling of icing and snow as risk mitigation. 
3.5.2.8 
Arctic Human Health and Well Being
At present health adaptation to climate change is generally 
under-represented in policies, planning, and programming (AHDR, 
2014). For instance, all initiatives of the Fifth National Communications 
of Annex I parties to the UNFCCC affect health vulnerability, however, 
only 15% of initiatives had an explicit human health component 
described (Lesnikowski et al., 2011). The Arctic is no exception to 
this global trend. Despite the substantial health risks associated with 
climate change in the Arctic, health adaptation responses remain 
sparse and piecemeal (Lesnikowski et al., 2011; Panic and Ford, 2013; 
Ford et al., 2014b; Loboda, 2014), with the health sector substantially 
under-represented in adaptation initiatives compared to other sectors 
(Pearce et al., 2011; Ford et al., 2014b; National Research Council, 
2015). Furthermore, the geographic distribution of publicly available 
documentation on adaptation initiatives is skewed in the Arctic, with 
more than three-quarters coming from Canada and USA (Ford et al., 
2014a; Loboda, 2014). 
Many Arctic health adaptation efforts by governments have 
been groundwork actions, focused increasing awareness of the 
health impacts of climate change and conducting vulnerability 
assessments (Lesnikowski et al., 2011; Panic and Ford, 2013; Austin 
et al., 2015). For instance, in Canada this effort has included training, 
information resources, frameworks, general outreach and education 
and dissemination of information to decision makers (Austin 
et al., 2015). Finland’s national adaptation strategy outlines various 
267
Polar Regions 
Chapter 3

anticipatory and reactive measures for numerous sectors, including 
health (Gagnon-Lebrun and Agrawala, 2007). In Alaska, the Arctic 
Investigations Program responds to infectious disease via advancing 
molecular diagnostics, integrating data from electronic health records 
and environmental observing networks, as well as improving access 
to in-home water and sanitation services. Furthermore, circumpolar 
efforts are also underway, including a circumpolar working group 
with experts from public health to assess climate-sensitive infectious 
diseases, and to identify initiatives that reduce the risks of disease 
(Parkinson et al., 2014). Importantly, health adaptation is occurring 
at the local scale in the Arctic (Ford et al., 2014a; Ford et al., 2014b). 
Adaptation at the local-scale is broad, ranging from community 
freezers to increase food security, to community-based monitoring 
programs to detect and respond to climate health events, to Elders 
mentoring youth in cultural activities to promote mental health when 
people are ‘stuck’ in the communities due to unsafe travel conditions 
(Pearce et al., 2010; Brubaker et al., 2011; Harper et al., 2012; 
Brubaker et al., 2013; Douglas et al., 2014; Austin et al., 2015; Bunce 
et al., 2016; Cunsolo et al., 2017) (high conﬁdence). Several regional 
and national-level initiatives on food security (ICC, 2012), as well as 
research reporting high levels of household food insecurity (Koﬁnas 
et al., 2016; Watts et al., 2017) have prompted greater concerns for 
climate change (Loring et al., 2013; Beaumier et al., 2015; Islam and 
Berkes, 2016). A new initiative to operationalise One Health concepts 
and approaches under the AC’s Sustainable Development Working 
Group has gained momentum since 2015 (Ruscio et al., 2015). One 
Health approaches seek to link human, animal, and environmental 
health, using interdisciplinary and participatory methods that can 
draw on indigenous knowledge and local knowledge (Dudley 
et al., 2015). Thus far, the initiative has supported new regional-to-
international networks, and proposals for its expansion. In the future, 
the ability to manage, respond, and adapt to climate-related health 
challenges will be a deﬁning issue for the health sector in the Arctic 
(Ford et al., 2010; Durkalec et al., 2015) (medium conﬁdence). 
Table 3.4 |  Response of key human sectors /systems to climate change in polar regions. Table 3.4 summarises the consequences, interacting drivers, responses, and 
assets of climate change responses by select human sectors (i.e., social-ecological systems) of Arctic and Antarctic regions. Also noted are anticipated future conditions 
and level of certainty and other drivers of change that may interact with climate and affect outcomes. Implications to world demands on natural resources, innovation and 
development of technologies, population trends and economic growth are likely to affect all systems, as is the Paris Agreement (AMAP, 2017b). In several cases, drivers of 
change interacting with climate change are regionally speciﬁc and not easily captured. In many cases there is limited information on human responses to climate change 
in the Russian Arctic.

3.5.3 
Governance
3.5.3.1 
Local to National Governance
Responses to climate change at and across local, regional and 
national levels occur directly and indirectly through a broad range 
of governance activities, such as land and sea use planning and 
regulations, economic development strategies, tax incentives for use 
of alternative energy technologies, permitting processes, resource 
management and national security. Increasingly, climate change is 
considered in environmental assessments and proposals for resource 
planning of polar regions. 
A comprehensive literature review of 157 discrete cases of Arctic 
adaptation initiatives by Ford et al. (2014b) found that adaptation 
is primarily local and motivated by reducing risks and their related 
vulnerabilities (high conﬁdence). Several elements for successful 
climate change adaptation planning at the local level have previously 
been identiﬁed: formal analytical models need to be relevant to 
the concerns and needs of stakeholders, experts should be made 
sensitive to community perspectives, information should be packaged 
and communicated in ways that are accessible to non-experts 
and processes of engagement that foster creative problem solving 
be used. Furthermore, success of local government involvement 
in adaptation planning has been closely linked to transnational 
municipal networks that foster social learning and in which local 
governments assume a role as key players (Sheppard et al., 2011; 
Fünfgeld, 2015) (medium conﬁdence). While transnational networks 
can be a catalyst for action and promoting innovation, there remain 
outstanding challenges in measuring the effectiveness of these 
networks (Fünfgeld, 2015). 
Adaptation through formal institutions by Indigenous people is 
enabled through self-government, land claims and co-management 
institutions (Baird et al., 2016; Huet et al., 2017). However, 
organisational capacity is often a  limiting factor in involvement 
(AHDR, 2014; Ford et al., 2014b; Forbes et al., 2015) (high conﬁdence). 
Interactions across scales are also dependent on the extent to which 
various stakeholders are perceived as legitimate in their perceptions 
and recommendations, an issue related to the use of local knowledge 
and indigenous knowledge in governance (Cross-Chapter Box 4 in 
Chapter  1) (AHDR, 2014; Ford et al., 2014b; Forbes et al., 2015) 
(high conﬁdence).

At a more regional level, Alaska’s ‘Climate Action for Alaska’ was 
reconstituted in 2017 and is now actively linking local concerns with 
state-level policies and funding, as well as setting targets for future 
reductions in the state’s carbon emission. The role of cross-scale 
boundary organisations in climate change adaptation planning, and 
how central government initiatives can ultimately translate into 
‘hybrid’ forms of adaptation at the local level that allow for actions 
that are sensitive to local communities has proven important in 
Norway (Dannevig and Aall, 2015). 
At the national level, Norway, Sweden and Finland have engaged 
in the European Climate Adaptation Platform (Climate-ADAPT), 
a partnership that aims to support Europe in adapting to climate 
change by helping users to access and share data and information on 
expected climate change in Europe, current and future vulnerability 
of regions and sectors, national and transnational adaptation 
strategies and actions, adaptation case studies and potential 
adaptation options, and tools that support adaptation planning. 
Level of participation by country and the extent to which national 
level efforts are linked with regional and local adaptation varies. 
The Canadian government’s actions on climate change have been 
among the most extensive of the Arctic nations, including funding of 
ArcticNet, a Network of Centres of Excellence, and consideration of 
climate change by The Northern Contaminants and Nutrition North 
Canada programs. 
3.5.3.2 
International Climate Governance and Law: 
Implications for International Cooperation
The way states and institutions manage international cooperation on 
environmental governance is changing in response to climate change 
in the polar regions. Rather than treating regional impacts of climate 
change and their governance in isolation (i.e., purely with a regional 
lens), the need to cooperate in a  global multi-regulatory fashion 
across several levels of governance is increasingly realised (Stokke, 
2009; Cassotta et al., 2016) (medium conﬁdence).
In both polar regions, cooperative approaches to regional governance 
have been developed to allow for the participation of non-state actors. 
In some cases, regimes allow for a substantial level of participation 
by speciﬁc groups of the civil society (Jabour, 2017; Keil and Knecht, 
2017). For example, in the Antarctic Treaty System, the Antarctic Treaty 
Parties included the Scientiﬁc Committee on Antarctic Research into 
their Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. 
In the Arctic, the status of Permanent Participants has enabled the 
effective participation of Indigenous Peoples in the work of the 
Council (Pincus and Ali, 2016). Climate change has contributed to 
modifying the balance between the interests of state and non-state 
actors, leading to changing forms of cooperation (Young, 2016). 
While such changes and modiﬁcations occur in both the Arctic and 
Antarctic, the role of states has remained present in all the regimes 
and sectors of human responses (Young, 2016; Jabour, 2017).
Addressing the risks of climate change impacts in polar regions also 
requires linking levels of governance and sector governance across 
local to global scales, considering impacts and human adaptation 
(Stokke, 2009; Berkman and Vylegzhanin, 2010; Tuori, 2011; Young, 
2011; Koivurova, 2013; Prior, 2013; Shibata, 2015; Young, 2016) (high 
conﬁdence). Despite established cooperation in international polar 
region governance, several authors have come to the conclusion 
that the current international legal framework is inadequate when 
applying a  precautionary approach at the regional level (medium 
conﬁdence). For example, several studies have shown that the 
Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment of the 
North East Atlantic, which applies only to the North East Atlantic, and 
that provides a framework for implementation of the United Nations 
Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the Convention on 
Biological Diversity (CBD), are insufﬁcient to deal with risks when 
applying a precautionary approach (Jakobsen, 2014; Hossain, 2015). 
In the Arctic, responses to climate change do not only lead to 
international governance cooperation but also to competition 
in access to natural resources, especially hydrocarbons. With ice 
retreating and thinning, and improved access to natural resources, 
coastal states are increasingly recurring to the option to invoke Article 
76 of the UNCLOS (Art. 76 UNCLOS; Verschuuren, 2013) and seek to 
demonstrate with scientiﬁc data, submitted to the Commission on 
the Limits of Continental Shelf, and within a set timeline, that their 
continental shelf is extended. In that case they can enjoy sovereign 
rights beyond the EEZ. It is very unlikely that this new trend from 
states to refer to Article 76 will lead to future (military) conﬂicts 
(Berkman and Vylegzhanin, 2013; Kullerud et al., 2013; Stokke, 2013; 
Verschuuren, 2013), although the issue cannot be totally dismissed 
(Kraska, 2011; Åtland, 2013; Huebert, 2013; Cassotta et al., 2015; 
Barret, 2016; Cassotta et al., 2016). 
In the Antarctic, cooperation in general does occur via UNCLOS, 
the Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea and the Convention for 
the Prevention of Pollution from Ships and the Polar Code. Global 
environmental and climate regimes that are implemented and 
managed through regional regimes (such as the Kyoto Protocol or 
the Paris Agreement) are also relevant for the Antarctic Treaty and 
its Protocol on Environmental Protection, which requires, amongst 
other issues, a  minimisation of adverse environmental impacts. 
Cooperation in the Antarctic also occurs through the the Convention 
for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources. Climate 
change and its consequences for the marine environment are 
a central issue for this Convention because it challenges ways to 
regulate and manage ﬁsheries and designate and manage Marine 
Protected Areas. Nevertheless, CCAMLR has not agreed to any 
climate change program and at its most recent meeting, there was 
again no agreement to do so (Brooks et al. (2018), CCAMLR Report 
on the 37th Meeting of the Commission, CCAMLR (2018)).
3.5.3.2.1 Formal arrangements: polar conventions and institutions
The Arctic Council
International cooperation on issues related to climate change in 
the Arctic mainly occurs at the Arctic Council (herein ‘the Council’), 
and consequently in important areas of its mandate: the (marine) 
environment and scientiﬁc research (Morgera and Kulovesi, 2016; Tesar 
et al., 2016a; Wehrmann, 2016; Young, 2016). The Council is composed 
of eight Arctic States and six Permanent Participants representing 
organisations of Arctic Indigenous peoples. Observers status is open 
270
Chapter 3 
Polar Regions

to: non-Arctic states, intergovernmental and inter-parliamentary 
organisations, global and regional non-governmental organisations 
(NGOs). The Council is an example of cooperation through soft law, 
a unique institutional body that does not possess a legal personality 
and is neither an international law nor a completely state-centric 
institution. However, it is acting state-centric and increasingly 
operating in a context of the Arctic affected by a changing climate, 
globalisation and transnationalism (Baker and Yeager, 2015; Cassotta 
et al., 2015; Pincus and Speth, 2015) (medium conﬁdence). In 2013, 
China, South Korea, Italy, Japan, India and Singapore joined France, 
Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain and the UK as Observers 
states to the Arctic Council; Switzerland was granted Observer status 
in 2017. Non-Arctic States are stimulating the Council towards 
adopting a new approach for Arctic governance that would leave 
greater space for their participation.
Despite lacking the role to enact hard law, three binding agreements 
were negotiated under the auspices of the Council (in its task forces), 
the latest of which is the Agreement on Enhancing International 
Arctic Scientiﬁc Cooperation, which is an indication that the Council 
is preparing a regulatory role to respond to climate change in the 
Arctic using hard-law instruments (Morgera and Kulovesi, 2016; 
Shapovalova, 2016). Through organising the Task Force on Black 
Carbon and Methane (Morgera and Kulovesi, 2016), the Council has 
catalysed action on short-lived climate forcers as the task force was 
followed by the adoption in 2015 of the Arctic Council Framework for 
Action on Enhanced Black Carbon and Methane Emission Reductions. 
In this non-legally binding agreement, Arctic States lay out a common 
vision for national and collective action to accelerate decline in black 
carbon and methane emissions (Shapovalova, 2016). The Council 
thereby moved from merely assessing problems to attempting to 
solve them (Baker and Yeager, 2015; Young, 2016; Koivurova and 
Caddell, 2018). While mitigation of global emissions from fossil fuels 
requires global cooperation, progress with anthropogenic emissions 
of short-term climate forcers (such as black carbon and methane) may 
be achieved through smaller groups of countries (Aakre et al., 2018). 
However, even though the Council has also embraced the Ecosystem 
Approach, it does not have a mandate to manage climate-related risks 
and impacts, or apply a precautionary approach, on ﬁsheries issues.
Several studies have shown that the Council has the potential to 
enhance internal coherence in the current, fragmented landscape 
of multi-regulatory governance by providing integrated leadership. 
However, it is about as likely as not that the Council could play a strong 
role in combatting global climate problems and operating successfully 
within the climate transnational context unless it goes through 
restructuring and reconﬁguration (Stokke, 2013; Baker and Yeager, 
2015; Pincus and Speth, 2015; Cassotta et al., 2016; Tesar et al., 2016a; 
Wehrmann, 2016; Young, 2016; Koivurova and Caddell, 2018). 
The future of the governance of the changing Arctic Ocean, including 
the role of the Council will also depend on the implications of the 
development for a new agreement on the Conservation and Sustainable 
use of Marine Biodiversity of Areas beyond National Jurisdictions under 
the UNCLOS (Baker and Yeager, 2015; De Lucia, 2017; Nengye et al., 
2017; Koivurova and Caddell, 2018) (medium conﬁdence).
The Antarctic Treaty System
The Antarctic Treaty System (ATS) is the collective term for the 
Antarctic Treaty and related agreements. The ATS regulates 
international relations with respect to Antarctica. 54 countries have 
acceded to the Treaty and 29 of them participate in decision making 
as Consultative Parties. 27 countries are Party to the CCAMLR, and 
40 have ratiﬁed the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the 
Antarctic Treaty. The importance of understanding, mitigating and 
adapting to the impacts of changes to the Southern Ocean and 
Antarctic cryosphere has been realised by all of the major bodies 
responsible for governance in the Antarctic region (south of 60ºS). 
The Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties agreed that a  Climate 
Change Response Work Programme would address these matters 
(ATCM, 2016). This led to the establishment of the Subsidiary Group 
of the Committee for Environmental Protection on Climate Change 
Response (ATCM, 2017). By contrast, consensus is currently limiting 
work programme-level responses to climate change by CCAMLR 
(2017a), while opportunities exist to incorporate climate concerns 
into mechanisms for implementation and monitoring aimed to 
conserve ecosystems and the environment (Brooks et al., 2018).
3.5.3.2.2 Informal arrangements
The Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties, through the Committee 
for Environmental Protection (CEP) and its Subsidiary Group of 
the Committee for Environmental Protection on Climate Change 
Response, continue to work closely with the Scientiﬁc Committee on 
Antarctic Research, the Council of Managers of National Antarctic 
Programs, the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators 
and other NGOs to understand, mitigate and adapt to impacts 
associated with changes to the Southern Ocean and Antarctic 
cryosphere. Understanding, mitigating and adapting to climate 
change are among the key priorities identiﬁed for research in the 
region (Kennicutt et al., 2014a; Kennicutt et al., 2014b) and nationally 
funded bilateral and multilateral projects are underway. 
3.5.3.2.3 Role of informal actors
Several studies show that informal actors of the Arctic can inﬂuence 
decision making process of the Council and shift the Council towards 
more cooperation with different actors to enhance the co-production 
of knowledge (Duyck, 2011; Makki, 2012; Keil and Knecht, 2017). 
Recently, non-state observers at the Council, such as the World Wide 
Fund for Nature and the Circumpolar Conservation Union have 
played a role in raising awareness on climate change responses and 
contributing to the work of the Council’s Working Groups and Expert 
Groups (Keil and Knecht, 2017). 
Within the Antarctic Treaty System, several non-state actors play 
a major role in providing advice and inﬂuencing the governance of 
Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. Among the most prominent actors 
are formal observers such as the Scientiﬁc Committee on Antarctic 
Research, and invited experts such as the International Association 
of Antarctica Tour Operators and the Antarctic and Southern Ocean 
Coalition. At meetings of CCAMLR, the Scientiﬁc Committee’s 2009 
report on Antarctic Climate Change and the Environment (Turner 
et al., 2009) precipitated an Antarctic Treaty Meeting of Experts on 
271
Polar Regions 
Chapter 3

Climate Change in 2010 (Antarctic Treaty Meeting of Experts, 2010). 
The outcomes of the meeting led the Antarctic Treaty’s Committee 
for Environmental Protection to develop a Climate Change Response 
Work Programme (ATCM, 2017).
3.5.4 
Towards Resilient Pathways
This section presents the status of practices, tools and strategies 
currently employed in the Arctic and or Antarctica that can potentially 
contribute to climate resilient pathways. Seven general strategies for 
building resilience have been recognised: i) maintain diversity and 
redundancy, ii) manage connectivity, iii) manage slow variables 
and feedbacks, iv) foster an understanding of social-ecological 
systems as complex adaptive systems,  v) encourage learning 
and experimentation, vi) broaden participation, and vii) promote 
polycentric governance systems (Biggs et al., 2012; Quinlan et al., 
2016) (Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 1).
The practices listed below are not inclusive of the many 
resilience-building efforts underway in the polar regions. Those 
described are well represented in the literature and have shown 
sufﬁcient utility to merit further use (ARR, 2016; AMAP, 2017a; AMAP, 
2017b; AMAP, 2018) (high conﬁdence). Some require more reﬁnement 
while others are well developed. The following sections assess the 
extent to which these practices operationalise resilience-building 
through knowledge co-production, the linking of knowledge with 
decision making, and implementation of resilience-based ecosystem 
management, considering also their application level and key 
facilitating conditions; a summary is presented in Table 3.5.
3.5.4.1 
Knowledge Co-production and Integration
The co-production of knowledge and transdisciplinary research are 
currently contributing to the understanding of polar climate change 
through the use of a diversity of cultural, geographic, and disciplinary 
perspectives that provide a  holistic framing of problems and 
possible solutions (Miller and Wyborn, 2018; Robards et al., 2018) 
(high conﬁdence).
Several factors are important in successful knowledge co-production, 
including use of social-ecological frameworks, engagement of 
a broad set actors with diverse epistemological orientations, a ‘team 
science’ approach to studies, strong leadership, attention to process

their contribution to resilience building, considering also seven general strategies (Biggs et al., 2012; Quinlan et al., 2016; Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 1). Also shown

(vs. only products) and mutual respect for cultural differences 
(Meadow et al., 2015; National Research Council, 2015; Petrov 
et al., 2016) (high conﬁdence). Knowledge co-production involving 
Indigenous peoples comes with its own set of challenges (Armitage 
et al., 2011; Robards et al., 2018). While advancements have been 
made, the practice of knowledge co-production would beneﬁt from 
further experimentation and innovation in methodologies and better 
training of researchers (van der Hel, 2016; Vlasova and Volkov, 2016; 
Berkes, 2017) (medium conﬁdence). Three aspects of knowledge 
co-production are highlighted below.
3.5.4.1.1 Community-based monitoring
Community-based monitoring (CBM) in the Arctic has emerged as 
a practice of great interest because of its potential to link western 
ways of knowing with local knowledge and indigenous knowledge 
(Retter et al., 2004; Johnson et al., 2015a; Johnson et al., 2015b; 
Kouril et al., 2016; AMAP, 2017a; Williams et al., 2018). In several 
CBM programs, innovative approaches using the internet, mobile 
phones, hand-held information devices, and camera-equipped 
GPS units are capturing, documenting and communicating local 
observations of change (Brubaker et al., 2011; Brubaker et al., 2013). 
The integration of community observations with instrument-based 
observations and its use in research has proven challenging, with 
technical and cultural issues (Grifﬁth et al., 2018). Execution of 
CBM programs in the Arctic has also proven to be labour intensive 
and difﬁcult to sustain, requiring long-term ﬁnancial support, 
agreements specifying data ownership, sufﬁcient human capital, 
and in some cases, the involvement of boundary organisations that 
provide technical support (Pulsifer et al., 2012; Eicken et al., 2014) 
and link CBM with governance (CAFF, 2015b; Robards et al., 2018). 
As is the case in all knowledge production, power relationships 
(i.e., who decides what is a legitimate observation, who has access to 
resources for involvement and who beneﬁts) have been challenging 
where the legitimacy of local knowledge and indigenous knowledge 
is questioned (e.g., Pristupa et al., 2018). There is high agreement 
and limited evidence that CBM facilitates knowledge co-production 
and resilience building. More analyses of Arctic communities and 
their institutional capabilities related to CBM are needed to evaluate 
the potential of these observation systems, and experimentation 
and innovation may help determine how CBM can more effectively 
inform decision making beyond the community (Johnson et al., 
2015a; Johnson et al., 2015b) (medium conﬁdence).
3.5.4.1.2 Understanding regime shifts
Regime shifts are especially important in polar regions where there 
are limited data and where rapid directional change suggests the 
possibility of crossing thresholds that may dramatically alter the 
ﬂow of ecosystem services (ARR, 2016). Better understanding of the 
thresholds and dynamics of regime shifts (i.e., SES state changes) is 
especially important for resilience building (ARR, 2016; Biggs et al., 
2018; Rocha et al., 2018) (high conﬁdence). While polar regime shifts 
have been documented (Biggs et al., 2018), most are poorly understood 
and rarely predictable (Rocha et al., 2018) (high conﬁdence). 
Moreover, the focus on Arctic regime shifts to date has been on almost 
entirely on biophysical state changes that impact social systems. 
A limited number of studies have examined social regime shifts and 
fewer the feedbacks of social regimes shifts on ecosystems (Gerlach 
et al., 2017). Future needs for advancing knowledge of regime shifts 
include: 1) continued and reﬁned updating of details on past regimes 
shifts,  2) structured comparative analysis of these phenomena to 
ascertain common patterns and variation, 3) greater investment in 
research resources on potential large-scale regime shifts, and 4) great 
attention on how social and economic change may affect ecosystems 
(ARR, 2016; Biggs et al., 2018).
3.5.4.1.3 Indicators of resilience and adaptive capacity
Well-crafted and effectively communicated indicators of polar 
geophysical, ecological and human systems have the potential to 
make complex issues more easily understood by society, including 
local residents and policy makers seeking to assess the implication of 
climate change (Petrov et al., 2016; Carson and Sommerkorn, 2017) 
(medium conﬁdence). Having indicators of change is no guarantee 
they will be used; access to information, awareness of changing 
conditions, and the motivation to act are also important (e.g., van der 
Linden et al., 2015).
Indicators of the state of polar geophysical systems, biodiversity, 
ecosystems and human well-being are monitored as part of polar 
programs. For example, indicators are reported by the Arctic Council 
working groups Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme and 
Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna (e.g.,  Odland et al., 2016; 
CAFF, 2017; Box et al., 2019), the International Arctic Social Science 
Association (e.g., AHDR, 2014), the CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring 
Programme (e.g., Reid et al., 2005) and the Southern Ocean Observing 
System (e.g., Meredith et al., 2013).
There is limited development of indicators of social-ecological 
resilience (Jarvis et al., 2013; Carson and Sommerkorn, 2017). As 
well, indicators of human adaptive capacity are typically based on 
qualitative case studies with limited quantitative data, and thus 
have limited comparability and generalisability (Ford and King, 
2013; Petrov et al., 2016; Berman et al., 2017) (high conﬁdence). 
The identiﬁcation and on-going use of indicators of social-ecological 
resilience are theoretically best achieved through highly participatory 
processes that engage stakeholders of a locale, with those processes 
potentially resulting in self-reﬂection and actions that improve 
adaptive capacity (Quinlan et al., 2016; Carson and Sommerkorn, 
2017), however, this is untested empirically (low conﬁdence).
3.5.4.2 
Linking Knowledge with Decision Making
While there is a growing expectation in polar (and other) regions for 
a  more deliberate strategy to link science with social learning and 
policy making about climate change (and other matters) through 
iterative interactions of researchers, managers and other stakeholders, 
meeting that expectation is confounded by several deeply rooted 
issues (Armitage et al., 2011; ARR, 2016; Tesar et al., 2016b; Baztan 
et al., 2017; Forbis Jr and Hayhoe, 2018) (medium conﬁdence). 
In spite of the development of practices like those described above 
and the establishment of many co-managed arrangements in polar 
273
Polar Regions 
Chapter 3
3
regions, scientists and policy makers often work in separate spheres 
of inﬂuence, tend to maintain different values, interests, concerns, 
responsibilities and perspectives, and gain limited exposure to the 
other’s knowledge system (see Liu et al., 2008; Armitage et al., 
2011). Information exchange ﬂows unequally, as ofﬁcials struggle 
with information overload and proliferating institutional voices, 
and where local residents are mistrusting of scientists (Powledge, 
2012). Inherent tensions between science-based assessment and 
interest-based policy, and many existing institutions often prevent 
direct connectivity. Further, the longstanding science mandate 
to remain ‘policy neutral’ typically leads to norms of constrained 
interaction (Neff, 2009) (high conﬁdence). 
Creating pathways towards greater climate resilience will therefore 
depend, in part, on a  redeﬁned ‘actionable science’ that creates 
bridges supporting better decisions through more rigorous, accessible, 
and engaging products, while shaping a narrative that instils public 
conﬁdence (Beier et al., 2015; Fleming and Pyenson, 2017) (high 
conﬁdence). Stakeholders of polar regions are increasingly using 
a  suite of creative tools and practices for moving from theory to 
practice in resilience building by informing decision making and 
fostering long-term planning (Baztan et al., 2017). As noted above, 
these practices include participatory scenario planning, forecasting 
for stakeholders, and use structured decision making, solution 
visualisation tools and decision theatres (e.g., Schartmüller et al., 2015;  
Koﬁnas et al., 2016; Garrett et al., 2017; Holst-Andersen et al., 
2017; Camus and Smit, 2019). The extent to which these practices 
can contribute to resilience building in the future will depend, in part, 
on the willingness of key actors such as scientists, to provide active 
decision-support services, more often than mere decision-support 
products (Beier et al., 2015). While progress has been made in linking 
science with policy, more enhanced data collaboration at every 
scale, more strategic social engagement, communication that both 
informs decisions and improves climate literacy and explicit creation 
of consensus documents that provide interpretive guidance about 
research implications and alternative choices will be important 
(high conﬁdence).
3.5.4.2.1 Participatory scenario analysis and planning
Participatory scenario analysis is a  quickly evolving and widely 
used practice in polar regions, and has proven particularly useful 
for supporting climate adaptation at multiple scales when it uses 
a  social-ecological perspective (ARR, 2016; AMAP, 2017a; Crépin 
et al., 2017; Planque et al., 2019) (medium conﬁdence). While there 
are technical dimensions in scenario analysis and planning (e.g., the 
building of useful simulation models that capture and communicate 
nuanced social-ecological system dynamics such as long-fuse big 
bang processes, pathological dynamics, critical thresholds, and 
unforeseen processes (Crépin et al., 2017), there are also creative 
aspects, such as the use of art to help in the visualisation of possible 
future (e.g., Planque et al., 2019).
Participatory scenario analysis has been applied to various problem 
areas related to climate change responses in the polar regions. 
Applications demonstrate the utility of the practice for identifying 
possible local futures that consider climate change or socioeconomic 
pathways (e.g.,  in Alaska, Ernst and van Riemsdijk, 2013; and in 
Eurasian reindeer-herding systems, van Oort et al., 2015; Nilsson 
et al., 2017) and interacting drivers of change (e.g., in Antarctica; 
Liggett et al., 2017). Scenario analysis proved helpful for stakeholders 
with different expertise and perspectives to jointly develop scenarios 
to inform ecosystem-based management strategies and adaptation 
options (e.g., in the Barents region; Nilsson et al., 2017; Planque et al., 
2019) and to identify research needs (e.g., in Alaska; Vargas-Moreno 
et al., 2016), including informing and applying climate downscaling 
efforts (e.g., in Alaska; Ernst and van Riemsdijk, 2013).
A review of scenario analysis in the Arctic, however, found that while 
the practice is widespread and many are using best practice methods, 
less than half scenarios programs incorporated climate projections 
and that those utilising a  backcasting approach had higher local 
participation than those only using forecasting (Flynn et al., 2018). 
It noted that integrating different knowledge systems and attention 
to cultural factors inﬂuence program utility and acceptance. Planque 
et al. (2019) also found that most participating stakeholders had 
limited experience using scenario analysis, suggesting the importance 
of process methods for engaging stakeholders when exploring 
possible, likely, and desirable futures. The long-term utility of this 
practice in helping stakeholders engage with each other to envision 
possible futures and be forward thinking in decision making will 
depend on the science of climate projections, further development 
of decision support systems to inform decision makers, attention to 
cultural factors and worldview, as well as reﬁnement of processes 
that facilitate participants’ dialogue (medium conﬁdence).
3.5.4.2.2 Structured decision making
Structured decision making (SDM) is an emerging practice used with 
stakeholders to identify alternative actions, evaluate trade-offs, and 
inform decisions in complex situations (Gregory et al., 2012). Few 
SDM processes have been undertaken in polar regions, with most 
as exploratory demonstration projects led by researchers. These have 
included indigenous residents and researchers identifying trade-offs 
and actions related to subsistence harvesting in a  changing 
environment (Christie et al., 2018) stakeholder interviews to show 
how a ‘triage method’ can link community monitoring with community 
needs and wildlife management priorities (Wheeler et al., 2018), and 
the application of multi-criteria decision analysis to address difﬁcult 
decisions related to mining opportunities in Greenland (Trump et al., 
2018). The Decision Theater North at the University of Alaska is also 
being explored as an innovative method of decision support (Koﬁnas 
et al., 2016). SDM may have potential in creating climate resilience 
pathways in polar regions (low conﬁdence), but there is currently 
limited experience with its application.
3.5.4.3 
Resilience-based Ecosystem Stewardship
Renewable resource management and biodiversity conservation that 
seek to maintain resources in historic levels and reduce uncertainty 
before taking action remains the dominant paradigm in polar regions 
(Chapin III et al., 2009; Forbes et al., 2015). The effectiveness of this 
approach, however, is increasingly challenged as the ranges and 
populations of species and state of ecosystems are being affected 
274
Chapter 3 
Polar Regions

by climate change (Chapin III et al., 2010; Chapin III et al., 2015). 
Three practices that build and maintain social-ecological resilience in 
the face of climate change include Adaptive Ecosystem Governance, 
Spatial Planning for Biodiversity, and Linking Management of 
Ecosystem Services with Human Livelihoods. 
3.5.4.3.1 Adaptive ecosystem governance
‘Adaptive Ecosystem Governance’ differs from conventional resource 
management or integrated ecosystem management (Chapin III et al., 
2009; Chapin III et al., 2010; Chapin III et al., 2015), with a strong 
focus on trajectories of change (i.e.,  emergence), implying that 
maintaining ecosystems in a  state of equilibrium is not possible 
(Biggs et al., 2012; ARR, 2016). This approach strengthens response 
options by maintaining or increasing resource diversity (to support 
human adaptation) and biological diversity (to support ecosystem 
adaptation) (Biggs et al., 2012; Chapin III et al., 2015; Quinlan 
et al., 2016) (high conﬁdence). Adaptive ecosystem governance 
emphasises iterative social learning processes of observing, 
understanding and acting with collaborative partnerships, such as 
adaptive co-management arrangements currently used in regions of 
the Arctic (Armitage et al., 2009; Dale and Armitage, 2011; Chapin III 
et al., 2015; Arp et al., 2019). This approach is also currently realised 
through adaptive management of Arctic ﬁsheries in Alaska that 
combines annual measures and within-season provisions informed 
by assessments of future ecosystem trends (Section 3.5.2.1), and the 
use of simulation models with Canadian caribou co-management 
boards to assess the cumulative effects of proposed land use change 
with climate change (Gunn et al., 2011; Russell, 2014a; Russell, 
2014b). Linking these regional efforts to pan-polar programs can 
enhance resilience building cross multiple scales (e.g., Gunn et al., 
2013) (medium conﬁdence).
3.5.4.3.2 Spatial planning for biodiversity
Shifts in the distribution, abundance and human use of species and 
populations due to climate-induced cryosphere and ocean change, 
concurrent with land use changes, increase the risks to ecosystem 
health and biodiversity (Kaiser et al., 2015). Building resilience in these 
challenging conditions follows from spatial planning for biodiversity 
that links multiple scales and considers how impacts to ecosystems 
may materialise in social-ecological systems elsewhere (Bengtsson 
et al., 2003; Cumming, 2011; Allen et al., 2016). Developing pathways 
for spatial resilience in polar regions involves systematic planning 
and designating networks of protected areas to protect connected 
tracts of representative habitats, and biologically and ecologically 
signiﬁcant features (Ban et al., 2014). Protected area networks 
that combine both spatially rigid and spatially ﬂexible regimes 
with climate refugia can support ecological resilience to climate 
change by maintaining connectivity of populations, foodwebs, and 
the ﬂow of genes across scales (McLeod et al., 2009). This approach 
reduces direct pressures on biodiversity, and thus gives biological 
communities, populations and ecosystems the space to adapt 
(Nyström and Folke, 2001; Hope et al., 2013; Thomas and Gillingham, 
2015) (medium conﬁdence). Networks of protected areas are now 
being planned (Solovyev et al., 2017) and implemented (Juvonen and 
Kuhmonen, 2013) in the marine and terrestrial Arctic, respectively; 
expanding the terrestrial protected area network in Antarctica is 
discussed (Coetzee et al., 2017). The planning of protected area 
networks in polar regions is currently an active topic of international 
collaboration in both polar regions (Arctic Council, 2015b; CCAMLR, 
2016a; Wenzel et al., 2016). Designating marine protected area 
networks contributes to achieving Sustainable Development Goal 
14 and the Aichi Targets of the CBD but is often contested due to 
competing interests for marine resources. 
3.5.4.3.3 Linking eosystem services with human livelihoods
Incorporating measures of ecosystem services into assessments 
is key in integrating environmental, economic, and social policies 
that build resilience to climate change in polar regions (CAFF, 
2015a; Malinauskaite et al., 2019; Sarkki and Acosta García, 2019) 
(high conﬁdence). Currently, there is limited recognition of the 
wide range of beneﬁts people receive from polar ecosystems and 
a  lack of management tools that demonstrate their beneﬁts in 
decision-making processes (CAFF, 2015a). The concept of ecosystem 
services is increasingly used in the Arctic, yet there continues to be 
signiﬁcant knowledge gaps in mapping, valuation, and the study 
of the social implications of changes in ecosystem services. There 
are few Arctic examples of the application of ecosystem services in 
management (Malinauskaite et al., 2019). A strategy of ecosystem 
stewardship, therefore, is to maintain a continued ﬂow of ecosystem 
services, recognising how their beneﬁts provide incentives for 
preserving biodiversity, while also ensuring options for sustainable 
development 
and 
ecosystem-based 
adaptation 
(Chapin 
III 
et al., 2015; Guerry et al., 2015; Díaz et al., 2019). Arctic stewardship 
opportunities at landscape, seascape, and community scales to 
a great extent lie in supporting culturally engrained (often traditional 
indigenous) values of respect for land and animals, and reliance on 
the local environment through the sharing of knowledge and power 
between local users of renewable resources and agencies responsible 
for managing resources (Mengerink et al., 2017) (high conﬁdence). In 
the Antarctic, ecosystem stewardship is dependent on international 
formally-deﬁned and informally-enacted cooperation, and the 
recognition of its service to the global community (Section 3.5.3.2).

Synopsis
This chapter has assessed the consequences of climate change in the 
polar regions in three sections, focusing on sea ice and the ocean 
(Section 3.2), glaciers and ice sheets (Section 3.3), and permafrost and 
snow on land (Section 3.4). A systems approach was taken to assess 
individual and interacting changes within and between these elements 
to consider consequences, impacts and risks for marine and terrestrial 
ecosystems and for people. Mapping on to those observed and 
projected impacts, Section 3.5 assessed human responses to climate 
change in the polar regions. This brief synopsis considers the chapter 
ﬁndings across sections, and draws out three key assessment points 
that inform global responses to polar ocean and cryosphere change.
275
Polar Regions 
Chapter 3

1. Climate-induced changes to the polar cryosphere and oceans 
have global consequences and impacts. 
Loss of Arctic sea ice continues to add to global radiative forcing and 
has the potential to inﬂuence mid-latitude weather on timescales of 
weeks to months (Section 3.2.1 Box 3.2), the Southern Ocean takes 
up a disproportionately high amount of atmospheric heat and carbon 
(Section 3.2.1), melting polar glaciers and the AIS and GIS contribute 
to observed and projected sea level rise long into the future 
(Sections 3.3.1, 3.3.2), and projected widespread disappearance of 
permafrost has the potential to accelerate global warming through 
the release of carbon dioxide and methane (Sections 3.4.2, 3.4.3).
2. Across many aspects, the polar regions of the future will appear 
signiﬁcantly different from those of today.
By the end of this century, Arctic sea ice and snow on land are projected 
to be diminished compared with today, as are the masses of the AIS and 
GIS and the polar glaciers (Sections 3.2.2, 3.3.2; 3.4.2). Acidiﬁcation 
of both polar oceans will have progressed; this, and changing marine 
habitats associated with ocean warming, are projected to impact 
marine ecosystems (Sections  3.2.2,  3.2.3). Permafrost thaw and 
decrease in snow on land are projected to drive habitat and biome 
shifts, affecting ranges and abundance of ecologically important 
species, and driving changes in wildﬁre, vegetation and human 
infrastructure (Sections 3.4.2, 3.4.3). Collectively, these very different 
future polar environments pose strong challenges to sustainable use 
of natural resources, infrastructure, cultures and lives and livelihoods. 
Although manifested locally, these very different future polar 
environments have the potential to continue/accelerate the global 
impacts noted above. 
3. Choices are available that will inﬂuence the nature and magnitude 
of changes, potentially limiting their regional and global impacts 
and increasing the effectiveness of adaptation actions. 
Compared with high greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, projections 
using low emissions scenarios result in polar regions that will 
be signiﬁcantly less altered. For example, for stabilised global 
warming of  1.5ºC, a  sea ice-free Arctic in September is projected 
to occur signiﬁcantly less frequently than at 2ºC (1% c.f. 10–35%) 
(Section  3.2.2). The potential for reduced but stabilised Arctic 
autumn and spring snow extent by mid-century for RCP2.6 contrasts 
with continued loss under RCP8.5, and the area with near-surface 
permafrost is projected to decrease less by 2100 under RCP2.6 than 
under RCP8.5 (Section  3.4.2). Polar glaciers are projected to lose 
much less mass between 2015 and 2100 under RCP2.6 compared 
with RCP8.5 (Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 2). Acidiﬁcation of the 
polar oceans will progress more slowly and affect much smaller areas 
under RCP2.6 compared with RCP8.5 (Section 3.2.2). These differences 
have strong implications for natural resource management, economic 
sectors and Arctic cultures (Section 3.5.2). The choices that enable 
these differences inﬂuence the rate and magnitude of polar change, 
their consequences and impacts at regional and global scales, the 
effectiveness of adaptation and opportunities for climate resilient 
pathways (Section 3.5.4).
3.7 
Key Knowledge Gaps and Uncertainties
Beyond this report, progress requires that future assessments 
demonstrate increased conﬁdence in various key aspects; this can be 
achieved by narrowing numerous gaps in knowledge. Some of the 
critical ones, which are priorities for future initiatives, are outlined here.
Overturning circulation in the Southern Ocean is a key factor that 
controls heat and carbon exchanges with the atmosphere, and hence 
global climate, however there are no direct measures of this and only 
sparse indirect indicators of how it may be changing. This is a critical 
weakness in sustained observations of the global ocean.
Snow depth on sea ice is essentially unmeasured, limiting mass 
balance estimates and ice thickness retrievals. Improved mechanistic 
understanding of the observed changes and trends in Antarctic sea 
ice is required, notably the decadal increase and very recent rapid 
retreat. This has consequences for climate, ecosystems and ﬁsheries; 
however, lack of understanding and poor model performance 
translates to very limited predictive skill. 
Trends in snow water equivalent over Arctic land are inadequately 
known, reducing conﬁdence in assessments of snow’s role in 
the water cycle and in insulating the underlying permafrost. 
Understanding of precipitation in the polar regions is critically 
limited by sparse observations, and there is a lack of understanding 
of the processes that drive regional variability in wetting/drying and 
greening/browning of the Arctic land surface. There is inadequate 
knowledge concerning carbon dioxide and methane emissions from 
land and sub-sea permafrost. 
There are clear regional gaps in knowledge of polar ecosystems and 
biodiversity, and insufﬁcient population estimates/trends for many 
key species. Biodiversity projections are limited by key uncertainties 
regarding the potential for organisms to adapt to habitat change 
and the resilience of foodweb structures. Relatedly, knowledge gaps 
exist concerning how ﬁsheries target levels will change alongside 
environmental change and how to incorporate this into decision 
making. Similarly, there are knowledge gaps on the extent to which 
changes in the availability of resources to subsistence harvesters 
affects food security of households. 
There is a need to better understand the evolution of polar glaciers 
and ice sheets, and their inﬂuences on global sea level. Longer and 
improved quantiﬁcations of their changes are required, especially 
where mass losses are greatest, and (relatedly) better attribution of 
natural versus anthropogenic drivers. Better understanding of the 
sensitivity of Antarctica to marine ice sheet instability is required, 
and whether recent changes in West Antarctica represent the onset 
of irreversible change.
There are critical gaps in knowledge concerning interactions between 
the atmosphere and speciﬁc elements of the polar ocean and 
cryosphere. Detailed assessment of atmospheric processes was outside 
the remit of this chapter, however such gaps limit understanding of 
ongoing and future trajectories of the polar regions and their climate 
systems. Relatedly, there is a paucity of studies analysing differences 
276
Chapter 3 
Polar Regions

in the trajectories of polar cryosphere and ocean systems between low 
and very low greenhouse gas emission scenarios.
There are critical needs to better understand the efﬁcacy and limits 
of strategies for reducing risk and strengthening resilience for polar 
ecosystems and people, including the contribution of practices and 
tools to contribute to climate resilient pathways. Knowledge on how 
to translate existing theoretical understandings of social-ecological 
resilience into decision making and governance is limited. There is 
limited understanding concerning the resources that are needed 
for successful adaptation responses and about the effectiveness of 
institutions in supporting adaptation. While the occurrence of regime 
shifts in polar systems is both documented and anticipated, there is 
little or no understanding of their preconditions or of indicators that 
would help pre-empt them.
Frequently Asked Questions
FAQ 3.1 | 
How do changes in the Polar Regions affect other parts of the world?
Climate change in the Arctic and Antarctic affect people outside of the polar regions in two key ways. First, physical and 
ecosystem changes in the polar regions have socioeconomic impacts that extend across the globe. Second, physical changes in 
the Arctic and Antarctic inﬂuence processes that are important for global climate and sea level.
Among the risks to societies and economies, aspects of food provision, transport and access to non-renewable 
resources are of great importance. Fisheries in the polar oceans support regional and global food security and 
are important for the economies of many countries around the world, but climate change alters Arctic and 
Antarctic marine habitats, and affects the ability of polar species and ecosystems to withstand or adapt to 
physical changes. This has consequences for where, when, and how many ﬁsh can be captured. Impacts will 
vary between regions, depending on the degree of climate change and the effectiveness of human responses. 
While management in some polar ﬁsheries is among the most developed, scientists are exploring modiﬁcations 
to existing precautionary, ecosystem-based management approaches to increase the scope for adaptation to 
climate change impacts on marine ecosystems and ﬁsheries.
New shipping routes through the Arctic offer cost savings because they are shorter than traditional passages 
via the Suez or Panama Canals. Ship trafﬁc has already increased and is projected to become more feasible 
in the coming decades as further reductions in sea ice cover make Arctic routes more accessible. Increased 
Arctic shipping has signiﬁcant socioeconomic and political implications for global trade, northern nations and 
economies strongly linked to traditional shipping corridors, while also increasing environmental risk in the Arctic. 
Reduced Arctic sea ice cover allows greater access to offshore petroleum resources and ports supporting resource 
extraction on land.
The polar regions inﬂuence the global climate through a number of processes. As spring snow and summer sea 
ice cover decrease, more heat is absorbed at the surface. There is growing evidence that ongoing changes in 
the Arctic, primarily sea ice loss, can potentially inﬂuence mid-latitude weather. As temperatures increase in the 
Arctic, permafrost soils in northern regions store less carbon. The release of carbon dioxide and methane from 
the land to the atmosphere further contributes to global warming.
Melting ice sheets and glaciers in the polar regions cause sea levels to rise, affecting coastal regions and their 
large populations and economies. At present, the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) and polar glaciers are contributing 
more to sea level rise than the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS). However, ice loss from the AIS has continued to accelerate, 
driven primarily by increased melting of the underside of ﬂoating ice shelves, which has caused glaciers to ﬂow 
faster. Even though it remains difﬁcult to project the amount of ice loss from Antarctica after the second half of 
the 21st century, it is expected to contribute signiﬁcantly to future sea level rise.
The Southern Ocean that surrounds Antarctica is the main region globally where waters at depth rise to the 
surface. Here, they become transformed into cold, dense waters that sink back to the deep ocean, storing 
signiﬁcant amounts of human-produced heat and dissolved carbon for decades to centuries or longer, and 
helping to slow the rate of global warming in the atmosphere. Future changes in the strength of this ocean 
circulation can so far only be projected with limited certainty.
