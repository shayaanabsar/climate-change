Executive summary
The land challenges, in the context of this report, are 
climate change mitigation, adaptation, desertification, land 
degradation, and food security. The chapter also discusses 
implications for Nature’s Contributions to People (NCP), including 
biodiversity and water, and sustainable development, by assessing 
intersections with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The 
chapter assesses response options that could be used to address these 
challenges. These response options were derived from the previous 
chapters and fall into three broad categories: land management, 
value chain, and risk management.
The land challenges faced today vary across regions; climate 
change will increase challenges in the future, while socio-
economic development could either increase or decrease 
challenges (high confidence). Increases in biophysical impacts from 
climate change can worsen desertification, land degradation, and 
food insecurity (high confidence). Additional pressures from socio-
economic development could further exacerbate these challenges; 
however, the effects are scenario dependent. Scenarios with increases 
in income and reduced pressures on land can lead to reductions in 
food insecurity; however, all assessed scenarios result in increases in 
water demand and water scarcity (medium confidence). {6.1} 
The applicability and efficacy of response options are 
region and context specific; while many value chain and risk 
management options are potentially broadly applicable, many 
land management options are applicable on less than 50% of 
the ice-free land surface (high confidence). Response options 
are limited by land type, bioclimatic region, or local food system 
context (high confidence). Some response options produce adverse 
side effects only in certain regions or contexts; for example, response 
options that use freshwater may have no adverse side effects in 
regions where water is plentiful, but large adverse side effects in 
regions where water is scarce (high confidence). Response options 
with biophysical climate effects (e.g., afforestation, reforestation) 
may have different effects on local climate, depending on where they 
are implemented (medium confidence). Regions with more challenges 
have fewer response options available for implementation (medium 
confidence). {6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4}
Nine options deliver medium-to-large benefits for all five land 
challenges (high confidence). The options with medium-to-large 
benefits for all challenges are increased food productivity, improved 
cropland management, improved grazing land management, 
improved livestock management, agroforestry, forest management, 
increased soil organic carbon content, fire management and reduced 
post-harvest losses. A further two options, dietary change and reduced 
food waste, have no global estimates for adaptation but have medium-
to-large benefits for all other challenges (high confidence). {6.3, 6.4}
Five options have large mitigation potential (>3 GtCO2e yr–1) 
without adverse impacts on the other challenges (high 
confidence). These are: increased food productivity; reduced 
deforestation and forest degradation; increased soil organic 
carbon content; fire management; and reduced post-harvest losses. 
Two further options with large mitigation potential, dietary change 
and reduced food waste, have no global estimates for adaptation 
but show no negative impacts across the other challenges. 
Five  options: improved cropland management; improved grazing 
land managements; agroforestry; integrated water management; 
and forest management, have moderate mitigation potential, with 
no adverse impacts on the other challenges (high confidence). {6.3.6}
Sixteen response options have large adaptation potential (more 
than 25 million people benefit), without adverse side effects 
on other land challenges (high confidence). These are increased 
food productivity, improved cropland management, agroforestry, 
agricultural diversification, forest management, increased soil 
organic carbon content, reduced landslides and natural hazards, 
restoration and reduced conversion of coastal wetlands, reduced 
post-harvest losses, sustainable sourcing, management of supply 
chains, improved food processing and retailing, improved energy 
use in food systems, livelihood diversification, use of local seeds, and 
disaster risk management (high confidence). Some options (such as 
enhanced urban food systems or management of urban sprawl) may 
not provide large global benefits but may have significant positive 
local effects without adverse effects (high confidence). {6.3, 6.4}
Seventeen of 40  options deliver co-benefits or no adverse 
side effects for the full range of NCPs and SDGs; only three 
options (afforestation, bioenergy and bioenergy with carbon 
capture and storage (BECCS), and some types of risk sharing 
instruments, such as insurance) have potentially adverse side 
effects for five or more NCPs or SDGs (medium confidence). 
The 17 options with co-benefits and no adverse side effects include 
most agriculture- and soil-based land management options, many 
ecosystem-based land management options, forest management, 
reduced post-harvest losses, sustainable sourcing, improved 
energy use in food systems, and livelihood diversification (medium 
confidence). Some of the synergies between response options and 
SDGs include positive poverty eradication impacts from activities like 
improved water management or improved management of supply 
chains. Examples of synergies between response options and NCPs 
include positive impacts on habitat maintenance from activities 
like invasive species management and agricultural diversification. 
However, many of these synergies are not automatic, and are 
dependent on well-implemented activities requiring institutional and 
enabling conditions for success. {6.4}
Most response options can be applied without competing for 
available land; however, seven options result in competition 
for land (medium confidence). A large number of response options 
do not require dedicated land, including several land management 
options, all value chain options, and all risk management options. 
Four options could greatly increase competition for land if applied 
at scale: afforestation, reforestation, and land used to provide 
feedstock for BECCS or biochar, with three further options: reduced 
grassland conversion to croplands, restoration and reduced 
conversion of peatlands and restoration, and reduced conversion of 
coastal wetlands having smaller or variable impacts on competition 
for land. Other options such as reduced deforestation and forest 
degradation, restrict land conversion for other options and uses.

Expansion of the current area of managed land into natural 
ecosystems could have negative consequences for other land 
challenges, lead to the loss of biodiversity, and adversely affect 
a range of NCPs (high confidence). {6.3.6, 6.4}
Some options, such as bioenergy and BECCS, are scale 
dependent. The climate change mitigation potential for 
bioenergy and BECCS is large (up to 11 GtCO2 yr–1); however, 
the effects of bioenergy production on land degradation, food 
insecurity, water scarcity, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and 
other environmental goals are scale- and context-specific (high 
confidence). These effects depend on the scale of deployment, initial 
land use, land type, bioenergy feedstock, initial carbon stocks, climatic 
region and management regime (high confidence). Large areas of 
monoculture bioenergy crops that displace other land uses can result 
in land competition, with adverse effects for food production, food 
consumption, and thus food security, as well as adverse effects for land 
degradation, biodiversity, and water scarcity (medium confidence). 
However, integration of bioenergy into sustainably managed 
agricultural landscapes can ameliorate these challenges (medium 
confidence). {6.2, 6.3, 6.4, Cross-Chapter Box 7 in this chapter}
Response options are interlinked; some options (e.g., land 
sparing and sustainable land management options) can 
enhance the co-benefits or increase the potential for other 
options (medium confidence). Some response options can be 
more effective when applied together (medium confidence); for 
example, dietary change and waste reduction expand the potential to 
apply other options by freeing as much as 5.8 Mkm2 (0.8–2.4 Mkm2 
for dietary change; about 2 Mkm2 for reduced post-harvest losses, 
and 1.4 Mkm2 for reduced food waste) of land (low confidence). 
Integrated water management and increased soil organic carbon can 
increase food productivity in some circumstances. {6.4}
Other response options (e.g., options that require land) may 
conflict; as a result, the potentials for response options are not 
all additive, and a total potential from the land is currently 
unknown (high confidence). Combining some sets of options 
(e.g., those that compete for land) may mean that maximum potentials 
cannot be realised, for example, reforestation, afforestation, and 
bioenergy and BECCS, all compete for the same finite land resource 
so the combined potential is much lower than the sum of potentials 
of each individual option, calculated in the absence of alternative 
uses of the land (high confidence). Given the interlinkages among 
response options and that mitigation potentials for individual options 
assume that they are applied to all suitable land, the total mitigation 
potential is much lower than the sum of the mitigation potential of 
the individual response options (high confidence). {6.4} 
The feasibility of response options, including those with 
multiple co-benefits, is limited due to economic, technological, 
institutional, socio-cultural, environmental and geophysical 
barriers (high confidence). A number of response options (e.g., most 
agriculture-based land management options, forest management, 
reforestation and restoration) have already been implemented 
widely to date (high confidence). There is robust evidence that many 
other response options can deliver co-benefits across the range of 
land challenges, yet these are not being implemented. This limited 
application is evidence that multiple barriers to implementation of 
response options exist (high confidence). {6.3, 6.4}
Coordinated action is required across a range of actors, 
including business, producers, consumers, land managers, 
indigenous peoples and local communities and policymakers 
to create enabling conditions for adoption of response options 
(high confidence). The response options assessed face a variety of 
barriers to implementation (economic, technological, institutional, 
socio-cultural, environmental and geophysical) that require action 
across multiple actors to overcome (high confidence). There are 
a variety of response options available at different scales that could 
form portfolios of measures applied by different stakeholders – from 
farm to international scales. For example, agricultural diversification 
and use of local seeds by smallholders can be particularly useful 
poverty eradication and biodiversity conservation measures, but are 
only successful when higher scales, such as national and international 
markets and supply chains, also value these goods in trade regimes, 
and consumers see the benefits of purchasing these goods. However, 
the land and food sectors face particular challenges of institutional 
fragmentation, and often suffer from a lack of engagement between 
stakeholders at different scales (medium confidence). {6.3, 6.4}
Delayed action will result in an increased need for response 
to land challenges and a decreased potential for land-based 
response options due to climate change and other pressures 
(high confidence). For example, failure to mitigate climate change 
will increase requirements for adaptation and may reduce the efficacy 
of future land-based mitigation options (high confidence). The 
potential for some land management options decreases as climate 
change increases; for example, climate alters the sink capacity for 
soil and vegetation carbon sequestration, reducing the potential 
for increased soil organic carbon (high confidence). Other options 
(e.g., reduced deforestation and forest degradation) prevent further 
detrimental effects to the land surface; delaying these options could 
lead to increased deforestation, conversion, or degradation, serving 
as increased sources of GHGs and having concomitant negative 
impacts on NCPs (medium confidence). Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) 
options – such as reforestation, afforestation, bioenergy and BECCS – 
are used to compensate for unavoidable emissions in other sectors; 
delayed action will result in larger and more rapid deployment later 
(high confidence). Some response options will not be possible if 
action is delayed too long; for example, peatland restoration might 
not be possible after certain thresholds of degradation have been 
exceeded, meaning that peatlands could not be restored in certain 
locations (medium confidence). {6.2, 6.3, 6.4}
Early action, however, has challenges including technological 
readiness, upscaling, and institutional barriers (high confidence). 
Some of the response options have technological barriers that may 
limit their wide-scale application in the near term (high confidence). 
Some response options, for example, BECCS, have only been 
implemented at small-scale demonstration facilities; challenges 
exist with upscaling these options to the levels discussed in this 
Chapter (medium confidence). Economic and institutional barriers, 
including governance, financial incentives and financial resources,

limit the near-term adoption of many response options, and ‘policy 
lags’, by which implementation is delayed by the slowness of the 
policy implementation cycle, are significant across many options 
(medium confidence). Even some actions that initially seemed like 
‘easy wins’ have been challenging to implement, with stalled policies 
for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation 
and fostering conservation (REDD+) providing clear examples of 
how response options need sufficient funding, institutional support, 
local buy-in, and clear metrics for success, among other necessary 
enabling conditions. {6.2, 6.4}
Some response options reduce the consequences of land 
challenges, but do not address underlying drivers (high 
confidence). For example, management of urban sprawl can help 
reduce the environmental impact of urban systems; however, such 
management does not address the socio-economic and demographic 
changes driving the expansion of urban areas. By failing to address 
the underlying drivers, there is a potential for the challenge to 
re-emerge in the future (high confidence). {6.4}
Many response options have been practised in many regions 
for many years; however, there is limited knowledge of the 
efficacy and broader implications of other response options 
(high confidence). For the response options with a large evidence 
base and ample experience, further implementation and upscaling 
would carry little risk of adverse side effects (high confidence). 
However, for other options, the risks are larger as the knowledge 
gaps are greater; for example, uncertainty in the economic and 
social aspects of many land response options hampers the ability 
to predict their effects (medium confidence). Furthermore, Integrated 
Assessment Models, like those used to develop the pathways in the 
IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR15), omit many 
of these response options and do not assess implications for all land 
challenges (high confidence). {6.4}

Introduction
6.1.1 
Context of this chapter 
This chapter focuses on the interlinkages between response 
options1 to deliver climate mitigation and adaptation, to address 
desertification and land degradation, and to enhance food security. 
It also assesses reported impacts on Nature’s Contributions to People 
(NCP) and contributions to the UN Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs). By identifying which options provide the most co-benefits 
with the fewest adverse side effects, this chapter aims to provide 
integrated response options that could co-deliver across the range 
of challenges. This chapter does not consider response options 
that affect only one aspect of climate mitigation, adaptation, 
desertification, land degradation, or food security in isolation, since 
these are the subjects of Chapters 2–5; this chapter considers only 
interlinkages between response options, and two or more of these 
challenges in the land sector.
Since the aim is to assess and provide guidance on integrated response 
options, each response option is first described and categorised, 
drawing on previous chapters 2–5 (Section 6.2), and their impact 
on climate mitigation/adaptation, desertification, land degradation, 
and food security is quantified (Section 6.3). The feasibility of each 
response option, respect to costs, barriers, saturation and reversibility 
is then assessed (Section 6.4.1), before considering their sensitivity to 
future climate change (Section 6.4.2).
The co-benefits and adverse side effects2 of each integrated response 
option across the five land challenges, and their impacts on the NCP 
and the SDGs, are then assessed in Section 6.4.3. In section 6.4.4, the 
spatial applicability of these integrated response options is assessed 
in relation to the location of the challenges, with the aim of identifying 
which options have the greatest potential to co-deliver across the 
challenges, and the contexts and circumstances in which they do 
so. Interlinkages among response options and challenges in future 
scenarios are also assessed in Section 6.4.4. Finally, Section 6.4.5 
discusses the potential consequences of delayed action.
In providing this evidence-based assessment, drawing on the relevant 
literature, this chapter does not assess the merits of policies to deliver 
these integrated response options – Chapter 7 assesses the various 
policy options currently available to deliver these interventions. 
Rather, this chapter provides an assessment of the integrated 
response options and their ability to co-deliver across the multiple 
challenges addressed in this Special Report.

Many of the response options considered are sustainable land management options, but several response options are not based on land management – for example, those 
based on value chain management and governance and risk management options.

We use the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report Working Group III definitions of co-benefits and adverse side effect – see Glossary. Co-benefits and adverse side effects can be 
biophysical and/or socio-economic in nature, and all are assessed as far as the literature allows.

6.1.2 
Framing social challenges and acknowledging 
enabling factors
In this section we outline the approach used in assessing the 
evidence for interactions between response options to deliver 
climate mitigation and adaptation, to prevent desertification and 
land degradation, and to enhance food security. Overall, while 
defining and presenting the response options to meet these goals 
is the primary goal of this chapter, we note that these options must 
not be considered only as technological interventions, or one-off 
actions. Rather, they need to be understood as responses to socio-
ecological challenges whose success will largely depend on external 
enabling factors. There have been many previous efforts at compiling 
positive response options that meet numerous SDGs, but which 
have not resulted in major shifts in implementation; for example, 
online databases of multiple response options for sustainable land 
management (SLM), adaptation, and other objectives have been 
compiled by many donor agencies, including World Overview of 
Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT), Climate Adapt, 
and the Adaptation Knowledge Portal (Schwilch et al. 2012b).3 Yet, 
clearly barriers to adoption remain, or these actions would have 
been more widely used by now. Much of the scientific literature on 
barriers to implementing response options focuses on the individual 
and household level, and discusses limits to adoption, often primarily 
identified as economic factors (Nigussie et  al. 2017; Dallimer 
et al. 2018). While a useful approach, such studies are often unable 
to account for the larger enabling factors that might assist in more 
wide-scale implementation (Chapter 7 discusses these governance 
factors and associated barriers in more detail).
Instead, this chapter proposes that each response option identified 
and assessed needs to be understood as an intervention within 
complex socio-ecological systems (SES) (introduced in Chapter 1). In 
this understanding, physical changes affect human decision-making 
over land and risk management options, as do economics, policies, and 
cultural factors, which in turn may drive additional ecological change 
(Rawlins and Morris 2010). This co-evolution of responses within an 
SES provides a more nuanced understanding of the dynamics between 
drivers of change and impacts of interventions. Thus, in discussions 
of the 40 specific response options in this chapter, it must be kept in 
mind that all need to be contextualised within the specific SES in which 
they are deployed (Figure 6.1). Framing response options within SESs 
also recognises the interactions between different response options. 
However, a major problem within SESs is that the choice and use 
of different response options requires knowledge of the problems 
they are aimed at solving, which may be unclear, contested, or not 
shared equally among stakeholders (Carmenta et al. 2017). Drivers of 
environmental change often have primarily social or economic, rather 
than technological roots, which requires acknowledgement that the 
response options not aimed at reducing the drivers of change may thus 
be less successful (Schwilch et al. 2014).

Response options must also account for the uneven distribution of 
impacts among populations of both environmental change and 
intervention responses to this change. Understanding the integrated 
response options available in a given context requires an understanding 
of the specificities of social vulnerability, adaptive capacity, and 
institutional support to assist communities, households and regions to 
reach their capabilities and achievement of the SDG and other social 
and land management goals. Vulnerability reflects how assets are 
distributed within and among communities, shaped by factors that 
are not easily overcome with technical solutions, including inequality 
and marginalisation, poverty, and access to resources (Adger et al. 
2004; Hallegate et al. 2016). Understanding why some people are 
vulnerable, and what structural factors perpetuate this vulnerability 
requires attention to both micro and meso scales (Tschakert et al. 
2013). These vulnerabilities create barriers to adoption of even low-
cost high-return response options, such as soil carbon management, 
that may seem obviously beneficial to implement (Mutoko et  al. 
2014; Cavanagh et al. 2017). Thus, assessment of the differentiated 
vulnerabilities that may prevent the adoption of a response option 
need to be considered as part of any package of interventions. 
Adaptive capacity relates to the ability of institutions or people to 
modify or change characteristics or behaviour so as to cope better 
with existing or anticipated external stresses (Moss et  al. 2001; 
Brenkert and Malone 2005; Brooks et al. 2005). Adaptive capacity 
reflects institutional and policy support networks, and has often been 
associated at the national level with strong developments in the fields 
of economics, education, health, and governance and political rights 
(Smit et al. 2001). Areas with low adaptive capacity, as reflected in 
low Human Development Index scores, might constrain the ability 
of communities to implement response options (Section  6.4.4.1 
and Figure 6.7).
Further, while environmental changes like land degradation have 
obvious social and cultural impacts, (as discussed in the preceding 
chapters), so do response options. Therefore, careful thought is 
needed about what impacts are expected and what trade-offs are 
acceptable. One potential way to assess the impact of response 
interventions relates to the idea of capabilities, a concept first 
proposed by economist Amartya Sen (Sen 1992). Understanding 
capability as the ‘freedom to achieve well-being’ frames a problem 
as being a matter of facilitating what people aspire to do and be, 
rather than telling them to achieve a standardised or predetermined 
outcome (Nussbaum and Sen 1993). Thus a capability approach is 
generally a more flexible and multi-purpose framework, appropriate 
to an SES understanding because of its open-ended approach 
(Bockstael and Berkes 2017). Thus, one question for any decision-
maker approaching schematics of response options is to determine

which response options lead to increased or decreased capabilities for 
the stakeholders who are the objects of the interventions, given the 
context of the SES in which the response option will be implemented.
Section 6.4.3 examines some of the capabilities that are reflected 
in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), such as gender 
equality and education, and assesses how each of the 40 response 
options may affect those goals, either positively or negatively, 
through a review of the available literature. 
6.1.2.1 
Enabling conditions
Response options are not implemented in a vacuum and rely on 
knowledge production and socio-economic and cultural strategies 
and approaches embedded within them to be successful. For 
example, it is well known that “Weak grassroots institutions 
characterised by low capacity, failure to exploit collective capital 
and poor knowledge sharing and access to information, are common 
barriers to sustainable land management and improved food 
security” (Oloo and Omondi 2017). Achieving broad goals such as 
reduced poverty or sustainable land management requires conducive 
enabling conditions, such as attention to gender issues and the 
involvement of stakeholders, such as indigenous peoples and local 
communities, as well as attention to governance, including adaptive 
governance, stakeholder engagement, and institutional facilitation 
(Section 6.4.4.3). These enabling conditions  – such as gender-
sensitive programming or community-based solutions  – are not 
categorised as individual response options in subsequent sections 
of this chapter because they are conditions that can potentially 
help improve all response options when used in tandem to produce 
more sustainable outcomes. Chapter 7 picks up on these themes and 
discusses the ways various policies to implement response options 
have tried to minimise unwanted social and economic impacts on 
participants in more depth, through deeper analysis of concepts 
such as citizen science and adaptive governance. Here we simply 
note the importance of assessing the contexts in which response 
options will be delivered, as no two situations are the same, and no 
single response option is likely to be a ‘silver bullet’ to solve all land–
climate problems; each option comes with potential challenges and 
trade-offs (Section 6.2), barriers to implementation (Section 6.4.1), 
interactions with other sectors of society (Section 6.4.3), and 
potential environmental limitations (Section 6.4.4).
6.1.3 
Challenges and response options in current and 
historical interventions
Land-based systems are exposed to multiple overlapping challenges, 
including climate change (adaptation and mitigation), desertification 
(Chapter 3), land degradation (Chapter 4) and food insecurity 
(Chapter 5), as well as loss of biodiversity, groundwater stress (from 
over-abstraction) and water quality. The spatial distribution of these 
individual land-based challenges is shown in Figure 6.2, based on 
recent studies and using the following indicators:
• Desertification attributed to land use is estimated from vegetation 
remote sensing (Figure 3.7c), mean annual change in NDVImax 
<–0.001 (between 1982 and 2015) in dryland areas (Aridity 
Index >0.65), noting, however, that desertification has multiple 
causes (Chapter 3). 
• Land degradation (Chapter 4) is based on a soil erosion (Borrelli 
et al. 2017) proxy (annual erosion rate of 3 t ha–1 or above).
• The climate change challenge for adaptation is based on a dissimilarity 
index of monthly means of temperature and precipitation between 
current and end-of-century scenarios (dissimilarity index equal to 
0.7 or above; Netzel and Stepinski 2018), noting, however, that rapid 
warming could occur in all land regions (Chapter 2).
• The food security challenge is estimated as the prevalence of 
chronic undernourishment (higher or equal to 5%) by country 
in 2015 (FAO 2017a), noting, however, that food security has 
several dimensions (Chapter 5).
• The biodiversity challenge uses threatened terrestrial biodiversity 
hotspots (areas where exceptional concentrations of endemic 
species are undergoing exceptional loss of habitat, (Mittermeier 
et  al. 2011), noting, however, that biodiversity concerns more 
than just threatened endemic species.
• The groundwater stress challenge is estimated as groundwater 
abstraction over recharge ratios above one (Gassert et al. 2014) 
in agricultural areas (croplands and villages).
• The water quality challenge is estimated as critical loads (higher 
or equal to 1000 kg N km–2 or 50 kg P km–2) of nitrogen (N) and 
phosphorus (P) (Xie and Ringler 2017).
Overlapping land-based challenges affect all land-use categories: 
croplands, rangelands, semi-natural forests, villages, dense 
settlements, wild forests and sparse trees and barren lands. These 
land-use categories can be defined as anthropogenic biomes, or 
anthromes, and their global distribution was mapped by Ellis and 
Ramankutty (2008) (Figure 6.2).
The majority of the global population is concentrated in dense 
settlements and villages, accounting for less than 7% of the global 
ice-free land area, while croplands and rangelands use 39% of land. 
The remainder of the ice-free land area (more than half) is used by 
semi-natural forests, by wild forests, sparse trees and barren lands 
(Table 6.1).
Land-use types (or anthromes) are exposed to multiple overlapping 
challenges. Climate change could induce rapid warming in all land 
areas (Chapter 2). In close to 70% of the ice-free land area, the 
climate change adaptation challenge could be reinforced by a strong 
dissimilarity between end-of-century and current temperature and 
precipitation seasonal cycles (Netzel and Stepinski 2018). Chronic 
undernourishment (a component of food insecurity) is concentrated 
in 20% of global ice-free land area. Severe soil erosion (a proxy 
of land degradation) and desertification from land use affect 13% 
and 3% of ice-free land area, respectively. Both groundwater stress 
and severe water-quality decline (12% and 10% of ice-free land 
area, respectively) contribute to the water challenge. Threatened 
biodiversity hot-spots (15% of ice-free land area) are significant for 
the biodiversity challenge (Table 6.1).

Since land-based challenges overlap, part of the ice-free land area 
is exposed to combinations of two or more challenges. For instance, 
land degradation (severe soil erosion) or desertification from land 
use and food insecurity (chronic undernourishment) are combined 
with a strong climate change adaptation challenge (dissimilarity in 
seasonal cycles) in 4.5% of the ice-free land area (Figure 6.3).
The global distribution of land area by the number of overlapping land 
challenges (Figure 6.4) shows: the least exposure to land challenges 
in barren lands; less frequent exposure to two or more challenges 
in wild forests than in semi-natural forests; more frequent exposure 
to two or more challenges in agricultural anthromes (croplands and 
rangelands) and dense settlements than in forests; most frequent 
exposure to three or more challenges in villages compared to other 
land-use types. Therefore, land-use types intensively used by humans 
are, on average, exposed to a larger number of challenges than land-
use types (or anthromes) least exposed to human use.
Case studies located in different world regions are presented for each 
anthrome, in order to provide historical context on the interlinkages 
between multiple challenges and responses (Box 6.1). Taken together, 
these case studies illustrate the large contrast across anthromes 
in land-based interventions, and show the way these interventions 
respond to combinations of challenges.

A. Croplands. Land degradation, groundwater stress and food insecurity: Soil and water 
conservation measures in the Tigray region of Ethiopia
In northern Ethiopia, the Tigray Region is a drought-prone area that has been subjected to severe land degradation (Frankl 
et al. 2013) and to recurrent drought and famine during 1888–1892, 1973–1974 and 1984–1985 (Gebremeskel et al. 2018). 
The prevalence of stunting and being underweight among children under five years is high (Busse et al. 2017) and the region 
was again exposed to a severe drought during the strong El Niño event of 2015–2016. Croplands are the dominant land-use 
type, with approximately 90% of the households relying on small-scale plough-based cultivation. Gullies affect nearly all slopes 
and frequently exceed 2 m in depth and 5 m in top width. Landsat imagery shows that cropland area peaked in 1984–1986, and 
increased erosion rates in the 1980s and 1990s caused the drainage density and volume to peak in 1994 (Frankl et al. 2013). Since 
around 2000, the large-scale implementation of soil and water conservation (SWC) measures, integrated catchment management,

conservation agriculture and indigenous tree regeneration has started to yield positive effects on the vegetation cover and led to the 
stabilisation of about 25% of the gullies by 2010 (Frankl et al. 2013). Since 1991, farmers have provided labour for SWC in January 
as a free service for 20 consecutive working days, followed by food for work for the remaining days of the dry season. Most of the 
degraded landscapes have been restored, with positive impacts over the last two decades on soil fertility, water availability and 
crop productivity. However, misuse of fertilisers, low survival of tree seedlings and lack of income from exclosures may affect the 
sustainability of these land restoration measures (Gebremeskel et al. 2018).
B. Rangelands. Biodiversity hotspot, land degradation and climate change: 
Pasture intensification in the Cerrados of Brazil
Cerrados are a tropical savannah ecoregion in Brazil corresponding to a biodiversity hot spot with less than 2% of its region protected 
in national parks and conservation areas (Cava et al. 2018). Extensive cattle ranching (limited mechanisation, low use of fertiliser and 
seed inputs) has led to pasture expansion, including clearing forests to secure properties rights, occurring mainly over 1950–1975 
(Martha et al. 2012). Despite observed productivity gains made over the last three decades (Martha et al. 2012), more than half of the 
pasture area is degraded to some extent, and challenges remain to reverse grassland degradation while accommodating growing 
demand and simultaneously avoiding the conversion of natural habitats (de Oliveira Silva et al. 2018). The largest share of production 
is on unfertilised pastures, often sown with perennial forage grasses of African origin, mainly Brachiaria spp. (Cardoso et al. 2016). 
This initial intensification era was partly at the expense of significant uncontrolled deforestation, and average animal stocking 
rates remained well below the potential carrying capacity (Strassburg et al. 2014). Changes in land use are difficult to reverse since 
pasture abandonment does not lead to the spontaneous restoration of old-growth savannah (Cava et al. 2018); moreover, pasture 
to crop conversion is frequent, supporting close to half of cropland expansion in Mato Grosso state over 2000–2013 (Cohn et al. 
2016). Pasture intensification through liming, fertilisation and controlled grazing could increase soil organic carbon and reduce net 
GHG emission intensity per unit meat product, but only at increased investment cost per unit of area (de Oliveira Silva et al. 2017). 
Scenarios projecting a decoupling between deforestation and increased pasture intensification, provide the basis for a Nationally 
Determined Contribution (NDC) of Brazil that is potentially consistent with accommodating an upward trend in livestock production 
to meet increasing demand (de Oliveira Silva et al. 2018). Deforestation in Brazil has declined significantly between 2004 and 2014 
in the national inventory, but recent data and analyses suggest that the decrease in deforestation and the resulting GHG emissions 
reductions have slowed down or even stopped (UNEP 2017).
C. Semi-natural forests. Biodiversity hotspot, land degradation, climate change  
and food insecurity: Restoration and resilience of tropical forests in Indonesia
During the last two decades, forest cover in Indonesia declined by 150,000 km2 in the period 1990–2000 (Stibig et  al. 2014) 
and approximately 158,000 km2 in the period 2000–2012 (Hansen et al. 2013), most of which was converted to agricultural lands (e.g., oil 
palm, pulpwood plantations). According to recent estimates, deforestation in Indonesia mainly concerns primary forests, including intact 
and degraded forests, thus leading to biodiversity loss and reduced carbon sequestration potentials (e.g., Margono et al. 2014). For 
example, Graham et al. (2017) estimated that the following strategies to reduce deforestation and forest degradation may cost-effectively 
increase carbon sequestration and reduce carbon emissions in 30 years: reforestation (3.54 GtCO2), limiting the expansion of oil palm 
and timber plantations into forest (3.07 GtCO2 and 3.05 GtCO2, respectively), reducing illegal logging (2.34 GtCO2), and halting illegal 
forest loss in protected areas (1.52 GtCO2) at a total cost of 15.7 USD tC–1. The importance of forest mitigation in Indonesia is indicated 
by the NDC, where between half and two-thirds of the 2030 emission target relative to a business-as-usual scenario is from reducing 
deforestation, forest degradation, peatland drainage and fires (Grassi et al. 2017). Avoiding deforestation and reforestation could have 
multiple co-benefits by improving biodiversity conservation and employment opportunities, while reducing illegal logging in protected 
areas. However, these options could also have adverse side effects if they deprive local communities of access to natural resources 
(Graham et al. 2017). The adoption of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil certification in oil palm plantations reduced deforestation 
rates by approximately 33% in the period 2001–2015 (co-benefits with mitigation), and fire rates much more than for non-certified 
plantations (Carlson et al. 2018). However, given that large-scale oil palm plantations are one of the largest drivers of deforestation 
in Indonesia, objective information on the baseline trajectory for land clearance for oil palm is needed to further assess commitments, 
regulations and transparency in plantation development (Gaveau et al. 2016). For adaptation options, the community forestry scheme 
Hutan Desa (Village Forest) in Sumatra and Kalimantan helped to avoid deforestation (co-benefits with mitigation) by between 0.6 and 
0.9 ha km–2 in Sumatra and 0.6 and 0.8 ha km–2 in Kalimantan in the period 2012–2016; Santika et al. 2017), improve local livelihood 
options, and restore degraded ecosystems (positive side effects for NCP provision) (e.g., Pohnan et al. 2015). Finally, the establishment 
of Ecosystem Restoration Concessions in Indonesia (covering more than 5,500 km2 of forests now, and 16,000 km2 allocated for the 
future) facilitates the planting of commercial timber species (co-benefits with mitigation), while assisting natural regeneration, preserving 
important habitats and species, and improving local well-being and incomes (positive side effects for Nature’s Contributions to People 
provision), at relatively lower costs compared with timber concessions (Silalahi et al. 2017).

D. Villages. Land degradation, groundwater overuse, climate change  
and food insecurity: Climate smart villages in India
Indian agriculture, which includes both monsoon-dependent rainfed (58%) and irrigated agriculture, is exposed to climate variability 
and change. Over the past years, the frequency of droughts, cyclones, and hailstorms has increased, with severe droughts in eight 
of 15 years between 2002 and 2017 (Srinivasa Rao et al. 2016; Mujumdar et al. 2017). Such droughts result in large yield declines 
for major crops like wheat in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (Zhang et al. 2017). The development of a submersible pump technology in 
the 1990s, combined with public policies that provide farmers with free electricity for groundwater irrigation, resulted in a dramatic 
increase in irrigated agriculture (Shah et al. 2012). This shift has led to increased dependence on irrigation from groundwater and 
induced a groundwater crisis, with large impacts on socio-ecosystems. An increasing number of farmers report bore-well failures, 
either due to excessive pumping of an existing well or a lack of water in new wells. The decrease in the groundwater table level has 
suppressed the recharge of river beds, turning permanent rivers into ephemeral streams (Srinivasan et al. 2015). Wells have recently 
been drilled in upland areas, where groundwater irrigation is also increasing (Robert et al. 2017). Additional challenges include 
declining soil organic matter and fertility under monocultures and rice/wheat systems. Unoccupied land is scarce, meaning that the 
potential for expanding the area farmed is very limited (Aggarwal et al. 2018). In rural areas, diets are deficient in protein, dietary fibre 
and iron, and mainly comprised of cereals and pulses grown and/or procured through welfare programmes (Vatsala et al. 2017). 
Cultivators are often indebted, and suicide rates are much higher than the national average, especially for those strongly indebted 
(Merriott 2016). Widespread use of diesel pumps for irrigation, especially for paddies, high use of inorganic fertilisers and crop 
residue burning lead to high GHG emissions (Aggarwal et al. 2018). The Climate-Smart Village (CSV) approach aims at increasing farm 
yield, income, input use efficiency (water, nutrients, and energy) and reducing GHG emissions (Aggarwal et al. 2018). Climate-smart 
agriculture interventions are considered in a broad sense by including practices, technologies, climate information services, insurance, 
institutions, policies, and finance. Options differ based on the CSV site, its agro-ecological characteristics, level of development, and the 
capacity and interest of farmers and the local government (Aggarwal et al. 2018). Selected interventions included crop diversification, 
conservation agriculture (minimum tillage, residue retention, laser levelling), improved varieties, weather-based insurance, agro-
advisory services, precision agriculture and agroforestry. Farmers’ cooperatives were established to hire farm machinery, secure 
government credit for inputs, and share experiences and knowledge. Tillage practices and residue incorporation increased rice–wheat 
yields by 5–37%, increased income by 28–40%, reduced GHG emissions by 16–25%, and increased water-use efficiency by 30% (Jat 
et al. 2015). The resulting portfolio of options proposed by the CSV approach has been integrated with the agricultural development 
strategy of some states like Haryana.
E. Dense settlements. Climate change and food: Green infrastructures
Extreme heat events have led to particularly high rates of mortality and morbidity in cities, as urban populations are pushed 
beyond their adaptive capacities, leading to an increase in mortality rates of 30–130% in major cities in developed countries 
(Norton et al. 2015). Increased mortality and morbidity from extreme heat events are exacerbated in urban populations by the urban 
heat island effect (Gabriel and Endlicher 2011; Schatz and Kucharik 2015), which can be limited by developing green infrastructure in 
cities. Urban green infrastructure includes public and private green spaces – such as remnant native vegetation, parks, private gardens, 
golf courses, street trees, urban farming – and more engineered options, such as green roofs, green walls, biofilters and raingardens 
(Norton et al. 2015). Increasing the amount of vegetation, or green infrastructure, in a city is one way to help reduce urban air 
temperature maxima and variation. Increasing vegetation by 10% in Melbourne, Australia was estimated to reduce daytime urban 
surface temperatures by approximately 1°C during extreme heat events (Coutts and Harris 2013). Urban farming (a type of urban 
green infrastructure) is largely driven by the desire to reconnect food production and consumption (Whittinghill and Rowe 2012) 
(Chapter 5). Even though urban farming can only meet a very small share of the overall urban food demand, it provides fresh and 
local food, especially perishable fruits and crops that are usually shipped from far and sold at high prices (Thomaier et al. 2015). 
Food-producing urban gardens and farms are often started by grassroots initiatives (Ercilla-Montserrat et al. 2019) that occupy vacant 
urban spaces. In recent years, a growing number of urban farming projects (termed Zero-Acreage farming, or Z-farming, Thomaier 
et al. 2015) were established in and on existing buildings, using rooftop spaces or abandoned buildings through contracts between 
food businesses and building owners. Almost all Z-farms are located in cities with more than 150,000 inhabitants, with a majority in 
North American cities such as New York City, Chicago and Toronto (Thomaier et al. 2015). They depend on the availability of vacant 
buildings and roof tops, thereby competing with other uses, such as roof-based solar systems. Urban farming, however, has potentially 
high levels of soil pollution and air pollutants, which may lead to crop contamination and health risks. These adverse effects could be 
reduced on rooftops (Harada et al. 2019) or in controlled environments.

6.1.4 
Challenges represented in future scenarios
In this section, the evolution of several challenges (climate change, 
mitigation, adaptation, desertification, land degradation, food 
insecurity, biodiversity and water) in the future are assessed, 
focusing on global analyses. The effect of response options on these 
land challenges in the future is discussed in Section 6.4.4. Where 
possible, studies quantifying these challenges in the Shared Socio-
economic Pathways (SSPs) (O’Neill et al. 2014) (Chapter 1, Cross-
Chapter Box 1, and Cross-Chapter Box 9 in this chapter), should 
be used to assess which future scenarios could experience multiple 
challenges in the future.
Climate change: Without any additional efforts to mitigate, 
global mean temperature rise is expected to increase by anywhere 
from 2°C to 7.8°C in 2100 relative to the 1850–1900 reference 
period (Clarke et al. 2014; Chapter 2). The level of warming varies, 
depending on the climate model (Collins et al. 2013), uncertainties 
in the Earth system (Clarke et  al. 2014), and socio-economic/
technological assumptions (Clarke et  al. 2014; Riahi et  al. 2017). 
Warming over land is 1.2 to 1.4 times higher than global mean 
temperature rise; warming in the Arctic region is 2.4 to 2.6 times 
higher than warming in the tropics (Collins et al. 2013). Increases 
in global mean temperature are accompanied by increases in global 
precipitation; however, the effect varies across regions, with some 
regions projected to see increases in precipitation and others to 
see decreases (Collins et al. 2013) (Chapter 2). Additionally, climate 
change also has implications for extreme events (e.g., drought, 
heat waves, etc.), freshwater availability, and other aspects of the 
terrestrial system (Chapter 2).
Mitigation: Challenges to mitigation depend on the underlying 
emissions and ‘mitigative capacity’, including technology availability, 
policy institutions, and financial resources (O’Neill et  al. 2014). 
Challenges to mitigation are high in SSP3 and SSP5, medium in SSP2, 
and low in SSP1 and SSP4 (O’Neill et al. 2014, 2017; Riahi et al. 2017). 
Adaptation: Challenges to adaptation depend on climate risk and 
adaptive capacity, including technology availability, effectiveness of 
institutions, and financial resources (O’Neill et al. 2014). Challenges 
to adaptation are high in SSP3 and SSP4, medium in SSP2, and low in 
SSP1 and SSP5 (O’Neill et al. 2014, 2017; Riahi et al. 2017). 
Desertification: The combination of climate and land-use changes 
can lead to decreases in soil cover in drylands (Chapter 3). Population 
living in drylands is expected to increase by 43% in the SSP2-Baseline, 
due to both population increases and an expansion of dryland area 
(UNCCD 2017).
Land degradation: Future changes in land use and climate have 
implications for land degradation, including impacts on soil erosion, 
vegetation, fire, and coastal erosion (Chapter 4; IPBES 2018). For 
example, soil organic carbon is expected to decline by 99 GtCO2e in 
2050 in an SSP2-Baseline scenario, due to both land management 
and expansion in agricultural area (Ten Brink et al. 2018). 
Food insecurity: Food insecurity in future scenarios varies 
significantly, depending on socio-economic development and study. 
For example, the population at risk of hunger ranges from 0  to 
800  million in 2050 (Hasegawa et  al. 2015a; Ringler et  al. 2016; 
Fujimori et  al. 2018; Hasegawa et  al. 2018; Fujimori et  al. 2019; 
Baldos and Hertel 2015) and 0–600 million in 2100 (Hasegawa et al. 
2015a). Food prices in 2100 in non-mitigation scenarios range from 
0.9 to about two times their 2005 values (Hasegawa et al. 2015a; 
Calvin et  al. 2014; Popp et  al. 2017). Food insecurity depends on 
both income and food prices (Fujimori et al. 2018). Higher income 
(e.g.,  SSP1, SSP5), higher yields (e.g., SSP1, SSP5), and less meat 
intensive diets (e.g., SSP1) tend to result in reduced food insecurity 
(Hasegawa et al. 2018; Fujimori et al. 2018).
Biodiversity: Future species extinction rates vary from modest 
declines to 100-fold increases from 20th century rates, depending 
on the species (e.g., plants, vertebrates, invertebrates, birds, fish, 
corals), the degree of land-use change, the level of climate change, 
and assumptions about migration (Pereira et  al. 2010). Mean 
species abundance (MSA) is also estimated to decline in the future 
by 10–20% in 2050 (Van Vuuren et al. 2015; Pereira et al. 2010). 
Scenarios with greater cropland expansion lead to larger declines in 
MSA (UNCCD 2017) and species richness (Newbold et al. 2015).
Water stress: Changes in water supply (due to climate change) 
and water demand (due to socio-economic development) in the 
future have implications for water stress. Water withdrawals for 
irrigation increase from about 2500 km3 yr–1 in 2005 to between 
2900 and 9000 km3 yr–1 at the end of the century (Chaturvedi et al. 
2013; Wada and Bierkens 2014; Hejazi et al. 2014a; Kim et al. 2016; 
Graham et al. 2018; Bonsch et al. 2015); total water withdrawals 
at the end of the century range from 5000 to 13,000 km3 yr–1 
(Wada  and Bierkens 2014; Hejazi et  al. 2014a; Kim et  al. 2016; 
Graham et al. 2018). The magnitude of change in both irrigation 
and total water withdrawals depend on population, income, and 
technology (Hejazi et al. 2014a; Graham et al. 2018). The combined 
effect of changes in water supply and water demand will lead to an 
increase of between 1 billion and 6 billion people living in water-
stressed areas (Schlosser et al. 2014; Hanasaki et al. 2013; Hejazi 
et al. 2014b). Changes in water quality are not assessed here but 
could be important (Liu et al. 2017).

SSP
Summary of challenges
SSP1 
SSP1 (Van Vuuren et al. 2017b) has low challenges to mitigation and adaptation. The resulting Baseline scenario includes:
 – continued, but moderate, climate change: global mean temperature increases by 3 to 3.5°C in 2100 (Huppmann et al. 2018; Riahi et al. 2017) 
 – low levels of food insecurity: malnourishment is eliminated by 2050 (Hasegawa et al. 2015a) 
 – declines in biodiversity: biodiversity loss increases from 34% in 2010 to 38% in 2100 (UNCCD 2017)
 – high water stress: global water withdrawals decline slightly from the baseline in 2071–2100, but about 2.6 billion people live in water stressed areas (Hanasaki et al. 2013).
Additionally, this scenario is likely to have lower challenges related to desertification, land degradation, and biodiversity loss than SSP2 as it has lower population, lower 
land-use change and lower climate change (Riahi et al. 2017).
SSP2
SSP2 (Fricko et al. 2017) is a scenario with medium challenges to mitigation and medium challenges to adaptation. The resulting Baseline scenario includes:
 – continued climate change: global mean temperature increases by 3.8°C to 4.3°C in 2100 (Fricko et al. 2017; Huppmann et al. 2018; Riahi et al. 2017) 
 – increased challenges related to desertification: the population living in drylands is expected to increase by 43% in 2050 (UNCCD 2017)
 – increased land degradation: soil organic carbon is expected to decline by 99 GtCO2e in 2050 (Ten Brink et al. 2018)
 – low levels of food insecurity: malnourishment is eliminated by 2100 (Hasegawa et al. 2015a)
 – declines in biodiversity: biodiversity loss increases from 34% in 2010 to 43% in 2100 (UNCCD 2017)
 – high water stress: global water withdrawals nearly doubles from the baseline in 2071–2100, with about 4 billion people living in water stressed areas (Hanasaki et al. 2013). 
SSP3
SSP3 (Fujimori et al. 2017) is a scenario with high challenges to mitigation and high challenges to adaptation. The resulting Baseline scenario includes:
 – continued climate change: global mean temperature increases by 4°C to 4.8°C in 2100 (Huppmann et al. 2018; Riahi et al. 2017) 
 – high levels of food insecurity: about 600 million malnourished in 2100 (Hasegawa et al. 2015a)
 – declines in biodiversity: biodiversity loss increases from 34% in 2010 to 46% in 2100 (UNCCD 2017)
 – high water stress: global water withdrawals more than double from the baseline in 2071–2100, with about 5.5 billion people living in water stressed areas (Hanasaki et al. 2013). 
Additionally, this scenario is likely to have higher challenges to desertification, land degradation, and biodiversity loss than SSP2 as it has higher population, higher land-use 
change and higher climate change (Riahi et al. 2017).
SSP4
SSP4 (Calvin et al. 2017) has high challenges to adaptation but low challenges to mitigation. The resulting Baseline scenario includes:
 – continued climate change: global mean temperature increases by 3.4°C to 3.8°C in 2100 (Calvin et al. 2017; Huppmann et al. 2018; Riahi et al. 2017)
 – high levels of food insecurity: about 400 million malnourished in 2100 (Hasegawa et al. 2015a)
 – high water stress: about 3.5 billion people live in water stressed areas in 2100 (Hanasaki et al. 2013). 
Additionally, this scenario is likely to have similar effects on biodiversity loss as SSP2 as it has similar land-use change and similar climate change (Riahi et al. 2017).
SSP5
SSP5 (Kriegler et al. 2017) has high challenges to mitigation but low challenges to adaptation. The resulting Baseline scenario includes:
 – continued climate change: global mean temperature increases by 4.6°C to 5.4°C in 2100 (Kriegler et al. 2017; Huppmann et al. 2018; Riahi et al. 2017) 
 – low levels of food insecurity: malnourishment is eliminated by 2050 (Hasegawa et al. 2015a)
 – increased water use and water scarcity: global water withdrawals increase by about 80% in 2071–2100, with nearly 50% of the population living in water stressed areas 
(Hanasaki et al. 2013).
Additionally, this scenario is likely to have higher effects on biodiversity loss as SSP2 as it has similar land-use change and higher climate change (Riahi et al. 2017).
6.2 
Response options, co-benefits 
and adverse side effects across 
the land challenges
This section describes the integrated response options available to 
address the land challenges of climate change mitigation, climate 
change adaptation, desertification, land degradation and food 
security. These can be categorised into options that rely on (i) land 
management, (ii) value chain management, and (iii) risk management 
(Figure 6.5). The land management integrated response options can 
be grouped according to those that are applied in agriculture, in 
forests, on soils, in other/all ecosystems and those that are applied 
specifically for carbon dioxide removal (CDR). The value chain 
management integrated response options can be categorised as 
those based demand management and supply management. The risk 
management options are grouped together (Figure 6.5).
Note that the integrated response options are not mutually exclusive – 
for example, cropland management might also increase soil organic 
matter stocks – and a number of the integrated response options are 
comprised of a number of practices – for example, improved cropland 
management is a collection of practices consisting of: 
1. management of the crop, including high-input carbon practices, 
for example, improved crop varieties, crop rotation, use of cover 
crops, perennial cropping systems, agricultural biotechnology
2. nutrient management: including optimised fertiliser application 
rate, fertiliser type [organic and mineral], timing, precision 
application, inhibitors
3. reduced tillage intensity and residue retention
4. improved water management: including drainage of waterlogged 
mineral soils and irrigation of crops in arid/semi-arid conditions
5. improved rice management, including water management such 
as mid-season drainage and improved fertilisation and residue 
management in paddy rice systems. 
In this section, we deal only with integrated response options, not 
the policies that are currently or could be implemented to enable 
their application; that is the subject of Chapter 7. Also note that 
enabling conditions such as indigenous and local knowledge, 
gender issues, governance and so on are not categorised as 
integrated response options (Section 6.1.2). Some suggested 
methods to address land challenges are better described as 
overarching frameworks than as integrated response options. For 
example, climate smart agriculture is a collection of integrated 
566

response options aimed at delivering mitigation and adaptation 
in agriculture, including improved cropland management, grazing 
land management and livestock management. Table 6.3 shows how 
a number of overarching frameworks are comprised of a range of 
integrated response options.
Similarly, policy goals, such as land degradation neutrality (discussed 
further in Chapter 7), are not considered as integrated response 
options. For this reason, land degradation neutrality, and overarching 
frameworks, such as those described in Table 6.3 do not appear 
as response options in the following sections, but the component 
integrated response options that contribute to these policy goals or 
overarching frameworks are addressed in detail.

Increased food 
productivity
Increased food productivity arises when the output of 
food commodities increases per unit of input, e.g., per 
unit of land or water. It can be realised through many 
other interventions such as improved cropland, grazing 
land and livestock management.
Many interventions to increase food production, particularly 
those predicated on very large inputs of agro-chemicals, 
have a wide range of negative externalities leading to the 
proposal of sustainable intensification as a mechanism to 
deliver future increases in productivity that avoid these 
adverse outcomes. Intensification through additional input 
of nitrogen fertiliser, for example, would result in negative 
impacts on climate, soil, water and air pollution. Similarly, 
if implemented in a way that over-exploits the land, signifi-
cant negative impacts would occur, but if achieved through 
sustainable intensification, and used to spare land, it could 
reduce the pressure on land.

Improved cropland 
management
Improved cropland management is a collection of 
practices consisting of a) management of the crop: 
including high input carbon practices, for example, 
improved crop varieties, crop rotation, use of cover 
crops, perennial cropping systems, integrated production 
systems, crop diversification, agricultural biotechnology, 
b) nutrient management: including optimised fertiliser 
application rate, fertiliser type (organic manures, compost 
and mineral), timing, precision application, nitrification 
inhibitors, c) reduced tillage intensity and residue 
retention, d) improved water management: including 
drainage of waterlogged mineral soils and irrigation 
of crops in arid/semi-arid conditions, e) improved rice 
management: including water management such 
as mid-season drainage and improved fertilisation 
and residue management in paddy rice systems, 
and f) biochar application.
Improved cropland management can reduce GHG 
emissions and create soil carbon sinks, though if poorly 
implemented, it could increase nitrous oxide and methane 
emissions from nitrogen fertilisers, crop residues and 
organic amendments. It can improve resilience of food crop 
production systems to climate change, and can be used to 
tackle desertification and land degradation by improving 
sustainable land management. It can also contribute 
to food security by closing crop yield gaps to increase 
food productivity.

Improved grazing 
land management
Improved grazing land management is a collection 
of practices consisting of a) management of vegetation: 
including improved grass varieties/sward composition, 
deep rooting grasses, increased productivity, and nutrient 
management, b) animal management: including 
appropriate stocking densities fit to carrying capacity, 
fodder banks, and fodder diversification, and c) fire 
management: improved use of fire for sustainable 
grassland management, including fire prevention 
and improved prescribed burning (see also fire 
management as a separate response option)  
(Table 6.8).
Improved grazing land management can increase soil 
carbon sinks, reduce GHG emissions, improve the resilience 
of grazing lands to future climate change, help reduce 
desertification and land degradation by optimising stocking 
density and reducing overgrazing, and can enhance food 
security through improved productivity.

Improved livestock 
management
Improved livestock management is a collection of 
practices consisting of a) improved feed and dietary 
additives (e.g., bioactive compounds, fats), used to 
increase productivity and reduce emissions from 
enteric fermentation; b) breeding (e.g., breeds with 
higher productivity or reduced emissions from enteric 
fermentation), c) herd management, including decreasing 
neo-natal mortality, improving sanitary conditions, 
animal health and herd renewal, and diversifying animal 
species, d) emerging technologies (of which some are 
not legally authorised in several countries) such as 
propionate enhancers, nitrate and sulphate supplements, 
archaea inhibitors and archaeal vaccines, methanotrophs, 
acetogens, defaunation of the rumen, bacteriophages 
and probiotics, ionophores/antibiotics; and e) improved 
manure management, including manipulation of bedding 
and storage conditions, anaerobic digesters; biofilters, 
dietary change and additives, soil-applied and animal-fed 
nitrification inhibitors, urease inhibitors, fertiliser type, rate 
and timing, manipulation of manure application practices, 
and grazing management.
Improved livestock management can reduce GHG 
emissions, particularly from enteric methane and manure 
management. It can improve the resilience of livestock 
production systems to climate change by breeding better 
adapted livestock. It can help with desertification and 
land degradation, e.g., through use of more efficient 
and adapted breeds to allow reduced stocking densities. 
Improved livestock sector productivity can also increase 
food production.

Agroforestry
Agroforestry involves the deliberate planting of trees 
in croplands and silvo-pastoral systems. 
Agroforestry sequesters carbon in vegetation and soils. 
The use of leguminous trees can enhance biological 
nitrogen fixation and resilience to climate change. Soil 
improvement and the provision of perennial vegetation 
can help to address desertification and land degradation. 
Agroforestry can increase agricultural productivity, with 
benefits for food security. Additionally, agroforestry can 
enable payments to farmers for ecosystem services and 
reduce vulnerability to climate shocks.

Agricultural 
diversification
Agricultural diversification includes a set of agricultural 
practices and products obtained in the field that aim to 
improve the resilience of farmers to climate variability 
and climate change and to economic risks posed by 
fluctuating market forces. In general, the agricultural 
system is shifted from one based on low-value agricultural 
commodities to one that is more diverse, composed 
of a basket of higher value-added products.
Agricultural diversification is targeted at adaptation 
but could also deliver a small carbon sink, depending 
on how it is implemented. It could reduce pressure on 
land, benefitting desertification, land degradation, food 
security and household income. However, the potential 
to achieve household food security is influenced by the 
market orientation of a household, livestock ownership, 
non-agricultural employment opportunities, and available 
land resources.

Reduced grassland 
conversion to 
cropland
Grasslands can be converted to croplands by ploughing 
of grassland and seeding with crops. Since croplands 
have a lower soil carbon content than grasslands and 
are also more prone to erosion than grasslands, reducing 
conversion of grassland to croplands will prevent soil 
carbon losses by oxidation and soil loss through erosion. 
These processes can be reduced if the rate of grassland 
conversion to cropland is reduced.
Stabilising soils by retaining grass cover also improves 
resilience, benefitting adaptation, desertification and land 
degradation. Since conversion of grassland to cropland 
usually occurs to remedy food security challenges, food 
security could be adversely affected, since more land is 
required to produce human food from livestock products 
on grassland than from crops on cropland.

Integrated water 
management
Integrated water management is the process of 
creating holistic strategies to promote integrated, 
efficient, equitable and sustainable use of water for 
agroecosystems. It includes a collection of practices 
including water-use efficiency and irrigation in arid/semi-
arid areas, improvement of soil health through increases 
in soil organic matter content, and improved cropland 
management, agroforestry and conservation agriculture. 
Increasing water availability, and reliability of water for 
agricultural production, can be achieved by using different 
techniques of water harvesting, storage, and its judicious 
utilisation through farm ponds, dams, and community 
tanks in rainfed agriculture areas can benefit adaptation.
These practices can reduce aquifer and surface 
water depletion, and prevent over-extraction, and the 
management of climate risks. Many technical innovations, 
e.g., precision water management, can have benefits for 
both adaptation and mitigation, although trade-offs are 
possible. Maintaining the same level of yield through use 
of site-specific water management-based approach could 
have benefits for both food security and mitigation.

Forest 
management
Forest management refers to management interventions 
in forests for the purpose of climate change mitigation. 
It includes a wide variety of practices affecting the 
growth of trees and the biomass removed, including 
improved regeneration (natural or artificial) and a better 
schedule, intensity and execution of operations (thinning, 
selective logging, final cut, reduced impact logging, etc.). 
Sustainable forest management is the stewardship and 
use of forests and forest lands in a way, and at a rate, that 
maintains their biodiversity, productivity, regeneration 
capacity, vitality and their potential to fulfil, now and 
in the future, relevant ecological, economic and social 
functions, at local, national, and global levels, and that 
does not cause damage to other ecosystems. 
Sustainable forest management can enhance the carbon 
stock in biomass, dead organic matter, and soil – while 
providing wood-based products to reduce emissions in 
other sectors through material and energy substitution. 
A trade-off exists between different management 
strategies: higher harvest decreases the carbon in the 
forest biomass in the short term but increases the carbon 
in wood products and the potential for substitution effects. 
Sustainable forest management, also through close-
to-nature silvicultural techniques, can potentially offer 
many co-benefits in terms of climate change mitigation, 
adaptation, biodiversity conservation, microclimatic 
regulation, soil erosion protection, coastal area protection 
and water and flood regulation. Forest management 
strategies aimed at increasing the biomass stock levels 
may have adverse side effects, such as decreasing the 
stand-level structural complexity, biodiversity and resilience 
to natural disasters. Forest management also affects albedo 
and evapotranspiration.

Reduced 
deforestation and 
forest degradation
Reduced deforestation and forest degradation includes 
conservation of existing carbon pools in forest vegetation 
and soil by controlling the drivers of deforestation 
(i.e., commercial and subsistence agriculture, mining, urban 
expansion) and forest degradation (i.e., overharvesting 
including fuelwood collection, poor harvesting practices, 
overgrazing, pest outbreaks, and extreme wildfires), 
also through establishing protected areas, improving 
law enforcement, forest governance and land tenure, 
supporting community forest management and 
introducing forest certification.
Reducing deforestation and forest degradation is a major 
strategy to reduce global GHG emissions. The combination 
of reduced GHG emissions and biophysical effects results 
in a large climate mitigation effect, with benefits also at 
local level. Reduced deforestation preserves biodiversity 
and ecosystem services more efficiently and at lower 
costs than afforestation/reforestation. Efforts to reduce 
deforestation and forest degradation may have potential 
adverse side effects, for example, reducing availability of 
land for farming, restricting the rights and access of local 
people to forest resources (e.g., firewood), or increasing the 
dependence of local people to insecure external funding.

Reforestation and 
forest restoration
Reforestation is the conversion to forest of land that has 
previously contained forests but that has been converted 
to some other use. Forest restoration refers to practices 
aimed at regaining ecological integrity in a deforested 
or degraded forest landscape. As such, it could fall under 
reforestation if it were re-establishing trees where they 
have been lost, or under forest management if it were 
restoring forests where not all trees have been lost. 
For practical reasons, here forest restoration is treated 
together with reforestation.
Reforestation is similar to afforestation with respect 
to the co-benefits and adverse side effects among 
climate change mitigation, adaptation, desertification, 
land degradation and food security (see row on Afforestation 
below). Forest restoration can increase terrestrial carbon 
stocks in deforested or degraded forest landscapes and can 
offer many co-benefits in terms of increased resilience of 
forests to climate change, enhanced connectivity between 
forest areas and conservation of biodiversity hotspots. 
Forest restoration may threaten livelihoods and local 
access to land if subsistence agriculture is targeted.

Afforestation
Afforestation is the conversion to forest of land 
that historically have not contained forests 
(see also ‘reforestation’).
Afforestation increases terrestrial carbon stocks but 
can also change the physical properties of land surfaces, 
such as surface albedo and evapotranspiration with 
implications for local and global climate. In the tropics, 
enhanced evapotranspiration cools surface temperatures, 
reinforcing the climate benefits of CO2 sequestration 
in trees. At high latitudes and in areas affected by 
seasonal snow cover, the decrease in surface albedo after 
afforestation becomes dominant and causes an annual 
average warming that counteracts carbon benefits. Net 
biophysical effects on regional climate from afforestation 
is seasonal and can reduce the frequency of climate 
extremes, such as heat waves, improving adaptation to 
climate change and reducing the vulnerability of people 
and ecosystems. Afforestation helps to address land 
degradation and desertification, as forests tend to maintain 
water quality by reducing runoff, trapping sediments and 
nutrients, and improving groundwater recharge. However, 
food security could be hampered since an increase 
in global forest area can increase food prices through 
land competition. Other adverse side effects occur when 
afforestation is based on non-native species, especially with 
the risks related to the spread of exotic fast-growing tree 
species. For example, exotic species can upset the balance 
of evapotranspiration regimes, with negative impacts on 
water availability, particularly in dry regions.

Increased soil 
organic carbon 
content
Practices that increase soil organic matter content 
include a) land-use change to an ecosystem with higher 
equilibrium soil carbon levels (e.g., from cropland to 
forest), b) management of the vegetation: including high 
input carbon practices, for example, improved varieties, 
rotations and cover crops, perennial cropping systems, 
biotechnology to increase inputs and recalcitrance of 
below ground carbon, c) nutrient management and 
organic material input to increase carbon returns to the 
soil, including: optimised fertiliser and organic material 
application rate, type, timing and precision application, 
d) reduced tillage intensity and residue retention, and 
e) improved water management: including irrigation 
in arid/semi-arid conditions. 
Increasing soil carbon stocks removes CO2 from the 
atmosphere and increases the water-holding capacity of 
the soil, thereby conferring resilience to climate change 
and enhancing adaptation capacity. It is a key strategy for 
addressing both desertification and land degradation. There 
is some evidence that crop yields and yield stability increase 
by increased organic matter content, though some studies 
show equivocal impacts. Some practices to increase soil 
organic matter stocks vary in their efficacy. For example, 
the impact of no-till farming and conservation agriculture 
on soil carbon stocks is often positive, but can be neutral 
or even negative, depending on the amount of crop 
residues returned to the soil. If soil organic carbon stocks 
were increased by increasing fertiliser inputs to increase 
productivity, emissions of nitrous oxide from fertiliser use 
could offset any climate benefits arising from carbon sinks. 
Similarly, if any yield penalty is incurred from practices 
aimed at increasing soil organic carbon stocks (e.g., through 
extensification), emissions could be increased through 
indirect land-use change, and there could also be adverse 
side effects on food security.

Reduced soil 
erosion
Soil erosion is the removal of soil from the land surface 
by water, wind or tillage, which occurs worldwide but 
it is particularly severe in Asia, Latin America and the 
Caribbean, and the Near East and North Africa. Soil 
erosion management includes conservation practices 
(e.g., the use of minimum tillage or zero tillage, crop 
rotations and cover crops, rational grazing systems), 
engineering-like practices (e.g., construction of terraces 
and contour cropping for controlling water erosion), or 
forest barriers and strip cultivation for controlling wind 
erosion. In eroded soils, the advance of erosion gullies 
and sand dunes can be limited by increasing plant cover, 
among other practices.
The fate of eroded soil carbon is uncertain, with some 
studies indicating a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere 
and others suggesting a net sink. Reduced soil erosion has 
benefits for adaptation as it reduces vulnerability of soils to 
loss under climate extremes, increasing resilience to climate 
change. Some management practices implemented to 
control erosion, such as increasing ground cover, can reduce 
the vulnerability of soils to degradation/landslides, and 
prevention of soil erosion is a key measure used to tackle 
desertification. Because it protects the capacity of land to 
produce food, it also contributes positively to food security.

Reduced soil 
salinisation
Soil salinisation is a major process of land degradation that 
decreases soil fertility and affects agricultural production, 
aquaculture and forestry. It is a significant component 
of desertification processes in drylands. Practices to 
reduce soil salinisation include improvement of water 
management (e.g., water-use efficiency and irrigation/
drainage technology in arid/semi-arid areas, surface 
and groundwater management), improvement of soil 
health (through increase in soil organic matter content) 
and improved cropland, grazing land and livestock 
management, agroforestry and conservation agriculture.
Techniques to prevent and reverse soil salinisation may 
have small benefits for mitigation by enhancing carbon 
sinks. These techniques may benefit adaptation and food 
security by maintaining existing crop systems and closing 
yield gaps for rainfed crops. These techniques are central 
to reducing desertification and land degradation, since 
soil salinisation is a primary driver of both.

Reduced soil compaction mainly includes agricultural

Techniques to reduce soil compaction have variable impacts 
on GHG emissions but may benefit adaptation by improving 
soil climatic resilience. Since soil compaction is a driver of 
both desertification and land degradation, a reduction of 
soil compaction could benefit both. It could also help close 
yield gaps in rainfed crops.

Biochar addition 
to soil
The use of biochar, a solid product of the pyrolysis 
process, as a soil amendment increases the water-holding 
capacity of soil. It may therefore provide better access 
to water and nutrients for crops and other vegetation 
types (so can form part of cropland, grazing land and 
forest management).
The use of biochar increases carbon stocks in the soil. It 
can enhance yields in the tropics (but less so in temperate 
regions), thereby benefitting both adaptation and food 
security. Since it can improve soil water-holding capacity 
and nutrient-use efficiency, and can ameliorate heavy metal 
pollution and other impacts, it can benefit desertification and 
land degradation. The positive impacts could be tempered by 
additional pressure on land if large quantities of biomass are 
required as feedstock for biochar production.

Fire management
Fire management is a land management option aimed 
at safeguarding life, property and resources through the 
prevention, detection, control, restriction and suppression 
of fire in forest and other vegetation. It includes the 
improved use of fire for sustainable forestry management, 
including wildfire prevention and prescribed burning. 
Prescribed burning is used to reduce the risk of large, 
uncontrollable fires in forest areas, and controlled burning 
is among the most effective and economic methods of 
reducing fire danger and stimulating natural reforestation 
under the forest canopy and after clear felling.
The frequency and severity of large wildfires have 
increased around the globe in recent decades, which has 
impacted on forest carbon budgets. Fire can cause various 
GHG emissions such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane 
(CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), and others such as carbon 
monoxide (CO), volatile organic carbon, and smoke aerosols. 
Fire management can reduce GHG emissions and can reduce 
haze pollution, which has significant health and economic 
impacts. Fire management helps to prevent soil erosion and 
land degradation and is used in rangelands to conserve 
biodiversity and to enhance forage quality.

Reduced landslides

hazards
Landslides are mainly triggered by human activity 
(e.g., legal and illegal mining, fire, deforestation) in 
combination with climate. Management of landslides 
and natural hazards (e.g., floods, storm surges, droughts) 
is based on vegetation management (e.g., afforestation) 
and engineering works (e.g., dams, terraces, stabilisation 
and filling of erosion gullies).
Management of landslides and natural hazards is important 
for adaptation and is a crucial intervention for managing 
land degradation, since landslides and natural hazards are 
among the most severe degradation processes. In countries 
where mountain slopes are planted with food crops, reduced 
landslides will help deliver benefits for food security. Most 
deaths caused due to different disasters have occurred in 
developing countries, where poverty, poor education and 
health facilities and other aspects of development, increase 
exposure, vulnerability and risk.

Reduced pollution 
including 
acidification
Management of air pollution is connected to climate 
change by emission sources of air-polluting materials and 
their impacts on climate, human health and ecosystems, 
including agriculture. Acid deposition is one of the many 
consequences of air pollution, harming trees and other 
vegetation, as well as being a significant driver of land 
degradation. Practices that reduce acid deposition include 
prevention of emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and 
sulphur dioxide (SO2), which also reduce GHG emissions 
and other short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs). Reductions 
of SLCPs reduce warming in the near term and the overall 
rate of warming, which can be crucial for plants that are 
sensitive to even small increases in temperature. 
There are a few potential adverse side effects of reduction in 
air pollution to carbon sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems, 
because some forms of air pollutants can enhance crop 
productivity by increasing diffuse sunlight, compared to direct 
sunlight. Reactive nitrogen deposition could also enhance 
CO2 uptake in boreal forests and increase soil carbon pools 
to some extent. Air pollutants have different impacts on 
climate depending primarily on the composition, with 
some aerosols (and clouds seeded by them) increasing the 
reflection of solar radiation to space leading to net cooling, 
while others (e.g., black carbon and tropospheric ozone) 
having a net warming effect. Therefore, control of these 
different pollutants will have both positive and negative 
impacts on climate mitigation.

Reduced pollution 
including

continued
Management of harmful air pollutants such as fine 
particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) also mitigate 
the impacts of incomplete fossil fuel combustion and GHG 
emissions. In addition, management of pollutants such as 
tropospheric O3 has beneficial impacts on food production, 
since O3 decreases crop production. Control of urban and 
industrial air pollution would also mitigate the harmful 
effects of pollution and provide adaptation co-benefits via 
improved human health. Management of pollution contrib-
utes to aquatic ecosystem conservation since controlling 
air pollution, rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations, acid 
deposition, and industrial waste will reduce acidification 
of marine and freshwater ecosystems.
Management of 
invasive species/
encroachment
Agriculture and forests can be diverse, but often 
much of the diversity is non-native. Invasive species 
in different biomes have been introduced intentionally 
or unintentionally through export of ornamental plants 
or animals, and through the promotion of modern 
agriculture and forestry. Non-native species tend to 
be more numerous in larger than in smaller human-
modified landscapes (e.g., over 50% of species in an 
urbanised area or extensive agricultural fields can be 
non-native). Invasive alien species in the USA cause major 
environmental damage amounting to almost 120 billion 
USD yr–1. There are approximately 50,000 foreign species 
and the number is increasing. About 42% of the species 
on the Threatened or Endangered species lists are at 
risk primarily because of alien-invasive species. Invasive 
species can be managed through manual clearance of 
invasive species, while in some areas, natural enemies 
of the invasive species are introduced to control them.
Exotic species are used in forestry where local indigenous 
forests cannot produce the type, quantity and quality of 
forest products required. Planted forests of exotic tree 
species make significant contributions to the economy 
and provide multiple products and Nature’s Contributions 
to People. In general, exotic species are selected to have 
higher growth rates than native species and produce more 
wood per unit of area and time. In 2015, the total area of 
planted forest with non-native tree species was estimated 
to be around 0.5 Mkm2. Introduced species were dominant 
in South America, Oceania and Eastern and Southern Africa, 
where industrial forestry is dominant. The use of exotic 
tree species has played an important role in the production 
of roundwood, fibre, firewood and other forest products. 
The challenge is to manage existing and future plantation 
forests of alien trees to maximise current benefits, while 
minimising present and future risks and negative impacts, 
and without compromising future benefits. In many countries 
or regions, non-native trees planted for production or other 
purposes often lead to sharp conflicts of interest when 
they become invasive, and to negative impacts on Nature’s 
Contributions to People and nature conservation.

Restoration and 
reduced conversion 
of coastal wetlands
Coastal wetland restoration involves restoring degraded/
damaged coastal wetlands, including mangroves, salt 
marshes and seagrass ecosystems.
Coastal wetland restoration and avoided coastal wetland 
impacts have the capacity to increase carbon sinks and can 
provide benefits by regulating water flow and preventing 
downstream flooding. Coastal wetlands provide a natural 
defence against coastal flooding and storm surges by 
dissipating wave energy, reducing erosion and by helping to 
stabilise shore sediments. Since large areas of global coastal 
wetlands are degraded, restoration could provide benefits 
land degradation. Since some areas of coastal wetlands 
are used for food production, restoration could displace 
food production and damage local food supply (Section 
6.3.4), though some forms (e.g., mangrove restoration) 
can improve local fisheries.

Restoration and 
reduced conversion 
of peatlands
Peatland restoration involves restoring degraded/
damaged peatlands, which both increases carbon sinks, 
but also avoids ongoing CO2 emissions from degraded 
peatlands. So, as well as protecting biodiversity, it both 
prevents future emissions and creates a sink.
Avoided peat impacts and peatland restoration can provide 
significant mitigation, though restoration can lead to an 
increase in methane emissions, particularly in nutrient rich 
fens. There may also be benefits for climate adaptation by 
regulating water flow and preventing downstream flooding. 
Considering that large areas of global peatlands are 
degraded, peatland restoration is a key tool in addressing 
land degradation. Since large areas of tropical peatlands 
and some northern peatlands have been drained and 
cleared for food production, their restoration could displace 
food production and damage local food supply, potentially 
leading to adverse impacts on food security locally, though 
the global impact would be limited due to the relatively 
small areas affected.

Biodiversity 
conservation
Biodiversity conservation refers to practices aimed 
at maintaining components of biological diversity. It 
includes conservation of ecosystems and natural habitats, 
maintenance and recovery of viable populations of 
species in their natural surroundings (in-situ conservation) 
and, in the case of domesticated or cultivated species, 
in the surroundings where they have developed their 
distinctive properties outside their natural habitats (ex-situ 
conservation). Examples of biodiversity conservation 
measures are establishment of protected areas to achieve 
specific conservation objectives, preservation of biodiversity 
hotspots, land management to recover natural habitats, 
interventions to expand or control selective plant or animal 
species in productive lands or rangelands (e.g., rewilding). 
Biodiversity conservation measures interact with the 
climate system through many complex processes, which 
can have either positive or negative impacts. For example, 
establishment of protected areas can increase carbon 
storage in vegetation and soil, and tree planting to 
promote species richness and natural habitats can enhance 
carbon uptake capacity of ecosystems. Management of 
wild animals can influence climate via emissions of GHGs 
(from anaerobic fermentation of plant materials in the 
rumen), impacts on vegetation (via foraging), changes in fire 
frequency (as grazers lower grass and vegetation densities 
as potential fuels), and nutrient cycling and transport 
(by adding nutrients to soils). Conserving and restoring 
megafauna in northern regions also prevents thawing of 
permafrost and reduces woody encroachment, thus avoiding 
methane emissions and increases in albedo. Defaunation 
affects carbon storage in tropical forests and savannahs. In 
the tropics, the loss of mega-faunal frugivores is estimated 
be responsible for up to 10% reduction in carbon storage 
of global tropical forests. Frugivore rewilding programmes in 
the tropics are seen as carbon sequestration options that can 
be equally effective as tree planting schemes. Biodiversity 
conservation measures generally favour adaptation, 
but can interact with food security, land degradation or 
desertification. Protected areas for biodiversity reduce 
the land available for food production, and abundancies 
of some species (such as large animals) can influence 
land degradation processes by grazing, trampling 
and compacting soil surfaces, thereby altering surface 
temperatures and chemical reactions affecting sediment 
and carbon retention.

Enhanced 
weathering 
of minerals
The enhanced weathering of minerals that naturally 
absorb CO2 from the atmosphere has been proposed 
as a CDR technology with a large mitigation potential. 
The rocks are ground to increase the surface area and 
the ground minerals are then applied to the land where 
they absorb atmospheric CO2.
Enhanced mineral weathering can remove atmospheric 
carbon dioxide (CO2). Since ground minerals can increase pH, 
there could be some benefits for efforts to prevent or reverse 
land degradation where acidification is the driver of degrada-
tion. Since increasing soil pH in acidified soils can increase 
productivity, the same effect could provide some benefit for 
food security. Minerals used for enhanced weathering need 
to be mined, and mining has large impacts locally, though the 
total area mined is likely to be small on the global scale.

Bioenergy and 
bioenergy with 
carbon capture 
and storage 
(BECCS)
Bioenergy production can mitigate climate change 
by delivering an energy service, therefore avoiding 
combustion of fossil energy. It is the most common 
renewable energy source used in the world today and 
has a large potential for future deployment (see Cross-
Chapter Box 7 in this chapter). BECCS entails the use of 
bioenergy technologies (e.g., bioelectricity or biofuels) 
in combination with CO2 capture and storage (see also 
Glossary). BECCS simultaneously provides energy and 
can reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations (Chapter 2; 
Cross-Chapter Box 7 in this chapter) for a discussion 
of potentials and atmospheric effects); thus, BECCS 
is considered a CDR technology. While several BECCS 
demonstration projects exist, it has yet to be deployed 
at scale. Bioenergy and BECCS are widely-used in many 
future scenarios as a climate change mitigation option 
in the energy and transport sector, especially those 
scenarios aimed at a stabilisation of global climate 
at 2°C or less above pre-industrial levels.
Bioenergy and BECCS can compete for land and water with 
other uses. Increased use of bioenergy and BECCS can result 
in large expansion of cropland area, significant deforestation, 
and increased irrigation water use and water scarcity. Large-
scale use of bioenergy can result in increased food prices and 
can lead to an increase in the population at risk of hunger. 
As a result of these effects, large-scale bioenergy and BECCS 
can have negative impacts for food security. Interlinkages 
of bioenergy and BECCS with climate change adaptation, 
land degradation, desertification, and biodiversity are highly 
dependent on local factors such as the type of energy crop, 
management practice, and previous land use. For example, 
intensive agricultural practices aiming to achieve high crop 
yields, as is the case for some bioenergy systems, may have 
significant effects on soil health, including depletion of 
soil organic matter, resulting in negative impacts on land 
degradation and desertification. However, with low inputs 
of fossil fuels and chemicals, limited irrigation, heat/drought 
tolerant species, using marginal land, biofuel programmes 
can be beneficial to future adaptation of ecosystems.

Bioenergy and 
bioenergy with 
carbon capture 
and storage 
(BECCS) 
continued
Planting bioenergy crops, like perennial grasses, on 
degraded land can increase soil carbon and ecosystem 
quality (including biodiversity), thereby helping to preserve 
soil quality, reverse land degradation, prevent desertification 
processes, and reduce food insecurity. These effects depend 
on the scale of deployment, the feedstock, the prior land 
use, and which other response options are included (see 
Section 6.4.4.2). Large-scale production of bioenergy can 
require significant amounts of land, increasing potential 
pressures for land conversion and land degradation. Low 
levels of bioenergy deployment require less land, leading 
to smaller effects on forest cover and food prices; however, 
these land requirements could still be substantial. In terms 
of feedstocks, in some regions, they may not need irrigation, 
and thus would not compete for water with food crops. 
Additionally, the use of residues or microalgae could limit 
competition for land and biodiversity loss; however, residues 
could result in land degradation or decreased soil organic 
carbon. Whether woody bioenergy results in increased 
competition for land or not is disputed in the literature, 
with some studies suggesting reduced competition and 
others suggesting enhanced competition. One study noted 
that this effect changes over time, with complementarity 
between woody bioenergy and forest carbon sequestration 
in the near-term, but increased competition for land with 
afforestation/reforestation in the long term. Additionally, 
woody bioenergy could also result in land degradation.

Dietary change
Sustainable healthy diets represent a range of dietary 
changes to improve human diets, to make them healthy 
in terms of the nutrition delivered, and also (economically, 
environmentally and socially) sustainable. A ‘contract 
and converge’ model of transition to sustainable healthy 
diets would involve a reduction in over-consumption 
(particularly of livestock products) in over-consuming 
populations, with increased consumption of some food 
groups in populations where minimum nutritional needs 
are not met. Such a conversion could result in a decline 
in undernourishment, as well as reduction in the risk of 
morbidity and mortality due to over-consumption. 
A dietary shift away from meat can reduce GHG 
emissions, reduce cropland and pasture requirements, 
enhance biodiversity protection, and reduce mitigation 
costs. Additionally, dietary change can both increase 
potential for other land-based response options and reduce 
the need for them by freeing land. By decreasing pressure 
on land, demand reduction through dietary change could 
also allow for decreased production intensity, which 
could reduce soil erosion and provide benefits to a range 
of other environmental indicators such as deforestation 
and decreased use of fertiliser (nitrogen and phosphorus), 
pesticides, water and energy, leading to potential benefits 
for adaptation, desertification, and land degradation.

Reduced post-
harvest losses
Approximately one-third of the food produced for 
human consumption is wasted in post-production 
operations. Most of these losses are due to poor storage 
management. Post-harvest food losses underlie the 
food system’s failure to equitably enable accessible and 
affordable food in all countries. Reduced post-harvest 
food losses can improve food security in developing 
countries (while food loss in developed countries mostly 
occurs at the retail/consumer stage). The key drivers for 
post-harvest waste in developing countries are structural 
and infrastructure deficiencies. Thus, reducing food waste 
at the post-harvest stage requires responses that process, 
preserve and, where appropriate, redistribute food to 
where it can be consumed immediately.
Differences exist between farm food waste reduction 
technologies between small-scale agricultural systems and 
large-scale agricultural systems. A suite of options includes 
farm-level storage facilities, trade or exchange processing 
technologies including food drying, on-site farm processing 
for value addition, and improved seed systems. For large-
scale agri-food systems, options include cold chains for 
preservation, processing for value addition and linkages to 
value chains that absorb the harvests almost instantly into 
the supply chain. In addition to the specific options to reduce 
food loss and waste, there are more systemic possibilities 
related to food systems. Improving and expanding the ‘dry 
chain’ can significantly reduce food losses at the household 
level. Dry chains are analogous to the cold chain and refers 
to the ‘initial dehydration of durable commodities to levels 
preventing fungal growth’ followed by storage in moisture-
proof containers. Regional and local food systems are now 
being promoted to enable production, distribution, access 
and affordability of food. Reducing post-harvest losses has 
the potential to reduce emissions and could simultaneously 
reduce food costs and increase availability. The perishability 
and safety of fresh foods are highly susceptible to 
temperature increase.

Reduced food 
waste (consumer 
or retailer)
Since approximately 9–30% of all food is wasted, 
reducing food waste can reduce pressure on land 
(see also reducing post-harvest losses).
Reducing food waste could lead to a reduction in cropland 
area and GHG emissions, resulting in benefits for mitigation. 
By decreasing pressure on land, food waste reduction 
could allow for decreased production intensity, which 
could reduce soil erosion and provide benefits to a range 
of other environmental indicators such as deforestation 
and decreases in use of fertiliser (N and P), pesticides, water 
and energy, leading to potential benefits for adaptation, 
desertification, and land degradation.

Material 
substitution
Material substitution involves the use of wood or 
agricultural biomass (e.g., straw bales) instead of 
fossil fuel-based materials (e.g., concrete, iron, steel, 
aluminium) for building, textiles or other applications.
Material substitution reduces carbon emissions – both 
because the biomass sequesters carbon in materials while 
re-growth of forests can lead to continued sequestration, 
and because it reduces the demand for fossil fuels, delivering 
a benefit for mitigation. However, a potential trade-off 
exists between conserving carbon stocks and using forests 
for wood products. If the use of material for substitution 
was large enough to result in increased forest area, then 
the adverse side effects for adaptation and food security 
would be similar to that of reforestation and afforestation. 
In addition, some studies indicate that wooden buildings, 
if properly constructed, could reduce fire risk compared 
to steel, creating a co-benefit for adaptation. The effects 
of material substitution on land degradation depend on 
management practice; some forms of logging can lead to 
increased land degradation. Long-term forest management 
with carbon storage in long-lived products also results in 
atmospheric CO2 removal.

Sustainable 
sourcing
Sustainable sourcing includes approaches to ensure that 
the production of goods is done in a sustainable way, such 
as through low-impact agriculture, zero-deforestation 
supply chains, or sustainably harvested forest products. 
Currently around 8% of global forest area has been 
certified in some manner, and 25% of global industrial 
roundwood comes from certified forests. Sustainable 
sourcing also aims to enable producers to increase their 
percentage of the final value of commodities. Adding value 
to products requires improved innovation, coordination 
and efficiency in the food supply chain, as well as labelling 
to meet consumer demands. As such, sustainable sourcing 
is an approach that combines both supply- and demand-
side management. Promoting sustainable and value-
added products can reduce the need for compensatory 
extensification of agricultural areas and is a specific 
commitment of some sourcing programmes (such as forest 
certification programmes). Table 7.3 (Chapter 7) provides 
examples of the many sustainable sourcing programmes 
now available globally. 
Sustainable sourcing is expanding but accounts for only 
a small fraction of overall food and material production; many 
staple food crops do not have strong sustainability standards. 
Sustainable sourcing provides potential benefits for both 
climate mitigation and adaptation by reducing drivers of 
unsustainable land management, and by diversifying and 
increasing flexibility in the food system to climate stressors 
and shocks. Sustainable sourcing can lower expenditure for 
food processors and retailers by reducing losses. Adding 
value to products can extend a producer’s marketing season 
and provide unique opportunities to capture niche markets, 
thereby increasing their adaptive capacity to climate 
change. Sustainable sourcing can also provide significant 
benefits for food security, while simultaneously creating 
economic alternatives for the poor. Sustainable sourcing 
programmes often also have positive impacts on the overall 
efficiency of the food supply chain and can create closer 
and more direct links between producers and consumers. In 
some cases, processing of value-added products could lead 
to higher emissions or demand for resources in the food 
system, potentially leading to small adverse impacts on 
land degradation and desertification challenges.

Management of 
supply chains
Management of supply chains include a set of polycentric 
governance processes focused on improving efficiency 
and sustainability across the supply chain for each 
product, to reduce climate risk and profitably reduce 
emissions. Trade-driven food supply chains are becoming 
increasingly complex and are contributing to emissions. 
Improved management of supply chains can include 
1) better food transport and increasing the economic 
value or reduce risks of commodities through production 
processes (e.g., packaging, processing, cooling, drying, 
extracting) and 2) improved policies for stability of 
food supply, as globalised food systems and commodity 
markets are vulnerable to food price volatility. The 
2007–2008 food price shocks negatively affected food 
security for millions, most severely in Sub-Saharan Africa. 
Increasing the stability of food supply chains is a key 
goal to increase food security, given that climate change 
threatens to lead to more production shocks in the future. 
Successful implementation of supply chain management 
practices is dependent on organisational capacity, the agility 
and flexibility of business strategies, the strengthening 
of public-private policies and effectiveness of supply-
chain governance. Existing practices include a) greening 
supply chains (e.g., utilising products and services with 
a reduced impact on the environment and human health), 
b) adoption of specific sustainability instruments among 
agri-food companies (e.g., eco-innovation practices ), 
c) adopting emission accounting tools (e.g., carbon and water 
foot-printing), and d) implementing ‘demand forecasting’ 
strategies (e.g., changes in consumer preference for ‘green’ 
products). In terms of food supply, measures to improve 
stability in traded markets can include i) financial and trade 
policies, such as reductions on food taxes and import tariffs, 
(ii) shortening food supply chains (SFSCs), (iii) increasing food 
production, (iv) designing alternative distribution networks, 
(v) increasing food market transparency and reducing 
speculation in futures markets, (vi) increasing storage options, 
and (vii) increasing subsidies and food-based safety nets.

Enhanced urban 
food systems
Urban areas are becoming the principal territories 
for intervention in improving food access through 
innovative strategies that aim to reduce hunger and 
improve livelihoods. Interventions include urban and 
peri-urban agriculture and forestry and local food 
policy and planning initiatives such as Food Policy 
Councils and city-region-wide regional food strategies. 
Such systems have demonstrated inter-linkages of the 
city and its citizens with surrounding rural areas to 
create sustainable, and more nutritious food supplies 
for the city, while improving the health status of urban 
dwellers, reducing pollution levels, adapting to and 
mitigating climate change, and stimulating economic 
development. Options include support for urban and 
peri-urban agriculture, green infrastructure (e.g., green 
roofs), local markets, enhanced social (food) safety 
nets and development of alternative food sources 
and technologies, such as vertical farming.
Urban territorial areas have a potential to reduce GHG 
emissions through improved food systems to reduce vehicle 
miles of food transportation, localised carbon capture 
and food waste reduction. The benefits of urban food 
forests that are intentionally planted woody perennial 
food-producing species, are also cited for their carbon 
sequestration potentials. However, new urban food 
systems may have diverse and unexpected adverse side 
effects with climate systems, such as lower efficiencies 
in food supply and higher costs than modern large-scale 
agriculture. Diversifying markets, considering value-added 
products in the food supply system may help to improve 
food security by increasing its economic performance and 
revenues to local farmers.

foot-printing), d) implementing ‘demand forecasting’ 
strategies (e.g., changes in consumer preference for 
‘green’ products) and, e) supporting polycentric supply-
chain governance processes. 
Improved food processing and retailing can provide benefits 
for climate mitigation since GHG-friendly foods can reduce 
agri-food GHG emissions from transportation, waste and 
energy use. In cases where climate extremes and natural 
disasters disrupt supply chain networks, improved food 
processing and retailing can benefit climate adaptation by 
buffering the impacts of changing temperature and rainfall 
patterns on upstream agricultural production. It can provide 
benefits for food security by supporting healthier diets and 
reducing food loss and waste. Successful implementation 
is dependent on organisational capacity, the agility and 
flexibility of business strategies, the strengthening of public-
private policies and effectiveness of supply-chain governance.

Improved energy 
use in food systems
Agriculture’s energy efficiency can be improved to 
reduce the dependency on non-renewable energy 
sources. This can be realised either by decreased 
energy inputs, or through increased outputs per unit 
of input. In some countries, managerial inefficiency 
(rather than a technology gap) is the main source for 
energy-efficiency loss. Heterogenous patterns of energy 
efficiency exist at the national scale and promoting 
energy-efficient technologies along with managerial 
capacity development can reduce the gap and provide 
large benefits for climate adaptation. Improvements in 
carbon monitoring and calculation techniques such as 
the foot-printing of agricultural products can enhance 
energy-efficiency transition management and uptake 
in agricultural enterprises.
Transformation to low-carbon technologies such as 
renewable energy and energy efficiency can offer 
opportunities for significant climate change mitigation, 
for example, by providing a substitute to transport fuel 
that could benefit marginal agricultural resources, while 
simultaneously contributing to long-term economic growth. 
In poorer nations, increased energy efficiency in agricultural 
value-added production, in particular, can provide large 
mitigation benefits. Under certain scenarios, the efficiency of 
agricultural systems can stagnate and could exert pressure 
on grasslands and rangelands, thereby impacting on land 
degradation and desertification. Rebound effects can also 
occur, with adverse impacts on emissions.

Management of 
urban sprawl
Unplanned urbanisation leading to sprawl and 
extensification of cities along the rural-urban fringe has 
been identified as a driver of forest and agricultural land 
loss and a threat to food production around cities. It 
has been estimated that urban expansion will result in 
a 1.8–2.4% loss of global croplands by 2030. This rapid 
urban expansion is especially strong in new emerging 
towns and cities in Asia and Africa. Policies to prevent such 
urbanisation have included integrated land-use planning, 
agricultural zoning ordinances and agricultural districts, 
urban redevelopment, arable land reclamation, and 
transfer/purchase of development rights or easements.
The prevention of uncontrolled urban sprawl may provide 
adaptation co-benefits, but adverse side effects for 
adaptation might arise due to restricted ability of people 
to move in response to climate change.

Livelihood 
diversification
When households’ livelihoods depend on a small number 
of sources of income without much diversification, and 
when those income sources are in fields that are highly 
climate dependent, like agriculture and fishing, this 
dependence can put food security and livelihoods at risk. 
Livelihood diversification (drawing from a portfolio of 
dissimilar sources of livelihood as a tool to spread risk) 
has been identified as one option to increase incomes 
and reduce poverty, increase food security, and promote 
climate resilience and risk reduction.
Livelihood diversification offers benefits for desertification 
and land degradation, particularly through non-traditional 
crops or trees in agroforestry systems which improve soil. 
Livelihood diversification may increase on-farm biodiversity 
due to these investments in more ecosystem-mimicking 
production systems, like agroforestry and polycultures. 
Diversification into non-agricultural fields, such as wage 
labour or trading, is increasingly favoured by farmers as 
a low-cost strategy, particularly to respond to increasing 
climate risks.

Use of local seeds
Using local seeds (also called seed sovereignty) refers 
to use of non-improved, non-commercial seeds varieties. 
These can be used and stored by local farmers as low-cost 
inputs and can often help contribute to the conservation of 
local varieties and landraces, increasing local biodiversity. 
Many local seeds also require no pesticide or fertiliser use, 
leading to less land degradation in their use. 
Use of local seeds is important in the many parts of 
the developing world that do not rely on commercial 
seed inputs. Promotion of local seed-saving initiatives 
can include seed networks, banks and exchanges, and 
non-commercial open source plant breeding. These locally 
developed seeds can help protect local agrobiodiversity and 
can often be more climate resilient than generic commercial 
varieties, although the impacts on food security and overall 
land degradation are inconclusive.

Disaster risk 
management
Disaster risk management encompasses many 
approaches to try to reduce the consequences of 
climate- and weather-related disasters and events 
on socio-economic systems. The Hyogo Framework for 
Action is a UN framework for nations to build resilience 
to disasters through effective integration of disaster risk 
considerations into sustainable development policies. 
For example, in Vietnam a national strategy on disasters 
based on Hyogo has introduced the concept of a ‘four-
on-the-spot’ approach for disaster risk management of: 
proactive prevention, timely response, quick and effective 
recovery, and sustainable development. Other widespread 
approaches to disaster risk management include using 
early warning systems that can encompass 1) education 
systems, 2) hazard and risk maps, 3) hydrological and 
meteorological monitoring (such as flood forecasting 
or extreme weather warnings), and 4) communications 
systems to pass on information to enable action. These 
approaches have long been considered to reduce the 
risk of household asset damage during one-off climate 
events and are increasingly being combined with climate 
adaptation policies. 
Community-based disaster risk management has been 
pointed to as one of the most successful ways to ensure that 
information reaches the people who need to be participants 
in risk reduction. Effective disaster risk management 
approaches must be ‘end-to-end,’ reaching communities at 
risk and supporting and empowering vulnerable communities 
to take appropriate action. The most effective early warning 
systems are not simply technical systems of information 
dissemination, but utilise and develop community capacities, 
create local ownership of the system, and are based on 
a shared understanding of needs and purpose. Tapping 
into existing traditional or local knowledge has also been 
recommended for disaster risk management approaches 
to reducing vulnerability.

Risk-sharing 
instruments
Risk-sharing instruments can encompass a variety of 
approaches. Intra-household risk pooling is a common 
strategy in rural communities, such as through extended 
family financial transfers; one study found that 65% of 
poor households in Jamaica report receiving transfers, and 
such transfers can account for up to 75% of household 
income or more after crisis events. Community rotating 
savings and credit associations (ROSCAs) have long been 
used for general risk pooling and can be a source of 
financing to cope with climate variability as well. Credit 
services have been shown to be important for adaptation 
actions and risk reduction. Insurance of various kinds is 
also a form of risk pooling. Commercial crop insurance is 
one of the most widely used risk-hedging financial vehicles, 
and can involve both traditional indemnity-based insurance 
that reimburses clients for estimated financial losses from 
shortfalls, or index insurance that pays out the value of 
an index (such as weather events) rather than actual 
losses; the former is more common for large farms in the 
developed world and the latter for smaller non-commercial 
farms in developing countries. 
Locally developed risk-pooling measures show general 
positive impacts on household livelihoods. However, more 
commercial approaches have mixed effects. Commercial 
crop insurance is highly subsidised in much of the developed 
world. Index insurance programmes have often failed 
to attract sufficient buyers or have remained financially 
unfeasible for commercial insurance sellers. The overall 
impact of index insurance on food production supply and 
access has also not been assessed. Traditional crop insurance 
has generally been seen as positive for food security as it 
leads to expansion of agricultural production areas and 
increased food supply. However, insurance may also ‘mask’ 
truly risky agriculture and prevent farmers from seeking 
less risky production strategies. Insurance can also provide 
perverse incentives for farmers to bring additional lands into 
crop production, leading to greater risk of degradation.

Bioenergy and BECCS potential
Using biomass to produce heat, electricity and transport fuels (bioenergy) instead of coal, oil, and natural gas can reduce GHG 
emissions. Combining biomass conversion technologies with systems that capture CO2 and inject it into geological formations, 
BECCS can deliver net negative emissions. The net climate effects of bioenergy and BECCS depend on the magnitude of bioenergy 
supply chain emissions and land/climate interactions, described further below.

Of this, more than half was traditional biomass, predominately used for cooking and heating in developing regions, bioelectricity accounted for about 1.7 EJ, and transport 
biofuels for 3.19 EJ. (Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 7).
5 
The future availability of biomass is usually discussed in terms of a hierarchy of potentials: theoretical>technical>economic. Caution is required, however, as these terms 
are not always defined consistently and estimates depend on the specific definitions and calculation methodologies. 
Biomass in 2013 contributed about 60 EJ (10%) to global primary energy4 (WBA 2016). In 2011, the IPCC Special Report on Renewable 
Energy Sources concluded that biomass supply for energy could reach 100–300 EJ yr–1 by 2050 with the caveat that the technical 
potential5 cannot be determined precisely while societal preferences are unclear; that deployment depends on ‘factors that are 
inherently uncertain’; and that biomass use could evolve in a ‘sustainable’ or ‘unsustainable’ way, depending on the governance 
context (IPCC 2012). The IPCC WGIII AR5 report noted, in addition, that high deployment levels would require extensive use of 
technologies able to convert lignocellulosic biomass such as forest wood, agricultural residues, and lignocellulosic crops. The IPCC Special 
Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR15) noted that high levels of bioenergy deployment may result in adverse side effects for food 
security, ecosystems, biodiversity, water use, and nutrients (de Coninck et al. 2018). 
Although estimates of potential are uncertain, there is high confidence that the most important factors determining future 
biomass supply are land availability and land productivity. These factors are, in turn, determined by competing uses of land and 
a myriad of environmental and economic considerations (Dornburg et al. 2010; Batidzirai et al. 2012; Erb et al. 2012; Slade 2014, 
Searle and Malins 2014). Overlaying estimates of technical potential with such considerations invariably results in a smaller estimate. 
Recent studies that have attempted to do this estimate that 50–244 EJ biomass could be produced on 0.1–13 Mkm2 (Fuss et al. 2018; 
Schueler et al. 2016; Searle and Malins 2014; IPCC 2018; Wu et al. 2019; Heck et al. 2018; de Coninck et al. 2018). While preferences 
concerning economic, social and environmental objectives vary geographically and over time, studies commonly estimate ‘sustainable’ 
potentials by introducing restrictions intended to protect environmental values and avoid negative effects on poor and vulnerable 
segments in societies.
Estimates of global geological CO2 storage capacity are large – ranging from 1680 GtCO2 to 24,000 GtCO2 (McCollum et al. 2014) – 
however, the potential of BECCS may be significantly constrained by socio-political and technical and geographical considerations, 
including limits to knowledge and experience (Chapters 6 and 7). 
Bioenergy and BECCS use in mitigation scenarios 
Most mitigation scenarios include substantial deployment of bioenergy technologies (Clarke et al. 2014; Fuss et al. 2014; IPCC 
2018). Across all scenarios, the amount of bioenergy and BECCS ranges from 0 EJ yr–1 to 561 EJ yr–1 in 2100 (Figure 1 in this box, 
left panel). Notably, all 1.5°C pathways include bioenergy, requiring as much as 7 Mkm2 to be dedicated to the production of energy 
crops in 2050 (Rogelj et al. 2018a). If BECCS is excluded as a mitigation option, studies indicate that more biomass may be required 
in order to substitute for a greater proportion of fossil fuels (Muratori et al. 2016; Rose et al. 2014). 
Different Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) use alternative approaches to land allocation when determining where and how 
much biomass is used, with some relying on economic approaches and some relying on rule-based approaches (Popp et al. 2014). 
Despite these differences, a consistent finding across models is that increasing biomass supply to the extent necessary to support 
deep decarbonisation is likely to involve substantial land-use change (Popp et al. 2017) (Cross-Chapter Box 9 in this chapter). In 
model runs, bioenergy deployment and the consequent demand for biomass and land, is influenced by assumptions around the price 
of bioenergy, the yield of bioenergy crops, the cost of production (including the costs of fertiliser and irrigation if used), the demand 
for land for other uses, and the inclusion of policies (e.g., subsidies, taxes, constraints) that may alter land-use or bioenergy demand. 
In general, higher carbon prices result in greater bioenergy deployment (Cross-Chapter Box 7, Figure 1, right panel) and a larger 
percentage of BECCS. Other factors can also strongly influence bioenergy use, including the cost and availability of fossil fuels (Calvin 
et al. 2016a), socio-economics (Popp et al. 2017), and policy (Calvin et al. 2014; Reilly et al. 2012).
Co-benefits, adverse side effect, and risks associated with bioenergy
The production and use of biomass for bioenergy can have co-benefits, adverse side effects, and risks for land degradation, food insecurity, 
GHG emissions, and other environmental goals. These impacts are context specific and depend on the scale of deployment, initial land 
use, land type, bioenergy feedstock, initial carbon stocks, climatic region and management regime (Qin et al. 2016; Del Grosso 
et al. 2014; Alexander et al. 2015; Popp et al. 2017; Davis et al. 2013; Mello et al. 2014; Hudiburg et al. 2015; Carvalho et al. 2016; 
Silva-Olaya et al. 2017; Whitaker et al. 2018; Robledo-Abad et al. 2017; Jans et al. 2018).

Consortium (IAMC) Scenario Explorer developed for the SR15 (Huppmann et al. 2018; Rogelj et al. 2018a). The left panel A. shows bioenergy deployment over time 
for the entire scenario database (grey areas) and the four illustrative pathways from SR15 (Rogelj et al. 2018a). The right panel B. shows global land area for energy 
crops in 2100 versus total global bioenergy consumption in 2100; colours indicate the carbon price in 2100 (in 2010 USD per tCO2). Note that this fi gure includes 
409 scenarios, many of which exceed 1.5°C.
Synergistic outcomes with bioenergy are possible, for example, strategic integration of perennial bioenergy crops with conventional 
crops can provide multiple production and environmental benefi ts, including management of dryland salinity, enhanced biocontrol 
and biodiversity, and reduced eutrophication (Davis et al. 2013; Larsen et al. 2017; Cacho et al. 2018; Odgaard et al. 2019). Additionally, 
planting perennial bioenergy crops on low-carbon soil could enhance soil carbon sequestration (Bárcena et al. 2014; Schröder et al. 
2018; Walter et al. 2015; Robertson et al. 2017a; Rowe et al. 2016; Chadwick et al. 2014; Immerzeel et al. 2014; Del Grosso et al. 2014; 
Mello et al. 2014; Whitaker et al. 2018). However, large-scale expansion of bioenergy may also result in increased competition for land 
(DeCicco 2013; Humpenöder et al. 2018; Bonsch et al. 2016; Harris et al. 2015; Richards et al. 2017; Ahlgren et al. 2017; Bárcena et al. 
2014), increased GHG emissions from land-use change and land management, loss in biodiversity, and nutrient leakage (Harris et al. 
2018; Harper et al. 2018; Popp et al. 2011b; Wiloso et al. 2016; Behrman et al. 2015; Valdez et al. 2017; Hof et al. 2018). If biomass 
crops are planted on land with a high carbon stock, the carbon loss due to land conversion may take decades to over a century to be 
compensated by either fossil fuel substitution or CCS (Harper et al. 2018). Competition for land may be experienced locally or regionally 
and is one of the determinants of food prices, food security (Popp et al. 2014; Bailey 2013; Pahl-Wostl et al. 2018; Rulli et al. 2016; 
Yamagata et al. 2018; Franz et al. 2017; Kline et al. 2017; Schröder et al. 2018) and water availability (Rulli et al. 2016; Bonsch et al. 2015; 
Pahl-Wostl et al. 2018; Bailey 2013; Chang et al. 2016; Bárcena et al. 2014). 
Experience in countries at quite different levels of economic development (Brazil, Malawi and Sweden) has shown that persistent efforts 
over several decades to combine improved technical standards and management approaches with strong governance and coherent 
policies, can facilitate long-term investment in more sustainable production and sourcing of liquid biofuels (Johnson and Silveira 2014). 
For woody biomass, combining effective governance with active forest management over long time periods can enhance substitution-
sequestration co-benefi ts, such as in Sweden where bioenergy has tripled during the last 40 years (currently providing about 25% of 
total energy supply) while forest carbon stocks have continued to grow (Lundmark et al. 2014). A variety of approaches are available at 
landscape level and in national and regional policies to better reconcile food security, bioenergy and ecosystem services, although more 
empirical evidence is needed (Mudombi et al. 2018; Manning et al. 2015; Kline et al. 2017; Maltsoglou et al. 2014; Lamers et al. 2016).
Thus, while there is high confi dence that the technical potential for bioenergy and BECCS is large, there is also very high confi dence
that this potential is reduced when environmental, social and economic constraints are considered. The effects of bioenergy production 
on land degradation, water scarcity, biodiversity loss, and food insecurity are scale and context specifi c (high confi dence). Large areas of 
monoculture  bioenergy crops  that displace other land uses can exacerbate these challenges, while  integration  into  sustainably 
managed agricultural landscapes can ameliorate them (medium confi dence).

Potentials for addressing 
the land challenges
In this section, we assess how each of the integrated response 
options described in Section 6.2 address the land challenges of 
climate change mitigation (Section 6.3.1), climate change adaptation 
(Section 6.3.2), desertification (Section 6.3.3), land degradation 
(Section 6.3.4), and food security (Section 6.3.5). The quantified 
potentials across all of mitigation, adaptation, desertification, land 
degradation and food security are summarised and categorised for 
comparison in Section 6.3.6.
6.3.1 
Potential of the integrated response 
options for delivering mitigation 
In this section, the impacts of integrated response options on climate 
change mitigation are assessed.
6.3.1.1 
Integrated response options based 
on land management
In this section, the impacts on climate change mitigation of integrated 
response options based on land management are assessed. Some 
of the caveats of these potential mitigation studies are discussed in 
Chapter 2 and Section 6.2.1.
Integrated response options based on land 
management in agriculture
Increasing the productivity of land used for food production can 
deliver significant mitigation by avoiding emissions that would 
occur if increased food demand were met through expansion of 
the agricultural land area (Burney et al. 2010). If pursued through 
increased agrochemical inputs, numerous adverse impacts on 
GHG emissions (and other environmental sustainability) can occur 
(Table  6.5), but, if pursued through sustainable intensification, 
increased food productivity could provide high levels of mitigation. For 
example, yield improvement has been estimated to have contributed 
to emissions savings of >13 GtCO2 yr–1 since 1961 (Burney et al. 
2010) (Table 6.13). This can also reduce the GHG intensity of products 
(Bennetzen et  al. 2016a,b) which means a smaller environmental 
footprint of production, since demand can be met using less land 
and/or with fewer animals.
Improved cropland management could provide moderate levels of 
mitigation (1.4–2.3 GtCO2e yr–1) (Smith et al. 2008, 2014; Pradhan 
et  al. 2013) (Table 6.13). The lower estimate of potential is from 
Pradhan et  al. (2013) for decreasing emissions intensity, and the 
upper end of technical potential is estimated by adding technical 
potentials for cropland management (about 1.4 GtCO2e yr–1), rice 
management (about 0.2 GtCO2e yr–1) and restoration of degraded 
land (about 0.7  GtCO2e yr–1) from Smith et  al. (2008) and Smith 
et al. (2014). Note that much of this potential arises from soil carbon 
sequestration so there is an overlap with that response option. 
(Section 6.3.1.1).
Grazing lands can store large stocks of carbon in soil and root 
biomass compartments (Conant and Paustian 2002; O’Mara 2012; 
Zhou et  al. 2017). The global mitigation potential is moderate 
(1.4–1.8 GtCO2 yr–1), with the lower value in the range for technical 
potential taken from Smith et al. (2008) which includes only grassland 
management measures, and the upper value in the range from 
Herrero et al. (2016), which includes also indirect effects and some 
components of livestock management, and soil carbon sequestration, 
so there is overlap with these response options (Section 6.3.1.1). 
Cross-Chapter Box 7 (continued)
Inventory reporting for BECCS and bioenergy 
One of the complications in assessing the total GHG flux associated with bioenergy under United Nations Framework Convention 
on Climate Change (UNFCCC) reporting protocols is that fluxes from different aspects of bioenergy lifecycle are reported in different 
sectors and are not linked. In the energy sector, bioenergy is treated as carbon neutral at the point of biomass combustion because 
all change in land carbon stocks due to biomass harvest or land-use change related to bioenergy are reported under agriculture, 
forestry and other land-use (AFOLU) sector. Use of fertilisers is captured in the agriculture sector, while fluxes related to transport/
conversion and removals due to CCS are reported in the energy sector. IAMs follow a similar reporting convention. Thus, the whole 
lifecycle GHG effects of bioenergy systems are not readily observed in national GHG inventories or modelled emissions estimates (see 
also IPCC 2006; SR15 Chapter 2 Technical Annex; Chapter 2).
Bioenergy in this report
Bioenergy and BECCS are discussed throughout this special report. Chapter 1 provides an introduction to bioenergy and BECCS 
and its links to land and climate. Chapter 2 discusses mitigation potential, land requirements and biophysical climate implications. 
Chapter 4 includes a discussion of the threats and opportunities with respect to land degradation. Chapter 5 discusses linkages 
between bioenergy and BECCS and food security. Chapter 6 synthesises the co-benefits and adverse side effects for mitigation, 
adaptation, desertification, land degradation, and food security, as well as barriers to implementation (e.g., cost, technological 
readiness, etc.). Chapter 7 includes a discussion of risk, policy, governance, and decision-making with respect to bioenergy and BECCS.

a Note that Chapter 2 reports mitigation potential for subcategories within this response option and not the combined total reported here. 
Conant et al. (2005) caution that increases in soil carbon stocks could 
be offset by increases in N2O fluxes.
The mitigation potential of improved livestock management is also 
moderate (0.2–1.8 GtCO2e yr–1; Smith et al. (2008) including only 
direct livestock measures; Herrero et al. (2016) include also indirect 
effects, and some components of grazing land management and 
soil carbon sequestration) to high (6.13 GtCO2e yr–1) (Pradhan et al. 
2013) (Table 6.13). There is an overlap with other response options 
(Section 6.3.1.1).
Zomer et al. (2016) reported that the trees agroforestry landscapes 
have increased carbon stock by 7.33 GtCO2 between 2000–2010, 
which is equivalent to 0.7 GtCO2 yr–1. Estimates of global potential 
range from 0.1 GtCO2 yr–1 to 5.7 GtCO2 yr–1 (from an optimum 
implantation scenario of Hawken (2017), based on an assessment of 
all values in Griscom et al. (2017), Hawken (2017), Zomer et al. (2016) 
and Dickie et al. (2014) (Table 6.13).
Agricultural diversification mainly aims at increasing climate resilience, 
but it may have a small (but globally unquantified) mitigation 
potential as a function of type of crop, fertiliser management, tillage 
system, and soil type (Campbell et al. 2014; Cohn et al. 2017).
Reducing conversion of grassland to cropland could provide 
significant climate mitigation by retaining soil carbon stocks that 
might otherwise be lost. When grasslands are converted to croplands, 
they lose about 36% of their soil organic carbon stocks after 20 years 
(Poeplau et  al. 2011). Assuming an average starting soil organic 
carbon stock of grasslands of 115 tC ha–1 (Poeplau et al. 2011), this 
is equivalent to a loss of 41.5 tC ha–1 on conversion to cropland. 
Mean annual global cropland conversion rates (1961–2003) have 
been around 47,000 km2 yr–1 (Krause et al. 2017), or 940000 km2 
over a 20-year period. The equivalent loss of soil organic carbon 
over 20 years would therefore be 14 GtCO2e = 0.7 GtCO2 yr–1. 
Griscom et al. (2017) estimate a cost-effective mitigation potential of 
0.03 GtCO2 yr–1 (Table 6.13).
Integrated water management provides moderate benefits for 
climate mitigation due to interactions with other land management 
strategies. For example, promoting soil carbon conservation 
(e.g., reduced tillage) can improve the water retention capacity of 
soils. Jat et al. (2015) found that improved tillage practices and residue 
incorporation increased water-use efficiency by 30%, rice–wheat 
yields by 5–37%, income by 28–40% and reduced GHG emission by 
16–25%. While irrigated agriculture accounts for only 20% of the 
total cultivated land, the energy consumption from groundwater 
irrigation is significant. However, current estimates of mitigation 
potential are limited to reductions in GHG emissions mainly in 
cropland and rice cultivation (Smith et al. 2008, 2014) (Chapter 2 
and Table 6.13). Li et al. (2006) estimated a 0.52–0.72 GtCO2 yr–1 
reduction using the alternate wetting and drying technique. Current 
estimates of N2O release from terrestrial soils and wetlands accounts 
for 10–15% of anthropogenically fixed nitrogen on the Earth System 
(Wang et al. 2017). 
Table 6.13 summarises the mitigation potentials for agricultural 
response options, with confidence estimates based on the thresholds 
outlined in Table 6.53 in Section 6.4.6, and indicative (not exhaustive) 
references upon which the evidence in based.
Integrated response options based on land management in forests
Forest management could potentially contribute to moderate 
mitigation benefits globally, up to about 2 GtCO2e yr–1 (Chapter 2, 
Table 6.14). For managed forests, the most effective forest carbon 
mitigation strategy is the one that, through increasing biomass 
productivity, optimises the carbon stocks (in forests and in long-
lived products) as well as the wood substitution effects for a given 
time frame (Smyth et al. 2014; Grassi et al. 2018; Nabuurs et al. 
2007; Lewis et al. 2019; Kurz et al. 2016; Erb et al. 2017). Estimates of 
the mitigation potential vary also depending on the counterfactual, 
such as business-as-usual management (e.g., Grassi et al. 2018) or 
other scenarios. Climate change will affect the mitigation potential 
of forest management due to an increase in extreme events like 
585

fires, insects and pathogens (Seidl et  al. 2017). More detailed 
estimates are available at regional or biome level. For instance, 
according to Nabuurs et al. (2017), the implementation of Climate-
Smart Forestry (a combination of forest management, expansion of 
forest areas, energy substitution, establishment of forest reserves, 
etc.) in the European Union has the potential to contribute to an 
additional 0.4 GtCO2 yr–1 mitigation by 2050. Sustainable forest 
management is often associated with a number of co-benefits 
for adaptation, ecosystem services, biodiversity conservation, 
microclimatic regulation, soil erosion protection, coastal area 
protection and water and flood regulation (Locatelli 2011). Forest 
management mitigation measures are more likely to be long-
lasting if integrated into adaptation measures for communities 
and ecosystems, for example, through landscape management 
(Locatelli et  al. 2011). Adoption of reduced-impact logging and 
wood processing technologies along with financial incentives can 
reduce forest fires, forest degradation, maintain timber production, 
and retain carbon stocks (Sasaki et al. 2016). Forest certification 
may support sustainable forest management, helping to prevent 
forest degradation and over-logging (Rametsteiner and Simula 
2003). Community forest management has proven a viable model 
for sustainable forestry, including for carbon sequestration (Chhatre 
and Agrawal 2009) (Chapter 7, Section 7.7.4).
Reducing deforestation and forest degradation rates represents 
one of the most effective and robust options for climate change 
mitigation, with large mitigation benefits globally (Chapters 2 and 4, 
and Table 6.14). Because of the combined climate impacts of GHGs 
and biophysical effects, reducing deforestation in the tropics has 
a major climate mitigation effect, with benefits at local levels too 
(Alkama and Cescatti 2016) (Chapter 2). Reduced deforestation 
and forest degradation typically lead to large co-benefits for other 
ecosystem services (Table 6.14).
A large range of estimates exist in the scientific literature for the 
mitigation potential of reforestation and forest restoration, and 
they sometimes overlap with estimates for afforestation. At global 
level, the overall potential for these options is large, reaching about 
10 GtCO2 yr–1 (Chapter 2 and Table 6.14). The greatest potential for 
these options is in tropical and subtropical climate (Houghton and 
Nassikas 2018). Furthermore, climate change mitigation benefits of 
afforestation, reforestation and forest restoration are reduced at high 
latitudes owing to the surface albedo feedback (Chapter 2).
Table 6.14 summarises the mitigation potentials for forest response 
options, with confidence estimates based on the thresholds outlined 
in Table 6.53 in Section 6.3.6, and indicative (not exhaustive) 
references upon which the evidence in based.

Integrated response options based on land management of soils
The global mitigation potential for increasing soil organic 
matter stocks in mineral soils is estimated to be in the range of 
1.3–5.1  GtCO2e  yr–1, though the full literature range is wider 
(Fuss et al. 2018; Lal 2004; de Coninck et al. 2018; Sanderman et al. 
2017; Smith et al. 2008; Smith 2016) (Table 6.15).
The management and control of erosion may prevent losses of 
organic carbon in water- or wind- transported sediments, but since 
the final fate of eroded material is still debated, ranging from 
a source of 1.36–3.67 GtCO2 yr–1 (Jacinthe and Lal 2001; Lal 2004) to 
a sink of 0.44–3.67 GtCO2 yr–1 (Smith et al. 2001; Stallard 1998; Van 
Oost et al. 2007) (Table 6.15), the overall impact of erosion control 
on mitigation is context-specific and uncertain at the global level 
(Hoffmann et al. 2013). 
Salt-affected soils are highly constrained environments that require 
permanent prevention of salinisation. Their mitigation potential is 
likely to be small (Wong et al. 2010; UNCTAD 2011; Dagar et al. 2016). 
Soil compaction prevention could reduce N2O emissions by 
minimising anoxic conditions favourable for denitrification (Mbow 
et al. 2010), but its carbon sequestration potential depends on crop 
management, and the global mitigation potential, though globally 
unquantified, is likely to be small (Chamen et al. 2015; Epron et al. 
2016; Tullberg et al. 2018) (Table 6.15).
For biochar, a global analysis of technical potential, in which biomass 
supply constraints were applied to protect against food insecurity, 
loss of habitat and land degradation, estimated technical potential 
abatement of 3.7–6.6 GtCO2e yr–1 (including 2.6–4.6 GtCO2e yr–1 
carbon stabilisation). Considering all published estimates by Woolf 
et al. (2010), Smith (2016), Fuss et al. (2018), Griscom et al. (2017),

Dickie et  al. (2014), Lenton (2010), Lenton (2014), Roberts et  al. 
(2009), Pratt and Moran (2010) and IPCC (2018), the low value 
for the range of potentials of 0.03 GtCO2e yr–1 is for the ‘plausible’ 
scenario of Hawken, (2017) (Table 6.15). Fuss et al. (2018) propose 
a  range of 0.5–2 GtCO2e yr–1 as the sustainable potential for 
negative emissions through biochar, similar to the range proposed by 
Smith (2016) and IPCC (2018).

Integrated response options based on land  
management in all/other ecosystems
For fire management, total emissions from fires have been in the 
order of 8.1 GtCO2e yr–1 for the period 1997–2016 (Chapter 2 and 
Cross-Chapter Box 3) and there are important synergies between 
air pollution and climate change control policies. Reduction in fire 
CO2 emissions due to fire suppression and landscape fragmentation 
associated with increases in population density is calculated to 
enhance land carbon uptake by 0.48 GtCO2e yr–1 for the 1960–2009 
period (Arora and Melton 2018) (Table 6.16).
Management of landslides and natural hazards is a key climate 
adaptation option but, due to limited global areas vulnerable to 
landslides and natural hazards, its mitigation potential is likely to be 
modest (Noble et al. 2014).
In terms of management of pollution, including acidification, United 
Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and World Meterological 
Organization (WMO) (2011) and Shindell et  al. (2012) identified 
measures targeting reduction in short-lived climate pollutant (SLCP) 
emissions that reduce projected global mean warming about 0.5°C 
by 2050. Bala et al. (2013) reported that a recent coupled modelling 
study showed nitrogen deposition and elevated CO2 could have 
a synergistic effect, which could explain 47% of terrestrial carbon 
uptake in the 1990s. Estimates of global terrestrial carbon uptake 
due to current nitrogen deposition ranges between 0.55 and 
1.28 GtCO2 yr–1 (De Vries et al. 2006, 2009; Bala et al. 2013; Zaehle 
and Dalmonech 2011) (Table 6.16).
There are no global data on the impacts of management of invasive 
species/encroachment on mitigation.
Coastal wetland restoration could provide high levels of climate 
mitigation, with avoided coastal wetland impacts and coastal 
wetland restoration estimated to deliver 0.3–3.1 GtCO2e yr–1 in total 
when considering all global estimates from Griscom et al. (2017), 
Hawken (2017), Pendleton et al. (2012), Howard et al. (2017) and 
Donato et al. (2011) (Table 6.16).
Peatland restoration could provide moderate levels of climate 
mitigation, with avoided peat impacts and peat restoration 
estimated to deliver 0.6–2 GtCO2e yr–1 from all global estimates 
published in Griscom et  al. (2017), Hawken (2017), Hooijer et  al. 
(2010), Couwenberg et  al. (2010) and Joosten and Couwenberg 
(2008), though there could be an increase in methane emissions after 
restoration (Jauhiainen et al. 2008) (Table 6.16).
Mitigation potential from biodiversity conservation varies depending 
on the type of intervention and specific context. Protected areas are 
estimated to store over 300 Gt carbon, roughly corresponding to 15% 
of terrestrial carbon stocks (Campbell et al. 2008; Kapos et al. 2008). 
At global level, the potential mitigation resulting from protection 
of these areas for the period 2005–2095 is, on average, about 
0.9 GtCO2-eq yr–1 relative to a reference scenario (Calvin et al. 2014). 
The potential effects on the carbon cycle of management of wild 
animal species are context dependent. For example, moose browsing 
in boreal forests can decrease the carbon uptake of ecosystems by up 
to 75% (Schmitz et al. 2018), and reducing moose density through 
active population management in Canada is estimated to be a carbon 
sink equivalent to about 0.37 GtCO2e yr–1 (Schmitz et al. 2014).

Integrated response options based on land management 
specifically for carbon dioxide removal (CDR)
Enhanced mineral weathering provides substantial climate 
mitigation, with a global mitigation potential in the region of about 
0.5–4 GtCO2e yr–1 (Beerling et al. 2018; Lenton 2010; Smith et al. 
2016a; Taylor et al. 2016) (Table 6.17).
The mitigation potential for bioenergy and BECCS derived from 
bottom-up models is large (IPCC 2018) (Chapter 2 and Cross-
Chapter Box 7 in this chapter), with technical potential estimated 
at 100–300  EJ yr–1 (Chum et  al. 2011; Cross-Chapter Box 7 in 
Chapter 6) or up to about 11 GtCO2 yr–1 (Chapter 2). These estimates, 
however, exclude N2O associated with fertiliser application and land-
use change emissions. Those effects are included in the modelled 
scenarios using bioenergy and BECCS, with the sign and magnitude 
depending on where the bioenergy is grown (Wise et al. 2015), at 
what scale, and whether nitrogen fertiliser is used.

Integrated response options based 
on value chain management
In this section, the impacts on climate change mitigation of integrated 
response options based on value chain management are assessed.
Integrated response options based on value chain  
management through demand management
Dietary change and waste reduction can provide large benefits 
for mitigation, with potentials of 0.7–8 GtCO2 yr–1 for both 
(Aleksandrowicz et al. 2016; Bajželj et al. 2014b; Dickie et al. 2014; 
Hawken 2017; Hedenus et al. 2014; Herrero et al. 2016; Popp et al. 
2010; Smith et al. 2013; Springmann et al. 2016; Stehfest et al. 2009; 
Tilman and Clark 2014). Estimates for food waste reduction (Bajželj 
et al. 2014b; Dickie et al. 2014; Hiç et al. 2016; Hawken 2017) include 
both consumer/retailed waste and post-harvest losses (Table 6.18). 
Some studies indicate that material substitution has the potential 
for significant mitigation, with one study estimating a 14–31% 
reduction in global CO2 emissions (Oliver et  al. 2014); other 
studies suggest more modest potential (Gustavsson et  al. 2006) 
(Table 6.18).

Integrated response options based on value chain 
management through supply management
While sustainable sourcing presumably delivers a mitigation benefit, 
there are no global estimates of potential. Palm oil production alone 
is estimated to contribute 0.038 to 0.045 GtC yr–1, and Indonesian 
palm oil expansion contributed up to 9% of tropical land-use change 
carbon emissions in the 2000s (Carlson and Curran 2013), however, 
the mitigation benefit of sustainable sourcing of palm oil has not 
been quantified. There are no estimates of the mitigation potential 
for urban food systems.
Efficient use of energy and resources in food transport and distribution 
contribute to a reduction in GHG emissions, estimated to be 1% 
of global CO2 emissions (James and James 2010; Vermeulen et al. 
2012b). Given that global CO2 emissions in 2017 were 37 GtCO2, this 
equates to 0.37 GtCO2 yr–1 (covering food transport and distribution, 
improved efficiency of food processing and retailing, and improved 
energy efficiency) (Table 6.19).

Integrated response options based 
on risk management
In this section, the impacts on climate change mitigation of integrated 
response options based on risk management are assessed. In general, 
because these options are focused on adaptation and other benefits, 
the mitigation benefits are modest, and mostly unquantified.
Extensive and less dense urban development tends to have higher 
energy usage, particularly from transport (Liu et al. 2015), such that 
a 10% reduction of very low-density urban fabrics is correlated with 
9% fewer emissions per capita in Europe (Baur et al. 2015). However, 
the exact contribution to mitigation from the prevention of land 
conversion in particular has not been well quantified (Thornbush 
et  al. 2013). Suggestions from select studies in the USA are that 
biomass decreases by half in cases of conversion from forest to 
urban land uses (Briber et al. 2015), and a study in Bangkok found 
a decline by half in carbon sinks in the urban area in the past 30 years 
(Ali et al. 2018).
There is no literature specifically on linkages between livelihood 
diversification and climate mitigation benefits, although some 
forms of diversification that include agroforestry would likely result 
in increased carbon sinks (Altieri et al. 2015; Descheemaeker et al. 
2016). There is no literature exploring linkages between local seeds 
and GHG emission reductions, although use of local seeds likely 
reduces emissions associated with transport for commercial seeds, 
though the impact has not been quantified.
While disaster risk management can presumably have mitigation co-
benefits, as it can help reduce food loss on-farm (e.g., crops destroyed 
before harvest or avoided animal deaths during droughts and floods 
meaning reduced production losses and wasted emissions), there is 
no quantified global estimate for this potential.
Risk-sharing instruments could have some mitigation co-benefits 
if they buffer household losses and reduce the need to expand 
agricultural lands after experiencing risks. However, the overall 
impacts of these are unknown. Further, commercial insurance may 
induce producers to bring additional land into crop production, 
particularly marginal or land with other risks that may be more 
environmentally sensitive (Claassen et al. 2011a). Policies to deny 
crop insurance to farmers who have converted grasslands in the 
USA resulted in a 9% drop in conversion, which likely has positive

mitigation impacts (Claassen et al. 2011a). Estimates of emissions 
from cropland conversion in the USA in 2016 were 23.8 MtCO2e, only 
some of which could be attributed to insurance as a driver.

Integrated response options 
based on land management
In this section, the impacts on climate change adaptation of integrated 
response options based on land management are assessed.
Integrated response options based on 
land management in agriculture
Increasing food productivity by practices such as sustainable 
intensification improves farm incomes and allows households to 
build assets for use in times of stress, thereby improving resilience 
(Campbell et al. 2014). By reducing pressure on land and increasing 
food production, increased food productivity could be beneficial for 
adaptation (Campbell et al. 2014) (Chapter 2 and Section 6.3). Pretty 
et  al. (2018) report that 163 million farms occupying 4.53 Mkm2 
have passed a redesign threshold for application of sustainable 
intensification, suggesting the minimum number of people 
benefitting from increased productivity and adaptation benefits 
under sustainable intensification is >163 million, with the total likely 
to be far higher (Table 6.21).
Improved cropland management is a key climate adaptation option, 
potentially affecting more than 25 million people, including a wide 
range of technological decisions by farmers. Actions towards 
adaptation fall into two broad overlapping areas: (i) accelerated 
adaptation to progressive climate change over decadal time scales, 
for example integrated packages of technology, agronomy and 
policy options for farmers and food systems, including changing 
planting dates and zones, tillage systems, crop types and varieties, 
and (ii)  better management of agricultural risks associated with 
increasing climate variability and extreme events, for example, 
improved climate information services and safety nets (Vermeulen 
et al. 2012b; Challinor et al. 2014; Lipper et al. 2014; Lobell 2014). 
In the same way, improved livestock management is another 
technological adaptation option potentially benefitting between 
1 million and 25 million people. Crop and animal diversification are 
considered the most promising adaptation measures (Porter et al. 
2014; Rojas-Downing et  al. 2017). In grasslands and rangelands, 
regulation of stocking rates, grazing field dimensions, establishment 
of exclosures and locations of drinking fountains and feeders are 
strategic decisions by farmers to improve grazing management 
(Taboada et al. 2011; Mekuria and Aynekulu 2013; Porter et al. 2014).
Around 30% of the world’s rural population use trees across 46% 
of all agricultural landscapes (Lasco et al. 2014), meaning that up 
to 2.3 billion people benefit from agroforestry globally (Table 6.21).
Agricultural diversification is key to achieving climatic resilience 
(Campbell et  al. 2014; Cohn et  al. 2017). Crop diversification is 
one important adaptation option to progressive climate change 
(Vermeulen et al. 2012a) and it can improve resilience by engendering 
a greater ability to suppress pest outbreaks and dampen pathogen 
transmission, as well as by buffering crop production from the effects 
of greater climate variability and extreme events (Lin 2011).
Reduced conversion of grassland to cropland may lead to adaptation 
benefits by stabilising soils in the face of extreme climatic events 
(Lal 2001), thereby increasing resilience, but since it would likely 
have a negative impact on food production/security (since croplands 
produce more food per unit area than grasslands), the wider 
adaptation impacts would likely be negative. However, there is no 
literature quantifying the global impact of avoidance of conversion 
of grassland to cropland on adaptation.
Integrated water management provides large co-benefits for 
adaptation (Dillon and Arshad 2016) by improving the resilience of 
food crop production systems to future climate change (Porter et al. 
2014) (Chapter 2 and Table 6.7). Improving irrigation systems and 
integrated water resource management, such as enhancing urban and 
rural water supplies and reducing water evaporation losses (Dillon and 
Arshad 2016), are significant options for enhancing climate adaptation. 
Many technical innovations (e.g., precision water management) can 
lead to beneficial adaptation outcomes by increasing water availability 
and the reliability of agricultural production, using different techniques 
of water harvesting, storage, and its judicious utilisation through

farm ponds, dams and community tanks in rainfed agriculture areas. 
Integrated water management response options that use freshwater 
would be expected to have few adverse side effects in regions where 
water is plentiful, but large adverse side effects in regions where water 
is scarce (Grey and Sadoff 2007; Liu et al. 2017; Scott et al. 2011).

Integrated response options based on land management in forestry
Forest management positively impacts on adaptation through limiting 
the negative effects associated with pollution (of air and fresh water), 
infections and other diseases, exposure to extreme weather events 
and natural disasters, and poverty (e.g., Smith et al. 2014). There is 
high agreement on the fact that reduced deforestation and forest 
degradation positively impact on adaptation and resilience of coupled 
human-natural systems. Based on the number of people affected by 
natural disasters (CRED 2015), the number of people depending to 
varying degrees on forests for their livelihoods (World Bank et al. 2009) 
and the current deforestation rate (Keenan et al. 2015), the estimated 
global potential effect for adaptation is largely positive for forest 
management, and moderately positive for reduced deforestation when 
cumulated until the end of the century (Table 6.22). The uncertainty of 
these global estimates is high, for example, the impact of reduced 
deforestation may be higher when the large biophysical impacts on 
the water cycle (and thus drought) from deforestation (e.g., Alkama 
and Cescatti 2016) are taken into account (Chapter 2).
More robust qualitative, and some quantitative, estimates are 
available at local and regional level. According to Karjalainen et al. 
(2009), reducing deforestation and habitat alteration contributes to 
limiting infectious diseases such as malaria in Africa, Asia and Latin 
America, thus lowering the expenses associated with healthcare 
treatments. Bhattacharjee and Behera (2017) found that human lives 
lost due to floods increase with reducing forest cover and increasing 
deforestation rates in India. In addition, maintaining forest cover in 
urban contexts reduces air pollution and therefore avoids mortality 
of about one person per year per city in US, and up to 7.6 people per 
year in New York City (Nowak et al. 2014). There is also evidence 
that reducing deforestation and forest degradation in mangrove 
plantations potentially improves soil stabilisation, and attenuates 
the impact of tropical cyclones and typhoons along the coastal areas 
in South and Southeast Asia (Chow 2018). At local scale, co-benefits 
between REDD+ and adaptation of local communities can potentially 
be substantial (Long 2013; Morita and Matsumoto 2018), even if 
often difficult to quantify, and not explicitly acknowledged (McElwee 
et al. 2017b).
Forest restoration may facilitate the adaptation and resilience of 
forests to climate change by enhancing connectivity between forest 
areas and conserving biodiversity hotspots (Locatelli et  al. 2011, 
2015b; Ellison et al. 2017; Dooley and Kartha 2018). Furthermore, 
forest restoration may improve ecosystem functionality and services, 
provide microclimatic regulation for people and crops, wood 
and fodder as safety nets, soil erosion protection and soil fertility 
enhancement for agricultural resilience, coastal area protection, 
water and flood regulation (Locatelli et al. 2015b). 
Afforestation and reforestation are important climate change 
adaptation response options (Reyer et al. 2009; Ellison et al. 2017; 
Locatelli et al. 2015b), and can potentially help a large proportion of 
the global population to adapt to climate change and to associated 
natural disasters (Table 6.22). For example, trees generally mitigate 
summer mean warming and temperature extremes (Findell et  al. 
2017; Sonntag et al. 2016).

response options, with confidence estimates based on the thresholds

Integrated response options based on land management of soils
Soil organic carbon increase is promoted as an action for climate change 
adaptation. Since increasing soil organic matter content is a measure 
to address land degradation (see Section 6.2.1), and restoring 
degraded land helps to improve resilience to climate change, soil 
carbon increase is an important option for climate change adaptation. 
With around 120,000 km2 lost to degradation every year, and over 
3.2 billion people negatively impacted by land degradation globally 
(IPBES 2018), practices designed to increase soil organic carbon have 
a large potential to address adaptation challenges (Table 6.23).
Since soil erosion control prevents land degradation and 
desertification, it improves the resilience of agriculture to climate 
change and increases food production (Lal 1998; IPBES 2018), 
though the global number of people benefitting from improved 
resilience to climate change has not been reported in the literature. 
Using figures from (FAO and ITPS 2015), IPBES (2018) estimates that 
land losses due to erosion are equivalent to 1.5 Mkm2 of land used 
for crop production to 2050, or 45,000 km2 yr–1 (Foley et al. 2011). 
Control of soil erosion (water and wind) could benefit 11 Mkm2 of 
degraded land (Lal 2014), and improve the resilience of at least some 
of the 3.2 billion people affected by land degradation (IPBES 2018), 
suggesting positive impacts on adaptation. Management of erosion 
is an important climate change adaptation measure, since it reduces 
the vulnerability of soils to loss under climate extremes, thereby 
increasing resilience to climate change (Garbrecht et al. 2015).
Prevention and/or reversion of topsoil salinisation may require 
a combined management of groundwater, irrigation techniques, 
drainage, mulching and vegetation, with all of these considered 
relevant for adaptation (Qadir et  al. 2013; UNCTAD 2011; Dagar 
et al. 2016). Taking into account the widespread diffusion of salinity 
problems, many people can benefit from its implementation by 
farmers. The relation between compaction prevention and/or 
reversion and climate adaption is less evident, and can be related to 
better hydrological soil functioning (Chamen et al. 2015; Epron et al. 
2016; Tullberg et al. 2018).
Biochar has the potential to benefit climate adaptation by improving 
the resilience of food crop production systems to future climate 
change by increasing yield in some regions and improving water 
holding capacity (Woolf et  al. 2010; Sohi 2012) (Chapter 2 and 
Section 6.4). By increasing yield by 25% in the tropics (Jeffery et al. 
2017), this could increase food production for 3.2 billion people 
affected by land degradation (IPBES 2018), thereby potentially 
improving their resilience to climate change shocks (Table 6.23). 
A  requirement for large areas of land to provide feedstock for 
biochar could adversely impact on adaptation, though this has not 
been quantified globally.

response options, with confidence estimates based on the thresholds

For fire management, Doerr et al. (2016) showed that the number of 
people killed by wildfire was 1940, and the total number of people 
affected was 5.8 million from 1984 to 2013, globally. Johnston et al. 
(2012) showed that the average mortality attributable to landscape 
fire smoke exposure was 339,000 deaths annually. The regions most 
affected were sub-Saharan Africa (157,000) and Southeast Asia 
(110,000). Estimated annual mortality during La Niña was 262,000, 
compared with around 100,000 excess deaths across Indonesia, 
Malaysia and Singapore (Table 6.24).
Management of landslides and natural hazards are usually listed 
among planned adaptation options in mountainous and sloped 
hilly areas, where uncontrolled runoff and avalanches may cause 
climatic disasters, affecting millions of people from both urban and 
rural areas. Landslide control requires increasing plant cover and 
engineering practices (see Table 6.8).
For management of pollution, including acidification, Anenberg 
et  al. (2012) estimated that, for particulate matter (PM2.5) and 
ozone, respectively, fully implementing reduction measures could 
reduce global population-weighted average surface concentrations 
by 23–34% and 7–17% and avoid 0.6–4.4 and 0.04–0.52 million 
annual premature deaths globally in 2030. UNEP and WMO (2011) 
considered emission control measures to reduce ozone and black 
carbon (BC) and estimated that 2.4 million annual premature 
deaths (with a range of 0.7 million to 4.6 million) from outdoor 
air pollution could be avoided. West et al. (2013) estimated global 
GHG mitigation brings co-benefits for air quality and would avoid 
0.5 ± 0.2, 1.3 ± 0.5, and 2.2 ± 0.8 million premature deaths in 
2030, 2050, and 2100, respectively.
There are no global data on the impacts of management of invasive 
species/encroachment on adaptation.

Coastal wetlands provide a natural defence against coastal flooding 
and storm surges by dissipating wave energy, reducing erosion, 
and by helping to stabilise shore sediments, so restoration may 
provide significant benefits for adaptation. The Ramsar Convention 
on Wetlands covers 1.5 Mkm2 across 1674 sites (Keddy et al. 2009). 
Coastal floods currently affect 93–310 million people (in 2010) 
globally, and this could rise to 600 million people in 2100 with sea 
level rise, unless adaptation measures are taken (Hinkel et al. 2014). 
The proportion of the flood-prone population that could avoid 
these impacts through restoration of coastal wetlands has not been 
quantified, but this sets an upper limit.
Avoided peat impacts and peatland restoration can help to 
regulate water flow and prevent downstream flooding (Munang 
et al. 2014), but the global potential (in terms of number of people 
who could avoid flooding through peatland restoration) has not 
been quantified.
There are no global estimates about the potential of biodiversity 
conservation to improve the adaptation and resilience of local 
communities to climate change, in terms of reducing the number 
of people affected by natural disasters. Nevertheless, it is widely 
recognised that biodiversity, ecosystem health and resilience improves 
the adaptation potential (Jones et al. 2012). For example, tree species 
mixture improves the resistance of stands to natural disturbances, such 
as drought, fires, and windstorms (Jactel et al. 2017), as well as stability 
against landslides (Kobayashi and Mori 2017). Moreover, protected 
areas play a key role for improving adaptation (Watson et al. 2014; 
Lopoukhine et al. 2012), through reducing water flow, stabilising rock 
movements, creating physical barriers to coastal erosion, improving 
resistance to fires, and buffering storm damages (Dudley et al. 2010). 
Of the largest urban areas worldwide, 33 out of 105 rely on protected 
areas for some, or all, of their drinking water (Secretariat of the 
Convention on Biological Diversity 2008), indicating that many millions 
are likely to benefit from conservation practices.

Integrated response options based on land 
management specifically for CDR
Enhanced weathering of minerals has been proposed as a mechanism 
for improving soil health and food security (Beerling et al. 2018), but 
there is no literature estimating the global adaptation benefits.
Large-scale bioenergy and BECCS can require substantial amounts 
of cropland (Popp et al. 2017; Calvin et al. 2014; Smith et al. 2016a), 
forestland (Baker et  al. 2019; Favero and Mendelsohn 2017), and 
water (Chaturvedi et al. 2013; Hejazi et al. 2015; Popp et al. 2011a; 
Smith et  al. 2016a; Fuss et  al. 2018); suggesting that bioenergy 
and BECCS could have adverse side effects for adaptation. In some 
contexts  – for example, low inputs of fossil fuels and chemicals, 
limited irrigation, heat/drought tolerant species, and using marginal 
land  – bioenergy can have co-benefits for adaptation (Dasgupta 
et al. 2014; Noble et al. 2014). However, no studies were found that 
quantify the magnitude of the effect.

In this section, the impacts on climate change adaptation of integrated

Integrated response options based on value chain  
management through demand management
Decreases in pressure on land and decreases in production intensity 
associated with sustainable healthy diets or reduced food waste 
could also benefit adaptation; however, the size of this effect is not 
well quantified (Muller et al. 2017). 
Reducing food waste losses can relieve pressure on the global 
freshwater resource, thereby aiding adaptation. Food losses account 
for 215 km3 yr–1 of freshwater resources, which Kummu et al. (2012) 
report to be about 12–15% of the global consumptive water use. 
Given that 35% of the global population is living under high water 
stress or shortage (Kummu et al. 2010), reducing food waste could 
benefit 320–400 million people (12–15% of the 2681 million people 
affected by water stress/shortage). 
While no studies report quantitative estimates of the effect of 
material substitution on adaptation, the effects are expected to be 
similar to reforestation and afforestation if the amount of material 
substitution leads to an increase in forest area. Additionally, some 
studies indicate that wooden buildings, if properly constructed, 
could reduce fire risk, compared to steel, which softens when burned 
(Gustavsson et al. 2006; Ramage et al. 2017).

agricultural businesses in developing countries (IFAD 2013), meaning 
that better promotion of value-added products and improved 
efficiency and sustainability of food processing and retailing could 
potentially help up to 500 million people to adapt to climate change. 
However, figures on how sustainable sourcing in general could help 
farmers and forest management is mostly unquantified. More than 
1 million farmers have currently been certified through various 
schemes (Tayleur et al. 2017), but how much this has helped them 
prepare for adaptation is unknown.
Management of supply chains has the potential to reduce vulnerability to 
price volatility. Consumers in lower-income countries are most affected 
by price volatility, with sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia at highest risk 
(Regmi and Meade 2013; Fujimori et al. 2019). However, understanding 
of the stability of food supply is one of the weakest links in global food 
system research (Wheeler and von Braun 2013) as instability is driven 
by a confluence of factors (Headey and Fan 2008). Food price spikes 
in 2007 increased the number of people below the poverty line by 
between 100 million people (Ivanic and Martin 2008) and 450 million 
people (Brinkman et al. 2009), and caused welfare losses of 3% or 
more for poor households in many countries (Zezza et al. 2009). Food 
price stabilisation by China, India and Indonesia alone in 2007/2008 
led to reduced staple food price for 2 billion people (Timmer 2009). 
Presumably, spending less on food frees up money for other activities, 
including adaptation, but it is unknown how much (Zezza et al. 2009; 
Ziervogel and Ericksen 2010). In one example, reduction in staple food 
price costs to consumers in Bangladesh from food stability policies saved 
rural households 887 million USD2003 total (Torlesse et al. 2003). Food 
supply stability through improved supply chains also potentially reduces 
conflicts (by avoiding food price riots, which occurred in countries with 
over 100 million total in population in 2007/2008), and thus increases 
adaptation capacity (Raleigh et al. 2015).
There are no global estimates of the contribution of improved food 
transport and distribution, or of urban food systems, in contributing 
to adaptation, but since the urban population in 2018 was 4.2 billion 
people, this sets the upper limit on those who could benefit.
Given that 65% (760 million) of working adults in poverty make 
a living through agriculture, increased energy efficiency in agriculture 
could benefit these 760 million people.

management options, with confidence estimates based on the

Integrated response options 
based on risk management
In this section, the impacts on climate change adaptation of integrated 
response options based on risk management are assessed.
Reducing urban sprawl is likely to provide adaptation co-benefits 
via improved human health (Frumkin 2002; Anderson 2017), as 
sprawl contributes to reduced physical activity, worse air pollution, 
and exacerbation of urban heat island effects and extreme heat 
waves (Stone et al. 2010). The most sprawling cities in the US have 
experienced extreme heat waves, more than double those of denser 
cities, and ‘urban albedo and vegetation enhancement strategies have 
significant potential to reduce heat-related health impacts’ (Stone 
et  al. 2010). Other adaption co-benefits are less well understood. 
There are likely to be cost savings from managing planning growth 
(one study found 2% savings in metropolitan budgets, which can 
then be spent on adaptation planning) (Deal and Schunk 2004).
Diversification is a major adaptation strategy and form of risk 
management, as it can help households smooth out income fluctuations 
and provide a broader range of options for the future (Osbahr et al. 2008; 
Adger et al. 2011; Thornton and Herrero 2014). Surveys of farmers in 
climate variable areas find that livelihood diversification is increasingly 
favoured as an adaptation option (Bryan et al. 2013), although it is not 
always successful, since it can increase exposure to climate variability 
(Adger et al. 2011). There are more than 570 million small farms in 
the world (Lowder et  al. 2016), and many millions of smallholder 
agriculturalists already practice livelihood diversification by engaging in 
multiple forms of off-farm income (Rigg 2006). It is not clear, however, 
how many farmers have not yet practiced diversification and thus how 
many would be helped by supporting this response option. 
Currently, millions of farmers still rely to some degree on local seeds. 
Use of local seeds can facilitate adaptation for many smallholders, 
as moving to use of commercial seeds can increase costs for farmers 
(Howard 2015). Seed networks and banks protect local agrobiodiversity 
and landraces, which are important to facilitate adaptation, as local 
landraces may be resilient to some forms of climate change (Coomes 
et al. 2015; Van Niekerk and Wynberg 2017; Vasconcelos et al. 2013).
Disaster risk management is an essential part of adaptation 
strategies. The Famine Early Warning Systems Network funded by 
the US Agency for International Development (USAID) has operated 
across three continents since the 1980s, and many millions of people 
across 34 countries have access to early information on drought. Such 
information can assist communities and households in adapting to 
onset conditions (Hillbruner and Moloney 2012). However, concerns 
have been raised as to how many people are actually reached by 
disaster risk management and early warning systems; for example, 
less than 50% of respondents in Bangladesh had heard a cyclone 
warning before it hit, even though an early warning system existed 
(Mahmud and Prowse 2012). Further, there are concerns that current 
early warning systems ‘tend to focus on response and recovery 
rather than on addressing livelihood issues as part of the process of 
reducing underlying risk factors,’ (Birkmann et al. 2015), leading to 
less adaptation potential being realised.
Local risk-sharing instruments like rotating credit or loan groups 
can help buffer farmers against climate impacts and help facilitate 
adaptation. Both index and commercial crop insurance offers some 
potential for adaptation, as it provides a means of buffering and 
transferring weather risk, saving farmers the cost of crop losses 
(Meze-Hausken et  al. 2009; Patt et  al. 2010). However, overly 
subsidised insurance can undermine the market’s role in pricing risks 
and thus depress more rapid adaptation strategies (Skees and Collier 
2012; Jaworski 2016) and increase the riskiness of decision-making 
(McLeman and Smit 2006). For example, availability of crop insurance 
was observed to reduce farm-level diversification in the US, a factor 
cited as increasing adaptive capacity (Sanderson et  al. 2013) and 
crop insurance-holding soybean farmers in the USA have been less 
likely to adapt to extreme weather events than those not holding 
insurance (Annan and Schlenker 2015). It is unclear how many 
people worldwide use insurance as an adaptation strategy; Platteau 
et al. (2017) suggest that less than 30% of smallholders take out any 
form of insurance, but it is likely in the millions.

options, with confidence estimates based on the thresholds outlined

Integrated response options 
based on land management
In this section, the impacts on desertification of integrated response 
options based on land management are assessed.
Integrated response options based  
on land management in agriculture
Burney et al. (2010) estimated that an additional global cropland area 
of 11.11–15.14 Mkm2 would have been needed if productivity had not 
increased between 1961 and 2000. Given that agricultural expansion 
is a main driver of desertification (FAO and ITPS 2015), increased 
food productivity could have prevented up to 11.11–15.14  Mkm2 
from exploitation and desertification (Table 6.10).
Improved cropland, livestock and grazing land management are 
strategic options aimed at prevention of desertification, and may 
include crop and animal selection, optimised stocking rates, changed 
tillage and/or cover crops, to land-use shifting from cropland 
to rangeland, in general targeting increases in ground cover by 
vegetation, and protection against wind erosion (Schwilch et al. 2014; 
Bestelmeyer et al. 2015). Considering the widespread distribution of 
deserts and desertified lands globally, more than 10 Mkm2 could 
benefit from improved management techniques.
Agroforestry can help stabilise soils to prevent desertification 
(Section 6.3.2.1), so given that there is around 10 Mkm2 of land with 
more than 10% tree cover (Garrity 2012), agroforestry could benefit 
up to 10 Mkm2 of land.
Agricultural diversification to prevent desertification may include the 
use of crops with manures, legumes, fodder legumes and cover crops 
combined with conservation tillage systems (Schwilch et al. 2014). 
These practices can be considered to be part of improved crop 
management options (see above) and aim at increasing ground 
coverage by vegetation and controlling wind erosion losses.
Since shifting from grassland to the annual cultivation of crops 
increases erosion and soil loss, there are significant benefits for 
desertification control, by stabilising soils in arid areas (Chapter 3). 
Cropland expansion during 1985 to 2005 was 359,000 km2, or 
17,400 km2 yr–1 (Foley et al. 2011). Not all of this expansion will 
be from grasslands or in desertified areas, but this value sets the 
maximum contribution of prevention of conversion of grasslands 
to croplands, a small global benefit for desertification control 
(Table 6.10).
Integrated water management strategies such as water-use efficiency 
and irrigation, improve soil health through increase in soil organic 
matter content, thereby delivering benefits for prevention or reversal 
of desertification (Baumhardt et al. 2015; Datta et al. 2000; Evans and 
Sadler 2008; He et al. 2015) (Chapter 3). Climate change will amplify 
existing stress on water availability and on agricultural systems, 
particularly in semi-arid environments (IPCC AR5 2014) (Chapter 3). In 
2011, semi-arid ecosystems in the southern hemisphere contributed 
51% of the global net carbon sink (Poulter et al. 2014). These results 
suggest that arid ecosystems could be an important global carbon 
sink, depending on soil water availability.

Integrated response options based on land management in forestry
Forests are important to help to stabilise land and regulate water 
and microclimate (Locatelli et  al. 2015b). Based on the extent 
of dry forest at risk of desertification (Núñez et al. 2010; Bastin 
et  al. 2017), the estimated global potential effect for avoided 
desertification is large for both forest management and for reduced 
deforestation and forest degradation when cumulated for at least 
20 years (Table 6.30). The uncertainty of these global estimates 
is high. More robust qualitative and some quantitative estimates 
are available at regional level. For example, it has been simulated 
that human activity (i.e., land management) contributed to 26% 
of the total land reverted from desertification in Northern China 
between 1981 and 2010 (Xu  et  al. 2018). In Thailand, it was 
found that the desertification risk is reduced when the land use 
is changed from bare lands to agricultural lands and forests, and

from non-forests to forests; conversely, the desertification risk 
increases when converting forests and denuded forests to bare 
lands (Wijitkosum 2016).
Afforestation, reforestation and forest restoration are land 
management response options that are used to prevent desertification. 
Forests tend to maintain water and soil quality by reducing runoff and 
trapping sediments and nutrients (Medugu et al. 2010; Salvati et al. 
2014), but planting of non-native species in semi-arid regions can 
deplete soil water resources if they have high evapotranspiration rates 
(Zeng et al. 2016; Yang et al. 2014). Afforestation and reforestation 
programmes can be deployed over large areas of the Earth, so can 
create synergies in areas prone to desertification. Global estimates of 
land potentially available for afforestation are up to 25.8 Mkm2 by the 
end of the century, depending on a variety of assumptions on socio-
economic developments and climate policies (Griscom et al. 2017; 
Kreidenweis et al. 2016; Popp et al. 2017). The higher end of this 
range is achieved under the assumption of a globally uniform reward 
for carbon uptake in the terrestrial biosphere, and it is halved by 
considering tropical and subtropical areas only to minimise albedo 
feedbacks (Kreidenweis et al. 2016). When safeguards are introduced 
(e.g., excluding existing cropland for food security, boreal areas, 
etc.), the area available declines to about 6.8 Mkm2 (95% confidence 
interval of 2.3 and 11.25 Mkm2), of which about 4.72 Mkm2 is in the 
tropics and 2.06 Mkm2 is in temperate regions (Griscom et al. 2017) 
(Table 6.30).

Integrated response options based on land management of soils
With more than 2.7 billion people affected globally by desertification 
(IPBES 2018), practices to increase soil organic carbon content 
are proposed as actions to address desertification, and could be 
applied to an estimated 11.37 Mkm2 of desertified soils (Lal 2001) 
(Table 6.31).
Control of soil erosion could have large benefits for desertification 
control. Using figures from FAO et al. (2015), IPBES (2018) estimated 
that land losses due to erosion to 2050 are equivalent to 1.5 Mkm2 of 
land from crop production, or 45,000 km2 yr–1 (Foley et al. 2011) so soil 
erosion control could benefit up to 1.50 Mkm2 of land in the coming 
decades. Lal (2001) estimated that desertification control (using soil 
erosion control as one intervention) could benefit 11.37 Mkm2 of 
desertified land globally (Table 6.10).
Oldeman et al. (1991) estimated that the global extent soil affected by 
salinisation is 0.77 Mkm2 yr–1, which sets the upper limit on the area that 
could benefit from measures to address soil salinisation (Table 6.31).
In degraded arid grasslands, shrublands and rangelands, desertification 
can be reversed by alleviation of soil compaction through installation 
of enclosures and removal of domestic livestock (Allington et al. 2010), 
but there are no global estimates of potential (Table 6.31).
Biochar could potentially deliver benefits in efforts to address 
desertification though improving water-holding capacity (Woolf et al. 
2010; Sohi 2012), but the global effect is not quantified.

Integrated response options based on land management 
across all/other ecosystems
For fire management, Arora and Melton (2018) estimated, using 
models and GFED4.1s0 data, that burned area over the 1997–2014 
period was 4.834–4.855 Mkm2 yr–1. Randerson et al. (2012) estimated 
small fires increased total burned area globally by 35% from 3.45 to 
4.64 Mkm2 yr–1 during the period 2001–2010. Tansey et al. (2004) 
estimated that over 3.5 Mkm2 yr–1 of burned areas were detected in 
the year 2000 (Table 6.32).
Although slope and slope aspect are predictive factors of 
desertification occurrence, the factors with the greatest influence are 
land cover factors, such as normalised difference vegetation index 
(NDVI) and rangeland classes (Djeddaoui et  al. 2017). Therefore, 
prevention of landslides and natural hazards exert indirect influence 
on the occurrence of desertification.
The global extent of chemical soil degradation (salinisation, pollution 
and acidification) is about 1.03 Mkm2 yr–1 (Oldeman et al. 1991), 
giving the maximum extent of land that could benefit from the 
management of pollution and acidification.
There are no global data on the impacts of management of invasive 
species/encroachment on desertification, though the impact is 
presumed to be positive. There are no studies examining the 
potential role of restoration and avoided conversion of coastal 
wetlands on desertification.
There are no impacts of peatland restoration for prevention of 
desertification, as peatlands occur in wet areas and deserts in arid 
areas, so they are not connected.
For management of pollution, including acidification, Oldeman et al. 
(1991) estimated the global extent of chemical soil degradation, 
with 0.77 Mkm2 yr–1 affected by salinisation, 0.21 Mkm2 yr–1 
affected by pollution, and 0.06 Mkm2 yr–1 affected by acidification 
(total:  1.03  Mkm2 yr–1), so this is the area that could potentially 
benefit from pollution management measures.
Biodiversity conservation measures can interact with desertification, 
but the literature contains no global estimates of potential.

Integrated response options based on land management  
specifically for carbon dioxide removal (CDR)
While spreading of crushed minerals onto land as part of enhanced 
weathering may provide soil/plant nutrients in nutrient-depleted 
soils (Beerling et al. 2018), there is no literature reporting on the 
potential global impacts of this in addressing desertification.
Large-scale production of bioenergy can require significant amounts 
of land (Smith et al. 2016a; Clarke et al. 2014; Popp et al. 2017), with 
as much as 15 Mkm2 in 2100 in 2°C scenarios (Popp et al. 2017), 
increasing pressures for desertification (Table 6.33).

Dietary change and waste reduction both result in decreased 
cropland and pasture extent (Bajželj et al. 2014a; Stehfest et al. 2009; 
Tilman and Clark 2014), reducing the pressure for desertification 
(Table 6.34).
Reduced post-harvest losses could spare 1.98 Mkm2 of cropland 
globally (Kummu et al. 2012). Not all of this land could be subject to 
desertification pressure, so this represents the maximum area that 
could be relieved from desertification pressure by reduction of post-
harvest losses. No studies were found linking material substitution 
to desertification.

Integrated response options based  
on risk management
In this section, the impacts on desertification of integrated response 
options based on risk management are assessed.
There are regional case studies of urban sprawl contributing to 
desertification in Mediterranean climates in particular (Barbero-
Sierra et al. 2013; Stellmes et al. 2013), but no global figures. 
Diversification may deliver some benefits for addressing desertification 
when it involves greater use of tree crops that may reduce the 
need for tillage (Antwi-Agyei et al. 2014). Many anti-desertification 
programmes call for diversification (Stringer et al. 2009), but there is 
little evidence on how many households had done so (Herrmann and 
Hutchinson 2005). There are no numbers for global impacts. 
The literature is unclear on whether the use of local seeds has any 
relationship to desertification, although some local seeds are more 
likely to adapt to arid climates and less likely to degrade land than 
commercially introduced varieties (Mousseau 2015). Some anti-
desertification programmes have also shown more success using 
local seed varieties (Bassoum and Ghiggi 2010; Nunes et al. 2016).
Some disaster risk management approaches can have impacts 
on reducing desertification, like the Global Drought Early Warning 
System (GDEWS) (currently in development), which will monitor 
precipitation, soil moisture, evapotranspiration, river flows, 
groundwater, agricultural productivity and natural ecosystem health. 
It may have some potential co-benefits to reduce desertification 
(Pozzi et al. 2013). However, there are no figures yet for how much 
land area will be covered by such early warning systems.

Risk-sharing instruments, such as pooling labour or credit, could help 
communities invest in anti-desertification actions, but evidence is 
missing. Commercial crop insurance is likely to deliver no co-benefits 
for prevention and reversal of desertification, as evidence suggests 
that subsidised insurance, in particular, can increase crop production 
in marginal lands. Crop insurance could have been responsible for 
shifting up to 0.9% of rangelands to cropland in the Upper Midwest 
of the USA (Claassen et al. 2011a).

Integrated response options based  
on land management in agriculture
Burney et  al. (2010) estimated that an additional global cropland 
area of 11.11–15.14 Mkm2 would have been needed if productivity 
had not increased between 1961 and 2000. As for desertification, 
given that agricultural expansion is a main driver of land degradation 
(FAO and ITPS 2015), increased food productivity has prevented up to 
11.11–15.14 Mkm2 from exploitation and land degradation (Table 6.37).
Land degradation can be addressed by the implementation of 
improved cropland, livestock and grazing land management 
practices, such as those outlined in the recently published Voluntary 
Guidelines for Sustainable Soil Management (FAO 2017b). Each one 
could potentially affect extensive surfaces, not less than 10 Mkm2. 
The guidelines include a list of practices aimed at minimising soil 
erosion, enhancing soil organic matter content, fostering soil nutrient 
balance and cycles, preventing, minimising and mitigating soil 
salinisation and alkalinisation, soil contamination, soil acidification, 
soil sealing, soil compaction, and improving soil water management. 
Land cover and land cover change are key factors and indicators 
of land degradation. In many drylands, land cover is threatened by 
overgrazing, so management of stocking rate and grazing can help to 
prevent the advance of land degradation (Smith et al. 2016a).
Agroforestry can help stabilise soils to prevent land degradation; so, 
given that there is around 10 Mkm2 of land with more than 10% tree 
cover (Garrity 2012), agroforestry could benefit up to 10 Mkm2 of land.
Agricultural diversification usually aims at increasing climate and 
food security resilience, such as under ‘climate smart agriculture’ 
approaches (Lipper et al. 2014). Both objectives are closely related to 
land degradation prevention, potentially affecting 1–5 Mkm2.
Shifting from grassland to tilled crops increases erosion and soil loss, 
so there are significant benefits for addressing land degradation, 
by stabilising degraded soils (Chapter 3). Since cropland expansion 
during 1985 to 2005 was 17,400 km2 yr–1 (Foley et al. 2011) – and 
not all of this expansion will be from grasslands or degraded land – 
the maximum contribution of prevention of conversion of grasslands 
to croplands is 17,400 km2 yr–1, a small global benefit for control of 
land degradation (Table 6.37).
Most land degradation processes that are sensitive to climate change 
pressures (e.g., erosion, decline in soil organic matter, salinisation, 
waterlogging, drying of wet ecosystems) can benefit from integrated 
water management. Integrated water management options include 
management to reduce aquifer and surface water depletion, and to 
prevent over-extraction, and provide direct co-benefits for prevention 
of land degradation. Land management practices implemented for 
climate change mitigation may also affect water resources. Globally, 
water erosion is estimated to result in the loss of 23–42 MtN and 
14.6–26.4 MtP annually (Pierzynski et  al. 2017). Forests influence 
the storage and flow of water in watersheds (Eisenbies et al. 2007) 
and are therefore important for regulating how climate change will 
impact on landscapes.
Table 6.37 summarises the impact on land degradation of options 
in agriculture, with confidence estimates based on the thresholds 
outlined in Table 6.53 in Section 6.3.6, and indicative (not exhaustive) 
references upon which the evidence in based.

Integrated response options based on land management in forestry
Based on the extent of forest exposed to degradation (Gibbs and 
Salmon 2015), the estimated global potential effect for reducing 
land degradation, for example, through reduced soil erosion (Borrelli 
et al. 2017), is large for both forest management and for reduced 
deforestation and forest degradation when cumulated for at least 
20 years (Table 6.38). The uncertainty of these global estimates is 
high. More robust qualitative, and some quantitative, estimates 
are available at regional level. For example, in Indonesia, Santika 
et  al. (2017) demonstrated that reduced deforestation (Sumatra 
and Kalimantan islands) contributed to significantly reduced 
land degradation.
Forest restoration is a key option to achieve the overarching 
frameworks to reduce land degradation at global scale, such as, for 
example, Zero Net Land Degradation (ZNLD; UNCCD 2012) and Land 
Degradation Neutrality (LDN), not only in drylands (Safriel 2017). 
Indeed, it has been estimated that more than 20 Mkm2 are suitable 
for forest and landscape restoration, of which 15 Mkm2 may be 
devoted to mixed plant mosaic restoration (UNCCD 2012). Moreover, 
the Bonn Challenge6 aims to restore 1.5 Mkm2 of deforested and 
degraded land by 2020, and 3.5 Mkm2 by 2030. Under a restoration 
and protection scenario (implementing restoration targets), Wolff 
et al. (2018) simulated that there will be a global increase in net tree 
cover of about 4 Mkm2 by 2050 (Table 6.38). At local level, Brazil’s 
Atlantic Restoration Pact aims to restore 0.15 Mkm2 of forest areas 
in 40 years (Melo et al. 2013). The Y Ikatu Xingu campaign (launched 
in 2004) aims to contain deforestation and forest degradation 
processes by reversing the liability of 3000 km2 in the Xingu Basin, 
Brazil (Durigan et al. 2013).
Afforestation and reforestation are land management options 
frequently used to address land degradation (see Section 6.3.3.1 for 
details, and Table 6.38).

Integrated response options based on land management of soils
Increasing soil organic matter content is a measure to address land 
degradation. With around 120,000 km2 lost to degradation every year, 
and over 3.2 billion people negatively impacted on by land degradation 
globally (IPBES 2018), practices designed to increase soil organic 
carbon have a large potential to address land degradation, estimated 
to affect more than 11 Mkm2 globally (Lal 2004) (Table 6.39).
Control of soil erosion could have large benefits for addressing land 
degradation. Soil erosion control could benefit up to 1.50 Mkm2 of 
land to 2050 (IPBES 2018). Lal (2004) suggested that interventions to 
prevent wind and water erosion (two of the four main interventions 
proposed to address land degradation), could restore 11 Mkm2 of 
degraded and desertified soils globally (Table 6.39).
Oldeman et al. (1991) estimated that the global extent soil affected 
by salinisation is 0.77 Mkm2 yr–1, which sets the upper limit on the 
area that could benefit from measures to address soil salinisation 
(Table  6.39). The global extent of chemical soil degradation 
(salinisation, pollution and acidification) is about 1.03 Mkm2 
(Oldeman et al. 1991) giving the maximum extent of land that could 
benefit from the management of pollution and acidification.

Biochar could provide moderate benefits for the prevention or reversal 
of land degradation, by improving water-holding capacity and nutrient-
use efficiency, managing heavy metal pollution, and other co-benefits 
(Sohi 2012), though the global effects are not quantified.

Integrated response options based on land  
management across all/other ecosystems
For fire management, details of estimates of the impact of wildfires 
(and thereby the potential impact of their suppression) are given in 
Section 6.3.3.1 (Table 6.40).
Management of landslides and natural hazards aims at controlling 
a severe land degradation process affecting sloped and hilly areas, 
many of them with poor rural inhabitants (FAO and ITPS 2015; Gariano 
and Guzzetti 2016), but the global potential has not been quantified. 
There are no global data on the impacts of management of invasive 
species/encroachment on land degradation, though the impact is 
presumed to be positive.
Since large areas of coastal wetlands are degraded, restoration could 
potentially deliver moderate benefits for addressing land degradation, 
with 0.29 Mkm2 globally considered feasible for restoration (Griscom 
et al. 2017) (Table 6.40).
Considering that large areas (0.46 Mkm2) of global peatlands are 
degraded and considered suitable for restoration (Griscom et  al. 
2017), peatland restoration could deliver moderate benefits for 
addressing land degradation (Table 6.40).
There are no global estimates of the effects of biodiversity 
conservation on reducing degraded lands. However, at local scale, 
biodiversity conservation programmes have been demonstrated 
to stimulate gain of forest cover across large areas over the last 
three decades (e.g., in China; Zhang et al. 2013). Management of 
wild animals can influence land degradation processes by grazing, 
trampling and compacting soil surfaces, thereby altering surface 
temperatures and chemical reactions affecting sediment and carbon 
retention (Cromsigt et al. 2018).

Integrated response options based on land management  
specifically for carbon dioxide removal (CDR)
While spreading of crushed minerals onto land as part of enhanced 
weathering can provide soil/plant nutrients in nutrient-depleted soils, 
increase soil organic carbon stocks and help to replenish eroded soil 
(Beerling et al. 2018), there is no literature on the global potential for 
addressing land degradation.
Large-scale production of bioenergy can require significant amounts of 
land (Smith et al. 2016a; Clarke et al. 2014; Popp et al. 2017) – as much 
as 15 Mkm2 in 2°C scenarios (Popp et al. 2017) – therefore increasing 
pressures for land conversion and land degradation (Table 6.13). 
However, bioenergy production can either increase (Robertson et al. 
2017b; Mello et al. 2014) or decrease (FAO 2011b; Lal 2014) soil organic 
matter, depending on where it is produced and how it is managed. 
These effects are not included in the quantification in Table 6.41.

Dietary change and waste reduction both result in decreased 
cropland and pasture extent (Bajželj et al. 2014a; Stehfest et al. 2009; 
Tilman and Clark 2014), reducing the pressure for land degradation 
(Table 6.15). Reduced post-harvest losses could spare 1.98 Mkm2 of 
cropland globally (Kummu et al. 2012) meaning that land degradation 
pressure could be relieved from this land area through reduction 
of post-harvest losses. The effects of material substitution on land 
degradation depend on management practice; some forms of logging 
can lead to increased land degradation (Chapter 4).

There are no global estimates of the impact on land degradation of 
enhanced urban food systems, improved food processing, retailing, 
or improved energy use in food systems.
There is evidence that sustainable sourcing could reduce land 
degradation, as the explicit goal of sustainable certification 
programmes is often to reduce deforestation or other unsustainable 
land uses. Over 4 Mkm2 of forests are certified for sustainable 
harvesting (PEFC and FSC 2018), although it is not clear if all these 
lands would be at risk of degradation without certification. While 
the food price instability of 2007/2008 increased financial investment 
in crop expansion (especially through so-called land grabbing), and 
thus better management of supply chains might have reduced this 
amount, no quantification of the total amount of land acquired, nor 
the possible impact of this crop expansion on degradation, has been 
recorded (McMichael and Schneider 2011; McMichael 2012).

Integrated response options  
based on risk management
In this section, the impacts on land degradation of integrated 
response options based on risk management are assessed.
Urban expansion has been identified as a major culprit in soil 
degradation in some countries; for example, urban expansion in China 
has now affected 0.2 Mkm2, or almost one-sixth of the cultivated land 
total, causing an annual grain yield loss of up to 10 Mt, or around 
5–6% of cropland production. Cropland production losses of 8–10% 
by 2030 are expected under model scenarios of urban expansion (Bren 
d’Amour et al. 2016). Pollution from urban development has included 
water and soil pollution from industry, and wastes and sewage, as well 
as acid deposition from increasing energy use in cities (Chen 2007), all 
resulting in major losses to Nature’s Contributions to People from urban 
conversion (Song and Deng 2015). Soil sealing from urban expansion is 
a major loss of soil productivity across many areas. The World Bank has 
estimated that new city dwellers in developing countries will require 
160–500  m2  per capita, converted from non-urban to urban land 
(Barbero-Sierra et al. 2013; Angel et al. 2005).
Degradation can be a driver leading to livelihood diversification 
(Batterbury 2001; Lestrelin and Giordano 2007). Diversification 
has the potential to deliver some reversal of land degradation, if 
diversification involves adding non-traditional crops or trees that 
may reduce the need for tillage (Antwi-Agyei et al. 2014). China’s 
Sloping Land Conversion Program has had livelihood diversification 
benefits and is said to have prevented degradation of 93,000 km2 of 
land (Liu et al. 2015). However, Warren (2002) provides conflicting 
evidence that more diverse-income households had increased 
degradation on their lands in Niger. Palacios et al. (2013) associate 
landscape fragmentation with increased livelihood diversification 
in Mexico.
Use of local seeds may play a role in addressing land degradation 
due to the likelihood of local seeds being less dependent on inputs 
such as chemical fertilisers or mechanical tillage; for example, in 
India, local legumes are retained in seed networks while commercial 
crops like sorghum and rice dominate food markets (Reisman 2017). 
However, there are no global figures.
Disaster Risk Management systems can have some positive impacts 
on prevention and reversal of land degradation, such as the Global 
Drought Early Warning System (Pozzi et al. 2013) (Section 6.3.3.3).
Risk-sharing instruments could have benefits for reduced degradation, 
but there are no global estimates. Commercial crop insurance is likely 
to deliver no co-benefits for prevention and reversal of degradation. 
One study found a 1% increase in farm receipts generated from 
subsidised farm programmes (including crop insurance and others) 
increased soil erosion by 0.3 t ha–1 (Goodwin and Smith 2003). 
Wright and Wimberly (2013) found a 5310 km2 decline in grasslands 
in the Upper Midwest of the USA during 2006–2010, due to crop 
conversion driven by higher prices and access to insurance.

Increased food productivity has fed many millions of people who would 
otherwise not have been fed. Erisman et  al. (2008) estimated that 
more than 3 billion people worldwide could not have been fed without 
increased food productivity arising from nitrogen fertilisation (Table 6.45).
Improved cropland management to achieve food security aims at 
closing yield gaps by increasing use efficiency of essential inputs such 
as water and nutrients. Large production increases (45–70% for most 
crops) are possible from closing yield gaps to 100% of attainable 
yield, by increasing fertiliser use and irrigation, but overuse of 
nutrients could cause adverse environmental impacts (Mueller et al. 
2012). This improvement can impact on 1000 million people.

Improved 
grazing 
land 
management 
includes 
grasslands, 
rangelands and shrublands, and all sites on which pastoralism is 
practiced. In general terms, continuous grazing may cause severe 
damage to topsoil quality, for example, through compaction. This 
damage may be reversed by short grazing-exclusion periods under 
rotational grazing systems (Greenwood and McKenzie 2001; Drewry 
2006; Taboada et  al. 2011). Due to the widespread diffusion of 
pastoralism, improved grassland management may potentially affect 
more than 1000 million people, many of them under subsistence 
agricultural systems.
Meat, milk, eggs and other animal products, including fish and other 
seafoods, will play an important role in achieving food security (Reynolds 
et al. 2015). Improved livestock management with different animal 
types and feeds may also impact on one million people (Herrero et al. 
2016). Ruminants are efficient converters of grass into human-edible 
energy, and protein and grassland-based food production can produce 
food with a comparable carbon footprint to mixed systems (O’Mara 
2012). However, in the future, livestock production will increasingly 
be affected by competition for natural resources, particularly land and 
water, competition between food and feed, and by the need to operate 
in a carbon-constrained economy (Thornton et al. 2009). 
Currently, more than 1.3 billion people are on degrading agricultural 
land, and the combined impacts of climate change and land degradation 
could reduce global food production by 10% by 2050. Since agroforestry 
could help to address land degradation, up to 1.3 billion people could 
benefit in terms of food security through agroforestry.
Agricultural diversification is not always economically viable; 
technological, biophysical, educational and cultural barriers may 
emerge that limit the adoption of more diverse farming systems by 
farmers (Section 6.4.1). Nevertheless, diversification could benefit 
1000 million people, many of them under subsistence agricultural 
systems (Birthal et al. 2015; Massawe et al. 2016; Waha et al. 2018).
Cropland expansion during 1985 to 2005 was 17,000 km2 yr–1 (Foley 
et al. 2005). Given that cropland productivity (global average of 250 kg 
protein ha–1 yr–1 for wheat; Clark and Tilman 2017) is greater than 
that of grassland (global average of about 10 kg protein ha–1 yr–1 for 
beef/mutton; Clark and Tilman 2017), prevention of this conversion 
to cropland would have led to a loss of about 0.4 Mt protein yr–1 
globally. Given an average protein consumption in developing 
countries of 25.5 kg protein yr–1 (equivalent to 70 g person–1 day–1; 
FAO 2018b; OECD and FAO 2018), this is equivalent to the protein 
consumption of 16.4 million people each year (Table 6.45).
Integrated water management provides direct benefits to food 
security by improving agricultural productivity (Chapter 5; Godfray 
and Garnett 2014; Tilman et al. 2011), thereby potentially impacting 
on the livelihood and well-being of more than 1000 million people 
(Campbell et al. 2016) affected by hunger and highly impacted on by 
climate change. Increasing water availability and reliable supply of 
water for agricultural production using different techniques of water 
harvesting, storage, and its judicious utilisation through farm ponds, 
dams and community tanks in rainfed agriculture areas have been 
presented by Rao et al. (2017a) and Rivera-Ferre et al. (2016).

Integrated response options based on land management in forestry
Forests play a major role in providing food to local communities 
(non-timber forest products, mushrooms, fodder, fruits, berries, etc.), 
and diversify daily diets directly or indirectly through improving 
productivity, hunting, diversifying tree-cropland-livestock systems, 
and grazing in forests. Based on the extent of forest contributing 
to food supply, considering the people undernourished (FAO 
et  al. 2013; Rowland et  al. 2017), and the annual deforestation 
rate (Keenan et  al. 2015), the global potential to enhance food 
security is moderate for forest management and small for reduced 
deforestation (Table 6.46). The uncertainty of these global estimates 
is high. More robust qualitative, and some quantitative, estimates 
are available at regional level. For example, managed natural forests, 
shifting cultivation and agroforestry systems are demonstrated to 
be crucial to food security and nutrition for hundreds of millions 
of people in rural landscapes worldwide (Sunderland et  al. 2013; 
Vira et  al. 2015). According to Erb  et  al. (2016), deforestation 
would not be needed to feed the global population by 2050, in 
terms of quantity and quality of food. At local level, Cerri et  al. 
(2018) suggested that reduced deforestation, along with integrated 
cropland-livestock management, would positively impact on more 
than 120 million people in the Cerrado, Brazil. In Sub-Saharan Africa, 
where population and food demand are projected to continue to rise 
substantially, reduced deforestation may have strong positive effects 
on food security (Doelman et al. 2018).

Afforestation and reforestation negatively impact on food security 
(Boysen et  al. 2017a; Frank et  al. 2017; Kreidenweis et  al. 2016). 
It is estimated that large-scale afforestation plans could cause 
increases in food prices of 80% by 2050 (Kreidenweis et al. 2016), 
and more general mitigation measures in the agriculture, forestry 
and other land-use (AFOLU) sector can translate into a rise in 
undernourishment of 80–300 million people (Frank et  al. 2017) 
(Table 6.16). For reforestation, the potential adverse side effects 
with food security are smaller than afforestation, because forest 
regrows on recently deforested areas, and its impact would be felt 
mainly through impeding possible expansion of agricultural areas. 
On a smaller scale, forested land also offers benefits in terms of 
food supply, especially when forest is established on degraded land, 
mangroves and other land that cannot be used for agriculture. For 
example, food from forests represents a safety net during times of 
food and income insecurity (Wunder et al. 2014) and wild harvested 
meat and freshwater fish provides 30–80% of protein intake for 
many rural communities (McIntyre et al. 2016; Nasi et al. 2011).

Integrated response options based on land management of soils
Increasing soil organic matter stocks can increase yield and improve 
yield stability (Lal 2006; Pan et al. 2009; Soussana et al. 2019), though 
this is not universally seen (Hijbeek et al. 2017), Lal (2006) concludes 
that crop yields can be increased by 20–70 kg ha–1, 10–50 kg ha–1 
and 30–300 kg ha–1 for wheat, rice and maize, respectively, for every 
1 tC ha–1 increase in soil organic carbon in the root zone. Increasing 
soil organic carbon by 1 tC ha–1 could increase food grain production 
in developing countries by 32 Mt yr–1 (Lal 2006). Frank et al. (2017) 
estimate that soil carbon sequestration could reduce calorie loss 
associated with agricultural mitigation measures by 65%, saving 
60–225 million people from undernourishment compared to 
a baseline without soil carbon sequestration (Table 6.47).
Lal (1998) estimated the risks of global annual loss of food production 
due to accelerated erosion to be as high as 190 Mt yr–1 of cereals, 
6 Mt yr–1 of soybean, 3 Mt yr–1 of pulses and 73 Mt yr–1 of roots 
and tubers. Considering only cereals, if we estimate per-capita annual 
grain consumption in developing countries to be 300 kg yr–1 (based 
on data included in FAO 2018b; FAO et al. 2018; Pradhan et al. 2013; 
World Bank 2018a), the loss of 190 Mt yr–1 of cereals is equivalent to 
that consumed by 633 million people, annually (Table 6.47).
Though there are biophysical barriers, such as access to appropriate 
water sources and limited productivity of salt-tolerant crops, 
prevention/reversal of soil salinisation could benefit 1–100 million 
people (Qadir et  al. 2013). Soil compaction affects crop yields, 
so prevention of compaction could also benefit an estimated 
1–100 million people globally (Anderson and Peters 2016).
Biochar on balance, could provide moderate benefits for food 
security by improving yields by 25% in the tropics, but with more 
limited impacts in temperate regions (Jeffery et al. 2017), or through 
improved water-holding capacity and nutrient-use efficiency (Sohi 
2012) (Chapter 5). These benefits could, however, be tempered 
by additional pressure on land if large quantities of biomass are 
required as feedstock for biochar production, thereby causing 
potential conflicts with food security (Smith 2016). Smith (2016) 
estimated that 0.4–2.6 Mkm2 of land would be required for biomass 
feedstock to deliver 2.57 GtCO2e  yr–1 of CO2 removal.  If biomass 
production occupied 2.6 Mkm2 of cropland, equivalent to around 
20% of the global cropland area, this could potentially have a large 
effect on food security, although Woolf et  al. (2010) argue that 
abandoned cropland could be used to supply biomass for biochar, 
thus avoiding competition with food production. Similarly, Woods 
et al. (2015) estimate that 5–9 Mkm2 of land is available for biomass 
production without compromising food security and biodiversity, 
considering marginal and degraded land and land released by 
pasture intensification (Table 6.47).
Table 6.47 summarises the impact on food security of soil-based 
options, with confidence estimates based on the thresholds outlined 
in Table 6.53 in Section 6.3.6, and indicative (not exhaustive) 
references upon which the evidence in based.

management across all/other ecosystems
FAO (2015) calculated that damage from forest fires between 2003 
and 2013 impacted on a total of 49,000 km2 of crops, with the vast 
majority in Latin America. Based on the world cereal yield in 2013 
reported by Word Bank (2018b) (3.8 t ha–1), the loss of 49,000 km2 of 
crops is equivalent to 18.6 Mt yr–1 of cereals lost. Assuming annual 
grain consumption per capita to be 300 kg yr–1 (estimated, based on 
data included in FAO 2018b; FAO et al. 2018; Pradhan et al. 2013; 
World Bank 2018a), the loss of 18.6 Mt yr–1 would remove cereal 
crops equivalent to that consumed by 62 million people (Table 6.48).
Landslides and other natural hazards affect 1–100 million people 
globally, so preventing them could provide food security benefits to 
these people.
In terms of measures to tackle pollution, including acidification, 
Shindell et al. (2012) considered about 400 emission control measures 
to reduce ozone and black carbon (BC). This strategy increases 
annual crop yields by 30–135 Mt due to ozone reductions in 2030 
and beyond. If annual grain consumption per capita is assumed as 
300 kg yr–1 (estimated based on data included in FAO 2018b; FAO 
et  al. 2018; Pradhan et  al. 2013; World Bank 2018a), increase in 
annual crop yields by 30–135 Mt would feed 100–450 million people.
There are no global data on the impacts of management of invasive 
species/encroachment on food security.
Since large areas of converted coastal wetlands are used for food 
production (e.g., mangroves converted for aquaculture; Naylor et al. 
2000), restoration of coastal wetlands could displace food production 
and damage local food supply, potentially leading to adverse impacts 
on food security. However, these effects are likely to be very small, 
given that only 0.3% of human food comes from the oceans and 
other aquatic ecosystems (Pimentel 2006), and that the impacts 
could be offset by careful management, such as the careful siting of 
ponds within mangroves (Naylor et al. 2000) (Table 6.46).
Around 14–20% (0.56–0.80 Mkm2) of the global 4 Mkm2 of 
peatlands are used for agriculture, mostly for meadows and pasture, 
meaning that, if all of these peatlands were removed from production, 
0.56–0.80 Mkm2 of agricultural land would be lost.  Assuming livestock 
production on this land (since it is mostly meadow and pasture) with 
a mean productivity of 9.8 kg protein  ha–1  yr–1 (calculated from 
land footprint of beef/mutton (Clark and Tilman 2017), and average 
protein consumption in developing countries of 25.5 kg protein yr–1 
(equivalent to 70 g per person per day; (FAO 2018b; OECD and FAO 
2018)), this would be equivalent to 21–31 million people no longer 
fed from this land (Table 6.46)).
There are no global estimates on how biodiversity conservation 
improves nutrition (i.e., the number of nourished people). Biodiversity, 
and its management, is crucial for improving sustainable and 
diversified diets (Global Panel on Agriculture and Food Systems for 
Nutrition 2016). Indirectly, the loss of pollinators (due to combined 
causes, including the loss of habitats and flowering species) would 
contribute to 1.42 million additional deaths per year from non-
communicable and malnutrition-related diseases, and 27.0 million 
lost disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) per year (Smith et al. 2015). 
However, at the same time, some options to preserve biodiversity, 
like protected areas, may potentially conflict with food production by 
local communities (Molotoks et al. 2017).

Integrated response options based on land  
management specifically for CDR
The spreading of crushed minerals on land as part of enhanced 
weathering on nutrient-depleted soils can potentially increase crop 
yield by replenishing plant available silicon, potassium and other 
plant nutrients (Beerling et al. 2018), but there are no estimates in 
the literature reporting the potential magnitude of this effect on 
global food production.
Competition for land between bioenergy and food crops can lead 
to adverse side effects for food security. Many studies indicate that 
bioenergy could increase food prices (Calvin et al. 2014; Popp et al. 
2017; Wise et  al. 2009). Only three studies were found linking 
bioenergy to the population at risk of hunger; they estimate an 
increase in the population at risk of hunger of between 2 million and 
150 million people (Table 6.49).

Dietary change can free up agricultural land for additional production 
(Bajželj et al. 2014a; Stehfest et al. 2009; Tilman and Clark 2014) 
and reduce the risk of some diseases (Tilman and Clark 2014; 
Aleksandrowicz et  al. 2016), with large positive impacts on food 
security (Table 6.50). 
Kummu et al. (2012) estimate that an additional billion people could 
be fed if food waste was halved globally. This includes both post-
harvest losses and retail and consumer waste. Measures such as 
improved food transport and distribution could also contribute to this 
waste reduction (Table 6.50).
While no studies quantified the effect of material substitution on 
food security, the effects are expected to be similar to reforestation 
and afforestation if the amount of material substitution leads to an 
increase in forest area.

Integrated response options based on value chain  
management through supply management
Since 810 million people are undernourished (FAO 2018b), this 
sets the maximum number of those who could potentially benefit 
from sustainable sourcing or better management of supply chains. 
Currently, however, only 1 million people are estimated to benefit 
from sustainable sourcing (Tayleur et  al. 2017). For the others, 
food price spikes affect food security and health; there are clearly 
documented effects of stunting among young children as a result 
of the 2007/2008 food supply crisis (de Brauw 2011; Arndt et al. 
2016; Brinkman et  al. 2009; Darnton-Hill and Cogill 2010) with 
a 10% increase in wasting attributed to the crisis in South Asia 
(Vellakkal et al. 2015). There is conflicting evidence on the impacts 
of different food price stability options for supply chains, and 
little quantification (Byerlee et  al. 2006; del Ninno et  al. 2007; 
Alderman 2010; Braun et al. 2014). Reduction in staple food prices 
due to price stabilisation resulted in more expenditure on other 
foods and increased nutrition (e.g., oils, animal products), leading 
to a 10% reduction in malnutrition among children in one study 
(Torlesse et al. 2003). Comparison of two African countries shows that 
protectionist policies (food price controls) and safety nets to reduce 
price instability resulted in a 20% decrease in risk of malnutrition 
(Nandy et al. 2016). Models using policies for food aid and domestic 
food reserves to achieve food supply and price stability showed the 
most effectiveness of all options in achieving climate mitigation and

food security goals (e.g., more effective than carbon taxes) as they 
did not exacerbate food insecurity and did not reduce ambitions for 
achieving temperature goals (Fujimori et al. 2019).
For urban food systems, increased food production in cities, combined 
with governance systems for distribution and access can improve 
food security, with a potential to produce 30% of food consumed in 
cities. The urban population in 2018 was 4.2 billion people, so 30% 
represents 1230 million people who could benefit in terms of food 
security from improved urban food systems (Table 6.51).
It is estimated that 500 million smallholder farmers depend on 
agricultural businesses in developing countries (World Bank 2017), 
which sets the maximum number of people who could benefit from 
improved efficiency and sustainability of food processing, retail and 
agri-food industries.
Up to 2500 million people could benefit from increased energy 
efficiency in agriculture, based on the estimated number of people 
worldwide lacking access to clean energy and instead relying on 
biomass fuels for their household energy needs (IEA 2014).

Integrated response options based on risk management
In this section, the impacts on food security of integrated response 
options based on risk management are assessed.
Evidence in the USA indicates ambiguous trends between sprawl and 
food security: on the one hand, most urban expansion in the USA has 
primarily been on lands of low and moderate soil productivity with 
only 6% of total urban land on highly productive soil; on the other 
hand, highly productive soils have experienced the highest rate of 
conversion of any soil type (Nizeyimana et al. 2001). Specific types 
of agriculture are often practiced in urban-influenced fringes, such 
as fruits, vegetables, and poultry and eggs in the USA, the loss of 
which can have an impact on the types of nutritious foods available 
in urban areas (Francis et al. 2012). China is also concerned with food 
security implications of urban sprawl, and a loss of 30 Mt of grain 
production from 1998 to 2003 in eastern China was attributed to 
urbanisation (Chen 2007). However, overall global quantification has 
not been attempted. 
Diversification is associated with increased welfare and incomes 
and decreased levels of poverty in several country studies (Arslan 
et al. 2018; Asfaw et al. 2018). These are likely to have large food 
security benefits (Barrett et al. 2001; Niehof 2004), but there is little 
global quantification. 
Local seed use can provide considerable benefits for food security 
because of the increased ability of farmers to revive and strengthen 
local food systems (McMichael and Schneider 2011); studies have 
reported more diverse and healthy food in areas with strong food 
sovereignty networks (Coomes et  al. 2015; Bisht et  al. 2018). 
Women, in particular, may benefit from seed banks for low-value 
but nutritious crops (Patnaik et al. 2017). Many hundreds of millions 
of smallholders still rely on local seeds and they provide for many 
hundreds of millions of consumers (Altieri et al. 2012; McGuire and 
Sperling 2016). Therefore, keeping their ability to do so through seed 
sovereignty is important. However, there may be lower food yields 
from local and unimproved seeds, so the overall impact of local seed 
use on food security is ambiguous (McGuire and Sperling 2016).
Disaster risk management approaches can have important impacts 
on reducing food insecurity, and current warning systems for drought 
and storms currently reach over 100 million people. When these 
early warning systems can help farmers harvest crops in advance of 
impending weather events, or otherwise make agricultural decisions 
to prepare for adverse events, there are likely to be positive impacts 
on food security (Fakhruddin et  al. 2015). Surveys with farmers 
reporting food insecurity from climate impacts have indicated their 
strong interest in having such early warning systems (Shisanya and 
Mafongoya 2016). Additionally, famine early warning systems have 
been successful in Sahelian Africa to alert authorities of impending 
food shortages so that food acquisition and transportation from 
outside the region can begin, potentially helping millions of people 
(Genesio et al. 2011; Hillbruner and Moloney 2012).
Risk-sharing instruments are often aimed at sharing food supplies and 
reducing risk, and thus are likely to have important, but unquantified, 
benefits for food security. Crop insurance, in particular, has generally 
led to (modest) expansions in cultivated land area and increased 
food production (Claassen et al. 2011a; Goodwin et al. 2004).
Table 6.52 summarises the impact on food security of risk 
management options, with confidence estimates based on the 
thresholds outlined in Table 6.53 in Section 6.3.6, and indicative (not 
exhaustive) references upon which the evidence in based.

Note: 1) The response options often overlap, so are not additive. For example, increasing food productivity will involve changes to cropland, grazing land and livestock 
management, which in turn may include increasing soil carbon stocks. Therefore, the response options cannot be summed or regarded as entirely mutually exclusive 
interventions. 2) The efficacy of a response option for addressing the primary challenge for which it is implemented needs to be weighed against any co-benefits and 
adverse side effects for the other challenges. For example, if a response option has a major impact in addressing one challenge but results in relatively minor and 
manageable adverse side effects for another challenge, it may remain a powerful response option despite the adverse side effects, particularly if they can be minimised or 
managed. 3) Though the impacts of integrated response options have been quantified as far as possible in Section 6.3, there is no equivalence implied in terms of benefits 
or adverse side effects, either in number or in magnitude of the impact – that is, one benefit does not equal one adverse side effect. As a consequence (i) large benefits for 
one challenge might outweigh relatively minor adverse side effects in addressing another challenge, and (ii) some response options may deliver mostly benefits with few 
adverse side effects, but the benefits might be small in magnitude, that is, the response options do no harm, but present only minor co-benefits. A number of benefits and 
adverse side effects are context specific; the context specificity has been discussed in Section 6.2 and is further examined Section 6.4.5.1.

Summarising the potential of the integrated 
response options across mitigation, adaptation, 
desertification land degradation and food security 
Using the quantification provided in Tables 6.13 to 6.52, the impacts 
are categorised as either positive or negative, and are designated as 
large, moderate and small, according to the criteria given in Table 6.53.7

Note: All numbers are for global scale; all values are for technical potential. For mitigation, the target is set at around the level of large single mitigation measure 
(about 1 GtC yr–1 = 3.67 GtCO2-eq yr–1) (Pacala and Socolow 2004), with a combined target to meet 100 GtCO2 in 2100, to go from baseline to 2˚C (Clarke et al. 2014). For 
adaptation, numbers are set relative to the about 5 million lives lost per year attributable to climate change and a carbon-based economy, with 0.4 million per year attributable 
directly to climate change. This amounts to 100 million lives predicted to be lost between 2010 and 2030 due to climate change and a carbon-based economy (DARA 2012), 
with the largest category representing 25% of this total. For desertification and land degradation, categories are set relative to the 10–60 million km2 of currently degraded 
land (Gibbs and Salmon 2015) with the largest category representing 30% of the lower estimate. For food security, categories are set relative to the roughly 800 million people 
currently undernourished (HLPE 2017) with the largest category representing around 12.5% of this total.
Tables 6.54 to 6.61 summarise the potentials of the integrated 
response options across mitigation, adaptation, desertification, land 
degradation and food security. Cell colours correspond to the large, 
moderate and small impact categories shown in Table 6.53.
As seen in Tables 6.54 to 6.61, three response options across the 14 
for which there are data for every land challenge: increased food 
productivity, agroforestry and increased soil organic carbon content, 
deliver large benefits across all five land challenges.
A further six response options: improved cropland management, 
improved grazing land management, improved livestock management, 
agroforestry, fire management and reduced post-harvest losses, 
deliver either large or moderate benefits for all land challenges. 
Three additional response options: dietary change, reduced food 
waste and reduced soil salinisation, each missing data to assess global 
potential for just one of the land challenges, deliver large or moderate 
benefits to the four challenges for which there are global data.

Eight response options: increased food productivity, reforestation 
and forest restoration, afforestation, increased soil organic 
carbon content, enhanced mineral weathering, dietary change, 
reduced post-harvest losses, and reduced food waste, have large 
mitigation potential (>3 GtCO2e yr–1) without adverse impacts on 
other challenges.
Sixteen response options: increased food productivity, improved 
cropland management, agroforestry, agricultural diversification, 
forest management, increased soil organic carbon content, reduced 
landslides and natural hazards, restoration and reduced conversion 
of coastal wetlands, reduced post-harvest losses, sustainable 
sourcing, management of supply chains, improved food processing 
and retailing, improved energy use in food systems, livelihood 
diversification, use of local seeds, and disaster risk management, 
have large adaptation potential at global scale (positively affecting 
more than 25 million people) without adverse side effects for 
other challenges.
Thirty-three of the 40 response options can be applied without 
requiring land-use change and limiting available land. A large 
number of response options do not require dedicated land, including 
several land management options, all value chain options, and all 
risk management options. Four options, in particular, could greatly 
increase competition for land if applied at scale: afforestation, 
reforestation, and land used to provide feedstock for bioenergy 
(with or without BECCS) and biochar, with three further options: 
reduced grassland conversion to croplands, restoration and reduced 
conversion of peatlands, and restoration and reduced conversion of 
coastal wetlands having smaller or variable impacts on competition 
for land. Other options such as reduced deforestation and forest 
degradation, restrict land conversion for other options and uses.
Some response options can be more effective when applied 
together – for example, dietary change and waste reduction expand 
the potential to apply other options by freeing as much as 25 Mkm2 
(4–25 Mkm2 for dietary change; Alexander et al. 2016; Bajželj et al. 
2014b; Stehfest et al. 2009; Tilman and Clark 2014 and 7 Mkm2 for 
reduced food waste; Bajželj et al. 2014b).
In terms of the categories of response options, most agricultural land 
management response options (all except for reduced grassland 
conversion to cropland which potentially adversely affects food 
security), deliver benefits across the five land challenges (Table 6.54). 
Among the forest land management options, afforestation and 
reforestation have the potential to deliver large co-benefits across all 
land challenges except for food security, where these options provide 
a threat due to competition for land (Table 6.55). Among the soil-based 
response options, some global data are missing, but none except 
biochar shows any potential for negative impacts, with that potential 
negative impact arising from additional pressure on land if large 
quantities of biomass feedstock are required for biochar production 
(Table 6.56). Where global data exists, most response options in 
other/all ecosystems deliver benefits, except for a potential moderate 
negative impact on food security by restoring peatlands currently used 
for agriculture (Table 6.57). Of the two response options specifically 
targeted at CDR, there are missing data for enhanced weathering of 
minerals for three of the challenges, but large-scale bioenergy and 
BECCS show a potential large benefit for mitigation, but small to large 
adverse impacts on the other four land challenges (Table 6.58), mainly 
driven by increased pressure on land due to feedstock demand.
While data allow the impact of material substitution to be assessed 
only for mitigation, the three other demand-side response options: 
dietary change, reduced post-harvest losses, and reduced food waste 
provide large or moderate benefits across all challenges for which 
data exist (Table 6.59). Data is not available for any of the supply-
side response options to assess the impact on more than three of the 
land challenges, but there are large to moderate benefits for all those 
for which data are available (Table 6.60). Data are not available to 
assess the impact of risk-management-based response options on all 
of the challenges, but there are small to large benefits for all of those 
for which data are available (Table 6.61).

Increased food 
productivity
These estimates assume that increased food production is implemented sustainably (e.g., through sustainable 
intensification: Garnett et al. 2013; Pretty et al. 2018) rather than through increasing external inputs, which can have 
a range of negative impacts. Mitigation: Large benefits (Table 6.13). Adaptation: Large benefits (Campbell et al. 2014) 
(Chapter 2 and Table 6.21). Desertification: Large benefits (Dai 20100 (Chapter 3 and Table 6.29). Land degradation: 
Large benefits (Clay et al. 1995) (Chapter 4 and Table 6.37). Food security: Large benefits (Godfray et al. 2010; 
Godfray and Garnett 2014; Tilman et al. 2011) (Chapter 5 and Table 6.45). 
Improved cropland 
management
Mitigation: Moderate benefits by reducing GHG emissions and creating soil carbon sinks (Smith et al. 2008, 2014) (Chapter 2 
and Table 6.13). Adaptation: Large benefits by improving the resilience of food crop production systems to future climate 
change (Porter et al. 2014) (Chapter 2 and Table 6.21). Desertification: Large benefits by improving sustainable use of land 
in dry areas (Bryan et al. 2009; Chen et al. 2010) (Chapter 3 and Table 6.29). Land degradation: Large benefits by forming 
a major component of sustainable land management (Labrière et al. 2015) (Chapter 4 and Table 6.37). Food security: Large 
benefits by improving agricultural productivity for food production (Porter et al. 2014) (Chapter 5 and Table 6.45).
Improved grazing 
land management
Mitigation: Moderate benefits by increasing soil carbon sinks and reducing GHG emissions (Herrero et al. 2016) (Chapter 2 
and Table 6.13). Adaptation: Moderate benefits by improving the resilience of grazing lands to future climate change 
(Porter et al. 2014) (Chapter 2 and Table 6.21). Desertification: Moderate benefits by tackling overgrazing in dry areas 
to reduce desertification (Archer et al. 2011) (Chapter 3 and Table 6.29). Land degradation: Large benefits by optimising 
stocking density to reduce land degradation (Tighe et al. 2012) (Chapter 4, Table 6.37 and Table 6.45). Food security: Large 
benefits by improving livestock sector productivity to increase food production (Herrero et al. 2016) (Chapter 5 and Table 6.45).
Improved livestock 
management
Mitigation: Moderate benefits by reducing GHG emissions, particularly from enteric methane and manure management 
(Smith et al. 2008, 2014) (Chapter 2 and Table 6.13). Adaptation: Moderate benefits by improving resilience of livestock 
production systems to climate change (Porter et al. 2014) (Chapter 2 and Table 6.21). Desertification: Moderate benefits 
by tackling overgrazing in dry areas (Archer et al. 2011) (Chapter 3 and Table 6.29). Land degradation: Large benefits 
by reducing overstocking which can reduce land degradation (Tighe et al. 2012) (Chapter 4, Table 6.37 and Table 6.45). 
Food security: Large benefits by improving livestock sector productivity to increase food production (Herrero et al. 2016) 
(Chapter 5 and Table 6.45).
Agroforestry
Mitigation: Large benefits by increasing carbon sinks in vegetation and soils (Delgado 2010; Mbow et al. 2014a; 
Griscom et al. 2017) (Chapter 2 and Table 6.13). Adaptation: Large benefits by improving the resilience of agricultural 
lands to climate change (Mbow et al. 2014a) (Chapter 2 and Table 6.21). Desertification: Large benefits through, 
for example, providing perennial vegetation in dry areas (Nair et al. 2010; Lal 2001) (Chapter 3 and Table 6.29). 
Land degradation: Large benefits by stabilising soils through perennial vegetation (Narain et al. 1997; Lal 2001) 
(Chapter 4 and Table 6.37). Food production: Large benefits since well-planned agroforestry can enhance productivity 
(Bustamante et al. 2014; Sascha et al. 2017) (Chapter 5 and Table 6.45). 
Agricultural 
diversification
Agricultural diversification is a collection of practices aimed at deriving more crops or products per unit of area 
(e.g., intercropping) or unit of time (e.g., double cropping, ratoon crops, etc.). Mitigation: Limited benefits (Table 6.13). 
Adaptation: Large benefits through improved household income (Pellegrini and Tasciotti 2014) (Table 6.21). 
Desertification: Moderate benefits, limited by global dryland cropped area (Table 6.29). Land degradation: Large benefits 
by reducing pressure on land (Lambin and Meyfroidt 2011) (Table 6.37). Food security: Large benefits for food security by 
provision of more diverse foods (Birthal et al. 2015; Massawe et al. 2016; Waha et al. 2018) (Chapter 5 and Table 6.45).
Reduced grassland 
conversion to 
cropland
ND
Mitigation: Moderate benefits by retaining soil carbon stocks that might otherwise be lost. Historical losses of soil 
carbon have been in the order of 500 GtCO2 (Sanderman et al. 2017) (Table 6.13). Mean annual global cropland conver-
sion rates (1961–2003) have been 0.36% per year (Krause et al. 2017), that is, around 47,000 km2 yr–1 – so preventing 
conversion could potentially save moderate emissions of CO2. Adaptation: No literature (Table 6.21). Desertification: 
Limited benefits by shifting from annual crops to permanent vegetation cover under grass in dry areas (Table 6.29) 
(Chapter 3). Land degradation: Limited benefits by shifting from annual crops to permanent vegetation cover under 
grass (Chapter 4 and Table 6.37). Food security: Moderate negative impacts, since more land is required to produce 
human food from livestock products on grassland than from crops on cropland, meaning that a shift to grassland could 
reduce total productivity and threaten food security (Clark and Tilman 2017) (Chapter 5 and Table 6.45).
Integrated water 
management
 
 
 
 
 
Mitigation: Moderate benefits by reducing GHG emissions mainly in cropland and rice cultivation (Smith et al. 2008, 2014) 
(Chapter 2 and Table 6.13). Adaptation: Large benefits by improving the resilience of food crop production systems to 
future climate change (Porter et al. 2014) (Chapter 2 and Table 6.21). Desertification: Limited benefits by improving sus-
tainable use of land in dry areas (Chapter 3 and Table 6.29). Land degradation: Limited benefits by forming a major com-
ponent of sustainable land and water management (Chapter 4 and Table 6.37). Food security: Large benefits by improving 
agricultural productivity for food production (Godfray and Garnett 2014; Tilman et al. 2011) (Chapter 5 and Table 6.45).

Forest management
Mitigation: Moderate benefits by conserving and enhancing carbon stocks in forests and long-lived products, through, 
for example, selective logging (Smith et al. 2014) (Table 6.14). Adaptation: Large benefits, including through improving 
ecosystem functionality and services, with mostly qualitative evidence at global scale and more robust estimates at 
regional level and local scale (Locatelli et al. 2015b) (Table 6.22). Desertification and land degradation: Large 
benefits by helping to stabilise land and regulate water and microclimate (Locatelli et al. 2015b) (Chapters 3 and 4, 
and Tables 6.30 and 6.38). Food security: Moderate benefits with mostly qualitative estimate at global level, 
by providing food to local communities, and diversify daily diets (Chapter 5 and Table 6.46).
Reduced 
deforestation and 
forest degradation
Mitigation: Large benefits by maintaining carbon stocks in forest ecosystems (Chapter 2 and Table 6.14). Adaptation: 
Moderate benefits at global scale when effect is cumulated until the end of the century; local scale, co-benefits between 
REDD+ and adaptation of local communities can be more substantial (Long 2013; Morita and Matsumoto 2018), even 
if often difficult to quantify and not explicitly acknowledged (McElwee et al. 2017a) (Table 6.22). Desertification and 
land degradation: Large benefits at global scale when effects are cumulated for at least 20 years, for example, through 
reduced soil erosion (Borrelli et al. 2017) (Tables 6.30 and 6.38). The uncertainty of these global estimates is high, while 
more robust qualitative and some quantitative estimates are available at regional level. Food security: Small benefits; 
difficult to quantify at global level (Chapter 5 and Table 6.46).
Reforestation and 
forest restoration
Mitigation: Large benefits by rebuilding the carbon stocks in forest ecosystems, although decreases in surface albedo 
can reduce the net climate benefits, particularly in areas affected by seasonal snow cover (Sonntag et al. 2016; Mahmood 
et al. 2014) (Chapter 2 and Table 6.14). Adaptation: Large benefits by provision of Nature’s Contributions to People, 
including improving ecosystem functionality and services, providing microclimatic regulation for people and crops, wood 
and fodder as safety nets, soil erosion protection and soil fertility enhancement for agricultural resilience, coastal area 
protection, water and flood regulation (Locatelli et al. 2015b) (Table 6.22). Desertification: Large benefits through 
restoring forest ecosystems in dryland areas (Medugu et al. 2010; Salvati et al. 2014) (Chapter 3 and Table 6.30). Land 
degradation: Large benefits by re-establishment of perennial vegetation (Ellison et al. 2017) (Chapter 4 and Table 6.38). 
Food security: Moderate negative impacts due to potential competition for land for food production (Frank et al. 2017) 
(Chapter 5 and Table 6.46).
Afforestation
Mitigation: Large benefits for mitigation (Chapter 2 and Table 6.14), especially if it occurs in the tropics and in areas 
that are not significantly affected by seasonal snow cover. Adaptation: Large benefits on adaptation (Kongsager et al. 
2016; Reyer et al. 2009) (Chapter 2 and Table 6.22). Desertification: Large benefits by providing perennial vegetation 
in dry areas to help control desertification (Medugu et al. 2010; Salvati et al. 2014) (Chapter 3 and Table 6.30). Land 
degradation: Large benefits by stabilising soils through perennial vegetation (Lal 2001) (Chapter 4 and Table 6.38). 
Food security: Large negative impacts due to competition for land for food production (Kreidenweis et al. 2016; 
Smith et al. 2013) (Chapter 5 and Table 6.46).

Increased soil 
organic carbon 
content
Mitigation: Large benefits by creating soil carbon sinks (Table 6.15). Adaptation: Large benefits by 
improving resilience of food crop production systems to climate change (IPBES 2018) (Chapter 2 and Table 6.24). 
Desertification: Large benefits by improving soil health and sustainable use of land in dry areas (D’Odorico 
et al. 2013) (Chapter 3 and Table 6.31). Land degradation: Large benefits since it forms a major component of 
recommended practices for sustainable land management (Altieri and Nicholls 2017) (Chapter 4 and Table 6.39). 
Food security: Large benefits since it can increase yield and yield stability to enhance food production, though 
this is not always the case (Pan et al. 2009; Soussana et al. 2019; Hijbeek et al. 2017b; Schjønning et al. 2018) 
(Chapter 5 and Table 6.47). 
Reduced soil 
erosion
Mitigation: Large benefits or large negative impacts, since the final fate of eroded material is still debated – for 
example, at the global level, it is debated whether it is a large source or a large sink (Hoffmann et al. 2013) (Chapter 2 
and Table 6.15). Adaptation: Large benefits since soil erosion control prevents desertification (large benefits) and land 
degradation (large benefits), thereby improving the resilience of agriculture to climate change (Lal 1998; FAO and ITPS 
2015) (Chapters 2, 3 and 4, and Tables 6.23, 6.30 and 6.39). Food security: Large benefits mainly through the preserva-
tion of crop productivity (Lal 1998) (Chapter 5 and Table 6.47).
Reduced soil 
salinisation
ND
Techniques to prevent and reverse soil salinisation include groundwater management by drainage systems and/or 
crop rotation and use of amendments to alleviate soil sodicity. Mitigation: There are no studies to quantify the global 
impacts (Table 6.15). Adaptation: Moderate benefits by allowing existing crop systems to be maintained, reducing the 
need to abandon land (Dagar et al. 2016; UNCTAD 2011) (Table 6.23). Desertification and land degradation: Moder-
ate benefits since soil salinisation is a main driver of both desertification and land degradation (Rengasamy 2006; Dagar 
et al. 2016) (Chapters 3 and 4, and Tables 6.31 and 6.39). Food security: Moderate benefits by maintaining existing 
cropping systems and helping to close yield gaps in rainfed crops (Table 6.47).
Reduced soil 
compaction
ND
ND
Techniques to prevent and reverse soil compaction are based on the combination of suitable crop rotations, tillage 
and regulation of agricultural traffic (Hamza and Anderson 2005). Mitigation: The global mitigation potential has not 
been quantified (Chamen et al. 2015; Epron et al. 2016; Tullberg et al. 2018) (Table 6.15). Adaptation: Limited benefits 
by improving productivity but on relatively small global areas (Table 6.22). Desertification: no global data (Table 6.31). 
Land degradation: Large benefits since soil compaction is a main driver of land degradation (FAO and ITPS 2015) 
(Table 6.39). Food security: Moderate benefits by helping to close yield gaps where compaction is a limiting factor 
(Anderson and Peters 2016) (Table 6.47).
Biochar addition 
to soil
ND
ND
Mitigation: Large benefits by increasing recalcitrant carbon stocks in the soil (Smith 2016; Fuss et al. 2018; IPCC 2018) 
(Chapter 2 and Table 6.15). Adaptation: There are no global estimates of the impact of biochar on climate adaptation 
(Table 6.23). Desertification: There are no global estimates of the impact of biochar on desertification (Table 6.31). 
Land degradation: Limited benefits by improving the soil water-holding capacity, nutrient-use efficiency, and potentially 
ameliorating heavy metal pollution (Sohi 2012) (Table 6.39). Food security: Limited benefits by increasing crop yields in 
the tropics – though not in temperate regions (Jeffery et al. 2017) – but potentially Large negative impacts by creating 
additional pressure on land if large quantities of biomass feedstock are required for biochar production (Table 6.47).

Fire management
Mitigation: Large benefits by reduced size, severity and frequency of wildfires, thereby preventing emissions and 
preserving carbon stocks (Arora and Melton 2018) (Table 6.16, Chapter 2, and Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 2). 
Adaptation: Moderate benefits by reducing mortality attributable to landscape fire smoke exposure, fire management 
provides adaptation benefits (Doerr and Santín 2016; Johnston et al. 2012; Koplitz et al. 2016) (Table 6.24). Desertifi-
cation: Large benefits since control of wildfires and long-term maintenance of tree stock density protects against soil 
erosion (Neary et al. 2009; Arora and Melton 2018) (Table 6.32). Land degradation: Large benefits by stabilising forest 
ecosystems (Neary et al. 2009; Arora and Melton 2018) (Table 6.40). Food security: Moderate benefits by maintain-
ing forest food product availability and preventing fire expansion to agricultural land (FAO 2015; Keenan et al. 2015; 
FAO et al. 2018; Pradhan et al. 2013; World Bank 2018a, b) (Table 6.48). 
Reduced landslides 
and natural hazards
Mitigation: The prevention of landslides and natural hazards benefits mitigation, but because of the limited impact 
on GHG emissions and eventual preservation of topsoil carbon stores, the impact is estimated to be small globally 
(IPCC AR5 WG2, Chapter 14) (Table 6.16). Adaptation: Provides structural/physical adaptations to climate change 
(IPCC AR5 WG2, Chapter 14) (Table 6.24). Desertification: Due to the small global areas affected within global dry-
lands, the benefits for desertification control are limited (Chapter 3 and Table 6.32). Land degradation: Since landslides 
and natural hazards are among the most severe degradation processes, prevention will have a large positive impact on 
land degradation (FAO and ITPS 2015) (Chapter 4 and Table 6.40). Food security: In countries where mountain slopes 
are cropped for food, such as in the Pacific Islands (Campbell 2015), the management and prevention of landslides 
can deliver benefits for food security, though the global areas are limited (Table 6.48). 
Reduced pollution 
including 
acidification
Mitigation: Large benefits since measures to reduce emissions of short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) can slow projected 
global mean warming (UNEP and WMO 2011), with early intervention providing 0.5°C cooling by 2050 (UNEP and WMO 
2011) (Table 6.16). But moderate negative impacts are also possible since reduced reactive nitrogen deposition could 
decrease terrestrial carbon uptake (Table 6.16). Adaptation: Moderate benefits since controlling particulate matter (PM2.5) 
and ozone improves human health (Anenberg et al. 2012) (Table 6.24). Desertification: Moderate benefits since salinisa-
tion, pollution and acidification are stressors for desertification (Oldeman et al. 1991) (Table 6.32). Land degradation: 
Moderate benefits since acid deposition is a significant driver of land degradation (Oldeman et al. 1991; Smith et al. 2015) 
(Table 6.40). Food security: Large benefits since ozone is harmful to crops, so measures to reduce air pollution would be 
expected to increase crop production (FAO 2018b; FAO et al. 2018; Shindell et al. 2012; World Bank 2018a) (Table 6.48).

desertification, land degradation or on food security (Tables 6.16, 6.24, 6.33, 6.40 and 6.48).
Restoration and 
reduced conversion 
of coastal wetlands
Mitigation: Large benefits since coastal wetland restoration and avoided coastal wetland impacts deliver moderate 
carbon sinks by 2030 (Griscom et al. 2017) (Table 6.16). Adaptation: Large benefits by providing a natural defence 
against coastal flooding and storm surges by dissipating wave energy, reducing erosion and by helping to stabilise shore 
sediments (Table 6.24). Desertification: There is likely negligible impact of coastal wetland restoration for prevention 
of desertification (Table 6.32). Land degradation: Limited benefits since large areas of global coastal wetlands are 
degraded (Lotze et al. 2006; Griscom et al. 2017) (Table 6.40). Food security: Small benefits to small adverse impacts 
since large areas of converted coastal wetlands are used for food production (e.g., mangroves converted for aquaculture), 
restoration could displace food production and damage local food supply, though mangrove restoration can also restore 
local fisheries (Naylor et al. 2000) (Table 6.48).
Restoration and 
reduced conversion 
of peatlands
ND
Mitigation: Moderate benefits since avoided peat impacts and peat restoration deliver moderate carbon sinks 
by 2030 (Griscom et al. 2017) (Table 6.16), though there can be increases in methane emissions after restoration 
(Jauhiainen et al. 2008). Adaptation: Likely to be benefits by regulating water flow and preventing downstream flooding 
(Munang et al. 2014) (Table 6.24), but the global potential has not been quantified. Desertification: No impact since 
peatlands occur in wet areas and deserts in dry areas. Land degradation: Moderate benefits since large areas of global 
peatlands are degraded (Griscom et al. 2017) (Table 6.40). Food security: Moderate adverse impacts since restoration of 
large areas of tropical peatlands and some northern peatlands that have been drained and cleared for food production, 
could displace food production and damage local food supply (Table 6.48).

ND
ND
ND
Mitigation: Moderate to large benefits by removing atmospheric CO2 (Table 6.17; Lenton 2010; Smith et al. 2016a; Taylor 
et al. 2016). Adaptation: There is no literature to assess the global impacts of enhanced mineral weathering on adaptation 
(Table 6.25) nor on desertification (Table 6.33). Land degradation: Limited benefits expected since ground minerals can 
increase pH where acidification is the driver of degradation (Table 6.41; Taylor et al. 2016). Food security: Though there 
may be co-benefits for food production (Beerling et al. 2018), these have not been quantified globally (Table 6.49). 
Bioenergy 
and BECCS
Mitigation: Large benefits of large-scale bioenergy and BECCS by potential to remove large quantities of CO2 from the 
atmosphere (Table 6.17). Adaptation: Limited adverse impacts of large-scale bioenergy and BECCS by increasing pres-
sure on land (Table 6.25). Desertification: Up to 15 million km2 of additional land is required in 2100 in 2°C scenarios, 
which will increase pressure for desertification and land degradation (Sections 6.3.3.1 and 6.3.4.1). This defines the maxi-
mum area potentially impacted, though the actual area affected by this additional pressure is not easily quantified. Land 
degradation: Up to 15 million km2 of additional land is required in 2100 in 2°C scenarios, which will increase pressure 
for desertification and land degradation (Sections 6.3.3.1; 6.3.4.1). This defines the maximum area potentially impacted, 
though the actual area affected by this additional pressure is not easily quantified. Food security: Large adverse impacts 
of large-scale bioenergy and BECCS through increased competition for land for food (Table 6.49). These potentials and 
effects assume large areas of bioenergy crops, resulting in large mitigation potentials (i.e., >3 GtCO2 yr–1). The sign and 
magnitude of the effects of bioenergy and BECCS depends on the scale of deployment, the type of bioenergy feedstock, 
which other response options are included, and where bioenergy is grown (including prior land use and indirect land-use 
change emissions). For example, limiting bioenergy production to marginal lands or abandoned cropland would have 
negligible effects on biodiversity, food security, and potentially small co-benefits for land degradation; however, the 
benefits for mitigation would also be smaller (Cross-Chapter Box 7 in this chapter, and Table 6.13).

Mitigation: Large benefits for mitigation by greatly reducing GHG emissions (Chapter 5 and Table 6.18). Adaptation: While 
it would be expected to help with adaptation by reducing agricultural land area, there are no studies providing global quan-
tifications (Table 6.26). Desertification: Potential moderate benefits by decreasing pressure on land – restricted by relatively 
limited global area (Table 6.34). Land degradation: Large benefits by decreasing pressure on land (Table 6.42). Food 
security: Large benefits by decreasing competition for land, allowing more food to be produced from less land (Table 6.50).
Reduced post-
harvest losses
Mitigation: Large benefits by reducing food sector GHG emissions and reducing the area required to produce the same 
quantity of food (Table 6.18), though increased use of refrigeration could increase emissions from energy use. Adap-
tation: Large benefits by reducing pressure on land (Table 6.26). Desertification and land degradation: Moderate 
benefits for both by reducing pressure on land (Table 6.34 and Table 6.42). Food security: Large benefits since most of 
the food wasted in developing countries arises from post-harvest losses (Ritzema et al. 2017) (Chapter 5 and Table 6.50). 
Reduced food 
waste (consumer  
or retailer)

Mitigation: Large benefits by reducing food sector GHG emissions and reducing the area required to produce the same

land area, there are no studies quantifying global adaptation impacts (Table 6.26). Desertification: Moderate benefits 
by reducing pressure on land (Table 6.34). Land degradation: Large benefits by reducing pressure on land (Table 6.42). 
Food security: Large benefits since 30% of all food produced globally is wasted (Kummu et al. 2012) (Table 6.50).

Sustainable sourcing
ND
ND
Mitigation: No studies available to assess the global impact (Table 6.19). Adaptation: Moderate benefits by 
diversifying and increasing flexibility in the food system to climate stressors and shocks while simultaneously creating 
economic alternatives for the poor (thereby strengthening adaptive capacity) and lowering expenditures of food 
processors and retailers by reducing losses (Muller et al. 2017) (Chapter 5 and Table 6.27). Desertification: No studies 
available to assess the global impact (Table 6.35 and Table 6.43). Land degradation: Potentially large benefits, as 
over 4 Mkm2 is currently certified for sustainable forest production, which could increase in future (Table 6.44). Food 
security: Moderate benefits by diversifying markets and developing value-added products in the food supply system, by 
increasing its economic performance and revenues to local farmers (Reidsma et al. 2010), by strengthening the capacity 
of food production chains to adapt to future markets and to improve income of smallholder farmers (Murthy and Madhava 
Naidu 2012) (Chapter 5 and Table 6.51). It may also provide more direct links between producers and consumers.

Mitigation: There are no studies assessing the mitigation potential globally (Table 6.19). Adaptation: Large benefits by

(Table 6.27). Desertification and land degradation: No studies assessing global potential (Tables 6.35 and 6.43). Food

There are no studies that assess the global potential to contribute to mitigation, adaptation, desertification

Improved food 
processing and

Mitigation: Moderate benefits through reduced energy consumption, climate-friendly foods and reduced GHG emis-
sions from transportation (Avetisyan et al. 2014), waste (Porter et al. 2016), and energy use (Mohammadi et al. 2014; 
Song et al. 2017) (Table 6.19). Adaptation: Large benefits among poor farmers through reduced costs and improved 
resilience (Table 6.27). Desertification and land degradation: There are no studies assessing global potential 
(Tables 6.35 and Table 6.43). Food security: Large benefits by supporting healthier diets and reducing food loss 
and waste (Garnett 2011) (Chapter 5 and Table 6.51). 
Improved energy 
use in food systems
ND

Mitigation: Moderate benefits by reducing GHG emissions through decreasing use of fossil fuels and energy-intensive 
products, though the emission reduction is not accounted for in the agriculture, forestry and other land-use (AFOLU) 
sector (Smith et al. 2014; IPCC AR5 WG3 Chapter 11) (Table 6.19). Adaptation: Large benefits for small farmers by 
reducing costs and increasing their resilience to climate change (Table 6.27). Desertification and land degradation: 
There are no studies assessing global potential (Tables 6.35 and 6.43). Food security: Large benefits, largely by 
improving efficiency for 2.5 million people still using traditional biomass for energy (Chapter 5 and Table 6.51).

poorly quantified globally, 5000 km2 is at risk from urban sprawl in Spain alone (Table 6.36). Land degradation: Limited 
benefits – though poorly quantified globally, urban sprawl effects millions of ha of land (Table 6.44). Food security: 
Moderate benefits estimated from impacts on food supply in models (Bren d’Amour et al. 2016) (Table 6.52). 
Livelihood 
diversification
ND
Mitigation: There are no studies assessing the global potential (Table 6.20). Adaptation: Large benefits through helping 
households to buffer income fluctuations and providing a broader range of options for the future (Table 6.28; Ahmed 
and Stepp 2016; Thornton and Herrero 2014). Desertification: There are no studies assessing the global potential, 
although there are anecdotal reports of limited benefits from improved land management resulting from diversification 
(Batterbury 2001; Herrmann and Hutchinson 2005; Stringer et al. 2009) (Table 6.36). Land degradation: Limited benefits, 
for example, improved land-use mosaics (Palacios et al. 2013), larger-scale adoption in China’s Sloping Land Conversion 
Program to diversify income and reduce degradation has impacted on 0.1 Mkm2 (Liu and Lan 2015) (Table 6.44). Food 
security: Large benefits since many of the world’s 700 million smallholders practice diversification, helping to provide 
economic access to food (Morton 2007) (Table 6.52). 
Use of local seeds
ND
ND
ND
Mitigation: There are no studies assessing the global potential (Table 6.19). Adaptation: Large benefits given that 
60 to 100% of seeds used in various countries of the global South are likely local farmer-bred (non-commercial) seed, 
and moving to the use of commercial seed would increase costs considerably for these farmers. Seed networks and 
banks protect local agrobiodiversity and landraces, which are important to facilitate adaptation, and can provide crucial 
lifelines when crop harvests fail (Louwaars 2002; Howard 2015; Coomes et al. 2015; Van Niekerk and Wynberg 2017; 
Vasconcelos et al. 2013; Reisman 2017) (Table 6.28). Desertification and land degradation: There are no studies as-
sessing global potential (Tables 6.36 and Table 6.44). Food security: Large benefits since local seeds increase the ability 
of farmers to revive and strengthen local food systems; several studies have reported more diverse and healthy food 
in areas with strong food sovereignty networks (Coomes et al. 2015; Bisht et al. 2018) (Table 6.52). 
Disaster risk 
management
ND

ND
Mitigation: There are no studies to assess the global mitigation potential of different Disaster Risk Management (DRM) 
approaches (Table 6.19). Adaptation: Large benefits due to widespread use of early warning systems that reach hundreds 
of millions (Hillbruner and Moloney 2012; Mahmud and Prowse 2012; Birkmann et al. 2015) (Table 6.28). Desertifi-
cation and land degradation. There are no studies assessing the global potential (Tables 6.36 and Table 6.44). Food 
security: Moderate benefits by helping farmers to harvest crops in advance of impending weather events, or otherwise 
to make agricultural decisions to prepare for adverse events (Fakhruddin et al. 2015; Genesio et al. 2011; Hillbruner 
and Moloney 2012) (Table 6.52).
Risk-sharing 
instruments
ND
Mitigation: Variable impacts – poor global coverage in the literature, though studies from the US suggest a small 
increase in emissions from crop insurance and likely benefits from other risk-sharing instruments (Table 6.20). 
Adaptation: Moderate benefits by buffering and transferring weather risk, saving farmers the cost of crop losses. 
However, overly subsidised insurance can undermine the market’s role in pricing risks and thus depress more rapid 
adaptation strategies (Meze-Hausken et al. 2009; Skees and Collier 2012; Jaworski 2016) (Table 6.28). Desertification: 
The impacts of risk-sharing globally have not been quantified (Table 6.36). Land degradation: Variable impacts as 
evidence suggests that subsidised insurance in particular can increase crop production in marginal lands, and reforming 
this would lead to benefits (Table 6.44). Food security: Small to moderate benefits for food security, as risk-sharing 
often promotes food-supply sharing (Table 6.52).

Managing interactions and interlinkages
Having assessed the potential of each response option for contributing 
to addressing mitigation, adaptation, desertification, land degradation 
and food security in Section 6.3, this section assesses the feasibility 
of each response option with respect to cost, barriers, and issues 
of saturation and reversibility (Section 6.4.1), before assessing 
the sensitivity of the response options to future climate change 
(Section 6.4.2) and examining the contribution of each response option 
to ecosystem services (classified according to Nature’s Contribution 
to People (IPBES 2018), and to sustainable development (assessed 
against the UN SDGs) (6.4.3). Section 6.4.4 examines opportunities 
for implementation of integrated response options, paving the way to 
potential policies examined in Chapter 7, before the consequences of 
delayed action are assessed in Section 6.4.5.
6.4.1 
Feasibility of the integrated response 
options with respect to costs, barriers, 
saturation and reversibility
For each of the response options, Tables 6.62–6.69 summarise the 
feasibility with respect to saturation and reversibility and cost, 
technological, institutional, socio-cultural and environmental and 
geophysical barriers (the same barrier categories used in SR15).
Many land management options face issues of saturation and 
reversibility; however, these are not of concern for the value chain 
and risk management options. Reversibility is an issue for all options 
that increase terrestrial carbon stock, either through increased soil 
carbon or changes in land cover (e.g., reforestation, afforestation), 
since future changes in climate or land cover could result in reduced 
carbon storage (Smith 2013). In addition, the benefits of options that 
improve land management (e.g., improved cropland management, 
improved grazing management) will cease if the practice is halted, 
reversing any potential benefits. 
The cost of the response options varies substantially, with some 
options having relatively low costs (e.g., the cost of agroforestry is less 
than 10 USD tCO2e–1) while others have much higher costs (e.g., the 
cost of BECCS could be as much as 250 USD tCO2e–1). In addition 
to cost, other economic barriers may prevent implementation; for 
example, agroforestry is a low-cost option (Smith et al. 2014), but 
lack of reliable financial support could be a barrier (Hernandez-
Morcillo et al. 2018). Additionally, there are a number of reasons why 
even no-cost options are not adopted, including risk aversion, lack of 
information, market structure, externalities, and policies (Jaffe 2019).
Some of the response options have technological barriers that may 
limit their wide-scale application in the near term. For example, BECCS 
has only been implemented at small-scale demonstration facilities 
(Kemper 2015); challenges exist with upscaling these options to the 
levels discussed in this chapter.
Many response options have institutional and socio-cultural barriers. 
Institutional barriers include governance, financial incentives and 
financial resources. For example, the management of supply chains 
includes challenges related to political will within trade regimes, 
economic laissez-faire policies that discourage interventions in 
markets, and the difficulties of coordination across economic sectors 
(Poulton et al. 2006; Cohen et al. 2009; Gilbert 2012). Implementation 
of other options, for example, BECCS, is limited by the absence of 
financial incentives.
Options like dietary change face socio-cultural barriers; while diets 
have changed in the past, they are deeply culturally embedded 
and behaviour change is extremely difficult to effect, even when 
health benefits are well known (Macdiarmid et al. 2018). For some 
options, the specific barrier is dependent on the region. For example, 
barriers to reducing food waste in industrialised countries include 
inconvenience, lack of financial incentives, lack of public awareness, 
and low prioritisation (Kummu et al. 2012; Graham-Rowe et al. 2014). 
Barriers in developing countries include reliability of transportation 
networks, market reliability, education, technology, capacity, and 
infrastructure (Kummu et al. 2012).

regions (e.g., seed availability). (Lillesø et al. 2011; Meijer et al. 2015; Sileshi et al. 2008; 
Smith et al. 2007, 2014.)
Agricultural 
diversification
More support from extension services, access to inputs and markets, economic incentives for 
producing a certain crop or livestock product, research and investments focused on adapted 
varieties and climatic resilient systems, a combination of agricultural and non-agricultural 
activities (e.g., off-farm jobs) are all important interventions aimed at overcoming barriers 
to agricultural diversification. (Ahmed and Stepp 2016; Barnes et al. 2015; Barnett and 
Palutikof 2015; Martin and Lorenzen 2016; Roesch-McNally et al. 2016; Waha et al. 2018.) 
Reduced grassland 
conversion to 
cropland
Economic: Avoiding conversion is low cost, but there may be significant opportunity 
costs associated with foregone production of crops. Institutional: only in some regions  
(e.g., poor governance to prevent conversion.)
Integrated water 
management
Institutional: Effective implementation is dependent on the adoption of a combination 
of ‘hard’, infrastructural, and ‘soft’ institutional measures. Socio-cultural: Education can 
be a barrier and some strategies (e.g., site-specific water management, drip irrigation) 
can be expensive. Cultural/behavioural barriers are likely to be small. (Dresner et al. 2015; 
Erwin 2009; Lotze et al. 2006; Thornton et al. 2009.)
Note: The cost thresholds in USD tCO2e–1 are from Griscom et al. (2017); thresholds in USD ha–1 are chosen to be comparable, but precise conversions will depend on the 
response option.

Economic: Can be cost-effective at scale. Institutional: Only in some regions (e.g., poor

Biodiversity 
conservation
Economic: While protected areas and other forms of biodiversity conservation can be 
cost-effective, they are often underfunded relative to needs. Institutional: There have 
been challenges in getting systematic conservation planning to happen, due to institutional 
fragmentation and overlapping mandates. Socio-cultural: Despite the fact that biodiversity 
conservation may provide co-benefits, such as water or carbon protection, local populations 
often have had social and cultural conflicts with protected areas and other forms of exclu-
sionary biodiversity conservation that are imposed in a top-down fashion or which restrict 
livelihood options. (Emerton et al. 2006; Hill et al. 2015; Langford et al. 2011; Larsen et al.

6.4.2 
Sensitivity of the integrated response 
options to climate change impacts
With continued increases in warming, there are risks to the efficacy of 
some of the response options due to future climate change impacts, 
such as increased climate variability and extreme events. While many of 
the response options can help increase capacity to deliver adaptation 
benefits (Section 6.3.2), beyond certain thresholds of climate impacts 
they may be less effective or increasingly risky options. This requires 
that some response options need to anticipate these climate impacts in 
their implementation. We outline some of these impacts below. 
Agriculture response options: Increased food productivity as 
a  response option is highly sensitive to climate change impacts. 
Chapter  5 (Section 5.2.3.1) notes that global mean yields of some 
crops (maize and soybean) decrease with warming, while others (rice 
and wheat) increase with warming, up to a threshold of 3°C. Similarly, 
improved cropland management response options that rely on crop 
diversification or improved varieties may face challenges in efficacy from 
production declines. Improved grazing land management may continue 
to be feasible as a response option in the future under climate change in 
northern regions, but will likely become more difficult in tropical regions 
and Australia as temperature rises will reduce the carrying capacity 
of lands (Nardone et  al. 2010) (Section 5.2.3.2). Improved livestock 
management also faces numerous challenges, particularly related to 
stresses on animals from temperatures, water, and diseases; overall, 
livestock numbers are projected to decline 7.5–9.6% by 2050 (Rivera-
Ferre et al. 2016; Boone et al. 2018) (Section 5.2.3.2). Pastoralists may 
also be less likely to implement improved measures due to other risks 
and vulnerabilities under climate change (Thornton et al. 2009). 
The impact of climate change on agroforestry is more difficult to 
model than single crops in process-based crop models, as agroforestry 
systems are far more complex (Luedeling et  al. 2014); thus, it is 
unknown how the efficacy of this response option might be impacted. 
Agricultural diversification has been promoted as an adaptive strategy 
to climate impacts, given that diversity is known to increase resiliency 
of agricultural and natural systems, such as in resistance to increased 
pests or diseases; it can also provide diversified income portfolios when 
some crops may become sensitive to climate events (Bradshaw et al. 
2004; Lin 2011). Diversified farms are expected to increase in Africa 
by 2060 as specialised farms with single crops face challenges under 
climate change (Seo 2010). However, it is not known if these options 
and advantages of diversification have a temperature threshold 
beyond which they are less effective.
Reduced grassland conversion is not likely to be affected as a response 
option per se since it is directed at conserving natural grassland 
areas, but these areas may face increased pressures for conversion 
if farmers experience crop failures under climate change and need 
to expand the cultivated area holdings to make up for losses. Lobell 
et al. (2013) have estimated the impacts of investment decisions to 
adapt to the effects of climate change on crop yields to 2050 and find 
that cropland will expand over 23% more land area (over 3 Mkm2), 
mostly in Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa.
Integrated water management to improve water availability and 
reliability of water for agricultural production is likely to become 
more challenging in future scenarios of water declines, which are 
likely to be regionally uneven (Sections 2.6 and 6.4.4).
Forest response options: The availability of forest management as 
a response option can be impacted on by climate-induced changes, 
including increased diseases, pests and fires (Dale et al. 2001; Logan 
et al. 2003) (Section 4.5.1.2). These impacts will affect reforestation 
and afforestation response options as well. Locatelli et al. (2015a) note 
624
Chapter 6 
Interlinkages between desertification, land degradation, food security and greenhouse gas fluxes

that climate change will influence seedling establishment, tree growth 
and mortality, and the presence of invasive species and/or pests; these 
can be buffered with modified silvicultural practices, including species 
selection (Pawson et al. 2013). Climate change can also alter the sink 
capacity for vegetation carbon sequestration, reducing the potential for 
reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD), 
reforestation and afforestation (Bonan 2008; Malhi et al. 2002). 
Soil management: Climate change can alter the sink capacity for 
soil carbon sequestration, reducing the potential for increased soil 
organic carbon as an option. Projected climate change can reduce 
soil resilience to extreme weather, pests and biological invasion, 
environmental pollutants and other pressures, making reduced soil 
erosion and reduced soil compaction as response options harder 
to achieve (Smith et  al. 2015). Climate change will likely increase 
demand for irrigation in dryland areas, which can increase risks of 
salinisation, diminishing the effectiveness of this response (Smith et al. 
2015). Biochar additions to soil may be affected by future climatic 
changes, such as rising soil temperatures, but little is known, given 
that most research on the subject is from laboratory and not in situ 
field experiments. There are also wide estimates of the stability and 
residence times of biochar from this literature (Gurwick et al. 2013).
Other ecosystem management: Fire management is likely to 
become more challenging in a changing climate; some studies 
suggest an 50% increase in fire occurrence by the end of the 
century in circumboreal forests (Flannigan et  al. 2009). Landslide 
risks are related to climate through total rainfall, rainfall intensity, 
air temperature and the general weather system (Gariano and 
Guzzetti 2016); thus reduced landslides and natural hazards as a 
response option will be made more difficult by increasing storms and 
seasonality of rainfall events projected for many areas of the world. 
Reduced pollution is likely less affected by climate change and can 
continue to be an option, despite increasing temperatures. 
Conversely, some invasive species may thrive under climate change, 
such as moving to new areas or being less susceptible to control 
protocols (Hellmann et  al. 2008). Conversion of coastal wetlands 
will be more difficult to halt if loss of productive land elsewhere 
encourages development on these lands, but coastal wetlands will 
likely adapt to increased CO2 and higher sea levels through sediment 
accretion, which will also enhance their capacity to act as carbon 
sinks (Duarte et al. 2013). While subarctic peatlands are at risk due 
to warming, these are not the main peatlands that are at risk from 
agricultural conversion (Tarnocai 2006). Peatlands, such as those in 
the tropics, may be more vulnerable in hotter scenarios to water table 
alterations and fire risk (Gorham 1991). Biodiversity conservation, 
such as through protected areas or corridors, may be threatened 
by increased land expansion under agriculture in climate change 
scenarios, including the newly available land in northern climates 
that may become agriculturally suited (Gimona et al. 2012), lessening 
the effectiveness of this response option.
Carbon dioxide removal (CDR): The efficacy of enhanced weathering 
is not likely to be affected by future climate changes. On the other 
hand, climate change will affect the productivity of bioenergy crops 
(Cronin et al. 2018), influencing the mitigation potential of bioenergy 
and BECCS (Calvin et al. 2013; Kyle et al. 2014). There is uncertainty in 
the sign and magnitude of the effect of climate change on bioenergy 
crop yields. As a result, there is uncertainty in whether climate change 
will increase or decrease the potential of bioenergy and BECCS.
Demand management of value chains: For most response options 
in demand-side management, the tools are generally not made more 
difficult by future climate changes. For example, dietary change 
is not likely to be affected by climate change; in fact, the opposite 
is more likely, that diets will shift in response to climate change 
impacts as reflected in high prices for some staple grains and meats, 
the productivity of which may be reduced (Tigchelaar et al. 2018). 
However, there is some indication that fruit and vegetable production 
will also be reduced in future scenarios, making healthier diets 
potentially harder to achieve in some regions (Springmann et al. 2016). 
Reduced post-harvest losses and reduced food waste may become an 
even more important option if water or heat stresses under climate 
change reduce overall harvests. Material substitution does have 
risks related to the availability of products if there are declines in the 
growth of forest and other biomass in certain future scenarios over 
time, although some evidence indicates that biomass may increase in 
the short term with limited warming (Boisvenue and Running 2006). 
Supply management of value chains: Sustainable sourcing relies 
on being able to produce consumer goods sustainably (palm oil, 
timber, cocoa, etc.), and these may be at risk; for example, areas 
suitable for oil palm production are estimated to decrease by 75% by 
2100 (Paterson et al. 2017). Improved management of supply chains 
is likely to increase in importance as a tool to manage food security, 
given that climate change threatens to lead to more production 
shocks in the future (Baldos and Hertel 2015). For enhanced urban 
food systems, climate stresses like heat island effects or increased 
water scarcity in urban areas may reduce the viability of food 
production in certain urban systems (da Silva et al. 2012). Improved 
food processing and retailing and improved energy use in agriculture 
are not likely to be impacted on by climate change. 
Risk management options: Most risk management response options 
are not affected by climate impacts per se, although the increased risks 
that people may face will increase the need for funding and support to 
deploy these options. For example, disaster risk management will likely 
increase in importance in helping people adapt to longer-term climate 
changes (Begum et al. 2014); it is also likely to cost more as increased 
impacts of climate change, such as intensification or frequency of 
storm events, may increase. Management of urban sprawl may also 
be challenged by increased migration driven by climate change, as 
people displaced by climate change may move to unregulated urban 
areas (Adamo 2010). Livelihood diversification can assist in adapting to 
climate changes and is not likely to be constrained as a response option, 
as climate-sensitive livelihoods may be replaced by others that are less 
so. Use of local seeds as an effective response option may depend on 
the specific types of seeds and crops used, as some may not be good 
choices under increased heat and water stress (Gross et  al. 2017). 
Risk-sharing instruments are unlikely to be affected by climate change, 
with the exception of index and crop insurance, which may become 
unaffordable if too many climate shocks result in insurance claims, 
decreasing the ability of the industry to provide this tool (Mills 2005).

Cross-Chapter Box 8 |  Ecosystem services and Nature’s Contributions to People,  
and their relation to the land–climate system
Pamela McElwee (The United States of America), Jagdish Krishnaswamy (India), Lindsay Stringer (United Kingdom)
This Cross-Chapter Box describes the concepts of ecosystem services (ES) and Nature’s Contributions to People (NCP), and their 
importance to land–climate interactions. ES have become a useful concept to describe the benefits that humans obtain from 
ecosystems and have strong relevance to sustainable land management (SLM) decisions and their outcomes, while NCP is a new 
approach championed by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) (explained 
below). It is timely that this SRCCL report includes attention to ES/NCP, as the previous Special Report on land-use, land-use change and 
forestry (LULUCF) did not make use of these concepts and focused mostly on carbon fluxes in land–climate interactions (IPCC 2000). The 
broader mandate of SRCCL is to address climate, but also land degradation, desertification and food security issues, all of which are 
closely linked to the provisioning of various ES/NCP, and the decision and outline for SRCCL explicitly request an examination of how 
desertification and degradation ‘impacts on ecosystem services (e.g., water, soil and soil carbon and biodiversity that underpins them)’. 
Attention to ES/NCP is particularly important in discussing co-benefits, trade-offs and adverse side effects of potential climate change 
mitigation, land management, or food security response options, as many actions may have positive impacts on climate mitigation or 
food production, but may also come with a decline in ES provisioning, or adversely impact on biodiversity (Section 6.4.3). This box 
considers the importance of the ES/NCP concepts, how definitions have changed over time, continuing debates over operationalisation 
and use of these ideas. It concludes by looking at how ES/NCP are treated in various chapters in this report. 
While the first uses of the term ‘ecosystem services’ appeared in the 1980s (Lele et al. 2013; Mooney and Ehrlich 1997), the roots of 
interest in ES extend back to the late 1960s and the extinction crisis, with concern that species decline might cause loss of valuable 
benefits to humankind (King 1966; Helliwell 1969; Westman 1977). While concern over extinction was explicitly linked to biodiversity 
loss, later ideas beyond biodiversity have animated interest in ES, including the multi-functional nature of ecosystems. A seminal paper 
by Costanza et al. (1997) attempted to put an economic value on the stocks of global ES and natural capital on which humanity relied. 
Attention to ES expanded rapidly after the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA, 2005), and the linkages between ES and economic 
valuation of these functions were addressed by the Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity study (TEEB 2009). The ES approach has 
increasingly been used in global and national environmental assessments, including the UK National Ecosystem Assessment (Watson 
et al. 2011), and recent and ongoing regional and global assessments organised by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on 
Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) (Díaz et al. 2015). IPBES has recently completed an assessment on land degradation and 
restoration that addresses a range of ES issues of relevance to the SRCCL report (IPBES 2018). 
The MA defined ES as ‘the benefits that ecosystems provide to people,’ and identified four broad groupings of ES: provisioning services 
such as food, water, or timber; regulating services that have impacts on climate, diseases or water quality, among others; cultural 
services that provide recreational, aesthetic, and spiritual benefits; and supporting services such as soil formation, photosynthesis, 
and nutrient cycling (MA 2005). The MA emphasised that people are components of ecosystems engaged in dynamic interactions, 
and particularly assessed how changes in ES might impact human well-being, such as access to basic materials for living (shelter, 
clothing, energy); health (clean air and water); social relations (including community cohesion); security (freedom from natural 
disasters); and freedom of choice (the opportunity to achieve) (MA 2005). Upon publication of the MA, incorporation of ES into 
land-use change assessments increased dramatically, including studies on how to maximise provisioning of ES alongside human 
well-being (Carpenter et al. 2009); how intensive food production to feed growing populations required trading off a number of 
important ES (Foley et al. 2005); and how including ES in general circulation models indicated increasing vulnerability to ES change or 
loss in future climate scenarios (Schröter et al. 2005).
Starting in 2015, IPBES introduced a new related concept to ES, that of Nature’s Contributions to People (NCP), which are defined as ‘all 
the contributions, both positive and negative, of living nature (i.e., diversity of organisms, ecosystems and their associated ecological 
and evolutionary processes) to the quality of life of people’ (Díaz et al. 2018). NCP are divided into regulating NCP, non-material NCP, 
and material NCP, a different approach than used by the MA (see Figure 1). However, IPBES has stressed that NCP are a particular way 
to think of ES, rather than a replacement for ES. The concept of NCP is proposed to be a broader umbrella to engage a wider range 
of scholarship – particularly from the social sciences and humanities – and a wider range of values, from intrinsic to instrumental to 
relational – particularly those held by indigenous peoples and local communities (Redford and Adams 2009; Schröter et al. 2014; Pascual 
et al. 2017; Díaz et al. 2018). The differences between the MA and IPBES approaches can be seen in Table 1. 
While there are many similarities between ES and NCP, as seen above, the IPBES’s decision to use the NCP concept has been 
controversial, with some people arguing that an additional term is superfluous; that it incorrectly associates ES with economic

valuation; and that the NCP concept is not useful for policy uptake (Braat 2018; Peterson et al. 2018). Others have argued that the 
MA’s approach is outdated, does not explicitly address biodiversity, and confuses different concepts, like economic goods, ecosystem 
functions, and general benefits (Boyd and Banzhaf 2007). Moreover, for both ES and NCP approaches, it has been difficult to make 
complex ecological processes and functions amenable to assessments that can be used and compared across wider landscapes, 
different policy actors, and multiple stakeholders (de Groot et al. 2002; Naeem et al. 2015; Seppelt et al. 2011). There remain 
competing categorisation schemes for ES, as well as competing metrics on how most ES might be measured (Wallace 2007; 
Potschin and Haines-Young 2011; Danley and Widmark 2016; Nahlik et al. 2012). The implications of these discussions for this SRCCL 
report is that many areas of uncertainty remain with regard to much ES/NCP measurement and valuation, which will have ramifications 
for choosing response options and policies.
This report addresses ES/NCP in multiple ways. Individual chapters have used the term ‘ES’ in most cases, especially since the 
preponderance of existing literature uses the ES terminology. For example, Chapter 2 discusses CO2 fluxes, nutrients and water budgets 
as important ES deriving from land–climate interactions. Chapters 3 and 4 discuss issues such as biomass production, soil erosion, 
biodiversity loss, and other ES affected by land-use change. Chapter 5 discusses both ES and NCP issues surrounding food system 
provisioning and trade-offs. 
In Chapter 6, the concept of NCP is used. For example, Tables 6.70 to 6.72, possible response options to respond to climate change, 
to address land degradation or desertification, and to ensure food security, are cross-referenced against the 18 NCPs identified by Díaz 
et al. (2018) to see where there are co-benefits and adverse side effects. For instance, while BECCS may deliver on climate mitigation, it 
results in a number of adverse side effects that are significant with regard to water provisioning, food and feed availability, and loss of 
supporting identities if BECCS competes against local land uses of cultural importance. Chapter 7 has Section 7.2.2.2, explicitly covering 
risks due to loss of biodiversity and ES, and Table 7.1 which includes policy responses to various land–climate–society hazards, some of 
which are likely to enhance risk of loss of biodiversity and ES. A case study on the impact of renewable energy on biodiversity and ES is 
also included. Chapter 7 also notes that, because there is no Sustainable Development Goal covering freshwater biodiversity and aquatic 
ecosystems, this policy gap may have adverse consequences for the future of rivers and associated ES.

Impacts of integrated response options on

In addition to evaluating the importance of our response options 
for climate mitigation, adaptation, land degradation, desertification 
and food security, it is also necessary to pay attention to other co-
benefits and trade-offs that may be associated with these responses. 
How the different options impact progress toward the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) can be a useful shorthand for looking 
at the social impacts of these response options. Similarly, looking 
at how these response options increase or decrease the supply 
of ecosystem services/Nature’s Contributions to People (NCP) 
(see Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 6) can be a useful shorthand 
for a more comprehensive environmental impact beyond climate 
and land. Such evaluations are important as response options may 
lead to unexpected trade-offs with social goals (or potential co-
benefits) and impacts on important environmental indicators such 
as water or biodiversity. Similarly, there may be important synergies 
and co-benefits associated with some response options that may 
increase their cost-effectiveness or attractiveness. As we note in 
Section 6.4.4, many of these synergies are not automatic, and are 
dependent on well-implemented and coordinated activities in 
appropriate environmental contexts (Section 6.4.4.1), often requiring 
institutional and enabling conditions for success and participation of 
multiple stakeholders (Section 6.4.4.3). 
In the following sections and tables, we evaluate each response 
option against 17 SDGs and 18 NCPs. Some of the SDG categories 
appear similar to each other, such as SDG 13 on ‘climate action’ and 
an NCP titled ‘climate regulation’. However, SDG 13 includes targets 
for both mitigation and adaptation, so options were weighed by 
whether they were useful for one or both. On the other hand, the NCP 
‘regulation of climate’ does not include an adaptation component, 
and refers specifically to ‘positive or negative effects on emissions 
of GHGs and positive or negative effects on biophysical feedbacks 
from vegetation cover to atmosphere, such as those involving 
albedo, surface roughness, long-wave radiation, evapotranspiration 
(including moisture-recycling) and cloud formation or direct and 
indirect processes involving biogenic volatile organic compounds 
(BVOC), and regulation of aerosols and aerosol precursors by 
terrestrial plants and phytoplankton’ (Díaz et al. 2018).
In all tables, colours represent the direction of impact: positive (blue) 
or negative (brown), and the scale of the impact (dark colours for large 
impact and/or strong evidence to light colours for small impact and/
or less certain evidence). Supplementary tables show the values and 
references used to define the colour coding used in all tables. In cases 
where there is no evidence of an interaction, or at least no literature on 
such interactions, the cell is left blank. In cases where there are both 
positive and negative interactions and the literature is uncertain about 
the overall impact, a note appears in the box. In all cases, many of 
these interactions are contextual, or the literature only refers to certain 
8 
The exception is NCP 6, regulation of ocean acidification, which is by itself an indirect impact. Any option that sequesters CO2 would lower the atmospheric CO2 
concentration, which then indirectly increases the seawater pH. Therefore, any action that directly increases the amount of sequestered carbon is noted in this column, but 
not any action that avoids land-use change and, therefore, indirectly avoids CO2 emissions. 
co-benefits in specific regions or ecosystems, so readers are urged to 
consult the supplementary tables for the specific caveats that may apply.
6.4.3.1 
Impacts of integrated response options on NCP
Tables 6.70–6.72 summarise the impacts of the response options 
on NCP supply. Examples of synergies between response options 
and NCP include positive impacts on habitat maintenance (NCP 1) 
from activities like invasive species management and agricultural 
diversification. For the evaluation process, we considered that NCP 
are about ecosystems, therefore options which may have overall 
positive effects, but which are not ecosystem-based are not included; 
for example, improved food transport and distribution could reduce 
ground-level ozone and thus improve air quality, but this is not an 
ecosystem-based NCP. Similarly, energy-efficiency measures would 
increase energy availability, but the ‘energy’ NCP refers specifically 
to biomass-based fuel provisioning. This necessarily means that the 
land management options have more direct NCP effects than the 
value chain or governance options, which are less ecosystem focused.
In evaluating NCP, we have also tried to avoid ‘indirect’ effects – 
that is, a response option might increase household income which 
could then be invested in habitat-saving actions, or dietary change 
would lead to conservation of natural areas, which would then lead 
to increased water quality. Similarly, material substitution would 
increase wood demand, which in turn might lead to deforestation, 
which might have water regulation effects. These can all be 
considered indirect impacts on NCP, which were not evaluated.8 
Instead, the assessment focuses as much as possible on direct effects 
only: for example, local seeds policies preserve local landraces, which 
directly contribute to ‘maintenance of genetic options’ for the future. 
Therefore, this NCP table is a conservative estimation of NCP effects; 
there are likely many more secondary effects, but they are too difficult 
to assess, or the literature is not yet complete or conclusive.
Further, many NCPs trade-off with one another (Rodríguez et  al. 
2006), so supply of one might lead to less availability of another – 
for example, use of ecosystems to produce bioenergy will likely lead 
to decreases in water availability if mono-cropped high-intensity 
plantations are used (Gasparatos et al. 2011).
Overall, several response options stand out as having co-benefits 
across 10 or more NCP with no adverse impacts, including: improved 
cropland management, agroforestry, forest management and 
forest restoration, increased soil organic content, fire management, 
restoration and avoided conversion of coastal wetlands, and use 
of local seeds. Other response options may have strengths in some 
NCP but require trade-offs with others. For example, reforestation 
and afforestation bring many positive benefits for climate and water 
quality but may trade-off with food production (Table 6.70). Several 
response options, including increased food productivity, bioenergy 
and BECCS, and some risk-sharing instruments, like crop insurance, 
have significant negative consequences across multiple NCPs.

6.4.3.2 
Impacts of integrated response options on the UN SDGs
Tables 6.73–6.75 summarise the impact of the integrated response 
options on the UN SDGs. Some of the synergies between response 
options and SDGs in the literature include positive poverty eradication 
impacts (SDG 1) from activities like improved water management or 
improved management of supply chains, or positive gender impacts 
(SDG 5) from livelihood diversification or use of local seeds. Because 
many land management options only produce indirect or unclear 
effects on SDGs, we did not include these where there was no 
literature. Therefore, the value chain and governance options appear 
to offer more direct benefits for SDG. 
However, it is noted that some SDG are internally difficult to 
assess because they contain many targets, not all of which could 
be evaluated (e.g., SDG 17 is about partnerships, but has targets 
ranging from foreign aid to debt restructuring, technology transfer 
to trade openness). Additionally, it is noted that some SDG contradict 
one another  – for example, SDG 9 to increase industrialisation 
and infrastructure and SDG 15 to improve life on land. More 
industrialisation is likely to lead to increased resource demands with 
negative effects on habitats. Therefore, a positive association on one 
SDG measure might be directly correlated with a negative measure on 
another, and the table needs to be read with caution for that reason. 
The specific caveats on each of these interactions can be found in the 
supplementary material tables in the Chapter 6 Appendix.
Overall, several response options have co-benefits across 10 or 
more SDGs with no adverse side effects on any SDG: increased 
food production, improved grazing land management, agroforestry, 
integrated water management, reduced post-harvest losses, 
sustainable sourcing, livelihood diversification and disaster risk 
management. Other response options may have strengths in 
some SDGs but require trade-offs with others. For example, use of 
local seeds brings many positive benefits for poverty and hunger 
reduction, but may reduce international trade (SDG 17). Other 
response options like enhanced urban food systems, management 
of urban sprawl, or management of supply chains are generally 
positive for many SDGs but may trade-off with one, like clean water 
(SDG 6) or decent work (SDG 8), as they may increase water use 
or slow economic growth. Several response options, including 
avoidance of grassland conversion, reduced deforestation and forest 
degradation, reforestation and afforestation, biochar, restoration and 
avoided conversion of peatlands and coastlands, have trade-offs 
across multiple SDGs, primarily as they prioritise land health over 
food production and poverty eradication. Several response options 
such as bioenergy and BECCS and some risk-sharing instruments, 
such as crop insurance, trade-off over multiple SDG with potentially 
significant adverse consequences. 
Overall, across categories of SDG and NCPs; 17 of 40 options deliver 
co-benefits or no adverse side effects for the full range of NCPs and 
SDGs. This includes most agriculture- and soil-based land management 
options, many ecosystem-based land management options, forest 
management, reduced post-harvest losses, sustainable sourcing, 
improved energy use in food systems, and livelihood diversification. 
Only three options (afforestation, bioenergy and BECCS and some 
types of risk-sharing instruments, such as crop insurance) have 
potentially adverse side effects for five or more NCPs or SDGs.

6.4.4 
Opportunities for implementing 
integrated response options
6.4.4.1 
Where can the response options be applied?
As shown in Section 6.1.3, a large part of the land area is exposed to 
overlapping land challenges, especially in villages, croplands and 
rangelands. The deployment of land management responses may vary 
with local exposure to land challenges. For instance, with croplands 
exposed to a combination of land degradation, food insecurity and 
climate change adaptation challenges, maximising the co-benefits of 
land management responses would require selecting responses 
having only co-benefits for these three overlapping challenges, as well 
as for climate change mitigation, which is a global challenge. Based 
on these criteria, Figure 6.6 shows the potential deployment area of 
land management responses across land-use types (or anthromes).
Figure 6.6 |  Potential deployment area of land management responses (see Table 6.1) across land-use types (or anthromes, see Section 6.3), when 
selecting responses having only co-benefits for local challenges and for climate change mitigation and no large adverse side effects on global food 
security. See Figure 6.2 for the criteria used to map challenges considered (desertification, land degradation, climate change adaptation, chronic undernourishment, biodiversity, 
groundwater stress and water quality). No response option was identified for barren lands.
Land management responses having co-benefits across the range of 
challenges, including climate change mitigation, could be deployed 
between one land-use type (coastal wetlands, peatlands, forest 
management and restoration, reforestation) and five (increased soil 
organic carbon) or six (fire management) land-use types (Figure 6.6). 
Fire management and increased soil organic carbon have a large 
potential since they could be deployed with mostly co-benefits and few 
adverse effects over 76% and 58% of the ice-free land area. In contrast, 
other responses have a limited area-based potential due to biophysical 
constraints (e.g., limited extent of organic soils and of coastal wetlands 
for conservation and restoration responses), or due to the occurrence 
of adverse effects. Despite strong co-benefits for climate change 
mitigation, the deployment of bioenergy and BECCS would have co-
benefits on only 9% of the ice-free land area (Figure 6.6), given adverse 
effects of this response option for food security, land degradation, 
climate change adaptation and desertification (Tables 6.62–6.69).
Without including the global climate change mitigation challenge, 
there are up to five overlapping challenges on lands that are not barren 
(Figure 6.7A, calculated from the overlay of individual challenges 
shown in Figure 6.2) and up to nine land management response 
options having only co-benefits for these challenges and for climate 
change mitigation (Figure 6.7B). Across countries, the mean number of 
land management response options with mostly co-benefits declines 
(p<0.001, Spearman rank order correlation) with the mean number 
of land challenges. Hence, the higher the number of land challenges 
per country, the fewer the land management response options having 
only co-benefits for the challenges encountered.
Enabling conditions (see Section 6.1.2.2) for the implementation of 
land management responses partly depend on human development 
(economics, health and education) as estimated by a country scale 
composite index, the Human Development Index (HDI) (UNDP 
2018) (Figure 6.7C). Across countries, HDI is negatively correlated 
(p<0.001, Spearman rank order correlation) with the mean number 
of land challenges. Therefore, on a global average, the higher the 
number of local challenges faced, the fewer the land management 
responses having only co-benefits, and the lower the human 
development (Figure 6.7) that could favour the implementation of 
these responses.

Interlinkages and response options in future scenarios
This section assesses more than 80 articles quantifying the effect of 
various response options in the future, covering a variety of response 
options and land-based challenges. These studies cover spatial scales 
ranging from global (Popp et al. 2017; Fujimori et al. 2019) to regional 
(Calvin et al. 2016a; Frank et al. 2015) to country level (Gao and 
Bryan 2017; Pedercini et al. 2018). This section focuses on models 
that can quantify interlinkages between response options, including 
agricultural economic models, land system models, and Integrated 
Assessment Models (IAMs). The IAM and non-IAM literature, 
however, is also categorised separately to elucidate what is and is 
not included in global mitigation scenarios, like those included in 
the SR15. Results from bottom-up studies and models (e.g., Griscom 
et al. 2017) are assessed in Sections 6.2–6.3.
Response options in future scenarios
More than half of the 40 land-based response options discussed in this 
chapter are represented in global IAMs models used to develop and 
analyse future scenarios, either implicitly or explicitly (Table 6.76). For 
example, all IAMs include improved cropland management, either 
explicitly through technologies that improve nitrogen use efficiency 
(Humpenöder et al. 2018) or implicitly through marginal abatement 
cost curves that link reductions in nitrous oxide emissions from crop 
production to carbon prices (most other models). 
However, the literature discussing the effect of these response 
options on land-based challenges is more limited (Table 6.76). 
There are 57 studies (43 IAM studies) that articulate the effect of 
response options on mitigation, with most including bioenergy and 
BECCS or a combination of reduced deforestation, reforestation, and 
afforestation; 37 studies (21 IAM studies) discuss the implications 
of response options on food security, usually using food price as 
a  metric. While a small number of non-IAM studies examine the 
effects of response options on desertification (three studies) and land 
degradation (five studies), no IAM studies were identified. However, 
some studies quantify these challenges indirectly using IAMs, either 
via climate outputs from the representative concentration pathways 
(RCPs) (Huang et  al. 2016) or by linking IAMs to other land and 
ecosystem models (Ten Brink et al. 2018; UNCCD 2017).
For many of the scenarios in the literature, land-based response 
options are included as part of a suite of mitigation options (Popp 
et  al. 2017; Van Vuuren et  al. 2015). As a result, it is difficult to 
isolate the effect of an individual option on land-related challenges. 
A few studies focus on specific response options (Calvin et al. 2014; 
Popp et al. 2014; Kreidenweis et al. 2016; Humpenöder et al. 2018), 
quantifying the effect of including an individual option on a variety 
of sustainability targets.

Interactions and interlinkages between response options
The effect of response options on desertification, land degradation, 
food security, biodiversity, and other SDGs depends strongly on which 
options are included, and the extent to which they are deployed. For 
example, Sections 2.6 and 6.3.6, and Cross-Chapter Box 7 note that 
bioenergy and BECCS has a large mitigation potential, but could 
potentially have adverse side effects for land degradation, food 
security, and other SDGs. Global modelling studies demonstrate that 
these effects are dependent on scale. Increased use of bioenergy can 
result in increased mitigation (Figure 6.8, panel A) and reduced climate 
change, but can also lead to increased energy cropland expansion 
(Figure 6.8, panel B), and increased competition for land, resulting 
in increased food prices (Figure 6.8, panel C). However, the exact 
relationship between bioenergy deployment and each sustainability 
target depends on a number of other factors, including the feedstock 
used, the underlying socio-economic scenario, assumptions about 
technology and resource base, the inclusion of other response 
options, and the specific model used (Calvin et al. 2014; Clarke et al. 
2014; Popp et al. 2014, 2017; Kriegler et al. 2014).
The previous sections have examined the effects of individual land-
response options on multiple challenges. A number of studies using 
global modelling and analyses have examined interlinkages and 
interaction effects among land response options by incrementally 
adding or isolating the effects of individual options. Most of these 
studies focus on interactions with bioenergy and BECCS (Table 6.77). 
Adding response options that require land (e.g., reforestation, 
afforestation, reduced deforestation, avoided grassland conversion, 
or biodiversity conservation) results in increased food prices 
(Calvin et  al. 2014; Humpenöder et  al. 2014; Obersteiner et  al. 
2016; Reilly  et  al.  2012) and potentially increased temperature 
through biophysical climate effects (Jones et  al. 2013). However, 
this combination can result in reduced water consumption (Hejazi 
et  al. 2014b), reduced cropland expansion (Calvin et  al. 2014; 
Humpenöder et al. 2018), increased forest cover (Calvin et al. 2014; 
Humpenöder et al. 2018; Wise et al. 2009) and reduced biodiversity 
loss (Pereira et al. 2010), compared to scenarios with bioenergy and 
BECCS alone. While these options increase total mitigation, they 
reduce mitigation from bioenergy and BECCS as they compete for 
the same land (Wu et al. 2019; Baker et al. 2019; Calvin et al. 2014; 
Humpenöder et al. 2014). 
The inclusion of land-sparing options (e.g., dietary change, increased 
food productivity, reduced food waste, management of supply chains) 
in addition to bioenergy and BECCS results in reduced food prices, 
reduced agricultural land expansion, reduced deforestation, reduced 
mitigation costs, reduced water use, and reduced biodiversity loss 
(Bertram et al. 2018; Wu et al. 2019; Obersteiner et al. 2016; Stehfest 
et  al. 2009; Van Vuuren et  al. 2018). These options can increase 
bioenergy potential, resulting in increased mitigation than from 
bioenergy and BECCS alone (Wu et al. 2019; Stehfest et al. 2009; 
Favero and Massetti 2014).
Other combinations of land response options create synergies, 
alleviating land pressures. The inclusion of increased food productivity 
and dietary change can increase mitigation, reduce cropland use, 
reduce water consumption, reduce fertiliser application, and reduce 
biodiversity loss (Springmann et al. 2018; Obersteiner et al. 2016). 
Similarly, improved livestock management, combined with increased 
food productivity, can reduce agricultural land expansion (Weindl 
et  al. 2017). Reducing disturbances (e.g., fire management) in

combination with afforestation can increase the terrestrial carbon 
sink, resulting in increased mitigation potential and reduced 
mitigation cost (Le Page et al. 2013).
Studies including multiple land response options often find that the 
combined mitigation potential is not equal to the sum of individual 
mitigation potential as these options often share the same land. For 
example, including both afforestation and bioenergy and BECCS 
results in a cumulative reduction in GHG emissions of 1200 GtCO2 
between 2005 and 2100, which is much lower than the sum of 
the contributions of bioenergy (800 GtCO2) and afforestation 
(900 GtCO2) individually (Humpenöder et al. 2014). More specifically, 
Baker et al. (2019) find that woody bioenergy and afforestation are 
complementary in the near term, but become substitutes in the 
long term, as they begin to compete for the same land. Similarly, 
the combined effect of increased food productivity, dietary change 
and reduced waste on GHG emissions is less than the sum of the 
individual effects (Springmann et al. 2018).

d Includes changes in water use or scarcity, fertiliser use, or biodiversity.
Land-related response options can also interact with response options 
in other sectors. For example, limiting deployment of a mitigation 
response option will either result in increased climate change or 
additional mitigation in other sectors. A number of studies have 
examined limiting bioenergy and BECCS. Some such studies show 
increased emissions (Reilly et al. 2012). Other studies meet the same 
climate goal, but reduce emissions elsewhere via reduced energy 
demand (Grubler et al. 2018; Van Vuuren et al. 2018), increased fossil 
carbon capture and storage (CCS), nuclear energy, energy efficiency 
and/or renewable energy (Van Vuuren et al. 2018; Rose et al. 2014; 
Calvin et al. 2014; Van Vuuren et al. 2017b), dietary change (Van 
Vuuren et al. 2018), reduced non-CO2 emissions (Van Vuuren et al. 
2018), or lower population (Van Vuuren et al. 2018). The co-benefits 
and adverse side effects of non-land mitigation options are discussed

in SR15, Chapter 5. Limitations on bioenergy and BECCS can result 
in increases in the cost of mitigation (Kriegler et al. 2014; Edmonds 
et  al. 2013). Studies have also examined limiting CDR, including 
reforestation, afforestation, and bioenergy and BECCS (Kriegler et al. 
2018a,b). These studies find that limiting CDR can increase mitigation 
costs, increase food prices, and even preclude limiting warming to 
less than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels (Kriegler et al. 2018a,b; 
Muratori et al. 2016). 
In some cases, the land challenges themselves may interact with 
land-response options. For example, climate change could affect the 
production of bioenergy and BECCS. A few studies examine these 
effects, quantifying differences in bioenergy production (Calvin et al. 
2013; Kyle et al. 2014) or carbon price (Calvin et al. 2013) as a result 
of climate change. Kyle et  al. (2014) find increase in bioenergy 
production due to increases in bioenergy yields, while Calvin et al. 
(2013) find declines in bioenergy production and increases in carbon 
price due to the negative effects of climate on crop yield.
Gaps in the literature 
Not all of the response options discussed in this chapter are included 
in the assessed literature, and many response options are excluded 
from the IAM models. The included options (e.g., bioenergy and 
BECCS; reforestation) are some of the largest in terms of mitigation 
potential (see Section 6.3). However, some of the options excluded also 
have large mitigation potential. For example, biochar, agroforestry, 
restoration/avoided conversion of coastal wetlands, and restoration/
avoided conversion of peatland all have mitigation potential of about 
1 GtCO2 yr–1 (Griscom et al. 2017). Additionally, quantifications of 
and response options targeting land degradation and desertification 
are largely excluded from the modelled studies, with a few notable 
exceptions (Wolff et al. 2018; Gao and Bryan 2017; Ten Brink et al. 
2018; UNCCD 2017). Finally, while a large number of papers have 
examined interactions between bioenergy and BECCS and other 
response options, the literature examining other combinations of 
response options is more limited.
6.4.4.3 
Resolving challenges in response 
option implementation
The 40 response options assessed in this chapter face a variety of 
barriers to implementation that require action across multiple actors 
to overcome (Section 6.4.1). Studies have noted that, while adoption 
of response options by individuals may depend on individual assets 
and motivation, larger structural and institutional factors are almost 
always equally important if not more so (Adimassu et  al. 2016; 
Djenontin et al. 2018), though harder to capture in research variables 
(Schwilch et al. 2014). These institutional and governance factors can 
create an enabling environment for sustainable land management 
(SLM) practices, or challenges to their adoption (Adimassu et  al. 
2013). Governance factors include the institutions that manage rules 
and policies, the social norms and collective actions of participants 
(including civil society actors and the private sector), and the 
interactions between them (Ostrom 1990; Huntjens et al. 2012; Davies 
2016). Many of Ostrom’s design principles for successful governance 
can be applied to response options for SLM; these principles are: 
(i) clearly defined boundaries, (ii) understanding of both benefits and 
costs, (iii) collective choice arrangements, (iv) monitoring, (v) graduated 
sanctions, (vi) conflict-resolution mechanisms, (vii) recognition of 
rights, and (viii) nested (multi-scale) approaches. Unfortunately, studies 
of many natural resources and land management policy systems – in 
particular, in developing countries – often show the opposite: a lack 
of flexibility, strong hierarchical tendencies, and a lack of local 
participation in institutional frameworks (Ampaire et al. 2017). Analysis 
of government effectiveness (GE) – defined as quality of public services, 
policy formulation and implementation, civil service and the degree 
of its independence from political pressures, as well as credibility 
of the government’s commitment to its policies (Kaufmann et  al. 
2010) – has been shown to play a key role in land management. GE 
mediates land-user actions on land management and investment, and 
government policies and laws can help land users adopt sustainable 
land management practices (Nkonya et al. 2016) (Figure 6.9).
It is simply not a matter of putting the ‘right’ institutions or policies 
in place, however, as governance can be undermined by inattention 
to power dynamics (Fabinyi et al. 2014). Power shapes how actors 
gain access and control over resources, and negotiate, transform and 
adopt certain response options or not. These variable dynamics of 
power between different levels and stakeholders have an impact on 
the ability to implement different response options. The inability of 
many national governments to address social exclusion in general 
will have an effect on the implementation of many response options. 
Further, response options themselves can become avenues for actors 
to exert power claims over others (Nightingale 2017). For example, 
there have been many concerns that reduced deforestation and 
forest degradation projects run the risk of reversing trends towards 
decentralisation in forest management and creating new power 
disparities between the state and local actors (Phelps et al. 2010). 
Below we assess how two important factors – the involvement of 
stakeholders, and the coordination of action across scales – will help 
in moving from response options to policy implementation, a theme 
Chapter 7 takes up in further detail.
Involvement of stakeholders
A wide range of stakeholders are necessary for successful land, 
agricultural and environmental policy, and implementing response 
options requires that a range of actors, including businesses, 
consumers, land managers, indigenous peoples and local 
communities, scientists, and policymakers work together for success. 
Diverse stakeholders have a particularly important role to play in 
defining problems, assessing knowledge and proposing solutions 
(Stokes et al. 2006; Phillipson et al. 2012). Lack of connection between 
science knowledge and on-the-ground practice has hampered 
adoption of many response options in the past; simply presenting 
‘scientifically’ derived response options is not enough (Marques et al. 
2016). For example, the importance of recognising and incorporating 
local knowledge and indigenous knowledge is increasingly 
emphasised in successful policy implementation (see Cross-Chapter 
Box 13 in Chapter 7), as local practices of water management, soil 
fertility management, improved grazing, restoration and sustainable 
management of forests are often well-aligned with response options 
assessed by scientists (Marques et al. 2016).

Stakeholder engagement is an important approach for successful 
environmental and climate policy and planning. Tools such as 
stakeholder mapping, in which affected and interested parties are 
identified and described in terms of their interrelationships and 
current or future objectives and aspirations, and scenario-based 
stakeholder engagement, which combines stakeholder analysis with 
climate scenarios, are increasingly being applied to facilitate better 
planning outcomes (Tompkins et  al. 2008; Pomeroy and Douvere 
2008; Star et al. 2016). Facilitated dialogues early in design processes 
have shown good success in bringing multiple and sometimes 
conflicting stakeholders to the table to discuss synergies and trade-
offs around policy implementation (Gopnik et al. 2012). Knowledge 
exchange, social learning, and other concepts are also increasingly 
being incorporated into understanding how to facilitate sustainable 
land management (Djenontin et al. 2018), as evidence suggests that 
negotiating the complexity of socio-ecological systems (SES) requires 
flexible learning arrangements, in particular for multiple stakeholders 
(Gerlak and Heikkila 2011; Armitage et  al. 2018; Heikkila and 
Gerlak 2018). Social learning has been defined as ‘a  change in 
understanding and skills that becomes situated in groups of actors/
communities of practice through social interactions,’ (Albert et  al. 
2012), and social learning is often linked with attempts to increase 
levels of participation in decision-making, from consultation to more 
serious community control (Collins and Ison 2009; McCrum et  al. 
2009). Learning also facilitates responses to emerging problems 
and helps actors in SESs grapple with complexity. One outcome of 
learning can be adaptive risk management (ARM), in which ‘one 
takes action based on available information, monitors what happens, 
learns from the experience and adjusts future actions based on what 
has been learnt’ (Bidwell et al. 2013). Suggestions to facilitate social 
learning, ARM, and decision-making include extending science-policy 
networks and using local bridging organisations, such as extension 
services, for knowledge co-production (Bidwell et al. 2013; Böcher 
and Krott 2014; Howarth and Monasterolo 2017) (see further 
discussion in Chapter 7, Section 7.5).
Ensuring that women are included as key stakeholders in response 
option implementation is also important, as gender norms and roles 
affect vulnerability and access to resources, and gender inequality 
limits the possible range of responses for adoption by women 
(Lambrou and Piana 2006). For example, environmental change may 
increase women’s workload as their access to natural resources may 
decline, or they may have to take up low-wage labour if agriculture 
becomes unsuitable in their local areas under climate change 
(Nelson et al. 2002). Every response option considered in this chapter 
potentially has a gender dimension to it that needs to be taken into 
consideration (Tables 6.73–6.75 note how response options intersect 
with SDG 5 Gender Equality); for example, to address food security 
through sustainable intensification will clearly have to address female 
farmers in Africa (Kondylis et  al. 2016; Garcia and Wanner 2017) 
(for further information, see Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 7).

Challenges of coordination
Coordinated action to implement the response options will be 
required across a range of actors, including business, consumers, 
land managers, indigenous peoples and local communities and 
policymakers to create enabling conditions. Conjoining response 
options to maximise social, climatic and environmental benefits will 
require framing of such actions as strong pathways to sustainable 
development (Ayers and Dodman 2010). As the chapter has pointed 
out, there are many potential options for synergies, especially 
among several response options that might be applied together 
and in coordination with one another (such as dietary change and 
improved land management measures). This coordination will help 
ensure that synergies are met and trade-offs minimised, but this 
will require deliberate coordination across multiple scales, actors 
and sectors. For example, there are a variety of response options 
available at different scales that could form portfolios of measures 
applied by different stakeholders from farm to international scales. 
Agricultural diversification and use of local seeds by smallholders 
can be particularly useful poverty eradication and biodiversity 
conservation measures, but are only successful when higher scales, 
such as national and international markets and supply chains, also 
value these goods in trade regimes, and consumers see the benefits 
of purchasing these goods. However, the land and food sectors 
face particular challenges of institutional fragmentation, and often 
suffer from a lack of engagement between stakeholders at different 
scales (Biermann et al. 2009; Deininger et al. 2014) (see Chapter 7, 
Section 7.6.2). 
Many of the response options listed in this chapter could be 
potentially implemented as ‘community-based’ actions, including 
community-based reforestation, community-based insurance, or 
community-based disaster risk management. Grounding response 
options in community approaches aims to identify, assist and 
implement activities ‘that strengthen the capacity of local people to 
adapt to living in a riskier and less predictable climate’ (Ayers and 
Forsyth 2009). Research shows that people willingly come together 
to provide mutual aid and protection against risk, to manage 
natural resources, and to work cooperatively to find solutions to 
environmental provisioning problems. Some activities that fall under 
this type of collective action include the creation of institutions or 
rules, working cooperatively to manage a resource by restricting 
some activities and encouraging others, sharing information to 
improve public goods, or mobilising resources (such as capital) to 
fix a collective problem (Ostrom 2000; Poteete and Ostrom 2004), 
or engagement in participatory land-use planning (Bourgoin 2012; 
Evers and Hofmeister 2011). These participatory processes ‘are likely 
to lead to more beneficial environmental outcomes through better 
informed, sustainable decisions, and win-win solutions regarding 
economic and conservation objectives’ (Vente et  al. 2016), and 
evaluations of community-based response options have been 
generally positive (Karim and Thiel 2017; Tompkins and Adger 2004). 
Agrawal (2001) has identified more than 30 different indicators 
that have been important in understanding who undertakes 
collective action for the environment, including: the size of the 
group undertaking action; the type and distribution of the benefits 
from the action; the heterogeneity of the group; the dependence of 
the group on these benefits; the presence of leadership; presence 
of social capital and trust; and autonomy and independence to 
make and enforce rules. Alternatively, when households expect the 
government to undertake response actions, they have less incentive 
to join in collective action, as the state role has ‘crowded out’ local 
cooperation (Adger 2009). High levels of social trust and capital can 
increase willingness of farmers to engage in response options, such 
as improved soil management or carbon forestry (Stringer et al. 2012; 
Lee 2017), and social capital helps with connectivity across levels 
of SESs (Brondizio et al. 2009). Dietz et al. (2013) lay out important 
policy directions for more successful facilitation of collective action 
across scales and stakeholders. These include: providing information; 
dealing with conflict; inducing rule compliance; providing physical, 
technical or institutional infrastructure; and being prepared for 
change. The adoption of participatory protocols and structured 
processes to select response options together with stakeholders 
will likely lead to greater success in coordination and participation 
(Bautista et al. 2017; Franks 2010; Schwilch et al. 2012a).
However, wider adoption of community-based approaches is 
potentially hampered by several factors, including the fact that most 
are small-scale (Forsyth 2013; Ensor et al. 2014) and it is often unclear 
how to assess criteria of success (Forsyth 2013). Others also caution 
that community-based approaches often are not able to adequately 
address the key drivers of vulnerability such as inequality and uneven 
power relations (Nagoda and Nightingale 2017). 
Moving from response options to policies
Chapter 7 discusses in further depth the risks and challenges 
involved in formulating policy responses that meet the demands 
for sustainable land management and development outcomes, such 
as food security, community adaptation and poverty alleviation. 
Table 7.1 in Chapter 7 maps how specific response options might 
be turned into policies; for example, to implement a response 
option aimed at agricultural diversification, a range of policies from 
elimination of agricultural subsidies (which might favour single 
crops) to environmental farm programmes and agro-environmental 
payments (to encourage alternative crops). Oftentimes, any 
particular response option might have a variety of potential policy 
pathways that might address different scales or stakeholders or take 
on different aspects of coordination and integration (Section 7.6.1). 
Given the unique challenges of decision-making under uncertainty 
in future climate scenarios, Chapter 7 particularly discusses the need 
for flexible, iterative, and adaptive processes to turn response options 
into policy frameworks.

Future development of socio-economic factors and policies influence the evolution of the land–climate system, among others, in terms 
of the land used for agriculture and forestry. Climate mitigation policies can also have a major impact on land use, especially in 
scenarios consistent with the climate targets of the Paris Agreement. This includes the use of bio-energy or CDR, such as bioenergy with 
carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and afforestation. Land-based mitigation options have implications for GHG fluxes, desertification, 
land degradation, food insecurity, ecosystem services and other aspects of sustainable development.
Shared Socio-economic Pathways
The five pathways are based on the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) (O’Neill et al. 2014; Popp et al. 2017; Riahi et al. 2017; 
Rogelj et al. 2018b) (Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1). SSP1 is a scenario with a broad focus on sustainability, including human 
development, technological development, nature conservation, globalised economy, economic convergence and early international 
cooperation (including moderate levels of trade). The scenario includes a peak and decline in population, relatively high agricultural 
yields and a move towards food produced in low-GHG emission systems (Van Vuuren et al. 2017b). Dietary change and reductions 
in food waste reduce agricultural demands, and effective land-use regulation enables reforestation and/or afforestation. SSP2 is 
a scenario in which production and consumption patterns, as well as technological development, follows historical patterns (Fricko 
et al. 2017). Land-based CDR is achieved through bioenergy and BECCS and, to a lesser degree, by afforestation and reforestation. 
SSP3 is a scenario with slow rates of technological change and limited land-use regulation. Agricultural demands are high due to 
material-intensive consumption and production, and barriers to trade lead to reduced flows for agricultural goods. In SSP3, forest 
mitigation activities and abatement of agricultural GHG emissions are limited due to major implementation barriers such as low 
institutional capacities in developing countries and delays as a consequence of low international cooperation (Fujimori et al. 2017). 
Emissions reductions are achieved primarily through the energy sector, including the use of bioenergy and BECCS. 
Policies in the Pathways
SSPs are complemented by a set of shared policy assumptions (Kriegler et al. 2014), indicating the types of policies that may be 
implemented in each future world. Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) represent the effect of these policies on the economy, energy 
system, land use and climate with the caveat that they are assumed to be effective or, in some cases, the policy goals (e.g., dietary 
change) are imposed rather than explicitly modelled. In the real world, there are various barriers that can make policy implementation 
more difficult (Section 7.4.9). These barriers will be generally higher in SSP3 than SSP1.
SSP1: A number of policies could support SSP1 in future, including: effective carbon pricing, emission trading schemes (including net CO2 
emissions from agriculture), carbon taxes, regulations limiting GHG emissions and air pollution, forest conservation (mix of land sharing 
and land sparing) through participation, incentives for ecosystem services and secure tenure, and protecting the environment, 
microfinance, crop and livelihood insurance, agriculture extension services, agricultural production subsidies, low export tax and 
import tariff rates on agricultural goods, dietary awareness campaigns, taxes on and regulations to reduce food waste, improved 
shelf life, sugar/fat taxes, and instruments supporting sustainable land management, including payment for ecosystem services, 
land-use zoning, REDD+, standards and certification for sustainable biomass production practices, legal reforms on land ownership 
and access, legal aid, legal education, including reframing these policies as entitlements for women and small agricultural producers 
(rather than sustainability) (Van Vuuren et al. 2017b; O’Neill et al. 2017) (Section 7.4). 
SSP2: The same policies that support SSP1 could support SSP2 but may be less effective and only moderately successful. Policies 
may be challenged by adaptation limits (Section 7.4.9), inconsistency in formal and informal institutions in decision-making 
(Section 7.5.1) or result in maladaptation (Section 7.4.7). Moderately successful sustainable land management policies result in some 
land competition. Land degradation neutrality is moderately successful. Successful policies include those supporting bioenergy and BECCS 
(Rao et al. 2017b; Fricko et al. 2017; Riahi et al. 2017) (Section 7.4.6). 
SSP3: Policies that exist in SSP1 may or may not exist in SSP3, and are ineffective (O’Neill et al. 2014). There are challenges to 
implementing these policies, as in SSP2. In addition, ineffective sustainable land management policies result in competition for 
land between agriculture and mitigation. Land degradation neutrality is not achieved (Riahi et al. 2017). Successful policies include 
those supporting bioenergy and BECCS (Kriegler et al. 2017; Fujimori et al. 2017; Rao et al. 2017b) (Section 7.4.6). Demand-side 
food policies are absent and supply-side policies predominate. There is no success in advancing land ownership and access policies 
for agricultural producer livelihood (Section 7.6.5).

Cross-Chapter Box 9 (continued)
Land-use and land-cover change
In SSP1, sustainability in land management, agricultural intensifi cation, production and consumption patterns result in reduced need 
for agricultural land, despite increases in per capita food consumption. This land can instead be used for reforestation, afforestation 
and bioenergy. In contrast, SSP3 has high population and strongly declining rates of crop yield growth over time, resulting in increased 
agricultural land area. SSP2 falls somewhere in between, with societal as well as technological development following historical 
patterns. Increased demand for land mitigation options such as bioenergy, reduced deforestation or afforestation decreases availability 
of agricultural land for food, feed and fi bre. In the climate policy scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement, bioenergy/BECCS and 
reforestation/afforestation play an important role in SSP1 and SSP2. The use of these options, and the impact on land, is larger in scenarios 
that limit radiative forcing in 2100 to 1.9 W m–2 than in the 4.5 W m–2 scenarios. In SSP3, the expansion of land for agricultural 
production implies that the use of land-related mitigation options is very limited, and the scenario is characterised by continued 
deforestation. 
Cross-Chapter Box 9, Figure 1 |  Changes in agriculture land (left), bioenergy cropland (middle) and forest (right) under three different SSPs 
(colours) and two different warming levels (rows). Agricultural land includes both pasture and cropland. Colours indicate SSPs, with SSP1 shown in green, 
SSP2 in yellow, and SSP3 in red. For each pathway, the shaded areas show the range across all IAMs; the line indicates the median across models. There is no SSP3 in 
the top row, as 1.9 W m–2 is infeasible in this world. Data is from an update of the Integrated Assessment Modelling Consortium (IAMC) Scenario Explorer developed 
for the SR15 (Huppmann et al. 2018; Rogelj et al. 2018a).
Implications for mitigation and other land challenges
The combination of baseline emissions development, technology options, and policy support makes it much easier to reach the climate 
targets in the SSP1 scenario than in the SSP3 scenario. As a result, carbon prices are much higher in SSP3 than in SSP1. In fact, the 1.9 
W m–2 target was found to be infeasible in the SSP3 world (Table 1 in Cross-Chapter Box 9). Energy system CO2 emissions reductions 
are greater in SSP3 than in SSP1 to compensate for the higher land-based CO2 emissions. 
Accounting for mitigation and socio-economics alone, food prices (an indicator of food insecurity) are higher in SSP3 than in SSP1 
and higher in the 1.9 W m–2 target than in the 4.5 W m–2 target (Table 1 in Cross-Chapter Box 9). Forest cover is higher in SSP1 than 
SSP3 and higher in the 1.9 W m–2 target than in the 4.5 W m–2 target. Water withdrawals and water scarcity are, in general, higher 
in SSP3 than SSP1 (Hanasaki et al. 2013; Graham et al. 2018) and higher in scenarios with more bioenergy (Hejazi et al. 2014b); 
however, these indicators have not been quantifi ed for the specifi c SSP-representative concentration pathways (RCP) combinations 
discussed here.

Cross-Chapter Box 9 (continued)
Climate change results in higher impacts and risks in the 4.5 W m–2 world than in the 1.9 W m–2 world for a given SSP and these risks 
are exacerbated in SSP3 compared to SSP1 and SSP2 due to the population’s higher exposure and vulnerability. For example, the risk 
of fire is higher in warmer worlds; in the 4.5 W m–2 world, the population living in fire prone regions is higher in SSP3 (646 million) 
than in SSP2 (560 million) (Knorr et al. 2016). Global exposure to multi-sector risk quadruples between 1.5°C11 and 3°C and is a factor 
of six higher in SSP3-3°C than in SSP1–1.5°C (Byers et al. 2018). Future risks resulting from desertification, land degradation and food 
insecurity are lower in SSP1 compared to SSP3 at the same level of warming. For example, the transition moderate-to-high risk of 
food insecurity occurs between 1.3 and 1.7°C for SSP3, but not until 2.5 to 3.5°C in SSP1 (Section 7.2).
Summary
Future pathways for climate and land use include portfolios of response and policy options. Depending on the response options 
included, policy portfolios implemented, and other underlying socio-economic drivers, these pathways result in different land-use 
consequences and their contribution to climate change mitigation. Agricultural area declines by more than 5 Mkm2 in one SSP but 
increases by as much as 5 Mkm2 in another. The amount of energy cropland ranges from nearly zero to 11 Mkm2, depending on the SSP 
and the warming target. Forest area declines in SSP3 but increases substantially in SSP1. Subsequently, these pathways have different 
implications for risks related to desertification, land degradation, food insecurity, and terrestrial GHG fluxes, as well as ecosystem 
services, biodiversity, and other aspects of sustainable development.

Pathways that limit radiative forcing in 2100 to 1.9 W m–2 result in median warming in 2100 to 1.5°C in 2100 (Rogelj et al. 2018b). Pathways limiting radiative forcing 
in 2100 to 4.5 W m–2 result in median warming in 2100 above 2.5°C (IPCC 2014).
6.4.5 
Potential consequences of delayed action
Delayed action, in terms of overall GHG mitigation across both land 
and energy sectors, as well as delayed action in implementing the 
specific response options outlined in this chapter, will exacerbate 
the existing land challenges due to the continued impacts of climate 
change and socio-economic and other pressures. It can decrease the 
potential of response options and increase the costs of deployment, 
and will deprive communities of immediate co-benefits, among 
other pressures. The major consequences of delayed action are 
outlined below.
Delayed action exposes vulnerable people to continued 
and increasing climate impacts: Slower or delayed action in 
implementing response options exacerbates existing inequalities and 
impacts. This will increase the number of people vulnerable to climate 
change, due to population increases and increasing climate impacts 
(IPCC 2018; AR 5). Future climate change will lead to exacerbation 
of the existing land challenges, increased pressure on agricultural 
livelihoods, potential for rapid land degradation, and millions 
more people exposed to food insecurity (Schmidhuber and Tubiello 
2007) (Chapters 3, 4 and 5). Delay can also bring political risks and 
significant social impacts, including risks to human settlements 
(particularly in coastal areas), large-scale migration, and conflict 
(Barnett and Adger 2007; Hsiang et al. 2013). Early action reducing 
vulnerability and exposure can create an opportunity for a virtual 
circle of benefits: increased resilient livelihoods, reduced degradation 
of land, and improved food security (Bohle et al. 1994). 
Delayed action increases requirements for adaptation: Failure 
to mitigate climate change will increase requirements for adaptation. 
For example, it is likely that by 2100 with no mitigation or adaptation, 
31–69 million people world-wide could be exposed to flooding 
(Rasmussen et al. 2017; IPCC SR15) (Chapter 3); such outcomes could 
be prevented with investments in both mitigation and adaptation 
now. Some specific response options (e.g., reduced deforestation 
and forest degradation, reduced peatland and wetland conversion) 
prevent further detrimental effects to the land surface; delaying 
these options could lead to increased deforestation, conversion, 
or degradation, serving as increased sources of GHGs and having 
concomitant negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services 
(Section 6.2). Response options aimed at land restoration and 
rehabilitation can serve as adaptation mechanisms for communities 
facing climatic stresses like precipitation variability and changes in 
land quality, as well as provide benefits in terms of mitigation. 
Delayed action increases response costs and reduces economic 
growth: Early action on reducing emissions through mitigation is 
estimated to result in smaller temperature increases as well as 
lower mitigation costs than delayed action (Sanderson et al. 2016; 
Luderer et al. 2013, 2018; Rose et al. 2017; Van Soest et al. 2017; 
Fujimori et  al. 2017). The cost of inaction to address mitigation, 
adaptation, and sustainable land use exceeds the cost of immediate 
action in most countries, depending on how damage functions and 
the social cost of carbon are calculated (Dell et  al. 2012; Moore 
and Diaz 2015). Costs of acting now would be one to two orders 
of magnitude lower than economic damages from delayed action, 
including damage to assets from climate impacts, as well as 
potentially reduced economic growth, particularly in developing 
countries (Luderer et al. 2016; Moore and Diaz 2015; Luderer et al. 
2013). Increased health costs and costs of energy (e.g., to run air-
conditioners to combat increased heat waves) in the US by the end of 
the century alone are estimated to range from 10–58% of US GDP in 
2010 (Deschênes and Greenstone 2011).

Delay also increases the costs of both mitigation and adaptation 
actions at later dates. In models of climate-economic interactions, 
deferral of emissions reduction now requires trade-offs leading 
to higher costs of several orders of magnitude and risks of higher 
temperatures in the longer term (Luderer et al. 2013). Further, the 
cost of action is likely to increase over time due to the increased 
severity of challenges in future scenarios. 
Conversely, timely implementation of response options brings 
economic benefits. Carbon pricing is one economic component 
to encourage adoption of response options (Jakob et  al. 2016), 
but carbon pricing alone can induce higher risk in comparison to 
other scenarios and pathways that include additional targeted 
sustainability measures, such as promotion of less material- and 
energy-intensive lifestyles and healthier diets, as noted in our 
response options (Bertram et al. 2018). While the short-term costs 
of deployment of actions may increase, better attainment of a broad 
set of sustainability targets can be achieved through these combined 
measures (Bertram et al. 2018).
There are also investments now that can lead to immediate savings 
in terms of avoided damages; for example, for each dollar spent on 
disaster risk management, countries accrue avoided disaster-related 
economic losses of 4 USD or more (Mechler 2016). While they can 
require upfront investment, the economic benefits of actions to 
ensure sustainable land management, such as increased soil organic 
carbon, can more than double the economic value of rangelands and 
improve crop yields (Chapter 4 and Section 6.2). 
Delayed action reduces future policy space and decreases 
efficacy of some response options: The potential for some response 
options decreases as climate change increases; for example, climate 
alters the sink capacity for soil and vegetation carbon sequestration, 
reducing the potential for increased soil organic carbon, afforestation 
and reforestation (Section 6.4.2). Additionally, climate change 
affects the productivity of bioenergy crops, influencing the potential 
mitigation of bioenergy and BECCS (Section 6.4.4).
For response options in the supply chain, demand-side management, 
and risk management, while the consequences of delayed action are 
apparent in terms of continued GHG emissions from drivers, the tools 
for response options are not made more difficult by delay and could 
be deployed at any time. Additionally, given increasing pressures 
on land as a consequence of delay, some policy response options 
may become more cost-effective while others become costlier. For 
example, over time, land-based mitigation measures like forest and 
ecosystem protection are likely to increase land scarcity, leading 
to higher food prices; while demand-side measures, like reduced-
impact diets and reducing waste, are less likely to raise food prices in 
economic models (Stevanović et al. 2017). 
For risk management, some response options provide timely and 
rapidly deployable solutions for preventing further problems, such as 
disaster risk management and risk-sharing instruments. For example, 
early warning systems serve multiple roles in protecting lives and 
property and helping people adapt to longer-term climate changes, 
and can be used immediately.
Delaying action can also result in problems of irreversibility 
of biophysical impacts and tipping points: Early action provides 
a potential way to avoid irreversibility – such as degradation of 
ecosystems that cannot be restored to their original baseline – 
and tipping points, whereby ecological or climate systems abruptly 
shift to a new state. Ecosystems, such as peatlands, are particularly 
vulnerable to irreversibility because of the difficulties of rewetting 
to original states (Section 6.2), and dryland grazing systems are 
vulnerable to tipping points when ground cover falls below 50%, 
after which productivity falls, infiltration declines, and erosion 
increases (Chapters 3 and 4). Further, tipping points can be especially 
challenging for human populations to adapt to, given the lack of prior 
experience with such system shifts (Kates et al. 2012; Nuttall 2012). 
Policy responses require lead time for implementation; delay 
makes this worse: For all the response options, particularly those 
that need to be deployed through policy implementation, there are 
unavoidable lags in this cycle. ‘Policy lags’, by which implementation 
is delayed by the slowness of the policy implementation cycle, are 
significant across many land-based, response options (Brown et al. 
2019). Further, the behavioural change necessary to achieve some 
demand-side and risk management response options often takes 
a long time, and delay only lengthens this process (Stern 1992; Steg 
and Vlek 2009). For example, actively promoting the need for healthier 
and more sustainable diets through individual dietary decisions is an 
important underpinning and enabling step for future changes, but is 
likely to be a slow-moving process, and delay in beginning will only 
exacerbate this. 
Delay can lead to lock-in: Delay in implementation can cause 
‘lock-in’ as decisions made today can constrain future development 
and pathways. For example, decisions made now on where to build 
infrastructure, make investments and deploy technologies, will have 
longer-term (decades-long) ramifications due to the inertia of capital 
stocks (Van Soest et al. 2017). In tandem, the vulnerability of the 
poor is likely to be exacerbated by climate change, creating a vicious 
circle of lock in whereby an increasing share of the dwindling carbon 
budget may be needed to assist with improved energy use for the 
poorest (Lamb and Rao 2015).
Delay can increase the need for widespread deployment of 
land-based mitigation (afforestation, BECCS) (IPCC 2018; 
Strefler et al. 2018): Further delays in mitigation could result in an 
increased need for carbon dioxide removal (CDR) options later; for 
example, delayed mitigation requires a 10% increase in cumulative 
CDR over the century (IPCC 2018). Similarly, strengthening near-
term mitigation effort can reduce the CDR requirements in 2100 by 
a factor of 2 to 8 (Strefler et al. 2018). Conversely, scenarios with 
limited CDR require earlier emissions reductions (Van Vuuren et al. 
2017b) and may make more stringent mitigation scenarios, like the 
1.5°C, infeasible (Kriegler et al. 2018a,b).

Frequently Asked Questions
FAQ 6.1 | 
What types of land-based options can help mitigate and adapt to climate change? 
Land-based options that help mitigate climate change are various and differ greatly in their potential. The options with moderate-
to-large mitigation potential, and no adverse side effects, include options that decrease pressure on land (e.g., by reducing the land 
needed for food production) and those that help to maintain or increase carbon stores both above-ground (e.g., forest measures, 
agroforestry, fire management) and below-ground (e.g., increased soil organic matter or reduced losses, cropland and grazing 
land management, urban land management, reduced deforestation and forest degradation). These options also have co-benefits 
for adaptation by improving health, increasing yields, flood attenuation and reducing urban heat island effects. Another group 
of practices aim at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emission sources, such as livestock management or nitrogen fertilisation 
management. Land-based options delivering climate change adaptation may be structural (e.g., irrigation and drainage systems, 
flood and landslide control), technological (e.g., new adapted crop varieties, changing planting zones and dates, using climate 
forecasts), or socio-economic and institutional (e.g., regulation of land use, associativity between farmers). Some adaptation 
options (e.g., new planting zones, irrigation) may have adverse side effects for biodiversity and water. Adaptation options may be 
planned, such as those implemented at regional, national or municipal level (top-down approaches), or autonomous, such as many 
technological decisions taken by farmers and local inhabitants. In any case, their effectiveness depends greatly on the achievement 
of resilience against extreme events (e.g., floods, droughts, heat waves, etc.).
FAQ 6.2 | 
 Which land-based mitigation measures could affect desertification, land 
degradation or food security?
Some options for mitigating climate change are based on increasing carbon stores, both above-ground and below-ground, so 
mitigation is usually related to increases in soil organic matter content and increased land cover by perennial vegetation. There is 
a direct relationship, with very few or no adverse side effects for prevention or reversal of desertification and land degradation and 
the achievement of food security. This is because desertification and land degradation are closely associated with soil organic matter 
losses and the presence of bare ground surfaces. Food security depends on the achievement of healthy crops and high and stable 
yields over time, which is difficult to achieve in poor soils that are low in organic matter.
FAQ 6.3 | 
What is the role of bioenergy in climate change mitigation, and what are its challenges?
Plants absorb carbon as they grow. If plant-based material (biomass) is used for energy, the carbon it absorbed from the atmosphere 
is released back. Traditional use of bioenergy for cooking and heating is still widespread throughout the world. Modern conversion 
to electricity, heat, gas and liquid fuels can reduce the need to burn fossil fuels and this can reduce GHG emissions, helping to 
mitigate climate change. However, the total amount of emissions avoided depends on the type of biomass, where it is grown, how 
it is converted to energy, and what type of energy source it displaces. Some types of bioenergy require dedicated land (e.g., canola 
for biodiesel, perennial grasses, short rotation woody crops), while others can be co-produced or use agricultural or industrial 
residues (e.g., residues from sugar and starch crops for ethanol, and manure for biogas). Depending on where, how, and the amount 
of bioenergy crops that are grown, the use of dedicated land for bioenergy could compete with food crops or other mitigation 
options. It could also result in land degradation, deforestation or biodiversity loss. In some circumstances, however, bioenergy can 
be beneficial for land, for example, by increasing soil organic carbon. The use of co-products and residues for bioenergy limits the 
competition for land with food but could result in land degradation if carbon and nutrient-rich material is removed that would 
otherwise be left on the land. On the other hand, the by-products of some bioenergy conversion processes can be returned to the 
land as a fertiliser and may have other co-benefits (e.g., reducing pollution associated with manure slurry).
