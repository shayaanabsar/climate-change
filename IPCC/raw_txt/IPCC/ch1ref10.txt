Some of these studies do analyse uncertainties, but emissions estimates in general are
very uncertain.  The overall magnitude of the emissions estimates that will be obtained
for some countries using the methods and assumptions outlined in this chapter is driven
by two key studies:
•
Rabchuk et al. (1991) report that emissions from gas production and
transportation in the former USSR is very high, about 3 to 7 per cent of total gas
production.  Recent visits to this region indicate that system construction,
maintenance, and operations may be consistent with high emissions rates (Craig,
1992).  However, a better quantitative evaluation is needed to validate the current
emissions estimates.
•
Barns and Edmonds (1990) report emissions from venting and flaring by region.
The emissions estimates for the OPEC countries are relatively high, and account for
most of the emissions from this category.  The safety concerns associated with
venting, and the value of re-injecting gas into oil reservoirs to maintain reservoir
pressures, would tend to render the high emissions estimates questionable.
Improved data are needed to resolve this question.
The adoption of emission factor estimates from US EPA (1992) for various regions also
adds uncertainty to the overall estimates.  US oil and gas production facilities and
refineries are subject to emission control requirements.  The US emission factors,
particularly for refining, may under-estimate emissions in other regions.  Nevertheless,
this may not be a significant global uncertainty since, if the emission factors for oil
production and oil refining were increased by a factor of 10 for the entire world, the
estimate of total global emissions would only increase by about 1 to 6 Tg for 1988.

Methane is by far the most important greenhouse gas emitted on a fugitive basis from oil
and gas activities.  However, other GHGs are clearly emitted and should be included in a
comprehensive national inventory.
After methane, the most significant fugitive emissions from oil and gas activities are of
non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs).  Oil and gas are largely composed
of organic compounds, and releases through evaporation or leakages are likely at all
stages wherever the fuels or their products come into contact with the atmosphere.
Fugitive emissions from refining, transport and distribution of oil products are a major
component of national NMVOC emissions in many countries.
The IPCC/OECD/IEA programme has not yet addressed the indirect GHGs (including
NMVOCs) in detail.  However, the Joint EMEP/CORINAIR Guidebook offers both a
simplified and a more detailed approach to the estimation of ozone precursors and SO2.
The relevant tables and accompanying text are summarised below.
National experts interested in including the other fugitive emissions of GHGs from oil
and natural gas systems should consult the existing literature which provides detailed
emission factors and procedures for calculating emissions.  Some key examples are:
•
Default Emission Factors Handbook (EEATF, 1992);
•
Proceedings of the TNO/EURASAP Workshop (TNO Inst. of Environmental
Sciences, 1993);
•
Atmospheric Emission Inventory Guidebook (Joint EMEP/CORINAIR, 1996);

Compounds. (Veldt, 1991);

A basic refinery converts crude petroleum into a variety of sub-products.  Principal
products of a refinery may include liquid fuels, coke, feedstocks and primary
petrochemicals (like ethylene).  This section covers basic refineries, not the synthesis of
petrochemicals.  Chemical production is included in Chapter 2, Industrial Processes,
whether or not the actual production takes place at a refinery or in a separate plant.
Storage and handling of intermediates and products may account for between 1 to 8 per
cent of  a country’s NMVOC emissions.  There are also significant non-combustion
emissions of SO2, NOx, and CO.
Refinery Operations
Refinery operations include separation processes (distillation and gas processing),
petroleum conversion processes (cracking, coking, catalytic reforming, alkylation,
polymerisation), petroleum treating processes (desulphurisation, chemical sweetening,
acid gas removal, deasphalting) and blending.
Vacuum distillation, catalytic cracking, thermal cracking, sweetening, blowdown systems,
sulphur recovery and asphalt blowing have been identified as being potentially significant
sources of SO2 and NMVOCs from these sources.  Storage and handling of petroleum
products will lead to NMVOC emissions.

A simple estimation can be made on the basis of throughput and single emission factors.
However in most cases more detailed information may be available and the more detailed
approach outlined in the Joint EMEP/CORINAIR Guidebook (1996) under SNAP code
40100 or in the following section here should be adopted.  This considers the actual
processes taking place in the refinery and the throughput of crude and products.  While
emission rates will depend on the specific process and equipment in a refinery, its state of
maintenance and the sulphur content of the crude oil, a very simple estimate can be made
on the basis of the throughput of crude oil and simple emission factors alone.  The default
emission factors are shown in Table 1-65.

Estimates range from 0.085 kg/m3 from the best West European refinery to 10 kg/m3 for
a Russian refinery.
In practice it may be possible to use a more detailed approach where some of the
makeup of the refinery is known or where only some of the emission activities are
known.  Some of  these constituent parts are outlined below as an alternative to the
above approach.

In the detailed methodology, emissions are calculated separately from sub processes in
the refinery.  The total emissions are the sum of the emissions from each individual sub
process.  The calculations should be based on plant specific data.

Emission factors for a petroleum refinery which uses a fluid catalytic cracking system are

Storage and handling (SNAP 40104)
Emissions of NMVOC result from evaporation from tanks during storage, displacement of
vapour during volume changes, loading and unloading and spillages.  Storage may occur at
a refinery or at separate locations.  Emissions depend on the type and state of the tanks.
Emission factors are suggested in Table I-68.  Where nothing is known the highest factor
should be used.  The activity statistic is the crude oil throughput of the refineries.

Further Work
At the end of the Experts’ Meeting on GHG Emissions from Fuel Combustion (Abingdon,
29-30 March 1996), experts were asked to identify areas for future work on emissions
from energy.  The subsequent list was then prioritised into short/medium-term activities
and longer-term activities.
Short to Medium term (1-3 years):
1. 
Perform sensitivity analysis to assess importance of emission factors for various
sectors.
2. 
Critically assess key emission factors found during sensitivity analysis, and key
calorific values and activity data.
3. 
Enhance the EDGAR emission factors that feed into the Tier I methodology with
information from US country studies and from other sources.
4. 
Critically compare IPCC emission factors and methodology with US EPA (1995) and
CORINAIR.
5. 
Perform a literature search on emission factors:
• 
Mobile sources in developing countries
• 
N2O (all sources)
• 
Biomass (especially fuelwood)
6. 
Perform more research on emission factors for developing countries, including
emission factors for biomass.
7. 
Enhance the section on fugitive emissions: coal mines (CH4), oil & gas industry (CH4
and NMVOC).
8. 
Analyse double counting with Industrial Processes section of IPCC Guidelines.  Re-
evaluate the default carbon stored values provided in the Guidelines, including the
fate of carbon stored in petroleum products.
9. 
Add a category for non-fuel energy related emissions, such as from geothermal
energy, CH4 from flooding to create reservoirs, etc.
10. Evaluate the adequacy of guidelines.
11. Compare the results obtained by using Tier 1 and Tier 2 calculations for the non-
CO2 gases.
12. Investigate the possibility of reporting inventories and background information on
the Internet.
Long term:
1.
Develop/update software to support computation and reporting of both the Tier I
and Tier 2 approaches.
2.
Enhance reliability of biomass consumption figures.
3.
Perform statistical analysis of data reported, and validate results with globally
measured concentrations of all direct greenhouse gases.
