6 WASTEWATER TREATMENT AND 
DISCHARGE  
Users are expected to go to Mapping Tables in Annex 1, before reading this chapter. This is required to correctly 
understand both the refinements made and how the elements in this chapter relate to the corresponding chapter 
in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. 
6.1 
INTRODUCTION 
Wastewater can be a source of methane (CH4) when treated or disposed anaerobically or when dissolved CH4 
enters aerated treatment systems. It can also be a source of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Carbon dioxide (CO2) 
emissions from wastewater are not considered in the IPCC Guidelines because these are generally derived from 
modern (biogenic) organic matter in human excreta or food waste and should not be included in national total 
emissions. Appendix 6Ap.1 presents a discussion of non-biogenic (fossil) CO2 emissions from wastewater 
treatment and discharge, where fossil organic carbon is present in wastewater or treatment sludge. 
Wastewater originates from a variety of domestic, commercial and industrial sources and may be treated on site 
(uncollected), sewered to a centralised plant (collected) or disposed untreated nearby or via an outfall. Domestic 
wastewater is defined as wastewater from household water use, while industrial wastewater is from industrial 
practices only.1 Treatment and discharge systems can sharply differ between countries and for rural and urban 
areas. Also, treatment and discharge systems can differ for rural and urban users, and for urban high income and 
urban low-income users.  
Sewer systems may consist of networks of open channels or closed underground pipes. Occasional stagnant 
conditions and heat provide favourable anaerobic condition for methane generation in closed and open sewers. In 
urban areas in developing countries and some developed countries, sewer systems may consist of networks of 
open canals, gutters, and ditches, which are referred to as open sewers. These systems are subject to heating from 
the sun and the sewers may be stagnant allowing for anaerobic conditions to emit CH4 (Doorn et al. 1997). In 
most developed countries and in high-income urban areas in other countries, sewers are usually closed and 
underground. Wastewater in closed underground sewers likely generate CH4, but there are insufficient data 
available to quantify the emissions from these collection systems. However, research shows that significant 
amounts of CH4 can be formed within closed sewer collection systems and enters centralised wastewater 
treatment plants (WWTPs) as dissolved CH4 in the wastewater, where it is then emitted during treatment.  
The degree of wastewater treatment varies in most developing countries. In some cases, industrial wastewater is 
discharged directly into bodies of water, while major industrial facilities may have comprehensive in-plant 
treatment. Domestic wastewater is treated in centralised plants, pit latrines, septic systems or disposed of in 
unmanaged lagoons or waterways, via open or closed sewers. In some coastal cities domestic wastewater is 
discharged directly into the ocean. Pit latrines are lined or unlined holes of up to several metres deep, which may be 
fitted with a toilet for convenience. The pits are used alternatively, and the contents used as manure after few 
months’ usage. 
The most common wastewater treatment methods in developed countries are centralised aerobic wastewater 
treatment plants and lagoons for both domestic and industrial wastewater. To avoid high discharge fees or to 
meet regulatory standards, many large industrial facilities pre-treat their wastewater before releasing it into the 
sewage system. Domestic wastewater may also be treated in on-site septic systems. These are advanced systems 
that may treat wastewater from one or several households. They consist of an anaerobic underground tank and a 
drainage field for the treatment of effluent from the tank. Some developed countries continue to dispose of 
untreated domestic wastewater via an outfall or pipeline into a water body, such as the ocean.  
Centralised wastewater treatment methods can be classified as primary, secondary, and tertiary treatment. In 
primary treatment, physical barriers remove larger solids from the wastewater. Remaining particulates are then 
allowed to settle. Secondary treatment consists of a combination of biological processes that promote 
biodegradation of wastewater constituents by microorganisms. Secondary treatment processes include aerobic 
stabilisation ponds, trickling filters, and activated sludge processes, as well as anaerobic reactors and lagoons. 
Tertiary treatment processes are used to further purify the wastewater of pathogens, contaminants, and remaining 
 
1  Because the methodology is on a per person basis, emissions from commercial wastewater are estimated as part of domestic 
wastewater. To avoid confusion, the term municipal wastewater is not used in this text. Municipal wastewater is a mix of 
household, commercial and non-hazardous industrial wastewater, treated at wastewater treatment plants.

nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus compounds. This is achieved using one or a combination of processes 
that can include maturation/polishing ponds, biological processes, advanced filtration, carbon adsorption, ion 
exchange, and disinfection. 
Sludge is produced in all of the primary, secondary and tertiary stages of treatment. Sludge that is produced in 
primary treatment consists of solids that are removed from the wastewater. 
Sludge produced in secondary and tertiary treatment results from biological growth in the biomass, as well as the 
collection of small particles. This sludge must be treated further before it can be safely disposed of. Methods of 
sludge treatment include aerobic and anaerobic stabilisation (digestion), conditioning, centrifugation, composting, 
and drying. Some sludge is incinerated before land disposal. Emissions from anaerobic sludge digestion, where 
the digester’s primary use is for treatment of wastewater treatment solids, should be reported under Wastewater 
Treatment. Land disposal, composting, and incineration of sludge is considered in Volume 5, Section 2.3.2 in 
Chapter 2, Waste Generation, Composition, and Management Data, Section 3.2 in Chapter 3, Solid Waste 
Disposal, Section 4.1 in Chapter 4, Biological Treatment and Disposal, and Chapter 5, Incineration and Open 
Burning of Waste, respectively.  N2O emissions from sludge and wastewater spread on agricultural land are 
considered in Section 11.2, N2O emissions from managed soils, in Chapter 11, N2O Emissions from Managed 
Soils, and CO2 Emissions from Lime and Urea Application, in Volume 4 of the Agriculture, Forestry, and Other 
Land Use (AFOLU) Sector. 
Figure 6.1 from the 2006 IPCC Guidelines has been updated and simplified to show the different pathways for 
wastewater treatment and discharge, for wastewater that is not collected and for wastewater that is collected. The 
figure specifies whether the discharge or end use of the wastewater is reported in this chapter. Figure 6.1 
(Updated) also shows sludge treatment pathways in grey and clarifies whether the emissions are reported in this 
chapter. Table 6.1 has been updated to reflect the main wastewater treatment and discharge systems in developed 
and developing countries and their potential to emit CH4 and N2O.

1 For onsite sludge treatment, see Chapters 4 and 5 for emissions methodology, but note that emissions for onsite systems should be 
reported under the Wastewater Treatment and Discharge category. 
2 Facultative organisms can function in the presence or absence of molecular oxygen. In a facultative lagoon, the layer of water near the 
surface contains dissolved oxygen due to atmospheric reaeration and algal respiration, a condition that supports aerobic and facultative 
organisms. The bottom layer of the lagoon includes sludge deposits and supports anaerobic organisms. The intermediate anoxic layer–
the facultative zone–ranges from aerobic near the top to anaerobic at the bottom (US EPA 2002b). 
6.1.1 
Centralised treatment systems  
Centralised wastewater treatment systems may include a variety of treatment processes spanning the hierarchy of 
treatment levels. Primary treatment involves mechanical processes such as screening, grit removal and 
sedimentation. Secondary treatment involves biological processes in which microorganisms convert inorganic 
and organic nutrients into settleable solids which can be removed by sedimentation and degradation metabolites 
which are transferred to the atmosphere. Secondary biological treatment processes may be augmented with 
chemical disinfection. Commonly used secondary treatment processes include activated sludge, trickling filters 
and lagoons. In some countries simple disinfection process concludes tertiary treatment; however, elsewhere 
more advanced tertiary treatment involves the use of enhanced biological nutrient removal processes 
(nitrification–denitrification), and other advanced physical and chemical processes.  
Wastewater treatment processes can range from simple technologies such as lagooning and wetlands, to more 
technologically advanced treatment technology designed for stringent nutrient removal. Wetlands can be 
constructed or semi-natural systems and may be used as the primary method of wastewater treatment, or as a 
polishing treatment step following settling and biological treatment. Constructed wetlands develop natural 
processes that involve vegetation, soil, and associated microbial assemblages to trap and treat incoming 
contaminants through a combination of biodegradation, volatilisation, sorption and sedimentation process (IPCC 
2014). 
Sewer collection systems provide an environment conducive to the formation of CH4, which can be substantial 
depending on the configuration and operation of the collection system (Guisasola et al. 2008). Recent research 
has shown that at least a portion of CH4 formed with the collection system enters the centralised system where it 
contributes to CH4 emissions from the treatment system (Foley et al. 2015). Although there are insufficient data 
to quantify emissions directly from the sewer collection system, the emission factors presented for centralised 
treatment plants account for dissolved methane entering the treatment systems. 
Soluble organic matter is generally removed using biological processes in which microorganisms consume the 
organic matter for maintenance and growth. The resulting biomass (sludge) is removed from the effluent prior to 
discharge to receiving environments. Microorganisms can biodegrade soluble organic material in wastewater 
under aerobic and/or anaerobic conditions, where the latter condition produces CH4. During collection and 
treatment, wastewater may be accidentally or deliberately managed under anaerobic conditions. In addition, the 
sludge may be further biodegraded under aerobic or anaerobic conditions, such as with anaerobic digestion.   
The generation of N2O may also result from the treatment of domestic wastewater during both nitrification and 
denitrification of the nitrogen (N) present, usually in the form of urea, proteins, and ammonia. Ammonia N is 
converted to nitrate (NO3−) through the aerobic process of nitrification. Denitrification occurs under 
anoxic/anaerobic conditions, whereby aerobic or facultative organisms reduce oxidized forms of nitrogen (e.g., 
nitrite, nitrate) in the absence of free oxygen to produce nitrogen gas (N2). N2O is an intermediate product of 
both nitrification and denitrification processes. No matter where N2O is formed it is usually stripped to the air in 
aerated parts of the treatment process. 
A common example of a centralised treatment system configuration is an activated sludge wastewater treatment 
system. Following grit removal and primary treatment for solids removal, wastewater is sent to an activated 
sludge reactor for carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand removal, followed by secondary clarification where 
solids are allowed to settle from the wastewater. Clarified effluent may be disinfected prior to discharge. 
 
Chapter 6: Wastewater Treatment and Discharge  
 
 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
6.11 
Secondary clarifier sludge is pumped out from the bottom of the clarifier. Of this sludge, a portion is sent back to 
the activated sludge treatment process (return activated sludge) and the remainder (waste activated sludge) is 
combined with primary treatment sludge before being sent to sludge handling (such as gravity thickening). The 
thickened sludge may also be processed onsite in an anaerobic digester followed by further dewatering, such as 
by centrifuge. Recovered wastewater from thickening and dewatering operations, such as filtrate from the gravity 
thickener or centrate from the centrifuge) are returned to the influent stream at the headworks to the wastewater 
treatment system.  
CH4 generated in the sewer system enters the treatment plant as dissolved methane and is emitted during 
turbulent/aerated treatment steps (Daelman et al. 2012). Although the CH4 emissions from centralised aerobic 
plants may be small, they are not zero and may be substantial for some plants receiving sewage from expansive 
sewer networks (Willis 2017). In addition, anaerobic conditions can form within the treatment system increasing 
the potential for CH4 generation from an otherwise aerobic system. These refinements introduce a new MCF 
associated with these systems, as well as a revised N2O emission factor for centralised wastewater treatment 
systems. 
Occasionally wastewater treatment plants could be hydraulically or organically overloaded, resulting in degraded 
plant performance. In these cases, organic matter and nutrients that would normally be removed by the treatment 
system instead pass through untreated and are discharged to the aquatic environment. The 2006 IPCC Guidelines 
previously provided different emission factors for “well managed” centralised aerobic treatment systems versus 
“not well managed” centralised aerobic treatment systems. However, these refinements remove those factors and 
instead provide one factor for these types of systems. In the case of overloaded systems, the amount of organics 
removed by the system in sludge (S) should reflect the performance achieved by the system.  
6.1.2 
Decentralised treatment systems of domestic 
wastewater (onsite sanitation) 
Depending on national circumstances, domestic wastewater not connected to a centralised wastewater treatment 
plant may be directly discharged in natural aquatic environments (rivers, lakes, oceans, etc.) or treated using 
onsite sanitation. The most common onsite treatment systems are holding tanks, septic systems and latrines. 
A septic system is usually composed of a septic tank, generally buried in the ground, and a soil dispersal system. 
Solids and dense materials contained in the incoming wastewater (influent) settle in the septic tanks as sludge. 
Floatable material (scum) is also retained in the tank. The sludge settled on the bottom of the tank undergoes 
anaerobic digestion. Partially treated water is discharged in the dispersal system. The liquid fraction remains in 
the tank for only a short period, with the hydraulic retention time (HRT) varying from 24 to 72 hours depending 
on tank volume and hydraulic load. The solid fraction accumulates and remains in the tank for several years, 
during which time it degrades anaerobically. The solids retention time (SRT) depends on the sludge withdrawal 
frequency. The gas produced from anaerobic sludge digestion (mainly CH4 and largely biogenic CO2) rise to the 
liquid surface and are usually released through vents. Gases produced in the effluent dispersal system (mainly 
N2O and biogenic CO2) are released through the soil.  
A latrine usually consists of a slab over a pit which may be two metres or more in depth. A wide range of 
configuration options exists for latrines (simple pit latrines, ventilated latrines, composting latrines, etc.) having 
in common that little (e.g., pour flush latrines) or no water is used to flush excreta into the pit. Pit latrines are 
utilised by more than 1.5 billion people throughout the world, especially in low-income countries (see new 
Figure 6.1a and new Annex 6A.1). Pit latrine gaseous emissions depend in part on local groundwater level. 
Anaerobic conditions favourable to CH4 emissions occur when the water table is high and the organic waste in 
the pit is submerged. 
In the absence of latrines, people resort to open defecation. Open defecation is not considered as a source of CH4, 
as anaerobic conditions are considered unlikely. 
In some high-income countries, onsite aerated wastewater treatment systems are used and enable a more 
advanced level of treatment than septic tanks in reducing the load of organics and nutrients in domestic effluent. 
The process usually involves a first step of sedimentation and anaerobic digestion, a second step of aerobic 
treatment and last step of clarification and disinfection. The treated effluent is discharged into the environment 
via surface irrigation or infiltration through an absorption trench.

6.1.3 
Emissions from receiving waters 
Dissolved CH4 and N2O that is generated in sewers, or present in untreated or treated discharges, has the 
potential to be released (Short et al. 2014; Short et al. 2017). A strong correlation between the condition of the 
aquatic environment and the generation of CH4 and N2O has been observed (e.g., Smith et al. 2017). Therefore, 
where wastewater is then discharged to aquatic environments with nutrient-impacted/eutrophic conditions (i.e., 
water bodies which are rich in nutrients and very productive in terms of aquatic animal and plant life), the 
additional organic matter in the discharged wastewater is expected to increase emissions. Many waterways are 
naturally eutrophic, while others have been altered by human impacts and are subject to eutrophication as a result. 
Surface marine waters are typically supersaturated (Ward et al. 1987; Conrad & Seiler 1988) and freshwaters 
highly supersaturated (Stanley et al. 2016) with CH4 irrespective of their trophic state, so this refinement does 
not distinguish between eutrophic and oligotrophic receiving waters, but it does distinguish between default 
waters (rivers and streams) and lakes and reservoirs where CH4 emissions are higher.

No refinement. 
6.1.5 
Changes compared to 2006 IPCC Guidelines  
The 2006 IPCC Guidelines included combined equations to estimate CH4 emissions from wastewater and from 
sludge removed from the wastewater. However, in some cases, this combined equation caused confusion among 
inventory compilers when calculating CH4 emissions from aerobic systems with anaerobic sludge digestion. In 
these cases, some compilers estimated zero CH4 emissions from well operated wastewater treatment systems, 
and then subtracted emissions associated with sludge digestion operations without first estimating the CH4 
emissions from sludge treatment, resulting in negative emissions. In this refinement, we discuss the proper way 
to use the equation in such situations, and we present an update to provide guidance on the calculation of the 
organic component removed in sludge. Countries must estimate the amount (mass) of sludge they generate from 
wastewater treatment and default data are provided for a number of countries. With this additional guidance, the 
use of a default value of zero for sludge removal from aerobic treatment systems and septic systems is no longer 
applicable.  
In addition, certain emission factors for CH4 emissions from domestic and industrial wastewater treatment have 
been updated to reflect additional measurement data on emissions from septic systems and centralised WWTPs. 
Furthermore, the CH4 emission factors for wastewater discharged to aquatic environments have been updated 
and a new emission factor for discharge to reservoirs, lakes, and estuaries is introduced. The calculation of CH4 
emissions from effluent discharged to aquatic systems has been updated to include the discharge of treated 
effluent and to reflect the removal of organics that occurs during treatment.

The 2019 Refinement also includes new guidance on how to estimate N2O emissions from domestic and 
industrial wastewater and presents updated guidance to estimate N2O emissions from centralised WWTPs. 
Furthermore, the N2O emission factors for wastewater discharged to aquatic environments have been updated 
and the calculation of N2O emissions from effluent discharged to aquatic systems has been updated to reflect the 
removal of nitrogen that occurs during treatment. 
6.2 
METHANE EMISSIONS FROM WASTEWATER 
6.2.1 
Methodological issues 
Emissions are a function of the amount of organic waste generated and an emission factor that characterises the 
extent to which this waste generates CH4.  
Three tier methods for CH4 from this category are summarised below: 
The Tier 1 method applies default values for the emission factor and activity parameters. This method is 
considered good practice for countries with limited data. 
The Tier 2 method follows the same method as Tier 1 but allows for incorporation of a country specific emission 
factor and country specific activity data. For example, a specific emission factor for a prominent treatment 
system based on field measurements could be incorporated under this method. The amount of sludge removed 
for incineration, landfills, composting, and agricultural land should be taken into consideration. In addition, 
countries that are able to categorize wastewater discharge by the type of waterbody should use Tier 2 emission 
factors for estimating emissions from discharge. 
For a country with good data and advanced methodologies, a country specific method could be applied as a Tier 
3 method. For example, a more advanced country-specific method could be based on plant-specific data from 
large wastewater treatment facilities, using country-specific measurements of organics discharged to aquatic 
environments, or may draw on country-specific water quality data for aquatic environments receiving wastewater 
inputs.  
Wastewater treatment facilities that receive wastewater from collection systems, particularly pressurized sewers 
and gravity-fed sewers that are closed, can liberate CH4 in aerobic systems from dissolved CH4 that enters the 
treatment system (Daelman et al. 2012; Short et al. 2017). 
Wastewater treatment facilities can include anaerobic process steps. CH4 generated at such facilities can be 
recovered and combusted in a flare or energy device. The amount of CH4 that is flared or recovered for energy 
use should be subtracted from total emissions through the use of a separate CH4 recovery parameter. The amount 
of CH4 which is recovered or flared is expressed as R in updated Equation 6.1. R refers to CH4 recovered from 
wastewater treatment, such as methane captured on filters exhausted from covered (anaerobic) treatment ponds, 
as well as CH4 recovered from anaerobic sludge digestion. The approach to estimation of emissions from 
wastewater treatment in this chapter covers all emission sources and sinks (recovery) at a wastewater treatment 
plant. 
Note that only a few countries may have sludge removal data and CH4 recovery data. The information on sludge 
generation has improved and statistical data on sludge can be found in databases of Eurostat and Organization for 
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The lack of data for CH4 recovery was taken into account in 
this refinement by recommending the use of the methodology in Section 4.1, Chapter 4 of Volume 5, 2006 IPCC 
Guidelines which estimates emissions on the basis of total sludge anaerobically digested; thus, the information 
on R is not required in this calculation. Default sludge removal factors are provided in this refinement. The 
default for CH4 recovery is zero. If a country selects to report CH4 recovery, it is good practice to distinguish 
between flaring and CH4 recovery for energy generation, which should be reported in the Energy Sector taking 
into account the avoidance of double counting emissions from flaring and energy used.  
Emissions from flaring are not significant, as the majority of CO2 emissions are of biogenic origin, and the CH4 
and N2O emissions are very small so good practice in the Waste Sector does not require their estimation. 
However, if it is wished to do so these emissions should be reported under the Waste Sector. A discussion of 
emissions from flares and more detailed information are given in Volume 2, Energy, Chapter 4.2. Emission from 
flaring is not treated at Tier 1.

Step 1: 
Use updated Equation 6.3 to estimate organically degradable material TOW in wastewater prior to 
treatment. Use new Equation 6.3a to estimate total organics in domestic wastewater for each 
wastewater treatment/discharge pathway or system, j (TOWj). Use new Equation 6.3d to estimate 
total organics in treated wastewater effluent discharged (TOWEFFtreat). 
Step 2: 
Use new Equations 6.3b and 6.3c to estimate the amount of organic component removed in sludge, S, 
from aerobic treatment plants and septic systems. 
Step 3: 
Select the pathway and systems (see updated Figure 6.1) according to country activity data. Use 
Equation 6.2 or the updated Table 6.3 to obtain the emission factor for each domestic wastewater 
treatment/discharge pathway or system. 
Step 4: 
Use updated Equation 6.1 to estimate emissions and adjust for possible sludge removal and/or CH4 
recovery of treatment/discharge pathway or system, j, in inventory year. Use new Equation 6.1a to 
sum the emissions across all treatment/discharge pathways or systems.  
Step 5: 
Use Equation 4.1 and emission factors in Table 4.1 to estimate methane emissions from anaerobic 
digestion of sludge. 
To determine the use of each type of treatment or discharge system, it is good practice to refer to national 
statistics (e.g., from regulatory authorities). If these data are not available, wastewater associations or 
international organisations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) may have data on the system usage.  
Otherwise, consultation with sanitation experts can help, and expert judgment can also be applied (see Chapter 2, 
Approaches to Data Collection, in Volume 1). Urbanisation statistics may provide a useful tool, e.g., city sizes 
and income distribution. 
These updates are presented because, in some cases, the original Equation 6.1 caused confusion among inventory 
compilers when calculating CH4 emissions across multiple wastewater treatment/discharge pathways or systems 
across multiple income groups. These updates allow for a more stepwise process in estimating emissions 
throughout the country. 
It is good practice for countries to treat the wastewater treatment system and onsite sludge treatment system as 
separate pathways. As an example, for an activated sludge treatment process, calculate the emissions directly 
associated with the aerobic treatment system as one pathway, and calculate the emissions and report any CH4 
recovery directly associated with the anaerobic sludge digestion system as a separate pathway using the 
emissions methodology provided in Table 4.1, Chapter 4 of Volume 5. Net emissions from both systems should 
be summed together and reported under wastewater treatment and discharge. In no circumstances should a 
country report negative emissions. As discussed in Chapter 4, the reporting of anaerobic digestion of sludge is 
under biological treatment only if transferred from the wastewater treatment plant to anaerobic facilities co-
digesting sludge with MSW or other waste. 
It is important that CH4 emissions from sludge that is managed using landfills, incineration, composting, biogas 
production, or used in agriculture are not included in the wastewater treatment and discharge category. The data 
should be consistent across the sectors, and categories, amount disposed at SWDS, applied to agricultural land, 
incinerated or used elsewhere should be equal to the amount organic component removed as sludge in updated 
Equation 6.1. Wastewater and sludge that is applied on agricultural land should be considered in Volume 4 for 
AFOLU Sector, Section 11.2, N2O emissions from managed soils, in Chapter 11, N2O Emissions from Managed 
Soils, and CO2 Emissions from Lime and Urea Application. 
Wastewater treatment system/pathway usage often differs for rural and urban residents. Also, in developing 
countries, there are likely to be differences between urban high-income and urban low-income residents. Hence, 
emissions are calculated by each income group fraction. It is good practice to treat the three categories: rural 
population, urban high-income population, and urban low-income population separately. It is suggested to use a 
spreadsheet, as shown in Table 6.5. 
Equation 6.1 should be used to estimate CH4 emissions from every treatment system and discharge pathway j 
(hereafter referred to as treatment/discharge pathway or system), presented in Table 6.3 (Updated) that are 
appropriate for the country, including the discharge of treated or untreated wastewater. 
CH4 emissions from the following discharge pathways must be considered in the inventory for treated and 
untreated wastewaters (if occurring in the country): 
• 
Discharge to reservoirs, lakes, and estuaries; 
• 
Discharge to aquatic environments other than to reservoirs, lakes, and estuaries; 
• 
Discharge to sewers (with a distinction between stagnant and flowing (open or closed) sewers).  
 
Chapter 6: Wastewater Treatment and Discharge  
 
 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
6.17 
For the discharge of treated wastewater, the TOW should reflect the organics in the wastewater as discharged 
(see Equation 6.3d (New). As noted in the table, discharges to soil should be reported in Volume 4. 
CH4 emissions from the following wastewater treatment systems must be considered in the inventory (if 
occurring in the country): 
• 
Centralised, aerobic treatment plant; 
• 
Anaerobic reactor (e.g., upflow anaerobic sludge blanket digestion (UASB)); 
• 
Anaerobic lagoons (with a distinction between shallow and facultative lagoons and deep lagoons); 
• 
Constructed wetlands; 
• 
Septic systems (with a distinction between stand-alone septic tanks and septic tanks with land dispersal 
field); 
• 
Latrines (depending of the climate). 
Emissions from anaerobic digestion of wastewater treatment sludge should be estimated using Equation 4.1 and 
included in the sum of emissions using Equation 6.1A (New). The emission factor used in Equation 4.1 accounts 
for CH4 recovery, therefore the amount of methane recovered from anaerobic digestion should not be subtracted.

6.2.2.2 CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTORS 
This section represents an update to Section 6.2.2.2 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.  
The emission factor for a wastewater treatment and discharge pathway and system is a function of the maximum 
CH4 producing potential (Bo) and the methane correction factor (MCF) for the wastewater treatment and 
discharge system, as shown in Equation 6.2. The Bo is the maximum amount of CH4 that can be produced from a 
given quantity of organics (as expressed in Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) or Chemical Oxygen Demand 
(COD) in the wastewater and represents the complete conversion of organic C to biogas. The MCF indicates the 
extent to which the CH4 producing capacity (Bo) is realised in each type of treatment and discharge pathway and 
system. Thus, it is an indication of the degree to which the system is anaerobic.

Table 6.2 includes default maximum CH4 producing capacity (Bo) for domestic wastewater. It is good practice to 
use country-specific data if available for emission factors, which are made up of Bo and MCF values. If a country 
chooses to introduce country-specific data for Bo based on independent wastewater analyses, they must also 
update the MCF because the MCFs presented in Table 6.3 were developed using the default Bo values. For 
domestic wastewater, a COD-based value of Bo can be converted into a BOD-based value by multiplying with a 
factor of 2.4. New Annex 6A.2 provides further explanation of the basis for these default Bo values to allow 
countries to consider if these values are appropriate for the specific characteristics of their waste streams.

0.6 kg CH4/kg BOD 
0.25 kg CH4/kg COD 
Based on expert judgment by lead authors and on Doorn et al. (1997)  
 
Because the Bo and MCF values must be used together, updated Table 6.3 now also includes the resultant default 
CH4 emission factors for each wastewater treatment and discharge pathway. In addition, the MCFs in Table 6.3 
of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines have been updated to reflect revisions to the following specific wastewater 
treatment and discharge pathways and systems (see also new Annex 6A.3).  
DISCHARGE FROM TREATED OR UNTREATED SYSTEMS 
Updated Table 6.3 presents updated default MCFs associated with the discharge of wastewater to a water body 
and it is good practice to apply the Tier 1 MCF to discharges of both treated and untreated wastewater. The BOD 
of treated wastewater is typically 5–25 mg/L (Hammer & Hammer Jr. 2012; Tchobanoglous et al. 2014), which 
provides a substrate for the formation of CH4 in a receiving water body. Furthermore, much of the dissolved CH4 
that is generated in sewers is released either in the treatment plant headworks or to the receiving water body in 
the case of untreated or primary treated discharges (Short et al. 2014; Short et al. 2017). Recent evidence points 
to the operation of both microbial and non-microbial methanogenic pathways in nature (e.g., Jugold et al. 2012) 
and strong relationships between the nutrient status of a receiving water body and the rate of generation of CH4 
have been observed (e.g., Smith et al. 2017). Despite this relationship, most rivers, estuaries and coastal waters 
are considerably supersaturated with CH4, irrespective of their nutrient status (Patra et al. 1998; Grunwald et al. 
2009; Ward et al. 2017), while open oceans are slightly supersaturated (Tilbrook & Karl 1995; Oudot et al. 2002; 
Castro-Morales et al. 2014). Supersaturated conditions occur when the rate of methanogenesis exceeds the rate at 
which the CH4 is oxidised and/or transferred to the atmosphere and is important as it governs the driving force 
 
Chapter 6: Wastewater Treatment and Discharge  
 
 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
6.19 
(mass transfer coefficient) and likely water-to-air CH4 emission from a receiving environment. So, while the 
conditions of the receiving water body play a modulating role in relation to the rate of methanogenesis, the 
addition of organic matter from sewer discharges is generally expected to increase CH4 emissions in freshwater 
and coastal environments. Recent reviews of measurements of CH4 generation indicate that a significant 
proportion of the CH4 emitted from freshwater systems has its origins in carbon deposited on sediments (Deemer 
et al. 2016) which is one reason why methanogenesis is more intense in lakes and reservoirs than fast-flowing 
rivers. 
Using the same stoichiometric relationship as was used to calculate the default Bo value (see new Annex 6A.2), a 
ratio of 0.938 kg C per kg COD is obtained. Deemer et al. (2016) performed an extensive review of 
measurements of CH4 and CO2 originating in aquatic systems, and independent measurements of both CH4 and 
CO2 emission fluxes around the world. Using these data in combination with information on the partitioning of 
global carbon flows in freshwater systems Tranvik et al. (2009) and a default Bo of 0.25 kg CH4/kg COD, a Tier 
2 MCF of 0.035 is calculated for rivers. Where it is possible to separately identify discharges to slow-flowing 
systems such as lakes and reservoirs, a Tier 2 MCF of 0.19 is presented (see updated Table 6.3 and new Annex 
6A.4).  
If countries are not able to collect activity data regarding the distribution of discharge to reservoirs, lakes, and 
estuaries as compared to discharges to other aquatic environments, they should use the default Tier 1 factors. The 
default Tier 1 MCF for CH4 generation for discharges to all aquatic environments is presented as the mean of the 
two Tier 2 MCFs, or 0.11. 
Concerning decentralised treatment systems for domestic wastewater, CH4 and N2O emissions from effluent 
infiltration into soil must be considered.  
CENTRALISED, AEROBIC TREATMENT PLANTS 
The MCF for centralised aerobic treatment plants has been updated in Table 6.3 to reflect the potential for 
generation of CH4 from these systems. In addition, there are no longer separate MCFs for “well managed” and 
“not well managed” systems and it is good practice to estimate CH4 from all centralised, aerobic treatment plants. 
If country-specific data are available to differentiate whether systems are overloaded or not well managed, these 
situations should be reflected in the calculation of TOW (for inflow overload) or Smass (for systems that are not 
well managed and therefore not achieving the expected removal of sludge). 
IMPACT OF TEMPERATURE ON DECENTRALISED TREATMENT SYSTEMS 
OF DOMESTIC WASTEWATER 
Temperature affects wastewater treatment processes, in particular decentralised systems where no external 
supplemental heat is provided (uncontrolled temperature) and anaerobic digestion for which the optimal 
temperature is 30–38°C. At lower temperatures, the rate of anaerobic digestion decreases and CH4 production 
becomes unlikely below 12°C. Inside septic tanks, the temperature is uncontrolled and is related to atmospheric 
temperature as well as volumes of household hot and cold water used and discharged. There may also be a 
gradient of temperature inside the septic tank, with warmer conditions at the bottom (sludge layer) and colder at 
the top (Leverenz et al. 2010). Therefore, in countries having seasonal temperature variability, when the 
temperature in septic tanks cools, the rate of digestion slows, the SRT increases, sludge accumulates, and CH4 
emissions decrease. When the liquid temperature warms, the rate of digestion increases, sludge accumulated 
during the cold season decomposes, gas solubility in the liquid decreases and CH4 emissions increase. This 
situation can produce a ‘spring boil’ phenomenon, wherein warmer weather conditions give rise to increased 
anaerobic microbial activity, increased gas production, and decreased solids removal efficiency due to the 
resuspension of settled and incoming solids. Accordingly, there is a seasonal variability of CH4 emissions 
(Leverenz et al. 2010); however, at this time, insufficient data exist to establish a temperature-dependent 
emission factor associated with these systems. Countries that experience significant seasonal temperature 
variations may wish to consider the development of a country-specific emission factor.

6.2.2.3 CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
The activity data for this source category is the total amount of organically degradable material in the wastewater 
(TOW). This parameter is a function of human population and BOD generation per person. It is expressed in 
terms of biochemical oxygen demand (kg BOD/year). The equation for TOW is:

Where: 
TOW 
= total organics in wastewater in inventory year, kg BOD/yr

= country population in inventory year, (person) 
BOD 
= country-specific per capita BOD5 in inventory year, g/person/day. See Table 6.4. 
0.001 
= conversion from grams BOD to kg BOD 
Total population statistics should be readily available from national statistics agencies or international agencies 
(e.g., United Nations Statistics, see https://population.un.org/wpp/). Table 6.4 includes BOD default values for 
selected countries. It is good practice to select a BOD default value from a nearby comparable country when 
country-specific data are not available. The degree of urbanisation for a country can be retrieved from various 
sources, (e.g., Global Environment Outlook, United Nations Environment Programme and World Development 
Indicators, World Health Organization). The urban high-income and urban-low income fractions can be 
determined by expert judgment when statistical or other comparable information is not available.

This section is updated to also include new equations for the calculation of organic components removed as 
sludge from aerobic treatment plants and from septic systems (see Equations 6.3b and 6.3c, respectively). Note 
that the estimate of TOWij in Equation 6.3a is specific to the wastewater treatment system or pathway. Inventory 
compilers should consider that sludge recovered from septic tanks may be transferred to centralised WWTPs. In 
these cases, it is good practice to include this additional organic load when estimating TOW in influent to the 
centralised WWTP.  
The organic component removed from wastewater as sludge, S, in Equations 6.1 and 6.4, is not explained in 
detail in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. This section provides an update through the introduction of new Equations 
6.3b and 6.3c, which provide default calculations of S for aerobic treatment plants and septic systems, 
respectively. The default value of S for all other systems is zero. For aerobic treatment systems, some inventory 
compilers incorrectly defined the variable “S” in Equation 6.1 as the mass of sludge removed rather than the 
organic component removed from wastewater as sludge. It is important to note that the organic component 
removed from wastewater as sludge is not equivalent to the mass (tonnes) of sludge produced from wastewater 
treatment. Instead, the organic component removed as sludge is a function of sludge produced from wastewater 
treatment (Smass) and a sludge factor (Krem) which indicates how much organic matter is removed from the 
treatment process in sludge per kilogram of sludge produced.

New Table 6.6a provides factors associated with the amount of organics in wastewater removed in sludge. 
Aerobic WWTPs with primary treatment only remove about 0.5 kg of influent BOD per kg of primary sludge by 
sedimentation. The aerobic stage of treatment removes 1.5 kg BOD per kg of secondary sludge.  The sludge 
produced in aerobic WWTPs with primary sedimentation contains approximately 70 percent of primary sludge 
and 30percent of secondary sludge by weight. Aerobic WWTPs without primary treatment remove about 1.16 kg 
BOD per kg of sludge, depending on process type. Countries where data are available should estimate a country-
specific Krem as a ratio between BOD removed and sludge generated for each process listed in Table 6.6a. 
Country-specific Krem should be estimated as a weighted average by individual processes.

1 BOD, or biochemical oxygen demand, is a proxy indicator of the quality (or organic content) of the waste, but it is not a 
direct mass measurement of the organic content. Just as the mass of oxygen in carbon dioxide is greater than the mass of 
carbon, it is feasible for the BOD of a carbon-containing molecule to exceed 1 when the molecule is metabolised to carbon 
dioxide.

Concerning septic systems, emissions depend on the fraction of the population managing their septic tank in 
accordance with the sludge removal instructions of their septic tank/system (F in new Equation 6.3c). The default 
value for F is 0.5 and corresponds to the situation where 50percent of the population managing their septic 
system are complying with the sludge removal instructions. This default value is for countries where there is no 
effective regulation or administrative requirements for sludge removal in septic systems. In countries with such 
regulations or requirements, some evidence of maintenance controls should be provided (for instance the 
existence of a local public service responsible for onsite sanitation). It is good practice to assess the F value 
using available data on sludge removal practices among the population using septic systems.

6.2.2.5 UNCERTAINTIES 
Chapter 3, Uncertainties, in Volume 1 provides advice on quantifying uncertainties in practice. It includes 
guidance on eliciting and using expert judgments which in combination with empirical data can provide overall 
uncertainty estimates. This section provides an update to Table 6.7 to provide default uncertainty ranges for new 
or updated emission factor and activity data of domestic wastewater. The following parameters are believed to be 
very uncertain: 
• 
The degrees to which wastewater in developing countries is treated in latrines, septic tanks, or removed by 
sewer, for urban high, urban low income groups and rural population (Ti,j).  
• 
The fraction of sewers that are ‘open’, as well as the degree to which open sewers in developing countries 
are anaerobic and will emit CH4. This will depend on retention time and temperature, and on other factors 
including the presence of a facultative layer and possibly components that are toxic to anaerobic bacteria 
(e.g., certain industrial wastewater discharges).  
• 
The amount of industrial TOW that is discharged into open or closed domestic sewers for each country is 
very difficult to quantify.

6.2.3 
Industrial wastewater 
Industrial wastewater may be treated on site or released into domestic sewer systems. If it is released into the 
domestic sewer system, the emissions are to be included with the domestic wastewater emissions. This section 
deals with estimating CH4 emissions from on-site industrial wastewater treatment. Only industrial wastewater 
with significant carbon loading that is treated under intended or unintended anaerobic conditions will produce 
CH4. Organics in industrial wastewater are often expressed in terms of COD, which is used here. 
6.2.3.1 CHOICE OF METHOD 
Assessment of CH4 production potential from industrial wastewater streams is based on the concentration of 
degradable organic matter in the wastewater, the volume of wastewater, and the propensity of the industrial 
sector to treat their wastewater in anaerobic systems. Using these criteria, major industrial wastewater sources 
with high CH4 gas production potential can be identified as follows:  
• 
pulp and paper manufacture; 
• 
meat and poultry processing (slaughterhouses); 
• 
alcohol, beer, starch production; 
• 
organic chemicals production; 
• 
other food and drink processing (dairy products, vegetable oil, fruits and vegetables, canneries, juice making, 
etc.). 
Both the pulp and paper industry and the meat and poultry processing industries produce large volumes of 
wastewater that contain high levels of degradable organics. The meat and poultry processing facilities typically 
employ anaerobic lagoons to treat their wastewater, while the paper and pulp industry also use lagoons and 
anaerobic reactors. The non-animal food and beverage industries produce considerable amounts of wastewater 
with significant organic carbon levels and are also known to use anaerobic processes such as lagoons and 
anaerobic reactors. Anaerobic reactors treating industrial effluents with biogas facilities are usually linked with 
recovery of the generated CH4 for energy. Emissions from the combustion process for energy should be reported 
in the Energy Sector. 
The method for estimating emissions from industrial wastewater is similar to the one used for domestic 
wastewater. An updated decision tree for industrial wastewater is included as updated Figure 6.3 and should be 
used to determine the tier approach that is applicable to the country.  
The development of emission factors and activity data is more complex because there are many types of 
wastewater, and many different industries to track. The most accurate estimates of emissions for this source 
category would be based on measured data from point sources. Due to the high costs of measurements and the

potentially large number of point sources, collecting comprehensive measurement data is very difficult. It is 
suggested that inventory compilers use a top-down approach that includes the following general steps:  
Step 1: 
Use Equation 6.6 to estimate total organically degradable carbon in wastewater (TOW) for industrial 
sector i 
Step 2: 
Select the pathway and systems (updated Figure 6.1) according to country activity data. Use Equation 
6.5 to obtain emission factor. For each industrial sector estimate the emission factor using maximum 
methane producing capacity and the average industry-specific MCF. 
Step 3: 
Use Equation 6.4 to estimate emissions, adjust for possible sludge removal and or CH4 recovery and 
sum the results.

6.2.3.2 CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTORS 
This section represents an update to Section 6.2.3.2 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.  
As stated in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, there are significant differences in the CH4 emitting potential of different 
types of industrial wastewater dependent on the type and form of constituents present in the wastewater. To the 
extent possible, data should be collected to determine the maximum CH4 producing capacity (Bo) in each 
industry.  
As mentioned before, the MCF indicates the extent to which the CH4 producing potential (Bo) is realised in each 
type of treatment method. Thus, it is an indication of the degree to which the system is anaerobic. See Equation 
6.5.

MCFj  
= methane correction factor (fraction). See Table 6.8. 
Good practice is to use country- and industry-sector specific data that may be available from government 
authorities, industrial organisations, or industrial experts. If country-specific data are available to determine the 
Bo for a particular industry, industry-specific MCFs must be developed for the calculation of CH4 emissions. 
However, if country-specific data are not available, it is good practice to use the IPCC default factors listed in 
Table 6.2.  
In determining the MCF, which is the fraction of waste treated anaerobically, expert judgment is recommended. 
A peer-reviewed survey of industry wastewater treatment practices is one useful technique for estimating these 
data. Surveys should be conducted frequently enough to account for major trends in industry practices (i.e., every 
3-5 years). Chapter 2, Approaches to Data Collection, in Volume 1, describes how to elicit expert judgment for

types of data if published data and statistics are not available. Table 6.8 includes default MCF values, which are 
based on expert judgment.   
In addition, the MCFs in Table 6.8 have been updated to reflect revisions to certain wastewater treatment and 
discharge pathways and systems, as described in Section 6.2.2.2.

NITROUS OXIDE EMISSIONS FROM 
DOMESTIC WASTEWATER 
This section refines Section 6.3 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines by providing update and new guidance for 
estimating domestic N2O emissions from WWTPs and provides new guidance on the estimation of N2O 
emissions from wastewater after disposal of untreated wastewater or treated wastewater effluent into aquatic 
environments by accounting for losses of nitrogen prior to disposal. 
6.3.1 
Methodological issues 
Nitrous oxide emissions can occur as emissions from WWTPs or as emissions from receiving aquatic 
environments following the disposal of untreated or treated wastewater effluent. This section describes how to 
estimate the N2O produced during wastewater treatment, sludge treatment that occurs within the wastewater 
treatment system, and disposal of the wastewater. More recent research and field surveys have revealed that 
emissions in sewer networks and from nitrification or nitrification-denitrification processes at WWTPs, 
previously judged to be a minor source, may in fact result in more substantial emissions. N2O is generated as a 
by-product of nitrification, or as an intermediate product of denitrification. There are many factors affecting N2O 
Volume 5: Waste 
 
 
 
6.36 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
emissions from wastewater treatment systems such as the temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration of the 
wastewater, and the specific operational conditions.  
Emissions also result from untreated wastewater or wastewater treatment effluent that is discharged into aquatic 
environments. It is important to note that emissions are dependent on the nutrient-impacted status and 
oxygenation level of the aquatic environment receiving the wastewater discharge. The current methodology in 
the 2006 IPCC Guidelines appropriately captures discharge to relatively clean and/or well-oxygenated 
environments. However, in the case of discharge to nutrient-impacted waters such as eutrophic lakes, estuaries 
and rivers, or locations where stagnant conditions occur, emissions can be significantly higher. 
Three tiers of methods for estimating N2O emissions from this category are summarised below: 
The Tier 1 method applies default values for the emission factor and activity parameters. This method is 
considered good practice for countries with limited data. 
The Tier 2 method follows the same method as Tier 1 but allows for incorporation of a country-specific emission 
factor and country-specific activity data. For example, a specific emission factor for a prominent treatment 
system based on field measurements could be incorporated under this method. Use of country-specific emission 
factor in the same region or climate area is also good practice. The amount of sludge removed for incineration, 
landfills, and agricultural land should be taken into consideration.  
For a country with good data and advanced methodologies, a country-specific method could be applied as a Tier 
3 method. For example, a more advanced country-specific method could be based on plant-specific emissions 
data from large wastewater treatment facilities or using country-specific measurements of nitrogen discharged to 
aquatic environments of varying nutrient-impacted status. Direct measurement methods would provide a more 
accurate measurement of N2O production from each treatment plant. 
6.3.1.1 CHOICE OF METHOD 
A decision tree for domestic wastewater is included in new Figure 6.4. 
The steps for good practice in inventory preparation for N2O from domestic wastewater are as follows:  
Step 1: 
Use new Equation 6.10 to estimate total nitrogen in wastewater and updated Equation 6.8 to estimate 
total nitrogen in wastewater effluent.  
Step 2: 
Select the pathway and systems (see updated Figure 6.1) according to country activity data. Select the 
emission factor for each domestic wastewater treatment/discharge pathway or system. 
Step 3: 
Use updated Equation 6.9 to estimate emissions from wastewater treatment and sum the results for 
each treatment pathway/system.  
Step 4: 
Use updated Equation 6.7 to estimate emissions from effluent, accounting for losses of nitrogen that 
occur within the wastewater treatment process including sludge removal and sum the results for each 
pathway/system. Emissions should also be calculated for nitrogen discharged as untreated wastewater. 
As described earlier, the wastewater characterisation will determine the fraction of wastewater treated or 
disposed of by a particular system. To determine the use of each type of treatment or discharge system, it is good 
practice to refer to national statistics (e.g., from regulatory authorities). If these data are not available, 
wastewater associations or international organisations such as the WHO may have data on the system usage.  
Otherwise, consultation with sanitation experts can help, and expert judgment can also be applied (see Chapter 2, 
Approaches to Data Collection, in Volume 1). Urbanisation statistics may provide a useful tool, e.g., city sizes 
and income distribution. 
If activity data are available to categorize discharges to nutrient-impacted environments, these refinements 
introduce a new Tier 3 emission factor for those discharges.

Emissions from Lime and Urea Application. The simplified general equation is as follows:

Equation 6.8.  
EFEFFLUENT  
 = emission factor for N2O emissions from wastewater discharged to aquatic systems, 
kg N2O-N/kg N    
The factor 44/28 is the conversion of kg N2O-N into kg N2O. 
6.3.1.2 CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTORS 
New Table 6.8a includes default Tier 1 EF values for use in estimation of N2O emissions from waters receiving 
treated or untreated effluent (see Annex 6A.5). These refinements to the emission factors build on the current 
default value for EFEFFLUENT provided in Table 6.11 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. This existing emission factor 
is adequate for all discharges when using the Tier 1 methodology. However, it is expected to generate an 
underestimate of N2O emissions in the case of discharge to nutrient-impacted waters such as eutrophic lakes, 
estuaries and rivers, or locations where stagnant conditions occur. Research published between 1978 and 2017 
provide data indicating that higher N2O emissions occur when wastewater is discharged to nutrient-impacted 
(eutrophic) or hypoxic aquatic receiving environments. Accordingly, Table 6.8a provides a new EFEFFLUENT of 
0.019 g N2O-N/g N (95percent confidence limits 0.0041–0.091) for use with a Tier 3 method (see Annex 6A.6 
for a discussion of information used to develop this new emission factor). The compiler can make use of many 
different indications of whether this higher EF value should be employed. Harmful algal blooms and hypoxia are 
the two most common symptoms of waterway nutrient over-enrichment (eutrophication). One possibility is to 
consider the dissolved oxygen status of the receiving waters. Waterway hypoxia is becoming increasingly 
common globally and definitions of hypoxia can vary depending on temperature, salinity, and the particular biota 
of interest. Dissolved oxygen concentrations of between 0.1–3.0 mg/L (or <30percent of the oxygen saturation 
concentration) are typically classified as hypoxic (Vaquer-Sunyer & Duarte 2008; Naqvi et al. 2010; Rabalais et 
al. 2010) and are likely to result in increased N2O yields from microbial metabolism of discharged wastewater 
nitrogen.  
Oxygen status can be a highly dynamic indicator in practice, and compilers may have better access to 
information regarding the nutrient (trophic) status of receiving waters. Various thresholds for the boundary 
between mesotrophic and eutrophic conditions have been proposed, such as Secchi depth (suggestions range 
from 2 to 3.6 m), total phosphorus (20–75 μg/L), total nitrogen (0.3–5 mg/L), benthic chlorophyll (70 mg/m2) 
and suspended chlorophyll concentration (5–30 μg/L) (Dodds et al. 1998; Burns et al. 2009; Mateo-Sagasta & 
Burke 2010). Compilers may also consider whether there have been reports of algal blooms, sulphurous odours,

fish kills or other indications of eutrophic and/or hypoxic conditions in the discharge environment. Global 
datasets exist which may assist compilers in assessing the risk of nutrient impacts in different regions (Diaz et al. 
2011; Xie & Ringler 2017). It is important to note that the context for application of this new Tier 3 EFEFFLUENT 
factor is not necessarily the same as for nitrogen runoff from agriculture, due to the combination of reducing 
conditions and high organic loading in many wastewaters which are unlikely to exist in agricultural runoff 
systems.

6.3.1.3 CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
The methodology to calculate the amount of N content in wastewater effluent (NEFFLUENT,DOM) presented in 
Equation 6.8 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines currently does not account for the removal of ammonia-N via 
nitrification-denitrification processes in the sewer and the WWTP, or the removal of N in sludge, which can 
result in a significant overestimate of N discharged to aquatic receiving environments. Typical total N 
concentration in raw urban sewage is about 40 mg/L (range 20–70 mg/L) (Tchobanoglous et al. 2014), whereas 
effluent treated in conventional activated sludge facilities (with nitrification) has a total of about 25 mg/L. Plants 
with biological nutrient removal (with denitrification) regularly achieve an effluent total N of 5 mg/L or less. The 
difference is due both to N removed in sludge (see Table 2.4A (New), Chapter 2 of Volume 5 regarding the N 
content of sewage sludge) versus N loss to the atmosphere (see new Figure 6.5). 
Volume 5: Waste

2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
This section updates the methodology presented in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines to estimate the amount of N 
content in wastewater entering treatment (TNDOM), the loss or removal of N through the treatment process (either 
through biological conversion or removal with sludge) (NREM), and the N content in wastewater discharged to 
aquatic systems (NEFFLUENT,DOM).

NITROGEN IN DOMESTIC WASTEWATER (TNDOM) 
The activity data that are needed for estimating TNDOM in domestic wastewater include the population associated 
with the wastewater, the average annual per capita protein consumed (kg/person/yr), and factors to account for N 
in non-consumed protein entering the wastewater and other N from household, industrial, and commercial 
sources co-discharged into the sewer system. The total N in wastewater for each treatment pathway is estimated 
as follows:

Methodological issues 
This section refines the 2006 IPCC Guidelines by adding new guidance for estimating N2O emissions from 
industrial WWTPs and refines the estimation of N2O emissions from wastewater after disposal of untreated 
wastewater or wastewater treatment effluent into aquatic environments by accounting for losses of nitrogen prior 
to disposal. 
6.4.1.1 CHOICE OF METHOD 
A decision tree for industrial wastewater is included in new Figure 6.6. 
The steps for good practice in inventory preparation for N2O from industrial wastewater are as follows:  
Step 1: 
Use new Equation 6.13 to estimate total nitrogen in wastewater.  
Step 2: 
Select the pathway and systems (see updated Figure 6.1) according to country activity data. Select the 
emission factor for each industrial wastewater treatment/discharge pathway or system. 
Step 3: 
Use new Equation 6.11 to estimate emissions from wastewater treatment and sum the results for each 
pathway/system.  
Step 4: 
Use new Equation 6.12 to estimate emissions from effluent, accounting for losses of nitrogen that 
occur within the wastewater treatment process, including sludge removal, and sum the results for each 
pathway/system.  
As described earlier, the wastewater characterisation will determine the fraction of wastewater treated or 
disposed of by a particular system. To determine the use of each type of treatment or discharge system, it is good 
practice to refer to national statistics (e.g., from regulatory authorities). If these data are not available, industry 
associations may have data on the system usage. Otherwise, consultation with industry experts can help, and 
expert judgment can also be applied (see Chapter 2 Approaches to Data Collection, Volume 1).

environments. The methodology for emissions from effluent is like that of N2O emissions explained in Volume 4,

TOTAL NITROGEN IN INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER (TNIND) 
The activity data for this source category is the amount of total nitrogen (TN) in the industrial wastewater 
entering treatment (TNIND). This parameter is a function of industrial output (product) P (tonnes/yr), wastewater 
generation W (m3/ton of product), and total N concentration in the untreated wastewater (kg TN/m3). See new 
Equation 6.13. The following steps are required for determination of TNIND: 
(i) 
Identify the industrial sectors that generate wastewater with large quantities of N, by evaluating 
total industrial product, N in the wastewater, and wastewater produced. 
(ii) 
Identify industrial sectors that use treatment systems with N2O emissions factors (see new Table 
6.8a). Experience has shown that usually three or four industrial sectors are key.  
For each selected sector estimate total N in the industrial wastewater (TNIND).

Industrial production data and wastewater generation rates may be obtained from national statistics, regulatory

loading in the wastewater may require expert judgment. In some countries, N content and total water usage per 
sector data may be available directly from a regulatory agency. New Table 6.12 provides examples that could be 
used as default values for industries that may be considered key sources of N2O. These values should be used 
with caution, because they are industry-, process-, and country-specific.

NITROGEN REMOVED FROM WASTEWATER (NREM) 
Nitrogen removal by different treatment facilities can range from 10–85 percent. Default values for the fraction 
of nitrogen removed by type of wastewater treatment system are presented in Table 6.10c. 
NITROGEN IN WASTEWATER EFFLUENT (NEFFLUENT,IND) 
The total nitrogen in the industrial wastewater effluent is estimated as follows:

6.4.2 
Time series consistency 
Once an industrial sector is included in the inventory calculation, it should be included for each subsequent year. 
If the inventory compiler adds a new industrial sector to the calculation, then he or she should re-calculate the 
entire time series so that the method is consistent from year to year. General guidance on recalculation of 
estimates through time series is provided in Volume 1, Chapter 5, Time Series Consistency.  
If a country decides to incorporate plant emissions into the estimate, this change must be made for the entire time 
series. Potential sludge removal should be treated consistently across years in the time series.

These data can be very uncertain as the same sector might use different

The product of the parameters (W•TN) is expected to have less

concentration. –50 %, +100% is suggested (i.e., a factor of 2).

QA/QC, Completeness, Reporting and 
Documentation 
QUALITY ASSURANCE / QUALITY CONTROL (QA/QC) 
It is good practice to conduct quality control checks and quality assurance procedures as outlined in Chapter 6, 
QA/QC and Verification, of Volume 1. Below, some fundamental QA/QC procedures include: 
• 
For industrial wastewater, inventory compilers may review the secondary data sets (e.g., from national 
statistics, regulatory agencies, wastewater treatment associations or industry associations) that are used to 
estimate and rank industrial TN waste output. Some countries may have regulatory control over industrial 
discharges, in which cases significant QA/QC protocols may already be in place for the development of the 
wastewater characteristics on an industry basis. 
• 
For industrial wastewater, inventory compilers should cross-check values for EFs against those from other 
national inventories with similar wastewater characteristics. 
• 
If sludge removal is reported in the wastewater inventory, check for consistency with the estimates for 
sludge applied to agriculture soils, sludge incinerated, and sludge deposited in solid waste disposal. 
• 
For countries that use country-specific parameters or higher tier methods, inventory compilers should cross-
check the national estimates with emissions using the IPCC default method and parameters.  
COMPLETENESS 
Completeness for estimating emissions from industrial wastewater depends on an accurate characterisation of 
industrial sectors that produce nitrogen-laden wastewater. In most countries, approximately 3–4 industrial sectors 
will account for the majority of the nitrogenous wastewater volume, so the inventory compilers should ensure 
that these sectors are covered. Periodically, the inventory compilers should re-survey industrial sources, 
particularly if some industries are growing rapidly. 
This category should only cover industrial wastewater treated onsite. Emissions from industrial wastewater 
released into domestic sewer systems should be addressed and included with domestic wastewater. 
Some sludge from industrial wastewater treatment may be incinerated or deposited in landfills or on agricultural 
lands. This constitutes an amount of N that should be subtracted from effluent N. It is good practice to be 
consistent across sectors: the amount of N that is removed as sludge should be equal to the amount of sludge 
disposed at landfills, applied to agricultural soils, incinerated, or treated elsewhere.

REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION 
It is good practice to document and report a summary of the methods used, activity data and emission factors. 
When country-specific methods and/or emission factors are used, the reasoning for the choices as well as 
references to how the country-specific data (measurements, literature, expert judgment, etc.) have been derived 
(measurements, literature, expert judgment, etc.) should be documented and included in the reporting. 
If sludge is incinerated, landfilled, or spread on agricultural lands, the quantities of sludge and associated emissions 
should be reported in the waste incineration, solid waste disposal systems, or agricultural categories, respectively.  
More information on reporting and documentation can be found in Volume 1, Chapter 6, Section 6.11

Appendix 6A.1 Non-biogenic (fossil) CO2 emissions from 
wastewater treatment and discharge: Basis for Future 
Methodological Development 
The 2006 IPCC Guidelines assume that organic carbon present in wastewater derives from modern (biogenic) 
organic matter in human excreta or food waste (Doorn et al. 2006). Consequently, CO2 emissions from 
wastewater treatment according to those Guidelines are also considered wholly biogenic and are discounted from 
international greenhouse gas accounting inventories, since they do not represent a transfer of carbon from the 
lithosphere to the atmosphere. In comparison, fossil organic carbon (that with turnover timescales exceeding 106 
years) is considered to have a role in climate change and is accounted for in international greenhouse gas 
emissions inventories. In the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, it is assumed that emissions from biogas flaring are not 
significant because the CO2 emissions are of biogenic origin and the CH4 and N2O emissions are very small so 
good practice in the Waste Sector does not require their estimation. If countries wish to report such emissions, 
they should be reported under the Waste Sector. A discussion of emissions from flares and more detailed 
information are given in Volume 2, Energy, Chapter 4.2. However, the presence of fossil organic carbon in 
sewage also implies the emission of additional fossil CO2 from wastewater treatment facilities, sludge 
management, and environmental recipients of treated or untreated wastewater. 
Data emerging since the 2006 IPCC Guidelines indicate that wastewater contains an appreciable amount of non-
biogenic (fossil) organic carbon, with this fossil carbon thought to be derived from the use of petroleum-based 
products (domestically and commercially). These products include: cosmetics; pharmaceuticals; surfactants; 
detergents and food additives (Law et al. 2013). Additionally, direct dosing of synthetic, fossil-derived organic 
substrates (e.g., methanol) can occur at wastewater treatment plants to enhance denitrification performance 
(Schneider et al. 2015). Despite early indications of the potential for significant fossil organic carbon fractions in 
sewage sludge (Turekian & Benoit 1981), fossil carbon in wastewater was first detailed by Griffith et al. (2009) 
following the sampling of treated effluent from 12 predominantly domestic wastewater treatment plants within 
the Hudson and Connecticut River watersheds, USA. Since then, several studies have surveyed fossil organic 
carbon in wastewater from Japan (Nara et al. 2010; Toyoda et al. 2011), Australia (Law et al. 2013), Denmark 
(Yoshida et al. 2014) and North America (Schneider et al. 2015). 
Research published since the 2006 IPCC Guidelines (Griffith et al. 2009; Law et al. 2013; Yoshida et al. 2014; 
Schneider et al. 2015; Tseng et al. 2016) gives an emerging consensus figure for the fossil wastewater organic 
carbon fraction at some 4–14percent; although more recent work suggests this can be as high as 28percent 
(Tseng et al., 2016) or 51percent (Nara et al. 2010; recalculated by Tseng et al. 2016) in some influents. 
Schneider et al. (2015) put the fossil content of activated sludge process off-gases at 10–15percent. Law et al. 
(2013) put the subsequent fossil carbon fraction in anaerobic digester biogas CO2 at 2.1±0.2percent due to 
greater recalcitrance of fossil carbon during anaerobic digestion, and total additional scope 1 wastewater 
treatment plant emission load from previously unaccounted fossil carbon somewhere between 2–12percent. 
Tseng et al. (2016) put this figure at some 13 to 24percent higher without and with energy recovery respectively. 
Based on the above data, countries are encouraged to evaluate if such emissions should be reported, particularly 
those countries that have higher levels of fossil carbon in wastewater. In addition, future improvements to the 
IPCC Guidelines should include a method for estimating these non-biogenic emissions associated with 
wastewater treatment operations and wastewater discharges.

Annex 6A.2 Derivation of the maximum CH4 producing potential 
(Bo) for domestic wastewater 
The maximum CH4 producing potential (Bo) for domestic wastewater is calculated theoretically by the anaerobic 
decomposition of glucose considering the total degradation of organic matter:

One mole of glucose weighs 180 g and produces 3 moles of methane which weighs 3 × 16 = 48 g. Therefore, the 
methane production rate per gram of glucose is 48 g /180 g = 0.27 g methane / g glucose. 
The complete oxidation of one mole of glucose (180 g) requires six moles of oxygen (6 × 32 g = 192 g)

Then, the oxygen demand rate per gram of glucose is 192 g / 180 g = 1.067 g oxygen / g glucose 
Finally, the maximum CH4 producing potential (Bo) for domestic wastewater based of COD content is 48 g CH4 
/ 192 g oxygen = 0.25 kg CH4 / kg COD. 
The COD/BOD ratio of a specific wastewater indicates the amount of organic matter difficult to degrade. For 
domestic wastewater, a typical COD/BOD ratio is 2.4 based on empirical tests. However, the ratio between the 
components in any given domestic wastewater stream may vary due to contributions from other sources, 
particularly wastewater contributions from commercial or industrial sources. The expected range of COD/BOD 
ratios is between 1.5 and 3.5 (Henze et al. 2008). 
Inventory compilers should compare country-specific data on COD/BOD ratio in domestic wastewater to IPCC 
default values of 2.4. If inventory compilers use country-specific COD/BOD ratio, they should provide 
documented justification why their country-specific values are more appropriate for their national circumstances. 
It should be noted that the emission factors are made up of a) the maximum CH4 producing capacity (Bo) and b) 
MCF which indicates the extent to which the Bo is released in each wastewater treatment/discharge pathways or 
systems. If a country chooses to introduce country-specific data for Bo based on measured composition of 
wastewater, they must also update the MCF because the MCFs were developed using the default Bo values.

Annex 6A.3 Estimation of default methane conversion factors for 
CH4 in centralised wastewater treatment plants treating domestic 
wastewater 
We reviewed scientific literature to find measured CH4 emissions from full-scale domestic wastewater treatment 
plants (excluding anaerobic sludge digestion). Although much literature exists, relatively few studies relate to 
full-scale treatment plants and provide key information such as influent organics in wastewater or organics 
removed in sludge. We reviewed and accepted data from 14 wastewater treatment plants. MCFs were calculated 
from data presented in studies, including measured CH4 emissions from wastewater treatment plant (not 
including sludge digesters), influent organics in wastewater, estimates of organics removed in sludge, and the 
IPCC default Bo value. Some data were not accepted for use because the treatment system co-treated a 
significant percentage of non-domestic wastewater, such as food waste. The references used, along with the type 
of treatment system studied and the resulting MCF, are listed in Table 6A.2. Although CH4 emissions vary by 
the type of wastewater treatment system used, more on-site exhaustive monitoring data are required to develop 
different MCFs for different treatment processes. Overall, an MCF of 0.03 was calculated for aerobic wastewater 
treatment systems with a standard deviation of 0.024 and a range of 0.003–0.09.

Annex 6A.4 Calculation of MCF for methane emissions from 
sewage discharges 
Data were obtained from a recent global review article by Deemer et al. (2016) for CO2 and CH4 emissions from 
different environments. At equilibrium with current atmospheric conditions, CO2 is relatively soluble (over 500 
μg/L) compared with CH4 (about 40 ng/L) at 25 degrees Celsius. Therefore, a reliance on studies that only 
measure diffusive flux will underestimate the relative emission of CH4. Deemer et al. (2016) raised previous 
estimates of CH4 emissions by excluding data from sources that did not include assessment of ebullition. 
Regarding emissions from all kinds of reservoirs, this exclusion had the effect of increasing the relative CH4 flux 
(CH4-C/(CH4-C + CO2-C)) to 27 percent (first data row in Table 6A.3) which is higher than previously thought. 
For an estimate of this effect on the other data, it is noted that about 52 percent of the data listed by Deemer and 
colleagues included ebullition, and for this about 40–60 percent of the total ebullitive and diffusive flux was due 
to ebullition. To illustrate the potential effect of adding ebullition to the reservoir studies a scaling factor of 1.48 
= 0.52/1 + 0.48/0.5 is applied for reservoirs and hydroelectric reservoirs in the table. Deemer et al. (2016) used 
(Bastviken et al. 2011) for an estimate of methane emissions from lakes and the original data (Table 1 in 
Bastviken and colleauges) suggests a smaller correction factor for that lake data of 1.23. For rivers, Stanley et al. 
(2016) reports a relationship similar to Deemer et al’s observation – that of total flux, 46 percent is ebullitive 
among those studies reporting both kinds of fluxes (see Table 1 in Stanley et al. 2016). Correcting the average of 
the larger dataset in Stanley et al. (2016) with this figure, suggests a range of riverine yields of 0.4–6 percent. 
Note that the riverine CO2 figure in Deemer et al. (2016) of 7,954 mg C/m2/day was based on original 1,800 Tg 
C/y datum in Raymond et al. (2013), which has been reduced using the Lauerwald et al. (2015) updated estimate 
of 659 Tg C/y figure and is thus 2,872 mg C/m2/day. 
Considering the data in Table 6A.3, the average yield for reservoirs and lakes is 19percent (8–27 percent) while 
the average for rivers is much lower at 3.5 percent (0.4–6 percent). Data ranges rather than standard deviations 
are given owing to the potential for overlap between the underlying datasets. These CH4 yield data are used to 
estimate the MCF. On the same basis as the Bo calculation, 1.067 kg of O2 are required to oxidise one kg of 
glucose. Considering that 40 percent of glucose is carbon, this implies the COD of glucose on a carbon basis is 
2.67 kg COD/kg C. So 0.19 kg CH4-C/kg (CH4-C + CO2-C) corresponds to 0.071 kg CH4-C/kg COD. Taking a 
global perspective, Tranvik et al. (2009) state that approximately 1.4 Pg of carbon is emitted from inland waters 
at CO2 and a further 0.1 Pg as CH4, the remainder being sequestered in sediments or lost to the ocean. Thus of 
3.0 Pg of carbon inputs, 50 percent is emitted to the atmosphere. Correcting the previous figure for this yield and 
converting to kg CH4 suggests 0.071 [kg CH4-C/kg COD] × (12.01 + 1.00797×4)/12.01 [kg CH4/kg CH4-C] × 
0.5 = 0.048 kg CH4/kg COD. For use in conjunction with Bo then MCF = 0.048/0.25 = 0.19 (0.08–0.27) for lakes 
and reservoirs. In the same way, MCF = 0.035 (0.004–0.06) for rivers and streams.

Annex 6A.5 Estimation of default emission factors for N2O in 
domestic wastewater treatment plants 
We reviewed scientific literature to find emission factors from full-scale domestic wastewater treatment plants. 
Although much literature exists regarding N2O emission from wastewater treatment processes, relatively few 
studies relate to full-scale treatment plants and provide key information such as influent nitrogen load. We 
collected 30 data and found that N2O emission correlated with influent nitrogen load (Figure 6A.1). Emission 
factors and references are listed in Table 6A.4 and Table 6A.5. Specific and relatively new/uncommon treatment 
processes such as membrane bioreactors were intentionally excluded from this list in order to develop emission 
factors for the most typical and widely used treatment processes globally. Although N2O emissions vary by the 
type of nitrogen removal process used, more on-site exhaustive monitoring data are required to develop different 
N2O emission factors for different treatment processes.

Annex 6A.6 Estimation of default emission factors for N2O in 
effluent 
Table 6.11 in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines was based on expert judgment. For the refinement of these guidelines, 
literature was reviewed for reported yields of N2O from environments with known oxygen saturation conditions. 
A total of 62 data points for well-oxygenated environments and 59 for low-oxygen environments were obtained 
from the following literature: Kaplan et al. (1978); McElroy et al. (1978); Goreau et al. (1980); McCarthy et al. 
(1984); Seitzinger et al. (1984); Kaplan and Wofsy (1985); Seitzinger (1988); Yoshida (1988); Mantoura et al. 
(1993); Kester et al. (1997); Seitzinger and Kroeze (1998); Punshon and Moore (2004); Frame and Casciotti 
(2010); Beaulieu et al. (2011); Yan et al. (2012); Zhu et al. (2013); Ji et al. (2015); Wang et al. (2015); He et al. 
(2017). 
These data suggested a mean yield of 0.019 kg N2O-N/kg-N for low oxygen environments (for use in Tier 3 
methodologies, if needed) and 0.005 kg N2O-N/kg-N for well-oxygenated environments (default Tier 1 factor). 
Calculation of a simple standard deviation is inappropriate for this data, since it is a proportion. Therefore, 
confidence intervals for these averages were calculated using the adjusted Wald method for small proportions 
(Bonett & Price 2012). The resulting 95percent (two tailed) limits are 0.0041–0.0912 and 0.0–0.0753 
respectively.
