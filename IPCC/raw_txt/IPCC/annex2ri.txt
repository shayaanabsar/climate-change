ANNEX 2
IPCC AND CORINAIR SOURCE
CATEGORIES
This chapter briefly explains the origins of the IPCC and CORINAIR, the
correspondences between the IPCC and CORINAIR/UNECE source categories,
and outlines how to report the results from the CORINAIR inventory system in an
IPCC format. At present, CORINAIR/UNECE is the only known inventory
programme used by many countries of which the scope and objectives
significantly overlap those of the IPCC. Many individual countries certainly have
other detailed national inventory approaches which have similar characteristics to
CORINAIR. For these countries, this example of reconciling IPCC and CORINAIR
source categories may be helpful in addressing similar conversion problems. The
IPCC/OECD/IEA Programme will work with interested countries and other
organisations as far as possible to help achieve correspondence with IPCC
categories in order to avoid duplication of effort at national and international
levels.
A2.1 Origins
The IPCC source and sink categories for the estimation and reporting of
national inventories of greenhouse gas emissions is slightly different than
categories that have been developed by the Commission of European
Communities (CEC) for use in Europe. The reasons for these differences
lie, first, in the origin of the two inventory systems and, second, in the
primary uses for the inventory data. However, for the recent inventories
(from 1994 and onwards) these systems are consistent and harmonised.
The European Union (EU) emission inventory programme (CORINAIR) was
set up by the European Council of Ministers in 1985 to assist in the
development of consistent, comparable and transparent national inventories
for “conventional” air pollutants such as SOx, NOx, and VOC. The first
CORINAIR  inventories were developed for 1985. The next CORINAIR
inventories, for the year 1990, were initiated by the European Environment
Agency Task Force. For these inventories, the pollutant list was extended to
include NH3, CO, CO2 and N2O, as well as to separate CH4 from
NMVOC.  Support was given to Central and Eastern European countries
resulting in emission inventories for 1990, covering 29 countries.
A further development of the CORINAIR system came in 1991, when the
United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) helped define
the main CORINAIR categories as a basis for reporting under the Long
Range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP) Convention. The pollutants of
interest not only include those covered in specific protocols (i.e. SOx, NOx,
and VOC) but also pollutants that influence the critical loads of acidic
deposition, such as NH3.  In 1992, the UNECE also established a Task Force
on Emission Inventories (TFEI) with a main objective to develop a
guidebook for emission inventories summarising the CORINAIR/UNECE
recommendations on estimation and verification methods.

A2.2 CORINAIR Methodology and its
Applications
The joint EMEP/CORINAIR Atmospheric Emission Inventory Guidebook
(EMEP/CORINAIR Guidebook) was first published in February, 1996. It is
available as a CD-ROM and on the Internet. The UNECE/TFEI will continue
its work of improving and updating the EMEP/CORINAIR Guidebook in co-
operation with the European Environment Agency (EEA). In 1995, the
CORINAIR project was integrated into the work programme of the EEA,
and the European Topic Centre on Air Emissions (ETC/AE) was contracted
to continue the CORINAIR project. The main task of the ETC/AE is to
assist the participation of the EU-15 countries, as well as other European
countries to report  national inventories as required under international
obligations. The CORINAIR project is an annual European air emission
inventory, for which the list of pollutants has been extended to include
heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants (POPs), from the reporting
year 1994 onwards.
The CORINAIR methodology requires countries to collect emission
estimates using a detailed source nomenclature (SNAP) and a detailed
spatial level (NUTS level 3). From the resulting emission inventory, the
methodology can be used to aggregate, allocate and report emission
estimates for different reporting purposes. For example:
• IPCC format (UN FCCC);
• UNECE/EMEP (LRTAP Convention);
• EU Monitoring Mechanism of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions.
Complete harmonisation between the IPCC and CORINAIR source
categories has been achieved for the reporting year 1994, and onwards.
The purpose of inventory development under UNECE is to support the
monitoring of progress of the implementation of the LRTAP protocols. One
of the principal users of the inventories are modellers who support the
implementation of the Protocols under the LRTAP. The main requirement
of the modellers is to estimate the sources of SOx, NOx, NMVOC, and
NH3 emissions on a 50 km  x 50 km square grid basis across Europe. These
data are then the basis of the calculations estimating acidic deposition and
photochemical oxidants across Europe which tie back to the concepts of
"critical loads" for acidificate and “critical levels” for photochemical oxidant.
The calculations show national progress or future acquirement to meet
these critical thresholds.
A2.3 Correspondences Between IPCC and
CORINAIR Source Categories
The UNECE requirement to establish a much more detailed understanding
of the physical source and geographic distribution of emissions has led to
source categories based on the physical characteristics of the sources of
pollutants. The IPCC has proceeded on the basis that socio-economic
sources are the easiest and most appropriate groupings for describing

emissions, which in turn will facilitate the use of inventories for policy
analysis.
The CORINAIR/UNECE system uses type of physical plant or vehicle, as
the fundamental basis for emission estimation. This allows high accuracy in
description of individual point or mobile sources and in use of appropriate
emission factors for conventional pollutants. From the resulting detailed
emissions inventory, the methodology can be used to aggregate, allocate and
report emission estimates for different reporting purposes. For example,
the CORINAIR methodology has been improved to include energy statistics
and to enable countries to report emissions in complete accordance with
the IPCC Guidelines.

categories at the highest aggregated IPCC level (Short Summary Report

A2.4 Harmonisation Between IPCC and
CORINAIR Source Categories
Progress has been made in the harmonisation of the IPCC and
EMEP/CORINAIR methodologies to allow more direct comparison of the
two approaches. These changes are mainly in the Energy Chapter of the
Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines:
• 
Biomass fuels are allocated to the various source categories.
• 
Emissions from fuel used for electricity and heat production by
autoproducers are included in the sector where they are generated
and not within the transformation industries.
• 
Treatment of evaporative emissions (NMVOCs) from road transport
in the Tier 2 method of IPCC is made consistent with CORINAIR.
Combustion and evaporative emissions are to be reported
separately. However, in the Tier I IPCC method, all emissions from
road transport are included together under fuel combustion.
Development of a Tier 2 method for estimating emissions from aircraft.
A2.5 How to Transform a CORINAIR
Inventory into an IPCC Inventory
For the IPCC Short Summary Report Table (Table 7B), which is at the most
aggregated level of reporting, Table A2-1 provides correspondence for the
CORINAIR definitions. For the Summary Report (Table 7A) and the
Sectoral Report Tables (Tables 1-6), more detailed alignment between the
IPCC source/sink categories and the CORINAIR definitions is required. The
joint 
UNECE/CORINAIR 
Guidebook 
and 
appropriate 
computer
programme have been revised to facilitate conversion from a CORINAIR to
an IPCC inventory at the level of detail required for the Sectoral Report
Tables.

A2.6 Looking Forward
Both the IPCC and the UNECE/CORINAIR programmes are committed to
on-going harmonisation between the two methodologies which have
become increasingly compatible over the years. In order to ensure that the
CORINAIR methodology evolves in a completely consistently manner with
the IPCC Guidelines, there will continue to be regular contact between the
two programmes. This will both facilitate an exchange of ideas and minimise
duplication of effort.
