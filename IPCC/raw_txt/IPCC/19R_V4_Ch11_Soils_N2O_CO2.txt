NITROUS OXIDE (N2O) EMISSIONS FROM 
MANAGED SOILS 
This section presents the methods and equations for estimating total national anthropogenic emissions of N2O 
(direct and indirect) from managed soils. The generic equations presented here can also be used for estimating 
N2O within specific land-use categories or by condition-specific variables (e.g., N additions to rice paddies) if the 
country can disaggregate the activity data to that level (i.e., N use activity within a specific land use).  
Nitrous oxide is produced naturally in soils through the processes of nitrification and denitrification. Nitrification 
is the aerobic microbial oxidation of ammonium to nitrate, and denitrification is the anaerobic microbial reduction 
of nitrate to nitrogen gas (N2). Nitrous oxide is a gaseous intermediate in the reaction sequence of denitrification 
and a by-product of nitrification that leaks from microbial cells into the soil and ultimately into the atmosphere. 
One of the main controlling factors in this reaction is the availability of inorganic N in the soil. This methodology, 
therefore, estimates N2O emissions using human-induced net N additions to soils (e.g., synthetic or organic 
fertilisers, deposited manure, crop residues, sewage sludge), or of mineralisation of N in soil organic matter 
following drainage/management of organic soils, or cultivation/land-use change on mineral soils (e.g., Forest 
Land/Grassland/Settlements converted to Cropland). 
The emissions of N2O that result from anthropogenic N inputs or N mineralisation occur through both a direct 
pathway (i.e., directly from the soils to which the N is added/released), and through two indirect pathways: (i) 
following volatilisation of ammonia (NH3) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) from managed soils and from fossil fuel 
combustion and biomass burning, and the subsequent redeposition of these gases and their products NH4+ and 
NO3- to soils and waters; and (ii) after leaching and runoff of N, mainly as NO3-, from managed soils. The principal 
pathways are illustrated in Figure 11.1. 
Direct emissions of N2O from managed soils are estimated separately from indirect emissions, though using a 
common set of activity data. The Tier 1 methodologies do not take into account different land cover, soil type, 
climatic conditions or management practices (other than specified below). Neither do they take account of any lag 
time for direct emissions from crop residue N, and allocate these emissions to the year in which the residues are 
returned to the soil. These factors are not considered for direct or (where appropriate, indirect) emissions because 
limited data are available to provide appropriate emission factors. Countries that have data to show that default 
factors are inappropriate for their country should utilise Tier 2 equations or Tier 3 approaches and include a full 
explanation for the values used. 
11.2.1 Direct N2O emissions 
In most soils, an increase in available N enhances nitrification and denitrification rates which then increase the 
production of N2O. Increases in available N can occur through human-induced N additions or change of land-use 
and/or management practices that mineralise soil organic N. 
The following N sources are included in the methodology for estimating direct N2O emissions from managed soils: 
• synthetic N fertilisers (FSN); 
• organic N applied as fertiliser (e.g., animal manure, compost, sewage sludge, rendering waste, waste water 
effluent) (FON); 
• urine and dung N deposited on pasture, range and paddock by grazing animals (FPRP);

• N in crop residues (above-ground and below-ground), including from N-fixing crops 1 and from forages during 
pasture renewal 2 (FCR); 
• N mineralisation associated with loss of soil organic matter resulting from change of land use or management 
of mineral soils (FSOM); and 
• Drainage/management of organic soils (i.e., Histosols) 3 (FOS).

1 Biological nitrogen fixation has been removed as a direct source of N2O because of the lack of evidence of significant 
emissions arising from the fixation process itself (Rochette and Janzen, 2005). These authors concluded that the N2O 
emissions induced by the growth of legume crops/forages may be estimated solely as a function of the above-ground and 
below-ground nitrogen inputs from crop/forage residue (the nitrogen residue from forages is only accounted for during 
pasture renewal).  Conversely, the release of N by mineralisation of soil organic matter as a result of change of land use or 
management is now included as an additional source. These are significant adjustments to the methodology previously 
described in the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines. Countries may consider a Tier 2 approach for disaggregating low-N 
concentration crop residues from high-N concentration residues. Current knowledge shows no evidence for such a 
disaggregation at Tier 1 (Graham et al. 2017). 
2 The nitrogen residue from perennial forage crops is only accounted for during periodic pasture renewal, i.e. not necessarily 
on an annual basis as is the case with annual crops. 
3 Soils are organic if they satisfy the requirements 1 and 2, or 1 and 3 below (FAO, 1998): 1. Thickness of 10 cm or more. A 
horizon less than 20 cm thick must have 12 percent or more organic carbon when mixed to a depth of 20 cm; 2. If the soil is 
never saturated with water for more than a few days, and contains more than 20 percent (by weight) organic carbon (about 
35 percent organic matter); 3. If the soil is subject to water saturation episodes and has either: (i) at least 12 percent (by 
weight) organic carbon (about 20 percent organic matter) if it has no clay; or (ii) at least 18 percent (by weight) organic 
carbon (about 30 percent organic matter) if it has 60 percent or more clay; or (iii) an intermediate, proportional amount of 
organic carbon for intermediate amounts of clay (FAO, 1998).

Tier 2 
If more detailed emission factors and corresponding activity data are available to a country than are presented in 
Equation 11.1, further disaggregation of the terms in the equation can be undertaken. For example, if emission 
factors and activity data are available for the application of synthetic fertilisers and organic N (FSN and FON) under 
different conditions i, Equation 11.1 would be expanded to become 5: 
 
4 When the total annual quantity of N applied to flooded paddy rice is known, this N input may be multiplied by a lower default 
emission factor applicable to this crop, EF1FR (Table 11.1) or, where a country-specific emission factor has been determined, 
by that factor instead.  
5 It is important to note that Equation 11.2 is just one of many possible modifications to Equation 11.1 when using the Tier 2 
method.  The eventual form of Equation 11.2 will depend upon the availability of condition-specific emission factors and the 
ability to which a country can disaggregate its activity data.

Compilers can develop Tier 2 emission factors specific to mitigation options such as the application of nitrification 
inhibitors (Akiyama et al. 2010, Ruser & Schulz 2015, Gilsanz et al. 2016). Compilers can also consider an 
exponential response of N2O emissions to N application by developing country-specific emission factors (van 
Groenigen et al. 2010, Shcherbak et al. 2014, Gerber et al. 2016).  This method will require activity data on specific 
fertiliser application rates to individual fields in order to apply rate-specific emission factors that capture the 
exponential response 6. The influence of other environmental conditions, such as freeze-thaw cycles (Wagner-
Riddle et al. 2017) can also be addressed with the development of Tier 2 emission factors. 
Conversion of N2O–N emissions to N2O emissions for reporting purposes is performed by using the following 
equation: 
N2O = N2O–N * 44/28 
Tier 3 
Tier 3 methods are modelling or measurement approaches. Models are useful because in appropriate forms they 
can relate the soil and environmental variables responsible for N2O emissions to the size of those emissions. These 
relationships may then be used to predict emissions from whole countries or regions for which experimental 
measurements are impracticable. Models should only be used after validation by representative experimental 
measurements. Care should also be taken to ensure that the emission estimates developed through the use of models 
or measurements account for all anthropogenic N2O emissions7. Guidance that provides a sound scientific basis 
for the development of a Tier 3 Model-based system is given in Chapter 2, Section 2.5. 
According to Equation 11.1, direct emissions of N2O from managed soils are calculated in the Tier 1 approach on 
the basis of total N applied to soils as synthetic and organic fertilisers and/or soil N mineralisation. The processes 
of run-off of N, volatilization of NH3 and NOx, emissions of N2O, and leaching of N, however, do not occur 
simultaneously but in a sequence, with the peak of run-off and NH3+NOx volatilization happening before emissions 
of N2O and losses of N through leaching. For example, an application technique affecting the volatilization rate of 
NH3+NOx is likely to change the flow rates of subsequent processes. To illustrate, injecting slurry instead of 
broadcasting the organic amendment may increase the availability of N for N2O emissions and/or N-leaching, 
depending on climatic and soil conditions (Chadwick et al. 2011). It is therefore good practice to carefully assess 
such ’pollution swapping’ effects when implementing a Tier 3 approach and adopting the N-flow principle when 
estimating direct N2O emissions. The same applies when estimating indirect N2O emissions from leaching and 
runoff (see Section 11.2.2.1). This adoption can be achieved by accounting for the decreased pool of nitrogen that 
is available for direct N2O emissions (and nitrogen leaching). 
11.2.1.2 CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTORS 
Tiers 1 and 2 
Three emission factors (EF) are needed to estimate direct N2O emissions from managed soils. The default values 
presented here may be used in the Tier 1 equation or in the Tier 2 equation in combination with country-specific 
emission factors. The first EF (EF1) refers to the amount of N2O emitted from the various synthetic and organic N 
applications to soils, including crop residue and mineralisation of soil organic carbon in mineral soils due to land-
use change or management. The second EF (EF2) refers to the amount of N2O emitted from an area of 
drained/managed organic soils, and the third EF (EF3PRP) estimates the amount of N2O emitted from urine and 
dung N deposited by grazing animals on pasture, range and paddock. Default emission factors for the Tier 1 method 
are summarised in Table 11.1. For EF2, see guidance in 2013 Supplement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National 
Greenhouse Gas Inventories: Wetlands, Chapter 2, Table 2.5. 
The default value for EF1 has been set at 1 percent of the N applied to soils or released through activities that result 
in mineralisation of organic matter in mineral soils 8. Given the growing number of studies highlighting the role 
 
6 The Tier 1 method is designed as a simple method for estimating direct N2O emissions with top-down commodity data on 
fertiliser production, import/export, or sales data.  With these data, it is not possible to know the application rates to individual 
fields, which is needed for emission factors that are adjusted with application rates. However, variable emission factors can 
be developed with the Tier 2 method.  
7 Natural N2O emissions on managed land are assumed to be equal to emissions on unmanaged land. These latter emissions 
are very low. Therefore, nearly all emissions on managed land are considered anthropogenic. Estimates using the IPCC 
methodology are of the same magnitude as total measured emissions from managed land. Some Tier 3 methods may estimate 
only part of or aggregate some of the emission sources. Developers of Tier 3 methods should be aware of which components 
of Equation 11.2 are included in the estimate produced by their country-specific method.  
8 The value of EF1 draws on a much larger number of measurements (see Annex 11A.2) than were available for the previous 
value used for EF1 in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines (Bouwman et al. 2002a,b; Novoa & Tejeda 2006; Stehfest & Bouwman 
2006).

of climate and fertiliser type in determining EF1 (Flechard et al. 2007, Aguilera et al. 2013, Cayuela et al. 2017), 
alternative emission factors that are disaggregated by climatic zone and fertiliser type are also provided. In wet 
climates, the default value has been set at 0.6 percent of organic N inputs and 1.6 percent of synthetic N inputs. In 
dry climates, the default value has been set at 0.5 percent of N inputs for both organic and synthetic N. These 
alternative factor values for EF1 can be used by compilers that are able to disaggregate their activity data by 
climate9 and fertiliser type. There are data to suggest that the emission factor could also be further disaggregated 
as part of a Tier 2 method. This disaggregation could be based on (1) environmental factors (soil organic C content, 
soil texture, drainage, soil pH and climate such as temperature and freeze-thaw cycle); and (2) management-related 
factors (N application rate per fertiliser type; fertiliser type, liquid or solid form of organic fertiliser; irrigation and 
type of crop with differences between legumes, non-leguminous arable crops, and grass) (e.g. Cayuela et al. 2017, 
Chadwick et al. 2018, Rochette et al. 2018, Wagner-Riddle et al. 2017).  
 
 
9 Wet climates occur in temperate and boreal zones where the ratio of annual precipitation: potential evapotranspiration > 1, 
and tropical zones where annual precipitation > 1000 mm. Dry climate occur in temperate and boreal zones where the ratio 
of annual precipitation: potential evapotranspiration < 1, and tropical zones where annual precipitation < 1000 mm (cf. Figure 
3A.5.1 in Chapter 3 of Vol. 4 provides a map subdividing wet and dry climates based on these criteria).

4 Disaggregation of EF1 and EF3PRP, CPP by climate (based on long-term averages): Wet climates occur in temperate and boreal zones where 
the ratio of annual precipitation: potential evapotranspiration > 1, and tropical zones where annual precipitation > 1000 mm. Dry climates 
occur in temperate and boreal zones where the ratio of annual precipitation: potential evapotranspiration < 1, and tropical zones where 
annual precipitation < 1000 mm (cf. Figure 3A.5.1 in Chapter 3 of Vol. 4 provides a map subdividing wet and dry climates based on these 
criteria). In wet climates, the EF1 is further disaggregated by synthetic fertiliser N inputs and other N inputs.  
5 This emission factor should be used for synthetic fertiliser applications, and fertiliser mixtures that include both synthetic and organic 
forms of N. 
6 Other N input refers to organic amendments, animal manures (e.g. slurries, digested manures), N in crop residues and mineralised N from 
soil organic matter decomposition. 
7 Disaggregation of EF1FR: Single and multiple drainage also include alternate wetting and drying. Disaggregated EF1FR for rain-fed and 
deep-water systems not provided due to lack of data. The EF1 should be used for upland rice. 
Notes: 
EF1: Uncertainty range of disaggregated EF1 based on the 95% confidence interval of fitted values. Uncertainty range of aggregated EF1 is 
based on the 2.5th to 97.5th percentile of the dataset (See methods, data and results in Annex 11A.2). 
EF1FR:  Uncertainty range is based on the 2.5th to 97.5th percentile (See methods and data in Annex 11A.3). 
EF3PRP, CPP and EF3PRP, SO: Uncertainty range is based on the 2.5th to 97.5th percentile (See methods and data in Annex 11A.4).  
For EF2, see guidance in 2013 Supplement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories: Wetlands, Chapter 2, 
Table 2.5. 
Compilers that are able to disaggregate their activity data from all or some of these factors may choose to use 
disaggregated emission factors with the Tier 2 approach.  
The default value for EF3PRP is 0.4 percent of the N deposited by all animal types except ‘sheep’ and ‘other’ animals. 
For these latter species, a default emission factor of 0.3 percent of the N deposited may be used 10. EF3PRP for cattle, 
 
10 This is an update on the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, with over 400 cattle and sheep dung and urine EF3 values collated from 13 
countries (See Annex 11A.4). As noted in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, reasons for the lower EF3PRP for sheep include more 
even urine distribution (smaller and more frequent urinations), and smaller effects on soil compaction during grazing. There 
are no or very limited data for N2O emission factors of other animal types, and the emission factor for poultry and swine is 
assumed to be the same as for cattle. However, a value of 0.3% of the nitrogen deposited may be used for animals classified 
as ‘other animals’ which includes goats, horses, mules, donkeys, camels, reindeer, and camelids, as these are likely to have

pigs and poultry (EF3PRP, CPP) is also disaggregated by wet and dry climates with values of 0.6 percent and 0.2 
percent, respectively. There is no difference in EF3PRP for sheep and other animals (EF3PRP, SO) when disaggregated 
into wet and dry climates, therefore only an aggregated value is provided. 
11.2.1.3 CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
Tiers 1 and 2 
This section describes generic methods for estimating the amount of various N inputs to soils (FSN, FON, FPRP, FCR, 
FSOM, FOS) that are needed for the Tier 1 and Tier 2 methodologies (Equations 11.1 and 11.2). 
Applied synthetic fertiliser (FSN) 
The term FSN refers to the annual amount of synthetic N fertiliser applied to soils 11. It is estimated from the total 
amount of synthetic fertiliser consumed annually. Annual fertiliser consumption data may be collected from 
official country statistics, often recorded as fertiliser sales and/or as domestic production and imports. If country-
specific data are not available, data can be used from the International Fertilizer Association (IFA) 
(http://www.fertilizer.org/ifa/statistics.asp) on total fertiliser use by type and by crop, or from the Food and 
Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) (http://fao.org/faostat/) on synthetic fertiliser consumption. 
It may be useful to compare national statistics to international databases such as those of the IFA and FAO. If 
sufficient data are available, fertiliser use may be disaggregated by fertiliser type, crop type and climatic regime 
for major crops. These data may be useful in developing revised emission estimates if inventory methods are 
improved in the future. It should be noted that most data sources (including FAO) might limit reporting to 
agricultural N uses, although applications may also occur on Forest Land, Settlements, or other lands. This 
unaccounted N is likely to account for a small proportion of the overall emissions. However, it is recommended 
that countries seek out this additional information whenever possible. 
Applied organic N fertilisers (FON) 
The term “applied organic N fertiliser” (FON) refers to the amount of organic N inputs applied to soils other than 
by grazing animals and is calculated using Equation 11.3. This includes applied animal manure, sewage sludge 
applied to soil, compost applied to soils, as well as other organic amendments of regional importance to agriculture 
(e.g., rendering waste, guano, brewery waste, etc.). Organic N fertiliser (FON) is calculated using Equation 11.3:

nitrogen excretion rates and patterns that are more similar to sheep than to cattle. For disaggregation of EF3 by dung and 
urine nitrogen for each livestock group, see Annex 11.4. 
11 For the Tier 1 approach, the amounts of applied mineral nitrogen fertilisers (FSN) and of applied organic nitrogen fertilisers 
(FON) are no longer adjusted for the amounts of NH3 and NOx volatilisation after application to soil.  This is a change from 
the methodology described in the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines. The reason for this change is that field studies that have 
determined N2O emission factors for applied N were not adjusted for volatilisation when they were estimated. In other words, 
these emission factors were determined from: fertiliser-induced N2O–N emitted / total amount of N applied, and not from: 
fertiliser-induced N2O–N emitted / (total amount of N applied – NH3 and NOx volatilised). As a result, adjusting the amount 
of N input for volatilisation before multiplying it with the emission factor would in fact underestimate total N2O emissions. 
Countries using Tier 2 or Tier 3 approaches should be aware that correction for NH3/NOx volatilisation after mineral or 
organic N application to soil may be required depending on the emission factor and/or the inventory methodology used.

The term FAM is determined by adjusting the amount of manure N available (NMMS_Avb; see Equation 10.34 in 
Chapter 10) for the amount of managed manure used for feed (FracFEED), burned for fuel (FracFUEL), or used for 
construction (FracCNST) as shown in Equation 11.4. Data for FracFUEL, FracFEED, FracCNST can be obtained from 
official statistics or a survey of experts. However, if these data are not available use NMMS_Avb as FAM without 
adjusting for FracFUEL, FracFEED, FracCNST.

Urine and dung from grazing animals (FPRP) 
The term FPRP refers to the annual amount of N deposited on pasture, range and paddock soils by grazing animals. 
It is important to note that the N from managed animal manure applied to soils is included in the FAM term of FON. 
The term FPRP is estimated using Equation 11.5 from the number of animals in each livestock species/category T 
(N(T)), the annual average amount of N excreted by each livestock species/category T (Nex(T)), and the fraction of 
this N deposited on pasture, range and paddock soils by each livestock species/category T (MS(T, PRP)). The data 
needed for this equation can be obtained from the livestock chapter (see Chapter 10, Section 10.5). 
Equation 11.5 provides an estimate of the amount of N deposited by grazing animals:

2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Crop residue N, including N-fixing crops and forage/ pasture renewal, returned to soils (FCR) 
The term FCR refers to the amount of N in crop residues (above-ground and below-ground), including N-fixing 
crops, returned to soils annually13. It also includes the N from N-fixing and non-N-fixing forages11.16 mineralized 
during forage or pasture renewal14. It is estimated from crop yield statistics and default factors for above-/below-
ground residue:yield ratios and residue N contents. In addition, the method accounts for the effect of residue 
burning or other removal of residues (direct emissions of N2O from residue burning are addressed under Chapter 
2, Section 2.4). Because different crop types vary in residue:yield ratios, renewal time and N contents, separate 
calculations should be performed for major crop types and then N values from all crop types are summed up. At a 
minimum, it is recommended that crops be segregated into: 1) non-N-fixing grain crops (e.g., maize, rice, wheat, 
barley); 2) N-fixing grains and pulses (e.g., soybean, dry beans, chickpea, lentils); 3) root and tuber crops (e.g., 
potato, sweet potato, cassava); 4) N-fixing forage crops (alfalfa, clover); and 5) other forages including perennial 
grasses and grass/clover pastures. Equation 11.6 provides the equation to estimate N from crop residues and 
forage/pasture renewal, for a Tier 1 approach. As regards crop residue N, a cross check with the amount of 
NbeddingMS of the Equation 10.34 “Managed manure N available for application to managed soils, feed, fuel or 
construction uses” (Volume 4, Chapter 10 Section 10.5.4) and biomass burning (Volume 4, Chapter 5 Section 
5.2.4), relative to the amount of agricultural residues that is returned to soils other than the amount of agricultural 
residues that is removed for other purposes (e.g. bedding) or burnt should be done, in order to eliminate the 
possibility of double counting.

13 The equation to estimate FCR has been modified from the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines to account for the contribution of 
the below-ground nitrogen to the total input of nitrogen from crop residues, which previously was ignored in the estimate of 
FCR. As a result, FCR now represents a more accurate estimate of the amount of nitrogen input from crop residue, which 
makes it possible to assess the contribution to residue nitrogen arising from the growth of forage legumes such as alfalfa, 
where the harvesting of virtually all the above-ground dry matter results in no significant residue except the root system. 
14 The inclusion of nitrogen from forage or pasture renewal is a change from the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines.

Data on crop yield statistics (yields and area harvested, by crop) may be obtained from national sources. If such 
data are not available, FAO publishes data on crop production: (http://fao.org/faostat/). 
Since yield statistics for many crops are reported as field-dry or fresh weight, a correction factor should be applied 
to estimate dry matter yields (Crop(T)) where appropriate (Equation 11.7). The proper correction to be used is 
dependent on the standards that are applied for yield reporting, which may vary between countries. Alternatively, 
the default values for dry matter content given in Table 11.1a may be used.

Mineralised N resulting from loss of soil organic C stocks in mineral soils through land-use change or 
management practices (FSOM) 16 
The term FSOM refers to the amount of N mineralised from loss in soil organic C in mineral soils through land-use 
change or management practices. As explained in Chapter 2, Section 2.3.3, land-use change and a variety of 
management practices can have a significant impact on soil organic C storage. Organic C and N are intimately 
linked in soil organic matter. Where soil C is lost through oxidation as a result of land-use or management change, 
this loss will be accompanied by a simultaneous mineralisation of N. Where a loss of soil C occurs, this mineralised 
N is regarded as an additional source of N available for conversion to N2O (Smith and Conen, 2004); just as 
mineral N released from decomposition of crop residues, for example, becomes a source. The same default 
emission factor (EF1) is applied to mineralised N from soil organic matter loss as is used for direct emissions 
resulting from fertiliser and organic N inputs to agricultural land. This is because the ammonium and nitrate 
resulting from soil organic matter mineralisation is of equal value as a substrate for the microorganisms producing 
N2O by nitrification and denitrification, no matter whether the mineral N source is soil organic matter loss from 
land-use or management change, decomposition of crop residues, synthetic fertilisers or organic amendments. 
(Note: the opposite process to mineralisation, whereby inorganic N is sequestered into newly formed SOM, is not 
taken account of in the calculation of the mineralisation N source. This is because of the different dynamics of 
SOM decomposition and formation, and also because reduced tillage in some circumstances can increase both 
SOM and N2O emission). 
For all situations where soil C losses occur (as calculated in Chapter 2, Equation 2.25) the Tier 1 and 2 methods 
for calculating the release of N by mineralisation are shown below: 
Calculation steps for estimating changes in N supply from mineralisation 
Step 1:  Calculate the average annual loss of soil C (∆CMineral, LU) for the area, over the inventory period, using 
Equation 2.25 in Chapter 2. Using the Tier 1 approach, the value for ∆CMineral, LU will have a single value for all 
land-uses and management systems. Using Tier 2, the value for ∆CMineral, LU will be disaggregated by individual 
land-use and/or management systems. 
Step 2:  Estimate the N mineralised as a consequence of this loss of soil C (FSOM), using Equation 11.8:

R 
= C:N ratio of the soil organic matter. A default value of 15 (uncertainty range from 10 to 30) 
for the C:N ratio (R) may be used for situations involving land-use change from Forest Land 
or Grassland to Cropland, in the absence of more specific data for the area. A default value 
of 10 (range from 8 to 15) may be used for situations involving management changes on 
Cropland Remaining Cropland. C:N ratio can change over time, land use, or management 
practice 17. If countries can document changes in C:N ratio, then different values can be used 
over the time series, land use, or management practice. 
LU 
= land-use and/or management system type 
 
16 The inclusion of the term FSOM is a change from the previous Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines, which did not include the N 
from mineralisation associated with a loss of soil organic C. 
17 Information on C:N ratios in forest and cropped soils may be found in the following references: Aitkenhead-Peterson et al. 
2005; Garten et al. 2000; John et al. 2005; Lobe et al. 2001; Snowdon et al. 2005, and other references cited by these authors. 
Chapter 11: N2O Emissions from Managed Soils, and CO2 Emissions from Lime and Urea Application 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
11.21 
Step 3:  For Approach 1 for land representation, the value for FSOM is calculated in a single step. For Approaches 
2 and 3 for land representation, FSOM is calculated by summing across all land-uses and/or management system 
types (LU). 
Countries that are not able to estimate gross changes of mineral soil C will create a bias in the N2O estimate, and 
it is good practice to acknowledge this limitation in the reporting documentation. It is also good practice to use 
specific data for the C:N ratios for the disaggregated land areas, if these are available, in conjunction with the data 
for carbon changes. 
Area of drained/managed organic soils (FOS) 
The term FOS refers to the total annual area (ha) of drained/managed organic soils (see footnote 3 for definition). 
This definition is applicable for both the Tier 1 and Tier 2 methods. For all land uses, the areas should be stratified 
by climate zone (temperate and tropical). In addition, for temperate Forest Land the areas should be further 
stratified by soil fertility (nutrient rich and nutrient poor). The area of drained/managed organic soils (FOS) may be 
collected from official national statistics. Alternatively, total areas of organic soils from each country are available 
from FAO (http://fao.org/faostat/), and expert judgement may be used to estimate areas that are drained/managed. 
For Forest Land, national data will be available at soil survey organisations and from wetland surveys, e.g., for 
international conventions. In case no stratification by soil fertility is possible, countries may rely on expert 
judgment.

No refinement. 
11.2.2 Indirect N2O emissions 
In addition to the direct emissions of N2O from managed soils that occur through a direct pathway (i.e., directly 
from the soils to which N is applied), emissions of N2O also take place through two indirect pathways (i.e., ‘off-
site’ N2O emission from N volatilisation/deposition and N leaching, as illustrated above in Section 11.2). 
The first of these pathways is the volatilisation of N as NH3 and oxides of N (NOx), and the deposition of these 
gases and their products NH4+ and NO3- onto soils and the surface of lakes and other waters. The sources of N as 
NH3 and NOx are not confined to agricultural fertilisers and manures, but also include fossil fuel combustion, 
biomass burning, and processes in the chemical industry (see Volume 1, Chapter 7, Section 7.3). Thus, these 
processes cause N2O emissions in an exactly analogous way to those resulting from deposition of agriculturally 
derived NH3 and NOx, following the application of synthetic and organic N fertilisers and /or urine and dung 
deposition from grazing animals. The second pathway is the leaching and runoff from land of N from synthetic 
and organic fertiliser additions, crop residues 18, mineralisation of N associated with loss of soil C in mineral and 
drained/managed organic soils through land-use change or management practices, and urine and dung deposition 
from grazing animals. Some of the inorganic N in or on the soil, mainly in the NO3- form, may bypass biological 
retention mechanisms in the soil/vegetation system by transport in overland water flow (runoff) and/or flow 
through soil macropores or pipe drains. Where NO3- is present in the soil in excess of biological demand, e.g., 
under cattle urine patches, the excess leaches through the soil profile. The nitrification and denitrification processes 
described at the beginning of this chapter transform some of the NH4+ and NO3- to N2O. This may take place in 
the groundwater below the land to which the N was applied, or in riparian zones receiving drain or runoff water, 
or in the ditches, streams, rivers and estuaries (and their sediments) into which the land drainage water eventually 
flows. 
This methodology described in this chapter addresses the following N sources of indirect N2O emissions from 
managed soils arising from agricultural inputs of N: 
• synthetic N fertilisers (FSN); 
• organic N applied as fertiliser (e.g., applied animal manure 19, compost, sewage sludge, rendering waste, waste 
water effluent and other organic amendments) (FON); 
• urine and dung N deposited on pasture, range and paddock by grazing animals (FPRP); 
 
18 Crop residues should be included as an N input into the leaching and runoff component. 
19 Volatilisation and subsequent deposition of nitrogen from the manure in manure management systems is covered in the 
manure management section of this volume.  
Chapter 11: N2O Emissions from Managed Soils, and CO2 Emissions from Lime and Urea Application 
11.22 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
• N in crop residues (above- and below-ground), including N-fixing crops and forage/pasture renewal returned 
to soils (FCR) 20; and 
• N mineralisation associated with loss of soil organic matter resulting from change of land use or management 
on mineral soils (FSOM). 
The generic Tier 1 and Tier 2 methods described below can be used to estimate aggregate total indirect N2O 
emissions from agricultural N additions to managed soils for an entire country. If a country is estimating its direct 
N2O from managed soils by land-use category, the indirect N2O emissions can also be estimated by the same 
disaggregation of land-use categories using the equations presented below with activity data, partitioning fractions, 
and/or emission factors specific for each land-use category. The methodology for estimating indirect N2O 
emissions from combustion-related and industrial sources is described in Volume 1, Chapter 7, Section 7.3.

illustrate how Equation 11.10 could be modified, when using the Tier 2 method. The eventual form of Equation 11.11 will 
depend upon the availability of land use and/or condition-specific partitioning fractions and/or emission factors and the ability 
to which a country can disaggregate its activity data.

Tier 3 
Tier 3 methods are modelling or measurement approaches. Models are useful as they can relate the variables 
responsible for the emissions to the size of those emissions. These relationships may then be used to predict 
emissions from whole countries or regions for which experimental measurements are impracticable. For more 
information refer to Chapter 2, Section 2.5, where guidance is given that provides a sound scientific basis for the 
development of a Tier 3 Model-based system. 
According to Equations 11.1, 11.9 and 11.10, direct and indirect emissions of N2O from managed soils are 
calculated in the Tier 1 approach on the basis of total N applied to soils as synthetic and organic fertilisers and/or 
soil N mineralisation. As noted in Section 11.2.1.1, the processes of run-off of N, volatilization of NH3 and NOx, 
emissions of N2O, and leaching of N, however, do not occur simultaneously but in a sequence, with the peak of 
run-off and NH3+NOx volatilization happening before emissions of N2O and losses of N through leaching. Refer 
to Section 11.2.1.1 for good practice guidance when implementing a Tier 3 approach and adopting the N-flow 
principle when estimating direct N2O emissions and indirect N2O emissions from leaching and runoff.  
11.2.2.2 CHOICE OF EMISSION, VOLATILISATION AND LEACHING 
FACTORS 
The method for estimating indirect N2O emissions includes two emission factors: one associated with volatilised 
and re-deposited N (EF4), and the second associated with N lost through leaching/runoff (EF5). The method also 
requires values for the fractions of N that are lost through volatilisation (FracGASF and FracGASM) or leaching/runoff 
(FracLEACH-(H)). The default values of all these factors are presented in Table 11.3. 
Note that in the Tier 1 method, for wet climates22 or in dry climate regions where irrigation (other than drip 
irrigation) is used, the default FracLEACH-(H) is 0.24. For dry climates, the default FracLEACH-(H) is zero. The climate 
threshold for FracLEACH-(H) can be refined at Tier 2 by countries that are able to disaggregate their activity data (see 
methodological suggestion in Table 11.3). 
Country-specific values for EF4 should be used with great caution because of the special complexity of 
transboundary atmospheric transport. Although inventory compilers may have specific measurements of N 
deposition and associated N2O flux, in many cases the deposited N may not have originated in their country. 
Similarly, some of the N that volatilises in their country may be transported to and deposited in another country, 
where different conditions that affect the fraction emitted as N2O may prevail. For these reasons the value of EF4 
is very difficult to determine, and the method presented in Volume 1, Chapter 7, Section 7.3 attributes all indirect 
N2O emissions resulting from inputs to managed soils to the country of origin of the atmospheric NOx and NH3, 
rather than the country to which the atmospheric N may have been transported. 
 
22 Wet climates occur in temperate and boreal zones where the ratio of annual precipitation: potential evapotranspiration > 1, 
and tropical zones where annual precipitation > 1000 mm. Dry climate occur in temperate and boreal zones where the ratio 
of annual precipitation: potential evapotranspiration < 1, and tropical zones where annual precipitation < 1000 mm (cf. Figure 
3A.5.1 in Chapter 3 of Vol. 4 provides a map subdividing wet and dry climates based on these criteria).

Notes:   
Disaggregation by climate for EF4 and FracLEACH-(H) (based on long-term averages): Wet climates occur in temperate and boreal zones where 
the ratio of annual precipitation: potential evapotranspiration > 1, and tropical zones where annual precipitation > 1000 mm. Dry climates 
occur in temperate and boreal zones where the ratio of annual precipitation: potential evapotranspiration < 1, and tropical zones where 
annual precipitation < 1000 mm (cf.  Figure 3A.5.1 in Chapter 3 of Vol. 4). 
EF4: The aggregated EF4 is the same as the aggregated EF1 (see Annex 11A.5). The disaggregated EF4 are the same as the EF1 disaggregated 
by wet and dry climates (see Table A.2 in Annex11A.2). Uncertainty range of the aggregated EF4 is based on the 2.5th to 97.5th percentile 
of the dataset, uncertainty range of disaggregated EF4 is based on the 95% confidence interval of fitted values (See methods and data in 
Annex 11A.2). 
EF5: This emission factor incorporates three components: EF5 = EF5g + EF5r + EF5e. EF5g: Emission factor for groundwater and surface 
drainage, including upstream supersaturated with N2O (N2O emitted mainly from degassing of groundwater); EF5r: Emission factor for 
rivers and reservoirs, including downstream (supersaturated N2O was already degassed and N2O mainly produced by 
nitrification/denitrification in situ); EF5e: Emission factor for estuaries. See methods in Annex 11A.6. Uncertainty range is based on the 
2.5th to 97.5th percentile. 
FracGASF: Calculated by weighting world fertiliser usage with number of observations from review papers (See methods and data in Annex 
11A.7). Uncertainty range based on the 2.5th to 97.5th percentile.  
FracGASM: See methods in Annex 11A.8. Uncertainty range is based on the 2.5th to 97.5th percentile. 
FracLEACH-(H): The FracLEACH-(H) only applies to wet climates. For dry climate, the default FracLEACH-(H) is taken as zero. See methods in Annex 
11A.9. Uncertainty range is based on the 2.5th to 97.5th percentile.  
For Tier 2, country specific FracLEACH-(H) can be estimated for N losses by leaching/runoff for regions where Σ(rain) - Σ(ET0) > soil water 
holding capacity, OR where irrigation (except drip irrigation) is used.  ET0 = Kpan * Ep, where ET0: reference evapotranspiration, Kpan: 
pan evaporation coefficient, Ep: pan evaporatio n. When Kpan is not available, reference evaporation can be estimated as ET0= 0.5 * Ep 
(Explanations of reference and pan evaporation: see Allen et al. 1998). Long-term mean of annual rainfall data should be used for estimating 
FracLEACH-(H). Precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data are available from global datasets, such as the CRU climate dataset 
(https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/hrg/), if country-specific data are not available.

11.2.2.3 CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
In order to estimate indirect N2O emissions from the various N additions to managed soils, the parameters FSN, 
FON, FPRP, FCR, FSOM need to be estimated. 
Applied synthetic fertiliser (FSN) 
The term FSN refers to the annual amount of synthetic fertiliser N applied to soils. Refer to the activity data section 
on direct N2O emissions from managed soils (Section 11.2.1.3) and obtain the value for FSN. 
Applied organic N fertilisers (FON) 
The term FON refers to the amount of organic N fertiliser materials intentionally applied to soils. Refer to the 
activity data section on direct N2O emissions from managed soils (Section 11.2.1.3) and obtain the value for FON. 
Urine and dung from grazing animals (FPRP) 
The term FPRP refers to the amount of N deposited on soil by animals grazing on pasture, range and paddock. Refer 
to the activity data section on direct N2O emissions from managed soils (Section 11.2.1.3) and obtain the value for 
FPRP. 
Crop residue N, including N from N-fixing crops and forage/pasture renewal, returned to soils (FCR) 
The term FCR refers to the amount of N in crop residues (above- and below-ground), including N-fixing crops, 
returned to soils annually. It also includes the N from N-fixing and non-N-fixing forages mineralised during 
forage/pasture renewal. Refer to the activity data section on direct N2O emissions from managed soils (Section 
11.2.1.3) and obtain the value for FCR. 
Mineralised N resulting from loss of soil organic C stocks in mineral soils (FSOM) 
The term FSOM refers to the amount of N mineralised from the loss of soil organic C in mineral soils through land-
use change or management practices. Refer to the activity data section on direct N2O emissions from managed 
soils (Section 11.2.1.3) and obtain the value for FSOM.

Estimation of Default Emission Factor(s) for EF1 
Material and methods 
We extracted all studies from the databases by Stehfest & Bouwman (2006), van Lent et al. (2015), Grace et al. 
(2016), van der Weerden et al. (2016), Albanito et al. (2017), Cayuela et al. (2017), Liu et al. (2017), and Rochette 
et al. (2018) and excluded studies which: 
• 
Were non-peer-reviewed publications. 
• 
Were conducted in the laboratory and greenhouse, and modelling studies (only field studies were selected). 
• 
Were conducted in flooded rice fields (emissions from N inputs in flooded rice are estimated using the EF1FR). 
• 
Related to grazed soils where urine and/or dung were applied (emissions from urine/dung inputs in grazed 
soils are estimated using the EF3PRP). 
• 
Related to enhanced synthetic or organic fertiliser either treated with inhibitors or coated, and 
• 
Were conducted on drained organic soils. 
We further selected the cases from the source databases for which an emission factor had been or could be 
computed using a control site as:

Where N2OTi is the N2O flux during the experimental period due to the application of inputs Ni and other 
unquantified sources of N; and N2OCi is the N2O flux during the experimental period at a control site due to other 
sources of N than Ni.  
Climate (Temperate/Boreal Wet, Temperate/Boreal, Dry Tropical Wet, Tropical Dry) was assigned to most cases. 
Temperate, boreal and tropical zones correspond to those defined in Chapter 3 of Vol. 4 in the 2006 IPCC 
Guidelines. Wet climates occur in temperate and boreal zones where the ratio of annual precipitation: potential 
evapotranspiration > 1, and tropical zones where annual precipitation > 1000 mm. Dry climates occur in temperate 
and boreal zones where the ratio of annual precipitation: potential evapotranspiration < 1, and tropical zones where 
annual precipitation < 1000 mm. Climates were also grouped at a lower level of disaggregation by distinguishing 
dry climates from wet climates. Fertiliser was categorised as synthetic, organic or a mix of synthetic and organic 
forms. At a less disaggregated level, fertiliser comprised two groups: organic and synthetic plus mixed forms of 
fertilser. 
The linear mixed-effect model approach was selected for developing the disaggregated emission factors to account 
for lack of independence among data from individual sites compared to data from different sites. A location 
identification was assigned to all individual cases from experimental sites. Cases either with an identical coordinate 
or being from a same reference with a same soil type and a same land use were considered a unique location. The 
models included location identification as a random-effect, and climate, fertiliser or their interaction as fixed-
effects. Influence of the length of the experiment, of the N application rate as well as influence of irrigation in dry 
climates was evaluated by considering these 3 variables as fixed-effects. The length of the experiment (days) was 
categorized into 5 classes as: ≤ 120, (120; 180], (180; 240], (240; 300], and > 300. The N application rate (kg N 
ha-1 period-1) was categorized following the 6 classes: (0; 100], (100; 200], (200; 300], (300; 500], (500; 700], and 
> 700. Irrigation was categorized as “Yes” or “No”.  
Means for the fixed-effects were compared using the LSD Fisher test to evaluate significant differences among 
the disaggregated EF1 values, and only retain disaggregated values if significant. The confidence intervals for the 
predicted values from the linear mixed effect model was used to quantify uncertainty in the disaggregated EF1. 
The EF1 was disaggregated by climate and fertiliser with no distinction between fertiliser form in dry climates 
(EF1 Dry), but with a distinction between fertiliser form in wet climates (EF1 Wet O and EF1 Wet S + M) (see 
Results section and Table 11.1). Due to the imbalanced dataset between climates and fertiliser forms (76% in wet 
climate, 80% with synthetic plus mixed fertiliser form), the aggregated EF1 could not be estimated using a linear 
mixed-effect model. Instead, a balanced distribution was derived with a bootstrapping method in which 1000 
values were randomly selected from the distribution of each of the disaggregated EF1 values (EF1 Dry, EF1 Wet 
O, EF1 Wet S + M). The estimate for the aggregated EF1 is the average from the resulting distribution and the 
confidence interval was derived based on the 2.5th to 97.5th percentile of the dataset (n = 3000).

The dataset was dominated by cases from Europe (34 percent) and North America (28 percent). Cases from Asia 
represented 19 percent of all cases while Africa, Central-South America, and Oceania formed an equal share of 
6−7 percent of the dataset.  
The linear mixed-effect model analysis indicated no clear trend of decrease or increase of the EF1 according to the 
length of the experimental period or the N application rate (Table 2A.1). Therefore, these criteria were not 
considered further in the analysis.

The analysis yielded no significant difference in EF1 between the four climates as disaggregated by temperature 
and rainfall (Table 2A.2). Disaggregation by rainfall pointed towards an EF1 significantly higher in wet climate 
than in dry climate. In dry climate, irrigation led to a higher EF1 than when irrigation was not practiced. Irrigation 
was practiced in most (63 percent) cases from dry climates, explaining the similarity between the EF1 for dry 
climates and the EF1 for irrigated fields in dry climates. Lower EF1 for non-irrigated fields in dry climates may be 
used at Tier 2 level by compilers that have the corresponding activity data. 
Comparison between the three fertiliser forms (S: Synthetic, O: Organic, M: Mixed S+O) suggested that synthetic 
and mixes of synthetic and organic forms could be grouped into a single category, while the EF1 for organic 
fertiliser forms was significantly lower than the EF1 for synthetic fertilisers. The EF1 obtained from the interaction 
of climate disaggregated by rainfall and fertiliser with two levels of disaggregation (O and S + M) were similar in 
dry climates. In wet climates, the EF1 of the S + M form was significantly higher than the EF1 for the organic form.  
Based on these results, the EF1 was disaggregated by climate and fertiliser with no distinction between fertiliser 
form in dry climates (EF1 Dry = 0.5 percent), but with a distinction between organic fertiliser (EF1 Wet O = 0.6 percent) 
and synthetic plus mixed fertiliser (EF1 Wet S + M = 1.6 percent) in wet climates. The aggregated EF1 computed from 
these disaggregated values amounted to 1.0 percent with an uncertainty range of 0.2 – 1.8 percent.

EF1FR 
We extracted all studies with paddy rice field experiments that had a zero-N control from the databases by Akiyama 
et al. (2005), Albanito et al. (2017) and Cayuela et al. (2017). We excluded studies which: 
• 
Were non-peer-reviewed publications; 
• 
Were conducted in the laboratory and greenhouses, and modelling studies (only field studies were selected); 
• 
Were conducted in upland rice fields; 
• 
Were less than 70 days in duration; 
• 
Related to grazed soils where urine and/or dung was applied; and 
• 
Related to manure or fertilizer treated with inhibitors. 
The database contained 70 EF1FR values and the arithmetic mean was 0.4 percent. Water management strongly 
affects N2O emission from paddy rice fields (Akiyama et al. 2005). Therefore, aggregated and disaggregated 
values by water management were calculated based on arithmetic means and confidence intervals were constructed 
to include 95 percent of the distribution of measured emissions. Arithmetic mean of ‘continuous flooding’ (0.3 
percent, n = 44) was lower than ‘with single and multiple drainage’ (0.5 percent, n = 26). Only ‘continuous flooding 
and ‘with single and multiple drainage’ were considered for disaggregation of water management, because the 
number of available data were not adequate to evaluate other drivers. For example, other factors such as climate 
were not considered due to limited number of data.

Estimation of Default Emission Factor(s) for 
EF3PRP 
We combined the dataset recently collated by Cai & Akiyama (2016) with 27 additional studies to derive EF3PRP 
factors (Yamulki et al. 1998; Galbally et al. 2005; Liebig et al. 2008; Cardenas et al. 2016; Di et al. 2016; 
Hoogendoorn et al. 2016; Hyde et al. 2016; Krol et al. 2016; Li et al. 2016; Luo et al. 2016; Marsden et al. 2016; 
Misselbrook et al. 2016; Nichols et al. 2016; O’Connor et al. 2016; Owens et al. 2016; Pelster et al. 2016; Ward 
et al. 2016; Balvert et al. 2017; Byrnes et al. 2017; Forrestal et al. 2017; Marsden et al. 2017; Owens et al. 2017; 
Thomas et al. 2017a, b; Tully et al. 2017; van der Weerden et al. 2017; Cardoso et al. 2018; Chadwick et al. 2018; 
Nichols et al. 2018). We excluded studies which: 
• 
Were non-peer-reviewed publications; 
• 
Were conducted in the laboratory and greenhouses, and modelling studies (only field studies were selected); 
• 
Were conducted in flooded rice fields; 
• 
Included fertiliser (manure or synthetic) additions; 
• 
Were less than 30 days in duration; and 
• 
Related to excreta treated with inhibitors. 
The updated dataset contained 461 EF3PRP values, with urine dominating the data, representing 326 (= 71 percent) 
of the values. Data were collated from studies where excreta was deposited onto either pasture or forage crops 
such as brassicas or fodder beets. Nitrogen sources were dung, real urine and artificial urine. Artificial urine 
represented a substantial number of data values (72). 
Research has shown that increasing soil water content generally results in greater N2O production and emission 
from urine patches (de Klein et al. 2003, van der Weerden et al. 2014). Therefore, EF3PRP data have been 
disaggregated by climate (dry and wet) for compilers with suitable activity data to allow disaggregation of 
livestock classes by climate. The division between wet and dry in the tropics is based on 1000 mm of precipitation 
(greater than 1000 mm equating with wet/moist climate), and the division in the temperate region is based on mean 
annual precipitation:potential evapotranspiration ratio of 1 (greater than 1 equating with a wet/moist climate). 
There are currently insufficient observations in the dataset to allow further climate disaggregation. Aggregated 
values are also provided for compilers that are not able to disaggregate PRP N inputs by climate.    
Disaggregated excreta EF3PRP values for cattle in wet and dry climates and sheep in wet and dry climates were 
calculated from the urine and dung EF3PRP values reported in Table 4A.1, assuming a urine:dung nitrogen ratio of 
0.66:0.34 (Kelliher et al. 2014). Disaggregated and aggregated excreta EF3PRP values are shown in Table 11.1. 
There was no difference in excreta EF3PRP for sheep when disaggregated into wet and dry climates, therefore only 
an aggregated value is provided. 
The 95 percent confidence intervals were calculated using the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile of the data. Where urine 
and dung values have been aggregated to determine ‘excreta’ values, the 95 percent confidence intervals for urine 
and dung values have been converted to a proportion of the mean (see Fig. 3.3b in Volume 1, Chapter 3 
‘Uncertainties’) and weighted according to the urine:dung nitrogen ratio. These weighted proportions were then 
used to estimate the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile of the excreta values.  
To determine whether there were significant differences in excreta EF3 values between different categories (e.g. 
cattle vs. sheep), the data were analysed using a linear model. Excreta type (dung vs. urine vs. artificial urine), 
livestock type (cattle vs. sheep), land use (pastoral vs. forage crop) and climate (wet vs. dry) were added as fixed 
effects. There were very few data obtained from the same site, therefore site was not included in the model as a 
random effect. Due to its non-normal distribution, however, data was log transformed using a log (x + a) approach, 
(where a = 0.25 percent). An a term was added due to the presence of several negative values. 
Results showed a significant difference between real urine and artificial urine EF3PRP values (P = 0.05). However, 
the analysis of data from two of the studies that included both real urine and artificial urine at similar N loads (de 
Klein et al. 2003; Chadwick et al. 2018) showed urine type (real vs artificial) had no significant effect on EF3PRP 
(P = 0.88, n = 16). On this basis, all artificial urine data were included, adding considerably more observations to 
the dataset (i.e., 63 additional observations). 
Excreta type and animal type were highly significant (both P < 0.001), while there was a significant interaction 
between climate and animal type (P = 0.04). EF3PRP values for cattle and sheep dung and urine, in wet and dry 
climates are shown in Table 4A.1.

Compilers may improve their inventories with a Tier 2 method if activity data can be partitioned into dung and 
urine to produce a country-specific urine:dung ratio. This methodology will require data on N content of different 
forages and feeds and the amount of feed consumed by livestock (MPI, 2014).

B There were only two data for sheep urine in dry climates, with a mean value of 0.0027. Because this mean value was 
similar to the cattle urine in dry climates mean of 0.0032, data from both livestock types were pooled to allow a more 
robust mean and confidence interval for sheep urine under dry conditions.    
C The dataset contained a single data value for sheep dung in dry climates (0.0105); this single value was greater than all 
the data for cattle dung in dry climates. To derive an approximation for a mean value and confidence interval for sheep 
dung in dry climates, this single sheep dung value was combined with cattle dung data from dry climates.

Annex 11A.5 
Estimation of Default Emission Factor(s) for EF4 
In order to develop EF4 values, review papers on indirect N2O emission from N deposition were collected from 
the published literature. We found two types of review papers, as described below. 
1.  Review papers on N addition experiments conducted in non-agricultural sites 
In these experiments chemical N was applied to non-agricultural and non-wetland soil to simulate N deposition. 
Soil N2O emissions were measured in a zero-N control site and in a N treated site. One key advantage of this type 
of study is that N2O emissions from the zero-N control (N2O from N mineralisation, plant litter and N deposition) 
could be removed by subtracting the associated emissions from the treatment plots. The EF was computed as: 
EF (percent) = (N2O N treatment – N2O control) / N input * 100 
However, the disadvantage is that N application rates are often higher than actual N deposition rates. Regardless, 
the estimated EF values from these studies were the same order of magnitude to the EF1 values estimated for this 
report (Table 5A.1), at least given that most of experiments relevant for estimating new EF4 factors were conducted 
in temperate wet climate zones.

2. Review papers on N2O emission and N deposition conducted in non-agricultural sites 
In these experiments N2O emission and N deposition were measured concurrently in non-agricultural and non-
wetland sites, and the EF was calculated as follows: 
EF (%) = N2O / N deposition * 100 
The advantage of this type of study is that actual N deposition rates were measured at these sites. However, the 
disadvantage is that EF does not exclude N2O from a zero-N control (N2O from N mineralisation), and therefore 
the influence of N deposition could not be isolated from other sources of N2O emissions. In general, the EF values 
of these studies were higher than those from N addition experiments in non-agricultural sites (Table 5A.2), 
probably because the resulting EFs did not exclude N2O from N mineralisation and plant litter as well as other 
sources of N inputs.  This could cause double counting because the other sources of N are already addressed in 
other calculations for direct and indirect N2O emissions.

Therefore, considering that N addition experiments conducted in non-agricultural sites reported similar EF values 
as EF1 results from our analysis, we decided to use the same emission factors as EF1 for EF4. Disaggregation is 
only considered for climate type due to the absence of dependence of EF4 upon the form (organic or synthetic) of 
original N input that volatilised. The EF4 was disaggregated by wet and dry climates, as indicated in Table 2A.2 
of Annex11A.2.

Estimation of Default Emission Factor(s) for EF5 
We collected peer-reviewed papers on EF5 for in situ field studies (Tian et al. 2019). The final dataset contained 
254 data observations (EF5g: n = 101, EF5r: n = 91, EF5e: n = 23). 
The EF5g, EF5r and EF5e are defined as: 
EF5g: groundwater (soil solution and lysimeter leaching water were not included), spring, surface drainage, and 
upstream emissions (upstream supersaturated with N2O, N2O emitted mainly from degassing of groundwater). 
EF5r: rivers, reservoirs (including lake and pond), and downstream emissions (supersaturated N2O was already 
degassed and N2O mainly produced by nitrification/denitrification in situ). 
EF5e: estuary emissions (only including inner estuaries or lower reaches of river that are close to the river mouth, 
while outer estuaries and coastal seawater are excluded). 
We found a lack of consistency in dividing EF5g and EF5r for streams based on the literature, at least in some 
studies. Here, we categorized data into EF5g based on upstream supersaturated with N2O where N2O is emitted 
mainly from degassing of groundwater, and EF5r based on downstream, supersaturated N2O that was already 
degassed and N2O mainly produced by nitrification/denitrification in situ. 
Note that the N sources in most rivers include both agricultural (mainly arable farming and grazing grassland) and 
urban sewage. However, we found it was difficult to separate the different N sources based on the limited 
information in the publications.  Therefore, our dataset on EF5r includes non-agricultural N source. 
Most estuaries are impacted by urban waste water and aquaculture in addition to agriculture. However, all available 
data were included because of their limited number. 
Arithmetic mean emission factors were calculated as follows; EF5g: 0.0060 kg N2O–N/kg NO3-N in the water, 
EF5r: 0.0026 kg N2O–N/kg NO3-N in the water and EF5e: 0.0026 kg N2O–N/kg NO3-N in the water.  
EF5 was calculated as follows: 
EF5 = EF5g + EF5r + EF5e 
Uncertainty range is based on the 2.5th to 97.5th percentile.

Estimation of Default Factor(s) for FracGASF 
The Tier 1 aggregated default NH3 + NOx EF for emissions from synthetic fertiliser has been derived as the 
arithmetic mean of default EF values for the different types of individual N fertilisers. Individual fertiliser types 
were weighted according to their use in the period 2007-2015 as reported by the International Fertilizer Industry 
Association (IFA) (Table 7A.1), based on world fertiliser usage. For countries that require inventories for air 
pollutant emissions, there is a continuous update of NH3 and NO EF values through the EMEP/EEA air pollutant 
emission inventory guidebook (European Environment Agency, 2016).

For disaggregation, we divided all fertiliser usage into 4 types of fertiliser categories based on their basic chemical 
composition: urea, ammonium-based (ammonia-direct application, AS, and AP), nitrate-based (N K compound-
N) and ammonium-nitrate-based (AN, CAN, Nitrogen solutions, Other N straight, Other NP-N and N P K 
compound-N).  For weighting purposes, assumptions on chemical compositions had to be considered for different 
fertiliser types reported by IFA for compound fertilisers and for those fertilisers that had not been tested in our 
experimental datasets. We assumed that emissions from these fertiliser types were those obtained from the mean 
value of a mix of different straight fertilisers for different IFA fertiliser products, in the absence of clear statistics 
on their composition and based on qualitative assessments (Table 7A.2).

For NH3, we used the datasets of peer-reviewed studies from the Bouwman et al. (2002) meta-analysis and the 
recently published dataset collated by Pan et al. (2016). A total number of 273 studies were used, and included 
most of the common fertiliser types. Although data were primarily obtained from studies comparing NH3 emissions 
Chapter 11: N2O Emissions from Managed Soils, and CO2 Emissions from Lime and Urea Application 
11.38 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
from different fertiliser types, we also included emissions data from other studies that were conducted for other 
purposes (e.g., assessing effect of urease inhibitors, application rate, and amendments) by using the EF values 
from the control treatments.  
For NOx, we used the dataset of peer-reviewed studies collated by Liu et al. (2017). For the Tier 1 EF, we used 
the data from 54 studies (171 field measurements) comprising information on NO emissions by aggregating data 
from all types of fertiliser. Furthermore, to develop the disaggregated NOx EFs, we estimated values that were 
specific to different fertiliser types.  
Median EF values for each fertiliser type for both NH3 and NOx are shown in Table 7A.3. Median instead of mean 
values were used due to skewed right distribution of the data.

EF values for NH3 emissions were compared with those obtained using the method to predict NH3 emissions in 
the current EMEP/EEA guidelines (EMEP/EEA, 2016). The EF for NH3-N from urea (14.2 percent) is lower than 
the range of 15.5-21 percent from current EMEP/EEA guidelines values, which depend on soil pH and temperature 
conditions, but similar to Bouwman et al. (2002) and Pan et al. (2016) values. Discrepancies are likely to arise 
based on the assumptions taken and analytical choices (e.g. use of mean vs. median). Moreover, it must be noted 
that future revisions to the EMEP/EEA guidebook are expected to use most of the same data utilized in this report 
and therefore, EFs may be updated in the EMEP/EEA guidebook (2016).

Estimation of Default Factor for FracGASM 
Review papers on NH3 and NO were collected to derive the fraction of N that is volatilised. Field measurement 
data with manure or slurry application and excreta patches were extracted from the published literature (see below). 
Field measurement data with chemical N application as well as studies with a focus on mitigation technologies, 
such as nitrification inhibitors or urease inhibitors were excluded from this analysis.   
For NH3, the arithmetic mean was calculated from Bouwman et al. (2002) and Cai & Akiyama (2016). For NO, 
the mean and uncertainty range were calculated from Cai & Akiyama (2016) and Liu et al. (2017). The difference 
between mean EF for cattle and sheep excreta was negligible, thus livestock type was not considered. The default 
FracGASM was derived as the sum of the arithmetic mean of NH3 EF and NOx EF. The uncertainty range was based 
on 2.5th and 97.5th percentile.

mitigation technologies such as nitrification inhibitor. The final dataset contained 355 data observations from 
which the arithmetic mean and uncertainty range for a 95 percent confidence interval were calculated.
