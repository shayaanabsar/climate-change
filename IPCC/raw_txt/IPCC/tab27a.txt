CO2 Emissions from Biomass
(1)  Please do not provide an estimate of both CO2 emissions and CO2 removals.  You should estimate “net” emissions of CO2 and place a single number in either the CO2 emissions or CO2 removals column, as appropriate.
Please note that for the purposes of reporting, the signs for uptake are always (-) and for emissions (+).
