Method for Estimating the Change in Mineral Soil 
Organic Carbon Stocks from Biochar Amendments: Basis for Future 
Methodological Development 
This appendix provides a basis for future methodological development of a Tier 1 method for estimating the change 
in mineral soil organic C stocks from biochar amendments to soils, rather than complete guidance. 
For the purpose of this methodology, biochar is defined as a solid material generated by heating biomass to a 
temperature in excess of 350°C under conditions of controlled and limited oxidant concentrations to prevent 
combustion. These processes can be classified as either pyrolysis (in which oxidants are excluded), or gasification (in 
which oxidant concentrations are low enough to generate syngas). The change in soil organic C stocks from biochar 
amendments is estimated separately from other organic amendments over a 100-year time frame. This method does 
not deal with pyrolytic organic materials that result from wild fires or open fires, and is only applicable for biochar 
added to mineral soils in grasslands and croplands. Biochar is more persistent with only a small portion mineralised 
each year at a decreasing rate over many centuries, and therefore the stock change method cannot be used to track 
changes in biochar C stocks over time as is done for other management practices in mineral soils.  
The methodology used to estimate biochar C additions to minerals soils is based on a top-down approach in which the 
total amount of biochar generated and added to mineral soil in cropland and grassland1 is required to estimate the 
contribution of biochar to annual changes in mineral soil C stocks. Information is not needed on the application rate. 
Interactions between biochar C fate and soil type or land management are not considered with this method.  However, 
the method does require compilers to track the source of feedstock and temperature of the pyrolysis.  The total change 
in carbon stocks of mineral soils receiving biochar amendments is estimated with Equation 4Ap.1.

1 This method is not applicable for application of biochar to soils in forest land, settlements, other lands or wetlands. The studies 
used in the derivation of Fperm values included only cropland and grassland mineral soils.  Thus, the Fperm values provided in 
Table 4Ap.2 are only applicable to mineral soils under those land uses.

Global estimates of the organic C content of biochar (𝐹𝐹𝐶𝐶𝑝𝑝) as a function of feedstock and heating temperature are 
provided in Table 4Ap.1, as well as estimates of the proportion of biochar C that would persist for 100 years (𝐹𝐹𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝) 
years in Table 4Ap.22.  
The biochar-C addition is estimated for cropland and grassland, or in total without disaggregation to the amounts 
applied in cropland and grassland. If biochar-C is entered without disaggregation, then the C stock change should be 
associated with the land use receiving the majority of the biochar.

FCp was calculated from the organic carbon content of biochar from regressions by Neves et al. (2011), corrected for ash content using 
biochar yield from Woolf et al. (2014).  Data on ash, lignin, and carbon content of biomass feedstocks, which are parameters in these 
regression equations, were taken from ECN (2018).3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2 Estimating biochar C remaining for durations of <100 years, such as 20 years, would require additional detailed information on 
the chemical nature of the biochar, how it is applied, as well as climatic and edaphic properties of the location it was applied.

Background Information on Derivation of 𝐅𝐅𝐂𝐂𝐩𝐩 and 𝐅𝐅𝐩𝐩𝐩𝐩𝐩𝐩𝐩𝐩𝐩𝐩 Values 
𝐹𝐹𝐶𝐶𝑝𝑝 was calculated using the organic carbon content of biochar on a dry ash-free (daf) basis according to equation 14 
from Neves et al. (2011), which was based on a regression (n=128) of data from 26 papers. This daf organic carbon 
content was corrected for ash content of the biochar to provide  𝐹𝐹𝐶𝐶𝑝𝑝 as the carbon content per unit mass of biochar 
using the regression equation (n=146 from 18 articles) of biochar yield from Woolf et al. (2014).  Data on ash (n=1276), 
lignin (n=516), and carbon (n=1276) content of biomass feedstocks, which are parameters in these regression 
equations, were taken from ECN (2018). 
The values for Fpermp were calculated from field and laboratory studies for biochars that were made under different 
conversion conditions based on a comprehensive survey of the literature.  The amount of biochar C remaining after 
100 years was estimated by fitting a two-pool double-exponential model to only those datasets within the list of 
references that exceeded one year and allowed a two-pool model to be fitted following the rationale outlined by 
Lehmann et al. (2015). The data included all available studies that met these stringent quality criteria (Major et al. 
2010; Zimmerman 2010; Singh et al. 2012; Zimmerman & Gao 2013; Fang et al. 2014; Herath et al. 2015; Kuzyakov 
et al. 2014; Dharmakeerthi et al. 2015; Wu et al. 2016). Fpermp values were adjusted to an ambient temperature of 20°C, 
which is higher than current estimates of approximately 10°C average land surface temperature (Rohde et al. 2013) 
and therefore conservative since decomposition increases with increasing temperature. Fpermp values were then 
calculated for the three categories shown in Table 4Ap.2 as means for each of the three temperature categories (Figure 
4Ap.1).  Categories were preferred to using a linear regression due to the non-linear relationship between pyrolysis 
temperature and biochar C persistence (Whitman et al. 2013; Bird et al. 2015). Long-term field data of naturally 
accumulated char and anthropogenically added biochar with unknown production temperatures were assessed 
separately as a cross-check on the results (Figure 4Ap.1) and include all available studies with periods exceeding 10 
years of observation (Cheng et al. 2008; Hammes et al. 2008; Lehmann et al. 2008; Liang et al. 2008; Nguyen et al. 
2008; Vasilyeva et al. 2011; Lutfalla et al. 2017). These data do not utilize isotopes or determine physical losses by 
leaching and erosion, and therefore do not allow actual mineralization rates to be quantified. Rather, the biochar and 
char C remaining can be understood as a minimum value below which persistence will not fall over decadal to 
millennial time scales. 
Pyrolysis temperature is used for this methodology, as it is more easily available than biochar property measurements 
for country-wide estimation. Methods could employ biochar property measurements, e.g., H/Corg (Lehmann et al. 
2015) or O/Corg (Spokas 2010) ratios, together with country-specific soil properties, temperatures and moisture 
regimes, but these properties are not considered in this method.

Figure 4Ap.1 Fpermp calculated from field and laboratory studies for biochars that were made under different 
conversion conditions: (a) Fpermp estimated for biochars with known production temperatures by fitting a two-pool 
double-exponential model to 59 datasets from eight mineralization experiments that exceeded one year and allowed a 
two-pool model to be fitted and adjusted to a decomposition temperature of 20°C recalculated as shown in Lehmann 
et al. (2015) (Sources of data include: Major et al. 2010; Zimmerman 2010; Singh et al. 2012; Zimmerman & Gao

observations from eight long-term field assessments (decadal to millennial time scales) where physical export is not 
determined (Cheng et al. 2008; Hammes et al. 2008; Lehmann et al. 2008; Liang et al. 2008; Nguyen et al. 2008;
