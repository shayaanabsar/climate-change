Appendix 2 
Possible Approach for Estimating CO2 Emissions 
from Lands Converted to Permanently Flooded 
Land: Basis for Future Methodological Development 
The time elapsed since flooding has a significant influence on greenhouse gas fluxes from flooded lands and also 
on the partition of the gases. Recent statistical analyses on reservoirs worldwide indicate that there is a rapid 
surge of emissions immediately after flooding, after which emissions return to a relative stable level (Tremblay 
et al., 2005; Therrien et al., 2005; Soumis et al., 2005; and Huttunen et al., 2002, 2003). The rate of the post-
flooding decrease in emissions may depend on the region in which the reservoir is located, but seems to vary in 
about a 10-year period (Delmas et al., 2005; Abril et al., 2005; Tremblay et al., 2005).    
Evidence suggests that CO2 emissions for approximately the first ten years after flooding are the results of decay 
of some of the organic matter on the land prior to flooding. The easily degradable carbon and nutrients are made 
available to producer organisms upon flooding and metabolized. Beyond this time period, CO2 emissions are 
sustained by the input of organic material transferred into the flooded area from the watershed (Houel, 2003; 
Hélie, 2004; Cole and Caraco, 2001). To avoid double-counting of CO2 emissions, which may already been 
captured in the greenhouse gas budget of managed lands in the watershed and in the absence of conclusive 
evidence on the longer term impact of flooding on these emissions, the default methodology only considers the 
first 10 years post flooding.  
Any emissions caused by land-use change activity itself (e.g., CO2 or non-CO2 emissions due land clearance 
before flooding of the land) should be estimated using the methodologies provided elsewhere in this Volume. 
Prior to flooding land may be cleared. Organic material may be burnt or may be harvested (e.g., for timber). The 
resultant emissions should be estimated using the appropriate methodologies in this Volume for estimating the 
change in the carbon stock before flooding. These emissions should be estimated in the year they occur.   
Subsequent to flooding and any land clearing, carbon dioxide emissions from Land Converted to Flooded Land 
can occur via the following pathways:  
• 
Diffusive Emissions, due to molecular diffusion across the air-water interface; this is the major pathway for 
CO2 emissions; 
• 
Bubble Emissions, or gas emissions from the sediment through the water column via bubbles; this is a very 
minor pathway for CO2 emissions;  
• 
Degassing Emissions, or emissions resulting from a sudden change in hydrostatic pressure, as well as the 
increased air/water exchange surface after reservoir waters flow through a turbine and/or  a spillway  
(Duchemin, 2000; Hélie, 2004; Soumis et al., 2004; and Delmas et al., 2005)  
 
This Appendix presents a hierarchy of 3 methods of increasing sophistication called Levels 1, 2 and 3. 
Levels 1 and 2 estimate diffusive emissions only. A level 3 method, based on detailed measurements, includes 
all relevant fluxes of carbon dioxide emissions from flooded lands. Level 3 includes degassing emissions and 
considers the age, and the geographical location and the water temperature of the reservoir. The Level 3 method 
is not outlined further in this Appendix, but countries should refer to the Box 2a.1 on derivation of country-
specific emission factors as a resource for implementing Level 3. When using Level 3, all relevant emissions 
from flooded lands should be estimated for the life-time of the reservoir. Table 2a.1 summarizes the coverage of 
the three levels with respect to CO2 emission pathways.

BOX 2A.1 
DERIVATION OF COUNTRY-SPECIFIC EMISSION FACTORS 
Programs to derive country-specific emission factors should carefully consider the potential 
overlap with other sectors and the proper attribution of emissions. For example, N2O emissions 
ultimately due to fertilizer application or sewage treatment in the watershed should not be reported 
in the Flooded Land category.  
In general, the derivation of country-specific emission factors requires actual measurements of 
greenhouse gas fluxes from reservoir surfaces. Separate emission factors should be developed for 
the predominant types of reservoirs in the national territory. To minimize the required effort, 
reservoirs should first be grouped into categories that take into account the main factors 
responsible for variability among reservoirs, especially climate zone and geological basement 
(which strongly affects pH). Maps and national ecological stratification can be useful to carry out 
this task. 
Within each reservoir category, a measurement strategy should be designed to obtain 
representative flux values by reservoir age, morphology, management regime, nutrient status and 
other relevant factors if necessary.  Finally, within any single reservoir, a rigorously designed flux 
sampling scheme should be applied to take into account the spatial variability caused by variations 
in depth and water current, proximity to the shore, and presence of aquatic vegetation; and the 
temporal variability caused by diurnal and seasonal cycles. Flux measurements should be taken 
over an entire year, preferably over several years. 
Useful information can be obtained from the following references: Therrien et al., 2005; Duchemin 
et al., 2006; Delmas et al., 2005; Abril et al., 2005; Rosa et al., 2004; Soumis et al., 2004; Tavares 
de lima, 2002; Huttunen et al., 2002; Duchemin, 2000; Duchemin et al., 1999; Rosa et al., 1996; 
and Duchemin et al., 1995. 
The development of emission factors should take into account predominant emission types: 
diffusive, bubbles, and degassing.  Measurements of CH4 and CO2 aqueous concentrations at 
various points upstream and downstream of the reservoir are needed to estimate degassing 
emissions.

CHOICE OF METHOD 
The flow chart in Figure 2a.1 guides inventory compilers through the processes of selecting the appropriate level.  
Level selection and the level of spatial and temporal disaggregation implemented by inventory agencies will 
depend upon the availability of activity and emissions factor data, as well as the importance of reservoirs as 
contributors to national greenhouse gas emissions.    
Level 1 
Level 1 provides a simplified approach to estimating CO2 emissions from reservoirs using default emission 
factors and highly aggregated area data. The only CO2 emission pathway included under Level 1 is diffusion 
during the ice-free period. CO2 diffusive emissions related to ice-cover period are assumed to be zero. The 
default assumption is that CO2 emissions are limited to the first 10 years after the flooding took place, and any 
subsequent emissions of CO2 come from carbon entering the reservoir from other land areas (e.g., upstream 
agriculture). Equation 2.16 of Chapter 2 can be used to estimate the carbon stock change in above-ground living 
biomass due to land conversion to Flooded Land if above-ground biomass is cleared before flooding.  If the 
above-ground biomass is burned, one should use Equation 2.14 or 2.27 of Chapter 2 (Emissions from biomass 
Appendix 2: Estimating CO2 emissions from lands converted to permanently flooded lands 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Ap2.3 
burning). In addition, the flux equation, as described below, should be used in all cases to estimate CO2 
emissions from carbon not cleared.   
Decay of above-ground biomass left on site and soil organic matter will both contribute to the emissions. 
Equation 2a.1 shows the Level 1 method for these CO2 emissions.

The CO2 emissions estimated by Equation 2a.1 are highly uncertain because the default emission factor does not 
account for differences in site-specific conditions and time since flooding. The use of Equation 2a.1 may also 
lead to overestimating emissions when used in conjunction with Equations 2.14, 2.16, or 2.27 in Chapter 2. 
Countries using a Level 2 method can more accurately represent the proper time profile of the CO2 emissions 
following flooding. Guidance on Level 2 methods is given below.  
Level 2 
Under Level 2, country-specific emission factors are used to estimate CO2 diffusive emissions. In Level 2, CO2 
emissions can be estimated from reservoirs following the approach shown in Equation 2a.2. As with Level 1, the 
CO2 emissions from Land Converted to Flooded Land should be estimated only for ten years after flooding when 
using Level 2 method unless country-specific research indicates otherwise.   
The estimation of diffusive emissions can also be extended to distinguish between periods in which the 
reservoirs are ice-free and those in which they are ice-covered (Duchemin et al., 2006). This may be a significant 
improvement in accuracy for countries in colder climates.  The flooded land area may be further disaggregated 
by climatic zone, geological basement, or any relevant parameter listed in Box 2a.1.

Level 3 
The Level 3 methods for estimating CO2 emissions are comprehensive and must include additional country-
specific data on all relevant CO2 emission pathways, such as degassing emissions. Emission factors are 
disaggregated to reflect all relevant sources of temporal and spatial variability (see Box 2a.1). To avoid double 
counting, Level 3 also requires partitioning emissions from the degradation of flooded organic matter and from 
the decay of organic matter originating from the watershed. 
CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTORS  
The key default values needed to implement Level 1 method are emission factors for CO2 via the diffusion 
pathways. Table 2a.2 presents measured emissions for various climate zones. These measured emissions 
integrate known spatial (intra-reservoir and regional variations) and temporal variations (dry/rainy and other 
seasonal variations, inter-annual variations) in the emissions from reservoirs, as well as fluxes at the water-air 
interface of reservoirs.  Level 1 applies only to the ice-free period. During complete ice-cover period, CO2 
emissions are assumed to be zero, although in reality emissions do occur. All data have been obtained from 
measurements in hydroelectric or flood control reservoirs.   
For Level 2, country-specific emission factors should, to the extent possible, be used and should include 
emissions during the winter (ice-cover) period. The development of country-specific emission factors is 
discussed in Box 2a.1. The derivation of country-specific factors should be clearly documented, and ideally 
published in peer reviewed literature. Guidance in Box 2a.1 is applicable also for derivation of emission factors 
for Level 3.   
CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA  
Several different types of activity data may be needed to estimate flooded land emissions, depending on the level 
being implemented and the potential sources of spatial and temporal variability within the national territory.   
Flooded land area  
For Level 1, the total reservoir area is required, and the proportion flooded in the last ten years (fA).  The use, in 
a higher level, of more detailed emission profiles over time will require corresponding information on the age 
distribution of flooded lands. Countries can obtain their flooded land area from a drainage basin cover analysis, 
from a national dam database, from the International Commission on Large Dams (ICOLD, 1998) or from the 
World Commission on Dams report (WCD, 2000). Since flooded land area could change rapidly, and because of 
the 10-year time limit, countries should use updated and recent data of reservoir surface area.  Under Level 2, 
this activity data should be disaggregated by relevant categories (see Box 2a.1). For Level 2 and Level 3, 
countries should create a national reservoir database with relevant data or information on reservoir names, types, 
geographical coordinates, year of impoundment, surface area, depth, outflow rate, and other relevant parameters 
as described in Box 2a.1. 
Period of ice-free cover/Period of ice-cover 
Under all levels, the periods during which the reservoirs are ice-free or completely ice-covered are required to 
estimate CO2 emissions. This information can be obtained from national meteorological services. 
Outflow/Spillway volume 
Under Level 3, flooded land outflow and spillway volume are required to estimate degassing emissions of CO2.   
CO2 concentrations upstream and downstream of dams 
Under Level 3, CO2 concentrations upstream and downstream of dams would be needed for estimation of the 
degassing emissions. Information on measurement techniques can be obtained from the references cited in Box 
2a.1.

The values in the second column represent the medians of CO2 emissions reported in the literature, which themselves are arithmetic 
means of flux measured above individual reservoirs. The medians are used because the frequency distributions of underlying flux 
measurements are not normal, and their arithmetic means are already skewed by extreme values. Min and Max values are, respectively, 
the lowest and highest of all individual measurements within a given climate region; these are provided as an indication of variability 
only. Nm = number of measurements; Nres = number of reservoirs sampled. 
These measurements may include non-anthropogenic emissions (e.g., emissions from carbon in the upstream basin) and possible double 
counting of anthropogenic emissions (e.g., waste water from urban areas in the region of the reservoir) and so may overestimate the 
emissions. 
 
UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT 
The two largest sources of uncertainty in the estimation of greenhouse gas emissions from reservoirs are the 
emission factors from the various pathways (diffusive, bubble and degassing) and the estimates of reservoir 
surface areas. 
Emission factors 
The CO2 diffusive emissions shown in Table 2a.2 vary by one to two orders of magnitude in boreal and 
temperate regions, and by one to three in tropical regions. Therefore, the use of any emission factor derived from 
Table 2a.2 will result in high uncertainty. Since the age of reservoirs has a significant influence on CO2 fluxes 
during the first 10 years, the method may result in an underestimation of CO2 emissions. 
Appendix 2: Estimating CO2 emissions from lands converted to permanently flooded lands 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Ap2.7 
CO2 degasssing emissions, which are typically significant in temperate and tropical regions, are an important 
source of uncertainty for Level 3. Research demonstrated that these CO2 emissions accounted for all the 
greenhouse gas emissions from a reservoir in a temperate dry region, and for up to 30% in temperate moist 
region (Soumis et al., 2004). In cold temperate regions, degassing CO2 emissions accounted for less than 5% of 
the total greenhouse gas emissions from reservoirs (Duchemin, 2000; Hélie, 2003).  
To reduce the uncertainties on emissions factors, countries should develop appropriate, statistically valid 
sampling strategies that take into account factors underlying the temporal and spatial variability of the ecosystem 
studied (see Box 2a.1).   
Flooded land surface area 
National statistical information on the flooded area retained behind large dams (> 100km2) should be available 
and will probably be accurate to within 10%. Where national database on dams are not available, and other 
information is used, the flooded land areas retained behind dams will probably have an uncertainty of more than 
50%, especially for countries with large flooded land areas. Detailed information on the location, type and 
function of smaller dams may be also difficult to obtain, though statistical inference may be possible based on 
the size distribution of reservoirs for which data are available. Reservoirs are created for a variety of reasons that 
influence the availability of data, and, consequently, the uncertainty on surface area is dependent on country-
specific conditions.
