Using the Reporting Instructions
If you are engaged in preparing a national inventory you should read the
Reporting Instructions. Even if you have already made an inventory, or have
started to do so, and are simply reporting existing data to IPCC, you should
still read them. These instructions provide the primary means of ensuring
that all reports are consistent, transparent and comparable. The remaining
chapters in this book are as follows:
Chapter 1: Understanding the Common Reporting Framework contains a listing
of the categories you should use when reporting emissions and removals.
Each of the categories is further broken down into sub-categories and given
a definition if necessary. It also contains a listing of the basic fuel categories,
some standard equivalents and unit definitions, and descriptions of the
Sectoral Report Tables and Summary Report Tables used for reporting an
inventory in IPCC format.
Chapter 2: Reporting the National Inventory contains step-by-step instructions
for completing the Sectoral Report Tables and Summary Report Tables that
are used to bring together and make a record of the estimates which have
been made in your own inventory.
Tables: You will use these tables to assemble data from your national
greenhouse gas inventory and present them in the IPCC reporting format.
Finally, having completed the Sectoral Report Tables and the Summary
Report Tables, you can assess the quality and completeness of the inventory
by completing the Overview Table which provides a synoptic view of the
results of the IPCC Greenhouse Gas Inventory.
Annex 1: Managing Uncertainties provides guidance on the theoretical
considerations involved in taking account of uncertainties in creating an
inventory.

Annex 2: IPCC and CORINAIR Source Categories looks at the ways in which
data assembled for the CORINAIR inventory conducted by the European
Union (EU) member countries as well as by the United Nations Economic
Commission for Europe (UNECE) and IPCC data relate to each other.

can be found at the end of this book.

Underlying Principles
The Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines allow for the use of a range of methods at
different levels of detail, including methods which are appropriate to
national conditions. Default methods and assumptions are provided for
calculating the major emissions and removals of greenhouse gases at the
minimum acceptable level of detail. The IPCC default methods have been
developed with efficiency in mind. They build on data that are readily
available and should be easily applicable to all countries of the world. More
detailed methods are also discussed in the Guidelines and national experts
are encouraged to use them wherever this is possible and likely to produce
more accurate national estimates. In some cases, national experts may
choose to use an entirely different methodology if they believe this better
reflects their national situation. Common reporting instructions are
therefore needed to accommodate inventories developed at different levels
of detail and (potentially) with different methods. The objective of the
instructions is to establish minimum requirements for reporting data which
allow for comparison and identification of differences in inventory
construction (transparency). For this reason the IPCC recommends that all
users of the Guidelines follow the Reporting Instructions explicitly when they
communicate their national inventories to the IPCC or other international
bodies.
Several main principles underlie the Revised 1996 IPCC Reporting Instructions:
•
Common Reporting Framework
The core of the reporting system is the establishment and use of a
standard table format using common source/sink categories and
common fuel categories. Common definitions of pollutants, units, and
time intervals are necessary. Ultimately, all countries should be
working toward complete greenhouse gas inventories within each, and
across all, greenhouse gases.
Emission inventory results should be transmitted using the Sectoral
and Summary Report Tables . Use of these reporting conventions will
not only enhance the comparability of data, it will facilitate the speed
with which inventories can be processed, made available in summary
form, aggregated and reviewed internationally.
•
Documentation Standards
Documentation standards are necessary to ensure transparency of
national inventories and hence to allow the inventory to be reviewed.
By providing the necessary documentation, the comparability of
national inventories can also be evaluated. Therefore, along with
Sectoral and Summary Report Tables, countries should provide the
worksheets used to develop the national  inventory, containing at least

all major assumptions activity data and emission factors. The IPCC also
recommends that, countries submit a description of the method used,
any definitions, as well as other relevant assumptions that cannot be
summarised in table form. Enough data should be provided to allow a
third party to reconstruct the inventory from national activity data and
assumptions (the working definition of transparency).
To limit the volume of data to be provided, written documentation
should focus on describing fully any differences in method and
assumptions from the IPCC default methods.
•
Verification and Uncertainty Assessment
To improve the quality of inventory data and to help assess the
uncertainty surrounding estimates, the Revised 1996 IPCC Reporting
Instructions recommend that inventories be verified through the use of
a set of simple checks for completeness and accuracy of submissions.
These checks can be performed centrally, although it is preferable for
the countries to do as much as possible themselves.  Finally, an
uncertainty assessment should also be conducted as far as possible and
summarised for each major part of the inventory. Conceptual guidance
for the assessment of the uncertainty of emission estimates are
provided in Annex 1 Managing Uncertainties. Other approaches to
describing uncertainty associated with point estimates of emissions and
removals are also possible.  Whether you use one of the approaches
provided by the IPCC or another approach, you should include an
uncertainty discussion in your inventory submission.
Each of these three principles is addressed in more detail in the following
chapters.
