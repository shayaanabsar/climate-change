Soil carbon 
This section elaborates on estimation procedures and good practices for estimating change in forest soil C stocks. 
It does not include forest litter, which is a dead organic matter pool. Separate guidance is provided for two types 
of forest soils: 1) mineral forest soils, and 2) organic forest soils.   
The organic C content of mineral forest soils (to 1 m depth) typically varies between 20 to over 300 tonnes C ha-1 
depending on the forest type and climatic conditions (Jobbagy and Jackson 2000). Globally, mineral forest soils 
contain approximately 700 Pg C (Dixon et al. 1994), but soil organic C pools are not static due to differences 
between C inputs and outputs over time. Inputs are largely determined by the forest productivity, the 
decomposition of litter and its incorporation into the mineral soil and subsequent loss through 
mineralization/respiration (Pregitzer 2003). Other losses of soil organic C occur through erosion or the dissolution 
of organic C that is leached to groundwater or loss through overland flow. A large proportion of input is from 
above-ground litter in forest soils, so soil organic matter tends to concentrate in the upper soil horizons, with 
roughly half of the soil organic C in the upper 30 cm layer. In some forest ecosystems, rooting zones of trees 
extend considerable deeper than 30 cm, which can increase the share of soil organic carbon in deeper layers 
(Nepstad et al. 1994). Changes in soil carbon stocks in response to management actions such as thinning and clear-
cutting have been detected below 20–30 cm, but not in all studies or all depths (Achat et al. 2015a; James and 
Harrison 2016; Gross et al. 2018). Moreover, the scarcity of measurements increases uncertainty related to soil 
carbon stock changes deeper in soil. The C held in the upper profile is often the most chemically decomposable, 
and the most directly exposed to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. This section only deals with soil C and 
does not address decomposing litter (i.e., dead organic matter, see Section 4.2.2). 
Human activities and other disturbances such as changes in forest type, productivity, decay rates and disturbances 
can alter the C dynamics of forest soils. Different forest management activities, such as rotation length; choice of 
tree species; drainage; harvest practices (whole tree or sawlog, regeneration, partial cut or thinning); site 
preparation activities (prescribed fires, soil scarification); and fertilization, affect soil organic C stocks (Harmon 
and Marks, 2002; Liski et al. 2001; Johnson and Curtis 2001). Changes in disturbance regimes, notably in the 
occurrence of severe forest fires, pest outbreaks, and other stand-replacing disturbances are also expected to alter 
the forest soil C pool (Li and Apps 2002; de Groot et al. 2002). In addition, drainage of forest stands on organic 
soils reduces soil C stocks. 
General information and guidelines on estimating changes soil C stocks are found in Chapter 2, Section 2.3.3, and 
needs to be read before proceeding with the specific guidelines dealing with forest soil C stocks. Changes in soil 
C stocks associated with forests are computed using Equation 2.24 in Chapter 2, which combines the change in 
soil organic C stocks for mineral soils and organic soils; and stock change for soil inorganic C pools (Tier 3 only).  
This section elaborates on estimation procedures and good practices for estimating change in forest soil C organic 
stocks (Note: It does not include forest litter, i.e., dead organic matter). Separate guidance is provided for two 
types of forest soils: 1) mineral forest soils, and 2) organic forest soils. See Section 2.3.3.1 for general discussion 
on soil inorganic C (no additional information is provided in the Forest Land discussion below). 
To account for changes in soil C stocks associated with Forest Land Remaining Forest Land, countries need to 
have, at a minimum, estimates of the total Forest Land area at the beginning and end of the inventory time period, 
stratified by climate region and soil type. If land-use and management activity data are limited, Approach 1 activity

4.6 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
data (see Chapter 3) can be used as the basis for a Tier 1 approach, but higher Tiers are likely to need more detailed 
records or knowledge of country experts about the approximate distribution of forest management systems. Forest 
Land classes must be stratified according to climate regions and major soil types for Tier 1, which can be 
accomplished with overlays of suitable climate and soil maps. Further stratification may be useful for development 
of Tier 2 or 3 methodology for a country. 
4.2.3.1 CHOICE OF METHOD 
Inventories can be developed using Tier 1, 2 or 3 approaches, and countries may choose to use different tiers for 
mineral and organic soils.  Decision trees are provided for mineral soils (Figure 2.4) and organic soils (Figure 2.5) 
in Chapter 2 to assist inventory compilers with selection of the appropriate tier for their soil C inventory. 
Mineral soils 
In spite of a growing body of literature on the effect of forest types, management practices and other disturbances 
on soil organic C, the available evidence remains largely site- and study-specific, but eventually may be 
generalized based on the influence of climatic conditions, soil properties, the time scale of interest, taking into 
consideration sampling intensity and effects across different soil depth increments (Johnson and Curtis 2001; 
Hoover 2003; Page-Dumroese et al. 2003). However, the current knowledge remains inconclusive on both the 
magnitude and direction of C stock changes in mineral forest soils associated with forest type, management and 
other disturbances, and cannot support broad generalizations.  
Tier 1 
Current scientific basis is not sufficient to develop Tier 1 default emission factors for quantification of effects of 
forest management by IPCC climate zones. Thus, it is assumed in the Tier 1 method that forest soil C stocks do 
not change with management.  Recent studies indicate, that effects of forest management actions on soil C stocks 
can be difficult to quantify and reported effects have been variable and even contradictory (see Box 4.3a). 
Furthermore, if using Approach 2 or 3 activity data (see Chapter 3), it is not necessary to compute C stock changes 
for mineral soils (i.e., change in SOC stocks is 0). If using activity data collected via Approach 1 (see Chapter 3), 
and it is not possible to identify the amount of land converted from and to Forest Land, then the inventory compiler 
should estimate soil C stocks for Forest Land using the areas at the beginning and the end of the inventory period 
in order to estimate the change in soil carbon stock. The changes in soil C stocks for Forest Land are summed with 
the changes in stocks for other land uses to estimate the influence of land-use change.  If the compiler does not 
compute a stock for Forest Land, it is likely to create systematic errors in the inventory.  For example, land 
converted from Forest Land to Cropland or Grassland will have a soil C stock estimated in the final year of the 
inventory, but will have no stock in the first year of the inventory (when it was forest).  Consequently, conversion 
to Cropland or Grassland is estimated as a gain in soil C because the soil C stocks are assumed to be 0 in the Forest 
Land, but not in Cropland and Grassland.  This would introduce a bias into the inventory estimates. SOC0 and 
SOC0-T are estimated for the top 30 cm of the soil profile using Equation 2.25 (Chapter 2). Note that areas of 
exposed bedrock in Forest Land are not included in the soil C stock calculation (assume a stock of 0). Further 
clarification on soil organic carbon estimation is presented in Section 2.3.3.1. 
Tier 2 
Using Equation 2.25 (Chapter 2) soil organic C stocks are computed based on reference soil C stocks and country-
specific stock change factors for forest type (FI), management (FMG) and natural disturbance regime (FND).  Note 
that the stock change factor for natural disturbance regime (FND) is substituted for the land-use factor (FLU) in 
Equation 2.25.  In addition, country-specific information can be incorporated to better specify reference C stocks, 
climate regions, soil types, and/or the land management classification system.   
Tier 3 
Tier 3 approaches will require considerable knowledge and data allowing for the development of an accurate and 
comprehensive domestic estimation methodology, including evaluation of model results and implementation of a 
domestic monitoring scheme and/or modelling tool. The basic elements of a country-specific approach are 
(adapted from Webbnet Land Resource Services Pty ltd, 1999): 
• Stratification by climatic zones, major forest types and management regimes coherent with those used for other 
C pools in the inventory, especially biomass;  
• Determination of dominant soil types in each stratum; 
• Characterization of corresponding soil C pools, identification of determinant processes in SOC input and output 
rates and the conditions under which these processes occur; and 
• Determination and implementation of suitable methods to estimate carbon stock changes from forest soils for 
each stratum on an operational basis, including model evaluation procedures; methodological considerations

are expected to include the combination of monitoring activities – such as repeated forest soil inventories - and 
modelling studies, and the establishment of benchmark sites. Further guidance on good soil monitoring 
practices is available in the scientific literature (Kimble et al. 2003, Lal et al. 2001, McKenzie et al. 2000). It 
is good practice for models developed or adapted for this purpose to be peer-reviewed and validated with 
observations representative of the ecosystems under study and independent from the calibration data.  
More guidance on Tier 3 methods is given in Chapter 2.3.3.1, such as examples of Tier 3 modelling methods in 
Box 2.2d. The examples provide information about types of data required, brief descriptions of models, methods 
that are used to apply the models, and how using a Tier 3 model has changed results. General guidance on 
measurement-based and model-based Tier 3 inventories for the AFOLU sector can be found in Section 2.5.

4.2.3.2 CHOICE OF STOCK CHANGE AND EMISSION FACTORS 
Mineral soils 
Tier 1 
It is not necessary to compute the stock estimates for Forest Land Remaining Forest Land with Approach 2 or 3 
activity data (see Chapter 3).  If using Approach 1 activity data, stock change factors, including input, management 
and disturbance regime, are equal to 1 using the Tier 1 approach.  Consequently, only reference C stocks are 
needed to apply the method, and those are provided in Table 2.3 of Chapter 2. 
Tier 2 
In a Tier 2 approach, stock change factors are derived based on a country-specific classification scheme for 
management, forest types, and natural disturbance regimes.  A Tier 2 approach should include the derivation of 
country-specific reference C stocks, and a more detailed classification of climate and soils than the default 
categories provided with the Tier 1 method. The depth for evaluating soil C stock changes can differ from 30 cm 
with the Tier 2 method.  However, this will require consistency with the depth of the reference C stocks (SOCREF) 
and stock change factors (i.e., FLU, FI, and FMG) to ensure consistent application of methods for determining the 
impact of land use change on soil C stocks. Box 4.3a provides information and references that can be used as a 
starting point for developing Tier 2 factors for forest management as well as observations on related challenges.  
It is good practice to focus on the factors that have the largest overall effect, taking into account the impact on 
forest SOC and the extent of affected forests. Management practices can be coarsely labeled as intensive (e.g., 
plantation forestry) or extensive (e.g., natural forest); these categories can also be redefined according to national 
circumstances. The development of stock change factors is likely to be based on intensive studies at experimental 
sites and sampling plots involving replicated, paired site comparisons (Johnson et al. 2002; Olsson et al. 1996; see 
also the reviews by Johnson and Curtis 2001; and Hoover 2003).  In practice, it may not be possible to separate 
the effects of different forest types, management practices and disturbance regimes, in which case stock change 
factors should be combined into a single modifier. If a country has well-documented data for different forest types 
under different management regimes, it might be possible to derive soil organic C estimates directly without using 
reference C stocks and adjustment factors.  However, a relationship to the reference C stocks must be established 
so that the impact of land-use change can be computed without artificial increases or decreases in the C stocks due 
to a lack of consistency in the methods across the various land-use categories (i.e., Forest Land, Cropland, 
Grassland, Settlements, and Other Land).   
Inventories can also be improved by deriving country-specific reference C stocks (SOCREF), compiled from 
published studies or surveys. Such values are typically obtained through the development and/or compilation of 
large soil profile databases (Siltanen et al. 1997; Scott et al. 2002; Batjes 2011; De Vos et al. 2015).  Additional 
guidance for deriving stock change factors and reference C stocks is provided in Section 2.3.3.1 (Chapter 2).

BOX 4.3A (NEW) 
DEVELOPING TIER 2 STOCK CHANGE FACTORS FOR FOREST LAND 
Although the scientific basis is not sufficient for deriving default stock change factors for forest land, 
country specific Tier 2 factors can be developed if there is adequate data available to represent 
national circumstances. Several meta-analyses and reviews provide analyses and references to 
support incorporation of country-specific data into a Tier 2 method with estimation of management 
effects and corresponding stock change factors (FMG) for Forest Land Remaining Forest Land. 
Quantification of management effects becomes increasingly important in cases in which forests 
represent a significant sink or source or in which changes in management intensity or practices result 
in gains or losses compared to earlier practices. Increased removal of harvest residues or stumps for 
bioenergy is one example of changes in management intensity and practices. Most analyses have 
focused on the effects following harvests of different intensities (e.g., Johnson and Curtis 2001; 
Achat et al. 2015a; James and Harrison 2016; Zhou et al. 2013). Response ratios or effect sizes based 
on measurements of soil carbon stocks reflect all changes associated with a management action; 
thus, separate carbon stock factors for input of organic matter (FI) cannot be derived from the existing 
data. 
Most field experiments have been carried out in cool temperate regions, and meta-analyses or 
reviews on harvest effects can be found to support adaptation of Tier 2 methods for these regions 
Nave et al. 2010; Thiffault et al., 2011; Clarke et al. 2015; Hume et al. 2017). When selecting 
harvesting experiments on which to base the calculation of stock change factors, several factors need 
to be considered: intensity of harvest, treatment of harvest residues and other site preparation 
practices, such as burning, time since the management action, and soil layers and sampling depths 
(Liao et al. 2010; Strömgren et al. 2013; Achat et al. 2015b; James and Harrison 2016; Dean et al. 
2017; Hume et al. 2017). Tree species composition, i.e., conifers versus broad-leaved or mixed 
species, could also influence the management effect although the influence can be confounded by 
other factors (e.g. Hume et al. 2017). The question of control conditions for evaluating the 
management action is of great importance because the control is often not a native reference 
condition, but rather another managed forest (Dean et al. 2017). This should be taken into account 
when estimating a stock change factor based on several field studies as well as the relationship to 
country-specific reference soil C stock. 
Conclusions on the harvesting effects differ between meta-analyses, which could be partly due to 
differences in field experiment set-ups and the different data selection and weighting procedures. As 
an example, whole-tree harvests resulted in average 7.5percent smaller carbon stocks in mineral soil 
than the stocks measured 10–30 years after stem-only harvests (Achat et al. 2015a).  However, no 
effect of whole-tree harvest was found in some other meta-analyses (Clarke et al. 2015; Hume et al. 
2017) or a positive effect was reported (James and Harrison 2016). However, there was a tendency 
for smaller carbon stocks in forest floor after whole-tree harvesting compared to stem-only 
harvesting or pre-treatment conditions (Johnson and Curtis 2001; Thiffault et al. 2011; Clarke et al. 
2015). 
Considerable spatial variability increases the challenge to detect relatively small management effects 
in soil C stocks (Jandl et al. 2007). However, most studies include only the first one or two decades 
after the harvest, which may too short to reveal impact of forest management actions on soil carbon 
stock changes, especially in cool climate regions with long rotation periods (Clarke et al. 2015; Dean 
et al. 2017). Non-linearity in the responses has also been observed.  For example, an increase in soil 
C stocks after an initial decrease has been observed for a group of studies on Spodosols from a cool 
and humid climate with longer monitoring periods, up to eight decades of typical rotation lengths 
(James and Harrison 2016). 
In addition to guidance in this Chapter 4.2.3.2 above, detailed guidance on estimation of country-
specific stock change factors and reference C stocks in general is given in Chapter 2, in Section 
2.3.3.1., including guidance on using models to derive carbon stock change factors. 
Tier 3 
Constant stock change rate factors per se are less likely to be estimated in favor of variable rates that more 
accurately capture land-use and management effects.  See Section 2.3.3.1 (Chapter 2) for further discussion.

Wetlands, Chapter 2, Section 2.2. 
4.2.3.3 CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
Mineral soils 
Tier 1 
For the Tier 1 approach, it is assumed that forest soil C stocks do not change with management, and therefore it is 
not necessary to classify forest into various types, management classes or natural disturbance regimes.  However, 
if using Approach 1 activity data (see Chapter 3), environmental data will be needed to classify the country into 
climate regions and soil types in order to apply the appropriate reference C stocks to Forest Land.  A detailed 
description of the default climate classification scheme is given in Chapter 3, Annex 3A.5.  If the information 
needed to classify climate types is not available from national databases, there are international sources of climate 
data such as United Nations Environmental Program.  Data will also be needed to classify soils into the default 
categories provided in Chapter 3, and if national data are not available to map the soil types, international soils 
data provide a reasonable alternative, such as the FAO Soils Map of the World.   
Tier 2 
Activity data for the Tier 2 approach consist of the major forest types, management practices, disturbance regimes 
and the areas to which they apply. It is preferable for the data to be linked with the national forest inventory, where 
one exists, and/or with national soil and climate databases. Typical changes include conversion of unmanaged to 
managed forest; conversion of forest type (native forest into a new forest type, such as plantation of exotic species 
and vice versa); intensification of forest management activities, such as site preparation, tree planting, interval and 
intensity of thinning and rotation length changes; changes in harvesting practices (bole vs. whole-tree harvesting; 
amount of residues left on-site); and the frequency of disturbances (e.g., pest and disease outbreaks, flooding, fires, 
typhoon/cyclone/hurricane, snow damage). Data sources will vary according to a country’s forest management 
system, but could include individual contractors or companies, statutory forest authorities, research institutions 
and agencies responsible for forest inventories. Data formats vary widely, and include, among others, activity 
reports, forest management inventories and remote sensing imagery. 
In addition, Tier 2 methods should involve a finer stratification of environmental data than the Tier 1 approach, 
including climate regions and soil types, which would likely be based on national climate and soils data.  If a finer 
classification scheme is utilized in a Tier 2 inventory, reference C stocks will also need to be derived for the more 
detailed set of climate regions and soil types, and the land management data will need to be stratified based on the 
country-specific classification. 
Tier 3 
For application of dynamic models and/or a direct measurement-based inventory in Tier 3, similar or more detailed 
data on the combinations of climate, soil, topographic and management data are needed, relative to the Tiers 1 and 
2 methods, but the exact requirements will be dependent on the model or measurement design.

4.2.3.4 CALCULATION STEPS FOR TIER 1 
No refinement. 
4.2.3.5 UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT 
Three broad sources of uncertainty exists in soil C inventories: 1) uncertainties in land-use and management 
activity and environmental data; 2) uncertainties in reference soil C stocks if using Tier 1 or 2 approaches (mineral 
soils only); and 3) uncertainties in the stock change/emission factors for Tier 1 or 2 approaches, model 
structure/parameter error for Tier 3 model-based approaches, or measurement error/sampling variability associated 
with Tier 3 measurement-based inventories.  In general, precision of an inventory is increased (i.e., smaller 
confidence ranges) with more sampling to estimate values for the three broad categories.  In addition, reducing 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
4.10 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
bias (i.e., improve accuracy) is more likely through the development of a higher Tier inventory that incorporates 
country-specific information.   
For Tier 1, uncertainties are provided with the reference C stocks in the first footnote of Table 2.3 (Chapter 2), and 
emission factor uncertainties for organic soils are provided in Table 4.6, Section 4.5. For organic soils, see 
guidance in 2013 Supplement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories: Wetlands, 
Chapter 2, Section 2.2. Uncertainties in land-use and management data will need to be addressed by the inventory 
compiler, and then combined with uncertainties for the default factors and reference C stocks (mineral soils only) 
using an appropriate method, such as simple error propagation equations. Refer to Section 4.2.1.5 for uncertainty 
estimate for land area estimates.  However, it is good practice for the inventory compiler to derive uncertainties 
from country-specific activity data instead of using a default level.  
Default reference C stocks for mineral soils and emission factors for organic soils can have inherently high 
uncertainties, particularly bias, when applied to specific countries. Defaults represent globally averaged values of 
land-use and management impacts or reference C stocks that may vary from region-specific values (Powers et al. 
2004; Ogle et al. 2006). Bias can be reduced by deriving country-specific factors using Tier 2 method or by 
developing a Tier 3 country-specific estimation system. The underlying basis for higher Tier approaches will be 
research in the country or neighbouring regions that address the effect of land use and management on soil C.  In 
addition, it is good practice to further minimize bias by accounting for significant within-country differences in 
land-use and management impacts, such as variation among climate regions and/or soil types, even at the expense 
of reduced precision in the factor estimates (Ogle et al. 2006).  Bias is considered more problematic for reporting 
stock changes because it is not necessarily captured in the uncertainty range (i.e., the true stock change may be 
outside of the reported uncertainty range if there is significant bias in the factors).  
Uncertainties in land-use activity statistics may be improved through a better national system, such as developing 
or extending a ground-based survey with additional sample locations and/or incorporating remote sensing to 
provide additional coverage.  It is good practice to design a classification that captures the majority of land-use 
and management activity with a sufficient sample size to minimize uncertainty at the national scale. 
For Tier 2 methods, country-specific information is incorporated into the inventory analysis for purposes of 
reducing bias. For example, Ogle et al. 2003 utilized country-specific data to construct probability distribution 
functions for US specific factors, activity data and reference C stocks for agricultural soils. It is good practice to 
evaluate dependencies among the factors, reference C stocks or land-use and management activity data.  In 
particular, strong dependencies are common in land-use and management activity data because management 
practices tend to be correlated in time and space.  Combining uncertainties in stock change/emission factors, 
reference C stocks and activity data can be done using methods such as simple error propagation equations or 
Monte-Carlo procedures. 
Tier 3 models are more complex and simple error propagation equations may not be effective at quantifying the 
associated uncertainty in resulting estimates.  Monte Carlo analyses are possible (Smith and Heath 2001), but can 
be difficult to implement if the model has many parameters (some models can have several hundred parameters) 
because joint probability distribution functions must be constructed quantifying the variance as well as covariance 
among the parameters (see e.g. Peltoniemi et al. 2006; Metsaranta et al. 2017). However, if soil model parameters 
have been estimated with a Bayesian approach, the resultant joint probability distribution for the parameters can 
be sampled in a Monte Carlo Analysis to capture parameter uncertainty, along with sampling of probability 
distribution functions for model inputs and other associated data, see Lehtonen and Heikkinen (2016). Other 
methods are also available such as empirically-based approaches (Monte et al. 1996), which use measurements 
from a monitoring network to statistically evaluate the relationship between measured and modelled results 
(Falloon and Smith 2003; Ogle et al. 2007). In contrast to modelling, uncertainties in measurement-based Tier 3 
inventories can be determined from the sample variance, measurement error and other relevant sources of 
uncertainty.

Soil carbon 
Land conversions on mineral soils generally either maintain similar levels of C storage or create conditions that 
increase soil C stocks, particularly if the land was previously managed for annual crop production (Post and Kwon, 
2000). However, under certain circumstances, Grassland conversion to Forest Land has been shown to cause small 
C losses in mineral soils for several decades following conversion (Davis and Condron 2002; Paul et al. 2002).  
Emissions of C from organic soils will vary depending on the previous use and level of drainage.  Specifically, 
conversion from Cropland will tend to decrease emissions; conversions from Grassland will likely maintain similar 
emission rates; while conversion from Wetlands often increases C emissions.    
General information and guidelines on estimating changes soil C stocks are found in Section 2.3.3 in Chapter 2 
(including equations) and need to be read before proceeding with guidelines dealing with forest soil C stocks. The 
total change in soil C stocks for Land Converted to Forest Land is computed using Equation 2.24 (Chapter 2), 
which combines the change in soil organic C stocks for mineral soils and organic soils; and carbon stock changes 
for inorganic soil C pools (Tier 3 only).  This section provides specific guidance for estimating soil organic C stock 
changes; see Section 2.3.3.1 (Chapter 2) for general discussion on soil inorganic C (no additional information is 
provided in the Forest Land discussion below). 
To account for changes in soil C stocks associated with Land Converted to Forest Land, countries need to have, 
at a minimum, estimates of the areas of Land Converted to Forest Land during the inventory time period, stratified 
by climate region and soil type. If land-use and management data are limited, Approach 1 activity data can be used 
as a starting point, along with knowledge of country experts of the approximate distribution of land-use types being 
converted.  If previous lands uses and conversions for Land Converted to Forest Land are unknown, SOC stocks 
changes can still be computed using the methods provided in Forest Land Remaining Forest Land, but the land 
base will likely be different for forests in the current year relative to the initial year in the inventory.  It is critical, 
however, that the total land area across all land-use sectors be equal over the inventory time period (e.g., if 5 
Million ha is converted from Cropland and Grassland to Forest Land during the inventory time period, then Forest 
Land will have an additional 5 Million ha in the last year of the inventory, while Cropland and Grassland will have 
a corresponding loss of 5 Million ha in the last year), and the total change will be estimated when summing SOC 
stocks across all land uses.  Land Converted to Forest Land is stratified according to climate regions and major 
soil types, which could either be based on default or country-specific classifications.  This can be accomplished 
with overlays of climate and soil maps, coupled with spatially-explicit data on the location of land conversions. 
Inventories can be developed using Tier 1, 2 or 3 approaches, with each successive Tier requiring more detail and 
resources than the previous.  It is possible that countries will use different tiers to prepare estimates for the separate 
components in this source category (i.e., soil organic C stocks changes in mineral soils and organic soils; and stock 
changes associated with soil inorganic C pools).   
4.3.3.1 CHOICE OF METHOD 
Inventories can be developed using Tier 1, 2 or 3 approaches and countries may choose different tiers for mineral 
and organic soils.  Decision trees are provided for mineral (Figure 2.4) and organic soils (Figure 2.5) in Section 
2.3.3.1 (Chapter 2) to assist inventory compilers with selection of the appropriate tier for their soil C inventory. 
Mineral soils 
Tier 1 
Change in soil organic C stocks can be estimated for mineral soils with land-use conversion to Forest Land using 
Equation 2.25 (Chapter 2).  For Tier 1, the initial (pre-conversion) soil organic C stock (SOC(0-T)) and C stock in 
the last year of the inventory time period (SOC0) are determined from the common set of reference soil organic C 
stocks (SOCREF) and default stock change factors (FLU, FMG, FI) as appropriate for describing land use and 
management both pre- and post-conversion. Note that area of exposed bedrock in Forest Land or the previous land 
use are not included in the soil C stock calculation (assume a stock of 0).  Annual rates of stock changes are 
calculated as the difference in stocks (over time) divided by the time dependence (D) of the stock change factors 
(default is 20 years).

Tier 2 
The Tier 2 approach for mineral soils also uses Equation 2.25 (Chapter 2), but involves country or region-specific 
reference C stocks and/or stock change factors and possibly more disaggregated land-use activity and 
environmental data.   
Tier 3 
Tier 3 approaches will involve more detailed and country-specific models and/or measurement-based approaches 
along with highly disaggregated land-use and management data. It is good practice that Tier 3 approaches 
estimating soil C change from land-use conversions to Forest Land, employ models, monitoring networks and/or 
data sets that are capable of representing transitions over time from other land uses, including Grassland, Cropland 
and possibly Settlements or other land uses. It is important that models be evaluated with independent observations 
from country or region-specific field locations that are representative of the interactions of climate, soil and forest 
type/management on post-conversion change in soil C stocks.

4.3.3.2 CHOICE OF STOCK CHANGE AND EMISSION FACTORS 
Mineral soils 
Tier 1 
For native unmanaged land, as well as for managed Forest Land, Settlements and nominally managed Grassland 
with low disturbance regimes, soil C stocks are assumed equal to the reference values (i.e., land use, disturbance 
(forests only), management and input factors equal 1), but it will be necessary to apply the appropriate stock change 
factors to represent other systems which may be converted to Forest Land, such as improved and degraded 
Grassland, as well as all Cropland systems.  See the appropriate land-use section for default stock change factors 
(Forest Land in 4.2.3.2, Cropland in Section 5.2.3.2, Grassland in 6.2.3.2, Settlements in 8.2.3.2, and Other Land 
in 9.3.3.2). Default reference C stocks are found in Table 2.3 (Chapter 2). 
Tier 2 
Estimation of country-specific stock change factors is probably the most important development associated with 
the Tier 2 approach.  Differences in soil organic C stocks among land uses are computed relative to a reference 
condition.  If default reference C stocks are used, the reference condition is native vegetation that is neither 
degraded nor improved through land-use and management practices. Stock change factors for land-use conversion 
to native forests will be equal to 1 if the forest represents the reference condition.  However, stock change factors 
will need to be derived for Land Converted to Forest Land that do not represent the reference condition, accounting 
for the influence of disturbance (FD), input (FI) and management (FMG), which are then used to further refine the 
C stocks of the new forest system.  See the appropriate section for specific information regarding the derivation of 
stock change factors for other land-use sectors (Cropland in 5.2.3.2, Grassland in Section 6.2.3.2, Settlements in 
8.2.3.2, and Other Land in 9.3.3.2).   
Reference C stocks can also be derived from country-specific data in a Tier 2 approach.  Reference values in Tier 
1 correspond to non-degraded, unimproved lands under native vegetation, but other reference conditions can also 
be chosen for Tier 2. In general, reference C stocks should be consistent across the land uses (i.e., Forest Land, 
Cropland, Grassland, Wetlands, Settlements, Other Land) (see section 2.3.3.1). Therefore, the same reference stock 
should be used for each climate zone and soil type, regardless of the land use. The reference stock is then multiplied 
by land use, input and management factors to estimate the stock for each land use based on the set of management 
systems that are present in a country. In addition, the depth for evaluating soil C stock changes can be different 
with the Tier 2 method. However, this will require consistency with the depth of the reference C stocks (SOCREF) 
and stock change factors for all land uses (i.e., FLU, FI, and FMG) to ensure consistency in the application of methods 
for estimating the impact of land use change on soil carbon stocks. Additional guidance is provided in Chapter 2, 
Section 2.3.3.1. 
The carbon stock estimates may be improved when deriving country-specific factors for FLU and FMG, by 
expressing carbon stocks on a soil-mass equivalent basis rather than a soil-volume equivalent (i.e., fixed depth) 
basis. This is because the soil mass in a certain soil depth changes with the various operations associated with land 
use that affect the density of the soil, such as uprooting, land levelling, tillage, and rain compaction due to the 
disappearance of the cover of tree canopy. However, it is important to realize that all data used to derive stock 
change factors across all land uses must be on an equivalent mass basis if this method is applied.  This will be

challenging to do comprehensively for all land uses. See Box 2.2c in Chapter 2, Section 2.3.3.1 for more 
information. 
Tier 3 
Constant stock change rate factors per se are less likely to be estimated in favor of variable rates that more 
accurately capture land-use and management effects.  See Section 2.3.3.1 (Chapter 2) for further discussion.

4.3.3.3 CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA  
Mineral soils 
Tier 1 and Tier 2 
For purposes of estimating soil carbon stock change, area estimates of Land Converted to Forest Land should be 
stratified according to major climate regions and soil types. This can be based on overlays with suitable climate 
and soil maps and spatially-explicit data of the location of land conversions. Detailed descriptions of the default 
climate and soil classification schemes are provided in Chapter 3. Specific information is provided in the each of 
the land-use sections regarding treatment of land-use/management activity data (Forest Land in Section 4.2.3.3, 
Cropland in 5.2.3.3, Grassland in 6.2.3.3, Wetlands in 7.2.3.2, Settlements in 8.2.3.3, and Other Land in 9.3.3.3). 
One critical issue in evaluating the impact of Land Converted to Forest Land on soil organic C stocks is the 
previous land-use and management activity.  Activity data gathered using Approach 2 or 3 (see Chapter 3 for 
discussion about Approaches) provide the underlying basis for determining the previous land use and management 
for Land Converted to Forest Land.  In contrast, aggregate data (Approach 1, Chapter 3) only provide the total 
amount of area in each land use and do not form a basis for determining specific transitions. Moreover, aggregate 
data only represent the net changes in land use and management rather than the gross changes, which could be 
considerably larger and may have an impact on the total soil C stock changes.  Regardless, with aggregate data 
(Approach 1), changes in soil organic C stocks may be computed separately for each land-use category and then 
combined to obtain the total stock change even if the total changes do not capture the full dynamics occurring with 
land use change.  Using this approach, it will be necessary for coordination among each land-use category to ensure 
the total land base is remaining constant over time, given that some land area will be lost and gained within 
individual land-use category during each inventory year due to land-use change. Further clarification on soil 
organic C estimation methods in case of land-use change is presented in Section 2.3.3.1.  
Tier 3 
For application of dynamic models and/or a direct measurement-based inventory in Tier 3, similar or more detailed 
data on the combinations of climate, soil, topographic and management data are needed, relative to Tier 1 or 2 
method, but the exact requirements will be dependent on the model or measurement design.

4.3.3.4 CALCULATION STEPS FOR TIER 1 
Mineral soils 
The steps for estimating SOC0 and SOC(0-T) and net soil C stock change per ha of Land Converted to Forest Land 
are as follows: 
Step 1: Determine the land-use and management by mineral soil types and climate regions for land at the 
beginning of the inventory period, which can vary depending on the time step of the activity data (0-T; e.g., 5, 10 
or 20 years ago). 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
4.14 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Step 2: Select the native reference C stock value (SOCREF), based on climate and soil type from Table 2.3, for 
each area of land being inventoried.  The reference C stocks are the same for all land-use categories to ensure that 
erroneous changes in the C stocks are not computed due to differences in reference stock values among sectors. 
Step 3: Select the land-use factor (FLU), management factor (FMG) and C input levels (FI) representing the land-
use and management system present before conversion to forest.  Values for FLU, FMG and FI are given in the 
respective section for the land-use sector (Cropland in Chapter 5, and Grassland in Chapter 6).   
Step 4: Multiply these values by the reference soil C stock to estimate of ‘initial’ soil organic C stock (SOC(0-T)) 
for the inventory time period.    
Step 5: Estimate SOC0 by repeating step 1 to 4 using the same native reference C stock (SOCREF), but with land-
use, management and input factors that represent conditions in the last (year 0) inventory year. For Tier 1, all stock 
change factors are assumed equal to 1 for Forest Land (although for Tier 2, different values for these factors under 
newly converted Forest Land should be used, based on country-specific data). 
Step 6: Estimate the average annual change in soil C stock for the area over the inventory time period, ∆CCCMineral, 
(see Equation 2.25 in Chapter 2). 
Step 7: Repeat Steps 1 to 6 if there are additional inventory time periods (e.g., 1990 to 2000, 2001 to 2010, etc.). 
A numerical example is given below for afforestation of cropland soil.  
Example: An area of 100,000 ha of cropland was planted to forest.  The soil type is an Ultisol in a 
tropical moist climate, which has a native reference stock, SOCRef (0-30 cm), of 47 tonnes C ha-1 
(Table 2.3). The previous land use was annual row crops, with conventional tillage, no fertilization 
and where crop residues are removed, so that the soil carbon stock at the beginning of the inventory 
time period (in this example, 5 yrs earlier in 1995) was (SOCRef ● FLU ● FMG ● FI) = 47 tonnes C ha-
1 ● 0.48 ● 1 ● 0.92 = 20.8 tonnes C ha-1 (see Table 5.5, Chapter 5, for stock change factor for 
cropland). Under Tier 1, managed forest is assumed to have the same soil C stock as the reference 
condition (i.e. all stock change factors are equal to 1). Thus, the average annual change in soil C 
stock for the area over the inventory time period is estimated as (47 tonnes C ha-1 – 20.8 tonnes C 
ha-1) / 20 yrs = 1.3 tonnes C ha-1 yr-1.  For the area reforested there is an increase of 131,000 tonnes 
C yr-1. (Note: 20 years is the time dependence of the stock change factor, i.e., factor represents annual 
rate of change over 20 years)

Developing a consistent time series 
It is good practice to develop a consistent time series of inventories of anthropogenic emissions and removals of 
greenhouse gases for all AFOLU categories using the guidance in Volume 1, Chapter 5. Because forest-related 
activity data and emission factors may only be available every few years, achieving time series consistency may 
require interpolation or extrapolation from longer timeseries or trend.  
  
Chapter 4: Forest Land 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.15 
In addition to the general guidance on gap filling (e.g. on linear interpolation or extrapolation) in Volume 1, 
Chapter 5, further guidance is provided here on how to ensure methodological consistency in the case of the Forest 
Land category. When extrapolation may allow reflecting the evolution of the main drivers of emissions and 
removals during the period to be gap filled, including forest increment and harvest, with a greater level of accuracy 
than a linear interpolation or extrapolation. 
Generally, these functional relationships are expressed in models which are applied to simulate the dynamics of 
carbon stocks in different pools, taking into account a number of interrelated variables.These variables include: 
forest characteristics (i.e. forest types, soil types, tree species composition, growing stock, age-class structure) and 
management practices (i.e. regeneration modality, rotation lengths, thinning frequency, etc.); the carbon pools and 
gases; the estimation parameters for HWP; the treatment of natural disturbances; the possible inclusion of impact 
of “indirect human-induced effects” (see Section 2.5), such as human-induced climate and environmental changes 
(e.g., temperature, precipitation, CO2 and nitrogen deposition feedbacks) that affect growth, mortality, 
decomposition rates and natural disturbances regimes. 
Among these, harvest volume is a key driver of emissions and removals. To this regard, if the actual harvest 
volume for the period to be extrapolated is known with confidence, then the model may directly apply this harvest 
volume, in combination with the other variables above. However, sometimes no reliable statistics on harvest 
volume (or other suitable proxies) are available for the period to be gap-filled. In this case, it is good practice to 
assume that the historical management practices continue during the period to be gap-filled. These practices should 
be those applied (and documented) in the existing time series, e.g. for the “calibration period” (see below). The 
functional relationships between available timber stocks, age structure dynamics, the increment and the harvest 
volume under the continuation of management practices (which is the basis of yield tables for forest management) 
can be used to calculate a consistent time series of annual C stock gains (forest net increment) and annual C stock 
losses (e.g. harvest, etc.). For example, if a given tree species is typically harvested at 80 years, the extrapolation 
based on functional relationships will apply this harvesting age (i.e. the historical forest management practice) also 
in the period to be gap-filled, taking into account the age structure dynamics (e.g. if the forest is getting older, 
more area reaching 80 years may be available); the carbon gains will be calculated using the forest net increment 
associated with the age structure and harvest volume simulated for the period to be gap-filled. An example of 
resolving data gaps in Forest Land through an extrapolation based on functional relationships is provided in Box 
4.3b. 
It is good practice that the model used for extrapolation utilizes information on the methodological elements above 
that is consistent with those used in the rest of the time series.  
A change in any of the variables above used in the existing (non-extrapolated) time series (e.g., adding a new 
carbon pool) triggers a methodological inconsistency, to be addressed through a re-run, for the entire time series, 
of the model used for the extrapolation. Such re-run should ensure consistency in the variables described above. 
As a general check for the consistency, it is good practice to demonstrate that the model used for the extrapolation 
reproduces the existing time series, for a selected “calibration period”. The length of this calibration period may 
depend on various factors, but it is preferable to have at least 5 or 10 years of comparison between the model’s 
results and the existing time series. If the model results for the calibration period fall within the estimated range of 
uncertainty of the existing time series (as documented in the GHG inventory), any remaining discontinuity between 
the existing time series and the portion extrapolated may be addressed through the application of the “overlap” 
technique (Volume 1, Chapter 5.3.3.1) to extrapolated data. This procedure will affect the level of modelled GHG 
estimates, but not their trend. If, for the calibration period, the model’s results do not fall within the reported range 
of uncertainty of the existing time series, it is not good practice to use these results for extrapolating the time series. 
An example of resolving forest data gaps through extrapolation based on functional relationships is provided in

BOX 4.3B (NEW) 
EXAMPLE OF RESOLVING FOREST DATA GAPS THROUGH EXTRAPOLATION BASED ON FUNCTIONAL 
RELATIONSHIPS 
Consider a case in which the stock difference method (see Volume 4, Chapter 2.3) is applied to 
construct a consistent time series between 1990 and 2015. Suppose that the next complete forest 
inventory will be reported in 2025, and that no reliable harvest data after 2015 is available. Until this 
inventory becomes available, the GHG emissions after 2015 may need to be extrapolated. 
One option is to apply a linear extrapolation to the historical time series. Another option, to be 
considered especially when age structure dynamics exert a relevant impact on the trend of forest 
CO2 fluxes, is to extrapolate the historical GHG emissions through functional relationships. To this 
aim, a model may be used to calculate, for the period to be gap-filled, the net increment and the 
harvest volumes associated with the continuation of historical management practices. 
A theoretical example of the impact of different extrapolation approaches is provided in the 
following table, for selected years and for the living biomass of forests that are assumed to approach 
maturity. 
For the purpose of extrapolating based on functional relationships, a model calculates the harvest 
volumes in the period to be gap-filled through the intersection between the continuation of historical 
forest management practices and the available timber stocks as affected by the age-related forest 
dynamics.

In this example, the net forest increment has increased in the historical period (2000-2015) more 
than the increase in harvest volumes. As a result, the sink (net change in C) has also increased. A 
linear extrapolation of this trend would lead to a further increase on the sink in 2020. However, in 
this example, the forests are aging, i.e. more forest area reaches maturity. As a consequence, 
assuming the continuation of the historical forest management practices, in 2020 the net increment 
is expected to saturate (i.e. in the table it remains at the 2015 levels) and the total harvest volume is 
expected to increase (because more area will reach maturity, and thus more biomass will be ready 
to be harvested). The resulting sink would also decline, in contrast with what obtained by the linear 
extrapolation. In this theoretical case, the extrapolation based on functional relationships may be 
considered to provide a more realistic estimate of GHG emissions in the period to be gap-filled. 
Where countries use Tier 1 methods, estimates of dead organic matter (DOM) stock changes are only provided in 
the case of land-use change to or from Forest Land. It is good practice to recalculate the entire time series of data 
if either the default values for litter and dead wood carbon pools or the lengths of the transition periods are changed. 
It is also good practice to recalculate the entire time series of estimates if revisions to activity data, such as the rate 
of land-use change, have occurred. As more ground plot and other sample data on dead wood and litter carbon 
stocks become available in the future, countries are likely to improve the models used in higher Tier estimation 
procedures. It is good practice to use the same model parameter values (such as litterfall rates, decay rates, 
disturbance impacts) for the entire time series and to recalculate the entire time series if one or more of the model 
parameters have changed. Failure to do so may result in artificial sources or sinks, for example as a result of decay 
rate modifications.

1 Aboveground net biomass growth is defined as net change in total aboveground biomass over time. In this respect, both forest 
productivity and mortality are accounted for. 
2 Some categories include sub-strata for primary forests defined as old growth forests that are intact or with no active human intervention, 
and secondary forests which include all other forests. The table considers a forest definition of at least 10% tree canopy cover.  
3 For above-ground biomass growth rates with no standard deviation, IPCC Tier 1 default uncertainties apply. 
4 Forest Resources Assessment (FRA). (2015). Global Eological Zones for FAO Forest Reporting 2010 Update. Forest Resources 
Assessment Working Paper 179. 
Observations on ecological zone and continent columns 
Above-ground biomass growth rate was taken from: Tropical moist deciduous forest - North and South America (Primary); Tropical 
moist deciduous forest - North and South America (Primary); Tropical moist deciduous forest - Africa (Secondary>20 years); Tropical 
dry forest – North and South America (Secondary>20 years); Tropical dry forest – North and South America (Secondary≤20 years); 
Tropical dry forest – North and South America (Secondary>20 years); Tropical dry forest – North and South America (Secondary≤20 
years); Tropical mountain system – North and South America (Primary); Tropical mountain system – North and South America
