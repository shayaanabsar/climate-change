Normal Operations: . Emissions from normal operations can be divided into two
main source categories: (1) venting and flaring and (2) discharges from process
vents, chronic leaks, etc.
Venting and Flaring - Venting and flaring refers to the disposal of gas that cannot
be contained or otherwise handled.  Such venting and flaring activities are associated
with combined oil and gas production and take place in production areas where gas
pipeline infrastructure is incomplete and the natural gas is not injected into
reservoirs (emissions from process vents are not included here - see below).
Venting activities release methane because the vented gas typically has a high
methane content.  If the excess gas is burned in flares the emissions of methane will
depend on how efficient the burning processes are.  Generally the combustion
efficiency for flare sources are assumed to be between 95 and 100 per cent.
However a new study based upon measurements carried out by Norwegian Oil
Industry Association - OLF (1993) indicates very small amounts of unburned
methane from flares, less than 0.1 per cent of the gas flared.  To estimate the
methane emissions from venting and flaring activities satisfactorily it is required to
know the flare efficiency rates and the division between the quantity of gas vented
and gas flared.
The combined quantity of gas vented and flared is reported by countries that
produce oil and gas (Barns and Edmonds, 1990).  A few countries also are able to
report separately gas vented and gas flared.  The reliability of the data is
questionable in many cases because vented and flared amounts are not normally
metered but inferred from the difference between total production and disposals.
Discharges from Process Vents, Chronic Leaks etc.  - These include:
•
Emissions from pneumatic devices (gas-operated controls such as valves and
actuators) depend on the size, type, age of the devices, the frequency of their
operation and the quality of their maintenance.
•
Leaks from system components are unintentional and usually continuous
releases resulting from the failure of a seal or the development of a flaw, crack
or hole in a component designed to contain or convey oil or gas.  Connections,
valves, flanges, instruments, and compressor shafts can develop leaks from
flawed or worn seals, while pipelines and storage tanks can develop leaks from
cracks or from corrosion.
•
Emissions from process vents, such as vents on glycol dehydrators and vents on
crude oil tankers and storage tanks resulting from normal operation of the
facilities.  However such process vents are minor methane sources in most gas
production facilities.
•
Emissions from starting and stopping reciprocating engines and turbines.
•
Emissions during drilling activities, e.g., gas migration from reservoirs through
wells.
2
Maintenance: Includes regular and periodic activities performed in the operation of
the facility.  These activities may be conducted frequently, such as launching and
receiving scrapers (“pigs”) in a pipeline, or infrequently, such as evacuation of pipes
("blowdown") for periodic testing.  In each case, the required procedures release
gas from the affected equipment.  Releases also occur during maintenance of wells
("well workovers") and during replacement or maintenance of fittings.
3
System Upsets and Accidents:  System upsets are unplanned events in the
system, the most common of which is a sudden pressure surge resulting from the
failure of a pressure regulator.  The potential for unplanned pressure surges is

considered during facility design, and facilities are provided with pressure relief
systems to protect the equipment from damage due to the increased pressure.
Relief systems vary in design.  In some cases, gases released through relief valves may
be collected and transported to a flare for combustion or re-compressed and
re-injected into the system.  In these cases, methane emissions associated with
pressure relief events will be small.  In older facilities, relief systems may vent gases
directly into the atmosphere or may send gases to flare systems where complete
combustion may not be achieved.
The frequency of system upsets varies with the facility design and operating
practices.  In particular, facilities operating well below capacity are less likely to
experience system upsets and resulting emissions.  Emissions associated with
accidents are also included under the category of upsets.  Occasionally, gas
transmission and distribution pipelines are accidentally ruptured by construction
equipment or other activities.
Table 1-56 lists the most important sources of emissions within each segment of the
oil and gas industry.  Based on available information, the sources listed as "major"
account for the majority of emissions from each segment.  Because data are limited
and, because there is considerable diversity among oil and gas systems throughout
the world, other possible sources are listed which may, in some cases, be important
contributors to emissions.

that emissions rates from similar activities in various regions and countries are influenced
by differences in the industry's supporting infrastructure, operating and maintenance
practices, and level of technology used.  Because natural gas and oil activities are complex,
it is not easy to define simple relationships between emissions and gross descriptors of
the activities undertaken.
The available published data were reviewed to identify emissions estimates that include: a
detailed consideration of the physical attributes of oil and gas systems; the operation and
maintenance characteristics of key facilities; and country- or region-specific factors that
may influence emission rates.  The following data were identified:
•
Surveys:  Several studies have surveyed system operators to estimate emissions as
a fraction of production or throughput.  These studies include Alphatania (1989),
AGA (1989), and INGAA (1989).  While these studies provide a basis for identifying
the activities that operators believe are likely to be major sources of emissions, they
are not based on detailed assessments of emission rates and therefore do not
provide a quantitative basis for making estimates of methane emissions from oil and
natural gas activities.
•
Estimates Based on “Reported Unaccounted For Gas”:  Several studies, such
as Hitchcock and Wechsler (1972), Abrahamson (1989) and Cicerone and
Oremland (1988), have assumed that emissions can be approximated by reported
amounts of "unaccounted for" gas.  Unaccounted for gas is defined as the difference
between gas production and gas consumption on an annual basis.  Like estimates of
venting and flaring, unaccounted for gas often is used as an accounting convenience
to balance company or national production and consumption estimates.
The use of unaccounted for gas estimates as estimates of emissions is questionable
because factors other than emissions account for the majority of the gas listed as
unaccounted for.  These include:  meter inaccuracies, use of gas within the system
itself, theft of gas (PG&E, 1990), variations in temperature and pressure and
differences in billing cycles and accounting procedures between companies receiving
and delivering the gas (INGAA, 1989).  Furthermore, because known releases of gas
are not reflected in unaccounted for gas estimates, such as emissions from
compressor exhaust, the unaccounted for gas estimates cannot unambiguously be
considered an upper or lower bound on emissions.
•
Engineering Studies and Measurements:  A small number of studies are based
on detailed engineering and/or field measurement analyses.  Several engineering
analyses have considered the manner in which actual or model facilities are built and
operated, and extrapolate facility emissions to a system-wide basis.  Several
measurement studies have measured emissions from operating facilities or identified
actual leaks and extrapolated these measurements to estimate system-wide
emissions.  In general, data from engineering studies and measurements are the
preferred basis for emission estimates.  However, only a few of these types of
studies have been performed, thereby limiting the ability to estimate emissions
nationally, regionally and globally from oil and gas systems.  Table 1-57 lists the
studies identified and the information they contain.  The methane emissions
estimates from the studies in the table have been converted to common units of
kilograms of emissions per petajoule of energy (kg/PJ).  A total of five studies are
listed, with emissions estimates for parts of North America (US EPA, 1992), Eastern
Europe (Rabchuk et al., 1991), and Western Europe (Schneider-Fresenius et al.,
1989, Norwegian SPCA, 1992b and Norwegian Oil Industry Association OLF, 1993).
Additionally, Barns and Edmonds (1990) present estimates based on a global
assessment.   Further studies are needed to improve the basis for making emissions
estimates.

The above methodology and emission factors are based on the report of an expert group
convened to advise the IPCC/OECD/IEA programme on methods and data in this specific
area (Ebert, et al., 1993).  Since that group delivered its report in mid-1993, a more
recent analysis (US EPA, 1994b) has provided a somewhat different interpretation of
some emission factors.  While this very detailed analysis endorses the basic tiered
methodology included in this Manual, the emission factors it derives differ from those
presented here.  This evaluation was based on essentially the same set of measurement
data as cited in this Manual, but draws different results from the limited available data.
The results of the recent US EPA analysis are summarised in Table 1-58.  The most
significant differences are in natural gas processing, transportation and distribution, where
a more detailed set of emission factor ranges are recommended for non-OECD
countries, some which are based on production of natural gas and some which are based
on consumption of natural gas (which is the case for all of the factors provided above).
Where emission factors are provided for more than one subcategory, they are intended
to be additive, and would result in a  higher total emissions estimates.  Other differences
in this US EPA analysis are that venting and flaring emissions for Western Europe are
based on oil rather than gas production, and there are minor revisions to some factors
for fugitive and other emissions from gas production.
These differences are significant, even given the overall uncertainty in this category, and
should be considered carefully by national experts in regions where emissions from this

A three-tiered approach is presented for estimating methane emissions from oil and gas
activities.  The specific tiers are listed below in the order of increasing sophistication, data
requirements, and accuracy:
•
Tier 1 - Production-Based Average Emission Factors Approach,
•
Tier 2 - Mass Balance Approach, and
•
Tier 3 - Rigorous Source-Specific Approach.
Countries should select the approach or combination of approaches that is most suited
to their circumstances.  Some important considerations may include the relative
contribution of oil and natural gas to total methane emissions for the country, the
available information and resources, and the complexity of the local oil and gas industry.
Regardless of the method that is used, the results must be aggregated back to a Tier 1
format to provide a consistent basis for comparison.
Note that methane emissions from combustion plant and incomplete combustion in
flaring processes in the non-oil and gas industry are excluded.  They are accounted for
separately in the section on methane emissions from combustion and industry.
Tier 1 - Production-Based Average Emission Factors Approach
This is the simplest approach for estimating CH4 emission from oil and gas activities, and
is the only one that does not require any direct interaction with the oil and gas industry
and associated regulatory agencies.  Accordingly, it is the least reliable of the methods.
The required activity data may be easily referenced from published documents of the IEA
or the United Nations Statistical Division, and the necessary emission factors are
provided in this document.  The Tier 1 Approach can be used as a starting point for any
country, and may be all that is needed where the emissions from a country's oil and gas
industry are comparatively small and/or where data or resources are not available to
pursue a more rigorous approach.
Production Base: To estimate emissions, the following steps are recommended as a
default estimation procedure:
1
Global oil and gas systems have been divided into regions with relatively
homogeneous oil and gas system characteristics.  Each country should decide which
system characterisation best fits its own oil and gas system(s).
2
For each region, representative emission factors for each activity within each
segment have been selected with the objective of taking into account the various
system designs and operating practices found in each region.
3
For each country, country-specific activity levels must be obtained and multiplied by
the appropriate emission factor.  Emission factors for countries should be selected
from those corresponding to the appropriate region.
As more data become available for oil and gas producing activities within different
countries, the default methodology described above (including activity data and emission
factors) should be refined.  Each step is discussed below in more detail.
Regional Definitions: Regions have been defined considering the limitations in data on
emission factors and activity levels, but also recognising the key differences in oil and gas
systems that are found globally.  The following five regions are recommended at this time:

•
USA and Canada:  The United States is a large producer and importer of oil and
is a large producer of gas.  Detailed emissions estimates are available for the United
States.
•
Former USSR and Eastern Europe:  Indications are that emission rates from
this region are much higher than emission rates from other regions, in particular for
the gas system.  This region includes the former USSR (which is by far the largest oil
and gas producer in the region), Albania, Bulgaria, Czech & Slovak Republics,
Hungary, Poland, Romania, and the former Yugoslavia.
•
Western Europe:  This region is a net importer of oil and gas, and mainly
produces oil and gas off shore.  This region includes: Austria, Belgium, Denmark,
Faroe Islands, Finland, France, Germany, Gibraltar, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy,
Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and
the United Kingdom.
•
Other Oil Exporting Countries:  This region includes the world's other major
oil producing countries: the 11 OPEC members (Algeria, Libya, Nigeria, Venezuela,
Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates),
Gabon, Ecuador and Mexico.  Generally, these countries produce large quantities of
oil and have limited markets for gas.
•
Rest of the World: This region includes the remaining countries of Asia, Africa,
Middle East, Oceania and Latin America.
In defining these regions, countries with relatively similar oil and gas systems were
aggregated.  Additional investigation would likely improve the definition of the regions.
Emission Factors: As discussed above, the basis for selecting emission factors is weak
because very few detailed studies of emissions have been performed.  Using the
information summarised in Table 1-57, emission factors should be selected by industry
segment and emission type for each of the regions.  In some cases data from the United
States were used when region-specific information was not available.
Tables 1-60 to 1-64 offer emission factors for each region.  Emission factors from US
EPA (1992) were used for the United States.  Key emission factors for Eastern Europe
and the Former USSR were taken from Rabchuk et al. (1990) and Barns and Edmonds
(1990).  Estimates were used for emission factors for venting and flaring for the several
regions, including Eastern Europe.
Studies by Schneider-Fresenius et al. (1989) and Norwegian SPCA (1992b) were adopted
as representative of emission factors for Western European gas production, venting and
flaring.  No region-specific data were available for the Other Oil Exporting countries and
the Rest of the World.  Emission factors in these regions are expected to fall between
the relatively low rates found in North America and Western Europe and the relatively
high rates found in Eastern Europe.  Consequently, a range of emission factors is
suggested for these regions unless more information can be obtained.
Activity Levels: Data on the quantity of oil and gas produced, refined, and consumed
can be obtained from the IEA or the UN Statistical Division.  Sources are described in
Section 1.2.1 Data Sources.  Data on oil refining capacity can be used to approximate oil
refined.  Data on oil tankered were not available by region.  It is important for national
experts to ensure that production figures used in calculation of apparent consumption for
CO2 emissions estimates (described in the Tier 1 method for CO2) are consistent with
those used in this section.

Tier 2 - Mass Balance Approach
The Mass Balance Approach is only recommended for oil system releases of CH4, and
should not be used for releases from natural gas activities.  No Tier 2 method exists for
natural gas activities.  This is a priority for future work.  The Mass Balance Approach
employs standard, generally easy-to-obtain, oil and gas data (i.e., production volumes, gas-
to-oil ratios (GORs), and gas compositions) to estimate the maximum amount of
methane that could be  emitted to the atmosphere by different sectors of the oil and gas
industry. These amounts are then scaled to reflect actual emissions by applying
appropriate emission factors.  The minimum emission factors account for the amount of
gas that is disposed of by control devices, consumed by combustion equipment,
conserved, or reinjected.  Leak emission factors account for the amounts lost through
leaks from these control/utilisation systems.
The basic procedures for performing the mass balance calculations for each oil and gas
activity are set out  below.  Total CH4 emissions is the sum of emissions for each of these
activities.  Default data and factors are provided where possible.
Oil Production: Emissions from oil production may be estimated using the relation,
where
EOil-P
=
methane emissions from oil production (Tg/year)
QOil-P
=
oil produced (m3/year)
GOR
=
gas to oil ratio; defines the amount of gas produced (in volume) per unit of
oil produced (in volume).  (m3/m3, or dimensionless).
YCH4
=
methane Fraction; the volume of gas dissolved in the oil that is methane,
on a volume basis, for example, 0.1 m3 of methane per 1.0 m3 of gas.
(may be considered dimensionless)
KOil-P
=
emission factor for oil production, see below (dimensionless)
DGOR
=
density of methane at the temperature and pressure at which the GOR is
estimated, (g/m3).  The relevant temperature and pressure may vary,
depending on the values used to calculate the GOR.  For example, at 0°C
and a pressure of 1 atmosphere, the density of methane is 715.4 g/m3, and
at 20°C, and a pressure of 1 atmosphere, the density of methane is
666.6 g/m3.
The first two terms (QOil-P and GOR) estimate the total amount of gas that is withdrawn
from the ground while the oil is produced.  The term YCH4 converts the total gas quantity
into the quantity of methane (still on a volume basis).  The emission factor (KOil-P) is the
fraction of the total gas withdrawn that is emitted.  At most, KOil-P = 1.  To put the
emissions estimate on a mass basis, DGOR  is used to estimate grams, and the conversion
to teragrams follows.
