Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems 
Chapter 3
Executive Summary
This chapter builds on findings of AR5 and assesses new scientific 
evidence of changes in the climate system and the associated impacts 
on natural and human systems, with a specific focus on the magnitude 
and pattern of risks linked for global warming of 1.5°C above 
temperatures in the pre-industrial period. Chapter 3 explores observed 
impacts and projected risks to a range of natural and human systems, 
with a focus on how risk levels change from 1.5°C to 2°C of global 
warming. The chapter also revisits major categories of risk (Reasons for 
Concern, RFC) based on the assessment of new knowledge that has 
become available since AR5. 
1.5°C and 2°C Warmer Worlds
The global climate has changed relative to the pre-industrial 
period, and there are multiple lines of evidence that these 
changes have had impacts on organisms and ecosystems, as 
well as on human systems and well-being (high confidence). The 
increase in global mean surface temperature (GMST), which reached 
0.87°C in 2006–2015 relative to 1850–1900, has increased the 
frequency and magnitude of impacts (high confidence), strengthening 
evidence of how an increase in GMST of 1.5°C or more could impact 
natural and human systems (1.5°C versus 2°C). {3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 
Cross-Chapter Boxes 6, 7 and 8 in this chapter}
Human-induced global warming has already caused multiple 
observed changes in the climate system (high confidence). 
Changes include increases in both land and ocean temperatures, as well 
as more frequent heatwaves in most land regions (high confidence). 
There is also high confidence that global warming has resulted in an 
increase in the frequency and duration of marine heatwaves. Further, 
there is substantial evidence that human-induced global warming has 
led to an increase in the frequency, intensity and/or amount of heavy 
precipitation events at the global scale (medium confidence), as well 
as an increased risk of drought in the Mediterranean region (medium 
confidence). {3.3.1, 3.3.2, 3.3.3, 3.3.4, Box 3.4}
Trends in intensity and frequency of some climate and weather 
extremes have been detected over time spans during which 
about 0.5°C of global warming occurred (medium confidence). 
This assessment is based on several lines of evidence, including 
attribution studies for changes in extremes since 1950. {3.2, 3.3.1, 
3.3.2, 3.3.3, 3.3.4}
Several regional changes in climate are assessed to occur with 
global warming up to 1.5°C as compared to pre-industrial 
levels, including warming of extreme temperatures in many 
regions (high confidence), increases in frequency, intensity and/or 
amount of heavy precipitation in several regions (high confidence), 
and an increase in intensity or frequency of droughts in some regions 
(medium confidence). {3.3.1, 3.3.2, 3.3.3, 3.3.4, Table 3.2}
There is no single ‘1.5°C warmer world’ (high confidence). In 
addition to the overall increase in GMST, it is important to consider the 
size and duration of potential overshoots in temperature. Furthermore, 
there are questions on how the stabilization of an increase in GMST of 
1.5°C can be achieved, and how policies might be able to influence the 
resilience of human and natural systems, and the nature of regional 
and subregional risks. Overshooting poses large risks for natural and 
human systems, especially if the temperature at peak warming is 
high, because some risks may be long-lasting and irreversible, such 
as the loss of some ecosystems (high confidence). The rate of change 
for several types of risks may also have relevance, with potentially 
large risks in the case of a rapid rise to overshooting temperatures, 
even if a decrease to 1.5°C can be achieved at the end of the 21st 
century or later (medium confidence). If overshoot is to be minimized, 
the remaining equivalent CO2 budget available for emissions is very 
small, which implies that large, immediate and unprecedented global 
efforts to mitigate greenhouse gases are required (high confidence). 
{3.2, 3.6.2, Cross-Chapter Box 8 in this chapter}
Robust1 global differences in temperature means and extremes 
are expected if global warming reaches 1.5°C versus 2°C above 
the pre-industrial levels (high confidence). For oceans, regional 
surface temperature means and extremes are projected to be higher 
at 2°C compared to 1.5°C of global warming (high confidence). 
Temperature means and extremes are also projected to be higher at 
2°C compared to 1.5°C in most land regions, with increases being 
2–3 times greater than the increase in GMST projected for some 
regions (high confidence). Robust increases in temperature means and 
extremes are also projected at 1.5°C compared to present-day values 
(high confidence) {3.3.1, 3.3.2}. There are decreases in the occurrence 
of cold extremes, but substantial increases in their temperature, in 
particular in regions with snow or ice cover (high confidence) {3.3.1}.
Climate models project robust1 differences in regional climate 
between present-day and global warming up to 1.5°C2, and 
between 1.5°C and 2°C2 (high confidence), depending on the 
variable and region in question (high confidence). Large, robust 
and widespread differences are expected for temperature 
extremes (high confidence). Regarding hot extremes, the strongest 
warming is expected to occur at mid-latitudes in the warm season (with 
increases of up to 3°C for 1.5°C of global warming, i.e., a factor of two) 
and at high latitudes in the cold season (with increases of up to 4.5°C 
at 1.5°C of global warming, i.e., a factor of three) (high confidence). 
The strongest warming of hot extremes is projected to occur in 
central and eastern North America, central and southern Europe, the 
Mediterranean region (including southern Europe, northern Africa and 
the Near East), western and central Asia, and southern Africa (medium 
confidence). The number of exceptionally hot days are expected to 
increase the most in the tropics, where interannual temperature 
variability is lowest; extreme heatwaves are thus projected to emerge 
earliest in these regions, and they are expected to already become 
widespread there at 1.5°C global warming (high confidence). Limiting 
global warming to 1.5°C instead of 2°C could result in around 420 
1 
Robust is used here to mean that at least two thirds of climate models show the same sign of changes at the grid point scale, and that differences in large regions are 
statistically significant.

Projected changes in impacts between different levels of global warming are determined with respect to changes in global mean near-surface air temperature.

Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems
3
million fewer people being frequently exposed to extreme heatwaves, 
and about 65 million fewer people being exposed to exceptional 
heatwaves, assuming constant vulnerability (medium confidence). 
{3.3.1, 3.3.2, Cross-Chapter Box 8 in this chapter}
Limiting global warming to 1.5°C would limit risks of increases 
in heavy precipitation events on a global scale and in several 
regions compared to conditions at 2°C global warming 
(medium confidence). The regions with the largest increases in heavy 
precipitation events for 1.5°C to 2°C global warming include: several 
high-latitude regions (e.g. Alaska/western Canada, eastern Canada/
Greenland/Iceland, northern Europe and northern Asia); mountainous 
regions (e.g., Tibetan Plateau); eastern Asia (including China and Japan); 
and eastern North America (medium confidence). Tropical cyclones are 
projected to decrease in frequency but with an increase in the number 
of very intense cyclones (limited evidence, low confidence). Heavy 
precipitation associated with tropical cyclones is projected to be higher 
at 2°C compared to 1.5°C of global warming (medium confidence). 
Heavy precipitation, when aggregated at a global scale, is projected to 
be higher at 2°C than at 1.5°C of global warming (medium confidence) 
{3.3.3, 3.3.6}
Limiting global warming to 1.5°C is expected to substantially 
reduce the probability of extreme drought, precipitation deficits, 
and risks associated with water availability (i.e., water stress) in 
some regions (medium confidence). In particular, risks associated 
with increases in drought frequency and magnitude are projected to be 
substantially larger at 2°C than at 1.5°C in the Mediterranean region 
(including southern Europe, northern Africa and the Near East) and 
southern Africa (medium confidence). {3.3.3, 3.3.4, Box 3.1, Box 3.2} 
Risks to natural and human systems are expected to be lower 
at 1.5°C than at 2°C of global warming (high confidence). This 
difference is due to the smaller rates and magnitudes of climate 
change associated with a 1.5°C temperature increase, including lower 
frequencies and intensities of temperature-related extremes. Lower 
rates of change enhance the ability of natural and human systems 
to adapt, with substantial benefits for a wide range of terrestrial, 
freshwater, wetland, coastal and ocean ecosystems (including coral 
reefs) (high confidence), as well as food production systems, human 
health, and tourism (medium confidence), together with energy 
systems and transportation (low confidence). {3.3.1, 3.4}
Exposure to multiple and compound climate-related risks is 
projected to increase between 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming 
with greater proportions of people both exposed and susceptible to 
poverty in Africa and Asia (high confidence). For global warming from 
1.5°C to 2°C, risks across energy, food, and water sectors could overlap 
spatially and temporally, creating new – and exacerbating current – 
hazards, exposures, and vulnerabilities that could affect increasing 
numbers of people and regions (medium confidence). Small island 
states and economically disadvantaged populations are particularly at 
risk (high confidence). {3.3.1, 3.4.5.3, 3.4.5.6, 3.4.11, 3.5.4.9, Box 3.5}
Global warming of 2°C would lead to an expansion of areas with 
significant increases in runoff, as well as those affected by flood 
hazard, compared to conditions at 1.5°C (medium confidence). 
Global warming of 1.5°C would also lead to an expansion of the global 
land area with significant increases in runoff (medium confidence) and 
an increase in flood hazard in some regions (medium confidence) 
compared to present-day conditions. {3.3.5}
The probability of a sea-ice-free Arctic Ocean3 during summer 
is substantially higher at 2°C compared to 1.5°C of global 
warming (medium confidence). Model simulations suggest that 
at least one sea-ice-free Arctic summer is expected every 10 years 
for global warming of 2°C, with the frequency decreasing to one 
sea-ice-free Arctic summer every 100 years under 1.5°C (medium 
confidence). An intermediate temperature overshoot will have no long-
term consequences for Arctic sea ice coverage, and hysteresis is not 
expected (high confidence). {3.3.8, 3.4.4.7}
Global mean sea level rise (GMSLR) is projected to be around 
0.1 m (0.04 – 0.16 m) less by the end of the 21st century in a 
1.5°C warmer world compared to a 2°C warmer world (medium 
confidence). Projected GMSLR for 1.5°C of global warming has an 
indicative range of 0.26 – 0.77m, relative to 1986–2005, (medium 
confidence). A smaller sea level rise could mean that up to 10.4 million 
fewer people (based on the 2010 global population and assuming no 
adaptation) would be exposed to the impacts of sea level rise globally 
in 2100 at 1.5°C compared to at 2°C. A slower rate of sea level rise 
enables greater opportunities for adaptation (medium confidence). 
There is high confidence that sea level rise will continue beyond 2100. 
Instabilities exist for both the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, which 
could result in multi-meter rises in sea level on time scales of century 
to millennia. There is medium confidence that these instabilities could 
be triggered at around 1.5°C to 2°C of global warming. {3.3.9, 3.4.5, 
3.6.3}
The ocean has absorbed about 30% of the anthropogenic 
carbon dioxide, resulting in ocean acidification and changes to 
carbonate chemistry that are unprecedented for at least the 
last 65 million years (high confidence). Risks have been identified 
for the survival, calcification, growth, development and abundance of 
a broad range of marine taxonomic groups, ranging from algae to fish, 
with substantial evidence of predictable trait-based sensitivities (high 
confidence). There are multiple lines of evidence that ocean warming 
and acidification corresponding to 1.5°C of global warming would 
impact a wide range of marine organisms and ecosystems, as well as 
sectors such as aquaculture and fisheries (high confidence). {3.3.10, 
3.4.4}
Larger risks are expected for many regions and systems for 
global warming at 1.5°C, as compared to today, with adaptation 
required now and up to 1.5°C. However, risks would be larger at 2°C of 
warming and an even greater effort would be needed for adaptation to 
a temperature increase of that magnitude (high confidence). {3.4, Box 
3.4, Box 3.5, Cross-Chapter Box 6 in this chapter}

Ice free is defined for the Special Report as when the sea ice extent is less than 106 km2. Ice coverage less than this is considered to be equivalent to an ice-free Arctic Ocean 
for practical purposes in all recent studies.

Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems 
Chapter 3
Future risks at 1.5°C of global warming will depend on the 
mitigation pathway and on the possible occurrence of a 
transient overshoot (high confidence). The impacts on natural 
and human systems would be greater if mitigation pathways 
temporarily overshoot 1.5°C and return to 1.5°C later in the century, 
as compared to pathways that stabilize at 1.5°C without an overshoot 
(high confidence). The size and duration of an overshoot would also 
affect future impacts (e.g., irreversible loss of some ecosystems) (high 
confidence). Changes in land use resulting from mitigation choices 
could have impacts on food production and ecosystem diversity. {3.6.1, 
3.6.2, Cross-Chapter Boxes 7 and 8 in this chapter}
Climate Change Risks for Natural and Human systems 
Terrestrial and Wetland Ecosystems
Risks of local species losses and, consequently, risks of 
extinction are much less in a 1.5°C versus a 2°C warmer world 
(high confidence). The number of species projected to lose over 
half of their climatically determined geographic range at 2°C global 
warming (18% of insects, 16% of plants, 8% of vertebrates) is 
projected to be reduced to 6% of insects, 8% of plants and 4% of 
vertebrates at 1.5°C warming (medium confidence). Risks associated 
with other biodiversity-related factors, such as forest fires, extreme 
weather events, and the spread of invasive species, pests and 
diseases, would also be lower at 1.5°C than at 2°C of warming (high 
confidence), supporting a greater persistence of ecosystem services. 
{3.4.3, 3.5.2}
Constraining global warming to 1.5°C, rather than to 2°C 
and higher, is projected to have many benefits for terrestrial 
and wetland ecosystems and for the preservation of their 
services to humans (high confidence). Risks for natural and 
managed ecosystems are higher on drylands compared to humid 
lands. The global terrestrial land area projected to be affected by 
ecosystem transformations (13%, interquartile range 8–20%) at 2°C 
is approximately halved at 1.5°C global warming to 4% (interquartile 
range 2–7%) (medium confidence). Above 1.5°C, an expansion of 
desert terrain and vegetation would occur in the Mediterranean 
biome (medium confidence), causing changes unparalleled in the last 
10,000 years (medium confidence). {3.3.2.2, 3.4.3.2, 3.4.3.5, 3.4.6.1, 
3.5.5.10, Box 4.2}
Many impacts are projected to be larger at higher latitudes, 
owing to mean and cold-season warming rates above the 
global average (medium confidence). High-latitude tundra and 
boreal forest are particularly at risk, and woody shrubs are already 
encroaching into tundra (high confidence) and will proceed with 
further warming. Constraining warming to 1.5°C would prevent the 
thawing of an estimated permafrost area of 1.5 to 2.5 million km2 
over centuries compared to thawing under 2°C (medium confidence). 
{3.3.2, 3.4.3, 3.4.4}
Ocean Ecosystems
Ocean ecosystems are already experiencing large-scale 
changes, and critical thresholds are expected to be reached at 
1.5°C and higher levels of global warming (high confidence). 
In the transition to 1.5°C of warming, changes to water temperatures 
are expected to drive some species (e.g., plankton, fish) to relocate 
to higher latitudes and cause novel ecosystems to assemble (high 
confidence). Other ecosystems (e.g., kelp forests, coral reefs) are 
relatively less able to move, however, and are projected to experience 
high rates of mortality and loss (very high confidence). For example, 
multiple lines of evidence indicate that the majority (70–90%) of 
warm water (tropical) coral reefs that exist today will disappear even 
if global warming is constrained to 1.5°C (very high confidence). 
{3.4.4, Box 3.4}
Current ecosystem services from the ocean are expected to be 
reduced at 1.5°C of global warming, with losses being even 
greater at 2°C of global warming (high confidence). The risks 
of declining ocean productivity, shifts of species to higher latitudes, 
damage to ecosystems (e.g., coral reefs, and mangroves, seagrass 
and other wetland ecosystems), loss of fisheries productivity (at 
low latitudes), and changes to ocean chemistry (e.g., acidification, 
hypoxia and dead zones) are projected to be substantially lower 
when global warming is limited to 1.5°C (high confidence). {3.4.4, 
Box 3.4}
Water Resources
The projected frequency and magnitude of floods and droughts 
in some regions are smaller under 1.5°C than under 2°C of 
warming (medium confidence). Human exposure to increased 
flooding is projected to be substantially lower at 1.5°C compared to 
2°C of global warming, although projected changes create regionally 
differentiated risks (medium confidence). The differences in the risks 
among regions are strongly influenced by local socio-economic 
conditions (medium confidence). {3.3.4, 3.3.5, 3.4.2}
Risks of water scarcity are projected to be greater at 2°C than at 
1.5°C of global warming in some regions (medium confidence). 
Depending on future socio-economic conditions, limiting global 
warming to 1.5°C, compared to 2°C, may reduce the proportion of 
the world population exposed to a climate change-induced increase 
in water stress by up to 50%, although there is considerable variability 
between regions (medium confidence). Regions with particularly 
large benefits could include the Mediterranean and the Caribbean 
(medium confidence). Socio-economic drivers, however, are expected 
to have a greater influence on these risks than the changes in climate 
(medium confidence). {3.3.5, 3.4.2, Box 3.5}
Land Use, Food Security and Food Production Systems
Limiting global warming to 1.5°C, compared with 2°C, is 
projected to result in smaller net reductions in yields of maize, 
rice, wheat, and potentially other cereal crops, particularly in 
180
Chapter 3 
Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems

sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and Central and South America; 
and in the CO2-dependent nutritional quality of rice and wheat 
(high confidence). A loss of 7–10% of rangeland livestock globally 
is projected for approximately 2°C of warming, with considerable 
economic consequences for many communities and regions (medium 
confidence). {3.4.6, 3.6, Box 3.1, Cross-Chapter Box 6 in this chapter}
Reductions in projected food availability are larger at 2°C 
than at 1.5°C of global warming in the Sahel, southern Africa, 
the Mediterranean, central Europe and the Amazon (medium 
confidence). This suggests a transition from medium to high risk of 
regionally differentiated impacts on food security between 1.5°C and 
2°C (medium confidence). Future economic and trade environments 
and their response to changing food availability (medium confidence) 
are important potential adaptation options for reducing hunger risk 
in low- and middle-income countries. {Cross-Chapter Box 6 in this 
chapter}
Fisheries and aquaculture are important to global food security 
but are already facing increasing risks from ocean warming 
and acidification (medium confidence). These risks are 
projected to increase at 1.5°C of global warming and impact 
key organisms such as fin fish and bivalves (e.g., oysters), 
especially at low latitudes (medium confidence). Small-scale 
fisheries in tropical regions, which are very dependent on habitat 
provided by coastal ecosystems such as coral reefs, mangroves, 
seagrass and kelp forests, are expected to face growing risks at 1.5°C 
of warming because of loss of habitat (medium confidence). Risks 
of impacts and decreasing food security are projected to become 
greater as global warming reaches beyond 1.5°C and both ocean 
warming and acidification increase, with substantial losses likely for 
coastal livelihoods and industries (e.g., fisheries and aquaculture) 
(medium to high confidence). {3.4.4, 3.4.5, 3.4.6, Box 3.1, Box 3.4, 
Box 3.5, Cross-Chapter Box 6 in this chapter}
Land use and land-use change emerge as critical features of 
virtually all mitigation pathways that seek to limit global 
warming to 1.5°C (high confidence). Most least-cost mitigation 
pathways to limit peak or end-of-century warming to 1.5°C make 
use of carbon dioxide removal (CDR), predominantly employing 
significant levels of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage 
(BECCS) and/or afforestation and reforestation (AR) in their portfolio 
of mitigation measures (high confidence). {Cross-Chapter Box 7 in 
this chapter}
Large-scale deployment of BECCS and/or AR would have 
a far-reaching land and water footprint (high confidence). 
Whether this footprint would result in adverse impacts, for example 
on biodiversity or food production, depends on the existence and 
effectiveness of measures to conserve land carbon stocks, measures 
to limit agricultural expansion in order to protect natural ecosystems, 
and the potential to increase agricultural productivity (medium 
agreement). In addition, BECCS and/or AR would have substantial 
direct effects on regional climate through biophysical feedbacks, 
which are generally not included in Integrated Assessments Models 
(high confidence). {3.6.2, Cross-Chapter Boxes 7 and 8 in this chapter}
The impacts of large-scale CDR deployment could be greatly 
reduced if a wider portfolio of CDR options were deployed, if a 
holistic policy for sustainable land management were adopted, 
and if increased mitigation efforts were employed to strongly 
limit the demand for land, energy and material resources, 
including through lifestyle and dietary changes (medium 
confidence). In particular, reforestation could be associated with 
significant co-benefits if implemented in a manner than helps restore 
natural ecosystems (high confidence). {Cross-Chapter Box 7 in this 
chapter}
Human Health, Well-Being, Cities and Poverty
Any increase in global temperature (e.g., +0.5°C) is projected 
to affect human health, with primarily negative consequences 
(high confidence). Lower risks are projected at 1.5°C than at 2°C 
for heat-related morbidity and mortality (very high confidence), and 
for ozone-related mortality if emissions needed for ozone formation 
remain high (high confidence). Urban heat islands often amplify the 
impacts of heatwaves in cities (high confidence). Risks for some 
vector-borne diseases, such as malaria and dengue fever are projected 
to increase with warming from 1.5°C to 2°C, including potential 
shifts in their geographic range (high confidence). Overall for vector-
borne diseases, whether projections are positive or negative depends 
on the disease, region and extent of change (high confidence). Lower 
risks of undernutrition are projected at 1.5°C than at 2°C (medium 
confidence). Incorporating estimates of adaptation into projections 
reduces the magnitude of risks (high confidence). {3.4.7, 3.4.7.1, 
3.4.8, 3.5.5.8} 
Global warming of 2°C is expected to pose greater risks to urban 
areas than global warming of 1.5°C (medium confidence). The 
extent of risk depends on human vulnerability and the effectiveness 
of adaptation for regions (coastal and non-coastal), informal 
settlements and infrastructure sectors (such as energy, water and 
transport) (high confidence). {3.4.5, 3.4.8}
Poverty and disadvantage have increased with recent warming 
(about 1°C) and are expected to increase for many populations 
as average global temperatures increase from 1°C to 1.5°C 
and higher (medium confidence). Outmigration in agricultural-
dependent communities is positively and statistically significantly 
associated with global temperature (medium confidence). Our 
understanding of the links of 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming to 
human migration are limited and represent an important knowledge 
gap. {3.4.10, 3.4.11, 5.2.2, Table 3.5}
Key Economic Sectors and Services
Risks to global aggregated economic growth due to climate 
change impacts are projected to be lower at 1.5°C than at 2°C 
by the end of this century (medium confidence). {3.5.2, 3.5.3} 
The largest reductions in economic growth at 2°C compared 
to 1.5°C of warming are projected for low- and middle-income 
countries and regions (the African continent, Southeast Asia, 
India, Brazil and Mexico) (low to medium confidence). Countries

Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems 
Chapter 3
in the tropics and Southern Hemisphere subtropics are projected to 
experience the largest impacts on economic growth due to climate 
change should global warming increase from 1.5°C to 2°C (medium 
confidence). {3.5}
Global warming has already affected tourism, with increased 
risks projected under 1.5°C of warming in specific geographic 
regions and for seasonal tourism including sun, beach and 
snow sports destinations (very high confidence). Risks will be 
lower for tourism markets that are less climate sensitive, such as 
gaming and large hotel-based activities (high confidence). Risks for 
coastal tourism, particularly in subtropical and tropical regions, will 
increase with temperature-related degradation (e.g., heat extremes, 
storms) or loss of beach and coral reef assets (high confidence). 
{3.3.6, 3.4.4.12, 3.4.9.1, Box 3.4}
Small Islands, and Coastal and Low-lying areas
Small islands are projected to experience multiple inter-
related risks at 1.5°C of global warming that will increase with 
warming of 2°C and higher levels (high confidence). Climate 
hazards at 1.5°C are projected to be lower compared to those at 2°C 
(high confidence). Long-term risks of coastal flooding and impacts on 
populations, infrastructures and assets (high confidence), freshwater 
stress (medium confidence), and risks across marine ecosystems (high 
confidence) and critical sectors (medium confidence) are projected to 
increase at 1.5°C compared to present-day levels and increase further 
at 2°C, limiting adaptation opportunities and increasing loss and 
damage (medium confidence). Migration in small islands (internally 
and internationally) occurs for multiple reasons and purposes, mostly 
for better livelihood opportunities (high confidence) and increasingly 
owing to sea level rise (medium confidence). {3.3.2.2, 3.3.6–9, 
3.4.3.2, 3.4.4.2, 3.4.4.5, 3.4.4.12, 3.4.5.3, 3.4.7.1, 3.4.9.1, 3.5.4.9, 
Box 3.4, Box 3.5}
Impacts associated with sea level rise and changes to the 
salinity of coastal groundwater, increased flooding and 
damage to infrastructure, are projected to be critically 
important in vulnerable environments, such as small islands, 
low-lying coasts and deltas, at global warming of 1.5°C and 
2°C (high confidence). Localized subsidence and changes to river 
discharge can potentially exacerbate these effects. Adaptation is 
already happening (high confidence) and will remain important over 
multi-centennial time scales. {3.4.5.3, 3.4.5.4, 3.4.5.7, 5.4.5.4, Box 
3.5}
Existing and restored natural coastal ecosystems may be 
effective in reducing the adverse impacts of rising sea levels 
and intensifying storms by protecting coastal and deltaic 
regions (medium confidence). Natural sedimentation rates are 
expected to be able to offset the effect of rising sea levels, given 
the slower rates of sea level rise associated with 1.5°C of warming 
(medium confidence). Other feedbacks, such as landward migration 
of wetlands and the adaptation of infrastructure, remain important 
(medium confidence). {3.4.4.12, 3.4.5.4, 3.4.5.7}
Increased Reasons for Concern 
There are multiple lines of evidence that since AR5 the assessed 
levels of risk increased for four of the five Reasons for Concern 
(RFCs) for global warming levels of up to 2°C (high confidence). 
The risk transitions by degrees of global warming are now: from high 
to very high between 1.5°C and 2°C for RFC1 (Unique and threatened 
systems) (high confidence); from moderate to high risk between 1°C and 
1.5°C for RFC2 (Extreme weather events) (medium confidence); from 
moderate to high risk between 1.5°C and 2°C for RFC3 (Distribution of 
impacts) (high confidence); from moderate to high risk between 1.5°C 
and 2.5°C for RFC4 (Global aggregate impacts) (medium confidence); 
and from moderate to high risk between 1°C and 2.5°C for RFC5 
(Large-scale singular events) (medium confidence). {3.5.2}
1. 
The category ‘Unique and threatened systems’ (RFC1) 
display a transition from high to very high risk which is 
now located between 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming as 
opposed to at 2.6°C of global warming in AR5, owing to new and 
multiple lines of evidence for changing risks for coral reefs, the 
Arctic and biodiversity in general (high confidence). {3.5.2.1}
2. 
In ‘Extreme weather events’ (RFC2), the transition from 
moderate to high risk is now located between 1.0°C and 
1.5°C of global warming, which is very similar to the AR5 
assessment but is projected with greater confidence (medium 
confidence). The impact literature contains little information 
about the potential for human society to adapt to extreme 
weather events, and hence it has not been possible to locate 
the transition from ‘high’ to ‘very high’ risk within the context of 
assessing impacts at 1.5°C versus 2°C of global warming. There 
is thus low confidence in the level at which global warming could 
lead to very high risks associated with extreme weather events in 
the context of this report. {3.5} 
3. 
With respect to the ‘Distribution of impacts’ (RFC3) a 
transition from moderate to high risk is now located 
between 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming, compared with 
between 1.6°C and 2.6°C global warming in AR5, owing to new 
evidence about regionally differentiated risks to food security, 
water resources, drought, heat exposure and coastal submergence 
(high confidence). {3.5}
4. 
In ‘global aggregate impacts’ (RFC4) a transition from 
moderate to high levels of risk is now located between 
1.5°C and 2.5°C of global warming, as opposed to at 3.6°C of 
warming in AR5, owing to new evidence about global aggregate 
economic impacts and risks to Earth’s biodiversity (medium 
confidence). {3.5}
5. 
Finally, ‘large-scale singular events’ (RFC5), moderate risk 
is now located at 1°C of global warming and high risk is 
located at 2.5°C of global warming, as opposed to at 1.6°C 
(moderate risk) and around 4°C (high risk) in AR5, because of new 
observations and models of the West Antarctic ice sheet (medium 
confidence). {3.3.9, 3.5.2, 3.6.3}

3.1 
About the Chapter 
Chapter 3 uses relevant definitions of a potential 1.5°C warmer world 
from Chapters 1 and 2 and builds directly on their assessment of gradual 
versus overshoot scenarios. It interacts with information presented in 
Chapter 2 via the provision of specific details relating to the mitigation 
pathways (e.g., land-use changes) and their implications for impacts. 
Chapter 3 also includes information needed for the assessment and 
implementation of adaptation options (presented in Chapter 4), as 
well as the context for considering the interactions of climate change 
with sustainable development and for the assessment of impacts on 
sustainability, poverty and inequalities at the household to subregional 
level (presented in Chapter 5).
This chapter is necessarily transdisciplinary in its coverage of the 
climate system, natural and managed ecosystems, and human 
systems and responses, owing to the integrated nature of the natural 
and human experience. While climate change is acknowledged as a 
centrally important driver, it is not the only driver of risks to human and 
natural systems, and in many cases, it is the interaction between these 
two broad categories of risk that is important (Chapter 1).
The flow of the chapter, linkages between sections, a list of chapter- 
and cross-chapter boxes, and a content guide for reading according 
to focus or interest are given in Figure 3.1. Key definitions used in the 
chapter are collected in the Glossary. Confidence language is used 
throughout this chapter and likelihood statements (e.g., likely, very 
likely) are provided when there is high confidence in the assessment.

Figure 3.1 |  Chapter 3 structure and quick guide.
The underlying literature assessed in Chapter 3 is broad and includes a 
large number of recent publications specific to assessments for 1.5°C 
of warming. The chapter also utilizes information covered in prior 
IPCC special reports, for example the Special Report on Managing the 
Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change 
Adaptation (SREX; IPCC, 2012), and many chapters from the IPCC 
WGII Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) that assess impacts on natural 
and managed ecosystems and humans, as well as adaptation options 
(IPCC, 2014b). For this reason, the chapter provides information based 
on a broad range of assessment methods. Details about the approaches 
used are presented in Section 3.2. 
Section 3.3 gives a general overview of recent literature on observed 
climate change impacts as the context for projected future risks. With 
a few exceptions, the focus here is the analysis of transient responses 
at 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming, with simulations of short-term 
stabilization scenarios (Section 3.2) also assessed in some cases. In 
general, long-term equilibrium stabilization responses could not be 
183

Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems

assessed owing to a lack of data and analysis. A detailed analysis of 
detection and attribution is not provided but will be the focus of the next 
IPCC assessment report (AR6). Furthermore, possible interventions in 
the climate system through radiation modification measures, which are 
not tied to reductions of greenhouse gas emissions or concentrations, 
are not assessed in this chapter.
Understanding the observed impacts and projected risks of climate 
change is crucial to comprehending how the world is likely to change 
under global warming of 1.5°C above temperatures in the pre-industrial 
period (with reference to 2°C). Section 3.4 explores the new literature 
and updates the assessment of impacts and projected risks for a large 
number of natural and human systems. By also exploring adaptation 
opportunities, where the literature allows, the section prepares the 
reader for discussions in subsequent chapters about opportunities to 
tackle both mitigation and adaptation. The section is mostly globally 
focused because of limited research on regional risks and adaptation 
options at 1.5°C and 2°C. For example, the risks of 1.5°C and 2°C of 
warming in urban areas, as well as the risks of health outcomes under 
these two warming scenarios (e.g. climate-related diseases, air quality 
impacts and mental health problems), were not considered because 
of a lack of projections of how these risks might change in a 1.5°C or 
2°C warmer world. In addition, the complexity of many interactions 
of climate change with drivers of poverty, along with a paucity of 
relevant studies, meant it was not possible to detect and attribute 
many dimensions of poverty and disadvantage to climate change. Even 
though there is increasing documentation of climate-related impacts on 
places where indigenous people live and where subsistence-oriented 
communities are found, relevant projections of the risks associated 
with warming of 1.5°C and 2°C are necessarily limited. 
To explore avoided impacts and reduced risks at 1.5°C compared with 
at 2°C of global warming, the chapter adopts the AR5 ‘Reasons for 
Concern’ aggregated projected risk framework (Section 3.5). Updates 
in terms of the aggregation of risks are informed by the most recent 
literature and the assessments offered in Sections 3.3 and 3.4, with 
a focus on the impacts at 2°C of warming that could potentially be 
avoided if warming were constrained to 1.5°C. Economic benefits that 
would be obtained (Section 3.5.3), climate change ‘hotspots’ that could 
be avoided or reduced (Section 3.5.4 as guided by the assessments of 
Sections 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5), and tipping points that could be circumvented 
(Section 3.5.5) at 1.5°C compared to higher degrees of global warming 
are all examined. The latter assessments are, however, constrained to 
regional analyses, and hence this particular section does not include an 
assessment of specific losses and damages. 
Section 3.6 provides an overview on specific aspects of the mitigation 
pathways considered compatible with 1.5°C of global warming, 
including some scenarios involving temperature overshoot above 
1.5°C global warming during the 21st century. Non-CO2 implications 
and projected risks of mitigation pathways, such as changes to land 
use and atmospheric compounds, are presented and explored. Finally, 
implications for sea ice, sea level and permafrost beyond the end of the 
century are assessed.
The exhaustive assessment of literature specific to global warming 
of 1.5°C above the pre-industrial period, presented across all the 
sections in Chapter 3, highlights knowledge gaps resulting from the 
heterogeneous information available across systems, regions and 
sectors. Some of these gaps are described in Section 3.7.
3.2 
How are Risks at 1.5°C and 
Higher Levels of Global Warming 
Assessed in this Chapter?
The methods that are applied for assessing observed and projected 
changes in climate and weather are presented in Section 3.2.1, while 
those used for assessing the observed impacts on and projected risks to 
natural and managed systems, and to human settlements, are described 
in Section 3.2.2. Given that changes in climate associated with 1.5°C 
of global warming were not the focus of past IPCC reports, dedicated 
approaches based on recent literature that are specific to the present 
report are also described. Background on specific methodological 
aspects (climate model simulations available for assessments at 1.5°C 
global warming, attribution of observed changes in climate and their 
relevance for assessing projected changes at 1.5°C and 2°C global 
warming, and the propagation of uncertainties from climate forcing 
to impacts on ecosystems) are provided in the Supplementary Material 
3.SM.
3.2.1 
How are Changes in Climate and Weather at 1.5°C 
versus Higher Levels of Warming Assessed?
Evidence for the assessment of changes to climate at 1.5°C versus 
2°C can be drawn both from observations and model projections. 
Global mean surface temperature (GMST) anomalies were about 
+0.87°C (±0.10°C likely range) above pre-industrial industrial (1850–
1900) values in the 2006-–2015 decade, with a recent warming 
of about 0.2°C (±0.10°C) per decade (Chapter 1). Human-induced 
global warming reached approximately 1°C (±0.2°C likely range) in 
2017 (Chapter 1). While some of the observed trends may be due 
to internal climate variability, methods of detection and attribution 
can be applied to assess which part of the observed changes may be 
attributed to anthropogenic forcing (Bindoff et al., 2013b). Hence, 
evidence from attribution studies can be used to assess changes 
in the climate system that are already detectable at lower levels of 
global warming and would thus continue to change with a further 
0.5°C or 1°C of global warming (see Supplementary Material 3.SM.1 
and Sections 3.3.1, 3.3.2, 3.3.3, 3.3.4 and 3.3.11). A recent study 
identified significant changes in extremes for a 0.5°C difference in 
global warming based on the historical record (Schleussner et al., 
2017). It should also be noted that attributed changes in extremes 
since 1950 that were reported in the IPCC AR5 report (IPCC, 2013) 
generally correspond to changes in global warming of about 0.5°C 
(see 3.SM.1)
Climate model simulations are necessary for the investigation of 
the response of the climate system to various forcings, in particular 
to forcings associated with higher levels of greenhouse gas 
concentrations. Model simulations include experiments with global 
and regional climate models, as well as impact models – driven with 
output from climate models – to evaluate the risk related to climate 
184
Chapter 3 
Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems

change for natural and human systems (Supplementary Material 
3.SM.1). Climate model simulations were generally used in the context 
of particular ‘climate scenarios’ from previous IPCC reports (e.g., 
IPCC, 2007, 2013). This means that emissions scenarios (IPCC, 2000) 
were used to drive climate models, providing different projections 
for given emissions pathways. The results were consequently used in 
a ‘storyline’ framework, which presents the development of climate 
in the course of the 21st century and beyond for a given emissions 
pathway. Results were assessed for different time slices within the 
model projections such as 2016–2035 (‘near term’, which is slightly 
below a global warming of 1.5°C according to most scenarios, Kirtman 
et al., 2013), 2046–2065 (mid-21st century, Collins et al., 2013), and 
2081–2100 (end of 21st century, Collins et al., 2013). Given that this 
report focuses on climate change for a given mean global temperature 
response (1.5°C or 2°C), methods of analysis had to be developed and/
or adapted from previous studies in order to provide assessments for 
the specific purposes here. 
A major challenge in assessing climate change under 1.5°C, or 2°C 
(and higher levels), of global warming pertains to the definition of 
a ‘1.5°C or 2°C climate projection’ (see also Cross-Chapter Box 
8 in this chapter). Resolving this challenge includes the following 
considerations:
A. The need to distinguish between (i) transient climate responses 
 
(i.e., those that ‘pass through’ 1.5°C or 2°C of global warming),  
 
(ii) short-term stabilization responses (i.e., scenarios for the late  
 
21st century that result in stabilization at a mean global warming  
 
of 1.5°C or 2°C by 2100), and (iii) long-term equilibrium  
 
stabilization responses (i.e., those occurring after several  
 
millennia once climate (temperature) equilibrium at 1.5°C or 2°C  
 
is reached). These responses can be very different in terms of  
 
climate variables and the inertia associated with a given climate  
 
forcing. A striking example is sea level rise (SLR). In this case,  
 
projected increases within the 21st century are minimally  
 
dependent on the scenario considered, yet they stabilize at very  
 
different levels for a long-term warming of 1.5°C versus 2°C  
 
(Section 3.3.9). 
B. 
The ‘1.5°C or 2°C emissions scenarios’ presented in Chapter  
 
2 are targeted to hold warming below 1.5°C or 2°C with a certain  
 
probability (generally two-thirds) over the course, or at the  
 
end, of the 21st century. These scenarios should be seen as the  
 
operationalization of 1.5°C or 2°C warmer worlds. However,  
 
when these emission scenarios are used to drive climate models,  
 
some of the resulting simulations lead to warming above these  
 
respective thresholds (typically with a probability of one-third, see  
 
Chapter 2 and Cross-Chapter Box 8 in this chapter). This is due 
 
both to discrepancies between models and to internal climate  
 
variability. For this reason, the climate outcome for any of these  
 
scenarios, even those excluding an overshoot (see next point, C.),  
 
include some probability of reaching a global climate warming  
 
of more than 1.5°C or 2°C. Hence, a comprehensive assessment  
 
of climate risks associated with ‘1.5°C or 2°C climate scenarios’  
 
needs to include consideration of higher levels of warming (e.g.,  
 
up to 2.5°C to 3°C, see Chapter 2 and Cross-Chapter Box 8 in this  
 
chapter).
C. 
Most of the ‘1.5°C scenarios’, and some of the ‘2°C emissions  
 
scenarios’ presented in Chapter 2 include a temperature  
 
overshoot during the course of the 21st century. This means that  
 
median temperature projections under these scenarios exceed 
 
the target warming levels over the course of the century (typically  
 
0.5°C–1°C higher than the respective target levels at most),  
 
before warming returns to below 1.5°C or 2°C by 2100. During  
 
the overshoot phase, impacts would therefore correspond to  
 
higher transient temperature increases than 1.5°C or 2°C. For this  
 
reason, impacts of transient responses at these higher warming  
 
levels are also partly addressed in Cross-Chapter Box 8 in this  
 
chapter (on a 1.5°C warmer world), and some analyses for  
 
changes in extremes are also presented for higher levels of  
 
warming in Section 3.3 (Figures 3.5, 3.6, 3.9, 3.10, 3.12 and 3.13).  
 
Most importantly, different overshoot scenarios may have very  
 
distinct impacts depending on (i) the peak temperature of  
 
the overshoot, (ii) the length of the overshoot period, and (iii) the  
 
associated rate of change in global temperature over the  
 
time period of the overshoot. While some of these issues are  
 
briefly addressed in Sections 3.3 and 3.6, and in the Cross-Chapter  
 
Box 8, the definition of overshoot and related questions will need  
 
to be more comprehensively addressed in the IPCC AR6 report.
D. 
The levels of global warming that are the focus of this report  
 
(1.5°C and 2°C) are measured relative to the pre-industrial period.  
 
This definition requires an agreement on the exact reference time  
 
period (for 0°C of warming) and the time frame over which the 
 
global warming is assessed, typically 20 to 30 years in length. As  
 
discussed in Chapter 1, a climate with 1.5°C global warming is  
 
one in which temperatures averaged over a multi-decade time  
 
scale are 1.5°C above those in the pre-industrial reference period.  
 
Greater detail is provided in Cross-Chapter Box 8 in this chapter.  
 
Inherent to this is the observation that the mean temperature of  
 
a ‘1.5°C warmer world’ can be regionally and temporally much  
 
higher (e.g., with regional annual temperature extremes involving  
 
warming of more than 6°C; see Section 3.3 and Cross-Chapter  
 
Box 8 in this chapter).
E. 
The interference of factors unrelated to greenhouse gases with  
 
mitigation pathways can strongly affect regional climate. For  
 
example, biophysical feedbacks from changes in land use and  
 
irrigation (e.g., Hirsch et al., 2017; Thiery et al., 2017), or projected  
 
changes in short-lived pollutants (e.g., Z. Wang et al., 2017), can  
 
have large influences on local temperatures and climate  
 
conditions. While these effects are not explicitly integrated into the  
 
scenarios developed in Chapter 2, they may affect projected  
 
changes in climate under 1.5°C of global warming. These issues  
 
are addressed in more detail in Section 3.6.2.2.
The assessment presented in the current chapter largely focuses on 
the analysis of transient responses in climate at 1.5°C versus 2°C 
and higher levels of global warming (see point A. above and Section 
3.3). It generally uses the empirical scaling relationship (ESR) approach 
(Seneviratne et al., 2018c), also termed the ‘time sampling’ approach 
(James et al., 2017), which consists of sampling the response at 1.5°C 
and other levels of global warming from all available global climate 
model scenarios for the 21st century (e.g., Schleussner et al., 2016b; 
185
3
Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems 
Chapter 3
Seneviratne et al., 2016; Wartenburger et al., 2017). The ESR approach 
focuses more on the derivation of a continuous relationship, while 
the term ‘time sampling’ is more commonly used when comparing a 
limited number of warming levels (e.g., 1.5°C versus 2°C). A similar 
approach in the case of regional climate model (RCM) simulations 
consists of sampling the RCM model output corresponding to the 
time frame at which the driving general circulation model (GCM) 
reaches the considered temperature level, for example, as done within 
IMPACT2C (Jacob and Solman, 2017), see description in Vautard et 
al. (2014). As an alternative to the ESR or time sampling approach, 
pattern scaling may be used. Pattern scaling is a statistical approach 
that describes relationships of specific climate responses as a function 
of global temperature change. Some assessments presented in this 
chapter are based on this method. The disadvantage of pattern scaling, 
however, is that the relationship may not perfectly emulate the models’ 
responses at each location and for each global temperature level 
(James et al., 2017). Expert judgement is a third methodology that can 
be used to assess probable changes at 1.5°C or 2°C of global warming 
by combining changes that have been attributed to the observed time 
period (corresponding to warming of 1°C or less if assessed over a 
shorter period) with known projected changes at 3°C or 4°C above 
pre-industrial temperatures (Supplementary Material 3.SM.1). In order 
to assess effects induced by a 0.5°C difference in global warming, 
the historical record can be used at first approximation as a proxy, 
meaning that conditions are compared for two periods that have a 
0.5°C difference in GMST warming (such as 1991–2010 and 1960–
1979, e.g., Schleussner et al., 2017). This in particular also applies to 
attributed changes in extremes since 1950 that were reported in the 
IPCC AR5 report (IPCC, 2013; see also 3.SM.1). Using observations, 
however, it is not possible to account for potential non-linear changes 
that could occur above 1°C of global warming or as 1.5°C of warming 
is reached.
In some cases, assessments of short-term stabilization responses 
are also presented, derived using a subset of model simulations that 
reach a given temperature limit by 2100, or driven by sea surface 
temperature (SST) values consistent with such scenarios. This includes 
new results from the ‘Half a degree additional warming, prognosis and 
projected impacts’ (HAPPI) project (Section 1.5.2; Mitchell et al., 2017). 
Notably, there is evidence that for some variables (e.g., temperature 
and precipitation extremes), responses after short-term stabilization 
(i.e., approximately equivalent to the RCP2.6 scenario) are very similar 
to the transient response of higher-emissions scenarios (Seneviratne et 
al., 2016, 2018c; Wartenburger et al., 2017; Tebaldi and Knutti, 2018). 
This is, however, less the case for mean precipitation (e.g., Pendergrass 
et al., 2015), for which other aspects of the emissions scenarios appear 
relevant.
For the assessment of long-term equilibrium stabilization responses, 
this chapter uses results from existing simulations where available 
(e.g., for sea level rise), although the available data for this type of 
projection is limited for many variables and scenarios and will need to 
be addressed in more depth in the IPCC AR6 report.
Supplementary Material 3.SM.1 of this chapter includes further details 
of the climate models and associated simulations that were used to 
support the present assessment, as well as a background on detection 
and attribution approaches of relevance to assessing changes in 
climate at 1.5°C of global warming.
3.2.2 
How are Potential Impacts on Ecosystems Assessed 
at 1.5°C versus Higher Levels of Warming?
Considering that the impacts observed so far are for a global warming 
lower than 1.5°C (generally up to the 2006–2015 decade, i.e., for a 
global warming of 0.87°C or less; see above), direct information on 
the impacts of a global warming of 1.5°C is not yet available. The 
global distribution of observed impacts shown in AR5 (Cramer et al., 
2014), however, demonstrates that methodologies now exist which 
are capable of detecting impacts on systems strongly influenced by 
factors (e.g., urbanization and human pressure in general) or where 
climate may play only a secondary role in driving impacts. Attribution 
of observed impacts to greenhouse gas forcing is more rarely 
performed, but a recent study (Hansen and Stone, 2016) shows that 
most of the detected temperature-related impacts that were reported 
in AR5 (Cramer et al., 2014) can be attributed to anthropogenic climate 
change, while the signals for precipitation-induced responses are more 
ambiguous.
One simple approach for assessing possible impacts on natural and 
managed systems at 1.5°C versus 2°C consists of identifying impacts of 
a global 0.5°C of warming in the observational record (e.g., Schleussner 
et al., 2017) assuming that the impacts would scale linearly for higher 
levels of warming (although this may not be appropriate). Another 
approach is to use conclusions from analyses of past climates combined 
with modelling of the relationships between climate drivers and natural 
systems (Box 3.3). A more complex approach relies on laboratory or 
field experiments (Dove et al., 2013; Bonal et al., 2016), which provide 
useful information on the causal effect of a few factors, which can be 
as diverse as climate, greenhouse gases (GHG), management practices, 
and biological and ecological variables, on specific natural systems that 
may have unusual physical and chemical characteristics (e.g., Fabricius 
et al., 2011; Allen et al., 2017). This last approach can be important 
in helping to develop and calibrate impact mechanisms and models 
through empirical experimentation and observation. 
Risks for natural and human systems are often assessed with 
impact models where climate inputs are provided by representative 
concentration pathway (RCP)-based climate projections. The number 
of studies projecting impacts at 1.5°C or 2°C of global warming 
has increased in recent times (see Section 3.4), even if the four RCP 
scenarios used in AR5 are not strictly associated with these levels 
of global warming. Several approaches have been used to extract 
the required climate scenarios, as described in Section 3.2.1. As an 
example, Schleussner et al. (2016b) applied a time sampling (or ESR) 
approach, described in Section 3.2.1, to estimate the differential effect 
of 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming on water availability and impacts 
on agriculture using an ensemble of simulations under the RCP8.5 
scenario. As a further example using a different approach, Iizumi et al. 
(2017) derived a 1.5°C scenario from simulations with a crop model 
using an interpolation between the no-change (approximately 2010) 
conditions and the RCP2.6 scenario (with a global warming of 1.8°C in 
2100), and they derived the corresponding 2°C scenario from RCP2.6 
and RCP4.5 simulations in 2100. The Inter-Sectoral Impact Model 
186
Chapter 3 
Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems
3
Integration and Intercomparison Project Phase 2 (ISIMIP2; Frieler et 
al., 2017) extended this approach to investigate a number of sectoral 
impacts on terrestrial and marine ecosystems. In most cases, risks are 
assessed by impact models coupled offline to climate models after bias 
correction, which may modify long-term trends (Grillakis et al., 2017). 
Assessment of local impacts of climate change necessarily involves 
a change in scale, such as from the global scale to that of natural 
or human systems (Frieler et al., 2017; Reyer et al., 2017d; Jacob et 
al., 2018). An appropriate method of downscaling (Supplementary 
Material 3.SM.1) is crucial for translating perspectives on 1.5°C and 
2°C of global warming to scales and impacts relevant to humans and 
ecosystems. A major challenge associated with this requirement is 
the correct reproduction of the variance of local to regional changes, 
as well as the frequency and amplitude of extreme events (Vautard 
et al., 2014). In addition, maintaining physical consistency between 
downscaled variables is important but challenging (Frost et al., 2011).
Another major challenge relates to the propagation of the uncertainties 
at each step of the methodology, from the global forcings to the global 
climate and from regional climate to impacts at the ecosystem level, 
considering local disturbances and local policy effects. The risks for 
natural and human systems are the result of complex combinations of 
global and local drivers, which makes quantitative uncertainty analysis 
difficult. Such analyses are partly done using multimodel approaches, 
such as multi-climate and multi-impact models (Warszawski et al., 
2013, 2014; Frieler et al., 2017). In the case of crop projections, for 
example, the majority of the uncertainty is caused by variation among 
crop models rather than by downscaling outputs of the climate models 
used (Asseng et al., 2013). Error propagation is an important issue 
for coupled models. Dealing correctly with uncertainties in a robust 
probabilistic model is particularly important when considering the 
potential for relatively small changes to affect the already small signal 
associated with 0.5°C of global warming (Supplementary Material 
3.SM.1). The computation of an impact per unit of climatic change, 
based either on models or on data, is a simple way to present the 
probabilistic ecosystem response while taking into account the various 
sources of uncertainties (Fronzek et al., 2011). 
In summary, in order to assess risks at 1.5°C and higher levels of 
global warming, several things need to be considered. Projected 
climates under 1.5°C of global warming differ depending on temporal 
aspects and emission pathways. Considerations include whether global 
temperature is (i) temporarily at this level (i.e., is a transient phase on its 
way to higher levels of warming), (ii) arrives at 1.5°C, with or without 
overshoot, after stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations, or (iii) 
is at this level as part of long-term climate equilibrium (complete only 
after several millennia). Assessments of impacts of 1.5°C of warming 
are generally based on climate simulations for these different possible 
pathways. Most existing data and analyses focus on transient impacts 
(i). Fewer data are available for dedicated climate model simulations 
that are able to assess pathways consistent with (ii), and very few data 
are available for the assessment of changes at climate equilibrium (iii). 
In some cases, inferences regarding the impacts of further warming of 
0.5°C above present-day temperatures (i.e., 1.5°C of global warming) 
can also be drawn from observations of similar sized changes (0.5°C) 
that have occurred in the past, such as during the last 50 years. 
However, impacts can only be partly inferred from these types of 
observations, given the strong possibility of non-linear changes, as well 
as lag effects for some climate variables (e.g., sea level rise, snow and 
ice melt). For the impact models, three challenges are noted about the 
coupling procedure: (i) the bias correction of the climate model, which 
may modify the simulated response of the ecosystem, (ii) the necessity 
to downscale the climate model outputs to reach a pertinent scale for 
the ecosystem without losing physical consistency of the downscaled 
climate fields, and (iii) the necessity to develop an integrated study of 
the uncertainties. 
3.3 
Global and Regional Climate 
Changes and Associated Hazards
This section provides the assessment of changes in climate at 
1.5°C of global warming relative to changes at higher global mean 
temperatures. Section 3.3.1 provides a brief overview of changes to 
global climate. Sections 3.3.2–3.3.11 provide assessments for specific 
aspects of the climate system, including regional assessments for 
temperature (Section 3.3.2) and precipitation (Section 3.3.3) means 
and extremes. Analyses of regional changes are based on the set of 
regions displayed in Figure 3.2. A synthesis of the main conclusions 
of this section is provided in Section 3.3.11. The section builds upon 
assessments from the IPCC AR5 WGI report (Bindoff et al., 2013a; 
Christensen et al., 2013; Collins et al., 2013; Hartmann et al., 2013; 
IPCC, 2013) and Chapter 3 of the IPCC Special Report on Managing 
the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change 
Adaptation (SREX; Seneviratne et al., 2012), as well as a substantial 
body of new literature related to projections of climate at 1.5°C and 2°C 
of warming above the pre-industrial period (e.g., Vautard et al., 2014; 
Fischer and Knutti, 2015; Schleussner et al., 2016b, 2017; Seneviratne 
et al., 2016, 2018c; Déqué et al., 2017; Maule et al., 2017; Mitchell et 
al., 2017, 2018a; Wartenburger et al., 2017; Zaman et al., 2017; Betts et 
al., 2018; Jacob et al., 2018; Kharin et al., 2018; Wehner et al., 2018b). 
The main assessment methods are as already detailed in Section 3.2. 
3.3.1 
Global Changes in Climate
There is high confidence that the increase in global mean surface 
temperature (GMST) has reached 0.87°C (±0.10°C likely range) 
above pre-industrial values in the 2006–2015 decade (Chapter 1). 
AR5 assessed that the globally averaged temperature (combined 
over land and ocean) displayed a warming of about 0.85°C [0.65°C 
to 1.06°C] during the period 1880–2012, with a large fraction of the 
detected global warming being attributed to anthropogenic forcing 
(Bindoff et al., 2013a; Hartmann et al., 2013; Stocker et al., 2013). 
While new evidence has highlighted that sampling biases and the 
choice of approaches used to estimate GMST (e.g., using water 
versus air temperature over oceans and using model simulations 
versus observations-based estimates) can affect estimates of GMST 
increase (Richardson et al., 2016; see also Supplementary Material 
3.SM.2), the present assessment is consistent with that of AR5 
regarding a detectable and dominant effect of anthropogenic forcing 
on observed trends in global temperature (also confirmed in Ribes 
et al., 2017). As highlighted in Chapter 1, human-induced warming 
187

Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems 
Chapter 3
reached approximately 1°C (±0.2°C likely range) in 2017. More 
background on recent observed trends in global climate is provided 
in the Supplementary Material 3.SM.2.
A global warming of 1.5°C implies higher mean temperatures 
compared to during pre-industrial times in almost all locations, both 
on land and in oceans (high confidence) (Figure 3.3). In addition, 
a global warming of 2°C versus 1.5°C results in robust differences 
in the mean temperatures in almost all locations, both on land and 
in the ocean (high confidence). The land–sea contrast in warming 
is important and implies particularly large changes in temperature 
over land, with mean warming of more than 1.5°C in most land 
regions (high confidence; see Section 3.3.2 for more details). The 
largest increase in mean temperature is found in the high latitudes 
of the Northern Hemisphere (high confidence; Figure 3.3, see Section 
3.3.2 for more details). Projections for precipitation are more 
uncertain, but they highlight robust increases in mean precipitation 
in the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes at 1.5°C global warming 
versus pre-industrial conditions, as well as at 2°C global warming 
versus pre-industrial conditions (high confidence) (Figure 3.3). There 
are consistent but less robust signals when comparing changes in 
mean precipitation at 2°C versus 1.5°C of global warming. Hence, 
it is assessed that there is medium confidence in an increase of 
mean precipitation in high-latitudes at 2°C versus 1.5°C of global 
warming (Figure 3.3). For droughts, changes in evapotranspiration 
and precipitation timing are also relevant (see Section 3.3.4). Figure 
3.4 displays changes in temperature extremes (the hottest daytime 
temperature of the year, TXx, and the coldest night-time temperature 
of the year, TNn) and heavy precipitation (the annual maximum 
5-day precipitation, Rx5day). These analyses reveal distinct patterns 
of changes, with the largest changes in TXx occurring on mid-latitude 
land and the largest changes in TNn occurring at high latitudes 
(both on land and in oceans). Differences in TXx and TNn compared 
to pre-industrial climate are robust at both global warming levels. 
Differences in TXx and TNn at 2°C versus 1.5°C of global warming 
are robust across most of the globe. Changes in heavy precipitation

are less robust, but particularly strong increases are apparent at high 
latitudes as well as in the tropics at both 1.5°C and 2°C of global 
warming compared to pre-industrial conditions. The differences in 
heavy precipitation at 2°C versus 1.5°C global warming are generally 
not robust at grid-cell scale, but they display consistent increases in 
most locations (Figure 3.4). However, as addressed in Section 3.3.3, 
statistically significant differences are found in several large regions and 
when aggregated over the global land area. We thus assess that there 
is high confidence regarding global-scale differences in temperature 
means and extremes at 2°C versus 1.5°C global warming, and medium 
confidence regarding global-scale differences in precipitation means 
and extremes. Further analyses, including differences at 1.5°C and 2°C 
global warming versus 1°C (i.e., present-day) conditions are provided 
in the Supplementary Material 3.SM.2.
These projected changes at 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming are 
consistent with the attribution of observed historical global trends 
in temperature and precipitation means and extremes (Bindoff et al., 
2013a), as well as with some observed changes under the recent 
global warming of 0.5°C (Schleussner et al., 2017). These comparisons 
are addressed in more detail in Sections 3.3.2 and 3.3.3. Attribution 
studies have shown that there is high confidence that anthropogenic 
forcing has had a detectable influence on trends in global warming 
(virtually certain since the mid-20th century), in land warming on 
all continents except Antarctica (likely since the mid-20th century), 
in ocean warming since 1970 (very likely), and in increases in hot 
extremes and decreases in cold extremes since the mid-20th century 
(very likely) (Bindoff et al., 2013a). In addition, there is medium 
confidence that anthropogenic forcing has contributed to increases 
in mean precipitation at high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere 
since the mid-20th century and to global-scale increases in heavy 
precipitation in land regions with sufficient observations over the 
same period (Bindoff et al., 2013a). Schleussner et al. (2017) showed, 
through analyses of recent observed tendencies, that changes in 
temperature extremes and heavy precipitation indices are detectable 
in observations for the 1991–2010 period compared with those 
for 1960–1979, with a global warming of approximately 0.5°C 
occurring between these two periods (high confidence). The observed 
tendencies over that time frame are thus consistent with attributed 
changes since the mid-20th century (high confidence).
The next sections assess changes in several different types of climate-
related hazards. It should be noted that the different types of hazards 
are considered in isolation but some regions are projected to be 
affected by collocated and/or concomitant changes in several types 
of hazards (high confidence). Two examples are sea level rise and 
heavy precipitation in some regions, possibly leading together to more 
flooding, and droughts and heatwaves, which can together increase 
the risk of fire occurrence. Such events, also called compound events, 
may substantially increase risks in some regions (e.g., AghaKouchak et 
al., 2014; Van Den Hurk et al., 2015; Martius et al., 2016; Zscheischler 
et al., 2018). A detailed assessment of physically-defined compound 
events was not possible as part of this report, but aspects related to 
overlapping multi-sector risks are highlighted in Sections 3.4 and 3.5.

3.3.2 
Regional Temperatures on Land, Including Extremes
3.3.2.1 Observed and attributed changes in regional 
temperature means and extremes
While the quality of temperature measurements obtained through 
ground observational networks tends to be high compared to that of 
measurements for other climate variables (Seneviratne et al., 2012), 
it should be noted that some regions are undersampled. Cowtan and 
Way (2014) highlighted issues regarding undersampling, which is 
most problematic at the poles and over Africa, and which may lead 
to biases in estimated changes in GMST (see also Supplementary 
Material 3.SM.2 and Chapter 1). This undersampling also affects the 
confidence of assessments regarding regional observed and projected 
changes in both mean and extreme temperature. Despite this partly 
limited coverage, the attribution chapter of AR5 (Bindoff et al., 2013a) 
and recent papers (e.g., Sun et al., 2016; Wan et al., 2018) assessed 
that, over every continental region and in many sub-continental 
regions, anthropogenic influence has made a substantial contribution 
to surface temperature increases since the mid-20th century.
Based on the AR5 and SREX, as well as recent literature (see 
Supplementary Material 3.SM), there is high confidence (very likely) 
that there has been an overall decrease in the number of cold days 
and nights and an overall increase in the number of warm days and 
nights at the global scale on land. There is also high confidence (likely) 
that consistent changes are detectable on the continental scale in 
North America, Europe and Australia. There is high confidence that 
these observed changes in temperature extremes can be attributed to 
anthropogenic forcing (Bindoff et al., 2013a). As highlighted in Section 
3.2, the observational record can be used to assess past changes 
associated with a global warming of 0.5°C. Schleussner et al. (2017) 
used this approach to assess observed changes in extreme indices for 
the 1991–2010 versus the 1960–1979 period, which corresponds to 
just about a 0.5°C GMST difference in the observed record (based on 
the Goddard Institute for Space Studies Surface Temperature Analysis 
190
Chapter 3 
Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems
3
(GISTEMP) dataset, Hansen et al., 2010). They found that substantial 
changes due to 0.5°C of warming are apparent for indices related to 
hot and cold extremes, as well as for the Warm Spell Duration Indicator 
(WSDI). In particular, they identified that one-quarter of the land has 
experienced an intensification of hot extremes (maximum temperature 
on the hottest day of the year, TXx) by more than 1°C and a reduction in 
the intensity of cold extremes by at least 2.5°C (minimum temperature 
on the coldest night of the year, TNn). In addition, the same study 
showed that half of the global land mass has experienced changes 
in WSDI of more than six days, as well as an emergence of extremes 
outside the range of natural variability (Schleussner et al., 2017). 
Analyses from Schleussner et al. (2017) for temperature extremes are 
provided in the Supplementary Material 3.SM, Figure 3.SM.6. It should 
be noted that assessments of attributed changes in the IPCC SREX and 
AR5 reports were generally provided since 1950, for time frames also 
approximately corresponding to a 0.5°C global warming (3.SM).
3.3.2.2 Projected changes in regional temperature means and 
extremes at 1.5°C versus 2°C of global warming
There are several lines of evidence available for providing a regional 
assessment of projected changes in temperature means and extremes 
at 1.5°C versus 2°C of global warming (see Section 3.2). These include: 
analyses of changes in extremes as a function of global warming based 
on existing climate simulations using the empirical scaling relationship 
(ESR) and variations thereof (e.g., Schleussner et al., 2017; Dosio and 
Fischer, 2018; Seneviratne et al., 2018c; see Section 3.2 for details about 
the methodology); dedicated simulations of 1.5°C versus 2°C of global 
warming, for instance based on the Half a degree additional warming, 
prognosis and projected impacts (HAPPI) experiment (Mitchell et al., 
2017) or other model simulations (e.g., Dosio et al., 2018; Kjellström et 
al., 2018); and analyses based on statistical pattern scaling approaches 
(e.g., Kharin et al., 2018). These different lines of evidence lead to 
qualitatively consistent results regarding changes in temperature 
means and extremes at 1.5°C of global warming compared to the pre-
industrial climate and 2°C of global warming. 
There are statistically significant differences in temperature means and 
extremes at 1.5°C versus 2°C of global warming, both in the global 
average (Schleussner et al., 2016b; Dosio et al., 2018; Kharin et al., 
2018), as well as in most land regions (high confidence) (Wartenburger 
et al., 2017; Seneviratne et al., 2018c; Wehner et al., 2018b). Projected 
temperatures over oceans display significant increases in means and 
extremes between 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming (Figures 3.3 and 
3.4). A general background on the available evidence on regional 
changes in temperature means and extremes at 1.5°C versus 2°C of 
global warming is provided in the Supplementary Material 3.SM.2. As 
an example, Figure 3.5 shows regionally-based analyses for the IPCC 
SREX regions (see Figure 3.2) of changes in the temperature of hot 
extremes as a function of global warming (corresponding analyses 
for changes in the temperature of cold extremes are provided in the 
Supplementary Material 3.SM.2). As demonstrated in these analyses, 
the mean response of the intensity of temperature extremes in climate 
models to changes in the global mean temperature is approximately 
linear and independent of the considered emissions scenario 
(Seneviratne et al., 2016; Wartenburger et al., 2017). Nonetheless, in 
the case of changes in the number of days exceeding a given threshold, 
changes are approximately exponential, with higher increases for rare 
events (Fischer and Knutti, 2015; Kharin et al., 2018); see also Figure 
3.6. This behaviour is consistent with a linear increase in absolute 
temperature for extreme threshold exceedances (Whan et al., 2015). 
As mentioned in Section 3.3.1, there is an important land–sea warming 
contrast, with stronger warming on land (see also Christensen et al., 
2013; Collins et al., 2013; Seneviratne et al., 2016), which implies that 
regional warming on land is generally more than 1.5°C even when 
mean global warming is at 1.5°C. As highlighted in Seneviratne et al. 
(2016), this feature is generally stronger for temperature extremes 
(Figures 3.4 and 3.5; Supplementary Material 3.SM.2 ). For differences 
in regional temperature extremes at a mean global warming of 1.5°C 
versus 2°C, that is, a difference of 0.5°C in global warming, this implies 
differences of as much as 1°C–1.5°C in some locations, which are two 
to three times larger than the differences in global mean temperature. 
For hot extremes, the strongest warming is found in central and eastern 
North America, central and southern Europe, the Mediterranean, 
western and central Asia, and southern Africa (Figures 3.4 and 3.5) 
(medium confidence). These regions are all characterized by a strong 
soil-moisture–temperature coupling and projected increased dryness 
(Vogel et al., 2017), which leads to a reduction in evaporative cooling 
in the projections. Some of these regions also show a wide range of 
responses to temperature extremes, in particular central Europe and 
central North America, owing to discrepancies in the representation of 
the underlying processes in current climate models (Vogel et al., 2017). 
For mean temperature and cold extremes, the strongest warming is 
found in the northern high-latitude regions (high confidence). This is 
due to substantial ice-snow-albedo-temperature feedbacks (Figure 
3.3 and Figure 3.4, middle) related to the known ‘polar amplification’ 
mechanism (e.g., IPCC, 2013; Masson-Delmotte et al., 2013).
Figure 3.7 displays maps of changes in the number of hot days 
(NHD) at 1.5°C and 2°C of GMST increase. Maps of changes in the 
number of frost days (FD) can be found in Supplementary Material 
3.SM.2. These analyses reveal clear patterns of changes between the 
two warming levels, which are consistent with analysed changes in 
heatwave occurrence (e.g., Dosio et al., 2018). For the NHD, the largest 
differences are found in the tropics (high confidence), owing to the 
low interannual temperature variability there (Mahlstein et al., 2011), 
although absolute changes in hot temperature extremes tended to 
be largest at mid-latitudes (high confidence) (Figures 3.4 and 3.5). 
Extreme heatwaves are thus projected to emerge earliest in the tropics 
and to become widespread in these regions already at 1.5°C of global 
warming (high confidence). These results are consistent with other 
recent assessments. Coumou and Robinson (2013) found that 20% 
of the global land area, centred in low-latitude regions, is projected 
to experience highly unusual monthly temperatures during Northern 
Hemisphere summers at 1.5°C of global warming, with this number 
nearly doubling at 2°C of global warming. 
Figure 3.8 features an objective identification of ‘hotspots’ / key 
risks in temperature indices subdivided by region, based on the ESR 
approach applied to Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 
5 (CMIP5) simulations (Wartenburger et al., 2017). Note that results 
based on the HAPPI multimodel experiment (Mitchell et al., 2017) 
are similar (Seneviratne et al., 2018c). The considered regions follow 
191

Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems 
Chapter 3
the classification used in Figure 3.2 and also include the global land 
areas. Based on these analyses, the following can be stated: significant 
changes in responses are found in all regions for most temperature 
indices, with the exception of i) the diurnal temperature range (DTR) in 
most regions, ii) ice days (ID), frost days (FD) and growing season length 
(GSL) (mostly in regions where differences are zero, because, e.g., there 
are no ice or frost days), iii) the minimum yearly value of the maximum 
daily temperature (TXn) in very few regions. In terms of the sign of 
the changes, warm extremes display an increase in intensity, frequency 
and duration (e.g., an increase in the temperature of the hottest day of 
the year (TXx) in all regions, an increase in the proportion of days with 
a maximum temperature above the 90th percentile of Tmax (TX90p) 
in all regions, and an increase in the length of the WSDI in all regions), 
while cold extremes display a decrease in intensity, frequency and 
duration (e.g., an increase in the temperature of the coldest night of 
the year (TNn) in all regions, a decrease in the proportion of days with 
a minimum temperature below the 10th percentile of Tmin (TN10p), 
and a decrease in the cold spell duration index (CSDI) in all regions). 
Hence, while warm extremes are intensified, cold extremes become 
less intense in affected regions.
Overall, large increases in hot extremes occur in many densely 
inhabited regions (Figure 3.5), for both warming scenarios compared 
to pre-industrial and present-day climate, as well as for 2°C versus 
1.5°C GMST warming. For instance, Dosio et al. (2018) concluded, 
based on a modelling study, that 13.8% of the world population would 
be exposed to ‘severe heatwaves’ at least once every 5 years under 
1.5°C of global warming, with a threefold increase (36.9%) under 2°C 
of GMST warming, corresponding to a difference of about 1.7 billion 
people between the two global warming levels. They also concluded 
that limiting global warming to 1.5°C would result in about 420 
million fewer people being frequently exposed to extreme heatwaves, 
and about 65 million fewer people being exposed to ‘exceptional 
heatwaves’ compared to conditions at 2°C GMST warming. However, 
changes in vulnerability were not considered in their study. For this 
reason, we assess that there is medium confidence in their conclusions.
In summary, there is high confidence that there are robust and 
statistically significant differences in the projected temperature means 
and extremes at 1.5°C versus 2°C of global warming, both in the global 
average and in nearly all land regions4 (likely). Further, the observational 
record reveals that substantial changes due to a 0.5°C GMST warming 
are apparent for indices related to hot and cold extremes, as well as for 
the WSDI (likely). A global warming of 2°C versus 1.5°C would lead to 
more frequent and more intense hot extremes in all land regions4, as 
well as longer warm spells, affecting many densely inhabited regions 
(very likely). The strongest increases in the frequency of hot extremes 
are projected for the rarest events (very likely). On the other hand, cold 
extremes would become less intense and less frequent, and cold spells 
would be shorter (very likely). Temperature extremes on land would 
generally increase more than the global average temperature (very 
likely). Temperature increases of extreme hot days in mid-latitudes are 
projected to be up to two times the increase in GMST, that is, 3°C at 
1.5°C GMST warming (high confidence). The highest levels of warming 
for extreme hot days are expected to occur in central and eastern North 
America, central and southern Europe, the Mediterranean, western and 
central Asia, and southern Africa (medium confidence). These regions 
have a strong soil-moisture-temperature coupling in common as well 
as increased dryness and, consequently, a reduction in evaporative 
cooling. However, there is a substantial range in the representation 
of these processes in models, in particular in central Europe and 
central North America (medium confidence). The coldest nights in high 
latitudes warm by as much as 1.5°C for a 0.5°C increase in GMST, 
corresponding to a threefold stronger warming (high confidence). NHD 
shows the largest differences between 1.5°C and 2°C in the tropics, 
because of the low interannual temperature variability there (high 
confidence); extreme heatwaves are thus projected to emerge earliest 
in these regions, and they are expected to become widespread already 
at 1.5°C of global warming (high confidence). Limiting global warming 
to 1.5°C instead of 2°C could result in around 420 million fewer people 
being frequently exposed to extreme heatwaves, and about 65 million 
fewer people being exposed to exceptional heatwaves, assuming 
constant vulnerability (medium confidence).
3.3.3 
Regional Precipitation, Including Heavy 
Precipitation and Monsoons
This section addresses regional changes in precipitation on land, with 
a focus on heavy precipitation and consideration of changes to the key 
features of monsoons.
3.3.3.1 Observed and attributed changes in regional 
precipitation
Observed global changes in the water cycle, including precipitation, 
are more uncertain than observed changes in temperature (Hartmann 
et al., 2013; Stocker et al., 2013). There is high confidence that 
mean precipitation over the mid-latitude land areas of the Northern 
Hemisphere has increased since 1951 (Hartmann et al., 2013). For 
other latitudinal zones, area-averaged long-term positive or negative 
trends have low confidence because of poor data quality, incomplete 
data or disagreement amongst available estimates (Hartmann et al., 
2013). There is, in particular, low confidence regarding observed trends 
in precipitation in monsoon regions, according to the SREX report 
(Seneviratne et al., 2012) and AR5 (Hartmann et al., 2013), as well as 
more recent publications (Singh et al., 2014; Taylor et al., 2017; Bichet 
and Diedhiou, 2018; see Supplementary Material 3.SM.2). 
For heavy precipitation, AR5 (Hartmann et al., 2013) assessed that 
observed trends displayed more areas with increases than decreases in 
the frequency, intensity and/or amount of heavy precipitation (likely). 
In addition, for land regions where observational coverage is sufficient 
for evaluation, it was assessed that there is medium confidence that 
anthropogenic forcing has contributed to a global-scale intensification 
of heavy precipitation over the second half of the 20th century (Bindoff 
et al., 2013a).
Regarding changes in precipitation associated with global warming 
of 0.5°C, the observed record suggests that increases in precipitation 
extremes can be identified for annual maximum 1-day precipitation

(RX1day) and consecutive 5-day precipitation (RX5day) for GMST 
changes of this magnitude (Supplementary Material 3.SM.2, Figure 
3.SM.7; Schleussner et al., 2017). It should be noted that assessments 
of attributed changes in the IPCC SREX and AR5 reports were generally 
provided since 1950, for time frames also approximately corresponding 
to a 0.5°C global warming (3.SM).
3.3.3.2 Projected changes in regional precipitation at 1.5°C 
versus 2°C of global warming
Figure 3.3 in Section 3.3.1 summarizes the projected changes in mean 
precipitation at 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming. Both warming 
levels display robust differences in mean precipitation compared to 
the pre-industrial period. Regarding differences at 2°C vs 1.5°C global 
warming, some regions are projected to display changes in mean 
precipitation at 2°C compared with that at 1.5°C of global warming in 
the CMIP5 multimodel average, such as decreases in the Mediterranean 
area, including southern Europe, the Arabian Peninsula and Egypt, or 
increases in high latitudes. The results, however, are less robust across 
models than for mean temperature. For instance, Déqué et al. (2017) 
investigated the impact of 2°C of global warming on precipitation over 
tropical Africa and found that average precipitation does not show a 
significant response, owing to two phenomena: (i) the number of days 
with rain decreases whereas the precipitation intensity increases, and 
(ii) the rainy season occurs later during the year, with less precipitation 
in early summer and more precipitation in late summer. The results 
from Déqué et al. (2017) regarding insignificant differences between 
1.5°C and 2°C scenarios for tropical Africa are consistent with the 
results presented in Figure 3.3. For Europe, recent studies (Vautard et 
al., 2014; Jacob et al., 2018; Kjellström et al., 2018) have shown that 
2°C of global warming was associated with a robust increase in mean 
precipitation over central and northern Europe in winter but only over 
northern Europe in summer, and with decreases in mean precipitation 
in central/southern Europe in summer. Precipitation changes reaching 
20% have been projected for the 2°C scenario (Vautard et al., 2014) 
and are overall more pronounced than with 1.5°C of global warming 
(Jacob et al., 2018; Kjellström et al., 2018).
Regarding changes in heavy precipitation, Figure 3.9 displays projected 
changes in the 5-day maximum precipitation (Rx5day) as a function 
of global temperature increase, using a similar approach as in Figure 
3.5. Further analyses are available in Supplementary Material 3.SM.2. 
These analyses show that projected changes in heavy precipitation are 
more uncertain than those for temperature extremes. However, the 
mean response of model simulations is generally robust and linear 
(see also Fischer et al., 2014; Seneviratne et al., 2016). As observed for 
temperature extremes, this response is also mostly independent of the 
considered emissions scenario (e.g., RCP2.6 versus RCP8.5; see also 
Section 3.2). This feature appears to be specific to heavy precipitation, 
possibly due to a stronger coupling with temperature, as the scaling of 
projections of mean precipitation changes with global warming shows 
some scenario dependency (Pendergrass et al., 2015).
Robust changes in heavy precipitation compared to pre-industrial 
conditions are found at both 1.5°C and 2°C global warming (Figure 
3.4). This is also consistent with results for, for example, the European 
continent, although different indices for heavy precipitation changes 
have been analysed. Based on regional climate simulations, Vautard 
et al. (2014) found a robust increase in heavy precipitation everywhere 
in Europe and in all seasons, except southern Europe in summer at 2°C 
versus 1971–2000. Their findings are consistent with those of Jacob 
et al. (2014), who used more recent downscaled climate scenarios 
(EURO-CORDEX) and a higher resolution (12 km), but the change 
is not so pronounced in Teichmann et al. (2018). There is consistent 
agreement in the direction of change in heavy precipitation at 1.5°C 
of global warming over much of Europe, compared to 1971–2000 
(Jacob et al., 2018).
Differences in heavy precipitation are generally projected to be 
small between 1.5°C and 2°C GMST warming (Figure 3.4 and 3.9 
and Supplementary Material 3.SM.2, Figure 3.SM.10). Some regions 
display substantial increases, for instance southern Asia, but generally 
in less than two-thirds of the CMIP5 models (Figure 3.4, Supplementary 
Material 3.SM.2, Figure 3.SM.10). Wartenburger et al. (2017) suggested 
that there are substantial differences in heavy precipitation in eastern 
Asia at 1.5°C versus 2°C. Overall, while there is variation among 
regions, the global tendency is for heavy precipitation to increase at 
2°C compared with at 1.5°C (see e.g., Fischer and Knutti, 2015 and 
Kharin et al., 2018, as illustrated in Figure 3.10 from this chapter; see 
also Betts et al., 2018). 
AR5 assessed that the global monsoon, aggregated over all monsoon 
systems, is likely to strengthen, with increases in its area and intensity, 
while the monsoon circulation weakens (Christensen et al., 2013). A 
few publications provide more recent evaluations of projections of 
changes in monsoons for high-emission scenarios (e.g., Jiang and Tian, 
2013; Jones and Carvalho, 2013; Sylla et al., 2015, 2016; Supplementary 
Material 3.SM.2 ). However, scenarios at 1.5°C or 2°C global warming 
would involve a substantially smaller radiative forcing than those 
assessed in AR5 and these more recent studies, and there appears 
to be no specific assessment of changes in monsoon precipitation at 
1.5°C versus 2°C of global warming in the literature. Consequently, the 
current assessment is that there is low confidence regarding changes 
in monsoons at these lower global warming levels, as well as regarding 
differences in monsoon responses at 1.5°C versus 2°C.
Similar to Figure 3.8, Figure 3.11 features an objective identification of 
‘hotspots’ / key risks outlined in heavy precipitation indices subdivided 
by region, based on the approach by Wartenburger et al. (2017). The 
considered regions follow the classification used in Figure 3.2 and also 
include global land areas. Hotspots displaying statistically significant 
changes in heavy precipitation at 1.5°C versus 2°C global warming 
are located in high-latitude (Alaska/western Canada, eastern Canada/
Greenland/Iceland, northern Europe, northern Asia) and high-elevation 
(e.g., Tibetan Plateau) regions, as well as in eastern Asia (including 
China and Japan) and in eastern North America. Results are less 
consistent for other regions. Note that analyses for meteorological 
drought (lack of precipitation) are provided in Section 3.3.4.
In summary, observations and projections for mean and heavy 
precipitation are less robust than for temperature means and extremes 
(high confidence). Observations show that there are more areas with 
increases than decreases in the frequency, intensity and/or amount of

heavy precipitation (high confidence). Several large regions display 
statistically significant differences in heavy precipitation at 1.5°C 
versus 2°C GMST warming, with stronger increases at 2°C global 
warming, and there is a global tendency towards increases in heavy 
precipitation on land at 2°C compared with 1.5°C warming (high 
confidence). Overall, regions that display statistically significant 
changes in heavy precipitation between 1.5°C and 2°C of global 
warming are located in high latitudes (Alaska/western Canada, eastern 
Canada/Greenland/Iceland, northern Europe, northern Asia) and high 
elevation (e.g., Tibetan Plateau), as well as in eastern Asia (including 
China and Japan) and in eastern North America (medium confidence). 
There is low confidence in projected changes in heavy precipitation in 
other regions.

3.3.4 
Drought and Dryness
3.3.4.1 Observed and attributed changes
The IPCC AR5 assessed that there was low confidence in the sign of 
drought trends since 1950 at the global scale, but that there was high 
confidence in observed trends in some regions of the world, including 
drought increases in the Mediterranean and West Africa and drought 
decreases in central North America and northwest Australia (Hartmann 
et al., 2013; Stocker et al., 2013). AR5 assessed that there was low 
confidence in the attribution of global changes in droughts and did 
not provide assessments for the attribution of regional changes in 
droughts (Bindoff et al., 2013a). 
The recent literature does not suggest that the SREX and AR5 
assessment of drought trends should be revised, except in the 
Mediterranean region. Recent publications based on observational and 
modelling evidence suggest that human emissions have substantially 
increased the probability of drought years in the Mediterranean region 
(Gudmundsson and Seneviratne, 2016; Gudmundsson et al., 2017). 
Based on this evidence, there is medium confidence that enhanced 
greenhouse forcing has contributed to increased drying in the 
Mediterranean region (including southern Europe, northern Africa and 
the Near East) and that this tendency will continue to increase under 
higher levels of global warming.
3.3.4.2 Projected changes in drought and dryness at 1.5°C 
versus 2°C
There is medium confidence in projections of changes in drought 
and dryness. This is partly consistent with AR5, which assessed these 
projections as being ‘likely (medium confidence)’ (Collins et al., 2013; 
Stocker et al., 2013). However, given this medium confidence, the 
current assessment does not include a likelihood statement, thereby 
maintaining consistency with the IPCC uncertainty guidance document 
(Mastrandrea et al., 2010) and the assessment of the IPCC SREX report 
(Seneviratne et al., 2012). The technical summary of AR5 (Stocker et 
al., 2013) assessed that soil moisture drying in the Mediterranean, 
southwestern USA and southern African regions was consistent with 
projected changes in the Hadley circulation and increased surface 
temperatures, and it concluded that there was high confidence 
in likely surface drying in these regions by the end of this century

Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems 
Chapter 3
Box 3.1 |  Sub-Saharan Africa: Changes in Temperature and Precipitation Extremes
Sub-Saharan Africa has experienced the dramatic consequences of climate extremes becoming more frequent and more intense over the 
past decades (Paeth et al., 2010; Taylor et al., 2017). In order to join international efforts to reduce climate change, all African countries 
signed the Paris Agreement. In particular, through their nationally determined contributions (NDCs), they committed to contribute to the 
global effort to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions with the aim to constrain global temperature increases to ‘well below 2°C’ 
and to pursue efforts to limit warming to ‘1.5°C above pre-industrial levels’. The target of limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-
industrial levels is useful for conveying the urgency of the situation. However, it focuses the climate change debate on a temperature 
threshold (Section 3.3.2), while the potential impacts of these global warming levels on key sectors at local to regional scales, such as 
agriculture, energy and health, remain uncertain in most regions and countries of Africa (Sections 3.3.3, 3.3.4, 3.3.5 and 3.3.6).
Weber et al. (2018) found that at regional scales, temperature increases in sub-Saharan Africa are projected to be higher than the global 
mean temperature increase (at global warming of 1.5°C and at 2°C; see Section 3.3.2 for further background and analyses of climate 
model projections). Even if the mean global temperature anomaly is kept below 1.5°C, regions between 15°S and 15°N are projected to 
experience an increase in hot nights, as well as longer and more frequent heatwaves (e.g., Kharin et al., 2018). Increases would be even 
larger if the global mean temperature were to reach 2°C of global warming, with significant changes in the occurrence and intensity of 
temperature extremes in all sub-Saharan regions (Sections 3.3.1 and 3.3.2; Figures 3.4, 3.5 and 3.8).
West and Central Africa are projected to display particularly large increases in the number of hot days, both at 1.5°C and 2°C of global 
warming (Section 3.3.2). This is due to the relatively small interannual present-day variability in this region, which implies that climate-
change signals can be detected earlier there (Section 3.3.2; Mahlstein et al., 2011). Projected changes in total precipitation exhibit 
uncertainties, mainly in the Sahel (Section 3.3.3 and Figure 3.8; Diedhiou et al., 2018). In the Guinea Coast and Central Africa, only a 
small change in total precipitation is projected, although most models (70%) indicate a decrease in the length of wet periods and a 
slight increase in heavy rainfall. Western Sahel is projected by most models (80%) to experience the strongest drying, with a significant 
increase in the maximum length of dry spells (Diedhiou et al., 2018). Above 2°C, this region could become more vulnerable to drought 
and could face serious food security issues (Cross-Chapter Box 6 and Section 3.4.6 in this chapter; Salem et al., 2017; Parkes et al., 
2018). West Africa has thus been identified as a climate-change hotspot with negative impacts from climate change on crop yields and 
production (Cross-Chapter Box 6 and Section 3.4.6; Sultan and Gaetani, 2016; Palazzo et al., 2017). Despite uncertainty in projections 
for precipitation in West Africa, which is essential for rain-fed agriculture, robust evidence of yield loss might emerge. This yield loss 
is expected to be mainly driven by increased mean temperature, while potential wetter or drier conditions – as well as elevated CO2 
concentrations – could modulate this effect (Roudier et al., 2011; see also Cross-Chapter Box 6 and Section 3.4.6). Using Representative 
Concentration Pathway (RCP)8.5 Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) scenarios from 25 regional climate 
models (RCMs) forced with different general circulation models (GCMs), Klutse et al. (2018) noted a decrease in mean rainfall over 
West Africa in models with stronger warming for this region at 1.5°C of global warming (Section 3.3.4). Mba et al. (2018) used a similar 
approach and found a lack of consensus in the changes in precipitation over Central Africa (Figure 3.8 and Section 3.3.4), although there 
was a tendency towards a decrease in the maximum number of consecutive wet days (CWD) and a significant increase in the maximum 
number of consecutive dry days (CDD).
Over southern Africa, models agree on a positive sign of change for temperature, with temperature rising faster at 2°C (1.5°C–2.5°C) as 
compared to 1.5°C (0.5°C–1.5°C) of global warming. Areas in the south-western region, especially in South Africa and parts of Namibia 
and Botswana, are expected to experience the largest increases in temperature (Section 3.3.2; Engelbrecht et al., 2015; Maúre et al., 
2018). The western part of southern Africa is projected to become drier with increasing drought frequency and number of heatwaves 
towards the end of the 21st century (Section 3.3.4; Engelbrecht et al., 2015; Dosio, 2017; Maúre et al., 2018). At 1.5°C, a robust signal 
of precipitation reduction is found over the Limpopo basin and smaller areas of the Zambezi basin in Zambia, as well as over parts of 
Western Cape in South Africa, while an increase is projected over central and western South Africa, as well as in southern Namibia 
(Section 3.3.4). At 2°C, the region is projected to face robust precipitation decreases of about 10–20% and increases in the number of 
CDD, with longer dry spells projected over Namibia, Botswana, northern Zimbabwe and southern Zambia. Conversely, the number of 
CWD is projected to decrease, with robust signals over Western Cape (Maúre et al., 2018). Projected reductions in stream flow of 5–10% 
in the Zambezi River basin have been associated with increased evaporation and transpiration rates resulting from a rise in temperature 
( Section 3.3.5; Kling et al., 2014), with issues for hydroelectric power across the region of southern Africa.
For Eastern Africa, Osima et al. (2018) found that annual rainfall projections show a robust increase in precipitation over Somalia and 
a less robust decrease over central and northern Ethiopia (Section 3.3.3). The number of CDD and CWD are projected to increase and 
decrease, respectively (Section 3.3.4). These projected changes could impact the agricultural and water sectors in the region (Cross-
Chapter Box 6 in this chapter and Section 3.4.6).

under the RCP8.5 scenario. However, more recent assessments have 
highlighted uncertainties in dryness projections due to a range of 
factors, including variations between the drought and dryness indices 
considered, and the effects of enhanced CO2 concentrations on plant 
water-use efficiency (Orlowsky and Seneviratne, 2013; Roderick et 
al., 2015). Overall, projections of changes in drought and dryness for 
high-emissions scenarios (e.g., RCP8.5, corresponding to about 4°C of 
global warming) are uncertain in many regions, although a few regions 
display consistent drying in most assessments (e.g., Seneviratne et al., 
2012; Orlowsky and Seneviratne, 2013). Uncertainty is expected to be 
even larger for conditions with a smaller signal-to-noise ratio, such as 
for global warming levels of 1.5°C and 2°C.
Some published literature is now available on the evaluation of 
differences in drought and dryness occurrence at 1.5°C and 2°C of global 
warming for (i) precipitation minus evapotranspiration (P–E, a general 
measure of water availability; Wartenburger et al., 2017; Greve et al., 
2018), (ii) soil moisture anomalies (Lehner et al., 2017; Wartenburger 
et al., 2017), (iii) consecutive dry days (CDD) (Schleussner et al., 2016b; 
Wartenburger et al., 2017), (iv) the 12-month standardized precipitation 
index (Wartenburger et al., 2017), (v) the Palmer drought severity index 
(Lehner et al., 2017), and (vi) annual mean runoff (Schleussner et al., 
2016b, see also next section). These analyses have produced consistent 
findings overall, despite the known sensitivity of drought assessments to 
chosen drought indices (see above paragraph). These analyses suggest 
that increases in drought, dryness or precipitation deficits are projected 
at 1.5°C or 2°C global warming in some regions compared to the pre-
industrial or present-day conditions, as well as between these two 
global warming levels, although there is substantial variability in signals 
depending on the considered indices or climate models (Lehner et al., 
2017; Schleussner et al., 2017; Greve et al., 2018) (medium confidence). 
Generally, the clearest signals are found for the Mediterranean region 
(medium confidence). 
Greve et al. (2018, Figure 3.12) derives the sensitivity of regional 
changes in precipitation minus evapotranspiration to global 
temperature changes. The simulations analysed span the full range of 
available emission scenarios, and the sensitivities are derived using 
a modified pattern scaling approach. The applied approach assumes 
linear dependencies on global temperature changes while thoroughly 
addressing associated uncertainties via resampling methods. Northern 
high-latitude regions display robust responses tending towards 
increased wetness, while subtropical regions display a tendency 
towards drying but with a large range of responses. While the internal 
variability and the scenario choice play an important role in the overall 
spread of the simulations, the uncertainty stemming from the climate 
model choice usually dominates, accounting for about half of the total 
uncertainty in most regions (Wartenburger et al., 2017; Greve et al., 
2018). The sign of projections, that is, whether there might be increases 
or decreases in water availability under higher global warming levels, 
is particularly uncertain in tropical and mid-latitude regions. An 
assessment of the implications of limiting the global mean temperature 
increase to values below (i) 1.5°C or (ii) 2°C shows that constraining 
global warming to the 1.5°C target might slightly influence the mean 
Figure 3.12 |  Summary of the likelihood of increases/decreases in precipitation minus evapotranspiration (P–E) in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) 
simulations considering all scenarios and a representative subset of 14 climate models (one from each modelling centre). Panel plots show the uncertainty distribution of the 
sensitivity of P–E to global temperature change, averaged for most IPCC Special Report on Managing the Risk of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change 
Adaptation (SREX) regions (see Figure 3.2) outlined in the map (from Greve et al., 2018).

response but could substantially reduce the risk of experiencing 
extreme changes in regional water availability (Greve et al., 2018).
The findings from the analysis for the mean response by Greve et al. 
(2018) are qualitatively consistent with results from Wartenburger et 
al. (2017), who used an ESR (Section 3.2) rather than a pattern scaling 
approach for a range of drought and dryness indices. They are also 
consistent with a study by Lehner et al. (2017), who assessed changes 
in droughts based on soil moisture changes and the Palmer-Drought 
Severity Index. Notably, these two publications do not provide a 
specific assessment of changes in the tails of the drought and dryness 
distribution. The conclusions of Lehner et al. (2017) are that (i) ‘risks of 
consecutive drought years show little change in the US Southwest and 
Central Plains, but robust increases in Europe and the Mediterranean’, 
and that (ii) ‘limiting warming to 1.5°C may have benefits for future 
drought risk, but such benefits are regional, and in some cases highly 
uncertain’.
Figure 3.13 features projected changes in CDD as a function of global 
temperature increase, using a similar approach as for Figures 3.5 (based 
Figure 3.14 |  Significance of differences in regional drought and dryness indices between the 1.5°C and 2°C global mean temperature targets (rows). Definition of indices:

on Wartenburger et al., 2017). The figure also include results from the 
HAPPI experiment (Mitchell et al., 2017). Again, the CMIP5-based ESR 
estimates and the results of the HAPPI experiment agree well. Note 
that the responses vary widely among the considered regions. 
Similar to Figures 3.8 and 3.11, Figure 3.14 features an objective 
identification of ‘hotspots’ / key risks in dryness indices subdivided 
by region, based on the approach by Wartenburger et al. (2017). This 
analysis reveals the following hotspots of drying (i.e. increases in CDD 
and/or decreases in P–E, soil moisture anomalies (SMA) and 12-month 
Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI12), with at least one of the 
indices displaying statistically significant drying): the Mediterranean 
region (MED; including southern Europe, northern Africa, and the Near 
East), northeastern Brazil (NEB) and southern Africa. 
Consistent with this analysis, the available literature particularly 
supports robust increases in dryness and decreases in water availability 
in southern Europe and the Mediterranean with a shift from 1.5°C to 
2°C of global warming (medium confidence) (Figure 3.13; Schleussner 
et al., 2016b; Lehner et al., 2017; Wartenburger et al., 2017; Greve et 
al., 2018; Samaniego et al., 2018). This region is already displaying 
substantial drying in the observational record (Seneviratne et al., 2012; 
Sheffield et al., 2012; Greve et al., 2014; Gudmundsson and Seneviratne, 
2016; Gudmundsson et al., 2017), which provides additional evidence 
supporting this tendency and suggests that it will be a hotspot of 
dryness change at global warming levels beyond 1.5°C (see also Box 
3.2). The other identified hotspots, southern Africa and northeastern 
Brazil, also consistently display drying trends under higher levels of 
forcing in other publications (e.g., Orlowsky and Seneviratne, 2013), 
although no published studies could be found reporting observed 
drying trends in these regions. There are substantial increases in 
the risk of increased dryness (medium confidence) in both the 
Mediterranean region and Southern Africa at 2°C versus 1.5°C of 
global warming because these regions display significant changes 
in two dryness indicators (CDD and SMA) between these two global 
warming levels (Figure 3.14); the strongest effects are expected for 
extreme droughts (medium confidence) (Figure 3.12). There is low 
confidence elsewhere, owing to a lack of consistency in analyses 
with different models or different dryness indicators. However, in 
many regions there is medium confidence that most extreme risks of 
changes in dryness are avoided if global warming is constrained at 
1.5°C instead of 2°C (Figure 3.12).
In summary, in terms of drought and dryness, limiting global warming 
to 1.5°C is expected to substantially reduce the probability of extreme 
changes in water availability in some regions compared to changes 
under 2°C of global warming (medium confidence). For shift from 1.5°C 
to 2°C of GMST warming, the available studies and analyses suggest 
strong increases in the probability of dryness and reduced water 
availability in the Mediterranean region (including southern Europe, 
northern Africa and the Near East) and in southern Africa (medium 
confidence). Based on observations and modelling experiments, a 
drying trend is already detectable in the Mediterranean region, that is, 
at global warming of less than 1°C (medium confidence). 
Box 3.2 |  Droughts in the Mediterranean Basin and the Middle East 
Human society has developed in tandem with the natural environment of the Mediterranean basin over several millennia, laying 
the groundwork for diverse and culturally rich communities. Even if advances in technology may offer some protection from climatic 
hazards, the consequences of climatic change for inhabitants of this region continue to depend on the long-term interplay between an 
array of societal and environmental factors (Holmgren et al., 2016). As a result, the Mediterranean is an example of a region with high 
vulnerability where various adaptation responses have emerged. Previous IPCC assessments and recent publications project regional 
changes in climate under increased temperatures, including consistent climate model projections of increased precipitation deficit 
amplified by strong regional warming (Section 3.3.3; Seneviratne et al., 2012; Christensen et al., 2013; Collins et al., 2013; Greve and 
Seneviratne, 2015). 
The long history of resilience to climatic change is especially apparent in the eastern Mediterranean region, which has experienced a 
strong negative trend in precipitation since 1960 (Mathbout et al., 2017) and an intense and prolonged drought episode between 2007 
and 2010 (Kelley et al., 2015). This drought was the longest and most intense in the last 900 years (Cook et al., 2016). Some authors 
(e.g., Trigo et al., 2010; Kelley et al., 2015) assert that very low precipitation levels have driven a steep decline in agricultural productivity 
in the Euphrates and Tigris catchment basins, and displaced hundreds of thousands of people, mainly in Syria. Impacts on the water 
resources (Yazdanpanah et al., 2016) and crop performance in Iran have also been reported (Saeidi et al., 2017). Many historical periods 
of turmoil have coincided with severe droughts, for example the drought which occurred at the end of the Bronze Age approximately 
3200 years ago (Kaniewski et al., 2015). In this instance, a number of flourishing eastern Mediterranean civilizations collapsed, and rural 
settlements re-emerged with agro-pastoral activities and limited long-distance trade. This illustrates how some vulnerable regions are 
forced to pursue drastic adaptive responses, including migration and societal structure changes.
The potential evolution of drought conditions under 1.5°C or 2°C of global warming (Section 3.3.4) can be analysed by comparing the 
2008 drought (high temperature, low precipitation) with the 1960 drought (low temperature, low precipitation) (Kelley et al., 2015). 
Though the precipitation deficits were comparable, the 2008 drought was amplified by increased evapotranspiration induced by much 
higher temperatures (a mean increase of 1°C compared with the 1931–2008 period in Syria) and a large population increase (from 
201

5 million in 1960 to 22 million in 2008). Koutroulis et al. (2016) reported that only 6% out of the total 18% decrease in water availability 
projected for Crete under 2°C of global warming at the end of the 21st century would be due to decreased precipitation, with the 
remaining 12% due to an increase in evapotranspiration. This study and others like it confirm an important risk of extreme drought 
conditions for the Middle East under 1.5°C of global warming (Jacob et al., 2018), with risks being even higher in continental locations 
than on islands; these projections are consistent with current observed changes (Section 3.3.4; Greve et al., 2014). Risks of drying in the 
Mediterranean region could be substantially reduced if global warming is limited to 1.5°C compared to 2°C or higher levels of warming 
(Section 3.4.3; Guiot and Cramer, 2016). Higher warming levels may induce high levels of vulnerability exacerbated by large changes 
in demography.
3.3.5 
Runoff and Fluvial Flooding 
3.3.5.1 Observed and attributed changes in runoff and river 
flooding
There has been progress since AR5 in identifying historical changes 
in streamflow and continental runoff. Using the available streamflow 
data, Dai (2016) showed that long-term (1948–2012) flow trends 
are statistically significant only for 27.5% of the world’s 200 major 
rivers, with negative trends outnumbering the positive ones. Although 
streamflow trends are mostly not statistically significant, they are 
consistent with observed regional precipitation changes. From 1950 to 
2012, precipitation and runoff have increased over southeastern South 
America, central and northern Australia, the central and northeastern 
United States, central and northern Europe, and most of Russia, and 
they have decreased over most of Africa, East and South Asia, eastern 
coastal Australia, the southeastern and northwestern United States, 
western and eastern Canada, the Mediterranean region and some 
regions of Brazil (Dai, 2016). 
A large part of the observed regional trends in streamflow and runoff 
might have resulted from internal multi-decadal and multi-year climate 
variations, especially the Pacific decadal variability (PDV), the Atlantic 
Multi-Decadal Oscillation (AMO) and the El Niño–Southern Oscillation 
(ENSO), although the effect of anthropogenic greenhouse gases 
and aerosols could also be important (Hidalgo et al., 2009; Gu and 
Adler, 2013, 2015; Chiew et al., 2014; Luo et al., 2016; Gudmundsson 
et al., 2017). Additionally, other human activities can influence the 
hydrological cycle, such as land-use/land-cover change, modifications 
in river morphology and water table depth, construction and 
operation of hydropower plants, dikes and weirs, wetland drainage, 
and agricultural practices such as water withdrawal for irrigation. All 
of these activities can also have a large impact on runoff at the river 
basin scale, although there is less agreement over their influence on 
global mean runoff (Gerten et al., 2008; Sterling et al., 2012; Hall et al., 
2014; Betts et al., 2015; Arheimer et al., 2017). Some studies suggest 
that increases in global runoff resulting from changes in land cover 
or land use (predominantly deforestation) are counterbalanced by 
decreases resulting from irrigation (Gerten et al., 2008; Sterling et al., 
2012). Likewise, forest and grassland fires can modify the hydrological 
response at the watershed scale when the burned area is significant 
(Versini et al., 2013; Springer et al., 2015; Wine and Cadol, 2016).
Few studies have explored observed changes in extreme streamflow 
and river flooding since the IPCC AR5. Mallakpour and Villarini (2015) 
analysed changes of flood magnitude and frequency in the central 
United States by considering stream gauge daily records with at least 
50 years of data ending no earlier than 2011. They showed that flood 
frequency has increased, whereas there was limited evidence of a 
decrease in flood magnitude in this region. Stevens et al. (2016) found 
a rise in the number of reported floods in the United Kingdom during 
the period 1884–2013, with flood events appearing more frequently 
towards the end of the 20th century. A peak was identified in 2012, 
when annual rainfall was the second highest in over 100 years. Do et al. 
(2017) computed the trends in annual maximum daily streamflow data 
across the globe over the 1966–2005 period. They found decreasing 
trends for a large number of stations in western North America and 
Australia, and increasing trends in parts of Europe, eastern North 
America, parts of South America, and southern Africa. 
In summary, streamflow trends since 1950 are not statistically 
significant in most of the world’s largest rivers (high confidence), 
while flood frequency and extreme streamflow have increased in some 
regions (high confidence).
3.3.5.2 Projected changes in runoff and river flooding at 1.5°C 
versus 2°C of global warming
Global-scale assessments of projected changes in freshwater systems 
generally suggest that areas with either positive or negative changes 
in mean annual streamflow are smaller for 1.5°C than for 2°C of 
global warming (Betts et al., 2018; Döll et al., 2018). Döll et al. (2018) 
found that only 11% of the global land area (excluding Greenland and 
Antarctica) shows a statistically significantly larger hazard at 2°C than 
at 1.5°C. Significant decreases are found for 13% of the global land 
area for both global warming levels, while significant increases are 
projected to occur for 21% of the global land area at 1.5°C, and rise 
to between 26% (Döll et al., 2018) and approximately 50% (Betts et 
al., 2018) at 2°C.
At the regional scale, projected runoff changes generally follow the 
spatial extent of projected changes in precipitation (see Section 3.3.3). 
Emerging literature includes runoff projections for different warming 
levels. For 2°C of global warming, an increase in runoff is projected 
for much of the high northern latitudes, Southeast Asia, East Africa, 
northeastern Europe, India, and parts of, Austria, China, Hungary, 
Norway, Sweden, the northwest Balkans and Sahel (Schleussner et 
al., 2016b; Donnelly et al., 2017; Döll et al., 2018; Zhai et al., 2018). 
Additionally, decreases are projected in the Mediterranean region, 
southern Australia, Central America, and central and southern South 
Box 3.2 (continued)

America (Schleussner et al., 2016b; Donnelly et al., 2017; Döll et al., 
2018). Differences between 1.5°C and 2°C would be most prominent 
in the Mediterranean, where the median reduction in annual runoff 
is expected to be about 9% (likely range 4.5–15.5%) at 1.5°C, 
while at 2°C of warming runoff could decrease by 17% (likely range 
8–25%) (Schleussner et al., 2016b). Consistent with these projections, 
Döll et al. (2018) found that statistically insignificant changes in the 
mean annual streamflow around the Mediterranean region became 
significant when the global warming scenario was changed from 1.5°C 
to 2°C, with decreases of 10–30% between these two warming levels. 
Donnelly et al. (2017) found an intense decrease in runoff along both 
the Iberian and Balkan coasts with an increase in warming level.
Basin-scale projections of river runoff at different warming levels 
are available for many regions. Betts et al. (2018) assessed runoff 
changes in 21 of the world’s major river basins at 1.5°C and 2°C of 
global warming (Figure 3.15). They found a general tendency towards 
increased runoff, except in the Amazon, Orange, Danube and Guadiana 
basins where the range of projections indicate decreased mean flows 
(Figure 3.13). In the case of the Amazon, mean flows are projected 
to decline by up to 25% at 2°C global warming (Betts et al., 2018). 
Gosling et al. (2017) analysed the impact of global warming of 1°C, 2°C 
and 3°C above pre-industrial levels on river runoff at the catchment 
scale, focusing on eight major rivers in different continents: Upper 
Amazon, Darling, Ganges, Lena, Upper Mississippi, Upper Niger, Rhine 
and Tagus. Their results show that the sign and magnitude of change 
with global warming for the Upper Amazon, Darling, Ganges, Upper 
Niger and Upper Mississippi is unclear, while the Rhine and Tagus may 
experience decreases in projected runoff and the Lena may experience 
increases. Donnelly et al. (2017) analysed the mean flow response to 
different warming levels for six major European rivers: Glomma, Wisla, 
Lule, Ebro, Rhine and Danube. Consistent with the increases in mean 
runoff projected for large parts of northern Europe, the Glomma, Wisla 
and Lule rivers could experience increased discharges with global 
warming while discharges from the Ebro could decrease, in part due 
to a decrease in runoff in southern Europe. In the case of the Rhine 
and Danube rivers, Donnelly et al. (2017) did not find clear results. 
Mean annual runoff of the Yiluo River catchment in northern China 
is projected to decrease by 22% at 1.5°C and by 21% at 2°C, while 
the mean annual runoff for the Beijiang River catchment in southern 
China is projected to increase by less than 1% at 1.5°C and 3% at 
2°C in comparison to the studied baseline period (L. Liu et al., 2017).

Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems 
Chapter 3
Chen et al. (2017) assessed the future changes in water resources in 
the Upper Yangtze River basin for the same warming levels and found 
a slight decrease in the annual discharge at 1.5°C but a slight increase 
at 2°C. Montroull et al. (2018) studied the hydrological impacts of the 
main rivers (Paraguay, Paraná, Iguazú and Uruguay) in La Plata basin 
in South America under 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming and for two 
emissions scenarios. The Uruguay basin shows increases in streamflow 
for all scenarios/warming targets except for the combination of 
RCP8.5/1.5°C of warming. The increase is approximately 15% above 
the 1981–2000 reference period for 2°C of global warming and the 
RCP4.5 scenario. For the other three rivers the sign of the change in 
mean streamflow depends strongly on the RCP and GCM used.
Marx et al. (2018) analysed how hydrological low flows in Europe are 
affected under different global warming levels (1.5°C, 2°C and 3°C). 
The Alpine region showed the strongest low flow increase, from 22% 
at 1.5°C to 30% at 2°C, because of the relatively large snow melt 
contribution, while in the Mediterranean low flows are expected to 
decrease because of the decreases in annual precipitation projected 
for that region. Döll et al. (2018) found that extreme low flows in the 
tropical Amazon, Congo and Indonesian basins could decrease by 10% 
at 1.5°C, whereas they could increase by 30% in the southwestern part 
of Russia under the same warming level. At 2°C, projected increases in 
extreme low flows are exacerbated in the higher northern latitudes and 
in eastern Africa, India and Southeast Asia, while projected decreases 
intensify in the Amazon basin, western United States, central Canada, 
and southern and western Europe, although not in the Congo basin or 
Indonesia, where models show less agreement. 
Recent analyses of projections in river flooding and extreme runoff and 
flows are available for different global warming levels. At the global 
scale, Alfieri et al. (2017) assessed the frequency and magnitude of river 
floods and their impacts under 1.5°C, 2°C and 4°C global warming 
scenarios. They found that flood events with an occurrence interval 
longer than the return period of present-day flood protections are 
projected to increase in all continents under all considered warming 
levels, leading to a widespread increment in the flood hazard. Döll et al. 
(2018) found that high flows are projected to increase significantly on 
11% and 21% of the global land area at 1.5°C and 2°C, respectively. 
Significantly increased high flows are expected to occur in South and 
Southeast Asia and Central Africa at 1.5°C, with this effect intensifying 
and including parts of South America at 2°C.
Regarding the continental scale, Donnelly et al. (2017) and Thober et 
al. (2018) explored climate change impacts on European high flows 
and/or floods under 1.5°C, 2°C and 3°C of global warming. Thober et 
al. (2018) identified the Mediterranean region as a hotspot of change, 
with significant decreases in high flows of −11% and –13% at 1.5°C 
and 2°C, respectively, mainly resulting from reduced precipitation (Box 
3.2). In northern regions, high flows are projected to rise by 1% and 
5% at 1.5°C and 2°C, respectively, owing to increasing precipitation, 
although floods could decrease by 6% in both scenarios because of 
less snowmelt. Donnelly et al. (2017) found that high runoff levels 
could rise in intensity, robustness and spatial extent over large parts 
of continental Europe with an increasing warming level. At 2°C, flood 
magnitudes are expected to increase significantly in Europe south of 
60°N, except for some regions (Bulgaria, Poland and southern Spain); 
in contrast, they are projected to decrease at higher latitudes (e.g., 
in most of Finland, northwestern Russia and northern Sweden), with 
the exception of southern Sweden and some coastal areas in Norway 
where flood magnitudes may increase (Roudier et al., 2016). At the 
basin scale, Mohammed et al. (2017) found that floods are projected to 
be more frequent and flood magnitudes greater at 2°C than at 1.5°C 
in the Brahmaputra River in Bangladesh. In coastal regions, increases 
in heavy precipitation associated with tropical cyclones (Section 
3.3.6) combined with increased sea levels (Section 3.3.9) may lead to 
increased flooding (Section 3.4.5).
In summary, there is medium confidence that global warming of 2°C 
above the pre-industrial period would lead to an expansion of the 
area with significant increases in runoff, as well as the area affected 
by flood hazard, compared to conditions at 1.5°C of global warming.  
A global warming of 1.5°C would also lead to an expansion of the global 
land area with significant increases in runoff (medium confidence) and 
to an increase in flood hazard in some regions (medium confidence) 
compared to present-day conditions.
3.3.6 
Tropical Cyclones and Extratropical Storms 
Most recent studies on observed trends in the attributes of tropical 
cyclones have focused on the satellite era starting in 1979 (Rienecker 
et al., 2011), but the study of observed trends is complicated by the 
heterogeneity of constantly advancing remote sensing techniques and 
instrumentation during this period (e.g., Landsea, 2006; Walsh et al., 
2016). Numerous studies leading up to and after AR5 have reported 
a decreasing trend in the global number of tropical cyclones and/or 
the globally accumulated cyclonic energy (Emanuel, 2005; Elsner et al., 
2008; Knutson et al., 2010; Holland and Bruyère, 2014; Klotzbach and 
Landsea, 2015; Walsh et al., 2016). A theoretical physical basis for such 
a decrease to occur under global warming was recently provided by 
Kang and Elsner (2015). However, using a relatively short (20 year) 
and relatively homogeneous remotely sensed record, Klotzbach (2006) 
reported no significant trends in global cyclonic activity, consistent 
with more recent findings of Holland and Bruyère (2014). Such 
contradictions, in combination with the fact that the almost four-
decade-long period of remotely sensed observations remains relatively 
short to distinguish anthropogenically induced trends from decadal 
and multi-decadal variability, implies that there is only low confidence 
regarding changes in global tropical cyclone numbers under global 
warming over the last four decades.
Studies in the detection of trends in the occurrence of very intense 
tropical cyclones (category 4 and 5 hurricanes on the Saffir-Simpson 
scale) over recent decades have yielded contradicting results. Most 
studies have reported increases in these systems (Emanuel, 2005; 
Webster et al., 2005; Klotzbach, 2006; Elsner et al., 2008; Knutson et al., 
2010; Holland and Bruyère, 2014; Walsh et al., 2016), in particular for the 
North Atlantic, North Indian and South Indian Ocean basins (e.g., Singh 
et al., 2000; Singh, 2010; Kossin et al., 2013; Holland and Bruyère, 2014; 
Walsh et al., 2016). In the North Indian Ocean over the Arabian Sea, an 
increase in the frequency of extremely severe cyclonic storms has been 
reported and attributed to anthropogenic warming (Murakami et al., 
2017). However, to the east over the Bay of Bengal, tropical cyclones 
and severe tropical cyclones have exhibited decreasing trends over 
204
Chapter 3

the period 1961–2010, although the ratio between severe tropical 
cyclones and all tropical cyclones is increasing (Mohapatra et al., 
2017). Moreover, studies that have used more homogeneous records, 
but were consequently limited to rather short periods of 20 to 25 years, 
have reported no statistically significant trends or decreases in the 
global number of these systems (Kamahori et al., 2006; Klotzbach and 
Landsea, 2015). Likewise, CMIP5 model simulations of the historical 
period have not produced anthropogenically induced trends in very 
intense tropical cyclones (Bender et al., 2010; Knutson et al., 2010, 
2013; Camargo, 2013; Christensen et al., 2013), consistent with the 
findings of Klotzbach and Landsea (2015). There is consequently low 
confidence in the conclusion that the number of very intense cyclones 
is increasing globally. 
General circulation model (GCM) projections of the changing 
attributes of tropical cyclones under high levels of greenhouse gas 
forcing (3°C to 4°C of global warming) consistently indicate decreases 
in the global number of tropical cyclones (Knutson et al., 2010, 2015; 
Sugi and Yoshimura, 2012; Christensen et al., 2013; Yoshida et al., 
2017). A smaller number of studies based on statistical downscaling 
methodologies contradict these findings, however, and indicate 
increases in the global number of tropical cyclones under climate 
change (Emanuel, 2017). Most studies also indicate increases in the 
global number of very intense tropical cyclones under high levels of 
global warming (Knutson et al., 2015; Sugi et al., 2017), consistent 
with dynamic theory (Kang and Elsner, 2015), although a few studies 
contradict this finding (e.g., Yoshida et al., 2017). Hence, it is assessed 
that under 3°C to 4°C of warming that the global number of tropical 
cyclones would decrease whilst the number of very intense cyclones 
would increase (medium confidence).
To date, only two studies have directly explored the changing tropical 
cyclone attributes under 1.5°C versus 2°C of global warming. Using 
a high resolution global atmospheric model, Wehner et al. (2018a) 
concluded that the differences in tropical cyclone statistics under 1.5°C 
versus 2°C stabilization scenarios, as defined by the HAPPI protocols 
(Mitchell et al., 2017) are small. Consistent with the majority of studies 
performed for higher degrees of global warming, the total number 
of tropical cyclones is projected to decrease under global warming, 
whilst the most intense (categories 4 and 5) cyclones are projected 
to occur more frequently. These very intense storms are projected 
to be associated with higher peak wind speeds and lower central 
pressures under 2°C versus 1.5°C of global warming. The accumulated 
cyclonic energy is projected to decrease globally from 1.5°C to 2°C, in 
association with a decrease in the global number of tropical cyclones 
under progressively higher levels of global warming. It is also noted 
that heavy rainfall associated with tropical cyclones was assessed in 
the IPCC SREX as likely to increase under increasing global warming 
(Seneviratne et al., 2012). Two recent articles suggest that there is 
high confidence that the current level of global warming (i.e., about 
1°C, see Section 3.3.1) increased the heavy precipitation associated 
with the 2017 Hurricane Harvey by about 15% or more (Risser and 
Wehner, 2017; van Oldenborgh et al., 2017). Hence, it can be inferred, 
under the assumption of linear dynamics, that further increases in 
heavy precipitation would occur under 1.5°C, 2°C and higher levels of 
global warming (medium confidence). Using a high resolution regional 
climate model, Muthige et al. (2018) explored the effects of different 
degrees of global warming on tropical cyclones over the southwest 
Indian Ocean, using transient simulations that downscaled a number of 
RCP8.5 GCM projections. Decreases in tropical cyclone frequencies are 
projected under both 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming. The decreases 
in cyclone frequencies under 2°C of global warming are somewhat 
larger than under 1.5°C, but no further decreases are projected under 
3°C. This suggests that 2°C of warming, at least in these downscaling 
simulations, represents a type of stabilization level in terms of tropical 
cyclone formation over the southwest Indian Ocean and landfall over 
southern Africa (Muthige et al., 2018). There is thus limited evidence 
that the global number of tropical cyclones will be lower under 2°C 
compared to 1.5°C of global warming, but with an increase in the 
number of very intense cyclones (low confidence).
The global response of the mid-latitude atmospheric circulation to 
1.5°C and 2°C of warming was investigated using the HAPPI ensemble 
with a focus on the winter season (Li et al., 2018). Under 1.5°C of 
global warming a weakening of storm activity over North America, 
an equatorward shift of the North Pacific jet exit and an equatorward 
intensification of the South Pacific jet are projected. Under an additional 
0.5°C of warming a poleward shift of the North Atlantic jet exit and 
an intensification on the flanks of the Southern Hemisphere storm 
track are projected to become more pronounced. The weakening of 
the Mediterranean storm track that is projected under low mitigation 
emerges in the 2°C warmer world (Li et al., 2018). AR5 assessed that 
under high greenhouse gas forcing (3°C or 4°C of global warming) 
there is low confidence in projections of poleward shifts of the 
Northern Hemisphere storm tracks, while there is high confidence that 
there would be a small poleward shift of the Southern Hemisphere 
storm tracks (Stocker et al., 2013). In the context of this report, the 
assessment is that there is limited evidence and low confidence in 
whether any projected signal for higher levels of warming would be 
clearly manifested under 2°C of global warming.
3.3.7 
Ocean Circulation and Temperature
It is virtually certain that the temperature of the upper layers of the 
ocean (0–700 m in depth) has been increasing, and that the global 
mean for sea surface temperature (SST) has been changing at a rate 
just behind that of GMST. The surfaces of three ocean basins has 
warmed over the period 1950–2016 (by 0.11°C, 0.07°C and 0.05°C 
per decade for the Indian, Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, respectively; 
Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014), with the greatest changes occurring 
at the highest latitudes. Isotherms (i.e., lines of equal temperature) of 
sea surface temperature (SST) are shifting to higher latitudes at rates 
of up to 40 km per year (Burrows et al., 2014; García Molinos et al., 
2015). Long-term patterns of variability make detecting signals due to 
climate change complex, although the recent acceleration of changes 
to the temperature of the surface layers of the ocean has made the 
climate signal more distinct (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014). There is also 
evidence of significant increases in the frequency of marine heatwaves 
in the observational record (Oliver et al., 2018), consistent with 
changes in mean ocean temperatures (high confidence). Increasing 
climate extremes in the ocean are associated with the general rise in 
global average surface temperature, as well as more intense patterns 
of climate variability (e.g., climate change intensification of ENSO) 
(Section 3.5.2.5). Increased heat in the upper layers of the ocean is 
205

Chapter 3
also driving more intense storms and greater rates of inundation in 
some regions, which, together with sea level rise, are already driving 
significant impacts to sensitive coastal and low-lying areas (Section 
3.3.6). 
Increasing land–sea temperature gradients have the potential to 
strengthen upwelling systems associated with the eastern boundary 
currents (Benguela, Canary, Humboldt and Californian Currents; 
Bakun, 1990). Observed trends support the conclusion that a general 
strengthening of longshore winds has occurred (Sydeman et al., 2014), 
but the implications of trends detected in upwelling currents themselves 
are unclear (Lluch-Cota et al., 2014). Projections of the scale of changes 
between 1°C and 1.5°C of global warming and between 1.5°C and 
2°C are only informed by the changes during the past increase in GMST 
of 0.5°C (low confidence). However, evidence from GCM projections 
of future climate change indicates that a general strengthening of the 
Benguela, Canary and Humboldt upwelling systems under enhanced 
anthropogenic forcing (D. Wang et al., 2015) is projected to occur 
(medium confidence). This strengthening is projected to be stronger 
at higher latitudes. In fact, evidence from regional climate modelling 
is supportive of an increase in long-shore winds at higher latitudes, 
whereas long-shore winds may decrease at lower latitudes as a 
consequence of the poleward displacement of the subtropical highs 
under climate change (Christensen et al., 2007; Engelbrecht et al., 
2009). 
It is more likely than not that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning 
Circulation (AMOC) has been weakening in recent decades, given 
the detection of the cooling of surface waters in the North Atlantic 
and evidence that the Gulf Stream has slowed since the late 1950s 
(Rahmstorf et al., 2015b; Srokosz and Bryden, 2015; Caesar et al., 
2018). There is only limited evidence linking the current anomalously 
weak state of AMOC to anthropogenic warming (Caesar et al., 2018). It 
is very likely that the AMOC will weaken over the 21st century. The best 
estimates and ranges for the reduction based on CMIP5 simulations 
are 11% (1– 24%) in RCP2.6 and 34% (12– 54%) in RCP8.5 (AR5). 
There is no evidence indicating significantly different amplitudes of 
AMOC weakening for 1.5°C versus 2°C of global warming.
3.3.8 
Sea Ice
Summer sea ice in the Arctic has been retreating rapidly in recent 
decades. During the period 1997 to 2014, for example, the monthly 
mean sea ice extent during September (summer) decreased on average 
by 130,000 km² per year (Serreze and Stroeve, 2015). This is about four 
times as fast as the September sea ice loss during the period 1979 
to 1996. Sea ice thickness has also decreased substantially, with an 
estimated decrease in ice thickness of more than 50% in the central 
Arctic (Lindsay and Schweiger, 2015). Sea ice coverage and thickness 
also decrease in CMIP5 simulations of the recent past, and are 
projected to decrease in the future (Collins et al., 2013). However, 
the modelled sea ice loss in most CMIP5 models is much smaller 
than observed losses. Compared to observations, the simulations are 
less sensitive to both global mean temperature rise (Rosenblum and 
Eisenman, 2017) and anthropogenic CO2 emissions (Notz and Stroeve, 
2016). This mismatch between the observed and modelled sensitivity 
of Arctic sea ice implies that the multi-model-mean responses of future 
sea ice evolution probably underestimates the sea ice loss for a given 
amount of global warming. To address this issue, studies estimating 
the future evolution of Arctic sea ice tend to bias correct the model 
simulations based on the observed evolution of Arctic sea ice in 
response to global warming. Based on such bias correction, pre-AR5 
and post-AR5 studies generally agree that for 1.5°C of global warming 
relative to pre-industrial levels, the Arctic Ocean will maintain a sea ice 
cover throughout summer in most years (Collins et al., 2013; Notz and 
Stroeve, 2016; Screen and Williamson, 2017; Jahn, 2018; Niederdrenk 
and Notz, 2018; Sigmond et al., 2018). For 2°C of global warming, 
chances of a sea ice-free Arctic during summer are substantially higher 
(Screen and Williamson, 2017; Jahn, 2018; Niederdrenk and Notz, 
2018; Screen et al., 2018; Sigmond et al., 2018). Model simulations 
suggest that there will be at least one sea ice-free Arctic5 summer after 
approximately 10 years of stabilized warming at 2°C, as compared 
to one sea ice-free summer after 100 years of stabilized warming at 
1.5°C above pre-industrial temperatures (Jahn, 2018; Screen et al., 
2018; Sigmond et al., 2018). For a specific given year under stabilized 
warming of 2°C, studies based on large ensembles of simulations with 
a single model estimate the likelihood of ice-free conditions as 35% 
without a bias correction of the underlying model (Sanderson et al., 
2017; Jahn, 2018); as between 10% and >99% depending on the 
observational record used to correct the sensitivity of sea ice decline 
to global warming in the underlying model (Niederdrenk and Notz, 
2018); and as 19% based on a procedure to correct for biases in the 
climatological sea ice coverage in the underlying model (Sigmond et 
al., 2018). The uncertainty of the first year of the occurrence of an ice-
free Arctic Ocean arising from internal variability is estimated to be 
about 20 years (Notz, 2015; Jahn et al., 2016).
The more recent estimates of the warming necessary to produce an ice-
free Arctic Ocean during summer are lower than the ones given in AR5 
(about 2.6°C–3.1°C of global warming relative to pre-industrial levels 
or 1.6°C–2.1°C relative to present-day conditions), which were similar 
to the estimate of 3°C of global warming relative to pre-industrial 
levels (or 2°C relative to present-day conditions) by Mahlstein and 
Knutti (2012) based on bias-corrected CMIP3 models. Rosenblum and 
Eisenman (2016) explained why the sensitivity estimated by Mahlstein 
and Knutti (2012) might be too low, estimating instead that September 
sea ice in the Arctic would disappear at 2°C of global warming 
relative to pre-industrial levels (or about 1°C relative to present-day 
conditions), in line with the other recent estimates. Notz and Stroeve 
(2016) used the observed correlation between September sea ice 
extent and cumulative CO2 emissions to estimate that the Arctic Ocean 
would become nearly free of sea ice during September with a further 
1000 Gt of emissions, which also implies a sea ice loss at about 2°C of 
global warming. Some of the uncertainty in these numbers stems from 
the possible impact of aerosols (Gagne et al., 2017) and of volcanic 
forcing (Rosenblum and Eisenman, 2016). During winter, little Arctic 
sea ice is projected to be lost for either 1.5°C or 2°C of global warming 
(Niederdrenk and Notz, 2018). 
5 
Ice free is defined for the Special Report as when the sea ice extent is less than 106 km2. Ice coverage less than this is considered to be equivalent to an ice-free Arctic Ocean 
for practical purposes in all recent studies.
206
Chapter 3 
Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems

A substantial number of pre-AR5 studies found that there is no 
indication of hysteresis behaviour of Arctic sea ice under decreasing 
temperatures following a possible overshoot of a long-term 
temperature target (Holland et al., 2006; Schröder and Connolley, 2007; 
Armour et al., 2011; Sedláček et al., 2011; Tietsche et al., 2011; Boucher 
et al., 2012; Ridley et al., 2012). In particular, the relationship between 
Arctic sea ice coverage and GMST was found to be indistinguishable 
between a warming scenario and a cooling scenario. These results have 
been confirmed by post-AR5 studies (Li et al., 2013; Jahn, 2018), which 
implies high confidence that an intermediate temperature overshoot 
has no long-term consequences for Arctic sea ice coverage.
In the Antarctic, sea ice shows regionally contrasting trends, such as a 
strong decrease in sea ice coverage near the Antarctic peninsula but 
increased sea ice coverage in the Amundsen Sea (Hobbs et al., 2016). 
Averaged over these contrasting regional trends, there has been a slow 
long-term increase in overall sea ice coverage in the Southern Ocean, 
although with comparably low ice coverage from September 2016 
onwards. Collins et al. (2013) assessed low confidence in Antarctic 
sea ice projections because of the wide range of model projections 
and an inability of almost all models to reproduce observations such 
as the seasonal cycle, interannual variability and the long-term slow 
increase. No existing studies have robustly assessed the possible future 
evolution of Antarctic sea ice under low-warming scenarios.
In summary, the probability of a sea-ice-free Arctic Ocean during 
summer is substantially higher at 2°C compared to 1.5°C of global 
warming relative to pre-industrial levels, and there is medium 
confidence that there will be at least one sea ice-free Arctic summer 
after about 10 years of stabilized warming at 2°C, while about 
100 years are required at 1.5°C. There is high confidence that an 
intermediate temperature overshoot has no long-term consequences 
for Arctic sea ice coverage with regrowth on decadal time scales.
3.3.9 
Sea Level
Sea level varies over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales, which 
can be divided into three broad categories. These are global mean sea 
level (GMSL), regional variation about this mean, and the occurrence of 
sea-level extremes associated with storm surges and tides. GMSL has 
been rising since the late 19th century from the low rates of change that 
characterized the previous two millennia (Church et al., 2013). Slowing 
in the reported rate over the last two decades (Cazenave et al., 2014) 
may be attributable to instrumental drift in the observing satellite 
system (Watson et al., 2015) and increased volcanic activity (Fasullo 
et al., 2016). Accounting for the former results in rates (1993 to mid-
2014) between 2.6 and 2.9 mm yr–1 (Watson et al., 2015). The relative 
contributions from thermal expansion, glacier and ice-sheet mass loss, 
and freshwater storage on land are relatively well understood (Church 
et al., 2013; Watson et al., 2015) and their attribution is dominated by 
anthropogenic forcing since 1970 (15 ± 55% before 1950, 69 ± 31% 
after 1970) (Slangen et al., 2016).
There has been a significant advance in the literature since AR5, which 
has included the development of semi-empirical models (SEMs) into a 
broader emulation-based approach (Kopp et al., 2014; Mengel et al., 
2016; Nauels et al., 2017) that is partially based on the results from 
more detailed, process-based modelling Church et al. (2013) assigned 
low confidence to SEMs because these models assume that the 
relation between climate forcing and GMSL is the same in the past 
(calibration) and future (projection). Probable future changes in the 
relative contributions of thermal expansion, glaciers and (in particular) 
ice sheets invalidate this assumption. However, recent emulation-
based studies overcame this shortcoming by considering individual 
GMSL contributors separately, and they are therefore employed in 
this assessment. In this subsection, the process-based literature of 
individual contributors to GMSL is considered for scenarios close to 
1.5°C and 2°C of global warming before emulation-based approaches 
are assessed.
A limited number of processes-based studies are relevant to GMSL in 
1.5°C and 2°C worlds. Marzeion et al. (2018) used a global glacier model 
with temperature-scaled scenarios based on RCP2.6 to investigate 
the difference between 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming and found 
little difference between scenarios in the glacier contribution to GMSL 
for the year 2100 (54–97 mm relative to present-day levels for 1.5°C 
and 63–112 mm for 2°C, using a 90% confidence interval). This arises 
because glacier melt during the remainder of the century is dominated 
by the response to warming from pre-industrial to present-day levels, 
which is in turn a reflection of the slow response times of glaciers. Fürst 
et al. (2015) made projections of the Greenland ice sheet’s contribution 
to GMSL using an ice-flow model forced by the regional climate 
model Modèle Atmosphérique Régional (MAR; considered by Church 
et al. (2013) to be the ‘most realistic’ such model). They projected an 
RCP2.6 range of 24–60 mm (1 standard deviation) by the end of the 
century (relative to the year 2000 and consistent with the assessment 
of Church et al. (2013); however, their projections do not allow the 
difference between 1.5°C and 2°C worlds to be evaluated.
The Antarctic ice sheet can contribute both positively, through increases 
in outflow (solid ice lost directly to the ocean), and negatively, through 
increases in snowfall (owing to the increased moisture-bearing capacity 
of a warmer atmosphere), to future GMSL rise. Frieler et al. (2015) 
suggested a range of 3.5–8.7% °C–1 for this effect, which is consistent 
with AR5. Observations from the Amundsen Sea sector of Antarctica 
suggest an increase in outflow (Mouginot et al., 2014) over recent 
decades associated with grounding line retreat (Rignot et al., 2014) 
and the influx of relatively warm Circumpolar Deepwater (Jacobs et al., 
2011). Literature on the attribution of these changes to anthropogenic 
forcing is still in its infancy (Goddard et al., 2017; Turner et al., 2017a). 
RCP2.6-based projections of Antarctic outflow (Levermann et al., 
2014; Golledge et al., 2015; DeConto and Pollard, 2016, who include 
snowfall changes) are consistent with the AR5 assessment of Church 
et al. (2013) for end-of-century GMSL for RCP2.6, and do not support 
substantial additional GMSL rise by Marine Ice Sheet Instability or 
associated instabilities (see Section 3.6). While agreement is relatively 
good, concerns about the numerical fidelity of these models still exist, 
and this may affect the quality of their projections (Drouet et al., 2013; 
Durand and Pattyn, 2015). An assessment of Antarctic contributions 
beyond the end of the century, in particular related to the Marine Ice 
Sheet Instability, can be found in Section 3.6.
While some literature on process-based projections of GMSL for the 
period up to 2100 is available, it is insufficient for distinguishing 
207

Chapter 3
between emissions scenarios associated with 1.5°C and 2°C warmer 
worlds. This literature is, however, consistent with the assessment by 
Church et al. (2013) of a likely range of 0.28–0.61 m in 2100 (relative 
to 1986–2005), suggesting that the AR5 assessment is still appropriate. 
Recent emulation-based studies show convergence towards this 
AR5 assessment (Table 3.1) and offer the advantage of allowing a 
comparison between 1.5°C and 2°C warmer worlds. Table 3.1 features 
a compilation of recent emulation-based and SEM studies.

Table 3.1 | Compilation of recent projections for sea level at 2100 (in cm) for Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)2.6, and 1.5°C and 2°C scenarios. Upper and lower  
 
limits are shown for the 17-84% and 5-95% confidence intervals quoted in the original papers. 
There is little consensus between the reported ranges of GMSL rise 
(Table 3.1). Projections vary in the range 0.26–0.77 m and 0.35–0.93 
m for 1.5°C and 2°C respectively for the 17–84% confidence interval 
(0.20–0.99 m and 0.24–1.17 m for the 5–95% confidence interval). 
There is, however, medium agreement that GMSL in 2100 would be 
0.04–0.16 m higher in a 2°C warmer world compared to a 1.5°C 
warmer world based on the 17–84% confidence interval (0.00–0.24 
m based on 5–95% confidence interval) with a value of around 0.1 
m. There is medium confidence in this assessment because of issues 
associated with projections of the Antarctic contribution to GMSL 
that are employed in emulation-based studies (see above) and the 
issues previously identified with SEMs (Church et al., 2013).
Translating projections of GMSL to the scale of coastlines and 
islands requires two further steps. The first step accounts for regional 
changes associated with changing water and ice loads (such as 
Earth’s gravitational field and rotation, and vertical land movement), 
as well as spatial differences in ocean heat uptake and circulation. 
The second step maps regional sea level to changes in the return 
periods of particular flood events to account for effects not included 
in global climate models, such as tides, storm surges, and wave setup 
and runup. Kopp et al. (2014) presented a framework to do this and 
gave an example application for nine sites located in the US, Japan, 
northern Europe and Chile. Of these sites, seven (all except those in 
northern Europe) were found to experience at least a quadrupling 
in the number of years in the 21st century with 1-in-100-year floods 
under RCP2.6 compared to under no future sea level rise. Rasmussen 
et al. (2018) used this approach to investigate the difference 
between 1.5°C and 2°C warmer worlds up to 2200. They found that 
the reduction in the frequency of 1-in-100-year floods in a 1.5°C 
compared to a 2°C warmer world would be greatest in the eastern 
USA and Europe, with ESL event frequency amplification being 
reduced by about a half and with smaller reductions for small island 
developing states (SIDS). This last result contrasts with the finding 
of Vitousek et al. (2017) that regions with low variability in extreme 
water levels (such as SIDS in the tropics) are particularly sensitive to 
GMSL rise, such that a doubling of frequency may be expected for 
even small (0.1–0.2 m) rises. Schleussner et al. (2011) emulated the 
AMOC based on a subset of CMIP-class climate models. When forced 
using global temperatures appropriate for the CP3-PD scenario (1°C 
of warming in 2100 relative to 2000 or about 2°C of warming relative 
to pre-industrial) the emulation suggests an 11% median reduction 
in AMOC strength at 2100 (relative to 2000) with an associated 
0.04 m dynamic sea level rise along the New York City coastline. 
In summary, there is medium confidence that GMSL rise will be about 
0.1 m (within a 0.00–0.20 m range based on 17–84% confidence-
interval projections) less by the end of the 21st century in a 1.5°C 
compared to a 2°C warmer world. Projections for 1.5°C and 2°C 
global warming cover the ranges 0.2–0.8 m and 0.3–1.00 m relative 
to 1986–2005, respectively (medium confidence). Sea level rise 
beyond 2100 is discussed in Section 3.6; however, recent literature 
strongly supports the assessment by Church et al. (2013) that sea 
level rise will continue well beyond 2100 (high confidence).

Box 3.3 |  Lessons from Past Warm Climate Episodes 
Climate projections and associated risk assessments for a future warmer world are based on climate model simulations. However, 
Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate models do not include all existing Earth system feedbacks and 
may therefore underestimate both rates and extents of changes (Knutti and Sedláček, 2012). Evidence from natural archives of three 
moderately warmer (1.5°C–2°C) climate episodes in Earth’s past help to assess such long-term feedbacks (Fischer et al., 2018).
While evidence over the last 2000 years and during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) was discussed in detail in the IPCC Fifth 
Assessment Report (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2013), the climate system response during past warm intervals was the focus of a recent 
review paper (Fischer et al., 2018) summarized in this Box. Examples of past warmer conditions with essentially modern physical 
geography include the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM; broadly defined as about 10–5 kyr before present (BP), where present 
is defined as 1950), the Last Interglacial (LIG; about 129–116 kyr BP) and the Mid Pliocene Warm Period (MPWP; 3.3–3.0 Myr BP). 
Changes in insolation forcing during the HTM (Marcott et al., 2013) and the LIG (Hoffman et al., 2017) led to a global temperature 
up to 1°C higher than that in the pre-industrial period (1850–1900); high-latitude warming was 2°C–4°C (Capron et al., 2017), while 
temperature in the tropics changed little (Marcott et al., 2013). Both HTM and LIG experienced atmospheric CO2 levels similar to 
pre-industrial conditions (Masson-Delmotte et al. 2013). During the MPWP, the most recent time period when CO2 concentrations 
were similar to present-day levels, the global temperature was >1°C and Arctic temperatures about 8°C warmer than pre-industrial 
(Brigham-Grette et al., 2013). 
Although imperfect as analogues for the future, these regional changes can inform risk assessments such as the potential for 
crossing irreversible thresholds or amplifying anthropogenic changes (Box 3.3, Figure 1). For example, HTM and LIG greenhouse gas 
(GHG) concentrations show no evidence of runaway greenhouse gas releases under limited global warming. Transient releases of 
CO2 and CH4 may follow permafrost melting, but these occurrences may be compensated by peat growth over longer time scales (Yu 
et al., 2010). Warming may release CO2 by enhancing soil respiration, counteracting CO2 fertilization of plant growth (Frank et al., 
2010). Evidence of a collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) during these past events of limited global 
warming could not be found (Galaasen et al., 2014). 
The distribution of ecosystems and biomes (major ecosystem types) changed significantly during past warming events, both in 
the ocean and on land. For example, some tropical and temperate forests retreated because of increased aridity, while savannas 
expanded (Dowsett et al., 2016). Further, poleward shifts of marine and terrestrial ecosystems, upward shifts in alpine regions, and 
reorganizations of marine productivity during past warming events are recorded in natural archives (Williams et al., 2009; Haywood 
et al., 2016). Finally, past warming events are associated with partial sea ice loss in the Arctic. The limited amount of data collected 
so far on Antarctic sea ice precludes firm conclusions about Southern Hemisphere sea ice losses (de Vernal et al., 2013). 
Reconstructed global sea level rise of 6–9 m during the LIG and possibly >6 m during the MPWP requires a retreat of either the 
Greenland or Antarctic ice sheets or both (Dutton et al., 2015). While ice sheet and climate models suggest a substantial retreat 
of the West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS) and parts of the East Antarctic ice sheet (DeConto and Pollard, 2016) during these periods, 
direct observational evidence is still lacking. Evidence for ice retreat in Greenland is stronger, although a complete collapse of the 
Greenland ice sheet during the LIG can be excluded (Dutton et al., 2015). Rates of past sea level rises under modest warming were 
similar to or up to two times larger than rises observed over the past two decades (Kopp et al., 2013). Given the long time scales 
required to reach equilibrium in a warmer world, sea level rise will likely continue for millennia even if warming is limited to 2°C.
Finally, temperature reconstructions from these past warm intervals suggest that current climate models underestimate regional 
warming at high latitudes (polar amplification) and long-term (multi-millennial) global warming. None of these past warm climate 
episodes involved the high rate of change in atmospheric CO2 and temperatures that we are experiencing today (Fischer et al., 2018).

Ocean Chemistry 
Ocean chemistry includes pH, salinity, oxygen, CO2, and a range of other 
ions and gases, which are in turn affected by precipitation, evaporation, 
storms, river runoff, coastal erosion, up-welling, ice formation, and the 
activities of organisms and ecosystems (Stocker et al., 2013). Ocean 
chemistry is changing alongside increasing global temperature, with 
impacts projected at 1.5°C and, more so, at 2°C of global warming 
(Doney et al., 2014) (medium to high confidence). Projected changes in 
the upper layers of the ocean include altered pH, oxygen content and 
sea level. Despite its many component processes, ocean chemistry has 
been relatively stable for long periods of time prior to the industrial 
period (Hönisch et al., 2012). Ocean chemistry is changing under the 
influence of human activities and rising greenhouse gases (virtually 
certain; Rhein et al., 2013; Stocker et al., 2013). About 30% of CO2 
emitted by human activities, for example, has been absorbed by 
the upper layers of the ocean, where it has combined with water to 
produce a dilute acid that dissociates and drives ocean acidification 
(high confidence) (Cao et al., 2007; Stocker et al., 2013). Ocean pH has 
decreased by 0.1 pH units since the pre-industrial period, a shift that 
is unprecedented in the last 65 Ma (high confidence) (Ridgwell and 
Schmidt, 2010) or even 300 Ma of Earth’s history (medium confidence) 
(Hönisch et al., 2012).
Ocean acidification is a result of increasing CO2 in the atmosphere 
(very high confidence) and is most pronounced where temperatures 
are lowest (e.g., polar regions) or where CO2-rich water is brought to 
the ocean surface by upwelling (Feely et al., 2008). Acidification can 
also be influenced by effluents from natural or disturbed coastal land 
use (Salisbury et al., 2008), plankton blooms (Cai et al., 2011), and 
the atmospheric deposition of acidic materials (Omstedt et al., 2015). 
These sources may not be directly attributable to climate change, 
but they may amplify the impacts of ocean acidification (Bates and 
Peters, 2007; Duarte et al., 2013). Ocean acidification also influences 
the ionic composition of seawater by changing the organic and 
inorganic speciation of trace metals (e.g., 20-fold increases in free ion 
210

concentrations of metals such as aluminium) – with changes expected 
to have impacts although they are currently poorly documented and 
understood (low confidence) (Stockdale et al., 2016).
Oxygen varies regionally and with depth; it is highest in polar regions 
and lowest in the eastern basins of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and 
in the northern Indian Ocean (Doney et al., 2014; Karstensen et al., 
2015; Schmidtko et al., 2017). Increasing surface water temperatures 
have reduced oxygen in the ocean by 2% since 1960, with other 
variables such as ocean acidification, sea level rise, precipitation, wind 
and storm patterns playing roles (Schmidtko et al., 2017). Changes 
to ocean mixing and metabolic rates, due to increased temperature 
and greater supply of organic carbon to deep areas, has increased the 
frequency of ‘dead zones’, areas where oxygen levels are so low that 
they no longer support oxygen dependent life (Diaz and Rosenberg, 
2008). The changes are complex and include both climate change and 
other variables (Altieri and Gedan, 2015), and are increasing in tropical 
as well as temperate regions (Altieri et al., 2017). 
Ocean salinity is changing in directions that are consistent with 
surface temperatures and the global water cycle (i.e., precipitation 
versus evaporation). Some regions, such as northern oceans and the 
Arctic, have decreased in salinity, owing to melting glaciers and ice 
sheets, while others have increased in salinity, owing to higher sea 
surface temperatures and evaporation (Durack et al., 2012). These 
changes in salinity (i.e., density) are also potentially contributing to 
large-scale changes in water movement (Section 3.3.8).

Observed Impacts and Projected Risks 
in Natural and Human Systems
3.4.1 
Introduction
In Section 3.4, new literature is explored and the assessment of impacts 
and projected risks is updated for a large number of natural and 
human systems. This section also includes an exploration of adaptation 
opportunities that could be important steps towards reducing climate 
change, thereby laying the ground for later discussions on opportunities 
to tackle both mitigation and adaptation while at the same time 
recognising the importance of sustainable development and reducing 
the inequities among people and societies facing climate change.
Working Group II (WGII) of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) 
provided an assessment of the literature on the climate risk for natural 
and human systems across a wide range of environments, sectors 
and greenhouse gas scenarios, as well as for particular geographic 
regions (IPCC, 2014a, b). The comprehensive assessment undertaken 
by AR5 evaluated the evidence of changes to natural systems, and 
the impact on human communities and industry. While impacts varied 
substantially among systems, sectors and regions, many changes 
over the past 50 years could be attributed to human driven climate 
change and its impacts. In particular, AR5 attributed observed impacts 
in natural ecosystems to anthropogenic climate change, including 
changes in phenology, geographic and altitudinal range shifts in flora 
and fauna, regime shifts and increased tree mortality, all of which can 
reduce ecosystem functioning and services thereby impacting people. 
AR5 also reported increasing evidence of changing patterns of disease 
and invasive species, as well as growing risks for communities and 
industry, which are especially important with respect to sea level rise 
and human vulnerability.
One of the important themes that emerged from AR5 is that previous 
assessments may have under-estimated the sensitivity of natural and 
human systems to climate change. A more recent analysis of attribution 
213

Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems 
Chapter 3
to greenhouse gas forcing at the global scale (Hansen and Stone, 
2016) confirmed that many impacts related to changes in regional 
atmospheric and ocean temperature can be confidently attributed to 
anthropogenic forcing, while attribution to anthropogenic forcing of 
changes related to precipitation are by comparison less clear. Moreover, 
there is no strong direct relationship between the robustness of climate 
attribution and that of impact attribution (Hansen and Stone, 2016). 
The observed changes in human systems are amplified by the loss 
of ecosystem services (e.g., reduced access to safe water) that are 
supported by biodiversity (Oppenheimer et al., 2014). Limited research 
on the risks of warming of 1.5°C and 2°C was conducted following 
AR5 for most key economic sectors and services, for livelihoods and 
poverty, and for rural areas. For these systems, climate is one of many 
drivers that result in adverse outcomes. Other factors include patterns 
of demographic change, socio-economic development, trade and 
tourism. Further, consequences of climate change for infrastructure, 
tourism, migration, crop yields and other impacts interact with 
underlying vulnerabilities, such as for individuals and communities 
engaged in pastoralism, mountain farming and artisanal fisheries, to 
affect livelihoods and poverty (Dasgupta et al., 2014). 
Incomplete data and understanding of these lower-end climate 
scenarios have increased the need for more data and an improved 
understanding of the projected risks of warming of 1.5°C and 2°C for 
reference. In this section, the available literature on the projected risks, 
impacts and adaptation options is explored, supported by additional 
information and background provided in Supplementary Material 
3.SM.3.1, 3.SM.3.2, 3.SM.3.4, and 3.SM.3.5. A description of the main 
assessment methods of this chapter is given in Section 3.2.2.
3.4.2 
Freshwater Resources (Quantity and Quality)
3.4.2.1 Water availability
Working Group II of AR5 concluded that about 80% of the world’s 
population already suffers from serious threats to its water security, as 
measured by indicators including water availability, water demand and 
pollution (Jiménez Cisneros et al., 2014). UNESCO (2011) concluded 
that climate change can alter the availability of water and threaten 
water security. 
Although physical changes in streamflow and continental runoff that 
are consistent with climate change have been identified (Section 
3.3.5), water scarcity in the past is still less well understood because 
the scarcity assessment needs to take into account various factors, such 
as the operations of water supply infrastructure and human water use 
behaviour (Mehran et al., 2017), as well as green water, water quality 
and environmental flow requirements (J. Liu et al., 2017). Over the past 
century, substantial growth in populations, industrial and agricultural 
activities, and living standards have exacerbated water stress in many 
parts of the world, especially in semi-arid and arid regions such as 
California in the USA (AghaKouchak et al., 2015; Mehran et al., 2015). 
Owing to changes in climate and water consumption behaviour, and 
particularly effects of the spatial distribution of population growth 
relative to water resources, the population under water scarcity 
increased from 0.24 billion (14% of the global population) in the 
1900s to 3.8 billion (58%) in the 2000s. In that last period (2000s), 1.1 
billion people (17% of the global population) who mostly live in South 
and East Asia, North Africa and the Middle East faced serious water 
shortage and high water stress (Kummu et al., 2016).
Over the next few decades, and for increases in global mean 
temperature less than about 2°C, AR5 concluded that changes in 
population will generally have a greater effect on water resource 
availability than changes in climate. Climate change, however, will 
regionally exacerbate or offset the effects of population pressure 
(Jiménez Cisneros et al., 2014). 
The differences in projected changes to levels of runoff under 1.5°C 
and 2°C of global warming, particularly those that are regional, are 
described in Section 3.3.5. Constraining warming to 1.5°C instead 
of 2°C might mitigate the risks for water availability, although 
socio-economic drivers could affect water availability more than the 
risks posed by variation in warming levels, while the risks are not 
homogeneous among regions (medium confidence) (Gerten et al., 
2013; Hanasaki et al., 2013; Arnell and Lloyd-Hughes, 2014; Schewe et 
al., 2014; Karnauskas et al., 2018). Assuming a constant population in 
the models used in his study, Gerten et al. (2013) determined that an 
additional 8% of the world population in 2000 would be exposed to 
new or aggravated water scarcity at 2°C of global warming. This value 
was almost halved – with 50% greater reliability – when warming was 
constrained to 1.5°C. People inhabiting river basins, particularly in the 
Middle East and Near East, are projected to become newly exposed 
to chronic water scarcity even if global warming is constrained to 
less than 2°C. Many regions, especially those in Europe, Australia 
and southern Africa, appear to be affected at 1.5°C if the reduction 
in water availability is computed for non-water-scarce basins as well 
as for water-scarce regions. Out of a contemporary population of 
approximately 1.3 billion exposed to water scarcity, about 3% (North 
America) to 9% (Europe) are expected to be prone to aggravated 
scarcity at 2°C of global warming (Gerten et al., 2013). Under the 
Shared Socio-Economic Pathway (SSP)2 population scenario, about 8% 
of the global population is projected to experience a severe reduction 
in water resources under warming of 1.7°C in 2021–2040, increasing 
to 14% of the population under 2.7°C in 2043–2071, based on the 
criteria of discharge reduction of either >20% or >1 standard deviation 
(Schewe et al., 2014). Depending on the scenarios of SSP1–5, exposure 
to the increase in water scarcity in 2050 will be globally reduced by 
184–270 million people at about 1.5°C of warming compared to the 
impacts at about 2°C. However, the variation between socio-economic 
levels is larger than the variation between warming levels (Arnell and 
Lloyd-Hughes, 2014). 
On many small islands (e.g., those constituting SIDS), freshwater stress 
is expected to occur as a result of projected aridity change. Constraining 
warming to 1.5°C, however, could avoid a substantial fraction of 
water stress compared to 2°C, especially across the Caribbean region, 
particularly on the island of Hispaniola (Dominican Republic and Haiti) 
(Karnauskas et al., 2018). Hanasaki et al. (2013) concluded that the 
projected range of changes in global irrigation water withdrawal 
(relative to the baseline of 1971–2000), using human configuration 
fixing non-meteorological variables for the period around 2000, are 
1.1–2.3% and 0.6–2.0% lower at 1.5°C and 2°C, respectively. In the 
same study, Hanasaki et al. (2013) highlighted the importance of water

use scenarios in water scarcity assessments, but neither quantitative 
nor qualitative information regarding water use is available. 
When the impacts on hydropower production at 1.5°C and 2°C are 
compared, it is found that mean gross potential increases in northern, 
eastern and western Europe, and decreases in southern Europe (Jacob 
et al., 2018; Tobin et al., 2018). The Baltic and Scandinavian countries 
are projected to experience the most positive impacts on hydropower 
production. Greece, Spain and Portugal are expected to be the most 
negatively impacted countries, although the impacts could be reduced 
by limiting warming to 1.5°C (Tobin et al., 2018). In Greece, Spain and 
Portugal, warming of 2°C is projected to decrease hydropower potential 
below 10%, while limiting global warming to 1.5°C would keep the 
reduction to 5% or less. There is, however, substantial uncertainty 
associated with these results due to a large spread between the 
climate models (Tobin et al., 2018).
Due to a combination of higher water temperatures and reduced 
summer river flows, the usable capacity of thermoelectric power plants 
using river water for cooling is expected to reduce in all European 
countries (Jacob et al., 2018; Tobin et al., 2018), with the magnitude 
of decreases being about 5% for 1.5°C and 10% for 2°C of global 
warming for most European countries (Tobin et al., 2018). Greece, 
Spain and Bulgaria are projected to have the largest reduction at 2°C 
of warming (Tobin et al., 2018).
Fricko et al. (2016) assessed the direct water use of the global energy 
sector across a broad range of energy system transformation pathways 
in order to identify the water impacts of a 2°C climate policy. This 
study revealed that there would be substantial divergence in water 
withdrawal for thermal power plant cooling under conditions in which 
the distribution of future cooling technology for energy generation is 
fixed, whereas adopting alternative cooling technologies and water 
resources would make the divergence considerably smaller.
3.4.2.2 Extreme hydrological events (floods and droughts)
Working Group II of AR5 concluded that socio-economic losses from 
flooding since the mid-20th century have increased mainly because 
of greater exposure and vulnerability (high confidence) (Jiménez 
Cisneros et al., 2014). There was low confidence due to limited 
evidence, however, that anthropogenic climate change has affected 
the frequency and magnitude of floods. WGII AR5 also concluded that 
there is no evidence that surface water and groundwater drought 
frequency has changed over the last few decades, although impacts 
of drought have increased mostly owing to increased water demand 
(Jiménez Cisneros et al., 2014).
Since AR5, the number of studies related to fluvial flooding and 
meteorological drought based on long-term observed data has been 
gradually increasing. There has also been progress since AR5 in 
identifying historical changes in streamflow and continental runoff 
(Section 3.3.5). As a result of population and economic growth, 
increased exposure of people and assets has caused more damage 
due to flooding. However, differences in flood risks among regions 
reflect the balance among the magnitude of the flood, the populations, 
their vulnerabilities, the value of assets affected by flooding, and the 
capacity to cope with flood risks, all of which depend on socio-economic 
development conditions, as well as topography and hydro-climatic 
conditions (Tanoue et al., 2016). AR5 concluded that there was low 
confidence in the attribution of global changes in droughts (Bindoff et 
al., 2013b). However, recent publications based on observational and 
modelling evidence assessed that human emissions have substantially 
increased the probability of drought years in the Mediterranean region 
(Section 3.3.4).
WGII AR5 assessed that global flood risk will increase in the future, 
partly owing to climate change (low to medium confidence), with 
projected changes in the frequency of droughts longer than 12 months 
being more uncertain because of their dependence on accumulated 
precipitation over long periods (Jiménez Cisneros et al., 2014).
Increases in the risks associated with runoff at the global scale 
(medium confidence), and in flood hazard in some regions (medium 
confidence), can be expected at global warming of 1.5°C, with an 
overall increase in the area affected by flood hazard at 2°C (medium 
confidence) (Section 3.3.5). There are studies, however, that indicate 
that socio-economic conditions will exacerbate flood impacts 
more than global climate change, and that the magnitude of these 
impacts could be larger in some regions (Arnell and Lloyd-Hughes, 
2014; Winsemius et al., 2016; Alfieri et al., 2017; Arnell et al., 2018; 
Kinoshita et al., 2018). Assuming constant population sizes, countries 
representing 73% of the world population will experience increasing 
flood risk, with an average increase of 580% at 4°C compared to the 
impact simulated over the baseline period 1976–2005. This impact 
is projected to be reduced to a 100% increase at 1.5°C and a 170% 
increase at 2°C (Alfieri et al., 2017). Alfieri et al. (2017) additionally 
concluded that the largest increases in flood risks would be found in 
the US, Asia, and Europe in general, while decreases would be found in 
only a few countries in eastern Europe and Africa. Overall, Alfieri et al. 
(2017) reported that the projected changes are not homogeneously 
distributed across the world land surface. Alfieri et al. (2018) studied 
the population affected by flood events using three case studies in 
European states, specifically central and western Europe, and found 
that the population affected could be limited to 86% at 1.5°C of 
warming compared to 93% at 2°C. Under the SSP2 population 
scenario, Arnell et al. (2018) found that 39% (range 36–46%) of 
impacts on populations exposed to river flooding globally could be 
avoided at 1.5°C compared to 2°C of warming. 
Under scenarios SSP1–5, Arnell and Lloyd-Hughes (2014) found 
that the number of people exposed to increased flooding in 2050 
under warming of about 1.5°C could be reduced by 26–34 million 
compared to the number exposed to increased flooding associated 
with 2°C of warming. Variation between socio-economic levels, 
however, is projected to be larger than variation between the two 
levels of global warming. Kinoshita et al. (2018) found that a serious 
increase in potential flood fatality (5.7%) is projected without any 
adaptation if global warming increases from 1.5°C to 2°C, whereas 
the projected increase in potential economic loss (0.9%) is relatively 
small. Nevertheless, their study indicates that socio-economic changes 
make a larger contribution to the potentially increased consequences 
of future floods, and about half of the increase in potential economic 
losses could be mitigated by autonomous adaptation.

Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems 
Chapter 3
There is limited information about the global and regional 
projected risks posed by droughts at 1.5°C and 2°C of global 
warming. However, hazards by droughts at 1.5°C could be reduced 
compared to the hazards at 2°C in some regions, in particular in the 
Mediterranean region and southern Africa (Section 3.3.4). Under 
constant socio-economic conditions, the population exposed to 
drought at 2°C of warming is projected to be larger than at 1.5°C 
(low to medium confidence) (Smirnov et al., 2016; Sun et al., 2017; 
Arnell et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018). Under the same scenario, the 
global mean monthly number of people expected to be exposed to 
extreme drought at 1.5°C in 2021–2040 is projected to be 114.3 
million, compared to 190.4 million at 2°C in 2041–2060 (Smirnov et 
al., 2016). Under the SSP2 population scenario, Arnell et al. (2018) 
projected that 39% (range 36–51%) of impacts on populations 
exposed to drought could be globally avoided at 1.5°C compared 
to 2°C warming.
Liu et al. (2018) studied the changes in population exposure to severe 
droughts in 27 regions around the globe for 1.5°C and 2°C of warming 
using the SSP1 population scenario compared to the baseline period 
of 1986–2005 based on the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). 
They concluded that the drought exposure of urban populations in 
most regions would be decreased at 1.5°C (350.2 ± 158.8 million 
people) compared to 2°C (410.7 ± 213.5 million people). Liu et al. 
(2018) also suggested that more urban populations would be exposed 
to severe droughts at 1.5°C in central Europe, southern Europe, the 
Mediterranean, West Africa, East and West Asia, and Southeast Asia, 
and that number of affected people would increase further in these 
regions at 2°C. However, it should be noted that the PDSI is known 
to have limitations (IPCC SREX, Seneviratne et al., 2012), and drought 
projections strongly depend on considered indices (Section 3.3.4); thus 
only medium confidence is assigned to these projections. In the Haihe 
River basin in China, a study has suggested that the proportion of the 
population exposed to droughts is projected to be reduced by 30.4% 
at 1.5°C but increased by 74.8% at 2°C relative to the baseline value 
of 339.65 million people in the 1986–2005 period, when assessing 
changes in droughts using the Standardized Precipitation-Evaporation 
Index, using a Penman–Monteith estimate of potential evaporation 
(Sun et al., 2017) .
Alfieri et al. (2018) estimated damage from flooding in Europe for 
the baseline period (1976–2005) at 5 billion euro of losses annually, 
with projections of relative changes in flood impacts that will rise with 
warming levels, from 116% at 1.5°C to 137% at 2°C.
Kinoshita et al. (2018) studied the increase of potential economic loss 
under SSP3 and projected that the smaller loss at 1.5°C compared 
to 2°C (0.9%) is marginal, regardless of whether the vulnerability is 
fixed at the current level or not. By analysing the differences in results 
with and without flood protection standards, Winsemius et al. (2016) 
showed that adaptation measures have the potential to greatly reduce 
present-day and future flood damage. They concluded that increases in 
flood-induced economic impacts (% gross domestic product, GDP) in 
African countries are mainly driven by climate change and that Africa’s 
growing assets would become increasingly exposed to floods. Hence, 
there is an increasing need for long-term and sustainable investments 
in adaptation in Africa. 
3.4.2.3 Groundwater
Working Group II of AR5 concluded that the detection of changes in 
groundwater systems, and attribution of those changes to climatic 
changes, are rare, owing to a lack of appropriate observation wells 
and an overall small number of studies (Jiménez Cisneros et al., 2014).
Since AR5, the number of studies based on long-term observed data 
continues to be limited. The groundwater-fed lakes in northeastern 
central Europe have been affected by climate and land-use changes, 
and they showed a predominantly negative lake-level trend in 1999–
2008 (Kaiser et al., 2014).
WGII AR5 concluded that climate change is projected to reduce 
groundwater resources significantly in most dry subtropical regions 
(high confidence) (Jiménez Cisneros et al., 2014).
In some regions, groundwater is often intensively used to supplement 
the excess demand, often leading to groundwater depletion. Climate 
change adds further pressure on water resources and exaggerates 
human water demands by increasing temperatures over agricultural 
lands (Wada et al., 2017). Very few studies have projected the risks of 
groundwater depletion under 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming. Under 
2°C of warming, impacts posed on groundwater are projected to be 
greater than at 1.5°C (low confidence) (Portmann et al., 2013; Salem 
et al., 2017). 
Portmann et al. (2013) indicated that 2% (range 1.1–2.6%) of the 
global land area is projected to suffer from an extreme decrease in 
renewable groundwater resources of more than 70% at 2°C, with a 
clear mitigation at 1.5°C. These authors also projected that 20% of 
the global land surface would be affected by a groundwater reduction 
of more than 10% at 1.5°C of warming, with the percentage of land 
impacted increasing at 2°C. In a groundwater-dependent irrigated 
region in northwest Bangladesh, the average groundwater level during 
the major irrigation period (January–April) is projected to decrease in 
accordance with temperature rise (Salem et al., 2017).
3.4.2.4 Water quality
Working Group II of AR5 concluded that most observed changes to 
water quality from climate change are from isolated studies, mostly 
of rivers or lakes in high-income countries, using a small number of 
variables (Jiménez Cisneros et al., 2014). AR5 assessed that climate 
change is projected to reduce raw water quality, posing risks to 
drinking water quality with conventional treatment (medium to high 
confidence) (Jiménez Cisneros et al., 2014).
Since AR5, studies have detected climate change impacts on several 
indices of water quality in lakes, watersheds and regions (e.g., Patiño 
et al., 2014; Aguilera et al., 2015; Watts et al., 2015; Marszelewski 
and Pius, 2016; Capo et al., 2017). The number of studies utilising 
RCP scenarios at the regional or watershed scale have gradually 
increased since AR5 (e.g., Boehlert et al., 2015; Teshager et al., 2016; 
Marcinkowski et al., 2017). Few studies, have explored projected 
impacts on water quality under 1.5°C versus 2°C of warming, 
however, the differences are unclear (low confidence) (Bonte and 
216
Chapter 3 
Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems
3
Zwolsman, 2010; Hosseini et al., 2017). The daily probability of 
exceeding the chloride standard for drinking water taken from Lake 
IJsselmeer (Andijk, the Netherlands) is projected to increase by 
a factor of about five at 2°C relative to the present-day warming 
level of 1°C since 1990 (Bonte and Zwolsman, 2010). Mean monthly 
dissolved oxygen concentrations and nutrient concentrations in 
the upper Qu’Appelle River (Canada) in 2050–2055 are projected 
to decrease less at about 1.5°C of warming (RCP2.6) compared to 
concentrations at about 2°C (RCP4.5) (Hosseini et al., 2017). In three 
river basins in Southeast Asia (Sekong, Sesan and Srepok), about 2°C 
of warming (corresponding to a 1.05°C increase in the 2030s relative 
to the baseline period 1981–2008, RCP8.5), impacts posed by land-
use change on water quality are projected to be greater than at 1.5°C 
(corresponding to a 0.89°C increase in the 2030s relative to the 
baseline period 1981–2008, RCP4.5) (Trang et al., 2017). Under the 
same warming scenarios, Trang et al. (2017) projected changes in the 
annual nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) yields in the 2030s, as well as 
with combinations of two land-use change scenarios: (i) conversion 
of forest to grassland, and (ii) conversion of forest to agricultural 
land. The projected changes in N (P) yield are +7.3% (+5.1%) under 
a 1.5°C scenario and –6.6% (–3.6%) under 2°C, whereas changes 
under the combination of land-use scenarios are (i) +5.2% (+12.6%) 
at 1.5°C and +8.8% (+11.7%) at 2°C, and (ii) +7.5% (+14.9%) at 
1.5°C and +3.7% (+8.8%) at 2°C (Trang et al., 2017). 
3.4.2.5 Soil erosion and sediment load
Working Group II of AR5 concluded that there is little or no 
observational evidence that soil erosion and sediment load have been 
altered significantly by climate change (low to medium confidence) 
(Jiménez Cisneros et al., 2014). As the number of studies on climate 
change impacts on soil erosion has increased where rainfall is an 
important driver (Lu et al., 2013), studies have increasingly considered 
other factors, such as rainfall intensity (e.g., Shi and Wang, 2015; 
Li and Fang, 2016), snow melt, and change in vegetation cover 
resulting from temperature rise (Potemkina and Potemkin, 2015), 
as well as crop management practices (Mullan et al., 2012). WGII 
AR5 concluded that increases in heavy rainfall and temperature are 
projected to change soil erosion and sediment yield, although the 
extent of these changes is highly uncertain and depends on rainfall 
seasonality, land cover, and soil management practices (Jiménez 
Cisneros et al., 2014).
While the number of published studies of climate change impacts on 
soil erosion have increased globally since 2000 (Li and Fang, 2016), 
few articles have addressed impacts at 1.5°C and 2°C of global 
warming. The existing studies have found few differences in projected 
risks posed on sediment load under 1.5°C and 2°C (low confidence) 
(Cousino et al., 2015; Shrestha et al., 2016). The differences between 
average annual sediment load under 1.5°C and 2°C of warming are 
not clear, owing to complex interactions among climate change, land 
cover/surface and soil management (Cousino et al., 2015; Shrestha 
et al., 2016). Averages of annual sediment loads are projected to 
be similar under 1.5°C and 2°C of warming, in particular in the 
Great Lakes region in the USA and in the Lower Mekong region in 
Southeast Asia (Cross-Chapter Box 6 in this chapter, Cousino et al., 
2015; Shrestha et al., 2016). 
3.4.3 
Terrestrial and Wetland Ecosystems 
3.4.3.1 Biome shifts 
Latitudinal and elevational shifts of biomes (major ecosystem 
types) in boreal, temperate and tropical regions have been detected 
(Settele et al., 2014) and new studies confirm these changes (e.g., 
shrub encroachment on tundra; Larsen et al., 2014). Attribution 
studies indicate that anthropogenic climate change has made a 
greater contribution to these changes than any other factor (medium 
confidence) (Settele et al., 2014). 
An ensemble of seven Dynamic Vegetation Models driven by projected 
climates from 19 alternative general circulation models (GCMs) 
(Warszawski et al., 2013) shows 13% (range 8–20%) of biomes 
transforming at 2°C of global warming, but only 4% (range 2–7%) 
doing so at 1°C, suggesting that about 6.5% may be transformed at 
1.5°C; these estimates indicate a doubling of the areal extent of biome 
shifts between 1.5°C and 2°C of warming (medium confidence) (Figure 
3.16a). A study using the single ecosystem model LPJmL (Gerten et 
al., 2013) illustrated that biome shifts in the Arctic, Tibet, Himalayas, 
southern Africa and Australia would be avoided by constraining 
warming to 1.5°C compared with 2°C (Figure 3.16b). Seddon et al. 
(2016) quantitatively identified ecologically sensitive regions to climate 
change in most of the continents from tundra to tropical rainforest. 
Biome transformation may in some cases be associated with novel 
climates and ecological communities (Prober et al., 2012). 
3.4.3.2 Changes in phenology
Advancement in spring phenology of 2.8 ± 0.35 days per decade has 
been observed in plants and animals in recent decades in most Northern 
Hemisphere ecosystems (between 30°N and 72°N), and these shifts 
have been attributed to changes in climate (high confidence) (Settele 
et al., 2014). The rates of change are particularly high in the Arctic 
zone owing to the stronger local warming (Oberbauer et al., 2013), 
whereas phenology in tropical forests appears to be more responsive 
to moisture stress (Zhou et al., 2014). While a full review cannot be 
included here, trends consistent with this earlier finding continue to 
be detected, including in the flowering times of plants (Parmesan 
and Hanley, 2015), in the dates of egg laying and migration in birds 
(newly reported in China; Wu and Shi, 2016), in the emergence dates 
of butterflies (Roy et al., 2015), and in the seasonal greening-up of 
vegetation as detected by satellites (i.e., in the normalized difference 
vegetation index, NDVI; Piao et al., 2015).
The potential for decoupling species–species interactions owing to 
differing phenological responses to climate change is well established 
(Settele et al., 2014), for example for plants and their insect pollinators 
(Willmer, 2012; Scaven and Rafferty, 2013). Mid-century projections 
of plant and animal phenophases in the UK clearly indicate that 
the timing of phenological events could change more for primary 
consumers (6.2 days earlier on average) than for higher trophic 
levels (2.5–2.9 days earlier on average) (Thackeray et al., 2016). This 
indicates the potential for phenological mismatch and associated 
risks for ecosystem functionality in the future under global warming 
of 2.1°C–2.7°C above pre-industrial levels. Further, differing responses

could alter community structure in temperate forests (Roberts et al., 
2015). Specifically, temperate forest phenology is projected to advance 
by 14.3 days in the near term (2010–2039) and 24.6 days in the 
medium term (2040–2069), so as a first approximation the difference 
between 2°C and 1.5°C of global warming is about 10 days (Roberts et 
al., 2015). This phenological plasticity is not always adaptive and must 
be interpreted cautiously (Duputié et al., 2015), and considered in the 
context of accompanying changes in climate variability (e.g., increased 
risk of frost damage for plants or earlier emergence of insects resulting in 
mortality during cold spells). Another adaptive response of some plants is 
range expansion with increased vigour and altered herbivore resistance 
in their new range, analogous to invasive plants (Macel et al., 2017).
In summary, limiting warming to 1.5°C compared with 2°C may avoid 
advance in spring phenology (high confidence) by perhaps a few days 
(medium confidence) and hence decrease the risks of loss of ecosystem 
functionality due to phenological mismatch between trophic levels, 
and also of maladaptation coming from the sensitivity of many species 
to increased climate variability. Nevertheless, this difference between 
1.5°C and 2°C of warming might be limited for plants that are able to 
expand their range. 
3.4.3.3 Changes in species range, abundance and extinction 
AR5 (Settele et al., 2014) concluded that the geographical ranges of 
many terrestrial and freshwater plant and animal species have moved 
over the last several decades in response to warming: approximately 17 
km poleward and 11 m up in altitude per decade. Recent trends confirm 
this finding; for example, the spatial and interspecific variance in bird 
populations in Europe and North America since 1980 were found to be 
well predicted by trends in climate suitability (Stephens et al., 2016). 
Further, a recent meta-analysis of 27 studies concerning a total of 976 
species (Wiens, 2016) found that 47% of local extinctions (extirpations) 
reported across the globe during the 20th century could be attributed to 
climate change, with significantly more extinctions occurring in tropical 
regions, in freshwater habitats and for animals. IUCN (2018) lists 305 
terrestrial animal and plant species from Pacific Island developing nations 
as being threatened by climate change and severe weather. Owing 
to lags in the responses of some species to climate change, shifts in 
insect pollinator ranges may result in novel assemblages with unknown 
implications for biodiversity and ecosystem function (Rafferty, 2017).
Warren et al. (2013) simulated climatically determined geographic range 
loss under 2°C and 4°C of global warming for 50,000 plant and animal 
species, accounting for uncertainty in climate projections and for the 
potential ability of species to disperse naturally in an attempt to track their 
geographically shifting climate envelope. This earlier study has now been 
updated and expanded to incorporate 105,501 species, including 19,848 
insects, and new findings indicate that warming of 2°C by 2100 would 
lead to projected bioclimatic range losses of >50% in 18% (6–35%) of 
the 19,848 insects species, 8% (4–16%) of the 12,429 vertebrate species, 
and 16% (9–28%) of the 73,224 plant species studied (Warren et al., 
2018a). At 1.5°C of warming, these values fall to 6% (1–18%) of the 
insects, 4% (2–9%) of the vertebrates and 8% (4–15%) of the plants 
studied. Hence, the number of insect species projected to lose over half 
of their geographic range is reduced by two-thirds when warming is 
limited to 1.5°C compared with 2°C, while the number of vertebrate 
and plant species projected to lose over half of their geographic range 
is halved (Warren et al., 2018a) (medium confidence). These findings are 
consistent with estimates made from an earlier study suggesting that 
range losses at 1.5°C were significantly lower for plants than those at 
2°C of warming (Smith et al., 2018). It should be noted that at 1.5°C 
of warming, and if species’ ability to disperse naturally to track their 
preferred climate geographically is inhibited by natural or anthropogenic 
obstacles, there would still remain 10% of the amphibians, 8% of the 
reptiles, 6% of the mammals, 5% of the birds, 10% of the insects and 
8% of the plants which are projected to lose over half their range, while 
species on average lose 20–27% of their range (Warren et al., 2018a). 
Given that bird and mammal species can disperse more easily than 
amphibians and reptiles, a small proportion can expand their range 
as climate changes, but even at 1.5°C of warming the total range loss 
integrated over all birds and mammals greatly exceeds the integrated 
range gain (Warren et al., 2018a).
A number of caveats are noted for studies projecting changes to climatic 
range. This approach, for example, does not incorporate the effects of 
extreme weather events and the role of interactions between species. 
As well, trophic interactions may locally counteract the range expansion 
of species towards higher altitudes (Bråthen et al., 2018). There is also 
the potential for highly invasive species to become established in new 
areas as the climate changes (Murphy and Romanuk, 2014), but there is 
no literature that quantifies this possibility for 1.5°C of global warming.
Pecl et al. (2017) summarized at the global level the consequences 
of climate-change-induced species redistribution for economic 
development, livelihoods, food security, human health and culture. 
These authors concluded that even if anthropogenic greenhouse gas 
emissions stopped today, the effort for human systems to adapt to 
the most crucial effects of climate-driven species redistribution will 
be far-reaching and extensive. For example, key insect crop pollinator 
families (Apidae, Syrphidae and Calliphoridae; i.e., bees, hoverflies 
and blowflies) are projected to retain significantly greater geographic 
ranges under 1.5°C of global warming compared with 2°C (Warren 
et al., 2018a). In some cases, when species (such as pest and disease 
species) move into areas which have become climatically suitable 
they may become invasive or harmful to human or natural systems 
(Settele et al., 2014). Some studies are beginning to locate ‘refugial’ 
areas where the climate remains suitable in the future for most of the 
species currently present. For example, Smith et al. (2018) estimated 
that 5.5–14% more of the globe’s terrestrial land area could act as 
climatic refugia for plants under 1.5°C of warming compared to 2°C. 
There is no literature that directly estimates the proportion of species at 
increased risk of global (as opposed to local) commitment to extinction 
as a result of climate change, as this is inherently difficult to quantify. 
However, it is possible to compare the proportions of species at risk 
of very high range loss; for example, a discernibly smaller number of 
terrestrial species are projected to lose over 90% of their range at 
1.5°C of global warming compared with 2°C (Figure 2 in Warren et 
al., 2018a). A link between very high levels of range loss and greatly 
increased extinction risk may be inferred (Urban, 2015). Hence, limiting 
global warming to 1.5°C compared with 2°C would be expected to 
reduce both range losses and associated extinction risks in terrestrial 
species (high confidence).

3.4.3.4 Changes in ecosystem function, biomass  
and carbon stocks
Working Group II of AR5 (Settele et al., 2014) concluded that there is 
high confidence that net terrestrial ecosystem productivity at the global 
scale has increased relative to the pre-industrial era and that rising 
CO2 concentrations are contributing to this trend through stimulation 
of photosynthesis. There is, however, no clear and consistent signal 
of a climate change contribution. In northern latitudes, the change in 
productivity has a lower velocity than the warming, possibly because of 
a lack of resource and vegetation acclimation mechanisms (M. Huang 
et al., 2017). Biomass and soil carbon stocks in terrestrial ecosystems 
are currently increasing (high confidence), but they are vulnerable to 
loss of carbon to the atmosphere as a result of projected increases in 
the intensity of storms, wildfires, land degradation and pest outbreaks 
(Settele et al., 2014; Seidl et al., 2017). These losses are expected to 
contribute to a decrease in the terrestrial carbon sink. Anderegg et al. 
(2015) demonstrated that total ecosystem respiration at the global 
scale has increased in response to increases in night-time temperature 
(1 PgC yr–1 °C–1, P=0.02). 
The increase in total ecosystem respiration in spring and autumn, 
associated with higher temperatures, may convert boreal forests 
from carbon sinks to carbon sources (Hadden and Grelle, 2016). In 
boreal peatlands, for example, increased temperature may diminish 
carbon storage and compromise the stability of the peat (Dieleman 
et al., 2016). In addition, J. Yang et al. (2015) showed that fires reduce 
the carbon sink of global terrestrial ecosystems by 0.57 PgC yr–1 in 
ecosystems with large carbon stores, such as peatlands and tropical 
forests. Consequently, for adaptation purposes, it is necessary to 
enhance carbon sinks, especially in forests which are prime regulators 
within the water, energy and carbon cycles (Ellison et al., 2017). Soil can 
also be a key compartment for substantial carbon sequestration (Lal, 
2014; Minasny et al., 2017), depending on the net biome productivity 
and the soil quality (Bispo et al., 2017). 
AR5 assessed that large uncertainty remains regarding the land carbon 
cycle behaviour of the future (Ciais et al., 2013), with most, but not all, 
CMIP5 models simulating continued terrestrial carbon uptake under 
all four RCP scenarios (Jones et al., 2013). Disagreement between 
models outweighs differences between scenarios even up to the year 
2100 (Hewitt et al., 2016; Lovenduski and Bonan, 2017). Increased 
atmospheric CO2 concentrations are expected to drive further increases 
in the land carbon sink (Ciais et al., 2013; Schimel et al., 2015), which 
could persist for centuries (Pugh et al., 2016). Nitrogen, phosphorus and 
other nutrients will limit the terrestrial carbon cycle response to both 
elevated CO2 and altered climate (Goll et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2014; 
Wieder et al., 2015; Zaehle et al., 2015; Ellsworth et al., 2017). Climate 
change may accelerate plant uptake of carbon (Gang et al., 2015) 
but also increase the rate of decomposition (Todd-Brown et al., 2014; 
Koven et al., 2015; Crowther et al., 2016). Ahlström et al. (2012) found 
a net loss of carbon in extra-tropical regions and the largest spread 
across model results in the tropics. The projected net effect of climate 
change is to reduce the carbon sink expected under CO2 increase alone 
(Settele et al., 2014). Friend et al. (2014) found substantial uptake of 
carbon by vegetation under future scenarios when considering the 
effects of both climate change and elevated CO2.
There is limited published literature examining modelled land carbon 
changes specifically under 1.5°C of warming, but existing CMIP5 
models and published data are used in this report to draw some 
conclusions. For systems with significant inertia, such as vegetation or 
soil carbon stores, changes in carbon storage will depend on the rate 
of change of forcing and thus depend on the choice of scenario (Jones 
et al., 2009; Ciais et al., 2013; Sihi et al., 2017). To avoid legacy effects 
of the choice of scenario, this report focuses on the response of gross 
primary productivity (GPP) – the rate of photosynthetic carbon uptake 
– by the models, rather than by changes in their carbon store. 
Figure 3.17 shows different responses of the terrestrial carbon cycle 
to climate change in different regions. The models show a consistent 
response of increased GPP in temperate latitudes of approximately 2 
GtC yr–1 °C–1. Similarly, Gang et al. (2015) projected a robust increase 
in the net primary productivity (NPP) of temperate forests. However, 
Ahlström et al. (2012) showed that this effect could be offset or reversed 
by increases in decomposition. Globally, most models project that GPP 
will increase or remain approximately unchanged (Hashimoto et al., 
2013). This projection is supported by findings by Sakalli et al. (2017) 
for Europe using Euro-CORDEX regional models under a 2°C global 
warming for the period 2034–2063, which indicated that storage 
will increase by 5% in soil and by 20% in vegetation. However, using 
the same models Jacob et al. (2018) showed that limiting warming 
to 1.5°C instead of 2°C avoids an increase in ecosystem vulnerability 
(compared to a no-climate change scenario) of 40–50%. 
At the global level, linear scaling is acceptable for net primary production, 
biomass burning and surface runoff, and impacts on terrestrial carbon 
storage are projected to be greater at 2°C than at 1.5°C (Tanaka et 
al., 2017). If global CO2 concentrations and temperatures stabilize, or 
peak and decline, then both land and ocean carbon sinks – which are 
primarily driven by the continued increase in atmospheric CO2 – will 
also decline and may even become carbon sources (Jones et al., 2016). 
Consequently, if a given amount of anthropogenic CO2 is removed from 
the atmosphere, an equivalent amount of land and ocean anthropogenic 
CO2 will be released to the atmosphere (Cao and Caldeira, 2010). 
In conclusion, ecosystem respiration is expected to increase with 
increasing temperature, thus reducing soil carbon storage. Soil carbon 
storage is expected to be larger if global warming is restricted to 
1.5°C, although some of the associated changes will be countered by 
enhanced gross primary production due to elevated CO2 concentrations 
(i.e., the ‘fertilization effect’) and higher temperatures, especially at 
mid- and high latitudes (medium confidence). 
3.4.3.5 Regional and ecosystem-specific risks 
A large number of threatened systems, including mountain 
ecosystems, highly biodiverse tropical wet and dry forests, deserts, 
freshwater systems and dune systems, were assessed in AR5. These 
include Mediterranean areas in Europe, Siberian, tropical and desert 
ecosystems in Asia, Australian rainforests, the Fynbos and succulent 
Karoo areas of South Africa, and wetlands in Ethiopia, Malawi, Zambia 
and Zimbabwe. In all these systems, it has been shown that impacts 
accrue with greater warming, and thus impacts at 2°C are expected to 
be greater than those at 1.5°C (medium confidence).

Figure 3.17 |  The response of terrestrial productivity (gross primary productivity, GPP) to climate change, globally (top left) and for three latitudinal regions: 30°S–30°N; 
30–60°N and 60–90°N. Data come from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) archive (http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5/). Seven Earth System 
Models were used: Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM-ME, yellow); Community Earth System Model (CESM, red); Institute Pierre Simon Laplace (IPLS)-CM5-LR (dark 
blue); Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL, pale blue); Max Plank Institute-Earth System Model (MPI-ESM, pink); Hadley Centre New Global Environmental Model 
2-Earth System (HadGEM2-ES, orange); and Canadian Earth System Model 2 (CanESM2, green). Differences in GPP between model simulations with (‘1pctCO2’) and without 
(‘esmfixclim1’) the effects of climate change are shown. Data are plotted against the global mean temperature increase above pre-industrial levels from simulations with a 1% 
per year increase in CO2 (‘1pctCO2’). 
The High Arctic region, with tundra-dominated landscapes, has warmed 
more than the global average over the last century (Section 3.3; Settele 
et al., 2014). The Arctic tundra biome is experiencing increasing fire 
disturbance and permafrost degradation (Bring et al., 2016; DeBeer et 
al., 2016; Jiang et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2016). Both of these processes 
facilitate the establishment of woody species in tundra areas. Arctic 
terrestrial ecosystems are being disrupted by delays in winter onset 
and mild winters associated with global warming (high confidence) 
(Cooper, 2014). Observational constraints suggest that stabilization 
at 1.5°C of warming would avoid the thawing of approximately 1.5 
to 2.5 million km2 of permafrost (medium confidence) compared 
with stabilization at 2°C (Chadburn et al., 2017), but the time scale 
for release of thawed carbon as CO2 or CH4 should be many centuries 
(Burke et al., 2017). In northern Eurasia, the growing season length is 
projected to increase by about 3–12 days at 1.5°C and 6–16 days at 
2°C of warming (medium confidence) (Zhou et al., 2018). Aalto et al. 
(2017) predicted a 72% reduction in cryogenic land surface processes 
in northern Europe for RCP2.6 in 2040–2069 (corresponding to a global 
warming of approximately 1.6°C), with only slightly larger losses for 
RCP4.5 (2°C of global warming). 
Projected impacts on forests as climate change occurs include increases 
in the intensity of storms, wildfires and pest outbreaks (Settele et al., 
2014), potentially leading to forest dieback (medium confidence). 
Warmer and drier conditions in particular facilitate fire, drought and insect 
disturbances, while warmer and wetter conditions increase disturbances 
from wind and pathogens (Seidl et al., 2017). Particularly vulnerable 
regions are Central and South America, Mediterranean Basin, South 
Africa, South Australia where the drought risk will increase (see Figure 
3.12). Including disturbances in simulations may influence productivity 
changes in European forests in response to climate change (Reyer et 
al., 2017b). There is additional evidence for the attribution of increased 
forest fire frequency in North America to anthropogenic climate change 
during 1984–2015, via the mechanism of increasing fuel aridity almost 
doubling the western USA forest fire area compared to what would 
have been expected in the absence of climate change (Abatzoglou and 
Williams, 2016). This projection is in line with expected fire risks, which 
indicate that fire frequency could increase over 37.8% of the global land 
area during 2010–2039 (Moritz et al., 2012), corresponding to a global 
warming level of approximately 1.2°C, compared with over 61.9% of 
the global land area in 2070–2099, corresponding to a warming of 
221

Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems 
Chapter 3
approximately 3.5°C.6 The values in Table 26-1 in a recent paper by 
Romero-Lankao et al. (2014) also indicate significantly lower wildfire 
risks in North America for near-term warming (2030–2040, considered a 
proxy for 1.5°C of warming) than at 2°C (high confidence).
The Amazon tropical forest has been shown to be close to its climatic 
limits (Hutyra et al., 2005), but this threshold may move under elevated 
CO2 (Good et al., 2011). Future changes in rainfall, especially dry season 
length, will determine responses of the Amazon forest (Good et al., 
2013). The forest may be especially vulnerable to combined pressure 
from multiple stressors, namely changes in climate and continued 
anthropogenic disturbance (Borma et al., 2013; Nobre et al., 2016). 
Modelling (Huntingford et al., 2013) and observational constraints 
(Cox et al., 2013) suggest that large-scale forest dieback is less likely 
than suggested under early coupled modelling studies (Cox et al., 2000; 
Jones et al., 2009). Nobre et al. (2016) estimated a climatic threshold of 
4°C of warming and a deforestation threshold of 40%. 
In many places around the world, the savanna boundary is moving 
into former grasslands. Woody encroachment, including increased 
tree cover and biomass, has increased over the past century, owing 
to changes in land management, rising CO2 levels, and climate 
variability and change (often in combination) (Settele et al., 2014). For 
plant species in the Mediterranean region, shifts in phenology, range 
contraction and health decline have been observed with precipitation 
decreases and temperature increases (medium confidence) (Settele 
et al., 2014). Recent studies using independent complementary 
approaches have shown that there is a regional-scale threshold in the 
Mediterranean region between 1.5°C and 2°C of warming (Guiot and 
Cramer, 2016; Schleussner et al., 2016b). Further, Guiot and Cramer 
(2016) concluded that biome shifts unprecedented in the last 10,000 
years can only be avoided if global warming is constrained to 1.5°C 
(medium confidence) – whilst 2°C of warming will result in a decrease 
of 12–15% of the Mediterranean biome area. The Fynbos biome in 
southwestern South Africa is vulnerable to the increasing impact of 
fires under increasing temperatures and drier winters. It is projected 
to lose about 20%, 45% and 80% of its current suitable climate area 
under 1°C, 2°C and 3°C of global warming, respectively, compared to 
1961–1990 (high confidence) (Engelbrecht and Engelbrecht, 2016). In 
Australia, an increase in the density of trees and shrubs at the expense 
of grassland species is occurring across all major ecosystems and is 
projected to be amplified (NCCARF, 2013). Regarding Central America, 
Lyra et al. (2017) showed that the tropical rainforest biomass would be 
reduced by about 40% under global warming of 3°C, with considerable 
replacement by savanna and grassland. With a global warming of close 
to 1.5°C in 2050, a biomass decrease of 20% is projected for tropical 
rainforests of Central America (Lyra et al., 2017). If a linear response is 
assumed, this decrease may reach 30% (medium confidence). 
Freshwater ecosystems are considered to be among the most threatened 
on the planet (Settele et al., 2014). Although peatlands cover only about 
3% of the land surface, they hold one-third of the world’s soil carbon 
stock (400 to 600 Pg) (Settele et al., 2014). When drained, this carbon 
is released to the atmosphere. At least 15% of peatlands have drained, 
mostly in Europe and Southeast Asia, and are responsible for 5% of 
human derived CO2 emissions (Green and Page, 2017). Moreover, in the 
Congo basin (Dargie et al., 2017) and in the Amazonian basin (Draper et 
al., 2014), the peatlands store the equivalent carbon as that of a tropical 
forest. However, stored carbon is vulnerable to land-use change and 
future risk of drought, for example in northeast Brazil (high confidence) 
(Figure 3.12, Section 3.3.4.2). At the global scale, these peatlands are 
undergoing rapid major transformations through drainage and burning 
in preparation for oil palm and other crops or through unintentional 
burning (Magrin et al., 2014). Wetland salinization, a widespread 
threat to the structure and ecological functioning of inland and coastal 
wetlands, is occurring at a high rate and large geographic scale (Section 
3.3.6; Herbert et al., 2015). Settele et al. (2014) found that rising water 
temperatures are projected to lead to shifts in freshwater species 
distributions and worsen water quality. Some of these ecosystems 
respond non-linearly to changes in temperature. For example, Johnson 
and Poiani (2016) found that the wetland function of the Prairie Pothole 
region in North America is projected to decline at temperatures beyond 
a local warming of 2°C–3°C above present-day values (1°C local 
warming, corresponding to 0.6°C of global warming). If the ratio of local 
to global warming remains similar for these small levels of warming, 
this would indicate a global temperature threshold of 1.2°C–1.8°C 
of warming. Hence, constraining global warming to approximately 
1.5°C would maintain the functioning of prairie pothole ecosystems in 
terms of their productivity and biodiversity, although a 20% increase 
of precipitation could offset 2°C of global warming (high confidence) 
(Johnson and Poiani, 2016).
3.4.3.6 Summary of implications for ecosystem services 
In summary, constraining global warming to 1.5°C rather than 2°C 
has strong benefits for terrestrial and wetland ecosystems and their 
services (high confidence). These benefits include avoidance or 
reduction of changes such as biome transformations, species range 
losses, increased extinction risks (all high confidence) and changes 
in phenology (high confidence), together with projected increases 
in extreme weather events which are not yet factored into these 
analyses (Section 3.3). All of these changes contribute to disruption of 
ecosystem functioning and loss of cultural, provisioning and regulating 
services provided by these ecosystems to humans. Examples of such 
services include soil conservation (avoidance of desertification), flood 
control, water and air purification, pollination, nutrient cycling, sources 
of food, and recreation. 
3.4.4 
Ocean Ecosystems
The ocean plays a central role in regulating atmospheric gas 
concentrations, global temperature and climate. It also provides 
habitat to a large number of organisms and ecosystems that provide 
goods and services worth trillions of USD per year (e.g., Costanza et 
al., 2014; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2015). Together with local stresses 
(Halpern et al., 2015), climate change poses a major threat to an 
increasing number of ocean ecosystems (e.g., warm water or tropical 
coral reefs: virtually certain, WGII AR5) and consequently to many 
6 
The approximate temperatures are derived from Figure 10.5a in Meehl et al. (2007), which indicates an ensemble average projection of 0.7°C or 3°C above 1980–1999 
temperatures, which were already 0.5°C above pre-industrial values.

coastal communities that depend on marine resources for food, 
livelihoods and a safe place to live. Previous sections of this report 
have described changes in the ocean, including rapid increases 
in ocean temperature down to a depth of at least 700 m (Section 
3.3.7). In addition, anthropogenic carbon dioxide has decreased 
ocean pH and affected the concentration of ions in seawater such 
as carbonate (Sections 3.3.10 and 3.4.4.5), both over a similar depth 
range. Increased ocean temperatures have intensified storms in some 
regions (Section 3.3.6), expanded the ocean volume and increased 
sea levels globally (Section 3.3.9), reduced the extent of polar 
summer sea ice (Section 3.3.8), and decreased the overall solubility 
of the ocean for oxygen (Section 3.3.10). Importantly, changes in the 
response to climate change rarely operate in isolation. Consequently, 
the effect of global warming of 1.5°C versus 2°C must be considered 
in the light of multiple factors that may accumulate and interact over 
time to produce complex risks, hazards and impacts on human and 
natural systems.
3.4.4.1 Observed impacts 
Physical and chemical changes to the ocean resulting from increasing 
atmospheric CO2 and other GHGs are already driving significant changes 
to ocean systems (very high confidence) and will continue to do so at 
1.5°C, and more so at 2°C, of global warming above pre-industrial 
temperatures (Section 3.3.11). These changes have been accompanied 
by other changes such as ocean acidification, intensifying storms and 
deoxygenation (Levin and Le Bris, 2015). Risks are already significant 
at current greenhouse gas concentrations and temperatures, and they 
vary significantly among depths, locations and ecosystems, with impacts 
being singular, interactive and/or cumulative (Boyd et al., 2015).
3.4.4.2 Warming and stratification of the surface ocean 
As atmospheric greenhouse gases have increased, the global mean 
surface temperature (GMST) has reached about 1°C above the pre-
industrial period, and oceans have rapidly warmed from the ocean 
surface to the deep sea (high confidence) (Sections 3.3.7; Hughes 
and Narayanaswamy, 2013; Levin and Le Bris, 2015; Yasuhara and 
Danovaro, 2016; Sweetman et al., 2017). Marine organisms are 
already responding to these changes by shifting their biogeographical 
ranges to higher latitudes at rates that range from approximately 0 
to 40 km yr–1 (Burrows et al., 2014; Chust, 2014; Bruge et al., 
2016; Poloczanska et al., 2016), which has consequently affected 
the structure and function of the ocean, along with its biodiversity 
and foodwebs (high confidence). Movements of organisms does 
not necessarily equate to the movement of entire ecosystems. For 
example, species of reef-building corals have been observed to shift 
their geographic ranges, yet this has not resulted in the shift of entire 
coral ecosystems (high confidence) (Woodroffe et al., 2010; Yamano 
et al., 2011). In the case of ‘less mobile’ ecosystems (e.g., coral reefs, 
kelp forests and intertidal communities), shifts in biogeographical 
ranges may be limited, with mass mortalities and disease outbreaks 
increasing in frequency as the exposure to extreme temperatures 
increases (very high confidence) (Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999; Garrabou 
et al., 2009; Rivetti et al., 2014; Maynard et al., 2015; Krumhansl et 
al., 2016; Hughes et al., 2017b; see also Box 3.4). These trends are 
projected to become more pronounced at warming of 1.5°C, and 
more so at 2°C, above the pre-industrial period (Hoegh-Guldberg et 
al., 2007; Donner, 2009; Frieler et al., 2013; Horta E Costa et al., 2014; 
Vergés et al., 2014, 2016; Zarco-Perello et al., 2017) and are likely to 
result in decreases in marine biodiversity at the equator but increases 
in biodiversity at higher latitudes (Cheung et al., 2009; Burrows et 
al., 2014).
While the impacts of species shifting their ranges are mostly negative 
for human communities and industry, there are instances of short-
term gains. Fisheries, for example, may expand temporarily at high 
latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere as the extent of summer sea ice 
recedes and NPP increases (medium confidence) (Cheung et al., 2010; 
Lam et al., 2016; Weatherdon et al., 2016). High-latitude fisheries are 
not only influenced by the effect of temperature on NPP but are also 
strongly influenced by the direct effects of changing temperatures on 
fish and fisheries (Section 3.4.4.9; Barange et al., 2014; Pörtner et al., 
2014; Cheung et al., 2016b; Weatherdon et al., 2016). Temporary gains 
in the productivity of high-latitude fisheries are offset by a growing 
number of examples from low and mid-latitudes where increases in 
sea temperature are driving decreases in NPP, owing to the direct 
effects of elevated temperatures and/or reduced ocean mixing from 
reduced ocean upwelling, that is, increased stratification (low-medium 
confidence) (Cheung et al., 2010; Ainsworth et al., 2011; Lam et al., 
2012, 2014, 2016; Bopp et al., 2013; Boyd et al., 2014; Chust et al., 2014; 
Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014; Poloczanska et al., 2014; Pörtner et al., 
2014; Signorini et al., 2015). Reduced ocean upwelling has implications 
for millions of people and industries that depend on fisheries for food 
and livelihoods (Bakun et al., 2015; FAO, 2016; Kämpf and Chapman, 
2016), although there is low confidence in the projection of the size 
of the consequences at 1.5°C. It is also important to appreciate these 
changes in the context of large-scale ocean processes such as the 
ocean carbon pump. The export of organic carbon to deeper layers of 
the ocean increases as NPP changes in the surface ocean, for example, 
with implications for foodwebs and oxygen levels (Boyd et al., 2014; 
Sydeman et al., 2014; Altieri and Gedan, 2015; Bakun et al., 2015; 
Boyd, 2015).
3.4.4.3 Storms and coastal runoff 
Storms, wind, waves and inundation can have highly destructive impacts 
on ocean and coastal ecosystems, as well as the human communities 
that depend on them (IPCC, 2012; Seneviratne et al., 2012). The intensity 
of tropical cyclones across the world’s oceans has increased, although the 
overall number of tropical cyclones has remained the same or decreased 
(medium confidence) (Section 3.3.6; Elsner et al., 2008; Holland and 
Bruyère, 2014). The direct force of wind and waves associated with 
larger storms, along with changes in storm direction, increases the risks 
of physical damage to coastal communities and to ecosystems such as 
mangroves (low to medium confidence) (Long et al., 2016; Primavera et 
al., 2016; Villamayor et al., 2016; Cheal et al., 2017) and tropical coral 
reefs (De’ath et al., 2012; Bozec et al., 2015; Cheal et al., 2017). These 
changes are associated with increases in maximum wind speed, wave 
height and the inundation, although trends in these variables vary from 
region to region (Section 3.3.5). In some cases, this can lead to increased 
exposure to related impacts, such as flooding, reduced water quality and 
increased sediment runoff (medium-high confidence) (Brodie et al., 2012; 
Wong et al., 2014; Anthony, 2016; AR5, Table 5.1). 
223

Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems 
Chapter 3
Sea level rise also amplifies the impacts of storms and wave action 
(Section 3.3.9), with robust evidence that storm surges and damage 
are already penetrating farther inland than a few decades ago, 
changing conditions for coastal ecosystems and human communities. 
This is especially true for small islands (Box 3.5) and low-lying coastal 
communities, where issues such as storm surges can transform coastal 
areas (Section 3.4.5; Brown et al., 2018a). Changes in the frequency of 
extreme events, such as an increase in the frequency of intense storms, 
have the potential (along with other factors, such as disease, food web 
changes, invasive organisms and heat stress-related mortality; Burge 
et al., 2014; Maynard et al., 2015; Weatherdon et al., 2016; Clements 
et al., 2017) to overwhelm the capacity for natural and human systems 
to recover following disturbances. This has recently been seen for key 
ecosystems such as tropical coral reefs (Box 3.4), which have changed 
from coral-dominated ecosystems to assemblages dominated by other 
organisms such as seaweeds, with changes in associated organisms 
and ecosystem services (high confidence) (De’ath et al., 2012; Bozec et 
al., 2015; Cheal et al., 2017; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2017; Hughes et al., 
2017a, b). The impacts of storms are amplified by sea level rise (Section 
3.4.5), leading to substantial challenges today and in the future for 
cities, deltas and small island states in particular (Sections 3.4.5.2 to 
3.4.5.4), as well as for coastlines and their associated ecosystems 
(Sections 3.4.5.5 to 3.4.5.7).
3.4.4.4 Ocean circulation 
The movement of water within the ocean is essential to its biology 
and ecology, as well to the circulation of heat, water and nutrients 
around the planet (Section 3.3.7). The movement of these factors 
drives local and regional climates, as well as primary productivity and 
food production. Firmly attributing recent changes in the strength and 
direction of ocean currents to climate change, however, is complicated 
by long-term patterns and variability (e.g., Pacific decadal oscillation, 
PDO; Signorini et al., 2015) and a lack of records that match the long-
term nature of these changes in many cases (Lluch-Cota et al., 2014). An 
assessment of the literature since AR5 (Sydeman et al., 2014), however, 
concluded that (overall) upwelling-favourable winds have intensified 
in the California, Benguela and Humboldt upwelling systems, but 
have weakened in the Iberian system and have remained neutral in 
the Canary upwelling system in over 60 years of records (1946–2012) 
(medium confidence). These conclusions are consistent with a growing 
consensus that wind-driven upwelling systems are likely to intensify 
under climate change in many upwelling systems (Sydeman et al., 
2014; Bakun et al., 2015; Di Lorenzo, 2015), with potentially positive 
and negative consequences (Bakun et al., 2015). 
Changes in ocean circulation can have profound impacts on marine 
ecosystems by connecting regions and facilitating the entry and 
establishment of species in areas where they were unknown before (e.g., 
‘tropicalization’ of temperate ecosystems; Wernberg et al., 2012; Vergés 
et al., 2014, 2016; Zarco-Perello et al., 2017), as well as the arrival of novel 
disease agents (low-medium confidence) (Burge et al., 2014; Maynard 
et al., 2015; Weatherdon et al., 2016). For example, the herbivorous sea 
urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii has been reached Tasmania from the 
Australian mainland, where it was previously unknown, owing to a 
strengthening of the East Australian Current (EAC) that connects the 
two regions (high confidence) (Ling et al., 2009). As a consequence, the 
distribution and abundance of kelp forests has rapidly decreased, with 
implications for fisheries and other ecosystem services (Ling et al., 2009). 
These risks to marine ecosystems are projected to become greater at 
1.5°C, and more so at 2°C (medium confidence) (Cheung et al., 2009; 
Pereira et al., 2010; Pinsky et al., 2013; Burrows et al., 2014). 
Changes to ocean circulation can have even larger influence in terms of 
scale and impacts. Weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning 
Circulation (AMOC), for example, is projected to be highly disruptive to 
natural and human systems as the delivery of heat to higher latitudes 
via this current system is reduced (Collins et al., 2013). Evidence of 
a slowdown of AMOC has increased since AR5 (Smeed et al., 2014; 
Rahmstorf et al., 2015a, b; Kelly et al., 2016), yet a strong causal 
connection to climate change is missing (low confidence) (Section 
3.3.7).
3.4.4.5 Ocean acidification 
Ocean chemistry encompasses a wide range of phenomena and chemical 
species, many of which are integral to the biology and ecology of the 
ocean (Section 3.3.10; Gattuso et al., 2014, 2015; Hoegh-Guldberg et 
al., 2014; Pörtner et al., 2014). While changes to ocean chemistry are 
likely to be of central importance, the literature on how climate change 
might influence ocean chemistry over the short and long term is limited 
(medium confidence). By contrast, numerous risks from the specific 
changes associated with ocean acidification have been identified (Dove 
et al., 2013; Kroeker et al., 2013; Pörtner et al., 2014; Gattuso et al., 
2015; Albright et al., 2016), with the consensus that resulting changes 
to the carbonate chemistry of seawater are having, and are likely to 
continue to have, fundamental and substantial impacts on a wide variety 
of organisms (high confidence). Organisms with shells and skeletons 
made out of calcium carbonate are particularly at risk, as are the early 
life history stages of a large number of organisms and processes such 
as de-calcification, although there are some taxa that have not shown 
high-sensitivity to changes in CO2, pH and carbonate concentrations 
(Dove et al., 2013; Fang et al., 2013; Kroeker et al., 2013; Pörtner et 
al., 2014; Gattuso et al., 2015). Risks of these impacts also vary with 
latitude and depth, with the greatest changes occurring at high latitudes 
as well as deeper regions. The aragonite saturation horizon (i.e., where 
concentrations of calcium and carbonate fall below the saturation point 
for aragonite, a key crystalline form of calcium carbonate) is decreasing 
with depth as anthropogenic CO2 penetrates deeper into the ocean over 
time. Under many models and scenarios, the aragonite saturation is 
projected to reach the surface by 2030 onwards, with a growing list of 
impacts and consequences for ocean organisms, ecosystems and people 
(Orr et al., 2005; Hauri et al., 2016).
Further, it is difficult to reliably separate the impacts of ocean warming 
and acidification. As ocean waters have increased in sea surface 
temperature (SST) by approximately 0.9°C they have also decreased 
by 0.2 pH units since 1870–1899 (‘pre-industrial’; Table 1 in Gattuso et 
al., 2015; Bopp et al., 2013). As CO2 concentrations continue to increase 
along with other GHGs, pH will decrease while sea temperature will 
increase, reaching 1.7°C and a decrease of 0.2 pH units (by 2100 
under RCP4.5) relative to the pre-industrial period. These changes are 
likely to continue given the negative correlation of temperature and 
pH. Experimental manipulation of CO2, temperature and consequently 
224
Chapter 3

acidification indicate that these impacts will continue to increase in 
size and scale as CO2 and SST continue to increase in tandem (Dove et 
al., 2013; Fang et al., 2013; Kroeker et al., 2013).
While many risks have been defined through laboratory and mesocosm 
experiments, there is a growing list of impacts from the field (medium 
confidence) that include community-scale impacts on bacterial 
assemblages and processes (Endres et al., 2014), coccolithophores 
(K.J.S. Meier et al., 2014), pteropods and polar foodwebs (Bednaršek et 
al., 2012, 2014), phytoplankton (Moy et al., 2009; Riebesell et al., 2013; 
Richier et al., 2014), benthic ecosystems (Hall-Spencer et al., 2008; 
Linares et al., 2015), seagrass (Garrard et al., 2014), and macroalgae 
(Webster et al., 2013; Ordonez et al., 2014), as well as excavating 
sponges, endolithic microalgae and reef-building corals (Dove et al., 
2013; Reyes-Nivia et al., 2013; Fang et al., 2014), and coral reefs (Box 
3.4; Fabricius et al., 2011; Allen et al., 2017). Some ecosystems, such as 
those from bathyal areas (i.e., 200–3000 m below the surface), are likely 
to undergo very large reductions in pH by the year 2100 (0.29 to 0.37 
pH units), yet evidence of how deep-water ecosystems will respond is 
currently limited despite the potential planetary importance of these 
areas (low to medium confidence) (Hughes and Narayanaswamy, 
2013; Sweetman et al., 2017).
3.4.4.6 Deoxygenation 
Oxygen levels in the ocean are maintained by a series of processes 
including ocean mixing, photosynthesis, respiration and solubility 
(Boyd et al., 2014, 2015; Pörtner et al., 2014; Breitburg et al., 2018). 
Concentrations of oxygen in the ocean are declining (high confidence) 
owing to three main factors related to climate change: (i) heat-related 
stratification of the water column (less ventilation and mixing), (ii) 
reduced oxygen solubility as ocean temperature increases, and (iii) 
impacts of warming on biological processes that produce or consume 
oxygen such as photosynthesis and respiration (high confidence) (Bopp 
et al., 2013; Pörtner et al., 2014; Altieri and Gedan, 2015; Deutsch et 
al., 2015; Schmidtko et al., 2017; Shepherd et al., 2017; Breitburg et 
al., 2018). Further, a range of processes (Section 3.4.11) are acting 
synergistically, including factors not related to climate change, such 
as runoff and coastal eutrophication (e.g., from coastal farming 
and intensive aquaculture). These changes can lead to increased 
phytoplankton productivity as a result of the increased concentration 
of dissolved nutrients. Increased supply of organic carbon molecules 
from coastal run-off can also increase the metabolic activity of coastal 
microbial communities (Altieri and Gedan, 2015; Bakun et al., 2015; 
Boyd, 2015). Deep sea areas are likely to experience some of the 
greatest challenges, as abyssal seafloor habitats in areas of deep-water 
formation are projected to experience decreased water column oxygen 
concentrations by as much as 0.03 mL L–1 by 2100 (Levin and Le Bris, 
2015; Sweetman et al., 2017). 
The number of ‘dead zones’ (areas where oxygenated waters have 
been replaced by hypoxic conditions) has been growing strongly 
since the 1990s (Diaz and Rosenberg, 2008; Altieri and Gedan, 2015; 
Schmidtko et al., 2017). While attribution can be difficult because of 
the complexity of the processes involved, both related and unrelated 
to climate change, some impacts associated to deoxygenation (low-
medium confidence) include the expansion of oxygen minimum 
zones (OMZ) (Turner et al., 2008; Carstensen et al., 2014; Acharya and 
Panigrahi, 2016; Lachkar et al., 2018), physiological impacts (Pörtner 
et al., 2014), and mortality and/or displacement of oxygen dependent 
organisms such as fish (Hamukuaya et al., 1998; Thronson and Quigg, 
2008; Jacinto, 2011) and invertebrates (Hobbs and Mcdonald, 2010; 
Bednaršek et al., 2016; Seibel, 2016; Altieri et al., 2017). In addition, 
deoxygenation interacts with ocean acidification to present substantial 
separate and combined challenges for fisheries and aquaculture 
(medium confidence) (Hamukuaya et al., 1998; Bakun et al., 2015; 
Rodrigues et al., 2015; Feely et al., 2016; S. Li et al., 2016; Asiedu et al., 
2017a; Clements and Chopin, 2017; Clements et al., 2017; Breitburg et 
al., 2018). Deoxygenation is expected to have greater impacts as ocean 
warming and acidification increase (high confidence), with impacts 
being larger and more numerous than today (e.g., greater challenges 
for aquaculture and fisheries from hypoxia), and as the number of 
hypoxic areas continues to increase. Risks from deoxygenation are 
virtually certain to increase as warming continues, although our 
understanding of risks at 1.5°C versus 2°C is incomplete (medium 
confidence). Reducing coastal pollution, and consequently the 
penetration of organic carbon into deep benthic habitats, is expected 
to reduce the loss of oxygen in coastal waters and hypoxic areas in 
general (high confidence) (Breitburg et al., 2018). 
3.4.4.7 Loss of sea ice 
Sea ice is a persistent feature of the planet’s polar regions (Polyak et al., 
2010) and is central to marine ecosystems, people (e.g., food, culture 
and livelihoods) and industries (e.g., fishing, tourism, oil and gas, and 
shipping). Summer sea ice in the Arctic, however, has been retreating 
rapidly in recent decades (Section 3.3.8), with an assessment of the 
literature revealing that a fundamental transformation is occurring 
in polar organisms and ecosystems, driven by climate change (high 
confidence) (Larsen et al., 2014). These changes are strongly affecting 
people in the Arctic who have close relationships with sea ice and 
associated ecosystems, and these people are facing major adaptation 
challenges as a result of sea level rise, coastal erosion, the accelerated 
thawing of permafrost, changing ecosystems and resources, and many 
other issues (Ford, 2012; Ford et al., 2015). 
There is considerable and compelling evidence that a further increase 
of 0.5°C beyond the present-day average global surface temperature 
will lead to multiple levels of impact on a variety of organisms, from 
phytoplankton to marine mammals, with some of the most dramatic 
changes occurring in the Arctic Ocean and western Antarctic Peninsula 
(Turner et al., 2014, 2017b; Steinberg et al., 2015; Piñones and Fedorov, 
2016). 
The impacts of climate change on sea ice are part of the focus 
of the IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a 
Changing Climate (SROCC), due to be released in 2019, and hence 
are not covered comprehensively here. However, there is a range of 
responses to the loss of sea ice that are occurring and which increase 
at 1.5°C and further so with 2°C of global warming. Some of these 
changes are described briefly here. Photosynthetic communities, 
such macroalgae, phytoplankton and microalgae dwelling on the 
underside of floating sea ice are changing, owing to increased 
temperatures, light and nutrient levels. As sea ice retreats, mixing of 
225

Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems 
Chapter 3
the water column increases, and phototrophs have increased access 
to seasonally high levels of solar radiation (medium confidence) 
(Dalpadado et al., 2014; W.N. Meier et al., 2014). These changes are 
expected to stimulate fisheries productivity in high-latitude regions 
by mid-century (high confidence) (Cheung et al., 2009, 2010, 2016b; 
Lam et al., 2014), with evidence that this is already happening for 
several high-latitude fisheries in the Northern Hemisphere, such as the 
Bering Sea, although these ‘positive’ impacts may be relatively short-
lived (Hollowed and Sundby, 2014; Sundby et al., 2016). In addition to 
the impact of climate change on fisheries via impacts on net primary 
productivity (NPP), there are also direct effects of temperature on 
fish, which may in turn have a range of impacts (Pörtner et al., 2014). 
Sea ice in Antarctica is undergoing changes that exceed those seen 
in the Arctic (Maksym et al., 2011; Reid et al., 2015), with increases 
in sea ice coverage in the western Ross Sea being accompanied by 
strong decreases in the Bellingshausen and Amundsen Seas (Hobbs 
et al., 2016). While Antarctica is not permanently populated, the 
ramifications of changes to the productivity of vast regions, such 
as the Southern Ocean, have substantial implications for ocean 
foodwebs and fisheries globally.
3.4.4.8 Sea level rise 
Mean sea level is increasing (Section 3.3.9), with substantial impacts 
already being felt by coastal ecosystems and communities (Wong et 
al., 2014) (high confidence). These changes are interacting with other 
factors, such as strengthening storms, which together are driving larger 
storm surges, infrastructure damage, erosion and habitat loss (Church et 
al., 2013; Stocker et al., 2013; Blankespoor et al., 2014). Coastal wetland 
ecosystems such as mangroves, sea grasses and salt marshes are under 
pressure from rising sea level (medium confidence) (Section 3.4.5; Di 
Nitto et al., 2014; Ellison, 2014; Lovelock et al., 2015; Mills et al., 2016; 
Nicholls et al., 2018), as well as from a wide range of other risks and 
impacts unrelated to climate change, with the ongoing loss of wetlands 
recently estimated at approximately 1% per annum across a large 
number of countries (Blankespoor et al., 2014; Alongi, 2015). While some 
ecosystems (e.g., mangroves) may be able to shift shoreward as sea levels 
increase, coastal development (e.g., buildings, seawalls and agriculture) 
often interrupts shoreward shifts, as well as reducing sediment supplies 
down some rivers (e.g., dams) due to coastal development (Di Nitto et al., 
2014; Lovelock et al., 2015; Mills et al., 2016). 
Responses to sea level rise challenges for ocean and coastal systems 
include reducing the impact of other stresses, such as those arising 
from tourism, fishing, coastal development, reduced sediment 
supply and unsustainable aquaculture/agriculture, in order to build 
ecological resilience (Hossain et al., 2015; Sutton-Grier and Moore, 
2016; Asiedu et al., 2017a). The available literature largely concludes 
that these impacts will intensify under a 1.5°C warmer world but will 
be even higher at 2°C, especially when considered in the context of 
changes occurring beyond the end of the current century. In some 
cases, restoration of coastal habitats and ecosystems may be a cost-
effective way of responding to changes arising from increasing levels 
of exposure to rising sea levels, intensifying storms, coastal inundation 
and salinization (Section 3.4.5 and Box 3.5; Arkema et al., 2013), 
although limitations of these strategies have been identified (e.g., 
Lovelock et al., 2015; Weatherdon et al., 2016). 
3.4.4.9 Projected risks and adaptation options for oceans under 
global warming of 1.5°C or 2°C above pre-industrial levels
A comprehensive discussion of risk and adaptation options for all 
natural and human systems is not possible in the context and length 
of this report, and hence the intention here is to illustrate key risks 
and adaptation options for ocean ecosystems and sectors. This 
assessment builds on the recent expert consensus of Gattuso et al. 
(2015) by assessing new literature from 2015–2017 and adjusting 
the levels of risk from climate change in the light of literature since 
2014. The original expert group’s assessment (Supplementary Material 
3.SM.3.2) was used as input for this new assessment, which focuses 
on the implications of global warming of 1.5°C as compared to 2°C. A 
discussion of potential adaptation options is also provided, the details 
of which will be further explored in later chapters of this special report. 
The section draws on the extensive analysis and literature presented in 
the Supplementary Material of this report (3.SM.3.2, 3.SM.3.3) and has 
a summary in Figures 3.18 and 3.20 which outline the added relative 
risks of climate change. 
3.4.4.10  Framework organisms (tropical corals, mangroves 
and seagrass)
Marine organisms (‘ecosystem engineers’), such as seagrass, kelp, 
oysters, salt marsh species, mangroves and corals, build physical 
structures or frameworks (i.e., sea grass meadows, kelp forests, oyster 
reefs, salt marshes, mangrove forests and coral reefs) which form the 
habitat for a large number of species (Gutiérrez et al., 2012). These 
organisms in turn provide food, livelihoods, cultural significance, and 
services such as coastal protection to human communities (Bell et al., 
2011, 2018; Cinner et al., 2012; Arkema et al., 2013; Nurse et al., 2014; 
Wong et al., 2014; Barbier, 2015; Bell and Taylor, 2015; Hoegh-Guldberg 
et al., 2015; Mycoo, 2017; Pecl et al., 2017).
Risks of climate change impacts for seagrass and mangrove ecosystems 
were recently assessed by an expert group led by Short et al. (2016). 
Impacts of climate change were assessed to be similar across a range 
of submerged and emerged plants. Submerged plants such as sea-
grass were affected mostly by temperature extremes (Arias-Ortiz et al., 
2018), and indirectly by turbidity, while emergent communities such 
as mangroves and salt marshes were most susceptible to sea level 
variability and temperature extremes, which is consistent with other 
evidence (Di Nitto et al., 2014; Sierra-Correa and Cantera Kintz, 2015; 
Osorio et al., 2016; Sasmito et al., 2016), especially in the context of 
human activities that reduce sediment supply (Lovelock et al., 2015) 
or interrupt the shoreward movement of mangroves though the 
construction of coastal infrastructure. This in turn leads to ‘coastal 
squeeze’ where coastal ecosystems are trapped between changing 
ocean conditions and coastal infrastructure (Mills et al., 2016). 
Projections of the future distribution of seagrasses suggest a poleward 
shift, which raises concerns that low-latitude seagrass communities 
may contract as a result of increasing stress levels (Valle et al., 2014).
Climate change (e.g., sea level rise, heat stress, storms) presents risk 
for coastal ecosystems such as seagrass (high confidence) and reef-
building corals (very high confidence) (Figure 3.18, Supplementary 
Material 3.SM.3.2), with evidence of increasing concern since AR5 and

the conclusion that tropical corals may be even more vulnerable to 
climate change than indicated in assessments made in 2014 (Hoegh-
Guldberg et al., 2014; Gattuso et al., 2015). The current assessment 
also considered the heatwave-related loss of 50% of shallow-water 
corals across hundreds of kilometres of the world’s largest continuous 
coral reef system, the Great Barrier Reef. These large-scale impacts, 
plus the observation of back-to-back bleaching events on the Great 
Barrier Reef (predicted two decades ago, Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999) and 
arriving sooner than predicted (Hughes et al., 2017b, 2018), suggest 
that the research community may have underestimated climate risks 
for coral reefs (Figure 3.18). The general assessment of climate risks for 
mangroves prior to this special report was that they face greater risks 
from deforestation and unsustainable coastal development than from 
climate change (Alongi, 2008; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014; Gattuso et 
al., 2015). Recent large-scale die-offs (Duke et al., 2017; Lovelock et al., 
2017), however, suggest that risks from climate change may have been 
underestimated for mangroves as well. With the events of the last past 
three years in mind, risks are now considered to be undetectable to 
moderate (i.e., moderate risks now start at 1.3°C as opposed to 1.8°C; 
medium confidence). Consequently, when average global warming 
reaches 1.3°C above pre-industrial levels, the risk of climate change to 
mangroves are projected to be moderate (Figure 3.18) while tropical 
coral reefs will have reached a high level of risk as examplified by 
increasing damage from heat stress since the early 1980s. At global 
warming of 1.8°C above pre-industrial levels, seagrasses are projected 
to reach moderate to high levels of risk (e.g., damage resulting from 
sea level rise, erosion, extreme temperatures, and storms), while risks 
to mangroves from climate change are projected to remain moderate 
(e.g., not keeping up with sea level rise, and more frequent heat stress 
mortality) although there is low certainty as to when or if this important 
ecosystem is likely to transition to higher levels of additional risk from 
climate change (Figure 3.18).
Warm water (tropical) coral reefs are projected to reach a very high 
risk of impact at 1.2°C (Figure 3.18), with most available evidence 
suggesting that coral-dominated ecosystems will be non-existent at this 
temperature or higher (high confidence). At this point, coral abundance 
will be near zero at many locations and storms will contribute to 
‘flattening’ the three-dimensional structure of reefs without recovery, 
as already observed for some coral reefs (Alvarez-Filip et al., 2009). The 
impacts of warming, coupled with ocean acidification, are expected 
to undermine the ability of tropical coral reefs to provide habitat for 
thousand of species, which together provide a range of ecosystem 
services (e.g., food, livelihoods, coastal protection, cultural services) 
that are important for millions of people (high confidence) (Burke et 
al., 2011).
Strategies for reducing the impact of climate change on framework 
organisms include reducing stresses not directly related to climate 
change (e.g., coastal pollution, overfishing and destructive coastal 
development) in order to increase their ecological resilience in the face 
of accelerating climate change impacts (World Bank, 2013; Ellison, 
2014; Anthony et al., 2015; Sierra-Correa and Cantera Kintz, 2015; 
Kroon et al., 2016; O’Leary et al., 2017), as well as protecting locations 
where organisms may be more robust (Palumbi et al., 2014) or less 
exposed to climate change (Bongaerts et al., 2010; van Hooidonk et 
al., 2013; Beyer et al., 2018). This might involve cooler areas due to 
upwelling, or involve deep-water locations that experience less extreme 
conditions and impacts. Given the potential value of such locations for 
promoting the survival of coral communities under climate change, 
efforts to prevent their loss resulting from other stresses are important 
(Bongaerts et al., 2010, 2017; Chollett et al., 2010, 2014; Chollett and 
Mumby, 2013; Fine et al., 2013; van Hooidonk et al., 2013; Cacciapaglia 
and van Woesik, 2015; Beyer et al., 2018). A full understanding of 
the role of refugia in reducing the loss of ecosystems has yet to be 
developed (low to medium confidence). There is also interest in ex 
situ conservation approaches involving the restoration of corals via 
aquaculture (Shafir et al., 2006; Rinkevich, 2014) or the use of ‘assisted 
evolution’ to help corals adapt to changing sea temperatures (van 
Oppen et al., 2015, 2017), although there are numerous challenges 
that must be surpassed if these approaches are to be cost-effective 
responses to preserving coral reefs under rapid climate change (low 
confidence) (Hoegh-Guldberg, 2012, 2014a; Bayraktarov et al., 2016).
High levels of adaptation are expected to be required to prevent 
impacts on food security and livelihoods in coastal populations 
(medium confidence). Integrating coastal infrastructure with changing 
ecosystems such as mangroves, seagrasses and salt marsh, may offer 
adaptation strategies as they shift shoreward as sea levels rise (high 
confidence). Maintaining the sediment supply to coastal areas would 
also assist mangroves in keeping pace with sea level rise (Shearman et 
al., 2013; Lovelock et al., 2015; Sasmito et al., 2016). For this reason, 
habitat for mangroves can be strongly affected by human actions such 
as building dams which reduce the sediment supply and hence the 
ability of mangroves to escape ‘drowning’ as sea level rises (Lovelock 
et al., 2015). In addition, integrated coastal zone management should 
recognize the importance and economic expediency of using natural 
ecosystems such as mangroves and tropical coral reefs to protect 
coastal human communities (Arkema et al., 2013; Temmerman et al., 
2013; Ferrario et al., 2014; Hinkel et al., 2014; Elliff and Silva, 2017). 
Adaptation options include developing alternative livelihoods and 
food sources, ecosystem-based management/adaptation such as 
ecosystem restoration, and constructing coastal infrastructure that 
reduces the impacts of rising seas and intensifying storms (Rinkevich, 
2015; Weatherdon et al., 2016; Asiedu et al., 2017a; Feller et al., 
2017). Clearly, these options need to be carefully assessed in terms 
of feasibility, cost and scalability, as well as in the light of the coastal 
ecosystems involved (Bayraktarov et al., 2016).
3.4.4.11  Ocean foodwebs (pteropods, bivalves, krill and fin fish)
Ocean foodwebs are vast interconnected systems that transfer solar 
energy and nutrients from phytoplankton to higher trophic levels, 
including apex predators and commercially important species such 
as tuna. Here, we consider four representative groups of marine 
organisms which are important within foodwebs across the ocean, and 
which illustrate the impacts and ramifications of 1.5°C or higher levels 
of warming. 
The first group of organisms, pteropods, are small pelagic molluscs 
that suspension feed and produce a calcium carbonate shell. They are 
highly abundant in temperate and polar waters where they are an 
important link in the foodweb between phytoplankton and a range 
of other organisms including fish, whales and birds. The second group, 
227

Chapter 3
bivalve molluscs (e.g., clams, oysters and mussels), are filter-feeding 
invertebrates. These invertebrate organisms underpin important 
fisheries and aquaculture industries, from polar to tropical regions, and 
are important food sources for a range of organisms including humans. 
The third group of organisms considered here is a globally significant 
group of invertebrates known as euphausiid crustaceans (krill), which 
are a key food source for many marine organisms and hence a major 
link between primary producers and higher trophic levels (e.g., fish, 
mammals and sea birds). Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, are among 
the most abundant species in terms of mass and are consequently an 
essential component of polar foodwebs (Atkinson et al., 2009). The last 
group, fin fishes, is vitally important components of ocean foodwebs, 
contribute to the income of coastal communities, industries and nations, 
and are important to the foodsecurity and livelihood of hundreds of 
millions of people globally (FAO, 2016). Further background for this 
section is provided in Supplementary Material 3.SM.3.2.
There is a moderate risk to ocean foodwebs under present-day 
conditions (medium to high confidence) (Figure 3.18). Changing 
water chemistry and temperature are already affecting the ability of 
pteropods to produce their shells, swim and survive (Bednaršek et 
al., 2016). Shell dissolution, for example, has increased by 19–26% 
in both nearshore and offshore populations since the pre-industrial 
period (Feely et al., 2016). There is considerable concern as to 
whether these organisms are declining further, especially given 
the central importance in ocean foodwebs (David et al., 2017). 
Reviewing the literature reveals that pteropods are projected to 
face high risks of impact at average global temperatures 1.5°C 
above pre-industrial levels and increasing risks of impacts at 2°C 
(medium confidence).
As GMST increases by 1.5°C and more, the risk of impacts from ocean 
warming and acidification are expected to be moderate to high, except 
in the case of bivalves (mid-latitudes) where the risks of impacts are 
projected to be high to very high (Figure 3.18). Ocean warming and 
acidification are already affecting the life history stages of bivalve 
molluscs (e.g., Asplund et al., 2014; Mackenzie et al., 2014; Waldbusser 
et al., 2014; Zittier et al., 2015; Shi et al., 2016; Velez et al., 2016; Q. 
Wang et al., 2016; Castillo et al., 2017; Lemasson et al., 2017; Ong et al., 
2017; X. Zhao et al., 2017). Impacts on adult bivalves include decreased 
growth, increased respiration and reduced calcification, whereas 
larval stages tend to show greater developmental abnormalities and 
increased mortality after exposure to these conditions (medium to high 
confidence) (Q. Wang et al., 2016; Lemasson et al., 2017; Ong et al., 
2017; X. Zhao et al., 2017). Risks are expected to accumulate at higher 
temperatures for bivalve molluscs, with very high risks expected at 
1.8°C of warming or more. This general pattern applies to low-latitude 
fin fish, which are expected to experience moderate to high risks of 
impact at 1.3°C of global warming (medium confidence), and very high 
risks at 1.8°C at low latitudes (medium confidence) (Figure 3.18).
Large-scale changes to foodweb structure are occurring in all oceans. For 
example, record levels of sea ice loss in the Antarctic (Notz and Stroeve, 
2016; Turner et al., 2017b) translate into a loss of habitat and hence 
reduced abundance of krill (Piñones and Fedorov, 2016), with negative 
ramifications for the seabirds and whales which feed on krill (Croxall, 
1992; Trathan and Hill, 2016) (low-medium confidence). Other influences, 
such as high rates of ocean acidification coupled with shoaling of the 
aragonite saturation horizon, are likely to also play key roles (Kawaguchi 
et al., 2013; Piñones and Fedorov, 2016). As with many risks associated 
with impacts at the ecosystem scale, most adaptation options focus on 
the management of stresses unrelated to climate change but resulting 
from human activities, such as pollution and habitat destruction. 
Reducing these stresses will be important in efforts to maintain important 
foodweb components. Fisheries management at local to regional scales 
will be important in reducing stress on foodweb organisms, such as 
those discussed here, and in helping communities and industries adapt 
to changing foodweb structures and resources (see further discussion of 
fisheries per se below; Section 3.4.6.3). One strategy is to maintain larger 
population levels of fished species in order to provide more resilient 
stocks in the face of challenges that are increasingly driven by climate 
change (Green et al., 2014; Bell and Taylor, 2015).
3.4.4.12  Key ecosystem services (e.g., carbon uptake, coastal 
protection, and tropical coral reef recreation) 
The ocean provides important services, including the regulation of 
atmospheric composition via gas exchange across the boundary 
between ocean and atmosphere, and the storage of carbon in vegetation 
and soils associated with ecosystems such as mangroves, salt marshes 
and coastal peatlands. These services involve a series of physicochemical 
processes which are influenced by ocean chemistry, circulation, biology, 
temperature and biogeochemical components, as well as by factors other 
than climate (Boyd, 2015). The ocean is also a net sink for CO2 (another 
important service), absorbing approximately 30% of human emissions 
from the burning of fossil fuels and modification of land use (IPCC, 2013). 
Carbon uptake by the ocean is decreasing (Iida et al., 2015), and there is 
increasing concern from observations and models regarding associated 
changes to ocean circulation (Sections 3.3.7 and 3.4.4., Rahmstorf et 
al., 2015b);. Biological components of carbon uptake by the ocean are 
also changing, with observations of changing net primary productivity 
(NPP) in equatorial and coastal upwelling systems (medium confidence) 
(Lluch-Cota et al., 2014; Sydeman et al., 2014; Bakun et al., 2015), as 
well as subtropical gyre systems (low confidence) (Signorini et al., 2015). 
There is general agreement that NPP will decline as ocean warming and 
acidification increase (medium confidence) (Bopp et al., 2013; Boyd et al., 
2014; Pörtner et al., 2014; Boyd, 2015).
Projected risks of impacts from reductions in carbon uptake, coastal 
protection and services contributing to coral reef recreation suggest 
a transition from moderate to high risks at 1.5°C and higher (low 
confidence). At 2°C, risks of impacts associated with changes to 
carbon uptake are high (high confidence), while the risks associated 
with reduced coastal protection and recreation on tropical coral 
reefs are high, especially given the vulnerability of this ecosystem 
type, and others (e.g., seagrass and mangroves), to climate change 
(medium confidence) (Figure 3.18). Coastal protection is a service 
provided by natural barriers such as mangroves, seagrass meadows, 
coral reefs, and other coastal ecosystems, and it is important for 
protecting human communities and infrastructure against the impacts 
associated with rising sea levels, larger waves and intensifying 
storms (high confidence) (Gutiérrez et al., 2012; Kennedy et al., 
2013; Ferrario et al., 2014; Barbier, 2015; Cooper et al., 2016; Hauer 
et al., 2016; Narayan et al., 2016). Both natural and human coastal 
228
Chapter 3

3
protection have the potential to reduce these impacts (Fu and Song, 
2017). Tropical coral reefs, for example, provide effective protection 
by dissipating about 97% of wave energy, with 86% of the energy 
being dissipated by reef crests alone (Ferrario et al., 2014; Narayan 
et al., 2016). Mangroves similarly play an important role in coastal 
protection, as well as providing resources for coastal communities, 
but they are already under moderate risk of not keeping up with sea 
level rise due to climate change and to contributing factors, such as 
reduced sediment supply or obstacles to shoreward shifts (Saunders 
et al., 2014; Lovelock et al., 2015). This implies that coastal areas 
currently protected by mangroves may experience growing risks over 
time.
Figure 3.18 |  Summary of additional risks of impacts from ocean warming (and associated climate change factors such ocean acidification) for a range of ocean organisms, 
ecosystems and sectors at 1.0°C, 1.5°C and 2.0°C of warming of the average sea surface temperature (SST) relative to the pre-industrial period. The grey bar represents the 
range of GMST for the most recent decade: 2006–2015. The assessment of changing risk levels and associated confidence were primarily derived from the expert judgement 
of Gattuso et al. (2015) and the lead authors and relevant contributing authors of Chapter 3 (SR1.5), while additional input was received from the many reviewers of the 
ocean systems section of SR1.5. Notes: (i) The analysis shown here is not intended to be comprehensive. The examples of organisms, ecosystems and sectors included here are 
intended to illustrate the scale, types and projection of risks for representative natural and human ocean systems. (ii) The evaluation of risks by experts did not consider genetic 
adaptation, acclimatization or human risk reduction strategies (mitigation and societal adaptation). (iii) As discussed elsewhere (Sections 3.3.10 and 3.4.4.5, Box 3.4; Gattuso 
et al., 2015), ocean acidification is also having impacts on organisms and ecosystems as carbon dioxide increases in the atmosphere. These changes are part of the responses 
reported here, although partitioning the effects of the two drivers is difficult at this point in time and hence was not attempted. (iv) Confidence levels for location of transition 
points between levels of risk (L = low, M = moderate, H = high and VH = very high) are assessed and presented here as in the accompanying study by Gattuso et al. (2015). 
Three transitions in risk were possible: W–Y (white to yellow), Y–R (yellow to red), and R–P (red to purple), with the colours corresponding to the level of additional risk posed 
by climate change. The confidence levels for these transitions were assessed, based on level of agreement and extent of evidence, and appear as letters associated with each 
transition (see key in diagram).

Tourism is one of the largest industries globally (Rosselló-Nadal, 2014; 
Markham et al., 2016; Spalding et al., 2017). A substantial part of the 
global tourist industry is associated with tropical coastal regions and 
islands, where tropical coral reefs and related ecosystems play important 
roles (Section 3.4.9.1) (medium confidence). Coastal tourism can be a 
dominant money earner in terms of foreign exchange for many countries, 
particularly small island developing states (SIDS) (Section 3.4.9.1, Box 
3.5; Weatherdon et al., 2016; Spalding et al., 2017). The direct relationship 
between increasing global temperatures, intensifying storms, elevated 
thermal stress, and the loss of tropical coral reefs has raised concern 
about the risks of climate change for local economies and industries 
based on tropical coral reefs. Risks to coral reef recreational services from 
climate change are considered here, as well as in Box 3.5, Section 3.4.9 
and Supplementary Material 3.SM.3.2.
Adaptations to the broad global changes in carbon uptake by the ocean 
are limited and are discussed later in this report with respect to changes 
in NPP and implications for fishing industries. These adaptation options 
are broad and indirect, and the only other solution at large scale is 
to reduce the entry of CO2 into the ocean. Strategies for adapting to 
reduced coastal protection involve (a) avoidance of vulnerable areas 
and hazards, (b) managed retreat from threatened locations, and/or (c) 
accommodation of impacts and loss of services (Bell, 2012; André et al., 
2016; Cooper et al., 2016; Mills et al., 2016; Raabe and Stumpf, 2016; Fu 
and Song, 2017). Within these broad options, there are some strategies 
that involve direct human intervention, such as coastal hardening and 
the construction of seawalls and artificial reefs (Rinkevich, 2014, 2015; 
André et al., 2016; Cooper et al., 2016; Narayan et al., 2016), while 
others exploit opportunities for increasing coastal protection by involving 
naturally occurring oyster banks, coral reefs, mangroves, seagrass and 
other ecosystems (UNEP-WCMC, 2006; Scyphers et al., 2011; Zhang et 
al., 2012; Ferrario et al., 2014; Cooper et al., 2016). Natural ecosystems, 
when healthy, also have the ability to repair themselves after being 
damaged, which sets them apart from coastal hardening and other 
human structures that require constant maintenance (Barbier, 2015; Elliff 
and Silva, 2017). In general, recognizing and restoring coastal ecosystems 
may be more cost-effective than installing human structures, in that 
creating and maintaining structures is typically expensive (Temmerman 
et al., 2013; Mycoo, 2017).
Recent studies have increasingly stressed the need for coastal protection 
to be considered within the context of coastal land management, 
including protecting and ensuring that coastal ecosystems are able to 
undergo shifts in their distribution and abundance as climate change 
occurs (Clausen and Clausen, 2014; Martínez et al., 2014; Cui et al., 
2015; André et al., 2016; Mills et al., 2016). Facilitating these changes 
will require new tools in terms of legal and financial instruments, as 
well as integrated planning that involves not only human communities 
and infrastructure, but also associated ecosystem responses and values 
(Bell, 2012; Mills et al., 2016). In this regard, the interactions between 
climate change, sea level rise and coastal disasters are increasingly 
being informed by models (Bosello and De Cian, 2014) with a widening 
appreciation of the role of natural ecosystems as an alternative to 
hardened coastal structures (Cooper et al., 2016). Adaptation options 
for tropical coral reef recreation include: (i) protecting and improving 
biodiversity and ecological function by minimizing the impact of 
stresses unrelated to climate change (e.g., pollution and overfishing), 
(ii) ensuring adequate levels of coastal protection by supporting and 
repairing ecosystems that protect coastal regions, (iii) ensuring fair 
and equitable access to the economic opportunities associated with 
recreational activities, and (iv) seeking and protecting supplies of water 
for tourism, industry and agriculture alongside community needs.
Box 3.4 |  Warm-Water (Tropical) Coral Reefs in a 1.5°C Warmer World 
Warm-water coral reefs face very high risks (Figure 3.18) from climate change. A world in which global warming is restricted to 1.5°C 
above pre-industrial levels would be a better place for coral reefs than that of a 2°C warmer world, in which coral reefs would mostly 
disappear (Donner et al., 2005; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014; Schleussner et al., 2016b; van Hooidonk et al., 2016; Frieler et al., 2017; 
Hughes et al., 2017a). Even with warming up until today (GMST for decade 2006–2015: 0.87°C; Chapter 1), a substantial proportion 
of coral reefs have experienced large-scale mortalities that have lead to much reduced coral populations (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 
2014). In the last three years alone (2016–2018), large coral reef systems such as the Great Barrier Reef (Australia) have lost as 
much as 50% of their shallow water corals (Hughes et al., 2017b). 
Coral-dominated reefs are found along coastlines between latitudes 30°S and 30°N, where they provide habitat for over a million 
species (Reaka-Kudla, 1997) and food, income, coastal protection, cultural context and many other services for millions of people 
in tropical coastal areas (Burke et al., 2011; Cinner et al., 2012; Kennedy et al., 2013; Pendleton et al., 2016). Ultimately, coral reefs 
are underpinned by a mutualistic symbiosis between reef-building corals and dinoflagellates from the genus Symbiodinium (Hoegh-
Guldberg et al., 2017). Warm-water coral reefs are found down to depths of 150 m and are dependent on light, making them distinct 
from the cold deep-water reef systems that extend down to depths of 2000 m or more. The difficulty in accessing deep-water reefs 
also means that the literature on the impacts of climate change on these systems is very limited by comparison to those on warm-
water coral reefs (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2017). Consequently, this Box focuses on the impacts of climate change on warm-water 
(tropical) coral reefs, particularly with respect to their prospects under average global surface temperatures of 1.5°C and 2°C above 
the pre-industrial period.

Chapter 3 
Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems

The distribution and abundance of coral reefs has decreased by approximately 50% over the past 30 years (Gardner et al., 2005; 
Bruno and Selig, 2007; De’ath et al., 2012) as a result of pollution, storms, overfishing and unsustainable coastal development (Burke 
et al., 2011; Halpern et al., 2015; Cheal et al., 2017). More recently, climate change (i.e., heat stress; Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999; Baker 
et al., 2008; Spalding and Brown, 2015; Hughes et al., 2017b) has emerged as the greatest threat to coral reefs, with temperatures 
of just 1°C above the long-term summer maximum for an area (reference period 1985–1993) over 4–6 weeks being enough to 
cause mass coral bleaching (loss of the symbionts) and mortality (very high confidence) (WGII AR5, Box 18-2; Cramer et al., 2014). 
Ocean warming and acidification can also slow growth and calcification, making corals less competitive compared to other benthic 
organisms such as macroalgae or seaweeds (Dove et al., 2013; Reyes-Nivia et al., 2013, 2014). As corals disappear, so do fish and 
many other reef-dependent species, which directly impacts industries such as tourism and fisheries, as well as the livelihoods for 
many, often disadvantaged, coastal people (Wilson et al., 2006; Graham, 2014; Graham et al., 2015; Cinner et al., 2016; Pendleton et 
al., 2016). These impacts are exacerbated by increasingly intense storms (Section 3.3.6), which physically destroy coral communities 
and hence reefs (Cheal et al., 2017), and by ocean acidification (Sections 3.3.10 and 3.4.4.5), which can weaken coral skeletons, 
contribute to disease, and slow the recovery of coral communities after mortality events (low to medium confidence) (Gardner et 
al., 2005; Dove et al., 2013; Kennedy et al., 2013; Webster et al., 2013; Hoegh-Guldberg, 2014b; Anthony, 2016). Ocean acidification 
also leads to enhanced activity by decalcifying organisms such as excavating sponges (Kline et al., 2012; Dove et al., 2013; Fang et 
al., 2013, 2014; Reyes-Nivia et al., 2013, 2014). 
The predictions of back-to-back bleaching events (Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999) have become the reality in the summers of 2016–2017 
(e.g., Hughes et al., 2017b), as have projections of declining coral abundance (high confidence). Models have also become increasingly 
capable and are currently predicting the large-scale loss of coral reefs by mid-century under even low-emissions scenarios (Hoegh-
Guldberg, 1999; Donner et al., 2005; Donner, 2009; van Hooidonk and Huber, 2012; Frieler et al., 2013; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 
2014; van Hooidonk et al., 2016). Even achieving emissions reduction targets consistent with the ambitious goal of 1.5°C of global 
warming under the Paris Agreement will result in the further loss of 70–90% of reef-building corals compared to today, with 99% 
of corals being lost under warming of 2°C or more above the pre-industrial period (Frieler et al., 2013; Hoegh-Guldberg, 2014b; 
Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014; Schleussner et al., 2016b; Hughes et al., 2017a). 
The assumptions underpinning these assessments are considered to be highly conservative. In some cases, ‘optimistic’ assumptions 
in models include rapid thermal adaptation by corals of 0.2°C–1°C per decade (Donner et al., 2005) or 0.4°C per decade (Schleussner 
et al., 2016b), as well as very rapid recovery rates from impacts (e.g., five years in the case of Schleussner et al., 2016b). Adaptation 
to climate change at these high rates, has not been documented, and recovery from mass mortality tends to take much longer 
(>15 years; Baker et al., 2008). Probability analysis also indicates that the underlying increases in sea temperatures that drive coral 
bleaching and mortality are 25% less likely under 1.5°C when compared to 2°C (King et al., 2017). Spatial differences between 
the rates of heating suggest the possibility of temporary climate refugia (Caldeira, 2013; van Hooidonk et al., 2013; Cacciapaglia 
and van Woesik, 2015; Keppel and Kavousi, 2015), which may play an important role in terms of the regeneration of coral reefs, 
especially if these refuges are protected from risks unrelated to climate change. Locations at higher latitudes are reporting the arrival 
of reef-building corals, which may be valuable in terms of the role of limited refugia and coral reef structures but will have low 
biodiversity (high confidence) when compared to present-day tropical reefs (Kersting et al., 2017). Similarly, deep-water (30–150 
m) or mesophotic coral reefs (Bongaerts et al., 2010; Holstein et al., 2016) may play an important role because they avoid shallow 
water extremes (i.e., heat and storms) to some extent, although the ability of these ecosystems to assist in repopulating damaged 
shallow water areas may be limited (Bongaerts et al., 2017).
Given the sensitivity of corals to heat stress, even short periods of overshoot (i.e., decades) are expected to be extremely damaging 
to coral reefs. Losing 70–90% of today’s coral reefs, however, will remove resources and increase poverty levels across the world’s 
tropical coastlines, highlighting the key issue of equity for the millions of people that depend on these valuable ecosystems 
(Cross-Chapter Box 6; Spalding et al., 2014; Halpern et al., 2015). Anticipating these challenges to food and livelihoods for coastal 
communities will become increasingly important, as will adaptation options, such as the diversification of livelihoods and the 
development of new sustainable industries, to reduce the dependency of coastal communities on threatened ecosystems such as 
coral reefs (Cinner et al., 2012, 2016; Pendleton et al., 2016). At the same time, coastal communities will need to pre-empt changes 
to other services provided by coral reefs such as coastal protection (Kennedy et al., 2013; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014; Pörtner et 
al., 2014; Gattuso et al., 2015). Other threats and challenges to coastal living, such as sea level rise, will amplify challenges from 
declining coral reefs, specially for SIDS and low-lying tropical nations. Given the scale and cost of these interventions, implementing 
them earlier rather than later would be expedient.

Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems 
Chapter 3
3.4.5 
Coastal and Low-Lying Areas, and Sea Level Rise
Sea level rise (SLR) is accelerating in response to climate change 
(Section 3.3.9; Church et al., 2013) and will produce significant impacts 
(high confidence). In this section, impacts and projections of SLR are 
reported at global and city scales (Sections 3.4.5.1 and 3.4.5.2) and for 
coastal systems (Sections 3.4.5.3 to 3.4.5.6). For some sectors, there 
is a lack of precise evidence of change at 1.5°C and 2°C of global 
warming. Adaptation to SLR is discussed in Section 3.4.5.7. 
3.4.5.1 Global / sub-global scale
Sea level rise (SLR) and other oceanic climate changes are already 
resulting in salinization, flooding, and erosion and in the future are 
projected to affect human and ecological systems, including health, 
heritage, freshwater availability, biodiversity, agriculture, fisheries and 
other services, with different impacts seen worldwide (high confidence). 
Owing to the commitment to SLR, there is an overlapping uncertainty 
in projections at 1.5°C and 2°C (Schleussner et al., 2016b; Sanderson 
et al., 2017; Goodwin et al., 2018; Mengel et al., 2018; Nicholls et al., 
2018; Rasmussen et al., 2018) and about 0.1 m difference in global 
mean sea level (GMSL) rise between 1.5°C and 2°C worlds in the year 
2100 (Section 3.3.9, Table 3.3). Exposure and impacts at 1.5°C and 2°C 
differ at different time horizons (Schleussner et al., 2016b; Brown et 
al., 2018a, b; Nicholls et al., 2018; Rasmussen et al., 2018). However, 
these are distinct from impacts associated with higher increases in 
temperature (e.g., 4°C or more, as discussed in Brown et al., 2018a) 
over centennial scales. The benefits of climate change mitigation 
reinforce findings of earlier IPCC reports (e.g., Wong et al., 2014). 
Table 3.3 shows the land and people exposed to SLR (assuming there 
is no adaptation or protection at all) using the Dynamic Interactive 
Vulnerability Assessment (DIVA) model (extracted from Brown et al., 
2018a and Goodwin et al., 2018; see also Supplementary Material 
3.SM, Table 3.SM.4). Thus, exposure increases even with temperature 
stabilization. The exposed land area is projected to at least double by 
2300 using a RCP8.5 scenario compared with a mitigation scenario 
(Brown et al., 2018a). In the 21st century, land area exposed to 
sea level rise (assuming there is no adaptation or protection at all) 
is projected to be at least an order of magnitude larger than the 
cumulative land loss due to submergence (which takes into account 
defences) (Brown et al., 2016, 2018a) regardless of the SLR scenario 
applied. Slower rates of rise due to climate change mitigation may 
provide a greater opportunity for adaptation (medium confidence), 
which could substantially reduce impacts. 
In agreement with the assessment in WGII AR5 Section 5.4.3.1 (Wong 
et al., 2014), climate change mitigation may reduce or delay coastal 
exposure and impacts (very high confidence). Adaptation has the 
potential to substantially reduce risk through a portfolio of available 
options (Sections 5.4.3.1 and 5.5 of Wong et al., 2014; Sections 6.4.2.3 
and 6.6 of Nicholls et al., 2007). At 1.5°C in 2100, 31–69 million people 
(2010 population values) worldwide are projected to be exposed to 
flooding, assuming no adaptation or protection at all, compared 
with 32–79 million people (2010 population values) at 2°C in 2100 
(Supplementary Material 3.SM, Table 3.SM.4; Rasmussen et al., 2018). 
As a result, up to 10.4 million more people would be exposed to sea 
level rise at 2°C compared with 1.5°C in 2100 (medium confidence). 
With a 1.5°C stabilization scenario in 2100, 62.7 million people per year 
are at risk from flooding, with this value increasing to 137.6 million 
people per year in 2300 (50th percentile, average across SSP1 – 5, no 
socio-economic change after 2100). These projections assume that no 
upgrade to current protection levels occurs (Nicholls et al., 2018). The 
number of people at risk increases by approximately 18% in 2030 if 
a 2°C scenario is used and by 266% in 2300 if an RCP8.5 scenario 
is considered (Nicholls et al., 2018). Through prescribed IPCC Special 
Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) SLR scenarios, Arnell et al. 
(2016) also found that the number of people exposed to flooding 
increased substantially at warming levels higher than 2°C, assuming 
no adaptation beyond current protection levels. Additionally, impacts 
increased in the second half of the 21st century. 
Coastal flooding is projected to cost thousands of billions of USD 
annually, with damage costs under constant protection estimated 
at 0.3–5.0% of global gross domestic product (GDP) in 2100 under 
an RCP2.6 scenario (Hinkel et al., 2014). Risks are projected to be 
highest in South and Southeast Asia, assuming there is no upgrade 
to current protection levels, for all levels of climate warming (Arnell et 
al., 2016; Brown et al., 2016). Countries with at least 50 million people 
exposed to SLR (assuming no adaptation or protection at all) based on 
a 1,280 Pg C emissions scenario (approximately a 1.5°C temperature 
rise above today’s level) include China, Bangladesh, Egypt, India, 
Indonesia, Japan, Philippines, United States and Vietnam (Clark et al., 
2016). Rasmussen et al. (2018) and Brown et al. (2018a) project that 
similar countries would have high exposure to SLR in the 21st century 
using 1.5°C and 2°C scenarios. Thus, there is high confidence that SLR 
will have significant impacts worldwide in this century and beyond.
3.4.5.2 Cities
Observations of the impacts of SLR in cities are difficult to record 
because multiple drivers of change are involved. There are observations 
of ongoing and planned adaptation to SLR and extreme water levels 
in some cities (Araos et al., 2016; Nicholls et al., 2018), whilst other 
cities have yet to prepare for these impacts (high confidence) (see 
Section 3.4.8 and Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 4). There are limited 
observations and analyses of how cities will cope with higher and/or 
multi-centennial SLR, with the exception of Amsterdam, New York and 
London (Nicholls et al., 2018).
Coastal urban areas are projected to see more extreme water levels 
due to rising sea levels, which may lead to increased flooding and 
damage of infrastructure from extreme events (unless adaptation is 
undertaken), plus salinization of groundwater. These impacts may be 
enhanced through localized subsidence (Wong et al., 2014), which 
causes greater relative SLR. At least 136 megacities (port cities with 
a population greater than 1 million in 2005) are at risk from flooding 
due to SLR (with magnitudes of rise possible under 1.5°C or 2°C in the 
21st century, as indicated in Section 3.3.9) unless further adaptation 
is undertaken (Hanson et al., 2011; Hallegatte et al., 2013). Many of 
these cities are located in South and Southeast Asia (Hallegatte et 
al., 2013; Cazenave and Cozannet, 2014; Clark et al., 2016; Jevrejeva 
et al., 2016). Jevrejeva et al. (2016) projected that more than 90% of 
global coastlines could experience SLR greater than 0.2 m with 2°C 
232
Chapter 3 
Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems
3
of warming by 2040 (RCP8.5). However, for scenarios where 2°C is 
stabilized or occurs later in time, this figure is likely to differ because 
of the commitment to SLR. Raising existing dikes helps protect against 
SLR, substantially reducing risks, although other forms of adaptation 
exist. By 2300, dike heights under a non-mitigation scenario (RCP8.5) 
could be more than 2 m higher (on average for 136 megacities) than 
under climate change mitigation scenarios at 1.5°C or 2°C (Nicholls 
et al., 2018). Thus, rising sea levels commit coastal cities to long-term 
adaptation (high confidence).
3.4.5.3 Small islands
Qualitative physical observations of SLR (and other stresses) include 
inundation of parts of low-lying islands, land degradation due to 
saltwater intrusion in Kiribati and Tuvalu (Wairiu, 2017), and shoreline 
change in French Polynesia (Yates et al., 2013), Tuvalu (Kench et al., 
2015, 2018) and Hawaii (Romine et al., 2013). Observations, models 
and other evidence indicate that unconstrained Pacific atolls have kept 
pace with SLR, with little reduction in size or net gain in land (Kench 
et al., 2015, 2018; McLean and Kench, 2015; Beetham et al., 2017). 
Whilst islands are highly vulnerable to SLR (high confidence), they are 
also reactive to change. Small islands are impacted by multiple climatic 
stressors, with SLR being a more important stressor to some islands 
than others (Sections 3.4.10, 4.3.5.6, 5.2.1, 5.5.3.3, Boxes 3.5, 4.3 and 
5.3).
Observed adaptation to multiple drivers of coastal change, including 
SLR, includes retreat (migration), accommodation and defence. 
Migration (internal and international) has always been important 
on small islands (Farbotko and Lazrus, 2012; Weir et al., 2017), with 
changing environmental and weather conditions being just one factor in 
the choice to migrate (Sections 3.4.10, 4.3.5.6 and 5.3.2; Campbell and 
Warrick, 2014). Whilst flooding may result in migration or relocation, 
for example in Vunidogoloa, Fiji (McNamara and Des Combes, 2015; 
Gharbaoui and Blocher, 2016) and the Solomon Islands (Albert et al., 
2017), in situ adaptation may be tried or preferred, for example stilted 
housing or raised floors in Tubigon, Bohol, Philippines (Jamero et al., 
2017), raised roads and floors in Batasan and Ubay, Philippines (Jamero 
et al., 2018), and raised platforms for faluw in Leang, Federated States 
of Micronesia (Nunn et al., 2017). Protective features, such as seawalls 
or beach nourishment, are observed to locally reduce erosion and flood 
risk but can have other adverse implications (Sovacool, 2012; Mycoo, 
2014, 2017; Nurse et al., 2014; AR5 Section 29.6.22).
There is a lack of precise, quantitative studies of projected impacts 
of SLR at 1.5°C and 2°C. Small islands are projected to be at risk 
and very sensitive to coastal climate change and other stressors 
(high confidence) (Nurse et al., 2014; Benjamin and Thomas, 2016; 
Ourbak and Magnan, 2017; Brown et al., 2018a; Nicholls et al., 2018; 
Rasmussen et al., 2018; AR5 Sections 29.3 and 29.4), such as oceanic 
warming, SLR (resulting in salinization, flooding and erosion), cyclones 
and mass coral bleaching and mortality (Section 3.4.4, Boxes 3.4 and 
3.5). These impacts can have significant socio-economic and ecological 
implications, such as on health, agriculture and water resources, which 
in turn have impacts on livelihoods (Sovacool, 2012; Mycoo, 2014, 
2017; Nurse et al., 2014). Combinations of drivers causing adverse 
impacts are important. For example, Storlazzi et al. (2018) found that 
the impacts of SLR and wave-induced flooding (within a temperature 
horizon equivalent of 1.5°C), could affect freshwater availability on 
Roi-Namur, Marshall Islands, but is also dependent on other extreme 
weather events. Freshwater resources may also be affected by 
a 0.40 m rise in sea level (which may be experienced with a 1.5°C 
warming) in other Pacific atolls (Terry and Chui, 2012). Whilst SLR is 
a major hazard for atolls, islands reaching higher elevations are also 
threatened given that there is often a lot of infrastructure located near 
the coast (high confidence) (Kumar and Taylor, 2015; Nicholls et al., 
2018). Tens of thousands of people on small islands are exposed to 
SLR (Rasmussen et al., 2018). Giardino et al. (2018) found that hard 
defence structures on the island of Ebeye in the Marshall Islands were 
effective in reducing damage due to SLR at 1.5°C and 2°C. Additionally, 
damage was also reduced under mitigation scenarios compared with 
non-mitigation scenarios. In Jamaica and St Lucia, SLR and extreme 
sea levels are projected to threaten transport system infrastructure at 
1.5°C unless further adaptation is undertaken (Monioudi et al., 2018). 
Slower rates of SLR will provide a greater opportunity for adaptation 
to be successful (medium confidence), but this may not be substantial 
enough on islands with a very low mean elevation. Migration and/or 
relocation may be an adaptation option (Section 3.4.10). Thomas and 
Benjamin (2017) highlight three areas of concern in the context of loss 
and damage at 1.5°C: a lack of data, gaps in financial assessments, 
and a lack of targeted policies or mechanisms to address these issues 
(Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 5). Small islands are projected to 
remain vulnerable to SLR (high confidence).
3.4.5.4 Deltas and estuaries 
Observations of SLR and human influence are felt through salinization, 
which leads to mixing in deltas and estuaries, aquifers, leading to 
flooding (also enhanced by precipitation and river discharge), land 
degradation and erosion. Salinization is projected to impact freshwater 
sources and pose risks to ecosystems and human systems (Section 
5.4; Wong et al., 2014). For instance, in the Delaware River estuary on 
the east coast of the USA, upward trends of salinity (measured since 
the 1900s), accounting for the effects of streamflow and seasonal 
variations, have been detected and SLR is a potential cause (Ross et 
al., 2015).
Z. Yang et al. (2015) found that future climate scenarios for the USA 
(A1B 1.6°C and B1 2°C in the 2040s) had a greater effect on salinity 
intrusion than future land-use/land-cover change in the Snohomish 
River estuary in Washington state (USA). This resulted in a shift in 
the salinity both upstream and downstream in low flow conditions. 
Projecting impacts in deltas needs an understanding of both fluvial 
discharge and SLR, making projections complex because the drivers 
operate on different temporal and spatial scales (Zaman et al., 2017; 
Brown et al., 2018b). The mean annual flood depth when 1.5°C is first 
projected to be reached in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta may be less 
than the most extreme annual flood depth seen today, taking into 
account SLR, surges, tides, bathymetry and local river flows (Brown et 
al., 2018b). Further, increased river salinity and saline intrusion in the 
Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna is likely with 2°C of warming (Zaman 
et al., 2017). Salinization could impact agriculture and food security 
(Cross-Chapter Box 6 in this chapter). For 1.5°C or 2°C stabilization 
conditions in 2200 or 2300 plus surges, a minimum of 44% of the 
233
3
Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems 
Chapter 3
Bangladeshi Ganges-Brahmaputra, Indian Bengal, Indian Mahanadi 
and Ghanese Volta delta land area (without defences) would be 
exposed unless sedimentation occurs (Brown et al., 2018b). Other 
deltas are similarly vulnerable. SLR is only one factor affecting deltas, 
and assessment of numerous geophysical and anthropogenic drivers 
of geomorphic change is important (Tessler et al., 2018). For example, 
dike building to reduce flooding and dam building (Gupta et al., 2012) 
restricts sediment movement and deposition, leading to enhanced 
subsidence, which can occur at a greater rate than SLR (Auerbach 
et al., 2015; Takagi et al., 2016). Although dikes remain essential for 
reducing flood risk today, promoting sedimentation is an advisable 
strategy (Brown et al., 2018b) which may involve nature-based 
solutions. Transformative decisions regarding the extent of sediment 
restrictive infrastructure may need to be considered over centennial 
scales (Brown et al., 2018b). Thus, in a 1.5°C or 2°C warmer world, 
deltas, which are home to millions of people, are expected to be highly 
threatened from SLR and localized subsidence (high confidence).
3.4.5.5 
Wetlands
Observations indicate that wetlands, such as saltmarshes and mangrove 
forests, are disrupted by changing conditions (Sections 3.4.4.8; Wong et 
al., 2014; Lovelock et al., 2015), such as total water levels and sediment 
availability. For example, saltmarshes in Connecticut and New York, 
USA, measured from 1900 to 2012, have accreted with SLR but have 
lost marsh surface relative to tidal datums, leading to increased marsh 
flooding and further accretion (Hill and Anisfeld, 2015). This change 
stimulated marsh carbon storage and aided climate change mitigation. 
Salinization may lead to shifts in wetland communities and their 
ecosystem functions (Herbert et al., 2015). Some projections of wetland 
change, with magnitudes (but not necessarily rates or timing) of SLR 
analogous to 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming, indicate a net loss of 
wetlands in the 21st century (e.g., Blankespoor et al., 2014; Cui et al., 
2015; Arnell et al., 2016; Crosby et al., 2016), whilst others report a net 
gain with wetland transgression (e.g., Raabe and Stumpf, 2016 in the 
Gulf of Mexico). However, the feedback between wetlands and sea 
level is complex, with parameters such as a lack of accommodation 
space restricting inland migration, or sediment supply and feedbacks 
between plant growth and geomorphology (Kirwan and Megonigal, 
2013; Ellison, 2014; Martínez et al., 2014; Spencer et al., 2016) still 
being explored. Reducing global warming from 2°C to 1.5°C will 
deliver long-term benefits, with natural sedimentation rates more likely 
keep up with SLR. It remains unclear how wetlands will respond and 
under what conditions (including other climate parameters) to a global 
temperature rise of 1.5°C and 2°C. However, they have great potential 
to aid and benefit climate change mitigation and adaptation (medium 
confidence) (Sections 4.3.2.2 and 4.3.2.3).
3.4.5.6 
Other coastal settings
Numerous impacts have not been quantified at 1.5°C or 2°C but remain 
important. This includes systems identified in WGII AR5 (AR5 – Section 
5.4 of Wong et al., 2014), such as beaches, barriers, sand dunes, rocky 
coasts, aquifers, lagoons and coastal ecosystems (for the last system, 
see Section 3.4.4.12). For example, SLR potentially affects erosion and 
accretion, and therefore sediment movement, instigating shoreline 
change (Section 5.4.2.1 of Wong et al., 2014), which could affect land-
based ecosystems. Global observations indicate no overall clear effect 
of SLR on shoreline change (Le Cozannet et al., 2014), as it is highly 
site specific (e.g., Romine et al., 2013). Infrastructure and geological 
constraints reduce shoreline movement, causing coastal squeeze. In 
Japan, for example, SLR is projected to cause beach losses under an 
RCP2.6 scenario, which will worsen under RCP8.5 (Udo and Takeda, 
2017). Further, compound flooding (the combined risk of flooding from 
multiple sources) has increased significantly over the past century in 
major coastal cities (Wahl et al., 2015) and is likely to increase with 
further development and SLR at 1.5°C and 2°C unless adaptation is 
undertaken. Thus, overall SLR will have a wide range of adverse effects 
on coastal zones (medium confidence).
3.4.5.7 
Adapting to coastal change
Adaptation to coastal change from SLR and other drivers is occurring 
today (high confidence) (see Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 
4), including migration, ecosystem-based adaptation, raising 
infrastructure and defences, salt-tolerant food production, early 
warning systems, insurance and education (Section 5.4.2.1 of Wong et 
al., 2014). Climate change mitigation will reduce the rate of SLR this 
century, decreasing the need for extensive and, in places, immediate 
adaptation. Adaptation will reduce impacts in human settings (high 
confidence) (Hinkel et al., 2014; Wong et al., 2014), although there is 
less certainty for natural ecosystems (Sections 4.3.2 and 4.3.3.3). While 
some ecosystems (e.g., mangroves) may be able to move shoreward 
as sea levels increase, coastal development (e.g., coastal building, 
seawalls and agriculture) often interrupt these transitions (Saunders et 
al., 2014). Options for responding to these challenges include reducing 
the impact of other stresses such as those arising from tourism, fishing, 
coastal development and unsustainable aquaculture/agriculture. In 
some cases, restoration of coastal habitats and ecosystems can be a 
cost-effective way of responding to changes arising from increasing 
levels of exposure from rising sea levels, changes in storm conditions, 
coastal inundation and salinization (Arkema et al., 2013; Temmerman 
et al., 2013; Ferrario et al., 2014; Hinkel et al., 2014; Spalding et al., 
2014; Elliff and Silva, 2017).
Since AR5, planned and autonomous adaptation and forward planning 
have become more widespread (Araos et al., 2016; Nicholls et al., 
2018), but continued efforts are required as many localities are in the 
early stages of adapting or are not adapting at all (Cross-Chapter Box 
9 in Chapter 4; Araos et al., 2016). This is region and sub-sector specific, 
and also linked to non-climatic factors (Ford et al., 2015; Araos et al., 
2016; Lesnikowski et al., 2016). Adaptation pathways (e.g., Ranger et 
al., 2013; Barnett et al., 2014; Rosenzweig and Solecki, 2014; Buurman 
and Babovic, 2016) assist long-term planning but are not widespread 
practices despite knowledge of long-term risks (Section 4.2.2). 
Furthermore, human retreat and migration are increasingly being 
considered as an adaptation response (Hauer et al., 2016; Geisler and 
Currens, 2017), with a growing emphasis on green adaptation. There 
are few studies on the adaptation limits to SLR where transformation 
change may be required (AR5-Section 5.5 of Wong et al., 2014; Nicholls 
et al., 2015). Sea level rise poses a long-term threat (Section 3.3.9), and 
adaptation will remain essential at the centennial scale under 1.5°C 
and 2°C of warming (high confidence).

Box 3.5 |  Small Island Developing States (SIDS)  
Global warming of 1.5°C is expected to prove challenging for small island developing states (SIDS) that are already experiencing 
impacts associated with climate change (high confidence). At 1.5°C, compounding impacts from interactions between climate drivers 
may contribute to the loss of, or change in, critical natural and human systems (medium to high confidence). There are a number of 
reduced risks at 1.5°C versus 2°C, particularly when coupled with adaptation efforts (medium to high confidence). 
Changing climate hazards for SIDS at 1.5°C
Mean surface temperature is projected to increase in SIDS at 1.5°C of global warming (high confidence). The Caribbean region 
will experience 0.5°C–1.5°C of warming compared to a 1971–2000 baseline, with the strongest warming occurring over larger 
land masses (Taylor et al., 2018). Under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)2.6 scenario, the western tropical Pacific 
is projected to experience warming of 0.5°C–1.7°C relative to 1961–1990. Extreme temperatures will also increase, with potential 
for elevated impacts as a result of comparably small natural variability (Reyer et al., 2017a). Compared to the 1971–2000 baseline, 
up to 50% of the year is projected to be under warm spell conditions in the Caribbean at 1.5°C, with a further increase of up to 
70 days at 2°C (Taylor et al., 2018).
Changes in precipitation patterns, freshwater availability and drought sensitivity differ among small island regions (medium to high 
confidence). Some western Pacific islands and those in the northern Indian Ocean may see increased freshwater availability, while 
islands in most other regions are projected to see a substantial decline (Holding et al., 2016; Karnauskas et al., 2016). For several 
SIDS, approximately 25% of the overall freshwater stress projected under 2°C at 2030 could be avoided by limiting global warming 
to 1.5°C (Karnauskas et al., 2018). In accordance with an overall drying trend, an increasing drought risk is projected for Caribbean 
SIDS (Lehner et al., 2017), and moderate to extreme drought conditions are projected to be about 9% longer on average at 2°C 
versus 1.5°C for islands in this region (Taylor et al., 2018). 
Projected changes in the ocean system at higher warming targets (Section 3.4.4), including potential changes in circulation (Section 
3.3.7) and increases in both surface temperatures (Section 3.3.7) and ocean acidification (Section 3.3.10), suggest increasing risks 
for SIDS associated with warming levels close to and exceeding 1.5°C.
Differences in global sea level between 1.5°C and 2°C depend on the time scale considered and are projected to fully materialize 
only after 2100 (Section 3.3.9). Projected changes in regional sea level are similarly time dependent, but generally found to be 
above the global average for tropical regions including small islands (Kopp et al., 2014; Jevrejeva et al., 2016). Threats related to 
sea level rise (SLR) for SIDS, for example from salinization, flooding, permanent inundation, erosion and pressure on ecosystems, 
will therefore persist well beyond the 21st century even under 1.5°C of warming (Section 3.4.5.3; Nicholls et al., 2018). Prolonged 
interannual sea level inundations may increase throughout the tropical Pacific with ongoing warming and in the advent of an 
235

Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems 
Chapter 3
increased frequency of extreme La Niña events, exacerbating coastal impacts of projected global mean SLR (Widlansky et al., 2015). 
Changes to the frequency of extreme El Niño and La Niña events may also increase the frequency of droughts and floods in South 
Pacific islands (Box 4.2, Section 3.5.2; Cai et al., 2012).
Extreme precipitation in small island regions is often linked to tropical storms and contributes to the climate hazard (Khouakhi et 
al., 2017). Similarly, extreme sea levels for small islands, particularly in the Caribbean, are linked to tropical cyclone occurrence 
(Khouakhi and Villarini, 2017). Under a 1.5°C stabilization scenario, there is a projected decrease in the frequency of weaker tropical 
storms and an increase in the number of intense cyclones (Section 3.3.6; Wehner et al., 2018a). There are not enough studies 
to assess differences in tropical cyclone statistics for 1.5°C versus 2°C (Section 3.3.6). There are considerable differences in the 
adaptation responses to tropical cyclones across SIDS (Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 4).
Impacts on key natural and human systems
Projected increases in aridity and decreases in freshwater availability at 1.5°C of warming, along with additional risks from SLR 
and increased wave-induced run-up, might leave several atoll islands uninhabitable (Storlazzi et al., 2015; Gosling and Arnell, 
2016). Changes in the availability and quality of freshwater, linked to a combination of changes to climate drivers, may adversely 
impact SIDS’ economies (White and Falkland, 2010; Terry and Chui, 2012; Holding and Allen, 2015; Donk et al., 2018). Growth-rate 
projections based on temperature impacts alone indicate robust negative impacts on gross domestic product (GDP) per capita 
growth for SIDS (Sections 3.4.7.1, 3.4.9.1 and 3.5.4.9; Pretis et al., 2018). These impacts would be reduced considerably under 1.5°C 
but may be increased by escalating risks from climate-related extreme weather events and SLR (Sections 3.4.5.3, 3.4.9.4 and 3.5.3)
Marine systems and associated livelihoods in SIDS face higher risks at 2°C compared to 1.5°C (medium to high confidence). 
Mass coral bleaching and mortality are projected to increase because of interactions between rising ocean temperatures, ocean 
acidification, and destructive waves from intensifying storms (Section 3.4.4 and 5.2.3, Box 3.4). At 1.5°C, approximately 70–90% of 
global coral reefs are projected to be at risk of long-term degradation due to coral bleaching, with these values increasing to 99% at 
2°C (Frieler et al., 2013; Schleussner et al., 2016b). Higher temperatures are also related to an increase in coral disease development, 
leading to coral degradation (Maynard et al., 2015). For marine fisheries, limiting warming to 1.5°C decreases the risk of species 
extinction and declines in maximum catch potential, particularly for small islands in tropical oceans (Cheung et al., 2016a).
Long-term risks of coastal flooding and impacts on populations, infrastructure and assets are projected to increase with higher levels 
of warming (high confidence). Tropical regions including small islands are expected to experience the largest increases in coastal 
flooding frequency, with the frequency of extreme water-level events in small islands projected to double by 2050 (Vitousek et al., 
2017). Wave-driven coastal flooding risks for reef-lined islands may increase as a result of coral reef degradation and SLR (Quataert 
et al., 2015). Exposure to coastal hazards is particularly high for SIDS, with a significant share of population, infrastructure and assets 
at risk (Sections 3.4.5.3 and 3.4.9; Scott et al., 2012; Kumar and Taylor, 2015; Rhiney, 2015; Byers et al., 2018). Limiting warming to 
1.5°C instead of 2°C would spare the inundation of lands currently home to 60,000 individuals in SIDS by 2150 (Rasmussen et al., 
2018). However, such estimates do not consider shoreline response (Section 3.4.5) or adaptation.
Risks of impacts across sectors are projected to be higher at 1.5°C compared to the present, and will further increase at 2°C (medium 
to high confidence). Projections indicate that at 1.5°C there will be increased incidents of internal migration and displacement 
(Sections 3.5.5, 4.3.6 and 5.2.2; Albert et al., 2017), limited capacity to assess loss and damage (Thomas and Benjamin, 2017) 
and substantial increases in the risk to critical transportation infrastructure from marine inundation (Monioudi et al., 2018). The 
difference between 1.5°C and 2°C might exceed limits for normal thermoregulation of livestock animals and result in persistent heat 
stress for livestock animals in SIDS (Lallo et al., 2018). 
At 1.5°C, limits to adaptation will be reached for several key impacts in SIDS, resulting in residual impacts, as well as loss and 
damage (Section 1.1.1, Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 5). Limiting temperature increase to 1.5°C versus 2°C is expected to reduce 
a number of risks, particularly when coupled with adaptation efforts that take into account sustainable development (Section 3.4.2 
and 5.6.3.1, Box 4.3 and 5.3, Mycoo, 2017; Thomas and Benjamin, 2017). Region-specific pathways for SIDS exist to address climate 
change (Section 5.6.3.1, Boxes 4.6 and 5.3, Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 4).

3.4.6 
Food, Nutrition Security and Food Production 
Systems (Including Fisheries and Aquaculture)
3.4.6.1 Crop production 
Quantifying the observed impacts of climate change on food security 
and food production systems requires assumptions about the many 
non-climate variables that interact with climate change variables. 
Implementing specific strategies can partly or greatly alleviate the 
climate change impacts on these systems (Wei et al., 2017), whilst the 
degree of compensation is mainly dependent on the geographical area 
and crop type (Rose et al., 2016). Despite these uncertainties, recent 
studies confirm that observed climate change has already affected crop 
suitability in many areas, resulting in changes in the production levels 
of the main agricultural crops. These impacts are evident in many areas 
of the world, ranging from Asia (C. Chen et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2015; 
He and Zhou, 2016) to America (Cho and McCarl, 2017) and Europe 
(Ramirez-Cabral et al., 2016), and they particularly affect the typical 
local crops cultivated in specific climate conditions (e.g., Mediterranean 
crops like olive and grapevine, Moriondo et al., 2013a, b). 
Temperature and precipitation trends have reduced crop production 
and yields, with the most negative impacts being on wheat and maize 
(Lobell et al., 2011), whilst the effects on rice and soybean yields are 
less clear and may be positive or negative (Kim et al., 2013; van Oort 
and Zwart, 2018). Warming has resulted in positive effects on crop yield 
in some high-latitude areas (Jaggard et al., 2007; Supit et al., 2010; 
Gregory and Marshall, 2012; C. Chen et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2015; He 
and Zhou, 2016; Daliakopoulos et al., 2017), and may make it possible 
to have more than one harvest per year (B. Chen et al., 2014; Sun et 
al., 2015). Climate variability has been found to explain more than 
60% of the of maize, rice, wheat and soybean yield variations in the 
main global breadbaskets areas (Ray et al., 2015), with the percentage 
varying according to crop type and scale (Moore and Lobell, 2015; Kent 
et al., 2017). Climate trends also explain changes in the length of the 
growing season, with greater modifications found in the northern high-
latitude areas (Qian et al., 2010; Mueller et al., 2015).
The rise in tropospheric ozone has already reduced yields of wheat, 
rice, maize and soybean by 3–16% globally (Van Dingenen et al., 
2009). In some studies, increases in atmospheric CO2 concentrations 
were found to increase yields by enhancing radiation and water use 
efficiencies (Elliott et al., 2014; Durand et al., 2018). In open-top 
chamber experiments with a combination of elevated CO2 and 1.5°C of 
warming, maize and potato yields were observed to increase by 45.7% 
and 11%, respectively (Singh et al., 2013; Abebe et al., 2016). However, 
observations of trends in actual crop yields indicate that reductions 
as a result of climate change remain more common than crop yield 
increases, despite increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations (Porter 
et al., 2014). For instance, McGrath and Lobell (2013) indicated that 
production stimulation at increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations 
was mostly driven by differences in climate and crop species, whilst 
yield variability due to elevated CO2 was only about 50–70% of the 
variability due to climate. Importantly, the faster growth rates induced 
by elevated CO2 have been found to coincide with lower protein content 
in several important C3 cereal grains (Myers et al., 2014), although this 
may not always be the case for C4 grains, such as sorghum, under 
drought conditions (De Souza et al., 2015). Elevated CO2 concentrations 
of 568–590 ppm (a range that corresponds approximately to RCP6 in 
the 2080s and hence a warming of 2.3°C–3.3°C (van Vuuren et al., 
2011a, AR5 WGI Table 12.2 ) alone reduced the protein, micronutrient 
and B vitamin content of the 18 rice cultivars grown most widely in 
Southeast Asia, where it is a staple food source, by an amount sufficient 
to create nutrition-related health risks for 600 million people (Zhu et 
al., 2018). Overall, the effects of increased CO2 concentrations alone 
during the 21st century are therefore expected to have a negative 
impact on global food security (medium confidence).
Crop yields in the future will also be affected by projected changes in 
temperature and precipitation. Studies of major cereals showed that 
maize and wheat yields begin to decline with 1°C–2°C of local warming 
and under nitrogen stress conditions at low latitudes (high confidence) 
(Porter et al., 2014; Rosenzweig et al., 2014). A few studies since AR5 
have focused on the impacts on cropping systems for scenarios where 
the global mean temperature increase is within 1.5°C. Schleussner et 
al. (2016b) projected that constraining warming to 1.5°C rather than 
2°C would avoid significant risks of declining tropical crop yield in 
West Africa, Southeast Asia, and Central and South America. Ricke et al. 
(2016) highlighted that cropland stability declines rapidly between 1°C 
and 3°C of warming, whilst Bassu et al. (2014) found that an increase 
in air temperature negatively influences the modelled maize yield 
response by –0.5 t ha−1 °C–1 and Challinor et al. (2014) reported similar 
effect for tropical regions. Niang et al. (2014) projected significantly 
lower risks to crop productivity in Africa at 1.5°C compared to 2°C of 
warming. Lana et al. (2017) indicated that the impact of temperature 
increases on crop failure of maize hybrids would be much greater as 
temperatures increase by 2°C compared to 1.5°C (high confidence). J. 
Huang et al. (2017) found that limiting warming to 1.5°C compared 
to 2°C would reduce maize yield losses over drylands. Although 
Rosenzweig et al. (2017, 2018) did not find a clear distinction between 
yield declines or increases in some breadbasket regions between the 
two temperature levels, they generally did find projections of decreasing 
yields in breadbasket regions when the effects of CO2 fertilization were 
excluded. Iizumi et al. (2017) found smaller reductions in maize and 
soybean yields at 1.5°C than at 2°C of projected warming, higher rice 
production at 2°C than at 1.5°C, and no clear differences for wheat 
on a global mean basis. These results are largely consistent with those 
of other studies (Faye et al., 2018; Ruane et al., 2018). In the western 
Sahel and southern Africa, moving from 1.5°C to 2°C of warming has 
been projected to result in a further reduction of the suitability of maize, 
sorghum and cocoa cropping areas and yield losses, especially for C3 
crops, with rainfall change only partially compensating these impacts 
(Läderach et al., 2013; World Bank, 2013; Sultan and Gaetani, 2016).
A significant reduction has been projected for the global production of 
wheat (by 6.0 ± 2.9%), rice (by 3.2 ± 3.7%), maize (by 7.4 ± 4.5%), 
and soybean, (by 3.1%) for each degree Celsius increase in global 
mean temperature (Asseng et al., 2015; C. Zhao et al., 2017). Similarly, 
Li et al. (2017) indicated a significant reduction in rice yields for each 
degree Celsius increase, by about 10.3%, in the greater Mekong 
subregion (medium confidence; Cross-Chapter Box 6: Food Security 
in this chapter). Large rice and maize yield losses are to be expected 
in China, owing to climate extremes (medium confidence) (Wei et al., 
2017; Zhang et al., 2017).

Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems 
Chapter 3
While not often considered, crop production is also negatively affected 
by the increase in both direct and indirect climate extremes. Direct 
extremes include changes in rainfall extremes (Rosenzweig et al., 
2014), increases in hot nights (Welch et al., 2010; Okada et al., 2011), 
extremely high daytime temperatures (Schlenker and Roberts, 2009; 
Jiao et al., 2016; Lesk et al., 2016), drought (Jiao et al., 2016; Lesk et 
al., 2016), heat stress (Deryng et al., 2014, Betts et al., 2018), flooding 
(Betts et al., 2018; Byers et al., 2018), and chilling damage (Jiao et al., 
2016), while indirect effects include the spread of pests and diseases 
(Jiao et al., 2014; van Bruggen et al., 2015), which can also have 
detrimental effects on cropping systems. 
Taken together, the findings of studies on the effects of changes in 
temperature, precipitation, CO2 concentration and extreme weather 
events indicate that a global warming of 2°C is projected to result in a 
greater reduction in global crop yields and global nutrition than global 
warming of 1.5°C (high confidence; Section 3.6). 
3.4.6.2 Livestock production  
Studies of climate change impacts on livestock production are few in 
number. Climate change is expected to directly affect yield quantity and 
quality (Notenbaert et al., 2017), as well as indirectly impacting the 
livestock sector through feed quality changes and spread of pests and 
diseases (Kipling et al., 2016) (high confidence). Increased warming and 
its extremes are expected to cause changes in physiological processes 
in livestock (i.e., thermal distress, sweating and high respiratory rates) 
(Mortola and Frappell, 2000) and to have detrimental effects on animal 
feeding, growth rates (André et al., 2011; Renaudeau et al., 2011; Collier 
and Gebremedhin, 2015) and reproduction (De Rensis et al., 2015). Wall 
et al. (2010) observed reduced milk yields and increased cow mortality 
as the result of heat stress on dairy cow production over some UK 
regions. 
Further, a reduction in water supply might increase cattle water demand 
(Masike and Urich, 2008). Generally, heat stress can be responsible 
for domestic animal mortality increase and economic losses (Vitali et 
al., 2009), affecting a wide range of reproductive parameters (e.g., 
embryonic development and reproductive efficiency in pigs, Barati et al., 
2008; ovarian follicle development and ovulation in horses, Mortensen 
et al., 2009). Much attention has also been dedicated to ruminant 
diseases (e.g., liver fluke, Fox et al., 2011; blue-tongue virus, Guis et al., 
2012; foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), Brito et al. (2017); and zoonotic 
diseases, Njeru et al., 2016; Simulundu et al., 2017). 
Climate change impacts on livestock are expected to increase. In 
temperate climates, warming is expected to lengthen the forage 
growing season but decrease forage quality, with important variations 
due to rainfall changes (Craine et al., 2010; Hatfield et al., 2011; 
Izaurralde et al., 2011). Similarly, a decrease in forage quality is expected 
for both natural grassland in France (Graux et al., 2013) and sown 
pastures in Australia (Perring et al., 2010). Water resource availability 
for livestock is expected to decrease owing to increased runoff and 
reduced groundwater resources. Increased temperature will likely 
induce changes in river discharge and the amount of water in basins, 
leading human and livestock populations to experience water stress, 
especially in the driest areas (i.e., sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia) 
(medium confidence) (Palmer et al., 2008). Elevated temperatures are 
also expected to increase methane production (Knapp et al., 2014; M.A. 
Lee et al., 2017). Globally, a decline in livestock of 7–10% is expected at 
about 2°C of warming, with associated economic losses between $9.7 
and $12.6 billion (Boone et al., 2018).
3.4.6.3 Fisheries and aquaculture production  
Global fisheries and aquaculture contribute a total of 88.6 and 59.8 
million tonnes of fish and other products annually (FAO, 2016), 
and play important roles in the food security of a large number of 
countries (McClanahan et al., 2015; Pauly and Charles, 2015) as well 
as being essential for meeting the protein demand of a growing 
global population (Cinner et al., 2012, 2016; FAO, 2016; Pendleton 
et al., 2016). A steady increase in the risks associated with bivalve 
fisheries and aquaculture at mid-latitudes is coincident with increases 
in temperature, ocean acidification, introduced species, disease and 
other drivers ( Lacoue-Labarthe et al., 2016; Clements and Chopin, 
2017; Clements et al., 2017; Parker et al., 2017). Sea level rise and 
storm intensification pose a risk to hatcheries and other infrastructure 
(Callaway et al., 2012; Weatherdon et al., 2016), whilst others risks 
are associated with the invasion of parasites and pathogens (Asplund 
et al., 2014; Castillo et al., 2017). Specific human strategies have 
reduced these risks, which are expected to be moderate under RCP2.6 
and very high under RCP8.5 (Gattuso et al., 2015). The risks related 
to climate change for fin fish (Section 3.4.4) are producing a number 
of challenges for small-scale fisheries (e.g., Kittinger, 2013; Pauly and 
Charles, 2015; Bell et al., 2018). Recent literature from 2015 to 2017 
has described growing threats from rapid shifts in the biogeography 
of key species (Poloczanska et al., 2013, 2016; Burrows et al., 2014; 
García Molinos et al., 2015) and the ongoing rapid degradation of 
key ecosystems such as coral reefs, seagrass and mangroves (Section 
3.4.4, Box 3.4). The acceleration of these changes, coupled with non-
climate stresses (e.g., pollution, overfishing and unsustainable coastal 
development), are driving many small-scale fisheries well below the 
sustainable harvesting levels required to maintain these resources 
as a source of food (McClanahan et al., 2009, 2015; Cheung et al., 
2010; Pendleton et al., 2016). As a result, future scenarios surrounding 
climate change and global population growth increasingly project 
shortages of fish protein for many regions, such as the Pacific Ocean 
(Bell et al., 2013, 2018) and Indian Ocean (McClanahan et al., 2015). 
Mitigation of these risks involves marine spatial planning, fisheries 
repair, sustainable aquaculture, and the development of alternative 
livelihoods (Kittinger, 2013; McClanahan et al., 2015; Song and 
Chuenpagdee, 2015; Weatherdon et al., 2016). Other threats concern 
the increasing incidence of alien species and diseases (Kittinger et al., 
2013; Weatherdon et al., 2016).
Risks of impacts related to climate change on low-latitude small-scale 
fin fisheries are moderate today but are expected to reach very high 
levels by 1.1°C of global warming. Projections for mid- to high-latitude 
fisheries include increases in fishery productivity in some cases (Cheung 
et al., 2013; Hollowed et al., 2013; Lam et al., 2014; FAO, 2016). These 
projections are associated with the biogeographical shift of species 
towards higher latitudes (Fossheim et al., 2015), which brings benefits 
as well as challenges (e.g., increased production yet a greater risk of 
disease and invasive species; low confidence). Factors underpinning 
238
Chapter 3 
Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems

the expansion of fisheries production to high-latitude locations include 
warming, increased light levels and mixing due to retreating sea ice 
(Cheung et al., 2009), which result in substantial increases in primary 
productivity and fish harvesting in the North Pacific and North Atlantic 
(Hollowed and Sundby, 2014).
Present-day risks for mid-latitude bivalve fisheries and aquaculture 
become undetectible up to 1.1°C of global warming, moderate at 
1.3°C, and moderate to high up to 1.9°C (Figure 3.18). For instance, 
Cheung et al. (2016a), simulating the loss in fishery productivity 
at 1.5°C, 2°C and 3.5°C above the pre-industrial period, found that 
the potential global catch for marine fisheries will likely decrease by 
more than three million metric tonnes for each degree of warming. 
Low-latitude fin-fish fisheries have higher risks of impacts, with risks 
being moderate under present-day conditions and becoming high 
above 0.9°C and very high at 2°C of global warming. High-latitude 
fisheries are undergoing major transformations, and while production 
is increasing, present-day risk is moderate and is projected to remain 
moderate at 1.5°C and 2°C (Figure 3.18). 
Adaptation measures can be applied to shellfish, large pelagic fish 
resources and biodiversity, and they include options such as protecting 
reproductive stages and brood stocks from periods of high ocean 
acidification (OA), stock selection for high tolerance to OA (high 
confidence) (Ekstrom et al., 2015; Rodrigues et al., 2015; Handisyde 
et al., 2016; Lee, 2016; Weatherdon et al., 2016; Clements and Chopin, 
2017), redistribution of highly migratory resources (e.g., Pacific tuna) 
(high confidence), governance instruments such as international 
fisheries agreements (Lehodey et al., 2015; Matear et al., 2015), 
protection and regeneration of reef habitats, reduction of coral reef 
stresses, and development of alternative livelihoods (e.g., aquaculture; 
Bell et al., 2013, 2018).

Climate change influences food and nutritional security through its effects on food availability, quality, access and distribution (Paterson 
and Lima, 2010; Thornton et al., 2014; FAO, 2016). More than 815 million people were undernourished in 2016, and 11% of the world’s 
population has experienced recent decreases in food security, with higher percentages in Africa (20%), southern Asia (14.4%) and the 
Caribbean (17.7%) (FAO et al., 2017). Overall, food security is expected to be reduced at 2°C of global warming compared to 1.5°C, 
owing to projected impacts of climate change and extreme weather on yields, crop nutrient content, livestock, fisheries and aquaculture 
and land use (cover type and management) (Sections 3.4.3.6, 3.4.4.12 and 3.4.6), (high confidence). The effects of climate change 
on crop yield, cultivation area, presence of pests, food price and supplies are projected to have major implications for sustainable 
development, poverty eradication, inequality and the ability of the international community to meet the United Nations sustainable 
development goals (SDGs; Cross-Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 1). 
Goal 2 of the SDGs is to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture by 2030. This goal 
builds on the first millennium development goal (MDG-1) which focused on eradicating extreme poverty and hunger, through efforts 
that reduced the proportion of undernourished people in low- and middle-income countries from 23.3% in 1990 to 12.9% in 2015. 
Climate change threatens the capacity to achieve SDG 2 and could reverse the progress made already. Food security and agriculture 
are also critical to other aspects of sustainable development, including poverty eradication (SDG 1), health and well-being (SDG 3), 
clean water (SDG 6), decent work (SDG 8), and the protection of ecosystems on land (SDG 14) and in water (SDG 15) (UN, 2015, 2017; 
Pérez-Escamilla, 2017). 
Increasing global temperature poses large risks to food security globally and regionally, especially in low-latitude areas (medium 
confidence) (Cheung et al., 2010; Rosenzweig et al., 2013; Porter et al., 2014; Rosenzweig and Hillel, 2015; Lam et al., 2016), with warming 
of 2°C projected to result in a greater reduction in global crop yields and global nutrition than warming of 1.5°C (high confidence) (Section 
3.4.6), owing to the combined effects of changes in temperature, precipitation and extreme weather events, as well as increasing CO2 
concentrations. Climate change can exacerbate malnutrition by reducing nutrient availability and the quality of food products (medium 
confidence) (Cramer et al., 2014; Zhu et al., 2018). Generally, vulnerability to decreases in water and food availability is projected to be 
reduced at 1.5°C versus 2°C (Cheung et al., 2016a; Betts et al., 2018), especially in regions such as the African Sahel, the Mediterranean, 
central Europe, the Amazon, and western and southern Africa (medium confidence) (Sultan and Gaetani, 2016; Lehner et al., 2017; Betts 
et al., 2018; Byers et al., 2018; Rosenzweig et al., 2018).

Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems 
Chapter 3
Rosenzweig et al. (2018) and Ruane et al. (2018) reported that the higher CO2 concentrations associated with 2°C as compared to 
those at 1.5°C of global warming are projected to drive positive effects in some regions. Production can also benefit from warming in 
higher latitudes, with more fertile soils, favouring crops, and grassland production, in contrast to the situation at low latitudes (Section 
3.4.6), and similar benefits could arise for high-latitude fisheries production (high confidence) (Section 3.4.6.3). Studies exploring 
regional climate change risks on crop production are strongly influenced by the use of different regional climate change projections 
and by the assumed strength of CO2 fertilization effects (Section 3.6), which are uncertain. For C3 crops, theoretically advantageous 
CO2 fertilization effects may not be realized in the field; further, they are often accompanied by losses in protein and nutrient content of 
crops (Section 3.6), and hence these projected benefits may not be realized. In addition, some micronutrients such as iron and zinc will 
accumulate less and be less available in food (Myers et al., 2014). Together, the impacts on protein availability may bring as many as 
150 million people into protein deficiency by 2050 (Medek et al., 2017). However, short-term benefits could arise for high-latitude 
fisheries production as waters warm, sea ice contracts and primary productivity increases under climate change (high confidence) 
(Section 3.4.6.3; Cheung et al., 2010; Hollowed and Sundby, 2014; Lam et al., 2016; Sundby et al., 2016; Weatherdon et al., 2016).
Factors affecting the projections of food security include variability in regional climate projections, climate change mitigation (where 
land use is involved; see Section 3.6 and Cross-Chapter Box 7 in this chapter) and biological responses (medium confidence) (Section 
3.4.6.1; McGrath and Lobell, 2013; Elliott et al., 2014; Pörtner et al., 2014; Durand et al., 2018), extreme events such as droughts 
and floods (high confidence) (Sections 3.4.6.1, 3.4.6.2; Rosenzweig et al., 2014; Wei et al., 2017), financial volatility (Kannan et al., 
2000; Ghosh, 2010; Naylor and Falcon, 2010; HLPE, 2011), and the distributions of pests and disease (Jiao et al., 2014; van Bruggen 
et al., 2015). Changes in temperature and precipitation are projected to increase global food prices by 3–84% by 2050 (IPCC, 2013). 
Differences in price impacts of climate change are accompanied by differences in land-use change (Nelson et al., 2014b), energy policies 
and food trade (Mueller et al., 2011; Wright, 2011; Roberts and Schlenker, 2013). Fisheries and aquatic production systems (aquaculture) 
face similar challenges to those of crop and livestock sectors (Section 3.4.6.3; Asiedu et al., 2017a, b; Utete et al., 2018). Human 
influences on food security include demography, patterns of food waste, diet shifts, incomes and prices, storage, health status, trade 
patterns, conflict, and access to land and governmental or other assistance (Chapters 4 and 5). Across all these systems, the efficiency 
of adaptation strategies is uncertain because it is strongly linked with future economic and trade environments and their response to 
changing food availability (medium confidence) (Lobell et al., 2011; von Lampe et al., 2014; d’Amour et al., 2016; Wei et al., 2017). 
Climate change impacts on food security can be reduced through adaptation (Hasegawa et al., 2014). While climate change is projected 
to decrease agricultural yield, the consequences could be reduced substantially at 1.5°C versus 2°C with appropriate investment (high 
confidence) (Neumann et al., 2010; Muller, 2011; Roudier et al., 2011), awareness-raising to help inform farmers of new technologies for 
maintaining yield, and strong adaptation strategies and policies that develop sustainable agricultural choices (Sections 4.3.2 and 4.5.3). 
In this regard, initiatives such as ‘climate-smart’ food production and distribution systems may assist via technologies and adaptation 
strategies for food systems (Lipper et al., 2014; Martinez-Baron et al., 2018; Whitfield et al., 2018), as well as helping meet mitigation 
goals (Harvey et al., 2014). 
K.R. Smith et al. (2014) concluded that climate change will exacerbate current levels of childhood undernutrition and stunting through 
reduced food availability. As well, climate change can drive undernutrition-related childhood mortality, and increase disability-adjusted 
life years lost, with the largest risks in Asia and Africa (Supplementary Material 3.SM, Table 3.SM.12; Ishida et al., 2014; Hasegawa et al., 
2016; Springmann et al., 2016). Studies comparing the health risks associated with reduced food security at 1.5°C and 2°C concluded 
that risks would be higher and the globally undernourished population larger at 2°C (Hales et al., 2014; Ishida et al., 2014; Hasegawa 
et al., 2016). Climate change impacts on dietary and weight-related risk factors are projected to increase mortality, owing to global 
reductions in food availability and consumption of fruit, vegetables and red meat (Springmann et al., 2016). Further, temperature 
increases are projected to reduce the protein and micronutrient content of major cereal crops, which is expected to further affect food 
and nutritional security (Myers et al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2018). 
Strategies for improving food security often do so in complex settings such as the Mekong River basin in Southeast Asia. The Mekong is 
a major food bowl (Smajgl et al., 2015) but is also a climate change hotspot (de Sherbinin, 2014; Lebel et al., 2014). This area is also a 
useful illustration of the complexity of adaptation choices and actions in a 1.5°C warmer world. Climate projections include increased 
annual average temperatures and precipitation in the Mekong (Zhang et al., 2017), as well as increased flooding and related disaster risks 
(T.F. Smith et al., 2013; Ling et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016). Sea level rise and saline intrusion are ongoing risks to agricultural systems 
in this area by reducing soil fertility and limiting the crop productivity (Renaud et al., 2015). The main climate impacts in the Mekong are 
expected to be on ecosystem health, through salinity intrusion, biomass reduction and biodiversity losses (Le Dang et al., 2013; Smajgl 
et al., 2015); agricultural productivity and food security (Smajgl et al., 2015); livelihoods such as fishing and farming (D. Wu et al., 2013); 
and disaster risk (D. Wu et al., 2013; Hoang et al., 2016), with implications for human mortality and economic and infrastructure losses.

Adaptation imperatives and costs in the Mekong will be higher under higher temperatures and associated impacts on agriculture 
and aquaculture, hazard exposure, and infrastructure. Adaptation measures to meet food security include greater investment in crop 
diversification and integrated agriculture–aquaculture practices (Renaud et al., 2015), improvement of water-use technologies (e.g., 
irrigation, pond capacity improvement and rainwater harvesting), soil management, crop diversification, and strengthening allied 
sectors such as livestock rearing and aquaculture (ICEM, 2013). Ecosystem-based approaches, such as integrated water resources 
management, demonstrate successes in mainstreaming adaptation into existing strategies (Sebesvari et al., 2017). However, some of 
these adaptive strategies can have negative impacts that deepen the divide between land-wealthy and land-poor farmers (Chapman 
et al., 2016). Construction of high dikes, for example, has enabled triple-cropping, which benefits land-wealthy farmers but leads to 
increasing debt for land-poor farmers (Chapman and Darby, 2016). 
Institutional innovation has happened through the Mekong River Commission (MRC), which is an intergovernmental body between 
Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand and Viet Nam that was established in 1995. The MRC has facilitated impact assessment studies, regional 
capacity building and local project implementation (Schipper et al., 2010), although the mainstreaming of adaptation into development 
policies has lagged behind needs (Gass et al., 2011). Existing adaptation interventions can be strengthened through greater flexibility 
of institutions dealing with land-use planning and agricultural production, improved monitoring of saline intrusion, and the installation 
of early warning systems that can be accessed by the local authorities or farmers (Renaud et al., 2015; Hoang et al., 2016; Tran et al., 
2018). It is critical to identify and invest in synergistic strategies from an ensemble of infrastructural options (e.g., building dikes); soft 
adaptation measures (e.g., land-use change) (Smajgl et al., 2015; Hoang et al., 2018); combinations of top-down government-led (e.g., 
relocation) and bottom-up household strategies (e.g., increasing house height) (Ling et al., 2015); and community-based adaptation 
initiatives that merge scientific knowledge with local solutions (Gustafson et al., 2016, 2018; Tran et al., 2018). Special attention needs 
to be given to strengthening social safety nets and livelihood assets whilst ensuring that adaptation plans are mainstreamed into 
broader development goals (Sok and Yu, 2015; Kim et al., 2017). The combination of environmental, social and economic pressures on 
people in the Mekong River basin highlights the complexity of climate change impacts and adaptation in this region, as well as the fact 
that costs are projected to be much lower at 1.5°C than 2°C of global warming.

3.4.7 
Human Health
Climate change adversely affects human health by increasing exposure 
and vulnerability to climate-related stresses, and decreasing the 
capacity of health systems to manage changes in the magnitude and 
pattern of climate-sensitive health outcomes (Cramer et al., 2014; Hales 
et al., 2014). Changing weather patterns are associated with shifts in 
the geographic range, seasonality and transmission intensity of selected 
climate-sensitive infectious diseases (e.g., Semenza and Menne, 2009), 
and increasing morbidity and mortality are associated with extreme 
weather and climate events (e.g., K.R. Smith et al., 2014). Health 
detection and attribution studies conducted since AR5 have provided 
evidence, using multistep attribution, that climate change is negatively 
affecting adverse health outcomes associated with heatwaves, 
Lyme disease in Canada, and Vibrio emergence in northern Europe 
(Mitchell, 2016; Mitchell et al., 2016; Ebi et al., 2017). The IPCC AR5 
concluded there is high to very high confidence that climate change 
will lead to greater risks of injuries, disease and death, owing to more 
intense heatwaves and fires, increased risks of undernutrition, and 
consequences of reduced labour productivity in vulnerable populations 
(K.R. Smith et al., 2014). 
3.4.7.1 Projected risk at 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming 
The projected risks to human health of warming of 1.5°C and 2°C, 
based on studies of temperature-related morbidity and mortality, 
air quality and vector borne diseases assessed in and since AR5, are 
summarized in Supplementary Material 3.SM, Tables 3.SM.8, 3.SM.9 
and 3.SM.10 (based on Ebi et al., 2018). Other climate-sensitive 
health outcomes, such as diarrheal diseases, mental health issues 
and the full range of sources of poor air quality, were not considered 
because of the lack of projections of how risks could change at 1.5°C 
and 2°C. Few projections were available for specific temperatures 
above pre-industrial levels; Supplementary Material 3.SM, Table 
3.SM.7 provides the conversions used to translate risks projected for 
particular time slices to those for specific temperature changes (Ebi 
et al., 2018).
Temperature-related morbidity and mortality: The magnitude of 
projected heat-related morbidity and mortality is greater at 2°C than 
at 1.5°C of global warming (very high confidence)(Doyon et al., 2008; 
Jackson et al., 2010; Hanna et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2012; Petkova 
et al., 2013; Hajat et al., 2014; Hales et al., 2014; Honda et al., 2014; 
Vardoulakis et al., 2014; Garland et al., 2015; Huynen and Martens, 
2015; Li et al., 2015; Schwartz et al., 2015; L. Wang et al., 2015; 
Guo et al., 2016; T. Li et al., 2016; Chung et al., 2017; Kendrovski 
et al., 2017; Mishra et al., 2017; Arnell et al., 2018; Mitchell et al., 
2018b). The number of people exposed to heat events is projected 
to be greater at 2°C than at 1.5°C (Russo et al., 2016; Mora et al., 
2017; Byers et al., 2018; Harrington and Otto, 2018; King et al., 
2018). The extent to which morbidity and mortality are projected 
to increase varies by region, presumably because of differences in 
acclimatization, population vulnerability, the built environment, 
access to air conditioning and other factors (Russo et al., 2016; Mora 
et al., 2017; Byers et al., 2018; Harrington and Otto, 2018; King et 
al., 2018). Populations at highest risk include older adults, children, 
241

Chapter 3
women, those with chronic diseases, and people taking certain 
medications (very high confidence). Assuming adaptation takes place 
reduces the projected magnitude of risks (Hales et al., 2014; Huynen 
and Martens, 2015; T. Li et al., 2016). 
In some regions, cold-related mortality is projected to decrease with 
increasing temperatures, although increases in heat-related mortality 
generally are projected to outweigh any reductions in cold-related 
mortality with warmer winters, with the heat-related risks increasing 
with greater degrees of warming (Huang et al., 2012; Hajat et al., 2014; 
Vardoulakis et al., 2014; Gasparrini et al., 2015; Huynen and Martens, 
2015; Schwartz et al., 2015).
Occupational health: Higher ambient temperatures and humidity levels 
place additional stress on individuals engaging in physical activity. Safe 
work activity and worker productivity during the hottest months of the 
year would be increasingly compromised with additional climate change 
(medium confidence) (Dunne et al., 2013; Kjellstrom et al., 2013, 2018; 
Sheffield et al., 2013; Habibi Mohraz et al., 2016). Patterns of change may 
be complex; for example, at 1.5°C, there could be about a 20% reduction 
in areas experiencing severe heat stress in East Asia, compared to 
significant increases in low latitudes at 2°C (Lee and Min, 2018). The costs 
of preventing workplace heat-related illnesses through worker breaks 
suggest that the difference in economic loss between 1.5°C and 2°C could 
be approximately 0.3% of global gross domestic product (GDP) in 2100 
(Takakura et al., 2017). In China, taking into account population growth 
and employment structure, high temperature subsidies for employees 
working on extremely hot days are projected to increase from 38.6 billion 
yuan yr–1 in 1979–2005 to 250 billion yuan yr–1 in the 2030s (about 1.5°C) 
(Zhao et al., 2016).
Air quality: Because ozone formation is temperature dependent, 
projections focusing only on temperature increase generally conclude 
that ozone-related mortality will increase with additional warming, with 
the risks higher at 2°C than at 1.5°C (high confidence) (Supplementary 
Material 3.SM, Table 3.SM.9; Heal et al., 2013; Tainio et al., 2013; 
Likhvar et al., 2015; Silva et al., 2016; Dionisio et al., 2017; J.Y. Lee 
et al., 2017). Reductions in precursor emissions would reduce future 
ozone concentrations and associated mortality. Mortality associated 
with exposure to particulate matter could increase or decrease in the 
future, depending on climate projections and emissions assumptions 
(Supplementary Material 3.SM, Table 3.SM.8; Tainio et al., 2013; 
Likhvar et al., 2015; Silva et al., 2016).
Malaria: Recent projections of the potential impacts of climate 
change on malaria globally and for Asia, Africa, and South America 
(Supplementary Material 3.SM, Table 3.SM.10) confirm that weather 
and climate are among the drivers of the geographic range, intensity of 
transmission, and seasonality of malaria, and that the relationships are 
not necessarily linear, resulting in complex patterns of changes in risk 
with additional warming (very high confidence) (Ren et al., 2016; Song 
et al., 2016; Semakula et al., 2017). Projections suggest that the burden 
of malaria could increase with climate change because of a greater 
geographic range of the Anopheles vector, longer season, and/or 
increase in the number of people at risk, with larger burdens at higher 
levels of warming, but with regionally variable patterns (medium to 
high confidence). Vector populations are projected to shift with climate 
change, with expansions and reductions depending on the degree of 
local warming, the ecology of the mosquito vector, and other factors 
(Ren et al., 2016).
Aedes (mosquito vector for dengue fever, chikungunya, yellow 
fever and Zika virus): Projections of the geographic distribution of 
Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus (principal vectors) or of the prevalence 
of dengue fever generally conclude that there will be an increase in the 
number of mosquitos and a larger geographic range at 2°C than at 
1.5°C, and they suggest that more individuals will be at risk of dengue 
fever, with regional differences (high confidence) (Fischer et al., 2011, 
2013; Colón-González et al., 2013, 2018; Bouzid et al., 2014; Ogden 
et al., 2014a; Mweya et al., 2016). The risks increase with greater 
warming. Projections suggest that climate change is projected to 
expand the geographic range of chikungunya, with greater expansions 
occurring at higher degrees of warming (Tjaden et al., 2017).
Other vector-borne diseases: Increased warming in North 
America and Europe could result in geographic expansions of 
regions (latitudinally and altitudinally) climatically suitable for West 
Nile virus transmission, particularly along the current edges of its 
transmission areas, and extension of the transmission season, with 
the magnitude and pattern of changes varying by location and level 
of warming (Semenza et al., 2016). Most projections conclude that 
climate change could expand the geographic range and seasonality 
of Lyme and other tick-borne diseases in parts of North America and 
Europe (Ogden et al., 2014b; Levi et al., 2015). The projected changes 
are larger with greater warming and under higher greenhouse gas 
emissions pathways. Projections of the impacts of climate change on 
leishmaniosis and Chagas disease indicate that climate change could 
increase or decrease future health burdens, with greater impacts 
occurring at higher degrees of warming (González et al., 2014; 
Ceccarelli and Rabinovich, 2015).
In summary, warming of 2°C poses greater risks to human health than 
warming of 1.5°C, often with the risks varying regionally, with a few 
exceptions (high confidence). There is very high confidence that each 
additional unit of warming could increase heat-related morbidity and 
mortality, and that adaptation would reduce the magnitude of impacts. 
There is high confidence that ozone-related mortality could increase if 
precursor emissions remain the same, and that higher temperatures 
could affect the transmission of some infectious diseases, with 
increases and decreases projected depending on the disease (e.g., 
malaria, dengue fever, West Nile virus and Lyme disease), region and 
degree of temperature change. 
3.4.8 
Urban Areas
There is new literature on urban climate change and its differential 
impacts on and risks for infrastructure sectors – energy, water, transport 
and buildings – and vulnerable populations, including those living in 
informal settlements (UCCRN, 2018). However, there is limited literature 
on the risks of warming of 1.5°C and 2°C in urban areas. Heat-related 
extreme events (Matthews et al., 2017), variability in precipitation (Yu 
et al., 2018) and sea level rise can directly affect urban areas (Section 
3.4.5, Bader et al., 2018; Dawson et al., 2018). Indirect risks may arise 
from interactions between urban and natural systems.
242
Chapter 3 
Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems
3
Future warming and urban expansion could lead to more extreme 
heat stress (Argüeso et al., 2015; Suzuki-Parker et al., 2015). At 1.5°C 
of warming, twice as many megacities (such as Lagos, Nigeria and 
Shanghai, China) could become heat stressed, exposing more than 
350 million more people to deadly heat by 2050 under midrange 
population growth. Without considering adaptation options, such 
as cooling from more reflective roofs, and overall characteristics of 
urban agglomerations in terms of land use, zoning and building codes 
(UCCRN, 2018), Karachi (Pakistan) and Kolkata (India) could experience 
conditions equivalent to the deadly 2015 heatwaves on an annual 
basis under 2°C of warming (Akbari et al., 2009; Oleson et al., 2010; 
Matthews et al., 2017). Warming of 2°C is expected to increase the 
risks of heatwaves in China’s urban agglomerations (Yu et al., 2018). 
Stabilizing at 1.5°C of warming instead of 2°C could decrease mortality 
related to extreme temperatures in key European cities, assuming no 
adaptation and constant vulnerability (Jacob et al., 2018; Mitchell et 
al., 2018a). Holding temperature change to below 2°C but taking urban 
heat islands (UHI) into consideration, projections indicate that there 
could be a substantial increase in the occurrence of deadly heatwaves in 
cities. The urban impacts of these heatwaves are expected to be similar 
at 1.5°C and 2°C and substantially larger than under the present climate 
(Matthews et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2018). Increases in the intensity of 
UHI could exacerbate warming of urban areas, with projections ranging 
from a 6% decrease to a 30% increase for a doubling of CO2 (McCarthy 
et al., 2010). Increases in population and city size, in the context of a 
warmer climate, are projected to increase UHI (Georgescu et al., 2012; 
Argüeso et al., 2014; Conlon et al., 2016; Kusaka et al., 2016; Grossman-
Clarke et al., 2017).
For extreme heat events, an additional 0.5°C of warming implies 
a shift from the upper bounds of observed natural variability to a 
new global climate regime (Schleussner et al., 2016b), with distinct 
implications for the urban poor (Revi et al., 2014; Jean-Baptiste et al., 
2018; UCCRN, 2018). Adverse impacts of extreme events could arise 
in tropical coastal areas of Africa, South America and Southeast Asia 
(Schleussner et al., 2016b). These urban coastal areas in the tropics 
are particularly at risk given their large informal settlements and other 
vulnerable urban populations, as well as vulnerable assets, including 
businesses and critical urban infrastructure (energy, water, transport 
and buildings) (McGranahan et al., 2007; Hallegatte et al., 2013; Revi 
et al., 2014; UCCRN, 2018). Mediterranean water stress is projected 
to increase from 9% at 1.5°C to 17% at 2°C compared to values in 
1986–2005 period. Regional dry spells are projected to expand from 
7% at 1.5°C to 11% at 2°C for the same reference period. Sea level rise 
is expected to be lower at 1.5°C than 2°C, lowering risks for coastal 
metropolitan agglomerations (Schleussner et al., 2016b). 
Climate models are better at projecting implications of greenhouse 
gas forcing on physical systems than at assessing differential risks 
associated with achieving a specific temperature target (James et 
al., 2017). These challenges in managing risks are amplified when 
combined with the scale of urban areas and assumptions about socio-
economic pathways (Krey et al., 2012; Kamei et al., 2016; Yu et al., 
2016; Jiang and Neill, 2017). 
In summary, in the absence of adaptation, in most cases, warming 
of 2°C poses greater risks to urban areas than warming of 1.5°C, 
depending on the vulnerability of the location (coastal or non-coastal) 
(high confidence), businesses, infrastructure sectors (energy, water 
and transport), levels of poverty, and the mix of formal and informal 
settlements.
3.4.9 
Key Economic Sectors and Services
Climate change could affect tourism, energy systems and transportation 
through direct impacts on operations (e.g., sea level rise) and through 
impacts on supply and demand, with the risks varying significantly with 
geographic region, season and time. Projected risks also depend on 
assumptions with respect to population growth, the rate and pattern 
of urbanization, and investments in infrastructure. Table 3.SM.11 in 
Supplementary Material 3.SM summarizes the cited publications. 
3.4.9.1 Tourism
The implications of climate change for the global tourism sector are 
far-reaching and are impacting sector investments, destination assets 
(environment and cultural), operational and transportation costs, and 
tourist demand patterns (Scott et al., 2016a; Scott and Gössling, 2018). 
Since AR5, observed impacts on tourism markets and destination 
communities continue to be not well analysed, despite the many 
analogue conditions (e.g., heatwaves, major hurricanes, wild fires, 
reduced snow pack, coastal erosion and coral reef bleaching) that 
are anticipated to occur more frequently with climate change. There 
is some evidence that observed impacts on tourism assets, such as 
environmental and cultural heritage, are leading to the development of 
‘last chance to see’ tourism markets, where travellers visit destinations 
before they are substantially degraded by climate change impacts or 
to view the impacts of climate change on landscapes (Lemelin et al., 
2012; Stewart et al., 2016; Piggott-McKellar and McNamara, 2017). 
There is limited research on the differential risks of a 1.5° versus 
2°C temperature increase and resultant environmental and socio-
economic impacts in the tourism sector. The translation of these 
changes in climate resources for tourism into projections of tourism 
demand remains geographically limited to Europe. Based on analyses 
of tourist comfort, summer and spring/autumn tourism in much 
of western Europe may be favoured by 1.5°C of warming, but with 
negative effects projected for Spain and Cyprus (decreases of 8% and 
2%, respectively, in overnight stays) and most coastal regions of the 
Mediterranean (Jacob et al., 2018). Similar geographic patterns of 
potential tourism gains (central and northern Europe) and reduced 
summer favourability (Mediterranean countries) are projected under 
2°C (Grillakis et al., 2016). Considering potential changes in natural 
snow only, winter overnight stays at 1.5°C are projected to decline 
by 1–2% in Austria, Italy and Slovakia, with an additional 1.9 million 
overnight stays lost under 2°C of warming (Jacob et al., 2018). Using 
an econometric analysis of the relationship between regional tourism 
demand and climate conditions, Ciscar et al. (2014) projected that a 
2°C warmer world would reduce European tourism by 5% (€15 billion 
yr–1), with losses of up to 11% (€6 billion yr–1) for southern Europe and 
a potential gain of €0.5 billion yr–1 in the UK.
There is growing evidence that the magnitude of projected impacts is 
temperature dependent and that sector risks could be much greater 
243

Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems 
Chapter 3
with higher temperature increases and resultant environmental 
and socio-economic impacts (Markham et al., 2016; Scott et al., 
2016a; Jones, 2017; Steiger et al., 2017). Studies from 27 countries 
consistently project substantially decreased reliability of ski areas that 
are dependent on natural snow, increased snowmaking requirements 
and investment in snowmaking systems, shortened and more variable 
ski seasons, a contraction in the number of operating ski areas, 
altered competitiveness among and within regional ski markets, 
and subsequent impacts on employment and the value of vacation 
properties (Steiger et al., 2017). Studies that omit snowmaking do 
not reflect the operating realities of most ski areas and overestimate 
impacts at 1.5°C–2°C. In all regional markets, the extent and timing 
of these impacts depend on the magnitude of climate change and the 
types of adaptive responses by the ski industry, skiers and destination 
communities. The decline in the number of former Olympic Winter 
Games host locations that could remain climatically reliable for future 
Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games has been projected to be much 
greater under scenarios warmer than 2°C (Scott et al., 2015; Jacob et 
al., 2018).
The tourism sector is also affected by climate-induced changes in 
environmental assets critical for tourism, including biodiversity, 
beaches, glaciers and other features important for environmental and 
cultural heritage. Limited analyses of projected risks associated with 
1.5°C versus 2°C are available (Section 3.4.4.12). A global analysis of 
sea level rise (SLR) risk to 720 UNESCO Cultural World Heritage sites 
projected that about 47 sites might be affected under 1°C of warming, 
with this number increasing to 110 and 136 sites under 2°C and 3°C, 
respectively (Marzeion and Levermann, 2014). Similar risks to vast 
worldwide coastal tourism infrastructure and beach assets remain 
unquantified for most major tourism destinations and small island 
developing states (SIDS) that economically depend on coastal tourism. 
One exception is the projection that an eventual 1 m SLR could 
partially or fully inundate 29% of 900 coastal resorts in 19 Caribbean 
countries, with a substantially higher proportion (49–60%) vulnerable 
to associated coastal erosion (Scott and Verkoeyen, 2017).
A major barrier to understanding the risks of climate change for tourism, 
from the destination community scale to the global scale, has been 
the lack of integrated sectoral assessments that analyse the full range 
of potential compounding impacts and their interactions with other 
major drivers of tourism (Rosselló-Nadal, 2014; Scott et al., 2016b). 
When applied to 181 countries, a global vulnerability index including 
27 indicators found that countries with the lowest risk are located in 
western and northern Europe, central Asia, Canada and New Zealand, 
while the highest sector risks are projected for Africa, the Middle 
East, South Asia and SIDS in the Caribbean, Indian and Pacific Oceans 
(Scott and Gössling, 2018). Countries with the highest risks and where 
tourism represents a significant proportion of the national economy 
(i.e., more than 15% of GDP) include many SIDS and least developed 
countries. Sectoral climate change risk also aligns strongly with regions 
where tourism growth is projected to be the strongest over the coming 
decades, including sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, pointing to an 
important potential barrier to tourism development. The transnational 
implications of these impacts on the highly interconnected global 
tourism sector and the contribution of tourism to achieving the 2030 
sustainable development goals (SDGs) remain important uncertainties.
In summary, climate is an important factor influencing the geography 
and seasonality of tourism demand and spending globally (very high 
confidence). Increasing temperatures are projected to directly impact 
climate-dependent tourism markets, including sun, beach and snow 
sports tourism, with lesser risks for other tourism markets that are less 
climate sensitive (high confidence). The degradation or loss of beach 
and coral reef assets is expected to increase risks for coastal tourism, 
particularly in subtropical and tropical regions (high confidence).
3.4.9.2 Energy systems
Climate change is projected to lead to an increased demand for air 
conditioning in most tropical and subtropical regions (Arent et al., 
2014; Hong and Kim, 2015) (high confidence). Increasing temperatures 
will decrease the thermal efficiency of fossil, nuclear, biomass and 
solar power generation technologies, as well as buildings and other 
infrastructure (Arent et al., 2014). For example, in Ethiopia, capital 
expenditures through 2050 might either decrease by approximately 
3% under extreme wet scenarios or increase by up to 4% under a 
severe dry scenario (Block and Strzepek, 2012). 
Impacts on energy systems can affect gross domestic product (GDP). 
The economic damage in the United States from climate change is 
estimated to be, on average, roughly 1.2% cost of GDP per year per 
1°C increase under RCP8.5 (Hsiang et al., 2017). Projections of GDP 
indicate that negative impacts of energy demand associated with 
space heating and cooling in 2100 will be greatest (median: –0.94% 
change in GDP) under 4°C (RCP8.5) compared with under 1.5°C 
(median: –0.05%), depending on the socio-economic conditions (Park 
et al., 2018). Additionally, projected total energy demands for heating 
and cooling at the global scale do not change much with increases in 
global mean surface temperature (GMST) of up to 2°C. A high degree 
of variability is projected between regions (Arnell et al., 2018).
Evidence for the impact of climate change on energy systems since AR5 
is limited. Globally, gross hydropower potential is projected to increase 
(by 2.4% under RCP2.6 and by 6.3% under RCP8.5 for the 2080s), with 
the most growth expected in Central Africa, Asia, India and northern 
high latitudes (van Vliet et al., 2016). Byers et al. (2018) found that 
energy impacts at 2°C increase, including more cooling degree days, 
especially in tropical regions, as well as increased hydro-climatic risk 
to thermal and hydropower plants predominantly in Europe, North 
America, South and Southeast Asia and southeast Brazil. Donk et al. 
(2018) assessed future climate impacts on hydropower in Suriname 
and projected a decrease of approximately 40% in power capacity 
for a global temperature increase in the range of 1.5°C. At minimum 
and maximum increases in global mean temperature of 1.35°C and 
2°C, the overall stream flow in Florida, USA is projected to increase 
by an average of 21%, with pronounced seasonal variations, resulting 
in increases in power generation in winter (+72%) and autumn 
(+15%) and decreases in summer (–14%; Chilkoti et al., 2017). Greater 
changes are projected at higher temperature increases. In a reference 
scenario with global mean temperatures rising by 1.7°C from 2005 
to 2050, U.S. electricity demand in 2050 was 1.6–6.5% higher than 
in a control scenario with constant temperatures (McFarland et al., 
2015). Decreased electricity generation of –15% is projected for Brazil 
starting in 2040, with values expected to decline to –28% later in the 
244
Chapter 3 
Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems
3
century (de Queiroz et al., 2016). In large parts of Europe, electricity 
demand is projected to decrease, mainly owing to reduced heating 
demand (Jacob et al., 2018).
In Europe, no major differences in large-scale wind energy resources 
or in inter- or intra-annual variability are projected for 2016–2035 
under RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 (Carvalho et al., 2017). However, in 2046–
2100, wind energy density is projected to decrease in eastern Europe 
(–30%) and increase in Baltic regions (+30%). Intra-annual variability 
is expected to increase in northern Europe and decrease in southern 
Europe. Under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, the annual energy yield of European 
wind farms as a whole, as projected to be installed by 2050, will remain 
stable (±5 yield for all climate models). However, wind farm yields are 
projected to undergo changes of up to 15% in magnitude at country 
and local scales and of 5% at the regional scale (Tobin et al., 2015, 
2016). Hosking et al. (2018) assessed wind power generation over 
Europe for 1.5°C of warming and found the potential for wind energy 
to be greater than previously assumed in northern Europe. Additionally, 
Tobin et al. (2018) assessed impacts under 1.5°C and 2°C of warming 
on wind, solar photovoltaic and thermoelectric power generation 
across Europe. These authors found that photovoltaic and wind power 
might be reduced by up to 10%, and hydropower and thermoelectric 
generation might decrease by up to 20%, with impacts being limited 
at 1.5°C of warming but increasing as temperature increases (Tobin et 
al., 2018).
3.4.9.3 Transportation
Road, air, rail, shipping and pipeline transportation can be impacted 
directly or indirectly by weather and climate, including increases in 
precipitation and temperature; extreme weather events (flooding and 
storms); SLR; and incidence of freeze–thaw cycles (Arent et al., 2014). 
Much of the published research on the risks of climate change for the 
transportation sector has been qualitative. 
The limited new research since AR5 supports the notion that increases 
in global temperatures will impact the transportation sector. Warming 
is projected to result in increased numbers of days of ice-free navigation 
and a longer shipping season in cold regions, thus affecting shipping 
and reducing transportation costs (Arent et al., 2014). In the North Sea 
Route, large-scale commercial shipping might not be possible until 
2030 for bulk shipping and until 2050 for container shipping under 
RCP8.5. A 0.05% increase in mean temperature is projected from an 
increase in short-lived pollutants, as well as elevated CO2 and non-CO2 
emissions, associated with additional economic growth enabled by the 
North Sea Route. (Yumashev et al., 2017). Open water vessel transit 
has the potential to double by mid-century, with a two to four month 
longer season (Melia et al., 2016).
3.4.10 
Livelihoods and Poverty, and the Changing 
Structure of Communities 
Multiple drivers and embedded social processes influence the 
magnitude and pattern of livelihoods and poverty, as well as the 
changing structure of communities related to migration, displacement 
and conflict (Adger et al., 2014). In AR5, evidence of a climate change 
signal was limited, with more evidence of impacts of climate change on 
the places where indigenous people live and use traditional ecological 
knowledge (Olsson et al., 2014).
3.4.10.1  Livelihoods and poverty
At approximately 1.5°C of global warming (2030), climate change is 
expected to be a poverty multiplier that makes poor people poorer and 
increases the poverty head count (Hallegatte et al., 2016; Hallegatte 
and Rozenberg, 2017). Poor people might be heavily affected by climate 
change even when impacts on the rest of population are limited. 
Climate change alone could force more than 3 million to 16 million 
people into extreme poverty, mostly through impacts on agriculture 
and food prices (Hallegatte et al., 2016; Hallegatte and Rozenberg, 
2017). Unmitigated warming could reshape the global economy later 
in the century by reducing average global incomes and widening 
global income inequality (Burke et al., 2015b). The most severe impacts 
are projected for urban areas and some rural regions in sub-Saharan 
Africa and Southeast Asia.
3.4.10.2 The changing structure of communities: 
migration, displacement and conflict
Migration: In AR5, the potential impacts of climate change on migration 
and displacement were identified as an emerging risk (Oppenheimer et 
al., 2014). The social, economic and environmental factors underlying 
migration are complex and varied; therefore, detecting the effect of 
observed climate change or assessing its possible magnitude with any 
degree of confidence is challenging (Cramer et al., 2014). 
No studies have specifically explored the difference in risks between 
1.5°C and 2°C of warming on human migration. The literature 
consistently highlights the complexity of migration decisions and the 
difficulties in attributing causation (e.g., Nicholson, 2014; Baldwin and 
Fornalé, 2017; Bettini, 2017; Constable, 2017; Islam and Shamsuddoha, 
2017; Suckall et al., 2017). The studies on migration that have 
most closely explored the probable impacts of 1.5°C and 2°C have 
mainly focused on the direct effects of temperature and precipitation 
anomalies on migration or the indirect effects of these climatic changes 
through changing agriculture yield and livelihood sources (Mueller et 
al., 2014; Piguet and Laczko, 2014; Mastrorillo et al., 2016; Sudmeier-
Rieux et al., 2017).
Temperature has had a positive and statistically significant effect 
on outmigration over recent decades in 163 countries, but only for 
agriculture-dependent countries (R. Cai et al., 2016). A 1°C increase 
in average temperature in the International Migration Database of the 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 
was associated with a 1.9% increase in bilateral migration flows from 
142 sending countries and 19 receiving countries, and an additional 
millimetre of average annual precipitation was associated with an 
increase in migration by 0.5% (Backhaus et al., 2015). In another 
study, an increase in precipitation anomalies from the long-term mean, 
was strongly associated with an increase in outmigration, whereas no 
significant effects of temperature anomalies were reported (Coniglio 
and Pesce, 2015).
245

Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems 
Chapter 3
Internal and international migration have always been important for 
small islands (Farbotko and Lazrus, 2012; Weir et al., 2017). There is 
rarely a single cause for migration (Constable, 2017). Numerous factors 
are important, including work, education, quality of life, family ties, 
access to resources, and development (Bedarff and Jakobeit, 2017; 
Speelman et al., 2017; Nicholls et al., 2018). Depending on the situation, 
changing weather, climate or environmental conditions might each be 
a factor in the choice to migrate (Campbell and Warrick, 2014).
Displacement: At 2°C of warming, there is a potential for significant 
population displacement concentrated in the tropics (Hsiang and Sobel, 
2016). Tropical populations may have to move distances greater than 
1000 km if global mean temperature rises by 2°C from 2011–2030 to 
the end of the century. A disproportionately rapid evacuation from the 
tropics could lead to a concentration of population in tropical margins 
and the subtropics, where population densities could increase by 300% 
or more (Hsiang and Sobel, 2016).
Conflict: A recent study has called for caution in relating conflict 
to climate change, owing to sampling bias (Adams et al., 2018). 
Insufficient consideration of the multiple drivers of conflict often leads 
to inconsistent associations being reported between climate change 
and conflict (e.g., Hsiang et al., 2013; Hsiang and Burke, 2014; Buhaug, 
2015, 2016; Carleton and Hsiang, 2016; Carleton et al., 2016). There 
also are inconsistent relationships between climate change, migration 
and conflict (e.g., Theisen et al., 2013; Buhaug et al., 2014; Selby, 2014; 
Christiansen, 2016; Brzoska and Fröhlich, 2016; Burrows and Kinney, 
2016; Reyer et al., 2017c; Waha et al., 2017). Across world regions and 
from the international to micro level, the relationship between drought 
and conflict is weak under most circumstances (Buhaug, 2016; von 
Uexkull et al., 2016). However, drought significantly increases the 
likelihood of sustained conflict for particularly vulnerable nations or 
groups, owing to the dependence of their livelihood on agriculture. 
This is particularly relevant for groups in the least developed countries 
(von Uexkull et al., 2016), in sub-Saharan Africa (Serdeczny et al., 2016; 
Almer et al., 2017) and in the Middle East (Waha et al., 2017). Hsiang 
et al. (2013) reported causal evidence and convergence across studies 
that climate change is linked to human conflicts across all major 
regions of the world, and across a range of spatial and temporal scales. 
A 1°C increase in temperature or more extreme rainfall increases 
the frequency of intergroup conflicts by 14% (Hsiang et al., 2013). If 
the world warms by 2°C–4°C by 2050, rates of human conflict could 
increase. Some causal associations between violent conflict and 
socio-political instability were reported from local to global scales 
and from hour to millennium time frames (Hsiang and Burke, 2014). 
A temperature increase of one standard deviation increased the risk 
of interpersonal conflict by 2.4% and intergroup conflict by 11.3% 
(Burke et al., 2015a). Armed-conflict risks and climate-related disasters 
are both relatively common in ethnically fractionalized countries, 
indicating that there is no clear signal that environmental disasters 
directly trigger armed conflicts (Schleussner et al., 2016a).
In summary, average global temperatures that extend beyond 1.5°C are 
projected to increase poverty and disadvantage in many populations 
globally (medium confidence). By the mid- to late 21st century, climate 
change is projected to be a poverty multiplier that makes poor people 
poorer and increases poverty head count, and the association between 
temperature and economic productivity is not linear (high confidence). 
Temperature has a positive and statistically significant effect on 
outmigration for agriculture-dependent communities (medium 
confidence). 
3.4.11 Interacting and Cascading Risks
The literature on compound as well as interacting and cascading risks 
at warming of 1.5°C and 2°C is limited. Spatially compound risks, 
often referred to as hotspots, involve multiple hazards from different 
sectors overlapping in location (Piontek et al., 2014). Global exposures 
were assessed for 14 impact indicators, covering water, energy and 
land sectors, from changes including drought intensity and water 
stress index, cooling demand change and heatwave exposure, habitat 
degradation, and crop yields using an ensemble of climate and impact 
models (Byers et al., 2018). Exposures are projected to approximately 
double between 1.5°C and 2°C, and the land area affected by climate 
risks is expected to increase as warming progresses. For populations 
vulnerable to poverty, the exposure to climate risks in multiple sectors 
could be an order of magnitude greater (8–32 fold) in the high poverty 
and inequality scenarios (SSP3; 765–1,220 million) compared to under 
sustainable socio-economic development (SSP1; 23–85 million). Asian 
and African regions are projected to experience 85–95% of global 
exposure, with 91–98% of the exposed and vulnerable population 
(depending on SSP/GMT combination), approximately half of which 
are in South Asia. Figure 3.19 shows that moderate and large multi-
sector impacts are prevalent at 1.5°C where vulnerable people live, 
predominantly in South Asia (mostly Pakistan, India and China), but that 
impacts spread to sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and East Asia at 
higher levels of warming. Beyond 2°C and at higher risk thresholds, 
the world’s poorest populations are expected to be disproportionately 
impacted, particularly in cases (SSP3) of great inequality in Africa and 
southern Asia. Table 3.4 shows the number of exposed and vulnerable 
people at 1.5°C and 2°C of warming, with 3°C shown for context, for 
selected multi-sector risks.
3.4.12 Summary of Projected Risks at 1.5°C and 2°C 
of Global Warming 
The information presented in Section 3.4 is summarized below in Table 
3.5, which illustrates the growing evidence of increasing risks across a 
broad range of natural and human systems at 1.5°C and 2°C of global 
warming.

Table 3.5  | Summary of projected risks to natural and human systems at 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming, and of the potential to adapt to these risks. Table summarizes the chapter text and with references supporting table entries 
 
found in the main chapter text.  Risk magnitude is provided either as assessed levels of risk (very high: vh, high: h, medium: m, or low: l) or as quantitative examples of risk levels taken from the literature. Further compilations  
 
of quantified levels of risk taken from the literature may be found Tables 3.SM1-5 in the Supplementary Material. Similarly, potential to adapt is assessed from the literature by expert judgement as either high (h), medium  
 
(m), or low (l).  Confidence in each assessed level/quantification of risk, or in each assessed adaptation potential, is indicated as very high (VH), high (H), medium (M), or low (L).  Note that the use of l, m, h and vh here is  
 
distinct from the use of L, M, H and VH in Figures 3.18, 3.20 and 3.21.

Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems 
Chapter 3
3.4.13 
Synthesis of Key Elements of Risk
Some elements of the assessment in Section 3.4 were synthesized into 
Figure 3.18 and 3.20, indicating the overall risk for a representative set 
of natural and human systems from increases in global mean surface 
temperature (GMST) and anthropogenic climate change. The elements 
included are supported by a substantive enough body of literature 
providing at least medium confidence in the assessment. The format for 
Figures 3.18 and 3.20 match that of Figure 19.4 of WGII AR5 Chapter 
19 (Oppenheimer et al., 2014) indicating the levels of additional risk 
as colours: undetectable (white) to moderate (detected and attributed; 
yellow), from moderate to high (severe and widespread; red), and 
from high to very high (purple), the last of which indicates significant 
irreversibility or persistence of climate-related hazards combined 
with a much reduced capacity to adapt. Regarding the transition 
from undetectable to moderate, the impact literature assessed in AR5 
focused on describing and quantifying linkages between weather and 
climate patterns and impact outcomes, with limited detection and 
attribution to anthropogenic climate change (Cramer et al., 2014). A 
more recent analysis of attribution to greenhouse gas forcing at the 
global scale (Hansen and Stone, 2016) confirmed that the impacts 
related to changes in regional atmospheric and ocean temperature can 
be confidently attributed to anthropogenic forcing, while attribution 
to anthropogenic forcing of those impacts related to precipitation is 
only weakly evident or absent. Moreover, there is no strong direct 
relationship between the robustness of climate attribution and that of 
impact attribution (Hansen and Stone, 2016).
The current synthesis is complementary to the synthesis in Section 3.5.2 
that categorizes risks into ‘Reasons for Concern’ (RFCs), as described in 
Oppenheimer et al. (2014). Each element, or burning ember, presented 
here (Figures 3.18, 3.20) maps to one or more RFCs (Figure 3.21). It 
should be emphasized that risks to the elements assessed here are 
only a subset of the full range of risks that contribute to the RFCs. 
Figures 3.18 and 3.20 are not intended to replace the RFCs but rather 
to indicate how risks to particular elements of the Earth system accrue 
with global warming, through the visual burning embers format, 
with a focus on levels of warming of 1.5°C and 2°C. Key evidence 
assessed in earlier parts of this chapter is summarized to indicate the 
transition points between the levels of risk. In this regard, the assessed 
confidence in assigning the transitions between risk levels are as 
follows: L=Low, M=Medium, H=High, and VH=Very high levels of 
confidence. A detailed account of the procedures involved is provided 
in the Supplementary Material (3.SM.3.2 and 3.SM.3.3).
In terrestrial ecosystems (feeding into RFC1 and RFC4), detection and 
attribution studies show that impacts of climate change on terrestrial 
ecosystems began to take place over the past few decades, indicating 
a transition from no risk (white areas in Figure 3.20) to moderate risk 
below recent temperatures (high confidence) (Section 3.4.3). Risks to 
unique and threatened terrestrial ecosystems are generally projected to 
be higher under warming of 2°C compared to 1.5°C (Section 3.5.2.1), 
while at the global scale severe and widespread risks are projected 
to occur by 2°C of warming. These risks are associated with biome 
shifts and species range losses (Sections 3.4.3 and 3.5.2.4); however, 
because many systems and species are projected to be unable to adapt 
to levels of warming below 2°C, the transition to high risk (red areas 
in Figure 3.20) is located below 2°C (high confidence). With 3°C of 
warming, however, biome shifts and species range losses are expected 
to escalate to very high levels, and the systems are projected to have 
very little capacity to adapt (Figure 3.20) (high confidence) (Section 
3.4.3). 
In the Arctic (related to RFC1), the increased rate of summer sea ice 
melt was detected and attributed to climate change by the year 2000 
(corresponding to warming of 0.7°C), indicating moderate risk. At 
1.5°C of warming an ice-free Arctic Ocean is considered unlikely, whilst 
by 2°C of warming it is considered likely and this unique ecosystem is 
projected to be unable to adapt. Hence, a transition from high to very 
high risk is expected between 1.5°C and 2°C of warming. 
For warm-water coral reefs, there is high confidence in the transitions 
between risk levels, especially in the growing impacts in the 
transition of warming from non-detectable (0.2°C to 0.4°C), and then 
successively higher levels risk until high and very high levels of risks 
by 1.2°C (Section 3.4.4 and Box 3.4). This assessment considered the 
heatwave-related loss of 50% of shallow water corals across hundreds 
of kilometres of the world’s largest continuous coral reef system, 
the Great Barrier Reef, as well as losses at other sites globally. The 
major increase in the size and loss of coral reefs over the past three 
years, plus sequential mass coral bleaching and mortality events on 
the Great Barrier Reef, (Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999; Hughes et al., 2017b, 
2018), have reinforced the scale of climate-change related risks to 
coral reefs. General assessments of climate-related risks for mangroves 
prior to this special report concluded that they face greater risks from 
deforestation and unsustainable coastal development than from 
climate change (Alongi, 2008; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014; Gattuso et 
al., 2015). Recent climate-related die-offs (Duke et al., 2017; Lovelock 
et al., 2017), however, suggest that climate change risks may have 
been underestimated for mangroves as well, and risks have thus been 
assessed as undetectable to moderate, with the transition now starting 
at 1.3°C as opposed to 1.8°C as assessed in 2015 (Gattuso et al., 2015). 
Risks of impacts related to climate change on small-scale fisheries at 
low latitudes, many of which are dependent on ecosystems such as 
coral reefs and mangroves, are moderate today but are expected to 
reach high levels of risk around 0.9°C–1.1°C (high confidence) (Section 
3.4.4.10).
The transition from undetectable to moderate risk (related to RFCs 3 
and 4), shown as white to yellow in Figure 3.20, is based on AR5 WGII 
Chapter 7, which indicated with high confidence that climate change 
impacts on crop yields have been detected and attributed to climate 
change, and the current assessment has provided further evidence 
to confirm this (Section 3.4.6). Impacts have been detected in the 
tropics (AR5 WGII Chapters 7 and 18), and regional risks are projected 
to become high in some regions by 1.5°C of warming, and in many 
regions by 2.5°C, indicating a transition from moderate to high risk 
between 1.5°C and 2.5°C of warming (medium confidence).
Impacts from fluvial flooding (related to RFCs 2, 3 and 4) depend on 
the frequency and intensity of the events, as well as the extent of 
exposure and vulnerability of society (i.e., socio-economic conditions 
and the effect of non-climate stressors). Moderate risks posed by 
1.5°C of warming are expected to continue to increase with higher 
252

levels of warming (Sections 3.3.5 and 3.4.2), with projected risks being 
threefold the current risk in economic damages due to flooding in 19 
countries for warming of 2°C, indicating a transition to high risk at 
this level (medium confidence). Because few studies have assessed the 
potential to adapt to these risks, there was insufficient evidence to 
locate a transition to very high risk (purple).
Climate-change induced sea level rise (SLR) and associated coastal 
flooding (related to RFCs 2, 3 and 4) have been detectable and 
attributable since approximately 1970 (Slangen et al., 2016), during 
which time temperatures have risen by 0.3°C (medium confidence) 
(Section 3.3.9). Analysis suggests that impacts could be more 
widespread in sensitive systems such as small islands (high confidence) 
(Section 3.4.5.3) and increasingly widespread by the 2070s (Brown 
et al., 2018a) as temperatures rise from 1.5°C to 2°C, even when 
adaptation measures are considered, suggesting a transition to high 
risk (Section 3.4.5). With 2.5°C of warming, adaptation limits are 
expected to be exceeded in sensitive areas, and hence a transition to 
very high risk is projected. Additionally, at this temperature, sea level 
rise could have adverse effects for centuries, posing significant risk to 
low-lying areas (high confidence) (Sections 3.4.5.7 and 3.5.2.5).
For heat-related morbidity and mortality (related to RFCs 2, 3 and 4), 
detection and attribution studies show heat-related mortality in some 
locations increasing with climate change (high confidence) (Section 
3.4.7; Ebi et al., 2017). The projected risks of heat-related morbidity and 
mortality are generally higher under warming of 2°C than 1.5°C (high 
confidence), with projections of greater exposure to high ambient 
temperatures and increased morbidity and mortality (Section 3.4.7). 
Risk levels will depend on the rate of warming and the (related) level of 
adaptation, so a transition in risk from moderate (yellow) to high (red) 
is located between 1°C and 3°C (medium confidence).

Figure 3.20 |  The dependence of risks and/or impacts associated with selected elements of human and natural systems on the level of climate change, adapted from Figure 
3.21 and from AR5 WGII Chapter 19, Figure 19.4, and highlighting the nature of this dependence between 0°C and 2°C warming above pre-industrial levels. The selection of 
impacts and risks to natural, managed and human systems is illustrative and is not intended to be fully comprehensive. Following the approach used in AR5, literature was used 
to make expert judgements to assess the levels of global warming at which levels of impact and/or risk are undetectable (white), moderate (yellow), high (red) or very high 
(purple). The colour scheme thus indicates the additional risks due to climate change. The transition from red to purple, introduced for the first time in AR4, is defined by a very 
high risk of severe impacts and the presence of significant irreversibility or persistence of climate-related hazards combined with limited ability to adapt due to the nature of the 
hazard or impact. Comparison of the increase of risk across RFCs indicates the relative sensitivity of RFCs to increases in GMST. As was done previously, this assessment takes 
autonomous adaptation into account, as well as limits to adaptation independently of development pathway. The levels of risk illustrated reflect the judgements of the authors 
of Chapter 3 and Gattuso et al. (2015; for three marine elements). The grey bar represents the range of GMST for the most recent decade: 2006–2015.

Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems 
Chapter 3
For tourism (related to RFCs 3 and 4), changing weather patterns, 
extreme weather and climate events, and sea level rise are affecting 
many – but not all – global tourism investments, as well as 
environmental and cultural destination assets (Section 3.4.4.12), with 
‘last chance to see’ tourism markets developing based on observed 
impacts on environmental and cultural heritage (Section 3.4.9.1), 
indicating a transition from undetectable to moderate risk between 
0°C and 1.5°C of warming (high confidence). Based on limited 
analyses, risks to the tourism sector are projected to be larger at 2°C 
than at 1.5°C, with impacts on climate-sensitive sun, beach and snow 
sports tourism markets being greatest. The degradation or loss of 
coral reef systems is expected to increase the risks to coastal tourism 
in subtropical and tropical regions. A transition in risk from moderate 
to high levels of added risk from climate change is projcted to occur 
between 1.5°C and 3°C (medium confidence). 
Climate change is already having large scale impacts on ecosystems, 
human health and agriculture, which is making it much more difficult 
to reach goals to eradicate poverty and hunger, and to protect health 
and life on land (Sections 5.1 and 5.2.1 in Chapter 5), suggesting a 
transition from undetectable to moderate risk for recent temperatures 
at 0.5°C of warming (medium confidence). Based on the limited 
analyses available, there is evidence and agreement that the risks 
to sustainable development are considerably less at 1.5°C than 2°C 
(Section 5.2.2), including impacts on poverty and food security. It is 
easier to achieve many of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) at 
1.5°C, suggesting that a transition to higher risk will not begin yet at 
this level. At 2°C and higher levels of warming (e.g., RCP8.5), however, 
there are high risks of failure to meet SDGs such as eradicating 
poverty and hunger, providing safe water, reducing inequality and 
protecting ecosystems, and these risks are projected to become severe 
and widespread if warming increases further to about 3°C (medium 
confidence) (Section 5.2.3).

Avoided Impacts and Reduced Risks 
at 1.5°C Compared with 2°C 
of Global Warming 
3.5.1 
Introduction 
Oppenheimer et al. (2014, AR5 WGII Chapter 19) provided a framework 
that aggregates projected risks from global mean temperature 
change into five categories identified as ‘Reasons for Concern’. Risks 
are classified as moderate, high or very high and coloured yellow, 
red or purple, respectively, in Figure 19.4 of that chapter (AR5 WGII 
Chapter 19 for details and findings). The framework’s conceptual 
basis and the risk judgements made by Oppenheimer et al. (2014) 
were recently reviewed, and most judgements were confirmed in the 
light of more recent literature (O’Neill et al., 2017). The approach 
of Oppenheimer et al. (2014) was adopted, with updates to the 
aggregation of risk informed by the most recent literature, for the 
analysis of avoided impacts at 1.5°C compared to 2°C of global 
warming presented in this section. 
The regional economic benefits that could be obtained by limiting the 
global temperature increase to 1.5°C of warming, rather than 2°C 
or higher levels, are discussed in Section 3.5.3 in the light of the five 
RFCs explored in Section 3.5.2. Climate change hotspots that could 
be avoided or reduced by achieving the 1.5°C target are summarized 
in Section 3.5.4. The section concludes with a discussion of regional 
tipping points that could be avoided at 1.5°C compared to higher 
degrees of global warming (Section 3.5.5). 
3.5.2 
Aggregated Avoided Impacts and Reduced 
Risks at 1.5°C versus 2°C of Global Warming
A brief summary of the accrual of RFCs with global warming, as 
assessed in WGII AR5, is provided in the following sections, which 
leads into an update of relevant literature published since AR5. The 
new literature is used to confirm the levels of global warming at which 
risks are considered to increase from undetectable to moderate, from 
moderate to high, and from high to very high. Figure 3.21 modifies 
Figure 19.4 from AR5 WGII, and the following text in this subsection 
provides justification for the modifications. O’Neill et al. (2017) 
presented a very similar assessment to that of WGII AR5, but with 
further discussion of the potential to create ‘embers’ specific to socio-
economic scenarios in the future. There is insufficient literature to 
do this at present, so the original, simple approach has been used 
here. As the focus of the present assessment is on the consequences 
of global warming of 1.5°C–2°C above the pre-industrial period, no 
assessment for global warming of 3°C or more is included in the 
figure (i.e., analysis is discontinued at 2.5°C).
3.5.2.1 RFC 1 – Unique and threatened systems
WGII AR5 Chapter 19 found that some unique and threatened 
systems are at risk from climate change at current temperatures, 
with increasing numbers of systems at potential risk of severe 
consequences at global warming of 1.6°C above pre-industrial levels. 
It was also observed that many species and ecosystems have a limited 
ability to adapt to the very large risks associated with warming of 
2.6°C or more, particularly Arctic sea ice and coral reef systems (high 
confidence). In the AR5 analysis, a transition from white to yellow 
indicated that the onset of moderate risk was located below present-
day global temperatures (medium confidence); a transition from 
yellow to red indicated that the onset of high risk was located at 
1.6°C, and a transition from red to purple indicated that the onset 
of very high risk was located at about 2.6°C. This WGII AR5 analysis 
already implied that there would be a significant reduction in risks 
to unique and threatened systems if warming were limited to 1.5°C 
compared with 2°C. Since AR5, evidence of present-day impacts in 
these systems has continued to grow (Sections 3.4.2, 3.4.4 and 3.4. 
5), whilst new evidence has also accumulated for reduced risks at 
1.5°C compared to 2°C of warming in Arctic ecosystems (Section 
3.3.9), coral reefs (Section 3.4.4) and some other unique ecosystems 
(Section 3.4.3), as well as for biodiversity.

Chapter 3 
Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems

New literature since AR5 has provided a closer focus on the comparative 
levels of risk to coral reefs at 1.5°C versus 2°C of global warming. As 
assessed in Section 3.4.4 and Box 3.4, reaching 2°C will increase the 
frequency of mass coral bleaching and mortality to a point at which it 
will result in the total loss of coral reefs from the world’s tropical and 
subtropical regions. Restricting overall warming to 1.5°C will still see 
a downward trend in average coral cover (70–90% decline by mid-
century) but will prevent the total loss of coral reefs projected with 
warming of 2°C (Frieler et al., 2013). The remaining reefs at 1.5°C will 
also benefit from increasingly stable ocean conditions by the mid-to-
late 21st century. Limiting global warming to 1.5°C during the course 
of the century may, therefore, open the window for many ecosystems 
to adapt or reassort geographically. This indicates a transition in risk 
in this system from high to very high (high confidence) at 1.5°C of 
warming and contributes to a lowering of the transition from high to 
very high (Figure 3.21) in this RFC1 compared to in AR5. Further details 
of risk transitions for ocean systems are described in Figure 3.18.
Substantial losses of Arctic Ocean summer ice were projected in 
WGI AR5 for global warming of 1.6°C, with a nearly ice-free Arctic 
Ocean being projected for global warming of more than 2.6°C. 
Since AR5, the importance of a threshold between 1°C and 2°C has 
been further emphasized in the literature, with sea ice projected to 
persist throughout the year for a global warming of less than 1.5°C, 
yet chances of an ice-free Arctic during summer being high at 2°C of 
warming (Section 3.3.8). Less of the permafrost in the Arctic is projected 
to thaw under 1.5°C of warming (17–44%) compared with under 2°C 
(28–53%) (Section 3.3.5.2; Chadburn et al., 2017), which is expected 
to reduce risks to both social and ecological systems in the Arctic. This 
indicates a transition in the risk in this system from high to very high 
between 1.5°C and 2°C of warming and contributes to a lowering of 
the transition from high to very high in this RFC1 compared to in AR5.
AR5 identified a large number of threatened systems, including mountain 
ecosystems, highly biodiverse tropical wet and dry forests, deserts, 
freshwater systems and dune systems. These include Mediterranean 
areas in Europe, Siberian, tropical and desert ecosystems in Asia, 
Australian rainforests, the Fynbos and succulent Karoo areas of South 
Africa, and wetlands in Ethiopia, Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe. In all 
these systems, impacts accrue with greater warming and impacts at 2°C 
are expected to be greater than those at 1.5°C (medium confidence). 
One study since AR5 has shown that constraining global warming to 
1.5°C would maintain the functioning of prairie pothole ecosystems 
in North America in terms of their productivity and biodiversity, whilst 
warming of 2°C would not do so (Johnson et al., 2016). The large 
proportion of insects projected to lose over half their range at 2°C of 
warming (25%) compared to at 1.5°C (9%) also suggests a significant 
loss of functionality in these threatened systems at 2°C of warming, 
Figure 3.21 | The dependence of risks and/or impacts associated with the Reasons for Concern (RFCs) on the level of climate change, updated and adapted from WGII AR5 
Ch 19, Figure 19.4 and highlighting the nature of this dependence between 0°C and 2°C warming above pre-industrial levels. As in the AR5, literature was used to make 
expert judgements to assess the levels of global warming at which levels of impact and/or risk are undetectable (white), moderate (yellow), high (red) or very high (purple). 
The colour scheme thus indicates the additional risks due to climate change. The transition from red to purple, introduced for the first time in AR4, is defined by very high risk 
of severe impacts and the presence of significant irreversibility, or persistence of climate-related hazards combined with a limited ability to adapt due to the nature of the 
hazard or impact. Comparison of the increase of risk across RFCs indicates the relative sensitivity of RFCs to increases in GMST. As was done previously, this assessment takes 
autonomous adaptation into account, as well as limits to adaptation (RFC 1, 3, 5) independently of development pathway. The rate and timing of impacts were taken into 
account in assessing RFC 1 and 5. The levels of risk illustrated reflect the judgements of the Ch 3 authors. RFC1 Unique and threatened systems: ecological and human 
systems that have restricted geographic ranges constrained by climate related conditions and have high endemism or other distinctive properties. Examples include coral reefs, 
the Arctic and its indigenous people, mountain glaciers and biodiversity hotspots. RFC2 Extreme weather events: risks/impacts to human health, livelihoods, assets and 
ecosystems from extreme weather events such as heatwaves, heavy rain, drought and associated wildfires, and coastal flooding. RFC3 Distribution of impacts: risks/impacts 
that disproportionately affect particular groups due to uneven distribution of physical climate change hazards, exposure or vulnerability. RFC4 Global aggregate impacts: 
global monetary damage, global scale degradation and loss of ecosystems and biodiversity. RFC5 Large-scale singular events: are relatively large, abrupt and sometimes 
irreversible changes in systems that are caused by global warming. Examples include disintegration of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. The grey bar represents the range 
of GMST for the most recent decade: 2006–2015.

Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems 
Chapter 3
owing to the critical role of insects in nutrient cycling, pollination, 
detritivory and other important ecosystem processes (Section 3.4.3).
Unique and threatened systems in small island states and in systems 
fed by glacier meltwater were also considered to contribute to this 
RFC in AR5, but there is little new information about these systems 
that pertains to 1.5°C or 2°C of global warming. Taken together, the 
evidence suggests that the transition from high to very high risk in 
unique and threatened systems occurs at a lower level of warming, 
between 1.5°C and 2°C (high confidence), than in AR5, where this 
transition was located at 2.6°C. The transition from moderate to high 
risk relocates very slightly from 1.6°C to 1.5°C (high confidence). There 
is also high confidence in the location of the transition from low to 
moderate risk below present-day global temperatures. 
3.5.2.2 RFC 2 – Extreme weather events
Reduced risks in terms of the likelihood of occurrence of extreme 
weather events are discussed in this sub-subsection for 1.5°C as 
compared to 2°C of global warming, for those extreme events where 
evidence is currently available based on the assessments of Section 3.3. 
AR5 assigned a moderate level of risk from extreme weather events at 
recent temperatures (1986–2005) owing to the attribution of heat and 
precipitation extremes to climate change, and a transition to high risk 
beginning below 1.6°C of global warming based on the magnitude, 
likelihood and timing of projected changes in risk associated with 
extreme events, indicating more severe and widespread impacts. 
The AR5 analysis already suggested a significant benefit of limiting 
warming to 1.5°C, as doing so might keep risks closer to the moderate 
level. New literature since AR5 has provided greater confidence in a 
reduced level of risks due to extreme weather events at 1.5°C versus 
2°C of warming for some types of extremes (Section 3.3 and below; 
Figure 3.21). 
Temperature: It is expected that further increases in the number of 
warm days/nights and decreases in the number of cold days/nights, 
and an increase in the overall temperature of hot and cold extremes 
would occur under 1.5°C of global warming relative to pre-industrial 
levels (high confidence) compared to under the present-day climate 
(1°C of warming), with further changes occurring towards 2°C of 
global warming (Section 3.3). As assessed in Sections 3.3.1 and 3.3.2, 
impacts of 0.5°C of global warming can be identified for temperature 
extremes at global scales, based on observations and the analysis of 
climate models. At 2°C of global warming, it is likely that temperature 
increases of more than 2°C would occur over most land regions in 
terms of extreme temperatures (up to 4°C–6°C depending on region 
and considered extreme index) (Section 3.3.2, Table 3.2). Regional 
increases in temperature extremes can be robustly limited if global 
warming is constrained to 1.5°C, with regional warmings of up to 
3°C–4.5°C (Section 3.3.2, Table 3.2). Benefits obtained from this 
general reduction in extremes depend to a large extent on whether the 
lower range of increases in extremes at 1.5°C is sufficient for critical 
thresholds to be exceeded, within the context of wide-ranging aspects 
such as crop yields, human health and the sustainability of ecosystems.
Heavy precipitation: AR5 assessed trends in heavy precipitation 
for land regions where observational coverage was sufficient for 
assessment. It concluded with medium confidence that anthropogenic 
forcing has contributed to a global-scale intensification of heavy 
precipitation over the second half of the 20th century, for a global 
warming of approximately 0.5°C (Section 3.3.3). A recent observation-
based study likewise showed that a 0.5°C increase in global mean 
temperature has had a detectable effect on changes in precipitation 
extremes at the global scale (Schleussner et al., 2017), thus suggesting 
that there would be detectable differences in heavy precipitation at 
1.5°C and 2°C of global warming. These results are consistent with 
analyses of climate projections, although they also highlight a large 
amount of regional variation in the sensitivity of changes in heavy 
precipitation (Section 3.3.3). 
Droughts: When considering the difference between precipitation and 
evaporation (P–E) as a function of global temperature changes, the 
subtropics generally display an overall trend towards drying, whilst the 
northern high latitudes display a robust response towards increased 
wetting (Section 3.3.4, Figure 3.12). Limiting global mean temperature 
increase to 1.5°C as opposed to 2°C could substantially reduce the risk 
of reduced regional water availability in some regions (Section 3.3.4). 
Regions that are projected to benefit most robustly from restricted 
warming include the Mediterranean and southern Africa (Section 
3.3.4).
Fire: Increasing evidence that anthropogenic climate change has 
already caused significant increases in fire area globally (Section 
3.4.3) is in line with projected fire risks. These risks are projected to 
increase further under 1.5°C of global warming relative to the present 
day (Section 3.4.3). Under 1.2°C of global warming, fire frequency 
has been estimated to increase by over 37.8% of global land areas, 
compared to 61.9% of global land areas under 3.5°C of warming. For 
in-depth discussion and uncertainty estimates, see Meehl et al. (2007), 
Moritz et al. (2012) and Romero-Lankao et al. (2014). 
Regarding extreme weather events (RFC2), the transition from 
moderate to high risk is located between 1°C and 1.5°C of global 
warming (Figure 3.21), which is very similar to the AR5 assessment but 
is assessed with greater confidence (medium confidence). The impact 
literature contains little information about the potential for human 
society to adapt to extreme weather events, and hence it has not been 
possible to locate the transition from high to very high risk within the 
context of assessing impacts at 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming. 
There is thus low confidence in the level at which global warming could 
lead to very high risks associated with extreme weather events in the 
context of this report. 
3.5.2.3 RFC 3 – Distribution of impacts
Risks due to climatic change are unevenly distributed and are 
generally greater at lower latitudes and for disadvantaged people and 
communities in countries at all levels of development. AR5 located 
the transition from undetectable to moderate risk below recent 
temperatures, owing to the detection and attribution of regionally 
differentiated changes in crop yields (medium to high confidence; 
Figure 3.20), and new literature has continued to confirm this finding. 
Based on the assessment of risks to regional crop production and 
water resources, AR5 located the transition from moderate to high risk 
256
Chapter 3 
Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems
3
between 1.6°C and 2.6°C above pre-industrial levels. Cross-Chapter 
Box 6 in this chapter highlights that at 2°C of warming, new literature 
shows that risks of food shortage are projected to emerge in the African 
Sahel, the Mediterranean, central Europe, the Amazon, and western and 
southern Africa, and that these are much larger than the corresponding 
risks at 1.5°C. This suggests a transition from moderate to high risk of 
regionally differentiated impacts between 1.5°C and 2°C above pre-
industrial levels for food security (medium confidence) (Figure 3.20). 
Reduction in the availability of water resources at 2°C is projected to 
be greater than 1.5°C of global warming, although changes in socio-
economics could have a greater influence (Section 3.4.2), with larger 
risks in the Mediterranean (Box 3.2); estimates of the magnitude of the 
risks remain similar to those cited in AR5. Globally, millions of people 
may be at risk from sea level rise (SLR) during the 21st century (Hinkel 
et al., 2014; Hauer et al., 2016), particularly if adaptation is limited. At 
2°C of warming, more than 90% of global coastlines are projected to 
experience SLR greater than 0.2 m, suggesting regional differences in 
the risks of coastal flooding. Regionally differentiated multi-sector risks 
are already apparent at 1.5°C of warming, being more prevalent where 
vulnerable people live, predominantly in South Asia (mostly Pakistan, 
India and China), but these risks are projected to spread to sub-Saharan 
Africa, the Middle East and East Asia as temperature rises, with the 
world’s poorest people disproportionately impacted at 2°C of warming 
(Byers et al., 2018). The hydrological impacts of climate change in 
Europe are projected to increase in spatial extent and intensity across 
increasing global warming levels of 1.5°C, 2°C and 3°C (Donnelly et 
al., 2017). Taken together, a transition from moderate to high risk is 
now located between 1.5°C and 2°C above pre-industrial levels, based 
on the assessment of risks to food security, water resources, drought, 
heat exposure and coastal submergence (high confidence; Figure 3.21).
3.5.2.4 RFC 4 – Global aggregate impacts
Oppenheimer et al. (2014) explained the inclusion of non-economic 
metrics related to impacts on ecosystems and species at the global 
level, in addition to economic metrics in global aggregate impacts. 
The degradation of ecosystem services by climate change and ocean 
acidification have generally been excluded from previous global 
aggregate economic analyses. 
Global economic impacts: WGII AR5 found that overall global 
aggregate impacts become moderate at 1°C–2°C of warming, and the 
transition to moderate risk levels was therefore located at 1.6°C above 
pre-industrial levels. This was based on the assessment of literature 
using model simulations which indicated that the global aggregate 
economic impact will become significantly negative between 1°C and 
2°C of warming (medium confidence), whilst there will be a further 
increase in the magnitude and likelihood of aggregate economic risks 
at 3°C of warming (low confidence).
Since AR5, three studies have emerged using two entirely different 
approaches which indicate that economic damages are projected to 
be higher by 2100 if warming reaches 2°C than if it is constrained 
to 1.5°C. The study by Warren et al. (2018c) used the integrated 
assessment model PAGE09 to estimate that avoided global economic 
damages of 22% (10–26%) accrue from constraining warming to 
1.5°C rather than 2°C, 90% (77–93%) from 1.5°C rather than 3.66°C, 
and 87% (74–91%) from 2°C rather than 3.66°C. In the second 
study, Pretis et al. (2018) identified several regions where economic 
damages are projected to be greater at 2°C compared to 1.5°C of 
warming, further estimating that projected damages at 1.5°C remain 
similar to today’s levels of economic damage. The third study, by M. 
Burke et al. (2018) used an empirical, statistical approach and found 
that limiting warming to 1.5°C instead of 2°C would save 1.5–2.0% 
of the gross world product (GWP) by mid-century and 3.5% of the 
GWP by end-of-century (see Figure 2A in M. Burke et al., 2018). 
Based on a 3% discount rate, this corresponds to 8.1–11.6 trillion 
USD and 38.5 trillion USD in avoided damages by mid- and end-of-
century, respectively, agreeing closely with the estimate by Warren et 
al. (2018c) of 15 trillion USD. Under the no-policy baseline scenario, 
temperature rises by 3.66°C by 2100, resulting in a global gross 
domestic product (GDP) loss of 2.6% (5–95% percentile range 0.5–
8.2%), compared with 0.3% (0.1–0.5%) by 2100 under the 1.5°C 
scenario and 0.5% (0.1–1.0%) in the 2°C scenario. Limiting warming 
to 1.5°C rather than 2°C by 2060 has also been estimated to result 
in co-benefits of 0.5–0.6% of the world GDP, owing to reductions in 
air pollution (Shindell et al., 2018), which is similar to the avoided 
damages identified for the USA (Box 3.6). 
Two studies focusing only on the USA found that economic damages 
are projected to be higher by 2100 if warming reaches 2°C than if it 
is constrained to 1.5°C. Hsiang et al. (2017) found a mean difference 
of 0.35% GDP (range 0.2–0.65%), while Yohe (2017) identified a GDP 
loss of 1.2% per degree of warming, hence approximately 0.6% for half 
a degree. Further, the avoided risks compared to a no-policy baseline 
are greater in the 1.5°C case (4%, range 2–7%) compared to the 2°C 
case (3.5%, range 1.8–6.5%). These analyses suggest that the point 
at which global aggregates of economic impacts become negative is 
below 2°C (medium confidence), and that there is a possibility that it 
is below 1.5°C of warming.
Oppenheimer et al. (2014) noted that the global aggregated damages 
associated with large-scale singular events has not been explored, and 
reviews of integrated modelling exercises have indicated a potential 
underestimation of global aggregate damages due to the lack of 
consideration of the potential for these events in many studies. Since 
AR5, further analyses of the potential economic consequences of 
triggering these large-scale singular events have indicated a two to 
eight fold larger economic impact associated with warming of 3°C 
than estimated in most previous analyses, with the extent of increase 
depending on the number of events incorporated. Lemoine and Traeger 
(2016) included only three known singular events whereas Y. Cai et al. 
(2016) included five.
Biome shifts, species range loss, increased risks of species 
extinction and risks of loss of ecosystem functioning and 
services: 13% (range 8–20%) of Earth’s land area is projected to 
undergo biome shifts at 2°C of warming compared to approximately 
7% at 1.5°C (medium confidence) (Section 3.4.3; Warszawski et al., 
2013), implying a halving of biome transformations. Overall levels of 
species loss at 2°C of warming are similar to values found in previous 
studies for plants and vertebrates (Warren et al., 2013, 2018a), but 
insects have been found to be more sensitive to climate change, with 
18% (6–35%) projected to lose over half their range at 2°C of warming 
257
3
Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems 
Chapter 3
compared to 6% (1–18%) under 1.5°C of warming, corresponding 
to a difference of 66% (Section 3.4.3). The critical role of insects in 
ecosystem functioning therefore suggests that there will be impacts 
on global ecosystem functioning already at 2°C of warming, whilst 
species that lose large proportions of their range are considered to 
be at increased risk of extinction (Section 3.4.3.3). Since AR5, new 
literature has indicated that impacts on marine fish stocks and fisheries 
are lower under 1.5°C–2°C of global warming relative to pre-industrial 
levels compared to under higher warming scenarios (Section 3.4.6), 
especially in tropical and polar systems.
In AR5, the transition from undetectable to moderate impacts was 
considered to occur between 1.6°C and 2.6°C of global warming 
reflecting impacts on the economy and on biodiversity globally, whereas 
high risks were associated with 3.6°C of warming to reflect the high 
risks to biodiversity and accelerated effects on the global economy. 
New evidence suggests moderate impacts on the global aggregate 
economy and global biodiversity by 1.5°C of warming, suggesting a 
lowering of the temperature level for the transition to moderate risk 
to 1.5°C (Figure 3.21). Further, recent literature points to higher risks 
than previously assessed for the global aggregate economy and global 
biodiversity by 2°C of global warming, suggesting that the transition 
to a high risk level is located between 1.5°C and 2.5°C of warming 
(Figure 3.21), as opposed to at 3.6°C as previously assessed (medium 
confidence). 
3.5.2.5 RFC 5 – Large-scale singular events
Large-scale singular events are components of the global Earth system 
that are thought to hold the risk of reaching critical tipping points 
under climate change, and that can result in or be associated with 
major shifts in the climate system. These components include:
• the cryosphere: West Antarctic ice sheet, Greenland ice sheet
• the thermohaline circulation: slowdown of the Atlantic Meridional  
 
Overturning Circulation (AMOC)
• the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) as a global mode of  
 
climate variability
• role of the Southern Ocean in the global carbon cycle
AR5 assessed that the risks associated with these events become 
moderate between 0.6°C and 1.6°C above pre-industrial levels, based 
on early warning signs, and that risk was expected to become high 
between 1.6°C and 4.6°C based on the potential for commitment to 
large irreversible sea level rise from the melting of land-based ice sheets 
(low to medium confidence). The increase in risk between 1.6°C and 
2.6°C above pre-industrial levels was assessed to be disproportionately 
large. New findings since AR5 are described in detail below.
Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets and marine ice sheet 
instability (MISI): Various feedbacks between the Greenland ice 
sheet and the wider climate system, most notably those related to 
the dependence of ice melt on albedo and surface elevation, make 
irreversible loss of the ice sheet a possibility. Church et al. (2013) 
assessed this threshold to be at 2°C of warming or higher levels relative 
to pre-industrial temperature. Robinson et al. (2012) found a range for 
this threshold of 0.8°C–3.2°C (95% confidence). The threshold of global 
temperature increase that may initiate irreversible loss of the West 
Antarctic ice sheet and marine ice sheet instability (MISI) is estimated 
to lie be between 1.5°C and 2°C. The time scale for eventual loss of the 
ice sheets varies between millennia and tens of millennia and assumes 
constant surface temperature forcing during this period. If temperature 
were to decline subsequently the ice sheets might regrow, although 
the amount of cooling required is likely to be highly dependent on the 
duration and rate of the previous retreat. The magnitude of global sea 
level rise that could occur over the next two centuries under 1.5°C–2°C 
of global warming is estimated to be in the order of several tenths of a 
metre according to most studies (low confidence) (Schewe et al., 2011; 
Church et al., 2013; Levermann et al., 2014; Marzeion and Levermann, 
2014; Fürst et al., 2015; Golledge et al., 2015), although a smaller 
number of investigations (Joughin et al., 2014; Golledge et al., 2015; 
DeConto and Pollard, 2016) project increases of 1–2 m. This body of 
evidence suggests that the temperature range of 1.5°C–2°C may be 
regarded as representing moderate risk, in that it may trigger MISI in 
Antarctica or irreversible loss of the Greenland ice sheet and it may be 
associated with sea level rise by as much as 1–2 m over a period of 
two centuries. 
Thermohaline circulation (slowdown of AMOC): It is more likely 
than not that the AMOC has been weakening in recent decades, 
given the detection of cooling of surface waters in the North Atlantic 
and evidence that the Gulf Stream has slowed since the late 1950s 
(Rahmstorf et al., 2015b; Srokosz and Bryden, 2015; Caesar et al., 
2018). There is limited evidence linking the recent weakening of the 
AMOC to anthropogenic warming (Caesar et al., 2018). It is very likely 
that the AMOC will weaken over the 21st century. Best estimates and 
ranges for the reduction based on CMIP5 simulations are 11% (1–24%) 
in RCP2.6 and 34% (12–54%) in RCP8.5 (AR5). There is no evidence 
indicating significantly different amplitudes of AMOC weakening for 
1.5°C versus 2°C of global warming, or of a shutdown of the AMOC at 
these global temperature thresholds. Associated risks are classified as 
low to moderate. 
El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO): Extreme El Niño events are 
associated with significant warming of the usually cold eastern Pacific 
Ocean, and they occur about once every 20 years (Cai et al., 2015). Such 
events reorganize the distribution of regions of organized convection 
and affect weather patterns across the globe. Recent research indicates 
that the frequency of extreme El Niño events increases linearly with the 
global mean temperature, and that the number of such events might 
double (one event every ten years) under 1.5°C of global warming (G. 
Wang et al., 2017). This pattern is projected to persist for a century after 
stabilization at 1.5°C, thereby challenging the limits to adaptation, and 
thus indicates high risk even at the 1.5°C threshold. La Niña event 
(the opposite or balancing event to El Niño) frequency is projected to 
remain similar to that of the present day under 1.5°C–2°C of global 
warming.
Role of the Southern Ocean in the global carbon cycle: The critical 
role of the Southern Ocean as a net sink of carbon might decline under 
global warming, and assessing this effect under 1.5°C compared to 
2°C of global warming is a priority. Changes in ocean chemistry (e.g., 
oxygen content and ocean acidification), especially those associated 
with the deep sea, are associated concerns (Section 3.3.10).

Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems

For large-scale singular events (RFC5), moderate risk is now located 
at 1°C of warming and high risk is located at 2.5°C (Figure 3.21), as 
opposed to at 1.6°C (moderate risk) and around 4°C (high risk) in 
AR5, because of new observations and models of the West Antarctic 
ice sheet (medium confidence), which suggests that the ice sheet 
may be in the early stages of marine ice sheet instability (MISI). 
Very high risk is assessed as lying above 5°C because the growing 
literature on process-based projections of the West Antarctic ice sheet 
predominantly supports the AR5 assessment of an MISI contribution of 
several additional tenths of a metre by 2100.
3.5.3 
Regional Economic Benefit Analysis for the 1.5°C 
versus 2°C Global Goals
This section reviews recent literature that has estimated the economic 
benefits of constraining global warming to 1.5°C compared to 2°C. 
The focus here is on evidence pertaining to specific regions, rather 
than on global aggregated benefits (Section 3.5.2.4). At 2°C of global 
warming, lower economic growth is projected for many countries than 
at 1.5°C of global warming, with low-income countries projected to 
experience the greatest losses (low to medium confidence) (M. Burke 
et al., 2018; Pretis et al., 2018). A critical issue for developing countries 
in particular is that advantages in some sectors are projected to be 
offset by increasing mitigation costs (Rogelj et al., 2013; M. Burke et 
al., 2018), with food production being a key factor. That is, although 
restraining the global temperature increase to 2°C is projected to 
reduce crop losses under climate change relative to higher levels of 
warming, the associated mitigation costs may increase the risk of 
hunger in low-income countries (low confidence) (Hasegawa et al., 
2016). It is likely that the even more stringent mitigation measures 
required to restrict global warming to 1.5°C (Rogelj et al., 2013) will 
further increase these mitigation costs and impacts. International 
trade in food might be a key response measure for alleviating hunger 
in developing countries under 1.5°C and 2°C stabilization scenarios 
(IFPRI, 2018).
Although warming is projected to be the highest in the Northern 
Hemisphere under 1.5°C or 2°C of global warming, regions in 
the tropics and Southern Hemisphere subtropics are projected to 
experience the largest impacts on economic growth (low to medium 
confidence) (Gallup et al., 1999; M. Burke et al., 2018; Pretis et al., 
2018). Despite the uncertainties associated with climate change 
projections and econometrics (e.g., M. Burke et al., 2018), it is more 
likely than not that there will be large differences in economic 
growth under 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming for developing 
versus developed countries (M. Burke et al., 2018; Pretis et al., 
2018). Statistically significant reductions in gross domestic product 
(GDP) per capita growth are projected across much of the African 
continent, Southeast Asia, India, Brazil and Mexico (low to medium 
confidence). Countries in the western parts of tropical Africa are 
projected to benefit most from restricting global warming to 1.5°C, 
as opposed to 2°C, in terms of future economic growth (Pretis et al., 
2018). An important reason why developed countries in the tropics 
and subtropics are projected to benefit substantially from restricting 
global warming to 1.5°C is that present-day temperatures in these 
regions are above the threshold thought to be optimal for economic 
production (M. Burke et al., 2015b, 2018). 
The world’s largest economies are also projected to benefit from 
restricting warming to 1.5°C as opposed to 2°C (medium confidence), 
with the likelihood of such benefits being realized estimated at 
76%, 85% and 81% for the USA, China and Japan, respectively (M. 
Burke et al., 2018). Two studies focusing only on the USA found that 
economic damages are projected to be higher by 2100 if warming 
reaches 2°C than if it is constrained to 1.5°C. Yohe (2017) found a 
mean difference of 0.35% GDP (range 0.2–0.65%), while Hsiang 
et al. (2017) identified a GDP loss of 1.2% per degree of warming, 
hence approximately 0.6% for half a degree. Overall, no statistically 
significant changes in GDP are projected to occur over most of the 
developed world under 1.5°C of global warming in comparison to 
present-day conditions, but under 2°C of global warming impacts on 
GDP are projected to be generally negative (low confidence) (Pretis 
et al., 2018).
A caveat to the analyses of Pretis et al. (2018) and M. Burke et al. 
(2018) is that the effects of sea level rise were not included in the 
estimations of damages or future economic growth, implying a potential 
underestimation of the benefits of limiting warming to 1.5°C for the 
case where significant sea level rise is avoided at 1.5°C but not at 2°C.
3.5.4 
Reducing Hotspots of Change for 1.5°C and 2°C 
of Global Warming
This subsection integrates Sections 3.3 and 3.4 in terms of climate-
change-induced hotspots that occur through interactions across the 
physical climate system, ecosystems and socio-economic human 
systems, with a focus on the extent to which risks can be avoided or 
reduced by achieving the 1.5°C global warming goal (as opposed to 
the 2°C goal). Findings are summarized in Table 3.6.
3.5.4.1 Arctic sea ice
Ice-free Arctic Ocean summers are very likely at levels of global 
warming higher than 2°C (Notz and Stroeve, 2016; Rosenblum and 
Eisenman, 2016; Screen and Williamson, 2017; Niederdrenk and 
Notz, 2018). Some studies even indicate that the entire Arctic Ocean 
summer period will become ice free under 2°C of global warming, 
whilst others more conservatively estimate this probability to be in the 
order of 50% (Section 3.3.8; Sanderson et al., 2017). The probability 
of an ice-free Arctic in September at 1.5°C of global warming is low 
and substantially lower than for the case of 2°C of global warming 
(high confidence) (Section 3.3.8; Screen and Williamson, 2017; Jahn, 
2018; Niederdrenk and Notz, 2018). There is, however, a single 
study that questions the validity of the 1.5°C threshold in terms of 
maintaining summer Arctic Ocean sea ice (Niederdrenk and Notz, 
2018). In contrast to summer, little ice is projected to be lost during 
winter for either 1.5°C or 2°C of global warming (medium confidence) 
(Niederdrenk and Notz, 2018). The losses in sea ice at 1.5°C and 
2°C of warming will result in habitat losses for organisms such as 
seals, polar bears, whales and sea birds (e.g., Larsen et al., 2014). 
There is high agreement and robust evidence that photosynthetic 
species will change because of sea ice retreat and related changes 
in temperature and radiation (Section 3.4.4.7), and this is very likely 
to benefit fisheries productivity in the Northern Hemisphere spring 
bloom system (Section 3.4.4.7).

Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems 
Chapter 3
3.5.4.2 Arctic land regions
In some Arctic land regions, the warming of cold extremes and the 
increase in annual minimum temperature at 1.5°C are stronger than 
the global mean temperature increase by a factor of two to three, 
meaning 3°C–4.5°C of regional warming at 1.5°C of global warming 
(e.g., northern Europe in Supplementary Material 3.SM, Figure 3.SM.5 
see also Section 3.3.2.2 and Seneviratne et al., 2016). Moreover, over 
much of the Arctic, a further increase of 0.5°C in the global surface 
temperature, from 1.5°C to 2°C, may lead to further temperature 
increases of 2°C–2.5°C (Figure 3.3). As a consequence, biome (major 
ecosystem type) shifts are likely in the Arctic, with increases in fire 
frequency, degradation of permafrost, and tree cover likely to occur at 
1.5°C of warming and further amplification of these changes expected 
under 2°C of global warming (e.g., Gerten et al., 2013; Bring et al., 
2016). Rising temperatures, thawing permafrost and changing weather 
patterns are projected to increasingly impact people, infrastructure and 
industries in the Arctic (W.N. Meier et al., 2014) with these impacts 
larger at 2°C than at 1.5°C of warming (medium confidence). 
3.5.4.3 Alpine regions
Alpine regions are generally regarded as climate change hotspots 
given that rich biodiversity has evolved in their cold and harsh climate, 
but with many species consequently being vulnerable to increases in 
temperature. Under regional warming, alpine species have been found 
to migrate upwards on mountain slopes (Reasoner and Tinner, 2009), 
an adaptation response that is obviously limited by mountain height 
and habitability. Moreover, many of the world’s alpine regions are 
important from a water security perspective through associated glacier 
melt, snow melt and river flow (see Section 3.3.5.2 for a discussion of 
these aspects). Projected biome shifts are likely to be severe in alpine 
regions already at 1.5°C of warming and to increase further at 2°C 
(Gerten et al., 2013, Figure 1b; B. Chen et al., 2014).
3.5.4.4 Southeast Asia
Southeast Asia is a region highly vulnerable to increased flooding in 
the context of sea level rise (Arnell et al., 2016; Brown et al., 2016, 
2018a). Risks from increased flooding are projected to rise from 1.5°C 
to 2°C of warming (medium confidence), with substantial increases 
projected beyond 2°C (Arnell et al., 2016). Southeast Asia displays 
statistically significant differences in projected changes in heavy 
precipitation, runoff and high flows at 1.5°C versus 2°C of warming, 
with stronger increases occurring at 2°C (Section 3.3.3; Wartenburger 
et al., 2017; Döll et al., 2018; Seneviratne et al., 2018c); thus, this region 
is considered a hotspot in terms of increases in heavy precipitation 
between these two global temperature levels (medium confidence) 
(Schleussner et al., 2016b; Seneviratne et al., 2016). For Southeast Asia, 
2°C of warming by 2040 could lead to a decline by one-third in per 
capita crop production associated with general decreases in crop yields 
(Nelson et al., 2010). However, under 1.5°C of warming, significant 
risks for crop yield reduction in the region are avoided (Schleussner et 
al., 2016b). These changes pose significant risks for poor people in both 
rural regions and urban areas of Southeast Asia (Section 3.4.10.1), with 
these risks being larger at 2°C of global warming compared to 1.5°C 
(medium confidence).
3.5.4.5 Southern Europe and the Mediterranean
The Mediterranean is regarded as a climate change hotspot, both in 
terms of projected stronger warming of the regional land-based hot 
extremes compared to the mean global temperature increase (e.g., 
Seneviratne et al., 2016) and in terms of of robust increases in the 
probability of occurrence of extreme droughts at 2°C vs 1.5°C global 
warming (Section 3.3.4). Low river flows are projected to decrease in 
the Mediterranean under 1.5°C of global warming (Marx et al., 2018), 
with associated significant decreases in high flows and floods (Thober 
et al., 2018), largely in response to reduced precipitation. The median 
reduction in annual runoff is projected to almost double from about 
9% (likely range 4.5–15.5%) at 1.5°C to 17% (likely range 8–25%) 
at 2°C (Schleussner et al., 2016b). Similar results were found by Döll 
et al. (2018). Overall, there is high confidence that strong increases in 
dryness and decreases in water availability in the Mediterranean and 
southern Europe would occur from 1.5°C to 2°C of global warming. Sea 
level rise is expected to be lower for 1.5°C versus 2°C, lowering risks 
for coastal metropolitan agglomerations. The risks (assuming current 
adaptation) related to water deficit in the Mediterranean are high for 
global warming of 2°C but could be substantially reduced if global 
warming were limited to 1.5°C (Section 3.3.4; Guiot and Cramer, 2016; 
Schleussner et al., 2016b; Donnelly et al., 2017).
3.5.4.6 West Africa and the Sahel
West Africa and the Sahel are likely to experience increases in the 
number of hot nights and longer and more frequent heatwaves 
even if the global temperature increase is constrained to 1.5°C, with 
further increases expected at 2°C of global warming and beyond 
(e.g., Weber et al., 2018). Moreover, daily rainfall intensity and runoff 
is expected to increase (low confidence) towards 2°C and higher 
levels of global warming (Schleussner et al., 2016b; Weber et al., 
2018), with these changes also being relatively large compared to 
the projected changes at 1.5°C of warming. Moreover, increased risks 
are projected in terms of drought, particularly for the pre-monsoon 
season (Sylla et al., 2015), with both rural and urban populations 
affected, and more so at 2°C of global warming as opposed to 1.5°C 
(Liu et al., 2018). Based on a World Bank (2013) study for sub-Saharan 
Africa, a 1.5°C warming by 2030 might reduce the present maize 
cropping areas by 40%, rendering these areas no longer suitable 
for current cultivars. Substantial negative impacts are also projected 
for sorghum suitability in the western Sahel (Läderach et al., 2013; 
Sultan and Gaetani, 2016). An increase in warming to 2°C by 2040 
would result in further yield losses and damages to crops (i.e., maize, 
sorghum, wheat, millet, groundnut and cassava). Schleussner et al. 
(2016b) found consistently reduced impacts on crop yield for West 
Africa under 2°C compared to 1.5°C of global warming. There is 
medium confidence that vulnerabilities to water and food security in 
the African Sahel will be higher at 2°C compared to 1.5°C of global 
warming (Cheung et al., 2016a; Betts et al., 2018), and at 2°C these 
vulnerabilities are expected to be worse (high evidence) (Sultan and 
Gaetani, 2016; Lehner et al., 2017; Betts et al., 2018; Byers et al., 
2018; Rosenzweig et al., 2018). Under global warming of more than 
2°C, the western Sahel might experience the strongest drying and 
experience serious food security issues (Ahmed et al., 2015; Parkes 
et al., 2018).

3.5.4.7 Southern Africa
The southern African region is projected to be a climate change hotspot 
in terms of both hot extremes (Figures 3.5 and 3.6) and drying (Figure 
3.12). Indeed, temperatures have been rising in the subtropical regions 
of southern Africa at approximately twice the global rate over the last 
five decades (Engelbrecht et al., 2015). Associated elevated warming 
of the regional land-based hot extremes has occurred (Section 3.3; 
Seneviratne et al., 2016). Increases in the number of hot nights, as 
well as longer and more frequent heatwaves, are projected even if the 
global temperature increase is constrained to 1.5°C (high confidence), 
with further increases expected at 2°C of global warming and beyond 
(high confidence) (Weber et al., 2018).
Moreover, southern Africa is likely to generally become drier with 
reduced water availability under low mitigation (Niang et al., 2014; 
Engelbrecht et al., 2015; Karl et al., 2015; James et al., 2017), with 
this particular risk being prominent under 2°C of global warming and 
even under 1.5°C (Gerten et al., 2013). Risks are significantly reduced, 
however, under 1.5°C of global warming compared to under higher 
levels (Schleussner et al., 2016b). There are consistent and statistically 
significant increases in projected risks of increased meteorological 
drought in southern Africa at 2°C versus 1.5°C of warming (medium 
confidence). Despite the general rainfall reductions projected for 
southern Africa, daily rainfall intensities are expected to increase over 
much of the region (medium confidence), and increasingly so with 
higher levels of global warming. There is medium confidence that 
livestock in southern Africa will experience increased water stress 
under both 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming, with negative economic 
consequences (e.g., Boone et al., 2018). The region is also projected 
to experience reduced maize, sorghum and cocoa cropping area 
suitability, as well as yield losses under 1.5°C of warming, with further 
decreases occurring towards 2°C of warming (World Bank, 2013). 
Generally, there is high confidence that vulnerability to decreases in 
water and food availability is reduced at 1.5°C versus 2°C for southern 
Africa (Betts et al., 2018), whilst at 2°C these are expected to be higher 
(high confidence) (Lehner et al., 2017; Betts et al., 2018; Byers et al., 
2018; Rosenzweig et al., 2018).
3.5.4.8 Tropics
Worldwide, the largest increases in the number of hot days are 
projected to occur in the tropics (Figure 3.7). Moreover, the largest 
differences in the number of hot days for 1.5°C versus 2°C of global 
warming are projected to occur in the tropics (Mahlstein et al., 2011). 
In tropical Africa, increases in the number of hot nights, as well as 
longer and more frequent heatwaves, are projected under 1.5°C of 
global warming, with further increases expected under 2°C of global 
warming (Weber et al., 2018). Impact studies for major tropical cereals 
reveal that yields of maize and wheat begin to decline with 1°C to 2°C 
of local warming in the tropics. Schleussner et al. (2016b) project that 
constraining warming to 1.5°C rather than 2°C would avoid significant 
risks of tropical crop yield declines in West Africa, Southeast Asia, and 
Central and South America. There is limited evidence and thus low 
confidence that these changes may result in significant population 
displacement from the tropics to the subtropics (e.g., Hsiang and Sobel, 
2016). 
3.5.4.9 Small islands
It is widely recognized that small islands are very sensitive to climate 
change impacts such as sea level rise, oceanic warming, heavy 
precipitation, cyclones and coral bleaching (high confidence) (Nurse et 
al., 2014; Ourbak and Magnan, 2017). Even at 1.5°C of global warming, 
the compounding impacts of changes in rainfall, temperature, tropical 
cyclones and sea level are likely to be significant across multiple 
natural and human systems. There are potential benefits to small 
island developing states (SIDS) from avoided risks at 1.5°C versus 
2°C, especially when coupled with adaptation efforts. In terms of sea 
level rise, by 2150, roughly 60,000 fewer people living in SIDS will be 
exposed in a 1.5°C world than in a 2°C world (Rasmussen et al., 2018). 
Constraining global warming to 1.5°C may significantly reduce water 
stress (by about 25%) compared to the projected water stress at 2°C, 
for example in the Caribbean region (Karnauskas et al., 2018), and may 
enhance the ability of SIDS to adapt (Benjamin and Thomas, 2016). Up 
to 50% of the year is projected to be very warm in the Caribbean at 
1.5°C, with a further increase by up to 70 days at 2°C versus 1.5°C 
(Taylor et al., 2018). By limiting warming to 1.5°C instead of 2°C in 
2050, risks of coastal flooding (measured as the flood amplification 
factors for 100-year flood events) are reduced by 20–80% for SIDS 
(Rasmussen et al., 2018). A case study of Jamaica with lessons for 
other Caribbean SIDS demonstrated that the difference between 1.5°C 
and 2°C is likely to challenge livestock thermoregulation, resulting in 
persistent heat stress for livestock (Lallo et al., 2018).
3.5.4.10  Fynbos and shrub biomes
The Fynbos and succulent Karoo biomes of South Africa are 
threatened systems that were assessed in AR5. Similar shrublands 
exist in the semi-arid regions of other continents, with the Sonora-
Mojave creosotebush-white bursage desert scrub ecosystem in the 
USA being a prime example. Impacts accrue across these systems 
with greater warming, with impacts at 2°C likely to be greater than 
those at 1.5°C (medium confidence). Under 2°C of global warming, 
regional warming in drylands is projected to be 3.2°C–4°C, and under 
1.5°C of global warming, mean warming in drylands is projected to  
still be about 3°C. The Fynbos biome in southwestern South Africa 
is vulnerable to the increasing impact of fires under increasing 
temperatures and drier winters (high confidence). The Fynbos biome 
is projected to lose about 20%, 45% and 80% of its current suitable 
climate area relative to its present-day area under 1°C, 2°C and 
3°C of warming, respectively (Engelbrecht and Engelbrecht, 2016), 
demonstrating the value of climate change mitigation in protecting 
this rich centre of biodiversity.

3.5.5 
Avoiding Regional Tipping Points by Achieving 
More Ambitious Global Temperature Goals
Tipping points refer to critical thresholds in a system that, when exceeded, 
can lead to a significant change in the state of the system, often with an 
understanding that the change is irreversible. An understanding of the 
sensitivities of tipping points in the physical climate system, as well as in 
ecosystems and human systems, is essential for understanding the risks 
associated with different degrees of global warming. This subsection 
reviews tipping points across these three areas within the context 
of the different sensitivities to 1.5°C versus 2°C of global warming. 
Sensitivities to less ambitious global temperature goals are also briefly 
reviewed. Moreover, an analysis is provided of how integrated risks 
across physical, natural and human systems may accumulate to lead 
to the exceedance of thresholds for particular systems. The emphasis in 
this section is on the identification of regional tipping points and their 
sensitivity to 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming, whereas tipping points 
in the global climate system, referred to as large-scale singular events, 
were already discussed in Section 3.5.2. A summary of regional tipping 
points is provided in Table 3.7.
3.5.5.1 Arctic sea ice
Collins et al. (2013) discussed the loss of Arctic sea ice in the context 
of potential tipping points. Climate models have been used to assess 
whether a bifurcation exists that would lead to the irreversible loss 
of Arctic sea ice (Armour et al., 2011; Boucher et al., 2012; Ridley et 
al., 2012) and to test whether the summer sea ice extent can recover 
after it has been lost (Schröder and Connolley, 2007; Sedláček et al., 
2011; Tietsche et al., 2011). These studies did not find evidence of 
bifurcation or indicate that sea ice returns within a few years of its loss, 
leading Collins et al. (2013) to conclude that there is little evidence 
for a tipping point in the transition from perennial to seasonal ice 
cover. No evidence has been found for irreversibility or tipping points, 
suggesting that year-round sea ice will return given a suitable climate 
(medium confidence) (Schröder and Connolley, 2007; Sedláček et al., 
2011; Tietsche et al., 2011).
3.5.5.2 Tundra
Tree growth in tundra-dominated landscapes is strongly constrained by 
the number of days with mean air temperature above 0°C. A potential 
tipping point exists where the number of days below 0°C decreases 
to the extent that the tree fraction increases significantly. Tundra-
dominated landscapes have warmed more than the global average 
over the last century (Settele et al., 2014), with associated increases 
in fires and permafrost degradation (Bring et al., 2016; DeBeer et al., 
2016; Jiang et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2016). These processes facilitate 
conditions for woody species establishment in tundra areas, and for 
the eventual transition of the tundra to boreal forest. The number of 
investigations into how the tree fraction may respond in the Arctic to 
different degrees of global warming is limited, and studies generally 
indicate that substantial increases will likely occur gradually (e.g., 
Lenton et al., 2008). Abrupt changes are only plausible at levels of 
warming significantly higher than 2°C (low confidence) and would 
occur in conjunction with a collapse in permafrost (Drijfhout et al., 
2015).
3.5.5.3 Permafrost
Widespread thawing of permafrost potentially makes a large carbon 
store (estimated to be twice the size of the atmospheric store; Dolman 
et al., 2010) vulnerable to decomposition, which could lead to further 
increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide and methane and hence to 
further global warming. This feedback loop between warming and the 
release of greenhouse gas from thawing tundra represents a potential 
tipping point. However, the carbon released to the atmosphere from 
thawing permafrost is projected to be restricted to 0.09–0.19 Gt C yr–1 
at 2°C of global warming and to 0.08–0.16 Gt C yr–1 at 1.5°C (E.J. 
Burke et al., 2018), which does not indicate a tipping point (medium 
confidence). At higher degrees of global warming, in the order of 
3°C, a different type of tipping point in permafrost may be reached. 
A single model projection (Drijfhout et al., 2015) suggested that 
higher temperatures may induce a smaller ice fraction in soils in the 
tundra, leading to more rapidly warming soils and a positive feedback 
mechanism that results in permafrost collapse (low confidence). The 
disparity between the multi-millennial time scales of soil carbon 
accumulation and potentially rapid decomposition in a warming 
climate implies that the loss of this carbon to the atmosphere would 
be essentially irreversible (Collins et al., 2013). 
3.5.5.4 Asian monsoon
At a fundamental level, the pressure gradient between the Indian Ocean 
and Asian continent determines the strength of the Asian monsoon. As 
land masses warm faster than the oceans, a general strengthening of 
this gradient, and hence of monsoons, may be expected under global 
warming (e.g., Lenton et al., 2008). Additional factors such as changes 
in albedo induced by aerosols and snow-cover change may also affect 
temperature gradients and consequently pressure gradients and the 
strength of the monsoon. In fact, it has been estimated that an increase 
of the regional land mass albedo to 0.5 over India would represent a 
tipping point resulting in the collapse of the monsoon system (Lenton 
et al., 2008). The overall impacts of the various types of radiative 
forcing under different emissions scenarios are more subtle, with a 
weakening of the monsoon north of about 25°N in East Asia but a 
strengthening south of this latitude projected by Jiang and Tian (2013) 
under high and modest emissions scenarios. Increases in the intensity 
of monsoon precipitation are likely under low mitigation (AR5). Given 
that scenarios of 1.5°C or 2°C of global warming would include a 
substantially smaller radiative forcing than those assessed in the study 
by Jiang and Tian (2013), there is low confidence regarding changes in 
monsoons at these low global warming levels, as well as regarding the 
differences between responses at 1.5°C versus 2°C of warming.
3.5.5.5 West African monsoon and the Sahel
Earlier work has identified 3°C of global warming as the tipping point 
leading to a significant strengthening of the West African monsoon and 
subsequent wettening (and greening) of the Sahel and Sahara (Lenton 
et al., 2008). AR5 (Niang et al., 2014), as well as more recent research 
through the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment for Africa 
(CORDEX–AFRICA), provides a more uncertain view, however, in terms 
of the rainfall futures of the Sahel under low mitigation futures. Even 
if a wetter Sahel should materialize under 3°C of global warming (low 
263
3
Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems 
Chapter 3
confidence), it should be noted that there would be significant offsets 
in the form of strong regional warming and related adverse impacts 
on crop yield, livestock mortality and human health under such low 
mitigation futures (Engelbrecht et al., 2015; Sylla et al., 2016; Weber 
et al., 2018).
3.5.5.6 Rainforests
A large portion of rainfall over the world’s largest rainforests is 
recirculated (e.g., Lenton et al., 2008), which raises the concern that 
deforestation may trigger a threshold in reduced forest cover, leading 
to pronounced forest dieback. For the Amazon, this deforestation 
threshold has been estimated to be 40% (Nobre et al., 2016). Global 
warming of 3°C–4°C may also, independent of deforestation, represent 
a tipping point that results in a significant dieback of the Amazon 
forest, with a key forcing mechanism being stronger El Niño events 
bringing more frequent droughts to the region (Nobre et al., 2016). 
Increased fire frequencies under global warming may interact with and 
accelerate deforestation, particularly during periods of El Niño-induced 
droughts (Lenton et al., 2008; Nobre et al., 2016). Global warming of 
3°C is projected to reduce the extent of tropical rainforest in Central 
America, with biomass being reduced by about 40%, which can lead 
to a large replacement of rainforest by savanna and grassland (Lyra et 
al., 2017). Overall, modelling studies (Huntingford et al., 2013; Nobre 
et al., 2016) and observational constraints (Cox et al., 2013) suggest 
that pronounced rainforest dieback may only be triggered at 3°C–4°C 
(medium confidence), although pronounced biomass losses may occur 
at 1.5°C– 2°C of global warming.
3.5.5.7 Boreal forests
Boreal forests are likely to experience stronger local warming than the 
global average (WGII AR5; Collins et al., 2013). Increased disturbance 
from fire, pests and heat-related mortality may affect, in particular, the 
southern boundary of boreal forests (medium confidence) (Gauthier 
et al., 2015), with these impacts accruing with greater warming and 
thus impacts at 2°C would be expected to be greater than those at 
1.5°C (medium confidence). A tipping point for significant dieback of 
the boreal forests is thought to exist, where increased tree mortality 
would result in the creation of large regions of open woodlands 
and grasslands, which would favour further regional warming and 
increased fire frequencies, thus inducing a powerful positive feedback 
mechanism (Lenton et al., 2008; Lenton, 2012). This tipping point has 
been estimated to exist between 3°C and 4°C of global warming 
(low confidence) (Lucht et al., 2006; Kriegler et al., 2009), but given 
the complexities of the various forcing mechanisms and feedback 
processes involved, this is thought to be an uncertain estimate.
3.5.5.8 Heatwaves, unprecedented heat and human health
Increases in ambient temperature are linearly related to hospitalizations 
and deaths once specific thresholds are exceeded (so there is not a 
tipping point per se). It is plausible that coping strategies will not 
be in place for many regions, with potentially significant impacts on 
communities with low adaptive capacity, effectively representing the 
occurrence of a local/regional tipping point. In fact, even if global 
warming is restricted to below 2°C, there could be a substantial increase 
in the occurrence of deadly heatwaves in cities if urban heat island 
effects are considered, with impacts being similar at 1.5°C and 2°C but 
substantially larger than under the present climate (Matthews et al., 
2017). At 1.5°C of warming, twice as many megacities (such as Lagos, 
Nigeria, and Shanghai, China) than at present are likely to become heat 
stressed, potentially exposing more than 350 million more people to 
deadly heat stress by 2050. At 2°C of warming, Karachi (Pakistan) and 
Kolkata (India) could experience conditions equivalent to their deadly 
2015 heatwaves on an annual basis (medium confidence). These 
statistics imply a tipping point in the extent and scale of heatwave 
impacts. However, these projections do not integrate adaptation to 
projected warming, for instance cooling that could be achieved with 
more reflective roofs and urban surfaces in general (Akbari et al., 2009; 
Oleson et al., 2010).
3.5.5.9 Agricultural systems: key staple crops
A large number of studies have consistently indicated that maize crop 
yield will be negatively affected under increased global warming, with 
negative impacts being higher at 2°C of warming than at 1.5°C (e.g., 
Niang et al., 2014; Schleussner et al., 2016b; J. Huang et al., 2017; 
Iizumi et al., 2017). Under 2°C of global warming, losses of 8–14% 
are projected in global maize production (Bassu et al., 2014). Under 
global warming of more than 2°C, regional losses are projected to 
be about 20% if they co-occur with reductions in rainfall (Lana et al., 
2017). These changes may be classified as incremental rather than 
representing a tipping point. Large-scale reductions in maize crop yield, 
including the potential collapse of this crop in some regions, may exist 
under 3°C or more of global warming (low confidence) (e.g., Thornton 
et al., 2011). 
3.5.5.10 Agricultural systems: livestock in the tropics and 
subtropics
The potential impacts of climate change on livestock (Section 3.4.6), 
in particular the direct impacts through increased heat stress, have 
been less well studied than impacts on crop yield, especially from 
the perspective of critical thresholds being exceeded. A case study 
from Jamaica revealed that the difference in heat stress for livestock 
between 1.5°C and 2°C of warming is likely to exceed the limits for 
normal thermoregulation and result in persistent heat stress for these 
animals (Lallo et al., 2018). It is plausible that this finding holds for 
livestock production in both tropical and subtropical regions more 
generally (medium confidence) (Section 3.4.6). Under 3°C of global 
warming, significant reductions in the areas suitable for livestock 
production could occur (low confidence), owing to strong increases in 
regional temperatures in the tropics and subtropics (high confidence). 
Thus, regional tipping points in the viability of livestock production may 
well exist, but little evidence quantifying such changes exists.

Box 3.6 | Economic Damages from Climate Change 
Balancing the costs and benefits of mitigation is challenging because estimating the value of climate change damages depends on 
multiple parameters whose appropriate values have been debated for decades (for example, the appropriate value of the discount rate) 
or that are very difficult to quantify (for example, the value of non-market impacts; the economic effects of losses in ecosystem services; 
and the potential for adaptation, which is dependent on the rate and timing of climate change and on the socio-economic content). See 
Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 2 for the definition of the social cost of carbon and for a discussion of the economics of 1.5°C-consistent 
pathways and the social cost of carbon, including the impacts of inequality on the social cost of carbon.
Global economic damages of climate change are projected to be smaller under warming of 1.5°C than 2°C in 2100 (Warren et al., 
2018c). The mean net present value of the costs of damages from warming in 2100 for 1.5°C and. 2°C (including costs associated 
with climate change-induced market and non-market impacts, impacts due to sea level rise, and impacts associated with large-scale 
discontinuities) are $54 and $69 trillion, respectively, relative to 1961–1990. 
265

Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems 
Chapter 3
Values of the social cost of carbon vary when tipping points are included. The social cost of carbon in the default setting of the Dynamic 
Integrated Climate-Economy (DICE) model increases from $15 tCO2
–1 to $116 (range 50–166) tCO2
–1 when large-scale singularities or 
‘tipping elements’ are incorporated (Y. Cai et al., 2016; Lemoine and Traeger, 2016). Lemoine and Traeger (2016) included optimization 
calculations that minimize welfare impacts resulting from the combination of climate change risks and climate change mitigation costs, 
showing that welfare is minimized if warming is limited to 1.5°C. These calculations excluded the large health co-benefits that accrue 
when greenhouse gas emissions are reduced (Section 3.4.7.1; Shindell et al., 2018).
The economic damages of climate change in the USA are projected to be large (Hsiang et al., 2017; Yohe, 2017). Hsiang et al. (2017) 
shows that the USA stand to lose -0.1 to 1.7% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at 1.5°C warming. Yohe (2017) calculated transient 
temperature trajectories from a linear relationship with contemporaneous cumulative emissions under a median no-policy baseline 
trajectory that brings global emissions to roughly 93 GtCO2 yr–1 by the end of the century (Fawcett et al., 2015), with 1.75°C per 1000 
GtCO2 as the median estimate. Associated aggregate economic damages in decadal increments through the year 2100 are estimated 
in terms of the percentage loss of GDP at the median, 5th percentile and 95th percentile transient temperature (Hsiang et al., 2017). 
The results for the baseline no-policy case indicate that economic damages along median temperature change and median damages 
(median-median) reach 4.5% of GDP by 2100, with an uncertainty range of 2.5% and 8.5% resulting from different combinations of 
temperature change and damages. Avoided damages from achieving a 1.5°C temperature limit along the median-median case are 
nearly 4% (range 2–7%) by 2100. Avoided damages from achieving a 2°C temperature limit are only 3.5% (range 1.8–6.5%). Avoided 
damages from achieving 1.5°C versus 2°C are modest at about 0.35% (range 0.20–0.65%) by 2100. The values of achieving the two 
temperature limits do not diverge significantly until 2040, when their difference tracks between 0.05 and 0.13%; the differences 
between the two temperature targets begin to diverge substantially in the second half of the century. 
3.6 
Implications of Different 1.5°C and 2°C 
Pathways 
This section provides an overview on specific aspects of the mitigation 
pathways considered compatible with 1.5°C of global warming. Some 
of these aspects are also addressed in more detail in Cross-Chapter 
Boxes 7 and 8 in this chapter.
3.6.1 
Gradual versus Overshoot in 1.5°C Scenarios  
All 1.5°C scenarios from Chapter 2 include some overshoot above 
1.5°C of global warming during the 21st century (Chapter 2 and Cross-
Chapter Box 8 in this chapter). The level of overshoot may also depend 
on natural climate variability. An overview of possible outcomes of 
1.5°C-consistent mitigation scenarios for changes in the physical 
climate at the time of overshoot and by 2100 is provided in Cross-
Chapter Box 8 on ‘1.5°C warmer worlds’. Cross-Chapter Box 8 also 
highlights the implications of overshoots.
3.6.2 
Non-CO2 Implications and Projected Risks of 
Mitigation Pathways 
3.6.2.1 Risks arising from land-use changes 
in mitigation pathways
In mitigation pathways, land-use change is affected by many different 
mitigation options. First, mitigation of non-CO2 emissions from 
agricultural production can shift agricultural production between 
regions via trade of agricultural commodities. Second, protection of 
carbon-rich ecosystems such as tropical forests constrains the area 
for agricultural expansion. Third, demand-side mitigation measures, 
such as less consumption of resource-intensive commodities (animal 
products) or reductions in food waste, reduce pressure on land (Popp 
et al., 2017; Rogelj et al., 2018). Finally, carbon dioxide removal 
(CDR) is a key component of most, but not all, mitigation pathways 
presented in the literature to date which constrain warming to 1.5°C 
or 2°C. Carbon dioxide removal measures that require land include 
bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), afforestation and 
reforestation (AR), soil carbon sequestration, direct air capture, biochar 
and enhanced weathering (see Cross-Chapter Box 7 in this chapter). 
These potential methods are assessed in Section 4.3.7. 
In cost-effective integrated assessment modelling (IAM) pathways 
recently developed to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C, 
use of CDR in the form of BECCS and AR are fundamental elements 
(Chapter 2; Popp et al., 2017; Hirsch et al., 2018; Rogelj et al., 2018; 
Seneviratne et al., 2018c). The land-use footprint of CDR deployment 
in 1.5°C-consistent pathways can be substantial (Section 2.3.4, Figure 
2.11), even though IAMs predominantly rely on second-generation 
biomass and assume future productivity increases in agriculture.
A body of literature has explored potential consequences of large-scale 
use of CDR. In this case, the corresponding land footprint by the end 
of the century could be extremely large, with estimates including: up 
to 18% of the land surface being used (Wiltshire and Davies-Barnard, 
2015); vast acceleration of the loss of primary forest and natural 
grassland (Williamson, 2016) leading to increased greenhouse gas 
emissions (P. Smith et al., 2013, 2015); and potential loss of up to 10% 
of the current forested lands to biofuels (Yamagata et al., 2018). Other 
estimates reach 380–700 Mha or 21–64% of current arable cropland 
(Section 4.3.7). Boysen et al. (2017) found that in a scenario in which 
emissions reductions were sufficient only to limit warming to 2.5°C, 
Box 3.6 (continued)
266
Chapter 3 
Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems
3
use of CDR to further limit warming to 1.7°C would result in the 
conversion of 1.1–1.5 Gha of land – implying enormous losses of both 
cropland and natural ecosystems. Newbold et al. (2015) found that 
biodiversity loss in the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)2.6 
scenario could be greater than that in RCP4.5 and RCP6, in which there 
is more climate change but less land-use change. Risks to biodiversity 
conservation and agricultural production are therefore projected to 
result from large-scale bioenergy deployment pathways (P. Smith et 
al., 2013; Tavoni and Socolow, 2013). One study explored an extreme 
mitigation strategy encouraging biofuel expansion sufficient to limit 
warming to 1.5°C and found that this would be more disruptive to land 
use and crop prices than the impacts of a 2°C warmer world which 
has a larger climate signal and lower mitigation requirement (Ruane 
et al., 2018). However, it should again be emphasized that many of the 
pathways explored in Chapter 2 of this report follow strategies that 
explore how to reduce these issues. Chapter 4 provides an assessment 
of the land footprint of various CDR technologies (Section 4.3.7).
The degree to which BECCS has these large land-use footprints 
depends on the source of the bioenergy used and the scale at which 
BECCS is deployed. Whether there is competition with food production 
and biodiversity depends on the governance of land use, agricultural 
intensification, trade, demand for food (in particular meat), feed and 
timber, and the context of the whole supply chain (Section 4.3.7, 
Fajardy and Mac Dowell, 2017; Booth, 2018; Sterman et al., 2018).
The more recent literature reviewed in Chapter 2 explores pathways 
which limit warming to 2°C or below and achieve a balance between 
sources and sinks of CO2 by using BECCS that relies on second-
generation (or even third-generation) biofuels, changes in diet or more 
generally, management of food demand, or CDR options such as forest 
restoration (Chapter 2; Bajželj et al., 2014). Overall, this literature 
explores how to reduce the issues of competition for land with food 
production and with natural ecosystems (in particular forests) (Cross-
Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1; van Vuuren et al., 2009; Haberl et al., 
2010, 2013; Bajželj et al., 2014; Daioglou et al., 2016; Fajardy and Mac 
Dowell, 2017). 
Some IAMs manage this transition by effectively protecting carbon 
stored on land and focusing on the conversion of pasture area 
into both forest area and bioenergy cropland. Some IAMs explore 
1.5°C-consistent pathways with demand-side measures such as dietary 
changes and efficiency gains such as agricultural changes (Sections 
2.3.4 and 2.4.4), which lead to a greatly reduced CDR deployment and 
consequently land-use impacts (van Vuuren et al., 2018). In reality, 
however, whether this CDR (and bioenergy in general) has large 
adverse impacts on environmental and societal goals depends in large 
part on the governance of land use (Section 2.3.4; Obersteiner et al., 
2016; Bertram et al., 2018; Humpenöder et al., 2018).
Rates of sequestration of 3.3 GtC ha–1 require 970 Mha of afforestation 
and reforestation (Smith et al., 2015). Humpenöder et al. (2014) 
estimated that in least-cost pathways afforestation would cover 2800 
Mha by the end of the century to constrain warming to 2°C. Hence, 
the amount of land considered if least-cost mitigation is implemented 
by afforestation and reforestation could be up to three to five 
times greater than that required by BECCS, depending on the forest 
management used. However, not all of the land footprint of CDR is 
necessarily to be in competition with biodiversity protection. Where 
reforestation is the restoration of natural ecosystems, it benefits both 
carbon sequestration and conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem 
services (Section 4.3.7) and can contribute to the achievement of 
the Aichi targets under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) 
(Leadley et al., 2016). However, reforestation is often not defined in 
this way (Section 4.3.8; Stanturf et al., 2014) and the ability to deliver 
biodiversity benefits is strongly dependent on the precise nature 
of the reforestation, which has different interpretations in different 
contexts and can often include agroforestry rather than restoration 
of pristine ecosystems (Pistorious and Kiff, 2017). However, ‘natural 
climate solutions’, defined as conservation, restoration, and improved 
land management actions that increase carbon storage and/or avoid 
greenhouse gas emissions across global forests, wetlands, grasslands 
and agricultural lands, are estimated to have the potential to provide 
37% of the cost-effective CO2 mitigation needed by southern Europe 
and the Mediterranean by 2030 – in order to have a >66% chance of 
holding warming to below 2°C (Griscom et al., 2017). 
Any reductions in agricultural production driven by climate change 
and/or land management decisions related to CDR may (e.g., Nelson 
et al., 2014a; Dalin and Rodríguez-Iturbe, 2016) or may not (Muratori 
et al., 2016) affect food prices. However, these studies did not consider 
the deployment of second-generation (instead of first-generation) 
bioenergy crops, for which the land footprint can be much smaller. 
Irrespective of any mitigation-related issues, in order for ecosystems 
to adapt to climate change, land use would also need to be carefully 
managed to allow biodiversity to disperse to areas that become 
newly climatically suitable for it (Section 3.4.1) and to protect the 
areas where the future climate will still remain suitable. This implies 
a need for considerable expansion of the protected area network 
(Warren et al., 2018b), either to protect existing natural habitat or 
to restore it (perhaps through reforestation, see above). At the same 
time, adaptation to climate change in the agricultural sector (Rippke 
et al., 2016) can require transformational as well as new approaches 
to land-use management; in order to meet the rising food demand 
of a growing human population, it is projected that additional 
land will need to be brought into production unless there are large 
increases in agricultural productivity (Tilman et al., 2011). However, 
future rates of deforestation may be underestimated in the existing 
literature (Mahowald et al., 2017a), and reforestation may therefore 
be associated with significant co-benefits if implemented to restore 
natural ecosystems (high confidence). 
3.6.2.2 Biophysical feedbacks on regional climate 
associated with land-use changes 
Changes in the biophysical characteristics of the land surface are known 
to have an impact on local and regional climates through changes in 
albedo, roughness, evapotranspiration and phenology, which can lead 
to a change in temperature and precipitation. This includes changes in 
land use through agricultural expansion/intensification (e.g., Mueller 
et al., 2016), reforestation/revegetation endeavours (e.g., Feng et al., 
2016; Sonntag et al., 2016; Bright et al., 2017) and changes in land 
management (e.g., Luyssaert et al., 2014; Hirsch et al., 2017) that can

Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems 
Chapter 3
involve double cropping (e.g., Jeong et al., 2014; Mueller et al., 2015; 
Seifert and Lobell, 2015), irrigation (e.g., Lobell et al., 2009; Sacks et 
al., 2009; Cook et al., 2011; Qian et al., 2013; de Vrese et al., 2016; 
Pryor et al., 2016; Thiery et al., 2017), no-till farming and conservation 
agriculture (e.g., Lobell et al., 2006; Davin et al., 2014), and wood 
harvesting (e.g., Lawrence et al., 2012). Hence, the biophysical impacts 
of land-use changes are an important topic to assess in the context of 
low-emissions scenarios (e.g., van Vuuren et al., 2011b), in particular 
for 1.5°C warming levels (see also Cross-Chapter Box 7 in this chapter).
The magnitude of the biophysical impacts is potentially large for 
temperature extremes. Indeed, changes induced both by modifications 
in moisture availability and irrigation and by changes in surface albedo 
tend to be larger (i.e., stronger cooling) for hot extremes than for mean 
temperatures (e.g., Seneviratne et al., 2013; Davin et al., 2014; Wilhelm 
et al., 2015; Hirsch et al., 2017; Thiery et al., 2017). The reasons for 
reduced moisture availability are related to a strong contribution of 
moisture deficits to the occurrence of hot extremes in mid-latitude 
regions (Mueller and Seneviratne, 2012; Seneviratne et al., 2013). In 
the case of surface albedo, cooling associated with higher albedo (e.g., 
in the case of no-till farming) is more effective at cooling hot days 
because of the higher incoming solar radiation for these days (Davin 
et al., 2014). The overall effect of either irrigation or albedo has been 
found to be at the most in the order of about 1°C–2°C regionally for 
temperature extremes. This can be particularly important in the context 
of low-emissions scenarios because the overall effect is in this case 
of similar magnitude to the response to the greenhouse gas forcing 
(Figure 3.22; Hirsch et al., 2017; Seneviratne et al., 2018a,c). 
In addition to the biophysical feedbacks from land-use change and land 
management on climate, there are potential consequences for particular 
ecosystem services. This includes climate change-induced changes in 
crop yield (e.g., Schlenker and Roberts, 2009; van der Velde et al., 2012; 
Asseng et al., 2013, 2015; Butler and Huybers, 2013; Lobell et al., 2014) 
which may be further exacerbated by competing demands for arable 
land between reforestation mitigation activities, crop growth for BECCS 
(Chapter 2), increasing food production to support larger populations, 
and urban expansion (see review by Smith et al., 2010). In particular, 
some land management practices may have further implications for 
food security, for instance throughincreases or decreases in yield when 
tillage is ceased in some regions (Pittelkow et al., 2014). 
We note that the biophysical impacts of land use in the context of 
mitigation pathways constitute an emerging research topic. This 
topic, as well as the overall role of land-use change in climate change 
projections and socio-economic pathways, will be addressed in depth 
in the upcoming IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land Use 
due in 2019. 
3.6.2.3 Atmospheric compounds (aerosols and methane)
There are multiple pathways that could be used to limit anthropogenic 
climate change, and the details of the pathways will influence the 
impacts of climate change on humans and ecosystems. Anthropogenic-
driven changes in aerosols cause important modifications to the 
global climate (Bindoff et al., 2013a; Boucher et al., 2013b; P. Wu et 
al., 2013; Sarojini et al., 2016; H. Wang et al., 2016). Enforcement of 
strict air quality policies may lead to a large decrease in cooling aerosol 
emissions in the next few decades. These aerosol emission reductions 
may cause a warming comparable to that resulting from the increase 
in greenhouse gases by mid-21st century under low CO2 pathways 
(Kloster et al., 2009; Acosta Navarro et al., 2017). Further background

is provided in Sections 2.2.2 and 2.3.1; Cross Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 
1). Because aerosol effects on the energy budget are regional, strong 
regional changes in precipitation from aerosols may occur if aerosol 
emissions are reduced for air quality reasons or as a co-benefit from 
switches to sustainable energy sources (H. Wang et al., 2016). Thus, 
regional impacts, especially on precipitation, are very sensitive to 
1.5°C-consistent pathways (Z. Wang et al., 2017). 
Pathways which rely heavily on reductions in methane (CH4) instead 
of CO2 will reduce warming in the short term because CH4 is such a 
stronger and shorter-lived greenhouse gas than CO2, but will lead 
to stronger warming in the long term because of the much longer 
residence time of CO2 (Myhre et al., 2013; Pierrehumbert, 2014). In 
addition, the dominant loss mechanism for CH4 is atmospheric photo-
oxidation. This conversion modifies ozone formation and destruction in 
the troposphere and stratosphere, therefore modifying the contribution 
of ozone to radiative forcing, as well as feedbacks on the oxidation 
rate of methane itself (Myhre et al., 2013). Focusing on pathways and 
policies which both improve air quality and reduce impacts of climate 
change can provide multiple co-benefits (Shindell et al., 2017). These 
pathways are discussed in detail in Sections 4.3.7 and 5.4.1 and in 
Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 5.
Atmospheric aerosols and gases can also modify the land and ocean 
uptake of anthropogenic CO2; some compounds enhance uptake while 
others reduce it (Section 2.6.2; Ciais et al., 2013). While CO2 emissions 
tend to encourage greater uptake of carbon by the land and the 
ocean (Ciais et al., 2013), CH4 emissions can enhance ozone pollution, 
depending on nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds and other 
organic species concentrations, and ozone pollution tends to reduce 
land productivity (Myhre et al., 2013; B. Wang et al., 2017). Aside from 
inhibiting land vegetation productivity, ozone may also alter the CO2, 
CH4 and nitrogen (N2O) exchange at the land–atmosphere interface 
and transform the global soil system from a sink to a source of 
carbon (B. Wang et al., 2017). Aerosols and associated nitrogen-based 
compounds tend to enhance the uptake of CO2 in land and ocean 
systems through deposition of nutrients and modification of climate 
(Ciais et al., 2013; Mahowald et al., 2017b).

Climate and land form a complex system characterized by multiple feedback processes and the potential for non-linear responses to 
perturbation. Climate determines land cover and the distribution of vegetation, affecting above- and below-ground carbon stocks. 
At the same time, land cover influences global climate through altered biogeochemical processes (e.g., atmospheric composition 
and nutrient flow into oceans), and regional climate through changing biogeophysical processes including albedo, hydrology, 
transpiration and vegetation structure (Forseth, 2010).
Greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes related to land use are reported in the ‘agriculture, forestry and other land use’ sector (AFOLU) and 
comprise about 25% (about 10–12 GtCO2eq yr–1) of anthropogenic GHG emissions (P. Smith et al., 2014). Reducing emissions from 
land use, as well as land-use change, are thus an important component of low-emissions mitigation pathways (Clarke et al., 2014), 
particularly as land-use emissions can be influenced by human actions such as deforestation, afforestation, fertilization, irrigation, 
harvesting, and other aspects of cropland, grazing land and livestock management (Paustian et al., 2006; Griscom et al., 2017; 
Houghton and Nassikas, 2018).
In the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, the vast majority of scenarios assessed with a 66% or better chance of limiting global warming 
to 2°C by 2100 included carbon dioxide removal (CDR) – typically about 10 GtCO2 yr–1 in 2100 or about 200–400 GtCO2 over 
the course of the century (Smith et al., 2015; van Vuuren et al., 2016). These integrated assessment model (IAM) results were 
predominately achieved by using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and/or afforestation and reforestation (AR). 
Virtually all scenarios that limit either peak or end-of-century warming to 1.5°C also use land-intensive CDR technologies (Rogelj 
et al., 2015; Holz et al., 2017; Kriegler et al., 2017; Fuss et al., 2018; van Vuuren et al., 2018). Again, AR (Sections 2.3 and 4.3.7) 
and BECCS (Sections 4.3.2. and 4.3.7) predominate. Other CDR options, such as the application of biochar to soil, soil carbon 
sequestration, and enhanced weathering (Section 4.3.7) are not yet widely incorporated into IAMs, but their deployment would also 
necessitate the use of land and/or changes in land management.
Integrated assessment models provide a simplified representation of land use and, with only a few exceptions, do not include 
biophysical feedback processes (e.g., albedo and evapotranspiration effects) (Kreidenweis et al., 2016) despite the importance of 
these processes for regional climate, in particular hot extremes (Section 3.6.2.2; Seneviratne et al., 2018c). The extent, location and 
impacts of large-scale land-use change described by existing IAMs can also be widely divergent, depending on model structure, 
scenario parameters, modelling objectives and assumptions (including regarding land availability and productivity) (Prestele et 
269

Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems 
Chapter 3
al., 2016; Alexander et al., 2017; Popp et al., 2017; Seneviratne et al., 2018c). Despite these limitations, IAM scenarios effectively  
highlight the extent and nature of potential land-use transitions implicit in limiting warming to 1.5°C.
Cross-Chapter Box 7 Table 1 presents a comparison of the five CDR options assessed in this report. This illustrates that if BECCS 
and AR were to be deployed at a scale of 12 GtCO2 yr–1 in 2100, for example, they would have a substantial land and water 
footprint. Whether this footprint would result in adverse impacts, for example on biodiversity or food production, depends on the 
existence and effectiveness of measures to conserve land carbon stocks, limit the expansion of agriculture at the expense of natural 
ecosystems, and increase agriculture productivity (Bonsch et al., 2016; Obersteiner et al., 2016; Bertram et al., 2018; Humpenöder et 
al., 2018). In comparison, the land and water footprints of enhanced weathering, soil carbon sequestration and biochar application 
are expected to be far less per GtCO2 sequestered. These options may offer potential co-benefits by providing an additional source of 
nutrients or by reducing N2O emissions, but they are also associated with potential side effects. Enhanced weathering would require 
massive mining activity, and providing feedstock for biochar would require additional land, even though a proportion of the required 
biomass is expected to come from residues (Woolf et al., 2010; Smith, 2016). For the terrestrial CDR options, permanence and 
saturation are important considerations, making their viability and long-term contributions to carbon reduction targets uncertain.
The technical, political and social feasibility of scaling up and implementing land-intensive CDR technologies (Cross-Chapter Box 3 
in Chapter 1) is recognized to present considerable potential barriers to future deployment (Boucher et al., 2013a; Fuss et al., 2014, 
2018; Anderson and Peters, 2016; Vaughan and Gough, 2016; Williamson, 2016; Minx et al., 2017, 2018; Nemet et al., 2018; Strefler 
et al., 2018; Vaughan et al., 2018). To investigate the implications of restricting CDR options should these barriers prove difficult to 
overcome, IAM studies (Section 2.3.4) have developed scenarios that limit – either implicitly or explicitly – the use of BECCS and 
bioenergy (Krey et al., 2014; Bauer et al., 2018; Rogelj et al., 2018) or the use of BECCS and afforestation (Strefler et al., 2018). 
Alternative strategies to limit future reliance on CDR have also been examined, including increased electrification, agricultural 
intensification, behavioural change, and dramatic improvements in energy and material efficiency (Bauer et al., 2018; Grubler et 
al., 2018; van Vuuren et al., 2018). Somewhat counterintuitively, scenarios that seek to limit the deployment of BECCs may result in 
increased land use, through greater deployment of bioenergy, and afforestation (Chapter 2, Box 2.1; Krey et al., 2014; Krause et al., 
2017; Bauer et al., 2018; Rogelj et al., 2018). Scenarios aiming to minimize the total human land footprint (including land for food, 
energy and climate mitigation) also result in land-use change, for example by increasing agricultural efficiency and dietary change 
(Grubler et al., 2018).
The impacts of changing land use are highly context, location and scale dependent (Robledo-Abad et al., 2017). The supply of 
biomass for CDR (e.g., energy crops) has received particular attention. The literature identifies regional examples of where the use 
of land to produce biofuels might be sustainably increased (Jaiswal et al., 2017), where biomass markets could contribute to the 
provision of ecosystem services (Dale et al., 2017), and where bioenergy could increase the resilience of production systems and 
contribute to rural development (Kline et al., 2017). However, studies of global biomass potential provide only limited insight into 
the local feasibility of supplying large quantities of biomass on a global scale (Slade et al., 2014). Concerns about large-scale use 
of biomass for CDR include a range of potential consequences including greatly increased demand for freshwater use, increased 
competition for land, loss of biodiversity and/or impacts on food security (Section 3.6.2.1; Heck et al., 2018). The short- versus long-
term carbon impacts of substituting biomass for fossil fuels, which are largely determined by feedstock choice, also remain a source 
of contention (Schulze et al., 2012; Jonker et al., 2014; Booth, 2018; Sterman et al., 2018).
Afforestation and reforestation can also present trade-offs between biodiversity, carbon sequestration and water use, and these 
strategies have a higher land footprint per tonne of CO2 removed (Cunningham, 2015; Naudts et al., 2016; Smith et al., 2018). 
For example, changing forest management to strategies favouring faster growing species, greater residue extraction and shorter 
rotations may have a negative impact on biodiversity (de Jong et al., 2014). In contrast, reforestation of degraded land with native 
trees can have substantial benefits for biodiversity (Section 3.6). Despite these constraints, the potential for increased carbon 
sequestration through improved land stewardship measures is considered to be substantial (Griscom et al., 2017).
Evaluating the synergies and trade-offs between mitigation and adaptation actions, resulting land and climate impacts, and the 
myriad issues related to land-use governance will be essential to better understand the future role of CDR technologies. This topic 
will be addressed further in the IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL) due to be published in 2019.

Key messages:
Cost-effective strategies to limit peak or end-of-century warming to 1.5°C all include enhanced GHG removals in the AFOLU sector 
as part of their portfolio of measures (high confidence). 
Large-scale deployment of land-based CDR would have far-reaching implications for land and water availability (high confidence). 
This may impact food production, biodiversity and the provision of other ecosystem services (high confidence). 
The impacts of deploying land-based CDR at large scales can be reduced if a wider portfolio of CDR options is deployed, and if 
increased mitigation effort focuses on strongly limiting demand for land, energy and material resources, including through lifestyle 
and dietary changes (medium confidence).
Afforestation and reforestation may be associated with significant co-benefits if implemented appropriately, but they feature large 
land and water footprints if deployed at large scales (medium confidence).

Implications Beyond the End of the Century 
3.6.3.1 Sea ice
Sea ice is often cited as a tipping point in the climate system (Lenton, 
2012). Detailed modelling of sea ice (Schröder and Connolley, 2007; 
Sedláček et al., 2011; Tietsche et al., 2011), however, suggests that 
summer sea ice can return within a few years after its artificial removal 
for climates in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Further studies 
(Armour et al., 2011; Boucher et al., 2012; Ridley et al., 2012) modelled 
the removal of sea ice by raising CO2 concentrations and studied 
subsequent regrowth by lowering CO2. These studies suggest that 
changes in Arctic sea ice are neither irreversible nor exhibit bifurcation 
behaviour. It is therefore plausible that the extent of Arctic sea ice may 
quickly re-equilibrate to the end-of-century climate under an overshoot 
scenario.

Chapter 3
3.6.3.2 Sea level
Policy decisions related to anthropogenic climate change will have a 
profound impact on sea level, not only for the remainder of this century 
but for many millennia to come (Clark et al., 2016). On these long time 
scales, 50 m of sea level rise (SLR) is possible (Clark et al., 2016). While it 
is virtually certain that sea level will continue to rise well beyond 2100, 
the amount of rise depends on future cumulative emissions (Church et 
al., 2013) as well as their profile over time (Bouttes et al., 2013; Mengel 
et al., 2018). Marzeion et al. (2018) found that 28–44% of present-day 
glacier volume is unsustainable in the present-day climate and that it 
would eventually melt over the course of a few centuries, even if there 
were no further climate change. Some components of SLR, such as 
thermal expansion, are only considered reversible on centennial time 
scales (Bouttes et al., 2013; Zickfeld et al., 2013), while the contribution 
from ice sheets may not be reversible under any plausible future 
scenario (see below).
Based on the sensitivities summarized by Levermann et al. (2013), the 
contributions of thermal expansion (0.20–0.63 m °C–1) and glaciers 
(0.21 m °C–1 but falling at higher degrees of warming mostly because 
of the depletion of glacier mass, with a possible total loss of about 
0.6 m) amount to 0.5–1.2 m and 0.6–1.7 m in 1.5°C and 2°C warmer 
worlds, respectively. The bulk of SLR on greater than centennial time 
scales will therefore be caused by contributions from the continental 
ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica, whose existence is threatened 
on multi-millennial time scales. 
For Greenland, where melting from the ice sheet’s surface is important, 
a well-documented instability exists where the surface of a thinning 
ice sheet encounters progressively warmer air temperatures that 
further promote melting and thinning. A useful indicator associated 
with this instability is the threshold at which annual mass loss from 
the ice sheet by surface melt exceeds mass gain by snowfall. Previous 
estimates put this threshold at about 1.9°C to 5.1°C above pre-
industrial temperatures (Gregory and Huybrechts, 2006). More recent 
analyses, however, suggest that this threshold sits between 0.8°C 
and 3.2°C, with a best estimate at 1.6°C (Robinson et al., 2012). The 
continued decline of the ice sheet after this threshold has been passed 
is highly dependent on the future climate and varies between about 
80% loss after 10,000 years to complete loss after as little as 2000 
years (contributing about 6 m to SLR). Church et al. (2013) were unable 
to quantify a likely range for this threshold. They assigned medium 
confidence to a range greater than 2°C but less than 4°C, and had 
low confidence in a threshold of about 1°C. There is insufficient new 
literature to change this assessment.
The Antarctic ice sheet, in contrast, loses the mass gained by snowfall 
as outflow and subsequent melt to the ocean, either directly from the 
underside of floating ice shelves or indirectly by the melting of calved 
icebergs. The long-term existence of this ice sheet will also be affected 
by a potential instability (the marine ice sheet instability, MISI), which 
links outflow (or mass loss) from the ice sheet to water depth at the 
grounding line (i.e., the point at which grounded ice starts to float and 
becomes an ice shelf) so that retreat into deeper water (the bedrock 
underlying much of Antarctica slopes downwards towards the centre 
of the ice sheet) leads to further increases in outflow and promotes 
yet further retreat (Schoof, 2007). More recently, a variant on this 
mechanism was postulated in which an ice cliff forms at the grounding 
line and retreats rapidly though fracture and iceberg calving (DeConto 
and Pollard, 2016). There is a growing body of evidence (Golledge et 
al., 2015; DeConto and Pollard, 2016) that large-scale retreat may be 
avoided in emissions scenarios such as Representative Concentration 
Pathway (RCP)2.6 but that higher-emissions RCP scenarios could lead 
to the loss of the West Antarctic ice sheet and sectors in East Antarctica, 
although the duration (centuries or millennia) and amount of mass loss 
during such a collapse is highly dependent on model details and no 
consensus exists yet. Schoof (2007) suggested that retreat may be 
irreversible, although a rigorous test has yet to be made. In this context, 
overshoot scenarios, especially of higher magnitude or longer duration, 
could increase the risk of such irreversible retreat.
Church et al. (2013) noted that the collapse of marine sectors of the 
Antarctic ice sheet could lead to a global mean sea level (GMSL) rise 
above the likely range, and that there was medium confidence that this 
additional contribution ‘would not exceed several tenths of a metre 
during the 21st century’. 
The multi-centennial evolution of the Antarctic ice sheet has been 
considered in papers by DeConto and Pollard (2016) and Golledge et 
al. (2015). Both suggest that RCP2.6 is the only RCP scenario leading 
to long-term contributions to GMSL of less than 1.0 m. The long-term 
committed future of Antarctica and the GMSL contribution at 2100 
are complex and require further detailed process-based modelling; 
however, a threshold in this contribution may be located close to 1.5°C 
to 2°C of global warming.
In summary, there is medium confidence that a threshold in the long-
term GMSL contribution of both the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets 
lies around 1.5°C to 2°C of global warming relative to pre-industrial; 
however, the GMSL associated with these two levels of global warming 
cannot be differentiated on the basis of the existing literature. 
3.6.3.3 Permafrost
The slow rate of permafrost thaw introduces a lag between the 
transient degradation of near-surface permafrost and contemporary 
climate, so that the equilibrium response is expected to be 25–38% 
greater than the transient response simulated in climate models (Slater 
and Lawrence, 2013). The long-term, equilibrium Arctic permafrost loss 
to global warming was analysed by Chadburn et al. (2017). They used 
an empirical relation between recent mean annual air temperatures 
and the area underlain by permafrost coupled to Coupled Model 
Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) stabilization projections 
to 2300 for RCP2.6 and RCP4.5. Their estimate of the sensitivity of 
permafrost to warming is 2.9–5.0 million km2 °C–1 (1 standard deviation 
confidence interval), which suggests that stabilizing climate at 1.5°C as 
opposed to 2°C would reduce the area of eventual permafrost loss by 
1.5 to 2.5 million km2 (stabilizing at 56–83% as opposed to 43–72% of 
1960–1990 levels). This work, combined with the assessment of Collins 
et al. (2013) on the link between global warming and permafrost loss, 
leads to the assessment that permafrost extent would be appreciably 
greater in a 1.5°C warmer world compared to in a 2°C warmer world 
(low to medium confidence).

Knowledge Gaps 
Most scientific literature specific to global warming of 1.5°C is only 
just emerging. This has led to differences in the amount of information 
available and gaps across the various sections of this chapter. In 
general, the number of impact studies that specifically focused on 
1.5°C lags behind climate-change projections in general, due in part to 
the dependence of the former on the latter. There are also insufficient 
studies focusing on regional changes, impacts and consequences at 
1.5°C and 2°C of global warming. 
The following gaps have been identified with respect to tools, 
methodologies and understanding in the current scientific literature

Introduction 
 
The Paris Agreement includes goals of stabilizing global mean surface temperature (GMST) well below 2°C and 1.5°C above pre-
industrial levels in the longer term. There are several aspects, however, that remain open regarding what a ‘1.5°C warmer world’ 
could be like, in terms of mitigation (Chapter 2) and adaptation (Chapter 4), as well as in terms of projected warming and associated 
regional climate change (Chapter 3), which are overlaid on anticipated and differential vulnerabilities (Chapter 5). Alternative 
‘1.5°C warmer worlds’ resulting from mitigation and adaptation choices, as well as from climate variability (climate 
‘noise’), can be vastly different, as highlighted in this Cross-Chapter Box. In addition, the range of models underlying 1.5°C 
projections can be substantial and needs to be considered. 
Key questions7:
• 
What is a 1.5°C global mean warming, how is it measured, and what temperature increase does it imply for 
single locations and at specific times? Global mean surface temperature (GMST) corresponds to the globally averaged 
temperature of Earth derived from point-scale ground observations or computed in climate models (Chapters 1 and 3). Global 
mean surface temperature is additionally defined over a given time frame, for example averaged over a month, a year, or 
multiple decades. Because of climate variability, a climate-based GMST typically needs to be defined over several decades 
(typically 20 or 30 years; Chapter 3, Section 3.2). Hence, whether or when global warming reaches 1.5°C depends to some 
extent on the choice of pre-industrial reference period, whether 1.5°C refers to total or human-induced warming, and which 
variables and coverage are used to define GMST change (Chapter 1). By definition, because GMST is an average in time and 
space, there will be locations and time periods in which 1.5°C of warming is exceeded, even if the global mean warming is at 
1.5°C. In some locations, these differences can be particularly large (Cross-Chapter Box 8, Figure 1).
• 
What is the impact of different climate models for projected changes in climate at 1.5°C of global warming? 
The range between single model simulations of projected regional changes at 1.5°C GMST increase can be substantial for 
regional responses (Chapter 3, Section 3.3). For instance, for the warming of cold extremes in a 1.5°C warmer world, some 
model simulations project a 3°C warming while others project more than 6°C of warming in the Arctic land areas (Cross-
Chapter Box 8, Figure 2). For hot temperature extremes in the contiguous United States, the range of model simulations 
includes temperatures lower than pre-industrial values (–0.3°C) and a warming of 3.5°C (Cross-Chapter Box 8, Figure 2). Some 
regions display an even larger range (e.g., 1°C–6°C regional warming in hot extremes in central Europe at 1.5°C of warming; 
Chapter 3, Sections 3.3.1 and 3.3.2). This large spread is due to both modelling uncertainty and internal climate variability. 
While the range is large, it also highlights risks that can be avoided with near certainty in a 1.5°C warmer world compared 
to worlds at higher levels of warming (e.g., an 8°C warming of cold extremes in the Arctic is not reached at 1.5°C of global 
warming in the multimodel ensemble but could happen at 2°C of global warming; Cross-Chapter Box 8, Figure 2). Inferred 
projected ranges of regional responses (mean value, minimum and maximum) for different mitigation scenarios from Chapter 
2 are displayed in Cross-Chapter Box 8, Table 1. 
• 
What is the impact of emissions pathways with, versus without, an overshoot? All mitigation pathways projecting less 
than 1.5°C of global warming over or at the end of the 21st century include some probability of overshooting 1.5°C. These 
pathways include some periods with warming stronger than 1.5°C in the course of the coming decades and/or some probability 
of not reaching 1.5°C (Chapter 2, Section 2.2). This is inherent to the difficulty of limiting global warming to 1.5°C, given that 
we are already very close to this warming level. The implications of overshooting are large for risks to natural and human

systems, especially if the temperature at peak warming is high, because some risks may be long lasting and irreversible, such 
as the loss of some ecosystems (Chapter 3, Box 3.4). The chronology of emissions pathways and their implied warming is also 
important for the more slowly evolving parts of the Earth system, such as those associated with sea level rise. In addition, for 
several types of risks the rate of change may be most relevant (Loarie et al., 2009; LoPresti et al., 2015), with potentially large 
risks occurring in the case of a rapid rise to overshooting temperatures, even if a decrease to 1.5°C may be achieved at the end 
of the 21st century or later. On the other hand, if overshoot is to be minimized, the remaining equivalent CO2 budget available 
for emissions has to be very small, which implies that large, immediate and unprecedented global efforts to mitigate GHGs are 
required (Cross-Chapter Box 8, Table 1; Chapter 4).
• 
What is the probability of reaching 1.5°C of global warming if emissions compatible with 1.5°C pathways are 
followed? Emissions pathways in a ‘prospective scenario’ (see Chapter 1, Section 1.2.3, and Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1 
on ‘Scenarios and pathways’) compatible with 1.5°C of global warming are determined based on their probability of reaching 
1.5°C by 2100 (Chapter 2, Section 2.1), given current knowledge of the climate system response. These probabilities cannot 
be quantified precisely but are typically 50–66% in 1.5°C-consistent pathways (Section 1.2.3). This implies a one-in-two to 
one-in-three probability that global warming would exceed 1.5°C even under a 1.5°C-consistent pathway, including some 
possibility that global warming would be substantially over this value (generally about 5–10% probability; see Cross-Chapter 
Box 8, Table 1 and Seneviratne et al., 2018b). These alternative outcomes need to be factored into the decision-making process. 
To address this issue, ‘adaptive’ mitigation scenarios have been proposed in which emissions are continually adjusted to 
achieve a temperature goal (Millar et al., 2017). The set of dimensions involved in mitigation options (Chapter 4) is complex 
and need system-wide approaches to be successful. Adaptive scenarios could be facilitated by the global stocktake mechanism 
established in the Paris Agreement, and thereby transfer the risk of higher-than-expected warming to a risk of faster-than- 
expected mitigation efforts. However, there are some limits to the feasibility of such approaches because some investments, for 
example in infrastructure, are long term and also because the actual departure from an aimed pathway will need to be detected 
against the backdrop of internal climate variability, typically over several decades (Haustein et al., 2017; Seneviratne et al., 
2018b). Avoiding impacts that depend on atmospheric composition as well as GMST (Baker et al., 2018) would also require 
limits on atmospheric CO2 concentrations in the event of a lower-than-expected GMST response.
• 
How can the transformation towards a 1.5°C warmer world be implemented? This can be achieved in a variety of 
ways, such as decarbonizing the economy with an emphasis on demand reductions and sustainable lifestyles, or, alternatively, 
with an emphasis on large-scale technological solutions, amongst many other options (Chapter 2, Sections 2.3 and 2.4; 
Chapter 4, Sections 4.1 and 4.4.4). Different portfolios of mitigation measures come with distinct synergies and trade-offs with 
respect to other societal objectives. Integrated solutions and approaches are required to achieve multiple societal objectives 
simultaneously (see Chapter 4, Section 4.5.4 for a set of synergies and trade-offs).

• 
What determines risks and opportunities in a 1.5°C warmer world? The risks to natural, managed and human systems in 
a 1.5°C warmer world will depend not only on uncertainties in the regional climate that results from this level of warming, but 
also very strongly on the methods that humanity uses to limit global warming to 1.5°C. This is particularly the case for natural 
ecosystems and agriculture (see Cross-Chapter Box 7 in this chapter and Chapter 4, Section 4.3.2). The risks to human systems 
will also depend on the magnitude and effectiveness of policies and measures implemented to increase resilience to the risks 
of climate change and on development choices over coming decades, which will influence the underlying vulnerabilities and 
capacities of communities and institutions for responding and adapting.
• 
Which aspects are not considered, or only partly considered, in the mitigation scenarios from Chapter 2? These 
include biophysical impacts of land use, water constraints on energy infrastructure, and regional implications of choices of 
specific scenarios for tropospheric aerosol concentrations or the modulation of concentrations of short-lived climate forcers, 
that is, greenhouse gases (Chapter 3, Section 3.6.3). Such aspects of development pathways need to be factored into 
comprehensive assessments of the regional implications of mitigation and adaptation measures. On the other hand, some of 
these aspects are assessed in Chapter 4 as possible options for mitigation and adaptation to a 1.5°C warmer world.
• 
Are there commonalities to all alternative 1.5°C warmer worlds? Human-driven warming linked to CO2 emissions is nearly 
irreversible over time frames of 1000 years or more (Matthews and Caldeira, 2008; Solomon et al., 2009). The GSMT of the Earth 
responds to the cumulative amount of CO2 emissions. Hence, all 1.5°C stabilization scenarios require both net CO2 emissions and 
multi-gas CO2-forcing-equivalent emissions to be zero at some point (Chapter 2, Section 2.2). This is also the case for stabilization 
scenarios at higher levels of warming (e.g., at 2°C); the only difference is the projected time at which the net CO2 budget is zero. 
Hence, a transition to decarbonization of energy use is necessary in all scenarios. It should be noted that all scenarios 
of Chapter 2 include approaches for carbon dioxide removal (CDR) in order to achieve the net zero CO2 emissions budget. 
Most of these use carbon capture and storage (CCS) in addition to reforestation, although to varying degrees (Chapter 
4, Section 4.3.7). Some potential pathways to 1.5°C of warming in 2100 would minimize the need for CDR (Obersteiner et 
al., 2018; van Vuuren et al., 2018). Taking into account the implementation of CDR, the CO2-induced warming by 2100 is 
determined by the difference between the total amount of CO2 generated (that can be reduced by early decarbonization) and 
the total amount permanently stored out of the atmosphere, for example by geological sequestration (Chapter 4, Section 4.3.7).
• 
What are possible storylines of ‘warmer worlds’ at 1.5°C versus higher levels of global warming? Cross-Chapter Box 
8, Table 2 features possible storylines based on the scenarios of Chapter 2, the impacts of Chapters 3 and 5, and the options of 
Chapter 4. These storylines are not intended to be comprehensive of all possible future outcomes. Rather, they are intended as 
plausible scenarios of alternative warmer worlds, with two storylines that include stabilization at 1.5°C (Scenario 1) or close to 
1.5°C (Scenario 2), and one storyline missing this goal and consequently only including reductions of CO2 emissions and efforts 
towards stabilization at higher temperatures (Scenario 3).
Summary:
There is no single ‘1.5°C warmer world’. Impacts can vary strongly for different worlds characterized by a 1.5°C global 
warming. Important aspects to consider (besides the changes in global temperature) are the possible occurrence 
of an overshoot and its associated peak warming and duration, how stabilization of the increase in global surface 
temperature at 1.5°C could be achieved, how policies might be able to influence the resilience of human and natural 
systems, and the nature of regional and subregional risks. 
The implications of overshooting are large for risks to natural and human systems, especially if the temperature at peak warming 
is high, because some risks may be long lasting and irreversible, such as the loss of some ecosystems. In addition, for several types 
of risks, the rate of change may be most relevant, with potentially large risks occurring in the case of a rapid rise to overshooting 
temperatures, even if a decrease to 1.5°C may be achieved at the end of the 21st century or later. If overshoot is to be minimized, the 
remaining equivalent CO2 budget available for emissions has to be very small, which implies that large, immediate and unprecedented 
global efforts to mitigate GHGs are required. 
The time frame for initiating major mitigation measures is essential in order to reach a 1.5°C (or even a 2°C) global stabilization 
of climate warming (see consistent cumulative CO2 emissions up to peak warming in Cross-Chapter Box 8, Table 1). If mitigation 
pathways are not rapidly activated, much more expensive and complex adaptation measures will have to be taken to avoid the 
impacts of higher levels of global warming on the Earth system.

Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems 
Chapter 3
Scenario 1 [one possible storyline 
among best-case scenarios]: 
Mitigation:  
early move to decarbonization, 
decarbonization designed to minimize 
land footprint, coordination and 
rapid action of the world’s nations 
towards 1.5°C goal by 2100
Internal climate variability:  
probable (66%) best-case outcome for 
global and regional climate responses
In 2020, strong participation and support for the Paris Agreement and its ambitious goals for reducing CO2 emissions 
by an almost unanimous international community led to a time frame for net zero emissions that is compatible with 
halting global warming at 1.5°C by 2100. 
There is strong participation in all major world regions at the national, state and/or city levels. Transport is strongly decarbonized 
through a shift to electric vehicles, with more cars with electric than combustion engines being sold by 2025 (Chapter 2, Section 
2.4.3; Chapter 4, Section 4.3.3). Several industry-sized plants for carbon capture and storage are installed and tested in the 2020s 
(Chapter 2, Section 2.4.2; Chapter 4, Sections 4.3.4 and 4.3.7). Competition for land between bioenergy cropping, food production, 
and biodiversity conservation is minimized by sourcing bioenergy for carbon capture and storage from agricultural wastes, algae 
and kelp farms (Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 3; Chapter 4, Section 4.3.2). Agriculture is intensified in countries with coordinated 
planning associated with a drastic decrease in food waste (Chapter 2, Section 2.4.4; Chapter 4, Section 4.3.2). This leaves many 
natural ecosystems relatively intact, supporting continued provision of most ecosystem services, although relocation of species 
towards higher latitudes and elevations still results in changes in local biodiversity in many regions, particularly in mountain, 
tropical, coastal and Arctic ecosystems (Chapter 3, Section 3.4.3). Adaptive measures such as the establishment of corridors for 
the movement of species and parts of ecosystems become a central practice within conservation management (Chapter 3, Section 
3.4.3; Chapter 4, Section 4.3.2). The movement of species presents new challenges for resource management as novel ecosystems, 
as well as pests and disease, increase (Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 3). Crops are grown on marginal land, no-till agriculture is 
deployed, and large areas are reforested with native trees (Chapter 2, Section 2.4.4; Chapter 3, Section 3.6.2; Cross-Chapter Box 
7 in Chapter 3; Chapter 4, Section 4.3.2). Societal preference for healthy diets reduces meat consumption and associated GHG 
emissions (Chapter 2, Section 2.4.4; Chapter 4, Section 4.3.2; Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 3). 
By 2100, global mean temperature is on average 0.5°C warmer than it was in 2018 (Chapter 1, Section 1.2.1). Only a minor 
temperature overshoot occurs during the century (Chapter 2, Section 2.2). In mid-latitudes, frequent hot summers and precipitation 
events tend to be more intense (Chapter 3, Section 3.3). Coastal communities struggle with increased inundation associated 
with rising sea levels and more frequent and intense heavy rainfall (Chapter 3, Sections 3.3.2 and 3.3.9; Chapter 4, Section 
4.3.2; Chapter 5, Box 5.3 and Section 5.3.2; Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 5), and some respond by moving, in many cases 
with consequences for urban areas. In the tropics, in particular in megacities, there are frequent deadly heatwaves whose risks 
are reduced by proactive adaptation (Chapter 3, Sections 3.3.1 and 3.4.8; Chapter 4, Section 4.3.8), overlaid on a suite of 
development challenges and limits in disaster risk management (Chapter 4, Section 4.3.3; Chapter 5, Sections 5.2.1 and 5.2.2; 
Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 5). Glaciers extent decreases in most mountainous areas (Chapter 3, Sections 3.3.5 and 3.5.4). 
Reduced Arctic sea ice opens up new shipping lanes and commercial corridors (Chapter 3, Section 3.3.8; Chapter 4, Box 4.3). 
Small island developing states (SIDS), as well as coastal and low-lying areas, have faced significant changes but have largely 
persisted in most regions (Chapter 3, Sections 3.3.9 and 3.5.4, Box 3.5). The Mediterranean area becomes drier (Chapter 3, 
Section 3.3.4 and Box 3.2) and irrigation of crops expands, drawing the water table down in many areas (Chapter 3, Section 
3.4.6). The Amazon is reasonably well preserved, through avoided risk of droughts (Chapter 3, Sections 3.3.4 and 3.4.3; Chapter 
4, Box 4.3) and reduced deforestation (Chapter 2, Section 2.4.4; Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 3; Chapter 4, Section 4.3.2), and 
the forest services are working with the pattern observed at the beginning of the 21st century (Chapter 4, Box 4.3). While some 
climate hazards become more frequent (Chapter 3, Section 3.3), timely adaptation measures help reduce the associated risks 
for most, although poor and disadvantaged groups continue to experience high climate risks to their livelihoods and well-being  
(Chapter 5, Section 5.3.1; Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 5; Chapter 3, Boxes 3.4 and 3.5; Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 3). 
Summer sea ice has not completely disappeared from the Arctic (Chapter 3, Section 3.4.4.7) and coral reefs, having been driven to 
a low level (10–30% of levels in 2018), have partially recovered by 2100 after extensive dieback (Chapter 3, Section 3.4.4.10 and 
Box 3.4). The Earth system, while warmer, is still recognizable compared to the 2000s, and no major tipping points are reached 
(Chapter 3, Section 3.5.2.5). Crop yields remain relatively stable (Chapter 3, Section 3.4). Aggregate economic damage of climate 
change impacts is relatively small, although there are some local losses associated with extreme weather events (Chapter 3, 
Section 3.5; Chapter 4). Human well-being remains overall similar to that in 2020 (Chapter 5, Section 5.2.2).
Scenario 2 [one possible storyline 
among mid-case scenarios]:
Mitigation:  
delayed action (ambitious targets 
reached only after warmer decade 
in the 2020s due to internal climate 
variability), overshoot at 2°C, decrease  
towards 1.5°C afterward, no efforts to  
minimize the land and water footprints  
of bioenergy 
Internal climate variability:  
10% worst-case outcome (2020s)  
followed by normal internal climate 
variability 
The international community continues to largely support the Paris Agreement and agrees in 2020 on reduction 
targets for CO2 emissions and time frames for net zero emissions. However, these targets are not ambitious enough 
to reach stabilization at 2°C of warming, let alone 1.5°C. 
In the 2020s, internal climate variability leads to higher warming than projected, in a reverse development to what 
happened in the so-called ‘hiatus’ period of the 2000s. Temperatures are regularly above 1.5°C of warming, although 
radiative forcing is consistent with a warming of 1.2°C or 1.3°C. Deadly heatwaves in major cities (Chicago, Kolkata, Beijing, 
Karachi, São Paulo), droughts in southern Europe, southern Africa and the Amazon region, and major flooding in Asia, all 
intensified by the global and regional warming (Chapter 3, Sections 3.3.1, 3.3.2, 3.3.3, 3.3.4 and 3.4.8; Cross-Chapter 
Box 11 in Chapter 4), lead to increasing levels of public unrest and political destabilization (Chapter 5, Section 5.2.1). An 
emergency global summit in 2025 moves to much more ambitious climate targets. Costs for rapidly phasing out fossil fuel use and 
infrastructure, while rapidly expanding renewables to reduce emissions, are much higher than in Scenario 1, owing to a failure to 
support economic measures to drive the transition (Chapter 4). Disruptive technologies become crucial to face up to the adaptation 
measures needed (Chapter 4, Section 4.4.4).

Mitigation:

in the 2020s due to internal climate 
variability), overshoot at 2°C, decrease  
towards 1.5°C afterward, no efforts to

of bioenergy 
Internal climate variability:  
10% worst-case outcome (2020s)  
followed by normal internal 
climate variability
Temperature peaks at 2°C of warming by the middle of the century before decreasing again owing to intensive implementation 
of bioenergy plants with carbon capture and storage (Chapter 2), without efforts to minimize the land and water footprint of 
bioenergy production (Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 3). Reaching 2°C of warming for several decades eliminates or severely 
damages key ecosystems such as coral reefs and tropical forests (Chapter 3, Section 3.4). The elimination of coral reef ecosystems 
and the deterioration of their calcified frameworks, as well as serious losses of coastal ecosystems such as mangrove forests and 
seagrass beds (Chapter 3, Boxes 3.4 and 3.5, Sections 3.4.4.10 and 3.4.5), leads to much reduced levels of coastal defence from 
storms, winds and waves. These changes increase the vulnerability and risks facing communities in tropical and subtropical regions, 
with consequences for many coastal communities (Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 5). These impacts are being amplified by 
steadily rising sea levels (Chapter 3, Section 3.3.9) and intensifying storms (Chapter 3, Section 3.4.4.3). The intensive area required 
for the production of bioenergy, combined with increasing water stress, puts pressure on food prices (Cross-Chapter Box 6 in 
Chapter 3), driving elevated rates of food insecurity, hunger and poverty (Chapter 4, Section 4.3.2; Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 
3; Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 4). Crop yields decline significantly in the tropics, leading to prolonged famines in some African 
countries (Chapter 3, Section 3.4; Chapter 4, Section 4.3.2). Food trumps environment in terms of importance in most countries, with 
the result that natural ecosystems decrease in abundance, owing to climate change and land-use change (Cross-Chapter Box 7 in 
Chapter 3). The ability to implement adaptive action to prevent the loss of ecosystems is hindered under the circumstances and 
is consequently minimal (Chapter 3, Sections 3.3.6 and 3.4.4.10). Many natural ecosystems, in particular in the Mediterranean, 
are lost because of the combined effects of climate change and land-use change, and extinction rates increase greatly (Chapter 
3, Section 3.4 and Box 3.2). 
By 2100, warming has decreased but is still stronger than 1.5°C, and the yields of some tropical crops are recovering (Chapter 
3, Section 3.4.3). Several of the remaining natural ecosystems experience irreversible climate change-related damages whilst 
others have been lost to land-use change, with very rapid increases in the rate of species extinctions (Chapter 3, Section 3.4; 
Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 3; Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 4). Migration, forced displacement, and loss of identity are 
extensive in some countries, reversing some achievements in sustainable development and human security (Chapter 5, Section 
5.3.2). Aggregate economic impacts of climate change damage are small, but the loss in ecosystem services creates large economic 
losses (Chapter 4, Sections 4.3.2 and 4.3.3). The health and well-being of people generally decrease from 2020, while the levels of 
poverty and disadvantage increase considerably (Chapter 5, Section 5.2.1).
Scenario 3 [one possible storyline 
among worst-case scenarios]:
Mitigation:  
uncoordinated action, major 
actions late in the 21st century, 
3°C of warming in 2100
Internal climate variability:  
unusual (ca. 10%) best-case scenario 
for one decade, followed by normal 
internal climate variability
In 2020, despite past pledges, the international support for the Paris Agreement starts to wane. In the years that 
follow, CO2 emissions are reduced at the local and national level but efforts are limited and not always successful. 
Radiative forcing increases and, due to chance, the most extreme events tend to happen in less populated regions and thus do not 
increase global concerns. Nonetheless, there are more frequent heatwaves in several cities and less snow in mountain resorts in 
the Alps, Rockies and Andes (Chapter 3, Section 3.3). Global warming of 1.5°C is reached by 2030 but no major changes in policies 
occur. Starting with an intense El Niño–La Niña phase in the 2030s, several catastrophic years occur while global warming starts 
to approach 2°C. There are major heatwaves on all continents, with deadly consequences in tropical regions and Asian megacities, 
especially for those ill-equipped for protecting themselves and their communities from the effects of extreme temperatures 
(Chapter 3, Sections 3.3.1, 3.3.2 and 3.4.8). Droughts occur in regions bordering the Mediterranean Sea, central North America, 
the Amazon region and southern Australia, some of which are due to natural variability and others to enhanced greenhouse gas 
forcing (Chapter 3, Section 3.3.4; Chapter 4, Section 4.3.2; Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 4). Intense flooding occurs in high-
latitude and tropical regions, in particular in Asia, following increases in heavy precipitation events (Chapter 3, Section 3.3.3). 
Major ecosystems (coral reefs, wetlands, forests) are destroyed over that period (Chapter 3, Section 3.4), with massive disruption 
to local livelihoods (Chapter 5, Section 5.2.2 and Box 5.3; Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 5). An unprecedented drought leads 
to large impacts on the Amazon rainforest (Chapter 3, Sections 3.3.4 and 3.4), which is also affected by deforestation (Chapter 2). 
A hurricane with intense rainfall and associated with high storm surges (Chapter 3, Section 3.3.6) destroys a large part of Miami. 
A two-year drought in the Great Plains in the USA and a concomitant drought in eastern Europe and Russia decrease global crop 
production (Chapter 3, Section 3.3.4), resulting in major increases in food prices and eroding food security. Poverty levels increase 
to a very large scale, and the risk and incidence of starvation increase considerably as food stores dwindle in most countries; human 
health suffers (Chapter 3, Section 3.4.6.1; Chapter 4, Sections 4.3.2 and 4.4.3; Chapter 5, Section 5.2.1).
There are high levels of public unrest and political destabilization due to the increasing climatic pressures, resulting in some 
countries becoming dysfunctional (Chapter 4, Sections 4.4.1 and 4.4.2). The main countries responsible for the CO2 emissions 
design rapidly conceived mitigation plans and try to install plants for carbon capture and storage, in some cases without sufficient 
prior testing (Chapter 4, Section 4.3.6). Massive investments in renewable energy often happen too late and are uncoordinated; 
energy prices soar as a result of the high demand and lack of infrastructure. In some cases, demand cannot be met, leading 
to further delays. Some countries propose to consider sulphate-aerosol based Solar Radiation Modification (SRM) (Chapter 4, 
Section 4.3.8); however, intensive international negotiations on the topic take substantial time and are inconclusive because of 
overwhelming concerns about potential impacts on monsoon rainfall and risks in case of termination (Cross-Chapter Box 10 in 
Chapter 5). Global and regional temperatures continue to increase strongly while mitigation solutions are being developed and 
implemented.

Scenario 3 [one possible storyline 
among worst-case scenarios]:
Mitigation:  
uncoordinated action, major 
actions late in the 21st century, 
3°C of warming in 2100
Internal climate variability:  
unusual (ca. 10%) best-case scenario 
for one decade, followed by normal 
internal climate variability
Global mean warming reaches 3°C by 2100 but is not yet stabilized despite major decreases in yearly CO2 emissions, as a net zero 
CO2 emissions budget could not yet be achieved and because of the long lifetime of CO2 concentrations (Chapters 1, 2 and 3). 
The world as it was in 2020 is no longer recognizable, with decreasing life expectancy, reduced outdoor labour productivity, and 
lower quality of life in many regions because of too frequent heatwaves and other climate extremes (Chapter 4, Section 4.3.3). 
Droughts and stress on water resources renders agriculture economically unviable in some regions (Chapter 3, Section 3.4; Chapter 
4, Section 4.3.2) and contributes to increases in poverty (Chapter 5, Section 5.2.1; Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 5). Progress on 
the sustainable development goals is largely undone and poverty rates reach new highs (Chapter 5, Section 5.2.3). Major conflicts 
take place (Chapter 3, Section 3.4.9.6; Chapter 5, Section 5.2.1). Almost all ecosystems experience irreversible impacts, species 
extinction rates are high in all regions, forest fires escalate, and biodiversity strongly decreases, resulting in extensive losses to 
ecosystem services. These losses exacerbate poverty and reduce quality of life (Chapter 3, Section 3.4; Chapter 4, Section 4.3.2). 
Life for many indigenous and rural groups becomes untenable in their ancestral lands (Chapter 4, Box 4.3; Cross-Chapter Box 12 
in Chapter 5). The retreat of the West Antarctic ice sheet accelerates (Chapter 3, Sections 3.3 and 3.6), leading to more rapid sea 
level rise (Chapter 3, Section 3.3.9; Chapter 4, Section 4.3.2). Several small island states give up hope of survival in their locations 
and look to an increasingly fragmented global community for refuge (Chapter 3, Box 3.5; Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 5). 
Aggregate economic damages are substantial, owing to the combined effects of climate changes, political instability, and losses 
of ecosystem services (Chapter 4, Sections 4.4.1 and 4.4.2; Chapter 3, Box 3.6 and Section 3.5.2.4). The general health and well-
being of people is substantially reduced compared to the conditions in 2020 and continues to worsen over the following decades 
(Chapter 5, Section 5.2.3).

Frequently Asked Questions 
FAQ 3.1 | What are the Impacts of 1.5°C and 2°C of Warming?
Summary: The impacts of climate change are being felt in every inhabited continent and in the oceans. However, 
they are not spread uniformly across the globe, and different parts of the world experience impacts differently. 
An average warming of 1.5°C across the whole globe raises the risk of heatwaves and heavy rainfall events, 
amongst many other potential impacts. Limiting warming to 1.5°C rather than 2°C can help reduce these risks, 
but the impacts the world experiences will depend on the specific greenhouse gas emissions ‘pathway’ taken. 
The consequences of temporarily overshooting 1.5°C of warming and returning to this level later in the century, 
for example, could be larger than if temperature stabilizes below 1.5°C. The size and duration of an overshoot 
will also affect future impacts.
Human activity has warmed the world by about 1°C since pre-industrial times, and the impacts of this warming 
have already been felt in many parts of the world. This estimate of the increase in global temperature is the 
average of many thousands of temperature measurements taken over the world’s land and oceans. Temperatures 
are not changing at the same speed everywhere, however: warming is strongest on continents and is particularly 
strong in the Arctic in the cold season and in mid-latitude regions in the warm season. This is due to self-
amplifying mechanisms, for instance due to snow and ice melt reducing the reflectivity of solar radiation at the 
surface, or soil drying leading to less evaporative cooling in the interior of continents. This means that some parts 
of the world have already experienced temperatures greater than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. 
Extra warming on top of the approximately 1°C we have seen so far would amplify the risks and associated 
impacts, with implications for the world and its inhabitants. This would be the case even if the global warming 
is held at 1.5°C, just half a degree above where we are now, and would be further amplified at 2°C of global 
warming. Reaching 2°C instead of 1.5°C of global warming would lead to substantial warming of extreme hot 
days in all land regions. It would also lead to an increase in heavy rainfall events in some regions, particularly in 
the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, potentially raising the risk of flooding. In addition, some regions, 
such as the Mediterranean, are projected to become drier at 2°C versus 1.5°C of global warming. The impacts of 
any additional warming would also include stronger melting of ice sheets and glaciers, as well as increased sea 
level rise, which would continue long after the stabilization of atmospheric CO2 concentrations. 
Change in climate means and extremes have knock-on effects for the societies and ecosystems living on the 
planet. Climate change is projected to be a poverty multiplier, which means that its impacts are expected to make 
the poor poorer and the total number of people living in poverty greater. The 0.5°C rise in global temperatures 
that we have experienced in the past 50 years has contributed to shifts in the distribution of plant and animal 
species, decreases in crop yields and more frequent wildfires. Similar changes can be expected with further rises 
in global temperature.
Essentially, the lower the rise in global temperature above pre-industrial levels, the lower the risks to human 
societies and natural ecosystems. Put another way, limiting warming to 1.5°C can be understood in terms of 
‘avoided impacts’ compared to higher levels of warming. Many of the impacts of climate change assessed in this 
report have lower associated risks at 1.5°C compared to 2°C.
Thermal expansion of the ocean means sea level will continue to rise even if the increase in global temperature 
is limited to 1.5°C, but this rise would be lower than in a 2°C warmer world. Ocean acidification, the process by 
which excess CO2 is dissolving into the ocean and increasing its acidity, is expected to be less damaging in a world 
where CO2 emissions are reduced and warming is stabilized at 1.5°C compared to 2°C. The persistence of coral 
reefs is greater in a 1.5°C world than that of a 2°C world, too. 
The impacts of climate change that we experience in future will be affected by factors other than the change 
in temperature. The consequences of 1.5°C of warming will additionally depend on the specific greenhouse gas 
emissions ‘pathway’ that is followed and the extent to which adaptation can reduce vulnerability. This IPCC 
Special Report uses a number of ‘pathways’ to explore different possibilities for limiting global warming to 
1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. One type of pathway sees global temperature stabilize at, or just below, 1.5°C. 
Another sees global temperature temporarily exceed 1.5°C before declining later in the century (known as an 
‘overshoot’ pathway).

Impacts of 1.5°C of Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems 
Chapter 3
Such pathways would have different associated impacts, so it is important to distinguish between them for 
planning adaptation and mitigation strategies. For example, impacts from an overshoot pathway could be larger 
than impacts from a stabilization pathway. The size and duration of an overshoot would also have consequences 
for the impacts the world experiences. For instance, pathways that overshoot 1.5°C run a greater risk of passing 
through ‘tipping points’, thresholds beyond which certain impacts can no longer be avoided even if temperatures 
are brought back down later on. The collapse of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets on the time scale of 
centuries and millennia is one example of a tipping point.
