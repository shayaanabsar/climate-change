Preface 
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 
was jointly established by our two organisations in 1988. 
Under the chairmanship of Professor Bert Bolin, the Panel 
was charged with: 
(i) 
assessing the scientific information that is related to 
the various components of the climate change issue, 
such as emissions of major greenhouse gases and 
modification of the Earth's radiation balance resulting 
therefrom, 
and that needed to enable 
the 
environmental and socio-economic consequences of 
climate change to be evaluated, 
(ii) 
formulating realistic response strategies for the 
management of the climate change issue. 
The Panel began its task by establishing Working Groups I, 
II and III respectively to: 
(a) 
assess available scientific information on climate 
change. 
(b) 
assess environmental and socio-economic impacts of 
climate change. 
(c) 
formulate response strategies. 
It also established a Special Committee on the Participation 
of Developing Countries to promote, as quickly as possible, 
the full participation of developing countries in its 
activities. 
This volume is based upon the findings of Working 
Group I, and should be read in conjunction with the rest of 
the IPCC first assessment report; the latter consists of the 
reports and policymakers summaries of the 3 Working 
Groups and the Special Committee, and the IPCC overview 
and conclusions. 
The Chairman of Working Group I, Dr John Houghton, 
and his Secretariat, have succeeded beyond measure in 
mobilizing the co-operation and enthusiasm of hundreds of 
scientists from all over the world. They have produced a 
volume of remarkable depth and breadth, and a 
Policymakers Summary which translates these complex 
scientific issues into language which is understandable to 
the non-specialist. 
We take this opportunity to congratulate and thank the 
Chairman for a job well done.

Foreword 
Many previous reports have addressed the question of 
climate change which might arise as a result of man's 
activities. In preparing this Scientific Assessment, Working 
Group I ' has built on these, in particular the SCOPE 29 
report of 1986 2, taking into account significant work 
undertaken and published since then Particular attention is 
paid to what is known regarding the detail of climate 
change on a regional level 
In the preparation of the main Assessment most of the 
active scientists working in the field have been involved 
One hundred and seventy scientists from 25 countries have 
contributed to it, either through participation in the twelve 
international workshops organised specially for the purpose 
or through written contributions A further 200 scientists 
have been involved in the peer review of the draft report 
Although, as in any developing scientific topic, there is a 
minority of opinions which we have not been able to 
accommodate, the peer review has helped to ensure a high 
degree of consensus amongst authors and reviewers 
regarding the results presented Thus the Assessment is an 
authoritative statement of the views of the international 
scientific community at this time 
The accompanying Policymakers' Summary, based 
closely on the conclusions of the Assessment, has been 
prepared particularly to meet the needs of those without a 
strong background in science who need a clear statement of 
the present status of scientific knowledge and the 
associated uncertainties

The First Draft of the Policymakers Summary was 
presented to the meeting of the Lead Authors of the 
Assessment (Edinburgh, February 1990), and the Second 
Draft which emanated from that meeting was sent for the 
same wide peer review as the main report, including 
nationally designated experts and the committees of 
relevant international scientific programmes A Third Draft 
incorporating a large number of changes suggested by peer-
reviewers was tabled at the final plenary meeting of 
Working Group I (Windsor, May 1990) at which the Lead 
Authors of the main report were present, and the final 
version was agreed at that meeting 
It gives me pleasure to acknowledge the contributions of 
so many, in particular the Lead Authors, who have given 
freely of their expertise and time to the preparation of this 
report 
All the modelling centres must be thanked for 
providing data so readily for the model lntercompanson I 
also acknowledge the contribution of the core team at the 
Meteorological Office in Bracknell who were responsible 
for organising most of the workshops and preparing the 
report Members of the team were Professor Cac Hong 
Xing from China, Dr Reindert Haarsma from The 
Netherlands, Dr Robert Watson from the USA, and Dr John 
Mitchell, Dr Peter Rowntree, Dr Terry Callaghan, Chris 
Folland, Jim Ephraums, Shelagh Varney, Andrew Gilchusl

are also due to Dr Sundararaman and the IPCC 
Secretariat in Geneva. Financial support for the Bracknell 
core team was provided by the Departments of the 
Environment and Energy in the UK. 
I am confident that the Assessment and its Summary will 
provide the necessary firm scientific foundation for the 
forthcoming discussions and negotiations on the 
appropriate strategy for response and action regarding the 
issue of climate change. It is thus, I believe, a significant 
step forward in meeting what is potentially the greatest 
global environmental challenge facing mankind.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
We are certain of the following: 
• there is a natural greenhouse effect which already 
keeps the Earth wanner than it would otherwise be 
• emissions resulting from human activities are 
substantially increasing the atmospheric concen 
trations of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide, 
methane, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and nitrous 
oxide These increases will enhance the greenhouse 
effect, resulting on average in an additional warming 
of the Earth's surface The main greenhouse gas, 
water vapour, will increase in response to global 
warming and further enhance it 
We calculate with confidence that: 
• some gases are potentially more effective than others 
at changing climate, and their relative effectiveness 
can be estimated Carbon dioxide has been res-
ponsible for over half the enhanced greenhouse effect 
in the past, and is likely to remain so in the future 
• atmospheric concentrations of the long-lived gases 
(carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and the CFCs) adjust 
only slowly to changes in emissions Continued 
emissions of these gases at present rates would 
commit us to increased concentrations lor centuries 
ahead The longer emissions continue to increase at 
present day rates, the greater reductions would have 
to be for concentrations to stabilise at a given level 
• the long-lived gases would require immediate 
reductions in emissions from human activities of 
over 60% to stabilise their concentrations at today's 
levels, methane would require a 15-20% reduction 
Based on current model results, we predict: 
• under the IPCC Business-as-Usual (Scenario A) 
emissions of greenhouse gases, a rate of increase of 
global mean temperature during the next century of 
about 0 3°C per decade (with an uncertainty range of 
0 2°C to 0 5°C per decade), this is greater than that 
seen over the past 10,000 years This will result in a 
likely increase in global mean temperature of about 
1°C above the present value by 2025 and VC before 
the end of the next century The rise will not be 
steady because of the influence of other factors 
• under the other IPCC emission scenarios which 
assume progressively increasing levels of controls 
rates of increase in global mean temperature of about 
0 2°C per decade (Scenario B), just above 0 1°C per 
decade (Scenario C) and about 0 1 °C per decade 
(Scenario D) 
• that land surfaces warm more rapidly than the ocean 
and high northern latitudes warm more than the 
global mean in winter 
• regional climate changes different from the global 
mean, although our confidence in the prediction of 
the detail of regional changes is low For example, 
temperature increases in Southern Europe and central 
North America are predicted to be higher than the 
global mean accompanied on average by reduced 
summer precipitation and soil moistuic There are 
less consistent predictions lor the tropics and the 
Southern Hemisphere 
• under the IPCC Business as Usual emissions 
scenario, an average rate of global mean sea level 
rise of about 6cm per decade over the next century 
(with an uncertainty range of 3 - 10cm per decade) 
mainly due to thermal expansion ol the oceans and 
the melting of some land ice The predicted rise is 
about 20cm in global mean sea level by 2(H0, and 
65cm by the end of the next century There will be 
significant regional variations 
Ml 
Policymakers Summaiy 
There are many uncertainties in our predictions 
particularly with regard to the timing, magnitude and 
regional patterns of climate change, due to our 
incomplete understanding of: 
• sources and sinks of greenhouse gases, which affect 
predictions of future concentrations 
• clouds, which strongly influence the magnitude of 
climate change 
• oceans, which influence the timing and patterns of 
climate change 
• polar ice sheets which affect predictions of sea level 
rise 
These processes are already partially understood, and we 
are confident that the uncertainties can be reduced by 
further research However, the complexity of the system 
means that we cannot rule out surprises 
uivocal detection of the enhanced greenhouse effect 
from observations is not likely for a decade or more 
• There is no firm evidence that climate has become 
more variable over the last few decades However, 
with an increase in the mean temperature, episodes of 
high temperatures will most likely become more 
frequent in the future, and cold episodes less 
frequent 
• Ecosystems affect climate, and will be affected by a 
changing climate and by increasing carbon dioxide 
concentrations Rapid changes in climate will change 
the composition of ecosystems, some species will 
benefit while others will be unable to migrate or 
adapt fast enough and may become extinct Enhanced 
levels of carbon dioxide may increase productivity 
and efficiency of water use of vegetation The effect 
of warming on biological processes, although poorly 
understood, 
may 
increase 
the 
atmospheric 
concentrations of natural greenhouse gases 
Our judgement is that: 
• Global - mean surface air temperature has increased 
by 0 3°C to 0 6°C over the last 100 years, with the 
five global-average warmest years being in the 
1980s Over the same period global sea level has 
increased by 10-20cm These increases have not been 
smooth with time, nor uniform over the globe 
• The size of this warming is broadly consistent with 
predictions of climate models, but it is also of the 
same magnitude as natural climate variability Thus 
the observed increase could be largely due to this 
natural variability, alternatively this variability and 
other human factors could have offset a still larger 
human-induced greenhouse warming The uneq-
To improve our predictive capability, we need: 
• to understand better the various climate-related 
processes, particularly those associated with clouds, 
oceans and the carbon cycle 
• to improve the systematic observation of climate-
related variables on a global basis, and further 
investigate changes which took place in the past 
• to develop improved models of the Earth's climate 
system 
• to increase support for national and international 
climate research activities, especially in developing 
countries 
• to facilitate international exchange of climate data

Introduction: what is the issue ? 
There is concern that human activities may be inadvertently 
changing the climate of the globe through the enhanced 
greenhouse effect, by past and continuing emissions of 
carbon dioxide and other gases which will cause the 
temperature of the Earth's surface to increase - popularly 
termed the "global warming' If this occurs, consequent 
changes may have a significant impact on society 
The purpose of the Working Group I report, as 
determined by the first meeting of IPCC, is to provide a 
scientific assessment of 
1) 
the factors which may affect climate change during 
the next century, especially those which are due to 
human activity 
2) 
the responses of the atmosphere - ocean - land - ice 
system 
3) 
current capabilities of modelling global and regional 
climate changes and their predictability 
4) 
the past climate record and presently observed 
climate anomalies 
On the basis of this assessment, the report presents current 
knowledge regarding predictions of climate change (incl-
uding sea level rise and the effects on ecosystems) over the 
next century, the timing of changes together with an 
assessment of the uncertainties associated with these 
predictions 
This Policymakers Summary aims to bring out those 
elements of the main report which have the greatest 
relevance to policy formulation, in answering the following 
questions 
• 
What factors determine global climate7 
• 
What are the greenhouse gases, and how and why are 
they increasing9 
• 
Which gases are the most important9 
• 
How much do we expect the climate to change9 
• 
How much confidence 
do we have in our 
predictions9 
• 
Will the climate of the future be very different 9 
• 
Have human activities already begun to change 
global climate9 
How much will sea level rise9 
• 
What will be the effects on ecosystems9 
• 
What should be done to reduce uncertainties, and 
how long will this take9 
This report is intended to respond to the practical needs of 
the policymaker It is neither an academic review, nor a 
plan for a new research programme Uncertainties attach to 
almost every aspect of the issue, yet policymakers are 
looking for clear guidance from scientists, hence authors 
have been asked to provide their best-estimates 
wherever possible, together with an assessment of the 
uncertainties 
This report is a summary of our understanding in 1990 
Although continuing research will deepen this under-
standing and require the report to be updated at frequent 
intervals, basic conclusions concerning the reality of the 
enhanced greenhouse effect and its potential to alter global 
climate are unlikely to change significantly Nevertheless, 
the complexity of the system may give rise to surprises 
What factors determine global climate ? 
There are many factors, both natural and of human origin, 
that determine the climate of the earth We look first at 
those which are natural, and then see how human activities 
might contribute 
What natural factors are important? 
The driving energy for weather and climate comes from the 
Sun The Earth intercepts solar radiation (including that in 
the short-wave, visible, part of the spectrum), about a third 
of it is reflected, the rest is absorbed by the different 
components (atmosphere, ocean, ice, land and biota) of the 
climate system The energy absorbed from solar radiation is 
balanced (in the long term) by outgoing radiation from the 
Earth and atmosphere, this terrestrial radiation takes the 
form of long-wave invisible infrared energy, and its 
magnitude is determined by the temperature of the Earth-
atmosphere system 
There are several natural factors which can change the 
balance between the energy absorbed by the Earth and that 
emitted by it in the form of longwave infrared radiation 
these factors cause the radiative forcing on climate The 
most obvious of these is a change in the output of energy 
from the Sun There is direct evidence of such variability 
over the 11-year solar cycle, and longer period changes 
may also occur Slow variations in the Earth s orbit affect 
the seasonal and latitudinal distribution of solar radiation 
these were probably responsible for initiating the ice ages 
One of the most important factors is the greenhouse 
effect, a simplified explanation of which is as follows 
Short-wave solar radiation can pass through the clear 
atmosphere relatively unimpeded But long-wave terrestrial 
radiation emitted by the warm surface of the Earth is 
partially absorbed and then re-emitted by a number of trace 
gases in the cooler atmosphere above Since, on average, 
the outgoing long wave radiation balances the incoming 
solar radiation both the atmosphere and the surface will be 
warmer than they would be without the greenhouse gases

AGE (THOUSAND YEARS BEFORE PRESENT) 
Figure 2: Analysis of air trapped in Antarctic ice cores shows 
that methane and carbon dioxide concentrations weie closely 
correlated with the local temperature over the lasi 160 000 years 
Present day concentrations ol carbon dioxide are indicated 
There are other human activities which have the potential 
to affect climate A change in the albedo (icflectivity) of 
the land, brought about by desertification or deforestation 
affects the amount of solar energy absorbed at the Earth s 
surface 
Human-made aerosols, fiom sulphur emitted 
largely in fossil fuel combustion can modify clouds and 
this may act to lower tempeiatures 
Lastly, changes in 
ozone in the stratosphere due to CFCs may also influence 
climate 
What are the greenhouse gases and why are they 
increasing? 
We aie certain that the concentiations of gieenhouse gases 
in the atmosphere have changed natuially on ice-age time-
scales and have been increasing since pre-industrial times 
due to human activities Table l suminanzes the present 
and pie-industnal abundances, cm rent rates of change and 
piesent atmospheric lifetimes ol gieenhouse gases 
influenced by human activities Caibon dioxide methane 
and nitrous oxide all have significant natural and human 
sources, while the chlorofluorocarbons are only produced 
industrially 
Two important greenhouse gases, water vapoui and 
ozone, are not included in this table Water vapour has the 
largest greenhouse effect, but its concentration in the 
troposphere is determined internally within the climate 
system, and, on a global scale, is not affected by human 
sources and sinks Water vapour will increase in response 
to global warming and further enhance it, this process is 
included in climate models The concentration of ozone is 
changing both in the stratosphere and the troposphere due 
to human activities, but it is difficult to quantify the 
changes from present observations 
For a thousand years prior to the industrial revolution, 
abundances of the greenhouse gases weie relatively 
constant However, as the worlds population incieased as 
the world became more industrialized and as agriculture 
developed, the abundances of the greenhouse gases 
increased markedly Figure 3 illustrates this lor carbon 
dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and CFC 11 
Since the industiial revolution the combustion of fossil 
fuels and deforestation have led to an increase ol 26% in 
carbon dioxide concentiation in the atmospheie We know 
the magnitude of the present day fossil-fuel source, but the 
input from deforestation cannot be estimated accurately In 
addition, although about half of the emitted carbon dioxide 
stays in the atmosphere, we do not know well how much of 
the remainder is absorbed by the oceans and how much by 
terrestrial biota Emissions ol chloiofluorocaibons used as 
aerosol propellants, solvents refngeiants and loam blowing 
agents, are also well known, they were not present in the 
atmosphere before their invention in the I9^0s 
The sources of methane and nitrous oxide aie less well 
known Methane concentrations have moie than doubled 
because of rice production cattle reanng biomass burning 
coal mining and ventilation ol natuial gas also lossil fuel 
combustion may have also conlnbuted thiough chemical 
reactions in the atmosphere which ieduce the iate ol 
removal of methane Nitrous oxide has incieased by about 
89f since pie-industnal times piesumabl) due to human 
activities, we arc unable to specify the sources but it is 
likely that agriculture plays a pan 
The effect of ozone on climate is strongest in the upper 
troposphere and lower stiatosphere Model calculations 
indicate that ozone in the upper tiopospheie should have 
increased due to human-made emissions of nitrogen oxides, 
hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide While at giound level 
ozone has increased in the Northern Hemisphere in 
response to these emissions observations are insufficient to 
contnm the expected inciease in (he uppei tiopospheie 
The lack of adequate obseivations pi events us from

Figure 4: The relationship between hypothetical fossil fuel emissions of carbon dioxide and its concentration in the atmosphere is 
shown in the case where (a) emissions continue at 1990 levels, (b) emissions are reduced by 50% in 1990 and continue at that level, 
(c) emissions are reduced by 2% pa from 1990, and (d) emissions, after increasing by 2% pa until 2010, are then reduced by 2% pa 
thereafter 
In the lower stratosphere at high southern latitudes ozone 
has decreased considerably due to the effects of CFCs, and 
there are indications of a global-scale decrease which, 
while not understood, may also be due to CFCs These 
observed decreases should act to cool the earth's surface, 
thus providing a small offset to the predicted warming 
produced by the other greenhouse gases Further reductions 
in lower stratospheric ozone are possible during the next 
few decades as the atmospheric abundances of CFCs 
continue to increase 
Concentrations, lifetimes and stabilisation of the gases 
In order to calculate the atmospheric concentrations of 
carbon dioxide which will result from human-made 
emissions we use computer models which incorporate 
details of the emissions and which include representations 
of the transfer of carbon dioxide between the atmosphere, 
oceans and terrestrial biosphere For the other greenhouse 
gases, models which incorporate the effects of chemical 
reactions in the atmosphere are employed 
The atmospheric lifetimes of the gases are determined by 
their sources and sinks in the oceans, atmosphere and 
biosphere Carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons and nitrous 
oxide are removed only slowly from the atmosphere and 
hence, following a change in emissions, their atmospheric 
concentrations take decades to centuries to adjust fully 
Even if all human-made emissions of carbon dioxide were 
halted in the year 1990, about half of the increase in carbon 
dioxide concentration caused by human activities would 
still be evident by the year 2100 
In contrast, some of the CFC substitutes and methane 
have relatively short atmospheric lifetimes so that their 
atmospheric concentrations respond fully to emission 
changes within a few decades 
To illustrate the emission-concentration relationship 
clearly, the effect of hypothetical changes in carbon dioxide 
fossil fuel emissions is shown in Figure 4 (a) continuing 
global emissions at 1990 levels, (b) halving of emissions in 
1990, (c) reductions in emissions of 2% per year (pa) from 
1990 and (d) a 2% pa increase from 1990-2010 followed by 
a 2% pa decrease from 2010 
Continuation of present day emissions are committing us 
to increased future concentrations, and the longer emissions 
continue to increase, the greater would reductions have to 
be to stabilise at a given level If there are critical 
concentration levels that should not be exceeded, then the 
earlier emission reductions are made the more effective 
they are 
The term "atmospheric stabilisation" is often used to 
describe the limiting of the concentration of the greenhouse 
gases at a certain level The amount by which human-made 
emissions of a greenhouse gas must be reduced in order to 
stabilise at present day concentrations, for example, is 
shown in Table 2 For most gases the reductions would 
have to be substantial 
How will greenhouse gas abundances change in the 
future? 
We need to know future greenhouse gas concentrations in 
order to estimate future climate change As already 
mentioned, these concentrations depend upon the 
magnitude of human-made emissions and on how changes 
in climate and other environmental conditions may 
influence the biosphenc processes that control the 
exchange of natural greenhouse gases, including carbon 
dioxide and methane between the atmosphere, oceans and 
terrestrial biosphere the greenhouse gas 'feedbacks

Note that the stabilisation of each of these gases would have different effects on climate, 
as explained in the next section 
Four scenarios of future human-made emissions were 
developed by Working Group III The first of these 
assumes that few or no steps are taken to limit greenhouse 
gas emissions and this is therefore termed Business-as-
Usual (BaU) (It should be noted that an aggregation of 
national forecasts ol emissions of carbon dioxide and 
methane to the year 2025 undertaken by Working Group III 
resulted in global emissions 10-20% higher than in the BaU 
scenano) The other thiee scenarios assume that pro-
gressively increasing levels of controls reduce the giowth 
ol emissions these aie refened to as scenarios B, C, and D 
They are hi icily descnbcd in the Annex to this summary 
Future concentiations ol some of the greenhouse gases 
which would arise liom these emissions are shown in 
Figure 5 
Greenhouse gas feedbacks 
Some ol the possible feedbacks which could significantly 
modify luture greenhouse gas concentrations in a warmer 
woild aie discussed in the following paragraphs 
The net emissions ol carbon dioxide from terrestrial 
ecosystems will be elevated it higher temperatures increase 
lespiration at a faster rate than photosynthesis or if plant 
populations particularly large forests, cannot adjust rapidly 
enough to changes in climate 
A net flux of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere may be 
paiticularly evident in warmer conditions in tundra and 
boieal legions wheie there are large stores of carbon The 
opposite is true if higher abundances of carbon dioxide in 
the atmosphere enhance the productivity of natural 
ecosystems or if there is an increase in soil moisture which 
can be expected to stimulate plant growth in dry 
ecosystems and to increase the storage of carbon in tundra 
peat The extent to which ecosystems can sequester 
incieasing atmosphei IC carbon dioxide remains to be 
quantified 
It the oceans become wanner, their net uptake of carbon 
dioxide may decrease because of changes in (i) the 
chemistry of carbon dioxide in seawater, (n) biological 
activity in surface waters, and (in) the rate of exchange of 
carbon dioxide between the surface layers and the deep 
ocean This last depends upon the rate of formation of deep 
water in the ocean which, in the North Atlantic for 
example, might decrease if the salinity decreases as a result 
of a change in climate 
Methane emissions from natural wetlands and rice 
paddies are particularly sensitive to temperature and soil 
moisture Emissions are significantly larger at higher 
temperatuies and with increased soil moisture, conversely, 
a decrease in soil moisture would lesult in smaller 
emissions 
Higher temperatures could increase the 
emissions of methane at high northern latitudes from 
decomposable organic matter trapped in permafrost and 
methane hydrates 
As illustrated earlier, ice core iccords show that methane 
and carbon dioxide concentrations changed in a similar 
sense to temperature between ice ages and interglacials 
Although many of these feedback processes are poorly 
understood, it seems likely that, overall, they will act to 
increase, rather than decrease, greenhouse gas con 
centrations in a warmei world 
Which gases are the most important? 
We are certain that increased greenhouse gas con-
centrations increase radiative lorcing We can calculate the 
forcing with much more confidence than the climate 
change that results because the former avoids the need to 
evaluate a number ol poorly understood atmospheric 
responses Wc then have a base from which to calculate the 
ielativc effect on climate of an increase in concentration 
of each gas in the piesent-day atmosphere both in absolute 
teims and ielativc to caibon dioxide These ielativc ellccts

scenarios 
per-kilogram basis, the equivalent values are 58 for 
methane and about 4,000 for CFC-11, both relative to 
carbon dioxide Values for other greenhouse gases are to be 
lound in Section 2 
The total ladiative foicing at any time is the sum of those 
from the individual greenhouse gases We show in Figuie 6 
how this quantity has changed in the past (based on 
observations of greenhouse gases) and how it might change 
in the future (based on the four IPCC emissions scenarios) 
For simplicity, we can express total forcing in terms ol the 
amount of carbon dioxide which would give that forcing, 
this is termed the equivalent carbon dioxide conc-
entration Greenhouse gases have increased since pre-
mdustnal times (the mid-18th century) by an amount that is 
radiatively equivalent to about a 50% increase in carbon 
dioxide, although carbon dioxide itself has risen by only 
26%, other gases have made up the rest 
The contributions of the various gases to the total 
increase in climate forcing during the 1980s is shown as a 
pie diagram in Figure 7, carbon dioxide is responsible for 
about half the decadal increase (Ozone, the effects ol 
which may be significant, is not included) 
How can we evaluate the effect of different greenhouse 
gases? 
To evaluate possible policy options, it is useful to know the 
relative radiative effect (and, hence, potential climate 
effect) of equal emissions of each of the greenhouse gases 
The concept of relative Global Warming Potentials 
(GWP) has been developed to take into account the 
differing times that gases remain in the atmosphere 
This index defines the time-integrated warming effect 
due to an instantaneous release of unit mass (1 kg) of a 
given greenhouse gas in today's atmosphere, relative to that 
of carbon dioxide The relative importances will change in 
the future as atmospheric composition changes because 
although radiative forcing increases in direct proportion to 
the concentration of CFCs, changes in the other greenhouse 
gases (particularly carbon dioxide) have an el feet on 
forcing which is much less than proportional 
The GWPs in Table 3 are shown for three time horizons 
reflecting the need to consider the cumulative elfects on 
climate over various time scales The longer time horizon is 
appropriate for the cumulative effect the shorter timescale 
will indicate the response to emission changes in the short 
term There are a number of practical difficulties in 
devising and calculating the values of the GWPs and the 
values given here should be considered as preliminary In 
addition to these direct elfects, there are indirect effects of 
human-made emissions arising from chemical reactions 
between the various constituents The indirect effects on 
stratospheric water vapour, carbon dioxide and trop 
osphenc ozone have been included in these estimates 
Table 1 indicates, for example that the effectiveness of 
methane in influencing climate will be greatei in the first

still potentially effective as agents of climate change. One 
example of this, HCFC-22 (with a 15 year lifetime), has a 
similar effect (when released in the same amount) as CFC-
11 on a 20 year time-scale; but less over a 500 year time-
scale. 
Table 3 shows carbon dioxide to be the least effective 
greenhouse gas per kilogramme emitted, but its con-
tribution to global warming, which depends on the product 
of the GWP and the amount emitted, is largest. In the 
example in Table 4, the effect over 100 years of emissions 
of greenhouse gases in 1990 are shown relative to carbon 
dioxide. This is illustrative; to compare the effect of 
different emission projections we have to sum the effect of 
emissions made in future years. 
There are other technical criteria which may help 
policymakers to decide, in the event of emissions red-
uctions being deemed necessary, which gases should be 
considered. Does the gas contribute in a major way to 
current, and future, climate forcing? Does it have a long 
lifetime, so earlier reductions in emissions would be more 
effective than those made later? And are its sources and 
sinks well enough known to decide which could be 
controlled in practice? Table 5 illustrates these factors. 
How much do we expect climate to change? 
It is relatively easy to determine the direct effect of the 
increased radiative forcing due to increases in greenhouse 
gases. However, as climate begins to warm, various 
processes act to amplify (through positive feedbacks) or 
reduce (through negative feedbacks) the warming. The 
main feedbacks which have been identified are due to 
changes in water vapour, sea-ice, clouds and the oceans. 
The best tools we have which take the above feedbacks 
into account (but do not include greenhouse gas feedbacks) 
are three-dimensional mathematical models of the climate 
system (atmospherc-ocean-ice-land), known as General 
Circulation Models (GCMs). They synthesise our 
knowledge of Ihe physical and dynamical processes in the 
overall system and allow for the complex interactions 
between the various components. However, in their current 
state of development, the descriptions of many of the 
processes involved are comparatively crude. Because 
of this, considerable uncertainty is attached to these

predictions of climate change, which is reflected in the 
range of values given, further details are given in a late* 
section 
The estimates of climate change presented here are based 
on 
1) 
the "best-estimate" of equilibrium climate sensitivity 
(1 e the equilibrium temperature change due to a 
doubling of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere) 
obtained from model simulations, feedback analyses 
and observational considerations (see later box 
"What tools do we use9") 
n) 
a "box-diffusion-upwelhng" ocean-atmosphere clim-
ate model which translates the greenhouse forcing 
into the evolution of the temperature response for the 
prescribed climate sensitivity (This simple model has 
been calibrated against more complex atm-osphere-
ocean coupled GCMs for situations where the more 
complex models have been run) 
How quickly will global climate change? 
a If emissions follow a Business-as-U sual pattern 
Under the IPCC Business-as-Usual (Scenario A) emissions 
of greenhouse gases, the average rate of increase of global 
mean temperature during the next century is estimated to be 
about 0 3°C per decade (with an uncertainty range of 0 2°C 
to 0 5°C) This will result in a likely increase in global 
mean temperature of about 1°C above the present value 
(about 2°C above that in the pre-industrial period) by 2025 
and 3°C above today's (about 4°C above pre-industrial) 
before the end of the next century 
The projected temperature rise out to the year 2100, with 
high, low and best-estimate climate responses, is shown in 
Figure 8 Because of other factors which influence climate, 
we would not expect the rise to be a steady one 
The temperature rises shown above are realised temp-
eratures, at any time we would also be committed to a 
further temperature rise toward the equilibrium temperature 
(see box "Equilibrium and Realised Climate Change") For 
the Ball "best-estimate" case in the year 2030, for example, 
a further 0 9°C rise would be expected, about 0 2°C of 
which would be realised by 2050 (in addition to changes 
due to further greenhouse gas increases), the rest would 
become apparent in decades or centuries 
Even if we were able to stabilise emissions of each of the 
greenhouse gases at present day levels from now on, the 
temperature is predicted to rise by about 0 2°C per decade 
for the first few decades 
The global warming will also lead to increased global 
average precipitation and evaporation of a few percent by 
2030 Areas of sea-ice and snow are expected to diminish 
b If emissions at e subjec t to c onti ols 
Under the other IPCC emission scenarios which assume 
progressively increasing levels of controls, average rates of 
increase in global mean temperature over the next century 
are estimated to be about 0 2°C per decade (Scenario B), 
just above 0 1°C per decade (Scenario C) and about 0.1 °C 
per decade (Scenario D) The results are illustrated in 
Figure 9, with the Business-as-Usual case shown for 
comparison Only the best-estimate of the temperature rise 
is shown in each case

rise given above reflects a subjective assessment of 
uncertainties in the calculation of climate response, but

What will be the patterns of climate change by 2030? 
Knowledge of the global mean warming and change in 
precipitation is of limited use in determining the impacts of 
climate change, for instance on agriculture For this we 
need to know changes regionally and seasonally 
Models predict that surface air will warm faster over 
land than over oceans, and a minimum of warming will 
occur around Antarctica and in the northern North Atlantic 
region 
There are some continental-scale changes which are 
consistently predicted by the highest resolution models and 
for which we understand the physical reasons The 
warming is predicted to be 50-100% greater than the global 
mean in high northern latitudes in winter, and substantially 
smaller than the global mean in regions of sea-ice in 
summer Precipitation is predicted to increase on average in 
middle and high latitude continents in winter (by some 5 -
10% over 35-55°N) 
Five regions, each a few million square kilometres in 
area and representative of different chmatological regimes, 
were selected by IPCC for particular study (see Figure 10) 
In the box (over page) are given the changes in 
temperature, precipitation and soil moisture, which are 
predicted to occur by 2030 on the Business-as-Usual 
scenario, as an average over each of the five regions There 
may be considerable variations within the regions In 
general, confidence in these regional estimates is low, 
especially for the changes in precipitation and soil 
moisture, but they are examples of our best estimates We 
cannot yet give reliable regional predictions at the smaller 
scales demanded for impacts assessments 
How will climate extremes and extreme events change? 
Changes in the variability of weather and the frequency of 
extremes will generally have more impact than changes in 
the mean climate at a particular location With the possible 
exception ot an increase in the number ot intense showers 
there is no clear evidence that weather variability will 
change in the future In the case of temperatures, assuming 
no change in variability, but with a modest increase in the 
mean, the number ot days with temperatures above a given 
value at the high end of the distribution will increase 
substantially On the same assumptions, there will be a 
decrease in days with temperatures at the low end ot the 
distribution So the number of very hot days or frosty 
nights can be substantially changed without any change in 
the variability of the weather The number of days with a 
minimum threshold amount of soil moisture (for viability 
of a certain crop, for example) would be even more 
sensitive to changes in average precipitation and 
evaporation 
If the large-scale weather regimes, for instance 
depression tracks or anticyclones, shift their position this 
would effect the vai lability and extremes of weather at a 
particular location, and could have a major effect 
However, we do not know if, or in what way, this will 
happen

ESTIMATES FOR CHANGES BY 2030 
(IPCC Business-as-Usual scenario; changes from pre-industrial) 
The numbers given below are based on high resolution models, scaled to be consistent with our best estimate of 
global mean warming of 1.8°C by 2030. For values consistent with other estimates of global temperature rise, the 
numbers below should be reduced by 30% for the low estimate or increased by 50% for the high estimate. 
Precipitation estimates are also scaled in a similar way. 
Confidence in these regional estimates is low 
Central North America (35 '-50 W 85 °-105 °W) 
The warming varies from 2 to 4°C in winter and 2 to 3°C in summer. Precipitation increases range from 0 to 15% 
in winter whereas there are decreases of 5 to 10% in summer. Soil moisture decreases in summer by 15 to 20%. 
Southern Asia (5 °-30 W 70 °-105 °E) 
The warming varies from 1 to 2°C throughout the year. Precipitation changes little in winter and generally increases 
throughout the region by 5 to 15% in summer. Summer soil moisture increases by 5 to 10%. 
Sahel (10 °-20 °N 20 °W-40 °E) 
The warming ranges from 1 to 3°C. Area mean precipitation increases and area mean soil moisture decreases 
marginally in summer. However, throughout the region, there are areas of both increase and decrease in both 
parameters throughout the region. 
Southern Europe (35°-50°N 10°W- 45°E) 
The warming is about 2°C in winter and varies from 2 to 3°C in summer. There is some indication of increased 
precipitation in winter, but summer precipitation decreases by 5 to 15%, and summer soil moisture by 15 to 25%. 
Australia (12°-45°S 110°-115°E) 
The warming ranges from 1 to 2°C in summer and is about 2°C in winter. Summer precipitation increases by 
around 10%, but the models do not produce consistent estimates of the changes in soil moisture. The area averages 
hide large variations at the sub-continental level.

WHAT TOOLS DO WE USE TO PREDICT FUTURE CLIMATE, AND HOW DO WE USE THEM? 
The most highly developed tool which we have to predict future climate is known as a general circulation model 
or GCM. These models are based on the laws of physics and use descriptions in simplified physical terms (called 
parameterisations) of the smaller-scale processes such as those due to clouds and deep mixing in the ocean. In a 
climate model an atmospheric component, essentially the same as a weather prediction model, is coupled to a 
model of the ocean, which can be equally complex. 
Climate forecasts are derived in a different way from weather forecasts. A weather prediction model gives a des-
cription of the atmosphere's state up to 10 days or so ahead, starting from a detailed description of an initial state 
of the atmosphere at a given time. Such forecasts describe the movement and development of large weather systems, 
though they cannot represent very small scale phenomena; for example, individual shower clouds. 
To make a climate forecast, the climate model is first run for a few (simulated) decades. The statistics of the 
model's output is a description of the model's simulated climate which, if the model is a good one, will bear a 
close resemblance to the climate of the real atmosphere and ocean. The above exercise is then repeated with 
increasing concentrations of the greenhouse gases in the model. The differences between the statistics of the two 
simulations (for example in mean temperature and interannual variability) provide an estimate of the accompany-
ing climate change. 
The long term change in surface air temperature following a doubling of carbon dioxide (referred to as the 
climate sensitivity) is generally used as a benchmark to compare models. The range of results from model studies 
is 1.9 to 5.2°C. Most results are close to 4.0°C but recent studies using a more detailed but not necessarily more 
accurate representation of cloud processes give results in the lower half of this range. Hence the models results do 
not justify altering the previously accepted range of 1.5 to 4.5°C. 
Although scientists are reluctant to give a single best estimate in this range, it is necessary for the presentation of 
climate predictions for a choice of best estimate to be made. Taking into account the model results, together with 
observational evidence over the last century which is suggestive of the climate sensitivity being in the lower half of 
the range, (see section: "Has man already begun to change global climate?") a value of climate sensitivity of 2.5°C 
has been chosen as the best estimate. Further details are given in Section 5 of the report. 
In this Assessment, we have also used much simpler models, which simulate the behaviour of GCMs, to make 
predictions of the evolution with time of global temperature from a number of emission scenarios. These so-called 
box-diffusion models contain highly simplified physics but give similar results to GCMs when globally averaged. 
A completely different, and potentially useful, way of predicting patterns of future climate is to search for periods 
in the past when the global mean temperatures were similar to those we expect in future, and then use the past 
spatial patterns as analogues of those which will arise in the future. For a good analogue, it is also necessary for 
the forcing factors (for example, greenhouse gases, orbital variations) and other conditions (for example, ice cover, 
topography, etc.) to be similar; direct comparisons with climate situations for which these conditions do not apply 
cannot be easily interpreted. Analogues of future greenhouse-gas-changed climates have not been found. 
We cannot therefore advocate the use of palaeo-climates as predictions of regional climate change due to future 
increases in greenhouse gases. However, palaeo-climatological information can provide useful insights into clim-
ate processes, and can assist in the validation of climate models. 
Will storms increase in a warmer world? 
Storms can have a major impact on society. Will their 
frequency, intensity or location increase in a warmer 
world? 
Tropical storms, such as typhoons and hurricanes, only 
develop at present over seas that are warmer than about 
26°C. Although the area of sea having temperatures over 
this critical value will increase as the globe warms, the 
critical temperature itself may increase in a warmer world. 
Although the theoretical maximum intensity is expected to 
increase with temperature, climate models give no con-
sistent indication whether tropical storms will increase or 
decrease in frequency or intensity as climate changes; 
neither is there any evidence that this has occurred over the 
past few decades. 
Mid-latitude storms, such as those which track across 
the North Atlantic and North Pacific, are driven by the 
equator-to-pole temperature contrast. As this contrast will

EQUILIBRIUM AND REALISED CLIMATE CHANGE 
When the radiative forcing on the earth-atmosphere system is changed, for example by increasing greenhouse gas 
concentrations, the atmosphere will try to respond (b> wanning) immediately But the atmosphere is closely 
coupled to the oceans, so in order tor the air to be wanned by the greenhouse el feet, the oceans also have to be 
warmed, because of their thermal capacity this takes decades or centuries This exchange of heat between atmos-
phere and ocean will act to slow down the temperature rise forced by the gieenhouse effect 
In a hypothetical example where the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, following a period of 
constancy, rises suddenly to a new level and remains there, the radiative forcing would also rise rapidly to a new 
level This increased radiative forcing would cause the atmosphere and oceans to warm, and eventually come to 
a new, stable, temperature A commitment to this equilibrium temperature rise is incurred as soon as the green-
house gas concentration changes But at any time before equilibrium is reached, the actual temperature will have 
risen by only part of the equilibrium temperature change, known as the realised temperature change 
Models predict that, for the present day case of an increase in radiative forcing which is approximately steady, the 
realised temperature rise at any time is about 50% of the committed temperature rise if the climate sensitivity (the 
response to a doubling of carbon dioxide) is 4 5°C and about 80% if the climate sensitivity is 1 5°C If the forcing 
were then held constant, temperatures would continue to rise slowly, but it is not certain whether it would take 
decades or centuries for most of the remaining rise to equilibrium to occur

probably be weakened in a warmer world (at least in the 
Northern Hemisphere), it might be argued that mid-latitude 
storms will also weaken or change their tracks, and there is 
some indication of a general reduction in day-to-day 
variability in the mid-latitude storm tracks in winter in 
model simulations, though the pattern of changes vary from 
model to model Present models do not resolve smaller-
scale disturbances, so it will not be possible to assess 
changes in storminess until results from higher resolution 
models become available in the next few years 
Climate change in the longer term 
The foregoing calculations have focussed on the period up 
to the year 2100, it is clearly more difficult to make 
calculations for years beyond 2100 However, while the 
timing of a predicted increase in global temperatures has 
Pohcymakeis Summaiy 
\\\u 
substantial uncertainties, the prediction that an increase will 
eventually occur is more certain Furthermore, some model 
calculations that have been extended beyond 100 years 
suggest that, with continued increases in greenhouse 
climate forcing, there could be significant changes in the 
ocean circulation, including a decrease in North Atlantic 
deep water formation 
Other factors which could influence future climate 
Variations in the output of solar energy may also affect 
climate On a decadal time-scale solar variability and 
changes in greenhouse gas concentration could give 
changes of similar magnitudes However the variation in 
solar intensity changes sign so that over longer time-scales 
the increases in greenhouse gases are likely to be more 
important Aerosols as a result of volcanic eruptions can 
lead to a cooling at the surface which may oppose the 
greenhouse warming for a few years following an eruption 
Again, over longer periods the greenhouse warming is 
likely to dominate 
Human activity is leading to an increase in aerosols in 
the lower atmosphere, mainly from sulphur emissions 
These have two effects, both of which are difficult to 
quantify but which may be significant particularly at the 
regional level The first is the direct effect of the aerosols 
on the radiation scattered and absorbed by the atmosphere 
The second is an indirect effect whereby the aerosols affect 
the microphysics of clouds leading to an increased cloud 
reflectivity Both these effects might lead to a significant 
regional cooling, a decrease in emissions of sulphur might 
be expected to increase global temperatures 
Because of long-period couplings between different 
components of the climate system, for example between 
ocean and atmosphere, the Earth's climate would still vary 
without being perturbed by any external influences This 
natural variability could act to add to, or subtract from, 
any human-made warming, on a century time-scale this 
would be less than changes expected from greenhouse gas 
increases 
How much confidence do we have in our predictions? 
Uncertainties in the above climate predictions arise from 
our imperfect knowledge of 
future rates of human-made emissions 
• 
how these will change the atmospheric con-
centrations of greenhouse gases 
the response of climate to these changed con-
centrations 
Firstly, it is obvious that the extent to which climate will 
change depends on the rate at which greenhouse gases (and 
other gases which affect their concentrations) are emitted 
This in turn will be determined by various complex 
economic and sociological factors Scenarios of future 
emissions were generated within IPCC WGIII and are 
described in the Annex to this Summary 
Secondly, because we do not fully understand the 
sources and sinks of the greenhouse gases, there are 
uncertainties in our calculations of future concentrations 
arising from a given emissions scenario We have used a 
number of models to calculate concentrations and chosen a 
best estimate for each gas In the case of carbon dioxide, 
for example, the concentration increase between 1990 and 
2070 due to the Business-as-Usual emissions scenario 
spanned almost a factor of two between the highest and 
lowest model result (corresponding to a range in radiative 
forcing change of about 50%) 
Furthermore, because natural sources and sinks of 
greenhouse gases are sensitive to a change in climate, they 
may substantially modify future concentrations (see earlier 
section "Greenhouse gas feedbacks") It appears that, as 
climate warms, these feedbacks will lead to an overall 
increase, rather than decrease, in natural greenhouse gas 
abundances For this reason, climate change is likely to be 
greater than the estimates we have given 
Thirdly, climate models are only as good as our 
understanding of the processes which they describe, and 
this is far from perfect 
The ranges in the climate 
predictions given above reflect the uncertainties due to 
model imperfections, the largest of these is cloud feedback 
(those factors affecting the cloud amount and distribution 
and the interaction of clouds with solar and terrestrial 
radiation), which leads to a factor of two uncertainty in the 
size of the warming Others arise from the transfer of 
energy between the atmosphere and ocean, the atmosphere 
and land surfaces, and between the upper and deep layers 
of the ocean The treatment of sea-ice and convection in the 
models is also crude Nevertheless, for reasons given in the 
box overleaf, we have substantial confidence that models 
can predict at least the broad scale features of climate 
change 
Furthermore, we must recognise that our imperfect 
understanding of climate processes (and corresponding 
ability to model them) could make us vulnerable to 
surprises, just as the human made ozone hole over 
Antarctica was entirely unpredicted In particular, the ocean 
circulation, changes in which are thought to have led to 
periods of comparatively rapid climate change at the end of 
the last ice age, is not well observed, understood or 
modelled 
Will the climate of the future be very different? 
When considering future climate change, it is clearly 
essential to look at the record of climate variation in the 
past From it we can learn about the range of natural 
climate variability, to see how it compares with what we

CONFIDENCE IN PREDICTIONS FROM CLIMATE MODELS 
What confidence can we have that climate change due to increasing greenhouse gases will look anything like the 
model predictions7 Weather forecasts can be compared with the actual weather the next day and their skill ass-
essed, we cannot do that with climate predictions However, there are several indicators that give us some conf-
idence in the predictions from climate models 
When the latest atmospheric models are run with the present atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and 
observed boundary conditions their simulation of present climate is generally realistic on large scales, capturing 
the major features such as the wet tropical convergence zones and mid-latitude depression belts, as well as the con-
trasts between summer and winter circulations The models also simulate the observed variability, for example, the 
large day-to-day pressure variations in the middle latitude depression belts and the maxima in interannual variab-
ility responsible for the very different character of one winter from another both being represented However, on 
regional scales (2,000km or less), there are significant errors in all models 
Overall confidence is increased by atmospheric models' generally satisfactory portrayal of aspects of variability of 
the atmosphere, for instance those associated with variations in sea surface temperature There has been some suc-
cess in simulating the general circulation of the ocean, including the patterns (though not always the intensities) of 
the principal currents, and the distributions of tracers added to the ocean 
Atmospheric models have been coupled with simple models of the ocean to predict the equilibrium response to 
greenhouse gases, under the assumption that the model errors are the same in a changed climate The ability of 
such models to simulate important aspects of the climate of the last ice age generates confidence in their usefulness 
Atmospheric models have also been coupled with multi-layer ocean models (to give coupled ocean-atmosphere 
GCMs) which predict the gradual response to increasing greenhouse gases Although the models so far are of rela-
tively coarse resolution, the large scale structures of the ocean and the atmosphere can be simulated with some 
skill However, the coupling of ocean and atmosphere models reveals a strong sensitivity to small-scale errors 
which leads to a drift away from the observed climate As yet, these errors must be removed by adjustments to the 
exchange of heat between ocean and atmosphere There are similarities between results from the coupled models 
using simple representations of the ocean and those using more sophisticated descriptions, and our understanding 
of such differences as do occur gives us some confidence in the results 
expect in the future, and also look for evidence of recent 
climate change due to man's activities 
Climate varies naturally on all time-scales from hundreds 
of millions of years down to the year-to-year Prominent in 
the Earth's history have been the 100,000 year glacial-
mterglacial cycles when climate was mostly cooler than at 
present Global surface temperatures have typically varied 
by 5-7°C through these cycles, with large changes in ice 
volume and sea level, and temperature changes as great as 
10-15°C in some middle and high latitude regions of the 
Northern Hemisphere Since the end of the last ice age, 
about 10,000 years ago, global surface temperatures have 
probably fluctuated by little more than 1°C Some 
fluctuations have lasted several centuries, including the 
Little Ice Age which ended in the nineteenth century and 
which appears to have been global in extent 
The changes predicted to occur by about the middle of 
the next century due to increases in greenhouse gas 
concentrations from the Business-as-Usual emissions will 
make global mean temperatures higher than they have been 
in the last 1 ^0.000 years 
The rate of change of global temperatures predicted for 
Business-as-Usual emissions will be greater than those 
which have occured naturally on Earth over the last 10,000 
years, and the rise in sea level will be about three to six 
times faster than that seen over the last 100 years or so 
Has man already begun to change the global climate? 
The instrumental record of surface temperature is 
fragmentary until the mid-nineteenth century, after which it 
slowly improves 
Because of different methods of 
measurement, historical records have to be harmonised 
with modern observations, introducing some uncertainty 
Despite these problems we believe that a real warming of 
the globe of 0 3°C - 0 6°C has taken place over the last 
century, any bias due to urbanisation is likely to be less 
than 0 05°C 
Moreover since 1900 similar temperature increases are 
seen in three independent data sets one collected over land 
and two over the oceans Figure 11 shows current estimates 
of smoothed global-mean surface temperature over land 
and ocean since 1860 Confidence in the record has been 
increased 
by their similarity to recent 
satellite 
measurements of mid-troposphenc temperatures

Although the overall temperature rise has been broadly 
similar in both hemispheres, it has not been steady, and 
differences in their rates of warming have sometimes 
persisted for decades Much of the warming since 1900 has 
been concentrated in two penods, the fust between about 
1910 and 1940 and the othei since 1975 the five warmest 
years on iecord have all been in the 1980s The Northern 
Hemisphere cooled between the 1940s and the early 1970s 
when Southern Hemispheie tempeiatuies stayed nearly 
constant The pattern ol global warming since 1975 has 
been uneven with some legions mainly in the noithein 
hemisphere continuing to cool until iecentl) This icgional 
diversity indicates that lutuie icgional tempeiatuie changes 
arc likely to dillcr consideiabl) from a global aveiage 
The conclusion that global tempeiatuie has been using is 
stiongly supported by the ictieat ol most mountain 
glaciers ol the woild since the end ol the nineteenth 
centuiy and the fact that global sea level has nsen over the 
same penod by an aveiage ol I to 2mm pei \eai Estimates 
ol thermal expansion ol the oceans and of increased 
melting of mountain glacieis and the ice margin in West 
Gieenland over the last centuiy show that the ma]oi pait of 
the sea level rise appears to be ielatcd to the observed 
global warming 
This appaient connection between 
observed sea level rise and global wanning piovides 
grounds lor believing that lutuie warming will lead to an 
acceleration in sea level rise 
The size of the warming ovei the last centuiy is bioadly 
consistent with the piedictions ol climate models but is 
also ol the same magnitude as natuidl climate vailability

made gieenhouse effect, then the implied climate 
sensitivity would be ncai the lowei end ol the uinge 
mleiicd liom the models The obscivcd inciedse could be 
largely due to natural variability, alternatively this 
variability and other man-made factors could have offset a 
still larger man-made greenhouse warming 
The 
unequivocal detection of the enhanced greenhouse effect 
from observations is not likely lor a decade or more, when 
the committment to future climate change will then be 
considerably larger than it is today

uncertainty range of 3 - 10cm per decade) The predicted

65cm by the end of the next century There will be

positive contributions from thermal expansion of the 
oceans and the melting of glaciers Although, over the next 
100 years, the effect of the Antarctic and Greenland ice 
sheets is expected to be small they make a major 
contribution to the uncertainty in predictions 
Even ll gieenhouse foicing increased no lurther, there 
would still be a commitment to a continuing sea level rise 
loi many decades and even centuries due to delays in 
climate ocean and ice mass lesponses As an illustration if 
the incieases in greenhouse gas concentrations were to 
suddenly stop in 2030, sea level would go on using from 
2030 to 2100 by as much again as horn 1990-2030, as 
shown in Figuie 13

The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is of special concern A 
laigc portion of it containing an amount of ice equivalent 
to about 5m ol global sea level, is grounded far below sea 
level There have been suggestions that a sudden outflow of 
ice might result horn global warming and raise sea level 
quickl) and substantially Recent studies have shown that 
individual ice streams arc changing lapidiy on a decade to 
centuiy time-scale however this is not neccssanly related 
to climate change Within the next centuiy it is not likely 
that there will be a major outflow of ice from West 
Antarctica due directly to global warming 
Any rise in sea level is not expected to be uniform over 
the globe Thermal expansion, changes in ocean circ-
ulation, and surface air pressure will vary from region to 
region as the world warms, but in an as yet unknown way 
Such regional details await further development of more 
leahstic coupled ocean-atmosphere models In addition, 
vertical land movements can be as large or even larger than 
changes in global mean sea level these movements have to 
be taken into account when predicting local change in sea 
level ielative to land 
The most severe effects of sea level rise are likely to 
result horn extreme events (loi example, storm surges) the 
incidence of which may be allected by climatic change 
What will be the effect of climate change on 
ecosystems? 
Ecosystem piocesscs such as photosynthesis and res-
piration are dependent on climatic lactors and carbon 
dioxide concentration in the short term In the longer term, 
climate and carbon dioxide are among the factors which 
control ecosystem structure, I e , species composition, 
either directly by increasing mortality in poorly adapted 
species, or indirectly by mediating the competition between 
species Ecosystems will respond to local changes in 
temperature (including its rate of change), precipitation, 
soil moisture and extieme events Current models are 
unable to make lehable estimates ol changes in these 
parameters on the required local scales

Photosynthesis captures atmospheric carbon dioxide, 
water and solar energy and stores them in organic 
compounds which are then used for subsequent plant 
growth, the growth of animals or the growth of microbes in 
the soil All of these organisms release carbon dioxide via 
respiration into the atmosphere Most land plants have a 
system of photosynthesis which will respond positively to 
increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (' the carbon dioxide 
fertilization effect') but the iesponse vanes with species 
The effect may decrease with tune when rcstncted by othei 
ecological limitations, foi example nutrient availability It 
should be emphasized that the caibon content ol the 
terrestnal biospheie will inciease only it the toiest 
ecosystems in a state ol maturity will be able to store more 
carbon in a warmer climate and at highei concentrations ol 
caibon dioxide Wc do not yet know if this is the case 
The response to increased carbon dioxide results in 
greater elliciencics of water, light and nitrogen use These 
increased efficiencies may be particularly important during 
drought and in and/semi-and and infertile areas 
Because species respond diiferently to climatic change 
some will increase in abundance and/or range while others 
will decrease Ecosystems will therefore change in structure 
and composition Some species may be displaced to higher 
latitudes and altitudes, and may be more prone to local and 
possibly even global extinction other species may thrive 
As stated above ecosystem structure and species 
distribution are particulaily sensitive to the iate ol change 
of climate We can deduce something about how quickly 
global temperature has changed in the past horn palaeo 
climatological records As an example at the end of the last 
glaciation, within about a century, tempeiaturc increased by 
up to VC in the North Atlantic region, mainly in Western 
Europe Although during the increase from the glacial to 
the current interglacial temperature simple tundia 
ecosystems responded positively a similar rapid temp-
erature inciease applied to more developed ecosystems 
could result in their instability 
What should be done to reduce uncertainties, and how 
long will this take? 
Although we can say that some climate change is 
unavoidable, much uncertainty exists in the prediction of 
global climate properties such as the temperature and 
rainfall Even greater uncertainty exists in predictions of 
regional climate change, and the subsequent consequences 
for sea level and ecosystems The key areas of scientific 
uncertainty are 
• 
clouds: primarily cloud formation dissipation and 
radiative properties which influence the response ol 
the atmosphere to gieenhousc forcing 
oceans: the exchange ot energy between the ocean 
and the atmosphere, between the upper layers ol the 
ocean and the deep ocean, and transpoit within the 
ocean, all of which control the rate ol global climate 
change and the patterns of regional change, 
• 
greenhouse gases: quantification of the uptake and 
release of the greenhouse gases, their chemical 
reactions in the atmosphere, and how these may be 
influenced by climate change, 
• 
polar ice sheets: which affect predictions of sea level 
use

DEFORESTATION AND REFORESTATION 
Man has been deforesting the Eaith loi millennia Until the early pait of the century, this was mainly in temperate 
legions moie recently it has been concentrated in the tiopics Deforestation has several potential impacts on clim-
ate through the carbon and nitrogen cycles (where it can lead to changes in atmosphenc caibon dioxide concent-
idtions) through the change in reflectivity of tenain when forests are cleared, through its effect on the hydrological 
c\cle (precipitation, evaporation and runoff) and surface roughness and thus atmospheric circulation which can 
produce remote effects on climate 
It is estimated that each year about 2 Gt ot carbon (GtC) is released to the atmosphere due to tropical deforestation 
The rate of forest clearing is difficult to estimate, probably until the mid-20th century, temperate deforestation and the 
loss of organic matter from soils was a more important contributor to atmospheric carbon dioxide than was the 
burning ot fossil fuels Since then fossil fuels have become dominant one estimate is that around 1980, 1 6 GtC 
was being released annually from the clearing of tropical forests compared with about 5 GtC from the burning of 
lossil fuels If all the tropical forests were removed the input is vanously estimated at from 150 to 240 GtC, this 
would increase atmospheric caibon dioxide by 35 to 60 ppmv 
To analyse the effect ot reforestation we assume that 10 million hectares ot forests are planted each year for a per-
iod of 40 years, I e , 4 million km1 would then have been planted by 2010 at which time 1 GtC would be absorbed 
annually until these forests ieach maturity This would happen in 40-100 yeais lor most foicsts The above scenario 
implies an accumulated uptake of about 20 GtC by the yeai 2030 and up to 80 GtC after 100 years This accumul-
ation of carbon in forests is equivalent to some 5-10% of the emission due to fossil fuel burning in the Business-
as Usual scenario 
Deforestation can also alter climate directly by increasing leflectivit) and decreasing evapotranspiration Experim-
ents with climate models predict that replacing all the forests ot the Amazon Basin by grassland would reduce the 
rainfall over the basin by about 20% and increase mean temperature by several degrees 
To teduce the current scientific uncertainties in each of 
these areas will require internationally coordinated 
rescaich, the goal of which is to improve our capability to 
observe, model and understand the global climate system 
Such a program of research will reduce the scientific 
uncertainties and assist in the formulation of sound national 
and international response strategies 
Systematic long term observations ot the system are of 
vital importance for understanding the natural variability of 
the Eaiths climate system detecting whether mans 
activities are changing it parametensing ke> processes for 
models and verifying model simulations 
Increased 
accuiacy and coverage in many observations are lequired

utilization of data The main observational requirements 
are

Understanding of the climate system will be developed 
from analyses of observations and of the results from 
model simulations 
In addition, detailed studies of 
particular processes will be iequired through targetted 
observational campaigns 
Examples of such field 
campaigns include combined observational and small-scale 
modelling studies for different legions, of the formation, 
dissipation, radiative, dynamical and microphysical 
properties of clouds, and ground-based (ocean and land) 
and aircraft measurements of the fluxes of greenhouse 
gases from specific ecosystems In paiticular, emphasis 
must be placed on field experiments that will assist in the 
development and improvement of sub grid-scale 
parametrizations for models 
The required program of research will require 
unprecedented international cooperation, with the World 
Climate Research Programme (WCRP) of the World 
Meteorological Organization and International Council of 
Scientific Unions (ICSU) and the International Geosphere-
Biosphere Programme (IGBP) of ICSU both playing vital 
roles These are large and complex endeavours that will 
require the involvement ot all nations particularly the 
developing countries Implementation of existing and 
planned projects will require increased financial and human 
resources, the latter requirement 
has 
immediate 
implications at all levels of education, and the international 
community of scientists needs to be widened to include 
more members from developing countries 
The WCRP and IGBP have a number of ongoing or 
planned research programmes, that address each of the 
three key areas of scientific uncertainty Examples include

As research advances, increased understanding and 
improved observations will lead to progressively more 
reliable climate predictions However considering the 
complex nature of the problem and the scale of the 
scientific programmes to be undertaken we know that rapid 
results cannot be expected Indeed fuither scientific 
advances may expose unforeseen problems and areas of

EMISSIONS SCENARIOS FROM WORKING GROUP III OF THE 
INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE 
The Steering Group of the Response Strategics Working 
Group requested the USA and the Netherlands to develop 
emissions scenarios for evaluation by the IPCC Working 
Group I The scenarios cover the emissions of carbon 
dioxide I C O T ) 
methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), 
^hlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), carbon monoxide (CO) and 
nitrogen oxides (NO x) from the present up to the year 
2100 Growth ot the economy and population was taken 
Loramon tor all scenarios Population was assumed to 
approach 10 5 billion in the second half ot the next century 
Economic growth was assumed to be 2-VA annually in the 
coming decade in the OECD countries and 1 5 % in the 
Eastern European and developing countries The economic 
growth levels were assumed to deciease thereafter In order 
to reach the required targets, levels of technological 
development and environmental controls were varied 
In the Business-as-Usual scenario (Scenario A) the 
energv supply is coal intensive and on the demand side 
only modest efficiency increases are achieved 
Carbon 
monoxide controls are modest, deforestation continues until 
the tropical forests are depleted and agricultural emissions 
ot methane and nitrous oxide are uncontrolled 
For CFCs 
the Montreal Protocol is implemented albeit with only 
partial participation Note that the aggregation of national 
projections by IPCC Working Group III gives higher 
emissions (10 
20%) of carbon dioxide and methane by 
202^ 
In Scenario B the energy supply mix shifts towards 
lower carbon fuels, notably natural gas Large efficiency 
increases are achieved 
Carbon monoxide controls are 
stringent, deforestation is reversed and the Montreal 
Protocol implemented with lull paiticipation 
In Scenario C a shift towards renewables and nuclear 
energy takes place in the second half of next century CFCs 
are now phased out and agricultural emissions limited 
For Scenario D a shift to renewables and nuclear in the 
first halt of the next century reduces the emissions of 
carbon dioxide, initially more or less stabilizing emissions 
in the industrialized countries The scenario shows that 
stringent controls in industrialized countries combined with 
moderated growth of emissions in developing countries 
could stabilize atmospheric concentrations Carbon dioxide 
emissions are reduced to 50% of 1985 levels by the middle 
of the next century

Introduction 
Purpose of the Report 
The purpose of this report is to provide a scientific 
assessment of: 
1. 
the factors which may affect climate change during 
the next century, especially those which are due to 
human activity; 
2. 
the responses of the atmosphere-ocean-land-ice 
system to those factors; 
3. 
the current ability to model global and regional 
climate changes and their predictability; 
4. 
the past climate record and presently observed 
climate anomalies. 
On the basis of this assessment, the report presents 
current knowledge regarding predictions of climate change 
(including sea-level rise and the effect on ecosystems) over 
the next century, the timing of changes together with an 
assessment of the uncertainties associated with these 
predictions. 
This introduction provides some of the basic scientific 
ideas concerned with climate change, and gives an outline 
of the structure of the report. 
The Climate System 
A simple definition of climate is the average weather. A 
description of the climate over a period (which may 
typically be from a few years to a few centuries) involves 
the averages of appropriate components of the weather over 
that period, together with the statistical variations of those 
components.

atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous 
oxide were much lower during the ice ages than during 
interglacial periods It is likely that changes in greenhouse 
gas concentrations contributed, in part, to the large (4 -
5°C) temperature swings between ice ages and interglacial 
periods 
The Enhanced Greenhouse Effect 
An increase in concentrations of greenhouse gases is 
expected to raise the global-mean surface-air temperature 
which, for simplicity, is usually relerred to as the global 
temperature' Strictly this is an enhmu ed greenhouse 
effect - above that occurring due to natural greenhouse gas 
concentrations The word enhanced is frequently omitted, 
but should not be forgotten in this context 
Changes in the Abundances of the Greenhouse Gases 
We know, with certainty, that the concentrations of 
naturally occurring greenhouse gases in the atmosphere 
have varied on palaeo time-scales For a thousand years 
prior to the industrial ievolution the abundances of these 
gases were relatively constant However as the world s 
population increased, emissions of greenhouse gases such 
as carbon dioxide, methane, chlorofluorocarbons, nitrous 
oxide, and troposphenc ozone have increased substantially 
due to industrialisation and changes in agriculture and land-
use Carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide all have 
significant natural and man-made sources, while the 
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are recent man-made gases 
Section 1 of the report summanses our knowledge ot the 
various greenhouse gases, then sources, sinks and 
lifetimes, and their likely rate of inciease 
Relative Importance of Greenhouse Gases 
So far as radiative forcing of the climate is concerned, the 
increase in carbon dioxide has been the most important 
(contributing about 60% of the increased forcing over the 
last 200 years), methane is of next importance contributing 
about 20%, chloroflourocarbons contribute about 10% and 
all the other gases the remaining 10% Section 2 of the 
report reviews the contributions of the different gases to 
radiative forcing in more detail 
Feedbacks 
If everything else in the climate system remained the same 
following an increase in greenhouse gases, it would be 
relatively easy to calculate, from a knowledge of their 
radiative properties, what the increase in average global 
temperature would be However, as the components of the 
system begin to warm, other factors come into play which 
are called feedbacks These factors can act to amplify the 
initial wanning (positive feedbacks) oi reduce it (negative 
feedbacks) Negative feedbacks can reduce the warming 
but cannot produce a global cooling The simplest of these 
feedbacks arises because as the atmosphere warms the 
amount ol water vapoui it holds increases Watei vapoui is 
an important giccnhouse gas and will thereloie amphf) the 
warming Other feedbacks occur through interactions with 
snow and sea-ice, with clouds and with the biosphere 
Section 3 explores these more fully 
The Role of the Oceans 
The oceans play a central role in shaping the climate 
lluough thiee distinct mechanisms Firstly they absorb 
carbon dioxide and exchange it with the atmosphere 
(Section 1 addresses this aspect of the carbon cycle) 
Secondly, they exchange heat 
water vapour and 
\ WW// 
Inti oduc twn 
momentum with the atmosphere Wind stress at the sea 
surface drives the large-scale ocean circulation Watei 
vapour, evaporated from the ocean surface, is transported 
by the atmospheric circulation and provides latent heat 
energy to the atmosphere The ocean circulations in their 
turn redistribute heat, tresh water and dissolved chemicals 
around the globe Thirdly, they sequester heat, absorbed at 
the surface, in the deepest regions for periods of a thousand 
years or more through vertical circulation and convective 
mixing 
Therefore, any study of the climate and how it might 
change must include a detailed description of processes in 
the ocean together with the coupling between the ocean and 
the atmosphere A description of ocean processes is 
presented in Section 3 and the results from ocean 
atmospheie coupled models appear in Section 6 
Climate Forecasting 
To carry out a climate forecast it is necessary to take into 
account all the complex interactions and feedbacks 
between the different components of the climate system 
This is done through the use of a numerical model which 
as far as possible includes a description of all the processes 
and interactions Such a model is a more elaborate version 
of the global models currently employed for weather 
forecasting 
Global forecasting models concentrate on the circulation 
ol the atmosphere (for that reason they are often called 
atmospheric general circulation models (or atmospheric 
GCMs) They are based on equations describing the 
atmosphere s basic dynamics, and include descriptions in 
simple physical terms (called parametenzations) of the 
physical processes Forecasts are made for several days 
ahead from an analysis derived from weather observations 
Such forecasts are called deterministic weather forecasts 
because the> describe the detailed weather to be expected 
at any place and time on the synoptic scale (of the order of 
a tew hundred kilometres) They cannot of course, be 
deterministic so tar as small scale phenomena, such as 
individual showei clouds are concerned 
The most elaborate climate model employed at the 
present time consists ot an atmospheric GCM coupled to an 
ocean GCM which describes the structure and dynamics of 
the ocean Added to this coupled model are appropriate 
descriptions although necessarily somewhat crude, of the 
other components ot the climate system (namely, the land 
sin face and the ice) and the mtei actions between them If 
the model is run for seveial >ears with parameters and 
forcing appiopnate to the current climate the models 
output should beai a close resemblance to the observed 
climate 
II parameters repiesenting 
say 
increasing 
gieenhouse gases are introduced into the model it can be 
used to simulate or pi edict the resulting climate change 
To run models such as these requires very large 
computer resources indeed However, simplified models 
are also employed to explore the various sensitivities of the 
climate system and to make simulations of the time 
evolution of climate change In particular, simplifications 
of the ocean structure and dynamics are included, details 
are given in Section 3 Section 4 describes how well the 
various models simulate current climate and also how well 
they have been able to make reconstructions of past 
climates 
Equilibrium and Time-Dependent Response 
The simplest way of employing a climate model to 
determine the response to a change in forcing due to 
increases in greenhouse gases is to first run the model for 
several years with the current forcing, then to change the 
forcing (for instance by doubling the concentration of 
carbon dioxide in the appropriate part of the model) and 
run the model again Comparing the two model climates 
will then provide a forecast ol the change in climate to be 
expected under the new conditions Such a forecast will be 
of the equilibrium response, it is the response expected to 
that change when the whole climate system has reached a 
steady state Most climate forecasting models to date have 
been run in this equilibrium response mode Section 5 
summarises the results obtained from such models 
A more complicated and difficult calculation can be 
carried out by changing the forcing in the model slowly on 
the appropriate natural time-scale Again, comparison with 
the unperturbed model climate is carried out to obtain the 
time-dependent response of the model to climate change 
These time-dependent models, results from which are 
presented in Section 6, are the ones which describe the 
climate system most realistically However, rather few of 
them have been run so far Comparison of the magnitude 
and patterns of climate change as predicted by these 
models has been made with results from models run in the 
equilibrium response mode The results of this comparison 
provide guidance on how to interpret some of the more 
detailed results from the equilibrium model runs 
Detection of Climate Change 
Of central importance to the study of climate and climate 
change are observations of climate From the distant past 
we have palaeo-chmatic data which provide information on 
the response of the climate system to different historical 
lorcings Section 4 describes how climate models can be 
validated in these differing climate regimes It is only 
within about the last hundred years, however, that accurate 
observations with good global coverage exist Even so, 
there have been numerous changes in instruments and 
observational practices during this period, and quite 
Inti oduttion 
\\\i\ 
sophisticated numerical corrections are required to 
standardize the data to a self consistent record 
Section 7 discusses these issues and provides evidence, 
from land and sea temperature records and glacier 
measurements, that a small global warming has occurred 
since the late nineteenth century The temperature and 
precipitation records are examined regionally as well, and 
recent data on sea-ice and snow cover are shown 
Within these time-series of data we can examine the 
natural variability of climate and search for a possible 
climate change signal due to increasing greenhouse gases 
Section 8 compares the expectations from model 
predictions with the observed change in climate At a 
global level the change is consistent with predictions from 
models but there may be other effects producing it 
Problems arise at a regional level because there are 
differences between the various predictions and because 
the changes observed so far are small and comparable to 
spatial and temporal noise In this Section, however, an 
estimate is made of the likely time-scale for detection of 
the enhanced greenhouse effect 
Changes in Sea Level 
An important consequence of a rise in global temperature 
would be an increase in sea level Section 9 assesses the 
contribution from thermal expansion of the oceans, melting 
of mountain glaciers and changes to the Greenland and 
Antarctic ice sheets under the four IPCC Scenarios of 
future temperature rise Measurements of sea level from 
tide gauges around the world date back a hundred years and 
provide evidence for a small increase which appears to be 
fairly steady The stability of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, 
which has sometimes been invoked as a possible 
mechanism for large sea level rise in the future, is 
examined 
Climate Change and Ecosystems 
Ecosystems (both land and marine based plant-life) will 
respond to climate change and 
through feedback 
processes, influence it Section 10 looks at the direct effect 
of climate change on crops forests and tundra Plant 
growth and metabolism are functions of temperature and 
soil moisture, as well as carbon dioxide itself, changes in 
the activity of ecosystems will therefore modify the carbon 
cycle Plant species have migrated in the past, but their 
ability to adapt in future may be limited by the presence of 
artificial barriers caused by human activities and by the 
speed of climate change This Section also looks at the 
effects of deforestation and reforestation on the global 
carbon budget 
Improving our Predictions 
Despite our confidence in the general predictions from 
numerical models, there will be uncertainties in the detailed 
timing and patterns of climate change due to the enhanced 
greenhouse effect for some time to come Section 11 lists 
the many programs which are already underway or are 
planned to narrow these uncertainties These cover the full 
range of Earth and Space based observing systems, process 
studies to unravel the details of feedbacks between the 
many components of the climate system and expected 
developments in computer models 
The Climate Implications of Emission Controls 
In order that any policy decisions on emission controls are 
soundly based it is useful to quantify the climate benefits of 
different levels of controls on different time-scales The 
Annex to this Report shows the full pathway of emissions 
to temperature change and sea-level rise for the four IPCC 
Policy Scenarios plus four other Science Scenarios The 
Policy Scenarios were derived by IPCC Working Group III 
and assume progressively more stringent levels of emission 
controls The Science Scenarios were chosen artificially to 
illustrate the effects of sooner, rather than later, emission 
controls, and to show the changes in temperature and sea 
level which we may be committed to as a result of past 
emissions of greenhouse gases

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The Earth's climate is dependent upon the radiative balance of the 
atmosphere, which in turn depends upon the input of solar 
radiation and the atmospheric abundances ot ladiatively active 
trace gases (1 e , greenhouse gases), clouds and aerosols 
Since the industrial revolution the atmospheric concentrations 
of several greenhouse gases, i e , carbon dioxide (CO2) methane 
(CH4), chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), nitrous oxide (N2O), and 
tropospheric ozone (O3), have been increasing primarily due to 
human activities 
Several ol these gieenhouse gases have long 
atmospheric lifetimes, decades to centuries, which means that 
their atmospheric concentrations respond slowly to changes in 
emission rates 
In addition 
theie is evidence that the 
concentrations of troposphenc aerosols have increased at least

The atmospheric C02 concentration at'W ppm\ in 1990 is now 
about 25% greater than the pre industiial (1750 1800) value of 
about 280 ppmv, and higher than at any tune in at least the last 
160,000 years Carbon dioxide is currently rising at about 1 8 
ppmv (0 5%) per year due to anthropogenic emissions 
Anthropogenic emissions ol CCn are estimated to be 5 7±0 5 Gt 
C (in 1987) due to fossil fuel burning, plus 0 6 
2 5 Gt C (in 
1980) due to deforestation 
The atmospheric inuease during the 
past decade corresponds to (48±8)% ol the total emissions during 
the same period with the remamdei being taken up by the oceans 
and land 
Indirect evidence suggests that the land and oceans 
sequester CO2 in roughly equal pioportions 
though the 
mechanisms are not all well undeistood The time taken lor 
atmospheric CO2 to adjust to changes in sources 01 sinks is ot 
order 50 200 years, determined mainly by the slow exchange of 
carbon between surface watcis and deepei layeis ot the ocean 
Consequently 
CO2 emitted into the atmosphere today will 
influence the atmospheric concentiation ot CO2 tor centuries into 
the future Three models have been used to estimate that even if 
anthropogenic emissions of CO2 could be kept constant at present 
day rates, atmospheric CO2 would increase to 415 - 480 ppmv by 
the year 2050, and to 460 - 560 ppmv by the year 2100 In order 
to stabilize concentrations at present day levels an immediate 
reduction in global anthropogenic emissions by 60 80 perceni 
would be necessary 
Methane 
Current atmospheric CH4 concentration, at 1 72 ppim is now 
more than double the pre-industnal (1750 1800) value ot about 
0 8 ppmv, and is increasing at a rate of about 0 015 ppmv (0 9%) 
per year The major sink for CH4, reaction with hydroxyl (OH) 
radicals in the troposphere, results in a relatively short 
atmospheric lifetime of about 10 years Human activities such as 
rice cultivation, domestic ruminant rearing, biomass burning, coal 
mining, and natural gas venting have increased the input of CH4 
into the atmosphere, which combined with a possible decrease in 
the concentration ot tropospheric OH yields the observed rise in 
global CH4 However the quantitative importance of each ot the 
factors contributing to the observed increase is not well known at 
present In order to stabilize concentrations at present day levels 
an immediate reduction in global anthropogenic emissions by 15 
20 percent would be necessary 
Chlorofluorocarbons 
The current atmospheric concentrations of the anthropogenically 
produced halocarbons CCI3F (CFC 11) CCI2F2 (CFC 12) 
C2CI1F3 (CFC 1H) and CCI4 (carbon tetrachloride) are about 
280 pptv 484 pptv 60 pptv and 146 pptv respectively Over the 
past few decades their concentrations, except tor CCI4 have 
increased more rapidly (on a percentage basis) than the other 
gieenhouse gases, currently at rates ot at least 4% per year The 
fully halogenated CFCs and CCI4 are primarily removed by 
photolysis in the stratosphere, and have atmospheric lifetimes in 
excess of 50 years Future emissions will, most likely, be 
eliminated or significantly lower than todays because of current 
international negotiations to strengthen regulations on 
chlorofluorocarbons However, the atmospheric concentrations ot 
CFCs 11 12 and 1 H will still be significant O0 - 40% ot current)

Nitrous Oxide 
The current atmospheric N2O concentration, at ^ 10 ppbv, is now 
about 8% greater than in the pre-industnal era, and is increasing al 
a rate of about 0 8 ppbv (0 25%) per year The major sink foi 
N2O, photolysis in the stratosphere, results in a relatively long 
atmospheric lifetime ot about 150 years It is difficult to 
quantitatively account tor the source of the current increase in the 
atmospheric concentiation of N2O but it is thought to be due to 
human activities Recent data suggest thai the total annual flu\ ot 
N2O from combustion and biomass burning is much less than 
pieviously believed 
Agricultural practices may stimulate 
emissions ot N2O from soils and play a major role In order to

O/one is an effective greenhouse gas especially in the middle and 
upper troposphere and lower stratosphere Its concentration in the 
troposphere is highly variable because of its short lifetime It is 
photochemically produced in-situ through a series of complex 
reactions involving carbon monoxide (CO), CH4, non-methane 
hydrocarbons (NMHC), and nitrogen oxide radicals (NOx), and 
also transported downward from the stratosphere The limited 
observational data support positive trends of about 1% per year 
for O3 below 8 km in the northern hemisphere (consistent with 
positive trends in several of the precursor gases, especially NOx, 
CH4 and CO) but probably close to zero trend in the southern 
hemisphere There is also evidence that O3 has decreased by a 
few percent globally in the lower stratosphere (below 25 km) 
within the last decade Unfortunately, there are no reliable long-
term data near the tropopause 
Aerosol particles 
Aerosol particles have a lifetime of at most a few weeks in the 
troposphere and occur in highly variable concentrations A large 
proportion of the particles that influence cloud processes and the 
radiative balance is derived from gaseous sulphur emissions Due 
to fossil fuel combustion, these emissions have more than doubled 
globally, causing a large increase in the concentration of aerosol 
sulphate especially over and around the industrialized regions of 
Europe and North America Future concentrations of aerosol 
sulphate will vary in proportion to changes in anthropogenic 
emissions Aerosol particles derived from natural (biological) 
emissions may contribute to climate feedback processes During a 
few years following major volcanic eruptions the concentrations 
of natural aerosol particles in the stratosphere can be greatly 
enhanced

1.1 Introduction 
The Earth s climate is dependent upon the radiative balance 
ot the atmosphere, which in turn depends upon the input of 
solar radiation and the atmospheric abundances of 
radiatively active trace gases (l e , greenhouse gases), 
clouds and aerosols Consequently, it is essential to gain an 
understanding of how each ol these climate 
forcing 
agents varies naturally, and how some of them might be 
influenced by human activities 
The chemical composition of the Earth s atmosphere is 
changing, largely due to human activities (Table 1 1) Air 
trapped in Antarctic and Greenland ice shows that there 
have been major increases in the concentrations of 
radiatively active gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), 
methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) since the 
beginning of the industrial revolution 
In addition 
industrially-produced chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are now 
present in the atmosphere in significant concentrations, and 
there is evidence that the concentrations of troposphenc O3 
and aerosols have increased at least regionally 
Atmospheric measurements indicate that in many cases the 
rates of change have increased in recent decades Many ol 
the greenhouse gases have long atmospheric life-times, 
decades to centuries, which implies that their atmospheric 
concentrations respond slowly to changes in emission rates 
The effectiveness of a greenhouse gas in influencing the 
Earth s radiative budget is dependent upon its atmospheric 
concentration and its ability to absorb outgoing long-wave 
terrestrial radiation 
Troposphenc water vapour is the 
single most important greenhouse gas, but its atmospheric 
concentration is not significantly influenced by direct 
anthropogenic emissions Of the greenhouse gases that are 
directly alfected by human activities, CO2 has the largest 
radiative effect, followed by the CFCs, CH4, troposphenc 
O3, and N2O Although the present rate of increase in the 
atmospheric concentration of CO2 is about a factor of 
70,000 times greater than that of CCI3F (CFC-11) and 
CCI2F2 (CFC-12) combined, and a factor of about 120 
times greater than that of CH4, its contribution to changes 
in the radiative forcing during the decade of the 1980s was

various reservoirs (atmosphere ocean biota) The lifetime of CCb given in the table is a rough indication of the 
time it would take for the CCb concentiation to adjust to changes in the emissions (see section I 2 1 for further 
details)

about 55%, compared to 17% for CFCs (11 and 12), and 
15% for CH4 (see Section 2) Other CFCs and N2O 
accounted for about 8%, and 5%, respectively, of the 
changes in the radiative forcing While the contribution 
from troposphenc O3 may be important, it has not been 
quantified because the observational data is inadequate to 
determine its trend This pattern arises because of 
differences in the efficiencies of the gases to absorb 
terrestrial radiation 
Aerosol particles play an important role in the climate 
system because of their direct interaction (absorption and 
scattering) with solar and terrestrial radiation, as well as 
through their influence on cloud processes and thereby, 
indirectly, on radiative fluxes 
There is a clear need to document the historical record of 
the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and 
aerosols, as well as to understand the physical, chemical, 
geological, biological and social processes responsible for 
the observed changes A quantitative understanding of the 
atmospheric concentrations of these gases requires 
knowledge of the cycling and distribution of carbon, 
nitrogen and other key nutrients within and between the 
atmosphere, terrestrial ecosystems, oceans and sediments, 
and the influence of human actions on these cycles 
Without knowledge of the processes responsible for the 
observed past and present changes in the atmospheric 
concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols it will not 
be possible to predict with confidence future changes in 
atmospheric composition, nor therefore the resulting 
changes in the radiative forcing of the atmosphere 
1.2 Carbon Dioxide 
1.2.1 The Cycle of Carbon in Nature 
Carbon in the form of CO2, carbonates, 
organic 
compounds, etc is cycled between various reservoirs, 
atmosphere, oceans, land biota and marine biota, and, on 
geological time scales, also sediments and rocks (Figure 
1 1, for more detailed reviews see Sundquist, 1985 Bolin, 
1981. 1986, Trabalka, 1985, Siegenthaler, 1986) The 
largest natural exchange fluxes occur between the 
atmosphere and the terrestrial biota and between the 
atmosphere and the surface water of the oceans By 
comparison, the net inputs into the atmosphere from fossil 
fuel combustion and deforestation are much smaller, but 
are large enough to modify the natural balance 
The turnover time of CO2 in the atmosphere, measured 
as the ratio of the content to the fluxes through it, is about 4 
years This means that on average it takes only a few years 
betorc a CO2 molecule in the atmosphere is taken up by 
plants or dissolved in the ocean This short time scale must 
not be confused with the time it takes tor the atmospheric 
CO2 level to adjust to a new equilibrium if sources or sinks 
change This adjustment time, corresponding to the lifetime

in Table 1 1, is of the order of 50 - 200 years, determined 
mainly by the slow exchange of carbon between surface 
waters and the deep ocean The adjustment time is 
important for the discussions on global warming potential, 
cf Section 2 2 7 
Because of its complex cycle, the decay of excess CO2 
in the atmosphere does not follow a simple exponential 
curve, and therefore a single time scale cannot be given to 
characterize the whole adjustment process toward a new 
equilibrium The two curves in Figure 1 2, which represent 
simulations of a pulse input of CO2 into the atmosphere 
using atmosphere-ocean models (a box model and a 
General Circulation Model (GCM)), clearly show that the 
initial response (governed mainly by the uptake of CO2 by 
ocean surface waters) is much more rapid than the later 
response (influenced by the slow exchange between surface 
waters and deeper layers of the oceans) For example, the 
first reduction by 50 percent occurs within some 50 years, 
whereas the reduction by another 50 percent (to 25 percent 
of the initial value) requires approximately another 250 
years The concentration will actually never return to its 
original value, but reach a new equilibrium level, about 15 
percent of the total amount of CO2 emitted will remain in 
the atmosphere

input at time 0 (initially doubling the atmospheric CO2 
concentration), as calculated with two ocean-atmosphere models 
Solid line 3-dimensional ocean-circulation model of Maier-
Reimer and Hasselmann (1987), dashed line 1-dimensional box-
diffusion model of Siegenthaler and Oeschger (1987) The 
adjustment towards a new equilibrium does not follow an 
exponential curve, it is very fast during the first decade, then 
slows down more and more The concentration excess does not 
go to zero, after a long time, a new equilibrium partitioning 
between atmosphere and ocean will be reached, with about 15 
percent of the input residing in the atmosphere 
12 11 The lole of the atmosphet e 
The mean annual concentration of CO2 is relatively 
homogeneous throughout the troposphere because the 
troposphere is mixed on a time scale of about 1 year The 
pre-industnal atmospheric CO2 concentration was about 
280 ppmv, as reconstructed from ice core analyses (c f 
Section 124 1), corresponding to an atmospheric amount 
of 594 Gigatonnes of carbon (GtC 1 Gt = 109t = 1015g, 1 
ppmv CO2 of the global atmosphere equals 2 12 GtC and 
7 8 Gt CO2), today, the level is about 351 ppmv (Figures 
1 3 and 1 4) The atmospheric increase has been monitored 
since 1958 at a growing number of stations (Keeling and 
Heimann, 1986, Keeling et al , 1989a, Beardsmore and 
Pearman, 1987, Conway et al, 1988) 
12 12 The lole of the ocean 
On time scales of decades or more, the CO2 concentration 
of the unperturbed atmosphere is mainly controlled by the 
exchange with the oceans, since this is the largest of the 
carbon reservoirs There is a continuous exchange of CO2 
in both directions between the atmosphere and oceans The 
net flux into (or out of) the ocean is driven by the 
difference between the atmospheric partial pressure of CO2 
and the equilibrium partial pressure of CO2 (pC02) in 
surface waters 
The exchange of carbon between the surface and deeper 
layers is accomplished mainly through transport by water 
Figure 1.3: Atmospheric CO2 increase in the past 250 years, as 
indicated by measurements on air trapped in ice from Siple 
Station, Antarctica (squares, Neftel et al, 1985a, Fnedli et al, 
1986) and by direct atmospheric measurements at Mauna Loa,

Year 
Figure 1.4: Monthly average CO2 concentration in parts per 
million of dry air, observed continuously at Mauna Loa, Hawaii 
(Keeling et al 1989a) The seasonal variations are due primarily 
to the withdrawal and production of CO2 by the terrestrial biota 
motions Ventilation of the thermochne (approximately the 
uppermost km of the ocean) is particularly important for 
the downward transport of anthropogenic CO2 The deep 
circulation is effective on time scales of 100-1000 years 
The natural carbon cycle in the ocean and in particular 
pC02 in surface ocean water are strongly influenced also 
by biological processes 
The marine biota serve as a 
'biological pump , transporting organic carbon 
from 
surface waters to deeper layers as a rain of detritus at a rate 
ot about 4 GtC per year (Eppley and Peterson 1979) 
which is balanced by an equal upward transport of carbon 
by deeper water richer in CO2 than surface water This 
biological pump has the effect of reducing surface pCC>2 
10 
Gi eenhouse Gases and Aei osols 1 
very substantially without the biological pump ("dead 
ocean ) the pre-industnal CO2 level would have been 
higher than the observed value ol 280 ppmv, at perhaps 450 
ppmv (Wenk, 1985, Bacastow and Maier-Reimer, 1990) 
Alterations in the marine biota due to climatic change could 
therelore have a substantial effect on CO2 levels in the 
future Note, however, that the "biological pump" does not 
help to sequester anthropogenic CO2 (see Section 12 4 2) 
12 11 The 1 ole of tei 1 esti lal 1 eqetation and sods 
The most important processes in the exchange of carbon 
are those of photosynthesis, autotrophic respiration (1 e , 
CO2 production by the plants) and heterotrophic (1 e , 
essentially microbial) respiration converting the organic 
material back into CCb mainly in soils (c f Section 10 for a 
detailed discussion) Net primary production (NPP) is the 
net annual uptake of CCb by the vegetation, NPP is equal 
to the gioss uptake (gross primary production, GPP) minus 
autotiophic respiration In an unperturbed world, NPP and 
decomposition by heterotrophic respiration are approx-
imately balanced on an annual basis, iormation of soils and 
peat corresponds to a (relatively small) excess of NPP 
The carbon balance can be changed considerably by the 
direct impact ot human activities (land use changes, 
particularly deforestation), by climate changes, and by 
other changes in the environment, e g , atmospheric 
composition Since the pools and fluxes are large (NPP 50-
60 GtC per year, GPP 90 120 GtC per year, Houghton et 
al 1985b) any perturbations can have a significant effect 
on the atmospheric concentration of CO2 
1.2.2 Anthropogenic Perturbations 
The concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere are primarily 
affected by two anthropogenic processes release of CO2 
from fossil fuel combustion, and changes in land use such 
as deforestation 
12 2 1 Histontalfossd fuel input 
The global input of CO2 to the atmosphere from fossil fuel 
combustion, plus minor industrial sources like cement 
production, has shown an exponential increase since 1860 
(about 4% per year), with majoi interruptions during the 
two world wars and the economic cnsis in the thirties 
(Figure 1 5) Following the 'oil crisis ot 1973, the rate of 
increase of the CO2 emissions fust decreased to 
approximately 2% per year, and after 1979 the global 
emissions remained almost constant at a level of 5 3 GtC 
per year until 1985, when they started to rise again, 
reaching 5 7 GtC per year in 1987 (Figure 1 5) The 
cumulative release of CO2 from fossil fuel use and cement 
manufacturing from 1850 to 1987 is estimated at 200 GtC ± 
10%(Marland, 1989) 
Ninety five percent of the industrial CO2 emissions are 
from the Northern Hemisphere, dominated by industiial

Figure 1.5: Global annual emissions of CO2 from fossil fuel

(Rotty and Marland, 1986, Marland, 1989) The average rate ot 
increase in emissions between 1860 and 1910 and between 1950 
and 1970 is about 4% per year 
countries, where annual releases reach up to about 5 tC per 
capita (Rotty and Marland, 1986) In contrast, CO2 
emission rates in most developing countries he between 0 2 
and 0 6 tC per capita per year However, the relative rate of 
increase of the CO2 emissions is much larger in the 
developing countries (~ 6% per year), showing almost no 
slowing down after 1973 in contrast to Western Europe and 
North America where the rate of increase decreased from 
about 3% per year (1945-72) to less than 1% per year 
(1973-84) 
12 2 2 Hist01 ical land use changes 
The vegetation and soils of unmanaged forests hold 20 to 
100 times more carbon per unit area than agricultural 
systems The amount of carbon released to the atmosphere 
compared to that accumulated on land as a result of land 
use change depends on the amounts of carbon held in 
biomass and soils, rates of oxidation of wood products 
(either rapidly through burning or more slowly through 
decay), rates of decay of organic matter in soils, and rates 
of regrowth of forests following harvest or abandonment of 
agricultural land The heterogeneity ot terrestrial eco-
systems makes estimation of global inventories and fluxes 
difficult 
The total release of carbon to the atmosphere from 
changes in land use, primarily deforestation, between 1850 
and 1985 has been estimated to be about 115 GtC 
(Houghton and Skole, 1990), with an error limit ol about 
±35 GtC The components of the flux to the atmosphere 
are (1) burning associated with land use change, (2) decay 
7 Gi eenhouse Gases and Aei osoli 
11 
of biomass on site (roots, stumps, slash, twigs etc ), (3) 
oxidation of wood products removed from site (paper, 
lumber, waste etc ), (4) oxidation of soil carbon, minus (5) 
regrowth of trees and redevelopment of soil organic matter 
following harvest Although the greatest releases of carbon 
in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were from 
lands in the temperate zone (maximum 0 5 GtC per year), 
the major source of carbon during the past several decades 
has been from deforestation in the tropics, with a 
significant increase occurring since 1950 Over the entire 
135 yr period, the release from tropical regions is estimated 
to have been 2-3 times greater than the release from middle 
and high latitudes Estimates of the flux in 1980 range from 
0 6 to 2 5 GtC (Houghton et al , 1985a, 1987, 1988, 
Detwiler and Hall, 1988) virtually all of this flux is from 
the tropics The few regions for which data exist suggest 
that the annual flux is higher now than it was in 1980 
1.2.3 Long-Term Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Variations 
The most reliable information on past atmospheric CO2 
concentrations is obtained by the analysis of polar ice 
cores The process of air occlusion lasts from about 10 up 
to 1000 years, depending on local conditions (e g , 
precipitation rate), so that an air sample in old ice reflects 
the atmospheric composition averaged over a corr-
esponding time interval 
Measurements on samples representing the last glacial 
maximum (18,000 yr before present) fiom ice cores from 
Greenland and Antarctica (Neftel et al , 1982 1988 
Delmas et al , 1980) showed CO2 concentrations of 180-
200 ppmv 1 e , about 70 percent of the pre-industnal value 
Analyses on the ice cores from Vostok, Antarctica, have 
provided new data on natural variations of CO2, covering a 
full glacial interglacial cycle (Figure 1 6, Barnola et al 
1987) 
Over the whole period there is a remarkable 
correlation between polar temperature, as deduced from 
deuterium data, and the CO2 piohle 
The glacial-
mterglacial shifts ol CO2 concentrations must have been 
linked to large-scale changes in the circulation of the ocean 
and in the whole interplay of biological, chemical and 
physical piocesses, but the detailed mechanisms are not yet 
very clear 
The CO2 variations were large enough to 
potentially contribute, via the greenhouse eflect, to a 
substantial (although not the major) part ol the glacial-
interglacial climate change (Hansen et al , 1984, Bioccoh 
andManabc 1987) 
ke coie studies on Greenland ice indicate that during the 
last glauation CO2 concentration shifts of the order of 50 
ppmv may have occurred within less than 100 years 
(Staufler ct al , 1984), paiallcl to abrupt, drastic climatic 
events (temperatuic changes of the order of 5°C) These 
rapid CO2 changes have not yet been identified in ice coics 
from Antaictica (possibly due to long occlusion times.

1985a, Fnedli et al , 1986, Siegenthaler et al , 1988, 
Raynaud and Barnola, 1985, Pearman et al , 1986) They 
indicate that during the period 1000 to 1800, the 
atmospheric concentration was between 270 and 290 ppmv 
The relative constancy seems surprrsmg in view of the fact 
that the atmosphere exchanges about 30 percent of its CO2 
with the oceans and biota each year This indicates that the 
sensitivity of atmospheric CO2 levels to minor climatic 
changes such as the Little Ice Age (lasting from the end of 
the 16th to the middle of the 19th century), when global 
mean temperatures probably decreased by about 1°C, is 
small

Gwenhouse Gases and Aeiosols I 
A piecise reconstruction of the CO? increase during the 
past two centunes has been obtained from an ice core from 
Siple Station, Antaictica (Figure 1 3, Ncftel et al , 1985a, 
Fuedli et al, 1986) These tesults indicate that CO2 staited 
to use around 1800 and had already increased by about 15 
ppmv by 1900 Precise direct atmospheric measurements 
started in 1958, when the level was about 315 ppmv and the 
rate ol increase 0 6 ppmv per year The present atmospheric 
CO2 level has reached 353 ppmv, and the mean growth rate 
has now reached about 1 8 ppmv per year (Figure 1 4, 
Keeling et al, 1989a) 
12 4 2 Uptake b\ the ocean 
The ocean is an important reservoir for taking up 
anthropogenic CO2 The relative increase of dissolved 
inorganic carbon (total CO2) in ocean water is smaller than 
in the atmosphere (only 2-3 percent until now see below) 
Precise measurements of dissolved inorganic carbon can be 
made with present analytical tools However, an accurate 
determination of the trend in dissolved inorganic carbon is 
difficult because of its variability in time and space 
Hence, lepeated transects and time series will be required 
to assess the total oceanic CO2 uptake with good precision 
The net flux of CO2 into (or out of) the ocean is given by 
the pioduct ot a gas transfer coefficient and ApC02 (the 
CO2 paitial pressure difference between ocean and 
atmosphere) The gas tiansfer coefficient increases with 
mcicasing wind speed and also depends on water 
tempciatuic Therefore, the net flux into the ocean can be 
estimated liom a knowledge of the atmospheric CO2 
concentration pCCb in surface water (for which the data 
aic still sparse), the global distribution of wind speeds ovei 
the ocean as well as the relation between wind speed and 
gas tiansfei coefficient (which is known to ±30% only) 
There have been several estimates of the global net uptake 
ot CO2 by the oceans using observations (e g Enting and 
Pearman 1982 1987) The most lecent estimate yields 1 6 
GtC per year (Tans et al , 1990) the error ot this estimate 
is, according to the authors, not easy to estimate 
Estimates of oceanic CCb uptake in the past and in the 
tutuie lcqune models of the global carbon cycle that take 
into account air-sea gas exchange aqueous carbonate 
chemistiy and the tiansport from the surface to deep ocean 
layers The aqueous carbonate chemistr> in sea water 
opeiates in a mode that if the atmospheric CO2 
concentration increases by e g 
10% then the con-
centiation ol dissolved inorganic carbon in sea water 
increases by only about 1% at equilibnum Therefore, the 
ocean is not such a powerlul sink foi anthropogenic CO2 as 
might seem at Inst when comparing the relative sizes of the 
leseivoirs (Figuie 1 1) 
The late at which anthropogenic CO2 is tiansported fiom 
the suilace to deeper ocean layeis is determined by the iate 
of watei exchange in the vertical It is known horn 
measurements ot the radioactive isotope 
l 4C that on 
average it takes hundreds to about one thousand years for 
watei at the surface to penetrate to well below the mixed 
layer ot the majoi oceans (e g , Bioeckci and Peng, 1982) 
Thus, in most oceanic regions only the top seveial hundred 
metres ot the oceans have at piesent taken up significant 
amounts of anthropogenic CO2 An exception is the North 
Atlantic Ocean wheie bomb-produced tritium has been 
observed even near the bottom of the sea, indicating the 
active formation ol new deep water 
The lain ol biogenic detntal particles, which is important 
for the natural caibon cycle, does not significantly 
contribute to a sequestenng ol excess CO2, since the 
marine biota do not directly respond to the CO2 increase 
Their activity is contioiled by other factors, such as light, 
temperature and limiting nutrients (e g , nitrogen, 
phosphorus, silicon) Thus only the input ot fertilizers 
(phosphate, nitrate) into the ocean through human activities 
may lead to an additional sedimentation of organic carbon 
in the ocean, different authors have estimated the size of 
this additional sink at between 0 04 and 0 3 GtC per year 
(see Baes et al 
1985) It seems thus justified to estimate 
the fossil fuel CO2 uptake to date considering the 
biological flux to be constant as long as climatic changes 
due to increasing greenhouse gases, or natural causes, do 
not modify the marine biotic processes Although this 
appears a icasonable assumption for the past and present 
situation, it may well not be so in the future 
The carbon cycle models used to date to simulate the 
atmosphere-ocean system have often been highly simp-
lified, consisting of a few well-mixed or diffusive 
reservoirs (boxes) (e g , Oeschger et al , 1975, Broecker et 
al , 1980, Bolin, 1981, Enting and Pearman, 1987, 
Siegenthalei, 1983) 
Even though these box models are 
highly simplified they are a powerful means for identifying 
the importance of the diflerent processes that determine the 
flux of CO2 into the ocean (e g , Broecker and Peng, 1982, 
Peng and Broecker 1985) The results of these models are 
considered to be reasonable because, as long as the ocean 
circulation is not changing, the models need only simulate 
the transport of excess CO2 from the atmosphere into the 
ocean, but not the actual dynamics of the ocean 
In the 
simple models, the oceanic transport mechanisms e g, 
formation ol deep water are parameterized The transport 
parameters (e g , eddy diffusivity) are determined from 
observations of transient tracers that are analogues to the 
flux of anthropogenic CO2 into the ocean If a model 
reproduces correctly the observed distribution of, e g , 
bomb produced 14c, then it might be expected to simulate 
reasonably the flux ol CO2 into the ocean A 1-D box-
dilfusion model yields an oceanic uptake of 2 4 GtC per 
ycai on aveiagc foi the decade 1980 - 1989, and an 
outciop-diflusion model (both described by Siegenthaler, 
1983) 3 6 GtC per year The lattei model most probably 
1 Gi eenhouse Gast"; and Aei osols 
13 
overpiedicts the flux into the ocean, because it includes an 
infinitely fast exchange between high-latitude surlace 
waters and the deep ocean 
However it is obviously desirable to use 3-dimensional 
(3-D) general circulation models of the oceans for this 
purpose At this time, only a few modelling groups have 
started to do this One 3-D model (Maier-Reimer and 
Hasselmann, 1987) gives a similar CO2 uptake as a 1-D 
box-diffusion model of Siegenthaler (1983), as illustrated 
by the model response to a pulse input of CO2 
(Figure 
12) In a recent revised version of this model 
(Maier-
Reimer et al , personal communication) the ocean takes up 
less CO~2, about 1 2 GtC per year on average for the decade 
1980 - 1989 The GFDL 3-D ocean model (Sarmiento et 
al 1990) has an oceanic uptake of 1 9 GtC per year for the 
same period 3-D ocean models and especially coupled 
atmosphere ocean models are the only means to study in a 
realistic way the feedback effects that climate change may 
have on atmospheric CO2 via alteration of the ocean 
circulation (cf Section 12 7 1) However, models need to 
be constrained by more data than are presently available 
The oceanic uptake of CCb for the decade 1980 - 1989, 
as estimated based on carbon models (e g 
Siegenthaler 
and Oeschger, 1987, Maier-Reimer et al 
personal 
communication, 1990, Goudnaan, 1989, Sarmiento et al , 
1990) is in the range 2 0±0 8 GtC per year 
124 ? Redistubiition 
of antluopoqenic 
ecu ban dioxide 
During the period 1850 to 1986, 195±20 GtC were released 
by fossil fuel burning and 117+35 GtC by deforestation and 
changes in land use, adding up to a cumulative input of 
312±40GtC 
Atmospheric CO2 increased from about 288 ppmv to 
348 ppmv during this period, coiresponding to (41±6)% of 
the cumulative input This percentage is sometimes called 
the airborne iraction , but that term should not be mis-
understood 
all CCb, anthropogenic and non-anthio 
pogenic is continuously being exchanged between atmos-
phere ocean and biosphere Conventionally an 
airborne 
fraction 
rcfcning to the fossil fuel input only has olten 
been quoted because only the emissions due to fossil luel 
burning are known with good piecision Howevci this may 
be misleading since the atmospheric inciease is a response 
to the total emissions We therefore prcler the definition 
based on the latter The airborne fraction for the penod 
1980 
1989 (see calculation below) corresponds to 
(48±8)% of the cumulative input 
In model simulations of the past CCb increase using 
estimated emissions from fossil fuels and deloicstation it 
has geneially been found that the simulated inciease is 
larger than that actually observed An estimate loi the 
decade 1980 1989 is

The result from this budget and from other studies is that 
the estimated emissions exceed the sum of atmospheric 
increase plus model-calculated oceanic uptake by a 
significant amount 
The question therefore arises whether 
an important mechanism has been overlooked All attempts 
to identify such a 
missing sink 
in the ocean have 
however failed so lar A possible exception is that a natural 
fluctuation in the oceanic carbon system could have caused 
a decreasing atmospheric baseline concentration in the past 
few decades, this does not appear likely in view of the 
relative constancy of the pre-industnal CO2 concentration 
Theie are possible processes on land which could account 
for the missing CCn (but it has not been possible to verify 
them) They include the stimulation of vegetative growth 
by increasing CCb levels (the CCb fertilization effect) the 
possible enhanced productivity of vegetation under warmer 
conditions 
and the direct effect ol fertilization 
from 
agricultural fertilizers and from nitrogenous releases into 
the atmosphere 
It has been estimated that increased 
fertilization by nitrogenous releases could account for a 
sequestering of up to a maximum of 1 GtC per year in 
terrestrial ecosystems (Melillo private communication 
1990) In addition changed forest management practices 
may also result in an increase in the amount of carbon 
stored in northern mid-latitude forests The extent to which 
mid-latitude terrestrial systems can sequester carbon betoie 
becoming saturated and ineffective is unknown As mid 
latitude terrestrial systems become close to saturation and 
hence ineffective in sequestering carbon this would allow 
moie of the CCb to remain in the atmosphere 
A technique for establishing the global distribution of 
surface sources and sinks has been to take global 
observations of atmospheric CCb concentration and 
isotopic composition and to inveit these by means of 
atmospheric transpoit models to deduce spatial and 
temporal patterns of surface fluxes (Pearman et al 
1983 
Pearman and Hyson 1986, Keeling and Heimann 
1986) 
The obseived inter hemispheric CO2 
concentration 
difterence (currently about 3 ppmv) is smaller than one 
would expect given that nearly all lossil releases occur in 
the Noithein Hemisphere The results of this approach 
suggest that there is an unexpectedly large sink in the 
Noithern Hcimsphcie equivalent to more than half of the 
fossil fuel CCb lelease (Enting and Mansbndge 
1989 
Tansetal 
1990 Keeling et al 
1989b) Furthcimorc it has 
been concluded that the oceanic uptake compatible with 
oceanic 
and 
atmospheric 
CCb data and with a 3 
dimensional atmospheric transport model is at most 1 GtC

sinks For the sake of illustration, several schematic 
scenarios are shown in Figures 1 7 and 1 8 Those of Figure 
1 7 are based on prescribed total CO2 emission rates after 
1990, for those in Figure 1 8 atmospheric concentrations 
after 1990 were prescribed and the corresponding emission 
rates were calculated to fit these concentrations A box-
diffusion model of the global cycle was used for these 
simulations (Enting and Pearman, 1982, 1987), with an 
oceanic eddy diffusivity of 5350 m 2year' and an air-sea 
gas exchange rate corresponding to an exchange coefficient 
of 0 12 year"1 The calculations assume no biosphenc-
climate feedbacks, and also assume that after 1990 the net 
biosphenc input of CO2 is zero, 1 e , the input of CO2 from 
tropical deforestation is balanced by uptake of CCb by 
terrestrial ecosystems 
In case a (all emissions stopped 
Figure 1 7), the 
atmospheric concentration declines, but only slowly (from 
351 ppmv in 1990 to 331 ppmv in 2050 and 324 ppmv in 
2100), because the penetration of man-made CO2 to deeper 
ocean layers takes a long time Even if the emissions were 
reduced by 2% per year lrom 1990 on (case b), atmos-
pheric CO2 would continue to increase tor several decades 
Case c (constant emission rate after 1990) gives CO2 levels 
of about 450 ppmv in 2050 and 520 ppmv in 2100 A 
constant relative growth rate of 2% per year (case d) would 
yield 575 ppmv in 2050 and 1330 ppmv in 2100 
Comparison of cases b, c and d clearly shows that measures 
to reduce emissions will result in slowing down the rate of 
atmospheric CO2 growth 
Cases b and c, in comparison to b and c, schematically 
illustrate the effect of reducing emissions in 2010 instead of 
in 1990 
If an (arbitrary) threshold ol 420 ppmv 1 e , 50% above 
pre-industnal, is not to be exceeded (case e, Figure 1 8), 
then CO2 production rates should slowly decline, reaching 
about 50% of their present value by 2050 and 30% by 
2100 
In order to keep the concentration at the present 
level (case f) emissions would have to be reduced 
drastically to 30% of present immediately and to less than 
20% by 2050 
The iesults of scenario calculations with a 3-D ocean-
atmosphere model (Maier-Reimer and Hasselmann, 1987, 
Maier Reimer et al , personal communication, 1990 -
revised model) give higher concentrations than those 
shown in Figure 1 7 obtained with a box-diffusion model, 
for instance, about 480 ppmv in the year 2050 and about 
560 ppmv in the year 2100 for Scenario C, compared to 
about 450 ppmv and 520 ppmv On the other hand, 
calculations with a box model that includes a biosphenc 
CO2 sink (Goudriaan, 1989) yields somewhat lower 
concentrations than shown in Figure 1 7, for instance about 
415 ppmv in the year 2050 and 460 ppmv in the year 2100

atmosphenc CO2 The climate change Earth has exp 
erienced in the recent past is still within the range of 
natural short-term variability, and so are probably 
theielore the leedback effects ol anthropogenic climate 
change However, as the changes in the climate become 
larger than natural climatic variation the magnitude of the 
feedback effects should begin to have a significant effect 
These feedbacks could in general be either positive 
(amplifying the initial changes) or negative (attenuating 
them)

will inciease with increasing temperatuie, tending to 
deciease the net uptake by the oceans The future 
atmosphenc CO2 inciease may be amplified by something 
like 5 peitent due to this effect (Lashot 1989) 
12 7 12 Ocean cuculatwn 
The ocean circulation may 
change in response to thmatic change As a consequence of 
increasing surtace water temperatures the theimochne may 
become more resistant to veitical mixing and slow down 
the uptake of anthropogenic CO2 Modified wind stress 
may affect the ocean circulation Howevei, the overall 
change in ocean dynamics and consequently in CO2 
uptake due to a climatic change cannot be estimated Irom 
simple considerations, a proper evaluation of such an effect 
tan only be done using dynamical ocean models Studies 
on Greenland ice cores indicates that during the last 
glaciation, significant CO2 concentiation shifts may have 
otturred within less than 100 years (c f Section 1 2 3) 
piobably caused by strong changes of laige-scale ocean 
tirtulation Therefore, the possibility that, due to climatic 
changes unexpected abrupt events may take place in the 
natuial taibon system cannot be excluded 
1 2 7 1 •< Gas c \cham>e lates A change in the global wind 
pattern could mlluence the gas transfer Irom the 
atmospheie to the sea surface Carbon cycle models show 
that the net CO2 uptake by the global ocean is not sensitive 
to the gas transfer coefficients (because it is controlled 
mainly by vertical mixing, not by gas exchange, Oeschger 
et al 197=5 Broetkeretal 
1980 Sarmiento et al 1990) 
so this eflett would probably be of minor influence

become disturbed consequent on variations in ocean 
dynamics (t I Settion 12 7 12), so as to influence 
atmospheric CO2 As a result of thmate change, the 
distribution ot marine ecosystems and species composition 
could change, which could affect pC02 in surface waters 
It is not possible at present to predict the direction and 
magnitude of such effects 
Waiming of the oceans might lead to accelerated 
decomposition ot dissolved organic carbon, converting it 
into CO2 and thus amplify the atmospheric increase 
(Brewer, peisonal communication, 1990) 
1 2 7 1 S UV B ladiation A 1 eduction in stratospheric O3 
would increase the intensity of UV-B radiation at the 
Earths surface This might have negative effects on the 
marine biota due to a decrease of marine productivity and 
thus on the biological caibon pump This could lead to an 
increase in the concentration of CO2 in surface waters and 
consequently in the atmosphere

Caibon dioxide feitilization 
Short-term exp-
eriments under controlled conditions with crops and other 
annuals, as well as with a lew perennials, show an increase 
in the rates of photosynthesis and growth in most plants 
under elevated levels ot CO2 (Strain and Cure, 1985) If 
elevated levels of CO2 increase the productivity of natural 
ecosystems, more carbon may be stored in woody tissue or 
soil organic matter Such a storage of carbon will withdraw 
carbon from the atmosphere and serve as a negative 
leedback on the CO2 increase Of particular importance is 
the response of forests (Luxmoore et al , 1986), given that 
forests conduct about 2/3 of global photosynthesis (50% of 
this cycles annually through leaves, while 50% is stored in 
woody tissue) However, it is not clear whether the 
increases in photosynthesis and growth will persist for 
more than a few giowing seasons, whether they will occur 
at all in natuial ecosystems and to what degree they will 
result in an increased storage of carbon in terrestrial 
ecos) stems 
12 7 2 2 Eutiophication and toufuation 
The increased 
availability of nutrients such as nitrate and phosphate from 
agricultural fertilizers and from combustion of fossil fuels 
may stimulate the growth of plants It has been estimated 
that the effect of cutrophication, both on land and in the 
oceans, could be as large as 1 GtC per year (Mclillo, 
pi lvate communication 1990) However, it should be noted 
1 Gieenhouse Gases and Aei osols 
17 
that the greater availability of nutrients has often been 
associated with increasing levels of acid precipitation and 
air pollution, which have been associated with a reduction 
in the growth ol tcnestnal biota 
1272 3 Tempeiatuie 
Under non-tropical conditions, 
photosynthesis and respiration by plants and by microbes 
both tend to increase with increasing temperature, but 
respiration is the more sensitive process, so that a warming 
of global air temperature is likely to result in an initially 
increased release of carbon to the atmosphere Estimates 
indicate that the additional flux might be significant 
perhaps as large as one or a few GtC per year (Woodwell, 
1983, Kohlmaier, 1988, Lashol, 1989, Houghton and 
Woodwell, 1989) This temperature-enhanced respiration 
would be a positive feedback on global wanning 
12724 
Watci Changes in soil water may affect carbon 
fixation and storage Increased moisture can be expected to 
stimulate plant growth in dry ecosystems and to increase 
the storage ot carbon in tundra peat There is a possibility 
that stresses biought about by climatic change may be 
alleviated by increased levels of atmospheric CO2 At 
present however, it is not possible to predict reliably cither 
the geographical distribution of changes in soil water or the 
net eflect of these changes on caibon fluxes and storage in 
different ecosystems Changes in climate are generally 
believed to be more important than changes in the 
atmospheric concentration of CCn in affecting ecosystem 
processes (c f Section 10 ) 
12 7 2 5 Change in qeoqiaplutal disliibntion of \ dictation 
t\pes In response to environmental change, the structure 
and location of vegetation types may change If the rate of 
change is slow, plant distributions may adjust II, however 
the rate of change is fast, large areas of toiests might not be 
able to adapt rapidly enough, and hence be negatively 
affected with a subsequent release of CO? to the 
atmosphere 
12 7 2 6 UV-B ladiation 
A reduction in stratospheric O3 
would increase the intensity ot UV-B radiation at the 
Earth s >urtace Increased UV-B may have a detrimental 
effect on many land biota, including crops (Teiamura, 
1983), thus affecting the strength of the biosphenc sink ol 
CO2 over land 
1.2.8 Conclusions 
The atmospheric CO2 concentration is now about 
353ppmv 25% higher than the pre industrial (1750-1800) 
value and higher than at any time in at least the last 
160,000 yeais This use, currently amounting to about 1 8 
ppmv per year, is beyond any doubt due to human 
activities Anthropogenic emissions of CO2 were 5 7±0 5 
GtC due to fossil fuel burning in 1987, plus 0 6 to 2 5 GtC 
due to deforestation (estimate for 1980) During the last 
decade (1980 - 1989) about 48% of the anthiopogemc 
emissions have stayed in the atmosphere, the remainder has 
been taken up by the oceans and possibly by land 
ecosystems Our qualitative knowledge of the global 
carbon cycle is, in view of the complexity ol this cycle, 
relatively good However, the current quantitative estimates 
of sources and of sinks of CO2 do not balance the 
atmospheric increase is less rapid than expected from 
carbon cycle models (in which CO2 fertilization or 
environmental responses of the biosphere are not included) 
This, and model analyses ol the inter-hemispheric CO2 
giadient, indicate that the Northern Hemisphere terrestrial 
ecosystems may act as a significant sink of carbon Such a 
sink has, however, not been directly identified 
To 
summarize the total annual input of anthropogenic CO2 is 
currently (1980-1989) about 7 0±1 1 GtC assuming a 
central value for the input of CO2 from 
tropical 
deforestation, the annual uptake by the oceans is estimated 
(based on the box models, GCMs and Tans et al 1990) to 
be about 2 0+10 GtC, and the annual atmospheric 
accumulation is about 3 4±0 2 GtC Thus, the annual 
sequestering by the terrestrial biosphere should be about 
1 6±1 5 GtC While several mechanisms have been 
suggested that could sequester carbon in terrestnal 
ecosystems, it is difficult to account for the total required 
sink Therefore, it appears likely that, (1) the uptake of CO2 
by the oceans is underestimated (11) there are important 
unidentified piocesses in terrestrial ecosystems that can 
sequester CO2, and/or (111) the amount ol CO2 released 
from tropical deforestation is at the low end of cuirent 
estimates 
If the land biota piesently act as a sink of carbon due to a 
fertilization effect, then they might become saturated with 
respect to this feitilization at some time in the Iuture This 
means that we cannot assume that the tenestnal sink 
which may be active currently, will continue to exist 
unchanged through the next century 
In order to avoid a continued rapid growth of CO2 in the 
atmospheie 
severe reductions on emissions will be 
necessary The time taken for atmospheric CO2 to adjust 
to changes in sources or sinks is ot the order of 50-200 
years, determined mainly by the slow exchange of carbon 
between surface wateis and deeper layers ot the ocean 
Even if all anthropogenic emissions of CO2 weie halted 
the atmospheric concentration would decline only slowly, 
and it would not approach its pie-industrial level for many 
hundieds ot years Thus, any reductions in emissions will 
only become fully elfective after a time of the order of a 
century 01 more Based on some model estimates which 
neglect the feedbacks discussed earlier the atmosphenc 
concentiation in the year 2050 would be between 530 - 600 
ppmv foi a constant relative giowth ol the annual

anthiopogenic emissions by 2% pei year, and between 415 
- 480 ppmv (increasing to 460 - 560 ppmv by the year 
2100) lor a constant anthiopogenic emission rate at the 
1990 level 
In ordei not to exceed 420 ppmv (50% above 
pie-industrial), annual anthropogenic emissions would have 
to be reduced continuously to about 50% of their present 
value by the year 2050 In order to stabilize concentrations 
at present day concentrations 0 5 3 ppmv), an immediate 
reduction in global anthropogenic emissions by 60-80 
pei cent would be necessary The size of the estimated 
I eduction depends on the carbon cycle model used 
Duung the millennium preceding the anthropogenic CO2 
giowth, the concentiation was relatively constant near 280 
ppmv, with a vailability of less than + 10 ppmv This 
indicates that the sensitivity ot atmospheric CO2 levels to 
minoi climatic changes such as the Little Ice Age, where 
global mean temperatures probably decreased by about 
1°C, is within this range However, the anticipated climatic 
and environmental changes may soon become large enough 
to act back on the oceanic and teirestnal carbon cycle in a 
more substantial way 
A close interaction between climate 
vanations and the carbon cycle is indicated by the glacial-
mterglacial CO2 variations The ice-core record shows that 
CO2 concentiations during the coldest part of the last 
glaciation were about 30% lower than during the past 
10 000 yeais The glacial mlerglacial CO2 vanations were 
probably due to changes in ocean circulation and marine 
biological activity, and were correlated to variations in 
global climate There is some (not fully clear) evidence 
horn ice cores that rapid changes ol CO2, ca 50 ppmv 
within about a century, occurred during and at the end ol 
the ice age 
If global tcmpeiatures increase, this could change the 
natuial I luxes of carbon, thus having feedback effects on 
atmospheric CO2 Some ot the identified feedbacks are 
potentially large and could significantly inlluence future 
CO2 levels They are difficult to quantify, but it seems 
likely that there would be a net positive feedback, 1 e , they 
will enhance the man-made increase On the longer term, 
the possibility ol unexpected large changes in the mech-
anisms of the carbon cycle due to a human-induced change 
in climate cannot be excluded 
1.3 Methane 
Methane is a chemically and radiativcly active trace gas 
that is produced from a wide variety of anaerobic (1 e , 
oxygen deficient) processes and is primarily removed by 
reaction with hydroxyl radicals (OH) in the troposphere 
Oxidation of CH4 by OH in the stratosphere is a significant 
source ot stratospheric water (H2O) where it is an 
important gicenhouse gas

u 1 ec 01 d of methane 
There are good data on the atmospheric concentration of 
CH4 (Figure 1 9) from Antarctic and Greenland ice cores 
for the period between 10,000 and 160,000 years ago 
(Raynaud et al 
1988, Stauffer et al , 1988, Craig and 
Chou, 1982, Chappellaz et al , 1990) The minimum 
concentration during the last glacial periods (about 20,000 
and 150,000 years ago) was around 0 15 ppmv, and rose 
rapidly, in phase with the observed temperature increases, 
to about 0 65 ppmv duung the 
glacial-interglacial 
transitions (about 15,000 and 130,000 years ago) The 
atmospheric concentrations of CH4 decreased rapidly, prior 
to, and during the last deglaciation period about 10,000 
11,000 years ago (the Younger Dryas period when there 
were abrupt temperature decreases in Greenland and 
northern Europe), and increased lapidly thereafter 
Because ot the brittle nature of the ice cores, data on the 
atmosphenc concentiations of CH4 ate iehablc only duung 
the last 2,000 years ot the Holocene period (last 10 000 
years) 
1 G>eenhouse Gases and Aeiosols

13 12 Contempoi ai y i ec oi d of methane 
Ice core data (Figure 1 10) indicate that the atmospheric 
concentrations of CH4 averaged around 0 8 ppmv between 
two hundred and two thousand years ago, increasing to 0 9 
ppmv one hundred years ago (Craig and Chou, 1982, 
Rasmussen and Khahl, 1984, Stauffer et al, 1985, Pearman 
and Fraser, 1988, Pearman et al , 1986, Ethendge et al , 
1988) Since then, the atmospheric concentration of CH4 
has increased smoothly to present levels, highly correlated 
with global human population Analysis of infrared solar 
spectra has shown that the atmospheric concentration of 
CH4 has increased by about 30% over the last 40 years 
(Rinsland et al , 1985, Zander et al, 1990) 
Atmospheric concentrations of CH4 have been measured 
directly since 1978 when the globally averaged value was 
1 51 ppmv (e g , Rasmussen and Khahl, 1981, Blake and 
Rowland, 1988) Currently the value is 1 72 ppmv, 
corresponding to an atmospheric reservoir of about 4900 
Tg (1 Tg = lO1^ g) dnc} n 1S increasing at a rate of 14 to 17 
ppbv per year (40 to 48 Tg per year), 1 e , 0 8 to 1 0% per 
year (Blake and Rowland 1988, Steele et al, 1987) The 
atmospheric concentration of CH4 in the Northern 
Hemisphere is 1 76 ppmv compared to 1 68 ppmv in the 
Southern Hemisphere (Figure 111) The magnitude of the 
seasonal variability varies with latitude (Steele et al 1987, 
Fraser et al 1984), being controlled by the temporal 
variability in source strengths and atmospheric con-
centration of OH radicals 
13 13 Isotopic c omposition of methane 
Methane is produced Irom diflerent sources with 
distinctive proportions of carbon , 2C '^C and 14C, and 
hydrogen isotopes H, D (2H) and T (^H) Similarly the 
rates ol processes that destroy CH4 depend upon its 
isotopic composition Consequently the CH4 budget can 
be constrained by knowledge oi the isotopic composition ot 
atmospheric CH4, the extent ot isotopic fractionation 
dunng removal, and the isotopic signaluies ol CH4 from 
different sources Recent work to elucidate the sources ot 
CH4 has proceeded through an analysis of carbon isotopic 
signatures (Cicerone and Oremland 1988 Wahlen et al 
1989, Lowe et al , 1988 and iclerences therein) One 
example of this is an analysis ot ' 4C data which suggests 
that about 100 Tg CH4 pei ycai may anse from fossil 
sources (Cicerone and Oiemland 
1988, Wahlen et al 
1989) Such a distinction is possible because CH4 Irom 
fossil sources is ^^CAret while that tiom other souices has 
essentially the ^C concentiation ol modem caibon 
1.3.2 Sinks of Methane 
The majoi sink loi atmospheric CH4 is reaction with OH in

Figure 1.11: The global distribution, seasonality and trend of 
methane from the GMCC network (Steele et al, 1987 and 
unpublished data) 
1977, Crutzen 1987) Based on the reaction rate coefficient 
between CH4 and OH, and the estimated troposphenc 
distribution ol OH an atmospheric lifetime for CH4 ol 
between 8 and 11 8 years has been estimated (Pnnn et al 
1987) This estimate is supported by the fact that models ol 
global OH are tested by analyses of the budgets for 
CH^CCh (Logan et al 1981, Fraser et al 1986a Pnnn et 
al 
1987) and 14CO (Appendix to WMO 1989b) The 
reaction between CH4 and OH currently represents a sink 
ol 400 to 600 Tg ol CH4 per year The efficiency ol this 
sink may however have decieased dunng the last centun 
because the atmospheric concentiation ot OH in the 
tiopospheie may have decieased hence the litetime ol CH4 
would have increased 
in iesponse to increasing 
concentrations o! CO NMHC and CH4 (S/e 1977)

al 
1982 and Seller and Conrad, 1987 
1.3.3 Sources of Methane 
Methane is produced from a wide variety of anaerobic 
sources (Cicerone and Oremland, 1988) 
Two main 
pathways tor CH4 production have been identified 
(1) 
leduction ol CO2 with hydrogen, fatty acids or alcohols as 
hydiogen donors, or (11) transmethylation of acetic acid or 
methyl alcohol by CH4-producing bacteria Table 1 2 
summaii/es identified sources of CH4 with ranges of likely 
annual emissions The total annual CH4 source must equal 
the atmosphenc sink ol about 500 (400 to 600) Tg CH4 per 
year the possible soil sink of about 10 (15 to 45) Tg CH4 
per year, and the annual growth of 40 to 48 Tg CH4 in the 
atmosphere The sum of the present best estimates of the 
sizes of the individual sources identified in Table 1 2 equal 
525 Tg CH4 per year It should be noted that the newest 
data lor rice paddies, biomass burning, and coal mining 
sources suggest that the values may be even less than those 
of Table I 2, possibly indicating a missing source of CH4, 
or an overestimate of the sink for CH4 
13 31 Natui al wetlands 
Significant progress has been made in quantifying the 
magnitude of the source of CH4 from natural wetlands 
(Svensson and Rosswall, 1984, Sebacher et al , 1986, 
Whalen and Reeburgh, 1988, Moore and Knowles, 1987, 
Mathews and Fung, 1987, Harriss et al , 1985, Cnll et al, 
1988, Andronova, 1990, Harriss and Sebacher, 1981, 
Burke et al , 1988, Harriss et al , 1988, Aselmann and 
Crutzen, 1989) Recent data support earlier estimates of a 
global flux of 110 - 115 Tg CH4 per year, but reverses the 
lelative importance ot tropical and high latitude systems 
(Bartlett et al , 1990) The data base, which is still quite 
limited (no data from Asia), suggests 55 Tg CH4 per year 
(previously 12 Tg CH4 per year) from tropical wetlands, 
and 39 Tg CH4 per year (previously 63 Tg CH4 per year) 
from high latitude wetlands 
Since CH4 is produced 
through biological processes under anaerobic conditions, 
any factors alfecting the physical, chemical or biological 
characteristics of soils could affect CH4 emission rates 
13 3 2 Rue paddies 
Rice paddies are an important source of CH4 with 
estimates ol the globally averaged flux ranging from 25 -
170 Tg CH4 pei yeai (Neue and Scharpenseel, 1984, Yagi 
and Minami, 1990, Holzapfel-Pschoin and Seller, 1986, 
Cicerone and Shcttci, 1981, Cicerone et al , 1983) The flux 
of CH4 from nee paddies is critically dependent upon 
I Gi eenhouse Gases and Aei owls 
21 
several factors including (1) agncultuial practices (e g , 
fertilization, water management, density of rice plants, 
double cropping systems, application ol manuie or rice 
straw), (n) soil / paddy characteristics (soil type, acidity, 
redox potential, temperature, nutrient availability, sub-
strate, profile of anaerobic environment), and (in) time of 
season One difficulty in obtaining accurate estimates is 
that almost 90% of the world s harvested area of rice 
paddies is in Asia, and of this about 60% are in China and 
India from which no detailed data are available The annual 
production of rice since 1940 has approximately doubled as 
a result of double cropping practices and an increased area 
of cultivation It is likely that CH4 emissions have 
increased proportionally as well 
I 3 1 3 Biomass bwmm> 
Biomass burning in tropical and sub tropical regions is 
thought to be a significant source of atmospheric CH4, with 
estimates of global emission rates ranging from 20 to 80 Tg 
CH4 per year (Andreae et al , 1988, Bingemer and Crutzen, 
1987, Crutzen et al, 1979, Crutzen et al , 1985, Crutzen 
1989, Greenberg et al , 1984 Stevens et al 1990 Quay et 
al , 1990) Improved estimates require an enhanced 
understanding of (1) CH4 emission factors, (11) the amount, 
by type, of vegetation burnt each year on an area basis and 
(111) type of burning (smouldenng vs flaming) Current 
estimates indicate that over the last century the rate ot 
forest clearing by burning has incieased (c f Section 
122 2) 
13 3 4 Entcnc feimentation (animals) 
Methane emissions lrom enteric fermentation in ruminant 
animals including all cattle, sheep and wild animals is 
estimated to provide an atmospheric source ot 65 - 100 Tg 
CH4 per year (Crutzen et al , 1986 Lcrner et al 
1988) 
Methane emissions depend upon animal populations as 
well as the amount and type of food It is difficult to 
estimate the change in this source over the last century 
accurately because the significant increase in the number of 
cattle and sheep has been partially offset by decreases in 
the populations of elephants and North American bison 
One estimate suggests that the magnitude of this souice has 
increased from 21 Tg CH4 per year in 1890 to 78 Tg CH4 
per year in 1983 (Crutzen et al , 1986) 
13 3 5 Teimites 
There is a large range in the magnitude of the estimated 
fluxes of CH4 from termites, 10 - 100 Tg CH4 per year 
(Cicerone and Oremland, 1988, Zimmerman et al , 1982, 
Rasmussen and Khahl, 1983, Seilci et al 
1984 Fiasci et 
al 
1986b) The values are based on the results ot 
laboiatory expenments applied to estimates of global 
termite populations and the amount of biomass consumed 
by teimites both of which aie unceitain, and field 
experiments It is important to determine whether the 
global termite population is currently increasing, and 
whether it is likely to lespond to changes in climate 
13 36 Landfills 
The anaerobic decay of organic wastes in landfills may be a 
significant anthropogenic source of atmospheric CH4, 20 -
70 Tg CH4 per year However, several factors need to be 
studied in order to quantify the magnitude of this source 
more precisely, including amounts, trends, and types of 
waste materials, and landfill practices (Bingemer and 
Crutzen, 1987) 
13 3 7 Oceans andfteshwatei s 
Oceans and freshwaters are thought to be a minor source of 
atmospheric CH4 The estimated flux of CH4 from the 
oceans is based on a limited data set taken in the late 
1960 s / early 1970 s when the atmospheric concentration of 
CH4 was about 20% lower They showed that the open 
oceans were only slightly supersaturated in CH4 with 
respect to its partial pressure in the atmosphere There are 
inadequate recent data from either the open oceans or 
coastal waters to reduce the uncertainty in these estimates 
(Cicerone and Oremland, 1988) 
13 3 8 Coal mininq 
Methane is released to the atmosphere from coal mine 
ventilation, and degassing from coal during transport to an 
end-use site A recent unpublished study estimated the flux 
of CH4 from coal mining, on a country basis, for the top 
twenty coal producing countries, and deduced a global 
minimum emission of 19 Tg CH4 per year Global CH4 
fluxes tiom coal mining have been estimated to range from 
10 - 50 Tg CH4 per year (Cicerone and Oremland 1988, 
ICF, 1990, and recent unpublished studies by others) 
13 3 9 Gas diilhnq \tntinq and tiansnnssion 
Methane is the major component of natural gas hence 
leakage from pipelines and venting from oil and gas wells 
could represent a significant source of atmospheric CH4 
(Cicerone and Oremland, 1988) The global flux from these 
sources is estimated based on limited data of questionable 
reliability, to range from 25 - 50 Tg CH4 per year 
1.3.4 Feedbacks from Climate Change into the Methane 
Cycle 
Future atmospheric concentrations of CH4 will depend on 
changes in the strengths of either the sources or sinks 
which are dependent upon social, economic, and political 
and also environmental factors and in particular changes in 
climate Methane emissions from wetlands are particularly 
sensitive to temperature and soil moisture and hence future 
climatic changes could significantly change the 1 luxes of 
CH4 from both natuial wetlands and rice paddies 
?? 
Greenhouse Gases and Aerosols 1 
Tropospheric OH, which provides the atmospheric sink for 
CH4, is dependent upon a number of factors, including the 
intensity of UV-B radiation, and the ambient con-
centrations of H2O, CO, CH4, reactive nitrogen oxides, and 
tropospheric O3 (See Section 1.7) (Crutzen, 1987; Isaksen 
and Hov, 1987; Thompson and Cicerone, 1986). 
1.3.4.1 Tropical methane sources 
The major sources of CH4 in tropical regions (natural 
wetlands and rice paddies) are quite sensitive to variations 
in soil moisture. Consequently, changes in soil moisture, 
which would result from changes in temperature and 
precipitation, could significantly alter the magnitude of 
these large sources of atmospheric CH4. Increased soil 
moisture would result in larger fluxes, whereas a decrease 
in soil moisture would result in smaller fluxes. 
1.3.4.2 High latitude methane sources 
Methane fluxes from the relatively flat tundra regions 
would be sensitive to changes of only a few centimetres in 
the level of the water table, with flooded soils producing a 
factor of 100 more CH4 than dry soils. Similarly, emissions 
of CH4 are significantly larger at warmer temperatures, due 
to accelerated microbiological decomposition of organic 
material in the near-surface soils (Whalen and Reeburgh, 
1988; Crill et al.. 1988). Consequently, an increase in soil 
moisture and temperatures in high latitude wetlands would 
result in enhanced CH4 emissions, whereas wanner dryer 
soils might have decreased CH4 emissions. 
Higher temperatures could also increase the fluxes of 
CH4 at high northern latitudes from; (i) CH4 trapped in 
permafrost, (ii) decomposable organic matter frozen in the 
permafrost, and (iii) decomposition of CH4 hydrates 
(Cicerone and Oremland, 1988; Kvenvolden, 1988; Nisbet, 
1989). Quantifying the magnitudes of these positive 
feedbacks is difficult. Time-scales for thawing the 
permafrost, located between a few centimetres to metres 
below the surface, could be decades to centuries, while the 
time for warming the CH4 hydrates could be even longer, 
although one study (Kvenvolden, 1988) estimated that the 
flux of CH4 from hydrate decomposition could reach 100 
Tg CH4 per year within a century. 
1.3.5 Conclusions 
Current atmospheric CH4 concentrations, at 1.72 ppmv, are 
now more than double the pre-industrial value (1750-1800) 
of about 0.8 ppmv, and are increasing at a rate of 0.9% per 
year. The ice core record shows that CH4 concentrations 
were about 0.35 ppmv during glacial periods, and increased 
in phase with temperature during glacial-interglacial 
transitions. The current atmospheric concentration of CH4 
is greater than at any time during the last 160,000 years. 
Reaction with OH in the troposphere, the major sink for 
CH4, results in a relatively short atmospheric lifetime of 
10±2 years. The short lifetime of CH4 implies that 
atmospheric concentrations will respond quite rapidly, in

There are a few minor differences between the lifetimes reported in this table and the equivalent table in WMO 1989b. 
These differences are well within the uncertainty limits. The 1990 mixing ratios have been estimated based upon an 
extrapolation of measurements reported in 1987 or 1988, assuming that the recent trends remained approximately 
constant.

comparison to the longer lived gases such as CO2, N2O, 
and CFCs, to changes in emissions In order to stabilize 
concentrations at present day levels, an immediate 
reduction in global man-made emissions by 15-20 percent 
would be necessary (this and other scientific sensitivity 
analyses are discussed in the Annex) Global con-
centrations of OH are dependent upon the intensity of UV-
B radiation, and the concentrations of gases such as hbO, 
CO, CH4, NOx, NMHC, and O3 and may have declined 
during the twentieth century due to changes in the 
atmospheric concentrations ol these gases 
The individual sources of atmospheric CH4 have been 
qualitatively identified, but there are significant un 
certainties in the magnitude of their strengths Human 
activities such as rice cultivation, rearing of domestic 
ruminants, biomass burning, coal mining, and natural gas 
venting have increased the input oi CH4 into the 
atmosphere, and these combined with an apparent decrease 
in the concentration of troposphenc OH, yields the 
observed rise in global CH4 However, the quantitative 
importance of each of the factors contributing to the 
observed increase is not well known at present 
Several potential feedbacks exist between climate change 
and CH4 emissions, in both tropical and high latitude 
wetland sources In particular, an increase in high latitude 
temperatures could result in a significant release of CH4 
from the melting of permafrost and decomposition of CH4 
hydrates 
1.4 Halocarbons 
Halocarbons containing chlorine and bromine have been 
shown to deplete O3 in the stratosphere In addition, it has 
been recognized that they are important greenhouse gases 
Their sources, sinks, atmospheric distributions, and role in 
perturbing stratospheric O3 and the Earth's radiative 
balance have been reviewed in detail (WMO 1985, 1989a, 
1989b) Many governments, recognizing the harmful 
effects of halocarbons on the environment, signed the 
Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone 
Layer' (UNEP 1987) in 1987 to limit the production and 
consumption of a number of fully halogenated CFCs and 
halons The control measures of the Montreal Protocol 
freeze the production and consumption of CFCs 11. 12, 
111, 114, and 115 in developed countries at their 1986 
levels from the year 1990, a reduction to 80% of their 1986 
levels from the year 1993, with a further reduction to 50% 
of their 1986 levels from the year 1998 Developing 
countries, with a per capita use of CFCs of less than 0 3 kg 
per capita, are allowed to increase their per capita use up to 
this limit and can delay compliance with the control 
measures by 10 years All major producing and consuming 
developed countries, and many developing countries, have 
signed and ratified the Montreal Protocol 
1.4.1 Atmospheric Distribution of Halocarbons 
The mean atmospheric concentrations of the most abundant 
radiatively active halocarbons are shown in Table 1 3 The 
atmospheric concentrations of the halocarbons are currently 
increasing more rapidly on a global scale (on a percentage 
24 
Gi eenlwuse Gases and Aei osols 1 
basis) than the other greenhouse gases (Figure 1 12) 
The concentrations of the fully halogenated chloro 
fluorocarbons (CFCs), slightly greater in the northern 
hemisphere than in the southern hemisphere, are consistent 
with the geographical distribution of releases (>90% from 
the industrialized nations), a 45°N - 45°S mixing time of 
about 1 year, and their very long atmospheric lifetimes 
/ .4.2 Sinks for Halocarbons 
There is no significant troposphenc removal mechanism for 
the fully halogenated halocarbons such as CCI3F (CFC-11), 
CCI2F2 (CFC 12), C2CI3F3 (CFC 113), C2CI2F4 (CFC-
114), C2CIF5 (CFC-115), carbon tetrachloride (CCI4), and 
halon 1301 (CBrF3) They have long atmospheric lifetimes 
decades to centuries, and are primarily removed by 
photodissociation in the mid - upper stiatosphere There is 
currently a significant imbalance between the sources and 
sinks giving rise to a rapid growth in atmospheric 
concentrations To stabilize the atmospheric concentiations 
ol CFCs 11, 12 and 113 at current levels would require 
reductions in emissions of approximately 70-75%, 75-85%, 
and 85-95%, respectively (see Annex) 
Non fully halogenated halocarbons containing a 
hydrogen atom such as methyl chloride (CH3CI), 
methylchloroform (CH3CCI3), CHCIF2 (HCFC-22), and a 
number of other HCFCs and HFCs being considered as 
substitutes for the current CFCs (c f Section 1 4 4) are 
pnmarily removed in the troposphere by reaction with OH 
These hydrogen containing species have atmospheric 
liletimes ranging from about one to forty years, much 
shorter on average than the fully halogenated CFCs To 
stabilize the atmospheric concentrations of HCFC-22 at 
current levels would require reductions in emissions ot 
approximately 40-50% 
1.4.3 Sources of Halocarbons 
Most halocarbons, with the notable exception of CH3CI, 
are exclusively of industrial origin Halocarbons are used as 
aerosol piopellants (CFCs 11, 12, and 114), refrigerants 
(CFCs 12 and 114, and HCFC-22) loam blowing agents 
(CFCs 11 and 12) solvents (CFC-113 CH3CCI3, and 
CCI4), and fire retardants (halons 1211 and 1301) Current 
emission fluxes are approximately CFC 11 350Gg/y CFC 
12 450 Gg/y CFC-113 150Gg/y HCFC-22 140 Gg/y, 
others are significantly smallci 
The atmosphenc 
concentration of methyl chloride is about 0 6 ppbv, and is 
pnmailly released from the oceans and during biomass 
burning There is no evidence that the atmosphenc 
conccntiation of CH3CI is increasing Methyl bromide 
(CH3Br) is produced by oceanic algae and there is 
evidence that its atmosphenc concentiation has been 
incieasing in recent times due to a significant anth-
ropogenic source (Penkett et al 1985 Wofsy et al 1975) 
1.4.4 Future Atmospheric Concentration of Halocarbons 
Future emissions of CFCs 11, 12, 113, 114, and 115 will be 
governed by the Montreal Protocol on "Substances that 
Deplete the Ozone Layer 
as discussed in Section 1 4 In 
addition, international negotiations are currently in progress 
that will likely (1) result in a complete global phase-out of 
production of these chemicals by the year 2000, and (11) 
enact limitations on the emissions (via production and 
consumption controls) of CCI4, and CH3CCI3 However, 
even with a complete cessation of production of CFCs 11, 
12 and 113 in the year 2000 their atmospheric 
concentrations will still be significant for at least the next 
century because of their long atmospheric lifetimes 
It 
should be noted that emissions of these gases into the 
atmosphere will continue for a period of time after 
production has ceased because of their uses as refrigerants, 
foam blowing agents fire retardants, etc 
A number of hydrolluorocarbons 
(HFCs) and 
hydrochloiofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are being considered as 
potential replacements for the long-lived CFCs (11, 12, 
113, 114, and 115) that aie regulated under the terms of the 
Montreal Protocol The HFCs and HCFCs primarily being 
considered include HCFC 22, HCFC-123 (CHCI2CF3), 
HCFC 124 (CHCIFCF3), HFC 125 (CHF2CF3), HFC-
134a (CH2FCF3), HCFC-141b (CH3CCI2F), HCFC-142b 
(CH3CCIF2), HFC 143a (CH3CF3), and HFC-152a 
(CH3CHF2) The calculated atmospheric lifetimes of these 
chemicals are controlled primarily by reaction with 
troposphenc OH and range between about 1 and 40 years 
It has been estimated (UNEP 1989) that a mix of HFCs 
and HCFCs will replace the CFCs currently in use at a rate 
of about 0 4 kg of substitute for every kg of CFCs currently 
produced, with an annual growth rate of about 3% 
Because of their shorter lifetimes, and expected rates of 
substitution and emissions growth rates, the atmospheric 
concentrations of HFCs and HCFCs will be much lower for 
the next several decades than if CFCs had continued to be 
used, even at current rates However, continued use, 
accompanied by growth in the emission rates of HFCs and 
HCFCs for more than several decades would result in 
atmospheric concentrations that would be radiatively 
important 
1.4.5 Conclusions 
The atmospheric concentrations of the industrially-
produced halocarbons, primarily CCI3F, CCI2F2, 
C2CI3F3, and CCI4 are about 280 pptv, 484 pptv, 60 pptv, 
and 146 pptv, respectively Over the past few decades their 
concentrations (except CCI4) have increased more rapidly 
(on a percentage basis) than the other greenhouse gases, 
currently at rates ol at least 4% per year The fully 
halogenated CFCs and CCI4 arc primarily removed by 
photolysis in the stratosphere and have atmospheric 
lifetimes in excess ol 50 years 
/ Gi eenhouse Gases and Aei osols 
25 
Most halocarbons, with the notable exception of methyl 
chloride, are exclusively anthropogenic and their sources 
(solvents, refrigerants, foam blowing agents, and aerosol 
propellants) are well understood. 
To stabilize, and then reduce, the current atmospheric 
concentrations of the fully halogenated CFCs (e.g , 11, 12 
and 113) would require approximate reductions in 
emissions of 70-75%, 75-85%, and 85-95%, respectively. 
Future emissions of CFCs and CCI4 will, most likely, be 
eliminated or be significantly lower than today's because 
the stringency, scope, and timing ol 
international 
regulations on chlorine and bromine containing chemicals, 
(i.e., the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the 
Ozone Layer) are currently being renegotiated. However, 
the atmospheric concentrations ol CFCs 11, 12 and 113 
will still be significant (30 - 40% of current) for at least the 
next century because of their long atmospheric lifetimes.

1.5 Nitrous Oxide 
Nitrous oxide is a chemically and radiatively active trace 
gas that is produced from a wide variety of biological 
sources in soils and water and is primarily removed in the 
stratosphere by photolysis and reaction with electronically 
excited oxygen atoms. 
1.5.1 Atmospheric 
Distribution 
of Nitrous 
Oxide 
The mean atmospheric concentration of N2O in 1990 is 
about 310 ppbv, corresponding to a reservoir of about 1500 
TgN, and increasing at a rate of 0 2 - 0.3% per year (Figure 
1 13, Weiss, 1981;Pnnnetal, 1990; Robinson et al., 1988; 
Elkins and Rossen, 1989, Rasmussen and Khalil, 1986). 
This observed rate of increase represents an atmospheric 
growth rate of about 3 to 4.5 TgN per year. The 
atmospheric concentration of N2O is higher in the Northern 
Hemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere by about 1 
ppbv 
Ice coie measurements show that the pre-industnal 
value of N2O was relatively stable at about 285 ppbv for 
most of the past 2000 years, and started to increase around 
the year 1700 (Figure 1 14, Pearman et al , 1986, Khalil 
and Rasmussen, 1988b, Ethendge et al , 1988; Zardini et 
al , 1989) 
Figure 1.14 shows that the atmospheric 
concentrations of N2O may have decreased by a few ppbv 
during the period of the "Little Ice Age"

1.5.2 Sinks for Nitrous 
Oxide 
The major 
atmospheric 
loss process 
for 
N2O is 
photochemical decomposition in the stratosphere, and is 
calculated to be 10± 3 Tg N per year (Table 1 4) Nitrous 
oxide has an atmospheric lifetime ol about 150 years The 
obseived uite of growth represents a 30% imbalance 
between the sources and sinks (Hao ct al , 1987) 
Troposphenc sinks such as surface loss in aquatic and soil 
7.5.3 Sources of Nitrous 
Oxide 
15 3 1 Oceans 
The oceans are a significant, but not dominant source of 
N2O (McElroy and Wofsy, 1986) Based on measurements 
ol the concentration gradients between the atmosphere and 
surface waters (Butler et al., 1990, and NOAA GMCC 
unpublished data), and on estimates of the gas exchange 
coefficient, the current estimate of the magnitude of the

ocean source ranges from 1 4 - 2 6 Tg N per year, 
significantly lower than earlier estimates (Elkins et al , 
1978, Cohen and Gordon, 1979, Chne et al , 1987) An 
accurate determination of the global annual ocean flux is 
difficult 
because of uncertainties associated with 
quantifying the gas exchange coefficient and because the 
paitial pressure of N2O in the surface waters is highly 
vanable, both spatially and temporally The partial pressure 
ot N2O in surface waters varies considerably, ranging from 
being supersaturated by up to 40% in upwelling regions to 
being undersaturated by a few percent in areas around 
Antarctica and within gyres Data suggest that during El 
Nino events when upwelling in the Pacific ocean is 
suppiesscd the ocean fluxes of N2O are significantly lower 
(Chne et al 
1987, Butler et al , 1990) It is still unclear 
whether N?0 is primarily produced from nitrification in 
near surtace waters, or denitnfication in oxygen deficient 
deep waters Based on vertical profile measurements of 
oceanic NoO (NOAA GMCC, unpublished) the oceanic 
rescrvon has been estimated to be between 900 and 1100 
Tg N comparable to the atmosphere 
Consequently, 
changes in the exchange fluxes of N2O between the ocean 
and the atmosphere could have a significant impact on its 
atmospheric concentration 
n u Soils 
Denitnlication in aerobic soils is thought to be a dominant 
source of atmospheric NoO (Keller et al , 1986, Matson 
and Vitousek, 1987, Matson and Vitousek 1989, Slemr et 
al 1984) Nitrification under anaerobic conditions could. 
however, produce higher yields of N2O per unit of 
transformed nitrogen Quantification ol global N2O 
emissions from soils is difficult 
because of the 
heterogeneity of terrestrial ecosystems and the variability in 
environmental conditions that control the fluxes of N2O 
Estimates of global fluxes of N2O from tropical forests 
range from 2 2 - 3 7 Tg N per year The impact of 
deforestation on the emissions of N2O from tropical soils is 
unclear, with some studies suggesting that the emissions of 
N2O from deforested land are enhanced by as much as a 
factor of three (Luizao et al , 1990), whereas other studies 
concluded that N2O fluxes decreased if vegetation did not 
return (Robertson and Tiedje, 1988) 
Quantifying the roles of temperate forest soils and 
grasslands in the N2O budget is difficult because of the 
paucity of data, and conflicting results Estimates of N2O 
fluxes from temperate forest soils range from 0 7 - 1 5 Tg 
N per year in one study (Schmidt et al , 1988), to almost 
none in another study (Bowden et al , 1990) One study 
also reported that deforestation in temperate forests would 
lead to enhanced emissions of N2O (Bowden and 
Bormann, 1986) Reliable global N2O fluxes from 
grasslands are impossible to derive from the fragmented 
data available One study (Ryden, 1981) concluded that 
English grassland soils, with no fertilization, are a sink for 
N2O, whereas limited studies of tropical grasslands and 
pastures suggest that they may be a moderate to significant 
source of N2O (Luizao et al , 1990, Robertson and Tiedje, 
1988) 
15 3 3 Combustion 
Until recently, the combustion of fossil fuels was thought to 
be an important source of atmospheric N2O (Pierotti and 
Rasmussen, 1976, Weiss and Craig, 1976, Hao et al , 
1987) However, a recent study has shown that the earlier 
results are incorrect because N2O was being artificially 
produced in the flasks being used to collect N2O from 
combustion sources (Muzio and Kramlich, 1988) The 
latest estimate of the global flux of N2O from combustion 
sources is between 0 1 and 0 3 Tg N per year, compared to 
earlier values which were as high as 3 2 Tg N per year 
15 3 4 Biomass bin nnu> 
Biomass burning is now thought to be a minor source of 
atmospheric N2O with a global flux of less than 0 2 Tg N 
per year (Muzio and Kramlich, 1988, Crutzen 1989, Elkins 
et al , 1990, Winstead et al , 1990, Griffith et al , 1990) 
This value is 1-2 orders of magnitude less than previous 
estimates (Crutzen et al , 1979, 1985) which were inf-
luenced by artifacts involving N2O analysis (Crutzen et al, 
1985) and N2O production in sampling flasks (Muzio and 
Kramlich, 1988)

27 
153 5 Feitilizei I Giound-Watei 
Nitrous oxide production from the use of nitrate and 
ammonium fertilizers is difficult to quantify because the 
N2O fluxes are dependent upon numerous factors including 
type of fertilizer, soil type, soil temperature, weather, and 
farming practices (e g , ploughing, sowing, irrigating) 
Conversion of fertilizer N to N2O ranges from 0 01-2 0% 
(Conrad et al , 1983, Bremner et al , 1981) This range, 
coupled with a global fertilizer production of 55 Tg N per 
year in 1980, results in a total N2O emission of between 
0 01-1 1 Tg N per year (Conrad et al, 1983) Leaching of 
nitrogen fertilizers from soils into groundwater may result 
in additional fluxes of N2O up to 1 1 Tg N per year 
(Conrad et al, 1983, Ronen et al, 1988) Consequently, a 
range of 0 01 - 2 2 Tg N per year can be derived for the 
flux of N2O from fertilizer use 
1.5.4 Conclusions 
Nitrous oxide is a greenhouse gas whose atmospheric 
concentration, at 310 ppbv, is now about 8% greater than in 
the pre-industnal era, and is increasing at a rate of about 
0 2 - 0 3 % per year, corresponding to about 3 - 4 5 Tg N 
per year This represents an excess of 30% of current global 
emissions over current sinks The major sink, for N2O is 
photolysis in the stratosphere, resulting in a relatively long 
atmospheric lifetime of about 150 years The magnitude of 
the sink for N2O is relatively well known (± 30%) In order 
to stabilize concentrations at present day levels, an 
immediate reduction of 70 80% of the additional flux of 
N2O that has occurred since the pre-industnal era would be 
necessary 
Quantification of the various natural and anthropogenic 
sources is uncertain Since the latest studies indicate that 
the total combined flux ol N2O irom combustion and 
biomass burning is between 0 1 to 0 5 Tg N per year in 
contrast to earlier estimates of about 5 Tg N per year, and 
production of N2O from fertilizer (including groundwater) 
is believed to be less than or equal to 2 2 Tg N per year, it 
is difficult to account for the annual increase based on 
known sources Stimulation of biological production due to 
agricultural development may account lor the missing 
anthropogenic emissions Estimates of the removal rate of 
N2O by photodissociation in the stratosphere range from 7 
- 13 Tg N per year Therefore, the total source needed to 
account for the observed annual atmospheric growth is 10 -
17 5 Tg N per year against a flux of N2O from known 
sources of 4 4 - 10 5 Tg N per year These data suggest that 
there are missing sources ol N2O, or the strengths of some 
ot the identified sources have been underestimated 
Despite these uncertainties, it is believed that the observed 
increase in N2O concentrations is caused by human 
activities 
1.6 Stratospheric Ozone 
Stratospheric O3 is an important constituent of the Earth s 
atmosphere 
It protects the Earth's surface from harmful 
solar ultraviolet radiation and it plays an important role in 
controlling the temperature structure of the stratosphere by 
absorbing both incoming solar ultraviolet radiation and 
outgoing terrestrial (longwave) radiation Part of the 
absorbed outgoing longwave radiation is then re-radiated 
back to the surface-troposphere system Reductions in 
stratospheric O3 can modify the surface temperature via 
two competing processes 
more solar radiation is 
transmitted to the suriace-troposphere system, thereby 
contributing to a surface warming, on the other hand, the 
cooler stratosphere (due to decreased solar and long-wave 
absorption) emits less to the troposphere which would tend 
to cool the surface The solar warming (a function of total 
column amount of O3) and longwave cooling (a function of 
the vertical distribution of O3) are similar in magnitude 
Therefore, the magnitude as well as the sign of the change 
in surface temperature depends critically on the magnitude 
of the O3 change, which in turn is depends strongly on 
altitude, latitude and season 
The concentration and distribution of stratospheric O3 is 
controlled by dynamical, radiative and photochemical 
processes Stratospheric O3 is photochemically controlled 
by chemically active species in the (1) oxygen, (11) 
hydrogen, (111) nitrogen, (IV) chlorine, and (v) bromine 
families The precursors for the photochemically active 
species are (1) O2, (11) H2O and CH4, (111) N2O, (iv) CFCs, 
CCI4, CH3CCI3, CH3CI, and (v) halons and CHiBr, 
respectively 
1.6.1 Stratospheric Ozone Trends 
16 11 Total c olumn ozone ti ends 
The Antarctic ozone hole, which formed during the mid to 
late 1970s, recurs every springtime To determine O3 
trends more widely, data from the ground-based Dobson 
network have been re-evaluated, station by station, and 
used to determine changes in total column O3 over the past 
two decades Unfortunately, the network and data are 
adequate for only a limited geographical region, 1e . 30 -
64°N They are inadequate to determine total column O3 
changes in the Arctic, tropics, subtropics, or southern 
hemisphere apart from Antarctica Satellite data can 
provide the desired global coverage, but the current record 
is too short (about one solar cycle, 1978 to present) to 
differentiate between the effects of natural and human 
influenced processes on O3 The re evaluated data was 
analysed for the effects of known natural geophysical 
processes (seasonal variation, the approximately 26-month 
quasi-biennial-osullation, and the 11-ycar solar cycle) and 
possible human perturbations After allowing for natural 
variability, the analyses, using a variety of statistical 
models and assumptions, showed measurable zonal mean

Concentrations of O3 tend to be smaller in the tropics 
than in mid-latitudes, except in the dry season 
when 
emissions of O3 precursors from biomass burning provide 
a photochemical source (Delany et al, 1985, Crutzen et al, 
1985, Logan and Kirchhoft 
1986 Fishman et al 
1990) 
Ozone values during the southern spring over South

industrialized mid-latitudes in s ummer 
Lai ge regions

the 1970s appear to be about twice those found between

an increase of 1 - 2% per year from the mid-1950s to the 
early 1980s, with increases in winter and summer (Feister 
and Warmbt, 1987, Bojkov, 1988) Since the mid-1970s 
O3 has increased by 0 8% per year at remote sites in 
Alaska and Hawaii, shown no annual trend at Samoa, but 
has decreased by 0 5% per year at the South Pole (Oltmans 
et al, 1988) Decreases of 1 8% per year are found at both 
Samoa and South Pole in summer Trend data are lacking 
for tropical continental sites 
Ozonesonde data for northern mid-latitudes between 
1965 and 1986 suggest that O3 has increased by about \c/c 
per year below 8 km, primarily over North Europe and 
Japan (Angell and Korshover, 1983, Logan 1985, Tiao et 
al, 1986, WMO, 1989a,b), but there are no clear trends in 
the upper troposphere By contrast O3 has decreased in the 
lower stratosphere (below 25 km), the crossovei in the 
trend being near the tropopause There is no tiend in O3 at 
the single sonde station at southern mid-latitudes, and long 
term sonde data are lacking in the tropics

Relationships 
betw een ozone and its pi ei in soi s 
The concentration of troposphenc O3 is dependent in a 
very non-linear manner on the atmospheric concentrations 
of its precursor gases, 1 e , CO, CH4, NMHC, and, in 
particular NO x (NO x = NO + NO2) 
Nitrogen oxide 
concentrations and trends control changes in the con 
centiation of O3 (Dignon and Hameed 1985) At low NO x 
concentrations (where NO x is less than 5 - 30 pptv this 
threshold depends on the concentrations of O3 and 
hydrocarbons) increases in CO CH4 and NMHC lead to a 
decicase in O3 wheieas at high NO x 
concentiations 
increases in CO CH4 and NMHC lead to signilicant 
enhancements in O3 Therefore no simple lelationship 
exists between increases in the piecursor gases and changes 
in troposphenc O3 Several model calculations have been 
performed to investigate the sensitivity ol O3 changes to 
changes in the precuisoi gases both individually and 
collectivel} All models that ha\e attempted to simulate 
changes in O3 during the past century have calculated 
incieases in Northern Hemispheie O3 by up to a factoi of 
two broadl} consistent with obseivations, depending upon 
the assumptions made regarding the initial concentration

CH4, CO, and NMHC (Crutzen, 1987, Thompson et al , 
1989) Prediction of regional and global trends in OH 
concentrations requires an understanding ol regional 
emissions of CH4, CO, NMHC and NOx, as well as 
transport of O3 between its source regions and the remote 
troposphere One key point is that a continued increase in 
levels ol CO would reduce the global concentration ol OH 
because NOx is too short-lived to counteract that effect 
over much of the globe This would increase the atmos-
pheric lifetime of CH4 
1.7.2 Carbon Monoxide 
172 1 Atmosphei u distnbutum of caiban monoxide 
The atmospheric concentration of CO exhibits signiticant 
spatial and temporal variability because of its short 
atmospheric lifetime (2-3 months) The short atmospheric 
lifetime, coupled with an inadequate monitoring network, 
means that the global spatial variability and long-term 
trends in CO are not well documented The limited 
observational data base (Heidt et al, 1980, Dianov-Klokov 
and Yuiganov, 1981, Seller and Fishman, 1981, Seller et 
al, 1984, Khdhl and Rasmussen, 1984, 1988a, Fraser et al, 
1986a, c, Newell et al , 1989, Zander et al , 1989, 
Kuchhoir and Mannho, 1989, Kirchhotf et al , 1989) has 
demonstrated that the concentration of CO, (1) is about a 
factoi ol two gieater in the Northern than in the Southern 
Hemisphere where the annual average is about 50 - 60 
ppbv, (11) increases with latitude in the Northern 
Hemisphere, (111) exhibits strong seasonal variations in both 
hemispheres at mid to high latitudes, and (IV) decreases 
with altitude CO appears to be increasing at about 1% per 
year in the Northern Hemisphere, but the evidence for 
increases in the Southern Hemisphere is ambiguous 
17 2 2 Sowc es and sinks of catbon monoxide 
The total annual source of CO is about 2400 Tg CO, being 
about equally divided between direct anthropogenic 
(incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and biomass) and 
atmospheric (oxidation ol natural and anthropogenic CH4 
and NMHC) souices (Logan et al 1981, Cicerone, 1988) 
Atmospheric concentrations of CO may have increased in 
the Northern Hemisphere because of the fossil fuel source, 
and because of changes in the rate of oxidation ol CH4, 
whose atmospheric concentration has increased since pre-
mdustnal times Fossil fuel sources of CO are at present 
decreasing in North America (EPA, 1989) and possibly in 
Europe, but may be increasing elsewhere 
The major removal process for atmospheric CO is 
reaction with OH (Logan et al 
1981) The observed 
seasonal variability in the Southern Hemisphere distant 
from seasonally varying sources can be explained by the 
seasonal variability in the concentration ol troposphenc 
OH Soils may provide a minor sink for CO (Comad and 
Seller. 1985) 
1.7.3 Reactive Nitrogen Oxides 
The key constituents ol troposphenc NOy, defined as the 
sum of all nitrogen oxide species except for N2O, are 
NO x, nitric acid (HNO^), peroxyacetylnitrate (PAN 
CH3CO3NO?), and organic nitrates Most primary sources 
of nitrogen oxides release NOx (mainly NO), the other 
species are produced by photochemical reactions in the 
atmosphere While the atmospheric lifetime of NOx is 
short (about 1 day), the atmospheric lifetime of NOy can 
range up to several weeks Thus NOy can transport 
nitrogen compounds away from source regions to more 
remote locations, where photolysis of HNO3 and PAN, and 
theimal decomposition of PAN, can regenerate NOx 
17 11 Atmosphei ic distnbutum of nitioqen oxides 
The atmospheric concentrations of NOx exhibit significant 
spatial and temporal variability, reflecting the complex 
distribution of sources and the short atmospheric lifetime 
The near surface and free troposphenc concentrations of 
NOx each vaiy by several orders of magnitude, highly 
influenced by the proximity ol source regions Near surface 
conccntiations of NOx range from as low as 0 001 ppbv in 
remote maritime air to as high as 10 ppbv in Europe and 
Eastern Noith Amenca (excluding urban areas), while free 
troposphenc concentrations range from 0 02 ppbv in 
remote regions to more than 5 ppbv over populated areas 
(Fehsenfeld et al, 1988) 
The spatial inhomogeneity, coupled with a sparsity of 
measurements, means that the spatial and temporal 
distribution and long-term trends in NOx and NOy are not 
adequately documented, although reconstructed emissions 
inventories of NOx suggest large increases throughout this 
century (Dignon and Hameed, 1989) Data from a 
Greenland ice core have shown that the concentration of 
nitrate ions (dissolved nitrate from HNO3) remained 
constant from 10,000 years ago to about 1950, then 
doubled by the late 1970s, consistent with the increase in 
industrial emissions (Neftel et al 1985b) Data from glacier 
ice in Switzerland indicates that nitrate ions increased by a 
factor ol 4 5 between 1900 and the 1970's in Western 
Europe (Wagenbach et al 1988) 
17 3 2 Souices and sinks of nitioqen oxides 
The sources of atmospheric NOx are about equally divided 
between anthropogenic (combustion of fossil fuels 21 Tg 
N per year, and biomass burning 2 - 5 Tg N per yeai), and 
natural (microbial processes in soils 20 Tg N per year, 
lightning 2 - 8 Tg N per yeai, and transport from the 
stratosphere 1 Tg N per year) (Galbally, 1989) Emissions 
ol NOx (6 3 Tg N pei yeai) from the combustion ol fossil 
fuels have not increased in North America since 1970 
(EPA, 1989) Soil emissions ol NO are stimulated by 
agricultural activity (e g , addition of fertilizer, manure, 
1 Gi eenhouse Gases and Aei osols 
31 
etc ), hence, agricultural soil emissions may provide 
significant sources of NOx in many areas 
The dominant removal processes for NOx are (1) 
conversion to HNO3, PAN, and organic nitrates by 
photochemical mechanisms, (11) reactions involving NO3 
radicals, and possibly (111) deposition of NO2 on veg-
etation The resulting NOy species are then removed from 
the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition, or by conversion 
back to NOx 
1.7.4 Non-Methane Hydrocarbons 
174 1 Atmosphei u 
disti ibution 
of 
non-methane 
hydiocaibons 
The NMHC can be classified by atmospheric lifetime (1) 
relatively long-lived (lifetimes > week) where the highest 
concentrations (up to 3 ppbv for ethane) are observed at 
middle to high northern latitudes, (11) more reactive 
(lifetimes between half a day and one week) such as C2 -
C5 alkenes whose concentrations exhibit significant 
temporal and latitudinal variability from <0 lppbv in 
remote areas to a few ppbv close to source regions, and (111) 
extremely short lived (lifetimes of hours) such as terpenes 
or isoprene whose local concentrations may reach about 10 
ppbv very close to their sources Trends in the atmospheric 
concentrations of NMHC have not been established due to 
a lack of measurements 
17 4 2 Sonices and sinks j01 non methane Indiocaibons 
The oceans are a major source of NMHC. mainly alkenes 
Estimates of the source strength of ethene and propene 
range from 26 Tg C per year (Bonsang et al . 1988) to as 
high as 100 Tg C per year (Penkett, 1982) Emissions of 
NMHC from terrestrial vegetation are dependent upon 
environmental factors as well as the type of vegetation 
Isoprene is primarily emitted from deciduous plants, 
whereas conifer trees aie primarily a souice of terpenes 
Isoprene and terpene emission rates are very large, about 
500 Tg per year for each (Rasmussen and Khahl, 1988) 
The souice strength of NMHC from anthiopogenic 
activities such as biomass burning, solvents and tossil fuel 
combustion has been estimated to be about 100 Tg per 
year 
The dominant loss mechanism foi most NMHC is lapid 
(much faster than CH4) reaction with OH The products of 
these reactions are capable of forming O3 in the presence 
ofNOx 
7.7.5 Feedbacks Between Climate and the Methane/Non-
Methane Hydrocarbon/ Carbon Monoxide/Oxides 
of Nitrogen/ Tropospheric Ozone System 
There arc numeious potentially impoitant feedbacks 
between climate change and tropospheric O3 and OH 
Changes in cloud cover, precipitation and circulation 
patterns, as well as changes in the biosphenc souice 
strengths of CH4, CO, NMHC and NOx, will induce 
changes in homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions 
controlling 
O3 and OH 
In addition, changes in 
stratospheric O3 may induce changes in tropospheric 
processes, through changes in ultraviolet radiation 
Stratospheric O3 depletion is likely to increase trop-
ospheric O3 when the levels of CO, NOx, and NMHC are 
high, but reduce it in regions of very low NOx The 
importance of these feedback processes remains to be 
determined 
7.7.6 Conclusions 
Tropospheric O3 is a greenhouse gas that is produced 
photochemically through a series of complex reactions 
involving CO, CH4, NMHC and NOx 
Hence, the 
distribution and trends of tropospheric O3 depend upon the 
distribution and trends of these gases whose atmospheric 
concentrations are changing 
The short atmospheric lifetimes of O3 (several weeks), 
and many of its precursor gases, coupled with inadequate 
observational networks, leave their distributions and trends 
inadequately documented Most data support positive 
trends of about 1% per year for O3 below 8 km altitude in 
the Northern Hemisphere (consistent with positive trends in 
several of the precursor gases, especially NOx, CH4, and 
CO), and a similar trend for CO in the Northern 
Hemisphere, but not in the Southern Hemisphere While 
there is no systematic series of data that allow quantitative 
estimates of trends in NMHC and NOx to be made, their 
atmospheric concentrations are likely to have increased 
during the past few decades because of increased 
anthropogenic sources The ice core records of nitrate 
levels provide indirect evidence for a Northern Hemisphere 
increase in atmospheric NOx 
1.8 Aerosol Particles 
1.8.1 Concentrations and Trends of Aerosol Particles in 
the Troposphere 
Aerosol particles play an important role in the climate 
system because of their direct interaction (absorption and 
scattering) with solar and terrestrial radiation, as well as 
through their influence on cloud processes and thereby, 
indirectly, on radiative fluxes 
These processes are 
discussed in more detail in Sections 2 3 2 and 2 3 3 Two 
separate issues should be identified The first is the effect 
of increasing or decreasing anthropogenic emissions of 
aerosol particles and their precursors in regions impacted 
by these emissions The second is the role of feedback 
processes linking climate change and natural (biological) 
pioduction ol particles in unpolluted regions, especially 
over the oceans (cf Section 10 8 3)

tioposphere to 1 mg nr^ in desert dust outbreaks or in 
dense plumes from lor example, forest fires In a typical 
sample of continental air, mineral dust, sulphuric acid, 
ammonium sulphate as well as organic material and 
elemental carbon (soot) may be found both as pure or 
mixed particles Most of the soluble particles become 
solution droplets at relative humidities above 80%, thus the 
radiative properties of aerosol particles even vary with 
relative humidity at constant dry aerosol mass 
A large part of the aerosol mass in submicron size 
particles is derived from gas-to-particle conversion through 
photochemical processes involving gaseous sulphur and 
hydrocaibon compounds Such conversion may take place 
thiough photochemical processes involving the oxidation 
ol sulphur dioxide (SO2) and other sulphur gases to 
sulphuric acid (H2SO4) by reaction with OH The H2SO4 
so lormed, having a low equilibrium vapoui pressure, 
immediately condenses onto existing aerosol particles or 
lorms new ones Transformation to sulphuric acid and 
sulphate also takes place in cloud droplets, the majority ol 
which eventually evaporate leaving the sulphate in the 
aerosol phase Trends in the emission of these gaseous 
precursors especially the sulphur gases, are therelore of 
great importance for the regional aerosol burden and 
thereby potentially lor climate 
Large quantities of aerosol particles are also emitted 
from the burning ol savannas and forests in tropical 
regions The directly emitted particles consist largely of 
carbonaceous materials including black carbon (soot) 
(Andreae et al 
1988) In addition particles are formed 
from precursor gases like SO? and hydrocarbons emitted 
by fires 
The average troposphenc lifetime of aerosol particles 
and of their precursor gases is of the order of only days or 
weeks This is much shorter than the lifetime of most 
greenhouse gases It implies that the atmospheric loading at 
any one time reflects the emissions that have taken place 
during the past tew weeks only No long-term acc-
umulation in the troposphere is thus possible and any 
reduction in anthropogenic emissions will immediately 
result in a corresponding reduction in troposphenc 
concentrations The short lifetime also implies large spatial 
and temporal variability in the concentrations of aerosol 
particles 
It has been established from analyses of Greenland ice 
cores that the amounts of sulphate, nitrate and tiace metals 
denved mainly from atmospheric aerosols have been 
increasing since industrialisation began (Neftel et al 
1985b Mayewsky et al, 1986) However, there are almost 
no long-term, continuous direct observations of aerosol 
parameters in the atmosphere outside urban and industrial 
areas (Charlson 1988) Indirect evidence from visibility 
observations indicates that the concentration of submicron 
aerosols over much of the eastern part of the U S has 
increased during the period 1948-1978 (Husaret al, 1981) 
Another example of a trend analysis of atmospheric 
aerosols is due to Winkler and Kaminski (1988), who 
concluded that submicrometer aerosol mass outside 
Hamburg has increased by a factor of nearly two between 
1976 and 1988 due to long range transport from 
industrialized centres in the region 
The hypothesis by Charlson et al (1987) of a connection 
between climate and phytoplankton activity in ocean 
surface waters is based on the role played by soluble 
aerosol particles in determining the microphysical 
properties of clouds The proposed chmate-phytoplankton 
feedback rests on the facts that cloud condensation nucleus 
(CCN) concentrations in air are low over oceans far from 
land, that the CCN available in clean maritime air are 
composed almost totally of sulphate particles, and that this 
sulphur originates almost entirely from emissions of 
reduced sulphur gases (principally dimethylsulphide 
(DMS)) from the ocean surface There is a significant non-
lineanty in the effect on cloud microphysics of given 
changes in CCN concentration, depending on the starting 
CCN concentration characteristics of clean oceanic air 
There is abundant evidence in the literature to confirm 
the role played by CCN concentration in determining cloud 
droplet size distribution However, at this stage neither the 
sign nor magnitude of the proposed climate feedback can 
be quantitatively estimated, though preliminary cal-
culations based on plausible scenarios indicate that this 
hypothesis merits careful consideration 
Preliminary 
attempts to test this hypothesis using existing historical 
data of various types have been inadequate and have 
yielded only equivocal conclusions 
1.8.2 The Atmospheric Sulphur Budget 
Current estimates of the global sulphur cycle show that 
anthropogenic emissions of SO2 are likely to be at least as 
large as natural emissions of volatile sulphur species, cf 
Table 1 5 (based essentially on Andreae, 1989) Within the 
industrialized regions of Europe and North America, 
anthropogenic emissions dominate over natural emissions 
by about a factor of ten or even more (Galloway et al, 
1984, Rodhe, 1976) The anthropogenic SO2 emissions 
have increased from less than 3 TgS per year globally in 
1860, 15 in 1900, 40 in 1940 and about 80 in 1980 
(Ryaboshapko 1983) It is evident from these numbers that 
the sulphur fluxes through the atmosphere have increased 
very substantially during the last century, especially in the 
Northern Hemisphere 
During the past decade the 
anthropogenic sulphur emissions in North America and 
parts of Europe have started to decline 
Small amounts of carbonyl sulphide (COS) aic also 
emitted into the atmosphere They do not significantly 
affect the sulphur balance of the troposphere but they are

The uncertainty ranges are estimated to be 
about 30% for the anthropogenic flux and a 
factor of two for the natural fluxes 
important in maintaining an aerosol layer in the 
stratosphere 
Because of the limited atmospheric lifetime of most 
sulphur compounds, the augmentation of the sulphur 
concentrations brought about by industrialization is not 
evenly distributed around the globe This is illustrated by 
Figure 1 16, which shows an estimate of how much more 
aerosol sulphate there is at present in the lower atmosphere 
(900 hPa level) than in the pre-industnal situation (Langner 
and Rodhe 1990) Over the most polluted regions of 
Europe and North America the sulphate levels have gone 
up by more than a factor ot 10 Smaller increases have 
occurred over large parts ot the oceans 
1.8.3 Aerosol Particles in the Stratosphere 
The vertical profile of aerosol particle concentration 
normally exhibits a marked decline up through the 
troposphere followed by a secondary maximum in the 
lower stratosphere at around 20 km The stratospheric 
aerosol layer is maintained by an upward flux of gaseous 
precursors, mainly 
carbonyl 
sulphide 
(COS) 
Concentrations may be greatly enhanced over large areas 
for a few years following large volcanic eruptions, such as 
El Chichon in 1982 No significant trends have been 
detected in the global background aerosol layer in the 
stratosphere during periods of low volcanic activity 
(WMO, 1989a) The potential impact on climate of 
stratospheric aerosols is discussed in Section 2 3 2 
1.8.4 Conclusions 
Aerosol particles have a lifetime of at most a few weeks in 
the 
troposphere 
and 
occur 
in 
highly 
vanable 
concentrations A large proportion of the particles which 
influence cloud processes and for radiative balance are 
derived from gaseous sulphur emissions These emissions 
have more than doubled globally, causing a large increase 
in the concentration of aerosol sulphate especially over and 
around the industrialized regions in Europe and North 
America If anthropogenic sulphur emissions are indeed a 
major 
contributor to cloud 
condensation 
nuclei 
concentrations on a global scale, then any climate 
prediction must take account of future trends in regional 
and global anthropogenic sulphur emission, which may be 
quite different from those of the greenhouse gases 
Aerosol particles derived from natural (biological) 
emissions may contribute in important ways to climate 
feedback processes During a few years following major 
volcanic eruptions the concentration of aerosol particles 
can be greatly enhanced

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
1 The climate of the Earth is affected by changes in radiative 
forcing due to several sources (known as radiative forcing agents) 
these include the concentrations of radiatively active (greenhouse) 
gases, solar radiation, aerosols and albedo In addition to their 
direct radiative effect on climate, many gases produce indirect 
effects on global radiative forcing 
2 The major contributor to increases in iadiative forcing due to 
increased concentrations of greenhouse gases since pre industrial 
times is carbon dioxide (COo) (6190 
with substantial 
contributions from methane (CH4) (17%) nitrous oxide (N2O) 
(4%) and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) (12%) Stratospheric water 
vapour increases, which are expected to result from methane 
emissions, contribute 6%, although evidence for changes in 
concentration is based entirely on model calculations 
The contribution from changes in troposphenc and stratospheric 
ozone is difficult to estimate, increased levels ol troposphenc 
ozone may have caused 10% of the total forcing since pre 
industrial times Decreases in lower stratospheric ozone may have 
decreased radiative forcing in recent decades 
3 The most recent decadal increase in radiative forcing is 
attributable to CO2 (56%), CH4 (11%), N2O (6%) and 
CFCs(24%), stratospheric H2O is estimated to have contributed 
4% 
4 Using the scenario A ("business-as-usual 
case) of future 
emissions derived by IPCC WG3, calculations show the following 
forcing from pre industrial values (and percentage contribution to 
total) by the year 2025 
C02 2 9 Wm-2 (63%), CH4 0 7Wm2(15%), N20 0 2 
Wm 2 (4%), 
CFCs and HCFCs 0 5 Wm 2 (11%), 
stratospheric H20 0 2Wm 2 (5%) 
The total, 4 6 Wm 2 corresponds to an effective CCb amount of 
more than double the pre-industnal value 
5 An index is developed which allows the c li mate effects of 
the emissions 
of greenhouse gases to be compaied This is 
termed the Global Wanning Potential (GWP) The GWP depends 
on the position and strength of the absorption bands ol the gas its 
lifetime in the atmospheie its moleculai weight and the time 
period over which the climate effects are ol concern A number 
of simplifications arc used to derive values for GWPs and the 
values presented heie should be considered as pieliniinai) It is 
quoted here as id ilive to CO2 
Over a 500 year time period, the GWP of equal mass emissions 
of the gases is as follows 
C 0 2 1, CH4 9, 2O 190, CFC 11 1500, CFC-12 
4500, HCFC-22 510 
Over a 20 year time period, the corresponding figures are 
CO2 1, CH4 63, N2O 270, CFC-11 4500, CFC 12 
7100, HCFC-22 4100 
Values for other gases are given in the text 
There are many 
uncertainties associated with this analysis, for example the 
atmospheric lifetime of CO2 is not well characterized The GWPs 
can be applied by considering actual emissions of the greenhouse 
gases 
For example, 
considering 
anthropogenic 
emissions of all gases in 1990, and integrating their 
effect over 100 years, shows that 60%> of the greenhouse forcing 
from these emissions comes from CO2 
6 Although potential CFC replacements are less (01, in some 
cases, not at all) damaging to the ozone layer, the GWPs of 
several of them are still substantial, however, over periods greater 
than about 20 years most of the substitutes should have a 
markedly smaller impact on global wanning than the CFCs they 
replace, assuming the same emissions 
7 Changes in climate forcing over the last century due to 
greenhouse gas increases are likely to have been much gieater 
than that due to solar radiation 
Although 
decadal 
variations of solar radiation can be comparable with greenhouse 
forcing, the solar forcing is not sustained and oscillates in sign 
This limits the ability of the climate system to respond to the 
forcing In contrast, the enhanced greenhouse effect causes a 
sustained forcing 
8 Stratospheric aerosols resulting from volcanic eiuptions can 
cause a significant radiative forcing A large eruption such as El 
Chichon can cause a radiative forcing, averaged over a decade 
about one third of (but the opposite sign to) the greenhouse gas 
forcing between 1980 and 1990 Regional and short teim ellects 
of volcanic eiuptions can be even larger 
9 Man made sulphur emissions which have increased in the 
Noithein Hemisphere ovei the last century at feet iadiative

pioperties ol clouds so as to cool the Earth It is very difficult to

estimate the size of this effect, but it is conceivable that this 
radiative forcing has been of a comparable magnitude, but of 
opposite sign, to the greenhouse forcing earlier in this century; 
regional effects could even have been larger. The change in 
forcing due to sulphur emissions in the future could be of either 
sign, as it is not known whether the emissions will increase or 
decrease.

2.1 Introduction 
The climate of the Earth has the potential to be changed on 
all timescales by the way in which shortwave radiation 
from the Sun is scattered and absorbed, and thermal 
infrared radiation is absorbed and emitted by the Earth-
atmosphere system If the climate system is in equilibrium, 
then the absorbed solar energy is exactly balanced by 
radiation emitted to space by the Earth and atmosphere 
Any factor that is able to perturb this balance, and thus 
potentially alter the climate, is called a radiative forcing 
agent 
Of particular relevance to concerns about climate change 
are the changes in radiative forcing which arise from the 
increases in the concentration of radiatively active trace 
gases ( greenhouse gases ) in the troposphere and 
stratosphere described in Section 1 These changes in 
concentration will come about when their emissions or 
removal mechanisms are changed so that the atmospheric 
concentrations are no longer in equilibrium with the 
sources and sinks of the gas The growing concentrations of 
greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane 
chlorofluorocarbons and nitrous oxide are of particular 
concern In addition, indirect effects on radiative forcing 
can result from molecules that may not themselves be 
greenhouse gases but which lead to chemical reactions 
which create greenhouse gases Foi example, 
indirect 
effects are believed to be altering the distribution of 
stratospheric and troposphenc ozone 
Although water vapour is the single most important 
greenhouse gas the effect of changes in its troposphenc 
concentration (which may arise as a natural consequence of 
the warming) is considered as a feedback to be treated in 
climate models, similarly changes in cloud amount or 
properties which result from climate changes will be 
considered as feedbacks Both these factors are discussed in 
Section 3 Possible feedbacks between ocean temperature 
and dimethyl sulphide emissions, which may alter sulphate 
aerosol amounts, are also considered to be a feedback and 
will be considered in Section 3 
Other factors can alter the radiative balance of the planet 
The most obvious of these is the amount ol solar radiation 
reaching the Earth and this is known to vary on a wide 
range of time scales The amount of solar radiation 
absorbed by the Earth atmosphere system is detei mined by 
the extent to which the atmosphere and Earths surface 
reflect the radiation (their albedo) and by the quantities of 
gases such as o/one and water vapour in the atmosphere 
The albedo of the Earth's surface can be affected by 
changes in the land surface, e g , desertification The 
planetary albedo can be altered by changes in the amount of 
aerosol particles in the atmosphere, in the stratosphcie the 
dominant source is from volcanic eruptions, while in the 
troposphere the source can be either natural or man-made 
The planetary albedo will also change if the properties of 
clouds are changed, for instance, if additional cloud 
condensation nuclei are provided by natural or man-made 
changes in aerosol concentrations Changes in aerosol 
concentrations can also affect radiative forcing by their 
ability to absorb thermal infrared radiation 
Although all of the above factors will be considered in 
this section, the emphasis will be very strongly on the 
greenhouse gases, as they are likely to change radiative 
forcing over the next few decades by more than any other 
factor, natural or anthropogenic They are also candidates 
for any policy action which may be required to limit global 
climate change Obviously factors such as those related to 
emissions from volcanoes and the effects ot solar 
variability are completely outside our control 
The purpose of this section is to use the information 
described in Section 1, on how the forcing agents 
themselves have changed in the past and how, based on a 
number of emission scenarios, they may change in the 
future This information will then be used in climate 
models, later in the report, to show the climate and sea 
level consequences of the emission scenarios 
However, we can also use the estimates of radiative 
forcing from this section in their own right, by looking at 
the relative contribution from each of the agents - and in 
particular the greenhouse gases The advantage of dealing 
with radiative forcing, rather than climate change itself, is 
that we can estimate the former with a great deal more 
certainty than we can estimate the latter In the context of 
policy formulation, the relative importance of these agents 
is of major significance in assessing the effectiveness of 
response strategies The radiative forcing is expressed as a 
change in flux of energy in Wm"-
In order to formulate policy on the possible limitations of 
greenhouse gas emissions (undertaken within IPCC by 
Working Group III), it is essential to know how abatement 
of the emissions of each of the trace gases will affect global 
climate forcing in the future This information can then be 
used for calculations of the cost-effectiveness of reductions, 
e g CO2 emissions compared to CH4 emissions There is 
no ideal index that can be used for each gas, but values of 
one index, the Global Warming Potential, are derived in 
this section Research now under way will enable such 
indices to be refined 
2.2 Greenhouse Gases 
2.2.1 Introduction 
A typical global-average energy budget for the climate 
system shows that about half of the incident solar radiation 
(at wavelengths between 0 2 and 4 0 |im) is absorbed at the 
Earth s surface This radiation warms the Earth s surface 
which then emits energy in the thermal infrared region (4-
48 
Radiatne Foi c mq of Climate 2 
IOO|am), constituents in the Earths atmosphere arc able to 
absoib this radiation and subsequently emit it both upwards 
to space and downwards to the surface This downward 
emission ot radiation serves to further warm the suiface, 
this warming is known as the greenhouse effect 
The strength of the greenhouse eflect can be gauged by 
the difference between the effective emitting temperature 
of the Earth as seen from space (about 255K) and the 
globally-averaged surlace temperature (about 285K) The 
principal components of the greenhouse effect are the 
atmospheric gases (Section 2 2 2), clouds and aerosols also 
absorb and emit thermal infrared radiation but they also 
incicasc the planetary albedo, and it is believed that then 
net effect is to cool the surface (see Sections 1 1 4 and 
2 12) Of the atmospheric gases the dominant greenhouse 
gas is water vapour If H2O was the only greenhouse gas 
piesent then the greenhouse elfect of a clear sky mid-
latitude atmosphere, as measured by the diffeience between 
the emitted thermal infrared flux at the surface and the top 
ol the atmosphere, would be about 60 70% of the value 
with all gases included, by contrast, it CO2 alone was 
present the corresponding value would be about 25% (but 
note that because ol overlap between the absorption bands 
of different gases, such percentages are not strictly 
additive) 
Here we are primanly concerned with the impacts of 
changing concentrations of greenhouse gases A number of 
basic lactors aflcct the ability ot different greenhouse gases 
to foice the climate system 
The absorption strength and the wavelength of this 
absorption in the thermal infrared are of fundamental 
nnpoitance in dictating whether a molecule can be an 
important gieenhouse forcing agent, this effect is modified 
by both the existing quantities of that gas in the atmosphere 
and the oveilap between the absorption bands and those of 
othei gases present in the atmosphere 
The ability to build up significant quantities of the gas in 
the atmosphere is ot obvious importance and this is 
dictated not only by the emissions of the gas, but also by its 
lifetime in the atmosphere Fuilhci, these gases, as well as 
those that aie not significant greenhouse gases can, via 
chemical reactions result in products that are greenhouse 
gases 
In addition the relative strength of greenhouse gases will 
depend on the period over which the elfects of the gases 
are to be considered For example, a short lived gas which 
has a stiong (on a kg-pei-kg basis) greenhouse effect may, 
in the short term be more effective at changing the 
radiative forcing than a weaker but longer-lived gas, over 
longci pcnods however the integrated eflect of the weaker 
gas may be greater as a result of its persistence in the 
dtmospheic 
Fiom this intioduction it is clear that an assessment of 
the stienuth of greenhouse cases in influencine radiative 
forcing depends on how that strength is measured There 
are many possible appioaches and it is important to 
distinguish between them 
Some of the more important indices that have been used 
as measures of the strength of the radiative forcing by 
greenhouse gases include 
1) 
Relative molecular forcing. This gives the relative 
forcing on a molecule-per-molecule basis of the 
different species It is normally quoted relative to 
CO2 Since the forcing of some atmospheric species 
(most notably CO2, methane and nitrous oxide) is 
markedly non-linear in absorber amount, this relative 
forcing will be dependent on the concentration 
changes lor which the calculations are performed A 
small change in current atmospheric concentrations is 
generally used This measure emphasises that the 
contributions ot individual gases must not be judged 
on the basis of concentration alone The relative 
molecular forcing will be considered in Section 2 2 4 
11) 
Relative mass forcing. This is similar to the relative 
molecular forcing but is relative on a kilogram per 
kilogram basis It is related to the relative molecular 
forcing by the molecular weights of the gases 
concerned It will also be considered in Section 2 2 4 
111) 
Contribution of past, present and future changes 
in trace gas concentration. This measure, which can 
either be relative or absolute 
calculates the 
contribution to radiative forcing over some given 
period due to observed past or present changes, or 
scenarios 
of 
future 
changes 
in 
trace gas 
concentration This is an important baseline The 
relative measures (1) and (11) above, can belittle the 
influence of carbon dioxide since it is relatively weak 
on a molecule-per-molecule basis, or a kg-per-kg 
basis This measure accounts for the lact that the 
concentration changes for CO2 aie between two and

other important greenhouse gases This measure will 
be considered in sections 2 2 5 and 2 2 6 Care must 
be taken in interpreting this measure as it is 
sometimes presented as the total change in torcing 
since pre industrial times and sometimes as the 
change in forcing over a shorter period such as a

atmosphere caused by the gas The development of 
an index is still at an early stage, but progress has 
been made and preliminary values are given in 
Section 2 2 7 
A detailed assessment of the climatic effects of trace 
gases was made by WMO (1985) (see also Ramanathan et 
al, 1987) The effect of halocarbons has been considered in 
detail in the recent Scientific Assessment of Stratospheric 
Ozone (UNEP, 1989) (see also Fisher et al, 1990) This 
section should be considered as building on these 
assessments and bringing them up to date 
2.2.2 Direct Effects 
Many molecules in the atmosphere possess pure-rotation or 
vibration-rotation spectra that allow them to emit and 
absorb thermal infrared radiation (4-100 |im), such gases 
include water vapour, carbon dioxide and ozone (but not 
the main constituents of the atmosphere, oxygen or 
nitrogen) These absorption properties are directly 
responsible for the greenhouse effect 
It is not the change in thermal infrared flux at the surface 
that determines the strength of the greenhouse warming 
The surface, planetary boundary layer and the free 
troposphere are tightly coupled via air motions on a wide 
range of scales so that in a global-mean sense they must be 
considered as a single thermodynamic system As a result 
it is the change in the radiative flux at the tiopopause, and 
not the surface, that expresses the radiative forcing of 
climate system (see e g , Ramanathan et al 1987) 
A number of factors determine the ability of an added 
molecule to affect radiative forcing and in particular the 
spectral absorption of the molecule in relation to the 
spectral distribution of radiation emitted by a black-body 
The distribution of emitted radiation with wavelength is 
shown by the dashed curves for a range of atmospheric 
temperatures in Figure 2 1 Unless a molecule possesses 
strong absorption bands in the wavelength region of 
significant emission, it can have little effect on the net 
radiation 
These considerations are complicated by the effect of 
naturally occurring gases on the spectrum of net radiation 
at the tropopause Figure 2 1 shows the spectral variation of 
the net flux at the tropopause for a clear-sky mid-latitude 
profile For example, the natural quantities of carbon 
dioxide are so large that the atmosphere is very opaque 
over short distances at the centre of its 15 (am band At this 
wavelength the radiation reaching the tropopause, from 
both above and below, comes from regions at temperatures 
little different to the tropopause itself The net flux is thus 
close to zero The addition of a small amount of gas 
capable of absoibing at this wavelength has negligible 
effect on the net flux at the tropopause The effect of added 
carbon dioxide molecules is, however, significant at the

Wavenumber (cm ') 
Figure 2.1: The dashed lines show the emission from a black 
body (Wm 2 per 10 cm ' spectral interval) across the thermal 
infrared for temperatures of 294K, 244K and 194K The solid 
line shows the net flux at the tropopause (Wm 2) in each 10 
cm ' interval using a standard narrow band radiation scheme 
and a clear-sky mid-latitude summer atmosphere with a 
surface temperature of 294K (Shine, pers comm ) In general, 
the closer this line is to the dashed line for 294K, the more 
transparent the atmosphere 
edges of the 15 |j.m band, and in particular around 13 7 and 
16 (im At the other extreme, in more transparent regions 
of the atmosphere (for example between 10 and 12 u;m), 
much of the radiation reaching the tropopause from beneath 
is, for clear skies, from the warm surface and the lower 
troposphere, this emission is not balanced by downward 
emission of radiation from the overlying stratosphere A 
molecule able to absorb in such a transparent spectral 
region is able to have a far larger effect 
The existing concentrations of a particular gas dictate the 
effect that additional molecules of that gas can have For 
gases such as the halocarbons, where the naturally 
occurring concentrations are zero or very small, their 
forcing is close to linear in concentration for present-day 
concentrations Gases such as methane and nitrous oxide 
are present in such quantities that significant absorption is 
already occurring and it is found that their forcing is 
approximately proportional to the square root of their 
concentration Furthermore, there is significant overlap 
between some of the infrared absorption bands of methane 
and nitrous oxide which must be carefully considered in 
calculations of forcing For carbon dioxide, as has already 
been mentioned, parts of the spectrum are already so 
opaque that additional molecules of carbon dioxide are 
even less effective, the forcing is found to be logarithmic in 
concentration These effects are reflected in the empirical 
expressions used to calculate the radiative forcing that are 
discussed in Section 2 2 4 
50 
Radiative Foi c ing of Climate 2 
A further consideration is the spectroscopic strength of 
the bands of molecules which dictates the strength ol the 
infra-red absorption. Molecules such as the halocarbons 
have bands with intensities about an order ot magnitude or 
more greater, on a molecule-per-molecule basis, than the 
15 |im band of carbon dioxide The actual absorptance by a 
band is, however, a complicated function of both absorber 
amount and spectroscopic strength so that these factors 
cannot be considered entirely in isolation. 
2.2.3 Indirect Effects 
In addition to their direct radiative effects, many of the 
greenhouse gases also have indirect radiative effects on 
climate through their interactions with atmospheric 
chemical processes Several of these interactions are shown 
in Table 2.1 
For example, both atmospheric measurements and 
theoretical models indicate that the global distribution of 
ozone in the troposphere and stratosphere is changing as a 
result of such interactions (UNEP, 1989, also see Section 
1) 
Ozone plays an important dual role in affecting climate 
While CO2 and other greenhouse gases are relatively well-
mixed in the atmosphere, the climatic effect of ozone 
depends strongly on its vertical distribution throughout the 
troposphere and stratosphere, as well as on its total amount 
in the atmosphere Ozone is a primary absorber of solar 
radiation in the stratosphere where it is dnectly responsible 
for the increase in temperature with altitude. Ozone is also 
an important absorber of infrared radiation It is the balance 
between these radiative processes that determines the net 
effect of ozone on climate. Changes in ozone in the upper 
troposphere and lower stratosphere (below 25 km) are most 
effective in determining the change in radiative forcing, 
with increased ozone leading to an increased radiative 
forcing which would be expected to warm the surface (e g , 
Wang and Sze, 1980, Lacis et al , 1990) This is because 
the greenhouse effect is directly proportional to the 
temperature contrast between the level of emission and the 
levels at which radiation is absorbed This contrast is 
greatest near the tropopause where temperatures are at a 
minimum compared to the surface. Above about 30 km, 
added ozone causes a decrease in surface temperature 
because it absorbs extra solar radiation, effectively robbing 
the troposphere of direct solar energy that would otherwise 
warm the surface (Lacis et al, 1990).

Stratospheric water vapour is an important greenhouse 
gas A major source of stratospheric water vapour is the 
oxidation of methane (eg , WMO 1985), it is anticipated 
that increased atmospheric concentrations of methane will 
lead to increases in stratospheric water vapour It is also 
possible that changes in climate will affect the transfer of 
water vapour from the troposphere to the stratosphere, 
although the sign of the net effect on stratospheric water 
vapour is unclear 
Unfortunately, observations of 
stratospheric water vapour are inadequate for trend 
detection In this section the impact of increased emissions 
of methane on stratospheric water vapour will be included 
as an indirect radiative forcing due to methane 
The oxidation of fossil based methane and carbon 
monoxide in the atmosphere lead to the production of 
additional carbon dioxide Although C02 has no known 
chemical interactions of consequence within the 
troposphere or stratosphere its increasing concentrations 
can affect the concentrations of stratospheric ozone through 
its radiative cooling of the stratosphere In the upper 
stratosphere the cooling slows down catalytic ozone 
destruction and results in a net increase in ozone, where 
heterogeneous ozone destruction is important, as in the 
Antarctic lower stratosphere ozone destruction may be 
accelerated by this cooling (UNEP, 
1989) 
The 
combination of these indirect effects, along with their 
direct radiative effects, determines the actual changes in 
radiative forcing resulting from these greenhouse gases 
The hydroxyl radical, OH is not itself a greenhouse gas 
but it is extremely important in the troposphere as a 
chemical scavenger Reactions with OH largely control the 
atmospheric lifetime, and, therefore the concentrations of 
many gases important in determining climate change 
These gases include CH4 
CO 
the non-methane 
hydrocarbons (NMHCs), the hydrochlorofluorocarbons 
(HCFCs), the hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) CH3CCI3, H2S 
SO2 and dimethyl sulphide (DMS) Then reaction with OH 
also affects the production of troposphenc ozone, as well as 
determining the amounts of these compounds ieaching the 
stratosphere, where these species can cause changes in the 
ozone distribution 
In turn the reactions of these gases 
with OH also affects its atmospheric concentration 
The 
increase in troposphenc water vapour concentration 
expected as a result of global warming would also increase 
photochemical production of OH It is important that 
effects of interaction between OH and the greenhouse 
gases, along with the resulting impact on atmospheric 
lifetimes of these gases, be accounted for in analysing the 
possible state of future climate 
The indirect effects can have a significant effect on the 
total forcing these effects will be detailed later in the 
section 
2.2.4 Relationship 
Between Radiative 
Forcing 
and 
Concentration 
To estimate climate change using simple energy balance 
climate models (see Section 6) and in order to estimate the 
relative importance of different greenhouse gases in past, 
present and future atmospheres (e g , using Global 
Warming Potentials, see Section 2 2 7), it is necessary to 
express the radiative forcing for each particular gas in 
terms of its concentration change This can be done in 
terms of the changes in net radiative flux at the tropopause 
AF = f(C0,C) 
where AF is the change in net flux (in Wm"^) 
corresponding to a volumetric concentration change from 
C 0toC 
Direct-effect AF-AC relationships are calculated using 
detailed radiative transfer models Such calculations 
simulate the complex variations of absorption and emission 
with wavelength for the gases included, and account for the 
overlap between absorption bands of the gases, the effects 
of clouds on the transfer of radiation are also accounted for 
As was discussed in Section 2 2 2, the forcing is given 
by the change in net flux at the tropopause However as is 
explained by Ramanathan et al (1987) and Hansen et al 
(1981) great care must be taken in the evaluation of this 
change When absorber amount varies, not only does the 
flux at the tropopause respond, but also the overlying 
stratosphere is no longer in radiative equilibrium For some 
gases, and in particular CO2, the concentration change acts 
to cool the stratosphere, for others, and in particular the 
CFCs, the stratosphere warms (see e g Table 5 of Wang et 
al (1990)) Calculations of the change in forcing at the 
tropopause should allow the stratosphere to come into a 
new equilibrium with this altered flux divergence, while 
troposphenc temperatures are held constant 
The 
consequent change in stratospheric temperature alters the 
downward emission at the tropopause and hence the 
forcing The AF-AC relationships used here implicitly 
account for the stratospheric response If this point is 
ignored, then the same change in flux at the tropopause 
from different forcing agents can lead to a different 
troposphenc temperature response Allowing for the 
stratospheric adjustment means that the temperature 
response for the same flux change from different causes are 
in far closer agreement (Lacis, personal communication) 
The form of the AF AC relationship depends primarily 
on the gas concentration 
For low/moderate/high 
concentrations, the form is well approximated by a 
linear/square-root/loganthmic dependence of AF on 
concentiation For ozone, the form follows none of these 
because of marked vertical variations in absorption and 
concentration Vertical variations in concentiation change

The 
actual 
relationships 
between 
forcing 
and 
concentration derived from detailed models can be used to 
develop simple expressions (e g , Wigley, 1987, Hansen et 
al 1988) which are then more easily used for a large 
number ot calculations 
Such simple expressions are used 
in this Section 
The values adopted and their sources are 
given in Table 2 2 Values derived from Hansen et al have 
been multiplied by 3 35 (Lacis, personal communication) 
to convert forcing as a temperature change to forcing as a 
change in net flux at the tropopause after allowing for 
stratospheric temperature change 
These expressions 
should be considered as global mean forcings, they 
implicitly include the radiative eifeels of global mean cloud 
cover 
Significant spatial variations in AF will exist because its 
value for any given AC depends on the assumed 
2 Radiatn e Fo> c im> of Climate 
53 
tempeiatuie and water vapour profiles Variations will also 
occur due to spatial variations in mean cloudiness These 
factors can produce marked differences in the relative 
contributions of dilterent greenhouse gases to total 
radiative forcing in different regions but these are not 
accounted for here 
Uncertainties in AF-AC relationships arise in three ways 
First, there are still uncertainties in the basic spectroscopic 
data for many gases In particular, data for CFCs, HFCs 
and HCFCs are probably only accurate to within ±10-20% 
Part of this uncertainty is related to the temperature 
dependence of the intensities, which is generally not 
known For some of these gases, only cross-section data 
are available For the line intensity data that do exist, there 
have been no detailed intercomparisons of results from

different laboratories Further information on the available 
spectroscopic data is given by Husson (1990) 
Second, uncertainties arise through details in the 
radiative transfer modelling Intercomparisons made under 
the auspices of WCRP (Luther and Fouquart, 1984) suggest 
that these uncertainties are around ±10% (although 
schemes used in climate models disagreed with detailed 
calculations by up to 25% for the flux change at the 
tropopause on doubling CO2) 
Third, uncertainties arise through assumptions made in 
the radiative model with regard to the following 
(1) 
the assumed or computed vertical profile of the 
concentration change For example, for CFCs and 
HCFCs, results can depend noticeably on the 
assumed change in stratospheric concentration (see 
e g , Ramanathan et al, 1985) 
(11) 
the assumed or computed vertical profiles of

Direct radiative forcing changes for the different 
greenhouse gases can be easily compared using the above 
AF-AC relationships There are two ways in which these 
comparisons may be made, per unit volumetric 
concentration change (equivalent to per molecule) or per 
unit mass change Comparison for the major greenhouse 
gases are given in Table 2 3 The relative strength of the 
CFCs, HFCs and HCFCs, relative to CFC-11, are shown in 
Table 2 4 (from Fisher et al , 1990) It can be seen that, by 
these measures, many of the potential CFC substitutes are 
strong infrared absorbers 
2.2.5 Past and Present Changes in Radiative Forcing 
Based on the expressions given in Table 2 2 the radiative 
forcing between 1765 and 1990 was calculated using 
observed variations of the greenhouse gases 
The 
concentrations are given in Table 2 5, they are updated 
values from Wigley (1987) and Section 1 Values for 1990 
have been extrapolated from recent values In addition to 
the well-observed variations in the gases given in Table 
2 5, it is assumed that increased concentrations of methane 
have led to increases in stratospheric water vapour, 
although such changes are based entirely on model 
estimates (see Section 2 2 3) 
Table 2 6 gives the contributions to the forcing for a 
number of periods This is shown diagrammatically in 
Figure 2 2 as the change in total forcing from 1765 
concentrations, it is shown as a change in forcing per 
decade in Figure 2 3

Figure 2.3: Decadal contributions to radiative forcing (Win 2) 
due to increases in greenhouse gas concentrations for periods 
between 1765 and 1990 The changes for the periods 1765-1900 
and 1900-1960 are the total changes during these periods divided 
by the number of decades 
Changes in halocarbons other than CFC-11 and CFC-12 
have been accounted for by using concentration changes 
from Section 1 and the forcing vcrsus-concentration 
changes given in Tables 2 2 and 2 4 It is lound that they 
contribute an extra 43% of the sum of the forcing from 
CFC-11 and CFC 12, most of this contribution results fiom 
changes in HCFC-22, CFC-1 H, carbon tetrachloride and 
methyl chloroform This is in reasonable agreement with 
Hansen et al (1989) who using less lecent spectioscopic 
data, lind these halocarbons contribute an extra 60% of the 
combined CFC-11 and CFC-12 forcing 
For the period 1765 to 1990, CO2 has contributed about 
6 1 % of the forcing, methane 
17% plus 6% 
from 
stratospheric water vapour, N2O 4% and the CFCs 12% 
For the decade 1980-1990, about 56% of the forcing has 
been due to changes in CCb, 11% due to the direct effects 
of CH4 and 4% via stratospheric water vapour, 6% from 
N2O and 24% from the CFCs 
As discussed 
in Section 
1, the distribution 
of 
tropospheric ozone has almost certainly changed over this 
period, with a possible impact on ladiative forcing 
Difficulties in assessing the global changes in ozone, and in 
calculating the resultant radiative forcing, prevent a 
detailed assessment of the effect 
Estimates of tropospheric 
ozone change driven by changing methane and NO x 
emissrons are highly model dependent partly because ol 
the inherent spatial averages used in current two-
dimensional models 
Estimates of changes in tropospheric 
ozone from pre-industnal values (e g Hough and Derwent 
1990) and simplified estimates of the ladiative foicing 
(Table 2 2) suggest that tropospheric ozone may have 
contributed about 
10% of the total forcing due to 
greenhouse gases since pre-industnal ttmes 
Decreases in lower stratospheric ozone, particularly 
since the mid-70s, may have led to a decreased radiative 
forcing, this may have compensated for the effects of 
tropospheric ozone (Hansen et al ,1989, Lacrs et al 1990) 
This compensation should be considered as largely 
fortuitous, 
as the 
mechanisms 
influencing 
ozone 
concentrations in the troposphere and stratosphere are 
somewhat different 
2.2.6 Calculations 
of Future 
Forcing 
Using the radiative forcing expressions described in 
Section 2 2 4, and the four scenarios developed by 
Working Group III, possible changes in radiative forcing 
over the next century can be calculated The four scenarios 
are intended to provide insight into policy analysis for a 
range of potential changes in concentrations, Scenario A is 
a 'Business as Usual 
case, whilst Scenarios B,C and D 
represent cases of reduced emissions These four scenarios 
are consideicd in more detail in the Appendix 1 As in the 
previous section the indirect effect of methane on forcing 
via stratospheric water vapour changes is included, whilst 
the effects of possible changes in ozone are neglected 
It must be stiessed here that the gas iefcircd to as HCFC-
22 as given in the scenarios is used as a surrogate for all the 
CFC substitutes Since all HCFCs and HFCs are of similar 
ladiative strength on a molecule-pei-molecule basis (see 
Table 2 4) the en01 from this source in using HCFC-22 as

the concentrations, as specified in the scenarios, were 
calculated assuming the HCFC-22 lifetime and molecular 
weight considerable errors in the forcing may result from

Since some of the CFC

shorter it is not possible to calculate the sign of the error 
without knowing the precise mix ot substitutes used

2.2.7 A Global Warming Potential Concept for Trace 
Gases 
In considciing the policy options for dealing with 
greenhouse gases, it is necessary to have a simple means of 
describing the relative abilities of emissions of each 
greenhouse gas to affect radiative forcing and hence 
climate A useful approach could be to express any 
estimates relative to the trace gas of primary concern, 
namely carbon dioxide It would follow on from the 
concept ol relative Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP) which 
has become an integral part ol the Montreal Protocol and 
othci national and international 
agreements 
lor 
contiolling emissions ol halocarbons (eg 
UNEP 
1989) The long lifetime of some greenhouse gases implies 
some commitment to possible climate impacts for decades 
01 centimes to come, and hence the inclusion ot potential 
in the formulation of the concept 
Estimates ol the lelative greenhouse forcing based on 
atmosphcnc concentiations have been detailed in Section 
2 2 ^ these are relatively straighttorward to evaluate 
Relative forcings based on emissions are of much gieatcr 
intnnsic interest to policy makers but require a carelul 
considciation of the radiative properties of the gases their 
liletimes and then indirect etlects on greenhouse gases 
Wucbbles (1989) has reviewed vanous approaches to the 
design ol relative forcings based on emissions using past 
and cuncnt trends in global emissions and concentrations 
It must be stressed that thcie is no universally accepted 
methodology lor combining all the relevant factois into a 
single global warming potential tor greenhouse gas 
emissions In fact there may be no single approach which 
will icpiesent all the needs of policy makers A simple 
appioach has been adopted here to illustrate the difficulties 
inheient in the concept, to lllustiatc the importance ol some 
ot the cuirent gaps in understanding and to demonstrate the 
cunent uinge of uncertainties However, because of the 
impoitance ot greenhouse warming potentials, a 
preliminary evaluation is made 
The Global Warming Potential (GWP) of the 
emissions of a greenhouse gas, as employed in this report, 
is the time integrated commitment to climate forcing from 
the instantaneous release of 1 kg ot a trace gas expressed 
relative to that from 1 kg of carbon dioxide 
GWP=

where di is the instantaneous radiative forcing due to a unit 
increase in the concentration of trace gas, I, C) is 
concentration ol the trace gas, I, remaining at lime, t, after 
its release and n is the number of years over which the 
calculation is performed The corresponding values for 
carbon dioxide are in the denominator 
Fisher et al (1990) have used a similar analysis to derive 
a global warming potential for halocarbons taken relative to 
CFC-11 In then work it is implicitly assumed that the 
integration time is out to infinity 
Early attempts at defining a concept ot global warming 
potentials (Lashof and Ahuja 1990, Rodhc, 1990, Derwent 
1990) are based on the instantaneous emissions into the 
atmosphere of a quantity of a particular tiace gas 
The 
tiace gas concentration then declines with time and whilst it 
is present in the atmosphere it generates a gicenhouse 
wanning 
II its decline is due to atmospheric chemistry 
processes then the pioducts of these leactions may 
generate an additional gicenhouse waiming A icalistic 
emissions sccnano can be thought of as due to a large 
number of instantaneous releases of dilfeient magnitudes 
over an extended time period and some emission abatement 
scenarios can be evaluated using this concept 
Particular pioblems associated with evaluating the GWP 
are 
the estimation of atmospheric lifetimes ol gases (and in 
particular CO2), and the variation ol that lifetime in 
the future, 
the dependence of the radiative forcing of a gas on its 
concentration and the concentration of other gases 
with spectrally overlapping absorption bands 
the calculation of the indirect effects of the emitted 
gases and the subsequent radiative effects of these 
indirect greenhouse gases (ozone poses a particular 
problem), 
the specification of the most appropriate time period 
over which to perform the integration 
The full resolution of the above problems must await 
further research The assumptions made in the present 
assessment are described below 
For some environmental impacts, it is important to 
evaluate the cumulative greenhouse warming over an 
extended period alter the instantaneous release of the trace 
gas For the evaluation ol sea-level rise, the commitment to 
greenhouse warming over a 100 year or longer time 
horizon may be appropriate For the evaluation ol short 
term effects, a time horizon of a few decades could be 
taken, for example, model studies show that continental 
areas are able to respond rapidly to iadiative loicing (see 
e g , Section 6) so that the relative elfects ol emissions on 
such timescales are relevant to predictions ol near-term 
climate change This consideration alone diamatically 
changes the emphasis between the ditfercnt gicenhouse 
2 Radiatn e Foi c mq of Climate 
59 
gases, depending on their persistence in the atmosphere 
For this leason, global warming potentials in Table 2 8 
have been evaluated over 20, 100 and 500 yeais These 
three different time horizons are presented as candidates for 
discussion and should not be considered as having any 
special significance 
The ligures presented in Table 2 8 should be considered 
preliminary only Considerable uncertainty exists as to the 
lifetimes ol methane and many of the halocarbons, due to 
difficulties in modelling the chemistry of the troposphere 
The specification of a single lifetime for carbon dioxide 
also presents difficulties, this is an approximation ol the 
actual lifetime due to the transfer of CO2 amongst the 
different reservoirs The detailed time behaviour of a pulse 
of carbon dioxide added to the atmosphere has been 
described using an ocean-atmosphere-biosphere carbon 
dioxide model (Siegenthaler, 1983) The added carbon 
dioxide declines in a markedly non-exponential manner 
there is an initial fast decline over the first 10 year period, 
followed by a more gradual decline over the next 100 years 
and a rather slow decline over the thousand year time-scale 
The time period for the first half-life is typically around 50 
years for the second, about 250 ycais (see Section 1 2 1 for 
details) A single lifetime figuie defined by the decline to 
1/e is about 120 years Indeed the uncertainties associated 
with specifying the lifetime of CO2 means that presentation 
of the GWP relative to CCb may not be the ideal choice, 
relative GWPs of gases other than CO2 to each other are 
not affected by this uncertainty 
In peiforming the integration of gieenhouse impacts into 
the future a number of simplifications have been made 
The neglect of the dependence ol the radiative teim on the 
trace gas conccntiation 
implies small trace gas 
concentration changes Furthci, the overlap of the infraied 
absorption bands of methane and nitrous oxide may be 
significant and this restncts the application of the GWP to 
small pei tin bations aiound present day concentrations 
<\n assumption implicit in this simple appioach is that 
the atmospheiic lifetimes of the tiace gases lcmain constant 
over the integiation time hon/on This is likely to be a pooi 
assumption for many trace gases for a variety of ditfeient 
reasons For those tiace gases which are removed by 
troposphenc OH radicals, a significant change in hletime 
could be anticipated in the future, depending on the impact 
of human activities on methane, caibon monoxide and 
oxides of nitrogen emissions For some scenarios, as much 
as a 50% incicase in methane and HCFC 22 lifetimes has 
been estimated Such incicases in lifetime have a diamatic 
influence on the global waiming potentials in Table 2 8, 
integrated ovei the longer time horizons Much more woik 
needs to be done to determine global warming potentials 
which will piopeily account loi the pioccsses allecting 
atmospheric composition and foi the possible non-lmeai 
feedbacks influencing the impacts of trace gases on 
climate 
It is recognised that the emissions of a number of trace 
gases, including NOx, carbon monoxide, methane and other 
hydrocarbons, have the potential to influence the 
distribution of troposphenc ozone It is not straightforward 
to estimate the greenhouse warming potential of these 
indirect effects because changes in troposphenc ozone 
depend, in a complex and non-linear manner on the 
concentrations of a range of species The limited spatial 
resolution in current troposphenc chemistry models means 
that estimates of increased troposphenc ozone production 
are highly model-dependent Furthermore, the radiative 
impacts of troposphenc ozone changes depend markedly on 
their spatial distribution As a result, the GWP values for 
the secondary greenhouse gases have been provided as first 
order estimates only, using results from a troposphenc two-
dimensional model of global atmospheric chemistry 
(Hough and Derwent, 1990) and the radiative forcing given 
in Table 2 2 (see Derwent (1990) for further details) 
Evaluation of the radiative forcing resulting from changes 
in concentrations of stratospheric ozone (as a result of CFC, 
N2O, and CH4 emissions) have not been included due to 
insufficient time to undertake the analysis this requires 
Bearing in mind the uncertainties inherent in Table 2 8, a 
number of important points are raised by the results 
Firstly, over a twenty year period a kilogram of all the 
proposed CFC substitutes, with the exception of the 
relatively short lived HCFC-123 and HFC-152a, cause 
more than a three order of magnitude greater warming than 
1 kg of CO2 However, tor a number of these gases (but not 
the five CFCs themselves) the global warming potential 
reduces markedly as the integration time is increased, this 
implies that over the long term, the replacement 
compounds should have a much lower global warming 
effect than the CFCs they replace, for the same levels of 
emissions In addition, the shorter lifetimes imply that 
abrupt changes in total emissions would impact on the 
actual global warming relatively quickly 
A further 
important point is that in tenns of radiative forcing over the 
short-term the effect of the CFC substitutes is considerably 
gieater than indicated by the halocarbon global warming 
potential (GWP) of Fisher et al (1990) For example, over 
a 20 year period, the effect of 1 kg emission of HCFC 22 
contnbutes only slightly less to the radiative forcing than 
the same amount of CFC-11, even though its 'infinite' GWP 
is about 0 35 
This is because, on a kg-per-kg basis, 
HCFC 22 is a stronger greenhouse gas than CFC-11 (Table 
2 4) 
The indirect greenhouse warmings listed in Table 2 8 are 
potentially very significant The production of CCb 
stiatosphenc watei vapoui and troposphenc ozone as a 
lesult ol emissions ol methane leads to an indiicct elfect

2.3 Other Radiative Forcing Agents 
231 Solar Radiation 
The Sun is the primary source of energy tor the Earth s 
climate system Variations in the amount of solar iadiation 
received by the I arth can affect our climate There are two 
distinct sources of this variability 
The first which acts 
with greatest impact on time-scales of 10,000 to 100,000 
years is caused by changes in the Sun-Earth orbital 
parameters The second comes from physical changes on 
the Sun itself, such changes occur on almost all time-scales 
2 3 11 Vai /ability due to 01 bital chanqes 
Variations in climate on time-scales ranging from 10,000 to 
100,000 years, including the major glacial/interglacial 
cycles during the Quaternary period, are believed to be 
initiated by variations in the Earth s orbital parameters 
which in turn influence the latitudinal and seasonal 
variation of solar energy received by the Earth (the 
Milankovitch Effect) Although the covariation of these 
orbital parameters and the Earth s climate provides a 
compelling argument in favour of this theory, internal 
feedback processes have to be invoked to explain the 
observed climatic variations, in particular the amplitude of 
the dominating 100,000 year period one such feedback 
could be the changes to the carbon cycle and the 
greenhouse effect of atmospheric CO2 (see Section 1) 
The radiative forcing associated with the Milankovitch 
Effect can be given for particular latitudes and months to 
illustrate that the rate of change of forcing is small 
compared to radiative forcing due to the enhanced 
greenhouse effect, of course, the climatic impact of the 
Milankovitch Effect results from the redistribution of solar 
energy, latitudinally and seasonally, so that a comparison is 
necessarily rather rough As an example, in the past 10,000 
years, the incident solar radiation at 60°N in July has 
decreased by about 35 Wm-2 (e g , Rind et al , 1989), the 
average change in one decade is -0 035 Wm-2, compared 
with the estimate, in Section 2 2 5, that the greenhouse 
forcing over the most recent decade increased by 0 6 
Wm-2 more than 15 times higher than the Milankovitch 
forcing 
2 3 12 Vai lability due to chaises in total sola/ madiance 
Variations in the short-wave and radio-frequency outputs of 
the Sun respond to changes in the surface activity of the 
star and follow in phase with the 11-year sunspot cycle 
The greatest changes, in terms of total energy, occur in the 
short-wave region, and particularly the near ultraviolet At 
0 3 u.m, the solar cycle variation is less than 1%, since only 
about 1% of the Suns radiation lies at this or shorter 
wavelengths solar-cycle variations in the ultraviolet will by 
themselves induce variations of no more than 0 01% in 
total irradiance, although these may be important for 
atmospheric chemistry in the middle atmosphere 
Of greater potential importance, in terms of direct affects 
on climate are changes integrated over all wavelengths the 
total solai irradiance or the so-called 
solar constant 
Continuous spaceborne measurements of total irradiance 
have been made since 197S These have shown that on 
time-scales of days to a decade there are irradiance

Figure 2.5: Reconstructed solar irradiance (Wm 2) from 1874 
to 1988 using the model of Foukal and Lean (1990), The model 
was calibrated using direct observations of solar irradiance from 
satellites between 1980 and 1988 Data from J Lean (pers 
comm ) Note that the solar forcing is only 0 175 times the 
irradiance due to area and albedo effects 
variations that are associated with activity in the Sun s outci 
layer, the photosphere 
specifically, sunspots and bright 
areas known as faculae The very high frequency changes 
aie too rapid to affect the climate noticeably 
However, 
theie is a lower frequency component that lollows the 11-
year sunspot cycle which may have a climatic effect It has 
been found that the increased irradiance due to faculae 
more than olfsets the decreases due to the cooler sunspots 
consequently, high sunspot numbers are associated with 
high solar output (Foukal and Lean, 1990) Over the period 
1980-86, there was a decline in irradiance of about 1 Wm" 
2 corresponding to a globally-avci aged lorcing change at 
the top of the atmosphere of a little less than 0 2 Wm"-
Since then irradiance has increased, following the sunspot 
cycle (e g , Willson and Hudson, 1988) 
This is compaiable with the greenhouse forcing which 
ovei the period 1980-86, increased by about 0 1 Wm 2 
Howcvei over longer periods these solar changes would 
have contnbuted only minimally towards offsetting the 
greenhouse effect on global-mean temperature because of 
the different time-scales on which the two mechanisms 
opciatc Because of oceanic thermal inertia (see Section 6), 
and because of the relatively short time scale of the forcing 
changes associated with the solar cycle only a small 
fiaction of possible temperature changes due to this souice 
can be realised (Wigley and Raper 1990) In contrast the 
sustained nature of the greenhouse forcing allows a much 
greater fraction of the possible temperature change to be 
realised so that the greenhouse forcing dominates 
Because the satellite record of solar irradiance began so 
recently, we cannot say with absolute certainty what past 
variations may have been However, a physically based 
statistical model has been developed by Foukal and Lean 
(1990), which attempts to reconstruct the solar-cycle 
related changes back more than 100 years (see Figure 2 5) 
This figure illustrates that the changes from 1980 to 1986 
were probably the largest in the past century 
While the model of Foukal and Lean (1990) indicates 
that the direct effects of solar-cycle-related irradiance 
changes may have been very small this does not rule out 
the possibility of larger, lower-frequency effects Three 
possibilities have been hypothesized, they are not 
supported by direct observational evidence of solar 
irradiance variations, and their magnitudes are derived by 
assuming that observed or inferred temperature variations 
are responses to solar forcing The first idea is that on the 
time scale of about a century, some underlying variation 
exists that parallels the envelope of sunspot activity, I e 
the smooth curve joining the peaks of successive sunspot 
maxima (Eddy 1977, Reid,1987) The envelope curve 
shows a quasi-cyclic behaviour with period about 80-90 
years referred to as the Gleissberg cycle (e g , Gilhland 
1982, Gilhland and Schneider, 1984) 
There is no reason why one should expect the envelope 
curve to be related to solar irradiance variations beyond 
those associated with the Foukal-Lean mechanism Reids 
study appears to have been spurred by the visual similarity 
between the Folland et al 
(1984) global marine 
temperature curve and the envelope curve This similarity 
is less apparent when more recently compiled temperatures 
are considered (see e g , Section 7) and is much less 
apparent in the Southern Hemisphere than in the Northern 
With no way to estimate the range of irradiance variation a 
pi IOI i Reid tuned this to obtain a best match between 
modelled and observed temperatures Assuming solar 
change as the sole forcing mechanism, the implied decadal 
time-scale irradiance range is about 0 6%, or 1 5 Wnr2 at 
the top of the atmosphere, for an assumed climate 
sensitivity of 2 5°C for a CCb doubling This value is about 
thirty times that inferred by direct satellite data 
Reid emphasizes that his work is mainly an exercise in 
cuive-fitting so that the results should be used with 
extreme caution Nevertheless, it has been taken seriously 
by the Marshall Institute (1989) so a brief analysis is in 
order Kelly and Wigley (1990) have performed a similar 
analysis to Reid s incorporating a greenhouse forcing 
history (Section 2 2 5) and using more recent temperature 
compilations (Section 7) The amplitude A of the radiative 
foicing due to solar variability (which is tied to sunspot 
number) is evaluated so as to give the best agreement 
between observed and modelled temperatures between 
1861 and 1989 The value of A which gives the best fit is 
found to depend critically on the assumed climate

sensitivity For values of equilibnum change due to 
doubled CCb (see Section 5 2 1) ol greatci than 2°C, it is 
found that the best lit is obtained ll there is a negative 
coitelation between solar output and sunspot number 
(which contiadicts iecent observations) At the lower end 
ot the lange of climate sensitivity suggested in Section 
5 2 1(1 T°C) the best lit is obtained lor a value of A about 
one iifth that derived by Reid However, even lor this 
\alue the peiccntagc variance explained is only marginally 
bettei when the solar and greenhouse effects aic consideied 
togethei than when greenhouse forcing is considered 
alone This analysis provides no evidence loi low-
trequency madiance variations larger than the small 
changes that have been dnectly ml erred fiom satellite 
based irradiance observations 
The second suggested solai eflcct makes use ol the 
relationship between solar iadius variations and n radiance 
changes Radius variations have been observed over the 
past lew centuries but whcthei these could have significant 
irradiance changes associated with them is unknown The 
propoitionality constant iclating radius and madiance 
changes is so unceitain that it could imply an entnely 
negligible oi a quite noticeable nradiance vanation 
(Gilhland 1982 Wigley 1988) Gilliland (1982) thcrcloie 
ittemptcd to estimate the solar effect empirically b> 
comparing modelled and observed data 
Gilliland 
concluded that solar induced quasi cyclic tempeiatuic 
changes (~8() yeai cycle) with ningc about 0 2°C might 
exist but to obtain a reasonable lit he had to invoke a 
phase lag between radius and madiance changes Most 
theories iclating iadius and lnadiance changes do not allow 
such a phase lag although an exception has been noted b> 
Wiglc\ (1988) While the physical basis lor the iadius 
effect is at least ieasonable these icsults aic far tiom being 
convincing in a statistical sense as Gilliland himself noted 
Nevertheless we cannot completely iule out the possibility 
of solar forcing changes iclated to radius vanations on an 
80 year time-scale causing global mean tempeiatuic 
fluctuations with a uinge of up to 0 2°C Hansen and Lacis 
(1990) regaid about 0 8 Wm - as a piobable uppei limit loi 
the change in loicing due to vanations in solar output ovei 
such periods 
The thud suggested solai elfect is that iclated to the 
minima in sunspot activity such as the Maundei Minimum 
lor which the associated changes in atmospheric 
radiocarbon content are used as a proxy These ideas were 
revived by Eddy (1977) The hypothesis has some credence 
in that the sunspot minima are manifestations ol solai 
change (although madiance changes associated with them 
would be only a lew tenths Wm 2 based on the Foukal-
Lean model) as aie radiocaibon fluctuations But neither is 
direct evidence ol solar iiiadicaue 
changes 
Indirect 
evidence ot madiance changes comes train the climate 
record specifically the observation that dining the 
Holocene the timing of the neoglacial (l e 
Little Ice 
Age type) events show some coriespondence with times of 
anomalous atmospheric radiocarbon content 
Wigley 
(1988) and Wigley and Kelly (1990) found the correlation 
over a 10 000 year period to be statistically signiticant but 
far trom convincing Nevertheless, if one accepts its reality, 
the magnitude ol the solar forcing changes required to 
cause the observed neoglacial events can be shown to have 
been up to 1 3 Wm-- at the top of the atmosphere, averaged 
ovei 100 200 years These results have also been used by 
the Marshall Institute (1989) who suggest that another 
Little Ice Age is imminent and that this may substantially 
otlset any future greenhouse-gas-induced warming While 
one might expect such an event to occur some time in the 
future the timing cannot be predicted 
Further the 1 ^ 
Wm -- solar change (which is an upper limit) is small 
compared with gieenhouse forcing and even if such a 
change occurred over the next few decades, it would be 
swamped by the enhanced greenhouse effect 
2 3.2 Direct Aerosol Effects 
The impact of aerosol particles, l e solid or liquid particles 
in the si/e range 0 001-10 (im radius, on the radiation 
budget ol the Earth-atmosphere system is manifold, either 
du c c th through scattering and absorption in the solar and 
theimal mliaied spectial ranges or mduecth 
by the 
modification of the miciophysical properties of clouds 
which affects then iadiative properties There is no doubt 
that aerosol particles influence the Earths climate 
However their influence is far more difficult to assess than 
that ot the trace gases because they constitute their own 
class ot substances with different size distributions shape 
chemical compositions and optical propeities and because 
then concentrations vary b> orders of magnitude in space 
and time and because obscivations of their temporal and 
spatial vanation aie pooi (Section 1) 
It is not easy to determine the sign of changes in the 
planetary iadiation budget due to aerosols Depending on 
absorption-to-backscattenng ratio surface albedo total 
aeiosol optical depth and solar elevation 
if ordered 
appioximatel) according to importance - additional aerosol 
panicles may eithei increase or decrease local planetary 
albedo (eg 
Coakley and Chylck 
1975 Grassl and 
Newiger 1982) A given aerosol load may increase the 
planetary albedo above an ocean surface and decrease it 
above a sand desert The effect of aerosol particles on 
tenestnal iadiation cannot be neglected, in conditions 
wheie the albedo change is small, the added greenhouse 
effect can dominate (Grassl 1988) 
While it is easy to demonstrate that aerosol particles 
measuiabl) ieduce solai madiance in industrial regions the 
lack ol data and inadequate spatial coverage preclude 
extending this demonstration to larger spatial scales Foi 
example Ball and Robinson (1982) have shown for the 
64 
Radiative Foi c nig of Climate 2 
eastern U.S. an average annual depletion of solar irradiance 
ot 7 5% at the surface. Some of this depleted radiation 
will, however, have been absorbed within the troposphere, 
so that the perturbation to the net flux at the tropopause will 
be somewhat less and the impact on the thermal infrared is 
not quantified. Most of this perturbation is anthropogenic. 
The depletion is regionally very significant, for example, 
for a daily mean surface irradiance of 200 Wm_2, if about 
half of the depleted irradiance is lost to space, the change in 
forcing would be 7.5 Wm~2. 
Carbon black (soot) plays an especially important role 
for the local heating rate in the air as it is the only strong 
absorber in the visible and near infrared spectrum present 
in aerosol particles Soot incorporated into cloud particles 
can also directly affect the radiative properties of clouds by 
decreasing cloud albedo and hence lead to a positive 
forcing (e.g., Grassl 1988). 
In view of the above uncertainties on the sign, the 
affected area and the temporal trend of the direct impact of 
aerosols, we are unable to estimate the change in forcing 
due to troposphenc aerosols. 
Concentrations of stratospheric aerosols may be greatly 
enhanced over large areas for a few years following large 
explosive volcanic eruptions although there is no evidence 
for any secular increase in background aerosol (Section 1). 
Major volcanic eruptions can inject gaseous sulphur 
dioxide and dust, among other chemicals, into the 
stratosphere The sulphur dioxide is quickly converted into 
sulphuric acid aerosols. If present in sufficient quantities in 
the stratosphere, where the half-life is about 1 year, these 
aerosols can significantly affect the net radiation balance of 
the Earth. 
These aeiosols can drastically reduce (by up to tens of 
percent) the direct solar beam, although this is, to some 
extent, compensated by an increase in diffuse radiation, so 
that decicases in total radiation are smaller (typically 5-
10%) (e.g., Spaenkuch, 1978; Coulson, 1988). This 
decrease in insolation, coupled with the warming due to the 
thermal mlrared effects of the aerosols, leaves only a small 
deficit in the radiative heating at the surface, foi even a 
mu|or volcanic eiuption Furthermore, volcanic aerosol 
clouds usually cover only a limited portion of the globe and 
they exist for a time (1-^ years) that is short compared to 
the response time ot the ocean-atmosphere system (which 
is of order decades). Thus their climatic effects should be 
relatively short-lived. Because the size distribution and the 
optical properties of the particles are very important in 
determining whether the Earth's surface warms or cools, 
theoretical estimates of their effect on the surface climate 
are strongly dependent on the assumptions made about the 
aeiosols (eg.. Mass and Portman (1989) and references 
therein). 
A number ol empirical studies have been carried out to 
detect the impact of volcanic eruptions on surface 
temperatures over the last 100 years or more (e.g., Bradley, 
1988; Mass and Portman, 1989) Generally these studies 
have concluded that major volcanic events, of which there 
were only about 5 during the past century, may cause a 
global-mean cooling of 0.1 to 0.2°C for a one to two year 
period after the event A dnect calculation of the radiative 
impact of a major volcanic eruption (Ramanathan, 1988) 
shows that the decadal radiative forcing may be 0.2 - 0.4 
Wnr2, indicating that they can have a significant climatic 
impact on decadal time-scales. 
There have also been claims of longer time-scale effects 
For example, Hammer et al. (1980) and Porter (1987) have 
claimed that the climate fluctuations of the last millenium, 
including events like the Little Ice Age, were due largely to 
variations in explosive volcanic activity, and various 
authors have suggested that decadal time-scale trends in the 
twentieth century were strongly influenced by the changing 
frequencies of large eruptions (SCOPE, 1986). These 
claims are highly contentious and generally based on 
debatable evidence For instance, a major problem in such 
studies is that there is no agreed record of past volcanic 
forcing - alternative records published in the literature 
correlate poorly. In consequence, the statistical evidence 
for a low frequency volcanic effect is poor (Wigley et al 
1986) but not negligible (Schonwiese, 1988); since the 
lifetime of the aerosols in the stratosphere is only a few 
years, such an effect would require frequent explosive 
eruptions to cause long time-scale fluctuations in aerosol 
loading 
In summary, there is little doubt that major volcanic 
eruptions contribute to the interannual variability of the 
global temperature record. There is no convincing 
evidence, however, of longer time-scale effects. In the 
future, the effects of volcanic eruptions will continue to 
impose small year-to-year fluctuations on the global mean 
temperature. Furthermoie, a period of sustained intense 
volcanic activity could partially offset or delay the effects 
of warming due to increased concentrations of greenhouse 
gases. However, such a period would be plainly evident 
and readily allowed tor in any contemporary assessment of 
the pi ogress of the greenhouse warming. 
2.3.3 Indirect Aerosol Effects 
Cloud droplets form exclusively through condensation of 
water vapour on cloud condensation nuclei (CCN): i.e., 
aerosol particles. Therefore, the size, number and the 
chemical composition of aerosol particles, as well as 
updraughts, determine the number of cloud droplets. As a 
consequence, continental clouds, especially over populated 
regions, have a higher droplet concentration (by a factor of 
oider 10) than those in remote marine areas. Clouds with 
the same vertical extent and liquid water content are 
calculated to have a higher short-wave albedo over 
continents than over the oceans (e.g., Twomey, 1977). In 
2 Radiatn c Foi c im> of Climate 
65 
other words, the more polluted an area by aerosol particles 
the more ieflective the clouds This effect is most 
pronounced lor moderately thick clouds such as marine 
strjtocumulus and stratus clouds which cover about 25% of 
the Earths suifacc Hence, an increased load of aerosol 
piracies has the potential to incicase the albedo ol the 
planet and thus to some extent counteiact the enhanced 
greenhouse effect 
The strongest confirmation of this aerosol/cloud albedo 
connection stems from observations of clouds in the wake 
of ship-stack effluents Ships enhance existing cloud cover 
(Twomey et al , 1984), and measurably increase the 
reflectivities (albedo) of clouds in overcast conditions 
(Coakley ct al , 1987) While the m-situ 
observations 
(Radke et al , 1990) have shown the expected increase in 
droplet numbers and decrease in droplet sizes for the 
contaminated clouds, they have also shown an increase in 
cloud liquid water content (LWC) in contradiction to the 
suggestion by Twomey et al , (1984) that the changes in the 
droplet size distribution will leave the LWC nearly 
unchanged Albrecht (1989) has suggested that the LWC 
increase could be due to the suppression of drizzle in the 
contaminated clouds An increase of the number of CCN 
therefore may have an even moic complicated influence 
than has been analysed 
The inciease 
in 
aerosol 
sulphate 
caused 
by 
anthropogenic SO? emissions (Section 1 Figure 1 16) may 
have caused an increase in the number of CCN with 
possible subsequent influence on cloud albedo and climate 
Cess (personal communication) has reported changes in 
planetary albedo over cloudy skies that are consistent with 
a larger-scale effect of sulphate emissions Measurements 
from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment satellite 
instruments indicate alter other factors have been taken 
into account that the planetary albedo over low clouds 
decreases by a lew per cent between the western and 
eastern North Atlantic The implication is that sulphate 
emissions Irom the east coast of North America are 
affecting cloud albedos downwind A similar el feet can be 
seen in the North Pacific off the coast ol Asia 
There are important gaps in our understanding and too 
little data, so that a confident assessment of the influence of 
sulphur emissions on radiative foicing cannot be made 
Wigley (1989) has estimated a global-mean forcing change 
of between -0 25 and -1 25 Wm-2 Irom 1900 to 1985 (with 
all of it actually occurring in the Northern Hemisphere) 
Deriving a lorcing history during this period presents even 
further difficulties so that we use, for a typical decadal 
forcing, the average change of -0 01 to -0 15 Wm - per 
decade 
Reference to Figure 2 3 shows that this ioicing may have 
contributed significantly to the total forcing particularly 
earlier in the centuij at these times it may have been ol a 
similar size, but ol opposite sign to the lorcing caused by 
the enhanced greenhouse clfect 
Indeed, it has been 
suggested that the increase in CCN of industrial origin (see 
Section 17 1) might explain why the Northern Hemisphere 
has not been warming as rapidly as the Southern 
Hemisphere over the last 50 years Wigley (1989) estimates 
that each 0 1°C increase in the twentieth century warming 
of the Southern Hemisphere relative to the Northern 
Hemisphere corresponds to a mean forcing differential of 
around -0 5 Wm-2, or a CCN increase of about 10% 
Sulphur emissions are actively being reduced in many 
countries Hence even if some compensation in the total 
lorcing is occurring because of changes in sulphate and 
greenhouse gases, it is not clear whether that compensation 
will continue in the future 
Because of the limited 
atmospheric residence time of the sulphur compounds, their 
possible effects on climate will be reduced as soon as their 
emissions are decreased A decrease in sulphur emissions 
would, via this theory, cause a decrease in cloud albedo 
The change in forcing over a decade could then be positive 
(although the total change from pre-industnal times would 
remain less than or equal to zero) Hence we are unable to 
estimate even the sign of future changes in forcing due to 
this sulphate effect 
A further important point is that even if the cloud albedo 
increases exactly offset the forcing due to increased 
concentrations of greenhouse gases, this would not 
necessarily imply zero climate change The sulphate effect 
would tend to act only regionally, whilst the greenhouse 
lorcing is global Hence regional climate change would still 
be possible even if the global mean perturbation to the 
radiation balance were to be zero 
2.3.4 Surface Characteristics 
The effects of desertification, sahnization, temperate and 
tropical deforestation and urbanization on the surface 
albedo have been calculated by Sagan et al (1979) They 
calculated an absolute change in surface albedo of 6 x 10"^ 
over the last 1 000 years and 1 x 10_3 over as short a time 
as the last 25 years Henderson-Sellers and Gornitz (1984) 
updated these latter calculations to a maximum albedo 
change over the last 25-30 years of between 3 3 and 6 4 x 
10"4 From Hansen et al , (1988) the radiative forcing (in 
Wm-2) | o r d change in a land surface albedo is about 
AF= 43 Ax 
(A\<0 1) 
where Ax is the change (as a decimal fraction) in the land 
albedo (The expression implicitly accounts for the fact that 
the land surface occupies only 30% of the total surface area 
of the globe) 
Thus the albedo change over the last few decades will 
have produced a radiative forcing of 0 03 Wm-2 dt m o st 
I e the effects ol surface albedo changes on the planetary 
ladiation budget are very small The effects of changes in

2.4 The Relative Importance of Radiative Forcing 
Agents in the Future 
The analyses ol past trends and future projections of the 
changes in concentrations ol greenhouse gases indicate that 
the iadiativc lorcing hom these gases may increase by as 
much as 0 4-0 6 WITT 2 per decade over the next several 
decades As discussed in Section 2 3, decadal-scale changes 
in the radiative loicing can also result Irom other causes 
Natural eliects on the loicing as a result ol solar vailability 
and volcanic ciuptions are paiticulaily iclevant on decadal 
timescales Other potentially impoitant anthropogenic 
eliects may lesult hom increases in the aeiosol content of 
the lowci atmosphcie, paiticulaily as a result ol sulphur 
emissions It is impoitant to consider how these additional 
lorcings may modify the atmospfienc ladiative lorcing 
from that expected hom gieenhouse gases on both decadal 
and longer timescales 
Over the penod ol a decade the other radiative forcings 
could extensively modify the expected ladiative forcing 
hom gieenhouse gases The additional loicing could either 
add to subtract hom oi even largely negate the ladiative 
loicing Irom gieenhouse gases, with the ellect over any 
given decade possibly being quite different Irom that ovei 
othci decades Figure 2 6(a) estimates the umge of possible

Wm - and one laigc volcanic euiption in a decade could 
cause a deciease of 0 2 Wm-2 The global-mean effect of 
sulphui emissions on cloud albedos was estimated to be up 
to 0 1 "5 Wnr2 pC| decade but, on a decadal scale not even 
the sign ol the ellect is certain Since both the volcanic and 
sulphate eliects do not act globally, the possible 
compensations between incieased gieenhouse forcing and 
possible decreases from the other effects may be even 
greater iegionally, whilst in other regions, such as in the 
southern hemisphere, the impact of sulphur emissions may 
be very small

eruptions and man-made sulphur emissions are likely to be 
much smaller The prior discussion suggests a change in 
radiative forcing of 0 2 WITT 2 Irom solar variability could 
occur over several decades In the unlikely case of one 
major volcanic ciuption per decade, a resulting net decrease 
in radiative forcing of 0 2 Wm_- could be sustained over a 
50 year period The effect of man-made sulphur emissions 
is again highly uncertain but using the earlier estimates it 
could be up to 0 75 Wm~2

Effects on 
radiative forcing from changes in surface characteristics 
should be less than 0 1 Wm 2 over this time period 
In addition to the effects from other forcings that oppose 
or reinforce the greenhouse gas forcing, there are also 
decadal-scale climate changes that can occur without any 
changes in the radiative forcing Non-linear interactions in 
the Earth-ocean-atmosphere 
system can result in 
unforced internal climatic variability (see e g Section 
6 5 2) As a result of the combined effects of forced and 
unforced effects on climate a range of unpredictable 
variations of either sign will be superimposed on a trend of 
rising temperature

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The climate system consists of the five components 
atmosphere 
ocean 
cryosphere (ice) 
biosphere 
geosphere 
The fundamental process driving the global climate system is 
heating by incoming short-wave solar radiation and cooling by 
long-wave infrared radiation into space The heating is strongest 
at tropical latitudes, while cooling predominates at the polar 
latitudes of each winter hemisphere The latitudinal gradient of 
heating drives the large scale circulations in the atmosphere and 
in the ocean, thus providing the heat transfer necessary to balance 
the system 
Many facets of the climate system are not well understood, and 
a significant number of the uncertainties in modelling 
atmospheric, cryosphenc and oceanic interactions are directly due 
to the representation or knowledge of interactive climate feedback 
mechanisms Such feedback mechanisms can either amplify or 
reduce the climate response resulting from a given change of 
climate forcing 
In older to predict changes in the climate system, numerical 
models have been developed which try to simulate the different 
feedback mechanisms and the interaction between the ditterent 
components of the climate system 
So far most climate simulations have been carried out with 
numerical Atmospheric General Circulation Models (AGCMs) 
which have been developed or derived from weather forecast 
models For investigations of climate change due to increased 
greenhouse gas concentrations, they have generally been run 
coupled with simple representations of the uppei ocean and, in 
some cases, with more detailed, but low resolution, dynamical 
models of the ocean to its full depth Relatively simple schemes 
for interactive land surface temperature and soil moisture are also 
usually included Representations of the other elements of the 
climate system (land-ice, biosphere) are usually included as non-
mteractive components The resolution of these models is as yet 
too coarse to allow more than a limited regional interpretation of 
the results 
Unfortunately, even though this is crucial for climate change 
prediction, only a few models linking all the mam components of 
the climate system in a comprehensive way have been developed 
This is mainly due to a lack of computer resources, since a 
coupled system has to take the different timescales of the sub-
systems into account An atmospheric general circulation model 
on its own can be integrated on currently available computers for 
several model decades to give estimates of the variability about its 
equilibrium response when coupled to a global ocean model 
(which needs millennia to reach an equilibrium) the demands on 
computer time are increased by several orders of magnitude The 
inclusion of additional sub-systems and the refinement of 
resolution needed to make regional predictions demands computer 
speeds several orders of magnitude faster than is available on 
current machines 
It should be noted that current simulations of climate change 
obtained by incomplete models may be expected to be superseded 
as soon as more complete models of the climate system become 
available 
An alternative to numerical model simulations is the palaeo-
analogue method (the reconstruction of past climates) Although 
its usefulness for climate prediction is questioned because of 
problems involving data coverage and the validity of past climate 
forcing compared with future scenarios, the method gives 
valuable information about the possible spectrum of climate 
change and it provides information for the broader calibration of 
atmospheric circulation models in different climate regimes

3.1 Introduction 
The aim of this section is to provide background 
understanding of the climate system, to explain some of the 
technical terms used in climate research (I e , what is a 
transient and what is an equilibrium response), and to 
describe how climate change can be predicted In the 
limited space available to this Section it is impossible to 
give more than a brief description of the climate system and 
its prediction The discussion will therefore be limited to 
the most relevant aspects More detailed description are 
found in the references and in, for example, the books of 
Gates (1975) and Houghton (ed) (1984) 
A section has been devoted to feedback processes which 
introduce the non-linearities into the climate system, and 
which account for many of the difficulties in predicting 
climate change Climate models and their technical details 
are discussed where relevant to subsequent Sections of the 
Report For more detailed information the reader is referred 
to the book by Washington and Parkinson (1986) 
To illustrate some of the difficulties and uncertainties 
which arise in climate change predictions from numerical 
models we compare results from two independent 
numerical simulations at the end of the Section 
3.2 Climate System 
The climate system (see Figure 3 1) consists of the five 
components 
atmosphere 
ocean 
cryosphere 
biosphere 
geosphere 
The fundamental processes driving the global climate 
system are heating by incoming short wave solar radiation 
and the cooling by long-wave radiation into space The 
heating is strongest at tropical latitudes, while cooling 
predominates in the polar regions during the winter of each 
hemisphere The latitudinal gradient of heating drives the 
atmosphere and ocean circulations, these provide the heat 
transfer necessary to balance the system (see Simmons and 
Bengtsson, 1984) 
3.2.1 The Atmosphere 
The bulk of the incoming solar radiation is absorbed not by 
the atmosphere but by the Earth's surface (soil, ocean, ice) 
Evaporation of moisture and direct heating of the surface 
generate a heat transfer between the surface and the 
atmosphere in the form of latent and sensible heat The 
atmosphere transports this heat mendionally, mainly via 
transient weather systems with a timescale of the order of 
days 
The following processes are important in determining the 
behaviour of the atmospheric component of the climate 
system 
Turbulent transfer of heat, momentum and moisture at 
the surface of the Earth, 
The surface type (I e , its albedo), which determines the 
proportion of incoming to reflected solar radiation 
Latent heat release when water vapour condenses, 
clouds, which play an important role in reflecting

The radiative cooling and heating ol the atmosphere by 
CO?, water vapoui, o/one and othei twice gases. 
Aerosols (such as volcanic dust), the orbital parameters, 
mountain ranges and the land-sea distribution. 
Atmospheric processes are also influenced by a number 
ol feedback mechanisms which involve interactions 
between the atmospheric processes themselves (radiation 
and clouds, for example) and between these processes and 
the underlying surlace. Such feedback mechanisms are 
discussed in more detail in 3.3 1 
The problems concerning the impact ol human activities 
on the greenhouse ctfect has bioadencd in scope Irom a 
CO? climate problem to a trace gas climate problem 
(Ramanathan et al., 1987). The climatic elfects of trace 
gases are strongly governed by interactions between 
chemistry, radiation and dynamics. The nature ol the trace 
gas radiative heating and the importance of chemical-
widiative interactions has been aheady discussed in Section 
9 
Irom the atmosphere into the interior ol the ocean by the 
physical pump mechanism (dcscnbed in the previous 
Section) caused by dilferences in the partial pressure of 
carbon dioxide in the ocean and the lowest layers of the 
atmosphere. Furthermore the annual ventilation of the 
seasonal boundary layei from the surface mixed-layer 
controls the efficiency ol the biological pump by which 
ocean plankton convert dissolved carbon dioxide into 
particulate carbon, which sinks into deep water. These two 
pumps are responsible for extracting carbon dioxide from 
the global carbon cycle tor periods in excess of a hundred 
yeais. The ocean branch of the carbon cycle involves a flux 
of carbon dioxide Irom the air into the sea at locations 
where the surface mixed layer has a partial pressure of CO2 
lower than the atmosphere and vice versa. Mixed-layer 
partial pressure of CO2 is depressed by enhanced solubility 
in cold water and enhanced plankton production during the 
spring bloom. The rate of gas exchange depends on the air-
sea difference in partial pressure of CO2 and a coefficient 
which increases with wind speed. 
The following processes control the the climate response 
of the ocean. 
3.2.2 The Ocean 
The ocean also plays an essential role in the global climate 
system. Over half of the solar radiation reaching the Earth's 
surlace is lirst absorbed by the ocean, where it is stored and 
redistubuted by ocean currents beloie escaping to the 
atmosphere, largely as latent heat of evapoiation, but also 
as long-wave radiation. The currents arc driven by the 
exchange of momentum, heat and watei between the ocean 
and atmosphere. They have a complicated horizontal and 
veitical structure determined by the pattern ol winds 
blowing over the sea and the distribution of continents and 
submeiged mountain ranges. The veitical structure of the 
ocean comprises three layers: 
The Seasonal Boundary Layei, mixed annually from the 
surface, is less than 100 metres deep in the tropics 
and reaches hundreds of mcties in the sub-polar seas 
(other than the North Pacific) and several kilometres 
in very small regions of the polar seas in most years; 
The Warm Water Sphere (permanent thermochne), 
ventilated (1. e., exchanging heat and gases) Irom the 
seasonal boundary layer, is pushed down to depths of 
many hundreds of metres in gyres by the 
convergence of surface (Ekman) currents driven 
directly by the wind; and 
The Cold Water Sphere (deep ocean), which fills the 
bottom 80% of the ocean's volume, ventilated from 
the seasonal boundary layer in polar seas 
The ocean contains chemical and the biological 
mechanisms which are important in controlling carbon 
dioxide in the climate system. Carbon dioxide is transferred 
The small-scale (of order 50 km) transient eddies inside 
the ocean influence the structure of permanent gyres 
and streams and their interaction with submerged 
mountain ranges. The eddies also control the 
horizontal dispersion of chemicals (such as CO2) 
dissolved in seawater. 
The small-scale (tens of kilometres) patches of deep 
winter convection in the polar seas and the 
northernmost part of the North Atlantic, which 
transport heat and dissolved carbon dioxide below 
one kilometre into the deep reservoir of the cold 
water sphere, and the slow currents which circulate 
the newly implanted water around the world ocean. 
The more extensive mechanism of thermochne 
ventilation by which some of the water in the surface 
mixed-layer flows from the seasonal boundary layer 
into the warm water sphere reservoir of the ocean, 
which extends for several hundreds of metres below 
most of the ocean's surface area. 
The global transport of heat, freshwater and dissolved 
chemicals carried by ocean currents which dictate the 
global distributions of temperature, salinity, sea-ice 
and chemicals at the sea surface. Fluctuations in the 
large-scale circulation have modulated these patterns 
over years and decades. They also control the 
regional variations in sea surface properties which 
affect climate at this scale. 
The biological pump in the seasonal boundary layer by 
which microscopic plants and animals (the plankton) 
consume some of the carbon dioxide dissolved in the 
seawater and sequester the carbon in the deep ocean

away from the short term (up to a hundred years) 
interactions between ocean and atmosphere 
3.2.3 The Cryosphere 
The terrestrial cryosphere can be classified as follows 
(Untersteiner, 1984) 
Seasonal snow cover, which responds rapidly to 
atmospheric dynamics on timescales of days and 
longer In a global context the seasonal heat storage 
in snow is small The primary influence of the 
cryosphere comes from the high albedo of snow 
covered surfaces 
Sea ice, which affects climate on time scales of seasons 
and longer This has a similar cftcct on the surlacc 
heat balance as snow on land It also tends to 
decouple the ocean and atmosphere since it inhibits 
the exchange of moisture and momentum 
In some 
regions it influences the formation of deep water 
masses by salt extrusion during the freezing period 
and by the generation of fresh water layers in the 
melting period 
Ice sheets of Greenland and the Antarctic, which can be 
considered as quasi-permanent topographic features 
They contain 80% ot the existing fresh water on the 
globe, thereby acting as a long term reservon in the 
hydrological cycle Any change in size will therefore 
influence the global sea level 
Mountain glaciers are a small part of the cryosphere 
They also represent a freshwater reservoir and can 
therefore influence the sea level They are used as an 
important diagnostic tool for climate change since 
they respond rapidly to changing environmental 
conditions 
Permafrost affects surface ecosystems and river 
discharges It influences the thermohahne circulation 
ot the ocean 
3.2.4 The Biosphere 
The biosphere on land and in the oceans (discussed above) 
controls the magnitude of the fluxes of several greenhouse 
gases 
including CO2 and methane, between the 
atmosphere, the oceans and the land The processes 
involved are sensitive to climatic and environmental 
conditions, so any change in the climate or the environment 
(e g , increases in the atmospheric abundance of CCb) will

detailed description of the feedbacks and their respective 
magnitudes can be found in Section 10 
interacting with the biosphere) and in underground 
reservoirs, or transported as run-off to different locations 
where it might influence the ocean circulation, particularly 
in high latitudes The soil interacts with the atmosphere by 
exchanges of gases, aerosols and moisture, and these are 
influenced by the soil type and the vegetation, which again 
are strongly dependent on the soil wetness Our present 
knowledge about these strongly interactive processes is 
limited and will be the target of future research (see Section 
11) 
3.2.6 Timescales 
While the atmosphere reacts very rapidly to changes in its 
forcing (on a timescale of hours or days), the ocean reacts 
more slowly on timescales ranging from days (at the 
surface layer) to millennia in the greatest depths The ice 
cover reacts on timescales of days for sea ice regions to 
millennia for ice sheets The land processes react on 
timescales of days up to months, while the biosphere reacts 
on time scales from hours (plankton growth) to centuries 
(tree-growth) 
3.3 Radiative Feedback Mechanisms 
3.3.1 Discussion of Radiative Feedback Mechanisms 
Many facets of the climate system are not well understood, 
and a significant number of the uncertainties in modelling 
atmospheric, cryosphenc and oceanic interactions are 
directly due to interactive climate feedback mechanisms 
They can cither amplify or damp the climate response 
resulting liom a given climate forcing (Cess and Pottei, 
1988) For simplicity, emphasis will here be directed 
towards global-mean quantities, and the interpretation ot 
climate change as a two-stage process 
foicing and 
response This has proved useful in interpreting climate 
feedback mechanisms in general circulation models It 
should, in fact, be emphasized that the conventional 
concept ol climate feedback applies only to global mean 
quantities and to changes from one equilibrium climate to 
another 
As discussed in Section 2, the radiative forcing of the 
surface-atmospheie system AQ is evaluated by holding all 
other climate parameters fixed, with G = 4 Wm~2 for an 
instantaneous doubling of atmospheric CO2 It readily 
follows (Cess et al , 1989) that the change in surface 
climate, expressed as the change in global-mean surface 
temperature ATs, is related to the radiative forcing by ATs 
= X x AQ, where X is the climate sensitivity parameter 
3.2 5 The Geosphere 
The land processes play an important part in the 
hydrological cycle These concern the amount of fresh 
watei stoied in the ground as soil moistuie (thcicby

AS/ATs 
where F and S denote respectively the global-mean emitted

Pi ocesses and Modelling 3 
Atmosphere (TOA) Thus AF and AS are the climate-
change TOA responses to the radiative forcing AQ An 
increase in A, thus represents an increased climate change 
due to a given radiative forcing AQ (= AF - AQ) 
The definition of radiative forcing requires some 
clarification Strictly speaking, it is defined as the change 
in net downward radiative flux at the tropopause, so that 
lor an instantaneous doubling of CO2 this is approximately 
4 Wm_2 and constitutes the radiative heating of the 
surlace-troposphere system If the stratosphere is allowed 
to respond to this forcing, while the climate parameters of 
the surlacc-tropospherc system are held lixed, then this 4 
Win 2 n u x change also applies at the top of the 
atmosphere It is in this context that lachative forcing is 
used in this section 
A doubling of atmospheric CO2 serves to illustrate the 
use of A. for evaluating feedback mechanisms Figure 3 2 
schematically depicts the global radiation balance 
Averaged over the year and over the globe there is 140 
Wnr- of incident solar radiation at the TOA Of this 
roughly 30% or 100 Win 2 is reflected by the surface -
atmosphere system Thus the climate system absoibs 240 
Wm_2 0| solar radration, so that under equilrbnum 
conditions it must emit 240 Wm~2 of infrared radiation 
The CO? radiative forcing constitutes a reduction in the 
emitted infrared radiation, since this 4 Wm-2 forcing 
represents a heating of the climate system Thus the CO2

doubling results in the climate system absorbing 4 Wm-2 
more eneigy than it emits, and global warming then occurs 
so as to increase the emitted iadiation in order to re-
establish the Earths radiation balance If this warming 
produced no change in the climate system other than 
temperature, then the system would return to its original 
radiation balance, with 240 Wm-2 both absorbed and 
emitted In this absence of climate feedback mechanisms, 
AF/ATs = 3 3 Wm-2 K"l (Cess et al, 1989 ) while AS/ATs 
= 0, so that A. = 0 1 Km2 W"' It in turn follows that ATs = 
A. x AQ = 1 2°C If it were not for the fact that this warming 
intioduccs numerous interactive feedback mechanisms, 
then ATs = 1 2°C would be quite a robust global-mean 
quantity Unlortunately, such feedbacks introduce con-
siderable uncertainties into ATs estimates Three of the 
commonly discussed feedback mechanisms are described 
in the following sub-sections 
3 3.2 Water Vapour Feedback 
The best understood feedback mechanism is water vapour 
feedback and this is intuitively easy to comprehend For 
illustrative purposes a doubling of atmospheric CO2 will 
again be consideicd 
The ensuing global warming is, of 
course, the result of CO2 being a greenhouse gas This 
warming, however, produces an interactive effect, the 
warmer atmosphere contains more water vapour, itself a 
gicenhouse gas Thus an inciease in one greenhouse gas 
(CO2) induces an increase in yet another greenhouse gas 
(water vapour), resulting in a positive (amplifying) 
feedback mechanism 
To be more specific on this point, Raval and 
Ramanathan (1989) have recently employed satellite data 
to quantify the temperature dependence of the water vapour 
greenhouse effect 
From then results it readily follows 
(Cess, 1989) that watei vapour feedback reduces AF/ATs 
from the prior value oi 3 3 Wm 2 K"1 to 2 3 Wm"2 K"1 
This in turn increases A. from 0 3 Km2 W"' to 0 43 Km2 
W"' and thus increases the global warming from ATs = 
1 2°C to ATs = 1 7°C There is yet a further amplification 
caused by the increased water vapour Since water vapour 
also absorbs solar radiation, water vapour feedback leads to 
an additional heating of the climate system through 
enhanced absorption of solar radiation In terms of AS/ATs 
as appears within the expression for A., this results in 
AS/ATs = 0 2Wm-2 K ' (Cess et al, 1989), so that X is 
now 0 48 Km2 W"1 while ATs = 1 9°C The point is that 
water vapour feedback has amplified the initial global 
warming of 1 2°C to 1 9°C, 1 e . an amplification factor of 
1 6 
3.3.3 Snow-Ice Albedo Feedback 
An additional well-known positive feedback mechanism is 
snow-ice albedo Icedback, by which a warmer Earth has 
less snow and ice cover resulting in a less reflective planet 
3 Pi OC es tes and Modellm v, 
79 
which in turn absorbs more solar radiation For simulations 
in which the carbon dioxide concentration of the 
atmosphere is increased, general circulation models 
produce polar amplification of the warming in winter, and 
this is at least partially ascribed to snow-ice albedo 
feedback The real situation, however, is probably more 
complex as, for example, the stability of the polar 
atmosphere in winter also plays a part Illustrations of 
snow-ice albedo feedback, as produced by general 
circulation models, will be given in Section 3 5 It should 
be borne in mind, however, that there is a need to diagnose 
the interactive nature of this feedback mechanism more 
fully 
3.3.4 Cloud Feedback 
Feedback mechanisms related to clouds are extremely 
complex To demonstrate this, it will be useful to first 
consider the impact of clouds upon the present climate 
Summarized in Table 3 1 are the radiative impacts of 
clouds upon the global climate system for annual mean 
conditions These radiative impacts refer to the effect of 
clouds relative to a 'clear-sky Earth, as will shortly be 
described this is termed cloud-radiative forcing 
The presence of clouds heats the climate system by 31 
Wm - through reducing the TOA infrared emission Note 
the similarity to trace-gas iadiative forcing, which is why 
this impact is referred to as cloud radiative forcing 
Although clouds contribute to the greenhouse warming of 
the climate system, they also produce a cooling through the 
reflection and reduction in absorption of solar radiation As 
demonstrated in Table 3 1, the latter process dominates 
over the former, so that the net effect of clouds on the 
annual global climate system is a H Wm-- radiative 
cooling As discussed below with respect to cloud feedback 
components, cloud-radiative forcing is an integrated effect 
governed by cloud amount, cloud vertical distribution, 
cloud optical depth and possibly the cloud droplet 
distribution (Wigley, 1989, Charlson et al, 1987) 
Although clouds produce net cooling of the climate 
system, this must not be construed as a possible means of

13Wrrr2 
offsetting global warming due to increasing greenhouse 
gases As discussed in detail by Cess et al (1989), cloud 
feedback constitutes the change in net CRF associated with 
a change in climate Choosing a hypothetical example, if 
climate warming caused by a doubling of CCb were to 
result in a change in net CRF from 13 WITT2 to -11 Wm-2, 
then this increase in net CRF of 2 Wm-2 would amplify the 
4 Wm-2 initial CO2 radiative forcing and would so act as a 
positive feedback mechanism It is emphasized that this is a 
hypothetical example, and there is no a pi ton means of 
determining the sign of cloud feedback To emphasize the 
complexity of this feedback mechanism, three contributory 
processes are summarized as follows 
Cloud Amount: If cloud amount decreases because of 
global warming, as occurs in typical general 
circulation model simulations, then this decrease 
reduces the infrared greenhouse effect attributed to 
clouds Thus as the Earth warms it is able to emit 
infrared radiation more efficiently, moderating the 
warming and so acting as a negative climate 
feedback mechanism But there is a related positive 
feedback, the solar radiation absorbed by the climate 
system increases because the diminished cloud 
amount causes a reduction of leflected solar radiation 
by the atmosphere There is no simple way of 
appraising the sign of this feedback component 
Cloud Altitude: A vertical redistribution of clouds will 
also induce feedbacks 
For example, if global 
warming displaces a given cloud layer to a higher 
and colder region of the atmosphere, this will 
produce a positive feedback because the colder cloud 
will emit less radiation and thus have an enhanced 
greenhouse effect 
Cloud Water Content There has been considerable 
recent speculation that global warming could 
increase cloud water content thereby resulting in 
brighter clouds and hence a negative component of 
cloud feedback Cess et al (1989) have recently 
suggested that this explanation is probably an 
oversimplification In one case, they demonstrated 
that this negative solar feedback 
induces a 
compensating positive infrared feedback In a more 
recent study they further indicate that in some 
models the net effect might thereby be that of 
positive feedback (see also Schlesinger and 
Roeckncr, 1988, Roeckner et al 1987) 
The above discussion clearly illustrates the multitude of 
complexities associated with cloud feedback and the 
uncertainties due to this feedback will furthci be 
emphasized in Section 3 5 In that both cloud and snow ice 
albedo feedbacks are geogiaphical in nature then these 
feedback mechanisms can only be addiesscd through the 
use of three-dimensional numencal circulation models

3.4 Predictability Of The Climate System 
The prediction of change in the climate system due to 
changes in the forcing is called climate lorecasting In the 
climate system the slow components (for example the 
oceanic circulation) are altered by the fast components (for 
example 
the 
atmosphere) 
(Hasselmann, 
1976, 
Mikolajewic7 and Maier Reimer 1990) which again are 
influenced by the slow components, so that the complete 
system shows a considerable vanance just by an inteiaction 
of all components involved This effect is an illustration ol 
"natural vailability 
Taking the climate system as a whole we note that some 
elements of the system are chaotic viewed on a centuiy to 
millennium time scale, while other paits aie remaikably 
stable on those time scales The existence of these (in the 
time fiame considered) stable components allows 
piediction ol global change despite the existence of the 
chaotic elements The chaotic elements of the climate 
system aie the weather systems in the atmospheie and in 
the ocean 
The weathei systems in the atmospheie have such a large 
hon/ontal scale that it is necessaiy to treat the whole ol the 
atmospheiic circulation as chaotic, nevertheless there are 
stable elements in the atmosphere as witnessed by the 
smooth seasonal cycle in such phenomena as the 
temperatuie distributions ovei the continents, the monsoon 
stonn tracks, inter-tropical convergence /one etc That 
stability gives us hope that the response of the atmospheric 
climate (including the statistics of the chaotic weathei 
systems) to greenhouse loicing will itself be stable and that 
the mteiactions between the atmospheie and the othci 
elements of the climate system will also be stable even 
though the mechanisms of mleiaction depend on the 
weathei systems 
This leads to the common assumption used in climate 
piediction that the climate system is in equihbnum with its 
loicing That means, as long as its foicing is constant and 
the slowly varying components altei only slightly in the 
time scale consideied, the mean state of the climate system 
will be stable and that it there is a change in the forcing, the 
mean state will change until it is again in balance with the 
loicing This state is described as an equilibrium state the 
tiansition between one mean and another mean state is 
called a tiansient state 
The time-scale ol the tiansition period is determined by 
the adjustment time of the slowest climate system 
component, I e the ocean The stable ('quasi stationary") 
behavioui of the climate system gives us the opportunity to 
detect changes by taking time averages Because the 
internal vaiubilit) of the system is so high the averaging 
mtei\al has to be long compaied to the chaotic fluctuations 
to detect a statistically significant signal which can be 
attnbuted to the external torcum 
A number ol statistical test have been devised to 
optimize the detection ol climate change signals (v Storch 
& Zwiers, 1988, Zwieis, 1988, Hasselmann, 1988, Santer 
and Wigley, 1990) (see Section 8) 
Studies of the completed change from one mean state to 
another are called equilibrium response' studies Studies 
of the time evolution of the climate change due to an 
altered forcing, which might also be time dependent, are 
called transient response experiments 
The weather systems in the ocean have much smaller 
horizontal scales (less than one hundred kilometies) than in 
the atmosphere leaving the large-scale features of the world 
ocean circulation to be non-chaotic The success of 
classical dynamical occanogiaphy depends on that fact 
Obscivations of the penetiation of transient tracers into the 
ocean show that the large-scale ocean currents are stable 
ovei periods of several decades Palaeo-oceanographic 
evidence shows that the currents and gyres adjusted 
smoothly to the ice age cycle That evidence and theoietical 
undeistanding of the large-scale ocean cnculation suggests 
that we aie indeed dealing, in the ocean, with a predictable 
system at least on timescales of decades The question is 
whether the existence of piedictabihty in the ocean 
component of the Eaith s climate system makes the system 
predictable as a whole However, this seems to be a 
leasonable working hypothesis, which receives some 
support from the smooth transient response simulated by 
coupled ocean-atmosphere models (see Section 6) 
3.5 Methods Of Predicting Future Climate 
Two appioaches have been taken to predict the future 
climate 
a) 
the analogue method , which tries to estimate luture 
climate change from reconstructions of past climates 
using palaeo-chmatic data, 
b) 
climate simulations with numerical models (GCM s) 
of the atmospheric general circulation, which have 
been derived from weather forecast models They 
include representations of the other elements of the 
climate system (using ocean models, land surface 
models, etc) which have varying degrees of soph-
istication A comprehensive list of the models 
employed and the research groups involved can be 
found in Table 3 2(a) and (b)

3.5.1 The Palaeo-Analogue Method 
This method has two distinct and rather independent parts 
The first derives an estimate of global temperature 
sensitivity to atmospheric CCb concentrations based on 
estimates of CO2 concentrations at various times in the past 
and the corresponding global average temperatures, 
adjusted to allow for past changes in albedo and solar 
constant In the second part regional patterns of climate are 
reconstructed for selected past epochs, and they are 
regarded as analogues of future climates under enhanced 
greenhouse conditions For a further discussion of the 
method, see for example Budyko and brael (1987) 
3 511 Estimate of tempei atui e sensitnit) to CO2 changes 
There are three stages (Budyko et al , 1987) 
1) 
determining the global mean changes for past palaeo-
chmates This is done for four periods (Early 
Pliocene, early and middle Miocene, Palaeocene-
Eocene and the Cretaceous) 
The temperature 
changes are based on isotopic temperatures obtained 
by Emiliam (1966) and maps derived by Sinitsyn 
(1965,1967) (see Budyko, 1982) 
II) 
subtracting the temperature change attributed to 
changes in the solar constant which is assumed to 
have increased by 5% every billion years, and to 
changes in surface albedo A \c/c increase in solar 
constant is assumed to raise the global mean surface 
temperature by 1 4°C The changes in albedo are 
derived from the ratio of land to ocean, and each 0 01 
reduction in albedo is assumed to have raised global 
mean temperature by 2°C 
These corrections 
contribute to between 259f and 50% of the total 
change 
III) 
relating the residual warming to the estimated change 
in atmospheric COi concentrations The CO2 
concentrations aie denvcd from a carbon cycle 
model The concentrations during the Eocene are 
estimated to be more than five times greater than 
present, and for the Cretaceous nine times greater 
(Budyko et al , 1987) On the other hand Shackleton 
(1985) argued that it is possible to constrain the total 
CO2 in the ocean, and suggests that atmospheric 
COo concentrations were unlikely to have been more 
than double today's value 
The result is a sensitivity of 3 0°C for a doubling of CO2, 
with a possible range of ± 1 °C, which is very similar to that 
obtained on the basis of numerical simulations (Section 5) 
3 5 12 Consti uc tion of the analogue pattei ns 
In their study, Budyko et al (1987) used the mid-Holocene 
(5-6 kbp) the Last Interglacial (Eemian or Mikulmo,125 
kbp) and the Pliocene (3-4 mbp) as analogues tor future 
climates January, July and mean annual tempei atures and 
mean annual precipitation were reconstiucted lor each of 
the above three epochs (see Figuies 7 3, 7 4 and 7 5) 
Estimates of the mean temperatures over the Northern 
Hemisphere exceeded the tempei ature at the end ol the pre-
mdustnal period (the 19th century) by approximately 1°, 2° 
and 3-4°C during the mid-Holocene, Eemian and Pliocene 
respectively These periods were chosen as analogues ol 
future climate for 2000, 2025 and 2050 respectively 
Although the nature of the forcing during these periods 
was probably different, the relative values ol the mean 
latitudinal temperature change in the Northern Hemisphere 
for each epoch were similar in each case (Figure 3 3) Note 
however that the observational coverage was rather limited, 
especially for the Eemian when the land-based data came 
essentially from the Eastern Hemisphere (see Section 
7 2 2) Correlations were also calculated between estimated 
temperature anomalies for 12 regions of the Northern 
Hemisphere in each of the three epochs These were found 
to be statistically significant in most cases, despite the 
limited quality and quantity of data in the earlier epochs

The considerable similarity between the temperature 
anomaly maps lor the three different epochs suggests that 
the regional temperature anomaly changes are, to a first 
approximation, directly proportional to increasing mean 
global temperature 
If this is true,, then the regional 
distributions of surface air temperature anomalies are 
analogous to each other and the similarities between these 
maps also suggest that the empirical methods for estimating 
the spatial temperature distribution with global warming 
may be relatively robust 
Similarly, annual mean precipitation changes have been 
reconstructed, though the patterns in the mid Holocene 
dillei from those found tor the other two periods (see 
Section 5 4, Section 7 2 2) 
When reconstructions of past climate conditions are 
accurate and thorough, they can provide relatively reliable 
estimates of self-consistent spatial patterns of climatic 
changes Weaknesses in developing these relationships can 
arise because of uncertainties

3.5.2 Atmospheric 
General Circulation 
Models 
Geneial circulation models are based on the physical 
conseivation laws which describe the redistribution of 
momentum, heat and water vapour by atmospheric 
motions 
All ol these processes aie toimulated in the 
piunitive equations which describe the bchavioui of a 
lluid (air or water) on a rotating body (the Eaith) undei the 
influence of a differential heating (the temperatuie contrast 
between equator and pole) caused by an external heat 
souice (the Sun) These governing equations are non-lmeai 
paitial dilleiential equations whose solution cannot be 
obtained except by numcncal methods These numencal 
methods subdivide the atmosphere veitically into discrete

prevent the solution from becoming numerically unstable, 
the time step must be made smaller than a value that 
depends on the speed of the fastest moving disturbance 
(wave), the the grid size (or smallest resolved wavelength), 
and the integration method 
The spatial resolution of GCM's is constrained for 
practical reasons by the speed and memory capacity of the 
computer used to perform the numerical integrations 
Increasing the resolution not only increases the memory 
required (linearly for vertical resolution, quadratically for 
horizontal resolution), but also generally requires a 
reduction in the integration time step Consequentially, the 
computer time required increases rapidly with increasing 
resolution Typical models have a horizontal resolution of 
^00 to 1000 km and between 2 and 19 vertical levels 
These resolutions are sufficient to represent large-scale 
features of the climate, but allow only a limited 
interpretation of results on the regional scale 
1 S2 I 
Plnsicalpaiamcteirations 
Due to their limited spatial resolution, GCM's do not (and 
will not with any foreseeable increase of resolution) resolve 
seveial physical processes of importance to climate 
However the statistical effects ot these sub grid-scale 
processes on the scales lesolved by the GCM have to be 
incoipoiated into the model by relating them to the 
iesolvcd scale variables (wind, tcmpciaturc, humidity and 
surlacc pressure) themselves Such a process is called 
paiametnzation, and is based on both obseivational and 
theoietical studies Figure ^ 5 shows the physical processes 
paramctcn/ed in a typical GCM, and then interactions 
? ^ 2 2 Radiation and the effect of e lands 
The paiametnzation of iadiation is possibly the most 
important issue lor climate change experiments, since it is 
thiough iadiation that the effects of the giccnhouse gases 
aie lianslened into the geneial cuculation A radiation

the incoming solar radiation and the outgoing terrestrial 
long-wave radiation and, as appropriate, the reflection, 
emission and absorption of these fluxes in the atmosphere 
Absorption and emission are calculated in several broad 
spectral bands (for reasons of economy) taking into account 
the concentration of different absorbers and emitters like 
CO2, water vapour, ozone and aerosols 
One sensitive part in any radiation scheme is the 
calculation of the radiative effect of clouds In early GCM 
experiments clouds were prescribed using observed cloud 
climatologies (fixed cloud (FC) experiments), and were not 
allowed to alter during the experiments with (for example) 
changed CO2 concentration Later schemes contained 
interactive cloud parametrizations of various soph 
istication, but mostly based on an estimate of the cloud 
amount lrom the relative humidity (RH experiments) 
Only the most advanced schemes calculate the variation ot 
cloud optical properties by the cloud water content (CW 
experiments) 
Capital letters in brackets 
indicate 
abbreviations used in Table 3 2 (a) and 3 2 (b) 
The seasonal variation ol the solar insolation is included 
in almost all experiments, but a diuinal cycle is omitted in 
many simulations Climate experiments run without a 
seasonal cycle are limited in scope and their reliability for 
climate change experiments is therefore doubtful 
The 
inclusion of the diurnal cycle improves the realism of some 
feedback mechanisms and therefore the quality of the 
climate simulations 
3 5 2 3 Sub gi id-scale tianspoi tt 
Most of the solar radiation absorbed by the climate system 
is absorbed at the surface This energy becomes available 
for driving the atmospheric general circulation only after it 
has been transferred to the atmosphere through the 
planetary boundary layer (PBL), primarily by small-scale 
turbulent and convective fluxes of sensible and latent heat, 
but also by net long-wave radiative exchange On the other 
hand, the general circulation is slowed down by fnctional 
dissipation which basically takes place in the PBL through 
vertical transport of momentum by turbulent eddies 
In most GCMs the turbulent fluxes of heat, water vapour 
and momentum at the surface are calculated from empirical 
bulk formulae 
with stability dependent 
transfer 
coefficients 
The fluxes at the PBL top (at a fixed height 
generally) are either neglected or parametrized from simple 
mixed-layer theory In GCMs that resolve the PBL, the 
eddy diffusion 
approach is generally 
employed 
Considerable efforts are made to incorporate into the PBL 
parametrizations the effects of cloud, vegetation and sub 
grid-scale terrain height 
Cumulus convection in a vertically unstable atmosphere 
is one of the main heat producing mechanisms at scales 
which are unresolvable in GCMs A common procedure is 
to adjust the temperature and water vapour profile to a 
conditionally stable state (Moist Convective Adjustment 
MCA) The second class of cumulus parametenzations 
often employed in GCMs is based on a 
moisture 
convergence closure (KUO) Other GCMs use Penetrative 
Convection (PC) schemes to mix moist conditionally 
unstable air from lower model layers with dry air aloft 
The question of how sophisticated convective para-
metenzations in GCMs need be, and how much the 
sensitivity of climate change experiments depends on their 
formulation is still open 
3 5 2 4 Land sw fac e pi oc esses 
Another important parametrization is the transfer of heat 
and water within the soil, for instance the balance between 
evaporation and precipitation, snow melt, storage of water 
in the ground and river runoff This parametrization is of 
cxtieme relevance for climate change predictions since it 
shows how local climates may change from humid to and 
and vice versa depending on global circulation changes It 
fuithermore reflects, in some of the more sophisticated 
schemes the changes that could occur through alterations 
in sin lace vegetation and land-use 
86 
Pi OL e s se s and Modellin u, 3 
Most soil moisture schemes used to date are based either 
on the so-called "bucket" method or the lorce-restore 
method In the former case, soil moisture is available from 
a single reservoir, or thick soil layer When all the moisture 
is used up, evaporation ceases In the latter method, two 
layers of soil provide moisture for evaporation, a thin, near-
surface layer which responds rapidly to precipitation and 
evaporation, and a thick, deep soil layei acting as a 
icservoir It the surface layer dries out, deep soil moisture 
is mostly unavailable for evaporation and evaporation iates 
lall to small values 
However, in the presence ol 
vegetation, realistic models use the deep soil layei as a 
source ol moisture lor evapotranspiration 
At any given gncl-point ovei land, a balance between 
piecipitation, evaporation, runoff and local accumulation of 
soil moisture is evaluated 
II precipitation exceeds 
evaporation, then local accumulation will occur until 
salutation is achieved 
Alter this, runofl is assumed and 
the excess water is removed The availability of this iunoff 
as liesh watei input to the ocean has been allowed for in 
ocean models only recently (Cubasch et al , 1990) Most 
models dilfct in the amount of freshwatei tequned foi 
saturation, and lew treat more than one soil type The 
lorce-restore method has recently been extended to include 
a uinge ol soil types by Noilham and Planton (1989) 
^ S 2 5 Bowulciiy conditions 
To detennine a unique solution of the model equations, it is 
necessaiy to specify a set of upper and lower boundary 
conditions These are 
input of solar radiation (including temporal variation) at 
the top ol the atmosphere, 
oiogiaphy and land sea distribution, 
albedo of bare land, 
suilacc roughness, 
vegetation chaiactenstics 
The lower boundary over the sea is either piescnbed 
liom clunatological data or, as this is not veiy appiopnate 
foi climate change experiments it has to be calculated by 
an ocean model As comprehensive ocean models are 
e\pensi\e to tun (see Section 3 5 3) the most commonly 
used ocean model coupled to attnospheie models is the 
mi\ed-layet model This model describes the uppcimost 
layei ol the ocean wheie the oceanic tempetatuic is 
lelatively umtoim with depth It is fiequently modelled as a 
simple slab loi which a lixed depth ol the mixed layer is 
piescnbed and the oceanic heat stoiage is calculated the 
oceanic heat tianspoit is either neglected oi is earned only 
within the mixed layei oi is piescnbed tiom climatology 
Sea ice extents aie deteimined mteiacti\el\ usualh with a 
\anant ot the theimoduiamic sea ice model due to Semtnei 
(1976) 
Such an ocean model e\identl\ has stiong 
limitations loi studies ot climate change paiticulatly as it 
docs not allow for the observed lags in heat storage of the 
upper ocean to be iepresented Variations of mixed-layer 
depth, oceanic heat flux convergence, and exchanges with 
the deep ocean, which would entail an additional storage 
and redistribution of heat, are all neglected as well 
Attempts have been made to couple atmospheric models to 
ocean models ol intermediate complexity Thus, for 
example, Hansen et al (1988) have used a low resolution 
atmospheric model run with a mixed layer model coupled 
diffusively to a deep ocean to simulate the time dependent 
response to a gradual increase in trace gases 
3.5.3 Ocean Models 
To simulate the role of the ocean more adequately, a 
number of dynamical ocean models have been developed 
(Bryan, 1969, Semtner, 1974, Hasselmann, 1982, Cox, 
1984, Oberhuber, 1989) The typical ocean model used for 
climate simulations lollows basically the same set of 
equations as the atmosphere if the equation defining the 
water vapour balance is replaced by one describing salinity 
As with atmosphenc GCMs, numerical solutions can be 
obtained by applying finite difference techniques and 
specifying appropriate surface boundary conditions (I e , 
fluxes of heat, momentum and fresh water) either from 
observations (uncoupled mode) or from an atmospheric 
GCM (coupled mode see Section 3 5 6) The vertical and 
horizontal exchange of temperature, momentum and 
salinity by diffusion or turbulent transfers is paiametrized 
The formation of sea-ice is generally treated as a purely 
thermodynamic piocess However, some models already 
include dynamical effects such as sea ice drift and 
deformation caused by winds and ocean currents 
(Oberhuber et al 1989) 
One of the pioblems ot simulating the ocean is the wide 
range of time and length scales involved The models for 
climate sensitivity studies resolve only the largest time and 
length scales (horizontal resolution 200 to 1000 km, time 
scale hours to 10 000 years, vertical resolution 2 to 20 
levels) High lesolulion models, which can resolve eddies, 
are now being tested (Semtnei and Chervin, 1988) but 
with the cuirently available computer power cannot be run 
sufficiently long enough to simulate climate changes 
3.5.4 Carbon Cycle Models 
The exchange of carbon dioxide between the ocean and 
atmosphere can be simulated by adding equations to the 
ocean component for the air-sea gas flux, the physics of gas 
solubility the chemistry of caibon dioxide buffering in sea 
watei and the biological pump (Maier Reimer and 
Hasselmann 1989) This extension of the coupled ocean-
atmosphere model will permit diagnosis of the frac-
tionation ol caibon dioxide between the atmosphere and 
ocean in the last hundied years and changes to that 
tiactionalion in the lutuie as the ocean begins to respond to 
3 Pi oc esses and Modelling 
87 
global warming, in particular through changes in the ocean 
mixed layer depth, which affects both the physical uptake 
ol carbon dioxide and the efficiency ol the biological 
pump The physical and chemical equations are well 
established, but more work is needed to establish equations 
for the biological pump The latter must parametrize the 
biological diversity, which vanes regionally and seasonally 
and is likely to vary as the climate changes, ideally the 
equations themselves must cope with such changes without 
introducing too many variables Candidate sets of such 
robust biological equations have been tested in one-
dimensional models and are now being used in ocean 
circulation models with encouraging results It seems likely 
that they will have to be incorporated into eddy-resolving 
ocean circulation models in order to avoid biases due to the 
patchy growth of plankton They will also have to pay 
special attention to the seasonal boundary layer (the 
biologist s euphotic zone) and its interaction with the 
permanent thermocline in order to deal with nutrient and 
carbon dioxide recirculation Such models are comp-
utationally expensive and complete global models based on 
these equations will have to await the arrival of more 
powerful supercomputers later in the 1990s Besides the 
biological organic carbon pump the biological calcium 
carbonate counter pump and interactions between the 
seawater and carbon sediment pools must be considered 
First results with models which include the organic carbon 
pump with a sediment icscrvoir indicate the importance ot 
these processes (Heinze and Maier Reimer 1989) 
3.5.5 Chemical Models 
Due to the increasing awareness of the importance of trace 
gases othei than CO2 a numbei of research groups have 
now started to develop models considering the chemical 
interactions between a variety of trace gases and the 
general circulation (Prather et al 1987) At the time ot 
writing, these models have not yet been used in the models 
discussed so far to estimate the global climate change It 
will be inteiesting to see then impact on futuie climate 
change modelling 
3 5.6 Coupled Models of the Atmosphere and the Ocean 
Due to the dominating influence of the ocean atmosphere 
link in the climate system, realistic climate change 
experiments require OGCM s and AGCM s to be coupled 
together by exchanging information about the sea surface 
temperatuie, the ice covei, the total (latent,sensible and net 
longwave radiative) heat flux, the solar radiation and the 
wind stress 
One basic problem in the construction of coupled models 
arises fiom the wide range of time scales from about one 
day foi the atmosphere to 1000 years foi the deep ocean 
Synchronously coupled atmospheic ocean models aie 
extremely time consuming and limited computei iesouiccs 
prohibit equilibrium being reached except with mixed-layer 
models Various asynchronous coupling techniques have 
been suggested to accelerate the convergence ot a coupled 
model However, the problem is far from being solved and 
can only really be tackled by using faster computers 
A second basic problem that arises through such 
coupling is model drift 
The coupled model normally 
drifts to a state that reflects the systematic errors of each 
respective model component because each sub model is no 
longer constrained by prescribed observed fluxes at the 
ocean-atmosphere interface Therefore flux correction 
terms are sometimes introduced to neutralize the climate 
drift and to obtain a realistic reference climate for climate 
change experiments (Sausen et al, 1988 Cubasch, 1989) 
(c f Section 4 9) However, these terms are additive and do 
not guarantee stability from further drift, They are also 
prescribed from present-day conditions and are not allowed 
to change with altered forcing from increased CO2 
Carbon cycle models have already been coupled to ocean 
models, but coupling to an AGCM-OGCM has not yet been 
carried out 
3.5.7 Use of Models 
Despite their shortcomings, models provide a powerful 
facility for studies of climate and climate change A review 
of such studies is contained in Schlesinger (1983) They are 
normally used for investigations of the sensitivity of 
climate to internal and external factors and for prediction of 
climate change by firstly carrying out a 
control 
integration with parameters set for present day climate in 
order to establish a reference mean model climatology and 
the necessary statistics on modelled climatic variability 
These can both be verified against the observed climate and 
used for examination and assessment of the subsequently 
modelled climate change The climate change (peit 
urbation) iun is then carried out by repeating the model run 
with appropriately changed parameters (a doubling of CCb 
for example) and the diffeicnces between this and the 
parallel control run examined The difference between the 
conliol and the peiturbed experiments is called the 
iesponse 
The significance of the response must be 
assessed against the model s natural variability (determined 
in the control run) using appropriate statistical tests These 
enable an assessment to be made (usually expressed in 
terms of probabilities) ot the confidence that the changes 
obtained tepresent an implied climatic change, rather than 
simply a result of the natural vanabihty of the model 
Typical integration times range from 5 to 100 yeais 
depending on the nature ol the investigation Until now 
most cfloit to study the response to increased levels of 
greenhouse gas concentrations has gone into determining 
the equilibrium response of climate to a doubling of CCn 
using atmospheric models coupled to slab ocean models A 
compaiatively small number ol attempts have been made to 
88 
determine the transient (1 e time-dependent) climate 
response to anthropogenic forcing using coupled atmos-
phere and ocean circulation models 
3 5 7 1 Equilibrium iespouse expenments 
In an equilibrium response experiment both simulations, 
1 e , the control experiment with the present amount of 
atmospheric CO2 and the perturbation experiment with 
doubled CO2, are run sufficiently long to achieve the 
respective equilibrium climates A review of such exp-
eriments is given in Schlesinger and Mitchell (1987) For a 
mixed-layer ocean the response time to reach equilibrium 
amounts to several decades, which is feasible with present 
day computers For a fully coupled GCM the equilibrium 
response time would be several thousand years and cannot 
be achieved with present day computers A comprehensive 
list of equilibrium response experiments can be found in 
Table 3 2(a) 
15 7 2 Time dependent 1 espouse experiments 
Equilibrium response studies tor given CO2 increases are 
required as standard benchmark calculations for model 
intercomparison The results may be misleading, however, 
it applied to actual climate change caused by man s 
activities, because the atmospheric CO2 concentrations do 
not change abruptly but have been growing by about 0 4% 
per year Moreover, the timing of the atmospheric response 
depends crucially on the ocean heat uptake which might 
delay the CO2 induced warming by several decades Thus, 
tot realistic climate scenario computations, not only have 
the atmospheric processes to be simulated with some 
lidchty but also the oceanic heat transport which is largely 
governed by ocean dynamics First experiments with 
coupled dynamical atmosphere ocean models have been 
performed (Table 3 2(b)) and will be discussed later in 
Section 6 
3.6 Illustrative Equilibrium Experiments 
In this section climate sensitivity results, as produced by a 
large number of general circulation models, are sum-
marized tor two quite diflerent climate change simulations 
The Inst relers to a simulation that was designed to 
suppress snow-ice albedo feedback so as to concentrate on 
the watei vapour and cloud feedbacks The second consists 
of a summary ot global wanning due to a COi doubling 
The first case, addressing only water vapour and cloud 
feedbacks consists ot a perpetual July simulation in which 
the climate was changed by imposing a 4°C peituibation on 
the global sea surface tempeiatuie while holding sea ice 
fixed Since a perpetual Jul) simulation with a geneial 
uiculation model results in vei> little snow covci in the

Model number 
Figure 3.6: Summary of the clear sky and global sensitivity 
parameters for 17 general circulation models 
Cess et al (1989), the main point is that it was chosen so as 
to minimize computer time and thus allow a large number 
of modelling groups to participate in the intercomparison 
This procedure is in essence an inverse climate change 
simulation Rather than introducing a radiative forcing into 
the models and then letting the model climates respond to 
this forcing, the climate change was instead prescribed and 
the models in turn produced their respective radiative 
forcings 
Cess et al (1989) have summarized climate sensitivity 
parameters as produced by 14 atmospheric general 
circulation models (most of them are referenced in Table 
3 2(a) and 3 2(b) This number has since risen to 17 
models and their sensitivity parameters (X as defined in 
Section 3 3 1) are summarized in Figure 3 6 The important 
point here is that cloud effects were isolated by separately 
averaging the models clear sky TOA fluxes, so that in 
addition to evaluating the climate sensitivity parameter for 
the globe as a whole (filled circles in Figure 3 6), it was 
also possible to evaluate the sensitivity parameter for an 
equivalent cleai-sky Earth (open circles) 
Note that the models are in remarkable agreement with 
respect to the clear sky sensitivity parameter, and the 
model aveiage A. = 0 47 Km2\y-' is consistent with the 
discussion ol water vapour feedback (Section 3 3 2), for 
which it was suggested that A, = 0 48 Km2w-1 There is, 
howevei 
a nearly threefold variation in the global 
sensitivity paiametcr and since the clear sky sensitivity 
parameteis aie in good agreement, then this implies that 
most of the disagieemcnts can be attributed to diffciences 
in cloud feedback A moic detailed demonstration of this is 
giscn by Cess et al (1989) The important conclusions 
3 Pi OC esses and Modelling 
89 
from this intercomparison are that the 17 models agree well 
with an observational 
determination of water vapour 
feedback, whereas improvements in the treatment of cloud 
feedback are needed if general circulation models are 
ultimately to be used as reliable climate predictions 
The second type of simulation refers to a doubling of 
atmospheric CO2, so that in proceeding from one equi-
librium climate to another, snow-ice albedo feedback is 
additionally activated in the general circulation models It 
must be cautioned however, that cloud feedback in this 
type of simulation should not be expected to be similar to 
that for the perpetual July simulation Furthermore, one 
should anticipate interactive effects between cloud feed-
back and snow-ice albedo feedback 
Summarized in Table 3 2(a) are ATs results, as well as 
the related changes in global precipitation, for CO2 
doubling simulations using a number of general circulation 
models All models show a significant increase in global-
mean temperature which ranges from 1 9°C to 5 2°C As in 
the perpetual July simulations, cloud feedback probably 
introduces a large uncertainty, although here it is difficult 
to quantify this point 
Most results lie between 3 5°C and 4 TC, although this 
does not necessarily imply that the correct value lies in this 
range Nor does it mean that two models with comparable 
ATs values likewise produce comparable individual 
feedback mechanisms 
For example 
consider the 
Wetherald and Manabe (1988) and Hansen et al (1984) 
simulations for which the respective ATs values are 4 0°C 
and 4 2°C Summarized in Table 3 3 are their diagnoses of 
individual feedback mechanisms These two models 
(labelled GFDL and GISS respectively) produce rather 
similar warmings in the absence of both cloud feedback 
and snow-ice albedo feedback The incorporation of cloud 
feedback, however, demonstrates that this is a stronger 
feedback in the GISS model, as is consistent with the 
perpetual July simulations But curiously the additional 
incorporation of snow-ice albedo feedback compensates for 
Table 3.3: Compai ison of ATs (°C) foi the GFDL and

their differences in cloud feedback Thus, while the two

quite different reasons 
It should be emphasized that Table 3 3 should not be 
used to appraise the amplification factor due to cloud 
feedback since feedback mechanisms are interactive For 
example, from Table 3 3 the cloud feedback amplifications 
for the GFDL and GISS models might be inferred to be 1 2 
and 1 6 respectively But, these are in the absence of snow-
ice albedo feedback Conversely, if snow-ice albedo 
feedback is incorporated before cloud feedback, then the 
respective amplification factors are 1 3 and 1 8 These 
larger values are due to an amplification of cloud feedback 
by snow-ice albedo feedback 
3.7 Summary 
Many aspects of the global climate system can now be 
simulated by numerical models The feedback processes 
associated with these aspects are usually well represented, 
but there appear to be considerable differences in the 
strength of the interaction of these processes in simulations 
using different models Section 4 examines results from 
various models in more detail 
Unfortunately, even though this is crucial for climate 
change prediction, only a few models linking all the main 
components of the climate system in a comprehensive way 
have been developed This is mainly due to a lack of 
computer resources, since a coupled system has to take the 
different timescales of the sub-systems into account, but 
also the task requires interdisciplinary cooperation 
An atmospheric general circulation model on its own can 
be integrated on currently available computers for several 
model decades to give estimates of the variability about its 
equilibrium response, when coupled to a global ocean 
model (which needs millennia to reach an equilibrium) the 
demands on computer time are increased by several orders 
of magnitude The inclusion of additional sub-systems and 
a refinement of resolution needed to make regional 
predictions demands computer speeds several orders of 
magnitude faster than is available on current machines 
We can only expect current simulations of climate 
change to be broadly accurate and the results obtained by 
existing models may become obsolete as more complete 
models of the climate system are used Results from fully 
coupled atmosphere ocean models are now beginning to 
emerge, these are given in Section 6 
The palaeo-analogue method, although of limited use lor 
detailed climate prediction (see Section 5), nevertheless 
gives valuable information about the spectrum ol past and 
future climate changes and provides data for the calibration 
of circulation models in climate regimes differing from the 
present Results from these calibrations are shown in 
Section 4

Executive Summary 
1 The validation of the present day climate simulated by 
atmospheric general circulation models shows that there is 
considerable skill in the portrayal of the large-scale distribution of 
the pressure, temperature, wind and precipitation in both summer 
and winter, although this success is in part due to the constraints 
placed on the sea surface temperature and sea-ice 
2 On regional scales there are significant errors in these variables 
in all models Validation for five selected regions shows mean 
surface air temperature errors of 2 to 3°C, compared with an 
average seasonal variation of 15°C Similarly, the simulation of 
precipitation exhibits errors on sub continental scales (1000-2000 
km) which differ in location between models Validation on these 
scales for the five selected regions shows mean errors of from 
20% to 50% of the average rainfall depending on the model 
3 The limited soil moisture data available show that the simulated 
middle latitude summer and winter distributions qualitatively 
reflect most of the observed large-scale characteristics 
4 Snow cover can be well simulated in winter apart from errors in 
regions where the temperature is poorly simulated. Though 
comparison is difficult in other seasons because of the different 
forms of model and observed data, it is evident that the broad 
seasonal variation can be simulated, although there are significant 
errors on regional scales 
5 The radiative fluxes at the top of the atmosphere, important for 
the response of climate to radiative perturbations, are simulated 
well in some models, indicating some skill in cloud 
parameterization 
Errors averaged around latitude circles are 
mostly less than 20 Wm"2 with average error magnitudes as low 
as 5 Wm-2 or about 2% of the unperturbed values, however, there 
are substantial discrepancies in albedo, particularly in middle and 
high latitudes due to the sensitivity of the parameterization 
schemes 
6. There has been a general reduction in the errors in more recent 
models as a result of increased resolution, changes in the 
parameterization of convection, cloudiness and surface processes 
and the introduction of parametenzations of gravity wave diag 
7 Although the daily and interannual variability of temperature 
and precipitation have been examined only to a limited extent, 
there is evidence that they are overestimated in some models, 
especially during summer The daily variability of sea-level 
pressure can be well simulated, but the eddy kinetic energy in the 
upper troposphere tends to be underestimated 
8 Our confidence that changes simulated by the latest 
atmospheric models used in climate change studies can be given 
credence is increased by their generally satisfactory portrayal of 
aspects of low-frequency variability, such as the atmospheric 
response to sea surface temperature anomalies associated with the 
El Nino and with wet and dry periods in the Sahel, and by their 
ability to simulate aspects of the climate at selected times during 
the last 18,000 years 
9 Models of the oceanic general circulation simulate many of the 
observed large scale features of ocean climate, especially in lower 
latitudes, although their solutions are sensitive to resolution and to 
the parameterization of sub-gndscale processes such as mixing 
and convective overturning 
10 Atmospheric models have been coupled with simple mixed 
layer ocean models in which a flux adjustment is often made to 
compensate for the omission of heat advection by ocean currents 
and for other deficiencies 
Confidence in these models is 
enhanced by their ability to simulate aspects of the climate of the 
last ice age 
11 Atmospheric models have been coupled with multi-layer 
oceanic general circulation models, in which an adjustment is 
sometimes made to the surface heat and salinity fluxes Although 
so far such models are of relatively coarse resolution, the large 
scale structure of the ocean and atmosphere can be simulated with 
some skill 
12 There is an urgent need to acquire further data for climate 
model validation on both global and regional scales, and to 
perform validation against data sets produced in the course of 
operational weather forecasting 
4 Validation of Climate Models

4.1 INTRODUCTION 
Climate models, and those based on general circulation 
models (GCMs) in particular, are 
mathematical 
formulations of atmosphere, ocean and land surface 
processes that are based on classical physical principles 
They represent a unique and potentially powerful tool for 
the study of the climatic changes that may result from 
increased concentrations of CO2 and other greenhouse 
gases in the atmosphere Such models are the only 
available means to consider simultaneously the wide range 
of interacting physical processes that characterize the 
climate system, and their objective numerical solution 
provides an opportunity to examine the nature of both past 
and possible future climates under a variety of conditions 
In order to evaluate such model estimates properly 
however, it is necessary to validate the simulations against 
the observed climate, and thereby to identify their 
systematic errors, particularly errors common to several 
models These errors or model biases must be taken into 
account in evaluating the estimates of future climate 
changes Additional caution arises from the GCMs' 
relatively crude treatment of the ocean and their neglect of 
other potentially-important elements of the climate system 
such as the upper atmosphere and atmospheric chemical 
and surface biological processes While it is to be expected 
that GCMs will gradually improve there will always be a 
range of uncertainty associated with their results, the 
scientific challenge to climate modelling is to make these 
uncertainties as small as possible 
The purpose of this section is to present an authoritative 
overview of the accuracy of current GCM based climate 
models, although space limitations have not allowed 
consideration of all climate variables We have also not 
considered the simpler climate models since they do not 
allow assessment of regional climate changes and have to 
be calibrated using the more complex models We begin 
this task by evaluating the models' ability to reproduce 
selected features of the observed mean climate and the 
average seasonal climate variations, after which we 
consider their ability to simulate climate anomalies and 
extreme events We also consider other aspects which 
increase our overall confidence in models such as the 
performance of atmospheric models in operational weather 
prediction and of atmospheric and coupled atmosphere-
ocean models in the simulation of 
low-frequency 
variability and palaeo-climates 
4.1.1 Model Overview 
The models that have been used for climate change 
experiments have been described in Section 1 S and aie 
discussed further below 
Because of limitations in 
computing power, the higher resolution atmospheric 
models have so far been used only in conjunction with the 
simple mixed-layer ocean models, as in the equilibrium 
experiments in Section 5 Many of these models give 
results similar to those from experiments with prescribed 
sea surface temperature (SST) and sea-ice, because these 
variables are constrained to be near the observed values by 
use of prescribed advective heat fluxes This assessment 
places an upper bound on the expected performance of 
models with more complete representations of the ocean, 
whose results are discussed in Section 6 
Although the atmospheric models that have been 
developed over the past several decades have many 
differences in their formulations and especially in their 
physical parametenzations, they necessarily have a strong 
family resemblance It can therefore be understood that 
though they all generate simulations which are to a 
substantial degree realistic, at the same time they display a 
number of systematic errors in common, such as 
excessively low temperatures in the polar lower 
stratosphere and excessively low levels of eddy kinetic 
energy in the upper troposphere On a regional basis 
atmospheric GCMs display a wide variety of errors, some 
of which are related to the parametenzations of sub-grid-
scale processes and some to the models' limited resolution 
Recent numerical experimentation with several models has 
revealed a marked sensitivity of simulated climate (and 
climate change) to the treatment of clouds 
while 
significant 
sensitivity to the parameterization ol 
convection, soil moisture and fnctional dissipation has also 
been demonstrated These model errors and sensitivities 
and our cuirent uncertainty over how best to represent the 
processes involved require a serious consideration of the 
extent to which we can have confidence in the performance 
oi models on different scales 
As anticipated above, the first part of this validation of 
climate models focuses on those models that have been 
used for equilibrium experiments with incieascd CO2 as 
discussed in Section S Many of the models considered 
(Tabic 3 2(a) - see caption to Figure 4 1(a) foi models 
leference numbers) are of relatively low resolution since 
until recently it is only such models that could be integrated 
for the long periods lequired to obtain a clear signal To 
represent the seasonal cycle realistically and to estimate 
equilibrium climate change the ocean must be represented 
in such a way that it can respond to seasonal forcing with 
an appropriate amplitude All the models in Table 1 2(a) 
have been run with a coupled mixed-layer or slab ocean 
The period used for validation of these models is typically 
about ten years this is believed to be sufficient to define 
the mean and standard deviation of atmospheric variables 
loi validation purposes Additionally some of these models 
(versions listed in Table 1 2(b)) have been coupled to a 
dynamic model of the deeper ocean (see Section 6)

Validation of Climate Models 4 
4 1.2 Methods and Problems of Model Validation 
The questions we need to answei in this assessment 
concern the suitability of individual models foi estimating 
climate change The response ol modelled climate to a 
perturbation ol the radiative or other forcing has been 
shown to depend on the control climate How serious can a 
model's errors be lor its response to a perturbation still to 
be credible' Mitchell et al (1987) pointed out that it may 
be possible to allow for some discrepancies between 
simulated and observed climates, provided the patterns are 
sufficiently alike that relevant physical mechanisms can be 
identified Foi example, they found that with increased 
CO2 and incieased suiface tempeiatures, piecipitation 
tended to increase where it was already heavy, so that 'f a 
rainbclt was dilierently located in two models, the response 
patterns could differ but still have the same implications for 
the teal climate change However, although a perfect 
simulation may not be required, it is clear that the better the 
simulation the more reliable the conclusions concerning 
climate change that may be made Also, since, as discussed 
in Section 3, the magnitude ol the response depends on the 
feedbacks, these feedbacks should be realistically rep-
resented in the models Thus, in selecting model variables 
with which to validate atmospheric components of the 
climate models, we considered the following 
a) 
Variables that are impoitant loi the description of the 
atmospheric circulation and which therefore ought to 
be realistically portrayed in the control simulations if 
the modelled changes are to be given credence 
Examples include sea-level pressure and atmospheric 
wind and temperature, and their variability as 
portrayed by the kinetic energy of eddies 
b) 
Variables that are critical in defining climate changes 
generated by greenhouse gases These data also need 
to be realistic in control simulations for the present 
climate if the model predictions are to be credible 
Examples include surlace air temperature, pre-
cipitation, and soil moisture, along with their day-to-
day and year-to-year variability 
c) 
Variables that are important tor climate feedbacks If 
they are poorly simulated, we cannot expect changes 
in global and regional climate to be accurately 
estimated Examples are snow cover sea-ice, and 
clouds and their radiative effects 
In general, the assessments made can only be relative in 
character It is not usually possible to specify a critical 
value that errois must not exceed Thus temperatuie 
changes may be realistically simulated c\en when the 
modelled tempeiatures are in error by seveial degrees, for 
example, the error may be due to excessive night time 
cooling of air near the surface which may have little effect 
on other aspects ot the simulation On the other hand it 
may be obvious that an erroi is too serious tor much 
ciedence to be given to changes in a particular region 
for 
example, a piediction ol changes in temperature in a 
coastal region with observed winds off the ocean, if the 
simulated winds blow off the land To allow the reader to 
make such assessments, maps are shown for a number of 
key variables and models lor which detailed changes are 
depicted in Section 5 
The validation of climate models requires, of couise, the 
availability of appropriate observed data For some 
variables of interest, observed data are unavailable, or are 
available for only certain regions of the world In addition 
to traditional chmatological data, useful compilations of a 
number of variables simulated by climate models have 
been piovided by Schut/ and Gates (1971, 1972), Oort 
(1983) and Levitus (1982), and more recent compilations 
ol atmospheric statistics have been made using analyses 
from operational weather prediction (see, for example, 
Trenberth and Olson, 1988) Rather than attempting to 
provide a comprehensive summary of observed climatic 
data, we have used what appear to be the best available 
data in each case, even though the length and quality of the 
data are uneven Satellite observing systems also provide 
important data sets with which to validate some aspects of 
climate models, and when fully incorporated in the data 
assimilation routines of operational models such data are 
expected to become an important new source of global data 
for model validation 
A wide range of statistical methods has been used to 
compare model simulations with observations (Livezey, 
198<>, Katz, 1988, Wigley and Santer, 1990, Santer and 
Wigley, 1990) 
No one method, however, is "ideal" in 
view of the generally small samples and high noise levels 
involved and the specific purposes of each validation 
Other factors that can complicate the validation process 
include variations in the form in which variables are 
represented in different models, for example, soil moisture 
may be expressed as a fraction of soil capacity or as a 
depth, and snowcover may be portrayed by the fractional 
cover or by the equivalent mass of liquid water Another 
problem is the inadequate representation of the distribution 
of some climatic variables obtainable with available 
obseivations, such as precipitation over the oceans and soil 
moisture 
Another method of validation which should be 
considered is internal validation where the accuracy of a 
particular model process or parameterization is tested by 
comparison with observations or with results of more 
detailed models of the process This approach has only 
been applied to a very limited extent The best example is 
the validation of radiative tiansfer calculations conducted 
under the auspices of the WCRP programme for 
Intercomparison of Radiation Codes in Climate Models 
(ICRCCM) This intercomparison established the relative 
accuiacy of radiation codes for clear sky conditions against 
4 Validation of Climate Models 
101 
line-by-line calculations, and has led to improvements in 
several climate models Similarly, the intcrcompanson of 
simulated 
cloud-radiative 
forcing 
with 
satellite 
observations from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment 
(ERBE) should result in improvements in the rep-
resentation of clouds in climate models 
In addition to validation of the present climate, it is 
instructive to consider the evidence that climate models are 
capable of simulating climate changes Important evidence 
comes from atmospheric models when used in other than 
climate simulations, since the ocean surface tcmperatuic is 
often constrained in similar ways Relevant experiments in 
this regard for atmospheric models are those with 
variations of tropical sea-surface temperature (SST) in the 
El Nino context Numerical weather prediction, which uses 
atmospheric models that are similar in many respects to 
those used in climate simulation, provides an additional 
source of validation The simulation of climate since the 
last glacial maximum, for which we have some knowledge 
of the land ice, trace gas concentrations and ocean surface

temperatures, also provides a useful test of climate models 
Finally for validation of the experiments on transient 
climate change discussed in Section 6, it is important to 
consider the validation of ocean and coupled ocean-
atmosphere models 
4.2 Simulation of the Atmospheric Circulation 
In this section we consider a number of basic atmospheric 
variables for which validation data arc readily available 
and whose satisfactory simulation is a prerequisite for 
confidence in the models ability to portray climate change 
4.2.1 Sea-Level Pressure 
The sea-level pressure pattern provides a uselul char 
dctcn/ation ol the atmospheric circulation near the surface 
and is closely related to many aspects of climate A simple 
but revealing measure of the pressuie pattern is the north-
south profile ol the zonal average (average around a 
latitude circle) (Figure 4 1) In both solstitial seasons the 
structure is rather similar, with a deep Antarctic trough 
subtropical ridges with a near-equatorial trough between 
and a rather weak and asymmetric pattern in northern 
middle and high latitudes The models approximate the 
observed pattern with varying degrees ol success all 
simulate to some extent the subtropical ridges and 
Antarctic tiough The ridges are in some cases displaced 
polewaid and theie is a consideiable range in then strength 
particulaily in the NH (Northern Hemisphere) In the lower 
iesolution models the Antarctic tiough is generally too 
weak and sometimes poorly located 
The dependence ot the simulation of the Antarctic trough 
on resolution evident here for the GFDL and UKMO 
models has been found in several pievious studies 
(Manabc et al 
1978 Hansen et al 1981 Dyson 198^) 
While Manabc et al lound it to be maikcd in the GFDL 
spectial models only in July the similai GFDL model 
consideied heie shows it clearly in Januaiy also The earlier 
GFDL result is consistent with expenments with the CCC 
model by Boei and La/aie (1988) showing only a slight 
deepening of an alieady deep Antarctic trough as resolution 
was mcicased The important lesult in the present context 
is that the moie realistic models used in CO2 expenments 
aie those with higher resolution (CCC GFHI and UKHI) 
The NH winter subtropical ridge is too strong in most 
models while the decrease in pressure fiom this ridge to 
the mid-latitude trough is generally excessive this is 
associated with excessively deep oceanic lows in some 
models and with spurious westerlies ovei the Rockies in 
otheis The westerlies in high iesolution models are ver\ 
sensitive to the ^presentation of the diag associated with 
giaxitv waves induced by mountains without it a ring of 
strong westerlies extends around middle latitudes dining 
northern winter (Slingo and Pearson 1987) 
The models simulate the seasonal reversal from northern 
summer to winter (for example Figure 4 2) To some 
degree this reflects the dominance of thermal forcing of the 
pressure pattern and the fact that most of the models have 
ocean temperatures which are kept close to climatology 
Summer temperatures over land are strongly affected by 
the availability ol soil moisture (see Section 4 1 1), the 
absence of evaporative cooling generates higher surface 
temperatuie and lower pressure as in the "dry land" 
experiment ol Shukla and Mintz (1982) This effect is 
evident in some ot the models simulations of pressure over 
land in the summer A serious shortcoming of the lower 
resolution models in the northern summer is the tendency 
to develop too strong a ridge between the Azores high and 
the Arctic, this error shows up as the absence of a trough 
near 60°N in Figuie 4 1(b) and was also found in previous 
assessments (e g , Manabe et al 1978, Dyson, 1985) 
The variability of the pressure pattern can usefully be 
separated into the daily variance within a month and the 
interannual vailability of monthly means 
Both are 
simulated with some skill by models, especially the daily 
variance (e g Figure 4 3) in particular, the variability 
maxima over the eastern Atlantic and northeast Pacific are 
well simulated and in the Southern Hemisphere high 
values arc simulated near 60°S as observed These results 
indicate that the models can successfully simulate the 
major storm tracks in middle latitudes On smaller scales, 
however there are regionally important errors, associated 
for example with the displacements of the variability 
maxima in the Northern Hemisphere 
In summary the recent higher resolution models are 
capable of generally realistic simulations of the time 
averaged sea level pressure and of the temporal pressure 
variability 
4.2 2 Temperature 
While models successfully simulate the major features of 
the observed tempciature structure of the atmosphere, all 
models contain systematic errors such as those shown in 
the simulated zonally averaged temperatures in Figure 4 4 
Of eirors common to many models, the most notable is the 
general coldness of the simulated atmosphere, simulated 
tempeiatures in the polar upper troposphere and lower 
stratosphere are too low in summer by more than 10°C 
while the lower troposphere in tropical and middle latitudes 
is too cold in both summer and winter The latter error may 
in some cases be alleviated by increasing the hon/ontal 
resolution (Boer and Lazare 1988, Ingram, personal 
communication) 
The existence of such common 
deficiencies despite the considerable differences in the 
models resolution numerical treatments and physical 
parameten/ations 
implies that all models may be 
misrepiesenting (01 indeed omitting) some physical 
mechanisms

(a) December-January-February, (b) June-July-August 
conditions, as caused, for example, by cyclones and 
meanders ot the jet stream A measure of the intensity of 
the eddies is the "eddy kinetic energy" (EKE), which is 
observed to be largest in the extratropical latitudes in the 
upper troposphere 
A persistent error ot atmospheric general circulation 
models is their tendency to undeiestimatc the EKF 
paiticularly the transient 
pan representing vanations 
about the time-aveiaged How When intcgiated Irom ical 
initial conditions the models tend to lose EKE in the 
couise ol the integiation until the> reach their own 
characteristic climate For example, Figure 4 7 compares 
the transient EKE for December-January-February in a 
version of the CCC model (Boer and Lazare, 1988) with 
the corresponding observed EKE (Trenberth, personal 
communication), and shows a significant underestimate of 
the EKE maxima in middle latitudes There is a suggestion 
ot overestimation in the tropics Similar results have been 
obtained loi loiecast models (WGNE 1988 see also 
Section 4 7) Since leccnt expcuments have indicated that 
resolution is not the basic reason tor this systematic EKE 
erroi (Boei and La/are 1988 Tibaldi et al , 1989), it is

probably caused by the models' treatment of physical 
processes. 
In summary, models suffer from a deficiency of transient 
eddy kinetic energy, an error which appears most marked 
in the upper extratropical troposphere and which may be 
reversed in the tropics. 
4.3 Simulation of Other Key Climate Variables 
In this section wc assess the global distribution of variables 
involved in the energy and hydrological balances whose 
satisfactory simulation is important for determining the 
climate's response to increased greenhouse gases. 
4.3.1 Surface Air Temperature 
The temperature of the air near the surface is an important 
climatic parameter. The global pattern is dominated by 
large pole to equator gradients which models simulate well 
(Figure 4.8) though it should be recalled that in most of the 
models shown, the ocean surface temperatures are main-
tained near the correct level by 'flux 
adjustment' 
techniques. Because of the dominance of the pole-to-
equator gradient, the maps shown (Figure 4.9) are of 
departures of temperature from the observed. Validation of 
this quantity from atmospheric GCMs is complicated by 
the models' low vertical resolution and by the relatively 
large diurnal variation of temperature near the surface. 
I OH 
Validation of Climate Models 4 
A principal conclusion lrom the comparison of simulated 
with observed near-surlace air temperature is that while 
each model displays systematic errors, there are few errors 
common to all models One characteristic error is that 
temperatures over eastern Asia are too cold in winter (e g , 
Figure 4 9(a) over southeast Asia) Another, common to 
most models, is that temperatures arc too high over the 
Antarctic ice sheet (Figure 4 8), in winter at least, this can 
be attributed to the models' difficulty in resolving the 
shallow cold surface layer In summer, errors in the 
simulated ground wetness appear to be responsible for 
many ol the temperature errors over the continents 
(compare Figures 4 8 and 4 12) this error being less 
marked in models with more complete representations of 
the land surface (e g , Figure 4 9) (Sec Section 4 4 for a 
detailed assessment for five selected areas) 
The variability of surface an tempcratuie can, like sea-
level pressure, be considered in terms of the day-to-day 
vaiidtions within d month or season, and the mterannual 
vdridtions of monthly or seasonal means 
Detailed 
validations of these quantities for selected regions in North 
America in relatively low resolution models have been 
made by Rind et al (1989) and Mearns et al, (199) Both 
found variances to be too high on a daily time-scale, while 
for mterannual timescales, the results differed between the 
models An earlier study by Reed (1986) with a version of 
the UKMO model (not in Table 3 2(a)) also revealed too 
high variability on a daily time-scale in eastern England 
On the other hand, for the models reviewed in this 
assessment for which data were available, the daily 
vaiidnce appeared to be capable of realistic simulation 
though it tended to be deficient over northern middle 
latitudes, especially in summer 
In summary, the patterns of simulated surface air 
temperature are generally similar to the observed Errors 
common to most models include excessively cold air over 
edstern Asid in winter dnd too waim conditions over 
Antaictica Errors over the continents in summer are often 
associated with errors in ground wetness 
4.3.2 
Precipitation 
A realistic simuldtion of precipitation is essential tor many 
if not all studies of the impact of climate change A number 
of estimates of the distributions of precipitation from 
obseivations are available, some of these are derived from 
station observations, which are generally considered 
adequate over land, one is derived from 
satellite 
measuiements of outgoing longwave radiation (Arkin and 
Mcisnei, 1987, Arkin and Ardanuy 1989) while another is 
from ship observations of cunent weathei coupled with 
estimated equivalent iainlall idles (e g 
Donnan and 
Bouike 1979) The differences among these analyses aie 
not insigniticant 
but aie mostl\ 
smaller than the 
diffeiences between the analyses and model simulations 
While all models simulate the broad features of the 
observed precipitation pattern, with useful regional detail in 
some regions, (see, lor example the zonally averaged 
patterns in Figure 4 10 and the patterns for the higher 
resolution models in Figuie 4 11), significant errors are 
present, such as the generally inddequdte simuldtion of the 
southeast Asia summei monsoon rainfall (see also Section 
4 5 3), the zonal rainfall gradient across the tropical Pacific, 
and the southern summer rains in the Zaire basin These 
errors reduce the correlation between observed and 
modelled patterns over land to about 0 75 (model 22, Table 
3 2(a)) A similar level of skill is evident in the assessment 
in Section 4 4 2 Some of the earlier models underestimate 
the dryness of the subtropics (Figure 4 10), while several 
models are much too wet in high latitudes in winter 
Models that do not use a flux correction to ensure an 
appioximately correct SST fail to simulate the eastern and 
central equatorial Pacific dry zone (not shown) There are 
also large differences between the recent model simulations 
of the intensity of the tropical oceanic rainbelts though the 
(inevitable) uncertainties in the observed ocean pre-
cipitation can make it unclear which models are nearer 
reality 
Rind et al (1989) and Mearns et al (1990) have found 
that over the USA mterannual variability of simulated 
precipitation in the GISS and NCAR models is generally 
excessive in both summer and winter, while daily 
variability is not seriously biased in either season, at least 
relative to the mean precipitation The NCAR study also 
revealed considerable sensitivity of the daily precipitation 
to the model formulation, particularly to aspects of the 
parameterization of evaporation over land Analyses of the 
UKMO model (Reed, 1986, Wilson and Mitchell, 1987) 
over western Europe showed that there were too many rain 
days, although occurrences of heavy 
rain were 
underpredicted 
In summary, current atmospheric models are capable of 
realistic simulations of the broadscale precipitation pattern 
provided the ocean surface temperatures are accurately 
represented All the models assessed, however, have some 
important regional precipitation errors 
4.3.3 Soil Moisture 
Soil moisture is a climatic variable that hds d significant 
impact on ecosystems and agriculture 
Some model 
experiments on the impact of increasing greenhouse gases 
on climate have shown large decreases in soil moisture 
over land in summer, this can provide a positive feedback 
with highei surface temperatures and decreased cloud 
cover Since there is no global coverage of obseivations of 
soil moistuie its validation is difficult Estimates of soil 
moisluie have been made by Mintz and Serafini (1989) 
from piecipitation data and estimates of evaporation but 
comparison with a recent analysis of observations over the

western USSR (Vinnikov and Yeserkepova, 1990) suggests 
the estimates are too low in high latitudes in summer 
(Table 4 11 
Compared with the Mintz-Serafini 
observational 
estimates, model simulations generally show a greater 
seasonal variation, especially in the tropics In general the 
simulations errors in soil moisture resemble those in 
precipitation, and vary considerably among models, as is 
evident I mm the zonally averaged June-August data 
(Figure 4 12) The simulations ovei Euiasia and norlhein 
Africa aic quite close to the "observed" in most models 
Howevci the zonally averaged data and also compaiison 
with the USSR data (e g , Table 4 1), suggests that some 
models become too dry in summer in middle latitudes All 
models have difficulty with the extent of the aridity over 
Australia, especially in the (southern) summer 
In summary, the limited soil moisture data available 
show that the simulated middle latitude summer and winter 
distributions qualitatively reflect most of the observed 
large-scale characteristics However, there are large 
differences in the models' simulations of soil moisture, as 
expected from the precipitation simulations, and it should 
be emphasized that the representation (and validation) of 
soil moisture in current climate models is still relatively

4.3.4 Snow Cover 
Snow is an important climate element because of its high 
reflectivity for solar radiation and because of its possible 
involvement in a feedback with temperature The correct 
simulation of snow extent is thus critical for accurate 
prediction of the response to increasing greenhouse gases 
Snow cover observations used for model validation were a 
15 year satellite-derived data set of the frequency of cover 
(Matson et al, 1986) and an earlier snow depth data set 
(Arctic Construction and Frost Effects Laboratory, 1954) 
These observations document the expected maximum snow

cover in the Northern Hemisphere winter, with Southern 
Hemisphere snow confined mainly to Antarctica 
Detailed assessments of the simulations, especially for 
seasons other than winter, are hindered by the different 
forms of the model data (mostly seasonal mean liquid 
water content) and the observed data (either frequency of 
cover or maps of depth at ends of months) While all 
models capture the gross features of the seasonal cycle of 
snow cover, some models exhibit large errors Otherwise, 
except over eastern Asia where snow extents are mostly 
excessive (consistent with the low simulated temperatures 
(e g , Figure 4 9)), the models' average winter snow depths 
can be near those observed, this is illustrated for North 
America in Figure 4 13, which compares the observed 5cm 
snowdepth contour at the end ot January with the modelled 
lcm liquid water equivalent contour averaged for 
December to February Comparable results are obtained 
over Europe and western Asia 
In summary, several models achieve a broadly realistic 
simulation of snow cover Provided snow albedos are

realistic, the simulated snow extent should thus not distort 
simulated global radiative feedbacks However, there are 
significant errors in the snow cover on regional scales in all 
models 
4.3.5 Sea-Ice 
An accurate simulation of sea-ice is important for a 
model's ability to simulate climate change by virtue of its 
profound effect on the surface heat flux and radiative 
feedbacks in high latitudes An attempt is made to ensure a 
good simulation of sea-ice extent by including a prescribed 
ocean heat flux in many current models, this flux is 
assumed to be unchanged when the climate is perturbed 
Without it, models tend to simulate excessive temperature 
gradients between pole and equator, particularly in the 
Northern Hemisphere winter, with a consequent excess of 
sea-ice Sea-ice in the Arctic Ocean is constrained to 
follow the coast in winter, but in summer and autumn the 
ice separates from the coast in many places, this behavioui 
is simulated by some models Experiments with relatively 
sophisticated dynamic-thermodynamic sea-ice models 
(Hibler, 1979, Hibler and Ackley, 1983, Owens and 
Lemke, 1989) indicate that a realistic simulation ot sea-ice 
variations may require the inclusion of dynamic effects, 
although the optimal representation for climate applications 
has not yet been determined Although the thickness of sea-
ice is not readily validated due to the inadequacy of 
observational data, models display substantial differences 
in simulated sea-ice thickness 
In summary, considerable improvement in the rep-
resentation of sea ice is necessary belore models can be 
expected to simulate satisfactorily high-latitude climate 
changes 
4.3.6 Clouds and Radiation 
The global distribution of clouds has been analysed lrom 
satellite data ovei recent yeais in ISCCP, and the diagnosed 
cloud cover can be compared with modelled cloud 
Foi 
example, Li and Letreut (1989) showed that the patterns of 
cloud amounts in a 10-day foiecast were similar to those 
diagnosed in ISCCP over Africa in July, but were deficient 
over the southeast Atlantic However, the definition of 
cloud may differ from model to model and between model 
and observations so, as discussed by Li and Letreut, it is 
often easier and more satisfactory to compare measuiable 
radiative quantities A useful indication of cloud cover can 
be obtained fiom top-of-the-atmospherc satellite meas 
urements of the outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and 
planctaiy albedo, as provided by Nimbus 7 Earth Radiation 
budget measurements (Hartmann et al , 1986 Ardanuy ct 
al 
1989) These quantities describe the exchange ol 
energy between the whole climate system (ocean, ground 
ice and atmosphcie) and outer space, and in that sense 
constitute the net toicine ol the climate At the same time

Zonally averaged planetary albedo for December-January-February (models) and for January (observed, Nimbus-7 
they depend critically on many mechanisms that are 
internal to the climate system, and in particular the 
hydrological cycle As a result, the ability ot models to 
simulate the OLR and planetary albedo properly depends 
not only on the algoiithms used to compute the radiative 
tiansleis within the atmosphere but also on the simulated 
snow cover, surface temperature and clouds 
The zonally averaged OLR (Figuie 4 14) is dominated 
by maxima in low latitudes and minima in high latitudes 
Clouds generate minimum OLR near the tropical con-
vergence zones, which are also evident as maxima in the 
albedo (Figure 4 15) The increase in albedo toward high 
latitudes, on the other hand, can be associated with clouds, 
snow and ice, or changes in land surface type and solar 
/enith angle 
Because ol the important radiative elfects ol clouds and 
their association with precipitation, observed tropical and 
subtropical OLR extremes are highly correlated with those

IIS 
of piecipitation In general, in tropical regions the models' 
OLR values are realistic, and models successfully simulate 
the correlation of precipitation with planetary albedo At 
higher latitudes in winter, there is considerable dispaiity 
among models in the simulated values ol planetary albedo, 
evidently due to the differing simulations of snow cover 
and/or clouds and the different specifications of albedo for 
particular surfaces or cloud types In general, the models 
simulate polar OLR minima which are below the observed 
values, probably because of the temperature errors there 
(Figure 4 4, 4 8) Apart from these high latitude regions, 
the zonally averaged OLR is generally within 20 Wm 2 0f 
the observed The mean error magnitudes for individual 
models are as low as 5 Wm-2 (Model 20, Table 3 2(a)) or 
2% of the climatological values For absorbed solar 
radiation, errors are mostly below 20 Wm-2 with albedo 
errors less than 0 1 except in northern middle and high 
latitudes 
In summary, this assessment has shown that although the 
latitudinal variation of top of the atmosphere radiative 
parameters can be well simulated, there are some 
discrepancies, particularly in the albedo in middle and high 
latitudes due to the sensitivity of the parameterization 
schemes Most models underestimate the OLR in high 
latitudes 
4.4 Simulation of the Regional Seasonal Cycle 
The seasonal cycle constitutes the largest regularly 
observed change of the atmosphere-ocean system, and 
provides an important opportunity for model validation In 
general, all GCMs simulate a recognizable average 
seasonal variation of the principal climate variables, as 
measured by the phase and amplitude of the annual 
harmonic The seasonal variation of the amplitudes ol the 
transient and stationary waves can also be simulated with 
reasonable fidelity (eg 
the GLA GCM see Stiaus and 
Shukla, 1988 and Section 4 2 1) 
A moie detailed summaiy ol GCMs simulations ot the 
seasonal cycle and a comparison with obseivational 
estimates for live selected legions is given in Table 4 2 in 
terms of the suiface air tempeiatuie and piecipitation In 
this statistical summary, each model s gnd-point data ovei 
land areas within the selected region have been averaged 
without inteipolation oi area-weighting, the aieas aie 
bounded as follows Region 1 (35 50N, 85 105W), Region 
2(5-30N 70-105E), Region 3 (10-20N, 20W-40E), Region 
4 (35-50N, 10W-45E), Region 5 (10 45S, 110 155E) 
Similar areas are used in analysing regional changes in

4.41 Surface Air Temperature 
The surlacc tempeiature data in Table 4 2 aie toi the 
bottom model layer except for the CCC model loi which 
an estimate ol screen temperature at 2m was supplied For 
the UKMO models, 00GMT data were adjusted to daily 
means using detailed data lor selected points 
The 
differences between the model simulations are generally 
much larger than those between the observed data sets, 
with the best agreement among the models' surface air 
temperature occurring over southeast Asia in summer, and 
the poorest agreement over the Sahel in winter In general, 
the seasonal differences for each of the regions show that 
the models are, on average, capable of a good rep-
resentation of the seasonal variation of surface air 
temperature 
The magnitudes of the average errors of the individual 
models he in the range 2 6±0 8°C, with larger values in 
winter (3 1°C) than in summer (2 1°C) For the high 
resolution models, the average is 2 3°C These figures may 
be compared with the mean seasonal variation of 15 5°C 
There appears to be no surface air temperature bias 
common to all the models, although the models with higher 
resolution (of the eight assessed) show an average 
temperature below that observed Average regional errors 
are generally small, with only southeast Asia in winter 
having a mean error ( 2 6°C) of more than 1 5°C, the 
models average estimates of the seasonal range are within 
1 °C of that observed for each region except southeast Asia 
In summary, climate models simulate the regional 
seasonal cycle of surface air temperature with an error of 2 
to 3°C, though this eiror is in all cases a relatively small 
fraction of the seasonal temperature range itself 
4.4.2 Precipitation 
Average values ot the simulated and observed precipitation 
over the five regions are presented in Table 4 2 Most 
models succeed in identifying southeast Asia in summer as 
the wettest and the Sahel in winter as the driest seasonal 
precipitation regimes of those assessed, the region and 
season which gives the most difficulty appears to be 
southeast Asia in winter where several of the models are 
much too wet Indeed, all four northern winter validations 
reveal a pieponderance of positive errors and Australia 
also lends to be too wet The mean magnitude of model 
cnoi vanes quite widely between models, from 0 5 to 1 2 
mm da>~', oi horn 20 to 50% ot the observed the three 
higher resolution models have the smallest mean errors 
The relatively large diflerences among the models indicate 
the difficulty of accurately simulating precipitation in a 
specihc legion (even on a seasonal basis), and underscores 
the need for improved parameterization of precipitation 
mechanisms 
In summary as for temperature, the range ot model skill 
in simulating the seasonal precipitation is substantial the 
mean enors being from 20% to 50% of the average 
precipitation The models tend to overestimate precipitation 
in wintei

4.5 Simulation of Regional Climate Anomalies 
4.5.1 Response to El Nino SST Anomalies 
The El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon is 
now recognized to be an irregular oscillation of the coupled 
ocean/atmosphere system in the tropical Pacific, occurring 
approximately every three to five years. During the peak 
of an El Nifio. sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the 
eastern tropical Pacific can be several degrees wanner than 
the climatological mean. The convective rainfall maximum 
is shifted towards the warm SST anomalies, and the 
associated anomalous latent heat release forces changes in 
the large scale atmospheric circulation over the Pacific 
basin (and this in turn helps to maintain the anomalous 
SST). In addition, there is evidence that the extratropical

are calculated from OLR data, simulated anomalies are the

jet streams are significantly displaced from their 
chmatological positions during strong El Nino events, 
particularly over the North Pacific and North America 
(Fennessy and Shukla, 1988a) 
Before the capability of coupled atmosphere/ocean 
GCMs to simulate El Nino and its teleconnections can be 
assessed, it is first necessary to assess whether the 
atmospheric component of these models can respond 
realistically to observed SST anomalies There has been 
considerable research on this problem in recent years as 
part of the WCRP TOGA programme (see for example, 
Nihoul, 1985, WMO, 1986, 1988) following Rowntree's 
(1972) initial studies Figure 4 16 shows the SST anomaly 
in the Pacific for January 1983, with a maximum of 4°C in 
the eastern Pacific An example of the observed and 
simulated precipitation anomalies from mid-December 
1982 to mid-February 1983 is shown in Figure 4 17 
(Fennessy and Shukla, 1988b), where a close corr 
espondence across the central and eastern Pacific as well as 
over Indonesia and northern Australia can be seen The 
observed and simulated anomalies in the zonal departure of 
the 200mb stream function for this same period are shown 
in Figure 4 18 The strong anticyclonic couplet straddling 
the equator in the central and eastern Pacific and the 
weaker couplet to the east in the tropics are well simulated 
in the model though their magnitudes are too weak In the 
extratropics over the Pacific and North America, an 
eastward-shifted PNA-like pattern (Wallace and Gutzler, 
1981), with cyclonic anomaly over the North Pacific and 
anticyclonic anomaly over Canada, is present in both the 
observed and simulated anomaly fields 
While the results above indicate that atmospheric GCMs 
can respond realistically to EI Nino SST patterns, 
comparison of different GCMs' responses to identical SST 
anomalies underscores the importance of a realistic model 
control climate (Palmer and Mansfield, 1986) 
For 
example, the responses ol models to an identical El Nino 
SST anomaly are significantly different in those regions 
where the models control climates differ markedly In such 
experiments there are also errors in the simulated 
anomalous surface heat flux and wind stress, which would 
give rise to quite different SST if used to force an ocean 
model 
Comparative extended-range forecast experiments using 
initial data from the El Nino winter of 1982/3 with both 
observed and chmatological sea surface temperatures, 
showed that in the tropics the use of the observed SST led 
to consistent improvements in forecast skill compared with 
runs with chmatological SST, while in the extratropics the 
improvements were more variable (WMO, 1986) These 
results suggest that, in the winter-time extratropics, the 
internal low-frequency variability of the atmosphere is as 
large as the signal from tropical forcing by El Nino, while 
in the tropics the influence ol the El Nino forcing is 
dominant 
In summary, we may conclude that, given a satisfactory 
estimate of anomalous SST in the tropical Pacific, 
atmospheric GCMs can provide a realistic simulation of 
seasonal tropical atmospheric anomalies at least for intense 
El Nino episodes This success serves to increase our 
confidence in these models and in their response to surface 
forcing Problems associated with climate drift, particularly 
in relation to fluxes at the ocean-atmosphere interface.

Figure 4.19: Simulated and observed Sahel rainfall in the six 
years for which simulations have been made Simulations were 
made both with chmatological and interactive soil moisture in the 
UKMO GCM (version not shown in Table 3 2(a)) (Folland, 1990 
- personal communication) 
A number of GCM studies have indicated that local 
changes in land surface conditions have an important 
influence on rainfall For example, Charney et al (1977), 
Sud and Fennessy (1982) and Laval and Picon (1986) have 
shown that an increase in land albedo over the Sahel can 
inhibit rainfall, while Rowntree and Sangster (1986) have 
shown that restriction of soil moisture storage (as well as 
albedo increases) can also have a substantial impact on 
rainfall in the Sahel Other experiments indicate that the 
climate of the Sahel is sensitive to changes in local 
vegetation cover 
Further GCM experimentation has been described by 
Folland et al (1989), the UKMO GCM has now been run 
from observed initial conditions in March and forced with 
the observed SST for seven months of each of 1950, 1958, 
1976, 1983, 1984 and 1988 (Folland, personal comm-
unication) For each of these years, two experiments were 
performed 
one with an interactive soil moisture 
parameterization, and one with fixed chmatological soil 
moisture Figure 4 19 shows a comparison of the observed 
and simulated rainfall over the Sahel It is clear that the 
decadal time-scale trend in Sahel rainfall has been well 
captured Moreover, the results suggest that soil moisture 
feedback is not the main cause of the large modelled 
differences in rain between the wet and dry years, though it 
does contribute to the skill of the simulations Insofar as 
these decadal timescale fluctuations in large-scale SST are 
associated with internal variability of the ocean atmosphere 
system, it would appear that Sahel drought is part ot the 
natural variability of the climate, although the physical 
mechanisms whereby SST influences Sahel rain clearly 
involve remote dynamical processes (Palmer. 1986) 
In summary, atmospheric model experiments exhibit an 
ability to simulate some of the observed interannual 
variations in Sahel rainfall, given the correct SST patterns 
4.5.3 Summer Monsoon 
The monsoon, especially the Asian monsoon, displays 
significant seasonal variation and interannual variability, 
and the onset and retreat of the summer monsoons in Asia 
and Australia are associated with abrupt changes in the 
atmospheric general circulation (Yeh et al, 1959, McBnde, 
1987) An earlier or later monsoon onset, or a longer or 
shorter duration, usually causes flood or drought 
Therefore, not only the accuracy of the seasonal monsoon 
precipitation but also the accuracy of the monsoon timing 
are important aspects of a model's ability to simulate 
regional climate anomalies 
In general, most atmospheric GCMs simulate the gross 
features of summer monsoon precipitation patterns though 
there are significant deficiencies (see Section 4 3 2), 
although this aspect of model performance has not been 
extensively examined, some models have been shown to 
simulate the monsoon onset and associated abrupt changes 
(Kitoh and Tokioka, 1987, Zeng et al , 1988) Part ot the 
interannual variability of the summer monsoon has been 
found to be associated with anomalies in SST, both local 
(Kershaw, 1988) and remote For example, there is an 
apparent correlation between the strength of the Indian 
monsoon and SST in the eastern tropical Pacific, in the 
sense that a poor monsoon is generally associated with a 
warm east Pacific (Gregory, 1989) 
4.6 Simulation of Extreme Events 
The occurrence of extreme events is an important aspect of 
climate, and is in some respects more important than the 
mean climate Many relatively large-scale extreme events 
such as intense heat and cold, and prolonged wet and dry 
spells, can be diagnosed from climate model experiments 
(e g , Mearns et al , 1984) The ability of climate models to 
simulate smaller-scale extreme events is not well est-
ablished, and is examined here only in terms of tropical 
storm winds and small-scale severe storms 
Knshnamurti and Oosterhof (1989) made a five-day 
forecast of the Pacific typhoon Hope (July 1979) using a 
12-layer model, with different horizontal resolutions At a 
resolution of 75 km the model's forecast of strong winds 
was close to the observed maximum, while with a 
resolution of 400 km the maximum wind was less than half 
of the correct value and was located much too far from the 
centre of the storm Since most climate models have been 
run with a resolution of 300 km or more they do not 
adequately resolve major tropical storms and their 
associated severe winds 
It may be noted, however, that 
by using appropriate criteria, Manabe et al (1970), 
120 
Validation of Climate Models 4 
Haarsma et al (1990), and Broccoli and Manabe (1990), 
have reported that climate models can simulate some of the 
geographical structure that is characteristic of tropical 
cyclones 
Neither models with resolutions of 300 - 1000 km nor 
current numerical weather prediction models simulate 
individual thunderstorms, which are controlled by 
mesoscale dynamical processes However, they do simulate 
variables that are related to the probability and intensity of 
severe weather such as thunderstorms, hail, wind gusts and 
tornadoes 
It the appropriate variables are saved from a 
climate model, it should therefore be possible to determine 
whether the frequency and intensity of severe convective 
storms will change in an altered climate 
In summary, while changes in the occurrence of some 
types ot extreme events, such as the frequency of high 
temperatures, can be diagnosed directly from climate 
model data, special techniques are needed for inferring 
changes in the occurrence ol extreme events such as 
intense rainfall or sevcic local windstorms 
4.7 Validation from Operational Weather Forecasting 
As was recognized at the outset of numerical modelling, 
the climatological balance of a weather forecast model 
becomes ol importance after a few days of prediction, 
while an extension of the integration domain to the whole 
globe becomes necessary This means that modelling 
problems in numerical weather prediction (NWP), at least 
in the medium and extended range, have become similar to 
those in modelling the climate on timescales ol a few 
months (Bengtsson, 198*5) 
The development of numerical models over the past 
several decades has led to a considerable improvement in 
forecast skill This advance can be seen in the increased 
accuiacy ot shoit-range predictions, in the extension of the 
time uinge of useful predictive skill, and in the increase in 
the number ot uselul forecast products A systematic 
evaluation oi the quality ol short range foiecasts in the 
Northern Hemisphere has been earned out by the 
WMO/CAS Working Group on Weather Prediction 
Research covenng the 10-year period 1979 
1988 (Lange 
1989) Under this intercompanson project operational 
forecasts horn several centres have been verified on a daily 
basis, consideiable improvement has taken place, esp 
ecially in the tropics and in the Southern Hemisphere 
(Bengtsson, 1989) 
Ol paiticular importance lor climate modelling aie 
model errors ol a systematic (or case-independent) nature 
Such model deficiencies give rise to a climate drift 
in 
which the model simulations generally develop significant 
dilferences liom the real climate Although there has been 
a progressive reduction of systematic errors in NWP 
models as noted above a tendency to zonah/ation of the

flow is still present Figure 4 20 shows the evolution of 10-
day errors of the zonal wind component in the ECMWF 
model, and illustrates the global character of the model's 
errors (Arpe, 1989) The systematic errors typical of 
forecast models include the tendency for reduced 
variability in large-scale eddy activity, which shows up 
synoptically as a reduction in the frequency of blocking 
and quasi-stationary cut-off lows (see also Section 4 2 4) 
In summary, the development and sustained imp-
rovement ol atmospheric models requires long periods of 
validation using a large ensemble of different weather 
situations Confidence in a model used for climate 
simulation will therefore be increased if the same model is 
successful when used in a forecasting mode 
4.8 Simulation of Ocean Climate 
The ocean influences climate change on seasonal, decadal 
and longer timescales in seveial important ways The large-
scale transports of heat and fresh water by ocean currents 
are important climate parameters, and affect both the 
overall magnitude as well as the regional distribution of the 
response of the atmosphere-ocean system to greenhouse 
warming (Spelman and Manabe, 1985) The circulation and 
thermal structure of the upper ocean control the penetration 
of heat into the deeper ocean and hence also the timescale 
by which the ocean can delay the atmospheric response to 
CO? increases (Schlcsinger et al , 1985) Vertical motions 
and water mass formation processes in high latitudes are 
controlling factors (besides chemical and biological 
interactions) for the oceanic uptake of carbon dioxide

through the sea surface, and thus influence the radiative 
forcing in the atmosphere To be a credible tool lor the 
prediction of climate change, ocean models must therefore 
be capable of simulating the present circulation and water 
mass distribution, including their seasonal variability 
4.8.1 Status of Ocean Modelling 
The main problems in ocean modelling arise from 
uncertainties in the parameterization of unresolved 
motions, from insufficient spatial resolution, and from poor 
estimates of air-sea fluxes In general, ocean modelling is 
less advanced than atmospheric modelling, reflecting the 
greater difficulty of observing the ocean, the much smaller 
number of scientists/institutions working in this area, and 
the absence until recently of adequate computing resources 
and of an operational demand equivalent to numerical 
weather prediction Global ocean models have generally 
followed the work by Bryan and Lewis (1979), they mostly 
have horizontal resolutions of several hundred kilometres 
and about a dozen levels in the vertical Coarse grid models 
of this type have also been used in conjunction with 
atmospheric GCMs for studies of the coupled ocean-
atmosphere system (see Section 4 9) 
The performance of ocean models on decadal and longer 
timescales is critically dependent upon an accurate para-
meterization of sub-gndscale mixing The main con-
tribution to poleward heat tiansport in ocean models arises 
from vertical overturning 
whereas the contribution 
associated with the horizontal circulation is somewhat 
smaller Most models undeiestimate the heat transpoit and 
simulate western boundary currents which aie less intense 
and broader than those obseived The need for eddy-
resolving models ( e g , Semtner and Chervin, 1988) in 
climate simulations is not yet established Coarse vcitical 
resolution, on the othei hand can significantly alter the 
effective mixing and thus influence the overturning and 
heat transport in a model The main thermocline in most 
coarse-resolution simulations is consideiably wannei and 
more diffuse than observed a iesult probably due to a 
deficient representation of lateial and vertical mixing 
An important component of the deeper ocean cnculalion 
is driven by fluxes of heat and fiesh watei at the sea 
surface In the absence of leliable data on the surface fluxes 
of heat and fresh water, many ocean modellers have 
parameterized these in terms of obseived sea surface 
temperature and salinity The fluxes diagnosed in this way 
vary considerably among models While surface heat flux 
and surface temperatuic aie strongly related there is no 
correspondingly strong connection between surface fresh 
water flux and surface salinity a consequence is the 
possible existence of multiple equilibrium states with 
significant differences in oceanic heat tianspoit (Manabe 
andStouffer, 1988) 
4.8.2 Validation of Ocean Models 
The distribution of temperature, salinity and other water 
mass properties is the primary information for the 
validation of ocean models Analysed data sets (e g , 
Levitus, 1982) have been very useful although the use of 
original hydrographic data is sometimes preferred The 
distributions of transient tracers, in particular tn-
tium/helium-3 and C-14 produced by nuclear bomb tests, 
and CFCs, place certain constraints on the circulation and 
are also useful diagnostics for model evaluation (Sarmiento 
1983, Toggweiler et al , 1989) The poleward transport of 
heat in the ocean zonal hydrographic sections (c g the 
annual mean of 1 0-1 2 PW at 25N in the North Atlantic 
found by Bryden and Hall, 1980) appeals to have high 
reliability, and zonal sections planned in the World Ocean 
Circulation Experiment could significantly improve ocean 
heat transpoit estimates 
Direct observations of the fluxes of heat, fresh water and 
momentum at the sea surface are not very accurate, and 
would not appear to be viable in the near future However 
monitoring upper ocean parameters, in particular the heat 
and fresh water content in connection with ocean circ 
ulation models, can contribute to an indirect determination 
of the surface fluxes The validation of ocean models using 
large data sets can in general be made more efficient ll 
appropriate inverse modelling and/or data assimilation 
procedures are employed 
The validation of ocean models may conveniently be 
considered separately on the time-scales of a season, a 
decade and a century The goal is a model which will 
coiiectiy sequester excess heat produced by greenhouse 
warming and produce the right prediction of changing sea 
surface temperatures when it is run in coupled mode with 
an atmospheric model 
Seasonal timescales in the uppei ocean aie important for 
a simulation of greenhouse warming both because seasonal 
variations aie a fundamental component of climate and 
because ol the seasonal variation of vertical mixing in the 
ocean Sarmiento (1986) has demonstiated that the seasonal 
vanation ot mixed layer depths can be simulated with a 
sufficiently detailed repiesentation of the upper ocean 
Peihaps the best way to check ocean models on decadal 
time scales is to simulate the spread of tiansient tiaceis 
Data sets based on these tracers provide a unique pictuie ol 
the downward paths from the surface into the ocean 
thermocline and deep water The invasion of tritium into 
the western Atlantic about a decade aftei the peak of the 
bomb tests is compared with calculations by Sarmiento 
(1983) in Figure 4 21 The data show that the tutium very 
rapidly invades the main thermocline but only a small 
(taction gets into deep water The model succeeds in 
repioducing many ol the important lealurcs ol the data 
such as the shallow equatorial penetration and the deep 
penetration in high latitudes The mam failure is the lack ol

inadequacy in simulating cross-Gulf Stream/North Atlantic 
Current exchange (Bryan and Sarmiento, 1985) A notable 
result is the importance of seasonal convection for vertical 
mixing An obvious difficulty in using transient tracer data 
to estimate the penetration of excess heat from greenhouse 
warming is the feedback caused by changes in the density 
held A very small temperature perturbation should behave 
like a tracer, but as the amplitude increases, the per-
turbation will altect the circulation (Bryan and Spelman 
1985) 
In many parts ot the ocean, salinity is an excellent tracer 
ot ocean circulation The salinity field of the ocean is 
cxticmely difficult to simulate The reason for this is that 
souices and sinks ot tresh water at the ocean surface have a 
rather complex distribution, much more so than the 
transient tracers Water masses with distinctive salinity 
signatures lie at the base ot the thermocline in all the major 
oceans In the Southern Ocean and the Pacific, these water 
masses are characterized by salinity minima and relatively 
weak stability The characteristic renewal timescale of 
these water masses is greater than a decade but less than a 
century a range very important for greenhouse warming 
At piescnt, these water masses have not been simulated in a 
satislactory way in an ocean circulation model 
In summary, oceanic processes are expected to play a 
ma|oi role in climate change The satislactory rep 
icscntation ot vcitical and horizontal transport processes 
(and ot sea-ice) are thus ot particular importance There is 
encouraging evidence from tracer studies that at least some 
aspects ot these mixing processes are captuicd by ocean 
models However, at present, ocean models tend to 
underestimate heat transport 
4.9 Validation of Coupled Models 
While much has been learned from models of the 
atmosphere and ocean formulated as separate systems, a 
more fundamental approach is to treat the ocean and 
atmosphere together as a coupled system This is unlikely 
to improve on the simulation of the time-meaned 
atmosphere and ocean when treated as separate entities 
(with realistic surface fluxes), since the average SST can 
only become less realistic, however, it is the only way in 
which some of the climate system's long-term interactions, 
including the tiansient response to progressively increasing 
CCb, can be realistically studied (see Section 6) 
Typical of the current generation of coarse-grid coupled 
GCMs is the simulation shown in Figure 4 22 from 
Washington and Meehl (1989) The general pattern of 
zonal mean temperature is reproduced in both atmosphere 
and ocean in this freely interacting coupled model, 
although during the time period simulated the temperature 
in the deeper ocean is still strongly related to the initial 
conditions On closer inspection, comparison of the 
simulated near-surface temperatures in the ocean with 
observed values from Levitus (1982) shows warmer-than-
observed temperatures in the high latitude southern oceans, 
colder-than-observed temperatures in the tropics, and 
colder-than-observed temperatures at high northern 
latitudes The latter can be traced to the North Atlantic 
where the lack ot a well-defined Gulf Stream and 
associated thermohahne circulation inhibits the transport of

(computed) 
heat to those latitudes Similar patterns of systematic sea-
surface temperature errors have been found in other 
coupled models (Gates et al , 198"5, Manabe and Stouffer 
1988), and their effects on the simulated surface heat flux 
have been examined by Meehl (1989) 
In view of such errors, a practical decision faces those 
designing coupled models On the one hand they can 
decide that the systematic errors, while serious in teims of 
the control integration 
do not prevent the useful 
interpretation of results from sensitivity experiments On 
the other hand, they may considci that the systematic eirors 
represent a significant bias in the control run and would 
affect the results ol sensitivity experiments to an 
unacceptable degree The alternative then is to somehow 
adjust for the errors in the control run to piovide a more 
realistic basic state for sensitivity experiments Such 
techniques have been devised and aie variously called flux 
correction" (Sausen et al 
1988) or tlux adjustment 
(Manabe and Stouffer, 1988) These methods eflectivcly 
remove a large part ot the systematic enors and such 
coupled simulations arc closci to observed conditions 
However, since the correction teims are additive the 
coupled model can still exhibit dnft and the flu\ collection 
terms cannot change during the course of a climate change 
experiment (I e , it is effectively assumed that the model 
errors are the same for both the control and perturbed 
climates) 
One way to validate coupled models is to analyse the 
simulated interannual variability, a fundamental source of 
which is associated with the El Nino - Southern Oscillation 
(ENSO) (see also Section 4^1) The current generation of 
coarse-grid coupled models has been shown to be capable 
of simulating some aspects ot the ENSO phenomenon 
(Sperberetal 
1987 Meehl 1990 Philander et al 1989) 
although the simulated intensity is in general too weak 
Ultimately a coupled climate model should be vended by 
its simulation of the observed evolution ol the atmosphere 
and ocean over historical times For hypothetical tuture 
iates of CO2 increase current coupled GCMs at least 
indicate that the patterns of the climate s transient response 
are likely to be substantially different in at least some 
ocean regions from those given in equilibrium simulations 
without a fully inteiacting ocean (Washington and Meehl 
1989 Stouffer et al , 1989 see also Section 6) 
In summaiy coupled models of the ocean atmosphere 
system aie still in an early stage of development and have 
124 
Validation of Climate Models 4 
so lar used relatively coarse resolution Nevertheless, the 
large scale structures of the ocean and atmosphere can be 
simulated with some skill using such models and current 
simulations give results that are generally similar to those 
of equilibrium models (see Sections 5 and 6) 
4.10 Validation from Palaeo-Climate 
Studies of palaeo-climatic changes are an important 
element in climate model validation for two reasons 
1) 
they improve our physical understanding of the 
causes and mechanisms of large climatic changes so 
that we can improve the representation of the 
appropriate processes in models, and 
2) 
they provide unique data sets tor model validation 
4.10.1 Observational Studies of the Holocene 
The changes of the Earth's climate during the Holocene 
and since the last glacial maximum (the last 18,000 years) 
are the largest and best documented in the palaeo climatic 
record, and are therefore well-suited for model validation, 
the data sets aic ncai-global in distnbution, the time control 
(based upon radiocarbon dating) is good, and estimates of 
palaeo-climatic conditions can be obtained from a variety 
ot palaeo-environmental records, such as lake sediment 
cores, ocean sediment cores, ice cores, and soil cores At 
the last glacial maximum there were large ice sheets in 
North Amenca and northern Eurasia, sea-level was about 
100m below present, the atmospheric CCb concentration 
was around 200ppm, sea-ice was more extensive than at 
present, and the patterns ot vegetation and lake distribution 
were diflerent from now During the last 18,000 years, we 
therefore have the opportunity to observe how the climate 
system evolved during the major change from glacial to 
piesent (inteiglacial) conditions 
CLIMAP Project 
Members (1976 1981) and COHMAP Members (1988) 
have assembled a comprehensive data set for the climate of 
the last 18,000 years as summaii7ed in Figure 4 23 
The period from 5 5-6kbp (thousand years before 
present) is probably the earliest date in the Holocene when 
the boundary conditions of ice-sheet extent and sea level 
were analogous to the present There is also general 
agreement that vegetation was close to equilibrium with the 
climate at this time Radiocarbon dating ot most ot the 
sources of stratigraphic data allows an accuracy of better 
than plus-or-minus 1000 years in the selection of data tor 
the purposes of making reconstructions The earlier period 
around 9kbp is of particular inteiest because the differences 
ol the radiative forcing fiom the present were particularly 
large (Berger, 1979), although there was still a substantial 
North Amencan ice sheet 
410.2 Model Studies of Holocene Climate 
Several atmospheric GCMs have been used to simulate the 
climate ot the 18kbp glacial maximum, and have helped to 
clarify the relative roles of continental ice sheets, sea-ice, 
ocean temperature and land albedo in producing major 
shifts in circulation, temperature and precipitation patterns 
(Gates, 1976a, b, Manabe and Hahn, 1977, Kutzbach and 
Guetter, 1986, Rind 1987) In addition to specifying land-
based ice sheets and changed land albedos, these models 
also prescribed SSTs and sea-ice extents Manabe and 
Broccoli (1985) successfully simulated the SSTs and sea-
ice during the Last Glacial Maximum using an atmospheric 
GCM coupled to a mixed-layer ocean model, this

experiment also demonstrated the sensitivity ot glacial age 
climate simulations to the lowered level of glacial-age 
atmospheric CC>2 (Broccoli and Manabe. 1987) The 
climate's sensitivity to oibital parameter changes has been 
confirmed through companions of model simulations with 
palaeo-chmatic data both using atmospheric GCMs 
(Kutzbach and Guettei, 1986. Royer et al 1984) and using 
atmospheric GCMs coupled to mixed layer ocean models 
(Kutzbach and Gallimoie 1988, Mitchell et al , 1988) 
Manabe and Stouffei (1988), moicover, ieport evidence ol 
two stable equilibria of a coupled atmosphere-ocean GCM 
that may be of impoitance lor explaining abiupt short-teim 
climate changes such as the cooling which occuned about 
10,500 years ago Rind et al (1986) Oveipecketal (1989) 
and Oglesby et al (1989) have sought undeistanding ot this 
cooling from model expenments in which cooling of the 
North Atlantic or the Gull ot Mexico was specified 
In general, palaeo-chmate modelling studies have 
found encouraging agieemcnt between simulations 
and observations on continental scales Foi example, the 
COHMAP comparisons using the NCAR model show 
temperature and precipitation changes, I8kbp to piesent, 
that are generally consistent with obsei\alions in North 
America, at least as interpieted b> the movement ol spruce 
populations (Figure 4 24), while the simulated enh 
ancement of northern tiopical monsoons around 9kbp is 
also supported by palaeo-chmatic data (COHMAP 
Membeis, 1988) On the othei hand, palaeo-chmate 
modelling studies, like their modern counterparts, also 
reveal regions and times where model and data disagree 
For example, Figure 4 24 shows errors over southeastern 
North America from 18 to 12kbp associated with simulated 
summer temperatures that are too high, while Manabe and 
Broccoli (198i) obtain laiger cooling of the tropical oceans 
at 18kbp than palaeo-chmatic data suggest 
Because the mid-Holocene may have been wanner than 
now at least dunng northern summei, the question anses 
whethei or not this period might be in some sense 
analogous to the climate with doubled CO2 Gallunore and 
Kutzbach (1989) and Mitchell (1990) have discussed the 
ditfeienccs in forcing (orbital parameteis versus CO2) and 
dilteiences in the climatic response as simulated by GCMs 
Even though the two types of forcing aie vciy different, we 
can lcain a gieat deal about oui models by deteimining 
how well model expenments with orbitally-caused changes 
in solai iadiation simulate the observed extent ol increase 
in noithcrn mid continent summer warmth and dryness the 
decrease in Arctic sea-ice, and the increase in northern 
tropical precipitation 
4.10.3 Other Validation Opportunities

(1987) 
among otheis 
show evidence lor wanner

126 
Validation of Climate Models 4 
time CO2 levels were above pre-industnal levels, sea-level 
was somewhat higher than now, the Greenland ice sheet 
was perhaps smaller, and orbital parameters favoured 
greatly enhanced Northern Hemisphere seasonality 
Because of the indications of warmth and relatively high 
CO2 levels (relative to before and after 125 kbp) this 
penod is also of interest for modelling and model 
validation studies Modelling experiments by Royer et al 
(1984) have emphasised the strong cooling from the 
equilibrium climate with orbital parameters for 125kbp to 
that for 115kbp However, data sets are not nearly as 
extensive or as well-dated as for the mid-Holocene 
There is strong evidence that the first growth of ice 
sheets and the development of glacial/interglacial cycles 
began in North America and northern Eurasia around 2 4 
million years ago, prior to this time the climate was 
presumably significantly warmer than at present This 
period may well be our only geologically-recent example 
of a climate that was significantly warmer than now over 
large areas However, the period poses many problems, 
including the marked differences from the present day in 
major global topographic features and the uncertainties in 
forcing conditions, these factors make it unsuitable for 
detailed model validation at the present time, although such 
simulations would be of considerable scientific interest 
In summary, palaeo-chmatic data have provided 
encouraging evidence of the ability of climate models to 
simulate climates different from the present, especially 
during the Holocene This indicates that further such data 
would be useful for climate model validation 
4.11 Conclusions and Recommendations 
This somewhat selective review of the performance of 
current global climate models has shown that there is 
considerable skill in the simulation of the present day 
climate by atmospheric general circulation models in the 
portrayal ol the large-scale distribution of the pressure, 
temperature, wind and precipitation in both summer and 
winter As discussed in Section 4 1 2 the responses to 
pciturbations can be given credence, provided simulated 
and observed patterns are sufficiently similar for 
conesponding features and mechanisms to be identified 
Recent models appear to satisfy this condition over most of 
the globe Although quantification of this conclusion is 
difficult 
it is supported by the skill demonstrated by 
atmospheric models in simulating, firstly, the circulation 
and idinfall chdnges associated with the El Nino ocean 
temperature anomalies and, secondly, the rainfall 
anomalies characteristic of wet and dry periods in the Sahel 
region of Africa when the observed sea surface temperature 
anomalies are used 
On tegional scales there are significant errors in these 
variables in all models Validation for selected regions 
shows mean surface air temperature errors of 2 to 3°C, 
compared with an average seasonal variation of 15°C The 
large-scale distribution of precipitation can be realistically 
simulated apart lrom some errors on sub-continental scales 
(1000 2000 km) whose locations differ between models 
Validation on these scales for selected regions shows mean 
errors oi from 20% to 50% of the average rainfall 
depending on the model 
The limited data available show that the simulated 
summer and winter soil moisture distributions in middle 
latitudes qualitatively reflect most of the large-scale 
characteristics of observed soil wetness Snow cover can be 
well simulated in winter except in regions where the 
temperature is poorly simulated The radiative fluxes at the 
top of the atmosphere, important for the response of 
climate to radiative perturbations, are simulated with 
average errors in the zonal mean as small as 5 Wm~2 
There are, however, substantial discrepancies in albedo, 
particularly in middle and high latitudes 
There has been a general reduction in the errors in more 
recent models as a result of increased resolution, changes in 
the parameterization of convection, cloudiness and surface 
processes, and the introduction of parametenzations of 
gravity wave drag In addition to the conclusions drawn 
from the validation of atmospheric model control 
simulations, our overall confidence in the models is 
increased by their relatively high level of accuracy when 
used for short and medium-range weather prediction, by 
their portrayal of low-frequency atmospheric variability 
such as the atmospheric response to realistic sea surface 
temperature anomalies (also referred to above), and by 
their ability to simulate aspects of the climate at selected 
times during the last 18,000 years Further confidence in 
atmospheric models would be obtained by their successful 
simulation of the climate changes shown by the observed 
instrumental record 
Other opportunities for validation not considered in 
detail here include the simulation of variations in 
stratospheric temperature and circulation Models have 
been successful in simulating the impact on temperatures of 
the Antarctic ozone hole (Kiehl et al, 1988, Canolle et al, 
1990), although they have not successfully simulated the 
quasi-biennial oscillation in stratospheric wind and 
temperature 
The latest atmospheric models, while by no means 
perfect, are thus sufficiently close to reality to inspire some 
confidence in their ability to predict the broad features of a 
doubled CO2 climate at equilibrium, provided the changes 
in sea-surface temperature and sea-ice are correct The 
models used in simulating the equilibrium responses to 
increased greenhouse gases employ simple mixed-layer 
ocean models, in which adjustments to the surface fluxes

experiments Our confidence in the ability of these models 
to simulate changes in the climate, including ocean 
temperatures and sea-ice, is enhanced by their successful 
simulation of aspects of the climates during and since the 
most recent ice age 
Despite the present computational constraints on 
resolution, the performance of ocean models lends 
credence to our ability to simulate many of the observed 
large-scale features of ocean climate, especially in lower 
latitudes However, coupled ocean-atmosphere models 
exhibit characteristic errors which as yet can only be 
removed by empirical adjustments to the ocean surface 
fluxes This is due in part to the use of atmospheric and 
oceanic models of relatively low resolution, and in part to 
inadequate parametenzations of fluxes at the air-sea 
interface Nevertheless, the latest long runs with such 
models, discussed in Section 6, exhibit variability on 
decadal timescales which is similar to that observed 
(compare Figure 6 2 and Figure 7 10) 
There is a clear need for further improvement of the 
accuracy of climate models through both increased 
resolution and improved parameterization of small-scale 
processes, especially the treatment of convection, clouds 
and surface effects in atmospheric GCMs, and mixing and 
sea-ice behaviour in oceanic GCMs 
Much further 
experience needs to be gained in the design of coupled 
models in order to avoid the equally unsatisfactory choices 
of accepting a progressive climatic drift or of empirically 
correcting the behaviour of the upper ocean These 
improvements and the associated extended simulations will 
require substantial amounts of computer time, along with 
increased coordination and cooperation among the world's 
climate modelling community 
Data from satellite 
programmes, such as EOS, and from field experiments are 
needed to provide more complete data sets for specifying 
land surface characteristics, for initialisation and validation 
ot ocean simulations and to improve parametenzations Of 
particular value should be ERBE ISCCP and FIRE data tor 
radiation and cloud, the ISLSCP and the HAPEX for land 
surface processes, the GEWEX for energy and water 
balances, and WOCE and TOGA data for the oceans 
The validation of a number of atmospheric model 
variables has been handicapped by limitations in the 
available observed and model data In particular, future 
model assessments would benefit from improved estimates 
of precipitation and evaporation over the oceans, and of 
evaporation, soil moisture and snow depth over land, and 
by more uniform practices in the retention of model data 
such as snow-cover frequency and depth, and daily near-
surface temperature extremes or means The genciation of 
data suitable for validating cloud simulations deserves 
continuing attention, as does the assembly ol palaeo-
climatic data sets appropriate for climate model validation 
over the Earth's recent geological history The lack ol 
appropriate data has also severely hindered the validation 
ol ocean models 
Adequate data on the seasonal 
distribution of ocean currents and their variability and on 
salinity and sea-ice thickness are especially needed 
Although the ten year atmospheric data set lor 1963-73 
compiled by Oort (1983) and the oceanographic set 
assembled by Levitus (1982) have been of great value in 
model assessment, the subsequent availability of 4 
dimensional assimilation techniques and the expansion of 
observing platforms provide the opportunity 
for 
considerably improved data sets Indeed, many data sets 
now used by modellers for validation have been produced 
by global forecasting centres as a by-product of their 
operational data assimilation, although changes in forecast 
and assimilation techniques have led to temporal 
discontinuities in the data The proposal by Bengtsson and 
Shukla (1988) for a re analysis of observations over a 
recent decade (e g , 1979-1988) with a lrozen up-to-date 
assimilation system is therefore of great potential value for 
climate model validation If carried out over additional 
decades, such a data set could also contribute to our 
understanding of how to distinguish between natural 
climate fluctuations and changes caused by increased 
greenhouse gases

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
1. All models show substantial changes in climate when CO2 
concentrations are doubled, even though the changes vary from 
model to model on a sub-continental scale. 
2. The main equilibrium changes in climate due to doubling CO2 
deduced from models are given below. The number of *'s 
indicates the degree ot confidence determined subjectively from 
the amount of agreement between models, our understanding of 
the model results and our confidence in the representation of the 
relevant process in the model. Five *'s indicate virtual certainties, 
one * indicates low confidence. 
Temperature: 
***** the lower atmosphere and Earth's surface warm, 
***** the stratosphere cools; 
*** 
near the Earth's surface, the global average wanning lies 
between +1.5°C and +4.5°C, with a "best guess" of 2.5°C, 
*** 
the surface warming at high latitudes is greater than the 
global average in winter but smaller than in summer (In 
time dependent simulations with a deep ocean, there is 
little warming over the high latitude southern ocean); 
*** 
the surface warming and its seasonal variation aie least in 
the tropics. 
Precipitation: 
**** 
the global average increases (as does that of evaporation), 
the larger the warming, the larger the increase; 
*** 
increases at high latitudes throughout the year; 
*** 
increases globally by 3 to 15% (as does evaporation), 
** 
increases at mid-latitudes in winter; 
** 
the zonal mean value increases in the tropics although 
there are areas of decrease. Shifts in the main tropical rain 
bands differ from model to model, so there is little 
consistency between models in simulated regional 
changes; 
** 
changes little in subtropical and areas. 
Soil moisture: 
** 
increases in high latitudes in winter; 
decreases over northern mid-latitude continents in 
summer. 
Snow and sea-ice: 
**** 
the area of sea-ice and seasonal snow-cover diminish. 
The results from models become less reliable at smaller scales, 
so predictions for smaller than continental regions should be 
treated with great caution. The continents warm more than the 
ocean Temperature increases in southern Europe and central 
North America are greater than the global mean and are 
accompanied by reduced precipitation and soil moisture in 
summer The Asian summer monsoon intensities 
3. Changes in the day-to-day variability of weather are uncertain 
However, episodes of high temperature will become more 
frequent in the future simply due to an increase in the mean 
temperature. There is some evidence of a general increase in 
convective precipitation 
4. The direct effect of deforestation on global mean climate is 
small. The indirect effects (through changes in the CO2 sink) 
may be more important. However, tropical deforestation may lead 
to substantial local effects, including a reduction of about 20% in 
precipitation. 
5. Improved predictions of global climate change require better 
treatment of processes affecting the distribution and properties of 
cloud, ocean-atmosphere interaction, convection, sea-ice and 
transfer of heat and moisture from the land surface Increased 
model resolution will allow more realistic predictions of global-
scale changes, and some improvement in the prediction of 
regional climate change.

5.1 Introduction 
5.1.1 Why Carry Out Equilibrium Studies ? 
Climate is in equilibrium when it is in balance with the 
radiative forcing (Section 3 2) Thus, as long as greenhouse 
gas concentrations continue to increase, climate will not 
reach equilibrium Even if concentrations are eventually 
stabilised at constant levels and maintained there, it would 
be many decades before full equilibrium is reached Thus 
equilibrium simulations cannot be used directly as 
forecasts Why carry out equilibrium studies9 
First, approximate equilibrium simulations using atmos-
phere-oceanic mixed layer models which ignore both the 
deep ocean and changes in ocean circulation (Section 3, 
Section 6 4 4 1) require less computer time than time-
dependent simulations which must include the influence of 
the deep ocean to be credible 
Second, equilibrium experiments are easier to compare 
than time-dependent experiments This, combined with the 
fact that they are relatively inexpensive to carry out, makes 
equilibrium simulations ideal for sensitivity studies in 
which the effect of using alternative parametenzations (for 
example, of cloud) can be assessed 
Third, it appears that apart from areas where the oceanic 
thermal inertia is large, as in the North Atlantic and in high 
southern latitudes, equilibrium solutions can be scaled and 
used as approximations to the time-dependent response 
(see Section 6) 
Most equilibrium experiments consider the effect of 
doubling the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide 
since the effect of increases in other trace gases can be 
calculated in terms of an effective CC>2 increase (see 
Section 2) Note that only the radiative effects of increases 
in gases are taken into account, and not the effects of 
related factors such as deforestation and possible changes 
in cloud albedo due to sulphur emissions 
Simulated changes in climate are known to be dependent 
on the simulation ol the undisturbed climate ' (see, for 
example, Mitchell et al 
1987) The simulation of present 
day climate is discussed in more detail in Section 4 
5.1.2 What Are The Limitations Of Equilibrium Climate 
Studies ? 
Firstly, most equilibrium studies use models which exclude 
possible changes in ocean circulation Nearly all the 
equilibrium studies which do allow changes in ocean 
circulation have been simplified in other ways such as 
ignoring the seasonal cycle of insolation (Manabe et al , 
1990), or using idealised geography (Manabe and Bryan, 
1985) The effects of the ocean and the differences between 
' Foi example if the snow line is misplaced in the 
simulation of pi esent climate then the lai^c wauninv, 
assoc tated with the i eti eat of the snow line w /// he 
misplaced in the simulated c lunate c hanqc 
non-equilibrium and equilibrium climate simulations are 
discussed further in Section 6 
Secondly, different areas of the world respond at 
different rates to the gradual increase in greenhouse gases 
Over most of the ocean, the response to the increase in 
radiative heating will be relatively rapid, as little of the 
extra heat will penetrate below the thermochne at about 
500m (see Section 6) On the other hand, in parts of the 
northern North Atlantic and the high latitude southern 
ocean, particularly in winter, the extra heat will be mixed 
down to several kilometres, significantly reducing the rate 
of warming and consequently the warming reached at any 
given time In other words, the geographical patterns of the 
equilibrium warming may differ from patterns of the time-
dependent warming as it evolves in time This applies both 
to model simulations and palaeo-chmatic analogues 
5.7 3 How Have The Equilibrium 
Experiments 
Been 
Assessed 9 
Over 20 simulations of the equilibrium response to 
doubling CO2 using general circulation models (GCMs) 
coupled to mixed-layer oceans have been carried out by 9 
modelling groups (Table 3 2a) All those cited involved 
global models with realistic geography, a mixed layer 
ocean and a seasonal cycle of insolation The more recent 
studies include a prescribed seasonally-varying oceanic 
heating (Section 3) Models 13 20 and 21 in Table 3 2a 
also prescribe a heat convergence under sea ice Clearly it 
is not possible here to show results from all 20 or so 
experiments, so some way of condensing the available data 
must be chosen We have chosen not to average the results 
as there are aspects ol each model which are misleading 
Nor is it reasonable to choose a best model as a par-
ticular model may be more reliable than another for one 
climatic parameter but not for another Moreover a result 
which is common to most models is not necessaiily the 
most reliable - it may merely reflect the fact thai many 
models use similar (possibly erroneous) representations of 
complex atmospheric processes 
In this section, the climate changes which are common to 
all models and which are physically plausible 
are 
emphasised and illustrated by typical results Where there 
is disagreement among model results those which are 
probably unreliable (for example because of large errors in 
the simulation of present climate) have been eliminated 
and examples illustrating the range of uncertainty 
are 
included The reasons for the discrepancies (if known) are 
stated and an assessment of what seems most likely to be 
the correct result in the light of current 
knowledge 
including evidence from time-dependent simulations 
(Section 6), is given 
The contents of the remainder of this section are as

mechanisms producing them The possible changes in 
climatic variability are then discussed Next, we consider 
simulated seasonal mean changes from three different 
models in five selected regions These results have been 
scaled to give a best estimate of the warming which 
would occur at 2030 (at about the time of effective

5.2 Kquilibrium Changes in Climatic Means Due to 
Doubling C 0 2 
5.2.1 The Global Mean Equilibrium Response 
All models show a significant equilibrium increase in 
global average surface temperature due to a doubling of 
C02 which ranges horn 1 9 to 5 2°C (Table 3 2a) Most 
icsults he between 3 5 and 4 VC, although this does not 
necessanly imply that the correct value lies in this range 
The main uncertainty arises horn the problems ol sim-
ulating cloud With no changes in cloud a wanning of 2 to 
3 C is obtained (Table 3 2a, entries 1 and 2 
see also 
Hansen et al 1984 Schlesinger 1985) wheieas models in 
which cloud amount is calculated mteiactively from 
iclative humidity but in which radiative properties are 
fixed give a warming of 4 to 5°C (Table 3 2a entiies 3 to 
16 21) 
Even amongst those models which calculate cloud from 
iclative humidity there is a wide variation in sensitivity 
(Table 3 2a entiies 3 to 16 20 22) and cloud feedback 
(Cess ct al 
1989 - Table 3 2a entiies 3 and 4 see also 
Section 3 4 4) Sensitivity also vanes toi many other 
icasons including the extent ol sea ice in the control 
climate (Table 3 2a, entries 11 and 12 Manabe and 
Stouftei 1980, Ingram et al, 1989) 
Specifying cloud from relative humidity with fixed 
iadiative properties ignores the possible ellects of changes 
in cloud microphysics, such as changes in total cloud watei 
content the partition between cloud ice and cloud water, 
and changes in the effective radius of cloud paitides 
Because ol this attempts have been made to model cloud 
watei content e\plicitl> (Roeckner et al 
1987 Smith 
1990) Climate warming may produce an inciease in cloud 
watei content and hence in the ietlcctivity ol cloud (a

negative feedback), but also an increase in the long-wave 
emissivity of cloud (increasing the greenhouse effect, a 
positive feedback especially for thin high cloud) Models 
disagree about the net eflect which depends crucially on 
the radiative properties at solar and infrared wavelengths 
One general circulation experiment (Mitchell et al 1989 -
Table 3 2a entiies 18 and 19) and experiments with simple 
one-dimensional iadiative convective models (Somerville 
and Remer 1984 Somerville and Iacobelhs, 1988), suggest 
a negative feedback A further possible negative feedback 
due to increases in the proportion of water cloud at the 
expense ol ice cloud has been identified (Table 3 2a, 
entries 16 17 Mitchell et al , 1989) 
On the basis ol evidence from the more recent modelling 
studies (Table 3 2a entries 3 4, 7-9, 17-22) it appears that 
the equilibrium change in globally averaged surface 
temperatuie due to doubling CO2 is between 1 9 and 4 4°C 
The model icsults to not piovide any compelling reason to 
alter the previously accepted range 1 5 to 4 5°C (U S 
National Academy ol Sciences, 1979, Bolin et al, 1986) 
The clustenng ol estimates around 4°C (Table 3 2a, Figure 
5 1) may be laigely due to the neglect of changes in cloud 
microphysics in the models concerned In the 2xC02 
simulations in which some aspects of cloud microphysics 
are parameten/ed (Table 3 2a, entries 17 20, 22), the 
warming is less than 4°C However, in idealised sim 
ulations (Cess ct al 1990) changes in cloud microphysics 
pioduced positive feedbacks in some models and negative 
feedbacks in otheis Thus we cannot reduce the upper limit 
5 Equilibi ium Climate Change 
H9 
of the range The modelling studies do not on their own 
provide a basis for choosing a most likely value 
Dickinson (in Bolin et al , 1986) attempted to quantify 
the uncertainty in the sensitivity of global mean temp-
erature ATs to doubling CO2 by considering the 
uncertainties in individual leedback processes as 
determined from climate model experiments The climate 
sensitivity parameter A (the reciprocal of that defined in 
Section 3 3 1) is the sum of the individual feedback 
strengths, and the range of ATs is deduced from the range 
of A through 
ATs = AQ/A 
where AQ is the change in radiative heating due to 
doubling CO2 (See Section 3 3 1) Repeating this analysis 
with revised estimates2 gives a range of 1 7 to 4 1°C The 
mid-range value of A gives a sensitivity oi 2 4°C which is 
less than the mid-range value of ATs This is because for 
high sensitivity (small A), a given increment in A gives a 
bigger change in ATs than for low sensitivity Similarly, 
taking the value of A corresponding to the middle of the 
range of A implied by 1 5 to 4 5°C gives a value of 2 3°C 
for ATs 
One can attempt to constrain the iange of model 
sensitivities by comparing predictions of the expected 
warming to date with obseivations This approach is 
fraught with uncertainty Global mean temperatures are 
subject to considerable natuial fluctuations (Section 7) and 
may have been influenced by external factors other than the 
greenhouse effect 
In paiticular the effect of aerosols on 
cloud (Section 2 3 3) may have suppiessed the expected 
wanning There is also some unceitainty concerning the 
extent to which the thermal inertia of the oceans slows the 
rate ot warming (Section 6) Hence obseivations alone 
cannot be used to reduce the range of unceitainty though 
assuming that lactors other than the gieenhouse effect 
remain unchanged, they are more consistent with a value in 
the lower end of the iange 1 5 to 4 5°C (Section 8 1 3) 
The evidence from the modelling studies from obs 
eivations and the sensitivity analyses indicate that the 
sensitivity of global mean suiface iempeiatuie to doubling 
COT IS unlikely to lie outside the iange 1 5 to 4 5°C There 
is no compelling evidence to suggest in what part of this 
range the correct value is most likely to lie There is no 
particular virtue in choosing the middle of the iange, and 
both the sensitivity analysis and the observational evidence

Most scientists declined to give a single number 
but for the purpose of illustrating the IPCC Scenarios, a 
value of 2 5°C is considered to be the best guess in the 
light of current knowledge. 
The simulated global warming due to a doubling of CO2 
is accompanied by increases in global mean evaporation 
and precipitation, ranging from 3 to 15% (Table 3 2a, 
Figure 5 1) In general, the greater the warming, the greater 
the enhancement ot the hydrological cycle Since evap-
oration increases as well as precipitation 
incieased 
precipitation does not necessarily imply a wetter land 
surface 
5.2.2 What Are The Large-Scale Changes On Which The 
Models Agree ? 
Although globally averaged changes give an indication ot 
the likely magnitude of changes in climate due to increases 
in greenhouse gases, the geographical and seasonal 
distribution of the changes are needed to estimate the 
economic and social impacts of climate change Despite the 
large range of estimates for the global annual average 
warming there are several large-scale fcatuies of the 
simulated changes which are common to all models These 
aie outlined below Where appropriate iesults from the 
high resolution models (Table 3 2a, entnes 20 22) are 
quoted to give the leader a rough indication of the size of 
the changes 
S 2 2 1 Tempei a tin e changes 
The results from equilibrium simulations shown here are 
aveiaged over periods of 5 to 15 years Because there is 
considerable inteiannual variability in simulated suiface 
temperatuies particularly in high latitudes in winter some 
of the smallci-scale features may be random fluctuations

The warming of the surface and troposphere are due to an 
enhancement of the natural greenhouse effect 
The 
stratosphenc cooling is due to enhanced radiative cooling 
to space and increases with height, reaching 3 to 6°C at 
about 25 mb Note that the models considered have at most 
two levels in the tropical stratosphere and so cannot resolve 
the details of the stratospheric cooling Models with high 
iesolution produce a cooling of up to 1 1°C in the 
stratosphere on doubling CCH (Fels et al 
1980) The 
indirect effects of stratospheric cooling are discussed in 
Section 2 2 3 Note that other greenhouse gases (lor

differences in the sea-ice extents and snow cover in the 
simulation of present climate. 
3. The warming is smaller than the global mean over sea-
ice in the Arctic in summer (Figure 5.4 d, e,f) and around 
Antarctica in the corresponding season (Figure 5.4 a, c): 
In summer the temperature of the surface of permanent sea-
ice reaches melting point in both lxC02 (present day) and 
2xC02 simulations (Figure 5.3). Even in models where 
sea-ice disappears in summer in the 2xC02 simulation, the 
large heat capacity of the oceanic mixed layer inhibits 
further warming above 0°C during the few months when it 
is ice free. Thus, the winter and annual average warmings 
are largest in high latitudes, but the summer warming is 
smaller than the annual average warming. 
4. In all models, the tropical warming is both smaller than 
the global mean and varies little with season being 
typically 2 to 3°C (for example. Figures 5.3. 5.4): 
The saturation vapour pressure of water increases non-
linearly with temperature, so that at higher temperature, 
proportionally more of the increase in radiative heating of 
the surface is used to increase evaporation rather than to 
raise surface temperature. As a result, the surface warming 
is reduced relative to the global mean because of enhanced 
evaporative cooling. The enhanced evaporation is ass-
ociated with increased tropical precipitation (see Section 
5.2.2.2). Thus the warming of the upper troposphere in the 
tropics is greater than the global mean due to increased 
latent-heat release (Figure 5.2). Note that the magnitude of 
the warming in the tropics in those models with a similar 
global mean warming varies by a factor of almost 2 (Figure 
5.2). The reasons for this arc probably differences in the 
treatment of convection (Schlesinger and Mitchell, 1987; 
Cunnington and Mitchell, 1990) (the vertical transfer of 
heat and moisture on scales smaller than the model grid), in 
the choice of cloud radiative parameters (Cess and 
Potter, 1988) and the distribution of model layers in the 
vertical (Wetherald and Manabe, 1988). Some of these 
factors have been discussed further in Section 3. 
5. //; most models, the warming over northern mid-latitude 
continents in summer is greater than the global mean (for 
example, Figure 5.4 d, e, f): 
Where the land surface becomes sufficiently dry to restrict 
evaporation, further drying reduces evaporation and hence 
evaporative cooling, leading to further warming of the 
surface (Figure 5.5). The reduction in evaporation may also 
produce a reduction in low cloud (for example, Manabe 
and Wetherald, 1987), further enhancing the surface 
warming (Figure 5.5). In one model, (Washington and 
Meehl, 1984; Meehl and Washington, 1989) the land 
surface becomes generally wetter in these latitudes in 
summer, reducing the warming. This is probably due to the

land surface being excessively dry in the control simulation 
(see Section 5.2.2.3). 
The summer warming in the more recent simulations 
(Table 3.2a, entries 20-22) is typically 4 to 5°C over the St. 
Lawrence-Great Lakes region and 5 to 6°C over central 
Asia (for example. Figure 5.4 d, e, f). Many of the inter-
model differences in the simulated warming over the 
summer continents can be attributed to differences in the 
simulated changes in soil moisture and cloud. 
5.2.2.2 Precipitation changes 
1. All models produce enhanced precipitation in high 
latitudes and the tropics throughout the year, and in mid-
latitudes in winter (see for example. Figure 5.6 ): 
All models simulate a substantially moister atmosphere 
(increased specific humidity). Precipitation occurs in 
regions of lower level convergence, including the mid-
latitude storm tracks and the inter-tropical convergence 
zone (ITCZ), where moist inflowing air is forced to ascend, 
cool and precipitate to remove the resulting super-
saturation. The increases in atmospheric moisture will lead 
to a greater flux of moisture into these regions and hence 
increased precipitation provided there are no large 
compensational changes in circulation. The high resolution 
models (Table 3.2a, entries 20-22) give an increase of 10 to 
20% in precipitation averaged over land between 35 and 
55°N.

Figure 5.9: Changes in area means due to doubling CO2 
averaged over land between 35 to 55°N. (a) Water budget (mm 
day"1) (b) Heat budget (WITT2) (c) Soil moisture (lxCC>2 and 
2xC02) (from the study by Manabe and Wetherald, 1987). 
Since drying of the northern mid-latitude continents in 
summer could have significant impacts, these changes 
warrant a close examination of the physical processes 
responsible, and the fidelity of their ;epresentation in 
models needs to be considered carefully. Hence the water 
and energy budgets in this region have been analysed in 
some detail. In the control simulation, all models produce 
a maximum in soil moisture in winter and spring, and a 
rapid drying to a minimum in summer (Figure 5.9c). With 
doubled CO2, enhanced winter precipitation (and snow 
melt) (Figure 5.9a) produce higher soil moisture levels into 
early spring (Figure 5.9c). In the warmer climate, snow 
melt and the summer drying begin earlier, reducing the soil 
moisture levels in summer relative to the present climate 
(Figures 5.8d, e, f, 5.9c). The drying in the 2xC02 
simulation is also more rapid due to the higher 
temperatures and in some regions is reinforced by reduced 
precipitation. Reductions in surface moisture may lead to a 
drying of the boundary layer, reduced low cloud and hence 
further warming and drying of the surface (Manabe and 
Wetherald, 1987) (see also Figure 5.5). 
In most models, the soil over much of mid-latitudes (35 
to 55°N) is close to saturation in spring in both the lxCCb 
and 2xCC>2 simulations, so that on enhancing CCb, the 
summer drying starts earlier but from the same level (for 
example, Figure 5.10a). In a minority of models (Meehl 
and Washington, 1988,1989: Mitchell and Warrilow. 1987) 
the soil in the lxC02 formulation is not close to saturation, 
and the enhanced winter precipitation in 2xCC>2 simulation 
is stored in the soil. Hence, although the summer drying in 
the 2xCC>2 experiments starts earlier, it starts from a higher 
level than in the control simulation, and may not become 
drier before next winter season (Figure 5.10b). Even in 
these models, the surface becomes drier in the southern 
mid-latitudes in the 2xC02 simulations. 
From the experiments carried out to date, the following 
factors appear to contribute to the simulated summer drying 
in mid-latitudes. 
i) 
The soil is close to saturation in late winter (spring in 
higher latitudes) in the control simulation, so that 
increased precipitation in the anomaly simulation is 
run off and is not stored in the soil, 
ii) 
The greater the seasonal variation of soil moisture in 
the control simulation, the greater the change due to 
an earlier start to the drying season (for example 
Figure 5.9c). Of course, if the soil moisture content in 
the simulation of present climate is very small in 
summer, it cannot decrease much. A comparison of 
model and field data over the Soviet Union 
(Vinnikov and Yeserkepova, 1989) indicates that the 
simulated soil moisture levels in some models are 
much too low in summer. The simulated reduction in 
soil moisture due to doubling CO2 in such models 
would then be less than if higher, more realistic 
levels of soil moisture were present in the contiol 
simulation.

In higher latitudes, snow melts earlier 
Hence 
accurate simulation of snow cover is important 
IV) 
The changes in soil moisture can be amplified by 
feedbacks involving changes in cloud 
v) 
Enhanced summer drying in mid-latitudes may occur 
even in models which produce enhanced pre-
cipitation Of course, the drying is more pronounced 
in those models (and regions) in which precipitation 
is reduced in summer 
The simulated changes of soil moisture in the tropics 
vary liom model to model, being more directly related to 
changes in precipitation 
5 2 2 4 Sea ice changes 
In simulations with enhanced CO2, both the extent and 
thickness ol sea ice are significantly reduced In some 
summer simulations sea ice is completely removed in the 
Arctic (Wilson and Mitchell, 1987a Boer, 1989, personal 
communication) and around Antarctica (Wilson and 
Mitchell 1987a) In other models there aie large reductions 
in the extent ol sea ice but some cover iemains in the 
Arctic and aiound Antarctica in summer (Noda and 
Tokioka, 1989 Meehl and Washington, 1989) Finally in 
some models (Wetherald 1989, peis comm) the extent ol 
sea-ice change is less, but the thickness is reduced bv up to 
a factor of two 
The factors contributing to the differences between 
models include diffeicnccs in the sea-ice extent and depth 
in the control simulation (Spelman and Manabe, 1984), 
differences in the treatment of sea-ice albedo (for example, 
Washington and Meehl, 1986), and the inclusion of 
corrective heat-llux undei sea ice in some models (for 
example Manabe and Wetheiald, 1989, personal comm-
unication, Boer, 1989 personal communication) and not 
others 
On the basis ot cunent simulations, it is not possible to 
make reliable quantitative estimates ol the changes in the 
sea ice extent and depth It should be noted that the models 
considered here neglect ice dynamics, leads, salinity 
effects, and changes in ocean circulation 
5 2 2 5 Changes in mean sea 
le\elpiesswe 
Except in areas close to the equator, sea-level pressure 
(SLP) changes give an indication of changes in the low-
level circulation, including the strength and intensity of the 
mean suilace winds The changes in SLP have been 
assessed using the limited number of results available 
(Table 3 2a, entries 7, H, 15, 20-22), though in most cases, 
information on the statistical significance of the changes 
was not provided

Both the subtropical anticyclones and the Antarctic 
cncumpolai low pressure trough diminish in intensity 
(Figure 5 11 over page) This is presumably due to the 
relatively strong warming over sea-ice around Antarctica 
reducing the equator-to-pole temperature gradient (for 
example, Figure 5 2) Note that at higher levels of the 
troposphere, the equator-to-pole temperature gradient is 
increased (for example, Figure 5 2) and may be sufficient 
to produce stronger westerly flow at upper levels (Mitchell 
and Wilson, 1987a), and that coupled models do not 
produce a large warming around Antarctica (see Section 6)

in the fiequency or intensity of atmospheric disturbances 
(see Section 5 3 3) There are also reductions over much of 
the northern hemisphere continents in January, although 
both models produce increases over parts ot Canada and 
Siberia A third study (Rind et al , 1989b) reports decreases 
over the United States though generally they are not 
statistically significant 
5 3 I 2 Intel annual \ai iabilit\ 
Apart from a general reduction in the vicinity of the winter 
sea-ice margins, no meaningful patterns of change could be 
distinguished (Five models were considered. Table 3 2a, 
entries 7, 11, 13, 15,20) 
S 3 1 3 Dim nal i ange of tempo aim e 
There is no compelling evidence for a general reduction in 
the amplitude of the diurnal cycle 
The increases in CCb and other 
greenhouse 
gases 
incicase the downward longwave flux at the surface 
(Section 2) Both the upward flux of longwave radiation 
and evaporative cooling increase non linearly with surface 
temperatuie One would expect the increased downward 
radiation to produce a larger warming at night (when the 
surface temperature and hence the iate of increase of 
radiative and evaporative cooling with increase in 
temperature is smaller) than during the day and hence a 
reduction in diurnal range 
Only a few models contain a diurnal cycle (see Table 
3 2a) Boer (personal communication) reports a small 
reduction (0 28°C) in the globally averaged diurnal iange 
of temperature (Table 3 2a, entry 20) In another study 
(Rind et al , 1989b) the range usually decreased over the 
United States, especially in summei 
However 
Cao 
(personal communication) found that increases in the 
diurnal iange of temperature were evident over much of the 
noithein mid-latitude continents especially in spring and 
autumn (Table 3 2a, entiy 15) although the global annual 
mean was reduced by 0 17°C The amplitude of the diurnal 
cycle may also be reduced by incieases in cloud cover oi 
ground wetness, or altered by changes in the latitude ol the 
snowline 
As these quantities (and changes in these 
quantities) vary greatly from model to model a reduction 
in the diurnal cycle seems far lrom certain 
5.3.2 
Precipitation 
Precipitation exhibits much more temporal and spatial 
variability than temperature As a result, the simulation of 
the mean (and variability) of precipitation for present day 
climate is less reliable than foi temperatuie, particularly in 
low iesolution models, and it is only possible to make weak 
statements concerning changes in vai lability

For example, in one study (Rind et al , 1989b) this 
tendency in interannual variability was found at 60-70% of 
the grid-points considered In another study (Wilson and 
Mitchell, 1987b) the summer rainfall over southern Europe 
decreased and the maximum number of consecutive days 
without rainfall increased substantially

\eitical motions (Noda and Tokioka 
1989 Hansen el al 
1989 Mitchell peis comm ) 
In one study (Noda and Tokioka, 1989) the area of 
precipitation over the globe decreased even though global 
mean precipitation increased There is a tendency for 
convective motions to penetrate higher (Mitchell and 
Ingram, 1989, Wetherald and Manabe, 1988) and perhaps 
over greater depth (Hansen et al , 1989) in a warmer 
climate These changes imply an increase in the more 
intense local rain storms and hence in run off, at the 
expense of the gentler but more persistent rainfall events 
associated with larger scale disturbances Note that not all 
models include the diurnal cycle which has a strong 
modulating influence on convection 
The tendency for local convective instability to inciease 
is likely to be independent of the particular model used as 
in a wanner climate, the radiative cooling of 
the 
atmosphere and the radiative heating of the surtace both 
increase (Mitchell et al , 1987) These changes must be 
balanced by the enhanced vertical transport of heat from 
the surtace 
Furthermore, given the non-linear increase in 
potential evaporation with increase in temperature 
the 
inciease in vertical heat tiansport is more likely to be 
achieved through latent heat rathei than by sensible heat, 
and hence accompanied by a marked inciease in convective 
rainfall 
5.3.3 Winds and 
Disturbances 
Current climate models 
particularly those at lower 
resolution have limited success in simulating storm tracks 
and low frequency variability, and do not resolve smaller 
scale disturbances such as hurricanes explicitly (Sections 
4 2 4, 4 6) Hence results from current models at best only 
give an indication of the likely changes in winds and 
disturbances

tiequency and intensity of disturbances A 1 eduction in 
mid-latitude synoptic variability might be expected as a 
icsult ol the ieduction in the equator to-pole lempeiatuie 
gradient at low levels (loi example Figure 5 2) Results on 
changes in day-to-day variability weie available lrom only 
two models There was a geneial reduction in the standard 
deviation in mid-latitudes in winter though the patteins of 
change differed considerably 
By applying a time filtei to 
the daily vaiiances of 500mb height one can pick out the 
mid latitude storm tracks (Blackmon 
1975) In wintei 
Siegmund (1990) found a reduction in the intensity of the 
filtered vaiiances ol 500m b height in mid latitudes and an 
inciease in high latitudes (Table 1 2a entiy I5)) In anothci 
study (Bates and Meehl 
1986 Table 1 2u entiy 6) a 
simildi reduction in the filtered vanance ol 5()()mb heights 
was icported 
All these changes indicate a decieasc in the 
intensity oi frequency (oi both) ol distuibuncos lesolved on

do not allow one to conclude the same loi smallei scale 
synoptic distuibailees One study (Bates and Meehl 1986) 
icports a reduction in blocking (delmed as aieas ol high

in the southern hemisphere, and changes in the positions 
but not the intensity ol blocking in the Noithcin 
Hemispheie though no information was piovided on the

It has been observed that tiopical stonns (humcancs 
typhoons or cyclones) form only wheie the sea surface 
tempeiatures (SSTs) are 27°C or gieatei This might lead 
one to expect a more widespicud occuircnce ol tropicul 
stoims in a warmer climate A recent theoietical model ol 
tiopical stoims suggests that the maximum possible 
intensity would increase, with an enhancement of 
destructive powei (as measured by the square ol the wind 
speed) ol 40% for an increase ol VC in SST (Emanuel 
1987) 
Howevei, Emanuel (1987) did note that very few 
tiopical storms in the present climate actually attained the 
maximum intensity predicted by his analysis 
In a 
complementary study, Meinll (1988) discussed the 
environmental influences on humcune intensificution In 
ugieement with Fmunuel 
Meinll concluded that the 
maximum intensity ol a tiopical stonn is bounded above by 
a monotonicall)

North Atlunlic Meinll wus uble to identify a number of

deepening of a tropical storm, even if the SSTs are

low-level cyclonic vorticity und mid-troposphenc humidity

There is no guuiuntee that criteria such as the lower bound 
ol SST of 27 C would iemuin constunt with chunges in 
climate Theie is little agiecment in the simulated changes 
in tiopical cnculution due to doubling CO? in cuirent 
climate models (us shown by the differing putteins of 
chunges in tropicul piccipitution) Furtheimore, the models 
consideied in this section ignore chunges in ocean 
cnculation which form pait of the El Nino phenomenon 
and lead to the associated anomalies in SST and 
atmosphenc cnculution which huve u profound influence 
on the present distnbution and liequency of tropical 
stoims 
High lesolution utmosphcnc models used for weuther 
foiecustmg show consideiuble success at predicting the 
development and tiack ol tiopical cyclones (Dell Osso and 
Bengtsson 1985 Knshnamuiti et al , 1989, Morris 1989) 
although the honzontal iesolution used (~100km) is 
inadequate to lcsolve their detailed structure Krishnumurti 
ct ul (1989) lound that the quuhty of the foiecusts 
dccicuscd us honzontul iesolution was decreased but even 
so the simulated maximum wind intensity decreased little 
until much coaiser (ubove 400 km) iesolution wus reuched 
At the lowei iesolution used in climute studies (250 km or 
gieutei) one can choose objective criteria (foi example, a 
waim coie and low level vorticity and surface piessure 
depiession gieatei 
than specified 
limits) to select 
appropriate cyclones and compare their seasonal and 
geogiaphicul distnbutions with those of observed tropical 
stoims 
In both iespects the simulated storms resemble 
those obseived ovei most oceans (Manabe et al 
1970, 
Bengtsson el al 
1985 Bioccoh and Manabe 1990 (Table 
12a entiy 21) ) Thus although global models cannot 
iesolve huincunes explicitly they give u surprisingly good 
indicution ot the regions oi potential hurricane formation 
In contiast to empirical methods the criteria chosen are not 
obviously dependent on the present climate 
Using models with prescribed cloudiness, Broccoli and 
Manabe (1990) lound an inciease of 20% in the number of 
storm days (a combined measure of the number and 
duiation of storms) on doubling CO? This is attributed to 
enhunccd cvuporution leuding to increased moisture 
conveigence und lutent heat release which is converted to 
locally transient kinetic energy (stronger winds) 
In 
5 Equilibi mm Climate Change 
/SS 
contrast, in an experiment in which cloudiness was allowed 
to change, the number of storm days dccieased by 10 to 
15% even though the increase in evaporation was even 
greater in this experiment The increases in local energy 
generation and conversion were smaller, and the associated 
winds weakened slightly The reason for this discrepancy 
has not been found, nor has the role of cloud feedback in 
these results been identified 
A preliminary experiment with a model which resolves 
hurricanes (Yamasaki, personal communication) showed an 
increase in the number, and a decrease in the intensity of 
tropical disturbances when sea surface temperatures were 
increased, but the simulation was very short 
In summary, the maximum intensity of tropical storms 
may increase, but the distribution and frequency of 
occurrence will depend on the detailed changes in aspects 
of circulation in the tropics which are probably not yet 
adequately simulated by climate models 
5.4 Regional Changes - Estimates for 2030 (assuming 
IPCC "Business-as-Usual" Scenario) 
5.4.1 Introduction 
In order to assess the impacts of future changes in climate, 
one needs to know the changes and rates of change in 
climate on a regional scale (1 e , areas of order 1000 km 
square or so) Results from current equilibrium experiments 
often differ regarding regional variations in the changes 
Furthermore, few time-dependent simulations have been 
carried out (Section 6), none correspond exactly to the 
IPCC Scenarios and all use low horizontal resolution 
Neveitheless, one of the briefs of Woiking Group I was to 
provide estimates ol changes in 5 selected regions 
In order to provide these regional estimates it has been 
necessary to make certain assumptions and appioximations 
(Section 5 4 3) 
The main conclusions ol this section (see Tabic 5 I -
next page) are 
1 
The regional changes in temperature may vary 
substantially from the global mean, and the 
magnitudes of regional changes in precipitation and 
soil moisture are typically 10 to 20% at 2010 under 
the IPCC "Business-as-Usual Scenario 
2 
Although there is still substantial disagreement in 
some regions between the models considered, the 
agreement is better than in earlier studies (e g , 
Schlesinger and Mitchell, 1987) 
5.4.2 Limitations Of Simulated Regional Changes 
Although there is agreement between models on the 
qualitative nature of the large-scale changes in tempeiatuie 
and to a lesser extent precipitation, theie is much less 
agreement when one considers variations in the changes on 
a legional (sub continental) scale i e 
areas ol ordei 
1 000 000 km2 Foi example it is likely that increases in 
greenhouse gases will inciease piecipilation neai 60 
degrees ol latitude north, but theie is little agreement 
between models on the variation of the incieases with 
longitude The horizontal resolution of most models used 
until now (typically 250-700km) is inadequate to pioduce 
an accurate lepresentation ol many of the regional leatuies 
of climate especially precipitation, which is stiongly 
influenced by topography The parameterization ol pio-
cesses not explicitly resolvable on the model grid also leads 
to errors at regional scales The models in Table 3 2a do 
not allow lor changes or interannual vanations in oceanic 
heat transport 
The nature ol inter-model discrepancies in these studies 
is illustrated by considering the changes averaged ovei 
several regions of about 4,000 000 km2 The iegions aie 
chosen so as to represent a range ol climates Dilleient 
models perform well in different regions Inconsistencies in 
the changes produced by different models may be iesolved 
to some extent by selecting those models giving the moie 
realistic simulations ol present climate Such critical 
evaluations at regional level will best be done by the 
potential users and revised as improved model simulations 
become available Confidence in any one prediction ol 
spatial variations 
in changes at a regional scale must 
presently be regarded as low 
An estimate of the changes in tempeiature, piecipitation 
and soil moisture aveiaged over the 5 iegions selected by 
IPCC is given in Section 5 4 4 The iesults aie based on the 
high resolution studies (Table 3 2a, entries 20-22) since in 
general these produce a better simulation ol present day 
climate (see Section 4) Results fiom five low iesolution 
models (Grotch 1988, 1989, pcisonal communication) 
(Table 3 2a. entnes 3, 7 11 13 15) were also considered 
There may be considerable variations within the iegions 
and in the changes produced by the different models within 
the regions 
5.4.3 Assumptions Made In Deriving Estimates For 2030 
The following assumptions have been made 
0 
The concentrations of greenhouse gases increase 
as in the IPCC "Business-as-Usual" Scenario. 
This assumes only modest incieases in efficiency and 
gives an effective doubling ol CO2 by about 2020 
and an effective quadrupling by about 2080 
Reference will also be made to IPCC Scenano B 
which assumes huge efficiency increases and sub 
stantial emission controls which dela> an effective 
doubling ol CO2 to about 2040 
11) 
The "best guess" of the magnitude ol the global 
mean equilibrium increase in surface temperature 
due to doubling C(>2 (the climate sensitmtv) is

The numbers 1, 2 and 3 in the third column correspond to the models under entries 20, 21 and 22 respectively in 
Table 3 2a 
2.5°C. This estimate is based on evidence from both 
models and obseivations (Section 5 2 1) 
in) 
The most reliable estimate of the regional patterns 
of change is given by the high resolution models. 
(Table 3 2a, entries 20-22) These models in general 
produce a better simulation of present climate than 
those run at lower resolution (Section 5 4 1) and give 
results which are moic consistent than those I mm 
earlier low resolution studies (see toi example, 
Schlesinger and Mitchell 1987 and Section 5 4 4) 
Note that although othei models give a mean 
vvarmins which is closei to the best cuess (lor

example, Table 3 2a, entries 17-19) they have a 
coarser resolution which degrades their simulation of 
regional climate Hence the pattei ns of change have 
been derived from the high resolution models, even 
though they give a warming which is larger than the 
' best guess" of 2 5°C 
The patterns of equilibrium and transient climate 
change are similar. As stated in Section 5 4 1, the 
lew time dependent simulations that have been run 
do not use the IPCC Emission Scenarios and so 
cannot be used directly and have been run at low 
horizontal iesolulion degrading their capability to

simulate regional changes Recent results horn the 
coupled ocean-atmosphere models (Section 6) 
indicate that the reduction ol the warming due to 
oceanic thermal inertia is paiticulaily pronounced in 
the circumpolar ocean ot the southern ocean and the 
northern North Atlantic where deep vertical mixing 
of water occurs Elsewhere, the reduction is much 
smaller and the time-dependent response is similar to 
the equilibrium response (Section 6, Figure 6 5c) 
The distribution of the changes in the hydrological 
cycle was also similar to that at equilibrium, but 
reduced in magnitude 
v) 
The 
regional 
changes 
in 
temperature, 
precipitation and soil moisture are proportional to 
the global mean changes in surface temperatures. 
This will be approximately valid except possibly in 
regions where the changes are associated with a shift 
in the position ol steep gradients, for example wheic 
the snowline retreats, or on the edge ol a rainbelt 
which is displaced In general, this assumption is 
likely to be less valid for precipitation and soil 
moisture than foi temperature In the cxpenment 
described in detail in Section 6 (Stouller et al, 1989), 
the mean temperature icsponsc north ol 30°S is about 
15% higher than the global mean response this 
enhancement is omitted in the regional estimates 
given below, 
vi) 
The changes in global mean temperature can be 
derived from a simple diffusion-upwelling box 
model. For the Business-as-Usual Scenario, this 
gives a warming of 1 3 to 2 6°C from pre-industnal 
times to present, with a "best guess" of 1 8°C 
(Section 6.6.2) For Scenario B, these estimates 
should be reduced by about 15% 
Although it is hard to justify some of these assumptions 
on nguorous scientific grounds, the errors involved are 
substantially smallei than the uncertainties arising Irom the 
threefold range ol climate sensitivity On the basis ol the 
above assumptions, the estimates ot regional change have 
been obtained by scaling the results Irom the high 
resolution models by a factor ol 1 8/ATs where ATs is the 
climate sensitivity ot the model involved 
5.4.4 Estimates Of Regional Change; Pre-industnal to 
2030 (IPCC "Business-as-Usual" Scenario) 
The leader should be aware of the limited ability ol cunent 
climate models to simulate regional climate change and 
assumptions made in denving the legional estimates 
(Sections 5 4 2 and 5 4 3 icspectively) The range ol values 
indicates the lange of uncertainty in regional changes 
ansmg Irom using three different models with a similai 
global sensitivity The results assume a global mean 
warming ot 1 8°C at 2030, consistent with a global mean 
sensitivity of 2 5°C (Section 6 6 2) IPCC Scenario B gives 
lesults which are about 15% lowei For a sensitivity ol 
1 5°C, the estimates below should be reduced by 30%, foi a 
sensitivity ot 4 5°C, they should be increased by 50% In 
geneial, confidence in these estimates is low, especially 
for the changes in precipitation and soil moisture The 
regions are shown in Figure 5 13 and the estimates from 
the three individual models are given in Table 5 1 
Central North America (35-50°N, 85-105°W) 
The warming varies from 2 to 4°C in winter and 2 to 3°C in 
summer. Precipitation increases range from 0 to 15% in 
winter whereas there are deceases of 5 to 10% in summer 
Soil moisture decreases in summer by 15 to 20% of the 
present value.

5.5 Empirical Climate Forecasting 
5.5.1 Introduction 
In the light ol the poor reliability of regional climate 
simulations using general circulation models, various 
authois have suggested the use ol data liom past climates 
as indicatois of legional climatic relationships for 
pio|ections ol future climate (loi example Flohn, 1977 
Budyko ct al , 1978, Budyko 1980, Kellogg and Schware 
1981 Budyko and Iziael, 1987 Budyko et al , 1987) A 
bncl description of the method is given in Section 3 4 1 
The mid-Holocenc (5-6 kbp), the Last Intcrglacial 
(Eemian oi Mikiluno, 125-HO kbp) and the Pliocene (3-4 
mbp) have been used as analogues toi tuture climates 
January July and mean annual tempeiatuies and mean 
annual precipitation were reconstructed for each ol the 
above tluee epochs (see Section 7 2 2) Estimates of the 
mean tempeiatuies over the Northern Hemispheic exceed 
the picsent temperature by appioximatcly 1 2 and 3-4°C 
dining the mid-Holocene 
Eemian and 
Pliocene 
iespecti\cl> These periods wcie chosen as analogues of 
futuie climate loi 2000 2025 and 2050 respectively 
5.5.2 Results 
5 5 2 / Tempei atm e 
Winter-time tempciature changes in the low and middle 
latitude zones are quite small for aicas dominated by 
marine climates Winter cold is, however, less severe in the 
interior regions of the continents in middle and high 
latitudes Summei warming is greater mainly in high 
latitudes In some low latitude continental regions there aie 
some areas of cooling due to increasing evaporation 
resulting lrom incieased precipitation over these regions 
S S 2 2 Pi capitation 
The influence ol global waiming on annual piecipitation 
over the continents appears to be more complicated than 
lor air temperatuie Dunng the mid-Holocene, precipitation 
was greater than at present ovei most of the northern 
continents although there weie decreases in some regions 
of the Euiopean teintory of the Soviet Union, as well as in 
some ccnlial legions ol the United States (Figuie 7 4b) 
Reconstructions ol the Pliocene climate indicate that 
precipitation increased over all land areas for which data 
aie available, paiticulaily in a numbei of aieas that are now 
deserts (Figure 7 2b) Foi this epoch, the mean latitudinal 
increase in annual precipitation over the continents of the 
Northern Hemispheie seems to show little dependence on 
latitude, averaging approximately 20 cm yr~' The tentative 
results loi the Eemian foi which data are less complete, 
indicate that piecipitation considerably exceeded the 
modern value in all regions for which data exist As 
discussed in Section 7 the data used in this study have 
various limitations, and it is possible that the need lor 
datable material to survive has introduced a bias against 
finding evidence of aridity

The change in forcing during the mid-Holocene and 
Eemian was very different to that due to doubltng CO2 
During both these periods, CO2 concentrations were 
smaller than present betng close to the pre-industnal level 
(Barnola ct al , 1987) The orbital perturbations increase 
the annual mean radiative heating in high latitudes (up to 5 
Wm"- during the mid-Holocene) and reduce it in the 
tropics (1 Win 2 dunng the mid-Holocene) The radiative 
forcing due to doubling CCb increases everywhere, from 
about 2 5 Wnr- in high latitudes to 5 Wm - in the tropics 
(Mitchell 
1990) The changes in oibital pcitmbations 
produce seasonal anomalies of up to 40 Wm~2 clt certain 
latitudes (Bergcr 
1979) whcieas the CCb forcing is

relatively constant thioughout the year Thus the mid-
Holocene and Eemian cannot be considered as reliable 
analogues for a climate with mcieased concentrations of 
greenhouse gases 
The changes in forcing during the Pliocene are less well 
known Carbon dioxide levels may have been higher than 
present, but whether or not they were as high as double 
present concentrations is disputed (Section 7 2 2 1) Other 
factors, such as a lower Himalayan massif and an open 
Isthmus of Panama (which would have profoundly affected 
the circulation of the North Atlantic) are likely to have 
altered the climate in those regions The geographical 
distribution of data for the Pliocene are limited and there 
are difficulties in establishing that data from different sites 
are synchronous (Section 7 2 2) In view of all these 
factors, it is at best unclear that the reconstiucted patterns 
of climate change during the Pliocene can be regarded as 
analogues of warming due to increases in greenhouse 
gases

The analogue method is based on the assumptions that the 
patterns of climate change are relatively insensitive to the 
different changes in forcing factors leading to warming 
Recent numerical studies of the equilibrium response to 
increased CO2 give a consistent picture of continental scale 
changes so one can compare the laige-scale features from 
these simulations with those deduced lrom the palaeo-
analoguc approach The main discrepancies are

A cooling is consistent with the icduction in 
insolation in the tropics during the mid-Holocene and 
Eemian, and is also reproduced in numencal 
simulations in which the orbital pertuibations have 
been imposed (for example, Kutzbach and Guettcr 
1986, Mitchell et al , 1988) As noted above inc 
leases in CO2 produce a iadiative warming of the 
tropics, whereas the relevant changes in oibital 
properties produce a radiative cooling Thus on both 
simple physical giounds and on the basis of model 
simulations, the palaeo-chmatic reconstructions are 
probably misleading in this iespect

Thus, numerical simulations ol the mid-Holocene

circulations 
Again, on simple physical grounds and 
on the basis ot model simulations (for example 
Kutzbach and Guctter, 1986, Mitchell et al 
1988) it 
appeals that the changes in precipitation in the and 
subtropics during these epochs are due to oibital 
changes

The simulated changes may be in error (though there 
is a plausible physical explanation) 01 the palaeo 
climatic data have been miscompiled 01 mis-
interpreted 
From the above it seems likely that changes in orbital 
parameters alone can account lor much of the changes from 
present climate found in the mid-Holocene and the Eemian 
that some of the large scale effects of the orbital pert-
urbations differ from those expected with an mciease in 
trace gases, and therefore that a necessaiy condition foi 
these periods to be considered as analogues for luture 
climate change is that the effects ol orbital vanations 
should be subtracted out At piesent, theie is no way ot 
doing this apait liom using simulated changes 
In conclusion the palaeo analogue appioach is unable to 
give icliablc estimates ot the equilibrium climatic cflect of 
incieascs in gieenhouse gases as suitable analogues aic not 
available and it is not possible to allow foi the deficiencies 
in the analogues which aie available 
Nevertheless 
information on past climates will piovide useful data 
against which to test the performance of climate models 
when run with appropriate forcing and boundaiy conditions 
(See Section 4 10) It should be noted that liom the point 
ol view of understanding and testing climate mechanisms 
and models palaeo climatic data on cool epochs may be 
just as uselul as data on warm epochs Special attention 
should be paid to times of relatively rapid climatic change 
when time-dependent effects and ecosystem responses may 
more closely iesemble those to be expected in the coming 
century 
5.6 The Climatic Effect of Vegetation Changes 
5.6.1 
Introduction 
In addition to the climatic impacts of increasing greenhouse 
gases alteration of vegetation cover by man can modily the 
climate For small areas this may result in only local 
160 
Eqmlibnum Climate Chcuis,e 5 
impacts, but for large areas it may result in important 
regional climate change, and may impinge upon regions 
remote from the area of change 
The vegetative cover (or lack of it) strongly controls the 
amount ot solar radiative heating absorbed by the land 
surface by varying the albedo (reflectivity) Heat absorbed 
by the surlace, in addition to heating the soil, piovides 
eneigy for evaporation and for heating the atmosphere 
directly (sensible heat) Thus, changes in albedo can 
strongly affect evaporation and atmospheric heating and so 
influence the hydrological cycle and atmospheric 
circulation Other aspects of vegetation cover, such as 
aerodynamic roughness, stomatal resistance 
canopy 
moisture capacity and rooting depth can affect the 
paititioning of incoming solai ladiation between 
evapoiation and sensible heat 
There aie three climatic regions whcie vegetation 
changes may have significant impacts on climate tropical 
torests, semi-arid and savannah and boreal forests The fust 
has received considerable attention and is covered in more 
detail below and in Section 10 Model studies of 
degradation of vegetation in the Sahel region of Atnca, 
particulaily with regard to changes in albedo and soil 
moisture availability, have shown that rainfall can be 
reduced over a wide part of the region (Rowntree and 
Sangster, 1986) Removal of boreal forests has been shown 
to delay spring snowmelt slightly by increasing albedo 
(Thomas, 1987) 
5.6.2 Global Mean Effects 
I The net effect of clefoie station on global mean climate is 
likeh to be small although the iei>ional impacts mas be 
pi of omul 
The conversion of forests to grassland is increasing in the 
tiopics The current rate of deforestation is estimated to be 
0 1x10° km2 yr"' (the total area ol tropical forest is about 
9 x 10° km2) Associated with the cleanng is a substantial 
iclease ol CO2 to the atmospheie (Section 1) The re-
placement of forest by grassland also incieases the 
leflcetion ol solar ladiation to space which tends to cool the 
climate, but this elfect is at present small compaied with 
the wanning effect of the accompanying incicascd CO2 
(see Section 1, 2 2 2, Section 2) The net effect of 
deforestation is therefore to warm climate The removal of 
all the tiopical forests could warm the climate by about 
0 VC ' Alternatively, if 10% ol the Earths land surface

foi a doubling of CO2 
were al forested in addition to the present cover, a global 
cooling of 0 2 to 0 4°C would be expected 
5.6.3 Regional Effects: Deforestation Of Amazonia 
One of the best studied examples ot deforestation is the 
Amazon Basin Besides changing net carbon storage in 
Amazonia defoiestation is affecting the regional energy 
and watei balance A number of modelling studies have 
concentiated on the climatic impact that might arise from 
complete deforestation of South America and, in particular, 
Amazonia (Hendei son-Sellers and Gornitz. 1984, Wilson, 
1984, Dickinson and Hendei son-Sellers, 1988, Lean and 
Wain low 1989, Nobie et al , 1990) The Amazon Basin 
contains about half of the world s tropical rainforests and 
plays a signilicant lole in the climate of that region It is 
estimated that appioximately half of the local rainfall is 
derived tiom local evaporation (Salati et al , 1978) The 
remainder is denved horn moisture advected from the 
surrounding oceans A major modification of the forest 
cover could theiefore have a significant climatic impact 
Reduced evaporation and a general reduction in rainfall, 
although by variable amounts, was found in most 
experiments 
/ Total defoic station of the Amazon basin could 1 educe 
laaifall localh In 20c/c 
The studies by Lean and Warnlow (1989) and Nobre et 
al (1990) show 1 eductions ol about 20% in rainfall in 
simulations in which vegetation parameters for forest were 
replaced by those lor giassland (Figuie 5 14) Lean and 
Warnlow showed that albedo and roughness changes 
contributed almost equally to the iainlall reduction, 
although moie recent work suggests that the contribution 
tiom roughness may have been slightly oveiestimated 
Nobre et al suggest that the switch to a more seasonal 
rainfall icgimc which they obtained, would prevent forest 
recovery A iccent experiment (Lean and Rowntree, 1989, 
personal communication) considered the impact of setting 
vegetation covei to descit over South Amenca noith of 
10°S Albedos similai to those of the most icllective parts 
ol the Sahaia weie used Annual rainlall was reduced by 
70% The seasonal change ol rainfall (Figure 5 15) became 
typical ol that obseived in semi-arid regions such as the 
Sahel This would permit the growth of some rainy season 
vegetation and thus a desert would be unlikely to be 
maintained over the whole region However, the results 
suggest that a widespread deforestation of the South 
American tropics could lead to an irreversible decline in 
rainfall and vegetative cover over at least part of the region

One of the largest sources ot uncertainty in the

prescribed radiative properties later models use schemes 
which explicitly represent cloud water and allow cloud 
radiative properties to vary The latter are more detailed but 
not necessarily more accurate as more parameters have to 
be specified The radiative effect of clouds depends on 
cloud height, thickness and fractional cover on cloud water 
content and cloud droplet size distribution (and in the case 
of ice clouds the size distribution shape and onentation of 
particles) (see Section 1^4) 
Thus theie is a need to 
understand both the microph>sics ol cloud 
and then 
relation to the laigei scale cloud propeities This will 
require further 
satellite observations (toi 
example 
Barkstrom et al , 1986) and caieiully designed field studies 
(foi example Raschke 
1988 
Cox et al 
1987) 
In 
particular, theie is a need to refine out knowledge ol ice 
clouds and then radiative properties 
Another laige uncertainty lies in the icpiesentation ol 
convection in large-scale models Again the moie detailed 
(though not necessarily moie accurate) paiameten/ations 
produce different results Irom the simplei 
schemes 
including a much greater warming in the tropics It is less 
obvious how to reduce this uncertainty though it ma> be 
that a comparison of the observed and simulated response 
to past anomalies in tropical SSTs may help to eliminate 
the more unrealistic schemes 
Thndly, the changes in giound wetness and suitace 
temperatuie have been shown to be highK sensitive to the 
tieatment ol the land surface In addition the ettects ot 
vegetation and changes in vegetation aie ignoied m the 
models used in Table 1 2a Again piocess SUUIILS

Organization, 1985, 1987) are needed to guide the devel-
opment of surface parameterizations and their validations. 
Finally the oceans and sea-ice constitute a major source 
of uncertainty about which more is said in Section 6. Here 
it has been shown that the distribution of sea-ice and 
changes in sea-ice extent have a dominant influence on 
local temperature change, especially in winter. Most of the 
models considered here ignore salinity effects and possible 
changes in ocean heat and ice transport: some ignore ocean 
transport altogether. The inclusion of a more complete 
representation of the ocean may modify the simulated 
changes in sea-ice described here, and changes in ocean 
circulation could produce pronounced local anomalies in 
SST particularly in the neighbourhood of the major current 
systems or the main areas of deep water formation, with 
profound effects on the local climate.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The slowly changing response of climate to a gradual increase in 
greenhouse gas concentrations can only be modelled ngourously 
using a coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model with 
full ocean dynamics This has now been done by a small number 
of researchers using coarse resolution models out to 100 years 
Their results show that 
a) 
For a steadily increasing forcing, the global rise in 
temperature is an approximately constant fraction of the 
equilibrium rise corresponding to the instantaneous forcing 
for a time that is earlier by a fixed offset 
For an 
atmospheric model with temperature sensitivity 4°C for a 
doubling of CO2, this fraction is approximately 66% with 
an offset of 11 years In rough terms, the response is about 
60% of the current equilibrium value Extrapolation using 
robust scaling principles indicates that for a sensitivity of 
1 5°C the corresponding values are 85% 6 years and 80% 
respectively 
b) 
The regional patterns of temperature and precipitation 
change generally resemble those of an equilibrium 
simulation for an atmospheric model, though uniformly 
reduced in magnitude Exceptional regions are around 
Antarctica and in the northern North Atlantic, where the 
warming is much less 
c) 
These results are generally consistent with our 
understanding of the present circulation in the ocean, as 
evidenced by geochemical and other tracers 
However, 
available computer power is still a serious limitation on 
model capability, and existing observational data are 
inadequate to resolve basic issues about the relative roles of 
various mixing processes, thus affecting the confidence 
level that can be applied to these simulations 
d) 
The conclusions about the global mean can be extended 
though with some loss of rigour, by using a simple energy 
balance climate model with an upwelling diffusion model 
of the ocean, similar to that used to simulate CO2 uptake 
It is inferred that, if a steadily increasing greenhouse 
forcing were abruptly stabilized to a constant value 
thereafter, the global temperature would continue to rise at 
about the same rate for some 10-20 years, following which 
it would increase much more slowly approaching the 
equilibrium value only over many centuries 
e) 
Based on the IPCC Business as Usual scenarios, the 
energy-balance upwelling diffusion model with best 
judgement parameters yields estimates of global warming 
from pre-industrial times (taken to be 1765) to the year 
2030 between 1 3°C and 2 8"C, with a best estimate of 
2 0°C This corresponds to a predicted rise trom 1990 of 
0 7-1 5°C with a best estimate of 1 1"C 
Temperature rise from pre-industrial times to the year 2070 is 
estimated to be between 2 2°C and 4 8°C with a best estimate of 
3 3°C This corresponds to a predicted rise from 1990 of 1 6°C to 
3 5°C, with a best estimate of 2 4°C

6.1 Introduction 
6.7.7 Why Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Models ? 
The responses discussed in Section 5 are for a radiative 
forcing that is constant for the few years required for the 
atmosphere and the surface of the ocean to achieve a new 
equilibrium following an abrupt change Though the 
atmospheric models are detailed and highly developed, the 
treatment of the ocean is quite primitive However, when 
greenhouse gas concentrations are changing continuously, 
the thermal capacity of the oceans will delay and 
effectively reduce the observed climatic response At a 
given time, the realized global average temperature will 
reflect only part of the equilibrium change for the 
corresponding instantaneous value of the forcing Of the 
remainder, part is delayed by storage in the stably stratified 
layers of the upper ocean and is realized within a few 
decades or perhaps a century, but another part is effectively 
invisible for many centuries or longer, until the heating of 
the deep ocean begins to influence surface temperature In 
addition, the ocean currents can redistribute the greenhouse 
warming spatially, leading to regional modifications of the 
equilibrium computations Furthermore, even without 
changes in the radiative forcing, interactions between the 
ocean and atmosphere can cause mterannual and mter-
decadal fluctuations that can mask longer term climate 
change for a while 
To estimate these effects, and to make reliable 
predictions of climate change under realistic scenarios of 
increasing forcing, coupled atmosphere-ocean general 
circulation models (GCMs) are essential Such models 
should be designed to simulate the time and space 
dependence of the basic atmospheric and oceanic variables, 
and the physical processes that control them, with enough 
fidelity and resolution to define regional changes over 
many decades in the context of year to year variability In 
addition, the reasons for differences between the results of 
different models should be understood 
6.1.2 Types of Ocean Models 
The ocean circulation is much less well observed than the 
atmosphere, and there is less confidence in the capability of 
models to simulate the controlling processes As a result, 
there are several conceptually different types of ocean 
model in use for studies of greenhouse warming 
The simplest representation considered here regards the 
ocean as a body with heat capacity modulated by down-
ward diffusion below an upper mixed layer and a 
horizontal heat flux divergence within the mixed layer 
These vary with position, but are prescribed with values 
that result, in association with a particular atmosphcnc 
model running under present climatic conditions in 
simulations which fit observations loi the annual mean 
surface temperature, and the annual cycle about that mean 
In such a no surprises ocean (Hansen et al , 1988) the 
horizontal currents do not contribute to modifications of 
climate change 
A more faithful representation is to treat the additional 
heat associated with forcing by changing greenhouse gases 
as a passive tracer which is advected by three-dimensional 
currents and mixed by specified diffusion coefficients 
intended to represent the sub-grid scale processes These 
currents and mixing coefficients may be obtained from a 
GCM simulating the present climate and ocean circulation, 
including the buoyancy field, in a dynamically consistent 
manner 
Using appropriate sources, the distributions ol 
transient and other tracers such as temperature-salinity 
relationships, 14C, tritium and CFCs are then inferred as a 
separate, computationally relatively inexpensive, step and 
compared with observations Poorly known parameters 
such as the horizontal and vertical diffusion coefficients are 
typically adjusted to improve the fit In box-diffusion 
models, which generally have a much coarser resolution, 
the currents and mixing are inferred directly from tracer 
distributions or are chosen to represent the aggregated 
effect of transports within a more detailed GCM Though 
potential temperature (used to measure the heat content per 
unit volume) affects the buoyancy of sea-water and hence 
is a dynamically active variable, a number of studies (e g , 
Bryan et al , 1984) have demonstrated that small, thermally 
driven, perturbations in a GCM do in fact behave in the 
aggregate very much as a passive tracer This approach is 
useful for predicting small changes in climate from the 
present, in which the ocean currents and mixing co-
efficients themselves are assumed not to vary in a 
significant manner There are at present no clear guidelines 
as to to what is significant for this purpose 
A complete representation requires the full power of a 
high resolution ocean GCM, with appropriate boundary 
conditions at the ocean surface involving the wind stress, 
net heat flux and net freshwater flux obtained from an 
atmospheric model as a function oi time in exchange for a 
simulation of the ocean surface temperature The explicit 
simulation of mixing by mesoscale eddies is feasible and 
highly desirable (Semtner and Chervin 
1988), but it 
requires high spatial resolution, and so far the computer 
capacity required for 100 year simulations on a coupled 
global eddy resolving ocean-atmosphere GCM has not 
been available Sea-ice dynamics are needed as well as 
thermodynamics, which is highly parameterized in existing 
models For a fully credible climate prediction what is 
required is such a complete, dynamically consistent 
representation, thoroughly tested against observations 
General circulation models ol the coupled ocean 
atmosphere system have been under development for many 
years but they have been restricted to coarse resolution 
models in which the mixing coefficients in the ocean must 
1X0 
Time-Dependent Gi eenhouse-Gai-Induced Climate Change 6 
be prescribed ad hoc, and other unphysical devices are 
needed to match the ocean and atmospheric components 
Despite these limitations, such models are giving results 
that seem consistent with our present understanding of the 
broad features of the ocean circulation, and provide an 
important tool for extending the conclusions of the 
equilibrium atmospheric climate models to time dependent 
situations, at least while the ocean circulation does not vary 
greatly from the present 
Because running coupled ocean-atmosphere GCMs is 
expensive and time consuming many of our conclusions 
about global trends in future climates are based upon 
simplified models, in which parts of the system are 
replaced by highly aggregated constructs in which key 
formulae are inferred from observations or from other, non-
mtcractive, models An energv, -balance atmospheric model 
coupled to a one dimensional upwelhng-ditfusion model of 
the ocean provides a useful conceptual framework, using a 
tracer representation to aid the interpretation of the results 
of the GCMs, as well as a powerful tool for quickly 
exploring future scenarios of climate change 
6.1.3 Major Sources of Uncertainty 
An unresolved question related to the coarse resolution of 
general circulation models i^ the extent to which the details 
of the mixing processes and ocean currents may affect the 
storage of heat on different time scales and hence the 
traction of the equilibrium global temperature rise that is 
realized only after several decades as opposed to more 
quickly or much more slowlv 
Indeed this issue rests in 
turn on questions whether the principal control mechanisms 
governing the sub-grid scale mixing are correctly 
incorporated 
For a more detailed discussion see Section 
48 
Paralleling these uncertainties are serious limitations on 
the observational data base to which all these models are 
compared, and from which the present rates of circulation 
are inferred These give rise to conceptual differences of 
opinion among oceanographers about how the circulation 
actually functions 
Existing observations of the large scale distribution of 
temperature, salinity and other geochemical tracers such as 
tritium and 14C do indicate that near surface water sinks 
deep into the water column to below the main thermochne, 
primarily in restricted regions in high latitudes in the North 
Atlantic and around the Antarctic continent Associated 
with these downwelling regions, but not not necessarily co-
located, are highly localized patches of intermittent deep 
convection, or turbulent overturning of a water column that 
is gravitationally unstable Though controlled to a sig-
nificant extent by salinity variations rather than by 
temperature, this deep convection can transfer heat 
vertically very rapidly 
However, much less clear is the return path of deep 
water to the ocean surface through the gravitationally stable 
thermochne which covers most of the ocean It is disputed 
whether the most important process is nearly horizontal 
motion bulk motion in sloping isopycnal surfaces of 
constant potential density, ventilating the thermochne 
laterally In this view, significant mixing across isopyncal 
surfaces occurs only where the latter intersect with the well 
mixed layer just below the ocean-atmosphere interface, 
which is stirred from above by the wind and by surface 
heat and water fluxes (Woods, 1984) Another view, still 
held by some oceanogiaphers, is that the dominant 
mechanism is externally driven in situ mixing in a 
gravitationally stable environment and can be described by 
a local bulk diffusivity 
To obtain the observations 
necessary to describe more accurately the real ocean 
circulation, and to improve our ability to model it for 
climate purposes, the World Ocean Circulation Experiment 
is currently underway (see Section 11) 
6.2 Expectations Based on Equilibrium Simulations 
Besides the different types of model, it is important also to 
distinguish the different experiments that have been done 
with them 
With the exception of the few time-dependent 
simulations described in Sections 6 3 - 6 6 , perceptions of 
the geographical patterns of CC>2-induced climate change 
have been shaped mainly by a generation of atmospheric 
GCMs coupled to simple mixed layer or slab ocean models 
(see review by Schlesinger and Mitchell, 1987) With these 
specified-depth mixed-layer models having no computed 
ocean heat transport, CO2 was instantaneously doubled and 
the models run to equilibrium Averages taken at the end of 
the simulations were used to infer the geographical patterns 
of CO? induced climate change (Section 5) 
Generally, the models agreed among themselves in a 
qualitative sense Surface air temperature increase was 
greatest in late autumn at high latitudes in both 
hemispheres, particularly over regions covered by sea-ice 
This was associated with a combination of snow/sea-ice 
albedo feedback and reduced sea-ice thermal inertia Soil 
moisture changes showed a tendency for drying of mid-
continental regions in summer, but the magnitude and even 
the sign of the change was not uniform among the models 
(see also Section 5 2 2 3) This inconsistency is caused by 
a number of factors Some had to do with how soil 
moisture amounts were computed in the control sim-
ulations (Meehl and Washington, 1988), and some had to 
do with the method of simulating the land surface (Rind et 
al, 1989) Also, all models showed a strong cooling in the 
lower stratosphere due to the radiative effects of the 
increased carbon dioxide 
6 Time Dependent Gi eenhouse Gas-Indue ed Climate Change 
1H1 
Recently, a new generation of coupled models has been 
run with atmospheric GCMs coupled to coarse-grid, 
dynamical ocean GCMs These models include realistic 
geography, but the coarse grid of the ocean part (about 500 
km by 500 km) necessitates the parameterization of 
mesoscale ocean eddies through the use of horizontal heat 
diffusion This and other limitations involved with such an 
ocean model are associated with a number of systematic 
errors in the simulation (e g , Meehl, 1989) However, the 
ability to include an explicitly computed ocean heat 
transport provides an opportunity to study, for the first 
time, the ocean's dynamical effects on the geographical 
patterns of CC>2-induced climate change 
6.3 Expectations Based on Transient Simulations 
The first simulations with these global, coupled GCMs 
applied to the CO~2 problem used the same methodology as 
that employed in the earlier simple mixed-layer models 
That is, CO"2 was doubled instantaneously and the model 
run for some time-period to document the climate changes 
It has been suggested, however, that because of the long 
thermal response time ot the full ocean, and the fact that 
the warming penetrates downward from the ocean surface 
into its interior, the traditional concept of a sensitivity 
experiment to determine a new equilibrium may be less 
useful with such a coupled system (Schlesinger and Jiang, 
1988) 
Schlesinger et al (1985) ran a two-level atmospheric 
model coupled to a 6-layer ocean GCM for 20 years after 
instantaneously doubling CCb They noted that the model 
could not have attained an equilibrium in that period, and 
went on to document changes in climate at the end of the 
experiment 
Washington and Meehl (1989) performed a 
similar experiment over a 30 year period with inst-
antaneously doubled CO~2 in their global spectral 
atmospheric GCM coupled to a coarse-grid ocean GCM 
Manabe et al (1990) also used a global spectral atm-
ospheric GCM coupled to a coarse-grid ocean model in an 
instantaneous CO2 doubling experiment for a 60-year 
period 
These model simulations have been referred to as 
transient experiments in the sense that the time evolution of 
the whole climate system for a prescribed 'switch-on' 
instantaneous CO2 doubling could be examined in a 
meaningful way 
In some respects, all the switch-on coupled GCM 
experiments agree with the earlier mixed-layei iesults In 
the Northern Hemisphere, warming is larger at higher 
latitudes, and there is some evidence, though again mixed 
of drying in the mid-continental regions in summer 
Manabe et al (1990) also obtained a wetter soil in middle 
latitudes in winter In the summer however, Manabe et al 
(1990) found large areas in the middle latitudes where the 
soil was drier However, sector-configuration simulations 
(Bryan et al , 1988) with a coupled GCM hrst suggested a 
major difference in the patterns of climate change 
compared with the earlier mixed-layer model experiments 
Around Antarctica, a relative warming minimum, at times 
even a slight cooling, was evident in these simulations 
6.4 Expectations Based on Time-Dependent 
Simulations 
The term time-dependent in the present context is taken to 
mean a model simulation with gradually increasing 
amounts of greenhouse gases This is what is happening in 
the real climate system, and such simulations provide us 
with the first indication of the climate-change signals we 
may expect in the near future 
To date, three such simulations have been published 
One has been performed with an atmospheric model 
coupled to a simple ocean with fixed horizontal heat 
transport (Hansen et al , 1988), and the other two have used 
atmospheric models coupled to coarse-grid dynamical 
ocean models, that is, atmosphere-ocean 
GCMs 
(Washington and Meehl, 1989, Stouffer et al , 1989) 
Other studies using coupled ocean-atmosphere GCMs are 
in progress at the UK Meteorological Of lice (Hadley 
Centre) and the Max Plank Institute fur Meteorologie, 
Hamburg 
6.4.1 Changes In Surface Air Temperature 
Hansen et al (1988) performed several simulations with 
CO2 and other greenhouse gases increasing at various 
rates, aimed at assessing the detectability ol a wanning 
trend above the inherent variability of a coupled ocean-
atmosphere system The ocean model was a no surprises 
ocean as described in Section 6 1 2, which simulates the 
spatially varying heat capacity typical of present climate 
but precludes leedback to climate change lrom the ocean 
currents 
At any given time the simulated wanning was 
largest in the continental interior of Asia and at the high 
latitudes of both hemispheres, though it was first 
unambiguous in the tropics where the interannual 
variability is least Contrasting with some othci sim-
ulations, regional patterns of climate anomalies also had a 
tendency to show greater warming in the central and 
southeast U S , and less warming in the western U S The 
Antarctic also warmed about as much as conespondmg 
northern high latitudes, a result that may be sensitive to the 
assumptions about ocean heat transport in this model 
Washington and Meehl (1989) specified a V/< per year 
Iincui increase of CO2 in then coupled atmosphere-ocean 
GCM over a 30-year period and documented changes in the 
ocean-atmosphere system For this period there was a 
tendency for the land areas to warm faster than the oceans 
and foi the warming to be larger in the surface layci of the 
182 
Time-Dependent Gieenhouse-Gas-Induced Climate Change 6 
ocean than below Significant areas of ocean surface 
temperature increase tended to occur between 50°S and 
30°N (Figure 6.1). Warming was smaller and less 
significant around Antarctica. In the high latitudes of the 
Northern Hemisphere there was no zonally consistent 
warming pattern, in contrast to the earlier mixed-layer 
experiments. In fact, there was a cooling in the North 
Atlantic and Northwest Pacific for the particular five-year 
period shown in Figure 6.1. Washington and Meehl (1989) 
show that this cooling was a consequence of alterations in 
atmospheric and ocean circulation involving changes in 
precipitation and a weakening of the oceanic thermohahne 
circulation However, there was a large inter-annual 
variability at high latitudes in the model, as occurs in 
nature, and Washington and Meehl pointed out that the 
pattern for this five-year period was indicative only of 
coupled anomalies that can occur in the system. 
Nevertheless, similar patterns of observed climate 
anomalies have been documented for temperature trends 
over the past 20-year period in the Northern Hemisphere 
(Karoly, 1989; Jones et al., 1988). 
Stouffer et al. (1989) performed a time-dependent 
experiment 
with 
CO2 
increasing 
1% per year 
(compounded), and documented geographical patterns of 
temperature differences for years 61-70. Stouffer et 
al (1989) show the continents warming faster than the 
oceans, and a significant warming minimum near 60°S 
around Antarctica, as was seen in earlier sector 
experiments (Bryan et al., 1988). As was also seen in the 
Washington and Meehl results, there was not a uniform 
pattern of warming at all longitudes at high latitudes in the 
Northern Hemisphere A minimum of warming occurred in 
the northwestern North Atlantic in association with deep 
overturning of the ocean. Though the greatest warming 
occurred at high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, the 
greater variability there resulted in the warming being 
unambiguously apparent first in the subtropical ocean 
regions. 
The main similarities in the geographical patterns of 
C02-induced temperature change among these three time-
dependent experiments are: 
AT991 DJF, transient minus control, (yr 26—30) 
AT991 JJA transient minus control (yr 26—30)

1) 
the warming at any given time is less than the 
corresponding equilibrium value for that inst-
antaneous forcing, 
2) 
the areas of warming are generally greater at high 
latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere than at low 
latitudes, but are not zonally uniform in the earlier 
stages of the time-dependent experiments, and 
3) 
because of natural variability, statistically significant 
warming is most evident over the subtropical oceans 
The differences between the time-dependent experiment 
using specified ocean heat transports (Hansen et al , 1988) 
and the two time dependent experiments with dynamical 
ocean models (Washington and Meehl, 1989, Stouffer et 
al, 1989) are 
1) 
a warming minimum (or slight cooling) around 
Antarctica in the models with a dynamical ocean 
precludes the establishment of the large, positive ice-
albedo feedback that contributes to extensive 
southern high-latitude warming in the mixed-layer 
models, and 
2) 
a warming minimum in the northern North Atlantic 
These local minima appear to be due to exchange of the 
surface and deep layers of the ocean associated with 
upwelhng as well as downwelling, or with convective 
overturning The downwelling ot surface water in the 
North Atlantic appears to be susceptible to changes of 
atmospheric circulation and precipitation and the attendant 
weakening of the oceanic thermohahne circulation 
6.4.2 Changes In Soil Moisture 
As indicated in Section 4 5, large-scale precipitation 
patterns are very sensitive to patterns of sea-surface 
temperature anomalies Rind et al (1989) link the occ-
urrence of droughts with the climate changes in the time-
dependent simulations of Hansen et al (1988), and predict 
increased droughts by the 1990s Washington and Meehl 
(1989) found in their time-dependent experiment that the 
soil in mid-latitude continents was wetter in winter and had 
small changes of both signs in summer These time 
dependent results are consistent with the results from their 
respective equilibrium climate change simulations (Section 
5) A full analysis of the experiment described in Stouffer 
et al (1989) is not yet available, but preliminary ind-
ications (Manabe, 1990) are that they are similarly 
consistent, though there may be some small changes in 
global scale patterns 
6.5 An Illustrative Example 
In this section, we illustrate the promise and limitations of 
interactive ocean-atmosphere models with more details of 
one of the integrations described in Section 6 4 drawing on 
Stouffer et al (1989) and additional material supplied by 
Manabe (1990) 
6.5.1 The Experiment 
Three 100-year simulations are compared with different 
radiative forcing, each starting from the same, balanced 
initial state The concentration of atmospheric carbon 
dioxide is kept constant in a control run 
In two 
complementary perturbation runs the concentration ol 
atmospheric carbon dioxide is increased or decreased by 
1% a year (compounded) implying a doubling or halving 
after 70 years This Iate of increase roughly corresponds in 
terms of CO? equivalent units to the present rate ol 
increase of forcing by all the greenhouse gases Since 
greenhouse warming is proportional to the logarithm ol 
carbon dioxide concentration (see Section 2, Table 2 2 4 1) 
an exponential increase gives a linear increase in radiative 
forcing 
To reach the initial balanced state the atmosphenc model 
is lorced to a steady state with the annual mean and 
seasonal variation of sea surface temperature given by 
climatological data Using the seasonally varying winds 
fiom the atmospheric model the ocean is then foiccd to a 
balanced state with the sea surface temperature and sea 
surface salinity specified from climatological data For 
models perfectly representing the present climate and 
assuming the climatological data are accurate the fluxes of 
heat and moisture should agree exactly 
In practice the 
models are less than perfect and the heat and moisture flux 
fields at the ocean surface have a substantial mismatch 
To compensate for this mismatch when the two models 
are coupled an ad hot (lux adjustment is added to the 
atmosphenc heat and moisture fluxes This flux ad] 
ustment which is a fixed function of position and season is 
precisely the concction icquired so that as long as the 
radiative forcing of the atmosphenc model icmains the 
same the coupled model will iemain balanced and 
fluctuate around a mean state that includes the obseived sea 
surface temperature and sea surlace salinity When the 
radiative balance ot the atmospheric model is peiturbed the 
coupled model is free to seek a new equilibrium because 
the ad hot flux adjustments remain as specified and 
provide no constraint to damp out depaituies fiom the 
present climate 
The flux adjustments in this treatment are nonphysical 
and disconcertingly large (Manabe 1990) but are simply a 
symptom of the inadequacies in the separate models and ol 
a mismatch between them Unfoitunately existing mea 
surements of ocean surface fluxes are quite inadequate to 
determine the precise causes This device or its equivalent 
(eg Sausen et al 1988) is the price that must be paid lor 
a controlled simulation ol perturbations from a realistic 
present day, ocean atmosphere climate Though varying 
through the annual cycle the pattern of adjustment is the 
184 
Time Dependent Gi eenhouse Gas-Indiued Climate Change 6 
mean surface air temperature within the control run itself 
(Figure 6 2) These imply a standard deviation in decadal 
averages of about ±0 08°C, which, though an accurate 
representation of the model climatology, appears to be 
somewhat less than what has been observed during the past 
100 years (see Section 8) The regional manifestation 
shown in Figure 6 3 illustrates the uncertainty that is 
inherent in estimates of time dependent regional climate 
change ovei 20 year periods 
Figure 6 4 shows the difference in 10-year, global 
average surface air temperature, between the +1% pert-
urbation run and the long term average of the control run, 
increasing approximately linearly as a function of time 
After 70 years, the instantaneous temperature is only 58% 
of the equilibrium value (4°C, see Wetherald and Manabe, 
1988) appropriate to the radiative forcing at that time This 
result compares reasonably well with the estimate of 55% 
obtained by running the box diffusion model ol Section 6 6 
with similar scenario of radiative forcing and a climate 
sensitivity of 4°C for a doubling of CO2 (see Figure 6 7 
later) However a result ol both simulations is that the 
response to a linear increase in forcing with time is also, 
after a brief initial phase very close to linear in time The 
time dependent response is thus at all times proportional to 
the instantaneous forcing, but at a reduced magnitude 
compared to the equilibrium Close examination of Figures 
6 4 and 6 7 show that a straight line fit to the response 
intersects the time axis at ten years Since lag in the 
response increases with time it is not a useful parameter to 
describe results As an alternative, the response is described 
in terms of a fraction of the equilibrium forcing which 
corresponds to a time with fixed offset to ten years earlier 
Thus in the case of Figure 6 4, the fractional response

same in all three simulations Its direct effects thus 
disappear when differences are considered, and the con-
clusions from such experiments should be reasonable 
provided the differences remain small However, when the 
simulated ocean circulation or atmospheric state differs 
greatly from that presently observed, indirect effects are 
likely to be substantial and too much credence should not 
be attached to the results There are currently no 
quantitative criteria for what differences should be 
regarded as small for this purpose 
6.5.2 Results 
Before examining the changes due to greenhouse forcing, it 
is instructive to note the random fluctuations in global

185 
Figure 6.4: The temporal variation of the difference in globally 
averaged, decadal mean surface air temperature (°C) between the 
perturbation run (with 1 % /year increase of atmospheric CO2) and 
the control run of the coupled ocean-atmosphere model For 
comparison, the equilibrium response of global mean surface air 
temperature ot the atmosphere mixed layer ocean model to the 
doubling of atmospheric CO2 is also indicated by x symbol al 
70th year when the gradually increasing CO? doubles 
would be 58%, with a slope of 68%, and an offset of about 
10 years A lag of about this magnitude was also noted by 
Washington and Meehl (1989) for their switch-on CO2 
experiment (see their Figure 4) 
On a regional scale, a 20-year average centred on 70 
years (Figure 6 5(a)) is sufficient to determine general 
features of climate change that aie significant against the 
background of natural variability (Figure 6 T) These 
features may be compaied to the corresponding inst-
antaneous equilibrium (Figure 6 5(b)) As shown in Figuie 
6 5(c), which illustrates the ratio ol the values in Figuies 
6 5(a) and 6 5(b), the lesponse is in general a relatively 
constant fraction, 60% 
80%, ot the equilibnum 
Major 
exceptions to this general picture are the northern Noith 
Atlantic, and the entire Southern Ocean between 40°S and 
60°S, where change is largely suppressed 
For the -1% perturbation run, the changes in tempciature 
patterns from the control closely mirror those from the 
+ 1% run, for the first 70 years at least but are opposite 
sign This supports the concept that the depaituie from the 
present climate can be described as a small pertuibation, 
and is not inconsistent with the interpietation of additional 
heat in the ocean behaving like a passive tracei 
6.5.3 Discussion 
A qualitative explanation for these model results seems to 
lie in strong vertical pathways between the surface and 
intermediate to deep water in the northern North Atlantic 
and in the Southern Ocean 
In this coupled ocean-
atmosphere model, for which the radiative transfer to space 
is relatively inefficient, downward transfer of additional 
heat through these pathways short circuits up to 40% of the 
global greenhouse gas forcing to the deep water, where it 
mixes into a large volume causing a small local temp-
erature rise Thence it is carried away by deep currents and 
is sequestered for many centuries As discussed in Section 
6 6 below, for a less sensitive atmospheric model the 
fraction short circuited would be smaller Over time-scales 
of 10-20 years, the remainder of the greenhouse warming 
brings the upper few hundred meters of most of the world 
ocean (the seasonal boundary layer and upper part of 
permanent thermochne) to approximate local equilibrium 
The pattern of temperature change resembles that of the 
equilibrium calculation 
though with a response 
commensurate with the reduced effective global forcing, 
because non-local processes in the atmosphere dominate 
inter-regional heat transfers in the surface layers of the 
ocean 
However, in exceptional regions an additional effect is 
operating In the northwestern North Atlantic localized 
deep convection, which is a realistic feature of the model 
influenced by salinity contrasts, causes a very efficient heat 
transfer which, every winter effectively pins the nearby 
ocean surface temperature to that of the deep water below 
Because ocean currents and atmospheric tiansports act to 
smooth out the effects the surface tempeiatuie rise of the 
whole nearby region is greatly reduced In the Southern 
Hemisphere geochemical tracei studies using the same 
global ocean model (Toggweiler ct al 1989) show that the 
most important vertical pathway is associated with the very 
laige, deeply penetrating wind induced downwellmg ]ust 
north of the Antarctic Orcumpolai Current and comp 
ensating upwelling of «.old deep water between thcie and 
the Antaictic continent The effect is likewise to reduce the 
regional temperature rise trom what would otheiwise be the 
global response 
Thus the results described above ol coupling this 
particular ocean and atmosphere GCM aie all qualitatively 
explicable in terms of additional heat being advected as a 
passive tracer by the simulated piesent day ocean 
cnculation in a manner similar to ineit tiansient tracers 
such as tritium 
and CFC s Indeed 
the results are 
consistent with a very simple globally averaged model ol 
the ocean, which involves only a single well mixed suilace 
layei pioviding a lag ol about 10 years and a deep layer 
below of effectively minute heat capacity though this 
model is cleaily not unique 
However this explanation 
is not universally accepted within the occanogiaphic 
188 
Time-Dependent Gi eenhouse-Gas-Induced Climate Change 6 
Flannery (1985) and Schlesinger (1989)] This simple 
climate model determines the global-mean surface 
temperature of the atmosphere and the temperature of the 
ocean as a (unction of depth from the surface to the ocean 
lloor It is assumed that the atmosphere mixes heat 
efficiently between latitudes, so that a single temperature 
rise AT characterizes the surface of the globe, and that the 
incremental radiation to space associated with the response 
to greenhouse gas forcing is proportional to AT The model 
ocean is subdivided vertically into layers, with the 
uppermost being the mixed layer Also, the ocean is 
subdivided horizontally into a small polar region where 
water downwells and bottom water is formed, and a much 
larger nonpolar region where theie is a slow uniform 
vertical upwelling 
In the nonpolai region heat is 
transported upwards toward the surface by the water 
upwelling theie and downwards by physical processes 
whose bulk effects are treated as an equivalent diffusion 
Besides by radiation to space, heat is also removed from 
the mixed layer in the nonpolar region by a transport to the 
polar region and downwelling toward the bottom, this heat 
being ultimately transported upward from the ocean floor 
in the nonpolar region 
In the simple climate/ocean model, five principal 
quantities must be specified 
1) 
the temperature sensitivity of the climate system, 
AT2x characterized by the equilibrium warming 
induced by a CO2 doubling, 
2) 
the vertical profile of the vertical velocity of the 
ocean in the non-polar region, w, 
3) 
the vertical profile of thermal diffusivity in the ocean, 
A, by which the vertical transfer of heat by physical 
processes other than large-scale vertical motion is 
icpresented, 
4) 
the depth of the well-mixed, upper layer of the ocean, 
/;, and 
5) 
the change in downwelled sea surlacc temperature in 
the polar region relative to that in the nonpolar 
region, n

and the latter on the alternate assumption that the polar 
ocean temperature remains at the freezing temperature for 
sea water and therefore does not change For the latter case 
to be applicable, the atmosphere would have to accept the 
additional heat, presumably meaning that the surrounding 
ocean surface temperature would have to be relatively 
substantially warmei than elsewhere at that latitude 
Selecting n = 1, these values of the parameters are used 
for best judgement estimates of global warming in Sections 
8 and 9 The choice is somewhat arbitrary, but the impact 
of uncertainty must be judged against the sensitivity ol the 
conclusions to then values

temperature foi the radiative forcing function used by 
Stouffer et al (1989), with the appropriate atmospheric 
sensitivity AT2x equal to 4°C for a doubling of CCb and a

independently as standaid for best estimate simulations in

various values of atmospheric climate sensitivity AT2X

the slight upward curvature of the response in Figure 6 7, 
due to intermediate time scales of 20-100 years associated 
with heat diffusion or ventilation in the thermochne A 
tangent line fit at the 70 year mark could be described as a 
fractional response that is approximately 55% of the 
instantaneous forcing, with a slope of 66% superimposed 
on an offset of about 11 years For the sense in which the 
terms percentage response and lag are used here see 
Section 6 5 2 
Figure 6 8 shows the simulated inciease in global mean 
temperature for the same radiative forcing but with 
atmospheric models of differing climate sensitivity For a 
sensitivity of 1 5°C for a doubling of CO2 the response 
fraction defined by the tangent line at 70 years is 
approximately 77% ol the instantaneous lorcing with a 
slope of 85% supci imposed on an offset of 6 years 
whereas for 4 5°C the concsponding values arc 52% 63% 
and 12 years

diflerence to changes over several decades The effect of 
varying k between 0 5 and 2 0 cm^ s ' with historical 
forcing has been discussed by Wigley and Raper (1990) If 
k/w is held constant, the realized warming varies over this 
range by about 18% for AT2X = 4 5°C and bv 8% lor AT2X 
= 1 5°C

6.6.3 Discussion 
The model used for these piojections is highly simplified, 
and somewhat different choices could be made of the 
parameters while still retaining consistency with the 
observed average thermochne depth and accepted rates of 
global deep water formation However, the impact ot these 
residual uncertainties on the time-dependent global mean 
climate response is relatively small compared to that 
associated with the cloud-radiation feedback (Figure 6 8) 
Similar models have also been widely used in interpreting 
the observed distribution of geochemical tracers in the 
ocean and for modelling the uptake of CO2 As discussed 
in Section 6 1, the detailed physical basis for a model of 
this type may be questioned, but it yields global average 
results that are apparently not inconsistent with simulations 
using more detailed coupled ocean-atmosphere GCMs 
(Bryan et al , 1984, Schlesinger et al , 1985) Given the 
limited speed of supercomputers available in 1990, it 
remains the only tool available for exploring time-
dependent solutions for a wide range of forcing scenarios 
Thus it is important to appreciate the basic reasons the 
model gives the results it does 
The increased percentage response for low climate 
sensitivities shown in Figure 6 8 is a broadly applicable 
consequence ot the distribution of the prescribed forcing 
into the parallel processes of radiation to space and 
increasing storage in the ocean Treating heat in the ocean 
as a passive tracer, for each process the heat flux at any 
given time is proportional to the teahzed temperature rise 
However, for radiation the constant of proportionality is 
inversely proportional to the climate sensitivity, whereas 
for storage the constant is independent of it Since both 
fluxes are positive, and must add to a fixed value, the 
lorcing, decreasing the climate sensitivity will increase the 
percentage response (though the realized temperature rise 
will increase) This conclusion, though not the storage 
proportionality constant, is unaffected by changing the 
formulation of the storage mechanism in the ocean, 
provided only it can be modelled by a passive tracer 
The difference between each curve in Figure 6 9 and that 
for the equilibrium value at the corresponding time is 
proportional to the rate ol increase of heat stored in the 
oceans, and the area between the curves to the cumulative 
storage Compared to pure diffusion (w = 0), this storage is 
increased by upwelling, provided the additional heat that is 
added, as water rising through the thermochne is bi ought to 
ever higher temperatures at the ocean surface, is then 
retained in the ocean (K = 1) If, on the other hand, that heat 
is lost to the atmosphere before the surface watei in high 
latitudes downwells (71 = 0) then the ocean heat storage is 
reduced, presumably because, once heated, a given parcel 
of water can retain that heat only for a finite time as the 
entire volume of the thermochne is recycled into the deep 
ocean in 150 years or so After correcting foi diflerent

surface temperatures, the difference between these two 
curves measures for the case K = I the effective stoiage in 
the deep ocean below the thermocline, where the re-
circulation time to the surface is many centuries The 
difference between n = 0 and the equilibrium, on the othei 
hand, measures the retention in the surface layers and the 
thermocline Though the latter aica is substantially larger 
than the former, it does not mean that all the heat 
concerned is immediately available to sustain a surface 
temperature rise 
Figure 6 10 shows that within this model with n = 1, if 
the increase in forcing ceases abruptly alter 70 years, only 
40% of the then unrealized global surface tempeiature 
increase is realized within the next 100 years, and most ol 
that occurs in the first 20 years If there is no heat storage 
in the deep ocean this percentage is substantially higher 
It is thus apparent that the interpretation given in Section 
6 5 3 of the results of Stouffer et al (1989) in terms of a 
two-layer box model is not unique However, it is re-
assuring that broadly similar results emerge from an 
upwelling-diffusion model Nevertheless, it is clear that 
further coupled GCM simulations, different analyses of 
experiments already completed, and, above all, more 
definitive observations will be necessary to resolve these 
issues 
6.7 Conclusions 
Coupled ocean atmosphere general circulation models, 
though still of coarse resolution and subject to technical 
problems such as the flux adjustment are providing useful 
insights into the expected climate response due to a time-
dependent radiative forcing However, only a very few 
simulations have been completed at this time and to 
explore the range of scenarios necessary for this assessment 
highly simplified upwelling-diffusion models of the ocean 
must be used instead 
In response to a lorcing that is steadily increasing with 
time, the simulated global use of teinperatuie in both types 
of model is approximately a constant fiaction ol the 
equilibrium rise conesponding to the lorcing at an earlier 
time For an atmosphenc model vwth a tempciatuie 
sensitivity of 4°C loi a doubling ol CO2 this constant is 
appioximately 66% with an oil set of 1 1 years For a 
sensitivity of 1 5°C, the values aie about 85% and 6 years 
respectively Changing the paiameteis in the upwelling 
ditfusion model within ranges supposedly consistent with 
the global distribution of geophysical traccis can change 
the response fraction by up to 20% for the most sensitive 
atmospheric models but by only 10% loi the least sensitive 
Indications from the upwelling diffusion model arc that 
if alter a steady use the lorcing weie to be held steady the 
response would continue to inciease at about the same rate 
for 10 20 years, but thciealtei would inciease only much 
more slowly 
taking several centuries to achieve 
equilibnum This conclusion depends mostly on the ass-
umption that 71 = 1, 1 e , greenhouse wanning in surface 
waters is transported downwards in high latitudes by 
downwelhng or exchange with deep water rather than 
being rejected to the atmosphere, and is thereafter 
sequestered for many centuries Heat storage in the 
thermocline affects the surface temperature on all time-
scales, to some extent even a century or more later 
There is no conclusive analysis of the relative role ol 
diffeient water masses in ocean heat storage foi the GCM 
of Stoufler et al (1990), but there are significant transleis 
of heat into volumes ol intermediate and deep water horn 
which the return time to the surface is many centuries 
Furthci analysis is required ol the implications loi tracer 
distributions of the existing simulations ol the cnculation in 
the control run, for comparison with the upwelling 
diffusion model Likewise, further simulations ol the fully 
interactive coupled GCM with different lorcing functions 
would strengthen confidence in the use ol the simplified 
tracer representation lor studies ol neai teim climate 
change 
A sudden change of lorcing induces tiansient contrasts in 
surface temperature between land and ocean areas 
affecting the distribution ol precipitation Nevertheless the 
regional response pattern for both temperature and 
precipitation of coupled ocean-atmosphere GCMs tor a 
steadily increasing forcing generally resembles that foi an 
equilibrium simulation except uniformly reduced in 
magnitude 
Howevei, both such models with an active 
ocean show an anomalously large reduction in the use ol 
surface temperature around Antarctica and one shows a 
similai reduction in the noithern Noith Atlantic 
These 
anomalous regions aie associated with uipid vertical 
exchanges within the ocean due to convective oveiturning 
01 wind driven upwelling downwelhng 
Coupled ocean-atmosphere GCMs demonstuite an 
inherent interannual vailability, with a significant Iraction 
on decadal and longer timescales It is not clear how 
realistic current simulations ol the statistics of this 
variability really are 
At a given time warming due to 
gieenhouse gas lorcing is largest in high latitudes ol the 
northern hemisphere, but because the natuial vai lability is 
greatei there, the warming first becomes cleaily apparent in 
the tropics 
The major sources ol unceilainty in these conclusions 
arise from inadequate observations to document how the 
piesent ocean circulation really functions Even fully 
mtei active GCMs need mixing parameters that must be 
adjusted ad lux to tit the real ocean and only when the 
processes controlling such mixing aie lull) understood and 
ieflected in the models can there be conlidencc in climate 
simulations under conditions substantially dilleient from 
the present day There is an urgent need to establish an 
192 
Time-Dependent

ed Climate Change 6 
operational system to collect oceanographic observations 
routinely at sites all around the world ocean, 
Present coarse resolution coupled ocean-atmosphere 
general circulation models are yielding results that are 
broadly consistent with existing understanding of the 
general circulation of the ocean and of the atmospheric 
climate system 
With increasing computer power and 
improved data and understanding based upon planned 
ocean observation programs, it may well be possible within 
the next decade to resolve the most serious of the 
remaining technical issues and achieve more realistic 
simulations of the time-dependent coupled 
ocean-
atmosphere system responding to a variety of greenhouse 
forcing scenarios 
Meanwhile, useful estimates of global 
warming under a variety of different forcing scenarios may 
be made using highly simplified 
upwelling-diffusion 
models of the ocean, and with tracer simulations using 
GCM reconstructions of the existing ocean circulation

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
***** There has been a real, but irregular, increase of global 
surface temperature since the late nineteenth century. 
***** There has been a marked, but irregular, recession of the 
majority of mountain glaciers over the same period. 
***** Precipitation has varied greatly in sub-Saharan Africa 
on time scales of decades. 
*** Precipitation has progressively increased in the Soviet 
Union over the last century. 
*** A steady increase of cloudiness of a few percent has 
been observed since 1950 over the USA. 
* A larger, more sudden, but less certain increase of 
cloudiness has been observed over Australia. 
Observational and palaeo-climatic evidence indicates that the 
Earth's climate has varied in the past on time scales ranging from 
many millions of years down to a few years. Over the last two 
million years, glacial-interglacial cycles have occurred on a time 
scale of 100,000 years, with large changes in ice volume and sea 
level. During this time, average global surface temperatures 
appear to have varied by about 5-7°C. Since the end of the last ice 
age, about 10,000 BP, globally averaged surface temperatures 
have fluctuated over a range of up to 2°C on time scales of 
centuries or more. Such fluctuations include the Holocene 
Optimum around 5,000-6,000 years ago. the shorter Medieval 
Warm Period around 1000 AD (which may not have been global) 
and the Little Ice Age which ended only in the middle to late 
nineteenth century. Details are often poorly known because 
palaeo-climatic data are frequently sparse. 
The instrumental record of surface temperatures over the land 
and oceans remains sparse until after the middle of the nineteenth 
century. It is common, therefore, to emphasize trends in the global 
instrumental record from the late nineteenth century. The record 
suggests a global (combined land and ocean) average warming of 
0.45+0.15°C since the late nineteenth century, with an estimated 
small (less than 0.05°C) exaggeration due to urbanisation in the 
land component. The greater part of the global temperature 
increase was measured prior to the mid-1940s. Global warming is 
indicated by three independent data sets: an tempeiatures over 
land, air temperatures over the ocean, and sea surface 
temperatures. The latter two data sets show only a small lag 
compared with land temperatures. A maiked retieat ot mountain 
glaciers in all parts of the world since the end ot the nineteenth 
century provides further evidence ol warming. 
The temperature record of the last 100 years shows significant 
differences in behaviour between the Northern and Southern 
Hemispheres. A cooling of the Northern Hemisphere occurred 
between the 1940s and the early 1970s, while Southern 
Hemisphere temperatures remained nearly constant from the 
1940s to about 1970. Since 1970 in the Southern Hemisphere and 
1975 in the Northern Hemisphere, a more general warming has 
been observed, concentrated into the period 1975-1982, with little 
global warming between 1982 and 1989. However, changes of 
surface temperature in different regions of the two hemispheres 
have shown considerable contrasts for periods as long as decades 
throughout the last century, notably in the Northern Hemisphere 
Over periods as short as a few years, fluctuations ol global or 
hemispheric temperatures of a few tenths ot a degree are 
common. Some of these are related to the El Nino-Southern 
Oscillation phenomenon in the tropical Pacific. Evidence is also 
emerging of decadal time scale variability of ocean circulation 
and deep ocean heat content that is likely to be an important factor 
in climate change. 
It is not yet possible to deduce changes in precipitation on 
global or even hemispheric scales. Some regions have, however, 
experienced real changes over the past few decades. A large 
decline in summer seasonal rainfall has been observed in sub-
Saharan Africa since the 1950s but precipitation appears to have 
increased progressively over the Soviet Union during the last 
century. 
Reliable records of sea-ice and snow are too short to discern 
long-term changes. Systematic changes in the number and 
intensity of tropical cyclones are not apparent, though fluctuations 
may occur on decadal time scales. There is no evidence yet of 
global scale changes in the frequency of extreme tempeiatures 
Increases in cloud cover have been reported from the oceans and 
some land areas Uncertainties in these records are mostly too 
large to allow linn conclusions to be drawn Some of the changes 
are artificial, but increases of cloudiness over the USA and 
Australia over the last forty years may be real. 
We conclude that despite great limitations in the quantity and 
quality of the available historical temperature data, the evidence 
points consistently to a real but irregular warming over the last 
century. A global warming of larger size has almost certainly 
occurred at least once since the end of the last glaciation without 
any appieciable increase in greenhouse gases. Because we do not 
understand the reasons for these past warming events it is not yet 
possible to attribute a specific proportion ol the recent, smaller, 
warming to an increase of greenhouse gases.

7.1 Introduction 
This Section focuses on changes and variations in the 
modern climate record To gain a longer term perspective 
and to provide a background to the discussion of the 
palaeo-analogue forecasting technique in Section 3, 
variations in palaeo-chmate are also described Analyses of 
the climate record can provide important information about 
natural climate variations and variability 
A major 
difficulty in using observed records to make deductions 
about changes resulting from recent increases in 
greenhouse gases (Sections 1 and 2) is the existence of 
natural climatic forcing factors that may add to, or subtract 
from, such changes Unforced internal variability of the 
climate system will also occur further obscuring any signal 
induced by greenhouse gases 
Observing the weather, and converting weather data to 
information about climate and climate change is a very 
complex endeavour Virtually all our information about 
modern climate has been derived from measurements 
which were designed to monitor weather rather than 
climate change Even greatei difficulties arise with the 
proxy data (natural iecords of climate sensitive 
phenomena, mainly pollen remains, lake varves and ocean 
sediments, insect and animal lemains glacier termini) 
which must be used to deduce the chaiactenstics of climate 
before the modern instrumental period began So special 
attention is given to a critical discussion ol the quality of 
the data on climate change and vailability and our 
confidence in making deductions from these data Note that 
we have not made much use of several kinds ot proxy data, 
for example tree ring data, that can provide information on 
climate change over the last millennium We recognise that 
these data have an increasing potential howevei their 
indications are not yet sufficiently easy to assess nor 
sufficiently integrated with indications from other data to 
be used in this report 
A brief discussion of the basic concepts of climate 
climate change, climate trends etc togethei with references 
to material containing more precise definitions of terms, is 
found in the Introduction at the beginning ot this Repoit 
7.2 Palaeo-Climatic Variations and Change 
7.2.7 Climate Of The Past 5,000,000 Years 
Climate varies naturally on all time scales from hundreds 
of millions of years to a few years Prominent in recent 
Earth's history have been the 100,000 year Pleistocene 
glacial-interglacial cycles when climate was mostly cooler 
than at present (Imbne and Imbne 1979) This period 
began about 2,000,000 yeais belorc the picscnt time (BP) 
and was preceded by a waimcr epoch having only limited 
glaciation, mainly over Antarctica called the Pliocene 
Global surface temperatures have typically vaned b> 5-7 C 
through the Pleistocene ice age cycles with large changes 
in ice volume and sea level, and temperature variations as 
great as 10-15°C in some middle and high latitude regions 
of the Northern Hemisphere Since the beginning ol the 
current interglacial epoch about 10 000 BP global 
temperatures have fluctuated within a much smaller range 
Some fluctuations have nevertheless lasted several 
centuries, including the Little Ice Age which ended in the 
nineteenth century and which was global in extent 
Proxy data clearly indicate that the Earth emerged from 
the last ice age 10,000 to 15,000 BP (Figure 7 I) During 
this glacial period continental size ice sheets covered 
much of North America and Scandinavia and world sea 
level was about 120m below present values An important 
cause of the recurring glaciations is believed to be 
variations in seasonal radiation receipts in the Northern 
Hemisphere These variations are due to small changes in 
the distance ot the Earth from the sun in given seasons and 
slow changes in the angle of the tilt of the Earths axis 
which affects the amplitude of the seasonal insolation 
These Milankovitch orbital effects (Berger, 1980) appear 
to be correlated with the glacial-interglacial cycle since 
glacials arise when solar radiation is least in the 
extratiopical Northern Hemisphere summer 
Variations in carbon dioxide and methane in ice age 
cycles aie also very important lactors, they served to 
modify and perhaps amplify the other forcing effects (sec 
Section 1) However, there is evidence that rapid changes 
in climate have occurred on time scales ol about a century 
which cannot be directly related to orbital foicing oi to 
changes in atmospheric composition The most diamatic of 
these events was the Youngei Diyas cold episode which 
involved an abrupt reversal of the general warming trend in 
progiess aiound 10 500 BP as the last episode of 
continental glaciation came to a close The Youngei Dryas 
was an event of global significance it was cleaily observed 
in New Zealand (Salingei 1989) though its influence may 
not have extended to all parts of the globe (Rind et al 
1986) There is as yet no consensus on the reasons for this 
climatic reversal which lasted about 500 years and ended 
veiy suddenly However because the signal was strongest 
around the North Atlantic Ocean suggestions have been 
made that the climatic reversal had its physical origin in 
large changes in the sea surface temperature (SST) ot the 
North Atlantic Ocean One possibility is that the cooling 
may have resulted from reduced deep watei pioduction in 
the Noith Atlantic following large scale melting of the 
Lauicntide Ice sheet and the icsulting influx of huge 
amounts of low density freshwater into the northein Noith 
Atlantic ocean (Broecker et al 
1985) Consequential 
changes in the global oceanic circulation may have 
occuned (Sticet Penott and Perrott 1990) which ma> ha\c 
nnohed variations in the strength of the thcimohaiine

Obsc nccl Climate Vai union and Change 7 
emulation in the Atlantic This closed oceanic emulation 
involves northward flow of water near the ocean surface 
sinking in the sub-Arctic and a return flow at depth The 
relevance of the Younger Dryas to today s conditions is that 
it is possible that changes in the theimohalme circulation of 
a qualitatively similar character might occur quite quickly 
dunng a warming of the climate induced by greenhouse 
gases 
A possible trigger might be an increase of 
precipitation over the extiatropical Noith Atlantic 
(Brocekcr, 1987), though the changes in ocean circulation 
are most likely to be considerably smallei than in the 
Younger Dryas Section 6 gives further details 
The period since the end of the last glaciation has been 
characterized by small changes in global average 
temperature with a range of probably less than 2°C (Figure 
7 1), though it is still not clear whethci all the fluctuations 
indicated were truly global However, large regional

since the Pleistocene on three time scales (a) the last million

years The dotted line nominally represents conditions near the 
beginning of the twentieth century 
changes in hydrological conditions have occurred, par-
ticularly in the tropics Wetter conditions in the Sahara 
from 12 000 to 4,000 yeais BP enabled cultural groups to 
survive by hunting and fishing in what are today almost the 
most and regions on Earth During this time Lake Chad 
expanded to become as large as the Caspian Sea is today 
(several hundred thousand km^. Grove and Warren, 1968) 
Drier conditions became established after 4,000 BP and 
many former lake basins became completely dry (Street-
Perrot and Harnson 1985) Pollen sequences from lake 
beds of northwest India suggest that periods with subdued 
monsoon activity existed during the recent glacial 
maximum (Singh etal 
1974) but the epoch 8,000 to 2,500 
BP experienced a humid climate with frequent floods 
There is giowing evidence that worldwide temperatures 
weie highei than at piesent during the mid-Holocene 
(especially 5 000-6 000 BP), at least in summer, though 
carbon dioxide levels appear to have been quite similar to 
those of the pre-mdustnal era at this time (Section 1 i Thus 
parts <si western Euiope China, Japan, the eastern USA 
were a few degrees warmer in July during the mid-
Holocene than in recent decades (Yoshino and Urushibara, 
1978, Webb ct al 
1987, Huntley and Prentice, 1988, 
Zhang and Wang 1990) Parts of Australasia and Chile 
were also waimei The late tenth to early thirteenth 
centuries (about AD 950-1250) appear to have been 
exceptionally warm in western Europe, Iceland and 
Greenland (Alexandre 1987, Lamb, 1988) This period is 
known as the Medieval Climatic Optimum China was, 
however, cold at this time (mainly in winter) but South 
Japan was warm (Yoshino, 1978) This period of 
widespread warmth is notable in that there is no evidence 
that it was accompanied by an increase of greenhouse 
gases 
Cooler episodes have been associated with glacial 
advances in alpine regions of the world, such neo-glacial' 
episodes have been increasingly common in the last few 
thousand years Of particulai interest is the most recent 
cold event, the Little Ice Age , which resulted in extensive 
glacial advances in almost all alpine regions of the world 
between 150 and 450 years ago (Grove, 1988) so that 
glaciers were more extensive 100-200 years ago than now 
nearly everywhere (Figure 7 2) Although not a period of 
continuously cold climate, the Little Ice Age was probably 
the coolest and most globally extensive cool period since 
the Younger Dryas In a few regions, alpine glaciers 
advanced down-valley even further than during the last 
glaciation (tor example, Miller, 1976) Some have argued 
that an increase in explosive volcanism was responsible for 
the coolness (for example Hammer, 1977, Porter, 1986), 
others claim a connection between glacier advances and 
reductions in solar activity (Wigley and Kelly, 1989) such 
as the Maunder and Sporer solar activity minima (Eddy, 
1976), but see also Pittock (1983) At present, there is no

Little Ice Age came to an end only in the nineteenth

could be a recovery from the Little Ice Age rather than a 
direct result of human activities So it is important to 
recognise that natural variations of climate are appreciable 
and will modulate any future changes induced by man

Analogues from 
Three 
Warm 
Epochs 
Thiee periods from the past have been suggested by 
Budyko and Izrael (1987) as analogues of a iuture warm 
climate For the second and third periods listed below, 
however, it can be argued that the changed seasonal 
distribution of incoming solar radiation existing at those 
times may not necessarily have produced the same climate 
as would lesult from a globally-averaged increase in 
greenhouse gases

penod by scientists in the USSR Many types ot proxy data 
weic used to develop temperature and precipitation patterns 
over the land masses of the Northern Hemisphere (Budyko 
and I/rael 1987) Over the oceans, the main sources of 
information were cores drilled in the bed of the deep ocean 
by the American Deep sea Ocean Core Drilling Project 
Some ol these reconstructions are shown in Figure 7 3a 
and b 
Figure 7 3a suggests that mid-latitude Northern 
Hemisphere summer temperatures averaged about 3-4°C 
higher than present-day values Atmospheric concen-
trations of caibon dioxide are estimated by Budyko et al 
(1985) to have been near 600 ppm, I e twice as large as 
immediately pre industrial values Howevei Bemer et al 
(1983) show lower carbon dioxide concentrations So there 
is some doubt about the extent to which atmospheric 
caibon dioxide concentrations were higher than present 
values during the Pliocene Figure 7 3b is a partial re 
construction of Northern Hemisphere annual precipitation, 
this was generally greater during the Pliocene Of special 
interest is increased annual precipitation in the and regions 
ot Middle Asia and Northern Africa where temperatures 
were lower than at present in summer 
Unceitainties associated with the interpretation of these 
reconstiuctions are considerable and include 
1) 
Imprecise dating of the records, especially those from 
the continents (uncertainties of 100,000 years or 
more), 
2) 
Differences from the present day surface geography, 
including changes in topography thus Tibet was at 
least 1000m lower than now and the Greenland ice 
sheet may have been much smaller, 
3) 
The ecology of life on Earth from which many of the 
proxy data are derived was significantly different

Eimum mteiqlacial optimum (125 000 130 000 
\cai\BP) 
Palaco-botanic oxygen-isotope and other geological data 
show that the climates of the warmest parts of some of the 
Pleistocene interglacials were considerably warmer (1 to 
2°C) than the modern climate They have been considered 
as analogues ot future climate (Budyko and Izrael, 1987, 
Zubakov and Borzenkova, 1990) Atmospheric carbon 
dioxide reached about 300 ppm during the Eemian 
optimum (Section 1) but a more important cause of the 
warmth may have been that the eccentricity of the Earth s 
orbit around the sun was about twice the modern value, 
giving markedly more radiation in the northern hemisphere 
summer The last mterglacial optimum (125 000 130 000 
>ears BP) has sufficient information (Vehchko U al 1982 
1983 1984 and CLIMAP 1984) to allow quantitative 
reconstructions to be made of annual and seasonal air

temperature and annual precipitation for part of the 
Northern Hemisphere For the Northern Hemisphere as a 
whole, mean annual surface air temperature was about 2°C 
above its immediately pre-industnal value Figure 7 4 
shows differences of summer air temperature, largest (by 4-
8°C) in northern Siberia, Canada and Greenland 
Over 
most of the USSR and Westein Europe north of 50-60°N, 
temperatures were about 1-3°C warmer than present South 
of these areas temperatures were similar to those of today, 
and precipitation was substantially larger over most parts of 
the continents of the Northern Hemisphere In individual 
regions of Western Europe the north of Eurasia and Soviet 
Central Asia and Kazakhstan annual precipitation has been 
estimated to have been 30-50% higher than modern values 
It is difficult to assess quantitatively the uncertainties 
associated with these climate reconstructions 
The 
problems include 
1) 
Variations between the timing of the deduced thermal 
maximum in different records, 
2) 
The difficulties of obtaining proxy data in and areas, 
3) 
The absence of data from North America and many 
other continental regions in both Hemispheres 
7 22 3 Climate of the Holoc ene Optimum (5 000-6 000 
\eaisBP) 
The Early and Middle Holocene was characterized by a 
relatively warm climate with summer temperatures in high 
northern latitudes about 3 4°C above modern values 
Between 9 000 and 5 000 years BP, there were several 
7 Observed Climate Variation and Change 
short-lived warm epochs, the last of which, the mid 
Holocene optimum, lasted trom about 6,200 to 5,300 years 
BP (Varushchenko et al., 1980). Each warm epoch was 
accompanied by increased precipitation and higher lake 
levels in subtropical and high latitudes (Singh et al., 1974; 
Swain et al., 1983). However, the level of such mid-latitude 
lakes as the Caspian Sea, Lake Geneva and the Great Basin 
lakes in the USA was lowered (COHMAP, 1988; 
Borzenkova and Zubakov, 1984). 
Figures 7.5a and b show maps of summer surface air 
temperature (as departures from immediately pre-industrial 
values) and annual precipitation for the mid-Holocene 
optimum in the Northern Hemisphere. This epoch is

sometimes used as an analogue of expected carly-21 st 
century climate. The greatest relative warmth in summer 
(up to 4°C) was in high latitudes north ot 70°N (Lo/hkin 
and Vazhenin, 1987). In middle latitudes, summer 
temperatures were only 1-2°C higher and fuither south 
summer temperatures were olten lowei than today, loi 
example in Soviet Central Asia, the Sahaia. and Aiabia. 
These areas also had increased annual precipitation. Annual 
precipitation was about 50-100 mm higher than at present 
206 
Observed Climate Variation and Change 7 
in the Northern regions of Eurasia and Canada but in 
central regions of Western Europe and in southern regions 
of the European USSR and West Siberia there were small 
decreases of annual precipitation. The largest decrease in 
annual precipitation took place in the USA, especially in 
central and eastern regions (COHMAP, 1988). 
The above reconstructions are rather uncertain; thus 
Figure 7.5a disagrees with reconstructions of temperature 
over north east Canada given by Bartlein and Webb (1985). 
However the accuracy of reconstructions is increasing as 
more detailed information for individual regions in both 
hemispheres becomes available. For instance, the 
CLIMANZ project has given quantitative estimates of 
Holocene temperature and precipitation in areas from New 
Guinea to Antarctica for selected times (Chappell and 
Grindrod, 1983). Detailed mid-Holocene reconstructions of 
summer temperature in Europe and China are shown in 
Figure 7.5c. 
7.3 The Modern Instrumental Record 
The clearest signal of an enhanced greenhouse effect in the 
climate system, as indicated by atmosphere/ocean general 
circulation models, would be a widespread, substantial 
increase of near-surface temperatures. This section gives 
special attention to variations and changes of land surface 
air temperatures (typically measured at about two metres 
above the ground surface) and sea surface temperatures 
(SSTs) since the mid-nineteenth century. Although earlier 
temperature, precipitation, and surface pressure data are 
available (Lamb, 1977), spatial coverage is very poor. We 
focus on changes over the globe and over the individual 
hemispheres but considerable detail on regional space 
scales is also given.

7.4 Surface Temperature Variations and Change 
7.4 1 Hemispheric and Global 
74 11 Land 
Three reseaich groups (Jones et al 
1986a,b, Jones, 1988, 
Hansen and Lebedefl, 1987, 1988, and Vinnikov et al , 
1987, 1990) have produced similar analyses of hemispheric 
land surface air temperature vanations (Figure 7 6) from 
bioadly the same data All three analyses indicate that 
during the last decade globally-averaged land temperatures 
have been higher than in any decade in the past 100 to 140 
years (The smoothed lines in Figure 7 6, as tor all the 
longer time series shown in this Section, are pioduced by a 
low pass binomial filter with 21 tenns operating on the 
annual data The filtei passes fluctuations having a period 
of 20 years or more almost unattenuatcd) 
Figure 7 6 shows that tempcratuie increased from the 
relatively cool late nineteenth centuiy to the relatively 
warm 1980s, but the pattern of change differed between the 
two hemispheres 
In the Northern Hemisphere the 
temperature changes over land aie nregular and an abrupt 
warming of about 0 3°C appears to have occurred duiing 
the early 1920s This climatic discontinuity has been 
pointed out by Ellsaesser et al (1986) in their inteipretation 
of the thermometnc iecoid 
Northern Hcmispheie 
temperatures prior to the climatic discontinuity in the 1920s 
could be interpreted as var>ing about a stationary mean 
climate as shown by the smoothed curve The nearest 
approach to a monotonic trend in the Noithern Hemisphcie 
time series is the dcciease ol tempcratuie horn the late 
1930s to the mid-1960s of about 0 2°C The most iecenl 
warming has been dominated by a relatively sudden 
increase of nearly 0 3°C over less than ten years belorc 
1982 Of course, it is possible to fit a monotonic trend line 
to the entire time senes such a tiend fitted to the curient 
version of the Jones (1988) data gives a iate ol wanning of 
0 53°C/100 years when the trend is calculated from 1881 to 
1989 or the reduced if less reliable value of 0 4VC/I00 
years if it is calculated from 1861 Clearl) this is a gross 
oversimplification ol the obsened vanations even though 
the computed hneai trends aie highly significant in a 
statistical sense 
The data for the Southern Hemisphcie include the 
Antarctic land mass since 19^7 except for the data ol 
Vinnikov et al 
(1987 
1990) 
Like the Northern 
Hemisphere, the climate appeal s stationaiy thioughout the 
latter half of the nineteenth century and into the early part 
of the twentieth centuiy Subsequently thcic is an upward 
trend in the data until the late 1930s but in the next three 
decades the mean tempcratuie iemains essentially 
stationary again 
A fairly steady inciease ol temperature 
resumes before 1970 though it may have slowed iecently 
Linear trends for the Southern Hemisphcie are 0 ^2 C/100 
years from 1881 to 1989 but somewhat less and less 
reliable, at 0 45°C/100 yeais loi ihepenod 1861 1989 
The interpretation of the rise in tempciature shown in 
Figure 7 6 is a key issue foi global waimmg so the 
accuracy ol these data needs careful consideiation A 
number of problems may have affected the record 
discussed in turn below 
1) 
Spatial coverage of the data is incomplete and varies 
greatly, 
2)

Canadian Arctic and the tropics of South Amcnca In the

and much of Noith America is not coveied The effect of 
this drastically changing spatial coverage on hemisphenc

Remarkably then analysis using a Iro/en grid

tor the combined land and ocean data) suggests that 
changes ol station density since 1900 have had iclatnel) 
little impact on estimates ol hemispheric land tempciature 
anomalies However pnoi to 1900 the decadal uncertainty 
could be up to 0 1°C This is quite small iclative to the 
overall change Thus varying data coveiage does not seem 
to have had a serious impact on the magnitude ol the

Another potential bias arises liom changes in 
observation schedules Even today there is no international 
standaid for the calculation of mean daily tempeialuie 
Thus each country calculates mean daily tempcratuie by a 
method of its choice such as the aveiage ol the maximum

existing global data sets, but some have not. These biases 
can be significant; in the USA a systematic change in 
observing times has led to a nominal 0.2°C decrease of 
temperature in the climate record since the 1930s (Karl et 
al., 1986). The effects of changing observation time have 
only been partly allowed for in the USA temperature data 
used in analyses presented here. So an artificial component 
of cooling of rather less than 0.2°C may exist in the USA 
part of the temperature analyses for this reason, offsetting 
the warming effects of increasing urbanisation in that 
country. Artificial changes of temperature of either sign 
may exist in other parts of the world due to changes in 
observation time but have not been investigated. 
Substantial systematic changes in the exposure of 
thermometers have occurred. Because thermo-melers can 
be affected by the direct rays of the sun, reflected solar 
radiation, extraneous heat sources and precipitation, there 
has been a continuous effort to improve their exposures 
over the last 150 years. Additional biases must accompany 
these changes in the thermometric record. Since many of 
the changes in exposure took place during the nineteenth 
and early twentieth centuries, that part of the record is most 
likely to be affected. Recently, Parker (1990) has reviewed 
the earlier thermometer exposures, and how they evolved, 
in many different countries. The effects of exposure 
changes vary regionally (by country) and seasonally. Thus 
tropical temperatures prior to the late 1920s appear to be 
too high because of the placement of thermometers in 
cages situated in open sheds. There is also evidence that 
for the mid-latitudes prior to about 1880 summer 
temperatures may be too high and winter temperatures too 
low due to the use of poorly screened exposures. This 
includes the widespread practice of exposing thermometers 
on the north walls of buildings. These effects have not yet 
been accounted for in existing analyses (see Section 
7.4.2.2).

Changes in station environment can seriously affect 
temperature records (Salinger, 1981) Over the years, 
stations often have minor (usually under 10 km) lelocations 
and some stations have been moved from rooftop to giound 
level Even today, international practice allows for a 
variation of thermometer heights above ground from 1 25 
to 2 metres Because large vertical temperature giadients 
exist near the ground, such changes could senously affect 
thermometer records When lelocations occur in a random 
manner, they do not have a serious impact on hemisphenc 
or global temperature anomalies, though they nnpaii our 
ability to develop information about much smaller scale 
temperature variations A bias on the large scale can 
emerge when the character of the changes is not random 
An example is the systematic relocations of some 
observing stations from inside cities in many countries to 
more rural airport locations that occuired several decades 
ago Because of the heat island effect within cities such 
moves tend to introduce aitificial cooling into the climate 
record Jones et al (1986a, b) attempt in some detail to 
adjust for station relocations when these appear to have 
introduced a significant bias in the data but Hansen and 
Lebedeff (1988) do not believing that such station moves 
cancel out over large time and space averages Vinnikov et 
al (1990) do adjust for some of these moves Theie arc 
several possible correction procedures that have been or 
could be, applied to the Jones (1988) data set (Bradley and 
Jones, 1985, Karl and Williams 1987) All depend on 
denser networks ol stations than are usually available 
except in the USA Euiopc the Western Soviet Union and 
a few other areas 
01 the above problems incicasing urbanisation around 
fixed stations is the most senous source of systematic cnoi 
for hemispheric land tcmpciatuie time series that has so far 
been identified A number of reseaicheis have tned to 
ascertain the impact of uibamsation on the tempeiatuie 
record Hansen and Lebedeff (1987) found that when they 
removed all stations having a population in 1970 of greatei 
than 100,000, the tiend of tempeiatuie was ieduced by 
0 \°C over 100 yeais They speculated that peihaps an 
additional 0 1°C of bias might remain due to incieases in 
urbanisation around stations in smallei cities and towns 
Jones et al (1989) estimate that the effect of uibamsation 
in then quahty-contiolled data is no more than 0 1°C ovei 
the past 100 yeais This conclusion is based on a 
comparison of then data with a dense network of mostly 
rural stations over the USA Groisman and Koknaeva 
(1990) compare the data from Vinnikov et al (1990) with 
the lural American data set and with ruial stations in the 
Soviet Union and find veiy small warm lelative biases of 
less than 0 05°C pei 100 yeais In the USA Kail et al 
(1988) find that incieases due to uibamsation can be 
significant 
(0 1°C), even when uiban aieas have 
populations as low as 10 000 Othei aieas of the globe aie 
now being studied Preliminary results indicate that the 
effects of urbanisation are highly regional and time 
dependent Changes in urban warming in China (Wang ei 
al , 1990) appear to be quite laige over the past decade, but 
in Australia they are rathei less than is observed in the 
USA (Coughlan et al , 1990) Recently Jones and co 
workers (paper in preparation) have compared tiends 
derived from their quality-controlled data and those ol 
Vinnikov et al (1990), with specially selected data fiom 
more rural stations in the USSR, eastern China, and 
Australia When compared with trends fiom the moie ruial 
stations only small (positive) differences of tempeiaturc 
trend exist in the data used in Jones (1988) and Vinnikov et 
al (1990) in Austialia and the USSR (of magnitude less 
than 0 0VC/100 years) In eastern China the data used by 
Vinnikov et al (1990) and Jones (1988) give smaller 
warming trends than those derived fiom the moie rural 
stations This is an unexpected result It suggests that eithei 
(1) the moie iural set is sometimes affected by urbanisation 
or, (2) othei changes in station chaiactenstics ovei 
compensate for uiban warming bias Thus it is known that 
the effects of biases due to increased urbanisation in the 
Hansen and Lebedeff (1987) and the Vinnikov et al (1990) 
data sets are partly offset by the artificial cooling 
introduced by the movement of stations from city centres to 
more rural an port locations during the 1940s to 1960s 
(Karl and Jones 1990) Despite this, some of these new 
ruial airpoit locations may have suffered recently from 
increasing urbanisation 
In light of this evidence, the estimate provided by Jones 
et al (1989) of a maximum overall wanning bias in all 
three land data sets due to urbanisation of 0 1 "C/100 years 
or less is plausible but not conclusive

Figure 7.8: Sea surface temperature anomalies 1861 1989, relative to 1951 1980 Annual values (bars) and solid curves from UK 
Meteorological Office data Dashed curves from Farmer et al (1989) (a) Northern Hemisphere (b) Southern Hemisphere 
Long-term variations of SSTs over the two hemispheres, 
shown in Figure 7 8, have been, in general, similar to their 
land counterparts The increase in temperature has not been 
continuous There is evidence for a fairly rapid cooling in 
SST of about 0 1 to 0 2°C at the beginning of the twentieth 
century in the Northern Hemisphere This is believed to be 
real because night marine air temperatures show a slightly 
larger cooling The cooling strongly affected the North 
Atlantic, especially after 1903 and is discussed at length 
by Helland-Hansen and Nansen (1920) The cool period 
was terminated by a rapid rise in temperature starting after 
1920 This resembled the sudden warming of land 
temperatures, but lagged it by several years Subsequent 
cooling from the late 1950s to about 1975 lagged that over 
land by about five years, and was followed by renewed 
warming with almost no lag compared with land data 
Overall warming of the Northern Hemisphere oceans since 
the late nineteenth century appears to have been slightly 
smaller than that of the land (Figure 7 8a) and may not 
have exceeded 0 3°C 
In the Southern Hemisphere ocean (remembering that 
the Southern Ocean has always been poorly measured) 
there appear to have been two distinct stable climatic 
periods the first lasting until the late 1920s the second 
lasting from the mid 1940s until the early 1960s Since the 
middle 1970s SSTs in the Southern Hemisphere have 
continued to rise to their highest levels of record Overall 
warming has certainly exceeded 0 3°C since the nineteenth 
century, but has probably been less than 0 5°C (Figure 
7 8b), and has been slightly less than the warming of the 
land However if the increases of temperature are 
measured from the time of their minimum values around 
1910, the warming of the oceans has been slightly larger 
than that of the land Despite data gaps over the Southern 
Ocean, the global mean ocean temperature variations 
(Figure 7 9) tend to take on the characteristics of the 
Southern Hemisphere because a larger area of ocean is 
often sampled in the Southern Hemisphere than the 
Northern Hemisphere Overall warming in the global 
oceans between the late nineteenth century and the latter 
hall of the twentieth century appears to have been about 
0 4°C 
Significant differences between the two SST data sets 
presented in Figure 7 8 result mainly from differing 
assumptions concerning the correction of SST data for 
instrumental biases The biases arose chiefly from changes 
in the method of sampling the sea water for temperature 
measurement Several different types of bucket have been 
used for sampling made for example, of wood, canvas, 
rubber or metal but the largest bias arose from an 
apparently rather sudden transition from various un 
insulated buckets to ship engine intake tubes in World War 
II A complex correction procedure developed by Folland 
and Parker (1989) and Bottomley et al (1990) which

Figure 7.9: Global sea surface, night marine air (crosses) and land air temperature anomalies (dots) 1861-1989, relative to 1951-80 
Sea surface temperatures are values from Farmer et al (1989) (solid line) and the UK Meteorological Office (dashed line) Night 
marine air temperatures from UK Meteorological Office Land air temperatures are equally weighted averages of data from Jones, 
Hansen and Lebedeff, and Vinnikov et al 
creates geographically varying corrections, has been also 
been used in nearly the same form by Farmer et al 
Differences in the two data sets remain, however, primarily 
because of different assumptions about the mix of wooden 
versus canvas buckets used during the nineteenth century 
Despite recommendations by Maury (1858) to use wooden 
buckets with the thermometer inserted toi tour to live 
minutes, such buckets may have been much less used in 
practice (Toynbee, 1874, correspondence with the Danish 
Meteorological Seivicc, 1989) possibly because of damage 
iron-banded wooden buckets could inflict upon the hulls of 
ships Some differences also result even as recently as the 
1970s, because the data aie not always denved from 
identical sources (Woodruff 1990) 
No corrections have been applied to the SST data from 
1942 to date Despite published discussions about the 
differences between bucket and engine intake SST data 
in this period (for example James and Fox 1972) there arc 
several reasons why it is believed that no tuithcr 
corrections, with one leseivation noted below aie needed 
Firstly the anomalies in Figure 7 8 aie calculated hom the 
mean conditions in 1951 1980 So onl> relati\e changes in 
the mix of data since 1942 arc important Secondly many 
ol the modern ' buckets aie insulated (Folland and Paiker 
1990) so that they cool much less than canvas buckets A 
comparison of about two million bucket and foui million 
engine intake data foi 1975-1981 (Bottomley et al 1990) 
reveals a global mean diffeiencc ot only 0 08°C the engine 
intake data being the warmer Thus a substantial change in 
the mix of data types (cuirently about 25 MY/c buckets) 
must occur before an appieciable aitiliual change will 
occui in Figure 7 8 This conclusion is stiongl) suppoited 
by the gicat similanty between tunc senes of globally-
aveiagcd anomalies ol colocated SST and night mannc air 
temperature data Irom 1955 to date (not shown) Less 
perfect agreement between 1946 and the early 1950s (SST 
colder) suggests that uninsulated bucket SST data may 
have been more numerous then than in 1951-80, yielding 
an overall cold bias of up to 0 1 °C on a global average 
Marine air temperatures are a valuable test of the 
accuracy of SSTs after the early 1890s Biases ot day-time 
marine air temperatures are so numerous and ditficult to 
overcome that only night time marine air temperatures 
have been used The biases arise during the day because 
overheating of the thermometers and screens by solai 
insolation has changed as ships have changed their physical 
characteristics (Folland et al 
1984) On the other hand 
appreciable biases ot night time data are currently believed 
to be confined to the nineteenth century and much ol the 
Second Woild Wai Night marine an tcmpcratuies have 
been found to be much too high relative to SST oi to 
modem values in certain legions and seasons before 1894 
(Bottomley et al 1990) These values weie collected using 
SSTs but subsequently (except in 1941 1945) night marine 
air tempeiature data constitute independent evidence 
everywhere although corrections are also made lor the 
increasing heights of ship decks (Bottomle) et al 
1990) 
Figure 7 9 indicates that multi decadal global variations of 
corrected night time marine air temperature ha\c been 
quite similar to those of SST To provide a complete 
pictuie, Figuic 7 9 shows the Farmei et al and UK 
Meteorological Office global SST curves separately along 
with a global land an temperatuie senes cieated by 
avciaging the series ot Jones Hansen and Lebedclf and 
Vinnikov et al Both SST and night marine an tempeiature 
data appear to lag the land data b> at least five >eais during 
the period of wanning tiom 1920 to the 1940s Hovve\ei 
some of the apparent warmth of the land at this time ma\ 
be erroneous due to the use ol open shed screens in the 
tiopics (Section 7 4 11) 
212 
Obsc i \ ed Climate Vai mtion and Change 7 
The above results ditter appreciably in the nineteenth 
centuiy liom those published by Ooit et al (1987) who 
followed the much less detailed correction piocedure ol 
Folland et al (1984) to adjust the COADS SST and all 
hours marine air temperature data sets Newell et al 
(1989) also present an analysis quite similar to that of the 
above authors, based on a UK Meteorological Office data 
set that was current in early 1988 All these authors obtain 
higher values of global SST and marine air tcmpciature in 
the middle to late nineteenth century typically by about 
0 1°C and 0 15°C respectively than arc indicated in this 
report It is oui best judgement that the moie iecent 
analyses repiesent a real improvement 
but the 
discrepancies highlight the uncertainties in the mtei 
pi elation of eaily marine tempeiatuie iccords Yamamoto 
et al (1990a) have tried to quantify changing biases in the 
COADS all hours marine air tempeiatuie data using a 
mixture of weather ship air tempeiatuie data liom the 
1940s to 1970s and selected land an temperatuie data 
mainly in three tropical coastal legions to calculate time 
varying corrections Based on these corrections Yamamoto 
et al (1990b) calculate a global air tempeiatuie anomaly 
curve loi 1901-1986 of similai oveiall chaiactei to the 
night manne air temperature cuive in Figuie 7 9 but with 
typically 0 15°C warmer anomalies in the eaily pan of the 
twentieth centuiy, and typically 0 1°C coolci anomalies in 
the wann period around 1940 1950 Recent data are 
similar 
It could be argued that the collections of 
Yamamoto et al may be influenced by biases in the land 
data including waim biases arising from the use of tropical 
open sheds earlier this century Warm biases may also exist 
in some ocean weather ship day-time air tempeiatuie data 
(Folland 1971) Although we believe that the night marine 
an tcmpciature analysis in Figuie 7 9 minimises the known 
sources of error the work ot Yamamoto et al undei lines 
the level of uncertainty that exists in tiends derived from 
manne an temperature data 
74 11 Land and sea combined 
Combined land and sea surface temperatures show a 
significant increase of temperature Irom the late nineteenth 
to the late twentieth century (Figures 7 10a to c) These 
data aie an average of two data sets a combination of the 
Jones land data and the Farmer et al SST data and a 
combination of the Jones land data and the UK 
Meteorological Office SST data Note that the relative 
contributions of land and sea to the combined data have 
vaned according to changing data availability over land 
and ocean (bottom ot Figure 7 10c) Over the globe the 
combined data gives an increase ot temperature of 0 45°C 
between the average for the two decades 1881-1900 and 
the decade 1980 89 The comparable incieasc for the 
Noithein Hcmisphcie is 0 42 C and tor the Southern 
Hemisphere 0 48°C A similai calculation foi the changes 
of temperatuie between 1861-1880 and 1980 89 gives 
0 45°C (H8°C and 0 5VC icspectively A linear trend 
htted between 1890 and 1989 gives values of 0 50°C/100 
years (globe) 0 47°C/100 yeais (Northern Hemisphere) and 
0 5VC/100 years (Southern Hemisphere), a linear trend 
fitted between 1870 and 1989 gives the reduced values of 
0 41°C 0 19°C and 0 4VC/100 years respectively 
Appaient decadal rates of change of smoothed global 
combined temperature have varied from an increase of 
0 21°C between 1975 and 1985 (largely between 1975 and 
1981) to a decrease of 0 19°C between 1898 and 1908 
(though data coveiagc was quite poor around 1900) 
Surpnsingly the maximum magnitudes of decadal change 
(warming or cooling) ovei land and ocean (SST) have been 
quite similai (Figure 7 9) at about 0 25°C Smoothed night 
global marine air temperature showed the largest apparent 
change aiound 1900 with a maximum cooling of 0 32°C 
between 1898 and 1908 though this value is very 
unccitain 
Combined land and ocean temperatuie has increased 
rather diffeiently in the Noithem than in the Southern 
Hemisphere (Figuie 7 10) A rapid increase in Northern 
Hemisphere temperature during the 1920s and into the 
1910s contiasts with a more gradual increase in the 
Southern Hcmisphcie Both hemispheres had relatively 
stable tempei attires trom the 1940s to the 1970s though 
with some evidence of cooling in the Northern 
Hemisphere Since the 1960s in the Southern Hemisphere, 
but altei 1975 in the Northern Hemisphere temperatures 
have risen with the oveiall use being more pronounced in 
the Southern Hemisphere Only a small overall rise was 
observed between 1982 and 1989 
An important pioblcm concerns the varying spatial 
coverage of the combined marine and land obseivations 
Figure 7 7 indicates that this has been far from uniform in 
time oi space and even today coverage is not comp-
iehensive Ships have followed pieferred navigational 
mutes and large aieas ot the ocean have been inadequately 
sampled The effect that this may have on global estimates 
ot SSTs has been tested in 
frozen gi id 
analyses 
(Bottomley et al 
1990) and in eigenvector analyses 
(Folland and Colman 1988) In the frozen grid analyses, 
global and hemisphenc time senes were recalculated using 
data trom 5 x5° boxes having data in nominated earlier 
decades foi example 1861 1870 Remaikably, the small 
coverage of this period (Figuie 7 7a) appears surprisingly 
adequate to estimate long term trends probably because the 
data aic distributed widely in both hemispheres throughout 
the last 125 years An eigenvector analysis ot combined 
land and ocean data (Colman, personal communication) 
isolates an undei lying signal of century time scale climate 
change which is suipnsingly unifoim geographically and 
very like Figuie 7 10c even though gross regional changes 
vaiy because of othei Iactors Figure 7 lOd shows the

trends, confining the data to the 1861-70 grid augments the 
temperature increase since the late nineteenth century by 
about 0 05°C at most However, omission ot much of the 
Southern Ocean in these tests, as well as air temperatures 
over the Arctic ocean north of 80°N, is a cause for concern 
So the uncertainties in trends due to varying data coverage 
may be underestimated by Figure 7 lOd 
In models lorced with enhanced greenhouse gases 
(Sections 5 and 6), warming over the land is substantially 
gieater than that over the ocean, so that the steadier and 
laiger warming of the Southern Hemisphere in recent 
decades is not predicted The latter may be part ol a global-
scale natural fluctuation of the ocean cnculation (Street-
Perrott and Pcrrott, 1990) Comparing Northern Hem-
isphere land and ocean, Figure 7 11 shows that the land is 
now relatively warmer than the oceans by the about the 
same amount as in the period of global warming during the 
first half ol this century Southern Hemisphere land (not 
shown) shows no recent warming relative to the oceans 
In summary, the overall increase of temperature since 
the nineteenth century can be estimated as follows It is 
probable that a small residual positive bias remains in the 
land surface temperatures due to increasing urbanisation 
(Section 74 11) 
However, the contribution of the 
urbanisation bias is at least halved in recent decades in the 
combined ocean and land data, so it is unlikely to exceed 
0 05°C From Figure 7 lOd, allowing for areas never 
adequately sampled, we estimate that vaiying data 
coveiagc produces an uncertainty in trend ol at least 
±0 05°C We also recognise the existence ol sevcial other 
sources of bias, highlighted by some disagreements 
between individual analyses, but are uncertain as to their 
Hue sign Therclore our best estimates of the lowei and 
upper limits of global warming between the late nineteenth 
century and the 1980s are about 0 VC and not more than 
0 6°C respectively, slightly less than most pievious 
estimates 
7.4.2 Regional, Seasonal, and Diurnal Space and Time 
Scales 
We show that regional, including zonally-averaged, climate 
variations often do not match those of the globe as a whole 
Some apparent differences between large-scale variations 
ot temperature in different seasons are shown Finally we 
discuss variations of maximum and minimum daily 
temperatures over the relatively restricted areas so far 
analysed

Regional time scries suffer from many near-random errors 
that can nearly cancel in analyses of global and 
hemispheric temperatures (Kleshchenko et al, 1988) The 
20° latitude x 60° longitude areas analysed in Figure 7 12a 
have been chosen to be large enough to minimise random 
errors and yet be small enough to capture the individual 
character ot regional temperature changes Figure 7 12a 
demonstrates considerable regional variability in 
temperature trends which nevertheless evolve coherently 
between adjacent regions Particularly striking is the peak 
warmth in the north east Atlantic and Scandinavian regions 
around 1940 45 followed by a sharp cooling, and the strong 
warming in the South Atlantic and much ot the Indian 
Ocean since about 1965 
Figure 7 12b shows zonally averaged land air temp-
erature and SST anomalies using the same data as in Figure 
7 12a 
Almost uniformly cooler conditions in the 
nineteenth century are clearly seen in all zones, extending 
into the early twentieth century Warming around 1920-
1940 occurs in most zones, except perhaps over the 
northern part of the Southern Ocean, with a strong 
warming, exceeding 0 8°C occurring to the north of 60°N 
over this period Note that the polar cap (north of 80°N) has 
insufficient data loi analysis and insufficient data exist to 
calculate repicscntativc zonal means south ol 40°S until 
after 1950 The cooling after 1950 was mainly confined to 
the Northern Hemisphere, though weak cooling is evident 
in the Southern Hemisphere tropics between about 1940 
and the early 1950s There was renewed warming in most 
Southern Hemisphere zones before 1970 This warming 
continued until the early 1980s but then slowed markedly 
However very little change of temperature is evident over 
Antarctica (south of 60°S) since records began there around 
1957 
Renewed warming is seen in the Northern 
Hemisphere in all zones after the early 1970s, including 
small rises in high latitudes, a fact hitherto little 
appreciated probably because of the marked cooling in the

recent Arctic cooling is in fact one representative of the 
North Atlantic Arctic sector only (much as Figure 7.12. 
third curve from the left, northernmost row) and is 
therefore not properly representative of high latitudes of the 
Northern Hemisphere as a whole. General circulation 
models with'enhanced concentrations of carbon dioxide

consistent recent warming is found in subtropical and 
tropical regions, especially the Indian Ocean and regions 
near to, and including, the tropical South Atlantic By 
contrast, cooling occurred in paits of the extratropical 
North Pacific and North Atlantic, especially between 1970 
and 1985 Recent warming has also been weak or absent 
over the Canadian archipelago, the Eastern Soviet Union, 
and Europe In Section 7 9 it will be shown that some of 
these regional temperature variations are linked to regional-
scale fluctuations in the circulation of the atmosphere, so it 
is not surprising that pronounced variations in regional 
temperature trends occur 
74 2 2 Seasonal \ at lation s and c han t>e s 
Figure 7 14 indicates that the increase of land based 
temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere since 1975 has 
largely consisted of an increase between December and 
May, but with little increase between June and November 
In the Southern Hemisphere there is little difference in 
recent seasonal trends (not shown) Of some concern are 
substantial differences in seasonal trends belore 1900 in the 
Northern Hemisphere The relative warmth of summer and 
coolness of winter at that time reflect considerably greater 
seasonal differences of the same character in the 
continental interiors of North America and Asia (not 
shown) It is not clear whether a decrease in the seasonal 
cycle of temperature that commenced around 1880 is real, 
it could be due to changes in the circulation of the 
atmosphere or it may reflect large, seasonally dependent, 
biases in some nineteenth century land data 
The latter 
might arise from the progressive changes of thermometer 
exposure known to have occurred then (Section 7 4 11) 
The Southern Hemisphere (not shown) shows a similar 
decrease in the seasonal cycle of temperature in the last

part of the nineteenth century, but with less than half 
the amplitude of that in the Northern Hemisphere 
7 4 2-! Da\-time and Nii>ht time 
Because the ocean has a large heat capacity, diurnal 
temperature variations in the ocean and in the overlying air 
are considerably muted compared with those over land and, 
from a climatic point of view, are likely to change little 
Over land, diurnal variations are much less restricted so the 
potential for relative variations in maximum and minimum 
temperature is much larger Such relative changes might 
result from changes in cloudiness, humidity, atmosphcnc 
circulation patterns windincss or even the amount of 
moisture in the ground Unfoitunately, it is not yet possible 
to assess variations of maximum and minimum tempeiatuie 
on a hemispheric or global scale However in the regions 
discussed below, multi-decadal tiends of day-time and 
night-time temperatuies have been studied and do not 
always appear to be the same 
Figure 7 15a, second panel shows a rise of minimum 
temperatures (these usually occur around dawn) in the 
USA The rise has not been reflected in maximum 
temperatures (which usually occur during mid-afternoon) 
(See also Section 7 10 1) Similar behaviour has been 
found in other parts of North America (Karl et al , 1984) 
Appreciably different variations of maximum and 
minimum temperatures on decadal time-scales are also 
observed at inland stations in Australia (Figure 7 15b) It is 
unlikely that urban heat islands play a significant role in 
these variations as the data for both countries have been 
extensively scrutinized for urban heat island biases In 
China (Figure 7 15c), the minimum temperature also 
appears to have risen more than the maximum It is 
uncertain to what extent increases in urbanisation 
contribute to the changes in China, especially as urban heat 
island biases tend to be greatest during the night 
Over 
New Zealand, a strong influence of atmospheric circulation 
variations on variations in daily maxima relative to daily 
minima has been observed (Salinger, 1981) This is an 
indication that the above results can only be fully 
understood when changes in atmospheric circulation over 
these countries have been studied in some detail

7.5 Precipitation and Evaporation Variations and 
Changes 
7.5.1 Precipitation Over Land 
Several large-scale analyses of precipitation changes over 
the Northern and Southern Hemisphere land masses have 
been carried out (Bradley et al., 1987; Diaz et al., 1989; 
Vinnikov et al., 1990). These have demonstrated that 
during the last few decades precipitation has tended to 
increase in the mid-latitudes, but decrease in the Northern 
Hemisphere siibtropics and generally increase throughout 
the Southern Hemisphere. However, these large-scale 
features contain considerable spatial variability. Figure 
7.16 illustrates this variability for three regions in the 
Northern Hemisphere and East Africa. Annual precipitation 
over the Soviet Union displays a remarkably consistent 
increase over the twentieth century (Figure 7.16a). An 
apparent increase in precipitation has been found over 
northern Europe (Schonwcise and Birrong, 1990) with a 
suggestion of a decrease in extreme southern Europe, 
though these data have not yet been corrected for changing 
instrumental biases. In the tropics, East African rainfall 
departures from normal show significant

Note that Sahel values are annual averages of standardised station values restandardised to reflect the standard deviation of these

variability, but consistent trends are absent (Figure 7 16c) 
Summer monsoon rainfall in India also reflects multi 
decadal changes in climate (Figure 7 16d), but consistent 
trends are also absent 
The period 1890-1920 was 
characterised by a high frequency of droughts in India, 
while 1930-1964 had a much lower frequency Since 1965 
the frequency of droughts has again been higher relative to 
1930-1964 (Gddgil 1988), mostly in the wet aieas of north 
eastern India (Gregoiy 1989) 
The dramatic drying ol sub Saharan Africa shown in 
Figure 7 16b deserves special comment 
Various 
explanations have been pioposed ievicwed in Duiyan 
(1989), see also Scmazzi et al (1988) and Wolter (1989) 
The most consistent icsult of these studies was to show 
ovei the last tew decades a pattern ol anomalously high 
SSTs in the Atlantic south ol about 10°N lower than 
normal SSTs in the Atlantic to the noith of 10°N and hiehei 
SSTs in the tropical Indian Ocean (Figure 7 13c) There has 
been a distinct weakening of some these patterns recently 
and a return to near normal rainfall in 1988 and 1989 Such 
large-scale changes of SST appear to have a major impact 
on the sub-Saharan atmospheric circulation (Folland et al 
1990, Wolter, 1989) Although SST changes appear to be 
strongly related to the decreased rainfall since the 1950s 
they are probably not the only cause (Nicholson 1989) 
Folland et al (1990) show however that at least UY/t of 
the variance of Sahel rainfall between 1901 and 1988 on 
time scales of one decade and longer is explained b> 
worldwide SST variations Reductions of lamlall occurred 
at much the same time immediately south of the Sahel and 
ovei much ol Ethiopia and the Caribbean 
It is important to consider the accuiacy ol the 
piecipitation data sets Precipitation is more ditlicult to 
monitoi than tempeiature as it vanes much more in time 
220 
Obsei \ ed Climate Vai latum and Chanqe 7 
and space A higher spatial density of data is needed to 
provide an analysis of variations and trends of computable 
accuracy High density data often reside within national 
meteoiological centres, but theie is no legular international 
exchange The number of stations required to sample a 
regionul rainfall climate adequately varies with region and 
an adequate number may not always be available 
A severe problem for analysing multi decadal variations 
of precipitation lies in the fact that the efficiency ol the 
collection of precipitation by raingauges varies with gauge 
siting construction and climate (Sevruk 1982, Folland 
1988, Legates and Willmott 1990) Majoi influences aie 
the wind speed during rain, the size distribution ol 
precipitation purticle sizes, and the exposure ol the 
raingauge site Fortunately, appropnate clnnatological 
averages ol the Inst two, highly variable quantities can be 
used to assess useiully their ellects over a long enough 
period (Folland, 1988, Appendix 1) Collection efficiency 
has tended to increase as operational practices have 
improved, often in poorly documented ways that may give 
aitificial upwurd trends in precipitation in some legions 
Thus precipitation data are not completely compatible 
between countries due to the lack of agreed standards Of 
particular concern is the measurement of snowfall from 
conventional gauges where errors of at least 40% in long 
teim collection efficiency can occur When piccipilation 
enors are expicsscd as a percentage of the Hue rami all it is 
not surprising that they tend to be greatest in high latitude 
windy, climates and least in wet equatorial regions 
Vinnikov et al , (1990) have carried out detailed 
collections to USSR data foi the varying aeiodynamic and 
wetting problems suffered by gauges These corrections are 
incorporated in the record shown in Figure 7 16a though 
no aerodynamic corrections were thought necessaiy in 
summer In winter the (positive) aerodynamic corrections 
can be large and vary from 5% to 40% (the latter loi snow) 
Wetting corrections, which are also positive and tend to be 
largest in summer, varied typically in the range 4% to 10% 
and were applied after correction for aerodynamic ellects 
Despite these large biases, comparisons ol data sets ovei 
the USSR Irom Bradley et al (1987) who only partially 
coirected foi biases, and Vinnikov et al who coi reeled 
more extensively show that most of the important long-
term variations are apparent in both data sets (Bradley and 
Groisman, 1989) Many of the major variations apparent in 
precipitation records are evident in hydrological data such 
as the rise in the levels of the North American Great Lakes 
Great Salt Lake and the Caspian Sea during the early 
1980s, and the severe desiccation of the Sahel 
Nevertheless the lack of bias corrections in most rainfall 
data outside the USSR is a severe impediment to 
quantitative assessments of rainfall trends 
7 5 2 Rainfall Over The Oceans 
Quantitative estimates ol pi capitation over the oceans are 
limited to the tiopics wheic they aie still veiy appioximate 
The mean temperature ol the uppei suilaces of convcctive 
clouds deduced from satellite measurements of outgoing 
long wave thermal radiation (OLR) are used to estimate 
mean rainfall over periods of days upwaids The colder the 
clouds the less is OLR and the heavier the rainfall (Section 
4 gives iclerences) Nitta and Yamada (1989) found a 
significant downward tiend in OLR averaged over the 
global equatorial belt 10°N to 10°S between 1974 and 
1987, implying an increase of equatorial rainfall over that 
time Arkin and Chelhah (1990) have investigated Nitta 
and Yamada s iesults foi this Report They find that 
inhomogeneities in the OLR data arc sufficiently serious to 
cast doubt on Nitta and Yamada s conclusions However 
the latter s claim that equatonal SST has risen over this 
penod seems justified (Flohn and Kapala, 1989, and 
Figures 7 12 and 7 H) This trend is likely to result in 
increased deep convection and more rainfall there (Gadgil 
et al 1984, Graham and Barnett, 1987) 
Section 7 i has shown that some regional scale rainfall 
trends have occurred ovei land However much more 
attention needs to be paid to data quality and to improving 
data coverage before more comprehensive conclusions can 
be diawn about precipitation variations over the global land 
sui lace Precipitation cannot yet be measuied with suf-
ficient accuracy over the oceans to reliably estimate trends, 
even though quite modest changes in SST in the tropics 
could give rise to important changes in the distribution of 
tiopical idinlall (see ulso Section 7 9 1) 
7 5 3 Evaporation from the Ocean Surface 
It is difficult to estimate trends in evaporation from the 
oceans An increase is however, expected us u result of an 
increase in greenhouse gases (Section 5) The most 
important problem concerns the reliability of measurements 
of wind speed that are an essentiul component of 
evuporution estimates 
Oceanic wind speeds have 
apparently increased in recent decades However, Cardone 
et al (1990) have demonstrated that much of this increase 
can be explained by changes in the methods of estimating 
v, ind speed from the state of the sea surface, and changes in 
the heights of anemometers used to measure wind speed on 
ships Until these problems are substantially reduced, it is 
considered that estimates of trends in evaporation are 
unlikely to be reliable 
7.6 Tropospheric Variations and Change 
7.6.1 Temperature

Christy (1990) (solid line), 850 300mb radiosonde temperatures 
based on Angell (1988) (dots), combined land and sea surface 
temperatures as in Figure 7 10 (dashed line) All anomalies are 
referred to the average of their respective data sets for 1979-1988 
warming and stratospheric cooling (Barnett and 
Schlesinger, 1987) Observational studies of variations in 
recent temperature changes with height have been made by 
numerous authors, for example Parker (1985), Barnett 
(1986), Sellers and Liu (1988) and Karoly (1989) Layer 
mean temperatures from a set of 63 radiosonde stations 
covering the globe have been derived by Angell (1988) 
Most stations have operated continuously only since about 
1958 (the International Geophysical Year) The network is 
zonally well distributed, but about 609f of the stations are 
in the Northern Hemisphere and only 40% in the Southern 
Hemisphere Layer mean temperatures lrom this network 
have been integrated for the globe Figuic 7 17a shows that 
over the globe as a whole, mid-troposphenc (850 300 mb) 
temperatures increased by about 0 4°C between the late 
1960s and mid-1980s, with much ol the rise concentrated 
between 1975 and the early 1980s as at the surlace Zonal 
average anomalies for 850-300mb (not shown) indicate that 
the largest changes occurred in the zone 1()°S to 6()°S 
followed by the equatorial region (1()°N to 1()°S) with little 
trend north of 60°N or south of 60°S This finding is in 
good agreement with surface data (Figuies 7 12a and b) 
In the upper troposphere (300 100 mb) Figure 7 17b 
shows that there has been a rather steady decline in 
temperature since the late 1950s and early 1960s in general 
disagreement with model simulations that show warming 
at these levels when the concentration of gicenhouse gases 
is increased (Section 5) The greatest change in temperature 
has been in the lowei stratosphcic (100-50 mb) where the

decrease altei 1980 is much beyond the vai lability ol the 
previous decades It is mostly attributed to changes over 
and around Antarctica (Figure 7 17c) whcie the cooling 
since 1973 has reached nearly 10°C in austral spung and 
2°C in summer (Angell, 1988) but with small values ol 
cooling in other seasons A small amount ol lower 
stratospheric cooling has been observed elscwheie in the 
Southern Hemisphere, mainly in the tropics, and also in the 
equatorial belt (10°N to 10°S) The abrupt decrease ovei 
Antarctica in spring may at least be partly related to the 
formation of the "ozone hole 
Temperatures derived from ladiosondes aie subject to 
instrumental biases These biases have not been assessed 
in the data used by Angell (1988) although theie have been 
many changes in ladiosonde instrumentation over the last 
31 years In 1984-85, international radiosonde comparisons 
were carried out (Nash and Schmidlin 1987) Systematic 
dillcrences between various types of radiosonde were 
determined for a series of flights which penetrated the 
tropopause The estimated heights ol the lOOinb surface 
generally differed by up to 10 20 geopotcntial metres 
which is equivalent to average differences of 0 25°C in the 
layei from the surface to 100 mb 
7.6.2 Comparisons of Recent Troposphenc and Surface 
Temperature Data 
A measure of the robustness of the troposphenc data 
derived by Angell (1988), at least in recent years, can be 
obtained by comparing his 850-300mb data with ten years 
ol independent satellite measuiements analysed by Spencer 
and Christy (1990) for 1979 1988 Spencer and Christy 
have used the average of measurements lrom microwave 
sounding units (MSU) aboaid two USA National 
Occanographic and Atmosphenc Administration (NOAA) 
TIROS-N series ol satellites to denve global temperatures 
in the mid troposphere Although surface and mid-
troposphenc data are likely to show rathei diffeient 
changes in their values over individual regions, bettci but 
not perfect, coupling is expected when the data are 
aveiaged ovei the globe as a whole Figure 7 17d compares 
the annual global combined land air lempeialuie and SST 
data used in Figure 7 10 with annual values of these two 
tioposphenc data sets for the penod 1979-1988 in each 
case the 10 annual anomalies are calculated lrom their 
lcspcctive 1979-1988 averages The agicement between the 
three data sets is surprisingly good, despite recent 
suggestions that it is poor Thus the coiielations and root 
mean squared ditlerences between the surface and MSU 
data aie 0 85 and 0 08°C respectively, while the correlation 
between the surface and the radiosonde data is 0 91 The 
correlation between the two troposphenc data sets is, as 
expected slightly higher at 0 96 with a root mean squared 
diffeience of 0 02°C The latter represents excellent 
agreement given the relatively spaise network of 
radiosondes Note that annual values in both troposphenc 
data sets have nearly twice the variability of the surface 
values, as measuicd by their standard deviation This partly 
explains why the loot mean square difference between the 
MSU and surface data is appreciably larger than that 
between the two troposphenc data sets, despite the high 
correlation This is, arguably, an indication ol genuine 
climatological diffeiences between the interannual 
variability of mid-troposphere temperatures and those of 
the surface All three data sets show a small positive trend 
over the period 1979-1988, varying from 0 04°C/decade for 
the MSU data to 0 13°C/decade for the surface data These 
trends aie not significantly different over this short period 
and again reflect surprisingly great agreement Further 
discussion of these results is given in Jones and Wigley 
(1990) 
7.6.3 Moisture 
Watei vapour is the most abundant greenhouse gas, and its 
increases aie expected to augment the warming due to 
increases of other greenhouse gases by about 50% 
Trenberth et al (1987) estimate that doubling carbon 
dioxide concentrations would increase the global con-
centration of water vapour by about 20%, and Hansen et al 
(1984) estimate a 33% inciease 
There is evidence that global watei vapour has been a 
lew percent greater dunng the 1980s than during the 1970s 
(Elliott et al , 1990) Hcnse et al (1988), and Flohn et al 
(1990) find a 20% increase in water vapour content in the 
mid tiopospherc over the equatorial Pacific from 1965-
1986 with at least a 10% rise between the surface and the 
300mb level Despite great uncertainties in these data some 
increase seems to have taken place Because of numerous 
changes in iadiosondes a global assessment of variations 
pnoi to 1973 is difficult and trends after 1973 have an 
unceitain accuracy See also Section 8 
7.7 Sub-Surface Ocean Temperature and Salinity 
Variations 
The sub-suilace ocean data base is now just becoming 
sufficient foi climate change studies in the North Atlantic 
and North Pacific basins to be carried out A few, long, 
local time sencs of sub-surface measurements exist, 
sufficient to alert the scientific community to emerging 
evidence of decadal scale temperature variability in the 
Atlantic Ocean Beginning about 1968, a fresh, cold water 
mass with its origins in the Arctic Ocean appears to have 
circulated aiound the sub-Arctic gyre of the North Atlantic 
Ocean This event has been described by Dickson et al 
(1988) as the Gieat Salinity Anomaly 
Some of this cold, 
Iresh water penetrated to the deep waters of the North 
Atlantic (Bicwer et al, 1983) The marked cool anomalies 
7 Obsencd

221 
in the Noith Atlantic SST shown in Figure 7 H loi 1967-
76 partly reflect this event 
Recently, Levitus (1989a, b, c d) has can led out a majoi 
study ol changes ol sub surlace temperature and salinity of 
the North Atlantic Ocean between 1955 59 and 1970 74 
1955-59 was near the end of a very warm period ol North 
Atlantic suiface waters, but by 1970-74 the subsequent 
cool period was well developed (Figure 7 13) Coolei water 
extended liom neai the sea surface to 1400m depth in the 
subtropical gyre O0-50°N) Beneath the subtropical gyre, a 
warming occurred between the two periods North ol this 
gyre there was an increase in the temperature and salinit) 
of the western sub aictic gyic 
The density changes 
associated with these changes in tempeiature and salinity 
indicate that the tiansport ol the Gull Stream may have 
decieased between the two periods Temperature difference 
lields along 24 5°N and ~\b 5°N piesented by Roemmich 
and Wunsch (1984) based on data gathered during 1981 
and the late 1950s, aie consistent with these ideas 
Antonov (1990) has earned out a complementary study 
lor the North Atlantic and North Pacilic using subsurface 
tempeiature data held in the USSR and SST data fiom the 
UK Meteoiological OH ice He finds that zonal aveiages of 
tempeiature changes between 
1957 and 
1981 show 
statistically significant cooling in the upper layers and a 
warming below 600m when averaged over the North 
Atlantic as a whole This agrees well with Levitus results 
for the North Atlantic Basin mean tempeiatuie changes 
(1957 to 1981) for the North Atlantic and North Pacific, as 
computed by Antonov, aie shown in Figure 7 18 
The reasons for some of these changes are partially 
understood

ol the subtropical gyre was due to an upwaid displacement 
ol cooler lieshei watei 
Why this displacement occuned is 
not definitely known 
but most piobably is lclated to 
changes in the large scale wind held ovei the Noith 
Atlantic 
Ol paiticular importance is the temperatuie 
increase of approximately 0 1°C ovei, on average, a 
thousand metre thick layei in the deep North Atlantic 
because it represents a relativel} large heat storage Even 
the uppei few metres of the ocean can store as much heat as 
the entire overlying atmosphenc column ol an Scientists 
have long lecogm/ed (Rossby, 1959) that the ocean could 
act to store large amounts of heat

temperature changes in its sub-surface layeis loi hundreds 
or thousands ot years 
When this heal ieturns to the 
atmospheie/cryosphere system it could also sigmticantlv 
affect climate Section 6 gives more details 
The magnitude and extent of the obseived changes in the 
temperature and salinity of the deep Noith Atlantic are thus 
large enough that they cannot be neglected in future 
theories of climate change 
7.8 Variations and Changes in the Cryosphere 
Snow, ice, and glacial extent aie key variables in the global 
climate system 
They can influence the global heat budget 
through regulation ot the exchange of heat moistuie, and 
momentum between the ocean, land, and atmosphere 
Accurate mloimation on cryosphenc changes is essential 
foi full undeistanding of the climate system 
Crjosphenc 
data are also integratois of the variations ol several 
variables such as temperatuie, sunshine amount and 
precipitation, and toi sea-ice, changes in wind stiess 
Therefore caution must be exercised when interpieting a 
cryosphenc change 
Variations in the Greenland and 
Antarctic ice sheets are discussed in Section 9 
7.8.1 Snow Cover 
Surface-based observations ol snow covei aie sulliuentlv,

surface limits; the seasonal variation of sunlight limits 
polar coverage in the visible wavelengths; and scattered 
mountain snows are omitted because of the coarse grid 
resolution. Data are believed to be usable from 1972 with 
caution, but are better from 1975 onwards. 
Consistent with the surface and tropospheric temperature 
measurements is the rapid decrease in snow cover extent 
around 1980 (Figure 7.19). This decrease is largest during 
the transition seasons. Robinson and Dewey (1990) note 
that the reduction in snow cover extent during the 1980s is 
largest in Eurasia where they calculate decreases during 
autumn and spring of about 13% and 9% respectively 
relative to the 1970s.

Hemisphere sea-ice extent anomalies. Data from NOAA (USA). 
7.8.2 Sea-ice Extent and Thickness 
There has been considerable interest in the temporal 
variability of global sea-ice in both the Arctic and Antarctic 
(for example, Walsh and Sater, 1981; Sturman and 
Anderson, 1985). This interest has been increased by 
general circulation model results suggesting that 
greenhouse warming may be largest at high latitudes in the 
Northern Hemisphere. It must be recognized, though, that 
sea-ice is strongly intluenced by surface winds and ocean 
currents so that the consequences of global warming for 
changes in sea-ice extent and thickness are unlikely to be 
straightforward. 
Sea-ice limits have long been observed by ships, and 
harbour logs often contain reported dates of the appearance 
and disappearance of harbour and coastal ice. These 
observations present many problems of interpretation 
(Barry, 1986) though they are thought to be more reliable 
after about 1950. Changes and fluctuations in Arctic sea-
ice extent have been analysed by Mysak and Manak 
(1989); they find no long term trends in sea-ice extent 
between 1953 and 1984 in a number of Arctic ocean 
regions but substantial decadal time scale variability was 
evident in the Atlantic sector. These variations were found 
to be consistent with the development, movement and 
decay of the "Great Salinity Anomaly" noted in Section 
7.7. 
Sea-ice conditions are now reported regularly in marine 
synoptic observations, as well as by special reconnaissance 
flights, and coastal radar. Especially importantly, satellite 
observations have been used to map sea-ice extent 
routinely since the early 1970s. The American Navy Joint 
Ice Center has produced weekly charts which have been 
digitised by NOAA. These data are summarized in Figure 
7.20 which is based on analyses carried out on a 1° latitude 
x 2.5° longitude grid. Sea-ice is defined to be present when 
its concentration exceeds 10% (Ropelewski, 1983). Since 
about 1976 the areal extent of sea-ice in the Northern 
Hemisphere has varied about a constant climatological 
level but in 1972-1975 sea-ice extent was significantly less. 
In the Southern Hemisphere since about 1981, sea-ice 
extent has also varied about a constant level. Between 1973 
and 1980 there were periods of several years when 
Southern Hemisphere sea-ice extent was either appreciably 
more than or less than that typical in the 1980s. 
7 Obsened Climate Vai lation and Change 
22^ 
Gloersen and Campbell (1988) have analysed the 
Scanning Multi-channel (dual polarization) Microwave 
Radiometer data from the Nimbus 7 satellite from 1978 
1987 They find little change in total global ice area but a 
significant decrease ol open water within the ice Their 
time series is short, and it is uncertain whether the decrease 
is real 
Sea-ice thickness is an important parameter but it is 
much more difficult to measure than sea-ice extent The 
heat flux from the underlying ocean into the atmosphere 
depends on sea-ice thickness Trends in thickness over the 
Arctic Ocean as a whole could be a sensitive indicator of 
global warming The only practical method ol making 
extensive measurements is by upward-looking sonar from 
submarines Apart from a very recent deployment of 
moorings, data gathering has been carried out on voyages 
by military submarines In the past repeated tracks carried 
out in summer have either found no change in mean 
thickness (Wadhams 
1989) or variations that can be 
ascribed to interannual variability in summer ice limits and 
ice concentration (McLaren 1989) Recently however, 
Wadhams (1990) found a 15% or larger decrease in mean 
sea-ice thickness between October 1976 and May 1987 
over a large region north of Greenland 
Lack of a 
continuous set of observations makes it impossible to 
assess whether the change is part of a long term trend In 
the Antarctic no measurements of thickness variability 
exist and so far only one geographically extensive set of 
sea-ice thickness data is available (Wadhams et al 1987) 
7.8.3 Land Ice (Mountain Glaciers) 
Measurements of glacial ice volume and mass balance are 
more informative about climatic change than those of the 
extent of glacial ice, but they aic considerably scarcer Ice 
volume can be determined fiom transects of bedrock and 
ice surface elevation using airborne radio-echo sounding 
measurements 
Mass balance studies performed by 
measuring winter accumulation and summer ablation are 
slow and approximate, though widely used Section 9 
discusses changes in the Greenland and Antarctic ice-caps 
so attention is confined here to mountain glaciers 
A substantial, but not continuous, recession of mountain 
glaciers has taken place almost eveiywhere since the latter 
halt of the nineteenth century (Grove, 1988) This 
conclusion is based on a combination of mass balance 
analyses and changes in glacial terminus positions, mostly 
the latter The recession is shown in Figure 7 2, evidence 
for glacial retreat is found in the Alps, Scandinavia 
Iceland, the Canadian Rockies, Alaska, Central Asia, the 
Himalayas, on the Equator, in tropical South America, New 
Guinea, New Zealand, Patagonia, the sub Antarctic islands 
and the Antarctic Peninsula (Grove 1988) The rate of 
recession appears to have been geneially laigcst between 
about 1920 and 1960 
Glacial advance and retreat is influenced by tempeialure 
precipitation, and cloudiness Foi example at a given 
latitude glaciers tend to extend to lower altitudes in wetter 
cloudier, maritime regions with cooler summers than in 
continental regions The complex relation between glaciers 
and climate makes their ubiquitous recession since the 
nineteenth century remarkable temperature changes appeal 
to be the only plausible common factor (Ocrlemans 1988) 
The iesponse time of a glacier to changes in enviionmental 
conditions varies with its size so that the larger the glaciei 
the slower is the response (Haeberli et al 1989) In recent 
decades glacial recession has slowed in some regions 
Makarevich and Rototaeva (1986) show that between 1955 
and 1980 about 27% of 104 North American glaciers were 
advancing and 53%- were retreating whereas over Asia 
only about 5% ol neaily 350 glaciers were advancing 
Wood (1988) found that from 1960 to 1980 the number of 
retreating glacieis decreased 
This may be related to the 
relatively cool period in the Northern Hemisphere over 
much of this time (Figure 7 10) However Pat/elt (1989) 
finds that the proportion of retreating Alpine glaciers has 
increased sharply since the early 1980s so that ictreal has 
dominated since 1985 in this region A similar analysis for 
other mountain regions after 1980 is not yet available 
7.8.4 Permafrost 
Permafrost may occur where the mean annual air 
temperatures are less than 1 °C and is generally continuous 
where mean annual temperature is less than 7°C The 
vertical profile of temperature measurements in pennairost 
that is obtained by drilling boreholes can indicate 
integrated changes of temperature over decades and longer 
However, interpretation of the profiles requires knowledge 
of the ground conditions as well as natuial oi human 
induced changes in vegetation cover Lachcnbruch and 
Marshall (1986) provide evidence that a 2 to 4 C wanning 
has taken place in the coastal plain ot Alaska at the 
permafrost surface over the last 75 to 100 yeais but much 
of this rise is probably associated with wanning prior to the 
1910s 
Since the 1930s there is little evidence lor 
sustained warming in the Alaskan Arctic (see Figure 7 12a 
and Michaels, 1990) A fuller understanding ol the 
relationship between permalrost and temperatuie requnes 
better information on changes in snow cover seasonal 
variations of ground temperature, and the impact ol the 
inevitable disturbances associated with the act ol drilling 
the bore holes (Bairy 1988) 
7.9 Variations and Changes in Atmospheric 
Circulation 
The atmospheric circulation is the main control behind 
iegional changes in wind temperature, precipitation soil 
moisture and othei climatic variables Variations in many 
226 
Obsei \ ed Climate Vai icitwn and Change 7 
ol these factors aic quite strongly related thiough large 
scale leatures ol the atmospheric circulation as well as 
through interactions involving the land and ocean suilaces 
One goal ol research into regional changes ol atmospheric 
circulation is to show that the changes ol temperature 
rainfall and other climatic variables are consistent with the 
changes in frequency of various types ol weathei pattern 
Climates at the same latitude vaiy considerably around 
the globe, while variations in regional tempeiatures that 
occur on decadal time scales arc lar from unitoim but form 
distinctive large-scale patterns as indicated in Figuie 7 13 
The spatial scale of these climatic patterns is pailly 
governed by the regional scales ol atmospheiic cnculation 
patterns and of their vanalions Changes in weather 
patterns may involve changes in the quasi stationary 
atmospheric long waves in the extratropics oi in monsoonal 
circulations (van Loon and Williams 1976) Both phen 
omena have a scale ol scveial thousand kilometies Their 
laige-scale leatures are ielated to the fixed spatial patterns 
ol land and sea, topography, sea tempeiatuie patterns and 
the seasonal cycle of solar heating 
Persistent laigc scale atmospheiic patterns tend to be 
wavelike so that legional changes ol atmospheiic heating 
ll poweiful and persistent enough can give use to a 
sequence ol iemote atmospheiic distuibances Thus a 
numbei of well sepaiated aieas ol anomalous tempeiatuie 
and piecipitation of opposite chaiactei may be pioduced 
The best known examples aie in pait ielated to the Luge 
changes in SSTs that accompany the El Nino-Soulhein 
Oscillation (ENSO), whereby changes in the atmospheic 
ovei the tiopical Pacific often associated with the SST 
changes there arc linked to atmospheiic cnculation changes 
in highei latitudes (Wallace and Gut/lei 1981) The 1988 
North Amencan drought has been claimed to be paitly a 
response to peisistent positive tiopical SST anomalies 
located to the west of Mexico and to the north of the cold 
La Nina SST anomalies existing at that time (Tienberth et 
al 
1988) Such localised SST anomalies may themselves 
have a much largei scale cause (Naimas 1989) 
An emerging topic concerns obscivational evidence that 
the 1 1 year solai cycle and the stratosphenc quasi biennial 
oscillation (QBO) of wind dncction neai the equatoi aic 
linked to changes in troposphenc cnculation in the 
Northern Hemisphere (van Loon and Labitzke 1988) 
Coherent variations in troposphenc circulation are claimed 
to occui over each 11 year solai cycle in ceitam iegions 
but their chaiacter depends ciucially on the phase (easterly 
or westeily) ot the QBO No mechanism has been proposed

Many previous largely unsubstantiated claims of links 
between the 11 year, and other solar cycles, and climate are 
reviewed in Pittock (1983) Section 2 discusses current 
thinking about the possible magnitude of the physical 
forcing of global climate by solar radiation changes in 
some detail 
Several examples are now given of links between 
changes in atmospheric circulation over the last century 
and regional-scale variations or trends of temperature 
7 9.1 El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Influences 
ENSO is the most prominent known source of interannual 
vai lability in weather and climate around the world, though 
not all areas are affected The Southern Oscillation (SO) 
component of ENSO is an atmospheric pattern that extends 
ovei most of the global tiopics It pnncipally imolves a 
seesaw in atmospheric mass between regions near 
Indonesia and a tropical and sub-tropical south cast Pacific 
Ocean region centred near Easter Island The influence of 
ENSO sometimes extends to higher latitudes (see Section 
7 9 3) The El Nino component ol ENSO is an anomalous 
warming of the eastern and central tiopical Pacilic Ocean 
In majoi Waim Events 
wanning extends over much of 
the tiopical Pacilic and becomes clearly linked to the 
atmospheric SO pattern An opposite phase of 
Cold 
Events with opposite patterns ol the SO is sometimes 
icfcncd to as La Nina ENSO events occui every 3 to 10 
ycais and have fai leaching climatic and economic 
influences around the world (Figuie 7 21a adapted from 
Ropelewski and Halpeit 1987) Places especially affected 
include the tiopical cential and East Pacific islands, the 
coast of noilh Pciu eastern Austiaha New Zealand 
(Salmgei 1981) Indonesia India (Parthasarathy and Pant, 
198s)) and parts ol eastern (Ogallo, 1989) and southern 
Afnca (van Heciden el al 1988) A fullei descnption of 
ENSO can be found in Rasmusson and Carpenter (1982) 
and Zebiak and Cane (1987) Over India, the occurrence of 
ENSO and that of many droughts (see Section 7 5 1) is 
stnkingly coincident Droughts tend to be much more 
liequcnl in the Inst year of an ENSO event though, 
mtnguingly this is often beloie the ENSO event has fully 
developed However not all Indian dioughts aie associated 
with ENSO 
While ENSO is a natural part of the Eaiths climate, a 
ma]or issue concerns whether the intensity or frequency of 
ENSO events might change as a result of global warming 
Until recently the models used to examine the climatic 
consequences ol enhanced greenhouse forcing had such 
simplified oceans that ENSOs could not be simulated 
Some models now simulate ENSO like but not entirely 
realistic SST variations (Section 4) unloitunately long 
term variations in ENSO cannot be studied yet using 
models The observational lecord leveals that ENSO events 
have changed in liequency and intensity in the past The

Ropelewski and Halpert, 1987). (b) Monthly tropical sea surface and land air temperature anomalies 1961-1989; land data from P.D. 
Jones and sea surface temperature data from the UK Meteorological Office. Tropics extend from 20°N to 20°S. Arrows mark 
maximum ENSO warmth in the tropics. 
strong SO fluctuations from 1880 to 1920 led to the 
discovery and naming of the SO (Walker and Bliss, 1932) 
and strong SO events are clearly evident in recent decades. 
A much quieter period occurred from the late 1920s to 
about 1950, with the exception of a very strong multi-year 
ENSO in 1939-42 (Trcnbcrth and Shea, 1987; Cooper et 
al., 1989). Quinn et al. (1987) (covering the past 450 years) 
and Ropelewski and Jones (1987) have documented 
historical ENSO events as seen on the northwest coast of 
South America. Therefore, the potential exists for a longer 
palaeo-record based on river deposits, ice cores, coral 
growth rings and tree rings. 
During ENSO events, the heat stored in the warm 
tropical western Pacific is transferred directly or indirectly 
to many other parts of the tropical oceans. There is a 
greater than normal loss of heat by the tropical oceans, 
resulting in a short period warming of many, though not all, 
parts of the global atmosphere (Pan and Oort, 1983). 
Consequently, warm individual years in the record of 
global temperatures (Figure 7.10) are often associated with 
El Nifios. Maxima in global temperatures tend to occur 
about three to six months after the peak warmth of the El 
Nino (Pan and Oort, 1983). Figure 7.21b shows monthly 
anomalies of combined land surface air temperatures and 
SST for the global tropics from 1961-1989. The strong, 
coherent, warming influence of the 1972-73, 1982-83 and 
1986-88 ENSO events on the record of tropical temperature 
is very clear, as is the cold influence of the strong La Nina 
episodes of 1974-75 and 1988-89.

increased the frequency ol zonal flows over the higher 
latitudes of the continents Note that the charactei ol the 
warming experienced in the higher latitude Northern 
Hemisphere in the the 1920s and 1930s differs from that of 
the mid-1970s to early 1980s (Figure 7 10) when the North 
Atlantic and Arctic stayed cool, or in parts, cooled further 
Inter-decadal changes in the west African monsoon 
circulation which have paiticulaily affected Sub-Saharan 
African rainfall (Figure 7 16) were introduced in Section 
7 5 1 The main change in atmospheric circulation has been 
in the convergence ol winds into sub Saharan Africa in 
summer from the north and the south (Newell and Kidson, 
1984), less intense convergence gives less rainfall (Folland 
et al, 1990) Drier years are also often accompanied by a 
slightly more southerly position of the main wind 
convergence (rain bearing) zone The North Atlantic 
subtropical high pressure belt also tended to extend further 
southward and eastwaid during the summer in the dry 
Sahel decades (Wolter and Hastenrath, 1989)

7.9.3 The North Pacific 
Circulation changes in the North Pacific have recently been 
considerable and have been linked with regional 
temperature changes Figure 7 23 shows a time series of 
mean sea level piessure for the five winter months 
November to March averaged over most of the extra-
tropical North Pacihc loi 1946 1988 (Trenberth 1990) 
This index is closely related to changes in the intensity of 
the Aleutian low pressuie centre It is also quite stiongly 
linked to a pattern ol atmospheric circulation variability 
known as the Pacitic North American (PNA) pattern 
(Wallace and Gutzlcr 1981) which is mostly conlincd to 
the Noith Pacihc and to extratropical Noith America All 
five wintei months showed a much deepei Aleutian Low in 
the period 1977 to 1988 with icduced piessuie ovei nearly 
all the extratropical Noith Pacihc north ol about 32 N 
(Flohn et al 1990) The change in pressuie in Figuie 7 23 
appears to have been unusually abiupt othei examples of 
such climatic discontinuities have been analysed (Zhang 
et al 
1983) though discontinuities can sometimes be 
artifacts of the statistical analysis ol lncgulai time series 
The stronger Aleutian Low lesulted in waimei moistei an 
being carried into Alaska while much colder an moved 
south over the North Pacific 
These changes account for 
the large Pacific temperature anomalies tor 1980-89 shown 
in Figure 7 13, which are even cleaier for the decade 1977-
86 (not shown) This decade had a positive anomaly 
(relative to 1951 80) ol over 1 5°C in Alaska and negative 
anomaly of more than 0 75°C in the cential and western 
Noith Pacific 
The above changes aie likely to have been lelated to 
conditions in the equatonal Pacific 
1977 1987 was a 
period when much of the tiopical Pacilic and tiopical 
Indian Oceans had persistently above normal SSTs (Nitta 
and Yamada, 1989, and Figure 7 12a) Very strong El Nino 
events and a lack of cold tropical La Nina events in the 
period 1977-1987 (Figure 7 21b) contributed to this 
situation 
7.9.4 Southern Hemisphere 
In Antarctica strong surface temperature inversions form in 
winter but elsewhere in the Southern Hemisphere maritime 
influences dominate The SO has a pronounced influence 
on precipitation over Australia (Pittock 197*)) and also 
affects New Zealand temperatures and piecipitation 
(Gordon 1986) However the best documented iegional 
circulation-temperature relationship in the Southern 
Hemisphere is that between an index of the meridional 
(southerly and noitherly) wind (Trenbeith 1976) and New 
Zealand temperatuie The index is calculated b\ subtiacting 
sea level piessuie values measured at Hobail (Tasmania) 
horn those at Chatham Island (east ol New Zealand) A 
tendency tor moie northeily mean flow acioss New 
Zealand (Hobart pressure ielatively low) especiallv liom 
about 1952 to 1971 has been related to geneially waimei 
conditions in New Zealand after 1950 However a return to 
more southerly (colder) flow after 1971 is not strongly 
ieflected in New Zealand temperatures so the recent 
warmth may be related to the general increase in 
temperature in much of the Southern Hemisphere (Figures 
7 10b, 7 12 and 7 13) This linding indicates that regional 
temperature changes due to a future greenhouse warming 
are likely to result from an interplay between large scale 
warming and changes in local weather patterns 
2M) 
Obsenid Climate Vaimtion and Change 7 
7.10 Cloudiness 
Clouds modify both the shortwave (solar) and longwave 
(terrestrial) radiation, the former by reflection and the latter 
by absorption Therefore they may cause a net wanning oi 
cooling of global temperature, depending on their type 
distribution, coverage, and radiative characteristics 
(Sommerville and Remer, 1984 Cess and Pottei, 1987) 
Ramanathan et al 
(1989) show that with todays 
distribution and composition ol clouds, their ovei all effect 
is to cool the Earth (Section 3 3 4) Changes in cloudiness 
are therefore likely to play a significant role in climate 
change Furthermore, local and regional climate variations 
can be strongly influenced by the amount of low middle 
and high clouds 
Observations of cloudiness can be made liom the Eailh s 
surface by trained observers from land stations oi ocean 
vessels, or by automated systems Above the Eaiths 
surface, aircraft or space platforms are used (Rossow 
1989, McGuffie 
and Henderson-Sellers 
1989a) 
Suipnsingly, surface-based observations of cloudiness give 
closely similar results to space based observations Careful 
and detailed intercomparisons, undertaken as a preliminary 
part of the International Satellite Cloud Climatology 
Project (ISCCP) by Sze et al (1986), have demonstrated 
conclusively that surface and space based observations are 
highly correlated Space-based observations of cloudiness 
11om major international programs such as ISCCP aie not 
yet available for periods sulficiently long to detect long-
term changes 
7.70.7 Cloudiness Over Land 
Henderson Sellers (1986 
1989) and McGuffie and 
Henderson-Sellers (1989b) have analyzed changes in total 
cloud cover over Europe and Noith America during the 
twentieth century It was found that annual mean cloud-
iness increased over both continents Preliminary analyses 
foi Australia and the Indian sub-continent also give 
increases in cloudiness The incieases are substantial lck 
ol initial cloudiness/50 years over India 6%/8() yeais over 
Europe 8%/80 years for Australia and about 10%/90 years 
lor North America These changes may paitly lesult from 
alteiations in surface-based cloud observing piactices and 
in the subsequent processing ol cloud data This may be 
especially true of the large increase in cloudiness app-
aicntly observed in many areas in the 1940s and 1950s At 
this time (about 1949 or later, depending on the country) 
the synoptic meteorological code, from which many of 
these observations are denved generally underwent a 
majoi change but not in the USA USSR and Canada 
Observers began recording cloud cover in oktas (eighths) 
instead of in tenths When skies were partly cloudy it is 
possible that some observers who had been used to making 
obseivations in the decimal system converted decimal 
observations ol cloud cover eironeously to the same 
number ol oktas theieby ovcicstimating the cloud covei 
Recently Karl and Steuicr (1990) have compared day-
time cloudiness statistics ovei the USA with data from 
automated sunshine recorders They indicate that there was 
a much larger increase of annual cloud cover during the 
1940s than can be accounted for by the small observed 
decrease in the percentage ol possible sunshine The large 
increase ol cloudiness may be attributed to the inclusion of 
the obscuiing effects of smoke, haze, dust, and fog in cloud 
cover reports from the 1940s onward (theie being no 
change in the recording practice from tenths to oktas in the 
USA) The increase in cloudiness after 1950 may be real 
because an increase is consistent with changes in the 
tempciatuie and precipitation lecords in the USA, 
including the decreased diuinal temperature range seen in 
Figuie 7 15 
Obscived land based changes in cloudiness are difficult 
to assess Nonetheless total cloud amount appears to have 
increased in some continental regions, a possibility 
supported by noticeable reductions in the diurnal range of 
tempeiature in some of these regions Elsewhere the 
cloudiness record cannot be interpieted reliably 
7.10.2 Cloudiness Over The Oceans 
Ocean-based observations of cloud cover since 1930 have 
been compiled by Warren et al (1988) The data are 
derived fiom maritime synoptic weather observations 
Then numbei varies between 100,000 and 2 000,000 each 
year incieasing with time and the geographic coveiage 
also changes The data indicate that an increase in marine 
cloudiness exceeding one percent in total sky covered on a 
global basis took place liom the 1940s to the 1950s This 
increase is not reflected in the proportion ol observations 
having a cleai sky or a complete overcast The largest 
increases weie in stratocumulus clouds in Northern 
Hemisphere mid-latitudes and in cumulonimbus in the 
tiopics Since 1930 mean cloudiness has mcieased by 3-4 
peicent ol the total area ol sky in the Northern Hemisphere 
and by about hall ol this value in the Southern Hemisphere 
Fixed ocean weather ships placed after 1945 in the North 
Atlantic and North Pacilic with well trained observers, 
showed no trends in cloudiness between the 1940s and 
1950s when other ship data Irom nearby locations showed 
relatively large increases changes of the same sign as those 
in available land records (Section 7 10 1) It is clearly not 
possible to be confident that average global cloudiness has 
really increased 
7.11 Changes of climate Variability and Climatic 
Extremes 
Aspects of climate variability include those associated with 
day-to-day changes inter-seasonal and interannual var-
232 
Obsei ved Climate Variation and Change 7 
lonships are highly sensitive to the choice of region There 
appears to be little relation between interannual variability 
and the relative warmth or coldness of decadal averages 
Although Diaz and Quayle (1980) found a tendency for 
increased variability in the USA during the relatively warm 
years of the mid-twentieth century (1921-1955), Karl 
(1988) found evidence for sustained episodes (decades) of 
very high and low interannual variability with little change 
in baseline climate Furthermore, Balling et al (1990) 
found no relationship between mean and extreme values of 
temperature in the desert southwest of the USA 
7.11.2 Droughts and Floods 
An important question concerns variations in areas affected 
by severely wet (' flood ) or drought conditions However, 
drought and moisture indices calculated for Australia (not 
shown), parts of the Soviet Union, India, the USA, and 
China (Figure 7 24, previous page) do not show systematic 
long-term changes Although this does not represent 
anything like a global picture, it would be difficult to 
envisage a worldwide systematic change in variability 
without any of these diverse regions participating It is 
noteworthy that the extended period of drought in the Sahel 
(Figure 7 16) between 1968 and 1987 exhibited a 
decreased interannual variability of rainfall compared 
with the previous 40 years even though the number of 
stations used remained nearly the same 
7.11.3 Tropical Cyclones 
Tiopical cyclones derive their energy mainly from the 
latent heat contained in the water vapour evaporated from 
the oceans As a general rule, for tropical cyclones to be 
sustained, SSTs must be at or above 26°C to 27°C at the 
present time Such values are confined to the tropics, as 
well as some subtropical regions in summer and autumn 
The high temperatures must extend through a sufficient 
depth of ocean that the wind and wave action of the storm 
itself does not prematurely dissipate its energy source For 
a tropical cyclone to develop, its parent disturbance must 
be about 7° of latitude or more lrom the equator Many 
other influences on tropical cyclones exist which are only 
partly understood Thus ENSO modulates the frequency of 
tropical storms in some regions for example over the 
north-west Pacific, mainly south of Japan (Li, 1985, 
Yoshino, 1990), East China (Fu and Ye, 1988) and in the 
central and southwest Pacific (Revell and Gaulter 1986) 
The reader is referred to Nicholls (1984), Gray (1984), 
Emanuel (1987) and Raper (1990) tor more detail 
Have tropical cyclone frequencies or their intensities 
increased as the globe has warmed over this century' 
Current evidence does not support this idea perhaps 
because the warming is not yet large enough to make its 
impact felt In the North Indian Ocean the frequency of 
tropical storms has noticeabl) decreased since 1970 (Figure

Data in (b) is less reliable before about 1950 
7 25) while SSTs have risen here since 1970, probably 
more than in any other region (Figure 7 13) See also Raper 
(1990) There is little trend in the Atlantic, though 
pronounced decadal variability is evident over the last 
century There have been increases in the recorded 
frequency of tropical cyclones in the eastern North Pacific, 
the southwest Indian Ocean, and the Australian region 
since the late 1950s (not shown) However, these increases 
are thought to be predominantly artificial and to result from 
the introduction of better monitoring procedures 
Relatively good records of wind speed available from the 
North Atlantic and western Pacific oceans do not suggest 
that there has been a change toward more intense storms 
either 
7.11.4 Temporales of Central A menca 
Temporales are cyclonic tropical weather systems that 
affect the Pacific side of Central America and originate in

2?? 
the Pacific Inter-tropical Convergence Zone Very heavy 
rainfall totals over several days occur with these systems, 
but unlike hurricanes their winds are usually weak Their 
atmospheric structure is also quite different Irom that of 
huincanes as they possess a cold mid-troposphenc coie 
Temporales typically last several days, are slow moving 
and cause damaging floods and landslides in the 
mountainous regions of Central America Records of 
temporales are available since the 1950s They were 
markedly more frequent in the eailier than in the later pait 
of this period Thus there was an average of 2 4 temporales 
per year in 1952 1961 (Hastenrath 1988) only 1959 had 
no temporales In 1964-1983 the average reduced to 0 45 
temporales per year and in 12 of these years there were 
none 
When the evidence in Section 7 11 is taken together, we 
conclude that there is no evidence of an increasing 
incidence of extreme events over the last few decades 
Indeed some of the evidence points to recent decreases, for 
example in cyclones over the North Indian Ocean and 
tempoiales over Central America 
7.12 Conclusions 
The most important finding is a warming of the globe since 
the late nineteenth century of 0 45 ± 0 15°C, suppoited by a 
worldwide recession of mountain glaciers A quite similar 
warming has occuired ovei both land and oceans This 
conclusion is based on an analysis of new evidence since 
previous assessments (SCOPE 29 1986) and iepresents a 
small reduction in picvious best estimates of global 
temperature change The most impoitant diagnosis that 
could not be made concerns tempciatuie vanations ovei 
the Southern Ocean 
Recent tiansient model iesults 
(Section 6) indicate that this legion may be lesistant to long 
teim tempeiature change A data set of blended satellite 
and ship SST data is now becoming available and may 
soon piovide an initial estimate of lecent Southern Ocean 
tempeiature changes 
Piecipitation changes have occuned ovei some laige 
land regions in the past centuiy but the data sets aie so pooi 
that only changes of Luge size can be monitoied with any 
confidence 
Some substantial regional atmospheric circulation 
vanations have occuned over the last century notably ovei 
the Atlantic and Europe Regional vanations in temperature 
trends have also been quite substantial This indicates that, 
in futuie regional climatic changes may sometimes be 
quite diverse 
Natural climate vanations have occurred since the end of 
the last glaciation The Little Ice Age in paiticulai 
invoked global climate changes of comparable magnitude 
to the wanning of the last century It is possible that some 
of the wanning since the nineteenth centuiy may icflcct the 
cessation of Little Ice Age conditions The iather rapid 
changes in global temperature seen around 1920 -1940 are 
very likely to have had a mainly natural origin Thus a 
better undcistanding of past variations is essential if we aie 
to estimate reliably the extent to which the wanning ovei 
the last century, and future warming, is the result of an 
increase of greenhouse gases

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Global-mean temperature has increased by 0 3-0 6°C over the past 
100 years The magnitude of this warming is broadly consistent 
with the theoretical predictions of climate models, but it remains 
to be established that the observed warming (or part of it) can be 
attributed to the enhanced greenhouse effect This is the detection 
issue 
If the sole cause ol the warming were the Man-induced 
greenhouse effect, then the implied climate sensitivity would be 
near the lower end of the accepted range of model predictions 
Natural variability ot the climate system could be as large as the 
changes observed to date but there are insufficient data to be able 
to estimate its magnitude or its sign If a significant traction of 
the observed warming were due to natural variability, then the 
implied climate sensitivity would be even lower than model 
predictions However it is possible that a larger greenhouse 
warming has been offset paitially by natural variability and other 
factors, in which case the climate sensitivity could be at the high 
end of model predictions 
Global-mean temperature alone is an inadequate indicator ot 
greenhouse-gas-induced climatic change Identifying the causes 
of any global-mean temperature change requires examination of 
other aspects of the changing climate, particularly its spatial and 
temporal characteristics 
Currently, there is only limited 
agreement between model predictions and observations Reasons 
for this include the fact that climate models are still in an early 
stage of development, our inadequate knowledge of natural 
variability and other possible anthropogenic effects on climate, 
and the scarcity of suitable observational data, particularly long, 
reliable time series An equally important problem is that the 
appropriate experiments, in which a realistic model of the global 
climate system is forced with the known past history of 
greenhouse gas concentration changes, have not yet been 
performed 
Improved prospects for detection requne a long tenn 
commitment to comprehensively monitoring the global climate 
system and potential climate forcing factors and to reducing 
model uncertainties In addition there is consideiable scope lor 
the refinement of the statistical methods used for detection We 
therefore recommend that a compiehensive detection strategy be 
lomiulated and implemented in order to improve the prospects lor 
detection This could be facilitated by the setting up ol a fully 
integrated international climate change detection panel to 
coordinate model experiments and data collection eltorts directed 
towards the detection problem 
Quantitative detection of the enhanced greenhouse effect using 
objective means is a vital research area, because it is closely 
linked to the reduction of uncertainties in the magnitude of the 
effect and will lead to increased confidence in model projections 
The fact that we are unable to reliably detect the predicted signals 
today does not mean that the greenhouse theory is wiong or that 
it will not be a serious problem for mankind in the decades ahead

8.1 Introduction 
8.1.1 The Issue 
This chapter addresses the question Have we detected the 
greenhouse effect' , or, stated more correctly, have we 
detected changes in climate that can, with high statistical 
confidence, be attributed to the enhanced greenhouse effect 
associated with increasing trace gas concentrations9 It is 
important to answer this question, because detecting the 
enhanced greenhouse effect will provide direct validation 
of models of the global climate system Until we can 
identify aspects of greenhouse gas induced changes in the 
observed climate record with high confidence, there will 
always be doubts about model validity and hence about 
even the most general predictions of future climatic 
change Even when detection has occurred uncertainties 
regarding the magnitude and spatial details of futuie 
changes will still remain 
Previous reviews of the greenhouse problem (N R C 
1983, MacCracken and Luther, 1985 Bolin et al 
1986) 
have also addressed the detection issue They have 
concluded that the enhanced greenhouse effect has not yet 
been detected unequivocally in the observational record 
However, they have also noted that the global mean 
temperature change over the past 100 years is consistent 
with the greenhouse hypothesis, and that theie is no 
convincing observational evidence to suggest that the 
model-based range of possible climate sensitivity ' values 
is wrong The purpose ol the present review is to re 
evaluate these conclusions in the light of more recent 
evidence 
8.1.2 The Meaning Of "Detection " 
The word "detection 
has been used to leler to the 
identification of a significant change in climate (such as an 
upward trend in global mean temperature) 
However 
identifying a change in climate is not enough for us to 
claim that we have detected the enhanced gi eenhouse 
effect, even if statistical methods suggest that the change is 
statistically significant (I e extremely unlikely to have 
occurred by chance) To claim detection in a useful and 
practical way, we must not only identify a climatic change, 
but we must attribute at least part of such a change to the 
enhanced greenhouse effect It is in this stricter sense that 
the word "detection is used here Detection requires that 
the observed changes in climate are in accord with detailed 
model predictions of the enhanced greenhouse effect, 
demonstrating that we understand the cause or causes of 
the changes 
1 Climate sensiti\ it\ is defined heie as the eqmlibi nun 
global-mean tempeiatme change foi a CO2 doubling 
(AT2\) &T2\ ls thought to he in the tanqe 1 5°C to 
4 5°C (see Section 5) 
To illustrate this important dilterence consider changes 
in global-mean temperature A number ol recent analyses 
have claimed to show a statistically significant warminj. 
trend over the past 100 years (Hansen et al 1988 Tsionis 
and Eisner, 1989, Wigley and Raper 1990) 
But is this 
warming trend due to the enhanced greenhouse effect' We 
have strong evidence that changes of similar magnitude and 
rate have occurred prior to this century (see Section 7) 
Since these changes were certainly not due lo the enhanced 
greenhouse effect, it might be argued that the most ieccni 
changes merely represent a natuial 
long-time-scale 
fluctuation 
The detection problem can be conveniently described in 
terms of the concepts of signal and noise (Madden and 
Ramanathan 1980) Here the signal is the predicted time 
dependent climate response to the enhanced greenhouse 
effect The noise is any climatic variation that is not due to 
the enhanced greenhouse effect : Detection requires that 
the observed signal is large relative to the noise In 
addition in order to be able to attribute the detected signal 
to the enhanced greenhouse effect it should be one that is 
specific to this particular cause Global mean warming foi 
example is not a particularly good signal in this sense 
because there are many possible causes of such warming 
8.1.3 
Consistency 
Of The Observed 
Global-Mean 
Warming With The Greenhouse Hypothesis 
Global-mean temperature has incieased by around 0 3-
0 6°C over the past 80-100 years (see Section 7) At the 
same time, greenhouse gas concentrations have inci eased 
substantially (Section 1) Is the warming consistent with 
these increases7 To answer this question we must model 
the effects of these concentration changes on global-mean 
temperature and compaie the results with the obseivations 
Because of computing constraints and because of the 
relative inflexibility of coupled ocean atmospheie GCMs 
we cannot use such models for this purpose Instead we 
must use an upwellmg-ditfusion climate model to account 
foi damping or lag efiect of the oceans (see Section 6) 
The response of such a model is deteimined mainly by the 
climate sensitivity (AT2\) the magnitude of ocean mixing 
(specified by a diffusion coefficient K) and the latio of the 
temperature change in the regions ol sinking watei relative 
to the global-mean change (JC) Uncertainties in these 
parameters can be accounted for by using a range of \alues

Figure 8.1: Observed global-mean tcmpcrutuie changes (1861 1989) compaied with predicted values The observed changes are as 
given in Section 7 smoothed to show the decadal and longer time scale trends more cleaily Predictions are based on observed 
concentiation changes and concentiaiion/forcing lelationships given in Section 2 and have been calculated using the upwelhng 
diffusion climate model of Wigley and Raper (1987) To provide a common ieteience level modelled and observed data have been 
adjusted to have zero mean over 1861 1900 To illustrate the sensitivity to model parameters model results are shown for AT2X = 1,' 
3 4 and VC (all panels) and for four K, 7t combinations The top left panel uses the values recommended in Section 6 (K = 
0 6^cm2sec ', 71 =1) Since sensitivity to K is relatively small and sensitivity to 71 is small for small AT2X. the best fit AT2X depends 
little on the choice of K and 71 
The model is forced from 176S-1990 using concentration 
consistent with the observations on the century time-scale 
changes and radiative forcing/concentration relationships 
Agreement on long time-scales is about all that one might 
given in Section 2 
expect On shorter time-scales, we know that the climate

model parameter values with the observed warming ovei

greenhouse forcing 
Although we cannot explain the

observed shorter time-scale lluctuations in detail, their 
magnitude is compatible with our undei standing ol natural 
climatic variability 
Essentially, they reflect the noise 
against which the greenhouse signal has to be detected 
While the decadal time-scale noise is clear, there may 
also be substantial century time-scale noise 
This noise 
makes it difficult to inter a value of the climate sensitivity 
from Figure 8 1 Internal variability arising iiom the 
modulation of random atmospheric disturbances by the 
ocean (Hasselmann, 1976) may produce warming or 
cooling trends of up to 0 3°C per century (Wigley and 
Raper, 1990, see Figure 8 2), while ocean circulation 
changes and the effects of other external forcing factors 
such as volcanic eruptions and solar irradiance changes

Figure 8.2: Simulated natural variability ot global mean 
temperature The upper panel shows results from the 100 year 
control run with the coupled ocean/atmosphere GCM ot Stoutter 
et al (1989) These data are also shown in Figure 6 2 The lower 
two panels are 100 year sections from a 100 000 year simulation 
using the upwelling-diffusion model employed in Figure 8 1 with 
the same climate sensitivity as the Stouffer et al model (ATTX = 
4°C) The upwellmg diffusion model is forced with random inter 
annual radiative changes chosen to match observed inter annual 
variations in global-mean temperature (Wigley and Raper 1990) 
The consequent low frequency variability arises due to the 
modulating effect of oceanic thermal inertia Most 100 yeai 
sections are similar in chaiactei to the middle panel and are 
qualitatively indistinguishable from the coupled 
ocean/atmospheie GCM results However a significant fraction 
show century time scale trends as huge oi laigei than that in the 
lower panel Longer GCM simulations may therefore icveal 
similar centuiy time scale vai lability 
and/or other anthropogenic factors (sec Section 2) could 
produce trends of similar magnitude On time-scales ol 
order a decade, some of these (volcanic eruptions sulphate 
aerosol derived cloud albedo changes) clearly have a 
negative forcing effect, while others have uncertain sign II 
the net century time-scale effect of all these non 
greenhouse factors were close to zero, the climate 
sensitivity value implied by Figure 8 1 would be in the 
range 1 °C to 2°C If their combined effect were a warming 
then the implied sensitivity would be less than 1°C, while it 
it were a cooling the implied sensitivity could be largei 
than 4°C The range of uncertainty in the value of the 
sensitivity becomes even larger if uncertainties in the 
observed data (Section 7) are accounted for 
From this discussion, one may conclude that an 
enhanced greenhouse effect could already be present in the 
climate record, even though it cannot yet be reliably 
detected above the noise of natural climatic vai lability The 
goal of any detection strategy must be to achieve much 
more than this 
It must seek to establish the credibility ol 
the models within relatively narrow limits and to reduce 
our uncertainty in the value of the climate sensitivity 
parameter In this regard, global-mean temperature alone is 
an inadequate indicator of greenhouse gas induced climatic 
change 
Identifying the causes of any 
global-mean 
temperature change requires examination of other aspects 
of the changing climate, particularly its spatial and 
temporal characteristics 
8.1.4 Attribution And The Fingerprint 
Method 
Given our rudimentary understanding of the magnitude and 
causes of low-frequency natural variability it is virtually 
impossible to demonstrate a cause-effect ielationship with 
high confidence 
from studies of a single variable 
(However, if the global warming becomes sufficiently 
large, we will eventually be able to claim detection simply 
because there will be no other possible explanation) 
Linking cause and effect is refeired to as 
attribution 
This is the key issue in detection studies - we must be able 
to attribute the observed changes (or part ot them) to the 
enhanced greenhouse effect Confidence in the attribution 
is increased as predictions of changes 
in 
various 
components of the climate system aie borne out by the 
observed data in more and more detail 
The method 
proposed for this purpose is the 
fingerprint method 
namely, identification of an observed multivariate signal ' 
that has a structure unique to the predicted enhanced 
greenhouse effect (Madden and Ramanathan 1980 Baker 
and Barnett, 1982, MacCracken and Moses 
1982) The

current scientific focus in the detection issue is thereloic on 
multivariate or fingerprint analyses The fingerprint method 
is essentially a form of model validation, wheie the 
perturbation experiment that is being used to test the 
models is the currently uncontrolled emission of 
greenhouse gases into the atmosphere The method is 
discussed further in Section 8 3 First, however, we 
consider some of the more general issues of a detection 
strategy 
8.2 Detection Strategies 
8.2.1 Choosing Detection Variables 
There are many possible climate elements or sets of 
elements that we could study to try to detect an enhanced 
greenhouse effect In choosing the ones to study, the 
following issues must be considered 
the strength of the predicted signal and the ease with 
which it may be distinguished from the noise, 
uncertainties in both the predicted signal and the noise, 
and 
the availability and quality of suitable observed data 
8 2 11 Signal to noise tatios 
The signal-to-noise ratio provides a convenient criterion for 
ranking different possible detection variables The stronger 
the predicted signal relative to the noise, the better the 
variable will be for detection purposes, all other things 
being equal For multivariate signals, those for which the 
pattern of natural variability is distinctly different from the 
pattern of the predicted signal will automatically have a 
high signal-to noise ratio 
Signal to-noise ratios have been calculated tor a number 
of individual climate elements from the results of lxCCb 
and 2xCC>2 equilibrium experiments using atmospheric 
GCMs coupled to mixed-layei oceans (Bainett and 
Schlesinger 1987, Santer et al , 1990 Schlesinger ct al 
1990) The highest values were obtained lor free 
troposphere temperatures, near-surface tempeiatures 
(including sea-surface temperatures), and lower to middle 
troposphenc water vapour content (especially in tropical 
regions) 
Lowest values were iound for mean sea level 
pressure and precipitation 
While these results may be 
model dependent, they do provide a useful preliminary 
indicator of the relative values of different elements in the 
detection context 
Variables with distinctly difleient signal and noise 
patterns may be difficult to find (Bamett and Schlesinger, 
1987) There are reasons to expect parallels between the 
signal and the low-frequency noise patterns at least at the 
zonal and seasonal levels, simply because such char 
actenstics anse through feedback mechanisms that are 
common to both greenhouse forcing and natural variability 
82 I 2 Signal umeitauities 
Clearly a vanable toi which the signal is highly uncertain 
cannot be a good candidate as a detection variable 
Predicted signals depend on the models used to produce 
them 
Model-to-model differences (Section 5) point 
strongly to laige signal uncertainties Some insights into 
these uncertainties may also be gained from studies ol 
model results in attempting to simulate the present-day 
climate (see Section 4) A poor representation of the 
present climate would indicate greater uncertainty in the 
predicted signal (e g , Mitchell et al , 1987) Such 
uncertainties tend to be largest at the regional scale because 
the processes that act on these scales are not accurately 
represented or paiametenzed in the models Even if a 
particular model is able to simulate the present-day climate 
well, it will still be difficult to estimate how well it can 
define an enhanced greenhouse signal 
Nevertheless, 
validations of simulations ol the present global climate 
should form at least one of the bases for the selection of 
detection variables 
A source of unccitainty hcie is the difference between 
the results of equilibrium and transient experiments (see 
Section 6) Studies using coupled ocean-atmosphere GCMs 
and time-varying CO2 loicing have shown reduced 
warming in the aieas of deep water formation (1 e , the 
North Atlantic basin and around Antarctica) compared with 
equilibrium results (Bryan ct al , 1988, Washington and 
Mcehl, 1989, Stouffer et al , 1989) These experiments 
suggest that the regional patterns of temperature change 
may be more complex than those predicted by equilibrium 
simulations The results of equilibrium experiments must 
therefore be considered as only a guide to possible signal 
structuie 
The most reliable signals aie likely to be those related to 
the largest spatial scales Small-scale details may be 
eliminated by spatial averaging, or, more generally by 
using filters that pass only the larger scale (low wave 
number) components (Note that some relatively small-
scale features may be appropriate for detection purposes, if 
model confidence is high ) An additional benefit of spatial 
averaging or filtenng is that it results in data compression 
(1 e , reducing the dimensionality of the detection variable), 
which facilitates statistical testing Data compression may 
also be achieved by using linear combinations of variables 
(e g , Bell, 1982, 1986, Kaioly, 1987, 1989) 
8 2 13 Noise unteitamties 
Since the expected man-made climatic changes occur on 
decadal and longer time-scales, it is largely the low-
frequency characteristics of natural variability that are 
important in defining the noise Estimating the magnitude 
of low frequency variability presents a major problem 
because of the shoitness and incompleteness of most 
8 Detec Hon of the Gi eenhouse Effcc t in the Obsei \ atiom 
249 
instrumental records This problem applies particularly to 
new satellite-based data sets 
In the absence ol long data senes, statistical methods 
may be used to estimate the low frequency variability 
(Madden and Ramanathan, 1980, Wigley and Jones, 1981), 
but these methods depend on assumptions which introduce 
their own uncertainties (Thiebaux and Zwiers, 1984) The 
difficulty arises because most climatological time-series 
show considerable persistence, in that successive yearly 
values are not independent, but often 
significantly 
correlated Serially correlated data show enhanced low 
frequency variability which can be difficult to quantily 
As an alternative to statistically-based estimates, model 
simulations may be used to estimate the low-frequency 
variability, either for single variables such as global-mean 
temperature (Robock, 1978, Hansen et al , 1988, Wigley 
and Raper, 1990) or lor the full three-dimensional character 
of the climate system (using long simulations with coupled 
ocean-atmosphere GCMs such as that of Stouller et al , 
1989) 
Internally-generated changes in global-mean 
temperature based on model simulations are shown in 
Figure 8 2 
82 14 Obsei\eddata 
a\ailabiht\ 
The final, but certainly not the least important factor in 
choosing detection variables is data availability This is a 
severe constraint loi at least two reasons, the definition of 
an evolving signal and the quantification of the low-
frequency noise Both iequire adequate spatial coverage 
and long record lengths, commodities that are rarely 
available Even for surlace vaiiables global scale data sets 
have only recently become available (see Section 7) 
Useful upper air data extend back only to the 1950s and 
extend above 50mb (i e , into the lowci stratosphere) only 
in recent years Comprehensive three-dimensional coverage 
of most variables has become available only recently with 
the assimilation ol satellite data into model-based analysis 
schemes 
Because such data sets are produced for 
meteorological purposes (e g model initialisation), not for 
climatic purposes such as long-term trend detection, they 
contain residual inhomogeneilies due to changes in 
instrumentation and liequent changes in the analysis 
schemes In short, we have very lew adequately observed 
data variables with which to conduct detection studies It is 
important therefore to ensure that existing data senes are 
continued and observational programmes are maintained in 
ways that ensure the homogeneity of meteorological 
records 
8.2.2 Univariate Detection Methods 
A convenient way to classify detection studies carried out 
to date is in terms ol the number ol elements (oi vaiiables) 
considered, i e , as univariate or multivaiiate studies The 
key characteristic ol the foimei is that the detection 
variable is a single time series Almost all published 
univariate studies have used tempeutuie averaged over a 
large area as the detection parametei A cential pioblem in 
such studies is defining the noise level I e , the low 
Irequency variability (see 8 2 13) 
There have been a number of published variations on the 
univariate detection theme One such has been iclened to 
as the noise reduction method In this method theeflectsol 
other external forcing lactors such as volcanic activity 
and/or solar irradiance changes or internal factors such as 
ENSO are removed from the record in some deteimmistic 
(i e , model-based) or statistical way (Hansen et al 1981 
Gilhland 1982 Vinmkov and Groisman 1982 Gilhland 
and Schneider. 1984 Schonwiese 1990) This method is 
fraught with uncertainty because the history ol past 
forcings is not well known 
Theic are no dncct 
observations of these forcing factois and they have been 
inferred in a variety of different ways leading to a number 
of different forcing histones (Wigley et al 
1985 
Schonwiese, 1990) The noise reduction pnnciple 
however, is important Continued monitoring ol any ol the 
factors that might influence global climate in a 
deterministic way (solar irradiance, stratospheric and 
troposphenc aerosol concentrations, etc ) can make a 
significant contribution to facilitating detection in the 
future 
As noted above in the case of global-mean temperature 
univariate detection methods suffer because they consider 
change in only one aspect of the climate system Change in 
a single element could result from a variety of causes 
making it difficult to attribute such a change specilically to 
the enhanced greenhouse effect 
Nevertheless it is useful 
to review recent changes in a number ol variables in the 
light of current model piedictions (see also Wood 1990) 
8.2.3 Evaluation Of Recent Climate Changes 
8 2 3 1 Int i ease of global mean tempt i alia c 
The primary response ol the climate system to mcieasing 
greenhouse gas concentrations is expected to be a global-
mean waiming of the lower layers ol the atmospheic In 
Section 8 13 the observed global mean wanning ol 0 3-
0 6°C ovei the past century or so was compared with model 
predictions It was noted that the obscived wanning is 
compatible with the enhanced greenhouse hypothesis but 
that we could not claim to have detected the gieenhousc 
effect on this basis alone It was also noted that the dnectly 
implied climate sensitivity (i e the value of Al2\) was at 
the low end ol the expected range, but that the plethora ol 
uncertainties surrounding an empirical estimation ol AT?\ 
piecludes us drawing any lirm quantitatisc conclusions 
The observed global warming is tar liom being a steady 
monotonic upward trend but this does not mean that we 
should ie)cct the gieenhouse hypothesis Indeed although 
oui understanding ol natural climatic \ailability is siill 
250 
Detec turn of the Gieenhouse Effec t in the Obsei \ations 8 
quite limited, one would certainly expect substantial natural 
fluctuations to be superimposed on any greenhouse-related 
warming trend 
82 3 2 Enhanced hn>h-Iatitude waimms, paituulaih 
in 
the u intei half-yeai 
Most model simulations suggest that the warming north of 
50°N in the winter half of the year should be enhanced due 
to feedback effects associated with sea-ice and snow cover 
(Manabe and Stouffer, 1980, Robock, 1983, Ingram et al, 
1989) In the Southern Hemisphere, results from sim-
ulations with atmospheric GCMs coupled to ocean GCMs 
do not show this enhancement (Bryan et al , 1988, 
Washington and Meehl, 1989, Stoutlei et al , 1989) 
Figures 8 3 and 8 4 show observed annual and winter 
temperature changes for various latitude bands Over the 
past 100 years, high northern latitudes have warmed 
slightly more than the global mean, but only in winter and 
spring Since the 1920s, however, the annual-mean 
temperature for the area north of 50°N shows almost no 
trend, except in recent years Summer and autumn 
temperatures have actually cooled since the mid to late

1930s High-latitude Southern Hemisphere data are 
inadequate to make any meaningful comparisons 
The observed northern high-latitude winter enhancement 
is broadly consistent with model predictions However, 
some of the latitudinal and seasonal details of observed 
temperature changes are contrary to equilibrium model 
predictions This result has little bearing on the detection 
issue for two reasons First, the variability of temperatures 
in high latitudes is greater than elsewhere and published 
calculations have shown that this is not an optimum region 
for signal detection 
based on signal-to-noise ratio 
considerations (Wigley and Jones, 1981) Second, there are 
still considerable doubts about the regional and seasonal 
details of the evolving greenhouse signal Failure to 
identify a particular spatial pattern of change could be 
because the signal has not yet been correctly specified, 
although it is equally likely to be because the noise still 
dominates

82 3 3 Tioposplwiic wainum> and \tiatospheiit toolim> 
All equilibrium model simulations show a wanning to near 
the top of the troposphere (Section 5) Trends near the 
tropopause and for the lowei stiatosphere, at least up to 
50mb, differ in sign between models Above 50mb, all 
models show a cooling It has been suggested that this 
contrast in trends between the troposphere and stratospheie 
might provide a useful detection fingerprint (Epstein, 1982, 
Parker, 1985, Karoly 
1987, 1989), but this is not 
necessarily the case lor a number of reasons First, 
identification of such a signal is hampered because 
observations above 50mb are of limited duration and 
generally of poorer quality than those in the troposphere 
Second, there arc reasons to expect natural variability to 
show a similar contrast between stratospheric and 
troposphenc trends (Liu and Schuurmans 1990) 
Stratospheric cooling alone has been suggested as an 
important detection vanable, but its interpretation is 
difficult because it may be caused by a number ol other 
factors, including volcanic eiuptions and 07one depletion 
Furthermore, the physics of gieenhouse gas induced 
stratospheric cooling is much simplei than that of 
troposphenc wanning It is quite possible for models to 
behave correctly in then stiatosphenc simulations yet be 
seriously in error in the lower atmospheie Validation of 
the stratospheric component of a model while of scientific 
importance, may be of little relevance to the detection of an 
enhanced greenhouse eltect in the tioposphere 
Nevertheless, there is broad agieement between the 
observations and equilibrium model simulations While the 
observations (Angell 1988) show a global-mean cooling 
tiend from 1958 between lOOhPa and ^OOhPa (Section 7, 
Figure 7 17), which appears to conflict with model results 
this cooling is apparent only between 10 and 10°N (where 
it is not statistically significant) and south of 60°S (wheic it 
is associated with the ozone hole) There are no noticeable 
trends in other regions Data compiled by Karoly (1987 
1989) show a warming trend since 1964 up to aiound 
200hPa in the Southern Hcmispheic to lOOhPa in the 
Northern Hemisphere to 60°N and a moie complex (but 
largely warming) behaviour north ol 60°N Near the 
tiopopause and in the lowci stiatosphere tempeiatuics 
have cooled since 1964 The main diffeience between 
recent observations and model simulations is in the level at 
which warming reverses to cooling Although the models 
show large model-to-model differences, this level is 
generally lower in the observations This diffeience may 
be associated with poor vertical resolution and the 
inadequate representation of the tiopopause in current 
climate models 
8 2 14 Global-mean pi et ipitation mc i ease 
Equilibrium expenments with GCMs suggest an inciease 
in global-mean precipitation as one might expect from the 
associated increase in atmosphenc tempciattire However 
the spatial details of the changes aie highly unceilain 
(Schlesinger and Mitchell 
1987, and Section 5) 
Observations liom which the long term change in 
precipitation can be determined are available only ovei 
land aieas (see Bradley et al , 1987, Did/ et al , 1989, and 
Section 7), and there are major data problems in teims of 
coverage and homogeneity These difficulties, coupled with 
the recognized model deficiencies in their simulations of 
precipitation and the likelihood that the precipitation 
signal-to-noise ratio is low (see 82 1 1), preclude any 
meaningful comparison 
8 2 3 5 Sea le\ el 11 se 
Increasing greenhouse gas concentrations are expected to 
cause (and have caused) a rise in global-mean sea level 
due partly to oceanic thermal expansion and paitly to 
melting of land-based ice masses (see Section 9) Because 
of the strong dependence of sea level rise on global mean 
temperatuie change, this element, like global mean pre-
cipitation, cannot be considered as an independent variable 
Observdtions show that global-mean sea level has risen 
over the past 100 years, but the magnitude of the rise is 
uncertain by a factor of at ledst two (see Section 9) As fdr 
ds it cdn be judged, there hds been d positive thermdl 
expansion component of this sea level rise Observational 
evidence (e g , Meier, 1984, Wood, 1988) shows that there 
has been a general long term retreat of small glacicis (but 
with mdrked regional and shorter time-scale variability) 
and this process has no doubt contributed to sea level rise 
Both thermal expansion and the melting of small glaciers 
are consistent with global warming, but neither provides 
any independent information about the cause of the 
warming 
82 3 6 Tiopospheiu watei \apow nun use 
Model predictions show an increase in tioposphenc water 
vapour content in association with mcieasing atmosphenc 
temperature This is ol consideiable impoitance since it is 
responsible for one ol the main feedback mechanisms that 
amplifies the enhanced greenhouse effect (Raval and 
Ramanalhan 1989) Furthermore, a model-based signal to 
noise ratio analysis (see Section 8 2 11) suggests that this 
may be a good detection variable Howevci the brevity of 
avdildble lecords and data inhoinogeneities preclude any 
conclusive assessment of trends The available data have 
inhomogeiieities due to major changes in radiosonde 
humidity instrumentation Since the mid 1970s iheic has 
been an apparent upward trend, largest in the tropics (Flohn 
and Kapala 1989 Elliott et al 
1990) Howevci the 
magnitude of the tropical trend is much larger than anv 
expected gieenhouse-ielated change, and it is likely lhal 
natural vailability is dominating the recoid

8.3 Multivariate or Fingerprint Methods 
8.3.1 Conspectus 
The lingcrpnnt method, which involves the simultaneous 
use ol more than one time series, is the only way that the 
attribution problem is likely to be solved expeditiously In 
its most general form one might consider the time 
evolution ol a set of three-dimensional spatial fields, and 
compare model results (I e , the signal to be detected) with 
observations There are, however, many potential dill 
lculties both in applying the method and in interpreting the 
results, not the least of which is reliably defining the 
greenhouse-gas signal and showing a prion that it is 
unique 
In studies that have been perlormed to date, predicted 
changes in the three-dimensional structure ol a single 
variable (mean values, variances and/or spatial patterns) 
have been compared with observed changes The com 
panson involves the testing ol a null hypothesis 
namely 
that the observed and modelled fields do not differ 
Rejection ol the null hypothesis can be interpreted in 
several ways It could mean that the model pattern was not 
present in the observations (1 e in simplistic tcims that 
there was no enhanced greenhouse el feet) or that the signal 
was obscured by natural variability or that the piediction 
was at fault in some way, due eithei to model eirois oi 
because the chosen prediction was inappropriate We know 
a prion that current models have numerous deficiencies 
(see Sections 4 and 5), and that even on a global scale, the 
piedicted signal is probably obscuied by noise (Section 
8 I 1) Furthermore, most studies to date have only used 
the results ol equilibrium simulations lather than the more 
appropnate time-dependent results ol coupled ocean-
atmosphcic GCM experiments 4 Because of these factors 
published woik in this area can onl\ be considered as 
exploiatory, dnected largely towaids testing the methods 
and investigating potential statistical problems 
8.3.2 Comparing Changes In Means And Variances 
Means, time vanances and spatial variances ol the fields of 
observed and predicted changes have been compared loi a 
number of vanables by Sanlci ct al (1990) Predicted 
changes were estimated from the equilibrium lxCCb and 
2xC02 simulations using the Oicgon State University 
(OSU) atmospheric GCM coupled to a mixed layer ocean 
(Schlesinger and Zhao, 1989) In all cases (different 
vanables, different months) the observed and modelled 
fields wcie found to be significantly different I e , for these

e\peiunents ma\ be lequucd in oulei to ensuie that 
iepic sentatne iesults aie obtained 
tests the null hypothesis of no difference was rejected and 
the model signal could not be identified in the observations 
As noted above this is not an unexpected result 
8.3.3 Pattern Correlation Methods 
The basic approach in pattern correlation is to compare the 
observed and modelled time-averaged patterns of change 
(or changing observed and modelled patterns) using a 
correlation coellicient or similar statistic The word 
"pattern is used in a very general sense - it may refer to a 
two point pattern involving two time series of the same 
vanable or to a many-point pattern involving the full three-
dimensional spatial fields of more than one variable In 
some studies time-standaidi7ed variables have been used 
This has the advantage ol giving greater emphasis to those 
spatial legions in which the time variance (l e , the noise) is 
smallest 
Four examples ol pattern correlation detection studies 
have appeared in the literature, all involving compansons 
of observed and modelled temperature changes (Barnett, 
1986, Barnett and Schlesingei, 1987, Barnett, 1990, Santer 
et al , 1990) Barnett (1986) and Barnett and Schlesinger 
(1987) used the covariance between the patterns of 
standardized observed and modelled changes as a test 
statistic Equilibrium lxCO? and 2xCG"2 results from the 
OSU atmospheric GCM coupled to a mixed-layer ocean 
were employed to generate the multivariate predicted 
signal 
This pattern was then correlated with obseived 
changes ielative to a reference year on a year-by-year basis 
A significant trend in the correlation would indicate the 
existence of an increasing expression of the model signal in 
the observed data which could be interpreted as detection 
of an enhanced gieenhouse signal A marginally significant 
trend was appaient, but this was not judged to be a iobust 
result 
Santei et al (1990) used the same model data and the 
spatial coi relation coelfluent between the time-averaged 
patterns ol obseived and piedicted change as a detection 
parameter The observed changes used were the differences 
between two decades 1947 % and 1977-86 Statistically 
significant dillciences between observed and model 
patterns ol temperature change were found in all months 
but February (for which the amount of common vanance 
was very small, less than 4%) 
Barnett (1990) compared observed data with the time-
evolving spatial fields from the GISS transient GCM run 
(Hansen et al , 1988) The model run uses realistic time-
dependent forcing beginning in the year 1958, and accounts 
for the lag effect of oceanic thermal inertia by using a 
diffusion parameterization of heat transport below the 
mixed layer Comparisons were made using spatial 
correlation coefficients between decadal means ol the 
evolving signal and the equivalent pattern in the 
8 Detec twn of the Gi eenhoust Ejjei t in the Ohsei \ attain

observations Theie was virtually no similarity between 
modelled and obscived temperatuie patterns 
The largely negative results obtained in these studies can 
be interpreted in a variety of ways as noted in Section 
8 3 1 Because of this, failure to detect the model signal in 
the data cannot be taken as evidence that there is no 
greenhouse-gas signal in the real world Future multivariate 
detection studies should employ coupled ocean-atmosphere 
GCMs forced with obseived greenhouse-gas concentration 
changes over more than just the past few decades 
8.4 When Will The Greenhouse Effect be Detected ? 
The fact that we have not yet detected the enhanced 
greenhouse eflect leads to the question when is this likely 
to occur7 As noted earlier, detection is not a simple yes/no 
issue Rather it involves the gradual accumulation of 
evidence in suppoit of model predictions, which in parallel 
with improvements in the models themselves, will increase 
our confidence in them and progressively narrow the 
uncertainties regarding such key parameters as the climate 
sensitivity Unceitainties will always remain Predicting 
when a certain confidence level might be reached is as 
dilficult as predicting future climate change - moie so, in 
fact, since it requnes at least estimates of both the future 
signal and the futuie noise level 
Nevertheless, we can provide some information on the 
time-scale for detection by using the 
unprecedented 
change concept mentioned buefly in Section 8 1 4 This 
should provide an upper bound to the time for detection 
since more sophisticated methods should pioduce earlier 
results We take a conservative view as a starting point 
namely that the magnitude of natuial variability is such that 
all of the warming of the past centuiy could be attubuted to 
this cause 
(Note that this is not the same as denying the 
existence of an enhanced greenhouse effect 
With such a 
noise level the past warming could be explained as a 1°C 
greenhouse effect offset by 0 VC natuial variability ) We 
then assume, again somewhat arbitrarily that a fuithei 
0 5°C warming (I e a total wanning ol 1°C since the late 
nineteenth century) is icquned befoie we could say with 
high confidence, that the only possible explanation would 
be that the enhanced gieenhouse el feci was as strong as 
predicted by climate models 
Given the iange of 
uncertainty in futuie forcing predictions and future model-
predicted warming when would this elevated temperatuie 
level be reached17 
The answer is given in Figuie 8 5 The upper curve 
shows the global mean wanning foi the Business-as Usual 
Scenario (see Appendix 1) assuming a set of upwclling 
diffusion climate model parameteis that maximizes the 
warming late (viz , AT2X = 4 5 0 K = 0 63 cm2 sec ' and 
7t = 0) Under these encumstances 
detection (as defined 
above) would occui in 12 yeais The lower cuive shows 
2050 
Figure 8.5: Observed global-mean temperature changes (as in 
Figure 8 1) and extreme predictions of future change If a further 
0 5°C warming were chosen as the threshold for detection of the 
enhanced greenhouse effect then this would be reached sometime 
between 2002 and 2047 In practice, detection should be based on 
more sophisticated methods which would bung these dates closei 
to the present 
the global-mean warming for the lowest toicing Scenaiio 
( D in the Annex) with model parameteis chosen to 
minimize the warming rate (vi/ 
AT2x = 1 *>°C K = 
1 27 cm^ sec-' and n = 1) Detection does not occui until 
2047 
On the basis of this simple analysis alone we might 
conclude that detection with high confidence is unlikely to 
occui before the year 2000 If stimgent contiols aic 
intioduced to reduce future greenhouse gas emissions and 
if the climate sensitivity is at the low end of the range ol 
model predictions then it may be well into the twent\ 
first centui) before we can say with high confidence that 
we have detected the enhanced greenhouse effect 
The time limits inferred from Figure 8 5 aie of couise 
only a rough guide to the future and they aie almost 
certainly upper bound values Nevertheless the time frame 
for detection is likely to be of ordei a decade or more In 
oider to detect the enhanced greenhouse effect within this 
time frame it is essential to continue the development of 
models and to ensure that existing obsciving s>stems for 
both climate vanablcs and potential climate forcing factors 
be maintained oi improved

8.5 CONCLUSIONS 
Because ol the strong theoretical basis for enhanced 
greenhouse warming, there is considerable concern about 
the potential climatic effects that may result 
from 
increasing greenhouse-gas concentrations However, be-
cause of the many significant uncertainties and made 
quacics in the observational climate lecord 
in our 
knowledge of the causes of natural climatic variability and 
in current computer models, scientists working in this field 
cannot at this point in time make the definitive statement 
Yes we have now seen an enhanced greenhouse effect 
It is accepted that global-mean tempeiatuies have 
increased over the past 100 yeais and aic now warmer than 
at any time in the period of instrumental lecord This global 
warming is consistent with the results ol simple model 
predictions ol greenhouse gas induced climate change 
However, a number ol other factors could have contributed 
to this warming and it is impossible to prove a cause and 
effect relationship 
Furthermore when other details of the 
instrumental climate record are compaied with model 
predictions, while there are some areas of agreement theie 
are many areas of disagreement 
The main reasons for this are 
1) 
The inherent variability ol the climate system appears 
to be suificient to obscuie any enhanced gi eenhouse 
signal to date Poor quantitative understanding ot 
low frequency climate vai lability (paiticulaily on the 
10-100 year time scale) leaves open the possibility 
that the observed warming is largely unrelated to the 
enhanced greenhouse ellect 
2) 
The lack of reliability ol models at the regional 
spatial scale means that the expected signal is not yet 
well defined 
This precludes any turn conclusions 
being drawn from multivariate detection studies 
3) 
The ideal model expenments lcquired to define the 
signal have not yet been perloimed What is lequircd 
are time-dependent simulations using realistic time-
dependent forcing earned out with lully coupled 
ocean-atmosphere GCMs 
4) 
Uncertainties in, and the shoitncss ol available 
instrumental data records mean that the low 
frequency characteristics ot natuial variability are 
virtually unknown for many climate elements 
Thus it is not possible at this tunc to attribute all or 
even a large part of the observed global mean warming to 
the enhanced greenhouse ettect on the basis of the 
obseivational data currently available Equally however 
we have no observational evidence that conllicts with the 
model based estimates of climate sensitivity Thus because 
ot model and other uncertainties we cannot pieclude the 
possibility that the enhanced gieenhouse eftcct 
has 
contnbuted substantially to past wanning noi even that the 
«ieenhouse szas induced wanning has been areatei than 
that observed, but is partly offset by natural variability 
and/or other anthropogenic effects

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
This Section addresses three questions 
Has global-mean sea level been rising during the last 100 
years9 
What are the causal factors that could explain a past rise in sea 
level'? 
And what increases in sea level can be expected in the future9 
Despite numerous problems associated with estimates of 
globally coherent, secular changes in sea level based on tide 
gauge records, we conclude that it is highly likely that sea level 
has been rising over the last 100 years There is no new evidence 
that would alter substantially the conclusions of earlier assess-
ments regarding the rate of change Our judgement is that 
The average rate of rise over the last 100 years has been 1 0 
2 0 mm yr ' 
There is no firm evidence ol accelerations in sea level rise 
during this centuiy (although there is some evidence that 
sea level rose faster in this century compared to the 
previous two centuries) 
As to the possible causes and their specilic contributions to 
past sea level rise, the uncertainties are very large, particularly tor 
Antarctica However in general it appears that the observed rise 
can be explained by thermal expansion of the oceans and by the 
increased melting ol mountain glaciers and the margin ot the 
Greenland ice sheet From present data it is impossible to judge 
whether the Antarctic ice sheet as a whole is currently out of 
balance and is contributing, either positively or negatively, to 
changes in sea level 
Future changes in sea level were estimated for each of the 
IPCC forcing scenarios (using the same simple box model as in 
Section 6) For each scenario, three projections - best estimate, 
high and low - were made corresponding to the estimated range of 
uncertainty in each of the potential contributing factors It is 
found that 
For the IPCC Business-as Usual Scenano at yeai 2030 
global-mean sea level is 8 29 cm higher than today, with 
a best-estimate of 18 cm At the year 2070, the rise is 21 -
71 cm, with a best-estimate of 44 cm 
Most of the contribution is estimated to derive from thermal 
expansion of the oceans and the increased melting of 
mountain glaciers and small ice caps 
On the decadal time scale, the role of the polar ice sheets is 
expected to be minor, but they contribute substantially to 
the total uncertainty Antarctica is expected to contnbute 
negatively to sea level due to increased snow accumulation 
associated with warming A rapid disintegration of the 
West Antarctic Ice Sheet due to global wanning is unlikely 
within the next century 
For the lower forcing scenarios (B,C and D) the sets of sea 
level rise projections are similar, at least until the mid 21st 
century 
On average these projections are approximately 
one third lower than those of the Business as Usual 
Scenario 
Even with substantial decreases in the emissions ol the majoi 
greenhouse gases, future increases in temperature and con 
sequently, sea level are unavoidable - a sea level rise 
commitment - due to lags in the climate system 
This present assessment does not foresee a sea level rise of >1 
metre during the next century Nonetheless, the implied rate of 
rise for the best-estimate projection corresponding to the IPCC 
Busmess-as-Usual Scenario is about 3-6 times faster than over the 
last 100 years

26? 
9.1 Sea Level Rise: Introduction 
This section is primarily concerned with decade-to-century 
changes in global-mean sea level, particularly as related to 
climatic change First, the evidence for sea level rise during 
the last 100 years is reviewed as a basis for looking for 
climate-sea level connections on a decade-to-century 
timescale Next, the possible contributing factors - thermal 
expansion of the oceans and the melting of land ice - to 
both past and future sea level change are examined 
Finally, the issue of future sea level due to global warming 
is addressed 
9.2 Factors Affecting Sea Level 
Changes in sea level occur for many reasons on different 
time and space scales Tide gauges measure sea level 
variations in relation to a fixed benchmark and thus record 
"relative sea level" change due both to vertical land 
movements and to real (eustatic) changes in the ocean 
level Vertical land movements result from various natural 
isostatic movements, sedimentation, tectonic processes and 
even anthropogenic activities (e g , groundwater and oil 
extraction) In parts of Scandinavia, for instance, relative 
sea level is decreasing by as much as lm per century due to 
isostatic "rebound" following the last major glaciation In 
attempting to identify a globally-coherent, secular trend in 
MSL, the vertical land movements contaminate 
tide 
gauge records and have to be removed 
Eustatic sea level is also affected by many 1 actors 
Differences in atmospheric pressure, winds, ocean cuncnts 
and density of seawater all cause spatial and temporal 
variations in sea level in relation to the geoid (the surface 
of constant gravitational potential corresponding to the 
surface which the ocean would assume if ocean 
temperature and salinity were everywhere 0°C and 35 o/oo, 
respectively, and surface air pressure was everywheie 
constant) Changes in the geoid itself, due to re-distribution 
of mass within the Earth, are irrelevant on the decadal-
century timescales under consideration 
Over these 
timescales, the most important climate-related factors are 
likely to be thermal expansion of the oceans and melting ol 
land ice (but not floating ice shelves or sea ice) 
9.3 Has Sea Level Been Rising Over the Last 100 
Years? 
It is highly likely that global-mean sea level (MSL) has 
been rising This is the general conclusion of no fewer than 
13 studies of MSL change over various periods during the 
last 100 years (Table 9 1) The estimates range from about 
0 5mm/yr to 3 Omm/yr, with most lying in the range 1 0-
2 Omm/yr

In addition, several assessments of the likely rate ol past 
sea level use have been made 12±5cm since 1900 liom the 
SCOPE 29 assessment (Bohn et al , 1986) 10-25cm since 
1900 from the US DOE assessment (MacCiacken and 
Luther, 1985), and 10-20cm ovei last 100 years from the 
PRB assessment (Polar Research Board, 1985) These 
assessments also include detailed reviews of the literature 
(Bainett, 1985, Aubrey, 1985, Robin, 1986) Rather than 
repeat these, we shall focus on the most recent studies and 
ask whether they provide any new information that would 
substantially alter previous assessments

analysis differed from previous analyses (Gornitz et al , 
1982) by including a mote caielul correction for vertical 
land movements using extensive data lrom 14C dated 
Holocene sea level indicators (see below) This correction 
signiiicantly reduced the spread of the trend estimates from 
the individual stations (Figure 9 1)

composite global MSL cuives (averaging individual 
stations veisus tegional trends), the study obtained 
estimates of 1 2 ± 0 3mm/yr and 1 0 ± 0 lmm/yr 
respectively These results do not differ significantly from 
their previous findings 
The study by Barnett (1988) is an update of previous 
work (Barnett, 1983, 1984) in which 155 stations are 
analysed over the period 1880-1986 A rate ol 1 15mm/yr 
is obtained, in close agreement with the rates noted above

All tide gauge records have been reduced using the standard model 
level curves (Figure 9 2), it is apparent that while Gornitz 
and Lebedeff s curve appears linear over the entire time 
period, Barnett's curve suggests a steeper rate of rise over 
about 1910-1980 - approximately 1 7mm/yr This is more 
nearly in line with estimates of Peltier and Tushingham 
(1990) for the same time period (see Table 9 2) 
Peltier and Tushingham (1989 1990) select a minimum 
record length of 51 years correct the data for ongoing 
glacial isostatic adjustments using a geophysical model 
and analyse the corrected data using both hneai regression 
(LR) techniques and empirical orthogonal function (EOF) 
analyses 
From a final total of 40 stations ovei the tunc 
period 1920-1970, they conclude that the global rate ol sea 
level rise is 2 4 ± 0 9mm/yr This rale is considerably 
higher than ii.ost other estimates noted in Table 9 1 
However, the authors caution that the results are sensitive 
to variations in the analysis procedure As shown in Table 
9 2, variations in either the record length or period of 
record have large eflects on the estimated rate ot rise In 
fact, for all combinations other than then preferred period 
1920-1970 (chosen to maximi/c the number ol stations 
with a minimum 50-year record length) the estimated rates 
are lower and in a numbei ol cases compare favourably 
with those of Gornitz and Lcbedcif (1987) Bamett (1988) 
and Trupin and Wahr (1990) 
Why the differences9 Possible reasons have to do with 
choice of minimum record length, period of record, number 
of stations, geographical representation correction pro-
cedures for vertical land movements, and methods of data 
aggregation and analysis Unfortunately these factors are 
interrelated and not easily isolated from published studies 
Nevertheless, it is significant that, despite the differences 
both the recent and earlier studies all find a positive trend 
in global MSL This seems to be a rather robust finding 
There is however the possibility that all the studies could 
be systematically biased 
9 3 2 Possible Sources of Error 
There are several potential sources ol systematic bias 
common to all such studies Firstly, they make use of the 
same global MSL dataset that of the Permanent Service for 
Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) an International Council ol 
Scientific Unions databank located at the Bidston 
Observatory U K (Pugh et al 1987) The PSMSL collects 
data from approximately 1300 stations worldwide 
However only 850 of these are suitable for time suies 
work (the PSMSL 
Revised Local Reference 
(RLR) 
dataset) and 420 of these arc 20 years oi more in lensth 
Tide gauge records contain many signals other than a 
secular trend These stern primarily from large interannual 
266 
Sea Le\ el Rise 9 
meteoiological and oceanographic forcings on sea level 
and, in principle, can be modelled and thereby removed 
from the record In practice, the variability is such that 
accurate trends can be computed only given 15 20 years of 
data, which significantly reduces the size of the dataset 
available for analysis 
Secondly, there is an historical geographical bias in the 
dataset in favour of Northern Europe, North America and 
Japan Areas of Africa, Asia, ocean islands and polar 
regions are sparsely represented The geogiaphical bias 
inherent in any global dataset will propagate into all 
studies This bias can be ieduced (but not eliminated) by 
treating regional subsets of the dataset as independent 
information, as has been done in the recent studies 
described above 
The problem of geographical bias is now being 
addressed with the establishment of the Global Level of the 
Sea Surface (GLOSS) global tide gauge network 
cooidinated by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic 
Commission (IOC) (Pugh, 1990) Most islands involved 
now have tide gauges and most continental GLOSS stations 
(other than polar sites) are now operational, but much work 
remains to improve standards and the reliability of 
observations 
Finally, perhaps the most important source ol eiror stems 
from the difficulties involved in removing vertical land 
movements from the dataset In addition to the effects 
noted above, most mid-latitude stations located on 
continental margins are especially susceptible to effects 
from sedimentation, groundwater and oil extraction, and 
tectonic influences and could be undergoing general 
submergence, which, unless accounted foi, could introduce 
a positive bias into any global MSL secular trend (Pirazzoli 
et al , 1987) In order to identify a globally-coherent trend 
that can be linked to changes in global climate, such effects 
have to be removed The issue is how to do so 
In the future, the inherent ambiguity between land and 
ocean level changes in a tide gauge record will be solved 
by the use of advanced geodetic methods, but such data are 
not available for present anal} sis (Carter et al , 1989) In 
lieu of new geodetic data, one approach adopted by recent 
analyses has been to model explicitly the expected 
geology-induced MSL changes at each tide gauge site by 
the use of ancillary Holocene data (e g , molluscs, corals, 
peats Gornitz et al , 1982, Gornitz and Lebedeff, 1987) or 
by the use of geodynamic models of the Earth (Peltier and 
Tushingham, 1989, 1990) The other approach is simply to 
assemble a sufficiently broad geographical spread of 
records such that (it is hoped) the net contribution of land 
movements reduces to zero (Barnett 1983 1984 1988) 
These differences in approach probably account 
substantially tor the different results noted in Table 9 1 
But it cannot be said with confidence that vertical land 
movements (or, that is the failure to account adequately for 
them), along with reliance on a single dataset and problems 
ol geographical bias, have not systematically biased all 
studies in the same direction 
9.3.3 Accelerations in Sea Level Rise 
Is there evidence of any "accelerations" (or departures from 
long-term linear trends) in the rate of sea level rise7 From 
examinations of both composite regional and global curves 
and individual tide gauge records, there is no convincing 
evidence of an acceleration in global sea level rise during 
the twentieth century For longer periods, however, there is 
weak evidence for an acceleration over the last 2-3 
centuries 
Long-term analyses are hindered by the scarcity of tide-
gauge iccords longer than 100-120 years Data are limited 
to a few stations in Europe and North Amenca 
Woodwoith (1990) inspected individual tide gauge records 
in Europe and lound that although there is no general 
evidence for an increasing (or decreasing) rate of MSL 
change during the past century, a regionally-coherent 
acceleration ol the older of 0 4mm/year per century is 
apparent over the last 2-3 centuries This finding is 
supported by Gornitz and Solow (1989) who find weak 
evidence for an increase in the trend around 1895 Similar 
conclusions were reached by Ekman (1988) from an 
examination of one of the longest tide-gauge records, at 
Stockholm Extension of such findings to the global scale, 
howevei should be carried out with caution 
We now turn to the possible contributing factors to see if 
we can explain the past use 
9.4 Possible Contributing Factors To Past and Future 
Sea Level Rise 
There are four major climate-related factors that could 
possibly explain a rise in global MSL on the 100-year time 
scale These are 
1) 
thermal expansion of the oceans, 
2) 
glaciers and small ice caps, 
3) 
the Greenland ice sheet, and 
4) 
the Antarctic ice sheet (including the special case of 
the West Antarctic ice sheet) 
In this section, we examine the sensitivity of each factor 
to changes in climate (particularly temperature), and 
estimate its possible contribution to past sea level change 
In the subsequent section, attention is then turned to future 
sea level change 
9.4.7 Thermal Expansion of The Oceans 
At constant mass, the volume of the oceans, and thus sea 
level, will vary with changes in the density of sea-water 
Density is inversely related to temperature Thus as the 
oceans warm, density decreases and the oceans expand - a 
9 Sea Lexel Rise 
267 
steric rise in sea level Marked regional variations in sea 
water density and volume can also result trom changes in 
salinity, but this effect is ielatively minor at the global 
scale 
In order to estimate oceanic expansion (past or future) 
changes in the interior temperature, salinity and density ol 
the oceans have to be considered, either empirically or by 
models Unfortunately, observational data are scant, both 
in time and space (Barnett, 1985) A few recent analyses 
have been carried out on the limited time-series data For 
instance, Roemmich (1985) examined the 1955 1981 
Panuhns series of deep hydrographic stations off Bermuda 
and Thomson and Tabata (1987) examined the Station 
PAPA (northeast Pacific Ocean) steric height anomalies for 
a similar 27-year iecord The latter study tound that open 
ocean steric heights are incieasing linearly at 0 91mm/ycai 
However, in this and other studies the large interannual 
variability creates too much noise to be confident of the 
estimate derived fiom such a short time-senes Moreover 
the limited geographical coverage makes inference to the 
global scale problematic In a few decades current effoits 
such as the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) 
will be begin to fill the data gaps and overcome these 
problems 
An alternative approach could be based on numerical 
models of the ocean s circulation (Barnett, 1985) Ideally, 
detailed three-dimensional models could describe the 
various oceanic mixing processes and could simulate heat 
transfer and expansion eflects throughout the oceans 
However, such models are in the early stages of 
development and applications to problems of global

wanning and theimal expansion aie lew in number A 
drawback of this soit ol model is that the computing time 
lequired precludes numerous runs for sensitivity analyses 
Instead lor the present assessment a simple upwelling-
dilfusion energy-balance climate model is used Typically 
this type of model repiesents the woilds land and oceans 
by a lew boxes 
and complicated piocesscs of oceanic 
mixing are simplified in one or more paiameteis (loi 
review see Hofiert and Flanncry 1985) Such a model was 
used to estimate the transient global warming (see Sections 
6 and 8 for other results and Section 8 lor the justification 
loi using this type of model) The inclusion ol expansion 
coefficients in the model (varying with depth and possibly 
latitude) allows the sea level changes to be estimated as 
well In order to maintain consistency thioughout this 
assessment both past and luture (sec below) theimal 
expansion effects are also estimated with this modelling 
technique beanng in mind that full undcistanding ol the 
dynamic processes and their ellects on the depths and 
timing ol ocean warming will eventually require moic 
physically realistic models 
The model ol Wigley and Raper (1989) was loiced by 
past changes in radiative lorcing due to increasing 
atmospheric concentiations ol greenhouse gases (see 
Section 2) The internal model parameters that most allect 
the output are the diffusivity (K), the sinking water to 
global mean temperature change ratio (K) and the climate 
sensitivity (AT2x> the global-mean equilibrium temperature 
change for a CO? doubling) (see Section 6) In order to 
estimate past thermal expansion effects, the paramctei 
values were constrained to maintain consistency with

Analysis of EGIG data 
EGIG data/retreating margin 
Energy balance calculation 
Energy balance Model 
uncertainty regarding the current state of balance of the ice 
sheet An imbalance of up to 30% of the annual mass 
turnover cannot be excluded 
A lew studies have also been undertaken to detect 
changes in some selected area Along the EGIG line in 
central West Greenland, there is some indication ol slight 
thickening in the interior part of the ice sheet A study 
along the 
Oregon State University line 
in South 
Gieenland suggested a close balance between accumulation 
and ice discharge, at least in the interior part (Kostecka and 
Whillans, 1988) 
On the basis of satellite altimetry Zwally (1989) found 
that the mass balance ol the southern part of the ice sheet 
has been positive in the period 1978 1986 He reports that 
thickening ot the ice sheet occurred in both the ablation and 
accumulation zone (order ol magnitude 0 2 m/yr) 
Although theie aie doubts regaiding the accuracy ol the 
results (Douglas et al 
1990) this work shows the 
enormous potential ot radar altimetry to monitor changes 
on the laige ice sheets 
Most outlet glaciers for which observations exist (this is 
mainly in central and southern part of the west coast of 
Greenland) have retreated strongly over the last century 
(Weidick, 1984) As the retreat occurred in many regions, 
on a ielatively short time scale (100 years), and in a period 
ol signilicant warming in Greenland, increased ablation 
rates must be responsible for this However, the large 
ablation zones of the inland ice must have suffered from 
this too The implications lor past sea level rise will be 
discussed shortly 
A few estimates have been made of the sensitivity of 
Greenland mass balance to climatic change They aie listed 
in Table 9 *> The method of Ambach and Kuhn (1989) is 
based on a new analysis of the EGIG data 
In their 
approach, the mass and energy budget at the equihbiium 
line is expanded with a linear perturbation technique, 
allowing the calculation ol the change in the equilibnum-
line altitude (dELA) associated with small changes in 
temperature, precipitation and radiation By extrapolating 
dELA to the entire ice sheet an estimate can then be made 
ol the change in ablation and accumulation area and by 
9 Sea Lex el Rise 
271 
assigning mass-balance values of the total ice mass budget 
Bindschadler's (1985) calculation is based on the same 
mass-balance measurements, but a (minor) correction is 
made for a retreating ice margin The value listed as 
Oerlemans et al (1990) results Irom a straightforward 
sensitivity test with an energy balance model applied to 
four regions of the ice sheet Braithwaite and Olesen (1990) 
have used an energy balance model to study their ablation 
measurements in southwest Greenland, and attempted to 
extrapolate the result to the entire ablation zone There is a 
reasonable agreement between all those studies, but this is 
partly due to dependence of the input 
Above, only temperature has been considered as a 
climatic input parameter In fact, changes in the seasonal 
cycle, in precipitation and cloud patterns have occurred and 
will occur in the future The potential importance of such 
factors can be studied by sensitivity tests, and some results 
have been listed in Table 9 5 It has been suggested that 
even in the relatively warm climate of Greenland, snow 
accumulation may increase when temperature goes up (e g , 
Reeh and Gundestrup 1985) If annual precipitation would 
increase uniformly by 5CA per degree warming, the 
precipitation effect 
can offset about 30% of the 
temperature effect 
Setting the annual precipitation prop 
ortional to the amount of prccipitabie water in a saturated 
atmospheric column [see Oerlemans and Van der Veen, 
1984, p 140] would imply, for mean conditions over the 
Greenland ice sheet, a 4% increase in precipitation for a 
1°C warming This leads to a best estimate of the 
sensitivity of 0 3 ± 0 2 mm yr ' per degree C The error bar 
is large because 
0 
There 
is considerable 
uncertainty 
on how 
precipitation patterns over Greenland will change in a 
warmer climate 
n) 
It is unknown whethei iceberg calving from the outlet 
glaciers will increase due to increased basal water 
flow (Bindschadler, 1985) However the ice possibly 
involved in rapid retreat of calving fronts is almost 
afloat, so the contribution to sea level rise will be 
negligible Consequent thinning of grounded ice 
further upstream is not likely to affect sea level 
within the next 100 years 
in) 
It is unknown how factors like surface albedo and 
cloudiness will change 
With a record ol mean summer temperatuies the 
sensitivity can be used to produce an estimate of 
Greenland s contribution to past sea level i lse As shown in 
Figure 9 5, the 1866-1980 summer temperatuie departures 
(relative to the 20-year avciage for the leterencc period 
1866-1885) shows an overall wanning ol about 0 5°C 
However the decadal changes are pionounced with a large 
warming of about 2°C occumng up to 1930 35 and a 
cooling trend thereafter By summing the pioduct between

the sensitivity value and the temperature departure for each 
year from 1880-1980, the 100-year contribution to sea level 
is estimated Assuming initial conditions in equilibrium and 
a sensitivity of 0 3 ± 0 2 mm yr ' per degree, the 
summation yields 23 ± 16 mm (or 0 23 ± 0 16 mm yr ') So 
the contribution from Greenland to past sea level rise 
appears to be somewhat less than that fiom glaciers and 
thermal expansion 
9.4.5 The Antarctic Ice Sheet. 
The question of balance of the Antarctic ice sheet proves to 
be a very difficult one From a physical point of view 
regarding the very long time scale introduced by 
geodynamics and thermomechanical coupling in the ice 
sheet, it seems unlikely that the present ice sheet has 
adjusted completely to the last glacial-interglacial 
transition A detailed modelling study by Huybrechts 
(1990), in which a glacial cycle of the Antaictic ice sheet is 
simulated on a 40km grid suggests that the large scale 
imbalance will not be moic than a few peiccnt of the 
annual mass turnover (corresponding to a rate of sea level 
change of less than 0 1 mm yr ') This does not exclude 
the possibility however that climate fluctuations with a 
shorter time scale have pushed the ice sheet out of balance 
Also there is increasing evidence that marine ice sheets 
like the West Antarctic could exhibit pulsating mass 
discharge which is not climate related but may have 
important consequences for sea level 
Budd and Smith (1985) made an assessment of the net 
balance by compiling a set of accumulation and ice 
velout) measurements (Table 9 6) The latter allow to 
make a rough estimate ol the ice discharge fiom the main 
ice sheet across the grounding line vi7 1879 x 10' 2 kg/> i 
They find a number of about 2088 x 10'2 kg/yi lor the 
accumulation and estimate the net balance to be positive b>

Giovinetto and Bentley (1985) state that accumulation over 
the grounded part of the ice sheet is only 1468 x l()'2kg/yr 
With the mean value lor discharge from above, this yields a 
net balance ol -411 x 10'2 kg/yr Fortuin and Oerlemans

this then implies a net balance of 62 x 10'2 kg/yi

measurements involves many uncertainties The latio of 
surface velocity to vertical mean velocity is such an 
unceitain lactor More senously outflow velocities vary 
diamatically from point to point so lateial extrapolation 
and interpolation around the coast mtioduces very large 
eirors A comprehensive companson ot eailiei estimates of 
the surface mass balance was given by Giovinetto and Bull 
(1987) Their discussion suggests that the total surface 
accumulation over grounded ice is not known to an 
accuracy better than 10% When considering the net 
balance, this figure will be worse 
In conclusion, it is unknown whethci the Antarctic ice 
sheet is currently in balance and whether it has been

Seveial methods exist to investigate how accumulation 
on the Antaictic ice sheet may change when tempciatuie 
changes Analysis of the gas content in the deep Antarctic 
ice cores gives an indication of how accumulation varied 
between glacial and interglacial conditions (Lonus et al, 
1984, Jouzel et al , 1989) In fact, it gives support to the 
view that accumulation on the interior is roughly 
proportional to the saturation mixing ratio of water vapour 
in the air above the inversion, as first suggested by Robin 
(1977) 
Another method involves regression analysis on 
measuied tcmpeiatuies and accumulation rates (Muszynski, 
1985, Foituin and Oeilemans 1990) Howevei it is not so 
cleai that a lelation between accumulation and temperatuie 
based on spatial vanation can be applied to climatic 
change It is also possible to use piecipitation rates as 
predicted by gencial cuculation models of the atmosphere 
Although the quality of these models has increased 
giadually, simulation ot the climate of the polar regions 
still shows serious shortcomings (Schlesinger, 1990) and 
the lesults concerning glacier mass balance must be 
considered with much caution So far, a systematic 
companson between obseived accumulation on the ice 
sheets and output fiom such models has not yet been 
published

on a much laigei newly compiled data set, a distinction was 
made between ice shelves escarpment region and mtenor 
Accumulation is strongly related to both tempeiatuie and

Taking this correlation out leads to a 
significantly weaker temperature dependence of the 
accumulation, but it can be argued that this approach is 
preferable when considering climate sensitivity The value 
listed under "proportional to water vapour mixing ratio" 
was calculated by integrating over a 20km grid coveting 
the entire ice sheet with temperatures extrapolated Irom 
the data set used in the multiple regicssion mentioned 
above The values thus obtained arc lather close to the one 
suggested by Muszynski s work 
Support for the idea that higher temperatuics will lead to 
significantly largei accumulation also comes horn obs-
ervations on the Antarctic Peninsula Over the past "?() yeais 
temperature has gone up here by almost 2°C, wheieas 
accumulation increased by as much as 2 W in paiallel with 
this (Peel and Mulvaney, 1988) Although this cannot be 
taken as proof of a causal relationship it is in line with the 
sensitivity estimates listed in Table 9 7 which span a lactoi 
ol two 
In summary, all quoted studies show an inciease in 
accumulation with warming and thus a decrease in sea 
level 
An ablation zone does not effectively exist in 
Antarctica, and a laige wanning would be icquired in older 
for ablation to influence mass balance 
9.4.6 Possible Instability of The West Antarctic Ice Sheet. 
Most of the early attention to the issue ol sea level use and 
greenhouse warming was ielated to the stability ol the 
West Antarctic ice sheet 
Paits of this ice sheet are 
grounded far below sea level and may be very sensitive to 
small changes in sea level or melting iates at the base ol 
ad]acent ice shelves (eg 
Meicei 
1978 Thomas el al 
1979, Lingle 
198^ Van dei Veen 
1986) In case ol a 
climatic warming such melting iates could inciease and 
lead to disappearance ol ice rises (places wheie the floating 
ice shelf runs aground) 
Reduced back stiess on the main 
ice sheet and larger ice velocities may result, with 
subsequent thinning of the grounded ice and grounding-line 
retreat 
It is hard to make quantitative statements about this 
mechanism Several attempts have been made to model this 
ice sheet shelf system and to study its sensitivity (Thomas 
et al, 1979 Lingle, 198^, Van der Veen 1986,1987 Budd 
et al , 1987) 
Van der Veen (1986), in a uithei extensive 
study, concludes that the earlier estimates ol the sensitivity 
of West Antarctica weie too large 
Budd et al (1987) also 
give an extensive discussion on the response ol the West 
Antaictic ice sheet to a climatic wanning Then con 
sideiations are based on a laige numbei of numencal 
experiments with How band models According to these 
experiments vciy laige ice-shell thinning iates (10 to 100 
times piesent values) would be lequned to cause iapid 
disintegiation of the West Antaictic ice sheet 
Foi a 
probably more realistic situation ol a "HYA inciease in ice 
shell thinning late for a one-degiee wanning (older ol 
magnitude) the associated sea level use would be about 
0 lmm/yi foi the coming decades 
Much ol the drainage of the West Antarctic ice sheet 
goes through a number of fast flowing ice streams the 
dynamics ol which were not pioperly included in the 
modelling studies mentioned above 
In recent yeais it has 
become clear from new observational studies (e g 
Bcntley, 1987 Alley et al 
1987 MacAyeal 
1989) that 
those ice streams show much vailability on a century and 
may be even decadal time scale Although much ol this 
variability is probably not related directly to climate 
change it demonstrates the potential of this pait of the ice 
sheet to ieact quickl} to anv change in boundary 
conditions A comprehensive model of the ice streams and 
then interaction with the main ice bod\ does not )ct exist

level change, unpublished), an extreme limit of the 
response of the West Antarctic ice sheet to greenhouse 
warming can be estimated In his view the accelerated 
discharge of ice only occurs in the regions where sufficient 
sub-glacial sediments (the lubricant for the ice streams) is 
present 
For a typical greenhouse warming scenario, the 
bulk of the increased mass outflow would occur between 
100 and 200 years from now, and the actual projected West 
Antarctic contribution to sea level rise would be -10 cm 
alter 100 yrs (increase in surface accumulation still 
dominating), +40 cm after 200 yrs, and +30 cm after 300 
yrs (ice stream discharge stopped) 
In summary, there is no firm evidence to suggest that the 
Antarctic ice sheet in general or the West Antarctic ice 
sheet in particular, have contributed either positively or 
negatively to past sea level rise On the whole, the 
sensitivity of Antarctica to climatic change is such that a 
luture warming should lead to incieased accumulation and 
thus a negative contribution to sea level change 
9.4.7 Other Possible Contributions 
Sea level could also have been attected by net increases or 
decreases in surface and groundwater storage In particular, 
groundwater depletion (through pumping) and drainage of 
swamps, soils and wetlands would contribute to a MSL 
rise On the other hand, increases in surface storage 
capacity - especially large dams but also the combined 
effects of many small reservoirs and farm ponds - would 
detract from sea level 
Decreases in groundwater levels are commonly reported 
trom all over the world from many different environments 
This suggests that total groundwater storage volumes have 
been diminishing, particularly during the last 50 years 
Data are meagre, however One rough estimate (Meier, 
1983, also see Robin, 1986) is that, globally, net depletion 
has amounted to about 2000km3 (equivalent to 0 55cm in 
sea level) during this century Land drainage, particularly 
in Northwest Europe and North America over the last 100 
years, has reduced soil and shallow groundwater storage 
over wide areas, but the actual amounts of water are 
difficult to estimate 
Substantial increases in surface storage have occurred 
since the 1930s Newman and Fairbridge (1986) estimated 
that this has amounted to about 18750km^ (-5 2cm in sea 
level, using 362 x 106km2 for ocean area) over the period 
1932-1982 Golubev (1983, Also see Robin, 1986), 
however, makes a much lower estimate, 5500km3 (-1 5cm 
in sea level) 
Overall, the estimates appear too imprecise and the data 
insufficient, especially for groundwater changes, to be able 
to conclude much about the possible net effects on past sea 
level rise 
9.4.8 Synthesis 
The estimated contributions to past sea level rise can now 
be summarised (Table 9 8) Assuming the contribution 
from Antarctica has been zero, the combined contributions 
from thermal expansion, mountain glaciers and the 
Greenland ice sheet over the last 100 years total 10 5cm 
This is within the range of observed sea level rise (10 -
20cm), albeit at the lower end The range of uncertainty is 
large -0 5cm to 22cm

9.5 How Might Sea Level Change in the Future? 
Various estimates of future sea level rise are noted in Table 
9.9. Such estimates are very difficult to compare because 
different time periods are chosen, and because assumptions 
icgarding futuie greenhouse gas concentrations, changes in 
climate, response times, etc.. arc either dilferent or not 
clearly stated. In general, most of the studies in Table 9.9 
loresee a sea level rise ol somewheic between 10cm and 
30cm over the next four decades. This represents a rate of 
rise that is significantly faster than that experienced, on 
average, over the last 100 years. 
Projections for the present assessment are made using 
the standard 1PCC greenhouse gas loicing scenarios. 
These consist of a "Busincss-as-Usual" scenario, and thice 
lower scenarios (B-D) in which greenhouse gas emissions 
aic substantially reduced. Three projections are made lor 
276 
Sea Le\ el Rise 9 
each scenario (12 projections in total) reflecting the high, 
low and best-estimate assumptions for each of the 
contributing factors, as described below 
9.5.1 Methods and Assumptions 
Estimates of the thermal expansion effects are obtained 
using the upwelling-diffusion model of Wigley and Raper 
(1987) described in 9 4 1 and in Section 6 For each 
scenario, the model is run using a climate sensitivity 
(AT2X) of 1 5°C, 2 5°C and 4 5°C for the low, best-estimate 
and high projections, respectively, with the diffusivity set 
to 0 63cm2sec"' and jt set to 1 (see Section 6 foi the 
justification ot the choice of diffusivity and jr values) 
Concerning glaciers and small ice caps, significant 
warming may decrease the ice-covered area within a 
hundred years Thus, in order to make realistic estimates of 
the glacier contribution, the changes in glacier area have to 
be taken into account This is accomplished using a simple, 
global glacier melt model (Raper et al , 1990) The model 
contains three parameters that have to be prescribed initial 
ice volume, a global-mean glacier iesponse time and a 
representative glacier temperature sensitivity parameter 
The parameter values were chosen to match estimated rates 
of glacier volume loss over the last 100 years The model 
was run from 1861 to 2100 (implying that, at present, 
glaciers are in disequilibrium) 
With respect to the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets 
(including the West Antarctic ice sheet and the Antarctic 
Peninsula), the dynamic response can effectively be 
ignored for the time-scales considered here The static 
changes in the surface mass balance can thus be 
represented by the sensitivity values discussed above, that 
is 
Ah = 0 3 ± 0 2mm/yr per degree for the Greenland ice 
sheet 
Ah = -0 3 ± 0 3mm/yr per degree for the Antarctic ice 
sheet 
Based on the latest results from transient runs of fully-
coupled ocean-atmosphere GCM's (Stouffer et al , 1989), it 
was assumed that tempeiature changes were equivalent to 
the global mean, except in Greenland where temperature 
changes were enhanced by a factor of 1 5 
9.5.2 Discussion 
The resultant projections of global sea level rise to the year 
2100 are shown in Figures 9 6 and 9 7 Under the Business-
as-Usual scenano, the best estimate is that, for the year 
2030, global sea level would be 18cm higher than today 
Given the stated range of uncertainty in the contributing 
factors, the rise could be as little as 8cm or as high as 
29cm 
By the year 2070, the projected range is 21-7 lem 
with a best-estimate of 44cm, although it should be 
cautioned that projections this far into the future are fraught 
with many uncertainties, many of which are external to 
thermal expansion and land ice melting 
The major contributing factors to the sea level rise are 
thermal expansion of the oceans and glaciers and small ice 
caps The minor contnbutions to sea level from the 
Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are positive and 
negative, respectively (Table 9 10) 
Foi scenarios B, C and D (Figure 9 7), the sets of 
projections are similar This is because with low forcing 
scenarios, the temperature and sea level effects are more 
sensitive to AT2X Jnd the history of forcing change up to 
1990 than to forcing change post-1990 The best-estimates 
for the year 2070 fall in the range 27-33cm, about one-third 
less than the Business-as-Usual case 
The fact that sea level continues to rise throughout the 
21st century - even under scenarios of strict emission 
reductions demonstrates the strong effect of past changes in 
greenhouse gas concentrations on future climate and sea 
level This is because of the lag effects introduced by the 
thermal inertia of the oceans and the continuing response of 
land ice to climate changes In effect, this creates a very 
substantial sea level rise "commitment" This is illustrated

in Figure 9 8 Here, the IPCC "Business-as-Usual" 
Scenario of greenhouse forcing is imposed to the year 2030 
with no further changes in forcing thereafter Sea level, 
however, continues to rise at almost the same rate for the 
remainder of the century 
This section has been concerned primarily with global 
mean sea level rise 
It should be borne in mind that sea 
level will not rise unifoimly around the woiId Fust at any 
given coastal location sea level will be influenced by local 
and regional vertical 
land movements 
In some 
circumstances, these aie laige and will mask climate 
related changes in ocean volume 
Second, dynamic 
processes in the ocean and atmospheric circulation will also 
cause sea level to change regionally For example, a 
sensitivity study with a dynamic ocean model showed 
regional differences of up to a factor of two relative to the 
global-mean value (Mikolajewicz et al , 1990) Finally, 
changes in the frequency of extreme sea level events may 
be most important in their impact on coastal zones, but are 
currently dillicult to quantify because of the uncertainties 
in iegional picdictions of climatic change

9.6 Summary and Conclusions 
This chapter has addressed three questions 
Has global-mean sea level been rising over the last 100 
years9 
What are the causal factors that could explain a past rise 
in sea level9 and, 
What increases in sea level can be expected in the 
future9 
The array of data and methodological problems inherent 
in estimating the rate of past sea level change is large The 
selection of data and its manipulation can make a 
difference of more than a factor of two in the global trend 
estimate 
While recent analyses of MSL trends involve 
more refined means of data correction and analysis, they 
generally support, not alter, the broad conclusions of 
previous assessments It is our judgement that 
Global sea level has been rising 
The average rate of rise over the last 100 years has been 
10-2 Omm/yr 
There is no firm evidence of an acceleration in global 
MSL rise over this century (although there is some 
evidence that sea level rose taster in this century 
compared to the previous two centuries) 
It appears that the past rise in sea level is due largely to 
thermal expansion of the oceans and increased melting of 
glaciers and the margins of the Greenland ice sheet There 
is no firm basis tor supposing that the Antarctic ice sheet 
has contributed either positively or negatively to past sea 
level change In general, these findings support the 
conclusion, based on analyses ol tide gauge records that 
there has been a globally-coherent, secular rise in sea level, 
and that the causes are most likely related to climatic 
change 
Futui e changes in sea level were estimated for each of 
the IPCC forcing scenarios For each scenario, three 
projections - best estimate, high and low - were made 
corresponding to the estimated range of uncertainty in each 
of the potential contributing factors, and in the climate 
sensitivity and resulting global warming predictions 
It is found that 
For the 'Business-as-Usual" Scenario at year 2030, 
global-mean sea level is 8-29cm higher than today, 
with a best-estimate of 18cm At the year 2070, the 
rise is 21-7 lem, with a best-estimate of 44cm 
Most of the contribution is estimated to derive from 
thermal expansion of the oceans and the increased 
melting of mountain glaciers 
The Antarctic ice sheet contributes negatively to sea 
level due to increased accumulation associated with 
warming 
Increased outflow of ice from the West 
Antarctic ice sheet is likely to be limited, but the 
uncertainty is large 
The Greenland ice sheet contributes positively to sea 
level rise, but part of the enhanced melting and 
runoff may be offset by increased snowfall in the 
higher parts, so the uncertainties are very large 
For the lower forcing scenarios (B,C and D), the sea 
level rise projections are similar, at least until the 
mid-21st century On average these projections are 
approximately one-third lower than those of the 
"Business-as-Usual" Scenario 
Even with substantial decreases in the emissions of the 
major greenhouse gases lutuie increases in sea level are 
unavoidable - a sea level rise commitment' - due to lags 
in the climate system 
9 Sea Level Rise 
279 
In general, this review concludes that a rise of more than 
1 metre over the next century is unlikely 
Even so, the rate 
of rise implied by the Business-as-Usual best-estimate is 3-
6 times faster than that experienced over the last 100 years 
The prospect of such an increase in the rate of sea level rise 
should be of major concern to many low-lying coasts 
subject to permanent and temporary inundation, salt 
intrusion, cliff and beach erosion, and other deleterious 
effects

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Ecosystem Metabolism and Climate Change 
Photosynthesis, plant and microbial respiration tend to increase 
with increasing temperatures, but at higher temperatures 
respiration is often the more sensitive process As a consequence, 
global warming may result in a period ot net release of carbon 
from the land to the atmosphere The magnitude of this release is 
uncertain 
Factors that will influence the amount of caibon 
released include local patterns of climate change and the 
responses of the biota to simultaneous changes in soil moisture 
and atmospheric CO2 concentration 
Increased soil water availability will tend to stimulate plant 
growth in dry ecosystems and inciease carbon storage in cold and 
wet ecosystems like lowland tundra A number of recent 
modelling studies have predicted that water stress will be a 
primary cause of tree death in the southern temperate forests of 
the Northern Hemisphere as climate changes Forest death and 
replacement by grasslands would lesult in a net flux ot caibon 
from the terrestrial biosphere to the atmosphere 
Increased atmosphenc CO2 has the potential to inciease plant 
growth in a variety ol ways stimulation of photosynthesis 
depression of respiration relief of water and low light stresses 
relief of nutrient stress by several mechanisms (greater nutrient 
use efficiency, increased nutrient uptake through root-microbial 
associations, increased symbiotic nitrogen fixation), and delay ol 
senescence that prolongs the giowing season Some ot the 
mechanisms that promote incieased giowth could be paiticulaily 
important in and/semi and and infertile areas However there is 
great uncertainty about whethei 01 not these mechanisms operate 
for prolonged periods in natural ecosystems For example there 
are no field data from whole ecosystem studies of forests that 
demonstrate a ' CO2 feitilization etlect It elevated CCb does 
stimulate the growth ot woody vegetation, this could lead to long 
term net carbon storage in teirestial ecosystems 
Ecosystem Structure and Climate Change 
Because species respond ditfeicntly to climatic change, some will 
increase in abundance while others will decrease Ecosystems will 
therefore change in structure Ovei time some species may be 
displaced to higher latitudes or altitudes Rare species with small 
ranges may be prone to local 01 even global extinction 
Warming rates aie piedicted to be uipid (0 VC per decade) and 
there is gieat uncertainty about how species will iespond to these 
rapid changes 
Ecosystems ot laige stature such as loiests may 
not be able to migrate fast enough to keep pace with climate 
change In past times, species migrations were largely unaffected 
by human land use Barriers to migration now exist (e g , human 
settlements, highways, etc ) Therefore, inferences from previous 
migrations cannot be applied without caution to the present and 
future situations 
Human Activities, Ecosystem Changes and the Climate 
System 
Human activities such as deforestation in the tropics and forest 
harvest and regrowth in mid latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere 
are influencing the climate system by affecting greenhouse gas 
fluxes 
Deforestation in the tropics is releasing 1 6 ± 1 Pg C 
annually to the atmosphere 
The net exchange of carbon between the land and the 
atmosphere due to forest harvest and iegrowth in the mid latitudes 
of the Northern Hemisphere is uncertain These regrowing loiests 
may be accumulating 1-2 Pg C annually One analysis suggests 
that an equivalent amount ol carbon is released back to the 
atmosphere thiough the burning and decay ol previously 
harvested wood 
The issue of carbon storage in the mid latitudes of the Noithein 
Hemisphere is lurther complicated by the eutrophication ol the 
region with nitrogen Nitrogen in agncultuial fertilizers and in 
acid lain may be promoting carbon storage at the rate ot 0 5 
10 
Pg C annually, but there is considerable uncertainly in this 
estimate 
Reforestation as a Means of Managing Atmosphenc CO2 
Reducing the atmospheric CO2 concentration through an 
afforestation program would require the planting ol a vast aiea of 
forest Approximately 370 x 10& ha of tempeiate loiest would 
have to be planted in order to accumulate I Pg C annually I his 
assumes a forest with an annual carbon accumulation rate ol 2 7 t 
per hectare The carbon accumulation would continue for almost a 
century After that time the forest would be mature and would not 
sequester more carbon 
Methane and Nitrous Oxide Fluxes 
Microbial activity is the dominant source to the atmosphere of 
methane and nitrous oxide Warmei and wcttei soil conditions 
may lead to increased fluxes ot these gases to the atmosphere 
Changes in land use and fertilizer and atmosphenc inputs ol 
nitrogen, also have the potential to affect methane and nitious 
oxide fluxes

Effects on Ecosystems

Deforestation and Regional Hydrology 
The conversion of large areas of tropical forest to grassland will 
likely change the hydrological regime of the region. Rainfall will 
be reduced and surface water flow will be affected. 
Marine Ecosystems 
Climate change will probably affect ocean circulation and mixing 
patterns. Circulation and mixing control nutrient availability to 
the oceans' microscopic plants (phytoplankton) and their access 
to solar radiation required for photosynthesis. Since nutrients are 
an important controller of net primary production in marine 
environments, production will be changed to the degree that upper 
ocean physical processes change in response to climate change. 
Different nutrient and mixing regimes are characterized by 
different plankton communities, which have wide ranging 
efficiencies of processing carbon, with important implications for 
long term ocean storage of organic carbon.

10.0 Introduction 
On the basis of current evidence from climate modelling 
studies it appears that the change in globally averaged 
surface temperature due to doubling CCb probably lies in 
the range 1 5 to 4 5°C (Section 5) Temperature changes ol 
this magnitude in the Earth s history have been associated 
with shifts in the geographic distribution of terrestrial biota 
For example, the boreal forests of Canada extend well 
north of the current timber line during the Medieval Warm 
Epoch (800 to 1200 AD) a time when temperatures in that 
region were about \°C wannei than todays At the same 
time, farmers in Scandinavia grew cereal crops as far north 
as 65° latitude (Lamb 1977) Evidence from the past 
suggests that the potential lor ecosystem change in a 
warmer future is large (Warrick et al 1986a) 
A shift in the geogiaphic distribution ot tenestnal biota 
is a long-term (decades to centuries) response to climate 
change Responses to a changing climate will also occur at 
other time-scales In the shoit term (minutes to yeais) 
likely ecosystem responses include changes in the lates of 
processes such as photosynthesis and decomposition and 
changes in the interactions between species such as those 
between plants and insect pests In the intermediate term 
(years to decades), these changes in processes and 
interactions will lead to changes in community stiucturc 
For example, in a mixed foiest type in the mid-latitude 
region, where both deciduous and coniferous tiee species 
coexist, a warmer climate could lead to the loss ol the 
conifers 
Some climate-induced changes of ecosystem structuie 
and function are expected to feed back to the climate 
system For instance, the warming of high latitude wetlands 
will almost certainly increase the production ol CH4 and its 
release to the atmosphere and this will accelerate wanning 
10.1 Focus 
In this section we consider two general issues the effects 
of global change on ecosystems and the ellects of 
ecosystem changes on the climate system We center most 
of our discussion on process-level responses of ecosystems 
to global change To understand many ecosystem icsponses 
to climate change, we consider them in the context of other 
components of global change such as increases in the 
atmospheric concentration of CCb We also consider the 
ecological consequences of tropical deforestation and the 
eutrophication of Northern Hemisphere areas with nitrogen 
in agriculture fertilizers and in acid precipitation as 
examples of ecosystem changes influencing climate 
systems While the primary locus ol this section is on 
terrestrial ecosystems we end the section with a bncl 
discussion of climate change and maiinc ecosystems 
10.2 Effects of Increased Atmospheric CO2 and 
Climate Change on Terrestrial Ecosystems 
Increases in atmospheric CCb, warming and changes in 
precipitation patterns all have the potential to affect 
terrestrial ecosystems in a variety of ways Here we ieview 
some of the major effects and identify some of the ways 
that these three factors interact to influence ecosystems 
10.2.1 Plant and Ecosystem Responses to Elevated CO2 
Current climate models estimate that even if man made 
emissions of CO2 could be kept at present rates 
atmospheric CO? would increase to about 450 ppmv by the 
year 2050 and to about 520 ppmv by the year 2100 
(Section 1) Regardless of how the climate changes over 
this period the Earth s biota will be living in a C02-nch 
environment How will plants and ecosystems respond to 
elevated C027 
10 2 1 1 Plant icsponses 
In this part of the report we will refer to two general groups 
of plants - C3 plants and C4 plants These plant groups 
differ in a number of ways including certain aspects of the 
biochemical pathways they use in the photosynthesis 
process Most of the Earth s plant biomass (about 95%) is 
accounted for by C3 species, but a number ot plants 
important to humans, such as maize, aie C4 species 
10 2 I I 1 Caibon budqet 
Atmospheric CO2 affects 
various components of a plant s carbon budget including 
photosynthesis respnation and biomass accumulation and 
allocation 
Photosynthesis - It has been shown many times that a 
doubling of CO2 in the atmosphere will cause a shoit-term 
(minutes to hours) increase in photosynthesis (Kimball 
1983 Gilford 1988) In some plants the increase is leduced 
after longer-term (weeks to months) exposure (Tissue and 
Occhel 1987 Fetcher et al 1988 Sage et al 1990) This 
reduction may occur because other factois such as low 
nutrient availability eventually limit CO2 uptake 
Respiration - Two types of respiration are recogni/ed in 
plants one known as photoiespiration 
is intimately 
associated with photosynthesis and the other 
daik 
respiration 
includes all plant respiration except photo-
respiration Photorespiration of C3 plants is greatly reduced 
at high CO2 The pattern is not so clear lor 
dark 
respiration The published data on dark respiration rate pei 
unit ol diy weight or leal area indicate increases in some 
cases (Oechel and Strain 1985) and decreases in others 
(Giflordetal 1985) 
Biomass accumulation When grown at high CO2 levels 
undei lavoiablc environmental conditions (e g fa\orable 
tempeiature plentiful water and nutrients) C^ plants 
almost always show increases in biomass accumulation 
290 
Ejfects on Ecosy stems J0 
The C4 plants are less responsive to high CO2 levels in 
terms of biomass accumulation 
but nonetheless the 
response is generally positive For both C^ and C4 plants 
the response is very species dependent and closely linked 
to environmental conditions (Mooney et al 1990) 
Allocation - Increases in CO? affect how plants allocate 
carbon among their various organs Many studies indicate 
that with increasing atmospheric CO2, plants allocate 
proportionally more carbon below ground than above 
ground, causing an increase in root to shoot ratios 
(Langaudene et al 1988, Curtis et al 1990) High CCb can 
also increase the number of branches, tillers, flowers or 
truits that a plant has (e g , Curtis et al 1989) 
The ways in which other environmental factors interact 
with CO2 to determine carbon allocation in plants is 
largely unknown This is a serious gap in our knowledge 
and is a major stumbling block to the development of 
mechanistic, whole-plant models of carbon dynamics 
Tissue quality - Plant tissue quality can change with 
exposure to high CO2 Changes in tissue quality include 
higher carbohydrate levels (Sionit et al 1981) and, at least 
in one instance, higher levels of soluble phenohcs and 
structural compounds (Melillo 1981) Nutrient concen 
trations are also often decreased (Curtis et al 1990, see 
10 2 1 13) These changes in tissue quality could have far-
reaching consequences for herbivory 
host-pathogen 
relationships, and soil processes such as decomposition and 
nutrient cycling Much more work is needed in this area 
belore we can make generalizations about the linkages 
between elevated CO2, tissue chemistry and ecosystem

10 2 1 12 Intel actions between caibon dioxide and 
tempoatitie 
Temperature and CO2 interact to alfect 
photosynthesis and growth Although the reactions are 
species specific, the general response for C"$ plants is that 
the optimum temperature increases for net photosynthesis 
Idso and colleagues (1987) have suggested that plant 
growth response to elevated CO2 seems to be greater at 
higher temperatures If, however, temperature becomes 
extremely high, enzyme degradation will limit both 
photosynthesis and growth Likewise, plants growing at 
low temperatures are not as responsive to elevated CO2 for 
physiological reasons that lead to a feedback inhibition of 
photosynthesis 
102 I 1 3 Caibon dioxide and emuonmental 
stiess 
Elevated CO2 can influence plant responses to limitations 
of water, light and nutrient availability and other 
environmental factors (Tabic 10 1) 
Watei stress - Water use can be affected by high CO2 
Short-term measurements show that incicased CO2 1 educes 
water-loss (transpiration) rates per unit leaf area and 
incieases water use efficiency (WUE) which is the uitio of 
photosynthesis to transpiration (Farquhar and Sharkey 
1982) Increased WUE could lead to increased biomass 
accumulation for plants growing in and environments 
The net effect of high CO2 on total water use pei unit 
land area under field conditions is less certain 
This is 
because the increases in leaf area and ioot extension 
observed in high-C02 plants tend to increase total water 
use and may counteract the effect ol low transpiration per 
unit leaf area Gifford (1988) has concluded that foi both 
physiological and meteorological reasons, high CO2 
concentration might exert little or no effect on regional 
evapotranspnation, but this issue is lar from resolved 
Low light - Carbon dioxide enrichment can increase 
plant growth at low light intensity In lact, the relative 
enhancement of giowth at low light can even be greater 
than at high light (Gifford 1979) Foi some plants, 
however the relative enhancement ot growth by high CCb 
appears equal at low and high light (Sionit ct al 1^82) 
Nutrient stiess High CO2 can increase plant giowth in 
some situations of nutrient-stress A number of C3 plants 
giowing under nitiogcn-deficicnt conditions exhibited 
7 0 Effec ts on Eco system s 
291 
increased growth when the CO2 concentration was doubled 
(Wong 1979, Sionit et al 1981, Goudnaan and de Ruiter 
1983) In these instances there was an increase in the 
nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), that is, the ratio of carbon 
gain to nitrogen used was increased 
102 1 1 4 Phenology and senescence Elevated CO2 has 
been shown to influence the phenology and senescence ol 
plants Annual plants may develop more quickly under 
elevated CO2, reaching full leaf area, biomass, and flower 
and fruit production sooner than plants at ambient CO2 
(Paez et al 1984) Early leaf and seed production could 
shift the population dynamics and competitive relationships 
of plants growing under field conditions 
There is also evidence of delayed senescence of some 
species under elevated CO2 (Hardy and Havelka 1975, 
Mooney et al 1990) Delayed leaf senescence could extend 
the growing season and this could lead to increased 
biomass accumulation (Mooney et al 1990) In ecosystems 
with cold climates, however, the growing season could also 
expose plants to frost damage (Oechel and Strain 1985) 
102 1 2 Commumt\ and etos\stem 1 espouses to ele\ated 
caibon dioxide 
102 1 2 1 Plant plant m/ei actions We can expect changes 
in the interactions of CT, plants with elevated CO2 As we 
noted earlier (see 10 2 1 1 1) the responses of CT, plants to 
increased CO2 are species dependent 
Some ecosystems such as temperate zone grasslands can 
contain a mixture of C3 and C4 plants Elevated CO2 could 
affect the competition between them Based on what we 
know about the biochemistry and physiology of Ct, and C4 
species, we would expect that as the CCb concentration 
increases, the C3 plants should do progressively better than 
the C4 plants, unless there is water stress A numbei ol 
studies have shown just these results For example Bazzaz 
and Carlson (1984) studied the competition between C^ 
and C4 herbaceous plants giown under two moistuic 
regimes and three levels of CCb (300. 600 and 1200 ppm) 
The C3 species grew progressively more rapidly (was a 
better competitor) than the C4 species as the CO2 and 
moisture levels increased 
10 2 12 2 Intel actions between plants and animals The 
effects of increased CCb on plant-animal interactions have 
received relatively little attention Some work has been 
done on herbivory and the conclusion is that herbivory may 
be indirectly affected by high CO2 concentrations Several 
repoits (Overdieck et al 1984 Lincoln et al 1984 1986 
Lincoln and Couvet 1989 Fa]ei et al 1989) have indicated 
thai uitcs of hcibivory lnuease on plant tissues giown at 
high CCb These increases in hcibivor) appear to be 
related to changes in the tissue quality ol plants exposed to 
elevated CCb (see 10 2 1 1 1) The inueased hcibivory 
could affect plant growth as well as feed back to 
ecosystem-level phenomena like nutrient cycling Inc-
reased herbivory would be expected to accelerate nutrient 
cycling 
Linkages between the effects of elevated CO2 on plant 
phenology and herbivory have been suggested (Oechel and 
Strain 1985), but to our knowledge no research has been 
carried out on this topic One argument is that changes in 
the timing of herbivore feeding relative to plant phenology 
could affect productivity and competitive ability of the 
plants concerned 
102 123 
Into action between plants and 
muiobes 
Elevated atmospheric CO2 and climate change will 
probably have major effects on microbial symbionts ol 
plants such as nitrogen-fixing bacteria and mycorrhizal 
fungi 
Symbiotic nitrogen fixing organisms have laige 
requirements for energy provided as plant photosynthate 
These organisms are primarily responsible for giving plants 
access to the large reservoir of nitrogen in the atmosphere 
by converting that gaseous nitrogen into organic nitrogen 
For many ecosystems, high rates of productivity are linked 
to nitrogen fixation Numerous experiments have shown 
that climatic variables and CO2 concentration are 
important controllers of the relationship between plants and 
symbiotic nitrogen fixers For example, a field experiment 
by Hardy and Havelka (1975) showed that over a nine-
week period, plants grown with supplemental CO2 
exhibited a five-fold increase in nitrogen fixation rate over 
untreated controls 
Mycorrhizae are symbiotic associations between the 
host-plant root and a mycorrhizal fungus 
As with 
symbiotic nitrogen fixers, the mycorrhizal fungi depend on 
plants for a supply of reduced carbon Thus climate and 
CO2 changes that affect a plant s abilit) to fix atmospheric 
CO2 have the potential to affect mycorrhizal functioning 
Mycorrhizae may affect plant nutrition 
especially 
phosphorus nutrition and plant water relations Luxmoore 
and co-workers (Luxmoore et al 1986, Norby et al 1986 
ONeill et al 1987) have shown that mycorrhi/al infection 
is enhanced by elevated CO2 , and the increased infection 
resulted in increased plant growth on nutrient-poor soils 
10 2 12 4 Decomposition 
Free-living soil micro-
organisms are responsible for organic matter decay Decay 
rate is a function of the chemical quality of the organic 
matter and environmental factors such as temperatuic and 
moisture (see 10 2 2 2 3) 
Earlier we noted that plants 
giown in elevated CO2 have altered tissue chcimstiy such 
as highei carbon to nitrogen ratios These changes 111 tissue 
chemistry could slow decomposition and possibly lead to 
plant nutrient stress

Effecti on Ecosystems 10 
10 2 I 2 5 Whole-ccos\stem exposuw to elexated caihon 
dioxide 
Many of the direct ellects of elevated CO2 on 
plant growth have been observed in short term studies in 
the laboratory Serious questions have been raised about 
whether or not these phenomena actually occui in the field 
and if they do, whether they are long-teim or only tiansient 
Some answers to these questions may be gained from a 
review of two recent experiments on intact ecosystems -
one a tussock tundra ecosystem in Alaska and the other a 
mid-latitude salt-marsh ecosystem in Maryland These are 
the only whole-ecosystem experiments we know of in 
which the entire system has been subjected to doubled CO? 
concentrations for more than one growing season Both 
experiments have been run for thiee years 
At the tundra site, CO2 and temperature were controlled 
in greenhouses placed over intact field plots (Oechel and 
Riechers 1987, Tissue and Oechel 1987) Experimental 
treatments included ambient CCb and temperature con 
ditions, elevated CO2 (510 and 680 ppmv) and ambient 
temperature, and elevated CCb and temperature (680 ppmv 
CO2, +4°C temperature above ambient) 
At the salt-marsh site CCb was controlled through the 
use of open top chambers set over intact field plots (Drake 
et al 1989) The experimental treatments included ambient 
CCb and temperature, and elevated CCb (ambient plus 340 
ppm) and ambient temperature 
The tundra ecosystem is flonstically diverse but is 
dominated by a sedge, while the marsh system is comprised 
largely of pure patches of two higher plants, a sedge and a 
grass The tundra and salt marsh sedges aie C3 plants and 
the salt marsh grass is a C4 plant The plant and ecosystem 
responses of these two systems (Table 10 2) generally 
follow predictions based on the interactions of CCb and the 
other environmental factors discussed earlier 
Significant ecosystem-level cttccts were noted in both 
the tundra and the salt marsh For the tundra plots exposed 
to elevated CCb, there was a complete homeostatic 
adjustment of whole ecosystem carbon flux within three 
years, with the result being no change in net carbon storage 
in CCb-treated plots relative to controls However, the 
combination of elevated CCb and temperature rise resulted 
in an increase in net carbon storage that lasted lor the three 
years of observations (Oechel and Riecheis 1986, 1987) 
The CO2 treatment in pure stands of the Ct, marsh plant 
resulted in increased net carbon storage for the whole 
system In the puie stands ol C4 giass, net carbon storage 
tor the whole system was not increased 
One of the most important points that can be made about 
the comparison ol the responses of the two ecosystems to 
elevated CO2 is that the mteiactions among temperature, 
COT and nutrient availability aic key controlling factors 
Temperature affects both plant photosynthetic response to 
elevated CO2 and nutrient availability through organic 
matter decomposition (see 10 2 2 2 3) Both temperature 
and nutrient availability exert control on the growth of 
plant organs where fixed caibon can be stored In cold, low 
nutrient environments, the growth of storage organs is slow 
and this can lead to an 'end product' inhibition of 
photosynthesis II temperature is not limiting, but nutrients 
are, the increased allocation of fixed carbon to roots could 
iesult in more ol the soil volume being "mined" to meet 
plant nutrient demand, thereby allowing the plant to utilize 
the CO2 
Have we correctly interpreted the interactions and do 
they operate in other teirestnal ecosystems'' We do not 
know the answers to these questions There have been no 
long-term studies of the responses of most of the world's 
ecosystems to elevated CO2 or climate change For 
example, we currently have no information about many of 
the responses of forests and other woody ecosystems to 
elevated CO2 Some scientists have argued that limitations 
of water, nutrients and light, will prevent these ecosystems, 
especially unmanaged foresets, from showing significant 
responses to elevated levels of atmospheric CO2 (e g , 
Kramer, 1981) The responses of forests to increased CO2 
are very uncertain 
A high research priority for the near 
future has to be a series of whole ecosystem manipulations, 
including forest manipulations, in which key controlling 
factors such as CO2, temperature, moisture and nutrient 
availability aie varied 
10 2 13 Summon 
Increased atmospheric CO2 has the potential to alter 
ecosystem metabolism Net primary production could be 
enhanced by increased CO2 in a variety of ways including 
the following stimulation of photosynthesis, depression of 
respiration, relief of water and low light stresses, relief of 
nutrient stress by several mechanisms (greater nutrient use 
efficiency, increased nutrient uptake through root-microbial 
associations increased symbiotic nitrogen fixation), and 
delay of senescence that prolongs the growing season 
Elevated CO2 could also lead to net carbon storage, 
especially if the growth of woody vegetation is stimulated 
and there is not an equal stimulation of decomposition by 
some other factor such as warming At this time we have 
no evidence that elevated CO2 has increased net carbon 
storage in natural ecosystems dominated by woody 
vegetation 
Increased CO2 could also change species composition 
by affecting plant reproductive processes, competition, 
plant-animal interactions, and plant-microbe interactions

universality of this response is unknown but it could prove 
to be a powerful agent for disrupting community 
synchrony, for initiating structural change and lor 
enhancing the capacity of species to migrate 
10 2 2 2 Community and ec osystem i espouses 
10222 
1 Plant community composition 
Changes in 
climate will likely alter differentially the regeneration 
success, growth and mortality rates of plants The resulting 
changes in competitiveness of species or species groups 
will affect community composition Where species occur 
at their distributional limits, in transition zones, small 
changes in climate are likely to promote disproportionately 
large responses in the plant species Changes in community 
structure will, therefore be identified sooner in transitional 
zones between vegetation types than elsewhere 
10 2 2 2 2 Intel actions between plants and animals Of 
crucial importance in plant community functioning is the 
synchronous operation of the life cycles of interacting 
plants, animals and soil organisms Complex synchronies 
are found in communities in which the life cycles ot plants 
and pollinating and seed-dispersing animals must be 
closely linked Changes in climate could disrupt these 
synchronies 
Climate-related stresses such as drought stress, can 
make plants susceptible to insect attack As an example, 
oak wilt disease in the USSR appears to be dependent on 
the decreased ability of the trees to resist leaf-eating insects 
during drought (Israel et al, 1983) 
Warming may expand the overwintering ranges of some 
plant pests and this could prove a serious problem lor 
agroecosystems For example, in the United States the 
potato leafhopper, a serious pest on soybeans and other 
crops, currently overwinters only in a narrow band along 
the coast of the Gulf of Mexico 
Warmer winter 
temperatures could cause a doubling or a tripling of its 
overwintering range This would increase invasion pop-
ulations and lead to greater insect density and increased 
plant damage (Smith and Tirpak, 1989) 
10 2 2 2 3 Decomposition 
Climate is an important 
controller of the decomposition ol both surface litter and 
organic matter dispersed through the soil profile The 
chemical composition of the decomposing material also 
influences decay rate 
Surface litter - The decomposition of surface litter is 
very clearly related to climatic factors, with rates generally 
increasing with increasing temperature and precipitation in 
well-drained sites In pooily chained sites, excessive 
moisture (waterlogging) can slow decay rates Climatic 
control is most often quantified by a lelationship with 
actual evapotranspiration (AET) 
It has been known lor some time that litters from 
different plant species decay at different rates under similar 
conditions (Minderman, 1968) This has been linked to 
differences in the quality ol carbon Litters with high 
hgnin concentrations will decay more slowly than those 
with lower concentrations The ratio of hgnin to nitrogen 
has proven a good predictor ol litter decay rate in temperate 
and boreal ecosystems (Mehllo et al , 1982) 
A number of attempts have been made to integrate the 
climate and chemical quality controls of litter decay These 
models generally indicate that when AET is low the 
decomposition rates do not vary much with hgnin 
concentrations, but as AET increases resource quality 
accounts for more of the variation in decomposition lates 
(Meentemeyer, 1978, 1984, Pastor and Post, 1986) 
Soil organic matter - Tempeiatuie, moisture and soil 
texture are important controllcis of soil organic matter 
decomposition These factors assume more or less imp-
ortance depending on the ecosystem In tundra ecosystems 
soil respiration can be limited by an excess ol moisture 
(waterlogging) as well as by low tempcratuics 
Soil respiration in the well drained forests ol the boreal 
and temperate zones are most often temperature limited 
(Van Cleve and Sprague 1971, Bunnell et al 1977) Soil 
respiration in these systems is rarely limited by moisture 
deficit (Anderson, 1973 Schlesinger, 1977, Moore 1984) 
In very dry sub tropical forests, lack of moisture can limit 
decay (Carlyle and U Ba, 1988) 
Overall, litter decomposition and SOM accumulation in 
climax grasslands follow predictable climate and soil 
texture-related patterns (Brady 1974) which arc amenable 
to the development ol simulation models ol carbon 
dynamics (Hunt, 1977, McGill et al , 1981 Van Veen and 
Paul, 1981 Parton et al 1987) In dry grassland sites soil 
respiration is primarily a lunction of soil moisture (Hunt 
1977, Warembourg and Paul 1977 Orchaid and Cook 
1983) although computer model simulations of the 
response of semi-arid soils ol North America to wanning 
suggest that higher soil tempeiatures will result in 
increased carbon losses (Schimel private communication) 
In mesic grasslands as in forests tempcratuie is the main 
determinant ot carbon mineralization rates loi the soil 
system Fine textured soils, those rich in clays are thought 
to render soil organic matter more stable thiough the 
mechanism of physical piotection than are the coarse 
textured sandy soils 
There is concern that global warming will accelerate the 
decomposition of surface litter and soil organic matter 
especially at high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere In 
the Arctic tundra, there are about 160 Pg carbon stored in 
the soil (Schlesingci, 1984) Most ol it is lio/en in 
permafrost with only 20-4()cm thawing in the summer 
Even for the thawed material the cold and in some cases 
wet conditions preclude uipid decomposition But what 
296 
Effects on Ecosystems 10 
will happen if a CO2 doubling is accompanied by a 4 8°C 
temperature increase7 
The experiments of Billings and his colleagues (1982. 
1983 1984) suggest that wet sedge tundra will become a 
net source ot carbon to the atmosphere, at least tor a short 
time, it climate changes such that air temperature is 
increased and there is greater soil drainage Billings argued 
that warmer temperatures and a lowered water table would 
result in greatly increased rates ol soil respnation Using 
Billing's data, Lashof (1989) calculated that a 4°C 
temperature rise would increase the net annual flux of 
carbon Irom the tundra to the atmosphere by I Pg 
The consequences ot soil wanning in northern forests are 
cleai from an experiment conducted on a boreal forest in 
Alaska Experimental heating of the surface soil, to 9°C 
above ambient temperature for three summers was carried 
out in black spruce forest (Van Cleve et al 1981) For the 
entire period there was a 20% reduction in the amount of 
organic carbon in the surface soil of the heated site as 
compared to no reduction in an adjacent control site The 
incieased decay of the soil organic matter iesulted in an 
increase in nutrients available to plants As a result of the 
moie favourable temperature and nutrient regimes, foliage 
showed increased photosynthetic rates and significantly 
higher concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus and other 
nutrients important to plant growth 
10 2 2 2 4 Models of ecosystem 1 espouse to climate 
change 
A tamily of population based forest growth 
models (e g , JABOWA, FORET LINKAGES) has been 
used to consider the effects of climate change on forest 
composition, carbon storage capacity and geographic 
disti lbution For example Pastor and Post (1988) ran a 
population-based forest growth model (LINKAGES) for 
seveial sites including a spiuce-noithern hardwood site in 
northeastern Minnesota Forest growth was simulated on 
two soil types found in this region one with low water-
holding capacity and the othei with high water-holding 
capacity 
The simulations weie initiated from bare plots 
with the seeds of trees commonly lound in the aiea For 
200 years the sites weie allowed to follow the lorest 
dynamics appropnate to the cunent climate The climate 
conditions were then changed linearly to reach a 2xCO? 
climate over the next 100 yeais and then remained constant 
the liiul 200 years of the simulation 
On the soil with high watei-holding capacity the spuice-
northein haidwood lorest was replaced by a more 
pioductive northern hardwood loiest (Figure 10 2) The 
aboveground carbon mass in the mature post-climate-

Figure 10.2: Predictions of biomass and species composition of 
Minnesota forests under climatic conditions predicted with CCb 
doubling The predictions are based on a forest growth model 
(LINKAGES) Climate inputs were the same for the two runs 
but panel (a) shows simulated lorest growth on a soil with high 
water holding capacity, and panel (b) shows simulated forest 
growth on a soil with low water holding capacity (After Pastor 
and Post 1988) 
warmer climate, as well as the relatively easy-to-
decompose litter of the hardwoods, increases nitiogen 
availability and this enhancement amplifies the effect of 
warming on productivity 
On the soil with the low water-holding capacity, the 
spruce-northern hardwood lorest was replaced by a stunted 
pine-oak forest of much lower carbon storage capacity At 
maturity, the oak-pine forest contained only 25% of carbon 
contained in the original spruce-northern hardwood forest 
In this example, temperature, plant-soil water relations,

Solomon (1986) used anothci population-based forest 
growth model (FORENA) lor 21 locations in eastern Noith 
America with 72 species of trees available as seeds at all 
times Initial soil conditions were the same at all sites The 
simulations were all initiated from a bare plot and were 
allowed to follow the forest dynamics appropriate to the 
modern climate with undisturbed conditions for 400 years 
After year 400 the climatic conditions were changed 
linearly to reach the 2xCC>2 climate in year 500 (see 
Solomon, 1986 for details) 
At the end of 400 years the forests on the 21 sites had 
reached structural maturity and most contained the 
appropriate species mixes as judged by comparing them to 
what actually grows at the sites The mapr eflects of the 
changes in climate that resulted from a doubling of 
atmospheric CO2 were as follows 
A slower growth of most deciduous tree species 
throughout much of their geographical range, 
A dieback of the dominant trees, particularly in the 
transition between boreal/deciduous forests, 
A reduction of carbon storage in the vegetaion in the 
southern two-thirds of the region and a gain in the 
far north, 
An invasion of the southern boreal forest by temperate 
deciduous trees that was delayed by the presence of 
the boreal species 
A shift in the general pattern of foiest vegetation similar 
to the pattern obtained from the Holdndge map 
experiments (see 10 2 2 3 1) 
The overall reduction in carbon stocks in the vegetation 
of forests of the eastern North America was estimated to be 
10% (Figure 10 3) If the results arc generalized to all 
temperate forests the annual flux Irom these systems to the 
atmosphere would be between 0 1 and 0 2 Pg C (Lashof 
1989) 
Solomon (1986) discussed the possible effects of several 
impoitant ecological piocesses that weie not included in 
the model For example insects and other pathogens as 
well as air pollutants 
could enhance the moitality 
simulated by the models Also plant migiation (and 
associated lag effects) could have a negative influence on 
foiest productivity 
These forest growth models are uselul tools tor making 
pielnninary evaluations of forest ecosystem responses to 
climate change They do have a number of limitations and 
these have been icviewed lecently (Smith and Tirpak, 
1989) For example ma|oi uncertainties exist iegarding the 
kinds and rates ol response of individual tree species to 
changes in the environment including the CCb increases

One of the major consequences of climate change could be 
the migration of biota across the landscape The migrations 
could have many effects including the release of laigc 
amounts of carbon to the atmosphere from dying and 
decaying forests The releases could be large enough to 
further increase warming (Woodwell, 1987, Lashot, 1989) 
Both modelling studies and palaeoecological studies have 
been used to examine the relationships between climate 
change and forest migration 
10 2 2 3 I Simulation of global stale iespouse itsm(> 
\e\>etation-c Innate i elationslups A veiy general approach 
to examining the possible responses of the world s 
ecosystem types to climate change is to use hypothetical 
relationships between climate and vegetation derived in 
present-day conditions, and to apply these to scenarios of 
changed climate Emanuel et al (1985a,b) employed a 
lifezone classification of Holdndge (1947, 1964) This 
system hypothesizes zonation of vegetation across 
gradients of average total annual precipitation, the ratio of 
potential evapotranspiration to precipitation and mean 
annual biotemperature (average annual temperature 
computed by setting all values below 0°C to zero) Using 
the Holdndge system, Emanuel and his co-workers 
(1985a,b) predicted a large shrinkage of the boreal forest 
(by 37%) and tundra (by 32%) and expansion of grassland 
hfezones under warmer climates due to a CO2 doubling 
Because the temperature changes in the climate-change 
scenario used by Emanuel and his colleagues were small 
toward the equator, there were smaller changes in the 
tropical life zones In this modelling exercise, precipitation 
was maintained at current levels for all areas 
There are several uncertainties attached to this type of 
assessment (Emanuel et al, 1985a), notably the selection of 
climate scenarios and low iesolution of the data grid (0 5° x 
0 5°) In addition, the response of ecosystems to factors 
such as CO2 and the rate of climate change is not 
considered 
10 2 2 12 
Palaeoecological 
evidence 
ThelPCC 
projections of climate change indicate a rapid rise in global 
temperature with an increase of about 0 3°C per decade 
over the next century (Section 5) Rapid increase in 
temperature may create problems for large stature 
ecosystems such as forests 
The significance of projected rates of temperature 
change becomes clear when the consequent geographic 
shifts in isotherms are considered 
For example, in mid-
continental North America, each degree (°C) change in 
temperature corresponds to a distance of 100-125 km If 
similar temperature-distance relationships are assumed in

the future, a 3°C rise in temperature would lead to a 300 to 
375 km northward displacement in isotherms during the 
next century 
Based on the fossil pollen record, we know that the rate 
of movement of forest trees during the Holocene was 
generally 25 and 40 km per century (Davis, 1981, Huntley 
and Birks, 1983), with the fastest rate 200 km per century 
(Ritchie and MacDonald, 1986) With these rates of 
movement, most tree species would not be able to change 
their geographical distribution as fast as the projected shifts 
in suitable climate Zaluski and Davis (unpublished data 
cited in Davis, 1988) provide an example based on the past 
rates of spread of eastern hemlock (Tsuqa canadensis) 
Under two scenarios for future climate, this species would 
not be able to migrate fast enough to occupy much ol its 
potential range 100 years from now (Figure 10 4) 
Prehistoncal species migrations were largely unaffected 
by human land use In contrast, modern species migrations 
may be severely restricted by land use, for example the 
progression of the altitudmal treehne with global warming 
may be prevented by stock grazing Also, because suitable 
habitats lor many rare species chaiatteristic of areas of low 
productivity are infrequent and fragmentary, being 
surrounded by very pioductive agricultural land it is 
unlikely that these species will spread naturally even 
though climate change will increase then vigour and 
reproductive capacity On the other hand, the migration of 
weedy species may be enhanced by land-use change, foi 
example along coiiidors of dispeisal formed by loads, 
railways, etc and in open ground created by various forms 
of human disturbance 
Very little is known about migration rates under present 
or likely future climates Models of migrations of invasive 
species based on diffusion (Williamson, 1989) or epidemic 
theory (Carter and Prince 1981) suggest that the outcome 
of invasions is often unexpected and accuiate prediction 
has rarely ever been achieved The relationship between 
species migrations and climate is not simple and 
geographical barneis to dispersal ma> be locally important 
Quaternary pollen iecoids also show that plant 
communities continuously change ovei time Communities 
disassemble and new ones arise presumably because 
species respond to climatic vdilations accoiding to unique 
sets of physiological and ecological icqunemcnts (Graham. 
1986) The resulting new combinations of vegetation, 
climate and soils can change the spatial pdtteins of such 
fundamental processes ds primaiy production (Pastoi and 
Post, 1988) More subtle but still important iclationships 
such as those evolved between host and pathogen may be 
disrupted by the stress ol new conditions resulting in 
increased frequency of epidemics (Leonaid and Fiy 1986) 
Past changes in plant associations and abundances hdve 
been so marked that some types of ecosystems have also 
been trdnsient Foi cxdinple 20 000 30 000 yedis dgo 
when the Edrth's climate was about 5°C colder than present 
large parts of North America, Europe and Asia were 
covered by herbaceous vegetation that did not resemble 
modern tundra, grassland or steppe Thus a plant comm-
unity that was dominant in the Northern Hemisphere for 
10,000 years does not exist today Some well known 
modern ecosystems have had much shorter existences As 
an example, old-growth Douglas-fir 
(Psendot\ni>a 
menziesu) forests of the Pacific Northwest, renowned for 
their long-lived, massive trees and huge ecosystem carbon 
storage, are first recognized in the fossil record about 6000 
years ago - representing only 5 to 10 generations ol the 
dominant tree species 
(Brubaker, personal comm-
unication) 
Thus the dynamic record of the Earth s vegetation clearly 
demonstrates that ecosystems as well as communities may 
be short lived in the face of changing climate Ecosystems 
represent a set of processes linking biota and their geo-
chemical environment in a particular climate Because 
natural variations in the Earth's climate have followed a 
relatively unique path dictated by changes in large-scale 
climatic controls, a variety of ecosystems come and go over 
time To the extent that human influences will cause unique 
future climates, we should expect fundamental changes in 
current ecosystems 
10 2 2 4 Sum ma i) 
Both photosynthesis and plant and microbial respiration 
tend to increase with increasing temperatures, but at higher 
temperatuies respiration is often the more sensitive process 
(see 10 2 2 11) As a consequence, global warming may 
result in a period of net release of carbon from the land to 
the atmosphere (Woodwell, 1987) The magnitude of the 
release would depend on the magnitude and the seasonality 
of the temperature change and the responses of the vanous 
piocesses to that change One estimate is that the anniidl 
cdrbon flux fiom the boreal zone associated with a 4°C 
global temperatuie change would be in the range of 0 5 2 0 
PgC(Lashol 1989) 
Besides being dependent on temperature photosynthesis 
and plant and soil respiration can be influenced by soil 
watei 
Incieased water availability will tend to stimulate 
plant growth in dry ecosystems and to increase carbon 
storage in cold and wet ecosystems like lowland tundra A 
number of recent modelling studies have predicted that 
water stress will be a primary cause ol forest death in the 
southern and central regions of North America as climate 
changes (eg 
Solomon 1986, Smith and Tirpak 1989) 
Forest death has the potential for releasing large stores ol 
carbon to the atmosphere 
A ma|or consequence ol climate change could be the 
migration ol biota across the landscape Communities will 
not migrate as units Individual species will migiate at 
different rates depending upon a variety ol species specific

characteristics as well as environmental factors such as 
natural and human-caused barriers to dispersal Predictions 
of migration rates are very uncertain It is possible that 
many tree species will not be able to change their 
geographical distribution as fast as the projected shifts in 
suitable climate and extinctions may occur 
10.3 The Effects of Terrestrial Ecosystem Changes on 
the Climate System 
In this part of the report we consider how a variety of 
changes in terrestrial ecosystems can affect the climate 
system We begin by considering the types of ecosystem 
changes that will affect net carbon stoiage in ecosystems 
photosynthesis and release 40 Pg C through respiration 
The difference between total photosynthesis and plant 
respiration, 60 Pg C, is called net primary production 
(NPP) At the global scale tropical rain forest ecosystems 
arc the most productive and desert ecosystems are the least 
productive (Table 10 3) 
In an unperturbed world, NPP is approximately balanced 
by the release of carbon from soils to the atmosphere 
through microbial respiration This carbon balance can be 
changed considerably by direct human impact (landuse 
changes, particularly deforestation) and by other changes in 
the environment such as the composition of the atmosphere 
as well as by changes in climate as discussed earlier 
(10 2 2 4) 
10 3.1 Carbon Cycling in Terrestrial Ecosystems 
Terrestrial ecosystems contain about 2000 Pg ot carbon 
(Table 10 3) almost three times the amount held in the 
atmospheic Each year about 59f ol the tcirestnal carbon 
stock is exchanged with the atmosphere Plants take up 
about 100 Pg C lrom the atmospheie through the process ol 
10 3 1 1 Defoi estation in the Tiopic s 
The current IPCC estimate for the annual net release of 
carbon from the land to the atmospheie due to deforestation 
and related land use in the tropics is 1 6 + 1 0 Pg (Section 
1) The large uncertainty associated with this number is 
ielated to the tact that we have poor knowledge of the rate 
10 Effects on Ecosystems 
Wl 
of deforestation, of the carbon stocks of the forests being 
cleared, and of the dynamics of carbon loss through soil 
decay processes following clearing (Houghton, 1990) 
10 3 12 Foiest teqiowth 
in the mid latitudes of the 
Not the/ n Hemisphei e 
Several analyses suggest that the forest harvest and 
regrowth cycle is such that at this time the regrowing 
forests in the mid-latitudes ot the Northern Hemisphere are 
accumulating carbon at the rate of 1-2 Pg annually 
(Armentano and Ralston, 1980, Johnson and Sharpe, 1983, 
Melillo et al, 1988) What is not clear at the present time 
is the rate of oxidation ot the cut wood One analysis 
(Melillo et al, 1988) suggests that the carbon in the cut 
wood is being returned to the atmosphere through decay 
and burning at about the rate that the regrowing lorests are 
accumulating carbon 
This subject deserves further 
attention especially in light of the recent modelling study of 
the global carbon cycle that suggests that mid-latitude 
ecosystems of the Northern Hemisphere are accumulating 
carbon at the rate of 2 0 to 3 4 Pg C annually (Tans et al 
1990) 
10 3 I 3 Eutiophuation 
and toxifuation 
in the mid-
latitudes of the Not thei n Hemisphei e 
The issue of carbon storage in the mid-latitudes of the 
Northern Hemisphere is further complicated by the 
increased availability of nutrients such as nitrogen from 
agricultural fertilizers and from combustion of fossil fuel 
This increased nitrogen availability may result in net 
carbon storage in plants and soils (Melillo and Gosz 1983 
Peterson and Melillo 1985) In the mid to late 1980s 
between 70 and 75 Tg N per year have been applied to 
agricultural fields mostly in the mid-latitudes of the 
Northern Hemisphere (Eichnci 1990) In addition about 
18 Tg N have been deposited each year on the forests ol 
this region in acid precipitation (Melillo et al 1989) The 
addition of this nitrogen to agricultural plots and foiests 
could be causing an accumulation ol between 0 5 and 1 0 
Pg carbon in soils and woody vegetation (Melillo pnvate 
communication) Howevei it should be noted that the 
greater availability of nitrogen is at least loi the foiests 
associated with increasing levels of pollutants which could 
reduce plant growth We are unceitain about the net effects 
on the terrestrial carbon balance of eutiophication and 
toxification of mid-latitude ecosystems ol the Northern 
Hemisphere 
10.3.2 
Reforestation 
as a Means 
of 
Managing 
Atmospheric CO2 
It is sometimes suggested that we should leversc the long-
term trend of land cleanng and grow new foiests to absorb 
the excess CO2 Is this suggestion a icasonablc one' What 
rates of carbon uptake and storage can wc expect' How 
much land area would be needed to make a difference' 
How long would the uptake continue' 
Recently Jarvis (1989) estimated that a rapidly growing 
forest in the temperate /one can accumulate a mean of 
2 7tC/ha annually for almost 100 years To accumulate 1 
Pg C per annum, the equivalent of about 17% of current 
annual fossil fuel CCb emissions, the new growing foiest 
would have to occupy 370 x 106 ha This is an area 
equivalent to about one half the size of the Amazon Basin 
The accumulation will not be linear Early on it will be 
rapid, but as the forest matures the accumulation will slow 
down until the annual respiration rate of the forest is about 
equal to caibon uptake It the loicst is left unmanaged the 
trees will eventually die at different times and be leplaced 
naturally, over a large area net uptake of CCb by the 
vegetation from the atmosphere and return of CO? by 
organic matter decomposition to the atmosphere will be in 
balance and the forest will no longer act as a net carbon 
sink 
Houghton (1990) has made a similar set of calculations 
for the tropics He first made an estimate of land available 
in the tropics for afforestation Counting only lands that 
supported forests in the past and that are not currentl} used 
for either crops or settlement, he concluded that 500 x 10° 
ha of tropical lands could be reforested 
He also icasoncd 
that an additional 365 x 10° ha could be reforested if the 
current area occupied by the ciops and fallow ol shifting 
cultivation was reduced to the area required to produce 
similai yields under low-input continuous cultivation The 
total area, 865 x 106 ha is larger (by about 25%) than the 
Amazon Basin 
Since much of the land that would be involved in the 
reforestation is probably degraded (low in plant nutrients 
especially phosphorus) 
the aveiage iate of caibon 
accumulation was estimated b> Houghton to be about 
1 7tC/ha Given these estimates of available land and 
carbon accumulation rate Houghton calculated that about 
1 5 Pg C might be withdrawn liom the atmospheie each 
year over the next centuiy (150 Pg C total) Aftei that time 
the new forest ll leit untouched would be in steady-state 
with respect to carbon exchange with the atmospheie 
Houghton noted that the estimate is optimistic because it 
tails to consider ownership of the land the expense ot 
ieforestation or the ability of degraded lands to giow trees 
even at the modest rates used in his calculations 
Although simple, these calculations aie impoitant 
because they illustrate the enormity of the task facing us il 
we decide to manage atmosphenc CO? by affoiestation 
10.3.3 Methane and Nitrous Oxide Fluxes 
The trace gas concentrations of the Earth s atmospheie have 
been increasing foi moie than a centuiy (Section 1) 
Microbial activity is the dominant source to the atmosphere 
of two of these gases methane (CII4 ) and nitious oxide 
302 
Effects on Ecosystems 10 
(N2O) 
Climatic factors play an important part in 
controlling the rates at which these gases are produced In 
addition, atmospheric inputs of nitrogen and sulphui to 
ecosystems may affect CH4 production and consumption 
Nitrogen additions to ecosystems as well as forest cleanng 
can stimulate N2O production The controls on (he fluxes 
of these two gases are discussed below 
10 3 3 1 Methane 
Bacteria known as "methanogens produce methane These 
organisms can only metabolize and live in the strict 
absence ot oxygen Methanogenic ecosystems usually aie 
aquatic, such as swamps, marshes, lens paddies lakes 
tundra, and so on, where oxygen-deficient zones develop 
due to O2 consumption by respiration and limitation of O2 
diflusion lrom the atmosphere Other ecosystems such as 
wet meadows, potholes, and inundation zones, may be 
methane producers for at least part ot the year but may 
support consumption of atmosphenc CH4 when they dry 
up Most of the aerobic soils do not support CH4 
production and emission, quite the contrary, they seem to 
function as CH4 consumption sites (Seller and Conrad 
1987, Steudler et al , 1989) The guts of teimites and the 
rumens of cattle are also anoxic methanogenic env 
ironments An overview of the relative importance of 
various sources and sinks for CH4 are given in Section 1 
(Table 1 2) 
A number of factors besides the oxygen status ol the 
environment contiol CH4 production These factors 
include temperature, the availability of carbon substrate, 
pH and electron acceptors 
Most methanogenic bacteria have temperature optima of 
30-40°C Thus, if the supply of oiganic mattei is not 
limiting, increasing the temperature generally will 
stimulate CH4 production in most methanogenic env-
ironments It is estimated that a temperatuie increase of 
1()°C will lead to a 2 5 3 5 fold inciease in CH4 production 
(Coniad et al , 1987) This assumes no change in soil 
moisture, that is, the soils remain waterlogged 
Warming in high latitude ecosystems such as wet tundia 
and the boreal wetlands will almost ceitainly lead to 
increased CH4 emissions from these ecosystems which 
cuncntly account for the release of about 40 Tg of CH4 to 
the atmosphere annually Based on the simple relationship 
between temperature and methanogenic activity described 
above, a 4°C rise in temperature in the soils of the high 
latitude systems could lead to a 45% to 65% increase in 
methane release from these systems It warming is 
accompanied by drying, then there may ultimately be a 
reduction of CH4 release to the atmosphere since the soils 
would become oxygen filled, a condition unsuitable for the 
methanogens Under drier conditions the carbon-rich 
northern soils would become net sources of CCb until a 
new equilibrium was reached between caibon inputs from 
plants and CCH loss associated with decomposition (see 
102223) 
Sediments 01 anaerobic soils rich in organic matter are 
oltcn active in CH4 production The addition of organic 
substrates to methanogenic sites generally stimulates CH4 
production, provided that temperature and pH are not major 
limiting factors 
Most methanogenic bacteria grow 
optimally in a narrow range around pH 7 (Conrad and 
Schutz, 1988) 
Bicarbonate functions as the electron acceptor during the 
process of methanogenesis Electron acceptors such as 
nitrate and sulfate in general are preferred over bicarbonate 
and thus inhibit CH4 production So, any input of oxidized 
compounds such as sulfate or nitrate in fertilizers or acid 
nun will reduce CH4 production The significance of this 
reduction for the global CH4 budget is unclear at this time, 
but it is not likely to be large 
The major sink lor CH4 is reaction with OH in the 
tropospheie Soils also function as a sink for CH4, with the 
magnitude of the sink being in the range of 30 ± 15 Tg 
CH4 per year Recent evidence indicates that the 
magnitude of the soil sink for CH4 is controlled by 
temperature moisture and some aspects of the nitrogen 
cycle in the soil (Steudler et al , 1989) 
Warmei 
temperatures increase CH4 uptake by aerobic soils, while 
high soil moisture and high rates of nitrogen turnover in 
soils reduce CH4 uptake The argument has been made that 
the eutrophication ol the soils of the mid latitudes of the 
temperate region, with 18 Tg N per year associated with 
acid rain, may have reduced CH4 uptake by soils enough to 
have contributed to the atmospheric increase of CH4 
(Melillo et al , 1989) The logic here is that either a 
reduction in a CH4 sink or an increase in a CH4 source will 
lead to an increase in atmosphenc CH4 content since the 
gas has such a long lifetime in the atmosphere While this 
nitrogen-methane interaction is an interesting example of a 
subtle impact of industrialisation 
on the global 
environment, the importance of this mechanism is not yet 
established 
10 3 3 2 Nitions oxide 
Our cunent understanding of the global budget of N2O is 
reviewed in Section 1 (Table 1 4) The budget is largely 
controlled by microbial processes 
Nitrous oxide can be produced by four processes 
denitnfication, nitrification, assimilatory nitrate reduction 
and chcmodenitnfication 
Of these processes, denit-
nfication in aerobic soils is probably the most important 
source of N2O (Matson and Vitousek, 1990) Denit-
nfication is defined as the dissimilatory reduction of oxides 
ol nitrogen to produce N2O and N2 by a diverse group of 
bacteria 
The cellular controllers ol denitnfication are O2 nitrate 
(NO3) and carbon Moisture has an indirect effect on 
10 Effec ts on Ecosvstems 
303 
denitrification by influencing the O2 content of soil II 
other conditions are appropriate, then temperature becomes 
an important controller of denitrification rate 
Tiedje (1988) has suggested that the controllers of 
denitrification vary among habitats He indicated that 
oxygen availability is the dominant factor limiting denit-
rification in habitats that are exposed to the atmosphere, 
such as soil, while in dominantly anaerobic habitats, such 
as sediments, NO3 is the most important cellular controller 
When anaerobic zones occur in soils, then NO3 
availability, or carbon availability, as controlled by wetting 
and drying or freezing and thawing cycles, can become a 
critical factor in controlling denitrification In fertilized 
soils, carbon is commonly second in importance after O2, 
whereas in unfertilized soils, is often second in importance 
Demtnfiers in the natural environment are capable of 
producing either N2O or N2 as end products 
Numerous 
factors have been reported to affect the proportion of N2O 
produced relative to N2 in denitrifying cells and soils If 
the availability of oxidant (N-oxide) greatly exceeds the 
availability of reductant (most commonly carbon), then the 
oxidant may be incompletely utilized, that is, N oxides will 
not be completely reduced to N2 In other words, the 
dominant product of denitrification may be N2O in systems 
where, at least for a time, nitrate supply is high and carbon 
supply is low, but not excessively so (Firestone and 
Davidson, 1989) 
A wetter climate may lead to increased N2O production 
since soil moisture influences O2 availability to microbes 
and low oxygen tension is a precondition of denitrification 
Warming will accelerate N2O production by accelerating 
the nitrogen cycle in the soil and making more nitrate 
available to the denitntiers 
In the tropics, conversion of forest to pasture has been 
shown to increase N2O flux (Luizao et al , 1990) Nitrous 
oxide emissions also increase immediately after forest 
harvest in the temperate zone (Bowden and Bormann, 
1986) In both of these cases, ecosystem disturbance has 
resulted in warmei and wetter soils that are cycling 
nitrogen more rapidly than pre-disturbance soils 
10.3.4 Ecosystem 
Change and Regional 
Hydrologic 
Cycles 
Vegetation affects continental and regional hydrology by 
influencing the processes of evapotranspiration and surface 
runoff Inclusion of vegetation in general circulation model 
simulations influences continental rainfall and other 
climate paramaters (e g , Sellers, 1987, Sato et al , 1989) 
At the regional scale, Pielke and co-workers have shown 
that vegetation influences boundary layer growth and 
dynamics, and that vegetation mosaics affect small-scale 
and meso scale circulations, convective activity and 
rainfall (Avissar and Pielke, 1989) 
At the continental scale, several simulations have been 
done on the climatic impact of complete deforestation of 
the Amazon Basin (Henderson-Sellers and Gornitz, 1984, 
Wilson, 1984, Dickinson and Henderson Sellers, 1988, 
Lean and Warrilow, 1989, Nobre et al 
1990) The 
Amazon Basin contains about half of the world s tropical 
rainforests and plays a significant role in the climate of that 
region It is estimated that approximately half of the local 
rainfall is derived from local evapotranspiration (Salati et 
al , 1978) The remainder is derived from moisture 
advected from the surrounding oceans 
A major 
modification of the forest cover could therefore have a 
significant climatic impact Reduced evapotranspiration 
and a general reduction in rainfall, although by variable 
amounts, was found in most simulations 
The studies by Lean and Warrilow (1989) and Nobre et 
al (1990) show reductions of about 20% in rainfall in 
simulations in which forest was replaced by grassland 
Lean and Warrilow showed that albedo and roughness 
changes contributed almost equally to the rainfall 
reduction 
Nobre et al suggest that the switch to a more 
seasonal rainfall regime, which they obtained, would 
prevent forest lecovery 
Recall that these simulations were ' all or nothing , forest 
or grassland 
The consequences of intermediate changes 
(partial land conversion) have not yet been studied but, 
given the nonlineanty of the coupled vegetation-climate 
system, may not be intermediate The consequences of 
fragmentation of continental ecosystems and partial 
conversion will need to be studied using mesoscale 
simulations as well as by using general circulation models, 
and both must be pursued 
Consequences of 
altered 
ecosystem-atmosphere 
exchange on runoff, resulting from changing vegetation 
have not been much studied but are of major importance 
Appropriate regional scale simulations for runoff routing 
and river flow are just now being developed (e g 
Vorosmarty et al 
1989) and will be crucial tools in 
evaluating the surface hydrology component of the 
hydrologic cycle, and its interactions with ecosystems and 
climate 
The central issue for upcoming research in this area is to 
analyze the feedbacks between vegetation and climate to 
understand how the effects of climate forcing will be 
modulated by vegetation response This question has two 
components First, the biophysical coupling between 
vegetation and the atmosphere must be understood and 
quantified to allow simulation of evapotranspiration, 
albedo and roughness as a function of vegetation attributes 
Second, the response of vegetation to climate forcing must 
be understood and quantified so that in our models 
vegetation structure and physiology can change as climate 
changes Coupling these two allows for feedback this must 
then be analyzed on a regional basis to determine the

10.3.5 Summary 
The etlects of ecosystem change on the net carbon balance 
ol terrestrial ecosystems is potentially laige but it is 
uncertain Deforestation is clearly a source ot caibon to the 
atmosphere of 1 6 + 1 0 Pg annually The net carbon 
balance ot mid-latitude ecosystems of the temperate zone is 
uncertain 
The combination of loiest regrowth and 
cutiophication ot these systems with nitiogen appeals to be 
causing them to 1 unction as carbon sinks in the range ol 1 5 
to 3 0 Pg annually The combined effects of wood burning 
and decay ol cut wood and the toxitication ot mid-latitude 
ecosystems with a variety ot pollutants may be offsetting 
the caibon uptake in these systems The magnitude of net 
carbon storage in mid latitude terrestrial ecosystems ol the 
Northern Hemisphere is very uncertain 
The management of atmospheric CCb by global-scale 
reforestation will be an enormous task To iemove just 1 Pg 
C annually by this mechanism would require a veiy large 
area 
Warmer and wetter soil conditions have the potential foi 
increasing the fluxes of CH4 and N2O from terrestrial 
ecosystems to the atmosphere If the noithern wetland soils 
aie warmed by 4°C, the CH4 flux to the atmosphere could 
increase by as much as 36 Tg annually It the soil moisture 
decreases in northern ecosystems, CH4 production would 
be decreased while CO2 flux would increase 
At the regional scale, changes in vegetation structure 
such as deforestation, have the potential to alter the 
hydrological cycle Both precipitation and surface runoff 
can be affected 
We do not yet have models to predict the 
allects of complex changes in land use patterns on regional 
hydiology 
10.4 Marine Ecosytems and Climate Change 
10.4.1 Climate Change and Community Response 
Based on the record of the past there is little doubt that 
global warming will result in different distributions of 
marine planktonic organisms than those of today (CLIMAP 
Pro|ect 1976) If the ocean warming were to be simply 
and positively correlated with latitude the expansion of 
habitat in a poleward direction which has occurred during 
the Holocene, would continue But since the rate ol change 
is expected to be very rapid (see Section 5), questions 
immediately arise regarding the potential of the biota to 
accommodate to these rates of change 
Changes in temperaUue and pieupitation will have an 
influence on the circulation of surface wateis and on the 
mixing of deep water with suiface water This mixing 
exchanges water to great depth in a few places in the ocean 
such as the North Atlantic Changes in circulation and/or a 
restriction of the mixing could reduce ocean productivity 
The palaeo record for global temperature patterns during 
lecent ice age cycles and the output of geneial circulation 
models that simulate increases in global temperatures 
resulting fiom higher concentiations of ladiatively active 
gases in the troposphere both indicate that the warmer the 
planet the less the meridional gradient in temperature 
Temperatures in polar regions could warm 2-3 times the 
global mean warming associated with a doubling of the 
equivalent 
ol 
preindustnal 
atmospheric 
CO2 
concentiations 
At high latitudes wanning would result in diminished 
temporal and spatial extent of sea-ice some models even 
predict an ice-free Arctic A significant reduction in the 
extent and persistence of sea-ice in either polar region 
would have piofound consequences for marine ecosvstems 
Sea-ice itself is a critical habitat for Arctic marine plankton 
(Clarke 1988) The underneath of the ice and interstices in 
the ice are highly pioductive habitats for plankton The low 
light in winter limits pnmaiy production in the water 
column, and the relatively high concentrations of algae 
living on and actually in the ice, are an important source ol 
food for heibivores both while sea-ice is in place and when 
it bieaks up in the spring The quantitative importance of 
sea-ice in the high latitude marine ecosystem is now well 
established with impoitant food web implications tor fish 
seabirds and marine mammals (Gulhksen and Lonne, 
1989) During the spring melting the resultant freshwater 
lens is also believed to be critical in the life cycle ot many 
pelagic polar species The most intense aggregations or 
blooms ol plankton occur at the ice margin, evidently in 
response to the density stratification resulting from the 
overlying lens of fresh water, and perhaps also in response 
to the release ot nutrient materials that had accumulated in 
the ice Although total global primary production for a 
polar region might not be very different with or without the 
ice edge 
blooms 
such transient peaks in plankton 
abundance can be cntical in the life cycle ol certain higher 
trophic level organisms, and are most definitely of 
importance in terms of the flux of carbon to deep water and 
the ocean floor 
Certain marine animals, mammals and birds in 
particular have life history strategies that reflect adaptation 
to sea ice An extreme case may be the polar bear, which 
shares ancestors with the gnz/ly bear, and would not exist 
today had it not been for the reliability of the ice habitat for 
hunting its primary prey, the seal 
In sub-polar and temperate waters the effects of global 
warming on the plankton habitat in near surface waters aie 
at piesent unpredictable Physical, chemical and biological 
conditions in these regions aie inheiently variable on both 
seasonal and annual bases This results primanly lrom the 
10 Effec ts on Ec os\ stems 
301 
variability in atmospheric forcing including surface heat 
exchange with the atmosphere and associated thermal 
stratification and destratification in the upper ocean 
seasonal storm events and associated mixing, and cloud 
cover These processes and pioperties determine the mass 
upward flux of nutrients lrom the deep ocean the residence 
time of plankton in the upper sunlit region of the water 
column, and the availability of light at the surface of the 
sea These seasonal variations in conditions give rise to 
seasonality in primary production with attendant blooms 
and corresponding high rates of organic carbon flux to the 
deep-sea (Honjo, 1984) 
Long-term oceanographic studies in several regions 
demonstrate high correlations between the abundance and 
productivity of marine ecosystems and atmospheric 
conditions A clear example of this is the 1950 80 period 
in the vicinity of the United Kingdom During this period 
there was a decline in the abundance of plankton that has 
been correlated with changes in wind stiength and direction 
(Dickson et al 
1988) Tempeiature changes per se were 
small and poorly correlated with the plankton changes and 
it is judged that changes in wind driven mixing in the upper 
ocean was the primary factor contributing to the decline in 
plankton abundance From studies such as this it seems 
likely that the type of climate changes being forecast in 
association with increased radiative forcing in the 
troposphere will have significant effects on plankton 
abundance and productivity 
In addition the effect of intensity and frequency of 
mixing events on plankton assemblages depends on the 
physiology and structure of the plankton Diatoms for 
example, arc phytoplankton that typically dominate in cold 
nutnent-nch waters such as those that aie seasonally well 
mixed 
Because they have high sinking rates diatoms 
require a turbulent mixed layer in order to remain 
successful constituents of the plankton community 
(Smayda, 1970) Diatoms are the preterred food for many 
organisms in the marine lood web and when ieplaced by 
other types of phytoplankton fish productivity can be 
dramatically reduced (Baiber and Chavez 1983) 
The 
dense cell encasement of the diatom helps to explain why 
these phytoplankton are an important contnbutoi to the flux 
of organic carbon to the deep sea 
Along-shore winds contribute to the mixing of deep 
water with surface water in many coastal wateis and acioss 
the equatorial Pacific The direction, intensity duration 
and frequency of these wind events determine the extent 
and timing of the mixing events Because this process 
which is typically highly seasonal, is very important in 
stimulating the primary production processes that lie at the 
base of the food webs for many species it can be 
anticipated that the global climate change will affect higher 
trophic levels, including iish in these legions 
10.4 2 Interaction Between the Land and the Ocean 
Climate change has the potential to change the iate of 
delivery of materials from the land to the ocean and such 
changes could aflect the biological component ol ocean 
ecosystems For example climate change could lead to an 
increase in wind erosion and the dehveiy of fine particles 
by aeohan transport from the continents to the surlace 
ocean Depending on their composition such particles 
could have either a biostimulatoiy (Martin and Fitzwater 
1987) or a biotoxic effect on oceanic productivity and othei 
marine processes Similarly climate change could increase 
water-driven erosion and the amount of material 
transported to the world s coastal oceans by river systems 
Again the effects will be dependent on the nature of the 
terrestrial material 
10 4 3 Interactions 
Between 
the Ocean 
and 
the 
Atmosphere 
Climate-induced changes in ocean ecology are of 
importance in relation both to the sustainability and man 
agement of living resources and to biogeochemical 
feedback on the climate system Several atmosphciic 
feedback processes are well-defined in General Circulation 
Models but those relating to ocean productivity are not yet 
sufficiently well understood to be included The three main 
effects of global warming that are expected to opeiate on 
ocean plankton (as mentioned above) would all tend to 
decrease the ocean uptake of CO? i e a positive feedback 
Ocean waters are currently a major source of di-
methylsulphide (DMS) to the atmosphere The oxidized 
products of this DMS which is produced by plankton may 
increase cloudiness through nucleation on sulphate aerosols 
in the troposphere (Charlson et al 1987) and may increase 
albedo in the stratosphere lrom sulphate aerosols 
(Ryaboshapko 
1983) 
One gioup ol plankton 
the 
Coccohthophonds are apparently a major source ol DMS 
and their bloom processes would most likely respond 
although in uncertain ways 
to changes in ocean-
atmospheie exchanges resulting liom climate change 
While neithei the direction nor magnitude of many ol 
these effects is known with certainty changes from 
present day values are expected to be greatest in mid to 
high latitude ocean iegions There is evidence toi major 
changes in the functioning of North Atlantic ecosystems in 
the transitions between glacial and inter-glacial penods 
(Broecker and Denton 1990) supporting the view that 
changes in ocean plankton, once initiated may enhance the 
iate of climate change (the plankton multiplier) until a 
new neai equilibrium is reached 
10 4 4 The Carbon System and the Biological Pump

106 
Effects on Ecosystems 
10 
38,000 Pg carbon Only a small fraction is CO2 (mole 
fraction 0 5 percent), the bicarbonate ion with a mole 
traction of 90 percent and the carbonate ion with a mole 
fraction of just under 10 percent are the dominant forms of 
dissolved inorganic carbon The dissolved organic carbon 
pool has been reported to be similar in size to the pool of 
terrestrial soil carbon, but recent data suggest that it may in 
fact be considerably larger 
Although the oceans are the largest active reservoirs of 
carbon and cover 70 percent of the globe the total marine 
biomass is only about 3 x Pg carbon (though such estimates 
are uncertain at best), or just over 0 5 percent of the carbon 
stored in terrestrial vegetation On the other hand, the total 
primary production is 30 to 40 x Pg carbon/yr A portion of 
this production results in a sink for atmospheric C02, 
primarily through the sinking of particulate carbon As a 
consequence of this biological pump, the concentration 
of dissolved inorganic carbon is not uniform with depth, 
the concentration in surface waters is 10 to 15 percent less 
than that in deeper waters There is a corresponding 
depletion of phosphorus and nitrogen in surface waters, 
even in areas of intense upwelling, as a result of biological 
uptake and loss of detntal material 
The fate of this material depends, in part upon its 
chemical characteristics If it is in the form of organic 
tissue, then it is oxidized at intermediate depths which 
results in an oxygen minimum and a carbon nitrogen, and 
phosphorus maximum If it is carbonate it dissolves below 
the lysochne, raising both alkalinity and the concentration 
of carbon, at depths where the high pressure increases the 
solubility of calcium carbonate 
Thus the biological pump' lowers the partial pressure of 
CO2 in surface waters and enhances the partial pressure in 
waters not in contact with the atmosphere The functioning 
of the biological pump involves the supply of nutrients to 
surface waters, food web dynamics, and sinking losses of 
particulates to the deep sea It may be expected to respond 
both to changes in the strength of the overall thermohahne 
circulation and to variations in the abundance of nutrients 
primarily nitrogen and phosphorus 
A portion of the nutrient flux to the surface returns to the 
deep sea unused by the biota carried along by the return 
flow of waters in downwelhng systems at high latitude It 
is important to define the physical, chemical and biological 
processes that regulate the concentration of organic 
nutrients in descending water masses, the flux of so-called 
preformed nutrients 
The concentration of preformed 
nutrients may be expected to reflect physical processes, and 
it can be influenced also by biological activity to the extent 
that this activity can result in packaging of carbon 
nitrogen and phosphate in fecal material that can fall to the 
deep, providing a path for transfer of nutrients from the 
surface to the deep independent of the physical processes 
such as those responsible for the formation of deep water in 
high latitudes 
10.4.5 
Summary 
Climate change can affect the productivity and the storage 
of organic carbon in marine ecosystems The community 
composition of marine ecosystems will also be affected 
Details of these effects cannot be predicted at the present 
time There is also the possibility that the net exchange of 
trace gases (e g , organic sulphur gases) between the oceans 
and the atmosphere could be altered but this, too, is 
uncertain

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The IPCC has the responsibility for assessing both the state of 
scientific knowledge of climate and climatic changes due to 
human influences The World Climate Research Programme 
(WCRP), sponsored by the World Meteorological Organization 
(WMO) and the International Council for Scientific Unions 
(ICSU), and the International Geosphere Biosphere Programme 
(IGBP), sponsored by ICSU, together constitute the international 
framework of the quest for scientific understanding of climate and 
global change 
The scientific strategy to achieve effective prediction of the 
behaviour of the climate system must be based on a combination 
of process studies, observation and modelling Sections 1 to 10 of 
this report identified several areas of scientific uncertainty and 
shortcomings To narrow these uncertainties, substantial scientific 
activities need to be undertaken The following 5 areas are 
considered the most critical 
1) 
control of the greenhouse gases by the Earth system, 
2) 
control of radiation by clouds, 
3) 
precipitation and evaporation, 
4) 
ocean transport and storage of heat, and 
5) 
ecosystem processes 
Within the WCRP, the Global Energy and Water Cycle 
Experiment (GEWEX) is addressing (2) and (3), while the World 
Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) is concerned with (4) and 
parts of (1) Two core activities of the IGBP, the Joint Global 
Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) and the International Global 
Atmospheric Chemistry Piogramme (IGAC) are designed to 
investigate the contiol of gieenhouse gases by the oceanic and 
terrestrial biospheres while the Biospheric Aspects of the 
Hydrological Cycle (BAHC) is a complement to GEWEX that 
also addresses (3) An additional coie pioject ol the IGBP focuses 
on Global Change and Tenestnal Ecosystems (GCTE) Both the 
WCRP and IGBP have other essential coie activities such as the 
Tropical Oceans - Global Atmospheie (TOGA) Programme and 
the study of Past Global Changes (PAGES), that contnbute to 
these efforts to reduce unceitaintics in climate piedictions 
Narrowing the unceitaintics in tutuie climate change 
predictions requires stiongly enhanced national paiticipation in 
these internationally cooidmated pmgiamines 
This will require increased commitments to the endeavouis of 
the WCRP and the IGBP These piogiammes aie the iesult ol 
many years ol planning and ihey icpiesent consensus statements 
of the international science community icgaiding the matuut) ol 
the fundamentals that underpin these projects and the readiness of 
the community to commit to these timely endeavours 
In order to proceed with this agenda, all nations must reaffirm 
their commitment to observe and document the fundamental 
aspects of the climate system and the changes occurring within it, 
including 
1) 
improvement of the global atmosphere and land surfaces 
observing system The World Weather Watch and Global 
Atmospheric Watch need to be fully implemented and 
augmented 
by 
improved 
atmospheric 
sounders 
radiometers and wind observations, active sensors lor wind 
and rain, vegetation sensors, and an improved commitment 
to quality control and archival of all data, 
2) 
development of a global ocean and ice observing system 
Satellite observations of ocean surface tempcratuie, wind 
and topography, sea-ice concentiation and colour 
operational upper-ocean heat and freshwater monitoring 
and systematic sea-level and deep-ocean measurements are 
required, 
3) 
establishment of a comprehensive system loi climate 
monitoring It is essential that existing netwoiks (WWW 
GAW, IGOSS, GEMS, GSLS) be maintained and wheic 
appropriate, enhanced Special attention needs to be given 
to calibration and quality control, documentation and 
international coordination and data exchange 
The analysis and interpretation of the observational data will 
require the understanding arising from the piojects ol the WCRP 
and the IGBP, and will involve the use of more relined climate 
models The next generation of predictive models will requiie 
additional computing resources in order to incorporate the more 
sophisticated understanding of the climate system ansing horn 
this research effort This effort will lead to predictions that have 
higher spatial resolution than can be attained at this time 
The time scales for narrowing the uncertainties must be 
measured in terms ot several years to more than a decade 
Advances must await the conduct ol several major experiments 
many ot which will be about a decade in duration and the 
development of new technologies for space based obsei vation and 
numerical computation 
It is essential that government funding 
agencies recognize the magnitude ol both the financial and human 
iesourccs needed to undertake these research progiamines and 
make the necessary commitments

11.1 Introduction 
In order to deal with the issues posed by increased 
atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and to prepare 
human societies for the impacts of climate change, climate 
predictions must become more reliable and precise 
Present shortcomings include 
Significant uncertainty, by a range of three, regarding 
the sensitivity of the global average temperature and 
mean sea-level to the increase in greenhouse gases, 
Even larger uncertainties regarding regional climatic 
impacts, such that current climate change predictions 
have little meaning for any particular location, 
Uncertainty in the timing ot the expected climate 
change, 
Uncertainty in the natural variations 
To overcome these shortcomings, substantial imp-
rovements are required in scientilic understanding which 
will depend on the creative ettorts of individual scientists 
and groups Nevertheless the scale of the task demands 
international coordination and strong national participation

The IPCC has responsibility lor assessing the current 
state of scientific knowledge of climate and climatic 
changes due to human mlluences 
The World 
Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the International 
Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU) established in 1980 
the World Climate Research Piogramme (1) to promote 
scientific research on physical climate processes and to 
develop a capability loi predicting climate variations 
Several major internationally coordinated climate research 
projects organized by the WCRP are now underway The 
Intergovernmental Oceanogiaphic Commission (IOC) 
assists with the oceanogiaphic component Furthermoie 
ICSU established in 1986 the International Geospheie-
Biosphere Programme (2) to study the interactive physical 
chemical and biological processes lesponsible loi change 
in the Earth system especially those which are most 
susceptible to change on time scales ot decades to 
centuries The IGBP with its emphasis on biogeochemical 
aspects and the WCRP with its emphasis on physical 
aspects, together constitute the international framework ot 
the quest for the scientific understanding of global change 
This report deals with climate change but it must be 
stressed that climate change is but one of a wide range of 
environmental issues that are confronting the world Many 
of these issues are linked and scientific study of one issue 
will frequently aid in understanding others

11.2 Problem Areas and Scientific Responses 
To achieve effective prediction ot the behaviour ot the 
climate system wc must recognize that this system is 
intluenced b> a complex array ot interacting physical 
chemical and biological processes The scientific strategy 
to address these processes must include both observation 
and modelling We must be able to understand the 
mechanisms responsible for past and present variations and 
to incorporate these mechanisms into suitable models ot the 
natural system The models can then be uin forward in time 
to simulate the evolution ot the climate system Such a 
programme includes three essential steps 
?/<s 
Nai i cm ini> the Unt ei tamties 11 
Analysis of observational data, often obtained Irom 
incomplete and indirect measurements, to produce 
coherent information and understanding, 
Application of observational information and under 
standing to construct and validate time-dependent 
mathematical models of natural processes, 
Running such models forward to produce predictions 
that can (and must) be tested against observations to 
determine their "skill" or reliability over relatively 
short time-periods 
Sections I to 10 of this assessment have identified 
several areas of scientific uncertainty 
The following 5 
areas are considered the most critical 
11.2.1 Control of the Greenhouse Gases by the Earth 
System 
Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere such as carbon 
dioxide and methane, are part of vast natural cycles Foi 
some greenhouse gases, the current rates of release which 
are directly attributable to human activities are small 
percentages of large natural fluxes between the atmosphere 
the ocean and terrestrial ecosystems while foi otheis 
human activities result in dominant emissions 
The 
atmospheric carbon content is a very small tiaction of 
existing reservoirs of carbon in ocean waters and 
sediments Relatively minor adjustments in the world ocean 
circulation and chemistry, or in the life cycle ot teirestnal 
vegetation, could significantly affect the amount of CO2 or 
CH4 in the atmosphere, even were anthropogenic 
emissions to be stabilized In particular, global warming is 
likely to decrease the absorption of carbon dioxide by sea 
water and lead to widespread melting of methane gas 
hydrates in and under the permaltost and also release CH4 
Conversely, positive changes in the biogenic storage of 
carbon in the ocean could increase the oceanic CO2 uptake 
and ameliorate the greenhouse effect 
Current 
knowledge of oceanic 
and 
teirestnal 
biogeochemical processes is not yet sufficient to account 
quantitatively for exchanges between the atmosphere, 
ocean and land vegetation (Section 1) The international 
loint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) a core pro|ect of 
IGBP has been designed to investigate the oceanic 
biogeochemical processes relating to the cycle of carbon in 
the ocean and to assess the capacity of the ocean tor 
absorbing CCo O) A central question being addressed 
iclatcs to the role of the ocean and its circulation (sec 
description ot the World Ocean Cnculation Experiment in 
Section 112 4) in the uptake of CO2 pioduced fiom the 
burning of fossil fuels This uptake occuis via both physical 
and biological processes Neithei is well quantified on a 
global scale, and the regulation of the biological processes 
is at present onl\ poorly undeistood In paiticular the 
biogeochemical processes responsible foi the long-teim 
stoiage of a portion of the total primary pioduction cannot 
at this time be resolved sufficiently in time and space to say 
how they might be affected by climate change The first 
component of JGOFS, relating to piocess studies, began 
with a pilot study in the North Atlantic in 1989 Two time-
series of measurements have been initiated at stations in 
the vicinity of Bermuda and Hawaii JGOFS will result in 
an order ot magnitude impiovement in the precision of the 
assessment of the ocean s role in sequestering CO2 from 
the atmosphere 
(3) The Joint Global Flux Study (JGOFS), a c 01 e pi Ojec t

Another core project 
the International 
Global 
Atmospheric Chemistry Programme (IGAC), is being 
designed to investigate the interactions between atmos-
pheric chemistry and the terrestrial biosphere, particularly 
fluxes of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrogen oxides (4) 
11 2.2 Control of Radiation by Clouds 
Radiation is the pnmaiy energy source of the climate 
system and the pnncipal heat input to the oceans (Section 
2) These Muxes are very sensitive to the amount, 
distribution and optical properties of water and ice clouds 
(Sections 1 and 5) and are central to the problem of 
giecnhouse heating Aerosols also influence the net 
radiative flux at the surface The net heat flux to the ocean 
determines the late of ocean warming and volume 
expansion which is likely to be the largest contribution to 
the global use ot the mean sea-level during the next 
century if the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets aie 
neither gaining noi losing mass (Section 9)

Global Atmospheric 
Chemistry 
Programme (IGAC), a coie pioject of the IGBP, is jointly 
organized with ICSU's Commission on Atmosphei ic 
Chemistiy and Global Pollution

aie of ielevance to climate 
For the past two decades, the Earth radiation budget at 
the top of the atmosphere has been measured from 
satellites The most recent radiometric measurement (Earth 
Radiation Budget Experiment) discriminates between 
cloudy and cloud-free areas, thus providing direct 
determination of the net energetic effect of clouds in the 
present climate This information is not enough, however, 
to distinguish between the effect of different types of 
clouds at different altitudes The ongoing International 
Satellite Cloud Climatology Project of WCRP (started in 
1983) is working to assemble global statistics of the 
distribution and properties of different cloud types 
In 
order to quantify the interannual variability of cloud 
systems, ten or more years of data are required Because of 
the importance of changes in cloudiness in the radiation 
budget, these measurements must be continued Process 
studies will be important in the study ol feedbacks such as 
cloud-radiation interaction and its dependence on cloud 
water content, particle size and altitude 
Further modelling and observational research will 
nevertheless 
be 
necessary 
to achieve 
accurate 
representation in climate models of the role of clouds and 
radiation 
The WCRP's Global Energy and Water Cycle 
Experiment (GEWEX), discussed more fully in Section 
112 3, has as one of its objectives the moie precise 
quantitative deduction ol all energy (luxes within the 
atmosphere and at the air-sea and an land interfaces (5)

Achieving the objectives of GEWEX will require the 
development of major new instruments to be flown on the 
next generation of multi-disciplinary satellite platforms in 
polar orbit or on the International Space Station and co 
orbiting platforms (Earth Observing System, EOS) 
For 
this reason, the main GEWEX observing period must be 
timed to start with the launch of these satellite systems 
(expected in 1997 to 2000) 
The Experiment will last 
approximately five years and scientific interpretation and 
application of the results will take several luithcr years

11.2 3 Precipitation and Evaporation 
The condensation of water is the main energy source of the 
atmospheric heat engine and the transport ol water vapoui 
by the atmospheric circulation is a key process in the 
redistribution of the sun s energy in the Earth system 
Water vapour is also an important greenhouse gas The 
vertical distribution of latent heating in precipitating clouds 
has a large effect on the large-scale circulation of the 
atmosphere Precipitating clouds also play an important 
role in the general circulation through their effect on 
vertical transport of heat, moisture and momentum The 
inflow of fresh water at high latitudes is a major lactor in 
determining sea water buoyancy which forces the ocean 
cuculation The rates of accumulation of snow and the 
ablation of ice in the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets are 
important sources ot uncertainty for sea level rise dunng 
the next century (Section 9) Changes in the hydrological 
regime, precipitation and evapoiation and consequent 
change in soil moisture and the availability of liesh water 
resources, are the most serious potential consequences of 
impending climate change in terms ot its elfect on man 
Unfortunately, present quantitative knowledge of the 
Luge-scale watci budget is still very poor For example, it 
has not yet been possible to measure or deduce from 
existing measurements either global precipitation or global 
evaporation (Section 7) About one third of the water run 
oil from continents to the ocean takes place as How in 
small ungauged coastal rivers or underground aquifers 
Much improved quantitative assessments of these 
components of the global water cycle aie essential to 
achieve accurate predictions of luture water resources in a 
changed climate Values of precipitation and evaporation at 
sea can be inferred only roughly fiom general circulation 
models or satellite observations 
To address these and the other problems mentioned in 
Section 112 2 WCRP has launched the GEWEX 
programme (5) and specific projects aimed at the collection 
and analysis of observations available at piesent, such as 
the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (started in 
1988) and the Global Run off Data Project (1980) The 
Global Pi capitation Climatology Project has undertaken to 
combine all available rain gauge measurements and 
meteorological data with satellite observations ol rain-
clouds to produce the first global climatological record of 
monthly-mean total precipitation, including over the 
oceans These projects requne increased support by 
operational meteorological and hydrological agencies to 
upgiade the woildwide collection and exchange of essential 
ground-based measuiements of rain snow and river flow 
An ensemble ot modelling and held studies of 
atmosphcuc and hydrological processes has already been 
initiated The most signihcant achievements towards this 
objective are hydrological atmosphcuc held studies aiming 
to close the energy and water budget of a land parcel ol 
size commensurate with the spatial resolution of a general 
circulation model A series of regional-scale (10 to 100 km) 
field studies (Hydrological Atmospheric Pilot Experiments, 
HAPEX, First ISLSCP Field Experiment and others) in 
different major ecosystems was started in 1986 and future 
experiments will continue to the end ot the century 
Cooperation between WCRP and IGBP is being pursued to 
take into account the role of biological processes in 
evapotranspiration from terrestrial vegetation and, 
conversely, the effect of climate change on terrestrial 
ecosystems Hydiological models of a continent-size nvei 
basin driven by daily precipitation and evaporation 
estimated lrom analysed meteorological fields, are now 
being developed and will be applied during a continental-
scale project in the mid-1990s Other programmes, such as 
the Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment of 
the TOGA Programme, aie important for determining the 
physical processes within mesoscale convective cloud 
systems 
/ / 2.4 Ocean Transport and Storage of Heat 
The ocean plays a major role in the climate system through 
its storage and transport of heat The response time of the 
upper ocean is relatively short (months to years) compared 
to the deeper ocean It is now recognized that the largest 
portion of the interannual variability of the climate system 
is linked to the tropical oceans For this reason, the 
Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere (TOGA) Programme 
(6) was originated and it is maintaining an intensive 
observational programme lrom 1985 to 1995 In addition, 
the TOGA Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere 
Response 
Experiment (COARE) is planned for the mid-1990s, to 
investigate the coupling between the warm western tropical 
Pacific Ocean through cloud dynamics, with the high 
atmosphere With the TOGA observational array of buoys, 
current meters, and ships, it has been possible to investigate 
the evolution of the tiopical ocean and to initiate 
experimental forecasts of the El Nino phenomenon 
(6) The WCRP's Tropical Ocean - Global Atmosphere

If the atmosphere and upper-ocean alone weie 
responding to the increase in greenhouse heating and the 
cloud-radiation feedback opeiated according to cuncnt 
knowledge, then the surface of the Earth would already be 
1 to 2°C warmer than the temperatures of the nineteenth 
century The response of the Earth s climate to increased 
greenhouse heating is being reduced by the thermal inertia 
of the ocean, determined by the largely unknown rate of 
penetration of heat into the upper 1000 metres Deep ocean 
warming results mainly from water sinking at high 
latitudes, frequently in the presence of sea ice, and 
subsequent circulation in the ocean Quantitative modelling 
of the global ocean circulation is essential to deteimine the 
timing of global warming The WCRP World Ocean 
Circulation Experiment (7) will provide the understanding 
and observations of the global ocean to enable the 
development of these ocean models

the WCRP is a woildwide oceanoqiapliic piOI>Iamine to

Three new satellite missions in support of WOCE are in 
the final stages of preparation or being planned 
The US-French TOPEX-POSEIDON precision alti-
metry mission, to measure the ocean surface 
topography with unprecedented accuracy for the 
purpose of determining ocean circulation (to be 
launched in 1992), 
The European Space Agency ERS-1 and ERS 2 
missions to measure wave height and ocean surface 
topography, wind stiess and tempeiatuic at the 
surface of the ocean (to be launched in 1991 and 
1994), 
The US-Japanese ADEOS project to piovide in par-
ticular, more complete observations of the wind 
stress over the global ocean (to be launched in 1994) 
Oceanographic agencies and institutions are joining 
forces to deploy the research vessel fleet needed to 
implement the WOCE hydrographic and geochemical 
surveys at sea, which call for 25 ship years The con-
centration of a number of chemicals and isotopes will be 
measured throughout the ocean 
By studying the 
distribution of substances that entered the environment at 
different times over the last century, geochemists and 
ocean modellers can estimate the time scales associated 
with the slow renewal and circulation of the ocean s deep 
water masses 
WOCE systems are to be activated for live years only 
Maintaining systematic observations ol essential ocean-
ogiaphic quantities after WOCE, to monitor the changes 
taking place in the ocean and to define the state of the 
global ocean circulation from which further dynamical 
predictions could be made, is a requirement which remains 
to be put into effect (Section 11 12) 
11.2.5 Ecosystem Processes 
As indicated above, both terrestrial and marine ecosystems 
are important as sources and sinks of biogenic gases that 
have radiative properties in the atmosphere In addition, 
terrestrial ecosystems play an important role in the 
exchange of moisture and therefore energy between the 
land surface and overlying atmosphere Thus predictions of 
climate, driven by anthropogenic increases in the 
atmospheric content of greenhouse gases must take into 
consideration the likelihood that leedback from ecosystems 
will be altered by climate change itself Tempoial and 
spatial patterns in temperature, precipitation and nutrient 
deposition (including extreme events) will directly affect 
soils, plant productivity, vegetation structuie 
and 
community composition This influence is not limited to 
natural ecosystems, it also imposes regional const!aints on 
agriculture and forestry Large scale displacement ol 
particular ecosystems will affect the climate system by 
altenng local surface roughness and albedo 
A more quantitative understanding of the function of 
ecosystems in climate is important In particular research 
is needed to provide better global observations of the 
nature and extent of vegetation and soils 
In addition ;/; 
situ studies must be scaled up to investigate the physio-
logical and ecological processes that configure an eco-
system response to climate change The inteiprctation of 
such data icquircs a modelling appioach that also includes 
the ability of community constituents to migrate away from 
a unsuitable climate regime The full use of this mloi-
mation in climate predictions requires higher resolution 
models (50 km) capable of simulating exliunc conditions 
322 
Narr owing the Uncertainties 11 
and the full range of the seasonal cycle The IGBP is 
engaged in planning new studies of climate and land use 
changes on ecosystems, and their attendant feedbacks on 
climate Partly to address these ecosystem dimensions of 
climate regulation, the IGBP has established a core project 
on Global Change and Terrestrial Ecosystems (GCTE) (8) 
(8) Global Change and Terrestrial Ecosystems (GCTE) is 
a core piojeit 
of the IGBP, aimed at developing the 
capacity to pi edict the effects of changes in climate 
atmospheric 
composition and land-use piactices 
on 
terrestrial ecosystems 
This capacity is lequned 
both 
because the ecosystem changes aie of duect importance to 
humans, and because they will ha\e a feedback effect on 
fuithei evapotianspnation, albedo and surface toughness 
The project has two mam foci Ecosystem "Plnsiology" 
the exchanges 
of energy and materials, 
and then 
distribution and stoiaqe - and Ecosystem Structure - the 
changes in species (functional type) composition and 
physiognomic structure, on the patch, landscape and 
r egional (c ontinental) scales The pi ojec t is based on close 
integration of experimentation and modelling It consists 
of sex en core actixities, each of which is made up of a 
number of particular tasks, which include such topics as 
ele\ cited CO2 effects on ecosystem functioning changes in 
the biogeoc hemic al eye ling of C,N P and S, soil dynamics 
\ egetation dynamic s and chan ges in spatial patter ns 
11.3 Requirements for Narrowing Uncertainties in 
Future Climate Change 
Climate research can provide a valuable service to society 
by providing the means for detection of future climate 
change, quantitative prediction of the timing and rate of the 
expected global changes and assessments of probable 
regional effects In order to achieve these goals, it is 
necessary to develop a comprehensive Global Earth 
Observing System, to develop improved climate models 
and to acquire new scientific knowledge As shown in 
Figure 111, there is an essential symbiosis between 
observations and modelling Observations are required for 
long-term climate monitoring, especially for detection of 
climate change, and tor local process studies Modelling is 
required to support process studies as well as to provide the 
vehicle lor climate predictions 
Observations and 
modelling are brought together to develop an under-
standing of the components of the climate system At 
present modelling and data assimilation studies are limited 
by availability ot computer time large increases in 
computer resources are a majoi icquirement A second 
major limitation on the advancement ol climate research is 
the shortage of highly trained scientists

11.3.1 Improvement of the Global Atmosphere and Land 
Surfaces Observing System 
Basic information on climatic processes, climate variations 
and systematic trends originates from the operational 
meteorological observing systems of the World Weather 
Watch, complemented by various operational hydrological 
networks and environmental measurements of the Global 
Atmospheric Watch (9) In addition to the maintenance of 
the basic meteorological systems, specific improvements 
are needed, in particular 
a) 
improved infrared and microwave atmospheric 
sounding instruments on meteorological satellites, to 
obtain 
more 
accurate 
temperature/moisture 
information with better vertical resolution in the 
troposphere (e g , high spectral resolution infrared 
spectrometer/radiometer), 
b) 
improved troposphenc wind observations from 
geostationary satellites (cloud-drift winds) and 
platforms in low Earth-orbit (Doppler wind lidar), 
c) 
rain-radars and passive multiple-frequency imaging 
radiometers in the microwave spectrum, to estimate 
rainfall over the whole globe, and 
d) 
radiometers to determine more accurately the Earth's 
radiation budget 
Temporal and spatial patterns in key vegetation 
properties can, when calibrated and interpreted in the 
context of ground-truth data, be efficiently studied with 
satellite sensors These data are critical in detecting 
regional shifts in ecosystem form and function in response 
to climate and land use changes Sustaining these activities 
at levels appropriate to the study of climate change

11.3.2 
Development 
of a Global Ocean and Ice 
Observing System 
From the perspective of global climate change, systematic 
ongoing observations ol the global ocean are needed tor 
several purposes The key to predicting the rate of change 
of the global system is to be found in observations of the 
ocean circulation and heat storage 
Predictions of future 
climate change will eventually be carried out starting from 
the observed state of the combined atmosphere and ocean 
system An example of this approach is the forecast of El 
Nino and other tropical climate disturbances by the WCRP 
Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere (TOGA) 
Programme 
A comprehensive ocean and ice observing system 
requires 
a) 
satellite observations of the ocean surlace temp-
erature, wind and topography sea ice concentration 
and chlorophyll content (ocean colour), and of the 
topography of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets, 
by an international array of space platforms in 
suitable orbits around the Earth 
b) 
an international operational upper-ocean monitoring 
programme, to determine the time and space 
dependent distribution of heat and fresh water in 
upper ocean layers, seasonal variations and long-term 
trends, and 
c) 
an international progiamme of systematic sea-level 
and deep-ocean measurements, at suitable time and 
space intervals, to determine the state ol the ocean 
circulation, ocean volume and transport of heat 
11.3.3 Establishment of a Comprehensive System for 
Climate Monitoring 
In the previous two sections (11 ^ 1 and 
11^2) 
improvements to the global atmosphere and land suilace 
observing system and development of a global ocean and 
ice observing system were discussed These observing 
systems must be coupled with existing observing systems 
to establish a comprehensive system loi climate 
monitoring It must be recognized that the requuements for 
climate monitoring are different from those lor weather 
prediction Failure to recognize this in the past means that 
there arc a number of unccitainties which have been 
introduced into long-term climatological time series 
A 
long-term commitment is now needed by the world s 
national weather services to monitor climate vanations and 
change Changes and improvements in observational 
networks should be introduced in a way which will lead to 
continuous, consistent long-term data sets sufficiently 
accurate to document changes and variations in climate (9) 
Some observing systems have and will be established lor 
research purposes These research systems are usually ot 
limited duiation and area and may have dilleient emphases 
from a climate monitoring system (Figure 11 1) Howevei 
it is important that these observations also be mtegiated 
with the information horn long-teim monitoung systems 
Satellite observations are not yet ol long enough duration 
to document climate variations In order lor these data lo 
be most useful, it is veiy important that the> be analysed 
and interpreted with existing //; situ dala High pnonty 
should be given to the blending oi integiation ol spaced-
based and in situ data sets in such a way as lo build upon 
the strengths of each type of data Examples ol ongoing 
projects that have used mixed satellite data sets caielul 
cross calibration and coordinated data processing to 
produce global data sets are the WCRPs International 
Satellite Cloud Climatology Pro|ect (ISCCP) and the 
Global Piecipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) Foi 
some applications 
it is necessary to assimilate the 
obseivations into opeiational numcnuil weathei prediction 
models for which purpose the observations need lo be 
available in near ieal time All satellite instiumcnts should 
be calibrated both pnoi to launch and in I light For those 
instruments now in operation techniques should be 
developed to prevent or detect instrument dull In planning 
U4 
Nai i cm ing the Unc ei tamties 11 
new satellite observations for long-teim monitoring, special 
attention should be paid to continuity of calibration and 
processing, archival and access to the data 
It is, furthei, imperative that there be strengthened 
international agreements and procedures tor international 
exchange of existing basic climatological data (e g , rain-
gauge measurements and/or meteorological satellite data) 
National data centres must make available, through free 
exchange, to the world climate community, data sets 
collected in their countries 
Existing CLIMAT and 
international data exchange (World Weather Records) must 
include essential variables which aie absent at present For 
most climate variables, the spatial and temporal iesolution 
ot the exchanged data is inadequate, precluding world-wide 
analyses of extremes New methods of international 
exchange may be needed For a worldwide ocean mon-
itoring system there are requirements for streng thening 
international agreements to facilitate standard temperature, 
salinity and velocity measurements by all vessels and 
oceanographic drifting platforms within national Exclusive 
Economic Zones Agreements among scientists and 
lesearch institutions for international sharing of ocean-
ographic data need to be strengthened 
There remains considerable data in manuscript form, 
which will prove valuable in producing more definitive 
analyses ot climate change and variability These data 
should be documented in computer compatible form These 
and proxy data, including palaeo climate data, are needed 
to reconstiuct variations in past climates In many cases, 
spatial and temporal resolution needs to be improved 
Palaeodata can be particulaily valuable in testing 
hypotheses regarding the mechanisms that have in the past 
linked physical and biogeochemical aspects of climate 
change The IGBP has established a core project spec-
lhcally foi studying Past Global Changes (PAGES) (10) 
The WMO has undertaken to strengthen its activities to 
monitoi the chemical composition and other characteristics 
ol the atmosphere, away lrom pollution sources, and to 
incoiporate these activities into a coordinated Global 
Atmospheie Watch (GAW) piogramme 
The main 
objective ol GAW is to establish a global monitoring 
nelwoik ol about 20 observatoues complemented by 
regional stations whenever possible 
In addition to the above-mentioned needs to improve 
available instiuments and methods to observe various 
climate parameteis the development ol a compiehcnsive 
system for monitoring climate change around the world is 
likely to be required under a con\cntion on climate change

11.3.4 Development of Climate Models 
Improved prediction of climate change depends on the 
development of climate models, which is the objective of 
the climate modelling programme of the WCRP 
Atmospheric general circulation models are based on 
numerical models used with considerable success by the 
national weather services to predict weather several days 
ahead However, when adapted for climate prediction, 
these models need to be extended in several ways, all of 
which place heavy demands on computer resources 
Extending the period of integration from days to decades 
has already been achieved, but so far only at the expense of 
poor spatial resolution and/or inadequate representation of 
the interaction between the atmosphere and the oceans In 
addition, some feedback mechanisms in the climate system 
depend on biological chemical interactions, the propei 
understanding ot which aie key tasks for the IGBP 
The oceans are represented in most climate models in a 
very simplified way that docs not properly simulate the 
ocean s ability to absorb heat and hence retard (and to some 
extent alter the pattein ol) global warming These (so-
called equilibrium) models provide an estimate ot eventual 
climate changes but not the rate at which these will take 
place In ordei to predict the evolution of climate 
realistically, it is nccessaiy to develop fuither a new 
generation of models in which the atmosphere and oceans 
(and sea-ice) are fully coupled and in which the circulation 
ol the oceans as well as the atmosphere is explicitly 
11 Nai i owinq the Unc ei tamties 
US 
computed The oceans have important eddies occurring on 
small scales and fine spatial resolution is essential for their 
explicit representation in a realistic manner 
Finer resolution than used at present is also required for 
the atmospheric component if regional variations of climate 
are to be predicted Present day climate models do not have 
sufficient resolution to represent in a meaningful way the 
climate of specific regions as small as, for example, the 
majority of individual nations The implementation of finer 
resolution models will require significant advances in 
computer capability such as can be expected within the 
next 5 to 10 years Improved parameterization of cloud and 
other processes will also need to be incorporated To 
develop these parametenzations, very-fine mesh models 
will need to be developed, covering domains large enough 
to embrace entire mesoscale convective cloud systems, and 
appropriate field experiments will need to be carried out in 
different regions to provide input data and validation 
Models are required not only for prediction and process 
studies, but also for analysing the inevitably incomplete 
observational data sets to reconstruct and monitor climate 
change Appropriate 4-dimensional data assimilation 
techniques exist for observations of atmospheric temp-
erature and wind, but substantial improvements over the 
course of the next decade are needed to extend these 
methods for assimilating other parameters such as 
precipitation Similar techniques will also be required for 
the analysis of ocean observations 
The development ot advanced geosphere-biosphere 
models will be an important task lor the IGBP 
Such 
models are needed to introduce, as dynamic variables, the 
biological source and sink terms into descriptions of the 
way in which greenhouse gases will vary with climate 
change That will become feasible with supercomputers 
available early in the 21st century Such models will 
simulate detailed events with sufficient spatial and 
temporal resolution to permit explicit treatment ot the 
strong non-linear interactions between physics, chemistiy 
and biology that occur on small scales 
Model validation is a prerequisite to reducing uncert-
ainties The interaction between observational data and 
numerical modelling is a continuing process It is essential 
for the development and testing of these models, for their 
operation and for their validation and eventual application 
to prediction Confidence in models depend on com-
parisons with observations Modellers must identify data 
sets needed, their temporal and spatial scales of meas-
urement and the required accuracy and simultaneity of 
observations The observational system must be designed 
to provide such measurements and the data analysis and 
information system must be able to transform these 
measurements into usable parameteis 
11.3.5 International Research on Climate and Global 
Change 
Carrying out this global multi-disciplinary progiamine 
requires unprecedented co-operation of the world scientilic 
community and task sharing by reseaich institutions and 
responsible national administrations 
with long-term 
commitments of support Inasmuch as global climate 
change is recognized as a problem concerning all nations 
establishing an effective global climate monitoring and 
prediction system must also be recognized as a 
responsibility to be shared by all nations For the physical 
aspects of the climate system, reseaich on the clouds and 
radiation, the global water cycle and the oceans should be 
given highest priority at this time Within the Woild 
Climate Research Programme, this includes the Global 
Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) and World 
Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) Resouice com-
mitments are required as a matter of urgency Regaiding 
biogeochemical aspects of the climate system, lescaich on 
the role of the ocean and the terrestrial biosphcie as sources 
and sinks of greenhouse gases should be given highest 
priority Within the International Geospheie-Biosphere 
Programme, this includes the Joint Global Ocean Flux 
Study (JGOFS) and the International Global Atmospheric 
Chemistry Programme (IGAC) Internationally coordinated 
lesearch on the role of ecosystems in climate, including a 
biosphenc contribution to GEWEX through an IGBP core 
project on BAHC, is now being organized These studies 
will be an obvious complement to climate studies and be 
important in laying the sound foundation for assessing the 
effects of climate change on ecosystem functions and 
subsequent feedbacks to the climate system 
As noted earlier, there are strong interactions between 
climate change and other global environmental issues A 
research programme on climate change will provide 
valuable insight into these issues and as we gam 
understanding of the functioning ot the total Earth system 
research programmes will need to be modified and 
refrained in terms of a research programme aimed at 
supporting global environmental management in all its 
aspects 
It is recognized that there are important scientific 
questions that are being addressed by national and other 
research programmes independently of these international 
programmes The emphasis in this report has been given to 
those scientific questions that require large experimental 
and observing systems, and therefore require international 
coordination of efforts 
11.3.6 Time-scales for Narrowing the Uncertainty 
New concepts and scientific methods cannot matuic 
overnight and the lead time for significant progress in 
knowledge must be estimated in terms of yeais or even a 
decade, as for any major new technical development

A.l Introduction 
Modelling studies have been undertaken by a number of 
research groups to investigate the climate consequences of 
several man-made emission scenarios The first category of 
emission scenarios is that generated by IPCC Working 
Group III, which represents a broad range of possible 
controls to limit the emissions of greenhouse gases, these 
we refer to as policy scenarios. The second category of 
scenarios is generated by Working Group I to illustrate the 
way in which the atmosphere and climate would respond to 
changes in emissions, these we refer to as science 
scenarios. Many of the results have already been displayed 
in the appropriate sections of this report, they are brought 
together here to allow the complete emissions-climate 
pathway to be seen The exploration of the climate 
consequences of both categories of emissions scenarios 
involved the sequence of modelling studies illustrated in 
Figure A 1

Policy Scenarios 
Four policy scenarios have been developed by Working 
Group III, they are described in Appendix 1 of this report

Figure A.2(b): Emissions of methane (as an example) in the foui 
policy scenarios generated by IPCC Working Group III 
The first approximates to a Business-as-Usual (BaU) case 
The other three incorporate a progressive penetration ol 
controls on greenhouse gas emissions, and in this report arc 
labelled Scenario B, C and D (The BaU case had earliei 
been referred to as Scenario A) 
Each scenario includes emissions of the main 
greenhouse gases, and other gases (such as NOx and CO) 
which influence then concentrations The emissions of 
carbon dioxide and methane are shown in Figure A 2 as 
examples For further information on the background to 
and method of generation of, these policy scenarios, see 
Expert Group on Emissions Scenarios (1990) 
A.1.2 Science Scenarios 
The chain of processes in the atmosphere and other 
components of the climate system which lead from 
emissions to climate change (typified in this case by global 
temperature and sea level rise) can be illustrated by using a 
U2 
Annex 
small number of cases where emissions are changed in 
some hypothetical manner, often exaggerated lor clarity 
The following science scenarios were selected by Woiking 
Group I changes described apply equally to all the 
greenhouse gases 
51 
Constant emissions at 1990 levels of all gases from 
1990 onwards, 
52 
Reduce all emissions by 50% in 1990, and hold 
constant thereafter, 
53 
Deciease emissions at 2% per year compound from 
1990, 
54 
Inciease emissions at 2% per year compound until 
2010, then decrease at 2% per year compound 
In each case the 1990 emissions arc assumed to be those 
given in the Business-as-Usual policy scenario 
A.2 Pre-1990 Greenhouse Gas Concentrations 
Concentrations of the greenhouse gases prior to 1989 are 
taken as those observed directly in the atmosphere or in 
ice-cores as discussed in Section 1 The yeai 1765 was 
chosen as the pie-industrial baseline for greenhouse gas 
concentiations (and, hence, for man made forcing and 
global mean temperature) 
1990 concentrations were 
calculated by making a small extrapolation from most 
recent observations and trends 
A.3 Future Greenhouse Gas Concentrations 
A numbei ol models which contain representations of 
atmosphenc chemistry and the carbon cycle have been used 
to make piojections ol future atmosphenc concentrations of 
the gieenhouse gases Irom the man-made emissions 
sccnanos The lesults Irom each of the models aie not 
shown explicitly For each scenano and gas a single best-
estimate was made ol the concentration projection and 
these aie shown in Figuie A 3 for the policy scenarios and 
A 4 
A 5 loi the science scenarios In most cases these 
best estimates were simple means of a numbei ol model 
lesults 
A quantitative understanding ol the lclationship between 
trace gas emissions and tropospheric concentrations 
requues a description in three dimensions ol atmosphenc 
dynamics atmospheric chemistry and souices and sinks 
The problem is complex and demands the use of laige 
supeicomputcis Hence the lesults desuibcd in this Annex 
have been obtained with models which contain a numbei of 
simplil)ing assumptions The models give a iange ol luture 
concentiations depending on the assumptions adopted 
Tioposphciic models together with their iepiesentations ol 
atmospheric tianspoit and chemistry have not been subject 
to comparison and evaluation in the same manner as the 
stratospheric assessment models Consequently, there are 
no favouied appioaches or recommended models 
In many cases companson of different model results 
reveal many shortcomings in the emissions scenarios 
themselves Each emission scenano starts from 1985 and 
extends to 2100 Much is known about trace gas sources 
and sinks from these and other modelling studies of the 
1985 atmosphere The current emissions provided by 
Working Group III (WGIII) have not always been 
harmonised with pievious model studies of the life cycles 
of these trace gases Each set of model studies has therefore 
been adjusted in some way to accommodate the 1985 
situation where the emissions are in some way inadequate 
Emissions of some gases in particular man-made and 
natural hydrocarbons were not projected by WGIII, each 
modelling gioup has therefore made its own assumptions 
about these and this is an additional cause of differences 
between model lesults 
In the case of nitrous oxide its atmospheric burden and 
its rate of increase have been well established from 
observations and the models have been set up to reproduce 
these obseivations The lifetime calculated within each 
model detcimines the 1985 emissions required to support 
the current atmospheric burden and its rate of increase 
There is a nanow range of emissions which satisfies this 
balance and it is model dependent, the WGIII emissions do 
not in general fall within this range, and modelling groups 
have therefore adopted one of two approaches to correct for 
this 
The WGIII emissions taken together with current 
atmospheric concentration and its rate of increase, yield a 
lifetime of 167 years, somewhat longer than that generally 
accepted (see Section 1 5) Models with shorter lifetimes 
than 167 years will not reproduce current rate of increase of 
concentration, and some modellers have added further 
nitrous oxide emissions in ordei to accommodate this, this 
has led to a chveigence between model results 
The 1985 atmospheric concentration of methane is well 
known, and its rate of increase shows that souices and 
sinks are not cuncntly in balance Not all aspects of these 
methane souices have yet been adequately quantified, 
neither has the sink through its reaction with OH Whilst 
the accuracies in sources and sinks are adequate in budget 
studies to conlirm that tropospheric OH can indeed account 
for the observed methane behaviour, the lack of accuracy 
has led to pioblems in the concentration calculations 
desenbed here 
The atmospheric burden of methane and its rate of 
inciease have been well established from observations and 
the models have been set up to reproduce them The OH 
radical conccntiation distribution calculated within each 
model determines the 1985 emissions requited to support

the current atmospheric burden and its rate of increase 
There is a narrow, model dependent, range of methane, 
carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen emissions which 
satisfies this balance The 1985 emissions provided in the 
scenarios do not fall within the required range of all the 
models, and modellers have therefore adopted one of two 
approaches, causing the part of divergence in model results 
Some models have used the methane, carbon monoxide and 
NOx emission scenarios exactly as provided and scaled up 
all their results to make the 1985 methane concentrations 
agree with observations Other models have added extra 
methane, carbon monoxide or NOx to make the 1985 
methane concentrations agree with observations and 
maintained the extra injection throughout each calculation 
Differences in results can also arise because each model 
calculates a different scenario- and time-dependent 
tropospheric OH distribution One model includes a 
feedback between composition changes to temperature 
changes to relative humidity changes back to OH radical 
concentrations Almost all the models include the complex 
interaction between the future methane, carbon monoxide, 
ozone and nitrogen oxides concentrations on future OH 
radical concentrations 
CFCs 11 and 12 both have well quantified sources and 
stratospheric photolytic sinks The relatively small 
differences between model calculations is due to 
differences in model transport and assumed or calculated 
atmospheric lifetimes Such differences are similar to those 
reported in stratospheric ozone assessments (e g , WMO, 
1989) 
Although HCFC-22 sources are also all man-made its 
lifetime is determined not by stratospheric photolysis but 
by tropospheric OH oxidation However, the temperature 
dependence of the oxidation ieaction is so large that 
virtually all of the atmospheric removal occurs in low 
latitudes in the lower region of the troposphere and in the 
upper stratosphere The models used for this assessment 
generally have different 1985 tropospheric OH radical 
distributions and the different model loimulations lead to 
different future OH distributions depending on the 
methane, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide emissions 
In addition, one of the models employed includes an 
additional feedback whereby tutuie global warming leads 
to increased humidities and hence increased tropospheric 
OH radical concentrations Longer lifetimes imply greater 
tropospheric build-up of HCFC-22 by the year 2100 
Several modelling groups calculated future con-
centrations of tropospheric and stratospheric ozone, but 
because there was a wide divergence in the results, and 
because the relationship between concentration and forcing 
is not well established, the elfects of ozone have not yet 
been included in the climate response 
A.4 Past and Future Radiative Forcing 
The relationships between atmospheric concentration and 
radiative forcing derived in Section 2 were applied to the 
concentration histories of the greenhouse gases described

above, and to the estimates of future concentrations from 
the four policy scenarios. The combined historical and 
future radiative forcing is illustrated for the four policy 
scenarios in Figure A.6, and those from the science 
scenarios in Figures A.7 and A.8. 
A.5 Estimates of Future Global Mean Temperature 
Ideally, the complete climate effects of the emission 
scenarios would be investigated using a comprehensive 
coupled atmosphere-ocean General Circulation Model, the 
results from which (using simple concentration increases) 
have been discussed in Section 6.4. Such model runs are 
prohibitively expensive and time consuming. 
Instead, 
estimates of the change in global mean surface air 
temperature due to man-made forcing (both historical and 
projected) were made using a box-diffusion-upwelling 
model of the type discussed in Section 6.6. 
These models have a number of prescribed parameters 
(mixed-layer depth, upwelling rate, etc.) which are set to 
the optimum values discussed in Section 6. For each 
scenario, three values of climate sensitivity (the equil-
ibrium temperature rise due to a doubling of carbon dioxide 
concentrations) are employed, as described in Section 5; 
1.5°C, 2.5°C and 4.5°C. Results are given for each of these 
climate sensitivities, indicated as "high", "best estimate" 
and "low" in the figures. 
Temperature rise estimates for the four policy scenarios 
are shown in Figure A.9, and those from the science 
scenarios are given in Figure A. 10 and A. 11 (best-estimate 
values only).

A.6 Estimates of Future Global Mean Sea Level Rise 
Box diffusion models are also used to estimate the sea level 
rise from the forcing projections; the thermal expansion 
part of future sea level rise is calculated directly by these 
models. The models also contain expressions for the 
contributions to sea level change from glacier and land ice 
melting, and changes in the mass-balance of the Greenland 
and Antarctic ice sheets. 
Sea level changes estimated from the four policy 
scenarios are shown in Figure A. 12, and for the science 
scenarios in Figure A. 13 and A. 14. Again, "high", "best-
estimate" and "low" curves are shown for the policy 
scenarios, corresponding to the same climate sensitivities 
as used in the temperature rise estimates.

EMISSIONS SCENARIOS FROM THE RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP OF 
THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE 
The Steering Group of the Response Strategies Working 
Group (Working Group III) requested the USA and The 
Netherlands to develop emissions scenarios for evaluation 
by the IPCC Working Group I The scenarios cover the 
emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) methane (CH4), 
nitrous oxide (N2O), chlorolluorocarbons (CFCs), carbon 
monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) lrom present up 
to the year 2100 Growth of the economy and population 
was taken as common tor all scenarios Population was 
assumed to approach 10 5 billion in the second half of the 
next century Economic growth was assumed to be 2-3% 
annually in the coming decade in the OECD countries and 
3-5 % in the Eastern Euiopean and developing countries 
The economic growth levels were assumed to decrease 
thereafter In order to ieach the requued targets, levels ot 
technological development and cnvnonmcntal controls 
were varied 
In the Business-as-Usual Scenario (Scenario A) the 
energy supply is coal intensive and on the demand side 
only modest efficiency increases are achieved Carbon 
monoxide controls are modest, deforestation continues 
until the tropical forests are depleted and agricultural 
emissions of methane and nitrous oxide are uncontrolled 
For CFCs the Montreal Protocol is implemented albeit with 
only partial participation 
Note that the aggregation of 
national projections by IPCC Working Group III gives 
higher emissions (10-20%) of carbon dioxide and methane 
by 2025 
In Scenario B the energy supply mix shifts towards 
lower carbon fuels, notably natural gas Large eflicicncy 
increases are achieved Caibon monoxide contiols aie 
stringent, deforestation is ievcised and the Montreal 
Protocol implemented with full participation 
In Scenario C a shift towards renewables and nuclcai 
energy takes place in the second halt of next centuiy 
CFCs are now phased out and agncultuial emissions 
limited 
For Scenario D a shift to renewables and nuclcai in the 
first half of the next century ieduccs (he emissions of 
carbon dioxide initially more or less stabilizing emissions 
in the industrialized countries The scenario shows that 
stringent controls in industrialized countries combined with 
moderated growth of emissions in developing countries 
could stabilize atmospheric concentrations Carbon dioxide 
emissions are reduced to 50% of 1985 levels by the middle 
of the next century
