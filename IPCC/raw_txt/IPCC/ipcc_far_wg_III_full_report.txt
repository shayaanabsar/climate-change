INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL 
ON CLIMATE CHANGE 
Note to the Reader 
The report of the Response Strategies Working Group (RSWG) was compiled 
through an unprecedented international cooperative effort to deal with the many 
climate change response strategies. The chairs of the four RSWG subgroups and the 
coordinators of the five R S W G topic areas took the responsibility for completing 
their individual reports. Along with their respective governments, they contributed 
generously of their time and resources to that end. 
It was not possible or intended to review each subgroup report and topic paper in 
plenary session. The R S W G report thus constitutes a series of independently 
prepared underlying documents which attempt to analyze as thoroughly as possible 
the issues addressed in each subgroup or topic area. The synthesis of the concepts 
from these underlying reports is the R S W G Policymakers Summary, on which 
consensus was reached at the RSWG's Third Plenary Session in Geneva on June 9, 
1990.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was jointly established by us 
in 1988. Prof. B. Bolin is the Chairman of the Panel. The Panel's charge was to: 
a) assess the scientific information that is related to the various components of the 
climate change issue, such as emissions of major greenhouse gases and modification 
of the Earth's radiation balance resulting therefrom, and that is needed to enable 
the environmental and socio-economic consequences of climate change to be 
evaluated; and 
b) formulate realistic response strategies for the management of the climate change 
issue. 
The Panel began its task by establishing its Working Goups I, II, and III respec-
tively to: 
a) assess available scientific information on climate change; 
b) assess the environmental and socio-economic impacts of climate change; and 
c) formulate response strategies. 
The Panel also established a Special Committee on the Participation of Developing 
Countries to promote, as quickly as possible, the full participation of the developing 
countries in its activities. 
The Panel has completed its First Assessment Report (FAR). The F A R consists of 
• the Overview; 
• the policymakers summaries of the I P C C Working Groups and the Special Com-
mittee; 
• the reports of the I P C C Working Groups. 
The Overview and the policymakers summaries are to be found in a single volume. 
The reports of the Working Groups are being published individually. 
The present volume is based upon the findings of Working Group III. In order to 
appreciate the linkages among the various aspects of the climate change issue, it is 
recommended that it be read in the context of the full I P C C First Assessment Report. 
The Chairman of Working Group III, Dr. F. M . Bernthal, and his Secretariat have 
succeeded beyond measure in mobilizing the cooperation and enthusiasm of literally 
hundreds of experts from all over the world. They have produced a volume of remark-
able depth and breadth and a policymakers summary that is a model of writing aiming at 
explaining complex issues to the non-specialist. 
We take this opportunity to congratulate and thank Dr. Bernthal for a job well done.

Acknowledgments 
The work of the Response Strategies Working Group was organized and coordi-
nated by a network of officers from all over the world. I take this opportunity to 
thank the RSWG Vice-Chairs for their dedication in ensuring that Working Group 
III was able to fulfill the mission assigned to it. Special credit should go to the co-
chairs of the four R S W G subgroups and the coordinators of Task A (emissions 
scenarios) and Task B (implementation measures), who guided the efforts of the 
hundreds of experts in scores of countries around the world who contributed to the 
preparation of the specific sections of this report. 
In addition, I would like to express my gratitude to the staff of the Office of 
Global Change in the U.S. Department of State, (Daniel Reifsnyder, Frances L i , 
Stephanie Kinney, Robert Ford, and Granville Sewell), for their support as Secre-
tariat to the RSWG. Special thanks are due the staff of the U.S. National Science 
Foundation who, under the supervision of Dr. L i and Dr. Beverly Fleisher, 
oversaw the publication of this entire compendium. Finally, the Response Strate-
gies Working Group owes an enormous debt of gratitude to I P C C Chairman, Prof. 
Bert Bolin, for his guidance and counsel, and to the I P C C Secretariat, Dr. N . 
Sundararaman and his staff.

CHAIRMAN'S INTRODUCTION 
The First Plenary meeting of Working Group III of 
the IPCC, the Response Strategies Working Group 
(RSWG), was held in Washington, January 30-
February 2, 1989. This meeting was largely organi-
zational, and it was not until after a subsequent 
RSWG Officers Meeting in Geneva, May 8-12, 
1989, that the real work by the four R S W G sub-
groups, the Emissions Scenarios Task Force (Task 
A), and "Implementation Measures" Topic Coor-
dinators (Task B) began. 
The Second RSWG Plenary Session was held in 
Geneva, from October 2-6, 1989, to discuss the 
implementation measures: (1) public education and 
information; (2) technology 
development 
and 
transfer; (3) financial measures; (4) economic mea-
sures; and (5) legal measures, including elements of 
a framework climate convention. A consensus was 
reached on five topical papers dealing with these 
measures, with the understanding that they would 
be "living documents" subject to further modifica-
tion as new information and developments might 
require. 
The Third Plenary Meeting of RSWG, held in 
Geneva, June 5-9, 1990, achieved three objectives: 
1) It reached consensus on the attached "policy-
makers summary," the first interim report of 
the RSWG. 
2) It completed final editing and accepted the 
reports of the four R S W G subgroups, of the 
coordinators of Task A , and of the coordina-
tors of the five Task B topical papers. These 
documents comprise the underlying material 
for the consensus report of this meeting, the 
policymakers summary; they are not them-
selves the product of a RSWG plenary con-
sensus, although many governments partici-
pated in their formulation. 
Finally, 
3) The Working Group agreed to submit com-
ments on its suggested future work pro-
gramme to the RSWG Chairman by July 1, 
1990, for transmission to the Chair of the 
IPCC. There was general agreement that the 
work of the RSWG should continue. 
The primary task of the RSWG was, in the broad 
sense, technical, not political. The charge of IPCC 
to R S W G was to lay out as fully and fairly as possi-
ble a set of response policy options and the factual 
basis for those options. 
Consistent with that charge, it was not the pur-
pose of the RSWG to select or recommend political 
actions, much less to carry out a negotiation on the 
many difficult policy questions that attach to the 
climate change issue, although clearly the informa-
tion might tend to suggest one or another option. 
Selection of options for implementation is appro-
priately left to the policymakers of governments 
and/or negotiation of a convention. 
The work of RSWG continues. The Energy and 
Industry Subgroup has, since the June RSWG Plen-
ary Meeting, held additional meetings in London 
(June 1990) and Paris (September 1990), the results 
of which are not reflected in this report. 
It should be noted that quantitative estimates 
provided in the report regarding CFCs, including 
those in Scenario A ("Business as Usual"), generally 
do not reflect decisions made in June 1990 by the 
xxin 
XXIV 
POLICYMAKERS 
SUMMARY 
Parties to the Montreal Protocol. Those decisions 
accelerate the timetable to phase out production and 
consumption of CFCs, halons, carbon tetra-
chloride, and methyl chloroform. 
It should further be noted that quantitative esti-
mates of forestry activities (e.g., deforestation, bio-
mass burning, including fuel wood, and other 
changes in land-use practices), as well as agricultural 
and other activities provided in the Report continue 
to be reviewed by experts. 
Two specific items of unfinished business sub-
mitted to RSWG by the Ministers at the November 
1989 meeting in Noordwijk are the consideration of 
the feasibility of achieving: (1) targets to limit or 
reduce C 0 2 emissions, including, e.g., a 20 percent 
reduction of C 0 2 emission levels by the year 2005; 
(2) a world net forest growth of 12 million hectares a 
year in the beginning of the next century. 
The subgroup chairs and topic coordinators took 
the responsibility for completing their individual 
reports and, along with their respective govern-
ments, contributed generously of their time and 
resources to that end. 
The RSWG Policymakers Summary is the cul-
mination of the first year of effort by this body. The 
R S W G has gone to considerable lengths to ensure 
that the summary accurately reflects the work of the 
various subgroups and tasks. Given the very strict 
time schedule under which the RSWG was asked to 
work, this first report can be only a beginning.

Response Strategies Working Group 
Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Working Group III (Response Strategies Working 
Group) was tasked to formulate appropriate re-
sponse strategies to global climate change. This was 
to be done in the context of the work of Working 
Group I (Science) and Working Group II (Impacts), 
which concluded that: 
We are certain emissions resulting from human 
activities are substantially increasing the atmo-
spheric concentrations of the greenhouse gases: 
carbon dioxide, methane, chlorofluoro-carbons 
(CFCs), and nitrous oxide. These increases will 
enhance the greenhouse effect, resulting on aver-
age in an additional warming of the Earth's sur-
face. 
The longer emissions continue at present-day 
rates, the greater reductions would have to be for 
concentrations to stabilize at a given level. 
The long-lived gases would require immediate 
reductions in emissions from human activities of 
over 60 percent to stabilize their concentrations at 
today's levels. 
Based on current model results, we predict un-
der the IPCC "Business-as-Usual" emissions of 
greenhouse gases, a rate of increase of global 
mean temperature during the next century of 
about 0.3°C per decade (with an uncertainty 
range of 0.2°C to 0.5°C per decade), greater than 
that seen over the past 10,000 years; under the 
same scenario, we also predict an average rate of 
global mean sea level rise of about 6 cm per de-
cade over the next century (with an uncertainty 
range of 3-10 cm per decade). 
There are many uncertainties in our predic-
tions particularly with regard to the timing, mag-
nitude, and regional patterns of climate change. 
Ecosystems affect climate, and will be affected 
by a changing climate and by increasing carbon 
dioxide concentrations. Rapid changes in climate 
will change the composition of ecosystems; some 
species will benefit while others will be unable to 
migrate or adapt fast enough and may become 
extinct. Enhanced levels of carbon dioxide may 
increase productivity and efficiency of water use 
of vegetation. 
In many cases, the impacts will be felt most 
severely in regions already under stress, mainly 
the developing countries. 
The most vulnerable human settlements are 
those especially exposed to natural hazards, e.g., 
coastal or river flooding, severe drought, land-
slides, severe storms and tropical cyclones. 
Any responses will have to take into account the 
great diversity of different countries' situations and 
responsibilities and the negative impacts on differ-
ent countries, which consequently would require a 
wide variety of responses. Developing countries, 
for example, are at widely varying levels of develop-
ment and face a broad range of different problems. 
They account for 75 percent of the world popula-
tion and their primary resource bases differ widely. 
Nevertheless, they are most vulnerable to the ad-
verse consequences of climate change because of 
limited access to the necessary information, infra-
structure, and human and financial resources.

XXVI 
POLICYMAKERS SUMMARY 
M A I N 
F I N D I N G S 
1) Climate change is a global issue; effective re-
sponses would require a global effort that may 
have a considerable impact on humankind and 
individual societies. 
2) Industrialized countries and developing coun-
tries have a common responsibility in dealing 
with problems arising from climate change. 
3) Industrialized countries have specific respon-
siblities on two levels: 
(a) a major part of emissions affecting the 
atmosphere at present originates in indus-
trialized countries where the scope for 
change is greatest. Industrialized countries 
should adopt domestic measures to limit 
climate change by adapting their own 
economies in line with future agreements 
to limit emissions; 
(b) to cooperate with developing countries in 
international action, without standing in 
the way of the latter's development, by 
contributing 
additional 
financial 
re-
sources, by appropriate transfer of tech-
nology, by engaging in close cooperation 
concerning 
scientific observation, 
by 
analysis and research, and finally by 
means of technical cooperation geared to 
forestalling and managing environmental 
problems. 
4) Emissions from developing countries are 
growing and may need to grow in order to 
meet their development requirements and 
thus, over time, are likely to represent an in-
creasingly significant percentage of global 
emissions. Developing countries have the re-
sponsibility, within the limits feasible, to take 
measures to suitably adapt their economies. 
5) Sustainable development requires the proper 
concern for environmental protection as the 
necessary 
basis for continuing economic 
growth. Continuing economic development 
will increasingly have to take into account the 
issue of climate change. It is imperative that 
the right balance between economic and envi-
ronmental objectives be struck. 
6) Limitation and adaptation strategies must 
be considered as an integrated package and 
should complement each other to minimize 
net costs. Strategies that limit greenhouse gas 
emissions also make it easier to adapt to cli-
mate change. 
7) The potentially serious consequences of cli-
mate change on the global environment give 
sufficient reasons to begin by adopting re-
sponse strategies that can be justified imme-
diately even in the face of significant uncer-
tainties. 
8) A well-informed population is essential to 
promote awareness of the issues and provide 
guidance on positive practices. The social, 
economic, and cultural diversity of nations 
will require tailored approaches.

Greenhouse gas emissions from most sources are 
likely to increase significantly in the future if no 
response measures are taken. Although some con-
trols have been put in place under the Montreal 
Protocol for CFCs and halons, emissions of C 0 2 , 
C H 4 , N 2 0 , and other gases such as several C F C 
substitutes will grow. Under these scenarios, it is 
estimated that C 0 2 emissions will increase from 
approximately 7 billion* tonnes carbon (BTC) in 
1985 to between 11-15 B T C by 2025. Similarly, 
man-made methane emissions are estimated to in-
crease from about 300 teragrams (Tg) to over 500 Tg 
by the year 2025. Based on these projections, 
Working Group I estimated that global warming of 
0.3°C/decade could occur. 
The climate scenario studies of Working Group I 
further suggest that control policies on emissions 
can indeed slow global warming, perhaps from 
0.3°C/decade to 0.1°C/decade. The social, eco-
nomic, and environmental costs and benefits of 
these control policies have not been fully assessed. 
It must be emphasized that implementation of mea-
sures to reduce global emissions is very difficult, as 
* 1 billion = 1000 million 
Policymakers Summary 
xxvn 
energy use, forestry, and land use patterns are pri-
mary factors in the global economy. To take maxi-
mum advantage of our increasing understanding of 
scientific and socio-economic aspects of the issue, a 
flexible and progressive approach is required. Sub-
ject to their particular circumstances, individual na-
tions may wish to consider taking steps now to 
attempt to limit, stabilize, or reduce the emission of 
greenhouse gases resulting from human activities 
and prevent the destruction and improve the effec-
tiveness of sinks. One option that governments may 
wish to consider is the setting of targets for C O a and 
other greenhouse gases. 
Because a large, projected increase in world pop-
ulation will be a major factor in causing the pro-
jected increase in global greenhouse gases, it is 
essential that global climate change strategies in-
clude strategies and measures to deal with the rate of 
growth of the world population. 
SHORTER-TERM 
The Working Group has identified measures at the 
national, regional, and international levels as appli-
cable, which, while helping to tackle climate 
change, can yield other benefits. 
LIMITATION 
• Improved 
energy efficiency reduces emissions 
of carbon dioxide, the most significant green-
house gas, while improving overall economic 
performance 
and reducing other pollutant 
emissions and increasing energy security. 
• Use of cleaner energy sources and 
technologies 
reduces carbon dioxide emissions, while reduc-
ing other pollutant emissions that give rise to 
acid rain and other damaging effects. 
• Improved forest management 
and, where feas-
ible, expansion of forest areas as possible reser-
voirs of carbon. 
• Phasing out of CFCs under the Montreal 
Proto-
col, thus removing some of the most powerful 
and long-lived greenhouse gases, while also 
protecting the stratospheric ozone layer. 
• Agriculture, forestry, and other human activ-
ities are also responsible for substantial quan-
tities of greenhouse gas emissions. In the short 
term, reductions can be achieved through im-
proved livestock waste management, altered use 
and formulation 
of fertilizers, 
and other changes 
to agricultural 
land use, without affecting food 
security, as well as through improved manage-
ment in landfill and wastewater treatment. 
ADAPTATION 
• Developing emergency and disaster prepared-
ness policies and programmes. 
• Assessing areas at risk from sea level rise and 
developing comprehensive 
management 
plans 
to reduce future vulnerability of populations 
and coastal developments and ecosystems as 
part of coastal zone management plans. 
• Improving the efficiency of natural resource use, 
research on control measures for desertification 
and enhancing adaptability of crops to saline 
regimes. 
L O N G E R - T E R M 
Governments should prepare for more intensive ac-
tion, which is detailed in the report. To do so, they 
should undertake now: 
• Accelerated 
and 
coordinated 
research 
pro-
grammes 
to 
reduce 
scientific and 
socio-
economic uncertainties with a view toward im-
proving the basis for response strategies and 
measures. 
• Development of new technologies in the fields 
of energy, industry, and agriculture. 
• Review planning in the fields of energy, indus-
try, transportation, urban areas, coastal zones, 
and resource use and management. 
• Encourage beneficial behavioral and structural 
(e.g., transportation and housing infrastruc-
ture) changes. 
• Expand the global ocean observing and mon-
itoring systems. 
It should be noted that no detailed assessments 
have been made as of yet of the economic costs and 
benefits, technological feasibility, or market poten-
tial of the underlying policy assumptions. 
XXV111 
POLICYMAKERS SUMMARY 
INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION 
The measures noted above require a high degree of 
international cooperation, with due respect for na-
tional sovereignty of states. The international nego-
tiation on a framework convention should start as 
quickly as possible after the completion of the 
IPCC First Assessment Report. This, together with 
any additional protocols that might be agreed upon, 
would provide a firm basis for effective cooperation 
to act on greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to any 
adverse effects of climate change. The convention 
should, at a minimum, contain general principles 
and obligations. It should be framed in such a way 
as to gain the adherence of the largest possible num-
ber and most suitably balanced range of countries, 
while permitting timely action to be taken. 
Key issues for negotiation will include the crite-
ria, timing, legal form and incidence of any obliga-
tions to control the net emissions of greenhouse 
gases, how to address equitably the consequences 
for all, any institutional mechanisms that may be 
required, the need for research and monitoring, and 
in particular, the request of the developing coun-
tries for additional financial resources and for the 
transfer of technology on a preferential basis. 
FURTHER 
CONSIDERATION 
The issues, options, and strategies presented in this 
document are intended to assist policymakers and 
future negotiators in their respective tasks. Further 
consideration of the summary and the underlying 
reports of "Working Group III should be given by 
every government, as they cut across different sec-
tors in all countries. It should be noted that the 
scientific and technical information contained in the 
policymakers summary and the underlying reports 
of Working Group III do not necessarily represent 
the official views of all governments, particularly 
those that could not participate fully in all Working 
Groups.

A wide range of human activities result in the release 
of greenhouse gases, particularly C 0 2 , C H 4 , 
CFCs, and N a O , into the atmosphere. Anthro-
pogenic emissions can be categorized as arising 
from energy production and use, non-energy in-
dustrial activities (primarily the production and use 
of CFCs), agricultural systems, and changes in 
land-use patterns (including deforestation and bio-
mass burning). The relative contributions of these 
activities to radiative forcing during the 1980s are 
discussed in the text and shown in Figure 1 (see 
Working Group I report for further explanation of 
the radiative forcing of the various greenhouse 
gases; see also the Chairman's introduction regard-
ing the quantitative estimates of the contributions to 
radiative forcing from these activities). 
IPCC Working Group I calculated that the ob-
served increases in the atmospheric concentrations 
of C 0 2 , C H 4 , CFCs, and N 2 0 during the 1980s, 
which resulted from human activities, contributed 
to the enhanced radiative forcing by 56 percent, 15 
percent, 24 percent, and 5 percent, respectively. 
ENERGY 
The single largest anthropogenic source of radiative 
forcing is energy production and use. The con-
sumption of energy from fossil fuels (coal, petro-
leum, and natural gas, excluding fuelwood) for in-
dustrial, commercial, residential, transportation, 
and other purposes results in large emissions of 
C 0 2 accompanied by much smaller emissions of 
C H 4 from coal mining and the venting of natural

gas; the energy sector accounts for an estimated 46 
percent (with an uncertainty range of 38-54 per-
cent) of the enhanced radiative forcing resulting 
from human activities. 
Natural fluxes of C 0 2 into the atmosphere are 
large (200 Bt/yr*), but inputs from man-made 
sources are large enough to significantly disturb the 
atmospheric balance. 
INDUSTRY 
The production and use of CFCs and other halocar-
bons in various industrial processes comprise about 
24 percent of the enhanced radiative forcing. 
FORESTRY 
Deforestation, biomass burning including fuel-
wood, and other changes in land-use practices re-
lease C 0 2 , C H 4 , and N 2 0 into the atmosphere and 
together comprise about 18 percent (with an uncer-
tainty range of 9-26 percent) of the enhanced radia-
tive forcing. 
AGRICULTURE 
Methane releases from rice cultivation and from 
livestock systems, and nitrous oxide released during 
the use of nitrogenous fertilizers together comprise 
about 9 percent (with an uncertainty range of 4-13 
percent) of the enhanced radiative forcing. 
O T H E R SOURCES 
Carbon dioxide from cement manufacturing and 
methane from landfills together comprise about 3 
percent (with an uncertainty range of 1-4 percent) 
of the enhanced radiative forcing. 
Estimates of current greenhouse gas emissions are 
not precise because of uncertainties regarding both 
total emissions and emissions from individual 
sources. Global emissions from certain sources are 
particularly difficult to determine, e.g., C 0 2 emis-
sion from deforestation, C H
4 emission from rice 
cultivation, livestock systems, biomass burning, 
* Billion (or 1000 million) tons per year 
coal mining and venting of natural gas, and N 2 0 
emissions from all sources. The range of such esti-
mates can be quite large, typically, a factor of 1.5 for 
methane from livestock, a factor of 4 for C 0 2 from 
deforestation, and up to a factor of 7 for rice cultiva-
tion.

Greenhouse gas emissions from most sources are 
likely to increase significantly in the future if no 
policy measures are taken. As economic and popu-
lation growth continues, in particular in the devel-
oping countries, there is expected to be an increase 
in energy use, industrial and agricultural activity, 
deforestation, and other activities which result in a 
net increase of greenhouse gas emissions. Although 
some controls have been put in place under the 
Montreal Protocol for certain CFCs and halons, 
emissions of C 0 2 , methane, nitrous oxide, and 
other greenhouse gases are likely to increase under 
current patterns of economic activity and growth. 
However, because of the inherent limitations in 
our ability to estimate future rates of population and 
economic growth, etc., there is some uncertainty in 
the projections of greenhouse gas emissions, indi-
vidual behavior, technological innovation, and 
other factors that are crucial for determining emis-
sion rates over the course of the next century. This 
lends uncertainty to projections of greenhouse gas 
emissions over several decades or longer. Reflecting 
these inherent difficulties, the RSWG's work on 
emissions scenarios are the best estimates at this 
time covering emissions over the next century, but 
further work needs to be done. 
The R S W G used two methods to develop sce-
narios of future emissions as discussed in Sections 
2.1 and 2.2. One method used global models to 
develop four scenarios which were subsequently 
used by Working Group I to develop estimates of 
future warming. The second method used studies of 
the energy and agriculture sectors submitted by 
over 21 countries and international organizations to 
estimate emissions. These latter studies were aggre-
gated into a reference scenario. Both approaches 
show that emissions of C 0 2 and C H 4 will increase 
in the future. Both approaches indicate that C 0 2

emissions will grow from approximately 7 B T C to 
between 11 and 15 B T C by the year 2025. 
2.1 
EMISSIONS SCENARIOS 
One of the RSWG's first tasks was to prepare some 
initial scenarios of possible future greenhouse gas 
emissions for the use of the three I P C C Working 
Groups. An experts' group was formed that looked 
at four hypothetical future patterns of greenhouse 
gas emissions and their effect on the atmosphere. 
The cumulative effect of these emissions was calcu-
lated using the concept of equivalent C 0 2 concen-
trations (e.g., the contributions of all greenhouse 
gases to radiative forcing are converted into their 
equivalent in terms of C 0 2 concentrations). Global 
economic growth rates were taken from World 
Bank projections, and population estimates were 
taken from United Nations (UN) studies, and as-
sumed equal for all scenarios. 
The first of the scenarios, called the "Business as 
Usual" or the 2030 High Emissions Scenario, as-
sumes that few or no steps are taken to limit green-
house gas emissions. Energy use and clearing of 
tropical forests continue and fossil fuels, in particu-
lar coal, remain the world's primary energy source. 
The Montreal Protocol comes into effect, but with-
out strengthening, and with less than 100 percent 
compliance. Under this scenario, the equivalent of a 
doubling of pre-industrial C 0 2 levels occurs, ac-
cording to Working Group I, by around 2025. 
The predicted anthropogenic contributions to 
greenhouse gas emissions in 2025 are shown in Ta-
ble 1. The RSWG attempted to synthesize and com-
pare the results 
of the AFOS/EIS 
Reference 
Scenario and the Task A "Business as Usual" (or 
"2030 High Emissions") Scenario (see Figure 2). 
The figure shows the equivalent C 0 2 concentra-
tions for the Task A "Business as Usual" Scenario 
and the AFOS/EIS Reference Scenario with its 
higher C 0 2 emissions and the C F C phase-out 
agreed to by the Parties to the Montreal Protocol. 
The results indicate that the C 0 2 equivalent con-
centrations and thus the effect on the global climate 
are similar for both scenarios. 
The second of the scenarios, the 2060 Low Emis-
sions Scenario, assumes that a number of environ-
mental and economic concerns result in steps to 
reduce the growth of greenhouse gas emissions. 
Energy efficiency measures, which might only be 
possible with government intervention, are imple-
mented, emissions controls are adopted globally, 
and the share of the world's primary energy pro-
vided by natural gas increases. Full compliance with 
the Montreal Protocol is achieved and tropical de-
forestation is halted and reversed. Under this sce-
nario, the cumulative effect of such measures is a 
C 0 2 equivalent doubling around 2060. 
The remaining two scenarios reflect 
futures 
where steps in addition to those in the 2060 Low 
Emissions Scenario are taken to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions. These steps include rapid utilization 
of renewable energy sources, strengthening of the 
Montreal Protocol, and adoption of agricultural 
policies to reduce emissions from livestock systems, 
rice paddies, and fertilizers. 
All of the above scenarios provide a conceptual 
basis for considering possible future patterns of 
emissions and the broad responses that might affect 
those patterns. However, they represent assump-
tions rather than cases derived from specific studies. 
In addition, no full assessment was made as yet of 
the total economic costs and benefits, technological 
feasibility, or market potential of the underlying 
policy assumptions.

REFERENCE SCENARIO 
Table 2 shows the results of the EIS Reference Sce-
nario (for C 0 2 emissions from the energy sector 
only) divided by region. The table is incomplete and 
does not include C 0 2 emissions from non-energy 
sources or other greenhouse gases and sinks. While 
it is not directly a measure of a region's climate 
forcing contribution, this table does portray a fu-
ture where, in the absence of specific policy mea-
sures, global emissions of one major gas, C 0 2 , 
grow from 5.15 B T C in 1985, to 7.30 B T C in 2000 
and 12.43 B T C in 2025. Primary energy demand 
more than doubles between 1985 and 2025, an aver-
age annual growth rate of 2.1 percent.

a PC-Per capita carbon emissions in tonnes carbon per person. 
b Cl-Carbon intensity in kilograms carbon per gigajoule. 
varies from 0.7 percent in Western Europe, 1.3 
percent in North America and the Pacific O E C D 
Countries, to 3.6 percent in developing countries. 
The share of emissions between regions varies over 
time. 
Under this scenario, the per capita emissions in 
the industrialized countries increase from 3.1 
tonnes carbon (TC) per capita in 1985 to 4.7 T C per 
capita in 2025. For the developing countries, the per 
capita emissions rise from 0.4 T C per capita in 1985 
to 0.8 T C per capita in 2025. 
The Reference Scenario sets out an example of the 
scope of the reductions in total global emissions that 
might be necessary to stabilize or reduce C O a emis-
sions. The stabilization of global emissions at 1985 
levels would require reductions of 29 percent by 
XXXIV 
POLICYMAKERS SUMMARY 
2000 and 50 percent by 2025. A reduction of global 
emissions to 20 percent below 1985 levels would 
require reductions of 44 percent in 2000 and 67 
percent by 2025. 
The carbon intensity figures show, for each re-
gion, the amount of carbon emitted per unit of 
energy consumed. The contribution of energy con-
sumption in a region to global warming is largely 
a function of its carbon intensity, total fuel use, 
and of the efficiency with which it consumes fossil 
fuels. Carbon intensity for industrialized countries 
changes from 16.3 tonnes carbon per gigajoule (TC-
GJ) in 1985 to 15.5 in 2025. In the developing world 
the change is from 14.2 TC-GJ to 15.6.

Because climate change could potentially result in 
significant impacts on the global environment and 
human activities, it is important to begin consider-
ing now what measures might be taken in response. 
Working Group I found that under a "Business as 
Usual" Scenario global average temperature could 
rise by 0.3 degrees centigrade per decade; it also 
found that under the Accelerated Control Policies 
Scenario (Scenario D) with extremely stringent 
emissions reductions the temperature rise could 
perhaps be reduced to 0.1 degree centigrade per 
decade. The RSWG identified a wide range of op-
tions for the international community to consider. 
These include measures both to limit net green-
house gas emissions and to increase the ability of 
society and managed ecosystems to adapt to a 
changing climate. 
Strategies that focus only on one group of emis-
sions sources, one type of abatement option, or one 
particular greenhouse gas will not achieve this. Pol-
icy responses, should, therefore, 
be 
balanced 
against alternative abatement options among the en-
ergy, industry, forestry, and agricultural sectors, 
and adaptation options and other policy goals 
where applicable at both national and international 
levels. Ways should be sought to account for other 
countries, and for intergenerational issues, when 
making policy decisions. 
The consideration of climate change response 
strategies, however, presents formidable difficulties 
for policymakes. O n the one hand, the information 
available to make sound policy analyses is inade-
quate because of: (a) remaining scientific uncertain-
ties regarding the magnitude, timing, rate, and 
regional consequences of potential climate change; 
(b) uncertainty with respect to how effective spe-
cific response options or groups of options would 
be in actually averting potential climate change; and 
(c) uncertainty with respect to the costs, effects on 
economic growth, and other economic and social 
implications of specific response options or groups 
of options. The potentially serious consequences of 
climate change on the global environment, how-
ever, give sufficient reasons to begin by adopting 
response strategies that can be justified immediately 
even in the face of such significant uncertainties. 
Recognizing these factors, a large number of op-
tions were preliminarily assessed. It appears that 
some of these options may be economically and 
socially feasible for implementation in the near term 
while others, because they are not yet technically or 
economically viable, may be more appropriate for 
implementation in the longer term. In general, 
the R S W G found that the most effective response 
strategies, especially in the short term, are those 
which are: 
• beneficial for reasons other than climate change 
and justifiable in their own right—for example, 
increased energy efficiency and lower green-
house gas emission technologies, better man-
agement of forests and other natural resources, 
and reductions in emissions of CFCs and other 
ozone-depleting substances that are also radi-
atively important gases; 
• economically efficient and cost effective, in par-
ticular those that use market-based 
mecha-
nisms; 
• able to serve multiple social, economic, and 
environmental purposes; 
• flexible and phased, so that they can be easily 
modified to respond to increased understanding 
of scientific, technological, and economic as-
pects of climate change; 
• compatible with economic growth and the con-
cept of sustainable development; 
• administratively practical and effective in terms 
of application, monitoring, and enforcement; 
and 
Policymakers Summary 
xxxv 
• reflecting obligations of both industrialized and 
developing countries in addressing this issue, 
while recognizing the special needs of develop-
ing countries, in particular in the areas of fi-
nancing and technology. 
The degree to which options are viable will also vary 
considerably depending on the region or country 
involved. For each country, the implications of spe-
cific options will depend on its social, environmen-
tal, and economic context. Only through careful 
analysis of all available options will it be possible to 
determine which are best suited to the circum-
stances of a particular country or region. Initially, 
the highest priority should be to review existing 
policies with a view to minimizing conflicts with the 
goals of climate change strategies. New policies will 
be required.

The RSWG reviewed potential measures for mit-
igating climate change by limiting net emissions of 
greenhouse gases from the energy, industry, trans-
portation, housing and building, forestry, agricul-
ture, and other sectors. These measure include 
those that limit emissions from greenhouse gas 
sources (such as energy production and use), those 
that increase the use of natural sinks (such as imma-
ture forests and other biomass) for sequestering 
greenhouse gases, as well as those measures aimed at 
protecting reservoirs such as existing forests. While 
the RSWG was not mandated to consider the role of 
the oceans, Working Group I noted that oceans also 
play an equally important role as sinks and reser-
voirs for carbon dioxide. A discussion of both 
short- and long-term options for each major emis-
sions sector is provided below. 
It also should be recognized that the large pro-
jected increase in the world population, to as much 
as ten billion people during the next century, will be 
a major factor in causing the projected increase in 
global greenhouse gases. This is because larger pop-
ulations will be accompanied by increased con-
sumption of energy and of food, more land clearing, 
and other activities, all of which will cause an in-
crease in net greenhouse gas emission. It is essential, 
therefore, that policies designed to deal effectively 
with the issue of potential global climate change 
include strategies and measures to reduce the rate of 
growth of the world population. 
4.1 
LIMITATION OF N E T EMISSIONS FROM 
THE E N E R G Y SECTOR 
The energy sector plays a vitally important role in 
economic well-being and development for all na-
tions. At the same time, because energy production 
and use account for approximately one half of the 
radiative forcing from human activities, energy pol-
icies need to ensure that continued economic 
growth occurs in a manner that, globally, conserves 
the environment for future generations. However, 
there is no single, quick-fix technological option for 
limiting greenhouse gas emissions from energy 
sources. A comprehensive strategy is necessary that 
deals with improving efficiency on both the demand 
and supply sides as a priority and emphasizes tech-
nological research, development, and deployment. 
The R S W G recognizes the particular difficulties 
that will be faced by countries, particularly devel-
oping countries whose economy is heavily depen-
dent on the production and/or export of fossil fuels, 
as a consequence of actions taken by other countries 
to limit or reduce energy-related greenhouse gas 
emissions. These difficulties should be taken into 
account when elaborating international strategies. 
Various potential options have been identified for 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions from energy 
systems. The most relevant categories of options 
appear to be: 
• efficiency improvements and conservation in 
energy supply, conversion, and end use; 
• fuel substitution by energy sources that have 
lower or no greenhouse gas emissions; 
• reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by re-
moval, recirculation, or fixation; and 
• management and behavioral changes (e.g., in-
creased work in homes through information 
technology) and structural changes (e.g., modal 
shift in transport). 
From an analysis of the technologies in these cate-
gories, it appears that some technologies 
are

Tables 3 and 4 provide various examples of tech-
nological options within each of the broad catego-
ries defined above, and their possible application in 
the short, medium, and longer term. This distinc-
tion among time frames is used in order to reflect 
the remaining technological needs in each category 
and to assist in formulating technological strategies. 
Short-term technologies are those that apparently 
are or will be both technically and economically 
ready for introduction and/or demonstration by the 
year 2005. Mid-term technologies are those that 
while technically available now, are not yet eco-
nomic and thus may not be implemented until the 
period from 2005 to 2030. Longer-term technolo-
gies are not yet available but may emerge after 2030 
as a result of research and development. Such time 
frames could be influenced by such factors as the 
pace of the technological changes and economic 
conditions. 
The technical, economic, and market potential of 
technological options will vary depending upon the 
sector in which they are to be applied. The technical 
potential of an energy technology is its capacity to 
reduce potential emissions, irrespective of the costs 
involved, and is largely a function of technical fea-
sibility and resource availability. Economic poten-
tial refers to whether the application of the options 
is economically efficient and cost-effective—it may 
be significantly less than technical potential where 
there are positive resource costs. Market potential 
refers to whether the consumer or user is likely to 
adopt the option—it might be even less than eco-
nomic potential due to market imperfections, atti-
tudes to risk, and the presence of non-monetary 
costs. 
There is, in general, extensive information avail-
able on the technical potential of the many techno-
logical options listed. For example:

potential (e.g., 50 percent improvement from 
the average vehicle on the road in some coun-
tries); 
• in the Electricity Generation sector, efficiency 
improvements of 15 to 20 percent could be 
achieved for retrofits of coal plants and up to 65 
percent of new generation versus average exist-
ing coal plants; fuel substitution could achieve 
30 percent (for oil to natural gas) to 40 percent 
(for coal to natural gas) reduction in emissions 
of C 0 2 ; 
• in the Building sector, new homes could be 
roughly twice as energy efficient and new com-
mercial buildings up to 75 percent more energy 
efficient than existing buildings; retrofitting 
existing homes could average 25 percent im-
provement and existing commercial buildings 
around 50 percent. 
• in the Industry sector, the technical potential 
for 
efficiency improvements ranges 
from 
around 15 percent in some sub-sectors to over 
40 percent in others (i.e., the best available 
technology versus the stock average). 
The constraints to achieving the technical potential 
in these sectors can be generally categorized as: 
• capital costs of more efficient technologies vis-
a-vis the cost of energy; 
• relative prices of fuels (for fuel substitution); 
• lack of infrastructure; 
• remaining performance drawbacks of alterna-
tive technologies; 
• replacement rates; 
• reaching the large number of individual deci-
sion makers involved. 
Each of these constraints may be more or less signif-
icant depending on the sector in question. While not 
a constraint, behavioral changes (e.g., improved 
driver behavior, better vehicle maintenance, and 
turning off unused lights) can make significant con-
tributions to emissions reduction in all sectors. 
Achieving such changes requires the engagement of 
both the energy supplier and the consumer. Like-
wise, improvements in operational practices on the 
part of industry and government (e.g., better traffic 
management or boiler operation) offer significant 
potential but require increased attention. Transport 
and housing policies (e.g., promotion of public 
transport, home insulation) could also reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions. A more comprehensive 
assessment of the measures to overcome these con-
straints is contained in section 7 of this policy-
makers summary. 
Factors external to the energy sector also signifi-
cantly constrain potential. These include the diffi-
culty of: 
• making basic changes in the structure of econ-
omies (e.g., development of new transportation 
and housing infrastructure); 
• making fundamental changes in attitudinal and 
social factors (e.g., preferences for smaller and 
higher-efficiency vehicles). 
The challenge to policymakers is to enhance the 
market uptake of technological options and behav-
ioral and operational changes as well as to address 
the broader issues outside the energy sector in order 
to capture more of the potential that exists. 
Options 
and 
Strategies 
Tables 3 and 4 summarize the technological, regula-
tory, and institutional approaches that could form 
elements of strategies to control greenhouse gases. 
A list of options recommended by EIS as mea-
sures for addressing greenhouse gas emissions is 
given below. Countries are encouraged to evaluate 
the social, economic, and environmental conse-
quences of these options: 
• taking steps now'' to attempt to limit, stabilize, 
or reduce the emission of energy-related green-
house gases and prevent the destruction and 
improve the effectiveness of sinks (one option 
that governments may wish to consider is the 
setting of targets for C 0 2 and other greenhouse 
gases); 
• adopting a flexible progressive approach, based 
on the best available scientific, economic, and 
technological knowledge, to action needed to 
respond to climate change; 
• drawing up specific policies and implementing 
wide-ranging comprehensive programmes that 
cover all energy-related greenhouse gases; 
There was significant concern expressed at the RSWG meeting 
about the immediacy implied by the word "now" in option one, when 
implementation could only be considered at a rate consistent with 
countries' level of knowledge and particular circumstances.

POLICYMAKERS SUMMARY 
• starting with implementing strategies that have 
multiple social, economic, and environmental 
benefits, are cost effective, are compatible with 
sustainable development, and make use of mar-
ket forces in the best way possible; 
• intensifying international, multilateral, and bi-
lateral cooperation in developing new energy 
strategies to cope with climate change. In this 
context, industrialized countries are encour-
aged to promote the development and transfer 
of energy-efficient and clean technologies to 
other countries; 
• increasing public awareness of the need for ex-
ternal environmental costs to be reflected in 
energy prices, markets, and policy decisions to 
the extent that they can be determined; 
• increasing public awareness of energy-efficient 
technologies and products and alternatives, 
through public education and information 
(e.g., labeling); 
• strengthening research and development and 
international collaboration in energy technolo-
gies, and economic and energy policy analysis, 
which are relevant for climate change; 
• encouraging the participation of industry, the 
general public, and N G O s in the development 
and implementation of strategies to limit green-
house gas emissions. 
Short-Term Strategy Options 
Short-term strategies for all individual nations in-
clude: 
• improving diffusion of energy-efficient and al-
ternative energy technologies that are techni-
cally and commercially proven; 
• improving energy efficiency of mass-produced 
goods, including motor vehicles and electrical 
appliances, and equipment and buildings (e.g., 
through improved standards); 
• developing, diffusing, and transferring technol-
ogies to limit energy-related greenhouse gas 
emissions; 
• reviewing energy-related price and tariff sys-
tems and policy decisions on energy planning to 
better reflect environmental costs. 
Long-Term Strategy Options 
Over the longer term, sustainable development will 
remain a central theme of policies and strategies. 
Specific approaches within a sustainable develop-
ment policy framework will evolve as our under-
standing of climate change and its implications 
improves. 
Long-term strategies for all individual nations in-
clude : 
• accelerating work to improve the long-term po-
tential of efficiency in the production and use of 
energy; encouraging a relatively greater reliance 
on no or lower greenhouse gas emissions en-
ergy sources and technologies; and enhancing 
natural and man-made means to sequester 
greenhouse gases; 
• further reviewing, developing, and deploying 
policy instruments, which may include public 
information, standards, taxes and incentives, 
tradeable permits, and environmental impact 
assessments, which will induce sustainable en-
ergy choices by producers and consumers with-
out jeopardizing energy security and economic 
growth; 
• developing methodologies 
to evaluate the 
trade-off between limitation and adaptation 
strategies and establishing changes in infra-
structure (e.g., pipelines, electrical grids, dams) 
needed to limit or adapt to climate change.

LIMITATION OF N E T EMISSIONS FROM 
THE INDUSTRY SECTOR 
The most significant source of greenhouse gases 
associated with industrial activity not related to en-
ergy use is the production and use of CFCs and 
other halocarbons. CFCs represent a very impor-
tant source of greenhouse gas emissions and account 
for about 24 percent of the total contributions to the 
enhanced radiative forcing for the period of the 
1980s. While the RSWG did not consider control 
strategies for these gases, since the issue is already 
addressed under the Montreal Protocol on Sub-
stances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, it noted that 
the review of the Montreal Protocol now under way 
should take into account the global warming poten-
tial of potential C F C substitutes. 
The R S W G did develop future emission scenarios 
Policymakers Summary 
xli 
for CFCs and HCFC-22 (HCFC-22 was used as a 
surrogate for a potential mix of H C F C s and H F C s 
substitutes). The potential impact of such substi-
tutes on radiative forcing was assessed by Working 
Group I. For a given emission rate, H C F C s and 
HFCs are less effective greenhouse gases than the 
CFCs because of their shorter lifetimes. The growth 
rates assumed in the IPCC scenarios will result in 
the atmospheric concentrations of H F C s 
and 
H C F C s becoming comparable to the CFCs during 
the next several decades, assuming that the CFCs 
had continued to be used at current rates. Assuming 
the IPCC scenarios for H F C s and H C F C s , Work-
ing Group I calculated that these gases would con-
tribute up to 10 percent of the total additional 
radiative forcing for the period 2000-50. 
4.3 
LIMITATION OF N E T EMISSIONS FROM 
T H E AGRICULTURE SECTOR 
About 9 percent of anthropogenic greenhouse gas 
emissions can be attributed to the agricultural 
sector—in particular, livestock systems, rice culti-
vation, and the use of nitrogenous fertilizers. Lim-
itation of emissions from this sector presents a 
challenge because the processes by which green-
house gases—in particular, methane and nitrous 
oxide—are released in agricultural activities are not 
well understood. In addition, response options in 
the agricultural sector must be designed to ensure 
maintenance of food supply. There appear, how-
ever, to be a number of short-term response op-
tions, some economically beneficial in their own 
right, that could contribute to a limitation of net 
emissions from agricultural sources. Where appro-
priate, the removal of subsidies, incentives, and reg-
ulatory barriers that encourage greenhouse 
gas 
emissions from the agricultural sector would be 
both environmentally and economically beneficial. 
In addition, there are a number of promising tech-
nologies and practices that, in the longer term, 
could significantly reduce greenhouse gas emis-
sions. 
Short-Term Options 
Livestock systems: Methane emissions could be re-
duced through improved management of livestock 
wastes, expansion of supplemental feeding prac-
tices, and increased use of production- and growth-
enhancing agents, with safeguards for human 
health. 
Fertilizer 
use: Nitrous oxide emissions may be re-
duced by using existing improved fertilizer formu-
lations, judicious use of animal manures and 
compost, and improved application technology and 
practices. 
Marginal 
lands: Areas marginally suitable for an-
nual cropping systems may be shifted to perennial 
cover crops for fodder, pastoral land use, or forests 
if soils are suitable. Such actions would increase 
carbon uptake, both in the vegetation and soil, and 
would yield other benefits. 
Sustainable 
agricultural 
practices: Where possible, 
minimum or no-till systems should be introduced 
for those countries currently using tillage as part of 
the annual cropping sequence, thus maintaining and 
increasing soil organic matter. 
Longer-Term Options 
Rice cultivation: 
A comprehensive approach, in-
cluding management of water regimes, improve-
ment of cultivars, efficient use of fertilizers, and 
other management practices, could lead to a 10 to 30 
percent reduction in methane emissions from 
flooded rice cultivation, although substantial re-
search is necessary to develop and demonstrate these 
practices. It is estimated that at least twenty years 
would be needed to introduce such practices. Adapt-
able alternative crops research is needed to provide a 
more diverse crop base for rice-growing regions. 
Livestock: Through a number of technologies it ap-
pears that methane emissions may be reduced from 
livestock systems by up to 25-75 percent per unit of 
product in dairy and meat production, although 
many uncertainties exist. 
Fertilizers: 
Fertilizer-derived emissions of nitrous 
oxide potentially can be reduced (although to what 
extent is uncertain) through changes in practices, 
such as using fertilizers with controlled nitrogen 
conversion rates, improving fertilizer-use effi-
ciency, and adopting alternative agricultural sys-
tems where possible.

LIMITATION OF N E T EMISSIONS FROM 
FORESTRY A N D O T H E R ACTIVITIES 
Forestry and related aspects of land use cannot be 
considered in isolation, and solutions must be based 
on an integrated approach that links forestry to 
other policies, such as those concerned with pov-
erty and land resources, which should be supported 
by strong institutions in order to enhance overall 
forest management. The forest crisis is rooted in the 
agricultural sector and in people's needs for em-
ployment and income. Deforestation 
will 
be 
stopped only when the natural forest is economi-
cally more valuable for the people who live in and 
around the forests than alternative uses for the same 
land. 
Forestry practices and other human activities as-
sociated with land use, such as biomass burning and 
landfills, account for about 18 percent of anthro-
pogenic greenhouse gas emissions. A number of 
short- and long-term response options for limiting 
net emissions from these sectors have been identi-
fied. 
Short-Term Options 
1) Improvement of forest-management and re-
duction of deforestation and forest degrada-
tion, which should be supported by: 
• reduction of air pollution, which contrib-
utes to forest degradation; 
• elimination of inappropriate economic in-
centives and subsidies that contribute to for-
est loss, where appropriate; 
• integration of forest conservation require-
ments and sustainable development in all 
relevant sectors of national development 
planning and policy, taking account of the 
interests of local communities; 
• coordinated remote sensing, data collection, 
and analyses to provide the required data; 
• a meeting of interested countries from the 
developing and the industrialized worlds 
and of appropriate international agencies to 
identify possible key elements of a world 
forest conservation protocol in the context 
of a climate convention process that also ad-
dresses energy supply and use, and practical 
means of implementing it. Such a meeting 
should also develop a framework and meth-
odology for analyzing the feasibility of the 
Noordwijk remit, including alternative tar-
gets, as well as the full range of costs and 
benefits; 
• strengthening Tropical Forestry Action Plan 
(TFAP) and, in the light of the indepen-
dent review that is being undertaken, the In-
ternational Tropical Timber Organization 
(ITTO), and other international organiza-
tions whose objective is to help developing 
countries in achieving conservation and sus-
tainable development and management of 
forests; 
• an assessment of incentives and disincentives 
for sustainable forest management—for ex-
ample, the feasibility of labeling; 
• introduction of sustainable forest harvesting 
and management; 
• development 
of 
enhanced 
regeneration 
methods; 
• development and implementation of (large-
scale) national afforestation and forest con-
servation plans, where feasible. 
2) Where appropriate, expand forest areas, espe-
cially by afforestation, agroforestry, and re-
greening of available surplus agricultural, 
urban, and marginal lands. 
3) Where appropriate, strengthen and improve 
the use of forest products and wood through 
measures such as substituting a portion of fos-
sil energy sources by wood or other sustain-
able managed biomass; partial replacement of 
high energy input materials by wood; further 
recycling of forest products; and improved 
efficiency of use of fuelwood. 
4) Development of methane recovery systems 
for landfill and wastewater treatment facilities 
and their use, in particular, in industrialized 
countries. 
Longer-Term Options 
1) Maintain the health and the continuance of 
existing forests as major natural carbon reser-

voirs, especially through the development and 
implementation of: 
• silvicultural adjustment and stress manage-
ment strategies; 
• special forest protection strategies (devel-
oped under climate change scenarios); 
• environmentally sound treatment practices 
for peatlands; 
• standardization of methods of forest inven-
tory and bio-monitoring to facilitate global 
forest management. 
2) Expand forest biomass, especially of inten-
sively managed temperate forests, by silvicul-
ture measures and genetically improved trees. 
3) With regard to waste management, use of gas 
collection and flaring to reduce methane emis-
sions from landfills and development of biogas 
plants to reduce methane emissions from 
wastewater treatment. Demonstration, train-
ing, and technology transfer are necessary to 
realize these potentials, which may range from 
30 to 90 percent for landfills and up to 100 
percent for wastewater treatment.

There has been considerable international discus-
sion of targets for specific greenhouse gas emis-
sions, in particular, C 0 2 , which is the most 
abundant of the greenhouse gases. The final declara-
tion at the November 1989 Noordwijk Conference 
on Atmospheric Pollution and Climate Change en-
couraged the IPCC to include in its First Assess-
ment Report an analysis of quantitative targets to 
limit or reduce C 0 2 emissions, and urged all indus-
trialized countries to investigate the feasibility of 
achieving such targets, including, for example, a 20 
percent reduction of C 0
2 emissions by the year 
2005. The Conference also called for assessing the 
feasibility of increasing net global forest growth by 
12 million hectares per year. During its Third Plen-
ary, the IPCC accepted the mandate. 
Although the feasibility of quantitative targets on 
greenhouse gas emissions fell within the RSWG's 
original mandate through its Energy and Industry 
Subgroup (EIS), it was agreed that these new, spe-
cific tasks would require more time, data, and an-
alyses in order to be dealt with properly. It was 
decided, therefore, that the results of the delibera-
tion of the EIS on these remits could not be fully 
included in its report but only treated in an incom-
plete and preliminary way. A progress report is to 
be presented to the fourth IPCC Plenary following 
an international workshop to be hosted by the 
United Kingdom in June 1990. As for the Noord-
wijk remit on global forest growth, the RSWG 
through its Agriculture, Forestry, and Other H u -
man 
Activities Subgroup (AFOS) noted that a 
framework and methodology for analyzing its fea-
sibility should be developed. 
While the technical potential of a number of op-
tions has been demonstrated, there is very little 
information available on the actual economic and 
social feasibility associated with implementation of 
such options. A n adequate understanding of the 
benefits, in terms of changes in climate variables 
that are avoided, is also seriously lacking. It is im-
perative that further work on the cost and benefit 
implications of response strategies be undertaken. 
These issues have been identified as one of the most 
important areas for future research by the RSWG, 
concerned international organizations, and individ-
ual countries. 
The material available to the EIS demonstrates 
the important role emissions of industrialized coun-
tries play in total global emissions in the near term. 
The material also indicates that the technical poten-
tial for reduction is large, and differs greatly be-
tween regions and countries. Therefore, in the near 
term, no significant progress in limiting global 
emissions will occur without actions by the indus-
trialized countries. Some countries have already de-
cided to stabilize or reduce their emissions.

G L O B A L C L I M A T E C H A N G E 
In addition to the limitation options discussed 
above, the RSWG reviewed measures for adapting 
to potential climate change. The consideration of 
adaptation options is critical for a number of rea-
sons. First, because it is believed that there is likely 
xliv 
POLICYMAKERS SUMMARY 
to be a lag time between emissions and subsequent 
climate change, the climate may already be commit-
ted to a certain degree of change. Implementation of 
adaptation measures may thus be necessary regard-
less of any limitation actions that may be taken. 
Second, natural climate variability itself necessitates 
adaptation. 
Furthermore, should significant adverse climate 
change occur, it would be necessary to consider 
limitation and adaptation strategies as part of an 
integrated package in which policies adopted in the 
two areas complement each other so as to minimize 
costs. Limitation and adaptation options should be 
developed and analyzed recognizing the relation-
ship between the timing and costs of limitation and 
adaptation. For example, the more net emissions are 
reduced and the rate of climate change potentially 
slowed, the easier it would be to adapt. A truly 
comprehensive approach should recognize that 
controlling the different gases might have different 
effects on the adaptive capacity of natural resources. 
The RWSG explored two broad categories of 
adaptation options: 
• Coastal zone management, 
or options that 
maximize the ability of coastal regions to adapt 
to the projected sea level rise and to reduce 
vulnerability to storms; and 
• Resource use and management, 
or options that 
address the potential impacts of global climate 
change on food security, water availability, nat-
ural and managed ecosystems, land, and bio-
diversity. 
6.1 
COASTAL Z O N E M A N A G E M E N T 
Under the 2030 High Emissions Scenario, global 
climate change is predicted to raise global mean sea 
level 65 cm (with an uncertainty range of 30 to 110 
cm) by the year 2100. If sea level rises by 1 meter, 
hundreds of thousands of square kilometers of 
coastal wetlands and other lowlands could be inun-
dated, while ocean beaches could erode as much as a 
few hundred meters over the next century. Flood-
ing would threaten lives, agriculture, livestock, and 
structures, while salt water would advance inland 
into aquifers, estuaries, and soils, thus threatening 
water supplies and agriculture in some areas. Loss 
of coastal ecosystems would threaten fishery re-
sources. 
Some nations would be particularly vulnerable to 
such changes. Eight to ten million people live within 
one meter of high tide in each of the unprotected 
river deltas of Bangladesh, Egypt, and Vietnam. 
Half a million people live in coral atoll nations that 
lie almost entirely within three meters of sea level, 
such as the Maldives, the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu, 
Kiribati, and Tokelau. Other states with coastal 
areas, archipelagos, and island nations in the Pacific 
and Indian Oceans and the Caribbean could lose 
much of their beaches and arable lands, which 
would cause severe economic and social disruption. 
Available responses to sea level rise fall broadly 
into three categories: 
• Retreat: Under this option no actions would be 
taken to protect the land from the sea—the 
focus would instead be on providing for people 
and ecosystems to shift landward in an optimal 
fashion. This choice could be motivated by ei-
ther excessive costs of protection or by a desire 
to maintain ecosystems. 
• Accommodation: 
Under this strategy, while no 
attempt would be made to protect the land at 
risk, measures would be taken to allow for con-
tinued habitation of the area. Specific responses 
under this option would include erecting flood 
shelters, elevating buildings on pilings, con-
verting agriculture to fish farming, or growing 
flood- or salt-tolerant species. 
• Protection: 
A protection strategy uses site-
specific features such as seawalls, dikes, dunes, 
and vegetation to protect the land from the sea 
so that existing land uses can be retained. 
There are various environmental, economic, social, 
cultural, legal, institutional, and technological im-
plications for each of these options. Retreat could 
lead to a loss of property, potentially costly resettle-
ment of populations, and, in some notable cases, 
refugee problems. Accommodation could result in 
declining property values and costs for modifying 
infrastructure. 
Protecting existing 
development 
from a one-meter sea level rise would require about 
360,000 kilometers of coastal defenses at a total cost 
of U.S.$500 billion, over the next one hundred 
years. The annual cost of protection represents, on 
average, 0.04 percent of total gross national product 
(GNP), and ranges from zero to 20 percent for 
Policymakers Summary 
xlv 
individual countries. The estimate is not discounted 
and does not reflect present coastal defense needs or 
impacts of salt water intrusion or flooding of un-
protected lands. Further, the protection could have 
negative impacts on fisheries, wildlife, and recre-
ation. The loss of traditional environments could 
potentially disrupt family life and create social in-
stability. 
Actions to Prepare for Possible Sea Level Rise 
A number of response options are available which 
not only enhance the ability of coastal nations to 
adapt to sea level rise, but are also beneficial in their 
own right. Implementation of such options would 
be most effective if undertaken in the short term, 
not because there is an impending catastrophe, but 
because there are opportunities to avoid adverse 
impacts by acting now—opportunities that may not 
be as effective if the process is delayed. These op-
tions include: 
National Coastal Planning 
• Development 
and implementation 
in the short 
term of comprehensive 
national 
coastal zone 
management plans, which (a) deal with both sea 
level rise and other impacts of global climate 
change and (b) ensure that risks to populations 
are minimized while recognizing the need to 
protect and maintain important coastal ecosys-
tems. 
• Identification 
of coastal areas at risk. National 
efforts are needed to (a) identify functions and 
resources at risk from a one-meter rise in sea 
level and (b) assess the implications of adaptive 
response measures on them. 
• Provisions 
to ensure that coastal 
development 
does not increase vulnerability 
to sea level rise. 
Actions in particular need of review include 
river levees and dams, conversions of man-
groves and other wetlands for agriculture and 
human habitation, harvesting of coral, and in-
creased settlement in low-lying areas. In addi-
tion, while structural measures to prepare for 
sea level rise are not yet warranted, the design 
and 
location of coastal infrastructure and 
coastal defenses should include consideration of 
sea level rise and other coastal impacts of cli-
mate change. It is sometimes less expensive to 
design a structure today, incorporating these 
factors, than to rebuild it later. 
• Review 
and strengthening 
of emergency pre-
paredness 
and coastal zone response mecha-
nisms. Efforts are needed to develop emergency 
preparedness plans for reducing vulnerability to 
coastal storms through better evacuation plan-
ning and the development of coastal defense 
mechanisms that recognize the impact of sea 
level rise. 
International Cooperation 
• Maintenance 
of a continuing international 
focus 
on the impacts of sea level rise. Existing interna-
tional organizations should be augmented with 
new mechanisms to focus attention and aware-
ness on sea level change and to encourage the 
nations of the world to develop appropriate 
responses. 
• Provision of technical assistance and cooperation 
to developing nations. Institutions offering fi-
nancial support should take into account the 
need for technical assistance and cooperation in 
developing coastal management plans, assessing 
coastal resources at risk, and increasing a na-
tion's ability—through education, training, 
and technology transfer—to address sea level 
rise. 
• Support by international 
organizations 
for 
na-
tional efforts to limit population 
growth 
in 
coastal areas. In the final analysis, rapid popula-
tion growth is the underlying problem with the 
greatest impact on both the efficacy of coastal 
zone management and the success of adaptive 
response options. 
Research, Data, and Information 
• Strengthening 
of research on the impacts 
of 
global climate change on sea level rise. Interna-
tional and national climate research pro-
grammes need to be directed at understanding 
and predicting changes in sea level, extreme 
events, precipitation, and other impacts of 
global climate change on coastal areas. 
• Development 
and implementation 
of a global 
ocean-observing 
network 
— for 
example, 
through the efforts of the I O C , W M O , and 
U N E P — t o establish a coordinated interna-
tional ocean-observing network that will allow 
for accurate assessment and continuous mon-
xlvi 
POLICYMAKERS SUMMARY 
itoring of changes in the world's oceans and 
coastal areas, particularly sea level changes and 
coastal erosion. 
• Dissemination 
of data and information 
on sea 
level change and adaptive options. A n interna-
tional mechanism could be identified with the 
participation of the parties concerned for col-
lecting and exchanging data and information on 
climate change and its impact on sea level and 
the coastal zone and on various adaptive op-
tions. Sharing this information with developing 
countries is critically important for preparation 
of coastal management plans. 
A programme could begin now to enable develop-
ing countries to implement coastal zone manage-
ment plans by the year 2000. The programme would 
provide for training of country experts, data collec-
tion, and technical assistance and cooperation. Esti-
mated funding to provide the necessary support 
over the next five years is U.S.$10,000,000. It is 
suggested that international organizations such as 
U N E P and W M O consider coordinating this pro-
gramme in consultation with interested nations. 
6.2 
RESOURCE USE A N D M A N A G E M E N T 
The reports of Working Groups I and II indicate 
significant and unavoidable impacts, both positive 
and negative, upon the very resources that humans 
and other species rely on to live. These resources 
include water, agriculture, livestock, fisheries, land, 
forests, and wildlife. The R S W G addressed these 
resource issues in the context of considering options 
for ensuring food security; conserving biological 
diversity; maintaining water supplies; and using 
land rationally for managed and unmanaged ecosys-
tems. 
The potential impacts of climate change on natu-
ral resources and human activities are poorly under-
stood. First, credible regional estimates of changes 
in critical climatic factors—such as temperature, 
soil moisture, annual and seasonal variability, and 
frequencies of droughts, floods, and storms—are 
simply not available. For many of these critical 
climate factors even the direction of change is 
uncertain. Second, methods for translating these 
changes into effects on the quantity and quality of 
resources are generally lacking. While it is clear that 
some of the impacts of climate change on resources 
could be negative and others positive, a more spe-
cific quantification of those impacts is not possible 
at this time. Nevertheless, these uncertainties do 
not preclude taking appropriate actions, especially 
if they are worthwhile for other, non-climate re-
lated, reasons. However, it can be said that: (a) 
those resources that are managed by humans (e.g., 
agriculture, forestry) are more suited to successful 
adaptation than unmanaged ecosystems; and (b) the 
faster the rate of change, the greater the impact. In 
that regard, it is very important to realize that some 
species will not be able to survive rapid climate 
changes. 
Through the ages societies and living things have 
developed the capability to adapt to the climate's 
natural variability and to extreme events. Several 
climatic zones span the globe, and resource use and 
management is an ongoing challenge in each of these 
zones. Therefore, society could borrow from this 
existing large reservoir of experience and knowl-
edge in developing policies to adapt to possible cli-
mate change. In addition, expected future economic 
and technological progress would provide the fi-
nancial and technical resources required to better 
adapt to a changing climate. Nevertheless, signifi-
cant costs and legal, institutional, and cultural 
adjustments may be necessary to implement ad-
aptation measures. 
In recognition of the uncertainties regarding the 
impacts of climate change on resource use and man-
agement, the following sections provide general, 
rather than specific, options in three categories. The 
appropriateness 
of these options for individual 
countries may vary depending on the specific social, 
environmental, and economic context. 
Short-Term Research Related Options 
There are a number of actions that would augment 
our knowledge base for making reasoned judgments 
about response strategies. These include: 
• developing inventories, data bases, monitoring 
systems, and catalogues of the current state of 
resources and resource use and management 
practices; 
• improving our scientific understanding of and 
predictive tools for critical climatic factors, 
Policymakers Summary 
xlvii 
their impacts on natural resources, and their 
socioeconomic consequences; 
• undertaking studies and assessments to gauge 
the resilience and adaptability of resources and 
their vulnerability to climate change; 
• encouraging research and development by both 
public and private enterprises directed toward 
more efficient resource use and biotechnologi-
cal innovation (with adequate safeguards for 
health, safety, and the environment), including 
allowing innovators to benefit from their work; 
• continuing existing research and development 
of methods to cope with the potentially worst 
consequences of climate change, such as devel-
oping more drought- or salinity-resistant culti-
vars or using classical and modern breeding 
techniques to help keep farming and forestry 
options open, and research on agrometeorol-
ogy or agroclimatology; 
• increasing research on the preservation of bio-
logical resources in situ and ex situ, including 
investigations into the size and location of pro-
tected natural areas and conservation corridors. 
Short-Term Policy Options 
Some response strategies are available that are prob-
ably economically justified under present-day con-
ditions and that could be undertaken for sound 
resource management reasons, even in the absence 
of climate change. In general, these relate to im-
proving the efficiency of natural resource use, fuller 
utilization of the "harvested" component of re-
sources, and waste reduction. Measures that could 
be implemented in the short term include: 
• increased emphasis on the development and 
adoption of technologies that may increase the 
productivity or efficiency (per unit of land or 
water) of crops, forests, livestock, fisheries, 
and human settlements, consistent with the 
principles of sustainable development. Such ef-
ficiencies reduce the demand for land for hu-
man activities and could also help reduce 
emissions of greenhouse gases. Examples of 
specific options include more efficient milk and 
meat production, improved food storage and 
distribution, and better water 
management 
practices; 
• increased promotion and strengthening of re-
source conservation and sustainable resource 
use—especially in highly vulnerable areas. Var-
ious initiatives could be explored for conserving 
the most sensitive and valuable resources, in-
cluding strengthening conservation measures, 
managing development of highly vulnerable re-
sources, and promoting reforestation and affor-
estation; 
• acceleration of economic development efforts 
in developing countries. Because these coun-
tries often have largely resource-based econ-
omies, efforts at improving agriculture and 
natural resource use would be particularly ben-
eficial. Such efforts would also promote capital 
formation, which would generally make adap-
tation to climate change and sustainable devel-
opment more feasible; 
• developing methods whereby local populations 
and resource users gain a stake in conservation 
and sustainable resource use—for example, by 
investing resource users with clear property 
rights and long-term tenure, and allowing vol-
untary water transfer or other market mecha-
nisms; 
• decentralizing, as practicable, decision making 
on resource use and management. 
Longer-Term Options 
There are also a number of other possible responses 
that are costly or otherwise appear to be more ap-
propriate for consideration in the longer term, once 
uncertainties regarding climate change impacts are 
reduced. Options in this category include: 
• building large capital structures (such as dams) 
to provide for enhanced availability of water 
and other resources; 
• strengthening and enlarging protected natural 
areas and examining the feasibility of estab-
lishing conservation corridors to enhance the 
adaptation prospects for unmanaged ecosys-
tems; 
• as appropriate, reviewing and eliminating direct 
and indirect subsidies and incentives for ineffi-
cient resource use, and other institutional bar-
riers to efficient resource use.

The RSWG also considered several priority areas 
that must be addressed in order to adequately im-
plement limitation or adaptation responses. These 
"implementation mechanisms" represent the pri-
mary vehicles through which national, regional, 
and international responses to climate can be 
brought into force. The specific implementation 
mechanisms considered were: 
• public education and information; 
• technology development and transfer; 
• economic (market) mechanisms; 
• financial mechanisms; and 
• legal and institutional mechanisms, including 
possible elements of a framework convention 
on climate change. 
The results of the RSWG's deliberations on these 
issues are provided below. 
7.1 
PUBLIC EDUCATION A N D 
INFORMATION 
A well-informed global population is essential for 
addressing and coping with an issue as complex as 
climate change. Because climate change would af-
fect, either directly or indirectly, almost every sec-
tor of society, broad global understanding of the 
issue will facilitate the adoption and implementa-
tion of such response options as deemed necessary 
and appropriate. The dissemination of information 
also represents a powerful economic instrument for 
ensuring that markets accurately take into account 
potential consequences and/or opportunities of cli-
mate change. 
The core aims of public education and informa-
tion programmes are to: 
• promote awareness and knowledge of climate 
change issues; 
• provide guidance for positive practices to limit 
and/or adapt to climate change; 
• encourage wide participation of all sectors of the 
population of all countries, both developed and 
developing, in addressing climate change issues 
and developing appropriate responses; and 
• especially emphasize key target groups, such as 
children and youth, as well as individuals at 
household levels, policymakers and leaders, 
media, educational institutions, scientists, busi-
ness and agricultural sectors. 
Given the importance of a well-informed popula-
tion, the R S W G developed suggestions and ap-
proaches for improving international awareness of 
the potential causes and impacts of climate change. 
In this process it was recognized that, while broad-
based understanding is essential, no single mecha-
nism can work for every group or in every culture 
or country. The social, economic, and cultural di-
versity of nations will likely require educational 
approaches and information tailored to the specific 
requirements and resources of particular locales, 
countries, or regions. The importance of education 
and information for developing countries cannot be 
overemphasized. 
A number of national and international actions 
should be taken to disseminate broadly information 
on climate change. These include the: 
• establishment of national committees or clear-
inghouses to collect, develop, and disseminate 
objective materials on climate change issues. 
This could help provide focal points for infor-
mation on issues such as energy efficiency, en-
ergy savings, forestry, agriculture, etc.; 
• use by international organizations ( U N E S C O , 
U N E P , W M O , etc.) and non-governmental 
organizations of I P C C and other relevant re-
ports in developing and providing to all .coun-
tries an adequate understanding for future 
actions; 
• use of an existing international institution, or 
development of a new institution, if necessary, 
to serve as a clearinghouse for informational 
and educational materials; 
• upon completion of the IPCC reports, or ear-
lier, arranging a series of short seminars tar-
geted to inform high-priority decision makers, 
world leaders, and others of causes and effects 
of climate change.

T E C H N O L O G Y DEVELOPMENT A N D 
TRANSFER 
The development and transfer of technologies are 
vital to any effort to address global climate change. 
The development of new technologies may provide 
the means by which societies can meet their energy, 
food, and other needs in the face of changes in 
global climate, while at the same time minimizing 
emissions of greenhouse gases. Prompt transfer of 
technologies, especially to developing countries, is 
likewise an important aspect of any effort to limit or 
adapt to climate change. 
Technology Research and Development 
Technological development, including improve-
ment and reassessment of existing technologies, 
is needed to limit or reduce anthropogenic green-
house gas emissions; absorb such gases by protect-
ing and increasing sinks; adapt human activities 
and resource use and management to the impacts of 
climate change; and detect, monitor, and predict 
climate change and its impacts. Technological de-
velopment could be pursued in a wide range of 
activities such as energy, industry, agriculture, 
transport, water supply, coastal protection, man-
agement of natural resources, and housing and 
building construction. 
Adequate and trained human resources are a pre-
requisite for development and transfer of technolo-
gies, and technological actions, founded on a sound 
scientific basis, must be consistent with the concept 
of sustainable development. 
Criteria for selecting technologies include such 
factors as the existence of economic and social bene-
fits in addition to environmental benefits, economic 
efficiency taking into account all the external costs, 
suitability to local needs, ease of administration, 
information needs, and acceptability to the public. 
Appropriate pricing policies where applicable, 
information exchange on the state of development 
of technologies, and the support of governments are 
important measures that can promote technology 
development. Also of importance are international 
collaborative efforts, especially between the indus-
trialized and the developing countries in the bilat-
eral and multilateral context. 
Technology Transfer 
There is a need for the rapid transfer to the develop-
ing countries, on a preferential basis, of technolo-
gies for addressing climate change. Developing 
countries are of the view that transfer of technolo-
gies on a noncommercial basis is necessary and that 
specific bilateral and multilateral arrangements 
should be established to promote this. Some other 
countries where technologies are not owned by the 
government believe that transfer of technologies 
would be a function of commercial negotiations. 
The issue of intellectual property rights also pre-
sents a case where international opinion is mixed. 
A number of impediments also exist that hinder 
the effective transfer of technologies to developing 
countries. These include lack of financial resources, 
necessary institutions, and trained human re-
sources. Existing institutions could be strength-
ened, or new mechanisms 
established, 
where 
appropriate, to finance technology transfers, train 
human resources, and evaluate, introduce, and op-
erate existing or new technologies. Legal barriers 
and restrictive trade practices are also impeding fac-
tors. 
It has not been possible to bridge the difference 
on views on some of the questions mentioned 
above. It is extremely important to reach early in-
ternational agreement on these issues in order to 
promote effective flow of technologies to monitor, 
limit, or adapt to climate change. One area where 
international agreement may be possible is the pro-
motion of C F C substitutes and provision of assis-
tance and cooperation to the developing countries 
in the acquisition and manufacture of such substi-
tutes. 
Several countries have suggested that the issue of 
technology transfer to Eastern European countries 
be addressed. 
7.3 
ECONOMIC MECHANISMS 
It is important that any potential measures to limit 
or adapt to global climate change be as economically 
efficient and cost-effective as possible, while taking 
into account important social implications. In gen-
eral, environmental objectives can be achieved 
either through regulations requiring the use of a 
1 
POLICYMAKERS 
SUMMARY 
specific technology or attainment of specific goals, 
or economic instruments such as emissions fees, 
subsidies, tradeable permits, or sanctions. 
Economic instruments, through their encourage-
ment of flexible selection of abatement measures, 
frequently offer the possibility of achieving envi-
ronmental improvements at lower cost than regula-
tory mechanisms. Unlike many regulations, they 
tend to encourage innovation and the development 
of improved technologies and practices for reducing 
emissions. Economic mechanisms also have the po-
tential to provide the signals necessary for more 
environmentally sensitive operation of markets. It 
is unlikely, however, that economic instruments 
will be applicable to all circumstances. 
Three factors are considered as potential barriers 
to the operation of markets and/or the achievement 
of environmental objectives through market mecha-
nisms. These are: information problems, which can 
often cause markets to produce less effective or un-
favorable environmental outcomes; existing 
mea-
sures and institutions, 
which can encourage indi-
viduals to behave in environmentally damaging 
ways; and balancing 
competing objectives (social, 
environmental, and economic). A n initial response 
strategy may therefore be to address information 
problems directly and to review existing measures 
that may be barriers. For example, prior to possible 
adoption of a system of emission charges, countries 
should examine existing subsidies and tax incentives 
on energy and other relevant greenhouse gas pro-
ducing sectors. 
A general advantage of market based economic 
instruments is that they encourage limitations or 
reductions in emissions by those who can achieve 
them at least cost. They also provide an ongoing 
incentive for industry and individual consumers to 
apply the most efficient limitation/reduction mea-
sures through, for example, more efficient and 
cleaner technologies. Such incentives may be lack-
ing in the case of regulations. 
Regulations are the customary means of control-
ling pollution in both market and centrally planned 
economies. A n advantage of regulations is that, in 
certain circumstances, they create more certainty as 
to desired outcomes, whereas major disadvantages 
are that they may discourage innovation, introduce 
inflexibilities in meeting objectives, can discourage 
resource use efficiency, and offer few or no incen-
tives to reduce emissions below specified levels. 
It is evident that the question of adoption of any 
form of economic instrument, whether domes-
tically or internationally, raises many complex and 
difficult issues. Careful and substantive analysis of 
all implications of such instruments that have been 
identified for consideration include: 
• A system of tradeable 
emissions permits: 
A n 
emission permit system is based on the concept 
that the economic costs of attaining a given 
environmental goal can be minimized by allow-
ing for the trading of emissions rights. Once an 
overall limit on emissions has been set, emis-
sions entitlements amounting to that limit 
could be provided to emitting sources and free 
trading of such entitlements allowed. This 
would reduce the costs of meeting a given emis-
sion target because: (a) as in trade, comparative 
advantages between trading entities would be 
maximized; and (b) economic incentives would 
be created for the development of improved 
greenhouse gas limitation technologies, sink 
enhancement, and resource use efficiency (en-
ergy conservation). Concerns with this ap-
proach include the limited experience with this 
instrument, the potential scope and size of trad-
ing markets, and the need for the development 
of an administrative structure not currently in 
place. 
• A system of emission charges: Emission charges 
are levied on specified emissions depending on 
their level of contribution to climate change. 
Such changes may provide a means of encour-
aging emitters to limit or reduce emissions and 
provide an incentive for diverse parties to im-
plement efficient means of limiting or reducing 
emissions. Another advantage of charges is that 
they generate revenue that could provide a 
funding base for further pollution abatement, 
research, and administration, or allow other 
taxes to be lowered. Concerns with this ap-
proach include the difficulty of deciding on the 
basis and size of the tax, and the lack of cer-
tainty that the tax will achieve the agreed emis-
sion reduction target. 
• Subsidies: Subsidies are aimed at encouraging 
environmentally sound actions by lowering 
their costs. Subsidies could be used, inter alia, 
to encourage the use of energy-efficient equip-
ment and non-fossil energy sources, and the 
Policymakers Summary 
li 
development and greater use of environmen-
tally sound technologies. Concerns with sub-
sidies include the possible size of the required 
financial commitment of governments, the need 
for careful design, the need for review, and the 
international trade aspects of such measures. 
• Sanctions. A final type of economic instrument 
is the use of economic sanctions for the enforce-
ment of international agreements. This would 
require an international convention to establish 
a system of agreed trade or financial sanctions 
to be imposed on countries not adhering to 
agreed regimes. Many contributors expressed 
considerable reservations about applying this 
approach to greenhouse gas emissions because 
of the complexity of the situation. The concerns 
include a belief that sanctions could appear to 
be arbitrary, could create confusion and resent-
ment, and could be used as a pretext to impose 
new non-tariff trade barriers. 
It has also been suggested that environmental pro-
tection could be advanced and the economic costs of 
meeting greenhouse gas limitation targets, if any, 
minimized by addressing, to the extent feasible, all 
greenhouse gas sources and sinks comprehensively. 
This approach could employ an "index" relating net 
emissions of various greenhouse gases by further 
development of the index formulated by Working 
Group I. 
Each of the approaches outlined above, however, 
poses potentially significant challenges in terms of 
implementation and acceptability. There is an in-
complete understanding of the economic and social 
consequences of these various approaches. It is evi-
dent that further work is required in all countries, 
and in ongoing I P C C work, to fully evaluate the 
practicality of such measures and costs and benefits 
associated with different mechanisms, especially 
with their use internationally. It has, however, been 
pointed out that an international system of trade-
able permits, or, alternatively, an international sys-
tem of emissions charges, could offer the potential 
of serving as a cost-efficient main instrument for 
achieving a defined target for the reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
Finally, it was stressed that in order to share 
equitably the economic burdens, implementation of 
any of the international economic instruments dis-
cussed above should take into account the circum-
stances that most emissions affecting the atmo-
sphere at present originated in the industrialized 
countries where the scope for change is the greatest, 
and that, under present conditions, emissions from 
developing countries are growing and may need to 
grow in order to meet their development require-
ments and thus, over time, are likely to represent an 
increasingly significant percentage of global emis-
sions. It is appreciated that each instrument assessed 
has a role in meeting greenhouse gas emission objec-
tives, but the suitability of particular instruments is 
dependent on the particular circumstances and at 
this stage no measure can be considered universally 
superior to any other available mechanisms. 
7.4 
FINANCIAL MECHANISMS 
Industrialized and developing countries consider it 
important that assurances of financial mechanisms 
are needed for undertaking adequate measures to 
limit and/or adapt to climate change. 
Guiding Principles 
The following principles should guide the financial 
approach: 
a) Industrialized countries and developing coun-
tries have a common responsibility in dealing 
with problems arising from climate change, 
and effective responses require a global effort. 
b) Industrialized countries should take the lead 
and have specific responsibilities on two 
levels: 
(i) major part of emissions affecting the 
atmosphere at present originates in indus-
trialized countries where the scope for 
change is greatest. Industrialized coun-
tries should adopt domestic measures to 
limit climate change by adapting their 
own economies in line with future agree-
ments to limit emissions; 
(ii) to cooperate with developing countries in 
international action, without standing in 
the way of the latter's development, by 
contributing 
additional 
financial 
re-
sources, by appropriate transfer of tech-
nology, by engaging in close cooperation 
lii

SUMMARY 
concerning 
scientific observation, 
by 
analysis and research, and finally by 
means of technical cooperation geared to 
forestalling and managing environmental 
problems. 
c) Emissions from developing countries 
are 
growing and may need to grow in order to 
meet their development requirements and 
thus, over time, are likely to represent in in-
creasingly significant percentage of global 
emissions. 
Developing 
countries 
should, 
within the limits feasible, take measures to 
suitably adapt their economies. Financial re-
sources channeled to developing countries 
would be most effective if focused on those 
activities that contribute both to limiting 
greenhouse gas emissions and promoting eco-
nomic development. Areas for cooperation 
and assistance could include: 
• efficient use of energy resources and the in-
creased use of fossil fuels with lower green-
house gas 
emission rates or non-fossil 
sources; 
• rational forest management practices and ag-
ricultural techniques that reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions; 
• facilitating technology transfer and technol-
ogy development; 
• measures that enhance the capacity of devel-
oping countries to develop programmes to 
address climate change, including research 
and development 
activities 
and public 
awareness and education; 
• participation by developing countries in in-
ternational forums on global climate change, 
such as the IPCC. 
It was also recognized that cooperation and assis-
tance for adaptive measures would be required, not-
ing that for some regions and countries, adaptation 
rather than limitation activities are potentially most 
important. 
A number of possible sources for generating fi-
nancial resources were considered. These include 
general taxation, specific taxation on greenhouse 
gas emissions, and emissions trading. For the signif-
icant complexities and implications of such taxes, 
reference is made to the economic measures paper 
(section 7.3). Creative suggestions include using 
undisbursed official resources, which might result 
from savings on government energy bills and lower 
levels of military expenditures, a fixed percentage 
tax on travel tickets, and levies on countries that 
have been unable to meet their obligations. The 
question has also been raised of whether such finan-
cial cooperation and assistance should be given only 
to those countries that abstain from activities pro-
ducing greenhouse gases. A positive international 
economic environment, including further reduction 
of trade barriers and implementation of more equi-
table trade practices, would help to generate re-
sources that can be applied toward pressing needs. 
With respect to institutional mechanisms for pro-
viding financial cooperation and assistance to devel-
oping countries, a two-track approach was con-
sidered. 
i) One track built on work under way or 
planned in existing institutions. In this regard, 
the World Bank, a number of regional banks, 
other multilateral organizations, and bilateral 
agencies have initiated efforts to incorporate 
global climate change issues into their pro-
grammes. Bilateral donors could further inte-
grate and reinforce the environmental com-
ponents of their assistance programmes and 
develop co-financing arrangements with mul-
tilateral institutions while ensuring that this 
does not impose inappropriate environmental 
conditions. 
ii) Parallel to this track the possibility of new 
mechanisms and facilities was considered. 
Some developing and industrialized countries 
suggested that new mechanisms directly re-
lated to a future climate convention and pro-
tocols, such as a new international fund, were 
required. It was added that such new instru-
ments could be located within the World Bank 
(with new rules) or elsewhere. It was also 
noted that the Global Environmental Facility 
proposed by the World Bank in collaboration 
with U N E P and U N D P was welcomed by 
industrialized and developing countries at the 
World Bank Development Committee meet-
ing in May 1990. 
It was noted that the issue of generating financial 
resources was distinct from that of allocating those 
resources.

with donor assistance, for developing countries on 
their current and projected net emissions levels and 
assistance and cooperation needs for limiting such 
emissions. Further consideration is also needed of 
the important role which the private sector might 
play, through technology transfer, foreign direct 
investment, and other means to assist and cooperate 
with developing countries to respond to climate 
change. 
7.5 
LEGAL A N D INSTITUTIONAL 
MECHANISMS 
A number of institutions and international legal 
mechanisms exist that have a bearing on the climate 
change issue, in particular those dealing with the 
environment, science and technology, energy, nat-
ural resources, and financial assistance. One of 
these existing international legal mechanisms, the 
Vienna Convention on the Protection of the Ozone 
Layer and its associated Montreal Protocol on Sub-
stances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, deals specifi-
cally with reducing emissions of important green-
house gases that also deplete the ozone layer. How-
ever, there is a general view that, while existing legal 
instruments and institutions related to climate 
change should be fully utilized and further strength-
ened, they are insufficient alone to meet the chal-
lenge. 
A consensus emerged at the 44th session of the 
U N General Assembly on the need to prepare as a 
matter of urgency a framework convention on cli-
mate change, laying down, as a minimum, general 
principles and obligations. It should, in the view of 
RSWG, be framed in such a way as to gain the 
adherence of the largest possible number and most 
suitably balanced range of countries while permit-
ting timely action to be taken. It may contain provi-
sions for separate annexes/protocol(s) to deal with 
specific obligations. As part of the commitment of 
the parties to action on greenhouse gas emissions 
and adverse effects of climate change, the conven-
tion should also address the particular financial and 
other needs of the developing countries (notably 
those most vulnerable to climate change agri-
culturally or otherwise), the question of access to 
and transfer of technology, the need for research 
and monitoring, and institutional requirements. 
Decisions will have to be taken on a number of 
key issues. These include: 
• the political imperative of striking the correct 
balances (a) between the arguments for a far-
reaching, action-oriented convention and the 
need for urgent adoption of a convention so as 
to begin tackling the problem of climate 
change; and (b) among the risks of inaction, the 
costs of action, and current levels of scientific 
uncertainty; 
• the extent to which specific obligations, partic-
ularly on the control of emissions of green-
house gases, should be 
included in the 
convention itself, possibly as annexes, or be the 
subject of a separate protocol(s); 
• the timing of negotiation of protocol(s) in rela-
tion to the negotiations on the convention; 
• the introduction, as appropriate, of sound sci-
entific bases for establishing emission targets 
(such as total emission levels, per capita emis-
sions, emissions per G N P , emissions per en-
ergy use, climatic conditions, past perform-
ance, geographic 
characteristics, 
fossil fuel 
resource base, carbon intensity per unit of 
energy, energy intensity per G N P , socio-
economic costs and benefits, or other equitable 
considerations); 
• the extent to which specific goals with respect 
to global levels of emissions or atmospheric 
concentrations of greenhouse gases should be 
addressed; 
• whether obligations should be equitably differ-
entiated according to countries' respective re-
sponsibilities for causing and combating climate 
change and their level of development; 
• the need for additional resources for developing 
countries and the manner in which this should 
be addressed, particularly in terms of the na-
ture, size, and conditions of the funding, even if 
detailed arrangements form the subject of a sep-
arate protocol; 
• the basis on which the promotion of the devel-
opment and transfer of technology and provi-
sion of technical assistance and cooperation to 
developing countries should take place, taking 
into account considerations such as terms of 
transfer (preferential or non-preferential, com-
mercial or non-commercial), assured access, in-
tellectual property rights, the environmental 
liv

SUMMARY 
soundness of such technology, and the financial 
implications; 
• the nature of any new institutions to be created 
by the convention (such as Conference of the 
Parties, an Executive Organ, as well as other 
bodies), together with their functions, compo-
sition 
and 
decision-making powers, 
e.g., 
whether or not they should exercise supervision 
and control over the obligations undertaken. 
The international negotiation on a framework 
convention should start as quickly as possible after 
the completion of the I P C C interim report. The full 
and effective participation of developing countries 
in this process is essential. Many, essentially devel-
oping, countries stressed that the negotiation must 
be conducted in the forum, manner, and with the 
timing to be decided by the U N General Assembly. 
This understanding also applies to any associated 
protocols. In the view of many countries and inter-
national and non-governmental organizations, the 
process should be conducted with a view of con-
cluding it not later than the 1992 U N Conference on 
Environment and Development. 
The foregoing does not necessarily constitute an 
exclusive list of issues that will arise in the negotia-
tions. However, a readiness to address these funda-
mental problems will be a prerequisite for ensuring 
the success of the negotiations and the support of a 
sufficiently wide and representative spread of na-
tions. The legal measures topic paper developed by 
the Working Group is given in Annex I.

1) The coordinators' report has as its primary 
objective the compilation of elements that 
might be included in a future framework Con-
vention on Climate Change, and a discussion 
of the issues that are likely to arise in the 
context of developing those elements. 
2) There is a general view that while existing legal 
instruments and institutions with a bearing on 
climate should be fully utilized and further 
strengthened, they are insufficient alone to 
meet the challenge. A very broad international 
consensus has therefore emerged in the IPCC, 
confirmed notably at the 44th United Nations 
General Assembly, on the need for a frame-
work Convention on Climate Change. Such a 
Convention should generally follow the for-
mat of the Vienna Convention for the Protec-
tion of the Ozone Layer, in laying down, as a 
minimum, general principles and obligations. 
It should further be framed in such a way as to 
gain the adherence of the largest possible num-
ber and most suitably balanced spread of 
countries while permitting timely action to be 
taken; it should contain provision for separate 
annexes/protocols to deal with specific obliga-
tions. As part of the commitment of the par-
ties to action on greenhouse gas emissions and 
the adverse effects of global warming, the 
Convention would also address the particular 
3) The paper points out a number of issues to be 
decided in the negotiation of a Convention. In 
general these are: 
• the political imperative of striking the cor-
rect balances: on the one hand, between the 
arguments 
for 
a 
far-reaching, 
action-
oriented Convention and the need for ur-
gent adoption of such a Convention so as to 
begin tackling the problem of climate 
change; and, on the other hand, between the 
cost of inaction and the lack of scientific 
certainty; 
• the extent to which specific obligations, par-
ticularly on the control of emissions of car-
bon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, 
should be included in the Convention itself 
or be the subject of separate protocol(s): 
• the timing of negotiations of such proto-
cols) in relation to the negotiations on the 
Convention. 
4) In particular, within the Convention the fol-
lowing specific issues will need to be ad-
dressed: 
(a) Financial 
needs of developing 
countries. 
The need for additional resources for de-
veloping countries and the manner in

SUMMARY 
which this should be addressed, partic-
ularly in terms of the nature, size, and 
conditions of the funding, even if detailed 
arrangements form the subject of a sepa-
rate protocol, will have to be considered 
by the negotiating parties. 
(b) Development 
and transfer of 
technology. 
The basis on which the promotion of the 
development and transfer of technology 
and provision of technical assistance to 
developing countries should take place 
will need to be elaborated, taking into ac-
count considerations such as terms of 
transfer, assured access, intellectual prop-
erty rights, and the environmental sound-
ness of such technology. 
(c) Institutions. 
Views differ substantially on 
the role and powers of the institutions to 
be created by the Convention, particularly 
in exercising supervision and control over 
the obligations undertaken. 
5) The inclusion of any particular element in the 
paper does not imply consensus with respect 
to that element, or the agreement of any par-
ticular government to include that element in a 
Convention. 
6) The coordinators have not sought to make a 
value judgment in listing and summarizing in 
the attached paper the elements proposed for 
inclusion in a framework Convention: their 
text seeks merely to assist the future negotia-
tors in their task. They note, however, that a 
readiness to address the foregoing fundamen-
tal problems in a realistic manner will be a 
prerequisite for ensuring the success of the 
negotiations and the support of a sufficiently 
wide and representative spread of nations.

In keeping with common treaty practice including 
the format of the Vienna Convention, the Climate 
Change Convention would contain a preamble 
which might seek to address some or all of the 
following items: 
• a description of the problem and reasons for 
action (need for timely and effective response 
without awaiting absolute scientific certainty); 
• reference to relevant international legal instru-
ments (such as the Vienna Convention and 
Montreal Protocol) and declarations (such as 
U N G A Resolution 43/53 and Principle 21 of 
the Stockholm Declaration); 
• recognition that climate change is a common 
concern of mankind, affects humanity as a 
whole, and should be approached within a 
global framework, without prejudice to the 
sovereignty of states over the airspace superad-
jacent to their territory as recognized under 
international law; 
• recognition of the need for an environment of a 
quality that permits a life of dignity and well-
being for present and future generations; 
• reference to the balance between the sovereign 
right of states to exploit natural resources and 
the concomitant duty to protect and conserve 
climate for the benefit of mankind, in a manner 
not to diminish either; 
• endorsement and elaboration of the concept of 
sustainable development; 
• recognition of the need to improve scientific 
knowledge (e.g., through systematic observa-
tion) and to study the social and economic im-
pacts of climate change, respecting national 
sovereignty; 
• recognition of the importance of the develop-
ment and transfer of technology and of the cir-
cumstances and needs, particularly financial, of 
developing countries; need for regulatory, sup-
portive, and adjustment measures to take into 
account different levels of development and 
thus differing needs of countries; 
• recognition of the responsibility of all countries 
to make efforts at the national, regional, and 
global levels to limit or reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions and prevent activities that could ad-
versely affect climate, while bearing in mind 
that: 
-most emissions affecting the atmosphere at 
present originate in industrialized countries 
where the scope for change is greatest; 
-implementation may take place in different 
time frames for different categories of coun-
tries and may be qualified by the means at the 
disposal of individual countries and their sci-
entific and technical capabilities; 
-emissions 
from developing countries 
are 
growing and may need to grow in order to 
meet their development requirements and 
thus, over time, are likely to represent an in-
lvii 
Iviii 
POLICYMAKERS SUMMARY 
creasingly significant percentage of global 
emissions; 
• recognition of the need to develop strategies to 
absorb greenhouse gases, i.e., protect and in-
crease greenhouse gas sinks; to limit or reduce 
anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions; and 
to adapt human activities to the impacts of cli-
mate change. 
Other key issues that will have to be addressed 
during the development of the preambular language 
include: 
• should mankind's interest in a viable environ-
ment be characterized as a fundamental right? 
• is there an entitlement not to be subjected, di-
rectly or indirectly, to the adverse effects of 
climate change? 
• should there be a reference to the precautionary 
principle? 
• in view of the interrelationship among all green-
house gases, their sources and sinks, should 
they be treated collectively? 
• should countries be permitted to meet their ag-
gregate global climate objectives through joint 
arrangements? 
• should reference be made to weather modifica-
tion agreements such as the E N M O D treaty as 
relevant legal instruments? 
• is there a common interest of mankind in the 
development and application of technologies to 
protect and preserve climate? 
• does the concept of sustainable development 
exclude or include the imposition of new condi-
tionality in the provision of financial assistance 
to developing countries, and does it imply a link 
between the protection and preservation of the 
environment, including climate change, and 
economic development, so that both are to be 
secured in a coherent and consistent manner? 
• should the preamble address the particular 
problems of countries with an agricultural sys-
tem vulnerable to climate change and with lim-
ited 
access 
to 
capital 
and 
technologies, 
recognizing the link with sustainable develop-
ment? 
• is there a minimum standard of living that is a 
prerequisite to adopting response strategies to 
address climate change?

As is the practice, definitions will need to be elabo-
rated in a specific article on definitions. The terms 
that will need to be defined will depend on the 
purpose of the Convention and thus the language 
used by the negotiating parties. 
G E N E R A L 
O B L I G A T I O N S 
Following the format of such treaties as the Vienna 
Convention, an article would set out the general 
obligations agreed to by the parties to the Conven-
tion. Such obligations may relate to, for example: 
• the adoption of appropriate measures to protect 
against the adverse effects of climate change, to 
limit, reduce, adapt to, and, as far as possible, 
prevent climate change in accordance with the 
means at the disposal of individual countries 
and their scientific and technical capabilities; 
and to avoid creating other environmental 
problems in taking such measures; 
• the protection, stabilization, and improvement 
of the composition of the atmosphere in order 
to conserve climate for the benefit of present 
and future generations; 
• taking steps having the effect of limiting climate 
change but which are already justified on other 
grounds; 
• the use of climate for peaceful purposes only, in 
a spirit of good neighborliness; 
• cooperation by means of research, systematic 
observation, and information exchange in order 
to understand better and assess the effects of 
human activities on the climate and the poten-
tial adverse environmental and socio-economic 
impacts that could result from climate change, 
respecting national sovereignty; 
• the encouragement of the development and 
transfer of relevant technologies, as well as the 
provision of technical and financial assistance, 
taking into account the particular needs of de-
veloping countries to enable them to fulfill their 
obligations; 
Policymakers Summary 
lix 
• cooperation in the formulation and harmoniza-
tion of policies and strategies directed at limit-
ing, reducing, adapting to, and, as far as 
possible, preventing climate change; 
• cooperation in the adoption of appropriate legal 
or administrative measures to address climate 
change; 
• provision for bilateral, multilateral, and re-
gional agreements or arrangements not incom-
patible with the Convention and any annex/ 
protocol, including opportunities for groups of 
countries to fulfill the requirements on a re-
gional or subregional basis; 
• cooperation with competent international orga-
nizations effectively to meet the objectives of 
the Convention; 
• the encouragement of and cooperation in the 
promotion of public education and awareness 
of the environmental and socio-economic im-
pacts of greenhouse gas emissions and of cli-
mate change; 
• the strengthening or modification if necessary 
of existing legal and institutional instruments 
and arrangements relating to climate change; 
• a provision on funding mechanisms. 
Other key issues will have to be addressed in the 
process of elaborating this article, such as the ques-
tions below: 
• should there be a provision setting any specific 
goals with respect to levels of emissions (global 
or national) or atmospheric concentrations of 
greenhouse gases while ensuring stable devel-
opment of the world economy, particularly sta-
bilization by industrialized countries, as a first 
step, and later reduction of C 0 2 emissions and 
emissions of other greenhouse gases not con-
trolled by the Montreal Protocol? Such a provi-
sion would not exclude the application of more 
stringent national or regional emission goals 
than those that may be provided for in the Con-
vention and/or any annex/protocol. 
• in light of the preambular language, should 
there be a provision recognizing that imple-
mentation of obligations may take place in dif-
ferent time frames for different categories of 
country and/or may be qualified by the means 
at the disposal of individual countries and their 
scientific and technical capabilities ? 
• should there be a commitment to formulate ap-
propriate measures such as annexes, protocols, 
or other legal instruments and, if so, should 
such formulation be on a sound scientific basis 
or on the basis of the best available scientific 
knowledge? 
• in addressing the transfer of technology partic-
ularly to developing countries, what should 
be the terms of such transfers (i.e., commer-
cial versus non-commercial, preferential versus 
non-preferential, 
the relationship 
between 
transfers and the protection of intellectual 
property rights)? 
• should funding mechanisms be limited to mak-
ing full use of existing mechanisms or also entail 
new and additional resources and mechanisms? 
• should provision be made for environmental 
impact assessments of planned activities that are 
likely to cause significant climate change as well 
as for prior notice of such activities ? 
• what should be the basis of emission goals— 
e.g., total emission levels, per capita emissions, 
emissions per G N P , emissions per energy use, 
climatic conditions, past performance, geo-
graphic characteristics, fossil fuel resource base, 
carbon intensity per unit of energy, energy in-
tensity per G N P , socio-economic costs and 
benefits, or other equitable considerations? 
• should the particular problem of sea level rise be 
specifically addressed? 
• is there a link between nuclear stockpiles and 
climate change? 
I N S T I T U T I O N S 
It has been the general practice under international 
environmental agreements to establish various insti-
tutional mechanisms. The parties to a Climate 
Change Convention might, therefore, wish to make 
provision for a Conference of the Parties, an Execu-
tive Organ, and a Secretariat. The Conference of the 
Parties may, among other things: keep under con-
tinuous review the implementation of the Conven-
tion and take appropriate decisions to this end; 
review current scientific information; and promote 
harmonization of policies and strategies directed at

limiting, reducing, adapting to, and, as far as possi-
ble, preventing climate change. 
Questions that will arise in developing provisions 
for appropriate institutional mechanisms include: 
• should any of the Convention's institutions 
(e.g., the Conference of the Parties and/or the 
Executive Organ) have the ability to take deci-
sions, inter alia, on response strategies or func-
tions in respect of surveillance, verification, and 
compliance that would be binding on all the 
parties and, if so, should such an institution 
represent all of the parties or be composed of a 
limited number of parties, e.g., based on equi-
table geographic representation? 
• what should be the role of the Secretariat? 
• what should be the decision-making pro-
cedures, including voting requirements (e.g., 
consensus, majority)? 
• if a trust fund or other financial mechanism 
were established under the Convention, how 
should it be administered? 
• should scientific and/or other bodies be estab-
lished on a permanent or ad hoc basis, to pro-
vide advice and make recommendations to the 
Conference of the Parties concerning research 
activities and measures to deal with climate 
change? 
• should the composition of the above bodies 
reflect equitable climatic or geographic repre-
sentation? 
• should there be a provision for working groups, 
e.g., on scientific matters as well as on socio-
economic impacts and response strategies? 
• is there a need for innovative approaches to 
institutional mechanisms in the light of the na-
ture of the climate change issue? 
• what should be the role of non-governmental 
organizations?

It would appear to follow general practice to include 
provision for cooperation in research and system-
atic monitoring. In terms of research, each party 
might be called upon to undertake, initiate, and/or 
cooperate in, directly or through international 
bodies, the conduct of research on and analysis of: 
• physical and chemical processes that may affect 
climate; 
• substances, practices, processes, and activities 
that could modify the climate; 
• techniques 
for monitoring and 
measuring 
greenhouse gas emission rates and their uptake 
by sinks; 
• improved climate models, particularly for re-
gional climates; 
• environmental, social, and economic effects 
that could result from modifications of climate; 
• alternative substances, technologies, and prac-
tices; 
• environmental, social, and economic effects of 
response strategies; 
• human activities affecting climate; 
• coastal areas with particular reference to sea 
level rise; 
• water resources; and 
• energy efficiency. 
The parties might also be called upon to cooper-
ate in establishing and improving, directly or 
through competent international bodies, and taking 
fully into account national legislation and relevant 
ongoing activities at the national, regional, and in-
ternational levels, joint or complementary pro-
grammes for systematic monitoring and analysis of 
climate, including a possible worldwide system; 
and cooperate in ensuring the collection, validation, 
and transmission of research, observational data, 
and analysis through appropriate data centers. 
Other issues that will arise in developing this 
provision include: 
• should consideration be given to the establish-
ment of panels of experts or of an independent 
scientific board responsible for the coordina-
tion of data collection from the above areas of 
research and analysis and for periodic assess-
ment of the data? 
• should provision be made for on-site inspec-
tion? 
• should there be provision for open and non-
discriminatory access to meteorological data 
developed by all countries? 
• should a specific research fund be established?

Precedents would suggest the inclusion of a provi-
sion for the transmission of information through 
the Secretariat to the Conference of the Parties on 
measures adopted by them in implementation of the 
Convention and of protocols to which they are 
party. In an annex to the Vienna Convention, the 
types of information exchanged are specified and 
include scientific, technical, socio-economic, com-
mercial, and legal information. 
For the purposes of elaborating this provision, 
issues having to be addressed by the negotiating 
parties include the following: 
• is there a need for the elaboration of a compre-
hensive international research programme in 
order to facilitate cooperation in the exchange 
of scientific, technological, and other informa-
tion on climate change? 
• should parties be obliged to report on measures 
they have adopted for the implementation of 
the Convention, with the possible inclusion of 
regular reporting on a comparable basis of their 
emissions of greenhouse gases? 
• should each party additionally be called upon to 
develop a national inventory of emissions, 
strategies, and available technologies for ad-
dressing climate change? If so, the Convention 
might also call for the exchange of information 
on such inventories, strategies, and technolo-
gies.

While the issue of technology has been addressed in 
the section on General Obligations, it might be 
considered desirable to include separate provisions 
on technology transfer and technical cooperation. 
Such provisions could call upon the parties to pro-
mote the development and transfer of technology 
and technical cooperation, taking into account par-
ticularly the needs of developing countries, to en-
able them to take measures to protect against the 
adverse effects of climate change, to limit, reduce, 
and, as far as possible, prevent climate change, or to 
adapt to it. 
Another issue that will arise is: should special 
terms be attached to climate-related transfers of 
technology (such as a preferential and/or non-
commercial basis and assured access to, and transfer 
of, environmentally sound technologies on favor-
able terms to developing countries), taking into 
consideration the protection of intellectual property 
rights? 
S E T T L E M E N T O F D I S P U T E S 
It would be usual international practice to include a 
provision on the settlement of disputes that may 
arise concerning the interpretation or application of 
the Convention and/or any annex/protocol. Provi-
sions similar to those in the Vienna Convention for 
the Protection of the Ozone Layer might be em-
ployed, i.e., voluntary resort to arbitration or the 
International Court of Justice (with a binding 
award), or, if neither of those options is elected, 
mandatory resort to conciliation (with a recommen-
datory award). 
O T H E R 
P R O V I S I O N S 
It would be the usual international practice to in-
clude clauses on the following topics: 
• amendment of the Convention; 
• status, adoption, and amendment of annexes; 
• adoption and entry into force of, and amend-
ments to, protocols; 
• signature; 
• ratification; 
• accession; 
• right to vote; 
• relationship between the Convention and any 
protocol(s);

A N N E X E S A N D 
P R O T O C O L S 
The negotiating parties may wish the Convention to 
provide for the possibility of annexes and/or proto-
cols. Annexes might be concluded as integral parts 
of the Convention, while protocols might be con-
cluded subsequently (as in the case of the Montreal 
Protocol to the Vienna Convention on Protection 
of the Ozone Layer). While it is recognized that the 
Convention is to be all-encompassing, the negotiat-
ing parties will have to decide whether greenhouse 
gases, their sources and sinks, are to be dealt with, 
individually, in groups, or, comprehensively, in an-
nexes or protocols to the Convention. The follow-
ing, among others, might also be considered as 
possible subjects for annexes or protocols to the 
Convention: 
• agricultural practices; 
• forest management; 
• funding mechanisms; 
• research and systematic observations; 
• energy conservation and alternative sources of 
energy; 
• liability and compensation; 
• international emissions trading; 
• international taxation system; 
• development and transfer of climate change-
related technologies. 
Issues that will arise in connection with the devel-
opment of annexes and protocols include: 
• timing, i.e., negotiating parties advocating a 
more action-oriented Convention may seek to 
include specific obligations in annexes as op-
posed to subsequent protocols and/or negotiate 
one or more protocols in parallel with the Con-
vention negotiations; 
• sequence, i.e., if there is to be a series of proto-
cols, in what order should they be taken up?

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC) was established under the auspices of the 
World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and 
the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) 
to address the need for an international organization 
that could deal with the issue of climate change. As 
summarized in W M O Executive Council resolution 
4 (EC-XL) of 1987, the organization's objectives 
are to address climate change by: 
(i) Assessing the scientific information that is 
related to the various components of the cli-
mate change issue, such as emissions of major 
greenhouse gases and modification of the 
Earth's radiation balance resulting there-
from, and that are needed to enable the envi-
ronmental and socio-economic consequences 
of climate change to be evaluated; and 
(ii) Formulating realistic response strategies for 
the management of the climate change issue. 
At the IPCC's first meeting in Geneva in November 
1988, the Panel agreed that its work included three 
main tasks: 
(i) Assessment of available scientific informa-
tion on climate change; 
(ii) Assessment of environmental and socio-
economic impacts of climate change; and 
(iii) Formulation of response strategies. 
To accomplish these tasks in the most efficient 
and expeditious manner possible, the IPCC decided 
to establish three Working Groups to deal with each 
of the tasks identified above. The IPCC agreed that 
the three working groups, on science, impacts, and 
response strategies, would be chaired, respectively, 
by the United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and United 
States. 
The latter of these Working Groups, the Re-
sponse Strategies Working Group (RSWG), held its 
first meeting in Washington in January 1989 under 
the chairmanship of Dr. Frederick M . Bernthal of 
the United States. RSWG Vice-Chairs were also 
named from Canada, China, Malta, the Nether-
lands, and Zimbabwe. At that first meeting, the 
R S W G established a Steering Committee and four 
Subgroups to carry out a work plan for formulating 
response strategies (see Figure 1.1). The RSWG 
Steering Committee was given responsibility for co-
ordinating the Working Group's activities in gen-
eral and for specifically addressing two cross-
cutting tasks: (1) the development of greenhouse gas 
emissions scenarios; and (2) the development of a 
strategy for considering implementation mecha-
nisms. The four R S W G Subgroups were tasked 
with developing a range of climate change response 
strategies in the areas of: (1) Energy and Industry; 
(2) Agriculture and Forestry; (3) Coastal Zone 
Management; and (4) Resource Use and Manage-
ment. It was agreed that the first two subgroups 
would consider measures for limiting net green-
house gas emissions from the energy, industry, ag-
riculture, and forestry sectors, and that the latter 
two subgroups would deal with measures for adapt-
ing to the impacts of climate change on coastal re-
gions and natural resources.

The RSWG Steering Committee was established to 
provide for overall coordination and direction of 
the RSWG's work. It was also agreed that the Steer-
ing Committee would undertake cross-cutting tasks 
relevant to the work of all the RSWG Subgroups or 
to the activities of the other two I P C C Working 
Groups. 
1.2.1 
EMISSIONS SCENARIOS 
At its first meeting the RSWG requested that, as its 
first task, or "Task A , " the Steering Committee 
conduct an analysis of possible future scenarios of 
global emissions of greenhouse gases. The purpose 
of these scenarios was to provide the four R S W G 
subgroups and the I P C C Science and Impacts 
Working Groups with a preliminary basis for con-
ducting long-range analyses. By April 1989 a 
United States-Netherlands team of experts devel-
oped three possible scenarios of future emissions 
corresponding to: (1) the equivalent of a C 0 2 dou-
bling from pre-industrial levels by about the year 
2030; (2) a C O a equivalent doubling by approx-
imately 2060; and (3) a doubling by about 2090 with 
stabilization thereafter. The group subsequently 
developed two additional emissions scenarios corre-
sponding to emissions projections in which atmo-
spheric concentrations of greenhouse gases are 
stabilized at a level less than a C 0 2 equivalent dou-
bling. In addition, the Steering Committee's emis-
sions projections have been complemented by more 
recent work developed by the Energy and Industry 
and Agriculture and Forestry Subgroups based on 
individual country studies of likely long-term 
greenhouse gas emissions trends. 
1.2.2 
IMPLEMENTATION MECHANISMS 
The Steering Committee's second task, or "Task 
B," was to develop a plan for identifying "imple-
mentation mechanisms," or, in other words, the 
specific means through which response strategies 
can be brought into force in an effective manner. 
The Steering Committee agreed that it would con-
sider five categories of implementation mechanism 
and named two or three countries to act as co-
coordinators for each topic area: 
• Public education and information, 
which com-
prises those mechanisms designed to stimulate 
global awareness of the climate change issue and 
possible response strategies (co-coordinators: 
United States and China). 
Introduction 
7 
• Economic (market) measures, or those mecha-
nisms that ensure that response strategies are 
designed in the most cost-effective and eco-
nomically 
viable 
manner 
possible 
(co-
coordinators: Australia and New Zealand). 
• Technology development 
and transfer, 
which 
relates both to mechanisms for promoting the 
development of new technologies to limit or 
adapt to climate change and to those that en-
courage the transfer of climate change related 
technologies internationally (co-coordinators: 
Japan and India). 
• Financial measures, or those mechanisms that 
assist in the ability of countries, in particular 
developing countries, to address climate change 
(co-coordinators: Netherlands, France, and 
Egypt). 
• Legal and institutional 
measures, which deal 
with assessing legal and institutional mecha-
nisms for addressing climate change, including 
the possible development of a framework con-
vention on climate change (co-coordinators: 
United Kingdom, Canada, and Malta). 
The RSWG held a special workshop on these 
implementation mechanisms in October 1989 in 
Geneva. The workshop was attended by forty-three 
countries and eight international organizations and 
provided an opportunity for a broad exchange of 
views on these important mechanisms for address-
ing climate change. 
1.3 
R S W G 
S U B G R O U P S 
The RSWG agreed that consideration of specific 
response strategies would be conducted by four 
subgroups in the areas of: (1) Energy and Industry; 
(2) Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Human Activ-
ities; (3) Coastal Zone Management; and (4) Re-
source Use and Management. 
The first two 
subgroups were designed to address "limitation" 
issues, e.g., measures to limit net greenhouse gas 
emissions from the energy, industry, agriculture, 
and forestry sectors. The latter two subgroups were 
set up to consider measures for adapting to the 
impacts of climate change, e.g., the impacts of sea 
level rise on coastal regions or of changing tempera-
ture and precipitation patterns on natural resources. 
1.3.1 
E N E R G Y A N D INDUSTRY 
SUBGROUP 
The Energy and Industry Subgroup (EIS), co-
chaired by Japan and China, was tasked with defin-
ing policy options for climate change response strat-
egies related to greenhouse gas emissions produced 
by energy production, conversion, and use, as well 
as emissions from industrial sources not related to 
energy use. The EIS considered energy uses in the 
industrial, transportation, and residential sectors 
that produce carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous ox-
ide, and other gases, and defined technological and 
policy options to reduce emissions of these gases. 
The EIS also developed estimates of future green-
house gas emissions from the energy and industry 
sector. 
1.3.2 
AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY, A N D 
O T H E R H U M A N ACTIVITIES 
SUBGROUP 
The Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Human Ac-
tivities Subgroup (AFOS), co-chaired by the Fed-
eral Republic of Germany and Zimbabwe, was 
given the mandate of dealing with issues related to 
the limitation of greenhouse gas emissions from the 
agriculture, forestry, and other sectors not related 
to the production or use of energy or industrial 
activities. The A F O S reviewed in particular meth-
ane emissions from livestock, rice, biomass, and 
waste sources, carbon dioxide emissions from de-
forestation or C 0 2 uptake from reforestation, and 
nitrous oxide emissions from the use of fertilizers. 
The A F O S also developed estimates of future 
greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture, for-
estry, and other sectors. 
1.3.3 
COASTAL Z O N E M A N A G E M E N T 
SUBGROUP 
The Coastal Zone Management Subgroup (CZMS), 
co-chaired by New Zealand and the Netherlands, 
was tasked with considering response strategies for 
dealing with the impacts of sea level rise and the 
increased incidence of storms and other extreme 
events on coastal regions. The C Z M S reviewed in-
formation from governments, institutions, and 
non-governmental organizations on technologies, 
8 
I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
practices, and other relevant activities for the coastal 
zone and held workshops on technologies and prac-
tices in both the Southern and Northern hemi-
spheres. Based on this work, the C Z M S developed a 
series of options for dealing with potential climate 
change impacts on coastal regions. 
1.3.4 
RESOURCE USE A N D M A N A G E M E N T 
SUBGROUP 
The Resource Use and Management 
Subgroup 
(RUMS), co-chaired by Canada, France, and India, 
was tasked with considering measures for adapting 
to the impacts of climate change on agriculture, 
fisheries, animal husbandry, water resources, for-
ests, wildlife and biological diversity, and other nat-
ural resources. The R U M S considered 
possible 
strategies for either reducing the potential negative 
impacts or taking advantage of possible positive im-
pacts of climate change on food security, water 
availability, and natural ecosystems in general. 
1.4 
O T H E R 
F A C T O R S 
In conducting its activities, the RSWG recognized 
that the task of developing response strategies was 
both complex and difficult, particularly because its 
work would depend on analyses being developed 
simultaneously in the I P C C Science and Impacts 
Working Groups. The RSWG was also faced with 
the need to complete an interim assessment report 
by the summer of 1990 to form part of the IPCC's 
first assessment report. Given these constraints, the 
RSWG agreed that it should concentrate on a short-
term (18-month) work plan that would focus on the 
following elements: 
• development and distribution of preliminary 
emissions scenarios; 
• refinement of a strategy for considering imple-
mentation mechanisms; 
• carrying out of short-term work plans of the 
four RSWG subgroups for integration into an 
overall R S W G report; and 
• development of longer-term work plans. 
The report of the Energy and Industry Subgroup 
(EIS) was so voluminous that, for space reasons, 
only the Executive Summary is included in this vol-
ume. 
This RSWG report represents the analysis it was 
considered feasible to complete in the time available 
from the first R S W G meeting in January 1989 to the 
adoption of this report by the RSWG in June 1990. 
This report identifies a wide range of possible re-
sponse strategies for limiting or adapting to climate 
change and reviews available mechanisms for imple-
menting these strategies. It is recognized, however, 
that there is considerable work to be done in further 
defining and assessing the response strategies. The 
RSWG has thus developed a work plan for the next 
18-month period and thereafter, with an emphasis 
on areas where further information is needed to de-
velop response strategies, so that future efforts can 
be directed in the most effective manner possible. 
It must also be emphasized that the RSWG's task 
is to identify and evaluate response strategies, not to 
determine which actions should be undertaken by 
the international community to deal with climate 
change. The response strategies that have been iden-
tified therefore represent options rather than rec-
ommendations. While the RSWG has sought to 
provide useful guidance for policymakers, the de-
termination of what actions should be undertaken is 
a subject for formal international negotiations. 
Finally, the RSWG, and the IPCC as a whole, 
have had to deal with the difficulties presented by 
the relatively limited participation by the interna-
tional community in some aspects of the Working 
Group's activities. The participation of centrally 
planned and developing countries, in particular, has 
not been as extensive in some of the RSWG's tech-
nical work as would be ideal for an exercise of this 
nature. The RSWG has made great efforts to in-
crease the participation of all countries, in particular 
developing countries, in its work program. This 
remains an issue that needs continued attention.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
T A S K A 
The Response Strategies Working Group (RSWG) 
of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC) formed an expert group to develop sce-
narios of future emissions of greenhouse gases. 
These scenarios are to serve as initial reference and 
guidance for the work of the subgroups of RSWG 
and as a first basis for analyses by the Science Work-
ing Group and the Impacts Working Group. 
The scenarios depict five different ways that fu-
ture emissions of greenhouse gases might evolve 
over the next century and serve to illustrate the 
types of changes that would be needed to stabilize 
emissions while continuing to allow growth and 
improvement in the standard of living. There are 
limitations regarding our ability to estimate future 
rates of population growth, economic growth, and 
technological innovation and these lend uncertainty 
to projections of greenhouse gases over long time 
horizons. Based on this analysis, carbon dioxide 
(C0 2) emissions and atmospheric concentrations in 
the years 2025 and 2075 could take the values in 
Executive Summary Table 2.1. 
Executive Summary Table 2.2 contains the future 
emissions of other greenhouse gases for the five 
scenarios. Executive Summary Figure 2.1 shows the 
impact of these emissions on atmospheric concen-
trations of C 0 2 and on the greenhouse effect in 
total. The impacts range from rapid increases in 
atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases 
throughout the next century in one scenario to de-
clines in the rate of growth in atmospheric concen-
trations eventually leading to stabilization by early 
next century in another scenario. Significant policy 
changes would be required to achieve the latter sce-
nario, although the specific costs of such policies 
have not been estimated as part of this analysis. 
The first of the scenarios, called the 2030 High 
Emissions Scenario, depicts a world in which few or 
no steps are taken to reduce emissions in response to 
concerns about greenhouse warming. Continued 
population and economic growth produces in-
creases in the use of energy and in the rate of clear-
ing of tropical forests. The Montreal Protocol comes

into effect but without strengthening and with less 
than 100 percent compliance. Fossil fuels continue 
to dominate energy supply, with coal taking a much 
larger share of energy supply in the future. Emis-
sions of greenhouse gases such as C 0 2 , C H 4 , and 
N 2 0 increase continuously throughout the next 
century with emissions of C 0 2 doubling within 
forty years. Emissions of many of the chlorofluoro-
carbons stabilize and decline due to compliance to 
the Montreal Protocol but emissions of substitutes 
such as HCFC-22 increase. These increases in emis-
sions yield increases in atmospheric concentrations 
of greenhouse gases with an equivalent greenhouse 
effect of a doubling of C 0 2 concentrations from pre-
industrial levels by 2030 and continued increase 
throughout the rest of the century. 
The second of the scenarios, called the 2060 Low 
Emissions Scenario, portrays a world in which a 
number of environmental and economic concerns 
result in steps to reduce the growth of greenhouse 
gas emissions. In this scenario, energy efficiency 
improves more rapidly due to such factors as effi-
ciency standards and technology transfer. Emission 
controls are adopted globally, reducing emissions 
of C O and N O x . The share of primary energy pro-
vided by natural gas increases. Full compliance to 
the Montreal Protocol is realized. Tropical de-
forestation is halted and a global reforestation effort 
begins. These steps reduce growth in emissions by 
50 to 75 percent and significantly slow down the 
growth in atmospheric concentrations of green-
house gases. C 0 2 emissions do not double until 
2100, but the equivalent greenhouse effect of a dou-
bling of C 0 2 concentrations over pre-industrial 
levels is achieved by 2060 and continues to grow, 
albeit at a slower rate than in the first scenario. 
The third of the scenarios, called the Control 
Policies Scenario, reflects a future where concern 
over global climate change and other environmental 
issues, such as stratospheric ozone depletion, moti-
vate steps over and above those taken in the 2060 
Low Emissions Scenario. Technological develop-
16 
I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
merit, commercialization, and government efforts 
result in rapid penetrations of renewable energy 
sources in the last half of the next century. The 
Montreal Protocol is strengthened to include a full 
phase-out of CFCs and freezes on methyl-
chloroform and carbon tetrachloride. Agricultural 
policies yield reduction in emissions of greenhouse 
gases from enteric fermentation in domestic ani-
mals, from rice paddies, and from fertilizer. As a 
result, emissions of C O a , N 2 0 , and C H 4 grow 
slowly through the middle of the next century, then 
start to decline. Emissions of C O and N O x decline 
sharply along with emissions of CFCs. These emis-
sion trends yield increases in atmospheric concen-
trations of greenhouse gases equivalent to slightly 
less than a doubling of C 0 2 from pre-industrial 
levels by 2090 with concentrations stable after 2090. 
The fourth and fifth scenarios, called the Acceler-
ated Policies Scenarios, are similar to the Control 
Policies Scenario but feature much more rapid de-
velopment and penetration of renewable energy 
sources encouraged in part by global adoption of 
carbon fees. Biomass energy represents 10 to 25 
percent of primary energy supply by 2025, depend-
ing on economic growth assumptions. The results 
of these two scenarios differ only in emissions of 
C 0 2 and primarily in the short run. In the first of 
these scenarios, carbon emissions from energy con-
tinue to increase through 2000 while total emissions 
of carbon decline, due to sequestering of carbon 
through reforestation. After 2000, carbon emissions 
from all sources decline through the end of the 
century to levels less than half those in 1985. In the 
alternative scenario, C 0 2 emissions start declining 
immediately but reach the same levels by the end of 
the next century. These emission scenarios yield 
very similar atmospheric concentrations of green-
house gases. In both scenarios, atmospheric con-
centrations of greenhouse gases continue to increase 
but stabilize by the middle of the next century at 
levels 25 percent greater than current levels but well 
below an equivalent doubling of C 0 2 over pre-
industrial levels. 
In summary, the 2030 High Emissions and 2060 
Low Emissions scenarios may be viewed as two 
different paths that global greenhouse gas emis-
sions could follow over the next several decades. 
The latter case assumes sizeable improvements in 
energy efficiency, which may only be possible with 
government action. The Control Policies and Ac-
celerated Policies scenarios require deliberate ac-
tions by governments (e.g., phasing out of CFCs, 
increasing fossil energy prices or using other mea-
sures to ensure penetration by renewables). In gen-
eral, these scenarios do not achieve the goals of 
the Toronto Conference "The Changing Atmo-
sphere—1988," which is a 20 percent reduction in 
C 0 2 emissions by early in the next century. This 
goal is achieved in the Alternative Accelerated Pol-
icy scenario submitted by the Netherlands. The 
economic implications of all of the scenarios have 
not been analyzed. 
2.1 
I N T R O D U C T I O N 
At its first meeting in Washington, D . C . , in Janu-
ary 1989, Working Group III, or the Response 
Strategies Working Group (RSWG), decided to de-
velop three global emission scenarios that would 
serve as (1) an initial reference and guidance for the 
work of the subgroups of the RSWG (Industry and 
Energy, Forestry and Agriculture, etc.), and (2) a 
first basis for the work of Working Group I (the 
Science Working Group) and Working Group II 
(the Impacts Working Group). 
An expert group developed these three scenarios 
and a draft report and presented them to the RSWG 
in May 1989. Later, at the general I P C C meeting in 
June 1989 in Nairobi, the group decided to add a 
fourth scenario that would lead to stabilization of 
greenhouse gas concentrations at C 0 2 equivalent 
levels well below the C 0 2 doubling level. In addi-
tion, Working Group I requested some changes in 
the initial three scenarios and the expert group de-
cided to provide an alternative fourth scenario that 
was quite similar to the newly adopted fourth sce-
nario, but which featured lower estimates of carbon 
dioxide emissions during the next few decades. 
This report and the accompanying Appendix rep-
resent the outcome of two experts meetings, one 
held at the National Institute for Public Health and 
Environmental Protection (RIVM) in Bilthoven, 
the Netherlands, on April 7-8, 1989, and a subse-
quent meeting held in Washington, D . C . , in De-
cember 1989. The experts meeting in April was 
attended by representatives from the U.S. Environ-
mental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA), the U.S. 
Department of Energy, the Netherlands' Ministry 
of Housing, Physical Planning and Environment 
and its research institute R I V M , the Netherlands' 
Ministry of Economic Affairs, and United King-
dom observers from Working Group I.

DEFINITION A N D USE OF SCENARIOS 
The scenarios presented in this report represent 
very different possible futures. RSWG has con-
structed these scenarios through a process of identi-
fying and estimating natural and anthropogenic 
sources of emissions, identifying the key factors 
that are likely to influence future emissions from 
these sources, making different sets of assumptions 
about how these factors may change in the future, 
and then estimating the impact of these combined 
changes on emissions. The resulting scenarios meet 
the needs of Working Group I by providing emis-
sions estimates that behave according to specifica-
tions, consistent with a world that is evolving in a 
specified and reasonable manner. 
The expert group used two alternative models to 
construct these scenarios: the Atmospheric Stabiliz-
ation Framework (ASF) developed by the U.S. 
EPA, and the Integrated Model for the Assessment 
of the Greenhouse Effect (IMAGE) developed by 
R I V M . These models provide both a structure for 
17 
18 
I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
understanding how different economic and physical 
factors influence emissions of greenhouse gases, as 
well as a means of applying different estimates of 
how these factors may change and calculating the 
effect that changes will have on future emissions. 
2.2.2 
SPECIFICATIONS OF SCENARIOS 
The scenarios of future greenhouse gas emissions 
represent vastly different views of the future and a 
wide range of changes in atmospheric concentra-
tions of greenhouse gases. One scenario depicts a 
continued rapid buildup in atmospheric concentra-
tions of greenhouse gases through the end of the 
next century, while another scenario represents a 
world where concentrations quickly stabilize. 
To account for the wide range of impacts on 
greenhouse warming from the different greenhouse 
gases the expert group used the concept of equiva-
lent CO2 
concentration 
to define the scenarios. 
Equivalent C 0 2 concentration, or the concentra-
tion equivalent to a specified atmospheric concen-
tration of C 0 2 , is defined as the concentration of 
C O z that, by itself, would produce the increase 
in direct radiative forcing produced by all of the 
greenhouse gases. Equivalent C 0 2 concentration 
is derived by first estimating the increase, over 
pre-industrial levels, in direct radiative forcing from 
all of the greenhouse gases and then calculating 
the concentration of C 0 2 that would produce the 
same increase, assuming atmospheric concentra-
tions of all other greenhouse gases stayed at pre-
industrial levels. 
The equivalent C 0 2 concentration is greater than 
the atmospheric concentration of C 0 2 as long as the 
concentrations of other gases such as methane 
(CH 4) and nitrous oxide ( N 2 0 ) are equal to or 
greater than pre-industrial levels. For example, as-
sume that atmospheric concentrations of the most 
important greenhouse gases were as follows: 
C0 2—444 parts per million (ppm), N 20—341 
parts 
per 
billion 
(ppb), 
CH 4—2510 
ppb, 
CFC-11—537 parts per trillion (ppt), CFC-12— 
1077 ppt, and HCFC-22—558 ppt. Direct radiative 
forcing from all of the greenhouse gases then would 
be about 4.0 watts/meter2 above pre-industrial 
levels, which is less than the 4.3 watts/meter2 that 
would be produced by a doubling of C 0 2 . The 
equivalent C 0 2 concentration would be 550 ppm, 
which represents slightly less than a doubling of 
C 0 2 over pre-industrial levels. 
The four emission scenarios are as follows: 
1) 2030 High 
Emissions: 
Equivalent C 0 2 con-
centrations reach a value double that of pre-
industrial atmospheric concentrations of C 0 2 
by 2030. 
2) 2060 Low Emissions: Equivalent C 0 2 concen-
trations reach a value double that of pre-
industrial atmospheric concentrations of C 0 2 
by 2060. 
3) Control Policies: Equivalent C 0 2 concentra-
tions reach a value double that of pre-
industrial atmospheric concentrations of C 0 2 
by 2090 and stabilize thereafter. 
4) Accelerated Policies: Equivalent C 0 2 concen-
trations stabilize at a level less than a doubling 
of pre-industrial atmospheric concentrations 
of C 0 2 . 
N o specifications were made as to the relative 
contribution of different greenhouse gases to the 
equivalent C 0 2 concentrations or, in the first two 
scenarios, to the pattern of concentrations after they 
doubled. The expert group also developed an Alter-
native 
Accelerated 
Policies 
Scenario. 
While 
the 
fourth scenario assumes that economic, political, 
and technological constraints would prevent any 
significant reduction in emissions in the short run, 
the alternative fourth scenario assumes a political 
climate that stresses the urgency of rapidly slowing 
down the rate of climate change, and assumes earlier 
reductions in C 0 2 emissions. 
2.2.3 
M E T H O D O L O G Y 
The methodology used to create the four emission 
scenarios incorporated two broad steps. First, the 
group designed and developed two detailed sce-
narios of future greenhouse gas emissions for each 
of the four requested emission scenarios, with the 
main difference between the two scenarios being the 
rate of economic growth. Each of the eight detailed 
scenarios represented a much different view of how 
the world might evolve and produce levels of green-
house gases that meet the scenario specifications. 
The second step involved combining, for each of the 
Emissions Scenarios 
19 
four requested emission scenarios, the two detailed 
(lower economic growth and higher economic 
growth) scenarios to create an average scenario. For 
the alternative fourth scenario (Alternative Acceler-
ated Policies) the detailed scenario assumed that 
immediate action would be taken to stabilize con-
centrations. Selected results from the eight detailed 
scenarios, the four average scenarios, and the Alter-
native Accelerated Policies Scenario are presented in 
this report. 
The design and development of the detailed emis-
sion scenarios consisted of four steps as follows : 
1) Identify emission sources and estimate current 
(1985) emissions from these sources. 
2) Identify alternative assumptions for key pa-
rameters that influence greenhouse gas emis-
sions (e.g., economic growth and energy 
efficiency). 
3) For each detailed scenario, combine assump-
tions for different parameters and implement 
the greenhouse models (ASF and/or I M A G E ) 
using these assumptions. 
4) Validate that the models produce results that 
meet the scenario specifications for each set of 
assumptions. 
For the eight detailed scenarios, the ASF was used 
to combine the input assumptions and produce esti-
mates of future emissions. The atmospheric and 
ocean models incorporated within the ASF were 
used to estimate future atmospheric concentrations 
of the greenhouse gases and the equivalent C 0 2 
concentrations in order to validate that the assump-
tions provided results consistent with the scenario 
specifications. The Dutch then reviewed the emis-
sion estimates and used I M A G E to further validate 
that the emission estimates provided the specified 
results. 
2.3 
A S S U M P T I O N S 
To develop scenarios of future emissions, certain 
assumptions must first be made about current 
sources of emissions; then additional assumptions 
must be made concerning the path of economic and 
technical change as well as the behavior of other 
factors that could influence greenhouse gas emis-
sions in the future. The analytical frameworks de-
scribed above (ASF and I M A G E ) serve primarily to 
organize these assumptions and account for their 
consequences. 
2.3.1 
C U R R E N T EMISSION SOURCES 
A great deal of uncertainty surrounds the estimates 
of many of the greenhouse gas emissions. This un-
certainty reflects a number of factors, such as poor 
or inconsistent measurements of emissions, as well 
as a lack of information on activities that cause emis-
sions, such as the area of tropical forest cleared and 
the amount of biomass burned as a result of the 
clearing. The level of uncertainty varies consider-
ably by gas and by emission source. Emissions of 
C 0 2 from the combustion of fossil fuels are esti-
mated within an error of plus or minus 10 percent 
(Marland and Rotty, 1984), while high and low 
estimates of emissions of N 2 0 from fertilizer (in-
cluding leaching) can vary by a factor of 4 (Bolle et 
al., 1986). 
Estimates of current emissions of C 0 2 from fossil 
fuel combustion and cement production are from 
Marland et al. (1988), and emissions of C 0 2 from 
tropical deforestation are from Houghton (1988). 
For 1985, these sources estimate emissions of 5.2 
petagrams of carbon (Pg C) from fossil fuel com-
bustion, 0.1 Pg C from cement manufacturing, and 
0.7 Pg C from tropical deforestation. 
The estimates of current emissions for C O , C H 4 , 
and N O x reflect the recommendations of Working 
Group I made in October 1989. Two emission 
sources for C O have been excluded: oxidation of 
man-made hydrocarbons and oxidation of natural 
hydrocarbons, since these two sources are esti-
mated endogenously in the atmospheric model 
within the ASF. Also, changes in anthropogenic 
emissions of non-methane hydrocarbons are not 
estimated. Similarly, N O x from stratospheric subsi-
dence is excluded. Table 2.1 shows the emission 
assumptions for C O , Table 2.2, the assumptions for 
C H 4 (from Cicerone and Oremland, 1988), Table 
2.3, the assumptions for N O x , and Table 2.4, the 
assumptions for N 2 0 . The estimates of N 2 0 emis-
sions reflect the need to balance recent data on emis-

0.25 percent as the estimated annual rate of growth 
in atmospheric concentrations of N 2 0 and an atmo-
spheric life of 160 years yields 12.5 teragrams of 
nitrogen (Tg N) as the estimate of N 2 0 emissions in 
1985. O f this total, an estimated 8.0 Tg N is from 
natural sources, for example, from nitrification and 
denitrification in soils and from oceans and fresh 
waters. Other emission sources include 1.0 Tg N 
from combustion of fossil fuels and 1.6 Tg N from 
fertilizer, which includes the leaching of fertilizer 
through the groundwater.

DEMOGRAPHIC, ECONOMIC, A N D 
TECHNOLOGICAL 
C H A N G E 
Key factors expected to influence future changes in 
emissions of greenhouse gases include population 
growth, economic growth, the costs of technology 
used to convert energy from one form to another, 
end-use efficiency, deforestation rates, C F C emis-
sions, and agricultural emissions. The expert group 
made different assumptions about how these factors 
may change in the future, then combined these dif-
ferent assumptions to construct the detailed emis-
sion scenarios. 
The combinations of assumptions used to con-
struct the scenarios are displayed in Table 2.5 and

IPCC RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
explained briefly below. As described earlier, two 
detailed scenarios were developed for each of the 
four requested emission scenarios, with the as-
sumptions on the future rate of economic growth 
being the main difference between the two detailed 
scenarios. In Table 2.5 "Higher Growth" refers to 
higher economic growth detailed scenario and 
"Lower Growth" refers to lower economic growth 
detailed scenario. Additional information on the 
assumptions and results of these scenarios are in-
cluded in the Appendix. 
2.3.2.1 Population 
The population estimates, taken from the World 
Bank (Zachariah and Vu, 1988), project a global 
population of 9.5 billion by 2050 and 10.4 billion by 
2100. Regional population growth assumptions are 
shown in Figure 2.1. The bulk of the increase dur-
ing the first half of the next century occurs in the 
developing countries, while population in the de-
veloped countries remains fairly stable during the 
entire period. 
2.3.2.2 
Economic Growth 
Economic growth rates (Table 2.6) were derived 
from estimates from the World Bank (1987); adjust-
ments to these estimates are described in the Appen-
dix. The overall rate of economic development is 
one of the most important determinants of future 
greenhouse gas 
emissions. 
Robust 
economic 
growth is certainly the goal of most governments, 
and other things being equal, higher levels of eco-
nomic activity would be associated with greater 
greenhouse gas emissions. In the scenarios defined 
here, for example, some regions reach a per capita 
income level of $5,000 (typical of Western Europe 
during the 1970s) by 2020 under the Higher Growth 
assumptions, but not until 2075 under the Lower 
Growth assumptions. For other regions, per capita 
income levels remain below $5,000 throughout the

narios of sustainable development in which all de-
veloping countries achieve a higher income level by 
the middle of the next century could be explored in 
future analyses. 
2.3.2.3 Energy Supply 
Four alternative assumptions on energy supply pro-
vide for a wide range of possible futures. The first 
set of assumptions, labeled Carbon-intensive, rep-
resents a pessimistic view of future non-fossil devel-
opments, where the cost of non-fossil energy 
supply technologies remains high compared to fos-
sil supplies, and/or the technical potential for these 
energy sources remains low. Fossil energy re-
sources, primarily coal, are adequate to satisfy de-
mand for energy, and synthetic fuels from coal 
become competitive early in the twenty-first cen-
tury. Under these assumptions, costs of commercial 
solar electricity remain at current levels of around 
$0.11/kwh (1988 U.S. dollars), use of nuclear en-
ergy is limited because of concerns over safety, and 
energy from commercial biomass remains low be-
cause of a combination of high development costs, 
lack of infrastructure, and competition with other 
uses for the land. 
The Gas-intensive assumptions are similar to the 
Carbon-intensive assumptions except that increased 
use of natural gas is encouraged in order to meet a 
number of environmental goals, including reducing 
C 0 2 emissions. Carbon fees of 20 to 25 percent of 
delivered prices help reduce demand for oil and coal 
and help provide price subsidies for natural gas of 
up to 15 percent. Research and development help 
accelerate reductions in gas exploration and produc-
tion costs on the order of 0.5 percent annually. 
The third set of assumptions, labeled Non-
Fossil-intensive, represents a world where techno-
logical developments result in competitive and 
abundant non-fossil energy sources, but not until 
late in the next century. Costs of commercial solar 
electricity fall to $0.06/kwh (1988 U.S. dollars) af-
ter 2050. Similarly, costs of nuclear energy fall to 
$0.055/kwh, and political and technological con-
straints inhibiting its use are relaxed. Finally, costs 
of producing large quantities of biomass energy are 
significantly reduced. 
The fourth set, labeled Early Non-Fossil-
intensive, is similar to the previous set of assump-
tions but with several key differences. 
Here, 
constraints that impede the penetration and use of 
non-fossil supplies are relaxed, and cost reductions 
are achieved, early in the twenty-first century, so 
that non-fossil energy sources can make a signifi-
cant impact by 2025. Fees based on the carbon con-
tent of fossil fuels, set at a rate equivalent to $50/ton 
on coal (1988 U.S. dollars), are phased in on a global 
scale by 2025. 
The use of the assumptions for the different emis-
sion scenarios is straightforward. The Carbon-
intensive energy supply assumptions are used to 
construct the 2030 High Emissions scenarios. The 
Gas-intensive assumptions are used for the 2060 
Low Emissions scenarios. The Non-Fossil-inten-
sive assumptions are used with the Control Policies 
scenarios, and the Early Non-Fossil-intensive as-
sumptions are used in the Accelerated Policies sce-
narios. 
2.3.2.4 Energy Demand 
Two alternative assumptions are made concerning 
future demand for energy under each set of eco-
24 
I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
nomic growth assumptions. These alternatives re-
flect both the variance in historical trends as well as 
a wide range of views as to what is possible in the 
future. The first set of these assumptions, labeled 
Moderate Efficiency, yields annual improvements 
in energy intensity (measured as primary energy use 
per dollar G N P ) of around 0.9 percent under the 
lower economic growth assumptions and 1.3 per-
cent under the higher economic growth assump-
tions. The High Efficiency assumptions 
yield 
annual improvements in energy intensity of around 
1.2 percent under lower economic growth and 1.8 
percent under the higher economic growth (with 
annual improvements from 1985 to 2025 averaging 
2.3 percent). 
2.3.2.5 CFCs and Halons 
Three sets of assumptions are made concerning fu-
ture emissions of perhalogenated hydrocarbons and 
hydrohalocarbons (including CFCs). The first of 
the assumptions, labeled Protocol/Low Compli-
ance, represents a very pessimistic view of efforts to 
further control emissions of CFCs. They include no 
strengthening of the Montreal Protocol and only 85 
percent participation by developing countries. The 
second set of assumptions, labeled Protocol/Full 
Compliance, still represents a pessimistic view, in 
that there is no strengthening of the Montreal Pro-
tocol, but all countries participate and there is 100 
percent compliance to the existing terms. The third 
set of assumptions (Phase Out) represents an opti-
mistic view of efforts to strengthen the Montreal 
Protocol; these assumptions include a complete 
phase-out of CFCs by the year 2000 and limits on 
emissions of carbon tetrachloride and methyl-
chloroform, as well as 100 percent participation in 
the strengthened agreement. In all of the above sets 
of 
assumptions, 
the substitution of H C F C s 
(HCFC-22 is used as proxy) for controlled gases 
occurs at a rate of .35 to 1. 
The use of these assumptions to construct the 
emission scenarios is also straightforward. For the 
2030 High Emissions scenarios, the Protocol/Low 
Compliance assumptions are used. The Protocol/ 
Full Compliance assumptions are used with the 
2060 Low Emissions scenarios. And the Phase Out 
assumptions are used with both the Control Policies 
and Accelerated Policies scenarios. 
2.3.2.6 Deforestation 
Three alternate sets of assumptions concerning rates 
of deforestation and reforestation provide a wide 
range of futures, from a continued increase in rates 
of deforestation to rapid cessation of deforestation 
and vigorous reforestation efforts. A l l three de-
forestation scenarios assume low initial biomass and 
1985 emissions of C 0 2 from tropical deforestation 
at around 0.7 Pg C. 
In the first set of assumptions, labeled Rapid De-
forestation, tropical deforestation increases expo-
nentially, reaching 34 million hectares (ha) per year 
by 2050, leading to complete global deforestation 
by 2075. N o efforts are made to establish tree plan-
tations or to reforest areas. 
In the second set of assumptions, labeled Moder-
ate Deforestation, tropical deforestation increases 
gradually, reaching 15 million ha per year by about 
2100, compared with 11 million ha/yr in 1985. The 
rate of establishment of tree plantations is assumed 
to be zero and no reforestation occurs. 
In the third set of assumptions, labeled Reforesta-
tion, tropical deforestation stops by 2025, while 
about 1,000 million ha is reforested by 2100. Only 
land that once supported forests and is not inten-
sively cultivated is assumed to be available for re-
forestation. Of the reforested land, 380 million ha 
are assumed to be in plantations; the rest absorbs 
carbon at a slower rate but eventually reaches a 
much higher level of biomass. 
The Rapid Deforestation assumptions were used 
for the 2030 High Emissions/Lower Growth sce-
nario. The Moderate Deforestation assumptions 
were used for the 2030 High Emissions/Higher 
Growth scenario. The Reforestation assumptions 
were used for all other scenarios. 
2.3.2.7 Agriculture 
The assumptions affecting emissions from agricul-
ture fall into two groups: (1) those that have an 
impact on consumption and production of agri-
cultural products and (2) those that might change 
the emissions attributed to a given level of agri-
cultural activity (emission coefficients). Since popu-
lation growth was the same in all scenarios, future 
activity levels for the major agricultural variables 
affecting trace gas emissions (e.g., land use for rice 
production, meat consumption, dairy consump-
Emissions Scenarios 
25 
tion, fertilizer use, etc.) did not vary among sce-
narios. 
Two separate sets of assumptions are made con-
cerning future emissions from these activities. The 
first set, labeled Current Factors, assumes that 
emissions coefficients from agricultural activities re-
main constant over time. As examples, the percent 
of N applied as fertilizer that evolves as N
2 0 would 
remain constant in the future, and C H
4 emissions 
from a single hectare of land cultivated for rice pro-
duction would also remain constant. The second set 
of assumptions (Declining Factors) has the emission 
coefficients declining 0.5 percent annually as a re-
sult of efforts to control emissions, for example, by 
changing types of fertilizer and methods of applica-
tion, by altering rice cultivation practices and rice 
cultivars, and by adopting meat and dairy produc-
tion techniques such as methane-inhibiting iono-
phores. Examples of Current Factor coefficients, 
used in the 2030 High Emissions and 2060 Low 
Emissions scenarios, are shown in Table 2.7. De-
clining Factors were used in all other Scenarios.

Combining the diverse sets of assumptions de-
scribed in the previous section in the modeling 
frameworks provides a wide range of different 
views of how the world could evolve. As described 
earlier, two alternative detailed scenarios provide 
results that are consistent with each of the four 
requested scenarios of greenhouse gas concentra-
tion buildup. The detailed scenarios were also com-
bined to create an Average Scenario for each 
requested emission profile. A n additional scenario 
provides an alternative view of how stabilization of 
greenhouse gas concentrations can be achieved. 
Table 2.8 shows the expected emissions of each gas 
from each source for each of the four average (2030 
High Emissions, 2060 Low Emissions, Control 
Policies, Accelerated Policies) scenarios and the A l -
ternative Accelerated Policies Scenario. 
Both the ASF and I M A G E were used to estimate 
changes in atmospheric concentrations of the green-
house gases in order to confirm that they met the 
specifications of the four emission scenarios. The 
results of the ASF and I M A G E were within 5 per-
cent, with variations due primarily to the use of 
different approaches to estimate atmospheric con-
centrations of the greenhouse gases and a different 
conceptual approach to the modeling of land-use 
changes. Figure 2.2 displays C O a concentrations 
and equivalent C 0 2 concentrations estimated by the 
Atmospheric Stabilization Framework for the four 
averaged scenarios and the Alternative Accelerated 
Policies Scenario along with the level of atmospheric 
C 0 2 concentrations representing a doubling of pre-
industrial concentrations. These divergent out-
comes are described in more detail below for the 
energy, forestry, and agricultural sectors.

The two most important determinants of green-
house gas emissions are the level of energy demand 
and the combination of sources that are used to 
supply that energy. The basic differences between 
the scenarios in global primary energy supplies are 
illustrated in Figures 2.3 and 2.4. The regional dif-
ferences in primary energy consumption are illus-
trated in Figures 2.5 and 2.6.

Accelerated Policies Scenario 
2.4.1.1 2030 High Emissions Scenarios 
In the 2030 High Emissions scenarios, fossil fuel 
consumption increases rapidly through the entire 
time horizon (1985 to 2100). With higher economic 
growth, primary energy supply increases from a 
1985 level of 290 EJ to 660 EJ in 2025 (an annual 
growth rate of 2.1 percent) and reaches 1680 EJ in 
2100 (an annual growth rate of 1.3 percent). O i l and 
natural gas supplies increase through 2025, then 
start to decline because of resource constraints. 
Coal becomes the dominant fuel; its share of pri-
mary energy supply rises from below 30 percent in 
1985 to over 65 percent by the end of the time 
period. By 2100, half of all coal mined is used in 
synthetic fuel production. With lower economic 
growth, primary energy demand and supply in-
crease at about half the rate seen with higher eco-
nomic growth. Primary energy supply increases to 
470 EJ by 2025 and to 730 EJ by 2100, with average 
annual rates of growth of 1.2 percent and 0.6 per-
cent, respectively. O i l and natural gas supply fol-
lows a pattern similar to that described above, and 
the share of primary energy supplied by coal in-
creases to 55 percent in 2100. 
Regional energy consumption patterns also differ 
between the two 2030 High Emissions detailed sce-
narios. Under the Higher Growth assumptions, all 
regions show an increase in primary energy con-
sumption, but the increase in developing countries 
far exceeds that in the developed countries. 
This result reflects the higher rates of economic 
growth assumed in developing countries as well as 
assumptions concerning energy use during this 
rapid development. The share of primary energy 
consumed in the developing countries increases 
from 22 percent in 1985 to over 60 percent in 2100. 
A similar pattern of regional growth is seen in the 
Lower Growth scenario, but the portion of energy 
consumed in the developing countries increases to 
only 45 percent in 2100. 
Emissions Scenarios 
31 
2.4.1.2 2060 Low Emissions Scenarios 
Reflecting the assumptions made concerning greater 
improvements in energy efficiency, the 2060 Low 
Emissions scenarios display smaller increases in pri-
mary energy supply and fossil fuel use than seen in 
the 2030 High Emissions scenarios. In addition, nat-
ural gas plays a larger role through 2025, but that role 
is reduced thereafter because of resource con-
straints. Primary energy supply reaches only 450 EJ 
in 2025 and 850 EJ in 2100 under the Higher Growth 
assumptions and 374 EJ in 2025 and 430 EJ in 2100 
under the Lower Growth assumptions. The share of 
primary energy supply provided by natural gas 
grows from 19 percent in 1985 to 23 percent in 2100 
under the Higher Growth assumptions and to 25 
percent under the Lower Growth assumptions. The 
role of coal continues to expand; coal's share of pri-
mary energy increases from 28 percent in 1985 to 54 
percent by 2100 (Higher Growth assumptions) and 
to 41 percent by 2100 (Lower Growth assumptions). 
The regional patterns are similar to those shown 
in the scenarios that assume less efficiency improve-
ment. The share of global primary energy con-
sumed in the developing world increases from 22 
percent in 1985 to over 50 percent by 2100 under the 
Higher Growth assumptions and to 45 percent by 
2100 under the Lower Growth assumptions. Again, 
these results reflect higher rate of economic growth 
assumed for developing countries. 
2.4.1.3 
Control Policies Scenarios 
The estimates of energy supply for the Control Pol-
icies scenarios are similar to those found in the 2060 
Low Emissions scenarios, except that non-fossil en-
ergy supplies start to play a larger role after 2025, 
providing over 79 percent of primary energy by 
2100 under Higher Growth assumptions and over 
62 percent of primary energy by 2100 under Lower 
Growth assumptions. Most of the increase in non-
fossil energy supplies occurs after 2050, since these 
supplies are not assumed to become competitive and 
widely available until the middle to end of the next 
century. 
2.4.1.4 Accelerated Policies Scenarios 
The Accelerated Policies scenarios provide a much 
different picture of future energy supply and de-
mand. Non-fossil energy supplies, especially com-
mercial biomass energy, play a much larger role and 
make an impact much earlier. Energy consumption 
in the scenarios is similar to the energy consumption 
in the Control Policies scenarios, except that in the 
Higher Growth scenario, energy use is slightly 
higher at mid-century because of the increased avail-
ability of biomass supplies and their lower costs. The 
share of primary energy provided by non-fossil 
sources increases from 13 percent in 1985 to 49 per-
cent in 2025 to 78 percent by 2100 with high eco-
nomic growth and to 33 percent in 2025 and 80 
percent in 2100 with low economic growth. 
Figure 2.7 shows the C 0 2 emissions from fossil 
fuels under all of the scenarios. C 0 2 emissions, 
which were 5.2 Pg C in 1985, reach levels in 2100 
ranging from 30.8 Pg C in the 2030 High Emissions/ 
Higher Growth scenario to 1.9 Pg C in the Acceler-
ated Policies/Lower Growth scenario. Emissions of 
C 0 2 from combustion of fossil fuels in the Alterna-
tive Accelerated Policies scenario decline imme-
diately and continue to decline through 2100. This 
result differs from the other Stabilization scenarios 
(Higher Growth, Lower Growth, and Average), in 
which global emissions of C 0 2 from fossil fuels 
grow through the year 2000 and then start to decline. 
2.4.2 
FORESTRY 
SECTOR 
As shown in Figure 2.8, net emissions of C 0 2 from 
tropical deforestation and reforestation varied con-
siderably between the 2030 High Emissions sce-
nario and all other scenarios. 
2.4.2.1 2030 High Emissions Scenarios 
In the 2030 High Emissions/Lower Growth sce-
nario, future C 0 2 emissions closely follow the rap-
idly increasing rate of land clearing assumed in the 
scenario. Emissions peak at over 2 Pg C/yr around 
the year 2050, with a total flux from the biosphere 
to the atmosphere of about 140 Pg C between 1985 
and 2100. 
In the 2030 High Emissions/Higher Growth sce-
nario, emissions of C 0 2 grow at a slower rate be-
cause a slower rate of land clearing is assumed. C 0 2 
emissions are spread out over a longer period, 
reaching a peak of slightly over 1 Pg C near the end 
of the century, with total flux of carbon over the 
time period at 120 Pg C.

production increases by about 120 percent. Satis-
fying the demands of increasing populations with a 
finite amount of land requires more intensive culti-
vation, increasing fertilizer use by 160 percent. 
2.4.3.1 2030 High Emissions and 2060 Low 
Emissions Scenarios 
Emissions of C H 4 and N 2 0 in the 2030 High Emis-
sions and 2060 Low Emissions scenarios increase 
proportionately with agricultural activities. C H 4 
from rice production increases 45 percent, and from 
enteric fermentation, 125 percent. N
2 0 from fertil-
izer use increases 155 percent by 2100. 
2.4.3.2 
Control Policies and Accelerated 
Policies Scenarios 
By 2100, emissions of C H 4 and N 2 0 are roughly 45 
percent lower in the Control Policies and Acceler-
ated Policies scenarios owing to the assumed decline 
in emission coefficients. 
2.4.2.2 2060 Low Emissions, Control Policies, 
and Accelerated Policies Scenarios 
All of the other scenarios use the Reforestation as-
sumptions, which yield a total release of carbon 
from deforestation of 10 Pg C, but a total accumula-
tion of carbon from reforestation of 35 Pg C be-
tween 1985 and 2100. Therefore, net accumulation 
over the period is 25 Pg C, with annual accumula-
tion peaking at about 0.7 Pg C before 2025. 
Because of differences in modeling approaches 
and in input assumptions it is difficult to compare 
the results of the ASF to the results from I M A G E 
from land-use change. The results from I M A G E are 
more pessimistic and tend to yield greater net emis-
sions of C 0 2 . 
2.4.3 
AGRICULTURAL 
SECTOR 
The land area used for rice production increases by 
nearly 45 percent between 1985 and 2100. As a 
result of increased population and income, demand 
for animal protein rises: between 1985 and 2100, 
dairy production increases by 135 percent and meat

ECONOMIC GOALS A N D EMISSIONS 
At the May meeting of RSWG in Geneva, the Japa-
nese delegation suggested that the implications of 
different C 0
2 pathways be shown by estimating 
and graphing three parameters for each scenario: 
G N P , Energy/GNP, C0 2/Energy. These values 
for all nine scenarios are presented in Figures 2.9, 
2.10, and 2.11; Figure 2.9 shows global G N P , Fig-
ure 2.10, energy/GNP, and Figure 2.11, C0 2/unit 
energy. Although the scenarios are believed to be 
technically feasible, the economic implications of 
these changes should be explored in the national 
analyses being performed by participating countries 
in RSWG. Also, it should be noted that the assumed 
levels of long run economic growth may not repre-
sent accurate measures of human welfare, especially 
in the developed countries. 
The scenarios illustrate the possible potential 
growth in emissions from developing countries and 
highlight the importance of addressing the causes 
for this growth in global strategies to limit emis-

sions. The higher rates of economic growth as-
sumed for the developing countries account for 
much of the emission growth, and efforts to limit 
emissions and maintain economic growth could re-
quire both technology transfer and financial assis-
tance from developed countries. 
2.5.2 
THERE A R E M A N Y WAYS 
TO G E T THERE 
The alternative societal, economic, policy, and 
technological paths incorporated in the scenarios do 
not cover the infinite variety of ways the future may 
unfold. At every step in the development of sce-
narios, trade-offs had to be made. It is possible to 
construct emission scenarios that would result in 
similar equivalent C 0 2 concentrations assuming ei-
ther high or low rates of economic growth, a high 
percentage of C 0 2 emissions, or a high percentage 
of emissions of other greenhouse gases, that energy 
intensity reductions (due to technological change) 
increase end-use energy efficiency, that non-fossil 
energy supplies (e.g., renewable or nuclear) are sub-
stituted for fossil fuels, and that lifestyle changes 
alter the composition of final demand. Alternative 
scenarios could have been constructed with greater 
emphasis on the role of such factors as the amounts 
and modes of travel, the size of buildings, and the 
composition of industrial and agricultural output, 
for example. 
While the assumed rate of economic growth is 
one of the most powerful determinants of the rate of 
greenhouse gas emissions, it is by no means the only 
determinant. Other important factors can poten-
tially offset the association between higher eco-
nomic growth and higher rates of greenhouse gas 
emissions. For example, a higher rate of economic 
growth makes it possible for capital stocks (e.g., 
power plants, factories, housing) to be refurbished 
or replaced more quickly, and makes the accelerated 
penetration of advanced technologies possible. Sim-
ilarly, under slow economic growth an increase in 
deforestation may be more likely because of a lack 
of other economic opportunities. The alternative 
scenarios were constructed with these factors in 
mind. 
Other greenhouse gas emissions could prove 
more important than indicated in the scenarios here. 
For example, higher anthropogenic emissions rates 
for C O and N 2 0 , still within the bounds of current 
scientific understanding, could have been assumed. 
Similarly, less optimistic assumptions about the 
ability to reduce emissions of C O , C H 4 , and N O x 
would have resulted in higher emissions of these 
gases, which would require greater reductions of 
greenhouse gases emissions from other sources in 
order to meet an equivalent C 0 2 concentration 
target. 
Less optimistic assumptions about the feasibility 
and impact of reforestation policies could also in-
crease the need to reduce emissions of greenhouse 
gases from other sources in order to maintain equiv-
alent C 0 2 concentrations below stated goals. Sim-
Emissions Scenarios 
39 
ilarly, if the competition for land—for agricultural 
use, biomass production, reforestation, and forest 
conservation—were to drive up costs faster than 
assumed in these scenarios, biomass production 
would decline and C 0 2 emissions would be higher. 
This would require stronger emission reduction ef-
forts in other areas, for example, in increased energy 
efficiency. 
2.5.3 
REFERENCE TO O T H E R STUDIES A N D 
PROPOSALS 
The expert group responded only to the criteria 
established by Working Group I and R S W G to 
construct the reference scenarios. Other studies 
have suggested alternatives. Conclusions reached 
by the Bellagio Workshop (Jaeger, 1988) suggested 
that an ecological goal of a 0.1 degree C temperature 
increase per decade might be desirable. The Brunt-
land Commission emphasized the need for sustain-
able development and mentioned the desirability of 
a 50 percent reduction in primary energy consump-
tion in industrialized countries by 2030, and the 
Toronto 
Conference, "The 
Changing 
Atmo-
sphere—1988," suggested additional short-term 
emission reduction goals. The expert group did not 
attempt to analyze these alternatives. It should be 
noted that for the Accelerated Policies scenarios, 
primary energy use in industrialized countries stays 
relatively flat through 2025, as do global C 0 2 emis-
sions from the commercial energy sector. In the 
future it may be desirable to compare the results of 
these global analyses with results from studies using 
national models that can evaluate future emissions 
scenarios in greater detail. 
2.5.4 
TIME PROFILE OF EMISSIONS 
The expert group recognized that emissions and 
concentrations in the future are not only a function 
of factors such as economic growth and technologi-
cal change, but also of when measures to reduce 
emissions are adopted. To explore this issue, a pre-
liminary sensitivity analysis was undertaken using 
I M A G E . In this analysis stable atmospheric con-
centrations equivalent to a doubling of C 0 2 by the 
year 2090 were used as a target. The simulations 
utilized the emissions estimates from the 2030 High 
Emissions (Average) scenario, but modified the 
emissions at different points in time (2000, 2010, 
2020, and 2030) in order to achieve the goal of 
keeping greenhouse gas concentrations from dou-
bling. In all cases, C 0 2 emissions have to decline in 
order to achieve stable concentrations at the 
2xC0 2-equivalent level in 2090, but Figures 2.12 
and 2.13 clearly show that emissions would have to 
be curtailed sharply if the emissions reduction mea-
sures are delayed until a later date. For example, if 
emissions reduction measures are begun in 2000, a 
gradual 17 percent reduction in C 0 2 emissions 
(from 2000 levels) is sufficient to meet the targeted 
concentrations. If measures are not implemented 
until 2020, however, the model calculates that a 
reduction of 60 percent (from 2020 levels) is neces-
sary to achieve the targets.

T H E ESTABLISHMENT OF T H E 
ENERGY A N D INDUSTRY SUBGROUP 
The Energy and Industry Subgroup (EIS) was estab-
lished at the first session of the Response Strategies 
Working Group (RSWG) and held its own first ses-
sion on that occasion. Membership is open to all 
countries participating in the IPCC. As of March 
1990, 26 countries have participated in the work of 
EIS together with eight international organizations 
and 29 non-governmental organizations (as ob-
servers). Representatives of Japan and the People's 
Republic of China were appointed as Co-Chairmen, 
and a representative of Canada as rapporteur. Mem-
bership grew in pace with the growing awareness of 
the significance of the issues involved. 
3.1.2 
TERMS OF REFERENCE 
The EIS was charged with defining "policy options 
for national, regional and international responses to 
the possibility of climate change from greenhouse 
gas emissions produced by energy production, con-
version and use." In doing so, the EIS was to con-
sider greenhouse gases (GHGs), primarily carbon 
dioxide (C0 2), methane (CH 4), and nitrous oxide 
(N 20) and "define technology and policy options 
to attempt to reduce emissions of these gases to a 
level consistent with, or below, emission scenarios 
defined by the Steering Group (of R S W G ) . " It was 
to concentrate on options which could be ade-
quately assessed within eighteen months and also 
consider those that may require a longer time frame. 
The mandate also emphasized the necessity of con-
sidering the social, economic and environmental 
implications of technology and policy options on 
national, regional and international levels. 
The EIS was originally given the following five 
tasks: 
Task 1 Review past and current work on tech-
nology and policies related to GHGs. 
Task 2 Select appropriate analytical tools for as-
sessing social, economic, and emission 
level implications of policy options. 
Task 3 Categorize options by the timing of their 
potential application. 
Task 4 Analyze nearer-term options for their 
economic, social, and emission reduction 
implications and prepare a report for the 
RSWG. 
Task 5 Prepare a plan to define and further de-
velop and analyze longer-term options 
based on the information derived from 
Task 1. 
Subsequently, the IPCC at its Third Plenary 
asked the EIS to conduct analyses related to the re-
mits from the Ministerial Conference in Noordwijk, 
Netherlands in November 1989, particularly with 
regard to the feasibility of alternative emission tar-
gets. 
Although the issues fell within its original man-
date, it was agreed that these new, specific tasks 
would require more time, data, and analysis in order 
to be dealt with properly. It was decided, therefore, 
that the results of the deliberations of the EIS on 
these remits could not be fully included in this report 
but only treated in an incomplete and preliminary 
way. A progress report would be presented to the 
fourth I P C C Plenary following an international 
workshop to be hosted by the United Kingdom in 
June 1990. 
3.1.3 
T H E ACTIVITIES U N D E R T A K E N

occasions to discuss the tasks stated above. A series

of expert group meetings was held to discuss various 
issues concerning methodological tools and analyti-
cal approaches. There was a general consensus that 
no single approach would be adequate. A combina-
tion of modeling and non-modeling approaches was 
suggested. A hybrid approach was taken by which 
"bottom-up" national approaches would be com-
bined with "top-down" global approaches to pro-
duce integrated assessments in order to exploit the 
advantages of both approaches. The issue of cost-
effectiveness analysis was identified as one of the 
areas of future work. 
It was decided to limit the scope of the EIS anal-
ysis to carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and methane 
emissions from the energy and industry sectors (in-
cluding transportation and waste management). 
Emissions estimates for these G H G s were made, 
but additional future analysis of emission scenarios 
would be useful for evaluating response strategies in 
the energy and industrial sectors.

presented to the I P C C by experts. These studies are 
Energy and Industry 
51 
preliminary and not necessarily official government 
positions. 
Individual national case studies, to be based in 
part on IEA oil price scenarios, were solicited. 
These studies, often drawn from work conducted 
for domestic policy purposes, were submitted by 
national delegations. A l l but one were for indus-
trialized market economies. Only Canada, the Fed-
eral Republic of Germany, the Netherlands, 
France, Japan, the United Kingdom and Switzer-
land examined response options. Only the Nether-
lands, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom 
included some assessment of costs. Furthermore, 
the national case studies often differed with respect 
to time frame, assumptions, and other factors. 
The national case studies were supported by addi-
tional materials submitted to EIS. These included: a 
regional study by the Commission of the European 
Communities; a global/regional study from the 
IEA; a joint comparative study of their members 
from the IEA and O E C D and a technical analysis of 
the potential of nuclear power by the International 
Atomic Energy Agency and ten independent 
studies of developing and Eastern European coun-
tries commissioned by the U.S. E P A . Response 
Options studies were included for China, Brazil, 
India, Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, Mexico, 
Venezuela, the USSR and Poland. Other valuable 
contributions 
were 
received 
from 
all 
EIS 
participants—for example, the R S W G Task A 
emission scenarios. 
In total, the countries for which studies were 
received by EIS accounted for around 80 percent of 
global C 0 2 emissions. 
3.1.5 
T H E N A T U R E OF T H E REPORT 
This report represents only a first tentative step 
toward the goal of identifying the paths and strate-
gies needed to ensure that energy and industry re-
lated greenhouse gas emissions are compatible with 
the concept of sustainable development. Such strat-
egies should be economically efficient and compati-
ble with other policy goals. 
As discussed above, the report relies on various 
materials submitted to the EIS. However, their cov-
erage in terms of all greenhouse gases and regions 
remains short of producing consistent global anal-
ysis. Adequate data were not available on the emis-
sions of greenhouse gases at all stages of the fuel 
cycle and no methodology was available to compare 
the effects of various gases on a standard basis, (e.g., 
C 0 2 equivalence). The report therefore puts a 
heavy emphasis on C 0 2 , for which there were the 
most definitive data. Further, most of the country 
case studies submitted pertain to reference cases, 
rather than policy options, and thus little material 
was available on the socio-economic consequences 
of emission controls. 
Two broad conclusions are supported by the na-
tional case studies from which the EIS reference 
scenario is drawn: 
• First, the nature of the problem varies signifi-
cantly depending on each country's economic 
structure, the situation of its energy sector, and 
its stage of development. The national case 
studies showed that economic growth and re-
ductions from the reference case in the growth 
of greenhouse gases can co-exist and that poli-
cies and technologies can make a substantial 
contribution to limiting G H G s . 
• Second, there is no single quick-fix technologi-
cal option; improving efficiency on both the 
demand and supply side should be a priority; 
technological solutions must be cost effective; 
non-economic barriers to diffusion of attractive 
technologies were a fruitful area for further 
analysis; and technological research and devel-
opment was a prime area for international co-
operation. Overall, there was a consistent 
emphasis on energy efficiency and conserva-
tion.

pogenic sources in the 1980s. The major greenhouse 
gases produced by the energy sector include C O a 
and C H 4 from combustion of fossil fuels and C H 4 
from coal mines and oil and gas facilities. In 1985, 
approximately 5.3 billion tonnes of C 0
2 as carbon 
(BTC) were released from fossil fuel combustion, 
and 50-95 million tonnes (MT) of C H 4 were re-
leased due to fossil fuel production and consump-
tion. Another source of greenhouse gas emissions is 
solid waste landfill, which produces C H 4 . Addi-
tionally, biomass burning for heating and cooking 
produces C H 4 and when not based on sustainable 
resources will produce net C 0
2 emissions. Nitrous 
oxide, another important greenhouse gas, is also 
released from the energy sector, but the exact con-
tribution is uncertain. 
Other gases that contribute indirectly to green-
house gas concentrations include C O , N O x , and 
N M H C (non-methane hydrocarbons). Comparing 
relative contributions to radiative forcing across the 
various gases is complicated and dependent on a 
number of key assumptions, particularly time hori-
zon. The relative importance of current emissions 
of different gases varies considerably depending on 
the time horizon over which the contribution to 
radiative forcing is considered. These differences 
are due to the significant differences in the average 
atmospheric lifetimes of the radiatively important 
gases. However, integration over longer time hori-
zons tends to increase the importance of energy as a 
source category. 
Table 3.7 on page 68 shows the current contribu-
tion to radiative forcing from all sources and from 
the energy sector. 
During the period 1950-1985, global energy con-
sumption in total and per capita from fossil fuel in-
creased by nearly a factor of four, while C 0
2 
emissions increased from 1.5 to 5.3 BTC, or nearly 
3.5 times. During this time the liquid fuel share in-
creased from 31 to 45 percent, the coal share declined 
from 60 to 33 percent, and natural gas increased from 
9 to 22 percent. See Figures 3.1 and 3.2.

The historical growth in energy consumption and 
C 0 2 emissions differs by region of the world (for 
per capita carbon emission, see Figure 3.3). For 
example: 
• Fossil fuel energy use in developed market 
economies grew by 4 percent per year for the 
period 1950-1970. From 1970 to 1985 fossil 
energy consumption increased by an amount 
equal to only a 0.4 percent per year average 
growth rate. This was due to slow economic 
growth and energy price increases that acceler-
ated structural changes and other shifts in en-
ergy use and production. Over the entire period 
1950-1985, the average annual rate of growth in 
fossil energy use was 2.6 percent. Annual C 0 2 
emissions from these countries accounted for 
approximately 2.5 B T C in 1985 and on a per 
capita basis was 2.95 T C per person (down 
slightly from 3.1 T C per person in 1970). 
• Fossil fuel energy use in centrally planned East-
ern Europe and the USSR increased steadily

about 300 to 1400 M T C , while on a per capita 
basis emissions were nearly 3.3 T C per person. 
• Fossil fuel energy growth in the centrally

dramatically from about 1 exajoule to over 23

57 
exajoules, a growth rate of 9.8 percent per year. 
C 0 2 emissions increased from around 20 M T C 
to over 500 M T C during this period, but on a 
per capita basis emissions were only 0.5 T C per 
person or roughly one sixth of developed coun-
try levels. 
• Energy consumption in the developing market 
economies grew at an average rate of 5.7 percent 
per year, or by sevenfold, during the period 
1950-1985 (from about 5 to 35 exajoules) even 
during the period of rapidly increasing oil 
prices. Total C 0 2 emissions reached about 700 
M T in 1985 but on a per capita basis were only 
0.3 T C per person. 
The historical growth in methane emissions also 
differs by region of the world, but is much more 
difficult to evaluate because of the lack of historical 
data.

The broad determinants of energy use that will af-
fect greenhouse gas emissions: 
• The population level of the country is an impor-
tant determinant of overall energy require-
ments. Generally, countries with rapid popu-
lation growth rates are likely to experience high 
growth rates in energy use. 
• The level and structure of economic activity, 
often measured by annual income or product 
flows as gross domestic product (GDP). The 
energy intensity of the economy is measured by 
the amount of energy used per unit of aggregate 
income or product. The amount of energy used 
to create G D P depends on a number of factors, 
including the composition of economic activity 
between more or less energy intensive indus-
tries or sectors, climate, transportation dis-
tances, energy efficiency, etc. The energy 
efficiency of the economy is affected by the 
technologies used to produce goods and ser-
vices. Management practices, behavioral atti-
tudes and infrastructure also affect energy effi-
ciency. 
• The carbon intensity of energy facilities influ-
ences G H G emissions. Carbon intensity re-
flects the mix of fossil fuels used in the 
economy, the proportion of total energy re-
quirements met through non-fossil energy such 
as nuclear and hydroelectric power, and the 
methods of resource production, distribution, 
transmission, and conversion. 
Future levels of emissions are difficult to predict 
because of the inherent uncertainties in these and 
other factors, such as the introduction of new tech-
nologies. Therefore, scenarios of future emissions 
are necessary for assessing climate trends. The un-
certainty surrounding such scenarios increases rap-
idly (and their usefulness decreases) as they are 
projected further into the future. Policy options 
need to be tested and costs assessed, therefore, 
against a range of possible future scenarios. This did 
not prove possible in the time available for produc-
tion of this interim report.

data submitted to EIS. It broadly reflects current 
trends but includes some limited measure of re-
sponse to the climate change issue. Figure 3.5a on 
page 60 shows this scenario along with others pro-
duced by the IEA, E C , and W E C .

REFERENCE SCENARIO 
The EIS Reference Scenario portrays a future 
where, in the absence of further policy measures, 
energy use and C 0 2 emissions grow rapidly to over 
9 B T C by 2010 and over 12 B T C by 2025. Global 
emissions rise faster than those in the high emission 
scenario provided by the RSWG Task A Group (see 
Figure 3.5a). Table 3.5 on page 59 shows that eco-
nomic growth and the rate of improvement in en-
ergy intensity are modest at 3.0 percent and 0.8 
percent a year respectively. Table 3.1 reveals that 
primary energy demand more than doubles be-

tween 1985 and 2025, reaching 777 EJ at the end of 
the period, an average annual growth rate of 2.2 
percent. 
The average annual rate of growth in C 0 2 emis-
sions over the period 1985-2025 varies from 0.8 
percent in Western Europe to 3.6 percent in devel-
oping countries with 1.4 percent in North America 
and Pacific O E C D countries. Overall the share of 
emissions from O E C D countries declines from 48 
percent in 1985 to 43 percent in 2000 and to 33 
percent in 2025, and the share attributable to East-
ern Europe declines from 26 percent to 24 percent in 
2000 and to 22 percent in 2025. Meanwhile, emis-
sions from developing countries rise from 26 per-
cent in 1985 to 32 percent in 2000 and to 44 percent 
in 2025. Under this scenario, the per capita emis-
sions in the developed countries increase from 3.2 
T C per capita to 4.5 T C per capita in 2025. For the 
developing countries the per capita emissions rise 
from 0.4 T C per capita in 1985 to 0.8 T C per capita 
in 2025. 
The estimated global growth in C 0 2 emissions is 
higher than the high emission scenario provided by 
RSWG to WG1. Figure 3.5b on page 61 shows the 
1990-2025 emissions from the O E C D countries 
and global totals, in the EIS Reference scenarios and 
in selected R S W G Task A scenarios. The High 
Emissions Scenario envisages that equivalent C 0 2 
concentrations reach a value double that of pre-
industrial atmospheric concentrations of C O a by 
2030. The Accelerated Policies Scenario represents 
the largest 
emissions 
reduction projected by 
RSWG. Equivalent C 0 2 concentrations in this sce-
nario stabilize at a level less than double the pre-
industrial atmospheric concentrations of C 0 2 . A 
line which represents a reduction to a level 20 per-
cent below 1988 emission levels is also shown. 
3.3.3 
FUTURE M E T H A N E EMISSIONS 
Methane is emitted from coal mining, oil and natu-
ral gas systems, and waste management systems 
(i.e., landfills, wastewater treatment facilities). 
Growth in these emissions is highly dependent 
upon population and economic growth. Using the 
same assumptions as described above, methane 
emissions from these sources may increase by 85 
percent by 2010 and 163 percent by 2025. Individu-
ally, emissions from coal mining may increase by 93 
percent by 2010 and 186 percent by 2025; methane 
emissions from oil and natural gas systems by simi-
lar percent changes; and methane emissions from 
landfills by 50 percent by 2010 and 100 percent by 
2025. 
It should be noted that the future estimates of 
methane emissions from coal mining may be under-
stated. It is likely that as developing countries inten-
sify their coal mining activities to meet rapidly 
increasing demand for energy, they will mine more 
coal and coal that is deeper and more gaseous.

Table 3.4 summarizes the emission levels in the EIS 
Reference Scenario and illustrates possible alterna-
tive emission levels. It shows that stabilizing emis-
sions at current levels poses a global policy 
challenge and that the capacity of regions to reduce 
emission levels varies greatly. Stabilizing emissions 
globally at 1985 levels would require reductions

below the levels estimated in the Reference Scenario 
of 29 percent by 2000 and 43 percent by 2010. Table 
3.5 summarizes trends in economic growth, energy 
intensity, and carbon intensity for the period 1985— 
2025. 
A 20 percent reduction of emissions below esti-
mated 1990 levels by 2025 is a much more signifi-
cant policy challenge. Table 3.4 shows that, if 
implemented globally, it would require a 67 percent 
reduction (reduce 8.29 B T C from 12.4 BTC) from 
the reference emission levels in 2025.

There are a number of technical options available to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions and policy mea-
sures to implement them. We define technical op-
tions to include not only the installation of new 
capital stock with lower emission characteristics (or 
the modification of existing stock) but also the man-
agerial and behavioral changes which can reduce 
future emissions. Policy measures are the actions, 
procedures, and instruments that 
governments 
adopt to bring about additional or accelerated up-
take of the technical measures beyond that in a 
reference scenario. 
When analyzing the costs and benefits of alterna-
tive response strategies, a systematic approach is 
needed that identifies the overall effect not only of 
the technical options but also of the policy measures 
needed to bring them about. This task must take 
into account the international nature of energy mar-
kets as well as the individual characteristics of na-
tional economies. EIS has not, therefore, been able 
to complete such an analysis but some example re-
source costing was included in some of the national 
case studies submitted to EIS.

of management techniques, and structural or behav-
ioral change that could limit C 0 2 emissions, a wide 
range of factors must be considered. These include: 
• technical, economic and market potential of 
technologies; 
• development status and time scale for imple-
mentation of technologies; 
• implications for other G H G s ; 
• interaction between measures; 
• resource costs and private costs; 
• macroeconomic and microeconomic effects; 
• implications for other policy goals, and social 
consequences; 
• policy robustness; 
• political and public acceptability, effectiveness, 
limitations, and effect of policy instruments. 
Understanding the distinction between technical, 
economic, and market potential is important for 
developing realistic response strategies. The techni-
cal potential of an energy technology is its capacity 
to reduce potential greenhouse gas emissions, irre-
60 
I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
spective of the costs involved. This capacity is 
largely a function of technical feasibility and re-
source availability. 
However, the economic potential may be signifi-
cantly less. This occurs where there are positive 
resource costs when evaluated at social discount 
rates—allowing for second round effects. The in-
clusion, where possible, of the economic benefits of 
emission reduction might also influence the eco-
nomic potential of measures. Finally, the market 
potential might be even less, due to market imper-
fections and the use of higher discount rates by 
private sector decision makers. Attitudes to risk and 
the presence of non-monetary costs will also be 
major influences. 
The challenge for policymakers is to enhance the 
market uptake of appropriate options taking full 
account of all the interactions, second round effects, 
costs, and benefits.

TECHNICAL OPTIONS 
The most relevant categories of technologies to re-
duce greenhouse gas emissions from energy sys-
tems are: 
• efficiency improvements and conservation in 
energy supply, conversion, and end-use; 
• fuel substitution by energy sources that have 
lower or no greenhouse gas emissions; 
• reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by re-
moval, recirculation, or fixation; and 
• management and behavioral changes (e.g., in-
creased work in homes through information 
technology) and structural changes (e.g., modal 
shift in transport). 
To fully understand their present and future po-
tential and the types of actions that might be taken 
to enhance their potential, technologies and con-
sumer or producer actions must be viewed in terms 
of the time frame in which they can be effective. 
Changes in management and behavior that lead to 
energy conservation and emissions reduction can 
begin now. Many technologies are available now, 
whereas others need further development to lower 
costs or to improve their environmental characteris-

tics. Tables 3.2 and 3.3 provide examples of tech-
nologies within each of the broad categories defined 
above, and their possible application in the short-
and medium- or long-term time frame. 
This distinction on time frame is suggested in 
order to comprehend the remaining technological 
needs of each category and to formulate a techno-
logical strategy. First-wave or near-term technolo-
gies are those that are or will be ready for 
introduction 
and/or 
demonstration by 2005. 
Second-wave technologies are available, but not yet 
clearly economic and thus would mainly be imple-
mented in the medium-term time frame of 2005 to 
2030. They could be introduced sooner if they were 
close to economic or particularly beneficial to the 
environment. Third-wave technologies are not yet 
available but may emerge in the long term or post 
2030 as a result of research and development. 
The technical, economic, and market potential of 
cross-cutting technological options will vary, de-
pending upon the sector in which they are to be 
applied. Cross-cutting technologies include those 
for energy efficiency and conservation, natural gas 
fuel use, renewable energy, other non-fossil fuels, 
and energy storage. For this reason, the specific 
technological options within the three broad cate-
gories listed above are analyzed by sector. There is 
in general extensive information and data available 
on the technical potential of the many technological 
options. However, the economic and market po-
tential of the options depends on specific circum-
stances (national, local, and even sectoral) in which 
the option is to be applied. Therefore, no figures for 
these potentials are provided. Rather, it is left to the 
country case studies to analyze economic and mar-
ket potential of options in the context of national 
circumstances. 
For management and behavioral changes regard-
ing technologies in the first-wave stage as described 
above, the advisability of applying policy measures 
to accelerate their implementation should be deter-
mined. A phased approach to technology develop-
ment and introduction into the market is offered as 
an important strategy to be considered for con-
certed national and international collaborative 
action. Near-term technological potential of parti-
cular relevance to the developed world is discussed 
by sector below. Technological potential for devel-
oping countries has not been developed in the same 
detail due to a lack of information.

3.5.3 
TRANSPORTATION 
SECTOR 
Substantial technical potential exists for fuel substi-
tution through the use of fuels derived from natural 
gas and of ethanol or other fuels derived from bio-
mass. Substantial technical potential also exists for 
electric or hydrogen-fueled vehicles, which could 
also reduce emissions with appropriate primary en-
ergy sources. Presently, the economic and market 
potentials of most of these options are very low 
because petroleum fuels are relatively cheap, alter-
native non-C0 2-producing fuels 
are relatively 
costly, and some alternative vehicular technologies 
have performance drawbacks. The technical poten-
tial for vehicle efficiency improvements is very high 
despite the substantial improvements already made. 
Economic and market potentials are constrained by 
replacement rates of vehicles, consumer demand 
and preference for larger, more powerful and 
better-equipped cars, and higher incremental costs. 
Improved driver behavior, vehicle maintenance, 
traffic management, and promotion of public trans-
portation could also reduce C 0 2 emissions. 
3.5.4 
BUILDINGS SECTOR 
The technical potential for energy efficiency gains in 
the residential and commercial sectors is also sub-
stantial. Space conditioning energy requirements in 
new homes could be roughly half of the current 
average for new homes. The technical potential for 
retrofits could average 25 percent. Reductions of 
energy use in existing commercial buildings by at 
least 50 percent may be technically feasible, and new 
commercial buildings could be up to 75 percent 
more efficient than existing commercial buildings. 
However, market potential is lower and depends on 
the replacement rate. The realization of significant 
gains in this sector requires the involvement of gov-
ernment, the many concerned institutions, and ulti-
mately the individual residential or commercial 
consumers. This sector therefore requires special 
efforts in order to achieve desired levels of market 
penetration of energy efficient technologies. For 
these technologies to achieve their market potential, 
institutional barriers must be removed and careful 
attention given to the design of R & D programmes

for this sector. Improved operation and mainte-

usually occurs in this sector only when there are 
equipment replacements and a source exists for the 
alternative, more competitive fuel. Therefore, the 
possibilities in the sector include decreasing coal 
and oil use for heating and substituting natural gas 
use or district heating applications. However, con-
sumers and firms in existing structures may find the 
infrastructure unavailable or highly expensive even 
if the fuel itself is cost-competitive. 
3.5.5 
INDUSTRY 
SECTOR 
The technical potential for efficiency improvements 
in the industry sector ranges from 13 percent in 
some sub-sectors to over 40 percent in others. The 
most dramatic efficiency improvements over the 
last 15 years have been in the energy-intensive in-
dustries. Technical options exist for accelerating 
this trend and for achieving similar savings in other 
industries. Such options stem mainly from recent 
improvements in process technologies, as well as 
better design and materials. Considerable oppor-
tunities for energy savings also exist in the industrial 
sector by the recycling of energy-intensive waste. 
There may also be significant potential for reducing 
greenhouse 
emissions 
through industrial fuel 
switching, especially as many industrial boilers are 
already dual-fuel capable, with natural gas being the 
fuel typically substituted for fuel oil under present 
circumstances. Combined heat and power, cogen-
eration, combustion of biomass wastes, methane 
from landfill, and other renewable energy sources 
also have potential. 
The technical potential for methane recovery and 
reduction exists in solid waste landfills (through gas 
recovery, flaring, and incineration), oil and natural 
gas production, gas transmission and distribution 
systems, and underground coal mines. 
3.5.6

The technical potential for greater efficiency in gen-
eration is in the range of 15 to 20 percent. Fuel 
substitution could achieve C 0 2 reduction in C 0 2 
emissions from electrical generation in the range of 
30 percent (from oil to natural gas) to 100 percent 
(from fossil fuel to non-fossil fuel). The electricity 
sector has a potential to substantially increase its 
efficiency where cogeneration of electricity and heat 
or combined cycle power generation can be applied. 
The economic potential for greater fuel efficiency is 
considerably lower and for substitution from coal 
or oil to natural gas or non-fossil fuel is critically 
dependent on the relative prices and availability of 
the fuels in question. In evaluating switching be-
tween fossil fuels it is necessary to account for any 
potential increases in methane emissions from pro-
duction and transmission of the fuels in calculating 
the net benefit of such strategies. Overall, efficiency 
of the electricity system can be improved through 
the use of least cost utility planning. The goal of 
least cost utility planning is to meet energy-service 
requirements through the least cost combination of 
supply additions and demand management. 
3.5.7 
POLICY MEASURES 
The pool of policy measures is broadly similar for 
all nations. The measures fall generally into three 
groups: 
• Information 
measures include all efforts to bet-
ter inform the public on greenhouse gas emis-
sions and the means available to the public for 
their reduction. This includes research, devel-
opment, and demonstration 
programs for 
emerging technologies and education and train-
ing of professional experts in all sectors. These 
programs should be targeted at particular sec-
tions of the populace and should emphasize the 
present and potential future costs and benefits 
of such actions. The transfer of information and 
expertise between countries requires particular 
attention in order to ensure the relevance and 
the applicability of the information to local 
conditions. This is especially true in the case of 
technology transfer to developing countries. 
• Economic measures include the broad areas of 
taxes, charges, subsidies, and pricing policies 
that include incorporating environmental costs 
into energy prices (both imposition and re-

complement regulations, making them more ef-
fective in meeting environmental goals. Eco-
nomic measures may also be used to support the 
research, development, demonstration, or ap-
plication of technologies for enhanced energy 
efficiency, fuel substitution, or pollution con-
trol. The use of tradeable emission permits or 
emission compensation on a global scale for 
greenhouse gas abatement might take advantage 
of the ability of certain regions to control emis-
sions more cheaply than others. 
• Regulatory measures include a broad array of 
control mechanisms, and standards regulations 
used for environmental protection have ranged 
from emission standards to requirements for 
environmental impact assessments. Regulations 
used to enhance energy security have ranged 
from end-use efficiency standards to require-
ments for the use of certain fuels in certain 
sectors. Such regulations may of course help to 
protect the environment as well. 
Tables 3.6a-c illustrate policy measures in these 
three groups with some of the criteria listed in Sec-
tion 3.5.1. More careful exploration and examina-
tion will be required in the future. 
3.6 
C O S T S 
It is essential that the costs of emission abatement 
strategies are fully assessed. Anecdotal evidence 
suggests that the cost of some strategies could be 
high and that, from a given starting point, the more 
ambitious the strategy the higher the associated 
costs. The EIS is not yet able, however, to provide 
informed advice on the costs associated with the 
measures and response strategies discussed in this 
report. Further work in this area is essential. 
Some preliminary indications are available from 
the individual Country Studies submitted to EIS, 
which suggest: 
a) Significant emission abatement potential is 
available at low or negative resource cost when 
tested at social discount rates. By 2020 this 
might amount to around 20 percent of global

primarily to additional fuel substitution and

to the proper development of policy. Such esti-
mates must include not only the resource costs 
of technical options but also the cost of govern-
ment policy implementation, macroeconomic and 
second round effects, social and environmental 
costs and benefits, and private and non-monetary 
costs. 
The EIS is aware of the existence of a number of 
reports and assessments undertaken. These have not 
been presented to the subgroup or examined by it. 
It may be appropriate for the group to review these 
reports in the next phase of its work.

RESPONSE CASE STUDIES 
The EIS received preliminary policy studies from a 
number of countries. The European Commission 
submitted a response scenario for the European 
Community. The IEA secretariat submitted a pre-
liminary study. The I A E A presented a paper on 
nuclear power. 
The criteria for the examination of options se-
lected differ among studies, so that the results in 
terms of emissions reductions achieved are not com-
parable and cannot be fully integrated. Therefore, 
only preliminary analysis is possible. Further work 
needs to be done. More studies from additional 
countries are needed to cover a larger fraction of 
current C 0
2 emissions. Moreover, the compara-
bility of the results should be enhanced. 
According to the material and scenarios sub-
mitted to EIS it appears that the capacity of re-
gions and countries to limit emissions varies greatly. 
However, some broad generalizations are possible. 
• Some developing countries may be able to re-
duce the annual growth in C 0 2 emissions from 
over 3 percent to around 2 percent while main-
taining economic growth. The largest oppor-
tunities in developing countries appear to be 
increased efficiency in both energy supply and 
demand. 
• East European countries and the USSR may be 
able to slow the growth or to stabilize C 0
2 
emissions over the next two decades, if policies 
to restructure their economies, increase effi-
ciency, and promote economic development 
and substitution are implemented. 
• West European countries including the E C may 
be able to stabilize or reduce C 0 2 emissions by 
early in the next decade through a variety of 
measures including taxes, energy efficiency 
programs, nuclear power, natural gas, and re-
newables, without macroeconomic drawbacks. 
A few of these countries (Norway, the Nether-
lands, and Sweden) have formally adopted poli-
cies to limit emissions. 
• North American and Pacific O E C D countries 
may be able to slow the growth in C 0 2 emis-
sions by increased efficiency in energy supply 
and demand, fuel switching to nuclear, natural 
gas, and renewables, and other measures. Fur-
ther policy actions on the part of countries in 
this group are undergoing further analysis. 
The material available to the EIS demonstrates 
the important role industrialized countries' emis-
sions play in total global emissions in the near term. 
The material also indicates that the technical poten-
tial for reductions is large. Therefore, in the near 
term, without actions in the industrialized coun-
tries, no significant progress in limiting global emis-
sions will occur. However, the costs, and the extent 
to which this potential can be achieved, are uncer-
tain.

S T R A T E G I E S 
Climate change offers an unprecedented challenge 
to energy policy development. Many uncertainties 
remain about both the impacts of climate change 
itself and our response to it. 
It is very important that countries begin the task 
of developing flexible and phased response strate-
gies. The underlying theme of any strategy must be 
economic efficiency—achieving the maximum ben-
efit at minimum cost. Strategies that focus only on 
Energy and Industry 
69 
one group of emission sources, one type of abate-
ment option, or one particular greenhouse gas will 
not achieve this. Energy policy responses should 
therefore be balanced against alternative abatement 
options in the forestry and agricultural sectors, and 
adaptation options and other policy goals where 
applicable at both national and international levels. 
Ways must be sought to account for consequences 
for other countries, and inter generational issues, 
when making policy decisions. 
Responses must also balance increasing under-
standing of the science and impacts of climate 
change with increasing efforts to avoid as much as 
possible its negative consequences. In parallel, we 
must develop a clearer understanding of the full 
social and economic implications of various re-
sponse options available. 
Encouragement for accelerated implementation 
of energy efficiency measures (on both the demand 
and supply side) should be a major common focus 
of initial policy responses. This will need to be 
supported by enhanced R & D if momentum is to be 
maintained. Encouragement for additional use of 
natural gas and low-cost renewable or less green-
house gas producing energy technologies is also 
likely to be a common feature. 
The appropriate mix of policy instruments will 
require detailed evaluation in the light of individual 
national circumstances. Initially, the highest prior-
ity must be to review existing policies and remove 
inappropriate conflicts with the goals of climate 
change policy. New initiatives will, however, be 
required. The international implications of some 
policy instruments (e.g., trade and competitiveness 
issues associated with carbon taxes, energy effi-
ciency standards, and emission targets) will need to 
be resolved quickly if effective responses are not to 
be hampered. 
The recommendations presented below suggest 
increasing levels of response with increasing knowl-
edge and post-hoc evaluation of previous actions. It 
is predicated on a determined drive to take actions 
now to start with measures that make sense for 
other policy reasons; to promote energy efficiency 
and lower greenhouse gas emission technologies; 
and to accelerate R & D aimed at evaluating future 
options, developing new alternatives and reducing 
the cost of those options already available. 
This is, of course, a simplified summary of a 
complex process. It does, however, contain the key 
points of a phased, planned response with regular 
review of both previous actions and outcomes and 
of future options. It is inevitable that some coun-
tries will progress faster than others, particularly 
perhaps in the early stages. But it is vital that all 
nations begin the journey now. 
3.9 
R E C O M M E N D A T I O N S 
I P C C countries have made a commitment to nego-
tiate a framework convention as soon as possible. 
That convention will provide the international com-
munity with a legal mechanism for considering and 
developing subsequent agreements and protocols. 
The energy sector is a major source of greenhouse 
gas emissions. The consideration of energy sector 
emissions, reduction opportunities, policies, and 
costs should be an important part of a convention 
process. 
The Subgroup is of the view that because of the 
critical role of the energy sector in the economic 
development process and because of the strong link-
ages with other sectors, there is a need to develop 
both general policy recommendations and specific 
short- and long-term recommendations. 
3.9.1 
GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS 
Despite the fact that many uncertainties remain, we 
recommend that all individual nations should: 
1) Take steps now to attempt to limit, stabilize, 
or reduce the emission of energy-related 
greenhouse gases and prevent the destruction 
and improve the effectiveness of sinks. One 
option that governments may wish to consider 
is the setting of targets for C 0 2 and other 
greenhouse gases. 
2) Adopt a flexible progressive approach, based 
on the best available scientific, economic, and 
technological knowledge, to action needed to 
respond to climate change. 
3) Draw up specific policy objectives and im-
plement wide-ranging comprehensive pro-
70 
I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
grammes that cover all energy-related green-
house gases. 
4) Start with implementing strategies that have 
multiple social, economic, and environmental 
benefits, are cost effective, are compatible 
with sustainable development, and make use 
of market forces in the best way possible. 
5) Intensify international, multilateral, and bilat-
eral cooperation in developing new energy 
strategies to cope with climate change. In this 
context, industrialized countries are encour-
aged to promote the development and the 
transfer of energy-efficient and clean technol-
ogies to other countries. 
6) Increase public awareness of the need for ex-
ternal environmental costs to be reflected in 
energy prices, markets, and policy decisions 
to the extent that they can be determined. 
7) Increase public awareness of energy efficiency 
technologies and products and alternatives, 
through public education and information 
(e.g., labeling). 
8) Strengthen research and development and in-
ternational collaboration in energy technolo-
gies, economic and energy policy analysis, 
which are relevant for climate change. 
9) Encourage the participation of industry, the 
general public, and N G O s in the development 
and implementation of strategies to limit 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
While the specific recommendations for action 
that follow apply in general to all countries, indus-
trialized countries in particular should seek to im-
plement such measures as soon as possible, given 
their greater economic and technological capacity to 
act in the shorter term. 
3.9.2 
SHORT-TERM STRATEGY 
As short-term strategies all individual nations 
should: 
1) Establish interim policy objectives to limit 
energy-related greenhouse gases, draw up 
programmes to meet the objectives and mon-
itor the effectiveness and cost of the pro-
grammes against the objectives. 
2) Start on measures that are technically and 
commercially proven, and beneficial in their 
own right. 
3) Focus on economic instruments that could 
have an important role in limiting green-
house gas emissions. We note with approval 
the work on these issues under way within 
the I P C C process and urge all countries to 
contribute to progress on that work. 
4) Identify and take immediate steps to remove 
inappropriate regulatory barriers. Countries 
should review energy-related price and tariff 
systems, with the aim of removing disincen-
tives to the efficient use of energy. 
5) Promote the market penetration of: 
• improved efficiency in the production, 
conversion, and use of energy; 
• non-fossil and low greenhouse emission 
energy sources; and 
• technologies to remove, recirculate or fix 
methane emissions from landfills, coal 
mines and other sources. 
Actions should be taken on a number of the 
options identified in Table 3.2, e.g., in the 
transport sector. The choice of options 
should be based on cost-effectiveness anal-
ysis on a national and international level. 
6) Integrate 
consideration of environmental 
costs into policy decisions at all levels of en-
ergy planning, both public and private. 
7) Improve efficiency standards for mass pro-
duced goods—e.g., cars, trucks, buses, elec-
trical appliances, buildings, air conditioners, 
ventilators, industrial motors, pumps for 
heating systems. 
8) Start to develop and make widely available 
tools to assist in the evaluation and develop-
ment of options and strategies to reduce 
energy-related 
greenhouse gas emissions 
(e.g., analyzing and quantifying the full fuel 
cycle effects, least-cost energy planning, de-
veloping a measure to facilitate comparison 
such as C 0
2 equivalence, constructing a 
Energy and Industry 
71 
framework for multisectoral policy deci-
sions). 
9) Collaborate on development, validation, and 
monitoring of national and global energy-
related emission data. 
10) Encourage the effective transfer of appropri-
ate technology and information on the effec-
tiveness of policies that are successful in 
promoting energy efficiency. 
11) Contribute to an international common un-
derstanding of how to limit or reduce 
energy-related greenhouse gas emissions. 
3.9.3 
L O N G - T E R M STRATEGY 
As our understanding of climate change develops, 
policies and strategies should be kept under review. 
It is not possible to forecast how they will develop 
in any detail, but it is clear that implementing the 
concept of sustainable development should be a 
central theme. 
In this context all individual nations should: 
1) Accelerate work on the longer-term options 
identified in Table 3.3 including: 
• improved efficiency in the production, con-
version, and use of energy; 
• increased use of non-fossil and low green-
house gas emission energy sources; and 
• reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 
removal, recirculation, or fixation. 
2) Formulate and implement strategies achieving 
sustainable emission levels that take account 
of the factors listed in Tables 3.6a-c regarding 
the impacts on energy prices, long-term eco-
nomic growth and risk/security aspects of en-
ergy supply. 
3) Evaluate the relative cost effectiveness of lim-
itation and adaptation climate change strate-
gies, and seek ways to account for inter-
national and intergenerational consequences. 
4) Encourage the development of new technolo-
gies to limit, reduce, or fix greenhouse gas 
emissions associated with economic and en-
ergy activities. 
5) Encourage infrastructural improvements— 
e.g., in transport, electrical grids, and natural 
gas distribution systems. 
3.9.4 
FURTHER W O R K TO B E D O N E 
There is much work remaining to be done. A brief 
list of items related to the mission of the EIS is 
presented below. 
1) A n area of high priority is to assess the fea-
sibility of different targets and strategies for 
limiting climate change and their costs, bene-
fits and effectiveness. Such assessments should 
take a full fuel cycle approach and consider 
trade-offs among all greenhouse gases. Sec-
ondary effects should also be considered. 
2) There is an urgent need to improve the data 
available from the developing and East Euro-
pean countries and for additional studies in the 
future, through the participation of a larger 
number of countries in the EIS. 
3) N o single analytical tool or model is sufficient 
to analyze the many issues discussed in this 
report. A broad set of tools ranging from mac-
roeconomic models, technology assessment 
tools, and policy models of specific sectors— 
e.g., the transportation, utilities, and resi-
dential/commercial sectors—need to be de-
veloped in the future. 
4) There is an important need to collaborate on 
development, monitoring, and validation of 
national and global energy-related emission 
data. Common methods of measuring, mon-
itoring and evaluating energy-related green-
house gases that can accommodate such issues 
as accounting for greenhouse gas emissions 
from bunkers, non-energy fuel use and energy 
trade, C 0
2 equivalence, and C H 4 and N 2 0 , 
should be developed. 
5) Further comparisons of target options and re-
sponse strategies in the energy and industry 
sectors using "top down" and "bottom up" 
approaches are needed. 
72 
I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
6) There is a need to move beyond simply assess-
ing broad emission strategies to assessing the 
specific technologies and options open to indi-
vidual countries. This will require the devel-
opment and exchange of more detailed infor-
mation both at the country and international 
levels than has been possible to date. 
7) A l l nations should analyze the feasibility of 
arrangements in a worldwide context to dis-
courage the movement of high emitting pro-
duction facilities from countries with high 
environmental control standards to countries 
with lower standards.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
I N T R O D U C T I O N 
Existing forests serve a multitude of functions vital 
for mankind in addition to providing wood as a 
renewable resource. Thus, there is a paramount 
need to conserve forest resources and to implement 
measures to increase forest biomass at the same 
time. 
The total area of forests (excluding other wooded 
lands) at present amounts to about 4 billion ha, 
roughly half of it tropical forests, and of the remain-
der, temperate and boreal forests account for one 
third and two thirds respectively. During the course 
of human history, roughly 2 billion ha have been 
lost due to various human activities, mostly in the 
temperate zones. 
The amount of carbon presently stored in forests 
is equivalent to about the amount in the atmo-
sphere, namely, approximately 700 billion tonnes 
of carbon. This means that 1 ha of forest contains on 
a global average between 100 and 200 tonnes of 
carbon, while afforested areas may fix on average 5-
10 tonnes carbon per ha per year. Land uses involv-
ing conversion of forests through burning of bio-
mass or felling contribute about 9 percent of total 
carbon equivalent greenhouse gas emissions, and 
about 15-30 percent of anthropogenic C 0 2 emis-
sions. Agricultural production systems provide 
both sources and potential sinks for atmospheric 
greenhouse gases. It is estimated that agricultural 
activities currently contribute about 14 percent of 
total carbon equivalent of greenhouse gas emis-
sions, including emissions of carbon dioxide, meth-
ane, and nitrous oxide, and emissions of gases that 
contribute indirectly to global warming, such as 
nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide. 
World population is projected to grow at an aver-
age of 1.3 percent per year reaching about 8.2 bil-
lion by 2025. To meet the increased food re-
quirements, agricultural production will also need 
to increase. Agricultural crop area in developing 
countries is expected to grow by 1.2 percent per 
year in combination with increased yields from 
existing crop acreage obtained largely from in-
creased use of nitrogen fertilizers. Production of 
meat and dairy products is expected to increase by 
over 45 percent in this period. Achievement of food 
production requirements is and will remain the 
dominating goal in many areas around the world, 
and actions in response to climate change must rec-
ognize economic and social impacts in addition to 
environmental considerations. 
Organic matter in waste and wastewater is con-
verted into methane by various types of methane 
bacteria under anaerobic conditions. Anaerobic 
conditions exist in most landfill sites and in most 
lagoons used for treating organic-loaded wastewa-
ter. Total global methane emissions from waste dis-
posals and from wastewater lagoons are estimated 
to be 20-70 million tonnes per year, or on average 8 
percent of total anthropogenic methane emissions. 
CONTRIBUTION OF AGRICULTURE, 
FORESTRY, A N D O T H E R H U M A N ACTIVITIES 
TO GREENHOUSE GASES 
The agriculture and forestry sector is an important 
source of greenhouse gases accounting for approx-
imately 23 percent of total carbon equivalent green-
house gas emissions from anthropogenic sources in 
the 1980s. These sources include rice production, 
ruminant animals, fertilizers, loss of soil organic 
77 
78 
I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
matter, land conversion, biomass burning, and 
other non-energy activities. 
Deforestation contributes between 0.4 and 2.8 
billion tonnes of carbon (BTC), and biomass burn-
ing (forests, savanna, and shrub-fallow) between 20 
and 80 million tonnes (MT) methane per year. The 
scientists who addressed the I P C C Tropical Forest 
Workshop, Sao Paulo, Brazil, January 1990 were 
reasonably certain that in 1980 emissions were be-
tween 1.0 and 2.0 billion tonnes of carbon (BTC), 
and 
in 1989 emissions were between 2.0 and 
2.8 BTC. 
Ruminant animals produce methane as part of 
their natural digestive process. Total methane emis-
sions from domestic ruminant animals have been 
estimated to be between 65 and 100 million tonnes 
per year. In addition, animal wastes from anaerobic 
waste management systems are likely to yield on the 
order of 15 million tonnes globally. 
Flooded rice fields produce methane due to mi-
crobial decay of organic matter. While uncertainty 
exists, they appear to account for between 25 and 
170 million tonnes, or on average 20 percent of 
global methane emissions. Rice production is ex-
pected to increase from the current level of 458 
million tonnes to over 750 million tonnes by the 
year 2020. 
Loss of soil organic matter from agricultural soils 
is uncertain but could amount to up to 2 billion 
tonnes of carbon (BTC) per year. 
Use of nitrogen fertilizers results in emissions of 
nitrous oxide equivalent to 0.01-2.2 million tonnes 
of nitrogen per year. 
Biomass burning for land use conversion and the 
burning of agricultural wastes is estimated to ac-
count for over half of all biomass burned annually. 
These agriculture-related activities therefore con-
tribute over 5-10 percent of total annual methane 
emissions, 3 to 8 percent of nitrous oxide emissions, 
10-20 percent of carbon monoxide emissions, and 
5-20 percent of N O x emissions. 
Landfill sites and wastewater treatment plants 
emit about 20-80 million tonnes of methane per 
year. 
FUTURE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS 
Future greenhouse gas emissions are difficult to pre-
dict because of uncertainties in estimating economic 
and population growth rates, and changes in for-
estry agriculture practices, and climate sensitivity. 
Scenarios of emissions, which must be used with 
caution, suggest that emissions are likely to grow 
well into the future without mitigating policy mea-
sures (see Executive Summary Table 4.1). These 
estimates suggest that C 0 2 emissions from de-
forestation could range between 1.1 and 3.9 billion 
tonnes of carbon in 2020, that methane emissions 
from flooded rice will increase to about 150 million 
tonnes in 2025, and that methane emissions from 
managed livestock (including their wastes) will in-
crease to about 185 million tonnes. Nitrous oxide 
emissions from use of nitrogen fertilizers will prob-
ably increase by up to about 3.5 million tonnes. 
Emissions from biomass burning are highly uncer-
tain and have been assumed to remain constant at 55 
million tonnes as a minimum. 
Emissions of methane from landfill sites and 
wastewater treatment plants will probably increase 
to about 50-90 million tonnes per year by the year 
2020. 
POLICY OPTIONS, TECHNOLOGIES, A N D 
PRACTICES TO R E D U C E EMISSIONS 
Currently available policies, technologies, and 
practices in forestry, agriculture, and waste disposal 
are likely to be only partially effective in reducing 
the predicted growth in emissions, unless they are 
coupled with emission reductions in the energy and 
industry sector. However, many practices and tech-
nologies are available today that, if utilized, could 
modify the rate of growth in emissions and that 
appear to make sense for economic and environ-
mental reasons. Other options have been identified 
that require additional research and demonstration. 
Policies should address not only technical options 
but also instrumental (economic, regulatory, infor-
mation, etc.) and institutional options in order to 
become effective. Although uncertainties about the 
rate and extent of climate change remain, it is rec-
ommended that all countries take steps to: 
• adopt clear objectives for the conservation, re-
forestation, and/or sustainable development of 
forests in national development plans; 
• amend national policies to minimize forest loss 
associated with public and private development

projects (e.g., roads, dams, resettlement proj-
ects, mining, logging); 
• adopt forest management solutions integrated 
across sectors to policies on environment, agri-
culture, transportation, energy, 
economics, 
poverty, and landlessness; 
• implement policies to promote increasing pro-
ductivity in sustainable agriculture and to pro-
tect natural resources; and 
• improve public awareness of all these points 
through education programmes. 
Policy options need not be implemented in se-
quence, i.e., policies should be implemented as it 
becomes apparent that they meet a number of na-
tional needs. In addition, policies associated with 
production, processing, storage, transportation, 
and marketing need to be examined to derive the 
optimum effectiveness from research, technolog-
ical developments, and land use practices. To pro-
mote sustainable agriculture and forestry, analyses 
are needed of economic incentives, taxes, pricing 
and trade barriers, cultural practices, technology 
transfer measures, education and information pro-
grammes, and international cooperation and finan-
cial assistance measures. 
CRITERIA FOR THE SELECTION OF 
POLICY OPTIONS 
It is important that these options be pursued with-
out undue economic disruption. Policies should 
also: 
• be of widespread applicability; 
• be compatible with the social and economic life 
of communities dependent on agriculture and 
forestry; 
• be equitable in the distribution of the burdens 
of action between developed and developing 
countries, taking into account the special situa-
tion of the latter; 
• result in the spread of knowledge, management 
skills, and technologies; 
• result in net environmental gain; and 
• take account of the fact that emissions in this 
sector largely comprise many small sources or 
diffuse sources from large areas.

I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
N E A R - T E R M OPTIONS 
The opportunities for reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions and enhancing carbon sinks in the near 
term include the following: 
Forestry 
• Develop and implement policies that will re-
duce current deforestation and forest degrada-
tion to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and 
enhance forest areas as carbon sinks. 
• Improve efficiency of use of fuelwood. 
• Introduce sustainable harvesting and natural 
forest management methods to reduce tree 
damage. 
• Partially replace fossil energy sources by sus-
tainably managed sources of biomass which 
would reduce net emissions of additional C O a . 
• Increase efforts to replace high energy input 
materials with wood, and encourage further 
recycling of forest products in order to provide 
for long-term storage of carbon. 
• Strengthen the use of remote sensing in forest 
management and in the determination of forest 
removal and emission patterns, by developing 
and coordinating data collection and analyses 
among relevant institutions. 
• Determine the feasibility of implementing the 
Noordwijk Declaration aim of achieving net 
global forest growth of 12 million ha per year, 
through conservation of existing forests and ag-
gressive afforestation, and develop appropriate 
national strategies. 
• Perform analyses for and begin to implement 
large-scale national forestation and forest pro-
tection plans. 
• Identify and eliminate inappropriate economic 
incentives and subsidies in forestry and non-
forest sectors that contribute to forest loss. 
• Develop enhanced regeneration methods for 
boreal forests in order to cope with change in 
the climate. 
• Ensure the health of existing forests, in particu-
lar by reducing air pollution, e.g., acid deposi-
tion, tropospheric ozone, S 0 2 , N O x , N H 3 , 
VOCs, etc., by adopting appropriate policies 
to reduce site-specific and regional pollution 
problems. 
• Use available surplus agricultural land for for-
estry as appropriate. 
• Fully integrate the requirements of forest con-
servation and sustainable management in all rel-
evant sections of national development plan-
ning and policy. 
• Evaluate the implications of population growth 
and distribution for the achievement of national 
forestry measures and take appropriate action. 
Agriculture 
• Reduce biomass burning through fire control, 
education and management programmes, as 
well as the introduction of the use of appropri-
ate alternative agricultural practices. 
• Modify agricultural systems dependent on the 
removal of biomass by burning to provide op-
portunities for increasing soil organic matter 
and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. 
• Reduce methane emissions through manage-
ment of livestock wastes, expansion of supple-
mental feeding practices for livestock and 
increased use of production and growth-
enhancing agents with appropriate safeguards 
for human health and taking into account legiti-
mate consumer concerns. 
• Reduce nitrous oxide emissions by using im-
proved fertilizer formulations and application 
technologies, and through judicious use of ani-
mal manure. 
• Introduce where appropriate minimum- or no-
till systems that are recommended for those 
countries currently using tillage as part of the 
annual cropping sequence, to yield additional 
benefits such as direct energy savings, improved 
soil tilth, and increased soil organic matter. 
• Use areas marginally suitable for annual crop-
ping systems for perennial cover crops for fod-
der or pastoral land uses, or forests if soils are 
suitable. This would increase carbon uptake, 
both in the vegetation and soil, and would yield 
other benefits such as reduced soil erosion, im-
proved water infiltration and quality, and de-
layed streamflow. 
Waste Management 
• Consider using landfill gas collection systems 
and flaring to reduce methane emissions in de-
veloped countries where practical. 
Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Human Activities 
81 
• Use biogas systems to treat wastewater in de-
veloping countries in order to reduce methane 
emissions and provide inexpensive sources of 
energy. 
• Promote maximum recycling of wastes. 
L O N G E R - T E R M OPTIONS 
Several opportunities for reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions and enhancing carbon sinks have been 
identified for the longer term. In general, these op-
portunities must be developed, demonstrated, and 
assessed in terms of greenhouse gas reductions and 
the full range of potential costs and benefits. These 
alternatives must maintain or enhance the produc-
tivity of agriculture and forestry systems. This will 
require substantial research efforts focused on bet-
ter understanding of the processes by which these 
gases are emitted, further investigation of promising 
options, and better field measurement devices. 
Forestry 
• Develop and implement standardized methods 
of forest inventory and bio-monitoring to facil-
itate global forest management and to make 
production ecology studies and cost/benefit an-
alyses comparable across forest areas. 
• Increase wood production and forest produc-
tivity by silvicultural measures and genetically 
improved trees, thus helping to increase the 
forest carbon sink, to meet increasing demand 
for wood as well as to support replacement of 
fossil fuels and other materials by wood and to 
avoid inappropriate land use conversion. 
• Incorporate forest protection strategies for fire, 
insects, and diseases into future management 
and planning under various climate change sce-
narios. 
• Develop and implement silvicultural adjust-
ment and stress management strategies to main-
tain existing forests. 
• Develop 
and 
implement environmentally 
sound management practices for peatlands that 
restrict the release of carbon, especially as 
methane. 
• Make use of the specific opportunities of inten-
sively managed temperate forests to mitigate 
the greenhouse effect by expanding their bio-
mass. 
Agriculture 
• A comprehensive approach including manage-
ment of water regimes, development of new 
cultivars, efficient use of fertilizers, and other 
management practices could lead to a 10-30 
percent reduction in methane emissions from 
flooded rice cultivation, although substantial 
research is necessary to develop and demon-
strate these practices. A 10 percent reduction in 
emissions from rice systems may contribute 
about 15-20 percent of the total reduction re-
quired to stabilize atmospheric concentrations 
of methane. 
• Through a number of technologies it appears 
that methane emissions from livestock systems 
may be reduced by up to 25-75 percent per unit 
of product in dairy and meat production. The 
net effect of such improvements depends upon 
the extent to which such methods can be ap-
plied to domestic ruminant populations, which 
will vary greatly from country to country. 
However, each 5 percent reduction from this 
source could contribute 6-8 percent of the re-
duction necessary to stabilize methane in the 
atmosphere. 
• Fertilizer-derived emissions of nitrous oxide 
potentially can be reduced (although to what 
extent is uncertain) through changes in prac-
tices such as using controlled-release nitrogen, 
improving fertilizer-use efficiency, and adopt-
ing appropriate alternative agricultural systems. 
• Trace gas emissions from biomass burning, 
land conversion, and cropping systems may be 
reduced through widespread adoption of sus-
tainable agricultural practices, optimizing use 
of fertilizer and organic amendments, and im-
proved pasture management and grazing sys-
tems. These gains may be offset by pressures of 
increasing population and increased demand for 
food and fiber production. 
G E N E R A L ISSUES AFFECTING T H E 
AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY, A N D WASTE 
M A N A G E M E N T SECTORS 
Emissions from these sectors are intimately related 
to the ability of countries to provide for national 
and global food security and raw materials for ex-
82 
I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
port. Policies for emission control and sink en-
hancement therefore may affect the economic basis 
of some countries, especially developing countries. 
Efforts to prevent deforestation and to promote 
afforestation will have multiple impacts that in 
many cases may enhance the abilities of indigenous 
agricultural communities to feed themselves and to 
earn a living from local surplus. Flexibility should 
be provided to governments to develop least-cost 
implementation strategies, and countries should 
pursue those options that increase productivity, 
make economic sense, are environmentally sound, 
and are beneficial for other reasons. Agriculture, 
forestry, and waste treatment sources of greenhouse 
gas emissions consist of very large numbers of small 
sources and/or of diffuse sources from large land 
areas, and as such represent a major challenge. 
Controls on existing sources of pollution that 
may affect agricultural and forestry lands are an 
important component in reducing emissions and 
protecting sinks. Measures to prevent land degrada-
tion, hydrological problems, and loss of biodiver-
sity and to improve productivity will generally 
complement efforts in this sector. Furthermore, 
analysis is needed about the costs and benefits of 
individual policy measures. 
It is desirable to consider a range of measures in 
the context of a comprehensive response strategy. 
Currently available options in the agriculture and 
forestry sectors are likely to be only partially effec-
tive unless coupled with action to reduce emissions 
from the energy and industry sector. There is an 
urgent need to improve all relevant data, especially 
on deforestation rates and on the socio-economic 
factors that lead to the use of deleterious practices in 
agriculture and forestry. In order to achieve the full 
potential of identified measures, research is needed 
into the routes by which new technologies can be 
introduced while preserving and enhancing social 
and economic development. 
In the past, the agriculture and forestry sector has 
proved efficient at introducing new methods of pro-
duction, not always with beneficial ecological con-
sequences. The pace of technological development 
(even in the absence of global warming) is likely to 
remain high in this sector for the foreseeable future. 
This may afford new opportunities for emission 
reduction and sink enhancement, provided efficient 
transfer of knowledge, advice, and technology oc-
curs. 
INTERNATIONAL OPTIONS 
A broad range of institutional issues must be ad-
dressed in order to ensure that the objectives of 
increased global food production and reduced 
greenhouse gas emissions can be met in the future. 
Among the options that governments, international 
organizations and intergovernmental bodies such as 
I P C C should consider are the following: 
• A series of agricultural workshops and sympo-
sia to assess new information on agricultural 
production and emission forecasts, exchange 
information on the effectiveness of new tech-
nologies and management practices, and evalu-
ate the potential impact of agricultural policies. 
These meetings should address the institutional 
and economic issues particular to the major ag-
ricultural sources of emissions, such as biomass 
burning, temperate agricultural practices, live-
stock emissions, and emissions from rice culti-
vation. 
• Guidelines for future research by F A O , 
C G I A R (Consultative Group on International 
Agricultural Research), I U F R O (International 
Union of Forestry Research Organisations), 
and others to address the need to investigate 
impacts of climate change and options for re-
ducing emissions. 
• Strengthen, support and extend the Tropical 
Forestry Action Plan process to all countries 
with tropical forests, and expand support for 
immediate implementation of completed plans. 
• Strengthen the role of ITTO to develop interna-
tional guidelines to encourage: 
a) sustainable forest management techniques, 
including national legislation requiring man-
agement of forest for sustained wood pro-
duction; 
b) an assessment of incentives for sustainable 
forest management including feasibility of 
labeling. 
• Strengthen the role of development banks, 
IMF, F A O , U N E P , and other multilateral or 
bilateral international organizations in helping 
developing countries achieve conservation and 
Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Human Activities 
83 
sustainable development of forests and agricul-
ture by: 
a) requiring analyses of climate change implica-
tions, potential greenhouse gas emissions, 
and response programmes in their review of 
project proposals; 
b) expanding greatly aid and investment flows 
to both sectors; 
c) expanding debt relief via renegotiation of 
debt, and debt for conservation exchanges; 
and 
d) linking structural adjustment measures to al-
leviation of climatic impacts and reduction 
of gas emissions. 
DEVELOPMENT OF A W O R L D FOREST 
CONSERVATION P R O T O C O L 
The following declaration was agreed upon in the 
workshop on tropical forests in Sao Paulo in Janu-
ary 1990: 
Consideration of forestry issues, and of tropical 
forestry issues in particular, must not distract 
attention from the central issue of global climate 
change and the emission of greenhouse gases at-
tributable to the burning of fossil fuels by devel-
oped countries. N o agreement on forests and 
global climate change will be reached without 
commitments by developed countries on green-
house gas emissions. The groups recognized that 
the conservation of tropical forests is of crucial 
importance for global climatic stability (partic-
ularly having regard to the important contribu-
tion of tropical forest destruction to global 
warming, carbon dioxide, methane, and other 
trace gases), but of more crucial importance for 
national economic and social development, for 
the conservation of biodiversity, and for local and 
regional climatic and environmental reasons. The 
Workshop recommended that the I P C C support 
the development of a forestry protocol in the 
context of a climate convention process that also 
addressed energy supply and use. The Workshop 
concluded that the specific elements of such a 
protocol are a matter for international negotia-
tions. These elements may include: fundamental 
research, tropical forest planning, measures to 
use, protect, and reforest, international trade, fi-
nancial assistance, and the advantages and disad-
vantages of national and international targets. 
The objective should be to present more concrete 
proposals on the occasion of the U N Conference 
on Environment and Development, to be held in 
1992. 
In light of the above, it is recommended that a 
World Forest Conservation Protocol, covering 
temperate, boreal, and tropical forests, be devel-
oped in the context of a climate convention process 
that also addresses energy supply and use, as noted 
by the January 1990, I P C C / R S W G Tropical Forest 
Workshop in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and that in accor-
dance with U N G A Resolution 44/207, operative 
paragraph 10, a meeting of interested countries 
from both the developed and developing world and 
of appropriate international agencies be held to 
identify possible key elements of such protocols and 
practical means of implementing them. Such a meet-
ing should also develop a framework and methodol-
ogy for analyzing the feasibility of the Noordwijk 
remit, including alternative targets as well as the full 
range of costs and benefits. 
A l l countries should make a contribution to the 
solution of the global warming problem. The Sao 
Paulo Workshop stated: 
Although forests can assist in mitigating the ef-
fects of atmospheric carbon build-up, the prob-
lem is essentially a fossil fuel one and must be 
addressed as such. In this way, and as a general 
principle, the final report of the present IPCC 
Workshop on Tropical Forests, while putting 
tropical forests in the overall context of global 
warming, should make it clear that the burden of 
response options is not to be placed on develop-
ing countries and thus should state clearly that all 
countries should make a contribution to the solu-
tion of the global warming problem. The temper-
ate forest dieback (caused by acid rain), as 
analogous to tropical deforestation (caused by 
tropical people's attempts to satisfy basic human 
needs), could be specifically mentioned in such a 
context. 
It should, however, be noted that recent findings 
indicate that forests may be adversely affected 
throughout the world by a variety of causes, only 
one of which is acid deposition. 
84 
I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
The Sao Paulo Workshop further noted: 
Forests cannot be considered in isolation, and 
solutions must be based on an integrated ap-
proach which links forestry to other policies, 
such as those concerned with poverty and land-
lessness. The forest crisis is rooted in the agri-
cultural sector and in people's needs for employ-
ment and income. Deforestation will be stopped 
only when the natural forest is economically 
more valuable than alternative uses for the same 
land. 
4.1 
I N T R O D U C T I O N 
This report examines the roles of agriculture, for-
estry, and human activities other than energy pro-
duction and industry as sources of greenhouse 
gases, and possible measures for reducing their 
emission into the atmosphere. 
Working Group I of I P C C suggests in its report 
that the global average temperature will rise within 
the next 80 years by about 2.4-5.1 degrees C above 
pre-industrial, with a best estimate of 3.5 degrees C. 
Predictions of concomitant changes in precipitation 
and wind patterns are much less certain. Little in-
formation is currently available on the rate of 
change, transient conditions, and changes in the 
occurrence of extreme events such as storms and 
forest fires. 
Agriculture- and forestry-related activities con-
tribute to the emission of greenhouse gases, notably 
of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. 
These sectors account for approximately 23 percent 
of greenhouse gases from anthropogenic sources in 
the 1980s. These sources include rice production, 
ruminant animals, fertilizers, land conversion, bio-
mass burning, and other non-energy activities. 
Deforestation contributes between 0.4 to 2.8 bil-
lion tonnes of carbon (BTC), and biomass burning 
(forests, savanna, and shrub-fallow) between 40 and 
75 million tonnes (MT) methane per year. The sci-
entists who addressed the I P C C Tropical Forest 
Workshop in Sao Paulo were reasonably certain 
that in 1980 emissions were between 1.0 and 2.0 
BTC and that in 1989 emissions were between 2.0 
and 2.8 BTC. 
Ruminant animals produce methane as part of 
their natural digestive processes. Total methane 
emissions from domestic ruminant animals have 
been estimated to be between 60 and 100 million 
tonnes. In addition, animal wastes from anaerobic 
waste management systems are likely to yield on the 
order of 15 million tonnes globally. 
Flooded rice fields produce methane due to mi-
crobial decay of organic matter. While uncertainty 
exists, they appear to account for approximately 110 
million tonnes, or 20 percent of global anthro-
pogenic methane emissions. Rice production is ex-
pected to increase from the current level of 458 mil-
lion tonnes to over 750 million tonnes by the year 
2020. Use of nitrogen fertilizers results in emissions 
of nitrous oxide on the order of 2 million tonnes. 
Loss of soil organic matter from agricultural soils 
is uncertain but could amount to up to 2 billion 
tonnes of carbon (BTC) per year. 
Biomass burning for land use conversion and the 
burning of agricultural wastes is estimated to ac-
count for over half of all biomass burned annually. 
These agriculture-related activities therefore con-
tribute over 5-10 percent of total annual methane 
emissions, 3-8 percent of nitrous oxide emissions, 
10-20 percent of carbon monoxide emissions, and 
5-20 percent of N O x emissions. 
Landfill sites and wastewater treatment plants 
emit about 30-70 million tonnes of methane per 
year. 
Future greenhouse gas emissions are difficult to 
predict because of uncertainties in estimating eco-
nomic and population growth rates and changes in 
forestry and agriculture practices. Scenarios of 
emissions, which must be used with caution, sug-
gest that emissions are likely to grow well into the 
future without policy measures (see Table 4.1). 
These estimates suggest that C 0 2 emissions from 
deforestation could range between 1.1 and 3.9 bil-
lion tonnes of carbon in 2020, that methane emis-
sions from flooded rice will increase to about 150 
million tonnes in 2025, and that methane emissions 
from managed livestock (including their wastes) 
will increase to about 185 million tonnes. Nitrous 
oxide emissions from use of nitrogen fertilizers will

probably increase to about 3.5 million tonnes. 
Emissions from biomass burning are highly uncer-
tain and have been assumed to remain constant at 55 
million tonnes, as a minimum. 
Emissions of methane from landfill sites and 
wastewater treatment plants will probably increase 
to about 50-90 million tonnes per year by the year 
2020. 
Agriculture and forestry may also contribute to 
gases such as N O x , ozone, and carbon monoxide, 
which contribute indirectly to the greenhouse ef-
fect. While significant, these sectors are of course 
not the only sources and also provide sinks for 
carbon dioxide. As a consequence, any considera-
tion of measures and policy options to control emis-
sions from these sectors must take account of the 
overall effects of greenhouse gases. 
The interactions between climate change and ag-
riculture and forestry management complicate pre-
cise evaluation. 
• Climate change in itself will affect forests and 
agriculture. In an altered climate, change will 
tend to increase stress on the biosphere in a 
variety of ways. For instance, seasonal rainfall 
patterns might change. Similarly, extreme 
weather events could occur more frequently. 
Further, the risk of forest fires and diseases 
might increase. 
• Altered forest and agriculture patterns will in 
turn affect the climate. The areas where the 
cover changes from forest to agriculture will re-
flect light from the sun differently, and this al-
tered albedo, by changing the radiation balance, 
might also change climate. Similarly, climate-
related changes in needs for irrigation will affect 
hydrological cycles, including cloud formation, 
which could significantly affect climate. 
• Anthropogenic emissions that affect climate 
might also directly affect forests and agricul-
ture. In the temperate zone, where most of the 
tropospheric ozone precursors 
are emitted, 
ozone, which contributes to the greenhouse ef-
fect, can cause direct damage to vegetation. 
While these complex mechanisms need to be clar-
ified, the need for further research is no excuse for 
delaying action. 
Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Human Activities 
87 
Counter-measures may pose challenges for food 
and fiber security. Options to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions should be balanced with the growing 
demand for food and fiber and other material goals. 
The approach for developing options should be to 
maintain and increase agricultural production in a 
sustainable manner while reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions. 
This report also addresses the role and control of 
organic matter decomposition in wastes and waste-
waters, which can, under anaerobic conditions, 
contribute significantly to methane emissions (ap-
proximately 15 percent of global anthropogenic re-
lease). 
AFOS organized a series of workshops on: 
• Boreal Forests (October 9-11, 1989 in Finland) 
• Temperate Forests (October 30 to November 
1, 1989 in the Federal Republic of Germany) 
• Agriculture (December 12-14, 1989, in the 
United States) 
• Tropical Forests (January 
9-11, 
1990, in 
Brazil) 
to assess the significance of emissions from these 
sectors and possible options for their control. These 
workshops were attended by representatives from 
all concerned regions. The following sections on 
forestry and agriculture are based on the reports of 
these workshops. The section on methane from 
landfill sites and wastewater treatment plants is 
based on a report prepared by one of the participat-
ing countries. 
4.2 
F O R E S T R E S P O N S E 
S T R A T E G I E S 
The total area of forests (excluding other wooded 
lands) at present amounts to approximately 4 billion 
ha, roughly half of it tropical forests, the other half 
temperate or boreal forests, one third and two 
thirds respectively. During the course of human 
history, roughly 2 billion ha have been lost due to 
various human activities. 
The amount of carbon presently stored in forests 
is equivalent to the amount in the atmosphere— 
namely, approximately 700 billion tonnes carbon. 
This means that 1 ha of forest contains on a global 
average between 100 and 200 tonnes of carbon, 
while afforested areas fix on average 5-10 tonnes 
carbon per ha per year. 
Land uses involving conversion of forest through 
burning of biomass or felling contribute about 9 
percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and about 15-
30 percent of anthropogenic C 0 2 emissions. 
The Noordwijk Declaration on Atmospheric 
Pollution and Climate Change states in point 21 
that, 
The Conference . . . 
* agrees to pursue a global balance between de-
forestation on the one hand and sound forest 
management and afforestation on the other. A 
world net forest growth of 12 million hectares a 
year in the beginning of next century should be 
considered as provisional aim. 
• requests the I P C C to consider the feasibility of 
achieving this aim. . . . 
The outcomes of the forestry workshops clearly 
demonstrate the necessity both to conserve forest 
resources and to implement measures to increase 
forest biomass at the same time. Existing forests 
serve a multitude of functions vital for mankind in 
addition to providing wood as a renewable re-
source. However, it is important to recognize that 
reforestation of areas where forests have previously 
been destroyed does not immediately fulfill all the 
functions of an intact forest. In addition to the dan-
gers of loss of biodiversity and soil erosion that arise 
with deforestation, deforestation releases around 
100 tonnes of carbon per hectare both immediately, 
through biomass burning, and in the longer term, 
through decomposition of biomass and humus. 
Newly afforested areas fix on average around 5-10 
tonnes of carbon per ha per year. Thus, it takes 
decades to fix again the carbon released by de-
forestation. Conservation of forests is therefore of 
paramount importance. 
At present, around 1 billion tonnes of carbon are 
released into the atmosphere annually by forest de-
struction, primarily through anthropogenic activ-
ities as a consequence of growing population and 
rising demand for food and fiber. The total release 
of carbon by anthropogenic activities is of the order 
of 7-8 billion tonnes, of which about 6 billion 
tonnes are released due to burning fossil fuels.

I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
Reforestation of deforested areas is a valid 
counter-measure. Currently, only one million hec-
tares per year are being afforested. In addition to the 
area needed to balance deforestation (according to 
estimates for 1980-85 about 11-12 million ha per 
year), it is estimated that in 20-50 years, very 
roughly, up to 200 million hectares might be 
planted, which would require an average rate of 4-
10 million ha per year. Such an area could store up 
to about 20 percent of present carbon dioxide emis-
sions for a limited time. The area that could be 
afforested, however, depends on several other fac-
tors. Providing food or housing for a growing 
world population will also require areas that cannot 
then be afforested; soil degradation, possibly ampli-
fied by climate change, will reduce the area that 
could usefully be afforested; and the time needed to 
implement these measures might in practice be 
longer than 50 years. These points make it difficult 
to attain a yearly net forest growth goal of 12 mil-
lion hectares per year as set by the Noordwijk Dec-
laration. 
Afforestation costs are highly dependent on the 
specific area, the tree species and local wages. A 
rough global estimate ranges from U.S. $200 to 
$2,000 per hectare. Detailed studies are needed to 
obtain more reliable figures; costs and carbon diox-
ide reduction figures obtainable by afforestation 
should also be compared with other measures possi-
ble in industrialized countries—for example, en-
ergy sector counter-measures. However, this in no 
way limits the usefulness of conservation measures. 
The amount of afforestation required to balance 
total anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions— 
7-8 billion tonnes—would be about 1 billion ha, 
or an area the size of Europe from the Atlantic 
to the Urals. Afforestation on such scale is imprac-
ticable, so that forestry measures can play only a 
minor but significant contributory role in reduc-
ing the buildup of greenhouse gases. It might be 
realistic to achieve a 10-15 percent reduction 
of such emissions. This role is small in comparison 
to the potential emissions of C 0 2 implied by a 
continuing (and even increasing) global reliance on 
fossil fuels. 
Forests may be able to adapt to a rate of tempera-
ture change of around 1 degree C in 100 years, but 
the more rapid changes predicted are likely to have 
deleterious effects, especially in combination with 
additional stress factors such as air pollution. 
The response of forest ecosystems to temperature 
change depends, however, on a great number of 
other parameters (e.g., precipitation, extreme cli-
mates) on which no information is available at the 
moment. Shifts may occur in the ranges and species 
composition of forest communities, together with 
crisis-type 
disturbances 
in development and 
changes in biodiversity and genetic diversity of indi-
vidual species. 
Policies and Measures 
It must be accepted from the outset, however, that 
the ultimate contribution of forestry can only be to 
facilitate a transition from our reliance on fossil 
fuels over the next 50-75 years. Since global warm-
ing could affect the distribution, productivity, and 
health of forests, it is necessary that measures to 
control greenhouse emissions should be taken both 
within and outside this sector. Almost half of the 
man-made increase in atmospheric greenhouse gas 
levels is caused by the burning of fossil energy 
sources. Conservation of fossil fuels and the use of 
alternative energy sources including the use of re-
newable energy sources is therefore essential, as 
well as measures to reduce emissions from fossil fuel 
sources. Changes in energy policies must take ac-
count of the environmental consequences of partic-
ular energy options. 
Forestry policies can be identified which could 
contribute to a global warming response strategy. 
In this context, reducing current deforestation and 
forest degradation should be a first priority. It is 
also vital to make a contribution to the reduction of 
the man-made increase in the greenhouse effect by 
making greater use of wood. The partial replace-
ment of fossil energy sources by wood will reduce 
the emission of additional C O a . Wood in competi-
tion with building material and other material 
whose production requires many times more en-
ergy contributes to energy savings and to maintain-
ing carbon sinks. Wood production from genet-
ically improved trees and intensively managed 
forest can replace fossil fuel carbon with the aid of 
silvicultural and breeding measures. As these mea-
sures can be carried out on substantial areas of exist-
ing forested land, a significant potential will be 
available in the long run. 
Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Human Activities 
89 
Monitoring and Research 
There is a need to strengthen bio-monitoring of 
forests to complement the atmospheric monitoring 
already under way. Standardized methods of for-
estry inventory are required to provide the data 
necessary to manage forests globally. This would 
also mean that studies of production ecology and 
cost/benefit analyses would be comparable across 
forest areas. Major gaps in knowledge include soil 
properties, primary nutrient cycling, and decom-
position in the forest floor. Provided that the im-
pacts of other environmental factors on tree growth 
are not too great and do not counteract the direct 
effects of C 0 2 , it is theoretically possible that in-
creased atmospheric C 0 2 concentrations might in-
crease yield. Appropriate species and provenances 
would be required and suitable silvicultural mea-
sures would have to be adopted to take maximum 
advantage of such a situation. 
Forest Protection 
Fire protection strategies based on fire hazard infor-
mation should be developed and incorporated into 
future management and planning under climatic 
change scenarios. 
Better forest pest protection strategies should 
also be developed. The activity, abundance, and 
distribution of most forest insect and disease spe-
cies, especially in temperate and boreal areas, are 
expected to increase with increasing temperatures. 
Forest Management 
Forest and woodland biomass can be managed by 
maintaining yields of existing forests and by in-
creasing the productivity of native, exotic, and ge-
netically improved species. 
Forest managers and researchers have believed 
that forest renewal, productivity, health, and diver-
sity would be assured by prudent silvicultural prac-
tices. Much of our knowledge and procedures for 
strategic planning and management have been based 
on empirical data such as growth and yield models, 
and the validity of these may be suspect under a 
change of climate. Therefore, a review of current 
silvicultural practices and data is required. 
Land availability and the difficulty of securing 
forests against unsustainable exploitation are im-
portant constraints. However, possibilities exist for 
enhancing land productivity through reforestation 
and improved forest management. These con-
straints can be overcome, provided that local com-
munities share adequately in the benefits from 
forest conservation and reforestation. These include 
provision of employment, access to produce from 
the forest, and benefits associated with effective 
land-use management of adjacent agricultural areas 
that include appropriate agroforestry development. 
Forestry and Agriculture 
Research is needed into the interactions of forestry 
and agriculture in terms of biological, agronomic, 
and economic aspects. In particular, the possi-
bilities of encouraging farm woodland and agro-
forestry 
activities 
need 
further 
consideration. 
Increasing experience with silvi-pastoral and silvi-
arable systems is becoming available and may have 
useful environmental and economic benefits. Par-
ticularly in temperate areas, many countries are 
now looking to farm forestry as a means of control-
ling agricultural surpluses. This trend should also be 
encouraged because of its potential effects on green-
house gas emissions. 
End Uses and Biomass Conversion 
The need and demand for raw materials from forests 
has increased globally, especially in the pulp and 
paper industry. If timber could be utilized more 
effectively and a larger percentage of timber prod-
ucts recycled, less wood would need to be cut from 
forests without resulting in a decrease in industrial 
production. This would leave more standing bio-
mass in the forest over a longer time to sequester 
carbon dioxide. Extension of rotation periods may 
be possible in managed forests. A n alternative 
would be to grow trees for shorter rotations than at 
present, as trees would then be exposed for a shorter 
time to stressful and changing conditions, and the 
carbon could be stored in the end product. Mate-
rials such as concrete, steel, and aluminum could 
often be replaced by wood, which would have the 
added advantage of saving on the energy required in 
the production of these materials and on the conse-
quent carbon emissions. 
Climate stress and damage caused by insects and 
90 
I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
diseases may produce wood with different proper-
ties than the materials now used. How to harvest 
and use such wood needs to be investigated. Carbon 
dioxide emissions from electrical energy production 
are lowest with wood biomass, due to cycling and 
refixation of carbon. Using a sustainably managed 
source of biomass, such as intensive, short-rotation 
fuelwood plantations, biomass energy could pro-
duce net reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. 
However, the use of forest biomass for energy 
should not be promoted to the detriment of forest 
ecosystems. 
Use of logging and milling residues (bark, timber 
residues) should also be considered—for instance, 
in energy production. In many countries, wood is 
still utilized in large quantities for energy purposes, 
and indeed, shortage of wood for firewood is a 
problem in many tropical countries. One aim could 
be to maintain or even increase the usage of wood 
for energy through the development of technology 
under a sustainable management policy. 
Sections 4.2.1-4.2.3 address the issues particular 
to boreal, temperate, and tropical forests. 
4.2.1 
SPECIAL ISSUES O N BOREAL FORESTS 
4.2.1.1 Introduction 
The boreal forest is one of the world's major vegeta-
tion regions, occupying 1,200 million square ha. 
Coniferous species dominate the zone that encircles 
the globe through northern Eurasia and North 
America from about 45N to 75N. The boreal forest 
in North America and eastern Asia contains many 
species not found in the Euro-Siberian region. The 
majority of its soils are covered by ericaceous 
plants, lichens, and moss species in an understory 
that is usually cold, and permafrost is common. The 
dependence of national economies and indigenous 
people on forestry in the boreal region is strong. 
Even with new technology and urbanization, for-
ests and forestry still play major roles in peoples' 
lives, by providing subsistence or recreation. The 
cultures and economies of forest peoples, such as 
the Athabaska Indians and Eskimo of Alaska or 
Nordic Laplanders, are intricately adapted to the 
natural environment and depend upon it for self-
perpetuation. 
4.2.1.2 
Carbon Sinks of the Boreal Region 
A n estimated 25 percent of the global soil carbon is 
contained in boreal forest soils, and significant 
amounts of this carbon will be lost if the lands 
overlying these soils are converted to other uses. In 
addition, drainage of boreal muskegs and peat bogs 
would release more nitrous oxides and carbon diox-
ide as water tables drop, while maintaining high 
water tables in these systems would release more 
methane. 
The boreal forests may be divided into (1) man-
aged, (2) intermediate, and (3) non-managed for-
ests. Nordic countries within the boreal zone 
(Finland, Norway, and Sweden) fit into the first 
category. The total boreal forest area of these coun-
tries is about 50 million ha, and annual removals of 
industrial roundwood and fuelwood are approx-
imately 100 million cubic meters. 
In Canada approximately 55 percent of its boreal 
forest (210 million ha) has been classified as produc-
tive forest. However, only a small part of the pro-
ductive forest is under active forest management; 
thus it is classed as an intermediate forest. Total 
removals of industrial roundwood and fuelwood, 
during 1986, were approximately 115 million cubic 
meters. Within the boreal forest region, the highest 
proportion of non-managed forests are in Alaska 
(USA) and Yakutia (USSR). According to figures, 
Alaska, for instance, has 9 million ha of commercial 
forest land, which is equivalent to less than 10 per-
cent of the total forest area. In Yakutia, the total 
forest area is approximately 150 million ha. Recent 
information from Soviet sources suggests that the 
approximate total boreal forest area in the Soviet 
Union is 600 million ha. 
4.2.1.3 
Consequences of Climate Change 
on Emissions 
The prevailing climate determines the structure and 
function of the boreal forest ecosystem, including 
components of the carbon balance, productivity, 
physiology, insects, diseases, and fire. Current pre-
dictions suggest that in the boreal zone the change 
in temperature will be relatively low in Norway, 
because of its maritime climate, but high in north-
western continental Canada. However, the direct 
and combined effects of C 0 2 enrichment and tern-
Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Human Activities 
91 
perature change on boreal tree species are not fully 
understood. Nutrient cycling, for example, will be 
accelerated by an increase in temperature and could 
increase productivity if accompanied by appropri-
ate moisture. Results obtained in a study carried out 
by Environment Canada (1988) using growth in-
dices, indicated that there would be a northward 
shift of major forest ecosystems by up to several 
hundred kilometers. Similar effects may be ex-
pected in other countries with boreal forests. 
The incidence of forest fire is strongly connected 
to climatic events. Fire has an important role in the 
carbon cycle because it returns carbon to the atmo-
sphere faster than any other process. In Canada the 
occurrence of wildfires has increased dramatically 
over the last ten years. During 1989, over 6 million 
hectares of forest land were consumed by fire. O n 
the basis of the data from previous years the ten-
year average has been about 2 million hectares, 
twice that being burned two decades ago. In addi-
tion to the above-ground biomass, a massive ex-
panse of peatlands and permafrost in northern 
latitudes contains large reserves of carbon. Accord-
ing to the latest estimates, the boreal and arctic 
peatlands contain about 200 billion tonnes of car-
bon (Sjors 1981, Ahlholm and Silvold 1990). The 
warming of these areas will lead to unpredictable 
emissions of carbon in the form of methane and 
carbon dioxide. 
4.2.1.4 Possibilities to Refix Carbon Dioxide: 
A Case Study 
A case study of Finland prepared for the I P C C 
shows the effects of forest management strategies on 
the carbon storage of existing forests. It shows that 
in intensively managed commercial forests it is pos-
sible to affect considerably the carbon storage in 
forests through forest management strategies. 
In the case study the time horizon is fifty years, 
from 1989 to 2039. It is assumed that sequestration 
of fossil fuel emissions during this period could help 
offset fossil fuels used during a transition to alterna-
tive sources of fuel. It is assumed in all the calculated 
alternatives that forests will continue to be utilized 
economically. The production of stemwood during 
the simulation period was not less than that pres-
ently recommended by forest management policies. 
The case study used the forest simulation model 
YSI, developed by Dr. Timo Pukkala, University of 
Joensuu, Finland. A forest management planning 
model based on the YSI simulation model was de-
veloped and it required extensive physical and bio-
logical data from the forest. The basic data for the 
calculations were taken from Finland's national for-
est inventory (1977-84). 
In Finland's forests, the carbon content of the 
stemwood is about 320 million tonnes with a carbon 
content of the total above-ground tree biomass of 
about 590 million tonnes. Under a no-change sce-
nario, about 270 million tonnes more carbon could 
be stored in above-ground biomass by selecting the 
appropriate forest management method supported 
by the model. 
This increment equals the carbon emissions from 
the use of fuel oils in Finland during the next thirty-
nine years, if the annual C-emissions remain at the 
1989 level. If the climate warms up by 2 degrees C 
according to the example and assuming that the 
trees are capable of adapting to the new equilibrium, 
470 million tonnes more of carbon can be stored in 
forests by changing management methods. This 
would equal the total use of fuel oils in Finland 
during the next 67 years. There are alternative strat-
egies for forest management, even in already inten-
sively managed forests, which can considerably 
increase the mean volume and the carbon storage of 
existing forests with little change in economic in-
comes or cutting amount. The net incomes in the 
calculation example will decrease due to delayed 
harvestings by less than 20 percent when discounted 
at 4 percent interest (costs and incomes are calcu-
lated with present prices). Beneficial strategies for 
carbon management could also be found using 
shorter rotations and increased growth. This case 
study demonstrates that it is possible to increase 
carbon storage by changing forest management 
strategies. The study suggests that forest manage-
ment strategies are important response strategies to 
cope with the predicted climate change. It should be 
pointed out that this study offers the best-case 
scenario. 
4.2.1.5 Measures and Policy Options 
Forests may be considered as major indicators of the 
environmental and economic health of boreal forest 
countries. 
92 
I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
4.2.1.5.1 Forest Protection 
Protection activities related to fire, insects, and dis-
eases in the boreal forests will have to be intensified 
to compensate for the changes in species composi-
tion due to northward migration of insects, and 
diseases need to be investigated to ensure timely 
action in maintaining forest health. 
4.2.1.5.2 Forest Management 
Results obtained from genetic trials in different 
countries have indicated that northern seed lots 
transferred southward have survived fairly well; but 
poorer than local trees in warmer climate condi-
tions. This could be directly related to adaptation to 
longer days in more northern regions. There is con-
siderable debate on whether forest land should be 
regenerated artificially or naturally. The approaches 
to this issue depend on whether one deals with 
managed or unmanaged forests and is related to 
economic questions. Recently, in Nordic countries, 
where artificial regeneration has been widely used, 
there have been extensive planting stock losses. 
Given these losses, artificial regeneration must be 
improved to ensure that native species can survive in 
a rapidly changing climate. While our present sil-
vicultural practices have favored monocultures, 
growing conditions could change and mixed stands 
may be favored over the monocultures. It has been 
shown by Mielikainen (1985) that mixed stands 
could be economically valuable in Finland. 
These areas will also serve as carbon reservoirs 
along with other large-scale reforestation projects. 
It should be noted that the market value of the 
forests varies from country to country and changes 
according to the end use of forest products. Within 
the boreal region lie extensive areas of peatlands. In 
Finland, 45 percent of the total forest land is wet-
land, of which about 50 percent has been drained. 
In addition, most boreal regions have discontinuous 
or continuous areas of permafrost and constitute a 
large source of carbon. In these areas, management 
practices should be implemented that restrict the 
release of carbon, especially methane, which is 16 
times more effective as a greenhouse gas than carbon 
dioxide. It should be noted that forestry practices 
change the relation of anaerobic to aerobic condi-
tions in soils that regulate the proportions of meth-
ane and carbon dioxide emissions. 
4.2.1.5.3 
End Uses and Biomass Conversion 
During the ten-year period 1976-86, the demand 
for raw forest materials has increased globally, espe-
cially in North America. To meet the continuous 
demand for these products, the needs of the pulp 
and paper industry will have to be reflected in future 
forest resource management scenarios. Some of that 
demand will be filled through recycling of forest 
products. In the boreal forest the use of a sustain-
able managed source of biomass, such as an inten-
sive short rotation fuelwood plantation, biomass 
energy can produce net reductions in C 0 2 . In addi-
tion, using logging residues (bark, timber residues) 
and black liquor from forest industrial activities 
should be considered in energy production. 
4.2.2 
SPECIAL ISSUES O N TEMPERATE 
FORESTS 
This section deals with temperate forests located in 
Europe (including the Mediterranean area and ex-
cluding Northern Scandinavia), the Middle and 
Near East, Central and East Asia, Australasia, most 
of North America, Chile, and Argentina. The total 
area of temperate zone closed forests is estimated to 
be about 600 million ha or 17 percent of the Earth's 
total closed forest area (3,600 million ha). This sec-
tion focuses on how and to what extent temperate 
forest destruction contributes to the man-made in-
crease in the greenhouse effect and how climate 
change may influence such forest ecosystems, and 
considers measures to protect the forests and to 
increase their capacity to absorb C O a from the 
atmosphere. 
4.2.2.1 Greenhouse Gas Emissions from 
Temperate Forests 
A natural or sustainably managed temperate forest 
is neither a source nor a sink of C 0 2 . At present, 
over large regions the carbon balance is achieved by 
forest growth in one area being offset by loss of 
biomass in another (e.g., by harvesting, wildfires, 
severe storms, etc.). Thus, as long as their total area 
is relatively stable, their contribution to emissions is 
negligible. 
Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Human Activities 
93 
4.2.2.2 Global Warming: Impacts and Effects on 
Temperate Forests 
Climate changes in the post-glacial period have sig-
nificantly altered the composition of forest commu-
nities in temperate zones. Tree species and forest 
types were displaced or changed composition. For-
est communities have been able to adapt within 
certain limits and rates of climate changes, with 
some communities adapting intact and others un-
dergoing changes in species composition. However, 
the rate of climate change now predicted may ex-
ceed these limits by far. 
In temperate zones, human activities have had 
multiple impact on the natural range and composi-
tion of forests. During the course of human history, 
cumulative forest losses amount to about 2 billion 
ha mostly in temperate zones (equivalent to the 
present total tropical forest area). Some regions 
have become poor in forest resources. The remain-
ing forests are thus all the more important, as they 
continue to fulfill multiple functions (e.g., water-
shed protection, habitats, timber production, etc.) 
and maintain biogeochemical cycles. The expected 
climate change is likely to have adverse effects on 
temperate forests and these will be augmented by 
additional risk factors such as air pollution and 
biotic and abiotic stresses. 
The new type of forest damage occurring chiefly 
in the industrialized countries of the temperate 
zones also contributes to the man-made increase in 
the greenhouse effect to an extent not yet quan-
tified, through premature dying of forest stands and 
a reduction of humus and biomass of surviving for-
est stands. Irrespective of the man-made increase in 
the greenhouse effect, measures must be undertaken 
or strengthened to reduce air pollution and its ef-
fects on forests. The aim of adjustment strategies is 
to secure sustained and comprehensive functioning 
of the forest with simultaneous maximum C 0 2 fixa-
tion capacity of forest ecosystems. Forestry mea-
sures, such as selection of site-adequate tree species, 
use of suitable provenances, achievement of stable, 
diverse mixed stands, and preservation of genetic 
diversity, can counteract crisis-type disturbances in 
development to a limited extent only and over long 
periods. But nevertheless, they have to be intro-
duced and/or strengthened now to be effective in 
time. 
Because temperate forest stands tend to be inten-
sively managed, and surplus agricultural land may 
be available, there may be promising opportunities 
to mitigate the greenhouse effect by expanding for-
est biomass in temperate zones. 
4.2.2.3 
Costs of Forestry Countermeasures 
Some forestry adjustment strategies to changed cli-
matic conditions can be carried out without large 
additional costs by adjusting silvicultural measures 
that have to be carried out in any case. The situation 
is different, however, if climate changes result in 
severely reducing the stability of stands and if se-
lected measures for the stabilization of the stand 
have to be taken. Such costs are estimated at ap-
proximately U.S.$5 per hectare per annum. Fur-
thermore, there might be a drastic increase in these 
costs if climate changes require a conversion to 
other tree species. As the degree of the damage 
strongly differs from region to region and as this is 
also true for the type of required forestry adjust-
ment strategies, average costs for such adjustment 
measures cannot be reasonably assessed. 
Determination of costs of reforestation and forest 
management in temperate zones is quite difficult for 
many reasons, including the diversity of situations 
found in countries. For example, besides the objec-
tive of carbon fixation, in many countries afforesta-
tion has to fulfill a productive, protective, and 
recreational function, all at the same time. The spe-
cific objectives and conditions for the respective 
measure strongly influence costs. Afforestation 
costs vary considerably, ranging from approx-
imately U.S.$200 up to $2,000 per hectare, exclud-
ing possible opportunity costs of eliminating the 
present use. 
Stand volume in forests with an open stocking can 
be increased by underplanting measures; the costs 
for such measures amount to approximately 50 to 75 
percent of regular plantation costs. In forests with 
an already relatively closed stocking, the stand vol-
ume can be increased by an extended rotation pe-
riod. Increased expenditure for the required stand 
tending can at a later stage be offset by a considera-
bly higher revenue on account of an improvement in 
the structure of the assortment and the value. Short 
rotation wood crops may also provide high yields 
and give more flexibility in times of climate change.

IPCC RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
4.2.2.4 
Constraints on Forestry Measures 
In the temperate zones there are only a few physical 
constraints on afforestation. They may result from 
continued pollution and, on some sites, also from 
the expected climate changes. The essential con-
straints—above all, in densely populated indus-
trialized nations with intensive land use—are of a 
social nature, and opportunity costs for land use are 
high. Competing demands on land use by nature 
conservation, recreation, settlement, and traffic can 
make a transition to forestry use or afforestations 
considerably more difficult and expensive. As noted 
earlier, surpluses of agricultural products have also 
led to proposals to transfer significant areas of agri-
cultural land to other uses, including forestry. 
Overall, however, many questions remain to be 
answered before the potential contribution of for-
estry response strategies in temperate zones can be 
better quantified. 
4.2.3 
SPECIAL ISSUES O N TROPICAL 
FORESTS 
4.2.3.1 Introduction to Tropical Deforestation 
and Climatic Concerns 
The development and ecological stability of coun-
tries with tropical forests is linked to the health of 
those forests. They contain half of the world's spe-
cies of fauna and flora and provide raw materials, 
sustain rainfall on downwind agricultural land, 
maintain healthy fisheries and water supplies, and 
prevent soil erosion, dam siltation, and flash flood-
ing. Global, regional, and local climate are linked to 
the health of tropical forests. Deforestation may be 
responsible for one-quarter to one-fifth of global 
anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions, one to 
four-tenths of all (natural and anthropogenic) meth-
ane releases, as well as contribute to concentrations 
of nitrous oxides, ozone, carbon monoxide, and 
other gases implicated in global warming. Region-
ally, deforestation may interrupt moisture and la-
tent heat transferred from the tropics to higher 
latitudes, influencing the climate of the temperate 
zone. Locally, partial or total removal of forest 
cover can cause drying of the microclimate, leading 
to an increase in natural fires that prevent natural 
forest regeneration of forests. 
4.2.3.2 Forest Carbon Pools and Forest Cover 
Statistics 
Tropical open forests (relatively dry scrublands and 
woodlands) and closed forests (90 percent of which 
are moist) contain about half of the terrestrial car-
bon pool. The closed forests represent the greatest 
store of carbon. In 1980 closed tropical moist and 
dry forests occupied an area of about 1.2 billion 
hectares. The distribution of this was 679 million, 
217 million, and 306 million ha in Latin America, 
Asia, and Africa, respectively. A small number of 
countries, including Brazil, Burma, Colombia, 
Gabon, Guyana, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, 
Venezuela, and Zaire, contain 80 percent of closed 
moist forest. Open forests occupied about 1.4 bil-
lion hectares. The distribution of this was 929 mil-
lion, 363 million, and 67 million ha in Africa, Latin 
America, and Asia, respectively. Secondary forests 
(forest regrown after 
clearing), 
fallow forest 
(woody vegetation derived from forest clearing for 
shifting agriculture), and plantations do not store as 
much carbon as primary forest. In 1980 regenerat-
ing forest fallow occupied about 408 million ha, 
with 169 million, 166 million, and 73 million ha of 
this distributed in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, 
respectively. Plantations occupied 11.5 million ha, 
the distribution of which was about 5.1 million, 4.6 
million, and 1.8 million ha in Asia, Latin America, 
and Africa, respectively (FAO, 1982). 
4.2.3.3 
Estimates of Current Rates of Forest Loss 
Estimates for the period 1980-85 indicate that 
about 11.3 million ha of tropical forests were annu-
ally cleared and converted to other land uses (Table 
4.2). Approximately 7.5 million ha of the annual 
clearing was in closed forest, with 57 percent, 25 
percent, and 18 percent of this clearing occurring in 
Latin America, Asia, and Africa, respectively. 
About 3.8 million ha of the clearing was in open-
canopy formations, with 62 percent, 33 percent, 
and 5 percent of this clearing occurring in Africa, 
Latin America, and Asia, respectively (FAO, 1988). 
Logging (mostly selectively in closed-moist forests) 
disturbed an additional 5 million ha per year in the 
same period (FAO, 1986). In 1980 the forestation 
(both reforestation and afforestation) 
rate was 
about one tenth of the deforestation rate (about 1.0 
Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Human Activities 
95 
million ha/yr). While forestation has nearly dou-
bled, the ratio to deforestation has remained at 
about one tenth the current rate of deforestation. 
The current rates of forest loss, natural regenera-
tion, reforestation and afforestation and forestation 
in 1990 are subject to debate. One recent, but un-
confirmed study by Myers (1989) indicates that in 
1989 the rate of clearing of closed tropical moist 
forests had doubled to 14 million ha/year. The F A O 
is developing a new survey of forest cover to be 
released in 1991 and by 1992 satellite data assessing 
the status of the world's tropical forests should be 
available from a joint space agency programme led 
by Brazil. 
Table 4.3 lists the closed tropical moist forest 
deforestation rates for the top ten countries in the 
late 1970s based on F A O data and in 1989 based on 
Myers. One recent study (Myers, 1989) undergoing 
further review suggests that there is a trend of in-
creasing deforestation rates, although differences in 
methodologies between the F A O and Myers studies 
may also account for the increase. The change in 
countries on the list and their relative positions may 
indicate the effect of economic, social, and political 
factors on rates of forest loss. 
4.2.3.4 Patterns and Causes of Deforestation 
The three main determinants of deforestation are: 
land conversion for agriculture and pasture; wood 
removals for fuelwood and inappropriate timber 
utilization; and public and private development 
projects (e.g., logging, mining, roads and dams— 
see Table 4.4). In the semi-arid tropics forest loss 
and land use conflicts are associated with natural 
and man-induced desertification. The extent of des-
ertification in Africa, Asia (excluding USSR) and 
Latin America was about 1,536 million ha in the 
early 1980s (WRI etal., 1988). 
Deforestation in the humid tropics is mainly due 
to clearance for agriculture, while in mountain and 
dry regions a substantial portion of the deforesta-
tion may be caused by the need to fell trees for 
fuelwood and fodder. 
Land Conversion for Agriculture and Pasture 
The clearing of tropical forests for cropland and 
pastures is the greatest cause of deforestation. A n 
estimated 6.8 million ha of fallow and 3.9 million ha

of closed forest may be cleared annually for agricul-
ture; 1.3 million ha of fallow and 0.7 million ha of 
closed forest may be cleared for pasture annually 
(Houghton et al., 1985). Figures for open forests are 
not available. The increase in croplands and pas-
tures may have accounted for 40 percent of the 
primary tropical forest conversion between 1980 
and 1985 (FAO, 1987). According to 1980 figures of 
the U.S. Interagency Task Force on Tropical For-
ests, 100 million ha of land, much in the forest, 
could be brought into cultivation by the year 2000. 
The rate of expansion of croplands and pastures 
does not explain the rapid rate of loss of forests. 
Over-cropping and over-grazing may be perma-
nently degrading productive lands, so that they 
must be permanently abandoned and replaced with 
new land cleared from primary forest to maintain a 
given level of agricultural activity (FAO, 1987) (Ta-
ble 4.4). 
Traditional, sustainable long-rotation shifting 
cultivation clears only fallow, so it is in balance with 
respect to carbon. It has largely been replaced by 
short-rotation shifting cultivation that degrades soil 
and other forms of unsustainable agriculture, which 
are expanding into carbon-rich primary forest, pro-
ducing a net source of carbon, in response to grow-
ing populations. 
Wood Removals for Fuelwood and 
Commercial Logging 
Wood removed from tropical forests is used for two 
main purposes: 83 percent is mainly for fuelwood 
and charcoal, and 17 percent is for industrial round-
wood (13 percent for local use and 4 percent for 
export); however, commercial logging practices 
damage a significant percentage of the trees left 
standing, resulting in total forest damage far greater 
than the removal rates entailed in selective logging 
(EC, 1989). 
FUELWOOD 
Studies have led to two contradictory conclusions 
about whether fuelwood collection causes de-
forestation, contributing to the greenhouse effect. 
One recent study suggests that fuelwood harvesting 
accounts for little permanent loss of tree stock, with 
most fuelwood coming either from sustainable fuel-
wood production or from by-products of natural 
death or forest clearing. Considering the net balance 
of greenhouse gas production from wood burning, 
using more energy-efficient wood-burning cooking 
stoves to reduce fuelwood demand may actually 
increase emissions of greenhouse gases overall, 
since these stoves typically raise heat transfer effi-
ciency at the expense of reducing combustion effi-
ciency. As a result, emissions of carbon monoxide 
and more potent greenhouse gases such as methane 
and nitrous oxide may increase relative to the pro-
duction of carbon dioxide, which is a less potent 
greenhouse gas (Leach, 1990). 
By other estimates, demand for wood outstrips 
supply, especially in drier and mountain regions. 
About 0.5 million ha of closed forest and 2.0 million 
ha of fallow forest may be degraded or cleared for 
fuelwood annually (Houghton et al., 1985). 
Whether or not fuelwood collection is presently 
contributing to a net decline in forest cover, it could 
potentially become a more significant source of 
emissions in the future if village wood lot establish-
ment does not keep pace with the anticipated de-
mand. In 1980 planting for fuelwood averaged 
550,000 ha per year, a fifth of the 2.7 million ha that 
was needed to satisfy demand. To meet the pro-
jected fuelwood demand of 55 million ha in 2000, 
2.7 million ha would need to be planted per year, 
given 1980 as a base year (Brown et al., 1988, citing 
John Spears of the World Bank). 
L O G G I N G 
Tropical forests and plantations supply about 10 
percent of the world's demand for timber and pulp. 
Logging for timber occurs mainly in closed forests 
of the humid tropics. By the early 1980s about 13.25 
percent of humid tropical forests had been logged. 
Commercially valuable species account for less than 
10 percent by volume of tropical forests, so logging 
in the tropics is mostly selective over extensive 
areas. Only 2-10 commercially valuable trees are 
removed per hectare, but as many as 30-70 percent 
of the remaining trees are left damaged. If forests are 
allowed to regenerate, the net flux of carbon from 
selective logging may be near zero. Destructive log-
ging practices, however, may damage forest pro-
ductivity and slow regeneration. If logged areas are 
subsequently colonized and used as croplands, as 
happens in many African and Asian countries, the 
net effect is a loss of carbon from the land. Logging 
is expected to increase with growing timber demand 
in the future. 
Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Human Activities 
97 
Public and Private Development Projects 
Although it is recognized that building roads is nec-
essary to develop remote regions, the associated 
timber harvesting, in many cases, may damage the 
forest by opening it to penetration by farmers who 
burn the forest for agriculture. Large-scale develop-
ment projects in the forest, such as flooding for 
hydropower, mining, and use of forest for charcoal 
production to fuel industrial processes such as steel 
smelting, may also cause large amounts of forest 
loss. N o estimates of forest lost from large-scale 
projects are available. 
4.2.3.5 Estimates of Current Emissions from 
Forest Land Clearing 
Estimates of the quantity of carbon dioxide, meth-
ane, nitrous oxide, carbon monoxide, ozone, and 
other gases released when forests are cleared are 
imprecise due to uncertainty about emission fac-
tors, the rate of deforestation, and the amount of 
carbon stored in vegetation and soils, and the effect 
of soil disturbance on the flux of methane and ox-
ides of nitrogen. The data are, however, adequate to 
estimate the range of emissions. 
CARBON 
Generally used estimates of the flux of carbon from 
tropical deforestation range from 0.4 to 2.6 billion 
tonnes of carbon (BTC) per year in 1980 (Houghton 
et al., 1987). In 1989 emissions from tropical de-
forestation may have been 2.0 B T C to 2.8 B T C 
according to certain preliminary estimates by Myers 
(1989). The scientists who addressed the Sao Paulo 
IPCC/RSWG Workshop in January 1990 were rea-
sonably certain that in 1980 emissions were between 
1.0 and 2.0 billion tonnes of carbon and that in 1989 
emissions were between 2.0 and 2.8 billion tonnes 
of carbon. This range of estimates of 0.4 to 2.8 B T C 
is 6-33 percent of total anthropogenic emissions 
and represents 3-16 percent of the contribution 
to total greenhouse gas emissions in the 1980s 
(Houghton, 1989). Soil carbon losses may cause up 
to one third of carbon emissions associated with 
deforestation (Marland, 1988). Over half of 1980 
emissions from deforestation were produced by six 
countries: Brazil, 
Indonesia, Colombia, Cote 
dTvoire, Thailand, and Laos (Figure 4.1). Those 
emissions totaled about 1.2 B T C in 1980. The actual 
emissions listed are subject to debate due to differ-
ences in assumptions about forest biomass and de-
forestation rates. 
M E T H A N E 
Methane emissions from total tropical biomass 
burning (i.e., forests, savanna, and shrub-fallow) 
may range from 40 to 75 million tonnes of carbon 
per year (Houghton, 1989, based on Crutzen). 
Tropical biomass burning may contribute 8-11 per-
cent of the annual global methane flux. This may 
represent about 1-2 percent of the contribution to 
total greenhouse gas emissions in the 1980s.

Long-term projections indicate that if current trends

tropical forests could be deforested in 50 to 100 years, 
releasing 120 to 335 BTC, depending on whether high or 
low biomass estimates are taken (Houghton, 1989).

NITROUS OXIDE 
Nitrous oxide is naturally released from undis-
turbed soils although emission rates are uncertain. 
Higher emission rates are associated with fertilized, 
cleared, and pasture soils. Nitrous oxide is also pro-
duced during uncontrolled biomass burning. 
C A R B O N MONOXIDE AND O Z O N E 
About 5-10 percent of the carbon emitted in bio-
mass burning is in the form of carbon monox-
ide. Although not a greenhouse gas, it indirectly 
increases the concentration of methane. 
The 
oxidation of carbon monoxide also 
produces 
ozone, a greenhouse gas in the lower atmosphere 
(Houghton, 1989). Burning to clear forest in the 
Amazon during the dry season almost triples the 
levels of carbon monoxide and ozone in the atmo-
sphere (Kirchoff et al., 1990). 
4.2.3.6 Estimates of Future Forest Loss and 
Emissions 
Future greenhouse gas emissions are difficult to pre-
dict because of uncertainties about forest biomass, 
as well as population and economic growth rates. 
Two base case emissions projections by Houghton 
(1990b) suggest that emissions could range between 
1.1 and 3.9 B T C in 2020 and 1.2 to 4.9 B T C in 2050. 
The low-bound estimates are from the low base 
case, which assumes low biomass and linear de-
forestation rates. The high-bound estimates are 
from the high base case, which assumes high bio-
mass and population based deforestation rates (Fig-
ure 4.2 and Appendix 4.1). The country-by-
country emissions for these two base cases for 1980 
through 2050 are given in Appendix 4.2. In the 
slowly changing world scenario (i.e., continuing 
poverty, unsustainable agriculture, and population 
growth) the deforestation rate increases with popu-
lation to 34 Mha/yr by 2050, releasing 2 B T C per 
year. As a result, Asia's unprotected forests are 
exhausted. After this date, emissions decline, and 
then fall sharply around 2075 with the loss of re-
maining African and then Latin American forests. 
In a rapidly changing world (i.e., increased agri-
cultural productivity, etc.) 
deforestation 
rates 
might stabilize at 15 million ha per year, releasing 1

would fall as all remaining forests are exhausted. 
Under an ambitious stabilizing policy stopping 
deforestation by 2025, and planting 1000 Mha of 
trees by 2100 in tropical and temperate zones, the 
biosphere would become a carbon sink by 2000, 
with absorption of carbon from the atmosphere 
peaking at 0.7 B T C per year in 2025. 
Under policy option cases modeled by Grainger, 
decreases in the rate of deforestation would be pos-
sible. The high policy option case and low policy 
option case assume declining deforestation based on 
differing levels of improvements in agricultural pro-
ductivity in relation to changes in food consump-
tion per capita. Under the low and high policy case 
options, carbon emissions might be reduced by at 
least 40-70 percent, from between 0.5 (low case) to 
0.8 (high case) B T C in 1980 to between 0.2 (low 
case) to 0.5 (high case) B T C per year in 2020 
(Grainger, 1989a) (Figure 4.2; See Appendix 4.1 for 
assumptions). 
4.2.3.7 Strategies to Reduce Emissions: Types of 
Response Options 
Climate change offers an unusual challenge to forest 
planning and policy development. It is very impor-
tant that countries begin the task of understanding 
the full social and economic consequences of con-
tinued deforestation, and the need to promptly ex-
amine options to slow forest loss. Quantitative and 
qualitative analyses of the costs and benefits of cur-
rent forest policies, and their consequences for 
greenhouse gas emissions, need to be undertaken in 
the next few years. Policy options to control green-
house gas emissions through forestry practices fall 
into three major categories: 
1) Options to reduce forest sector sources of 
greenhouse gases: 
• reduce forest clearing for shifting agriculture 
by substituting sustainable, intensified, sed-
entary techniques, including agroforestry; 
• reduce frequency and amount of forest and 
savanna consumed in biomass burning to 
create and maintain pasture/grasslands; 
• reduce forest loss due to public development 
projects, through environmental planning 
and management; 
• improve efficiency of cookstove and indus-
trial biomass use; 
• reduce damage to standing trees and soils 
during timber harvest; and 
• reduce soil carbon loss, via soil conservation 
farming practices and other management 
techniques. 
2) Maintain existing sinks of carbon in forest sys-
tems: 
• conserve standing forest as stocks of carbon 
through establishment of protected areas 
and sustainable management; 
• introduce sustainable harvesting methods to 
reduce tree damage; and 
• establish sustainable extractive reserves and 
natural forests. 
100 
I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
3) Expand carbon sinks through sustainable for-
est management: 
• improve productivity of existing forest 
lands; 
• establish plantations on available pasture/ 
savanna and cropland, marginal land, de-
graded land; 
• expedite natural regeneration of deforested 
land; and 
• increase soil carbon storage through soils 
management. 
Analyses of the benefits of potential response op-
tions under these three general strategies are sum-
marized below. 
Strategy 1: Options to Reduce Forest Sector 
Sources of Greenhouse Gases 
Reduce forest clearing for shifting and sedentary 
agriculture by substituting sustainable cropping 
systems. One important policy option to slow de-
forestation is to reduce forest clearing for agricul-
ture. One scenario of halting deforestation envis-
ages replacing 80 percent of slash-and-burn with 
sustainable agriculture (Lashof and Tirpak, 1989). 
Expansion of the agricultural frontier into tropical 
forest could be curbed by: 
• introducing crop mixes, planting and manage-
ment systems, and improved genetic strains to 
increase productivity per unit area faster than 
increasing food consumption per capita. Inputs 
of fertilizers, water, and capital at varying levels 
will be necessary to achieve adequate agri-
cultural intensification and sustainability; how-
ever, emphasis should be placed on R & D in 
"higher knowledge, lower external input" agri-
cultural systems, since high-input systems are 
expensive and not feasible in many areas. De-
velopment of cash crops as well as subsistence 
food crops should be emphasized, so that 
farmers may acquire cash needed to invest in 
inputs; 
• focusing agricultural development efforts on 
sites with adequate soils that are alternatives to 
tropical forests, such as savanna, pasture, and 
underutilized croplands; 
• intensifying management on existing pasture to 
increase site productivity, by introducing ap-
propriate technologies such as optimized forag-
ing strategies, fertilization, mechanization, and 
improved livestock management. 
Long-term research in the Peruvian Amazon in-
dicates that for every ha in crop production con-
verted to sustainable practices, 5-10 ha of forest 
might be saved (Table 4.5). Research on sustainable 
systems in Peru, Nigeria, Brazil and elsewhere is 
promising, but needs to assess the potential of large-
scale introductions on a variety of soil types, and to 
assess the net greenhouse gas emission (tradeoffs in 
emissions among gases) benefits of introducing var-
ious competing systems. Wet rice cultivation, while 
very sustainable in the humid tropics, is also a major 
source of methane emissions. Cross sectoral an-
alyses are needed to evaluate the new management 
and biotechnology techniques suggested in the 
A F O S Agriculture Workshop, before specific prac-
tices are recommended. 
Strategy 2: Maintain Existing Sinks of Carbon 
in Forest Systems 
Slowing or halting deforestation may offer the 
greatest net social and ecological benefits, most 
likely at comparatively low costs per ton of carbon 
emissions avoided, of the response options re-
viewed by A F O S (see Figure 4.4). Halting the con-
version of tropical forests would immediately 
reduce C 0
2 emissions by perhaps 1-3 BTC per 
year, depending on actual current emission rates.

The expansion of protected tropical forest has accel-
erated since 1970 from very low levels. Substantial 
new areas of existing forest could be designated for 
protection from encroachment. Expansion of pro-
tected areas could also assist developing countries to 
conserve the tropical biodiversity for long-term 
socio-economic benefits. 
Non-destructive resource use in extractive re-
serves, where rubber, nuts, and other products are 
harvested for market without cutting forest, could 
be greatly expanded, if markets are developed and 
land is legally protected, following Brazil's progres-
sive experiments in Amazonia. Identification of 
new protected area should take into account the 
effects of and changes in forest conservation needs 
that would accompany climate change, such as the 
need for species migration corridors.

Widespread introduction of sustainable timber and 
forest product extraction techniques from the pri-
mary forest that damage fewer trees left standing 
than current methods would help assure long-term 
carbon storage. Improved forest management could 
increase forest productivity. Approximately 137 
million ha of logged forest could benefit from en-
richment planting and regeneration because current 
selective logging techniques reduce long-term pro-
ductivity by damaging 30-70 percent of the species 
left behind (Grainger, 1989b).

lishment of plantations on degraded lands to play a 
role in absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmo-
sphere. 
There are two estimates of land available for for-
estation. According to Grainger (1989b), a total of 
621 million ha of land may be available for foresta-
tion in the tropics. Of this total, 418 million ha are 
in the dry and montane regions and 203 million ha 
are forest fallow in the humid areas. According to 
Houghton (1990a), up to 865 million ha of land in 
the tropics are available for forestation. Of this to-
tal, there may be about 500 million ha of abandoned 
lands that previously supported forest in Latin 
America (100 million ha), Asia (100 million ha), and 
Africa (300 million ha). The additional 365 million 
ha could be available only if increases in agricultural 
productivity allowed this land to be removed from 
production. If this upper estimate of 865 million ha 
102 
I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
of potentially available land were reforested, a total 
of 150 million B T C could be removed from the 
atmosphere after forest maturation (Houghton, 
1989). 
Two types of forest could be created: 
• protection forests (for watershed protection/ 
erosion control; ecosystem restoration; preser-
vation; carbon stock; biodiversity), and 
• production forests (biofuel plantations; indus-
trial timber; agroforestry; community wood-
lots; carbon pump). 
The Sao Paulo workshop members concluded 
that local fuelwood and shelterbelt options may be 
cost effective, but may lack potential for a major 
global impact. Agroforestry is believed to have both 
low costs and substantial global potential. Biofuel 
and industrial options are believed to have higher 
costs, but large global potential. Unfortunately, es-
tablishing plantations in the next few decades is 
unlikely to stop the spread of unsustainable logging 
in natural forest, since the growth of mature species 
of wood quality comparable to natural forests may 
take 30 to 70 years. 
2. A F F O R E S T A T I O N 
S C E N A R I O S 
A wide variety of afforestation options could be 
pursued on a global basis. For example, three sce-
narios of replanting evaluated by Grainger (1989b) 
include planting 6 million ha/year over 10 years, 8 
million ha/year over 20 years, or 10 million ha/year 
over 30 years to offset 5 percent, 13 percent, or 26 
percent of the 5.5 B T C currently released from 
burning fossil fuels annually (Table 4.6). The esti-
mated costs total $2.4, $3.0 or $4.0 billion per year, 
respectively (Table 4.7). Options trading-off time 
and money to reach specific planting targets are 
presented in Table 4.7. The shorter the time-frame 
to reach a given level of planting and carbon uptake, 
the higher the annual cost of planting. The 13 per-
cent reduction scenario achieved over 20 years 
would lead to an additional annual harvest of 2.6 
billion cubic meters, which would allow global for-
est production to meet the anticipated demand for 
wood in 2030 (Grainger, 1989b). 
National and global scale forestation scenario 
building to offset climate change is currently limited 
by incomplete and not widely representative tree 
growth rate, forest standing biomass, and establish-

ment cost data. Present estimates may be high or 
low by a factor of 3-10, especially if economies of 
scale are realized. For example, recent cost esti-
mates in the United States for a 20-million-ha fed-
eral planting programme have declined by about 40 
percent during programme analysis and design, as 
better data became available. In the United States, 
estimated tree establishment costs for a 5 percent 
C 0 2 offset programme involving about 12 million 
ha have now come down to around U.S.$320/ha. 
Such a programme could capture carbon at about $9 
per ton carbon (most likely a very low cost per ton, 
compared with other options available), according 
to the U.S. Forest Service.

3. IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY OF EXISTING FOREST 
LANDS 
If more species and size classes of trees were used 
for timber, then efficient harvest and management 
would be more feasible, and less extensive areas 
would be logged. Development of technologies and 
marketing methods to promote greater use of lesser-
known species, using harvests based on detailed 
forest inventories and management plans, would 
improve yields per unit area. 
4.2.3.8 Policy Options 
National Level Policy Options Available to 
Improve Forest Management in Response to 
Climate Change 
Because of the important role of the forestry sector 
in ecological cycles and economic development, 
there is a need to develop recommendations at both 
national and international levels. Although uncer-
tainties about the rate and extent of climate change 
remain, the following are a number of steps that 
nations could take: 
1) In the context of the review of the Tropical 
Forestry Action Plan currently under way, 
adopt clear objectives for the conservation, 
and/or sustainable development of tropical 
forests in national development plans, includ-
ing forests associated with agricultural lands, 
commercial-use forests, and extractive re-
serves and other protected areas; and reconcile 
conflicts between current forest management 
and programmes proposed and initiated under 
TFAP. 
2) Strengthen tropical forest management use of 
near real-time remote sensing analysis of bio-
mass burning and of forest loss patterns. Co-
ordinate national and multilateral space and 
development agency imagery programme data 
collection and analysis with national forestry 
regulatory and enforcement programmes. 
3) Estimate current and future emissions of 
greenhouse gases from the tropical forest sec-
tor, and potential reductions of emissions 
from various offset planting and management 
scenarios. 
4) Produce and implement national forestation 
plans for degraded tropical forest lands, based 
on cost, feasibility, and true net social benefits 
analyses. 
International Response Options Available to 
Slow Forest Loss and Stimulate Forestation 
A number of response options are available that 
were specifically identified at the Brazil workshop. 
These include: 
1. DEVELOPMENT OF A WORLD FOREST 
CONSERVATION PROTOCOL IN THE CONTEXT 
OF A CLIMATE CONVENTION PROCESS THAT 
ALSO ADDRESSES ENERGY SUPPLY AND USE. 
The A F O S Sao Paulo Workshop final statement rec-
ommended, after discussion and agreement in plen-
ary, that the IPCC support the development of a 
global forestry protocol to apply to tropical forests 
as well as temperate and boreal forests in all coun-
tries, in the context of a climate convention process 
that also addressed energy supply and use. The state-
ment agreed upon at the Sao Paulo workshop for a 
workshop recommendation calling for development 
of a World Forest Conservation Protocol was: 
Consideration of forestry issues, and of tropical 
forestry issues in particular, must not distract at-
tention from the central issue of global climate 
change and the emission of greenhouse gases at-
tributable to the burning of fossil fuels by devel-
oped countries. N o agreement on forests and 
global climate change will be reached without 
commitments by developed countries on green-
house gas emissions. The groups recognized that 
the conservation of tropical forests is of crucial 
importance for global climatic stability (partic-
ularly having regard to the important contri-
bution of tropical forest destruction to global 
warming, through emissions of carbon dioxide, 
methane, and other trace gases), but of more cru-
cial importance for national economic and social 
development, for the conservation of biodiversity 
and for local and regional climatic and environ-
mental reasons. The Workshop recommended 
that the IPCC support the development of a for-
estry protocol in the context of a climate conven-
tion process that also addressed energy supply and 
use. The Workshop concluded that the specific 
elements of such a protocol are a matter for inter-
national negotiations. These elements may in-
clude: fundamental 
research, 
tropical forest 
planning, measures to use, protect, and reforest, 
104 
I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
international trade, financial assistance and the 
advantages and disadvantages of national and in-
ternational targets. 
The objective should be to present more con-
crete proposals on the occasion of the U N Con-
ference on Environment and Development, to be 
held in 1992. 
In light of the above, it is recommended that a 
World Forest Conservation Protocol, covering 
temperate, boreal, and tropical forests, be devel-
oped in the context of a climate convention process 
that also addresses energy supply and use, as noted 
by the January 1990, I P C C / R S W G Tropical Forest 
Workshop in Sao Paulo, Brazil and that in accor-
dance with U N G A Resolution 44/207, operative 
paragraph 10, a meeting of interested countries 
from both the developed and developing world and 
of appropriate international agencies be held to 
identify possible key elements of such protocols and 
practical means of implementing them. Such a meet-
ing should also develop a framework and methodol-
ogy for analyzing the feasibility of the Noordwijk 
remit, including alternative targets, as well as the 
full range of costs and benefits. 
All countries should make a contribution to the 
solution of the global warming problem. The Sao 
Paulo Workshop stated: 
Although forests can assist in mitigating the ef-
fects of atmospheric carbon build-up, the prob-
lem is essentially a fossil fuel one and must be 
addressed as such. In this way, and as a general 
principle, the final report of the present I P C C 
Workshop on Tropical Forests, while putting 
tropical forests in the overall context of global 
warming, should make it clear that the burden of 
response options is not to be placed on develop-
ing countries and thus should state clearly that all 
countries should make a contribution to the solu-
tion of the global warming problem. The temper-
ate forest dieback (caused by acid rain), as 
analogous to tropical deforestation (caused by 
tropical people's attempts to satisfy basic human 
needs), could be specifically mentioned in such a 
context. 
It should however be noted that recent findings 
indicate that forests may be adversely affected 
throughout the world by a variety of causes, only 
one of which is acid deposition. 
The Sao Paulo Workshop further noted: 
Forests cannot be considered in isolation, and 
solutions must be based on an integrated ap-
proach which links forestry to other policies, 
such as those concerned with poverty and land-
lessness. The forest crisis is rooted in the agri-
cultural sector and in people's needs for em-
ployment and income. Deforestation will be 
stopped only when the natural forest is economi-
cally more valuable than alternative uses for the 
same land. 
2. SUMMARY OF O T H E R OPTIONS IDENTIFIED BY 
SAO P A U L O WORKSHOP SESSIONS 
a) Increase Support for Tropical Forestry Action 
Plan (TFAP). 
T F A P offers the framework within which na-
tional plans for heightened forest management 
can be developed. Priorities within the TFAP 
could be reviewed by member countries and 
F A O to consider how they can be strength-
ened to address climate change concerns. 
Meeting resource needs for T F A P should be a 
priority. 
b) International Tropical Timber Organization 
(ITTO). 
Consideration should be given to strengthen-
ing the role of ITTO to develop international 
guidelines to encourage: 
• sustainable forest management techniques, 
including national legislation requiring man-
agement of forest for sustained wood pro-
duction; 
• an assessment of incentives for sustainable 
forest management including the feasibility 
of labeling. 
c) Development Assistance Organizations and 
Development Banks. 
The 
development 
banks—IMF, F A O , 
UNEP—and other multilateral or bilateral in-
ternational organizations could help tropical 
forest countries achieve conservation and sus-
tainable development of forests by: 
• requiring analyses of climate change impli-
cations, potential greenhouse gas emissions, 
and forestry response programmes in their 
review of project proposals; 
• expanding greatly aid and investment flows 
to forestry; 
Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Human Activities 
105 
• expanding debt relief via renegotiation of 
debt, and debt for conservation exchanges; 
and 
• linking structural adjustment measures to al-
leviation of climatic impacts and gas emis-
sions reductions. 
d) Role of International Forestry Organizations. 
International forestry organizations have, as a 
rule, not yet developed programmes or guide-
lines to member states on forestry and climate 
change. 
Potential institutional initiatives 
could include: 
• adding forestry and climate research and de-
velopment programmes to the C G I A R sys-
tem (Consultative Group on International 
Agricultural Research), at least one on each 
major tropical continent, to conduct and 
disseminate research results and beneficial 
field practice guidelines to foresters re-
managing forests for adaptation to and mit-
igation of climate change; 
• urging International Union of Forestry Re-
search Organizations (IUFRO) to develop a 
coordinated set of research programmes on 
technical silvicultural, ecological, and man-
agement issues pertaining to climate change.

Agricultural activities currently produce approx-
imately 14 percent of the greenhouse gases emitted 
globally. Agriculture is a significant contributor to 
the increasing atmospheric concentrations of car-
bon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, and to 
emissions of nitric oxide and carbon monoxide. In 
the development of options to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions from agricultural activities, it is im-
portant to recognize that the economies of many 
developing countries are strongly dependent on ag-
riculture. 
Agricultural systems need to be assessed as whole 
systems. Their potential as sinks for carbon and 
nitrogen must be evaluated, as well as their role as 
sources. Trade-offs of the various gases need to be 
evaluated, and the systems' capacities to alter car-
bon and nitrogen cycles must be examined. In addi-
tion, the systems must be evaluated in terms of 
energy inputs and losses from sectors providing 
goods and services, production, storage, transpor-
tation, processing, and marketing. 
4.3.1 
SUMMARY OF AGRICULTURAL 
EMISSIONS OF GREENHOUSE GASES 
Agriculture contributes to the emissions of green-
house gases through the following 
practices: 
flooded rice cultivation, nitrogen fertilizer use, ru-
minant animals, improper soil management, land 
conversion, and biomass burning. The appendix to 
this section illustrates the level of emissions and 
agricultural activities on a country by country basis. 
Globally, rice cultivation, ruminant animals, and 
biomass burning are estimated to contribute ap-
proximately 15, 9, and 8 percent respectively, of 
total methane production; methane, in turn, ac-
counts for about 20 percent of current greenhouse 
gas emissions. The use of nitrogen fertilizers is esti-
mated to account for between 0.2 and 20 percent of 
the current global source of nitrous oxide, nitrous 
oxide representing 5 percent of current greenhouse 
gas emissions. Land clearing and biomass burning 
contribute between 10 and 30 percent of current 
greenhouse gases, contributing to increases in emis-
sions of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxides, 
and carbon monoxide. Emissions from these 
sources are expected to increase substantially over 
the next several decades due to population and eco-
nomic growth and the associated expansion and in-
tensification of agricultural activities. 
• Population is estimated to grow at an average of 
1.3 percent per year, with global population 
reaching 8.2 billion by 2025. 
• The land area in cropland or pasture is increas-
ing while global forest area is declining. 
• Area under cultivation in developing countries 
is projected to increase at a rate of 1.2 percent 
per year through 2025, which would result in a 
50 percent increase in current levels by 2025. 
• Area devoted to rice cultivation is projected to 
increase from 148 million hectares in 1984 to 
200 million hectares by 2025 globally. Methane 
106 
I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
from rice cultivation may increase nearly 35 
percent by the year 2025. 
• Production of meat and dairy products is pro-
jected to increase by over 45 percent between 
1990 and 2025 and to result in a similar increase 
in methane emissions. 
• In general, land under cultivation is being more 
intensively cultivated, and the intensity of ni-
trogen fertilizer use is increasing. Nitrogen fer-
tilizer use is estimated to increase by a factor of 
five over 1985 levels by 2025 in developing 
countries (see Table 4.8). Globally, fertilizer 
use is projected to nearly double over the same 
time frame. Nitrous oxide emissions could in-
crease by 70-110 percent, although technologi-
cal advances in fertilizer formulations may 
significantly reduce these potential increases. 
• Emissions of methane are estimated to increase 
from 511 million metric tonnes in 1985 to about 
730 million metric tonnes in 2025. 
• Agricultural sources will be contributors to 
these increases. In addition, emissions of ni-
trous oxide may increase from 12.4 million 
tonnes in 1985 to some 16 million tonnes in 
2025. Fertilizer use may play a large role in this 
increase (Figure 4.5).

MEASURES A N D POLICY OPTIONS 
Future agricultural practices and policies can affect 
the levels of greenhouse gas emissions from agri-
cultural sources and contribute to stabilization of 
their atmospheric concentrations. However, reduc-
ing emissions from one or two sources will not be 
sufficient. For example, in order to stabilize meth-
ane concentrations, reductions in methane emis-
sions from flooded rice fields, livestock systems, 
and biomass burning as well as from other anthro-
pogenic sources, will be necessary. Similarly, mod-
ifications in nitrogen fertilizer use, land use 
conversion, and crop systems will be necessary 
parts of multisectoral strategies to achieve the re-
ductions to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of 
carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide. 
The opportunities for reducing gas emissions in 
the near-term which appear to be economically via-
ble in their own right consist of the following: 
• Biomass burning: 
Biomass burning might be 
reduced through fire control, education and 
management programmes, as well as the intro-
duction of the use of appropriate alternative 
agricultural practices. Agricultural systems de-
pendent on the removal of biomass (by burning 
high-yield grain crops) may be modified to pro-
vide opportunities for increasing soil organic 
matter and reduction of greenhouse gas emis-
sions or removal for use as an alternative fuel 
source. 
• Livestock systems: Methane emissions can be 
reduced through management of livestock 
wastes; expansion of supplemental feeding 
practices for livestock; and increased use of 
production- and growth-enhancing agents, 
with appropriate safeguards for human health 
and taking into account legitimate consumer 
concerns. 
• Fertilizer 
use: Nitrous oxide emissions may be 
reduced by using improved fertilizer formula-
tions and application technologies, and through 
judicious use of animal manure. 
• Sustainable 
agricultural 
practices: Where ap-
propriate, minimum- or no-till systems are rec-
ommended for those countries currently using 
tillage as part of the annual cropping sequence. 
These tillage systems may yield additional ben-
_ _ _ _ _ _ 4 ^ j P r o j e c t e d Emissions of Greenhouse Gases 
107 
108 
I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
efits such as direct energy savings, improved 
soil tilth and increase of soil organic matter. 
• Marginal 
lands: Areas marginally suitable for 
annual cropping systems should be shifted to 
perennial cover crops for fodder or pastoral 
land uses of woodlands, if soils are suitable. 
Such actions could increase carbon uptake, 
both in the vegetation and soil, and could yield 
other benefits such as reduced soil erosion, im-
proved water infiltration and quality, and de-
layed stream flow. 
Longer-Term Options Requiring Research 
and Demonstration 
Several opportunities for reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions and enhancing carbon sinks have been 
identified for the longer term. In general, these op-
portunities must be developed, demonstrated, and 
assessed in terms of greenhouse gas reductions and 
the full range of potential costs and benefits. These 
alternatives must maintain or enhance the produc-
tivity of the agricultural systems. This will require 
substantial research efforts focused on better under-
standing of the processes by which these gases are 
emitted, further investigation of promising options, 
and better field measurement devices. 
General opportunities for reducing emissions of 
these gases have been identified: 
• A comprehensive approach including manage-
ment of water regimes, development of new 
cultivars, efficient use of fertilizers, and other 
management practices could lead to a 10-30 
percent reduction in methane emissions from 
flooded rice cultivation, although substantial 
research is necessary to develop and demon-
strate these practices. A 10 percent reduction in 
emissions from rice systems might contribute 
about 15-20 percent of the total reduction re-
quired to stabilize atmospheric concentrations 
of methane. 
• Through a number of technologies it appears 
that methane emissions from livestock systems 
may be reduced by up to 25-75 percent per unit 
of product in dairy and meat production. The 
net effect of such improvements depends upon 
the extent to which such methods can be ap-
plied to domestic ruminant populations, which 
will vary greatly from country to country. 
However, each 5 percent reduction from ani-
mal systems could contribute 6-8 percent to-
ward the reduction necessary to stabilize 
methane in the atmosphere. 
• Fertilizer-derived emissions of nitrous oxide 
potentially can be reduced (although to what 
extent is uncertain) through changes in prac-
tices such as using controlled-release fertilizers, 
improving fertilizer-use efficiency, and adopt-
ing alternative agriculture systems. 
• Trace gas emissions from biomass burning, 
land conversion, and cropping systems may be 
reduced through widespread adoption of im-
proved agricultural practices, optimizing use of 
fertilizer and organic amendments, and im-
proved pasture management and grazing sys-
tems. These gains may be offset by pressures of 
increasing population and increased demand for 
food and fiber production. In addition, policies 
associated with production, processing, stor-
age, transportation, and marketing need to be 
examined to derive the optimum effectiveness 
from research, technological developments, 
and land use practices. Analyses are needed on 
economic incentives, taxes, pricing and trade 
barriers, cultural practices, technology transfer 
measures, education and information pro-
grammes, and international financial assistance 
measures. 
4.3.3 
INTERNATIONAL A N D INSTITUTIONAL 
NEEDS 
A broad range of institutional issues must be ad-
dressed in order to ensure that the objectives of 
increased global food security and reduced green-
house gas emissions can be met in the future. 
Among the options that governments, international 
organizations and intergovernmental bodies such as 
I P C C should consider are the following: 
• A series of agricultural workshops to assess new 
information on agricultural production and 
emission forecasts, exchange information on 
the effectiveness of new technologies and man-

impact of agricultural policies. These agri-
cultural workshops should address the institu-
tional and economic issues particular to the ma-
jor agricultural sources of emissions, such as 
biomass burning, temperate agricultural prac-
tices, livestock emissions, and emissions from 
rice cultivation. 
• A n international symposium in 1991 or 1992 to 
assess current information on agricultural 
greenhouse gas emissions, practices, technol-
ogy transfer, and extension service require-
ments. 
• Guidelines for future research at national and

institutions 
such 
as F A O ,

vestigate impacts of climate change and options 
for reducing emissions.

biomass burning, its contribution to green-
house gas emissions, and practices and policies 
to reduce emissions.

SUMMARIES FROM AGRICULTURAL

More specific findings and recommendations are 
presented in the following sections. These are sum-

4.3.4.1 Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Flooded 
Rice Cultivation 
Flooded rice fields are a major source of methane on 
a global scale, due to microbial anaerobic decay of 
organic matter. While uncertainty exists as to the 
exact contribution to the annual global emissions, 
they appear to be of the order of 25-170 million 
metric tonnes or 6-30 percent of annual global 
methane emissions. 
In addition, methane emissions from flooded rice 
fields may increase by as much as 20 percent in the 
next decade, since rice production must increase to 
meet the rice requirements of growing human pop-
ulations. Rice production is projected to increase 
from the current level of 458 million tonnes to over 
550 million tonnes by the year 2000, and to some 
760 million tonnes by the year 2020. 
Measures and Policy Options 
Reductions in methane emissions from flooded rice 
fields should be obtained while maintaining the pro-
ductivity of the rice fields in all instances. In the 
long run, a comprehensive approach, including 
management of water systems, cultivar develop-
ment, efficient fertilizer (both organic and mineral) 
use, and other management practices could achieve 
reductions of 10-30 percent. However, current un-
derstanding of the complex interaction between 
methane production and oxidation, and the flux 
between the atmosphere and the rice fields, is insuf-
ficient. This understanding is a prerequisite for de-
termining potential options for reducing methane 
emissions from flooded rice fields. 
Improved understanding of the process contrib-
uting to methane emissions from flooded rice fields 
can only be achieved by integrated, interdisciplin-
ary projects that focus on process-related factors 
and that will allow for valid extrapolation. Research 
is needed on the following aspects: 
• Biogeochemistry of methanogenesis in flooded 
rice fields including methane production, meth-
ane oxidation, and methanogenesis regulation 
factors. 
• Factors affecting methane fluxes from flooded 
rice fields, such as climate, soil and water, culti-
vars, fertilizer application, and cultural prac-
tices and variations in fluxes spatially, season-
ally, and diurnally. 
• Effects of techniques to reduce methane emis-
sions of nitrous oxide. 
• Field level measurement techniques to assess 
spatial variability, and simulation models to 
synthesize the process and field level data. 
Technologies and practices for reducing emis-
sions from flooded rice fields need to be devel-
oped, demonstrated and assessed, including an 
evaluation of the costs and benefits. Further-
more, to realize the full potential of the re-
search, existing and possible agricultural poli-
cies regarding rice production need to be exam-
ined. 
4.3.4.2 
The Role of Managed Livestock in the 
Global Methane Budget 
Ruminant animals produce methane as part of the 
digestive process. Total methane emission from the 
digestive processes of domestic ruminant animals 
have been estimated to be between 60 and 100 mil-
lion metric tonnes per year, accounting for about 15 
percent of the global methane emissions, second 
only to flooded rice field systems. These estimates 
suffer from several notable uncertainties that may 
cause overestimated emissions in some areas and 
underestimates in others, resulting in an overall un-
derestimation of methane emissions, possibly by 
large amounts. 
In addition, animal wastes from all sources are 
another potentially large source of methane emis-
sions. Under anaerobic waste management systems 
(animal wastes under aerobic conditions do not pro-
duce methane), uncontrolled methane emissions 
from cattle wastes are likely to be of the same mag-
nitude as methane emissions from the livestock di-

gestive process. Preliminary analyses indicate that 
emissions from the source may currently be of the 
order of 65-100 million tonnes globally or about 15 
percent of the methane from livestock digestive pro-
cesses. Emission estimates from livestock systems 
should be refined, particularly in areas where inter-
ventions and methane control are most likely to be 
cost effective. 
Measures and Policy Options 
Reducing emissions from livestock is a particularly 
attractive methane reduction option because it is 
usually accompanied by improved animal produc-
tivity. While there are considerable differences in 
feed conversion efficiency between extensively and 
intensively managed animals, several techniques are 
available that might reduce emissions per unit of 
product (e.g., per kilo of meat or liter of milk) by up 
to 25-75 percent. However, the reductions actually 
achieved will of course depend on the extent to 
which and how effectively the appropriate technol-
ogies can be deployed. Furthermore, it is recog-
nized that emission reductions achievable with the 
best technologies and their socio-economic conse-
quences will vary within and among countries with 
variations in animal, management, and feeding 
characteristics. 
Near-Term Options 
Technologies available in the near term are: 
• Animal wastes. Indications are that methane 
recovery through management of animal wastes 
can be economic in its own right under certain 
conditions. 
• Supplemental feeding practices. Methane emis-
sions can be substantially reduced (perhaps by 
60 percent) from livestock on poor diets by 
strategic supplementation with locally pro-
duced feed additives. Experience in India indi-
cates that the supplementation system can be 
self-sustaining and economic investment. 
• Productive enhancing agents. Current eco-
nomic evaluations indicate that the use of 
bovine somatotropin (BST) could improve feed 
conversion efficiency and is economically feas-
ible at this time, taking into account human 
concerns on the use of BST. 
While currently available, these technologies and 
practices must be further developed, demonstrated, 
and assessed in terms of the full range of cost reduc-
tions, other potential benefits and risks. 
Longer-Term Options 
Additional avenues exist for methane reduction in 
the longer term: 
• Strategic supplementation of extensively man-
aged cattle. Pastoral cattle management can re-
sult in relatively low animal productivity in 
some cases. Providing strategic supplementa-
tion of nutrients to these animals could reduce 
methane emissions by increasing efficiency and 
112 
I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
productivity per animal and achieving produc-
tion targets with smaller herds. 
• Diet modification for intensively managed ani-
mals. Current research indicates that methane 
emissions vary under different diets. Increasing 
the intake of animals and modifying the compo-
sition of their diet can reduce emissions per unit 
of product. Other feed inputs such as whole 
cotton seeds or polyunsaturated fats also appear 
to have promising impacts on methane emis-
sions levels. Modifying feeding practices could 
potentially reduce methane emissions by large 
amounts in certain circumstances. However, 
size and location of animal populations for 
which this is a promising alternative must be 
identified. 
• Reduction of protozoa. Recent studies indicate 
that reduced protozoa in ruminant digestive 
systems results in lower methane emissions and 
may enhance animal productivity. Further 
promising avenues consist of improvements in 
reproductive efficiency, which lead to smaller 
brood herd requirements and microbiological 
approaches to improved digestion processes. 
Again, these technologies and practices must be 
further developed, demonstrated, and assessed 
in terms of costs, reductions, and other poten-
tial benefits. Also, techniques for field level 
measurements of methane from livestock need 
to be developed and standardized. 
4.3.4.3 
Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Tropical 
Agriculture 
Sources 
Tropical agricultural systems include traditional 
fallow-cropping 
system, 
conventional 
high-
production systems, agroforestry systems, and 
agropastoral systems. 
A n assortment of agriculture activities contribute 
to greenhouse gas emissions in the tropics. Tropical 
flooded rice fields and cattle are major sources of 
these gases. 
The remainder of tropical emissions are due pri-
marily to biomass burning, either to convert forest 
and savanna ecosystems into arable land or pas-
tures, to return nutrients to the soil, to reduce 
shrubs on rotational fallow lands, or to remove crop 
residues. In all instances associated with biomass 
burning, emissions of greenhouse gases are not well 
estimated and no consistent measurement tech-
niques are now in use. Furthermore, no estimates 
have separated temperate from tropical sources. Ini-
tial estimates put total nitrous oxide emissions at 5-
15 percent of global emissions; contributions of 
C 0 2 are estimated at 20-40 percent of global emis-
sions, and contributions of N O x at 10-35 percent of 
global emissions. Agriculturally related emissions 
of methane are perhaps best characterized and esti-
mated. They are dominated by rice and livestock 
production, with a potentially large, but uncertain 
percentage from biomass burning. Methane contri-
butions from burning are estimated at 20-80 million 
tonnes per year, or 5-13 percent of the total meth-
ane emissions. There is less certainty regarding the 
emission of carbon dioxide from agriculture, and 
the relative contribution of each of the major 
sources: land-use conversion, biomass burning, 
and soil degradation. The greatest uncertainties 
are in the area of nitrous oxide emissions, although 
initial estimates are of 5-15 percent of the global 
total. 
Measures and Policy Options 
Policy options must have value to the farmer be-
yond the greenhouse-gas-reducing benefits. Poli-
cies must not hamper national food security goals or 
distort competition on the world market. The pres-
sure to convert land to crop and pasture use needs 
to be reduced, thus reducing emissions from burn-
ing, soil exposure, and erosion. Increasing the 
productivity of croplands on suitable soils using 
appropriate agricultural practices will have that ef-
fect. Reclaiming and restoring degraded agricultural 
lands should also be explored, in addition to en-
hancing the indigenous uses of native forests and 
establishing forest cropping systems that reduce the 
demand for further deforestation. Policies that in-
crease efficiency in the use of water, fertilizer, and 
crop residues as well as the use of nitrogen-fixing 
crops should also be pursued. Incentives may be 
useful in encouraging the use of improved fertilizers 
and in abandoning the use of mechanized deforesta-
tion. Land-tenure policies need to be evaluated to 
provide an incentive to limit the conversion of moist 
forest ecosystems to agricultural ecosystems. Edu-
cation programmes that teach improved organic-
residue management and provide an understanding 
about the consequences of soil degradation need to 
Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Human Activities 
113 
be developed and proliferated. Some options for 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions include: 
• Conversion of forest land to agricultural, as 
widely practiced in the tropics, may be reduced 
by adopting sustainable agricultural practices 
that optimize yields, or by adopting intensive 
practices on suitable agricultural soils. 
• Reduction of emissions from burning crop resi-
dues and the routine burning of savannas 
through sustainable agriculture, including use 
of chemical and organic amendments, and im-
proved forage species and management sys-
tems. 
• Enhancement of soil-carbon storage by the use 
of different vegetation covers and cropping sys-
tems, including agroforestry systems. Agrofor-
estry systems may also increase above-ground 
carbon storage, in addition to stabilizing soil 
and providing firewood. 
• Limitation of fertilizer-derived emissions of ni-
trous oxide by use of fertilizers with slower 
conversion rates that are more in accord with 
crop requirements or that have been technically 
engineered to conform to rates of plant uptake. 
Improving fertilizer application for crops and 
adoption of alternative agricultural systems, 
such as agroforestry, also have some promise in 
this regard. Collaborative research among sci-
entists in developing countries is needed to en-
sure consideration for regional and local 
physical and cultural factors, with special focus 
on carbon and nitrogen cycling, burning prac-
tices, and soils. 
In addition, research is required in the following 
areas: 
• Nitrous oxide emissions from fertilizer and le-
guminous crops across a broad range of crop-
ping systems. 
• Remote-sensing and monitoring methodology 
development is needed to evaluate the effects of 
policies to reduce these practices. 
• Better estimates are needed on amounts of bio-
mass burned annually, instantaneous emissions 
from the fire front, and longer-term biogenic 
emissions from a burn. 
• Improved efficiency of technologies and de-
vices for broadcast burning, charcoaling, and 
use of fuelwood for heating and cooking. These 
devices and technologies need to be practical 
and affordable to indigenous populations. 
• Appropriate tree species for agroforestry by 
sites and regions, and the effects of these trees 
on soils and cropping systems. 
• Potential sinks for greenhouse gases in agri-
cultural systems of the tropics and the interac-
tions between sources and sinks. Long-term 
studies are needed to quantify the effects of 
different agricultural management systems on 
these sinks and especially on soil properties. 
4.3.4.4 Greenhouse Gas Emissions from 
Temperate/Boreal Agriculture 
Sources 
A n assortment of agricultural activities contribute 
to emissions of nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, and 
methane in temperate and boreal regions. 
Nitrous oxide emissions are estimated at 10-100 kg 
N/ha/yr globally. These emissions probably result 
from the significant amounts of nitrogen (of the 
order of 15-20 percent) that are lost from annual 
agricultural budgets and cannot be accounted for. 
In addition, agriculturally derived nitrogen con-
verts to nitrous oxide off-site in water and eroded 
soil, and is carried in some cases by the movement 
of fertilizer and inorganic particles from newly con-
verted lands. A significant factor in nitrous oxide 
emissions is the application of excess fertilizer when 
it cannot be fully utilized by growing plants, usually 
due to attempts to minimize uncertainty about crop 
yields. Nitrogen formulation, placement, and depth 
are important factors that influence the rate of ni-
trous oxide emissions, and their effects vary with 
fertilizer type, soil chemistry, and physical soil con-
ditions. In addition, nitrous oxide emissions could 
potentially increase in far northern soils near the 
permafrost belt that now have low levels of deni-
trification if temperature and moisture regimes shift 
northward, and if cultivation increases. 
Carbon dioxide fluxes are well-known processes, 
and the soil carbon relationships with crops and 
permanent vegetation have been modeled fairly 
well. No-till practice should show a marginal in-
crease in soil carbon, though there is great uncer-
114 
I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
tainty in the soil-carbon relationships involved in 
tillage practices and residue management. In tem-
perate and boreal agricultural systems, soil carbon 
can usually be increased or decreased by about 20 
percent from the existing continuous arable state 
when large amounts of organic matter are not 
added; thus these agricultural soils are not a signifi-
cant carbon sink. Furthermore, cutbacks in nitro-
gen inputs from any source may reduce biomass 
accumulation and annual carbon sequestration. Use 
of crop rotation with organic matter amendments 
can increase or maintain soil equilibrium levels of 
organic carbon. However, in temperate and boreal 
agricultural systems the effect is very small relative 
to that which takes place in the conversion to grass-
land or forest ecosystems. A n estimated 25 percent 
of the global soil carbon is contained in boreal forest 
soils, and significant amounts of this carbon will be 
lost if the lands overlying these soils are converted 
to agricultural use. In addition, drainage of peat 
bogs and boreal muskegs would release more ni-
trous oxides and carbon dioxide as water tables 
drop, while maintaining high water tables in these 
systems would release more methane. 
The total energy demand of intensive systems 
contributes 3 percent of total anthropogenic carbon 
dioxide emissions. While significant changes in the 
energy demands of current agricultural systems are 
not expected, some marginal contributions to 
greenhouse gas stabilization may be realized with 
shifts from conventional tillage to conservation, and 
partial replacement of chemical fertilizer and pesti-
cides with leguminous crops and biological control 
systems. 
Methane fluxes in boreal and temperate systems 
do not appear to contribute significantly to current 
emissions, although these processes are not well 
known. Uncertainty exists as to whether agri-
cultural soils serve as a sink for methane. 
Measures and Policy Options 
Agricultural policy formulation should include lim-
itation and mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. 
Two options are currently available for reducing 
emissions of nitrous oxide. 
• Improved biological-utilization efficiency in 
fertilizer use. Farmers may be advised about 
concepts of nutrient balance with clear defini-
tions about marginal and acceptable losses of 
nutrients, integrated with tillage and applica-
tion requirements. 
• Market and regulatory strategies. Allowable 
limits may be established for nitrous oxides and 
nitrate inputs and losses based on best available 
information, with the possible utilization of the 
concept of exchangeable loss units. Nutrient-
sensitive areas may be designated such as the 
Chesapeake Bay area of the United States, 
where special sets of balance mechanisms must 
be developed. Also, the concept of stocking 
rates (in terms of intensity or capacity of the 
soils resource) may be utilized within intensive 
agricultural zones, using the capability-rating 
systems of worldwide soil surveys. 
Research is needed on: 
• Measurements of nitrogen and nitrous oxide 
emissions to determine: contributions of ni-
trates in ground water; the contribution of dif-
ferent legumes, the nitrification and denitri-
fication processes, and the vadose zone; the 
contribution of arable lands to oxide produc-
tion in surface waters and sediments; sources 
such as chemical nitrogen sources, livestock-
manure sources, losses from storage, losses 
from sewage sludge, and losses in animal diges-
tion; and the contribution from different re-
gions of the world. 
• Relationship of carbon-nitrogen ratios to gas 
emissions and factors affecting nitrous oxide-
nitrogen ratios during denitrification. 
• Mechanisms for reducing gas emissions while 
maintaining production levels, including opti-
mal 
chemiforms of nitrogen to meet site-
specific characteristics. 
• The role of soil as a sink for nitrous oxides. 
• Measurement technologies, 
including scale-
dependent micrometeorological methods that 
are terrain transportable with fast-response sen-
sors, landscape- and regional-scale extrapola-
tion methods, improved nitrate nitrogen tests, 
and development of integrated data systems to 
integrate laboratory, field regional, and global 
scales. 
The effectiveness 
of 
agricultural-management 
practice will have to be assessed in terms of emis-
sions reductions, costs, and other benefits. In addi-

tion, 
policy 
research is needed to

EMISSIONS 
Organic matter in waste and wastewater is con-
verted into methane by different types of methane 
bacteria under anaerobic conditions. Anaerobic 
conditions exist in most landfill sites and in most 
lagoons used for treating organic loaded wastewa-
ter. To estimate global methane production from 
landfill sites, the following assumptions have been 
used: Specific waste generation in developed coun-
tries is approximately 1 kg per capita per day, and in 
developing countries it is approximately 0.5 kg per 
capita and day. Methane generation in developed 
countries is estimated to be 86 kg methane per met-
ric tonne of waste, and in developing countries 21.5 
kg per tonne of waste. Disposal of domestic and 
commercial waste on landfill sites takes place 
mainly in urban centers. In rural areas, particularly 
in developing countries, waste disposal does not 
take place on large centralized landfills with anaer-
obic conditions. In order to estimate future emis-
sions, U N statistics were used for urban popula-
tions. It is also assumed that for the period up to 
2030, no changes take place in waste composition, 
generation per person and waste treatment. Figure 
4.9 shows the estimated increase of methane emis-
sions between the years 1985 and 2030. 
Wastewater treatment plants in developed coun-
tries are not considered major sources of meth-
ane emissions because aerobic sewage treatment 
prevails and sludge digesters are equipped with gas-
utilization facilities. In most developing countries, 
where land is comparatively cheap, domestic and 
industrial wastewater is normally 
treated in 
lagoons/oxidation ponds. As a general rule, the first 
ponds rely on anaerobic conditions, and up to 80 
percent of the organic load is digested by methane

A n inventory of methane emissions from waste-
water lagoons in the Kingdom of Thailand esti-
mated that 0.5 million tonnes of methane are 
emitted per year. Little data is available for other 
countries with comparable conditions. O n the basis 
of the Thai data, the global methane emissions from 
wastewater lagoons may be estimated to be roughly 
20-25 million tonnes per year. 
Total global methane emissions from waste dis-
posals and from wastewater lagoons are estimated 
to be 55-60 million tonnes per year. This is 15 
percent of the total methane emissions caused by 
human activities.

Landfill Sites 
• Collect and recycle waste paper separately in 
order to reduce organic matter in wastes. 
• Collect and compost vegetable wastes sep-
arately in order to reduce organic matter in 
wastes. 
• Utilize aerobic waste treatment (composting), 
especially in regions with a demand for soil 
conditioners. 
• Utilize landfill gas collection system. It is esti-
mated that 30-90 percent of landfill gas can be 
recovered by gas collection systems (built-in 
pipes and wells). The gas can either be burned 
in torches or be used as an energy source (heat-
ing, electricity production). Implementation of 
gas collection systems in landfill sites is recom-
mended in developed countries. In developing 
countries, gas-collection systems are reasonable 
only in cases where methane contents in landfill 
gas are high enough to justify the high costs of 
the system. 
• Replace landfills with solid waste incineration 
in developed countries. 
(Emissions—C0 2-
equivalent—from landfills without gas collec-
tion are estimated to be 3-5 times higher than 
from waste incineration). 
Wastewater Treatment 
Most factories in the agricultural sector have both 
extremely loaded sewage and high energy demand 
(steam, electricity). Pretreatment of the sewage in 
biogas plants could therefore be recommended to 
reduce methane emission. By replacing bunker oil 
with methane, a capital return may be reached in 
about five years. 
4.4.3 
COSTS 
The costs of landfill gas collection systems vary 
among countries and from site to site.

RECOMMENDATIONS 
• Landfill gas collection systems and flaring ap-
pear to be practical for many developed coun-
tries and should be considered a near-term 
option to reduce methane emissions. Addi-
tional demonstrations of alternative electrical 
generation systems could further reduce their 
costs. 
• Biogas systems for wastewater treatment repre-
sent an inexpensive source of energy. These 
systems also reduce water pollution and agri-
cultural waste disposal problems. It is recom-
mended as a short-term option to introduce 
these systems in developed countries. 
• Application of these systems in developing 
countries requires additional demonstration, 
training, and technology transfer and it would 
be a somewhat longer term policy option for 
these countries.

SECTORS 
• Emissions from these sectors are intimately re-
lated to the ability of countries to provide for 
national and global food security and raw mate-
Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Human Activities 
117 
rials for export. Policies for emission control 
therefore may affect the economic basis of some 
countries, especially developing countries. Ef-
forts to prevent deforestation and to promote 
afforestation will have multiple impacts that in 
many cases may enhance the abilities of indige-
nous agricultural communities to feed them-
selves and to earn a living from local surplus. 
Flexibility should be provided to governments 
to develop least-cost implementation strategies, 
and countries should pursue those options that 
increase productivity, make economic sense, 
and are beneficial for other reasons. 
Agriculture and forestry sources of greenhouse 
gas emissions consist of very large numbers of 
small sources, and/or of diffuse sources from 
large land areas, and as such represent a major 
challenge. 
To meet this challenge it is desirable to consider 
a range of measures in the context of a compre-
hensive response strategy. Currently available 
options in the sectors are likely to be only par-
tially effective unless coupled with action to 
reduce emissions from the energy and industry 
sector. 
Controls on existing sources of pollution which 
may affect agricultural and forestry lands are an 
important component in reducing emissions 
and protecting sinks. Measures to prevent land 
degradation, hydrological problems and loss of 
biodiversity, and to improve productivity will 
generally complement efforts in this sector. 
Furthermore, analysis is needed about the costs 
and benefits of individual policy measures. 
There is an urgent need to improve all relevant 
data, especially on deforestation rates and on 
the socio-economic factors that lead to the use 
of deleterious practices in agriculture and for-
estry. In order to achieve the full potential of 
identified measures, research is needed into the 
routes by which new technologies can be intro-
duced while preserving and enhancing social 
and economic development. 
In the past, the agriculture and forestry sector 
has proved efficient at introducing new meth-
ods of production, not always with beneficial 
environmental consequences. The pace of tech-
nological development (even in the absence of 
global warming) is likely to remain high in this 
sector for the foreseeable future. This may af-
ford new opportunities for emission reduction, 
provided that efficient transfer of knowledge, 
advice, and technology occur. 
• A number of technical options have been iden-
tified that could reduce emissions from and en-
hance sinks in forestry and agriculture, as 
well as reduce emissions from waste and waste-
water treatment. In many cases, their applica-
tion will require further research and develop-
ment and large scale education and technology 
transfer programmes. In this regard, the papers 
produced by Working Group III on Legal and 
Institutional Measures, Public Information and 
Education, 
Technology Development and 
Transfer, Financial Measures and Economic 
Measures are particularly pertinent to develop-
ing recommendations for the implementation 
measures to meet these objectives.

INFORMATION O N EMISSION 
SOURCES 
• Emissions of greenhouse gases, based on the 
best available estimates, are presented in Table 
4.1. 
Large margins of uncertainty remain in 
these figures. Many are scaled up from regional 
estimates which may be unrepresentative at a 
global level. 
• The figures indicate that agriculture and for-
estry contribute significant amounts of green-
house gases. Where carbon dioxide is con-
cerned, deforestation, especially in the tropics, 
is the major concern at present. Agriculture 
contributes significantly to global methane. 
Furthermore, the degradation of soil organic 
matter may release C 0 2 . 
• These emissions are likely to increase over the 
next few decades, due to population and eco-
nomic growth, the associated expansion and 
intensification of agriculture, increased de-
mands on wood, especially for fuel, and pres-
sure to use forestry land for agriculture.

RESEARCH 
Clearly, there is a need for research to improve 
emission estimates, and, particularly, to develop 
standardized methods for measuring emissions at 
118

field, regional and global scales. Developing re-
gional budgets that can be related to global scale 
events is a challenge. Research is also needed into 
biological processes contributing to emissions and 
sinks. Development of additional methods for sus-
tainable agriculture and forestry is a priority. 
4.5.4 
POLICY OBJECTIVES 
Nonetheless, policies must be developed not only 
for the long term, but also to initiate immediate 
actions to prevent further deterioration. It is neces-
sary to be clear about the strategic objectives of such 
policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from 
forestry, agriculture, and wastes, and to maintain 
and provide sinks especially for C 0 2 : 
Forestry 
• To reduce the scale of destructive deforestation. 
• To promote reforestation and afforestation. 
• To promote sustainable forest management. 
• To promote more complete utilization of forest 
products, including recycling. 
Agriculture 
• To reduce methane emissions from ruminants 
and rice cultivation. 
• To reduce nitrogen loss from cultivation, espe-
cially in the form of nitrous oxide. 
Wastes and Wastewaters 
• To promote efficient waste treatment and col-
lection and utilization of gaseous emissions. 
4.5.5 
CRITERIA FOR T H E SELECTION OF 
POLICY OPTIONS 
It is important that these objectives be met without 
major economic and social disruption, especially to 
developing countries. Policies must therefore: 
• be of widespread applicability; 
• be economic—that is, be compatible with the 
social and economic life of the communities 
dependent on agriculture and forestry; 
• be equitable in the distribution of the burdens 
of action between developed and developing 
countries taking into account the special situa-
tion of the latter; 
• result in the spread of knowledge, management 
skills, and technologies; 
• result in net environmental gain; and 
• take account of the fact that emissions in this 
sector largely comprise many small sources or 
diffuse sources from large areas.

Policy Option Cases (Grainger, 1989a): Decreased forestation and emissions are expected to result from increases in agricultural productivity that 
relieve pressure to clear new land. Increases in productivity are adjusted for changes in per capita consumption for a net gain. In the high case, net 
agricultural productivity per ha rises by 0.5%, 0.0% and 0.5% per year for Africa, Asia-Pacific and Latin America respectively; and by 1.0%, 0.0% 
and 1.0% per year respectively, in low case scenario. Biomass estimates are the same in both cases, based on "volume over bark" estimates FAO 
(1981) and procedures of Brown and Lugo (1984). 
Base Cases (Houghton, 1990b): Increased deforestation is forecast. The low base case assumes low forest biomass estimates (roughly) comparable to 
Grainger's biomass assumptions) and linear increases in the rate of deforestation. The high base case assumes high forest biomass and population 
based deforestation rates. The biomass estimates are outlined in Houghton et al., 1985.

These low and high base case projections repre-
sent the upper and lower bounds for the range in 
emissions possible in models of linear, exponential, 
and population based deforestation rates, run with 
both high and low forest biomass estimates. The 
low base case uses linear deforestation rates re-
ported by F A O / U N E P (1981) for the years 1975-
85, coupled with low forest biomass estimates. The 
high base case uses rates of deforestation that are a 
function of rates of population growth, coupled 
with high forest biomass estimates. 
Estimates of flux are given for 1980, 2000, 2025, 
and 2050. After 2050, country-by-country esti-
mates are especially dangerous for the reasons given 
below. Estimates for the year 2025 in this Appendix 
(instead of 2020) were selected so they would be 
directly comparable with the EIS data. They are, 
however, basically interchangeable with the esti-
mates for 2020 in Appendix 4.1 and Figure 4.2 of 
this report given the error factor involved in making 
such projections. The low base case emissions esti-
mates are slightly lower in this Appendix than in 
Appendix 4.1 and Figure 4.2 due to subsequent 
refinements in the accuracy of the model. 
Two important qualifications should be recog-
nized for these projections: 
1) The projections were based on rates of de-
forestation for entire regions, not countries. 
Thus, projected fluxes drop to zero only when 
the forests of an entire region are gone. In fact, 
some countries will eliminate their forests be-
fore others, and fluxes there will drop to zero 
before all forests in the region are gone. If the 
projections were carried out country-by-
country, the estimates of flux, for countries as 
well as regions, would probably be lower. 
2) A l l estimates of flux are based on extrapola-
tions or functions of F A O / U N E P data that 
are now more than ten years old. It is, there-
fore, interesting to compare these projections 
with estimates of flux from Myers' new rates 
of deforestation. Such a comparison can be 
done for closed forests only, but if Myers' 
recent estimates are correct, all the projections 
are low.

A C K N O W L E D G M E N T S 
The focus of the Coastal Zone Management Sub-
group (CZMS) is on options for adapting to sea 
level rise and other impacts of global change on 
coastal areas. The C Z M S held workshops in Miami, 
Florida, and in Perth, Western Australia, to gener-
ate information on available adaptive response op-
tions and their environmental, economic, social, 
cultural, legal, institutional, and financial implica-
tions. The countries that contributed to the work of 
the CZMS by sending experts to these workshops 
are listed below. Special acknowledgments are ad-
dressed to the United States and Australia for host-
ing these workshops. 
The writing of this report was entrusted to

We wish to recognize and thank all of the partici-
pants and reviewers who contributed their time, 
energy, and knowledge to the preparation of this 
report. We hope that the report will help nations in 
beginning to prepare for the potential impacts of 
global climate change on their coastal areas.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
R E A S O N S 
F O R 
C O N C E R N 
Global climate change may raise sea level as much as 
one meter over the next century and, in some areas, 
increase the frequency and severity of storms. Hun-
dreds of thousands of square kilometers of coastal 
wetlands and other lowlands could be inundated. 
Beaches could retreat as much as a few hundred 
meters and protective structures may be breached. 
Flooding would threaten lives, agriculture, live-
stock, buildings, and infrastructures. 
Saltwater 
would advance landward into aquifers and up estu-
aries, threatening water supplies, ecosystems, and 
agriculture in some areas. 
Some nations are particularly vulnerable. Eight to 
ten million people live within one meter of high tide 
in each of the unprotected river deltas of Ban-
gladesh, Egypt, and Vietnam. Half a million people 
live in archipelagoes and coral atoll nations that lie 
almost entirely within three meters of sea level, such 
as the Maldives, the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu, 
Kiribati, and Tokelau. Other archipelagoes and is-
land nations in the Pacific, Indian Ocean, and Ca-
ribbean could lose much of their beaches and arable 
lands, which would cause severe economic and so-
cial disruption. 
Even in nations that are not, on the whole, partic-
ularly vulnerable to sea level rise, some areas could 
be seriously threatened. Examples include Sydney, 
Shanghai, coastal Louisiana, and other areas eco-
nomically dependent on fisheries or sensitive to 
changes in estuarine habitats. 
As a result of present population growth and 
development, coastal areas worldwide are under in-
creasing stress. In addition, increased exploitation 
of non-renewable resources is degrading the func-
tions and values of coastal zones in many parts of 
the world. Consequently, populated coastal areas 
are becoming more and more vulnerable to sea level 
rise and other impacts of climate change. Even a 
small rise in sea level could have serious adverse 
effects. 
The Coastal Zone Management Subgroup has ex-
amined the physical and institutional strategies for 
adapting to the potential consequences of global 
climate change. Particular attention was focused on 
sea level rise, where most research on impacts has 
been conducted. The Subgroup also has reviewed 
the various responses and has recommended actions 
to reduce vulnerability to sea level rise and other 
impacts of climate change.

The responses required to protect human life and 
property fall broadly into three categories: retreat, 
accommodation, and protection. Retreat involves 
no effort to protect the land from the sea. The 
coastal zone is abandoned and ecosystems shift 
landward. This choice can be motivated by exces-
sive economic or environmental impacts of protec-
tion. In the extreme case, an entire area may be 
abandoned. Accommodation 
implies that people 
continue to use the land at risk but do not attempt to 
prevent the land from being flooded. This option 
includes erecting emergency flood shelters, elevat-
ing buildings on piles, converting agriculture to fish 
farming, or growing flood- or salt-tolerant crops.

I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
Protection involves hard structures such as seawalls 
and dikes, as well as soft solutions such as dunes and 
vegetation, to protect the land from the sea so that 
existing land uses can continue. 
The appropriate mechanism for implementation 
depends on the particular response. Assuming that 
land for settlement is available, retreat can be imple-
mented through anticipatory land-use regulations, 
building codes, or economic incentives. Accom-
modation may evolve without governmental action, 
but could be assisted by strengthening flood prepa-
ration and flood insurance programmes. Protection 
can be implemented by the authorities currently 
responsible for water resources and coastal protec-
tion. 
Improving scientific and public understanding of 
the problem is also a critical component of any 
response strategy. The highest priorities for basic 
research are better projections of changes in the rate 
of sea level rise, precipitation, and the frequency 
and intensity of storms. Equally important, but 
more often overlooked, is the need for applied re-
search to determine which options are warranted, 
given current information. Finally, the available in-
formation on coastal land elevation is poor. Maps 
for most nations only show contours of five meters 
or greater, making it difficult to determine the areas 
and resources vulnerable to impacts of a one-meter 
rise in sea level. Except for a few countries, there are 
no reliable data from which to determine how many 
people and how much development are at risk. 
There are many uncertainties, and they increase as 
we look further into the future. 
E N V I R O N M E N T A L 
I M P L I C A T I O N S 
Two-thirds of the world's fish catch, and many 
marine species, depend on coastal wetlands for their 
survival. Without human interference, (the retreat 
option), ecosystems could migrate landward as 
sea level rises, and thus could remain largely in-
tact, although the total area of wetlands would de-
cline. Under the protection option, a much larger 
proportion of these ecosystems would be lost, 
especially if hard structures block their landward 
migration. 
Along marine coasts hard structures can have a 
greater impact than soft solutions. Hard structures 
influence banks, channels, beach profiles, sediment 
deposits and morphology of the coastal zone. 
Protective structures should be designed—as 
much as possible—to avoid adverse environmental 
impacts. Artificial reefs can create new habitats for 
marine species, and dams can mitigate saltwater in-
trusion, though sometimes at the cost of adverse 
environmental impacts elsewhere. Soft solutions 
such as beach nourishment retain natural shore-
lines; but the necessary sand mining can disrupt 
habitats. 
E C O N O M I C 
I M P L I C A T I O N S 
N o response strategy can completely eliminate the 
economic impacts of climate change. In the retreat 
option, coastal landowners and communities would 
suffer from loss of property, resettlement costs, and 
the costs for rebuilding infrastructure. Under ac-
commodation, there would be changing property 
values, increasing damage from storms, and costs 
for modifying infrastructure. Under the protection 
option, nations and communities would face the 
costs of the necessary structures. The structures 
would protect economic development, but could 
adversely affect economic interests that depend on 
recreation and fisheries. 
A n annex of the Coastal Zone Management Sub-
group Report shows that if sea level rises by one 
meter, about 360,000 kilometers of coastal defenses 
would be required at a total cost of U.S.$500 billion 
by the year 2100. (This sum only reflects the mar-
ginal or added costs and is not discounted.) This 
value does not include costs necessary to meet pres-
ent coastal defense needs. The estimate does not 
include the value of the unprotected dry land or 
ecosystems that would be lost, nor does it consider 
the costs of responding to saltwater intrusion or the 
impacts of increased storm frequency. 
Therefore 
the overall cost will he considerably 
higher. A l -
though some nations could bear all or part of these 
costs, other nations—including many small island 
states—could not. 
To ensure that coastal development is sustain-
able, decisions on response strategies should be

based on long-term as well as short-term costs and 
benefits.

Under the retreat option, resettlement could create 
major problems. Resettled people are not always 
well received; they often face language problems, 
racial and religious discrimination, and difficulties 
in obtaining employment. Even when they feel wel-
come, the disruption of families, friendships, and 
traditions can be stressful. 
Although the impacts of accommodation and 
protection would be less, they may still be impor-
tant. The loss of traditional environments—which 
normally sustain economies 
and cultures and 
provide for recreational needs—could 
disrupt 
family life and create social instability. Regardless 
of the response eventually chosen, community par-
ticipation in the decision making process is the best 
way to ensure that these implications are recog-
nized.

Existing institutions and legal frameworks may be 
inadequate to implement a response. Issues such as 
compensation for use of private property and lia-
bility for failure of coastal protection structures re-
quire national adjudication. For some options, such 
as resettlement (retreat option) and structures that 
block sediments (protection option), there are 
transboundary implications that must be addressed 
on a regional basis. International action may be 
required through existing conventions if inundation 
of land results in disputes over national borders and 
maritime boundaries, such as exclusive economic 
zones or archipelagic waters. New authorities may 
be required, both to implement options and to man-
age them over long periods of time in the face of 
pressures for development. National coastal man-
agement plans and other new laws and institutions 
are needed to plan, implement, and maintain the 
necessary adaptive options. 
C O N C L U S I O N S 
Scientists and officials from some 70 nations have 
expressed their views on the implications of sea level 
rise and other coastal impacts of global climate 
change at Coastal Zone Management Subgroup 
workshops in Miami and Perth. They indicated 
that, in several noteworthy cases, the impacts could 
be disastrous; that in a few cases impacts would be 
trivial; but that for most coastal nations, at least for 
the foreseeable future, the impacts of sea level rise 
would be serious but manageable if appropriate ac-
tions are taken. 
It is urgent for coastal nations to begin the pro-
cess of adapting to sea level rise not because there is 
an impending catastrophe, but because there are 
opportunities 
to avoid adverse impacts by acting 
now—opportunities 
that may be lost if the process 
is delayed. This is also consistent with good coastal 
zone management practice irrespective of whether 
climate change occurs or not. Accordingly, the fol-
lowing actions are appropriate: 
N A T I O N A L COASTAL PLANNING 
1) By the year 2000, coastal nations should imple-
ment comprehensive coastal zone management 
plans. These plans should deal with both sea 
level rise and other impacts of global climate 
change. They should ensure that risks to pop-
ulations are minimized, while recognizing the 
need to protect and maintain important 
coastal ecosystems. 
2) Coastal areas at risk should be 
identified. 
National efforts should be undertaken to (a) 
identify functions and resources at risk from a 
one-meter rise in sea level and (b) assess the 
implications of adaptive response measures on 
them. Improved mapping will be vital for 
completing this task. 
3) Nations 
should ensure that coastal develop-
ment does not increase vulnerability 
to sea 
level rise. Structural measures to prepare for 
sea level rise may not yet be warranted. Nev-
ertheless, the design and location of coastal 
138 
I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
infrastructure and coastal defenses should in-
clude consideration of sea level rise and other 
impacts of climate change. It is sometimes less 
expensive to incorporate these factors into the 
initial design of a structure than to rebuild it 
later. Actions in particular need of review in-
clude river levees and dams, conversions of 
mangroves and other wetlands for agriculture 
and human habitation, harvesting of coral and 
increased settlement in low-lying areas. 
4) Emergency preparedness and coastal zone re-
sponse mechanisms need to he reviewed 
and 
strengthened. Efforts should be undertaken to 
develop emergency preparedness plans for re-
ducing 
vulnerability to 
coastal 
storms, 
through better evacuation planning and the 
development of coastal defense mechanisms 
that recognize the impact of sea level rise. 
INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION 
5) A continuing 
international 
focus on the 
im-
pacts of sea level rise needs to be 
maintained. 
Existing international organizations should be 
augmented with new mechanisms to focus 
awareness and attention on sea level change 
and to encourage nations of the world to de-
velop appropriate responses. 
6) Technical 
assistance for 
developing 
nations 
should be provided 
and cooperation 
stimu-
lated. Institutions offering financial support 
should recognize the need for technical assis-
tance in developing coastal management plans, 
assessing coastal resources at risk, and increas-
ing a nation's ability—through education, 
training, and technology transfer—to address 
sea level rise. 
7) International 
organizations 
should 
support 
national efforts to limit population growth in 
coastal areas. In the final analysis, rapid pop-
ulation growth is the underlying problem 
with the greatest impact on both the efficacy 
of coastal zone management and the success 
of adaptive response options. 
RESEARCH, D A T A , A N D INFORMATION 
8) Research 
on the impacts of global 
climate 
change on sea level rise should be 
strength-
ened. International and national climate re-
search programmes need to be directed at 
understanding and predicting changes in sea 
level, extreme events, precipitation, and 
other impacts of global climate change on 
coastal areas. 
9) A global ocean-observing 
network should be 
developed 
and 
implemented. 
Member na-
tions are strongly encouraged to support the 
efforts of the I O C , W M O , and U N E P to 
establish a coordinated international ocean-
observing network that will allow for accu-
rate assessments and continuous monitoring 
of changes in the world's oceans and coastal 
areas, particularly sea level change. 
10) Data and information 
on sea level change 
and adaptive options should be made widely 
available. 
A n 
international 
mechanism 
should be identified with the participation of 
the parties concerned for collecting and ex-
changing data and information on climate 
change and its impact on sea level and the 
coastal zone, and on various adaptive op-
tions. Sharing this information with develop-
ing countries is critically important for 
preparation of coastal management plans. 
P R O P O S A L O F T H E C Z M C H A I R M E N 
F O R F U T U R E 
A C T I V I T I E S 
Based on the views of the delegates and the recom-
mendations of the Miami and Perth I P C C - C Z M S 
workshops, the chairmen of the C Z M Subgroup 
and their advisers have undertaken the task to facili-
tate the implementation of the C Z M actions. They 
suggest that three parallel efforts be undertaken: 
1) Data 
Collection. 
Efforts to build a current 
global data base on coastal resources at risk 
due to sea level rise need to be vigorously 
pursued. The I P C C - C Z M Subgroup has de-
veloped a questionnaire that can serve as a first 
step in the collection of this information and in 
identifying the countries where additional 
work needs to be done. It is also suggested 
that a data base or monitoring system be set up 
which would provide access to and informa-
tion on adaption techniques, and which could 
be maintained in an international or regional 
"clearing house." 
2) International 
Protocol. Efforts should com-
mence immediately on the development of an 
international protocol to provide a framework 
for international and multinational coopera-
tion in dealing with the full range of concerns 
related to impacts of sea level rise and climate 
change impacts on the coastal zone. A proto-
col is needed to both establish the interna-
tional frames of reference as well as to 
establish a clear set of goals and objectives. 
Possible elements contained in such a protocol 
are outlined in Table 5.1. 
3) Organizational 
Requirements. 
A 
process 
should be set in motion to guide and assist 
countries, particularly developing countries 
in carrying out the I P C C - C Z M actions. For 
this purpose IPCC could consider the forma-
tion of a small advisory group to assist in the 
development of more specific guidelines. Such 
an advisory group could be formalized at a 
later stage to support the secretariat for the 
parties to a future protocol on C Z M and sea 
level rise. 
The goals and actions presented in this report are 
based on problems common to all coastal nations; 
their achievement can benefit significantly from co-
ordination at the international level. 
The three activities described above are consid-
ered crucial steps in realizing the full potential of the 
I P C C process. The Miami and Perth workshops 
demonstrated very clearly that many developing na-
tions will not be able to respond effectively to the 
needs that have been identified without some form 
of assistance. 
Additionally, and in accordance with the primary 
action for the development of comprehensive 
coastal zone management plans, a timeline (Table 
5.2) of essential actions for the formulation of such 
plans is suggested. Countries that do not currently 
have coastal management plans could use this 
timeline as a basis for their own planning process 
over the next decade.

• avoid taking measures that are detrimental to the 
coastal zones of adjoining states; 
• provide emergency relief to coastal nations struck by

• establish a secretariat supported by a small advisory 
group to facilitate the implementation of the proto-

ADVISORY G R O U P : COMPOSITION 
A N D FUNCTIONS 
In order to facilitate the development of responses 
to the threat of sea level rise and other impacts of 
climate change on the world's coastal zones, a func-
tional nucleus of experts is required. Its task should 
be limited to requests by coastal states for assistance 
in achieving the goal of having a comprehensive 
coastal zone management programme in place by 
the year 2000. 
Upon receipt of a request for assistance, the 
I P C C may send an investigative mission to the re-
questing country or encourage multilateral or bilat-
eral aid organizations to do so. The mission should 
assess the country's institutional, technical, and fi-
nancial needs and means, i.e., its requirements in 
these three areas. The advisory group could prepare 
guidelines for such missions or provide other sup-
port if asked for. 
Countries should have the institutional capability 
to develop their own coastal management pro-
grammes and to establish a regulatory framework 
and the means for enforcement. The required tech-
nical capability should be brought to an adequate 
level by training programmes, expert advice, and 
appropriate equipment. A n estimate of the costs 
involved (excluding equipment) is presented in Ta-
ble 5.3. 
It should further be determined to what extent 
the necessary funding can be generated within the 
country itself and what part could be requested 
from outside financing institutions. 
The mission report referred to above should then 
be considered against and in the light of worldwide 
data, synthesized from information supplied by 
countries with a marine coast. These data should 
initially be compiled on the basis of the responses to 
a comprehensive questionnaire sent to all coastal 
countries, and augmented as required. 
Finally, the group of advisers would report to 
the IPCC panel on country assessments and priori-
ties in terms of vulnerability to the coastal impacts 
of climate change and on related institutional 
needs.

EXISTING PROBLEMS 
Throughout the world, nations are facing a growing 
number of coastal problems as a result of develop-
ment and increased population pressures. In many 
areas the functions and values normally associated 
with coastal areas are being degraded.1 Flooding, 
erosion, habitat loss and modification, structural 
damage, silting and shoaling, pollution, and over-
exploitation of living resources, all have major pub-
lic safety and economic consequences. Yet while 
these risks are substantial and commonly recog-
nized, the local benefits of using coastal resources 
outweigh the risks—sometimes significantly—and 
they continue to attract human activity and devel-
opment to the coastal zone. 
Shoreline alterations, mangrove and coral har-
vesting, dredge and fill activities, sand and gravel 
extraction, and disposal of wastes in the marine 
environment all result in changes to the natural 
character of the coast. Inland activities—particu-
larly upstream of river deltas—can also have a sig-
nificant impact on the coast. Construction of dams, 
diversion of river flows, and removal of ground 
water or hydrocarbons can result in coastal erosion, 
subsidence, and shifts in the fresh and salt water 
interface2—so critical to the maintenance of coastal 
habitats and fisheries. 
Obvious examples of the consequences of human 
activities include (1) the accelerated retreat of two 
Nile subdeltas following construction of the Aswan 
High Dam and loss of the sardine fishery;3 (2) the 
rapid loss of land in the Mississippi River delta due 
to subsidence, river levees, canals, and navigation 
channels;4 and (3) the exposure of valuable agri-
cultural land in Malaysia to ocean waves as a result 
of uncontrolled mangrove harvesting. 
If populations in coastal areas continue to grow, 
balancing environmental and development concerns 
will be increasingly difficult. Changes in climate 
and sea level will exacerbate many of these prob-
lems, particularly for small islands, deltas, and low 
coastal plains. High population density is therefore 
the most fundamental problem faced by coastal 
areas (Figure 5.1). 
5.1.3 
G L O B A L CLIMATE C H A N G E 
A n accelerated rise in global sea level is generally 
considered to be the most important impact of 
global climate change on coastal areas. The IPCC-
Working Group I projects a rise in global sea level 
of 30 to 110 cm by the year 2100 (Figure 5.2), due 
principally to thermal expansion of the ocean and 
melting of small mountain glaciers. Such a rate of 
rise would be 3 to 10 times faster than the current 
rate. Even with actions to limit emissions, the 
IPCC-Working Group I concludes that there ap-
pears to be enough momentum in the global climate 
system for a rate of accelerated rise in sea level to be 
inevitable.5 
Sea level rise could increase flood-related deaths, 
damage to property and the environment, and cause 
some nations to lose territorial seas, and hence 
change the relative values of the coastal zone to 
society. This will inevitably lead to decisions re-
garding response options, for example, to retreat, 
accommodate or protect.6 A number of researchers

I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
have further suggested that extreme events may be-
come more frequent as a result of climate change.7 
For example, increased ocean temperatures may re-
sult in changes in the frequency, duration and inten-
sity of tropical storms. Moreover, the effect of 
storm surges could be intensified by higher sea 
levels. Inundation of coastal areas is already com-
mon during tropical storms and any increases in the 
extent or frequency of inundation may render nu-
merous heavily populated areas marginal or unin-
habitable. 
Because the global climate system is complex, our 
understanding of it may progress slowly. The exist-
ing system for monitoring global sea level cannot 
yet detect significant changes. Considerable uncer-
tainties remain about the nature, timing, and magni-
tude of future sea level rise, and the local, national, 
and regional impacts of human-induced global cli-
mate changes. 
5.1.4 
ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS OF 
SEA L E V E L RISE 
Working Group II 8 suggests that a rise in sea level 
could: (1) increase shoreline erosion; (2) exacerbate 
coastal flooding; (3) inundate coastal wetlands and 
other lowlands; (4) increase the salinity of estuaries 
and aquifers; (5) alter tidal ranges in rivers and bays; 
(6) change the locations where rivers deposit sedi-
ment; and (7) drown coral reefs. 
Estuaries, lagoons, deltas, marshes, mangroves, 
coral reefs, and seagrass beds are characterized by 
tidal influence, high turbidity (except coral reefs) 
and productivity, and a high degree of human activ-
ity. Their economic significance includes their im-
portance 
for fisheries, 
agriculture, 
shipping, 
recreation, waste disposal, coastal protection, bio-
logical productivity, and diversity. 
The direct effect of sea level rise in shallow coastal 
waters is an increase in water depth. Intertidal zones 
may be modified; mangroves and other coastal veg-
etation could be inundated and coral reefs could be 
drowned. In turn, this may cause changes in bird 
life, fish spawning and nursery grounds, and fish 
and shellfish production. For example, coastal wet-
lands provide an important contribution to com-
mercial and recreational fisheries, with an annual 
economic value of over $10 billion in the United 
States alone.9 Equally important is the contribution 
of wetlands to commercial and subsistence fisheries 
in many coastal and island states. Table 5.4 lists the 
areas of coastal wetlands of "international impor-
tance" for major regions of the world. 
In general, the effects on shallow coastal ecosys-
tems are strongly determined by local conditions. A 
good understanding of the physical and biological 
processes and topography is required to forecast 
local impacts. But if the accumulation of sediments 
cannot keep pace with rising waters, or if inland 
expansion of wetlands and intertidal areas is not 
possible 1 0 (because of infrastructure or a steeply 
rising coast), major impacts could occur. 
The estuarine response to rising sea level is likely 
to be characterized by a slow but continually adjust-
ing environment. With a change in estuarine vegeta-
tion there could be an adjustment in the animal 
species living in and around the wetlands. Climate 
change may also provoke shifts in the hydrological 
regimes of coastal rivers and lead to increased dis-
charge and sediment yields and, consequently, to 
increased turbidity. These changes, together with a 
rise in sea level, could modify the shape and location 
of banks and channels. If no protective structures 
are built, wetlands can migrate inland; however, a 
net loss of wetlands would still result. 
5.1.5 
SOCIAL A N D E C O N O M I C IMPACTS OF 
SEA L E V E L RISE 
Many developing countries have rapid rates of pop-
ulation growth, with large proportions of their pop-
ulations inhabiting low-lying coastal areas. A one-
meter rise in sea level could inundate 15 percent of 
Bangladesh,11 destroy rice fields and mariculture of 
the Mekong delta, and flood many populated atolls, 
including the Republic of Maldives, Cocos Island, 
Tokelau, Tuvalu, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, 
and Torres Strait Islands.12 Shanghai and Lagos, the 
largest cities of China and Nigeria, lie less than two 
meters above sea level, as does 20 percent of the 
population and farmland of Egypt. 1 3 
Four highly populated developing countries, In-
dia, Bangladesh, Vietnam, and Egypt, are especially 
vulnerable to sea level rise because their low-lying 
coastal plains are already suffering the effects of 
flooding and coastal storms. Since 1960, India and 
Bangladesh have been struck by at least eight tropi-
cal cyclones, each of which killed more than 10,000

people. In late 1970, storm surges killed approx-
imately 300,000 people in Bangladesh and reached 
over 150 kilometers inland. Eight to ten million 
people live within one meter of high tide in each of 
the unprotected river deltas of Bangladesh, Egypt, 
and Vietnam. 1 4 Even more people in these countries 
would be threatened by increased intensity and fre-
quency of storms. 
Sea level rise could increase the severity of storm 
related flooding. The higher base for storm surges 
would be an important additional threat in areas 
where hurricanes, tropical cyclones and typhoons 
are frequent, particularly for islands in the Carib-
bean Sea, the southeastern United States, the tropi-
cal Pacific, and the Indian subcontinent. Had flood 
defenses not already been constructed, London, 
Hamburg, and much of the Netherlands would al-
ready be threatened by winter storms. 
Many small island states are also particularly vul-
nerable.15 This is reflected in their very high ratios 
of coastline length to land area. The most seriously 
threatened island states would be those consisting 
solely, or mostly, of atolls with little or no land 
more than a few meters above sea level. Tropical 
storms further increase their vulnerability and, 
while less in magnitude than those experienced by 
some of the world's densely populated deltas, on a 
proportional basis such storms can have a much 
more devastating impact on island nations. 
Disruption could also be severe in industrialized 
countries as a result of the high value of buildings 
and infrastructure. River water levels could rise and 
affect related infrastructure, bridges, port struc-
tures, quays, and embankments. Higher water 
levels in the lower reaches of rivers and adjacent 
coastal waters may reduce natural drainage of adja-
cent land areas, which would damage roads, build-
ings, and agricultural land. 
The potential impacts of sea level rise and climate 
change are varied and uncertain. Nevertheless, 
there is little doubt that adaptive responses will be 
necessary. 
5.2 
A D A P T I V E R E S P O N S E S 
The selection and timing of adaptive measures in 
response to sea level rise would depend on the phys-
ical, social, economic, political, and environmental 
characteristics of the affected areas. Although such 
measures could be implemented on case by case 
bases, growing population pressures and conflicting 
demands in many of the world's coastal areas favor 
implementation of comprehensive and systematic 
coastal management programs. 
5.2.1 
COASTAL M A N A G E M E N T 
The three principal objectives of coastal manage-
ment are to: (1) Avoid development in areas that are 
vulnerable to inundation; (2) Ensure that critical 
natural systems continue to function; and (3) Pro-
tect human lives, essential properties, and economic 
activities against the ravages of the seas. Accord-
ingly, such programmes should give full considera-
tion to ecological, cultural, historic, and aesthetic 
values, and to the needs for human safety and eco-
nomic development.16 
Coastal management programmes usually in-
clude governmental controls and private-sector in-
centives. Vulnerable areas are managed to minimize 
loss of life and property through such means as 
setback lines, limits on population densities, mini-
mum building elevations, and coastal hazard insur-
ance requirements. Resilient natural protective 
features, such as beaches, sand dunes, mangroves, 
wetlands, and coral reefs, are conserved and en-
hanced, which also maintains biological diversity, 
aesthetic values, and recreation. 
Comprehensive plans for protecting existing eco-
nomic activities help to ensure that defense mea-
sures are consistent with other coastal management 
objectives. Policies that specify which activities and 
development are permitted in new areas promote 
efficient private land use with the least risk of expo-
sure to coastal hazards. 
Successful coastal management programmes re-
quire public education to gain broad-based support, 
and public participation to ensure equal representa-
tion of interests. 
Response strategies fall into three broad catego-
ries : 
• Retreat: Abandonment of land and structures 
in vulnerable areas, and resettlement of inhabi-
tants. 
Coastal Zone Management 
147 
• Accommodation: 
Continued occupancy and 
use of vulnerable areas. 
• Protection: 
Defense of vulnerable areas, espe-
cially population centers, economic activities, 
and natural resources. 
5.2.2 
RETREAT 
Options for retreat include: 
1) Preventing 
development 
in areas near the 
coast. 
2) Allowing 
development 
to take place on 
the 
condition that it will be abandoned if necessary 
(planned phase out). 
3) No direct government role other than through 
withdrawal of subsidies and provision of in-
formation about associated risks. 
Governmental efforts to limit development gen-
erally involve land acquisition, land-use restric-
tions, prohibited reconstruction of property dam-
aged by storms, and reductions of subsidies and 
incentives for development in vulnerable areas. 
Many nations have purchased large areas on the 
coast and designated them as nature reserves. Pre-
venting development can reduce future expendi-
tures for adaptation. 
India, Sri Lanka, Tonga, Fiji, Mauritius, Austra-
lia, and the United States already require new build-
ings be set back from the sea. These regulations 
could be modified to consider the future impacts 
from a rising sea level, but most nations would re-
quire compensation for coastal property owners. 1 7 
The second option gives the government a more 
limited role, in that it lays out the "rules of the 
game"—the eventual transgression of the sea.18 In-
vestors are accustomed to evaluating uncertainty 
and can determine whether development should 
proceed, given the constraint. This approach can be 
implemented through (a) regulations that prohibit 
private construction of protective structures, or (b) 
conversion of land ownership to long-term or con-
ditional leases that expire when the sea reaches a 
particular level or when the property owner dies. 
The third option would be to depend on the 
workings of the private market. Productive crop 
and timber lands may be left to slowly and progres-
sively deteriorate as a result of salt intrusion into the 
groundwater or by surface flooding. Wells and sur-
face water exposed to saltwater intrusion would 
gradually be abandoned. Natural resources, such as 
mangroves, marshes, and coral reefs, would be left 
to their natural processes as sea level rises. 
Under this option, governments could take the 
more limited role of ensuring that all participants in 
potentially vulnerable areas have full knowledge 
about the expected sea level rise and its associated 
uncertainties. Development would presumably not 
occur if developers, lenders, and insurers were not 
willing to accept the risks. However, if people con-
tinue to build in vulnerable areas, governments 
must be prepared to take the necessary actions to 
ensure public safety. 
For small island states, retreat does not offer a 
broadly applicable alternative. There would be little 
or no land for resettlement, in addition to loss of 
heritage and cultural upheaval. 
5.2.3 
A C C O M M O D A T I O N 
The strategy of accommodation, like that of retreat, 
requires advanced planning and acceptance that 
some coastal zone values could be lost. Many 
coastal structures, particularly residential and small 
commercial buildings, could be elevated on pilings 
for protection from floods. To counter surging wa-
ter and high winds, building codes could specify 
minimum floor elevations and piling depths, as well 
as structural bracing. Drainage could be modified. 
Storm warning and preparedness plans could be 
instituted to protect the affected population from 
extreme events. Where saltwater damages agri-
cultural lands and traditional crops, salt-tolerant 
crops may be a feasible alternative. Fundamental 
changes in land use may be desirable, such as the 
conversion of some agricultural lands to aqua-
cultural uses. 
Human activities that destroy the natural protec-
tion values of coastal resources can be prohibited. 
Perhaps the most important controls would be to 
prohibit filling wetlands, damming rivers, mining 
coral and beach sands, and cutting mangroves. Un-
developed land with sufficient elevation and slope 
can be set aside to accommodate natural re-
establishment of wetlands and mangroves. Within 
148 
I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
deltaic areas, natural processes can be maintained by 
diverting water and sediment. In response to sa-
linity intrusion into groundwater aquifers, manage-
ment controls can be implemented to regulate 
pumping and withdrawal practices. 
Requiring private insurance coverage in vulner-
able areas is an important method to compensate 
injuries and damages caused by natural disasters. It 
forces people to consider whether risks are worth 
taking and provides the necessary funds to repair 
damages and compensate victims. 
5.2.4 
PROTECTION 
This strategy involves defensive measures and other 
activities to protect areas against inundation, tidal 
flooding, effects of waves on infrastructure, shore 
erosion, salinity intrusion and the loss of natural 
resources.19 The measures may be drawn from an 
array of "hard" and "soft" structural solutions. 2 0 
They can be applied alone or in combination, de-
pending on the specific conditions of the site. 
There is no single or generic "best solution," as 
each situation must be evaluated and treated on its 
particular merits. However, there are some basic 
steps in the selection of measures likely to produce 
the highest economic returns. First, those charged 
with planning, design or management respon-
sibilities in the coastal zones should be cognizant of 
the potential for future sea level rise. Moreover, 
proposed plans should leave options open for the 
most appropriate future response. For example, 
many protection structures can be planned and de-
signed with features that allow for future incremen-
tal additions that, if needed, could accommodate 
increased water levels and wave action. This can 
often be done without significant additional costs in 
the initial investment. 
It should be noted that the capital costs associated 
with the "hard" set of options may prove a barrier 
to consideration of this option by developing coun-
tries and small island states. 
5.2.4.1 Hard Structural Options 
Dikes, Levees, and Floodwalls 
are raised embank-
ments or walls constructed for flood protection 
purposes. Depending on circumstances, internal 
drainage may be accomplished by gravity flow, tide 
gates, or pumping systems. 
Seawalls, 
Revetments, 
and Bulkheads 
protect in-
land properties from the direct effects of waves and 
storm tides. Seawalls and heavy revetments (sloping 
armored surfaces) are constructed along open coast 
areas to defend areas against severe wave attack. 
Lighter revetments and bulkheads usually serve as 
secondary lines of defense along open coast areas, or 
as first lines of defense along more sheltered interior 
shores with low to moderate wave exposure. 
Groins are structures placed perpendicular to the 
shoreline. They generally extend from the land into 
the near shore zone and trap sediment moving along 
the shore in order to widen the beach or prevent it 
from eroding. 
Detached Breakwaters are robust structures placed 
offshore, usually parallel to the shoreline, for the 
purpose of dissipating the energy of incoming 
waves to reduce both erosion and damage from 
storms. 
Raising Existing Defensive Structures may be facili-
tated through the incorporation of such a possibility 
in the initial design. Some dikes, levees, floodwalls, 
seawalls, revetments, and breakwaters can be easily 
raised and strengthened in the event of sea level rise 
or increased storm exposure. 
Infrastructure 
Modifications 
may involve the eleva-
tion of piers, wharves, bridges, and road and rail 
beds; modifications to drainage systems; reloca-
tions of various facilities and the institution of 
flood-proofing measures. 
Floodgates or Tidal Barriers, 
which are adjustable, 
dam-like structures, can be placed across estuaries 
to prevent the upstream flooding from storm tides. 
Such barriers are usually left open to avoid interfer-
ing with existing flows. 
Saltwater 
Intrusion 
Barriers 
in surface water 
streams can consist of locks or dams that directly 
block upstream penetration of saline water. Dams 
upstream of a salt penetration zone may be operated 
so that water released from the reservoirs at appro-
priate times can act to minimize the upstream move-
Coastal Zone Management 
149 
ment of salt water. Under certain conditions, un-
derground barriers can be placed by open-cut or 
injection methods to prevent saline water intrusion 
in groundwater aquifers. Fresh groundwater lenses 
in coastal areas can be maintained by fresh water 
recharging techniques. 
wetland loss would result as sea level rises, because 
the area onto which new wetlands might expand is 
less than the area of wetlands at risk.

RETREAT

Beach Filling and Subsequent 
Renourishment 
in-
volves the placement of sandy material along the 
shore to establish and subsequently maintain a de-
sired beach width and shoreline position to dissipate 
wave energy and enhance beaches, particularly for 
recreational and aesthetic purposes.21 
Dune Building, 
and/or the maintenance and preser-
vation of existing dunes, in combination with ade-
quate beach strands, provides an effective measure 
of protection to upland properties against the effects 
of storm tides and wave action. 
Enabling wetlands to migrate inland is one possible 
motivation for a retreat strategy. Coastal wetlands 
can be found along most of the world's coastal mar-
gins, notably in the tropical and subtropical re-
gions. From a global perspective, there is presently 
a large scale de facto retreat in process, given that 
most of the world's coastal wetlands border on land 
areas with low population densities and little major 
development (Fig. 5.3).22 Nevertheless, these areas

can be accomplished 
through the placement of fill material to appropriate 
elevations with subsequent plantations. 
Other Possible Solutions may be found through in-
creasing resilience and reducing vulnerability of 
coastal zone features that are under threat of degra-
dation. Options include continued field research in 
the use of artificial seaweed, artificial reef creation, 
the rehabilitation of natural coral enhance growth, 
increasing coastal protection; instituting pollution 
controls, and preventing the harvesting of man-
groves.

INTRODUCTION 
Most coastal areas contain habitats that are impor-
tant to fish, shellfish, sea turtles, sea birds, and 
marine mammals. These areas also have high recre-
ational, cultural, and aesthetic values for many peo-
ple. Working Group II concluded that a large net

I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
may be developed in the future. Governments 
should focus attention on their wetland areas and, 
where appropriate, establish zones to which wet-
lands will be allowed to retreat using the measures 
outlined in the previous section. However, even a 
retreat cannot prevent a large net loss of coastal 
wetlands. 
Developed nations with large land masses, such 
as the United States and Australia, have imple-
mented retreat strategies along sections of their 
coasts in the interest of allowing coastal ecosystems, 
particularly tidal wetlands, to adjust to increased 
levels of the sea through a slow landward migration. 
By contrast, on small islands the lack of land for 
inland migration would restrict the applicability of 
this option; in the case of atolls, many ecosystems 
could be completely lost. 
5.3.3 
A C C O M M O D A T I O N 
The implications of this option would be a compro-
mise between retreat and protection. However, re-
source exploitation practices would change. For 
example, people may harvest mangrove wood for 
use as pilings to elevate houses. Flood control ef-
forts might alter water flow patterns that could ad-
versely affect the coastal environment. 
5.3.4 
PROTECTION 
This strategy is most relevant for areas having rela-
tively large populations and important infrastruc-
ture. 
These 
conditions 
inherently alter the 
environments. However, the structural measures 
related to a protection strategy can impose addi-
tional alterations not only to the immediate envi-
ronment but also to the unaltered 
coastal 
ecosystems beyond the area of protection. There-
fore, environmental impact assessments are partic-
ularly important when protective measures are 
under consideration. 
5.3.4.1 Hard Structures 
Along ocean coasts, seawalls constructed landward 
of the shorelines would have little immediate impact 
on the beach systems. However, an eroding shore 
would eventually reach the seawalls and result in a 
loss of the natural beach. 2 3 This impact can be 
avoided by means of beach nourishment. Similarly, 
structures could block the inland migration of 
coastal wetlands. For example, in the United States, 
the loss from a one-meter rise would be 29-66 per-
cent under the retreat option, but 50-82 percent if 
shores are protected with bulkheads.24 
Groins trap sediment moving along the shore. 
However, protection of one area is generally at the 
expense of increased erosion downdrift from the 
protected area. Because these structures do not in-
crease the total sediment available to beaches and 
barrier islands, their long-term impact is primarily a 
geographic shift of the erosion. Detached break-
waters often have similar effects, although they al-
low for nearshore habitat shifts in some cases, and 
often provide desirable fish habitats in much the 
same fashion as natural reefs. 
Dams and saltwater intrusion barriers can protect 
water supplies and freshwater habitats. O n the neg-
ative side, these structures can retain sediments that 
in turn can increase erosion of coastal headlands and 
impair the ability of deltaic wetlands to keep pace 
with sea level rise. 
In deltaic areas, levees might be constructed along 
rivers to prevent flooding due to sea level rise. The 
resulting "channeling" of rivers could, in some 
cases, prevent annual river floods from providing 
sediment and nutrients necessary to enable deltas to 
keep pace with sea level rise and maintain the fertil-
ity of agricultural lands. 2 5 
5.3.4.2 Soft Structures 
Soft structures have a less severe impact than hard 
structures, since they usually consist of simulated 
natural features, such as beaches and wetlands.26 
The most common "soft engineering" approach is 
beach nourishment, which involves dredging sand 
from back bays, navigation channels, or offshore, 
or excavating material from a land-based source and 
placing it on the beach. Because beach ecosystems 
are already adapted to annual erosion/accretion cy-
cles, the placement of sand on the beach generally 
has little impact on beach ecosystems. By contrast, 
the dredging itself can seriously disrupt shallow-
water ecosystems and wetland habitats, both due to 
the direct effects of removing material and the re-
sulting increase in turbidity.

INTRODUCTION 
The potential economic implications of responses to 
sea level and temperature rise over periods of fifty to 
one hundred years are extremely difficult to quan-
tify. The variables to be considered include both the 
cost of the strategies themselves, and the effects of 
those costs on national economies. Thus far, only 
the cost of protecting against inundation and ero-
sion has been estimated worldwide. Much more 
research needs to be done. 
The cost of an adaptive response is site-specific. 
The nationwide impact of such costs will be greater 
on rural, subsistence economies, often found in 
coastal areas in developing countries. Losses of re-
sources such as biologically productive wetland 
areas, and important mangrove stands and their 
products would compound such hardship. Reduc-
tion in the productivity of fisheries and the loss of 
land, resources, and jobs are a further considera-
tion. Significant costs can also be associated with the 
establishment and operation of the institutional 
mechanisms necessary to implement retreat or ac-
commodation strategies. Finally, and especially if 
structural response options are exercised, operation 
and maintenance costs are a factor. 
A fundamental element in the decision-making 
process is a cost-benefit assessment to weigh the 
life-cycle costs and economic returns of the various 
alternatives.27 Not all of the important factors are 
totally quantifiable in monetary terms, however. 
This is particularly so for cultural, environmental, 
and social factors. 
Nevertheless, 
these non-
quantifiable aspects must be evaluated and given 
due consideration in an equitable trade-off analysis 
in order to formulate and implement an acceptable 
adaptive response. 
5.4.2 
RETREAT 
In densely populated and productive areas, retreat 
may prove to be the least economically viable re-
sponse option because of nearly irretrievable losses 
involved, or, in the case of small islands, the lack of 
land on which people can resettle. Inundation of 
fertile coastal agricultural land and frequent flood-
ing of industrial sites and urban centers would 
threaten the value of past investments and dras-
tically limit future growth. In such cases, it is highly 
unlikely that the economic benefits of retreat would 
exceed the costs. 
Large-scale resettlements could severely tax the 
planning, infrastructural, and distributive capa-
bilities of most countries, especially for developing 
countries. In particular, small island nations would 
face the most serious economic implications of re-
treat. At its most extreme, it would involve resettle-
ment of the populations of entire nations. 
The slow (albeit increasing) rate of sea level rise 
permits appropriate planning and incremental im-
plementation of retreat options, and this may re-
duce costs. 2 8 However, in the case of arable lands, 
the inability to produce an adequate food supply 
may cause further national hardship through both 
unemployment and loss of exports. 
5.4.3 
A C C O M M O D A T I O N 
Accommodation provides opportunities for inun-
dated land to be used for new purposes. Thus, some 
compensatory economic benefits could be derived 
from accommodation or adaptation to inundation 
and flooding. For example, agricultural land may, 
in some instances, be found suitable for aquacul-
ture; salt-resistant crops may be grown in areas 
previously dependent on freshwater. Nonetheless, 
considerable costs may be involved in the planning 
and restructuring of land use. The necessary expen-
diture may place significant stress on national bud-
gets, especially in developing countries. In the case 
of an increase in extreme events induced by climate 
change, such as tropical storms, altered wave re-
gimes, and storm-surge frequencies, significant ex-
penditures would be involved in disaster planning 
and preventing loss of life. Responding to such 
events would require considerable national plan-
ning and might involve compensation. 
5.4.4 
PROTECTION 
The economic benefits accruing from protection de-
pend on the values of the land being protected. 
Benefit categories, as measured against taking no 
152 
IPCC RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
action include (a) prevention of physical damage to 
property as a result of waves and flooding; (b) pre-
vention of loss of (economic) production and in-
come; (c) prevention of land loss through erosion; 
and (d) the prevention of loss of natural resources 
(environmental and recreational). 
Costs include capital, operation, and mainte-
nance of the protective measures, as well as any 
cultural, environmental, and social changes that 
may result. For example, some hard structural pro-
tection works may cause beaches to disappear. For 
economies heavily dependent on tourism (e.g., 
Caribbean Islands) this may have serious adverse 
consequences. As previously stated, the non-
quantifiable aspects of cultural, environmental, and 
social impacts must be considered when selecting 
any response strategy. Options may be restricted 
for some developing countries because of costs or 
lack of technology. 
5.4.4.1 
Cost Estimates for 
Protection 
Although the potential economic developments in 
the next few decades are difficult to predict, an 
approximation of basic implementation costs is pos-
sible. Although any such calculations are only 
rough approximations, they provide a useful first 
estimate and a guide for future data-collection ef-
forts. Table 5.5 illustrates estimates based on a sea 
level rise scenario of one meter in 100 years, for 181 
countries and territories with a marine coast. These 
estimates show that preventing inundation alone 
would cost, at a minimum, some U.S.$500 billion 
(not discounted over time). 
This value reflects only the marginal or added 
costs of protecting against the effects of a one meter 
rise in water level by the year 2100. It does not 
include any costs associated with basic coastal pro-
tection already in place or necessary to meet present 
coastal defense needs. The estimate does not include 
the value of the unprotected dry land or ecosystems 
that would be lost, nor does it consider the costs of 
responding to saltwater intrusion nor the impacts of 
increased storm frequency. 2 9 
The annual cost of protection amounts to 0.037 
percent of total Gross National Product (GNP). It 
is important to note, however, that the cost burden 
in terms of G N P is not uniform within the commu-
nity of nations. For example, the small low-lying 
island nations of the world would have to commit a 
relatively high proportion of their GNPs to protect 
against a one-meter rise in sea level. Specifically, the 
small island states in the Indian and Pacific Oceans 
would, respectively, have to commit 0.91 of 1 per-
cent and 0.75 of 1 percent of G N P in the one-meter 
rise scenario. For some atoll islands the annual cost 
may be as much as 10-20 percent of their G N P .

INTRODUCTION 
The social and cultural implications of adaptive re-
sponse measures may affect hundreds of millions of 
people living in coastal zones, which have an aver-
age width of 50 kilometers. 3 0 In some coastal areas, 
inhabitants are highly concentrated in a narrow 
coastal belt (e.g., Java, India, and China). 
The lifestyles of many people are tied directly to 
the coast and its predominant local features. The 
coast also features strongly in the mythology of 
many cultures. Numerous places of particular cul-
tural significance are situated on the coast, and 
many people in developed and developing nations 
view the sea, coasts, reefs, and beaches as central to 
their lives. 
Social and cultural implications of adaptive op-
tions are likely to vary considerably from country 
to country and from site to site. Options that are 
socially and culturally beneficial in some situations 
may be less desirable in others. It is particularly 
important that the affected communities are con-
sulted and participate in the decisions to adopt par-
ticular options. This is probably one of the best 
means available to identify the social and cultural 
implications for particular cases. 
5.5.2 
RETREAT 
Retreat, as an option, may imply a partial, incre-
mental process or a sudden large-scale event. In 
some circumstances, there may be a need to relocate 
inhabitants, or even entire communities, which 
could have major financial and social implications in 
developing countries. The loss of the traditional

I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
environment that normally sustains economies and 
cultures and provides for recreational needs, could 
severely disrupt family life and create social insta-
bility, with a resulting adverse impact on the entire 
community, especially on the young and the el-
derly. In addition, places of great cultural signifi-
cance, for example, burial grounds, historic places, 
or religious centers, could also be lost if retreat 
occurs. 
A l l retreat options have been identified as having 
potentially significant implications both socially 
and culturally. This is particularly the case with 
abandonment and the resulting need to resettle 
whole populations. Even though migration is rela-
tively common in some areas, for example, the 
South Pacific, there remains the need for social ad-
justment. Situations where an individual's or a com-
munity's identity is closely associated with a 
particular piece of land or access to particular re-
sources, as in most subsistence economies, can have 
implications that are difficult to resolve. 
The greatest implications of retreat may lie in 
being denied access to the original coast. A well-
planned retreat that provides for access to alterna-
tive resources could minimize some of these im-
pacts.31 A n associated issue is that of the social 
implications for the host people at the place of re-
location. There exists a potential for conflict, and 
existing social services may be heavily taxed in the 
host area if relocation is not well-planned and man-
aged. People may choose not to abandon even vul-
nerable coastal areas in anticipation of climate 
change impacts, if there is strong population pres-
sure in adjacent areas. 
5.5.3 
A C C O M M O D A T I O N 
The social and cultural implications of accommoda-
tion, while not as severe as those of retreat, may still 
be significant. A change in the economic activity of 
an area, for instance, from farming to aquaculture, 
will change lifestyles. Accommodating change may 
lead to living conditions being less desirable, for 
example, if properties are subject to periodic flood-
ing, or if problems with sewage disposal occur. 
Public safety and health will thus be adversely af-
fected by this option. 
Accommodation is a more socially desirable op-
tion when applied in areas where there is a tradition 
of adapting to water, for instance, if people live in 
houses on stilts or in houseboats. 
5.5.4 
PROTECTION 
Protection has fewer identified social and cultural 
implications. However, hard structures are likely to 
have less aesthetic value than the original environ-
ment, and access to the shore may also be restricted 
by some protective options. Beach losses could im-
pair recreation, while loss of wetlands may affect 
fish stocks. If protective options involve non-local 
labor, there may be social and cultural friction 
which could lead to community disruption. Op-
tions that can be implemented by communities 
themselves are less likely to have social and cul-
tural implications than those which require outside 
labor. 
If the protection structures cause alteration to 
places of cultural significance, there could be oppo-
sition to their construction. The loss of any biolog-
ical resources resulting from protection activities 
could also be of cultural significance. In some areas, 
for example, if a significant species is seriously 
threatened it may no longer be available for ritualis-
tic or economic purposes.

5.6.1 INTRODUCTION 
Existing institutions and legal frameworks may be 
inadequate to plan and implement adaptive re-
sponses. New institutions and legal authorities may 
be needed in many coastal states. National legisla-
tion and institutions for coastal zone management 
can provide the needed planning. In addition, legal 
structures to require advance consideration of likely 
impacts—such as environmental impact review by 
those planning new projects—can 
encourage 
needed foresight. 
One matter to consider is that virtually any adap-
tive option involves the use of "private" land. In 
some nations such use by individuals may be pro-
hibited by law; in other states the government may 
Coastal Zone 
Management 
155 
not have authority to use the land without the con-
sent of the landowner; and, in others, the govern-
ment may have the authority to use private land, but 
only upon providing compensation to the land-
owner. 3 2 
An accelerated rate of increase in the global sea 
level also raises the possibility of legal issues per-
taining to maritime boundaries and jurisdiction, 
and transboundary matters. These issues may re-
quire a review of existing international arbitration 
procedures. A n example of the first issue would be 
if a nation loses maritime boundary base-points and 
therefore a legal claim to sea territory, or if beach 
nourishment measures are required in the vicinity of 
national borders. A n example of the second issue 
would be if protective measures interrupt or impede 
the longshore sediment transport benefiting an ad-
joining coastal state. In the worst case, sea level rise 
may result in the total land loss of an island nation; 
the resulting legal implications are difficult to pre-
dict. 3 3 
5.6.2 
RETREAT A N D A C C O M M O D A T I O N 
The resettlement option could raise significant 
transboundary implications. The legal authority 
and institutional capability to manage or direct a 
relocation on a temporary or permanent basis must 
be clearly established. Authorities to facilitate and 
encourage relocation from vulnerable areas, and to 
subsequently deal with the use of abandoned lands 
may be needed. In extreme cases when individuals 
will not leave areas subject to great risk, authorities 
for condemnation of land and facilities may also be 
necessary. 
Whether relocation is on a temporary or a perma-
nent basis, accommodations for displaced inhabi-
tants must be provided. In some coastal states, 
relocation could involve tens of millions of inhabi-
tants. The relocation may be further complicated by 
the lack of land within small coastal or island states. 
If relocation outside such states is required, then the 
assistance of regional or international institutions 
may be needed. 
The first option for both measures is to discour-
age growth in population, or additional develop-
ment in vulnerable areas that would increase either 
the risks of losses or would increase the costs of later 
retreat to unacceptable levels. In order to imple-
ment this option, the coastal state must have the 
institutional facility for identifying vulnerable 
coastal zones. Many developing countries do not 
have the institutional structure and will require as-
sistance to develop a national plan for management 
of coastal resources and coastal development. Alter-
natively, a state might choose to encourage private 
retreat and accommodation actions through non-
regulatory measures, such as providing information 
to the affected population. 
In addition to an institutional structure to plan 
and manage coastal development, legal authorities 
are needed to enforce restrictions or conditions on 
coastal development if a coastal or island state 
chooses to take an active regulatory role for imple-
menting those strategies. Legal authorities may also 
be needed both to ensure the integrity of natural 
coastal protection systems and to avoid placing 
coastal populations and developments in jeopardy 
from sea level rise. For example, a coastal or island 
state may need new authority to restrict access or 
activities to certain areas in order to protect natural 
systems (such as from the use of mangrove for fire-
wood) as well as have the authority to restrict resi-
dential and commercial development (such as new 
settlements on deltas). 
5.6.3 
PROTECTION 
A n important implication of selecting an option to 
protect against sea level rise is liability for the failure 
of public protection structures. Structures to pro-
tect against sea level rise enable commercial, agri-
cultural, and residential activities to continue in 
protected areas. Therefore, people and economic 
resources will be attracted to and concentrate in 
areas so protected. Should the structure fail, signifi-
cant loss of life and property could result. Each type 
of structure is different, and each requires some 
type of maintenance in order to perform as de-
signed. Where the entity responsible for mainte-
nance is different from the entity that designed and/ 
or constructed the structure, it may be difficult to 
assess any liability for damage resulting from a fail-
ure of the structure. Some public or private entity 
within each nation, therefore, must have respon-
sibility for maintenance of the physical integrity of 
these structures.

5.7.1 
INTRODUCTION 
The projected rise in sea level warrants urgent pol-
icy responses in many coastal states, particularly 
those with populated coral atolls and deltas, or 
those with estuary-dependent fisheries. It is imper-
ative that such actions focus on human safety and on 
sustainable development of coastal resources. 
Even though sea level rise is predicted to be a 
relatively gradual phenomenon, adaptive strategies 
may require lead times in the order of 50 to 100 
years, to tailor them to the unique physical, social, 
economic, environmental, and cultural considera-
tions of a particular coastal area. Moreover, even 
though there may be no need to begin building 
dikes that are not needed for 50 years, it is appropri-
ate to begin planning now to avoid actions that 
could increase vulnerability to the impacts of sea 
level rise. It will take 10 years to implement plans, in 
view of the time required for the necessary analyses, 
training the people, developing the plans and mo-
bilizing public and political awareness and support. 
Therefore, the process should begin today. 
Protection from coastal impacts of sea level rise 
and other impacts of global climate change include 
both capital investment in defense structures and 
maintenance costs. Moreover, if the sea continues 
to rise these structures may have to be augmented or 
replaced. Similarly, non-structural options to re-
duce vulnerability to impacts of sea level rise, such 
as land use planning, may require actions to imple-
ment and enforce them. 
It is important to recognize that decisions today 
on planning for coastal development will greatly 
influence costs for later adaptation to impacts of sea 
level rise. Venice, Shanghai, New Orleans, and 
Lagos are all vulnerable because of decisions made 
200-2,000 years ago. It is therefore necessary to 
establish some immediate priorities for planning 
and management of coastal resources, and for tech-
nical and financial assistance to developing coun-
tries to facilitate their planning. 
There is a need to provide developing countries 
with the technical and financial assistance required 
to plan for coastal development in order to reduce 
vulnerability to impacts of sea level rise. There is 
also a need to estimate the future long-term funding 
requirements for developing countries that may be 
required if protection options are needed.34 
Finally, the success of strategies to limit climate 
change is a factor to be considered. Limitation mea-
sures will be likely to reduce the costs of adaptation 
to the coastal impacts of sea level rise; however, it is 
likely that some adaptation to sea level rise will be 
required regardless of the limitation strategies even-
tually implemented. 3 5 
5.7.2 
PRIORITIES FOR ADAPTATION 
5.7.2.1 
Science/Monitoring 
There is still considerable uncertainty regarding sea 
level rise and other impacts of global climate 
change. This makes the selection of adaptation op-
tions extremely difficult. In particular, there is a 
lack of regional, national, and site-specific data that 
is needed to make decisions on adaptive options. 
For example, a system to monitor, detect and 
predict sea level rise is needed to assist in determin-
ing the need for construction of protective struc-
tures or relocation of coastal inhabitants. There is 
also a need for information on other impacts, such 
as changes in tropical storms, in order to plan for 
natural emergencies.36 
5.7.2.2 
Information 
There is a great need to identify those areas that are 
most vulnerable to the impacts of sea level rise. The 
identification should concentrate on densely popu-
lated low-lying areas, deltas, and small atoll islands. 
The need for clearinghouse arrangements to facil-
itate exchange of information and international data 
bases accessible to all nations has also been identi-
fied. 
Development of models and assessment tech-
niques to support coastal planning needs to be un-
dertaken in order to provide decision makers insight 
into the complicated interactions and conflicting 
interests that are involved in coastal zone manage-
ment. Equally important is the transfer to develop-
ing countries of existing coastal adaptation tech-
nologies and the provision of training in coastal 
zone management, engineering, and environmental 
Coastal Zone 
Management 
157 
monitoring. Such training might also include tech-
nology research centers, extension services, tech-
nology advisory committees, technology research 
and development, technology conferences, and pi-
lot projects to enhance technology transfer. 
5.7.2.3 Planning 
Many priorities have been identified within the 
broad area of planning. These include: 
• Emergency 
management 
planning 
to reduce 
vulnerability of inhabitants in areas exposed to 
extreme weather events. 
• Coastal management 
planning 
to reduce im-
pacts on development structures and on natural 
resources of the highest priority. Technical and 
financial assistance to developing countries may 
be required to develop and implement national 
plans for management of coastal development. 
5.7.2.4 Education and Community Participation 
Public education and education of decision makers 
regarding the impacts of sea level rise and the im-
pacts of ongoing activities is essential, so that every-
one understands the risks of development in coastal 
areas.37 The involvement of members of the local 
communities in selecting and implementing re-
sponse options is also essential for the success of 
adaptive responses. 
5.7.3 
PRIORITIES FOR IMPLEMENTING 
ADAPTIVE OPTIONS IN DEVELOPING 
COUNTRIES 
5.7.3.1 Retreat 
Technical assistance to developing countries is re-
quired for timely planning for resettlement and 
emergency management pending resettlement. Fi-
nancial assistance also may be needed to facilitate 
the resettlement. Assessments of potential reloca-
tion sites should be made to minimize dislocation 
difficulties such as linguistic diversity, cultural dif-
ferences, and long-term viability. 
5.7.3.2 Accommodation 
Education, technical assistance, and training are re-
quired for developing countries so that their popu-
lations can understand the risks of development in 
coastal areas in order to reduce vulnerability to im-
pacts of possible sea level rise. 
Technical assistance on alternative economic 
activities—for example, mariculture instead of 
agriculture—is required to mitigate the social, cul-
tural, and economic implications of various op-
tions. Experience in this field exists in several 
developing countries and should be shared. The 
same holds true for alternatives to current coastal 
development activities. For example, using coastal 
areas for tourism rather than for industrial or resi-
dential activities, may also be a solution. 
5.7.3.3 Protection 
Protection options involving structures in most de-
veloping countries are likely to require external as-
sistance. For example, the building of hard 
structures could require assistance such as transfer 
of skills and/or capital. There may also be a need for 
transfer of planning skills to support the choice of 
appropriate options. 
5.7.4 
CRITERIA FOR A L L O C A T I O N OF 
RESOURCES 
In addition to identifying priorities for adaptive re-
sponses it is also appropriate to identify the priori-
ties that might be used to allocate resources. As the 
necessary resources vary considerably, depending 
on the adaptive option and the coastal area, alloca-
tion criteria must include consideration of both the 
options and the area. 
A list of sample criteria are provided in Table 5.6. 
There is no intention to suggest that any one criteria 
should be pre-eminent. Some may be more signifi-
cant in some situations while other criteria may be 
more important than others.

one-meter sea level rise in 100 years; that externalities such 
as other effects of climate change are nil; that present 
boundary conditions (geomorphological, economic, so-
cial) are maintained; and that costs are based on present 
conditions. The estimates assume that current flood risks 
remain constant; e.g., areas flooded once every ten years 
today would still be flooded every ten years when sea level 
has risen one meter. The complete study can be found in an

The First Report of the Resource Use and Man-
agement Subgroup (RUMS) focuses on that subset 
of natural resources which are of common interest 
to most nations, i.e., food, water, land, and biolog-
ical resources. The topics, which were selected at 
the RUMS initial meetings, were: agriculture, ani-
mal husbandry, fisheries, desertification and sali-
nization, forestry, land use, unmanaged ecosystems 
(including biological diversity), and water re-
sources. Various nations produced papers address-
ing one or more of these topics. Based upon these 
contributions, theme papers addressing water re-
sources, biological diversity and food security were 
commissioned from individuals associated with the 
American Association for the Advancement of Sci-
ence's Water Resources and Climate Change Panel, 
United Nations Environment Programme, and the 
Food and Agricultural Organization, respectively. 
In addition, the several papers on each of the above-
mentioned topics were consolidated. 
On October 30-November 1, 1989, R U M S held 
a workshop in Geneva, Switzerland to discuss the 
theme and consolidated topic papers, and to solicit 
additional input from experts from developing na-
tions, academia, and other non-governmental enti-
ties. This workshop was scheduled immediately 
prior to a meeting of the Agriculture, Forestry, and 
Other Human Activities Subgroup (AFOS) to as-
sure broad participation from that Subgroup be-
cause of the potential overlaps on food and forests. 
As this report was produced in parallel with the 
I P C C Science and Impacts Working Groups' first 
report, rather than the more logical series approach, 
special efforts were made to obtain these groups' 
interim findings. Accordingly, the workshop also 
heard reports from Working Groups I and II on 
their efforts, particularly by participants in those 
Groups concerned with agriculture and food secu-
rity. This First Report is a synthesis of all of the 
above efforts. 
Appendix 6.1 lists all the papers contributed to 
the Subgroup, which form the basis of this report. 
The Subgroup is grateful for these contributions, 
and to the I P C C Secretariat for making this report 
possible.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
This report addresses adaptation responses perti-
nent to resource use and management in the event of 
human-induced climate change. These will help so-
cieties anticipate and reduce any negative impacts as 
well as capitalize on any positive consequences. 
Topics addressed here include food security (i.e., 
crops, animal husbandry, fisheries, desertification, 
and salinization), water resources, land use, and 
managed and unmanaged ecosystems (including 
forests and consideration of biological diversity). 
The impacts of, and responses to, human-
induced climate changes on resource use and man-
agement must be considered against a backdrop of 
(a) population growth, which increases the pres-
sures and demands on all resources, (b) technologi-
cal change, which may alleviate some pressures 
while creating others, (c) the hoped-for advance-
ments in economic progress that could, on the one 
hand, increase the per capita demand for some re-
sources but, on the other hand, allow for greater 
support for resource conservation and environmen-
tal protection, and (d) natural climatic variability. 
In many instances, the impacts of human-
induced climate change could be a relatively small 
perturbation on the larger effects resulting from 
increasing populations and other socio-economic 
factors. In other instances, they could be quite sig-
nificant. Human-induced climate change may, in 
some areas, add to these pressures; in others, it may 
relieve them. 
There are several reasons for focusing on adapta-
tion. First, even in the absence of human-induced 
climate change, we need to deal with the climate's 
natural variability. Second, if human-induced cli-
mate change is significant, because of the time lags 
between increases in greenhouse gases (GHG) con-
centration and climate change, and climate change 
and impacts on natural resources, some degree of 
adaptation will be necessary even if all anthro-
pogenic G H G emissions were halted. Third, the 
overall approach toward dealing with climate 
change must consider both limitations and adapta-
tions as one package. Finally, the potential cost of 
adaptation will help to assess the costs associated 
with no action and, therefore, inform decision 
makers on processes for setting limits on green-
house gases. 
There already exists a large reservoir of experi-
ence and knowledge to help formulate and imple-
ment adaptation response strategies in the event of 
climate change: 
• Society and living things have a built-in ability 
to adapt to some degree of climate change be-
cause climate is inherently variable at all time 
scales. Through the ages they have developed 
the capability, and a suite of responses, to 
adapt—in many instances, successfully—to ex-
treme events (e.g., floods, droughts). 
• As noted in the Scientific Assessment, human 
activities will alter the climate; however, eco-
nomic and technological progress will also 
make it easier to cope with climatic variability 
and extreme events through earlier warning 
systems, better infrastructure, and greater fi-
nancial resources. 
• Several climatic zones span the globe, and re-
source use and management is an ongoing chal-
lenge in each of these zones. Therefore, one 
area could draw upon experiences and practices 
in those zones that most closely approximate 
future expected conditions in their area. 
166 
Resource Use and 
Management 
167 
This is especially true for activities that are man-
aged intensely (e.g., agriculture, water use, and 
plantation forests). However, even if there are sim-
ilarities in the climates, other conditions may be 
sufficiently different to preclude use of analogues 
without modifications. In addition, there may be 
legal, economic, institutional or cultural bar-
riers to translocating adaptation measures from one 
locale to another. More importantly, the ability 
to adapt is not uniform: developing nations would 
have greater difficulty in adapting, especially if that 
requires substantial financial expenditures and in-
stitutional changes, for example those which could 
occur as a result of loss of cultural and social heri-
tage. 
Natural ecosystems, while having a degree of 
inherent adaptability, are less able to adjust if 
the disturbance is large or rapid. Increasing popula-
tions and associated demand for land for a vari-
ety of human activities including agriculture, hu-
man settlements, grazing and plantation forests, 
and for forest products (e.g., fuelwood, timber); 
and the use of inland and coastal waters for waste 
disposal have radically altered some natural eco-
systems and made others more vulnerable in many 
parts of the world. Thus, adaptive policies may 
be necessary to deal with the impacts on such eco-
systems: the faster the rate of climate change— 
or more importantly, the rate of occurrence of the 
impacts of climate change—the greater the need for 
developing, evaluating, and implementing such pol-
icies. 
A major obstacle to development and analysis of 
adaptive policy options for resource use is the sub-
stantial uncertainty associated with each link in the 
chain of calculations necessary to undertake such 
analysis. 
First, credible regional 
estimates of 
changes in critical climatic factors (e.g., tempera-
ture; soil moisture; diurnal, annual, and seasonal 
variability; frequencies and magnitudes of extreme 
events such as droughts, floods, and storms) are 
simply not available. While temperature, if any-
thing, is likely to increase, the rate and magnitude of 
temperature change is uncertain. For some of the 
other critical climatic factors, even the direction of 
change is uncertain. Second, many processes link-
ing changes in climate and in greenhouse gas con-
centrations to the effects on the biosphere and other 
natural resources are not well understood or charac-
terized. Third, there are uncertainties regarding the 
linkages between natural resource effects and socio-
economic consequences. 
Nevertheless, these uncertainties do not preclude 
planning and taking anticipatory actions, where ap-
propriate. Such action may be indicated in circum-
stances where the impacts or costs of reacting to 
climate change could be very high or irreversible; 
where the lifetime of decisions is long enough to be 
adversely affected by a change in the climate; or 
where there are significant technological, informa-
tional, cultural, legal, or other barriers to efficient 
adaptation. Most importantly, many actions that 
would help societies adapt to any climate change 
would be worthwhile for other reasons—i.e., they 
need to be undertaken for wise and sustainable re-
source use and management whether or not climate 
changes. As elaborated below, the focus should be 
on such actions as we further develop scientific and 
economic understanding. 
Temperature increase attributable to atmospheric 
composition change is expected to be larger at 
higher latitudes, 
particularly in the Northern 
Hemisphere. In the Southern Hemisphere, there 
may be impacts on agriculture in areas already suf-
fering from environmental problems, e.g., soil deg-
radation. For small island states, sea level rise will 
expose vulnerabilities. While some semiarid areas 
may be vulnerable, some in the north may, in fact, 
benefit, e.g., due to increases in agricultural pro-
ductivity. Moreover, some sectors are more able to 
adapt. 
In agriculture, and to some extent in forestry, the 
rate at which technology is introduced is, on the 
whole, likely to accelerate with the advent of bio-
technology and genetic engineering. The efficiency 
with which many countries have adopted new tech-
nology in these sectors, albeit often without ade-
quate environmental assessment, suggests a con-
siderable ability to adapt to new circumstances 
whatever their cause; however, the closer farming is 
to subsistence farming the less the likelihood that it 
would adapt without assistance and "appropriate 
design." 
In recognition of the uncertainties regarding re-
source use and management, the Subgroup provides 
a menu of options rather than more specific recom-
mendations. These options need to be analyzed by 
each nation taking into consideration its specific 
social, environmental, and economic context. Based 
on this, a nation can decide on the precise mix of 
168 
I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
response options that would maximize its net socio-
economic (including environmental) well-being. 
This inevitably must involve achieving the neces-
sary balance between various competing societal 
objectives (of which dealing with climate change is 
one) and allocating limited financial, technical and 
human resources between them. Accordingly, eval-
uation of each option should be based on the criteria 
outlined below. A n option should be: 
• Flexible, i.e., adjustable in light of new knowl-
edge, reductions in uncertainties and a variety 
of climatic conditions, and add to the resilience 
of resource use and management, i.e., the op-
tion should be successful whether or not cli-
mate changes. 
• Timely, considering the time it takes to formu-
late effective responses, and for any effects on 
natural resources to be manifested. 
• Feasible, based on its compatibility with other 
climate-related responses and socio-economic 
objectives, and with institutional, economic, le-
gal, and cultural barriers and the degree of diffi-
culty in overcoming them. 
• Economically justifiable, on grounds other than 
climate change, while we further develop our 
scientific and economic understanding. This in-
cludes ensuring cost-effectiveness and eco-
nomic efficiency, and consideration of oppor-
tunity costs—aspects that are likely to be met if 
it provides other non-climate-related benefits. 
Such analysis should also consider the broad 
range of social and environmental factors. 
In some instances, options may have to be analyzed 
at the subnational levels, because they may make 
sense in one area but not in another. In other in-
stances, such options analysis may be done on a 
national or even on a bi- or multi-national basis 
(e.g., for rivers crossing international boundaries). 
To assist in this, national, regional, and interna-
tional institutions may have to be strengthened 
(or, where appropriate, new ones established). Such 
actions could also help implement several of the 
options 
mentioned below, 
e.g., 
inventorying, 
monitoring, assessments and information and tech-
nology transfer. 
The options in this document have been classified 
into three categories, as described below. 
CATEGORY A 
Category A consists of options that would augment 
our knowledge base to make reasoned judgment on 
response strategies dealing with climate change, and 
should be undertaken in advance of accurate predic-
tions of climate change impacts. This category in-
cludes: 
• Developing inventories and data bases of the 
current state of resources. 
• Documenting, cataloguing, and making more 
accessible the information on resource use and 
management practices under the widely diver-
gent, existing climatic conditions since many of 
the response strategies identified here already 
exist and are in current use around the world. 
• Improving our scientific understanding of, and 
the methodological tools for predicting changes 
in, critical climatic factors, their impacts on nat-
ural resources and their socio-economic conse-
quences. 
• Developing estimates of the costs and benefits 
for both adaptation and limitation measures to 
help determine the optimal mix of responses 
that would maximize social well-being. 
• Undertaking studies and assessments to gauge 
the resilience of resources and their vulner-
ability to climate change which may help estab-
lish priorities regarding which areas—and, 
within areas, which 
resources—authorities 
should focus upon. 
• Establishing systems that monitor the status of 
climate, resources, and rates of change in status 
to give early warning of further potential 
changes and trends. 
• Encouraging research and development by both 
public and private enterprises directed toward 
more efficient forestry, agricultural, land and 
water use practices, and biotechnological inno-
vation with adequate safeguards for public 
health and safety, and environmental protec-
tion. This may require developing new or mod-
ified institutional, legal, and financial measures 
that (i) would allow innovators to benefit from 
their R & D , and (ii) encourage individuals and 
communities to develop an economic stake in 
conservation and in efficient and sustainable re-
source use and management. 
• Continuing existing research and development 
Resource Use and 
Management 
169 
on methods to cope with the potentially worst 
consequences (e.g., developing more drought-
or salinity-resistant cultivars) and, in conjunc-
tion with improvements in feed, developing 
more efficient livestock strains and/or breeds 
using classical and modern breeding techniques 
such as genetic engineering, which would help 
keep farming and forestry options open, and re-
search on agrometeorology or agroclimatology. 
Other measures in Category A pertinent to food 
security and land use include new food products 
that can be more easily stored and improvement of 
storage facilities where yields tend to be unstable; 
development of baseline information on and mon-
itoring changes in climate, crop production, pest 
and disease incidence, livestock fecundity and qual-
ity, and fisheries at local, regional, and global levels; 
protection of germ plasm resources and biodiversity 
(including increased research on the preservation of 
biological resources in situ and ex situ); investiga-
tions into the size and location of protected natural 
areas and conservation corridors; increased R & D to 
enable fuller utilization of felled trees, and to in-
crease sustainable yields for traditional and new 
uses of forests and associated products (e.g., for fuel 
wood, chemicals, materials, fruits, and nuts). 
CATEGORY B 
Category B consists of responses that are probably 
economically justified under present-day condi-
tions and could be undertaken for sound resource 
management reasons, even in the absence of any 
climate change, to meet increasing demands on 
these resources in a sustainable manner. In general, 
this would mean improving the efficiency of the use 
of natural resources by increased productivity and 
fuller utilization of the "harvested" component of 
resources and by waste reduction. Measures that 
could be implemented in the short-term include: 
• Increased emphasis on the development and 
adoption of technologies which may increase 
the productivity or efficiency (per unit of land 
and water) of crops, forests, livestock, fish-
eries, and human settlements consistent with 
the principles of sustainable growth and devel-
opment. Such efficiencies reduce the demand 
for land for a variety of human activities includ-
ing agriculture, plantation forests, grazing and 
human settlements, which is the major cause of 
conversion of natural ecosystems and loss of 
biological diversity. In addition to alleviating 
pressures on land, such measures would also 
help reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. On 
the other hand, in areas where carrying capaci-
ties are strained or extended, appropriate mea-
sures to expand carrying capacities should be 
considered, e.g., by implementing pollution 
control measures, improving access to potable 
water or transportation infrastructure. Exam-
ples of options to increase efficiency include 
more efficient milk and meat production per 
unit product; improved food storage and distri-
bution; and better irrigation water management 
practices and drainage, which would allow wa-
ter supplies to serve greater areas, and limit 
salinization. 
• Increased promotion and strengthening of re-
source conservation and sustainable resource 
use—especially in highly vulnerable areas. Cli-
mate change may or may not exacerbate condi-
tions in marginal and endangered ecological and 
agricultural systems and overused water basins. 
Assessments of the potential impacts of climate 
change might help clarify this point. In areas 
that are likely to be further stressed, various 
initiatives could be explored for conserving the 
most sensitive and valuable resources including 
strengthening conservation measures, manag-
ing development 
of highly vulnerable re-
sources, and promoting reforestation 
and 
afforestation. Identification of the most sensi-
tive and valuable resources would necessarily 
be based upon each society's consideration of 
relevant social, cultural, environmental, and 
economic factors. 
• Acceleration of economic development efforts 
in developing countries. Because these coun-
tries have largely resource-based economies, 
efforts improving agriculture and natural re-
source use would be beneficial. Such efforts 
would help formation of such capital as may be 
necessary to adapt to climate change, and gen-
erally make sustainable growth and develop-
ment more feasible. 
• Developing methods whereby local populations 
and resource users gain a stake in conservation 
and sustainable resource use, e.g., by investing 
170 
I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
resource users with clear property rights and 
long-term tenure, and allowing voluntary water 
transfer or other market mechanisms. 
Other options in this category include: maintaining 
flexibility in resource use to the extent practicable; 
decentralizing, as practicable, decision making on 
resource use and management, while assuring coor-
dination with adjacent jurisdictions and incorporat-
ing mechanisms whereby interests of the broader 
society are also considered; strengthening existing 
flood management measures; continuing and im-
proving national and international agricultural and 
natural resource research/extension institutions; 
strengthening mechanisms for technology transfer 
and development; and reviewing subsidies for natu-
ral resource use. 
CATEGORY C 
Category C are responses that, because they are 
costly, should be considered in the longer-term 
once uncertainties regarding climate change impacts 
are reduced. Options in this category include, as 
and where appropriate: building large capital struc-
tures (e.g., dams); examining the feasibility of and, 
if appropriate, strengthening and enlarging pro-
tected natural areas; establishing conservation corri-
dors; as appropriate, reviewing and eliminating 
direct and indirect subsidies and incentives for and 
institutional barriers to inefficient resource use; and 
developing alternatives to current resource-based 
livelihoods. Many of these options may have to be 
taken in anticipation of the effects of climate 
change. 
In recognition of the importance and special situ-
ation of developing nations, the issues of technol-
ogy transfer and financial assistance are deferred to 
the Response Strategy Working Group's Task B 
report. 
In summary, development and analysis of limita-
tion and adaptation strategies must be harmonized. 
There is a relationship between the timing and costs 
of limitation and adaptation: the slower the rate of 
climate change, the easier it would be to adapt, and 
vice versa. Limitation measures should be consis-
tent with adaptation goals, where possible. Thus, 
analysis of monoculture plantations to absorb C 0 2 
should consider their potential negative impact on 
biological diversity. Moreover, analysis of the rela-
tive merits of various limitations strategies should 
consider other non-warming consequences of con-
trolling the various gases (either individually or to-
gether) including, e.g., direct effects of C O a and 
CFCs on the biosphere. Thus a truly comprehen-
sive approach toward human-induced climate 
change should recognize that controlling the differ-
ent gases might have different effects on the adaptive 
capacity of natural resources. 
There is a range of adaptive measures that could 
be used to implement response strategies tailored to 
national situations. These strategies should focus 
primarily on addressing current problems that seem 
likely to be intensified by climate change. In consid-
ering the above three categories of options, particu-
lar attention and support should be given to those 
developing nations which appear to be most vulner-
able to the impact of climate change but the least 
able—in financial and human capital terms—of re-
sponding to them.

T H E IMPORTANCE OF CLIMATE FOR 
SOCIO-ECONOMIC A N D 
ENVIRONMENTAL WELL-BEING 
The climate affects all living things, and in turn, 
they affect the climate. It influences where and how 
human beings live, the kind of shelter we build, the 
quantity and quality of food and water we ingest, 
what we wear each day, as well as how and where 
we spend our leisure time. 
Resources and their use and management depend 
upon the climate. It is a major determinant of agri-
cultural and biological productivity in managed and 
natural lands, water supply and demand, and the 
distribution, types, and composition of the flora 
and fauna. Clearly, a significant climate change 
could affect, for better or worse, the very resources 
upon which life itself depends and, through that, 
the social, environmental, and economic well-being 
of this planet. 
6.1.2 
STRUCTURE A N D C O N T E N T OF 
REPORT 
This report offers a menu of options that could help 
societies adapt resource use and management to any 
effects of human-induced climate changes (hereafter 
referred to as "climate change" unless otherwise 
qualified). 
Such adaptation 
will 
be 
necessary 
whether it is desired to reduce negative impacts or 
capitalize on any positive aspects. The options pre-
sented here could (a) reduce the uncertainties re-
garding the effects of climate change on resource use 
and management, and (b) improve the ability of 
nations/regions to adapt to the effects of climate 
change in both the short and long term, should that 
be necessary. Short-term adaptation options identi-
fied here may be economically justified under 
present-day conditions and might be beneficial even 
if climate were not to change, whereas long-term 
options would generally be costlier and should be 
considered after uncertainties regarding climate 
change and its impacts are reduced. 
It is expected that some options would be desir-
able for some nations but not others. Furthermore, 
within nations, an option may be suitable in one 
area, but not in another. It is hoped that nations will 
evaluate the desirability and suitability of each op-
tion, taking into consideration the particular situa-
tion^) within their jurisdiction. 
This report generally avoids narrowing the menu 
by eschewing recommendations of specific options 
because such recommendations should be based 
upon evaluations of their social, environmental, and 
economic consequences (including cost-effective-
ness, economic efficiency and suitability for a given 
area); however, such evaluations cannot currently 
be undertaken with sufficient confidence—espe-
cially at the regional scale, which is the scale at 
which the status of resources usually has to be as-
sessed. 
6.1.3 
POSSIBLE A N D LIKELY CHANGES IN 
CRITICAL CLIMATIC FACTORS 
Scientists agree that an increase in greenhouse gas 
concentrations will eventually be followed by an 
increase in the globally averaged 
temperature. 
However, there are significant scientific uncertain-
ties regarding the magnitude, rate, and timing of 
such change due to any specified level (e.g., a dou-
bling) of greenhouse gas concentrations. 
Temperature, moreover, is only one aspect of the 
climate. There are other climatic factors that are just 
as, if not more, critical to sustaining life on this 
171 
172 
I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
planet and to the status of resource use and manage-
ment. These include precipitation, soil moisture, 
wind speed, the frequencies and magnitudes of ex-
treme events such as floods, droughts, hot and cold 
waves, hurricanes, cyclones, and other storms, and 
climatic variability on diurnal, seasonal, and annual 
scales. With respect to many of these critical cli-
matic aspects, scientists are uncertain regarding the 
direction of change as well as their rates, magni-
tudes, and timings. 
These uncertainties multiply further as one at-
tempts to estimate changes on spatial scales which 
are less-than-global (e.g., regions or watersheds) or 
temporal scales that are less than annual (e.g., sea-
sonal, weekly, daily). However, it is at these scales 
that assessments regarding the status of, and im-
pacts on, resource use and management have to be 
made to be credible. Yet a wide range of plausible 
climate change scenarios can be devised to test sensi-
tivities of systems. 
6.1.4 
POSSIBLE A N D LIKELY EFFECTS O N 
RESOURCES A N D SOCIO-ECONOMIC 
WELL-BEING 
Resources 
will be affected directly because of 
changes in critical climatic factors and in greenhouse 
gas concentrations, and indirectly because of sea 
level rise (see the report of the Coastal Zone Man-
agement Subgroup). In turn, these impacts on re-
sources will be translated into socio-economic 
(including environmental) consequences. 
The impacts of human-induced climate changes 
on resource use and management must be consid-
ered against a backdrop of population growth that 
will increase the pressures and demands on all re-
sources, and technological change which may alle-
viate 
some pressures 
while 
creating 
others. 
Moreover, the hoped-for improvement in each in-
dividual's economic status will have a complicated 
effect on resources. On the one hand, economic 
growth could increase the per capita demand for 
some resources and may increase greenhouse gas 
emissions; on the other, it also allows for greater 
support for resource conservation and environmen-
tal protection. 
In many instances, the impacts of climate change 
could be a relatively small perturbation on the larger 
effects resulting from increasing populations and 
other socio-economic factors. Human-induced cli-
mate change will, in some areas, add to these pres-
sures; in others, it may actually relieve them. In 
addition to the scientific uncertainties associated 
with estimates of various critical climatic factors 
(noted in Section 6.1.3) which themselves serve as 
inputs to estimates of resource use and socio-
economic consequences, there are other uncertain-
ties regarding the impacts of climate change: 
• There are uncertainties regarding the relation-
ships between climate, resources and socio-
economic consequences. 
• There are interconnections (feedbacks) between 
estimates of atmospheric greenhouse gas con-
centrations, the various critical climatic factors, 
resource 
use, 
and 
socio-economic 
conse-
quences that are not well understood. 
While recognizing the uncertainties in all the 
above steps, the following general statements can be 
made regarding resource use and management in the 
event of climate change: 
• The ability to match water supply with demand 
will vary from area to area; temporal and spatial 
precipitation patterns will change as well as 
frequencies 
and magnitudes of floods and 
droughts. A l l this will occur in ways that are 
not for the most part determinable now, though 
some aspects, such as earlier snowmelt, would 
be more likely, as would changes in demand for 
water. The net effect in some areas would be 
positive; and in others, negative. 
• Food production at the global level could, in 
the face of estimated climate changes, be sus-
tained at levels sufficient to meet world de-
mand. However, there might be substantial 
dislocations in some areas in the agricultural 
sector: some would become more productive, 
others less. Agroclimatic zones in the mid- and 
higher-latitudes would shift poleward. In addi-
tion, there will probably have to be significant 
adjustments in types of crops raised and in man-
agement practices to optimize farm incomes, 
and to avoid localized food shortages in some 
areas where poor economic conditions may not 
allow food requirements to be otherwise met 
(via domestic and international markets/trade). 
Resource Use and Management 
173 
However, because agriculture is a heavily man-
aged system with substantial flexibility, such 
adjustments (either in absolute terms or in their 
rate) may be within the bounds of human expe-
rience and likely technological progress—at 
least for the next several decades. 
• Whether or not fisheries become more or less 
productive, the spatial and temporal distribu-
tion of commercial marine fisheries may be 
changed. Some fishing communities (and/or 
nations) may gain at the expense of others. 
• Impacts on unmanaged or natural ecosystems 
could be critical. If the rate of climate change is 
more rapid than their rate of adaptation, species 
composition and biodiversity may be affected. 
However, established growth may persist for 
decades or longer, and, in some cases, degener-
ate. Nevertheless shifts in climatic zones could, 
over the span of several decades or centuries, 
shift species poleward or to higher altitudes or 
lead to cases of extinction. Moreover, if the rate 
of climate change is sufficiently rapid, ensem-
bles of species may end up trapped in climatic 
regimes for which they are not generally suit-
able and some species may not adapt quickly 
enough to prevent their extinction. The effects 
on migratory species may be mixed: the longer 
the migratory route, the greater the likelihood 
of disruption. 
• Climate zones for temperate and boreal forests 
could shift northward, which would affect pro-
ductivity and biomass generation. 
• There may be changes in the location and extent 
of deserts and salinized lands. 
Such climate change as could occur is expected to 
be greater as one moves poleward—this is partic-
ularly true for the Northern Hemisphere. How-
ever, the physical effects of climate change on 
resource use and management may not follow the 
same pattern (i.e., increasing effects with latitude). 
However, socio-economic impacts due to these 
effects could have a more complicated pattern. 
Many of the northern countries—being more de-
veloped, having stronger economies and greater 
wealth per capita—are better able to adapt to the 
effects of climate change than would many develop-
ing nations. This would be particularly true for 
developing nations that have relatively long coast-
lines. 
6.1.5 
ADAPTATION OBJECTIVES 
The ultimate objective of adaptation is to maximize 
social well-being (which incorporates environmen-
tal and economic well-being) for a given set of cli-
matic conditions (or trends in these conditions). 
Such well-being has to be maximized over the span 
of this (and succeeding) generations. To achieve 
this, society has to take advantage of any positive 
impacts resulting from climate change, while also 
reducing negative impacts. Thus, another adapta-
tion objective would be to place society in a position 
to respond rapidly and efficiently to the impacts of 
climate change. 
In attempting to maximize social well-being, it 
should be noted that there are several societal goals 
that are partly in competition with each other. 
These include the need for agricultural and eco-
nomic development and growth to enhance both 
economic and food security even as populations 
increase, and the need to assure that such economic 
development and growth is done in a sustainable 
manner so that the resource base is not degraded 
and is consistent with the need for a clean and 
healthy environment. The importance that one so-
ciety (or segment of society) places on each of these 
goals is determined by a variety of factors including 
current socio-economic status, cultural traditions, 
institutional systems, expectations for the future, 
and historical factors. Because of these competing 
considerations, as noted in Section 6.1.2, it is to be 
expected that some adaptation options could maxi-
mize social well-being for one set of social, environ-
mental, and economic circumstances but not for 
another, and that different societies (or segments of 
societies) would choose to pursue various options 
to different degrees.

The menu provided in this report is designed to help 
societies adapt to climate change by anticipating and 
reducing expected negative impacts or capitalizing 
on any positive aspects. Information on the status of 
resources and their use and management under a 
174 
I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
variety of climatic regimes would assist societies 
learn from existing analogues to conditions that 
might reasonably be expected in the future. 
Adaptive policy responses, which could include 
both actions taken in anticipation of expected cli-
mate change (or its impacts) as well as actions un-
dertaken after the impacts are evident, are desirable 
for several reasons. 
• Whether or not there will be significant human-
induced climate change, the climate's inherent 
variability makes adaptation unavoidable. 
• Assuming human-induced climate change is 
significant, the expected delays, which could be 
decades long, between increases in greenhouse 
gas concentrations and changes in climate and 
the status of resources make some adaptation 
essential—regardless of how rapidly green-
house gas concentrations are limited. 
• Both limitations and adaptations must be con-
sidered as a package. This would assure the 
cost-effectiveness of the entire set of response 
strategies that might be necessary to deal with 
human-induced climate change. 
To the extent practicable, limitations should not 
make adaptation more difficult, and vice versa. Op-
tions for limitation strategies should be evaluated 
carefully to ensure they would not be counter-
productive in terms of adaptation (or its ultimate 
objectives). Analysis of monoculture plantations to 
absorb C 0 2 should consider their potential nega-
tive impacts on biological diversity. Similarly, one 
factor to be considered in the analysis of limitation 
measures is that an increase in carbon dioxide con-
centration would make crops and vegetation more 
resilient by enhancing photosynthesis rates and 
making them more resistant to drought and salinity, 
but that the combined effects of C 0 2 and climate 
change are uncertain. 
• Moreover, decisions on the degree and rate of 
limitation(s) that may be necessary should take 
into consideration the rates of change to which 
societies and ecological systems can adapt. 
• Anticipatory policies may be necessary in cir-
cumstances where project lifetimes are so long 
that the project's usefulness (or benefit/cost 
ratios) could be severely compromised if cli-
mate were to change significantly during its 
lifetime. Such circumstances could include con-
struction of new dams, establishment or aug-
mentation of conservation areas, and selection 
of seedlings for forestation. 
• Anticipatory policies may also have to be con-
sidered for situations where the impacts or costs 
of reacting to climate change are expected to be 
very high, unacceptable or irreversible. This 
might be the case for some actions that might 
place unique or critical resources—e.g., some 
species—at greater risks of extinction. 
• Anticipatory policies will have to consider 
whether there are barriers to adaptation, such as 
lack of technology and information or cultural 
or legal barriers that may prevent or inhibit 
efficient responses. 
While noting the need for adaptive response strat-
egies, it should also be recognized that adaptation to 
climate is at least as old as the human species. Even 
without man's influence, climate is extremely vari-
able. At any location the timing and amount of 
precipitation and temperature varies at all time 
scales (seasonal, annual, or decadal). Moreover, 
droughts, floods (and other extreme events) occur 
regularly. These climatic variations indicate that hu-
mans and living things have some built-in ability to 
adapt to climate change. 
While it is possible that human activities and tech-
nology could change the climate, society's ability to 
cope with such climatic events is now higher than 
ever because of technology (including better com-
munications, transportation, and food storage), and 
increased wealth. The lessons learned from these 
events can all be applied in formulating and imple-
menting responses to human-induced 
climate 
change. Moreover, people in one area can learn 
from those in other areas. We now grow several 
crops over a wider range of climate (and tempera-
ture) than is "predicted" under scenarios that would 
double greenhouse gas concentrations. Thus, if 
southern Canada were to become as warm and dry 
as, say, Texas then it may be able to learn from the 
agricultural practices in the latter area to better 
adapt to and cope with the impact of climate change 
on food security even though not all other condi-
tions would be identical. As long as the new climate 
in an area has existing analogues anywhere in the 
world, there is the potential for such adaptation— 
especially for activities that are managed intensely 
Resource Use and 
Management 
175 
(e.g., agriculture, water use, and plantation for-
ests). 
However, this ability to adapt is not uniform. It 
will vary from nation to nation depending upon its 
economic and institutional capabilities, and the de-
gree of net negative impacts due to climate change. 
Moreover, as noted, even if there are similarities in 
the climates, other conditions may be sufficiently 
different to preclude use of analogues. In addition, 
there may be legal, institutional or cultural barriers 
to adaptation. 
Increasing populations, and associated demand 
for land for agriculture, human settlements, grazing 
and plantation forests, and for forest products (e.g., 
fuelwood, timber), have reduced the area of some 
natural ecosystems. Moreover, human activities 
have made certain natural ecosystems more vulner-
able in many parts of the world even though they 
have a degree of inherent variability. Thus, adaptive 
policies may be necessary to enhance the resilience 
of such ecosystems: the faster the rate of climate 
change, the greater the need of developing, evaluat-
ing and implementing such policies.

As noted above (Section 6.1.5), the basic rationale 
for considering and/or adopting response strategies 
is to maximize social well-being (which includes 
economic and environmental quality). Thus, that 
should be the basis for any evaluation of responses. 
While attempting this, one has to be cognizant that 
resources (whether they be natural or human and 
financial) are limited. Opportunity costs must be 
considered: expenditures on a response strategy will 
divert resources from other potentially worthwhile 
social uses. These include public health, environ-
mental and safety needs, and economic growth. 
Wealth generated by such growth will eventually 
make response measures more affordable. Poverty 
is one of the major causes of environmental degra-
dation. It is also one reason why poorer nations 
employ obsolete technologies that often are more 
inefficient in terms of both energy use and emis-
sions. Therefore, cost-effectiveness and an assess-
ment that benefits exceed costs are necessary, but 
not sufficient, criteria for ensuring maximum social 
well-being and economic efficiency: sufficiency can 
only be established if it can be determined that the 
cost (including monetized and unmonetized conse-
quences) incurred in the development and imple-
mentation of a response strategy is the best use for 
society's resources. 
Several steps should be taken prior to any evalua-
tion of response strategies. As a start, one should 
differentiate between the possible and likely im-
pacts of climate change. Inherently, anything that 
does not violate a law of nature (e.g., the Third Law 
of Thermodynamics) is possible. Thus, dealing with 
merely what is possible is not a wise use of re-
sources. Ideally, one would need to know the prob-
ability distributions for climate change effects (as a 
function of space and time). However, the uncer-
tainties associated with climate change and its ef-
fects 
generally 
preclude 
such 
differentiation 
between potential and likely effects. These uncer-
tainties also restrict the analysis of response strate-
gies in terms of their effectiveness and intercom-
parisons of the social, economic, and environmental 
consequences of implementing response strategies 
versus doing nothing. Nevertheless, adaptive re-
sponse strategies can be evaluated on the basis of 
several criteria. 
In evaluating options, one needs to keep in mind 
that the direction, magnitude, and timing of impacts 
are uncertain and take into consideration differ-
ences in the carrying capacities for various re-
sources. Specific criteria—all of which should be 
met—include: 
• Flexibility. 
Since the effects of climate change 
are uncertain, responses need to be successful 
under a variety of conditions, including no-
climate-change. Thus, flexibility is a matter of 
keeping options open. For instance, a market 
mechanism for pricing and allocating resources 
will work under a variety of conditions and, 
therefore, is flexible. 
• Economically 
Justifiable 
Based on Other Bene-
fits. This is often referred to as "doing things 
that make sense anyway." Such policies would 
be justifiable in their own right, i.e., in the 
absence of climate change. They would neces-
sarily have to meet other societal goals besides 
preparing for climate change; thus, they would 
be beneficial even if climate were not to change. 
176 
IPCC RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
Such policies include those that would enhance 
net public well-being by, e.g., environmental 
quality, or food or economic security. Thus, 
even if climate does not change, society would 
reap net benefits from this approach. Factors to 
consider in assessing whether a policy "makes 
sense anyway" include economic efficiency 
(including 
environmental 
factors), 
cost-
effectiveness, and opportunity costs. 
• Timing. Since climate change may not be felt for 
decades, the benefits of adaptive policies may 
also not be realized for decades. Thus, expen-
sive anticipatory actions will not be justified 
unless the expected costs of climate change are 
very high. For instance, a dam should not be 
constructed today in anticipation of being 
needed several decades hence. O n the other 
hand, if a dam is being built now, it may be 
useful to "design i n " the ability for future 
augmentations—if that changes the costs only 
marginally. Factors to consider in assessing 
timeliness include: (a) whether there is a critical 
point in time before the adaptation strategy 
needs to be implemented, and (b) how much 
time does it take to efficiently develop the re-
sponse (and necessary technology), and educate 
and disseminate it to users/implementers? 
• Feasibility. Adaptive strategies must be consis-
tent with legal, institutional, political, social, 
cultural, and financial arrangements. These are 
critical aspects of their "do-ability." However, 
in some instances, policies may specifically be 
directed at modifying or removing such bar-
riers. 
• Compatibility. 
Response strategies for one sec-
tor (or activity) should not run counter to adap-
tive strategies in other sectors or activities. 
Similarly, adaptive strategies should not defeat 
or negate limitation strategies (or their objec-
tives), and vice versa. See Section 6.1.5. 
As noted in Sections 6.1.2 and 6.1.5, in many 
instances evaluations of adaptive options may have 
to be undertaken on relatively small geographical 
scales (i.e., regions or watersheds) and consider the 
specific social, economic, and environmental con-
text. This is necessary to achieve a balance between 
various competing societal objectives, and thereby 
maximize net social well-being. In some instances 
responses may have to be evaluated at the regional, 
national or sub-national level. However, no evalua-
tions were attempted for this report. 
Readers, while going through the response strat-
egy options in the subsequent sections, should keep 
the above evaluation criteria in mind to judge for 
themselves the suitability of the options in their 
particular context.

The options identified in this report were culled 
from topic papers prepared for R U M S by various 
nations, 
theme papers contributed by invited 
speakers or organizations, and papers and com-
ments provided at the Subgroup Workshop in Oc-
tober 1989. This workshop attempted to classify 
identified response strategies into three categories: 
• Those that augment our knowledge base to 
make reasoned judgment on response strategies 
dealing with climate change and that should be 
undertaken in advance of the availability of ac-
curate regional predictions (Category A ) — 
e.g., inventorying, monitoring, assessments, 
and information and technology transfer. 
• Responses that are probably economically jus-
tified under present-day conditions (see Section 
6.3) and that, therefore, could be implemented 
in the short term (Category B)—e.g., measures 
that could improve efficiency of use of the "har-
vested" resource. 
• Responses, that should be considered in the 
longer term (Category C). Because these are 
generally more costly, it may be prudent to 
consider them once uncertainties regarding 
climate change impacts are reduced. Examples 
of such measures are: preparing communities 
for a shift in existing resource-based liveli-
hoods, or building new capital structures (e.g., 
dams). 
This classification scheme is used for each of the 
response strategies in the following sections.

This section offers a menu of options applicable to 
several types of resources. Measures dealing gener-
ally with technology transfer and possible financial 
assistance in the context of developing nations are 
addressed in the Response Strategy 
Working 
Group's Task B report. Many of the following op-
tions would help reduce critical lead times and plan-
ning horizons necessary to design and implement 
specific actions in the face of climate change or its 
potential impacts.

The knowledge base relevant to making policy deci-
sions needs to be expanded (A). Clearly, there needs 
to be a concerted effort to undertake the requisite 
research to reduce uncertainties associated with pre-
dictions of the status of resources, their use and 
management at various geographical scales (e. g., for 
terrestrial resources, the regional or watershed 
level) and their socio-economic consequences. 
This means coordinated research programs de-
signed to (a) significantly improve the understand-
ing and predictions of changes in critical climatic 
factors, the direct and non-climatic effects of 
changes in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentra-
tions on the terrestrial and marine biosphere, (b) 
improve and/or develop methodological tools to 
predict the impacts of these climatic and non-
climatic factors on the supply and demand of re-
sources, and the socio-economic consequences of 
climate change and alternative adaptive response 
strategies, and (c) developing costs and benefits for 
both adaptation and limitation measures to help 
arrive at the optimal mix that maximizes social well-
being. 
Resource use and management practices under 
the 
widely divergent, 
existing climatic conditions need 
to be documented, catalogued, and made more ac-
cessible (A). Thus, if the future climatic regime 
could be predicted with sufficient confidence, such 
catalogs would allow one area to more easily locate 
analogues for its future climatic regime. There could 
be a variety of such catalogs. For instance, one 
could contain information on the performance of 
crops, trees, and other species under a variety of 
climatic (and other) conditions. This would help 
farmers and foresters select species for cultivation 
based upon their expectations of both the future 
climate and the resource base. There could be other 
catalogs on management practices for agriculture, 
forestry, livestock husbandry, etc. 
Inventories 
of the current state of resources 
are 
needed by resource managers whether or not climate 
changes (A). Inventories which accurately describe 
the condition and use of resources (e.g., land and 
water uses, distribution, and diversity of species) 
would be of value. Such inventories should also 
describe the future state of resources, as practicable, 
taking into consideration different scenarios of pop-
ulation growth. 
Studies and assessments to gauge the resilience 
of 
resources and their vulnerability 
to climate change 
may 
help 
establish 
priorities 
regarding 
which 
areas—and, 
within 
areas, 
which 
resources— 
authorities should focus upon (A). Such assessments 
would help determine the present adaptive capa-
bility of localities, nations or even systems. More-
over, it would help provide information regarding 
adaptability to various rates of climate change. 
However, given the uncertainties at the regional 
level, such studies should be used with caution. To 
help in such assessments considerable effort should 
be expended on researching, improving, and/or de-
veloping appropriate methodological tools to esti-
mate the impacts of climate change on resource use 
and management, and their socio-economic im-
pacts. Studies of the interrelationships between 
population growth, changes in greenhouse 
gas 
emissions, status and use of natural resources and 
any responses to climate change would be useful. 
Systems to monitor the status of resources need to be 
established to give early warning 
of any 
potential 
changes and trends (A). Such systems should be 
designed to detect changes in resources in different 
locations that may be indications of the effects of 
178 
I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
climatic perturbation. Of course, such systems, 
while indicating changes may be in the offing, 
would generally be unable to indicate whether ob-
served changes are short-term trends due to natural 
variability or irreversible consequences of human-
induced climate change. 
Improve existing institutions 
(or, where 
appropriate, 
establish new institutions) 
to assist in rational 
use 
and management 
of natural resources, and to help 
localities, nations, and regions better cope with 
any 
climate change. Technology development and trans-
fer mechanisms also may need to be supported 
and 
strengthened 
(A, B, C). As far as possible, this 
should be done via existing institutions such as 
F A O , U N E P , W M O , U N R R O , 
U N D P , 
and 
other multi- and bilateral-aid agencies as well as 
institutions within nations. These institutions could 
also assist in the above mentioned efforts to inven-
tory, assess, and monitor natural resource use and 
management. 
Efforts to educate and inform the public and decision 
makers on the scientific, policy, and economic aspects 
of issues surrounding 
climate change need to 
be 
strengthened (B). This should be facilitated by the 
strengthening of the above-mentioned agencies. 
Research and development 
on more efficient 
re-
source use needs to be stimulated 
(A). Such efforts 
could help cope with new stresses from climate 
change. Both public and private enterprises should 
engage in research and development directed to 
more efficient forestry, agricultural, and water use 
practices, and biotechnological innovation. Gov-
ernments could take measures encouraging such 
R & D while ensuring that such work is conducted in 
a manner consistent with public health and safety. 
Nations may consider developing new or modified 
institutional, legal, and financial measures that (a) 
allow innovators to profit from their R & D , and (b) 
encourage individuals and communities to develop 
an economic stake in conservation and in efficient 
and sustainable resource use and management. 
While there already are methods of reducing 
the 
negative impacts on resources, further research 
and 
technology development 
may be necessary to cope 
with the potentially 
worst consequences (A). Thus, 
for instance, development of more drought- or 
salinity-resistant cultivars using classical and mod-
ern breeding techniques (e.g., genetic engineering) 
would help keep farming and forestry options open. 
Such development is already being undertaken and 
is expected to be beneficial even if there were no 
climate change. However, given these efforts, the 
time taken to develop and disseminate such technol-
ogy, and the fact that adaptation along these lines 
(for reasons of human-induced climate change) is 
not imminently necessary, additional emphasis is 
not warranted at this time. 
6.5.2 
MAXIMIZING SUSTAINABLE YIELDS 
It is necessary to increase the efficiency, produc-
tivity and intensity of resource use consistent with 
the principles of sustainable growth and develop-
ment to relieve pressures on resources, which will 
inevitably arise due to population growth, whether 
or not there is human-induced climate change. 
There are several facets to this, as elaborated below. 
There needs to be increased emphasis on the 
re-
search, development, 
and adoption of 
technologies 
for increasing the productivity 
or efficiency (per unit 
of land and water) of crops, forests, livestock, 
and 
fisheries (A, B). Some of the research and techniques 
developed for increasing productivity have been 
viewed by many with suspicion because they in-
volve genetic engineering and food and chemical 
additives. Governments and consumers, in dealing 
with such research and/or products (e.g., in risk 
analysis/management) 
derived from such tech-
niques, should also give due weight to the benefits 
of increased efficiencies in conserving land and wa-
ter resources. 
Such efficiencies reduce the demand for land for 
agriculture, plantation forests, and grazing, which 
is the major cause of conversion of natural ecosys-
tems and loss of biological diversity. In turn, these 
contribute significantly to increased atmospheric 
concentrations of greenhouse gases, though planta-
tion forests may be a useful sink for C 0 2 . More-
over, increased productivity and more efficient use 
for fuelwood and timber would help reduce atmo-
spheric C 0 2 concentrations. 
With respect to livestock, increased meat or milk 
productivity per unit weight of animal also offers a 
possible means of reducing emissions of methane, 
Resource Use and 
Management 
179 
which has a greenhouse warming potential twenty 
to thirty times that of carbon dioxide. 
In addition, some areas may be able to change 
zoning to increase allowable limits on densities of 
population or development without exceeding car-
rying capacities. Such increases in the intensity of 
human settlements would help stem the loss of agri-
cultural land to human settlements and generally 
reduce pressures on land. Moreover, higher popula-
tion densities make more viable many energy and 
resource conservation measures, including mass 
transit, district heating, reductions in heating or 
cooling requirements, and waste recycling. This 
would help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. O n 
the other hand, in areas where carrying capacities 
are strained or extended, appropriate measures to 
expand carrying capacities should be considered— 
e.g., implementing pollution-control measures, im-
proving access to potable water or transportation 
infrastructure. 
Another option to improve the efficiency of re-
source use would be to identify and review subsidies 
for resource use (B-C). Subsidies encourage use of 
marginal resources. For instance, crop subsidies can 
often result in cultivation of more land than is eco-
nomically justifiable. This removes land from its 
natural unmanaged state, which leads to deforesta-
tion and potentially a loss of biological diversity. 
Moreover, it contributes further to greenhouse 
warming. Extension of cultivation through sub-
sidies also reduces water available for other pur-
poses. Grazing subsidies have 
similar 
conse-
quences. In addition, these help enlarge livestock 
populations, which, from the point of view of cli-
mate change, contribute to increased methane emis-
sions. However, it should be noted that societies 
may rationally elect to subsidize various activities 
for reasons of equity and other social benefits that 
may not be easily amenable to monetization. In 
such circumstances, it may be worthwhile to exam-
ine if subsidies could be re-formulated so that they 
still achieve their social goals while diminishing 
their environmental impacts. 
Promoting 
resource conservation 
and 
sustainability 
of resource use (A, B-C). Conservation practices 
could assist resources to withstand climatic stresses 
by helping moderate local climates, water use, and 
soil erosion, increase genetic variability, and reduce 
other stresses from environmental degradation. 
Particular attention may be given to reducing de-
forestation, promoting reforestation and afforesta-
tion, improving water use efficiency, and increasing 
the use of sustainable agricultural practices. 
Strengthening 
conservation and protection of highly 
vulnerable areas (A, B-C). Climate change may or 
may not exacerbate conditions in marginal and en-
dangered ecological and agricultural systems and 
overused water basins. Assessments of the potential 
impacts of climate change (see Category A) might 
help sort this out. 
In areas that could be further stressed, various 
initiatives could be taken for conserving the most 
sensitive and valuable resources, including strength-
ening conservation measures and managing devel-
opment of highly vulnerable resources. Identifi-
cation of the most sensitive and valuable resources 
would necessarily be based upon each society's con-
sideration of relevant social, cultural, environmen-
tal, and economic factors.

INCREASING T H E FLEXIBILITY OF 
RESOURCE USE A N D M A N A G E M E N T 
Flexibility 
for 
resource management 
needs to 
be 
maintained 
and/or 
enhanced 
(A, B-C). 
Greater 
flexibility will increase opportunities to adjust land 
and water uses to a wide range of possible climatic 
conditions. Climate change could affect the suit-
ability of a tract of land for various purposes. Its 
productivity and potential will change in ways that 
cannot currently be predicted. If today it is used for 
production of a specific crop, that crop may not be 
viable in the future; land devoted to conservation of 
a particular species may be unable to support the 
appropriate habitat for that species in the future. 
Thus flexibility is a necessary condition for success-
ful adaptation. There are several implications to 
this. 
First, consideration 
should be given to 
decentraliz-
ing, to the extent practicable, 
decisions on resource 
use and management (B-C) i.e., they may be left to 
individuals and local authorities. They are more 
likely to have a better understanding of the local 
context and therefore less likely to err in their eval-
180 
IPCC RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
uations. Moreover, decentralization assures that 
any errors in judgment—and some are inevitable— 
are not universal. The other side of the decentraliza-
tion coin is that there should nevertheless be coor-
dination between adjacent jurisdictions. Moreover, 
local concerns often override the broader good, 
which leads to a "not in my backyard" mentality. 
To deal with this, methods need to be explored on 
how smaller segments of society may accept taking 
actions benefiting the larger society even at some 
additional risk or burden to themselves. Second, 
quick and 
accurate 
information 
and 
technology 
transfer is critical to maintaining 
such flexibility 
(A). 
Third, there is a need to research methods of increas-
ing the flexibility of land and water use for 
various 
purposes (A).

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR 
WATER RESOURCES 
Water is essential for human civilization, living 
organisms, and natural habitat. It is used for drink-
ing, cleaning, agriculture, transportation, industry, 
recreation, animal husbandry, and producing elec-
tricity for domestic, industrial, and commercial use. 
Even in the absence of human-induced climate 
change, there is a great deal of climatic variability. 
In many areas it is an ongoing challenge to match 
water supply with demand. The problems that do 
occur with respect to water are usually on a regional 
(multi-basin), basin, or smaller scale. Even in "nor-
mal" times, problems may occur in one season but 
not in another. To achieve the goal of matching 
supply and demand, societies have established elab-
orate structures and institutions to store, treat, and 
distribute water; have mined groundwater; and 
have used demand-side management such as ration-
ing or pricing. In spite of such measures, most soci-
eties expect to be forced to cope with various 
incidents of floods, droughts, and degraded water 
quality. 
Human beings have faced other circumstances 
with lessons that could be valuable in adapting to 
any adverse impacts of climate change on water 
resources. These circumstances include increased 
pressure on limited surface and ground water re-
sources due to population growth, migration into 
arid or flood-prone areas, periods of short-term and 
prolonged drought, and degraded water quality. 
Detailed institutional and legal mechanisms and ar-
rangements have been established to make water 
more available and dependable, or of better quality. 
There are hundreds of international compacts, 
treaties, and agreements dealing with water. In ad-
dition, numerous other arrangements dealing with 
water resources exist within nations. Thus, there is a 
fund of knowledge that can be drawn upon to help 
devise response strategies that would mitigate ad-
verse impacts or capitalize upon positive impacts 
that may result from a greenhouse warming. 
As noted in Sections 6.1.3 and 6.1.4, there are 
significant uncertainties regarding the effects of in-
creased 
greenhouse 
gas concentrations on re-
sources. The spatial and temporal distribution of 
precipitation, soil moisture, and run-off, and the 
frequencies and magnitudes of droughts and floods 
will change in a manner that is not currently pre-
dictable with confidence. While the world may re-
ceive more precipitation on a globally averaged 
basis, some areas will get more, and others less, 
precipitation. Precipitation, though, is only one 
factor determining water availability and run-off. 
Other critical factors include temperature, wind 
speed, humidity, the nature and extent of vegeta-
tion, and the duration of accumulated snowpack. 
Each of these factors would also change in the event 
of climate change: higher temperatures would result 
in greater evaporation and transpiration and earlier 
spring melting of snowpack; higher wind speeds 
and changes in humidity would change the frequen-
cies, magnitudes, and patterns of storms; higher 
carbon dioxide concentrations could result in more 
efficient water use by vegetation and crops, thus 
modifying evapotranspiration; annual and seasonal 
variability of precipitation, temperature, and other 
climatic factors would change. 
The ability to predict the spatial and temporal 
distribution of precipitation is quite limited (see 
Section 6.1.4). This predictive ability declines as 
one goes from global to regional or watershed 
scales, and from annual to shorter time periods 
(e.g., seasonal and weekly periods). Moreover, cur-
Resource Use and 
Management 
181 
rent estimates for run-off and water availability in 
the event of climate change so far have omitted 
consideration of many critical factors, such as the 
effects of changes in vegetation on evapotranspira-
tion and run-off, humidity, and wind speed. Thus, 
the present ability to predict the direction, magni-
tude, extent, and timing of changes in water avail-
ability, run-off, and other parameters relevant to 
water resources management for specific areas and 
basins is limited at best. Although there is some 
agreement among current models on the likely di-
rection (but not the magnitude or timing) of change 
in certain geographic regions (e.g., a likely increase 
in temperature in the arid sections of the western 
United States), such agreement does not imply ac-
curacy: it could be a result of similar assumptions 
and simplifications in current models. In addition, 
the demand for water supplies could also be mod-
ified because of changes in rainfall, cropping pat-
terns, and water-use efficiency and in managed and 
natural ecosystems. 
While site-specific effects on water resources can-
not generally be identified at this time, the adaptive 
measures available today to manage water resources 
would in all probability be valid for future condi-
tions. 
The precise options selected by each area need 
not, of course, be the same as those it employs 
today. Nevertheless, many responses would be ap-
propriate today as well as in the event of climate 
change. 
Water-resource management in the face of cli-
mate change will face somewhat different challenges 
compared with past water planning. In the past, 
when climate was assumed to be constant, one 
could estimate new demands for water by more 
easily measurable or observable factors—the rate of 
population growth, the rate of decline of ground-
water supplies, or the degree of aridity in areas 
being newly settled. However, for many years 
hence, the ability to model future atmospheric 
changes and their interaction with the hydrologic 
cycle is unlikely to provide as great a degree of 
certainty about the degree, or (in many cases) even 
the direction, of climate change on a regional level. 
This increases the degree of uncertainty concerning 
which responses are prudent. Clearly, the more ex-
pensive the response strategy, or the greater its ad-
verse social, economic, or environmental conse-
quences, the greater the caution regarding its adop-
tion. 
6.6.2 
RESPONSE STRATEGIES 
Timing of strategies. Although climate change may 
occur over many decades, it is uncertain whether 
these changes—should they come—would be grad-
ual or sudden. Many water supply systems are de-
signed to operate under extreme conditions (greatly 
increased or decreased run-off), but water resources 
managers will have to consider that the frequency 
and magnitude of extreme events may be altered. 
Given the uncertainties regarding the extent, mag-
nitude, and timing of climate change and its effects 
on water resources, it may be prudent to delay 
consideration of more costly adaptation measures 
(Category C) until after these uncertainties are re-
duced. By the same token, many of the less costly 
response strategies (Categories A and B), especially 
those with other benefits, may be appropriate to-
day, as well as in the event of climate change. Some 
response strategies and programs can be imple-
mented effectively during the short term; e.g., flood 
warning, evacuation, disaster relief loans or sub-
sidies, and emergency operations. Other strategies 
may require a longer lead time to respond to climate 
change; e.g. conducting studies of modifying reser-
voir operations to meet shifting demands under cli-
matic uncertainty, and incorporating considera-
tions of climatic uncertainty into the design of new 
water resource structures. Fortunately, many re-
sponses to climate change are already embedded in 
current planning, design, and management prac-
tices, and their general application in industrial and 
developing countries should be promoted. 
Determining 
the flexibility 
and vulnerability 
of cur-
rent water supply systems (A,B). Given the uncer-
tainty over the nature of hydrologic changes to be 
expected in any particular region and the cost of 
making any significant changes in existing water 
supply structures, a logical first step would be to 
evaluate the flexibility of current water supply sys-
tems to the type of changes that might be expected 
under climate change. Models could be used to esti-
mate the sensitivity of water systems to increased 
aridity and increased run-off (such as might occur 
182 
I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
from a shortening of the run-off season). Such 
models could utilize altered run-off data from a 
number of possible sources: arbitrary increases or 
decreases, the use of proxy data on seasonal tem-
perature and precipitation obtained through paleo-
climatological methods, or global climate models 
used in conjunction with hydrologic models. 
The greater the vulnerability and/or inflexibility 
in a particular water system, and the greater the 
impact on human population and on ecosystems, 
the more important it is to monitor relevant param-
eters with a view toward determining trends, to 
strive to reduce uncertainties regarding the effects of 
climate changes on water resources, and to consider 
measures to enhance the flexibility of the water sup-
ply system. Such system models would also neces-
sitate assimilating data on current facilities, stream-
flow, and other statistics—data that would be 
required for many of the additional response strate-
gies. 
System optimization (A,B). Water supply facilities 
are often built by one particular jurisdiction or 
agency to service its needs, and the reservoir operat-
ing rules are developed to serve the needs of that 
jurisdiction or agency only. Hence, system opera-
tion may not be optimized across existing jurisdic-
tions or agencies. Significant increases in system 
yield can often be obtained by joint use and revised 
operating rules if different jurisdictions or agencies 
are willing to execute agreements to do so. These 
agreements involve exchange of storage and flood 
control capacity between reservoirs at different 
times of year, as well as specifying rules for joint 
operation of facilities. The increases obtainable 
from such measures can be enhanced by more up-
to-date data on meteorological and soil moisture 
conditions, as well as the application of more so-
phisticated computer models. In the long-term, 
once the flexibility and vulnerability of a water sup-
ply system to respond to a variety of hydrologic 
changes is better understood, the next step would be 
an attempt to optimize the water yield, hydropower 
production, flood control, recreational use, mainte-
nance of fish and wildlife habitat, and other outputs 
available from existing facilities under various cli-
mate change scenarios, as well as under current cli-
mate. Optimization of international water-resource 
systems may require intensified international coop-
eration among countries sharing river basins. 
Enhancement 
of scientific measurement, 
monitor-
ing, knowledge, and forecasting (A). Given the nat-
ural variability in meteorological and hydrologic 
conditions, one of the initial challenges of planners 
may be to determine whether long-term changes 
are, in fact, occurring or are expected to occur in a 
particular region. Such assessments are based on 
comprehensive and accurate monitoring of hydro-
logical and meteorological factors. However, the 
relevant observational networks are far from satis-
factory in most of the developing world. As climate 
change is a global phenomenon, there is a need for a 
global approach in monitoring. There should be 
continued study of the interaction of the hydrologic 
system with the rest of the climatic system with the 
eventual goal of enabling area or basin-specific pre-
dictions, or detection of trends, with respect to 
changes in water availability and other parameters 
useful for water resources management. This could 
eventually enable planners, designers, and managers 
to incorporate predicted climate trends in their use 
of stream flow and other time-dependent data se-
ries. 
Water conservation (A,B). Water conservation mea-
sures have been widely discussed over recent years 
for a variety of reasons, including the increased 
demands for water and the high financial, social, 
and environmental costs of construction of addi-
tional storage facilities. Under conditions of in-
creased aridity, conservation measures may become 
even more important. Large savings in water are 
possible in agriculture. Irrigation is the largest con-
sumer of freshwater in many areas and relatively 
small percentage reductions in irrigation water use 
can make large amounts of water available for new 
uses. 
Agricultural water conservation measures include 
irrigation management scheduling (monitoring of 
soil moisture and atmospheric conditions to more 
precisely schedule the amount and timing of water 
deliveries), lining of canals to prevent seepage, tail-
water recovery (recycling water that reaches the end 
of field rows), drip irrigation, using more drought-
resistant crops and/or cultivars, and tillage practices 
that retain soil moisture. Conservation of municipal 
and industrial water supplies can be achieved 
through education, better measurement and meter-
ing, technological improvements, specifying the use 
of more efficient water-using appliances in building 
Resource Use and 
Management 
183 
codes, and, in arid climates, use of low-water-use 
landscaping, rather than grass lawns. Under ex-
treme drought conditions over one or two dry 
years, voluntary rationing of domestic use and man-
datory restrictions (allowing water use during just 
certain hours, restricting lawn watering, etc.) have 
also proven effective. In addition to these measures, 
pricing has more potential as an incentive for water 
conservation. 
Demand management 
through pricing 
(B). Water 
prices provide signals and incentives to conserve 
water, develop new supplies, and allocate limited 
water supplies among competing uses. Since water 
use is sensitive to price, water users facing higher 
prices will generally conserve water and modify 
technologies and crop selection. Therefore, pricing 
by water supply authorities to reflect real or re-
placement costs promotes efficient use. However, 
the cost of water supply facilities constructed by 
government entities is often recovered partially 
through property taxes or means other than 
through commodity charges levied on final con-
sumers. In other cases, the facilities are subsidized, 
with the cost being financed through general gov-
ernment revenues or income taxes. The result is that 
water is often priced inefficiently, below its cost of 
delivery or its long-run marginal cost. This leads to 
overuse of water and the other resources needed to 
construct water supply facilities. There is substan-
tial additional opportunity for cities and irrigation 
districts to utilize pricing as a means of conserving 
water by employing marginal-cost pricing (charging 
for the cost of the last-added and most expensive 
increment of supply) or progressive-rate pricing 
(charging more per unit to users of large amounts). 
A first step would be to perform studies of the effect 
of higher prices and different water-rate structures 
on water use in the particular area under considera-
tion. 
It would also be possible to extend these concepts 
to employ pricing as a means of allocating water use 
during drought episodes. To some extent this is 
already done: some areas have a two-tier rate struc-
ture, where lower rates are charged for interruptible 
supplies of water. As discussed below, allowing 
water entitlements to be traded at market value may 
achieve results similar to raising prices. Institutional 
arrangements for pricing and for trading water 
would need to take into account potential adverse 
(or beneficial) impacts on public uses of water, such 
as recreation and preservation of wildlife, whose 
value is often not incorporated into current pricing 
practices. 
Voluntary 
water transfers or markets (B). One re-
sponse to more arid conditions is to establish insti-
tutional arrangements 
to assure that water is 
directed to where it is most needed and where it will 
be the most productive. One means for doing this is 
to establish a system of property rights in water that 
can be traded as economic or hydrologic conditions 
vary. 
For example, a growing city or a new industrial 
user desiring a senior water right can enter the mar-
ket place to purchase a senior right from an existing 
irrigation water user. 
The amount of water a rights holder could trans-
fer is normally limited to the consumptive-use por-
tion of his entitlement rather than his full diversion 
entitlement from the stream, in order to assure that 
other water users are not injured in the transfer 
process. Government also has a role in protecting 
instream, public uses of water for water quality, fish 
and wildlife, and recreational and other uses. Water 
transfers can be annual rentals, short-term leases, 
permanent sales of water rights, payments for con-
servation investments in exchange for the conserved 
water, or dry-year option agreements under which 
the water is transferred only under specified 
drought conditions. The viability of such ap-
proaches would vary, depending upon the extent to 
which property rights and markets have been relied 
upon in the past. 
Modification 
of cropping systems (C). Any long-
term changes in temperature, evaporation, the 
length of the growing season, the amount and tem-
poral distribution of precipitation, or other climate-
related parameters may lead to the modification of 
cropping practices. Modifications in response to cli-
mate change can include: shifts to more (or less) 
drought- or heat-tolerant species or varieties, 
changes in planting and harvesting dates, selection 
of varieties with shorter or longer growing seasons, 
and adjustments in the number of crops grown per 
season (e.g., conversion from double cropping to 
single cropping or vice versa). Therefore, changes in 
climatic factors may also result in (1) migration of 
current crops to new areas to take advantage of 
184 
I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
changed conditions or (2) changes in the demand for 
irrigation. These changes could, in turn, affect wa-
ter demand and supply in the new as well as old 
areas, as well as having impacts on the volume of 
contaminants in agricultural run-off. 
Modifications 
of tillage systems (B, C). Although 
historically the primary functions of soil tillage have 
been to prepare a seedbed and control weeds, cer-
tain tillage systems are effective measures for con-
serving soil and/or water. Practices that leave crop 
residue on the soil surface tend to increase surface 
roughness and organic matter, thereby increasing 
infiltration and reducing the potential for soil ero-
sion. Surface residues also help to reduce soil loss 
due to wind erosion. Any tillage system that avoids 
exposing subsurface soil moisture to evaporative 
loss or that creates a surface soil barrier to evapora-
tion can contribute significantly to agricultural wa-
ter conservation, especially in rain-fed areas. Thus, 
tillage systems can be used to make more efficient 
use of precipitation in more arid areas, to reduce 
erosion resulting from excess precipitation and to 
reduce the off-farm impacts of soil erosion and farm 
chemicals transported by run-off. These modified 
tillage practices can be combined with other land 
management practices designed to reduce water use 
and soil erosion, such as terracing, laser-leveling of 
fields, and water harvesting systems that recover 
water run-off. 
Natural resources management (B, C). Natural re-
sources management programs are implemented in 
many regions of the world to address deforestation 
and desertification and to promote the sustained 
yield and conservation of natural resources. By in-
cluding considerations of the potential impacts and 
risks of climate change, such programs may mitigate 
the impacts of climate change on water resources. 
Examples of such programs include integrated 
river basin or watershed management programs; in-
tegration with forestry practices and reforestation 
in upland areas; soil conservation, forage selection, 
livestock grazing practices, land management, and 
other agricultural practices in the plains; and coastal 
estuarine, marsh, and mangrove management. 
Flood management. 
Flood management strategies 
are now based on the computed magnitude and 
frequency of flood events based largely on historic 
data. The potential effects of climate change are 
changes in the magnitudes and frequencies of storm 
events and in the magnitude, rate, and timing of the 
melting of snowpack. Therefore, some areas can 
expect increased run-off over shorter time periods. 
In addition to systems operation studies designed to 
accommodate a wider range of future climatic con-
ditions, potential response strategies include the 
following: 
• Improvement 
of flood forecasting 
(A). Collec-
tion of hydrometeorological data by GEOS sat-
ellites and other advanced systems provides 
real-time information on rainfall, streamflow/ 
stage, and reservoir levels. Broader collection 
and use of similar real-time data in concert with 
improved quantitative precipitation forecasting 
techniques could enable water managers to re-
spond more rapidly and effectively to potential 
flooding. 
• Evacuation 
plans (B). Comprehensive flood 
preparedness plans may include provisions for 
temporary evacuation of flood plain occupants 
during flood events. Improved flood warning 
and forecasting abilities could enable additional 
actions, such as removing or raising building 
contents to reduce flood losses. 
• Flood warning 
(B). Implementation of flood 
warning systems can often be relatively inex-
pensive, quick to design and build, and easy to 
modify to changing conditions. Generally such 
systems can be operated by local people in a 
decentralized, independent mode. 
• Floodplain 
zoning (B). Zoning flood plain areas 
to prevent construction of structures and activ-
ities likely to suffer from floods is another 
means of avoiding losses. 
• Flood insurance (B). Flood insurance can serve a 
double function. The flood insurance pre-
miums can be price signals to the insured to 
discourage locating in flood-prone areas. Sec-
ond, once flooding has occurred, insurance can 
be an effective means of reducing the economic 
impact of losses. Climatic change could necessi-
tate more frequent review and revision of flood 
insurance programs. 
Disaster relief and emergency preparedness (B, C). 
Because of the uncertainty concerning the impacts 
of climate change, improving disaster relief pro-
Resource Use and 
Management 
185 
grams may be an effective response. Flood insur-
ance or financial assistance in the form of emergency 
loans and subsidies could reduce the impact of eco-
nomic losses and social disruption. Grants or loans 
could be used to fund such measures as construction 
of emergency levees (e.g., sand bagging) and emer-
gency debris removal to impede imminent flooding, 
as well as for post-flood rehabilitation efforts. 
Advance planning of these programs would re-
duce conflicts over their implementation and make 
potentially affected parties aware of their avail-
ability. 
Design modifications (B, C). In situations where it is 
cost-effective, designing more capacity into spill-
ways at the time of project construction and other 
design modifications, such as increased capacity for 
levees and dikes, can assist in handling larger flows 
of water. 
Adjustments 
in river transportation 
(C). Increased 
precipitation could help inland navigation systems 
by providing a more constant depth of water in the 
free-flowing reaches of inland systems. If climate 
changes result in less run-off, there is the possibility 
that interruptions could occur in the free-flowing 
reaches. If greenhouse warming results in a more 
extreme hydrological regime, river navigation will 
tend to be adversely affected by more frequent 
floods and droughts. Response strategies include 
dredging of shoals or sand bars in the major river 
systems to maintain adequate depths; lessening the 
likelihood of groundings by lightening barge loads; 
placing greater reliance on other forms of transpor-
tation during drought episodes; and augmenting 
low river flows. 
Education, 
technology transfer, and financial assis-
tance and 
special considerations 
for 
developing 
countries (A). In many developed countries a com-
prehensive system of physical structures is already 
in place to deal with excess or inadequacy of water 
supply and to manage distribution. Similarly, such 
countries have well-established institutions with a 
long record of dealing with water resource prob-
lems and making adjustments. Furthermore the 
costs of making the necessary adjustments can be 
accommodated largely within the financial and hu-
man resources of the countries concerned. 
In other, less well developed countries, the con-
verse may be true. In many cases, developing coun-
tries are not able to cope with adverse water re-
source conditions under existing climate. Thus, in 
such countries, additional efforts may first be 
needed to raise standards of water resource manage-
ment. Education, training, and technical assistance 
efforts directed at water managers and water users 
could play a role in making water use more efficient 
and in responding to climate change. These pro-
grams could include national, regional, and interna-
tional efforts such as joint scientific research; 
exchange of research results on new crops, prod-
ucts, and technology; and assistance to developing 
nations for training and technical assistance. The 
United Nations, the World Bank, and other inter-
national and bilateral agencies provide a framework 
through which technical and financial assistance is 
provided to developing countries and regions. 
Where it does not already exist, nations could 
develop an infrastructure (e.g., extension services 
similar to that existing in the United States) to assist 
in rapid dissemination of new and appropriate tech-
nology, management techniques, and practices to 
help assure sustainable use of forest and agricultural 
resources. The same infrastructure could also be 
used to educate farmers and the local public about 
the role of vegetation in controlling erosion and in 
modifying the hydrological cycle. 
In order to enhance the robustness and resilience 
of water systems, it would be important to identify 
appropriate technologies, depending in part on the 
economic base and level of economic development 
in a region; cultural and institutional factors (for 
example, market-based strategies may be more dif-
ficult to implement in some settings); international 
and bilateral trade and debt policies; and guidelines 
for development projects. 
Countries where water resource systems have not 
been developed may first want to concentrate on the 
provision of adequate storage and delivery systems, 
conservation practices, and appropriate water al-
location institutions under conditions of current cli-
mate. 
Modification 
of storage and other 
augmentation 
measures (C). Although nonstructural measures are 
generally less expensive and should be exhausted 
first, additional storage may become a method for 
responding to climate change to accommodate 
changes in the magnitude and timing of precipita-
186 
I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
tion and/or snow melt, either through raising exist-
ing dams, construction of new facilities, inter-basin 
transfers of water from areas of surplus to deficit 
water areas, or recharge of underground aquifers 
from available surface supplies. Planning for such 
measures would need to take into account potential 
adverse and beneficial environmental and economic 
impacts. Transportation of emergency water sup-
plies could be provided when drought conditions 
threaten public health and well-being. 
In those coastal areas where water has reached a 
very high value, desalinization technologies could 
be used to augment supplies. 
For a number of years, research has proceeded on 
cloud seeding to determine whether this technique 
has value for augmenting water supplies in certain 
areas. One of the main problems has been that it is 
difficult to separate out the amount of additional 
water that is the result of cloud seeding, and there-
fore it is difficult to find financial sponsors of cloud-
seeding experiments. 
Dam safety and other design criteria 
(B, C). Re-
sponse strategies to safeguard the integrity of exist-
ing deficient impoundment structures generally 
include some combination of enlargement of spill-
ways, raising of dams, and modification of water-
control plans. Increased run-off due to climate 
change could potentially pose a severe threat to the 
safety of existing dams with design deficiencies. De-
sign criteria for dams may require re-evaluation to 
incorporate the effects of climate change. 
Adjustments 
in protecting 
water quality 
in rivers 
and reservoirs (B, C). Climate change could modify 
the amount of fresh water available. If freshwater 
quantities are reduced, this could affect the ability 
to dilute contaminants and salts, to dissipate heat, to 
leach salts from agricultural soils, and to regulate 
water temperatures in order to forestall changes in 
the thermal stratification, aquatic biota, and ecosys-
tems of lakes, rivers, and streams. The potential 
effects of climate change on water quality also relate 
to the magnitude and frequency of storm events as 
well as seasonal changes in temperature. For exam-
ple, the onset, duration, and characteristics of reser-
voir and lake stratification would respond to 
seasonal temperature changes, particularly in tem-
perate regions. Dissolved oxygen concentrations 
could also be affected, and eutrophication problems 
could worsen. Climate change could also affect the 
recharge rates of aquifers, which could affect the 
quality of underground water supplies. However, if 
climate change involved increased flows in a region, 
greater dilution of pollutants and other water-
quality benefits may result. These various changes 
in water quality may affect the usable supplies of 
fresh water. 
The efficient operation of systems to manage wa-
ter quality may become more critical. Transferable 
discharge permits are one means to allow ambient 
water-quality standards to be met at the least cost 
by trading pollution reduction capabilities among 
dischargers. 
Various in-place technologies, such as aeration 
and destratification and localized mixing systems, 
can mitigate adverse changes in water quality. Mod-
ifying the operation of reservoirs with multi-level 
withdrawals, or adding this capability to existing 
reservoirs, would increase the ability to manage 
changes in water-quality conditions. Water-quality 
problems are also affected by the level of discharges 
into a stream, including non-point source run-
off from the watershed. Therefore, watershed-
management 
programs 
to 
control non-point 
sources as well as point sources can help maintain 
water quality. 
Adjustments 
in protecting 
estuarine water 
quality 
(C). Estuarine water quality will be subject to simi-
lar hydrometeorological changes that affect fresh 
water, as well as changes that may occur in the 
oceans, such as sea level rise or tidal variations. One 
of the effects could be saltwater intrusion into sur-
face and ground water, having unpredictable and 
possibly adverse impacts on fishery resources and 
wildlife and on water supplies. 
In addition to the response strategies listed for 
maintaining river and reservoir water quality, the 
following could prove useful: relocating water sup-
ply intakes out of areas that may be susceptible to 
higher saltwater intrusion; and providing saltwater 
barriers to further saltwater intrusion in estuaries 
and tidal rivers (such barriers would have to be 
evaluated against possible adverse effects on migra-
tory fish and shellfish resources passing seasonally 
through the system). 
Utilization 
of hydropower (B, C). There is consid-
erable potential for developing hydropower in Asia,

Africa, and Latin America, as well as in other parts 
of the world. Development of these resources could 
help reduce combustion of fossil and wood fuel, 
thereby reducing carbon dioxide emissions directly. 
Moreover, conserving forests would reduce erosion 
and the frequency and magnitude of flooding, espe-
cially in mountainous terrain. In planning for hy-
dropower projects, consideration would also have 
to be given to potential beneficial and adverse envi-
ronmental and economic impacts (such as inunda-
tion of agricultural lands, forested lands, and 
wetlands; downstream impacts on navigation, flood 
control, and water supplies; and effects on aquatic 
resources and recreation).

INTRODUCTION 
This section deals with adaptive responses to the 
impacts of climate change on land use and managed 
and unmanaged ecosystems, including forests and 
biologically diverse areas. 
Biological diversity refers to the variety and vari-
ability among living organisms and the ecological 
complexes in which they occur. Biological diversity 
is organized at many levels, ranging from complete 
ecosystems (i.e., systems of plants, animals, and 
microorganisms together with the non-living com-
ponents of their environment) to the chemical struc-
tures that are the molecular basis of heredity. Thus, 
the term encompasses different ecosystems, species, 
and genes, and their relative abundance. 
More important, while biodiversity is related, it 
is not identical to the number or abundance of par-
ticular species. There are economic and non-
economic reasons for maintaining biological diver-
sity, forests, and other ecosystems. In many areas, 
food production and livelihood (e.g., tourism, for-
est products) depend directly upon these functions. 
Nature contains blueprints for substances that 
could be of great benefit to agriculture, medicine, 
and forests under a variety of climatic conditions. If 
climate were to change, such blueprints could be the 
source of new cultivars better adapted to future 
conditions. There are also aesthetic and cultural rea-
sons for protecting biological diversity. Moreover, 
disruption of forests and land cover can affect avail-
ability of quality water, run-off, and soil erosion. 
Climate change could alter the physical suit-
ability and economic viability of land for different 
uses in many areas. The climate has played a signifi-
cant role in present land-use patterns and on the 
occurrence and distribution of present-day agri-
cultural and forest lands, human settlements, and 
biota. Hence, it seems likely that these distributions 
could be altered if significant changes in the climate 
occur. In this process, forests and other ecosystems 
could be altered with change in inter- and intra-
species diversity with some species extinctions be-
coming possible (appropriate actions could reduce 
these impacts), while some species could benefit. 
Adjustments, including changes in land use and 
improved biodiversity conservation efforts, can be 
made in response to changing climatic conditions 
and population growth rates. In open market econ-
omies, many of these adjustments will be made by 
private resource managers who are guided by mar-
ket incentives (changes in prices and costs). Yet, 
many decisions on land use and biodiversity conser-
vation have environmental and social consequences 
that are not considered in private benefit-cost calcu-
lations. 
Section 6.7 outlines the changing pressures on 
land use that could result from global climate 
change and suggests planning and management op-
tions for adapting to climate change. It also makes 
suggestions for helping rapidly growing popula-
tions meet the demand for land for various human 
activities, while assuring conservation of the envi-
ronment and maintenance of biological diversity. 
6.7.2 
C U R R E N T PRESSURES O N L A N D A N D 
ECOSYSTEMS 
The effects of increasing greenhouse gas concentra-
tions and associated climate change on land use and 
biodiversity must be considered against a backdrop 
of rapidly increasing population growth. Such 
growth alone will result in increasing demand for 
food, fiber, and forest products and for living and 
recreational space. These demands increase pres-
sures to (a) remove more land from its unmanaged 
state, thus increasing stresses on less intensively 
managed habitats, biodiversity and ecosystems and 
188 
I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
increasing atmospheric concentrations of carbon di-
oxide as forests are converted to other land uses, (b) 
adopt more intensive land uses that could increase 
soil erosion and further degrade water and other 
environmental quality, and (c) convert agricultural 
and other lands to urban and suburban uses. 
6.7.3 
POSSIBLE ADDITIONAL PRESSURES 
RESULTING FROM CLIMATE 
C H A N G E 
Increasing greenhouse gas concentrations and asso-
ciated global climate change could affect patterns 
and intensity of land use in significant ways. Cli-
mate change could shift regions of suitable climate 
for a particular species toward the poles and higher 
elevations. Over a period of decades or centuries, 
the species present in plant and animal communities 
could dissociate as a result of differences in thermal 
tolerances, habitat requirements, and dispersal and 
colonization abilities, and assemble to form new 
communities under the new climatic conditions. At 
this time, however, neither the precise direction, 
rate, distance nor success of migration of species can 
be predicted. 
While such changes provide information on pos-
sible shifts in ecological systems, they cannot easily 
be translated into specific shifts in uses of land for 
agriculture, forestry, or other purposes. Current 
land-use patterns could change: some areas that to-
day are used for agriculture may change in the in-
tensity of use because of changes in climate or 
availability of water; for the same reasons, other 
areas that today are not used for intensive agricul-
ture may be able to support it in the future. Switches 
in crops or cultivars will likely occur to optimize 
expected farm income. The demand for lands for 
human settlement may be affected: some coastal 
areas may become uninhabitable in the event of sea 
level rise; areas in the higher latitudes may become 
more hospitable for human habitation. In some 
areas, current land uses may be continued only if 
relatively expensive measures are taken to mitigate 
the effects of climate change; in other areas, adapt-
ing the land to new uses may result in a net social 
benefit (over current uses). 
Changes in the habitat could lead to a species 
invading the range of another species. In at least 
some cases this may lead to a reduction of popula-
tion size or even extinction of the competitively 
weaker species. (Appropriate actions could reduce 
these impacts.) Declines in populations and species 
extinctions could occur due to loss of habitat, lack 
of new land suitable for colonization, and inability 
to keep pace with changes in the climate. O n the 
other hand, other species may benefit because cer-
tain habitats may become more abundant and pro-
ductive. Ecosystems restricted by human activities 
to small isolated areas could face the greatest risks 
from climate change due to the exacerbation of cur-
rent stresses on such systems and the fact that 
colonization by new individuals may be hampered 
by the fragmented nature of the landscape. Any 
inter- and intra-specific declines in biodiversity 
could result in irreversible loss of genes and gene 
complexes. 
Some migratory organisms may also face in-
creased threats. Migratory species are dependent on 
the quantity and quality of habitat in more than one 
area and they may be adversely affected if suitable 
habitat in only one of these areas is reduced. These 
effects could be mitigated because migratory species 
have the mobility to locate suitable new habitat. 
Moreover, suitable habitat may expand or become 
more productive. In these instances, migratory spe-
cies may benefit. 
6.7.4 
ADAPTATION MEASURES 
To meet the various demands on land and to con-
serve natural resources under future climatic reg-
imes, resource users and managers would need to 
consider management and development efforts to 
maintain or enhance economically efficient, sustain-
able land use and biodiversity. However, responses 
to climate change should optimize socioeconomic 
well-being and growth subject to environmental 
constraints. 
Moreover, both adaptation and emission limiting 
strategies should be considered as a package (see 
Section 6.3). Since the rate of climate change has 
such a strong influence on the ability of various 
ecosystems to adapt, efforts to slow the rate of 
global warming, particularly reducing deforestation 
and promoting forestation, can go a long way to-
Resource Use and 
Management 
189 
ward limiting adverse impacts. In addition, several 
adaptive responses should be considered to improve 
resilience to changes in the climate. 
With respect to adaptation, emphasis should be 
on identifying and considering removal of barriers 
to rapid and efficient adaptation, identifying deci-
sions with long-term consequences, maintaining 
flexibility and improving resource use and manage-
ment where possible, limiting costs and administra-
tive burden, and promoting public input and 
acceptance. Effective adaptation to climate change 
is largely dependent on the integration of informa-
tion on the impacts of climate change with land use 
planning and biodiversity conservation efforts. It 
may also require more dynamic nature conservation 
(i.e., greater human intervention) rather than strict 
preservation. Adaptive measures that meet the 
above objectives are described below under the cat-
egories of research and short- and long-term ac-
tions. 
6.7.4.1 Research, Planning, and Information 
Dissemination (A) 
This subsection identifies measures that should be 
considered to increase the knowledge base so that 
societies can respond rationally and efficiently to 
possible changes in the climate. These options are 
classified Category A according to the classification 
scheme adopted in Section 6.4. Studies of climate 
change impacts on land use and biodiversity are 
needed to identify the resources that are the most 
vulnerable to climate change and to characterize the 
dynamics of the responses of managed and un-
managed ecosystems. This information, together 
with assessments of the effectiveness of particular 
response strategies, will allow for timely and effi-
cient planning for and modification of land use and 
conservation of biodiversity. 
i) Inventory (A). Resource managers could use 
information on the current state of resources 
to analyze what is vulnerable to climate 
change and what might be done about it. In-
ventories that describe the current uses of 
land, such as now exist in some countries, and 
the current distribution and diversity of spe-
cies, would be of value. Developing such in-
ventories where they do not exist would be a 
useful step regardless of whether climate were 
to change. 
ii) Assessment 
(A). Based on the above-
mentioned inventories, resource managers 
could examine vulnerabilities of natural re-
sources to climate change, assess how various 
ecosystems and land-use patterns could be 
affected by increased greenhouse gas concen-
trations, and identify potential 
land-use 
conflicts resulting from climate change. Sig-
nificant effort needs to be devoted to the 
development of biogeographic models to in-
vestigate the response of various species, 
including migratory species, to higher green-
house gas concentrations and associated cli-
mate change. Research is also needed to 
improve the understanding of behavior of 
collections of isolated populations of species 
in a fragmented landscape and rates and con-
straints to colonization and dispersal. To 
achieve this, research is also needed on: (a) 
the size and location of protected natural 
areas to satisfy various uses and what prac-
tices may be necessary, given the existing or 
expected size limitations; (b) utility, extent, 
and placement of conservation corridors; (c) 
rates of population migration, and (d) behav-
ior of species. Monitoring systems also need 
to be established to detect any changes in 
disease and pest outbreaks. 
iii) Development 
and dissemination of new tech-
nologies (A). R & D efforts that result in more 
efficient and sustainable land use could help 
in coping with new stresses from climate 
change by reducing land use demand. Both 
public and private enterprises should con-
tinue research and development directed to 
more efficient and resilient forestry and agri-
cultural 
practices 
(e.g., 
development of 
drought- and heat-tolerant species and crop 
rotation techniques) and biotechnological in-
novation. Governments should take mea-
sures encouraging such R & D while ensuring 
that such work is conducted in a manner con-
sistent with public health and safety. Nations 
may consider developing innovative institu-
tional, legal, and financial measures that 
I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
would take advantage of innovation, includ-
ing measures that would allow innovators to 
profit from their R & D . Nations might also 
consider institutional, legal, and financial 
measures that would encourage individuals 
and communities to develop an economic 
stake in efficient and environmentally sound 
land use and development. 
Research 
is also needed 
to improve 
methods for internalizing the true social costs 
in land-use decisions to ensure that these de-
cisions reflect such externalities as ecological 
damages and infrastructure improvement. 
Several approaches for limiting adverse im-
pacts on biodiversity need research. 
If 
deemed effective, development should be en-
couraged. These approaches may include (a) 
techniques for establishing and maintaining 
conservation corridors between protected 
areas; (b) ex situ conservation techniques 
(e.g., preservation of species in zoos, botani-
cal gardens, and germ plasm banks); and (c) 
community restoration and development 
techniques to introduce species unable to col-
onize new regions naturally. 
Research and development need to be un-
dertaken to promote fuller and more efficient 
use of forest products especially as sources of 
biological energy, materials, and chemicals. 
This includes research and development to 
assure more complete utilization of felled 
trees; assure longer life of timber and wood 
products by improving resistance to fire and 
pests and diseases; increase efficiency of in-
dustrial plantations through genetic selec-
tion, breeding, and propagation; increase 
efficiency of fuel plantations by screening of 
tree species for charcoal making; develop new 
uses for felled trees that could displace fossil 
fuels (e.g., in electrical generation); promote 
fuller use of forest products other than timber 
(e.g., resins, oil, fruits, fiber, materials) by 
researching and enhancing traditional prac-
tices, and focusing on "multipurpose" trees 
(i.e., trees that can provide a variety of 
benefits—e.g., fruits for human consump-
tion, fodder for livestock, and fuelwood from 
branches). 
Increasing the rate of dissemination of re-
search results and technologies to users (e.g., 
land-use planners, farmers, foresters, wild-
life biologists, and public policymakers) to 
enable them to quickly adopt new prac-
tices, plans, and technologies. The United 
Nations and its member organizations (FAO, 
U N E S C O , W M O , U N E P ) , the World Bank, 
other multi- and bilateral agencies, and sev-
eral national institutions provide a frame-
work through which technical and other 
assistance could be provided to developing 
countries and regions. Information to plan-
ners, farmers, foresters, and other land users 
is needed. Extension services, such as that 
supported by the U.S. Department of Agri-
culture (USDA), could be used to dissemi-
nate 
information and educate 
planners, 
farmers, foresters, and other land users. 
iv) Research that enhances the stake of local pop-
ulation 
in preserving 
biodiversity 
(A). Re-
search needs to be undertaken on how to give 
parties a stake (including an economic stake) 
in preserving biodiversity—e.g., developing 
economic incentives to preserve existing (nat-
ural) germ plasm and maintain genetic diver-
sity 
in breeding populations. 
Increased 
research is necessary on the economics of bio-
diversity. 
6.7.4.2 
Short- and Long-Term 
Responses 
(B or C) 
This subsection describes options that some soci-
eties may be able to undertake: 
• in the short term, to improve resilience to cli-
mate change if they result in little or no addi-
tional costs (or consequences). (Category B 
responses under the classification scheme of 
Section 6.4.) The options include maintaining 
flexibility in land use, managing development 
of highly vulnerable areas, and increasing and 
maintaining the sustainability and efficiency of 
land-use management; 
• in the long term, as uncertainties regarding cli-
mate change are reduced. (Category C, as dis-
cussed in Section 6.4.) Possible long-term 
Resource Use and 
Management 
191 
initiatives include creation of conservation cor-
ridors, strengthening protected areas, and mod-
ifying economic incentives affecting land use. 
i) Maintaining 
flexibility 
in land use (B). The un-
certain, but potentially significant, shifts in 
land-use suitability associated with climate 
change argue for enhancing and maintaining 
flexibility in land-use decisions. Nations could 
explore methods of making future land use 
more flexible and adaptable to climate change. 
Such flexibility might allow for switches in 
land-use practices to activities that are expected 
to provide the highest social values under future 
climatic regimes. For instance, programs de-
signed to acquire and manage recreation or con-
servation areas should have the capability to 
adjust to shifts in the needs for—and suitable 
locations of—these areas. 
Greater use of property easements is one way 
for maintaining flexibility in land use. More 
flexible methods of acquiring, developing, and 
managing areas to be set aside for fuelwood, 
forage production, and expanding human do-
micile needs (including recreation and other 
amenities) within or in close proximity to exist-
ing human settlements should be explored. 
However, in many countries ownership of land 
is perceived as a fundamental right and one not 
lightly abrogated. Thus, any methods of in-
creasing the flexibility of land use must be con-
sistent with the principle of fair and equitable 
compensation to land owners. Moreover, if 
there are uncertainties regarding "property" 
rights or length of tenure, they will lead to 
abuse from resource managers (see (hi), below). 
In some cases it may be useful to vest or 
empower local organizations with clear respon-
sibility and authority for coordinating land-use 
planning that reflects the likely impacts of cli-
mate change and rapidly growing human popu-
lations. 
Land-use 
planning efforts 
should 
incorporate climate change concerns and oper-
ate with full participation of concerned organi-
zations and interests. 
Nations should consider methods such as ex-
changing land-use rights, "impact" payments 
and other schemes to satisfy the concerns of 
local communities with respect to uses that, 
while beneficial to the larger society, may not 
be desirable from the local perspectives. 
Ideally, land-use planning should be decen-
tralized and conducted at the local level. Nev-
ertheless, since climate change could exacerbate 
conflicts between competing resource users, in-
creased coordination between managers of dif-
ferent programs (e.g., biodiversity, agriculture, 
forests, water supply), between public and pri-
vate resource managers and between all levels of 
government could be necessary. In a changing 
climate, it may become more important for 
bodies with jurisdiction over different geo-
graphic areas and uses to coordinate land-use 
policies. For example, agricultural and other 
local interest groups and parks managers should 
confer where their interests overlap. Coordina-
tion might usefully be extended to large areas to 
incorporate potentially major shifts in land use. 
Opportunities to strengthen the institutional 
mechanisms for such coordination could be ex-
plored. 
ii) Creating an economic stake for local popula-
tions in conservation areas (B). Opportunities 
for increasing the economic stake and social 
value to surrounding populations in conserva-
tion, preservation, and recreation areas should 
be explored. Without strong ties to the pro-
tected area, populations may have a strong in-
centive to respond negatively to altered land-
use demands caused by climate change, result-
ing, in some cases, in destruction of protected 
areas. 
iii) Invest resource users with 
clear 
"property" 
rights and long-term 
tenure so that resource 
conservation 
and 
regeneration 
are 
enhanced 
(B). Many users of resources do not have an 
interest in long-term sustainability, since they 
either have no land tenure rights or have leases 
with short-term durations. 
iv) Strengthening 
conservation 
and protection 
of 
highly vulnerable areas (B). Certain areas that 
are already under significant stress, such as 
highly erodible farmland, heavily used water 
basins, and some natural areas, may be partic-
192 
I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
ularly sensitive to climate disturbances. In some 
currently stressed areas, climate change could 
relieve existing pressures. Assessments of the 
potential impacts of climate change would help 
identify which areas could be subject to in-
creased stress. Future development in areas that 
may come under increasing stress could con-
sider management tools such as regulation of 
development, purchase from or payments to 
the owner, tax incentives, and impact charges. 
For example, highly erodible or other marginal 
lands may be protected by offering farmers an-
nual payments in lieu of cultivating such land— 
with participation in such programs being 
strictly voluntary. More active management 
and intervention such as the creation of pro-
tected areas, where appropriate, may be neces-
sary to maintain viable populations of certain 
endangered or threatened species. As for all 
responses, social, economic, and environmen-
tal consequences must be considered in evaluat-
ing and selecting options. 
v) Promoting 
resource conservation 
(B). Conser-
vation practices could increase the resilience of 
resources to climatic stresses by moderating lo-
cal climates, promoting water retention, de-
creasing 
soil 
erosion, 
increasing 
genetic 
variability, and reducing other stresses from en-
vironmental degradation. This may allow for 
the maintenance of long-term productivity. 
Particular attention might be given to reduc-
ing deforestation, improving water-use effi-
ciency, 
increasing the use of sustainable 
agricultural and forestry practices, and ensuring 
that the intensity of resource use is consistent 
with carrying capacity. Also, analysis of land-
use options should consider factors such as si-
multaneously accomplishing several objectives 
(e.g., floodplain hazard reduction, wetland and 
fisheries protection, and migration corridor 
needs, as appropriate). 
vi) Improve storage and food distribution 
of agri-
cultural products (B). Improved methods of 
storing and distributing food and agricultural 
products, supplemented by methods of mini-
mizing storage losses, would lessen the severity 
of future food deficits, whether or not caused 
by climate change, and would reduce pressures 
for additional land for food production, thus 
enabling the world to better cope with future 
supply instabilities, especially as human popu-
lations grow substantially. 
vii) Encourage 
efficient and environmentally 
safe 
levels of agricultural 
and forest practices, and 
location and densities for human 
settlements 
(B). Government review of practices, products, 
and technologies that enhance agricultural and 
forest productivity and efficiency of land use 
for human settlements should proceed expe-
ditiously, while balancing the potential benefits 
of such reviews against the costs of delays. Such 
reviews must carefully evaluate environmental 
and health impacts, yet still meet the needs of a 
substantially increasing human population. In 
some areas, changing zoning to allow higher 
population densities would slow the amount of 
land devoted to human settlements and result in 
less agricultural land taken out of production. 
Increased human settlement density would also 
make more efficient energy use possible by, for 
example, increasing the economic feasibility of 
mass transit and district heating and cooling. 
Enhanced research and field trials are necessary 
to improve identification and dissemination of 
new production technologies which take into 
account all externalities of production usually 
left out of the resource management calculus 
(e.g., soil erosion rates, net emissions of green-
house gases, deleterious side effects of pesticide 
use on wildlife). In addition to focusing on local 
environmental effects, environmental reviews 
should take into consideration broader effects 
such as net efficiency of land use. 
viii) Modifying 
economic incentives (B or C). Direct 
and indirect subsidies to agriculture, forestry, 
and development of human settlements can in-
fluence land-use practices. Incentives should be 
reviewed to ensure that they are economically 
efficient and consider the sustainability of land 
use and conservation of biodiversity. However, 
some nations may rationally elect to subsidize 
certain activities for reasons of equity or to meet 
other social goals that may be hard to monetize. 
ix) Strengthening 
and enlarging—and 
establishing 
conservation corridors between—protected nat-
Resource 
Use and 
Management 
193 
urai areas (C). Depending upon the outcome 
of the research outlined in Section 6.7.4.1, 
item (ii) above, further strengthening or en-
largement of protected areas could be beneficial 
for the maintenance of biodiversity and recre-
ation opportunities; poleward or up-slope ad-
ditions in ecotone (i.e., transition) regions 
could be particularly beneficial under a warmer 
climate. In areas/regions that are built up, or 
fenced off, or where very little land is in its 
natural condition, conservation corridors, such 
as greenways, river corridors, trails, hedge-
rows along the edges of fields, and transpor-
tation and transmission corridors could serve 
to facilitate migration of species as well as in-
crease the degree of protection to the species 
involved. 
This, too, would be more beneficial to eco-
tone areas. In addition, corridors could en-
hance 
the 
capacity 
for 
species 
to 
shift 
distributions in response to climate change. O n 
the other hand, in areas where there is sufficient 
land in its natural state or which is not fenced 
off or built up, such corridors may not be func-
tional and might even serve as a barrier to effi-
cient migration. Another potential problem 
with purchasing lands for natural areas or corri-
dors is that, given the uncertainties about re-
gional climate change, the eventual direction 
and magnitude of dispersal cannot be predicted 
with certainty. A n approach that could be ex-
plored would be to set aside protected areas 
with concentric buffer zones of protection 
(e.g., as in biosphere reserves). The most sensi-
tive zone could be the most protected, with 
other zones allowing more human use and oc-
cupancy. Such a design should also consider the 
possibility that species in the highly protected 
zones could migrate out of the area in response 
to climate change. In many cases strengthening 
of existing protected areas through the provi-
sion of greater financial or managerial support 
or increasing the economic stake and social 
value to local communities in protected areas 
may be the best management approach. In any 
case, the social and economic consequences 
of designating lands as protected areas should 
be considered in view of the ecological bene-
fits.

6.8.1 
INTRODUCTION 
Over the last 50 years, technological advances in 
irrigation, mechanization, pesticides, fertilizers, 
and crop and livestock breeding have stabilized and 
increased agricultural production in many parts of 
the world. Our ability to produce food and fiber is 
greater now than at any time in the past. Yet we 
have not succeeded in ensuring food security for all 
the world's population. 
It is estimated that between 500 and 700 million 
people in the developing world do not have access 
to enough food. Malnutrition contributes to the 
deaths of 35,000 children each day. Despite great 
progress in countries such as India, many less-
developed countries already have a serious food se-
curity problem. Food security is determined by the 
availability of food and the ability to acquire it by 
"dependable long-term access to food through local 
production, or through the power to purchase food 
via local, national, regional, or international mar-
kets." Even in the absence of any climate change, 
several countries will find it difficult to maintain or 
enhance food security given expected population 
growth. 
To ensure food security for the world's increasing 
population, it will be necessary to sustain and en-
hance the natural resources on which we depend. 
Economic growth and equity are also musts. But 
most important, the spatial and temporal uncertain-
ties about the impacts of greenhouse gases and asso-
ciated climate change may demand the development 
of flexible policies that allow and encourage local 
adaptations/solutions, 
allow course corrections, 
and take a long-term approach. 
6.8.2 
FACTORS AFFECTING 
F O O D 
SECURITY 
Food security at the national level has three main 
elements: adequacy of supplies, stability of sup-
plies, and access to supplies. 
194 
I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
Ensuring adequacy of supplies involves determin-
ing the appropriate balance between domestic pro-
duction and trade. Increasing domestic production 
is not simply a resource or technology problem, 
although the availability of both are critically im-
portant, and this will become increasingly the case 
in those countries where climate change has nega-
tive effects on food and agricultural production. It is 
a function of four interrelated factors—the four 
"i's" of agricultural development: incentives to en-
courage farmers to produce surplus food for the 
market; inputs to boost productivity; institutions to 
provide credit, technical advice, marketing services, 
etc.; and infrastructure 
in the form of roads, stor-
age, facilities, etc., to link the farmer with input 
supplies and food markets, particularly urban ones. 
For some countries and communities the most 
serious issue is not the long-run adequacy of sup-
plies but year-to-year instability 
of supplies. Such 
instability arises primarily from dependence on 
rain-fed agriculture in drought-prone areas; from 
population pressures that have forced people to cul-
tivate more marginal land and/or to maintain more 
livestock than the rangeland or pastures can feed, 
with consequent wide fluctuations in crop yields 
and high livestock mortality during times of 
drought; from the unwillingness or inability to 
maintain sufficient stocks; from cyclical supply/ 
demand patterns in the world food market; and 
from frequent changes in government policies, sup-
port prices, etc. 
Access to supplies has two major dimensions: a 
national dimension reflecting the ability of coun-
tries to enter the world market to buy additional 
food, which in part is a function of the openness of 
the trade system and the ability of food deficit coun-
tries to earn foreign exchange through exports; and 
a personal income dimension, in that extensive pov-
erty restricts the ability of individuals and house-
holds to buy all the food they need for a healthy 
diet. Thus, local or imported supplies must be 
matched by effective demand and appropriate 
mechanisms to ensure access to supplies by those 
lacking purchasing power. Without such mecha-
nisms the market will maintain supplies at levels that 
leave many people hungry. 
It is apparent then that the solutions to food inse-
curity are not simply technological, but also involve 
economics, infrastructure, and governmental poli-
cies. Developed countries, with their strong econ-
omies, well-established infrastructure, institutions 
and governments, as well as with less dependence 
on the agricultural sector (farming contributes ap-
proximately 2 percent of the annual G N P in the 
United States, compared with 40-60 percent of the 
annual G N P in some less-developed countries), are 
not as vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. 
Although developed countries will no doubt un-
dergo adjustments in their economies and agri-
cultural sectors in the event of climate change, 
national food security should be relatively un-
affected. They will buy food and fiber that they 
cannot produce. 
Low-income countries are more seriously af-
fected by food insecurity. In order to reduce exist-
ing poverty in developing countries from 50 to 10 
percent of the population and thereby improve food 
security, it has been estimated that a 3 percent an-
nual growth in per capita income would be neces-
sary over the next 20 to 30 years. With expected 
population increases, this translates into an overall 
national income growth of 5-6 percent. Such eco-
nomic growth will be difficult if not impossible even 
under the best of circumstances, unless the coun-
tries receive greater international support. 
Without technical assistance from developed na-
tions and significant gains in sustainable economic 
growth and development, food security problems 
could be exacerbated in many nations.

F O O D SECURITY 
IMPLICATIONS 
A N D 
IMPACTS 
Climate change will not affect each of the three 
elements of food security uniformly, and within 
each element the effects may differ as to their global, 
regional, or national importance. 
6.8.3.1 
Climate 
Change and 
Adequacy 
of Supplies 
While the impacts of climate change are uncertain, it 
is possible that the overall impact on global food 
and fiber supplies could be positive. In general there 
may be positive impacts due to increased produc-
tivity resulting from higher C 0 2 levels. Production 
could be further augmented in some areas because 
of longer growing seasons and reduced frost dam-
age. O n the other hand, production may be reduced 
Respurce Use and Management 
195 
in some areas due to higher temperatures, less soil 
moisture and greater pest infestation, and loss of 
land due to sea level rise (see below). 
At the regional level the picture is less certain, but 
there could be substantial potential for intra-
regional compensation. 
Such problems as may occur are likely to be at the 
national or subnational level, particularly in some of 
today's food-deficit developing countries. Food se-
curity in these countries is already a problem be-
cause of poverty and the lack of effective demand, 
stemming in part from the impact of high popula-
tion pressures on limited and low-quality natural 
resources. 
The adequacy of supplies could be affected in 
four principal ways: spatial shifts in the agroclimatic 
zones suited to the growth of specific food crops; 
changes in crop yields, livestock output, and fish-
eries productivity; changes in the water available for 
irrigation; changes in productivity and use of land 
because of sea level rise. Other impacts, such as 
alterations in the protein or starch content of crops 
seem likely to be of far lesser importance. 
Shifts in agroclimatic zones. Climate change could 
shift agroclimatic zones with both positive and neg-
ative effects. In general, zones would shift pole-
ward. In the middle and higher latitudes, higher 
temperatures may extend the growing season and 
reduce frost damage, though some of this positive 
potential may not be realizable (see Section 6.8.3.2). 
At the same time, there may be a loss of agricultural 
land if conditions become drier in currently arid or 
semi-arid regions (though higher carbon dioxide 
concentrations may increase water-use efficiency of 
many—especially cool season—crops). Such shifts 
in agroclimatic zones could cause regional disloca-
tions. 
Sea level rise could have a major effect on food 
security in several areas. Some of the most produc-
tive areas are low-lying coastal plains and estuaries 
with fertile alluvial soils. In Asia, for example, a 
high proportion of rice production comes from 
low-lying coastal areas, mainly former swamps and 
marshes. 
Production on these lands could be lost through 
submergence, longer or deep freshwater flooding in 
some inland parts of low-lying coastal areas, and 
increased saltwater intrusions in coastal aquifers 
used for irrigation or for livestock drinking water. 
However, while these lands could be lost to tradi-
tional uses, new uses (such as fisheries and aquacul-
ture) could also take their place. In reality it may be 
a major threat to food security only in those areas 
already at risk in certain low-income food-deficit 
developing countries. 
Changes in irrigation potential could occur in two 
main ways. First, through changes in the spatial and 
temporal patterns of precipitation, surface run-off 
and recharge rates of aquifers. Second, through salt-
water intrusions into coastal aquifers. In some re-
gions these changes, coupled with changes in 
demand, could exacerbate existing water shortages; 
in other areas, existing shortages could be miti-
gated. 
Impacts on crop yields. With changes in temperature 
and rainfall regimes and in C 0 2 concentrations, 
countries will become more or less optimal for the 
production of certain crops. Thus, yields will rise, 
or fall—unless there are compensating management 
actions or developments in technology. 
While there are uncertainties associated with 
model results, especially on the regional and local 
levels, they project the following. 
a) Considerable increases in potential crop yields 
in northern temperate countries—-up to sev-
eral percent in some instances; however, such 
increases may have little impact on national 
food security since these countries are already 
able to import all of the foods they cannot 
currently produce by spending a small fraction 
of their national income. Even so, such gains 
in potential production may not be fully real-
izable because of plant pests and diseases (see 
Section 6.8.3.2). 
b) In the middle latitudes, potential declines in 
yields in the hotter, drier interior of conti-
nents because decreased rainfalls and in-
creased evapotranspiration may offset positive 
C 0 2 
impacts on photosynthesis and water-
use efficiency. 
c) Limitation of yields may occur in some semi-
arid tropical and sub-tropical areas if the net 
effect of change in temperature and precipita-
tion is a reduction in crop water availability.

I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
Animal husbandry. The effects of climate change on 
animal husbandry will largely mirror those on crop-
ping. Any change which reduces or enhances bio-
mass production will likewise reduce or enhance 
livestock 
carrying capacity. 
Whereas 
climate 
changes are expected to have little effect on crop 
quality, they may have a significant impact on for-
age quality. High temperatures may adversely affect 
reproduction, milk and meat production, but con-
versely will reduce maintenance requirements— 
particularly in temperate areas. 
As with crops, warmer temperatures and in-
creased precipitation will provide favorable condi-
tions for parasites, fungi, bacteria, viruses, and 
insects. This can be expected to contribute to the 
more rapid deterioration of animal products. In-
creases in variability or intensity of rainfall resulting 
in droughts or flooding can cause tremendous losses 
at the local level. 
Fisheries. Fisheries may experience problems simi-
lar to cropping and animal husbandry due to 
changes in temperature and precipitation. Current 
ranges of important commercial species may shift 
poleward along with marine habitats of higher pro-
ductivity. Freshwater ponds which are already near 
the upper temperature limits of tolerance will be lost 
as habitats to some species. Changes in evaporative 
demand, surface run-off and melting in the high 
latitudes may also affect streams and lakes. Coastal 
wetlands, marshes and shallows (which are impor-
tant to most fisheries) and aquaculture facilities may 
be relocated as existing areas are lost and new areas 
created as a result of sea level rise. (However, cre-
ation of suitable new areas may be hampered be-
cause of human barriers in their path.) Again, the 
impact of these effects on economies and food secu-
rity will be felt mostly on a local or national level. 
6.8.3.2 
Climate Change and Stability of Supplies 
Although it is difficult to determine the potential 
net effect of climate change on supply stability at the 
global level, at least four sources of changes need to 
be considered here: 
• Reduction of snap frost damage in high altitude 
tropics and in northern latitudes. Early and late 
season frosts currently have irregular, but at 
times severe, impacts on production, although 
the damage is largely confined to fruit and vege-
table crops. 
• Possible increases in the geographic range and 
severity of both plant and animal pests and dis-
eases. In the absence of corrective actions the 
overall net effect could be negative. Higher 
temperatures will allow pests and diseases to 
over-winter for the first time, or to over-winter 
in larger populations, thereby providing the 
conditions for rapid spread early in the growing 
season to epidemic levels, consequently result-
ing in greater production losses. Heavier and 
more prolonged rainfall could have similar ef-
fects. Such outbreaks currently occur on an ir-
regular basis, causing food supply to fall by as 
much as 50 percent over substantial areas. Cli-
mate change could make such outbreaks a much 
more frequent and widespread event. 
• Possible changes in the annual variability of the 
climate, i.e., reliability of arrival of seasonal 
rainfall, its frequency and intensity. Erratic cli-
mate can lead to delayed planting, mid-season 
and other droughts, and incomplete plant 
growth cycles. In some present instances it can 
reduce cereal production by as much as half, 
and cattle populations by a quarter, leading to 
wide annual swings in food supply. How cli-
mate change will affect annual climate vari-
ability is not known. 
• Possible changes in the frequency and magni-
tude of rainfall may lead to changes in flooding 
and erosion. The effect of climate change on 
these factors is also unknown. 
In addition, changes in climatic variability could 
have impacts on grain quality and, therefore, mar-
ket and nutrition value. However, the direction of 
the net change on this aspect is currently unknown. 
6.8.3.3 
Climate Change and Access to Supplies 
Given that global food supplies may be sufficient to 
meet world demand (and possibly increase), and 
export supplies may be available, any problem of 
access to supplies will likely be more acute in low 
income food-deficit countries, and in low income 
low-lying islands. Although climate change may 
have negative impacts on agricultural production in 
high- and middle-income countries, the consequent 
falls in export earnings or food production are un-
Resource 
Use and 
Management 
197 
likely to be critical for national food security since 
food imports or average per capita food expenditure 
are low in proportion to the respective totals. 
Nonetheless, even within these countries there may 
be particular income groups whose food purchasing 
power will be reduced, either directly or indirectly, 
by climate change. 
Access to food supplies could be affected by 
changes outside agriculture, e.g., loss of tourist rev-
enues by low-lying islands and other areas follow-
ing sea-level rise. The main impacts, however, will 
come from within agriculture. It is conceivable that 
a number of countries could suffer from decreased 
production of their major export crops, 
e.g., 
ground-nuts and cotton, which would also have 
serious impacts on employment and agricultural in-
comes, thereby reducing the ability of individuals 
and households to buy sufficient food. 
Where domestic food production decreases, sig-
nificant income effects are also likely to arise. 
6.8.4 
RESPONSE STRATEGIES A N D 
ADAPTATION MEASURES 
The uncertainties concerning the magnitude, tim-
ing, and spatial distribution of the impacts on food 
security point to the need for response strategies 
with two principal objectives. First, the alleviation 
or elimination of those current food security prob-
lems that might be intensified by climate change— 
e.g., flooding in Bangladesh and drought in the 
Sahel. Second, the maintenance for future genera-
tions of as wide a range of adaptation measures as 
possible—e.g., breeding from rare livestock breeds 
and crop land races that are well adapted to the 
agroclimatic conditions that could emerge but that 
are currently dying out through the lack of adequate 
conservation efforts. 
The first objective can be achieved through gen-
eral improvement in economic conditions, espe-
cially in developing nations, and through a range of 
economically justifiable adaptation measures, most 
of which already exist or could be developed, given 
the likely time scale of climate change. 
These measures include capital investment, tech-
nology development and dissemination, and re-
source management changes. They are considered 
in the following sections. 
The second objective has essentially three com-
ponents: (a) changes in land-use policy to ensure, 
for example, that high quality agricultural land is 
not lost permanently through urban and industrial 
development and is kept in good condition through 
appropriate management; (b) enhancement of bio-
diversity conservation efforts—both in situ and ex 
situ; and (c) changes in policies to intensify and 
sustain agricultural production on the best lands in 
order to remove pressure from some of the more 
marginal lands. Response strategies for these are 
given in Section 6.7 of this document. 
The following subsections present options to en-
hance and/or maintain food security. They employ 
the classification scheme described in Section 6.4. 
Under this scheme, Category A consists of options 
that would improve the knowledge base necessary 
to fashion rational and efficient responses to in-
creases in greenhouse gas concentrations and associ-
ated climate change. Category B consists of options 
that some societies may be able to undertake in the 
short term if they result in little or no additional 
costs (or consequences). 
Category C identifies 
long-term options that may be considered once un-
certainties regarding greenhouse gas concentrations 
and climate change are reduced. 
6.8.4.1 General Response Options 
1) Since the developing countries have largely 
resource-based economies, efforts concen-
trating on the improvement of agricultural 
and natural resources would be beneficial (B, 
C). However, some assistance in improving 
economic conditions in developing nations 
comes directly or indirectly from developed 
nations, some of whom are themselves beset 
with budget difficulties. 
2) Improve agricultural and natural resource 
research/extension institutions, specifically: 
(a) national coordination for local level ef-
forts due to the uncertainty of local level 
effects of climate change; (b) regional net-
working activities to pool resources and 
share technology/responses; and (c) support 
for these activities from developed countries 
in terms of training researchers, extension 
agents, and natural resource managers, and 
technological assistance (A). 
I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
Gradually reduce international trade barriers 
and farm subsidies in both developed and 
developing countries to foster 
economic 
growth in less-developed countries and allow 
the agricultural sector to compete in a more 
global marketplace (B-C). 
Intensify agricultural production on a sus-
tainable basis on the best lands in order to 
remove pressure from some of the more mar-
ginal lands. Better water and soil manage-
ment and more efficient use of water, 
fertilizer, and pesticide will also be necessary 
to sustain this intensive production (B, C). 
Develop new food products that can be more 
easily stored, and improve storage facilities 
where yields tend to be unstable (A). 
Develop baseline information on and moni-
tor changes in climate, crop production, pest 
and disease incidence, livestock fecundity 
and quality, and fisheries, at local, regional, 
and global levels (A). Look for irreversible 
changes, and changes that can be used as indi-
cators of climate change. 
Protect germ plasm resources and biodiver-
sity. Increased research on the preservation 
of plant, animal, insect, nematode, and mi-
croorganism resources may be needed. New 
breeding efforts (including genetic engineer-
ing) may be necessary to develop crop and 
livestock tolerance to both physical and bio-
logical stresses. Research on biocontrol and 
the plant rhizosphere may uncover new, 
beneficial uses for insects, nematodes, and 
microorganisms (A). 
Review the current knowledge base of agri-
cultural technology and identify best bets for 
further investigation and possible transfer to 
other locales and regions (A). 
Continue development and maintenance of 
data bases for species, technology, and man-
agement and land-use practices employed 
under different climatic conditions, for pos-
sible transfer to other locales and regions if, 
and when, climate shifts become more cer-
tain (A). 
10) Continue research and development of heat-
and drought-tolerant crop and livestock vari-
eties (A). 
11) In the long run, as and when uncertainties 
regarding climate change and its impacts at a 
regional level are sufficiently reduced, in 
areas that are likely to be significantly ad-
versely affected 
agricultural communities 
may have to shift to new crops and possibly 
accelerate changes that may have occurred 
anyway—e.g., by adoption of new technol-
ogies, practices, and even new livelihoods 
(C). Implementing the above set of responses 
1-10 would help facilitate any such transi-
tions. 
Options are available for both investment and man-
agement (technical change) and could be used to 
enhance or maintain food security. 
Many of the arid and semi-arid areas vulnerable 
to climate change have undeveloped irrigation po-
tential. In other similar areas, current irrigation wa-
ter use is depleting water tables. Solutions to both 
these situations may be expensive and, therefore, 
may not be economic for low-value food crops. 
This cost constraint can be overcome partly by sec-
ondary investment in raising water-use efficiency so 
that a larger area can be irrigated with a given vol-
ume of water, and by improving drainage to prevent 
salinization. Drainage investment will also be re-
quired in rain-fed areas where soils are already wa-
terlogged periodically (B-C, depending on whether 
or not it can be economically justified now), or 
which could become waterlogged as a result of in-
creased rainfall (C). 
In areas where reduced rainfall could lead to 
lower water tables, it may be economic to consider 
artificial recharge of aquifers. 
Similarly, it may be economic in some areas to 
consider coast protection, storm surge and tidal 
barriers, and other forms of flood control. Such 
measures, however, could be very expensive and 
result in ecological change. Given that the sea level 
rise will be gradual, the high-income countries 
should be able to afford preventive measures like 
higher coastal defenses and special tidal barriers. 
For the low-income countries, however, invest-
ment capital is already in short supply and in many

Measures for Crop 
Production 
Resource Use and 
Management 
199 
of them is likely to remain too low for them to be 
able to afford such coastal defenses. Therefore the 
building of higher coastal defenses to deal exclu-
sively with climate change should be deferred until 
uncertainties are reduced (C). O n the other hand, 
augmenting an existing plan to "insure" against cli-
mate change may be justified (B). 
Finally, there is investment in grain storage to 
"insure" against greater fluctuation in annual rain-
fall. When such investments are primarily at the 
farm level, the costs can be relatively modest and 
feasible since the stores tend to be built with local 
materials and household labor (B-C). 
Most technical change options concern shifts in 
plant-breeding strategies to improve pest resistance, 
heat or drought tolerance, etc. Given that plant-
breeding cycles are usually less than 10 to 15 years, 
such improvements could keep pace with slow cli-
mate changes provided appropriate germ plasm is 
available (A). 
Adaptation and introduction of existing tech-
niques also has an important role to play. Minimal 
tillage, for example, has been developed primarily 
as a technique for highly mechanized farming sys-
tems in industrialized countries where improve-
ments in soil erosion control and soil water 
management are required. If adapted for developing 
country conditions it could play an important role 
in areas experiencing greater aridity (A, B-C). 
Other techniques to conserve soil and water and 
increase sustainability of resources which could be 
more widely used include: tied ridges, conservation 
bench terracing, mechanical and vegetative bund-
ing, weed control, legume and sod-based rotations, 
windbreaks, drip irrigation, more efficient fertilizer 
and pest management, and appropriate cultivars (A, 
B-C). Areas with adequate water resources can be 
irrigated, although attention should be given to 
drainage systems (C). Salinization can be problem-
atic on clay soils with poor drainage and in areas 
with high evaporative demand. Drainage systems 
may also be necessary in areas with clay soils that 
experience precipitation increases. 
Other management options include changes in 
the timing of farm operations—e.g., shifts in plant-
ing dates to compensate for changes in rainfall dis-
tribution (C). Additional gains could come from 
changes in cropping patterns through the introduc-
tion of "new" crops better suited to the modified 
agroclimatic conditions (C). 
6.8.4.3 Livestock Sector Options for Adaptation 
The most serious threats to food security for the 
livestock sector will be confined largely to the arid 
and semi-arid areas of the middle and lower lati-
tudes, where nomadism or settled extensive or 
semi-intensive livestock systems are the only way of 
exploiting vast areas of relatively marginal grass-
land, particularly in the countries surrounding the 
Sahara desert. 
Other agroecologically marginal areas, notably 
those in Australia, North America, and the USSR, 
could also be adversely affected, but without posing 
a significant risk to national food security, although 
individual farmers would need support. 
In the most severe situations, where pasture pro-
duction is substantially reduced, the main option 
may be to assist livestock owners and their families 
to move out of livestock into crop production or 
out of agriculture altogether into different areas of 
the same country (C). 
Where impacts are less severe, mitigation of the 
effects of climate change may be achieved through 
the installation of water points for livestock (C); by 
research and breeding to select animals and pasture 
or fodder plants better adapted to the new environ-
ment (A). New breeding techniques, like embryo 
transfer, increase the probability of being able to 
achieve improvements on an appropriate time scale. 
Finally, improvements in livestock management 
may be possible. These could include: improved 
rations utilizing supplementary protein, vitamins 
and minerals (B); reductions in stocking rates (al-
though this is often difficult to achieve in practice 
where communal grazing land is involved) (B-C); 
improvements in pasture management (B-C); wider 
use of feed conservation techniques and fodder 
banks (B-C). 
In higher latitudes where conditions may become 
warmer and wetter, pasture productivity is likely to 
rise, but pests and diseases could become more se-
rious. Nonetheless, the net effect on production in 
such areas is likely to be positive. 
6.8.4.4 Adaptation Measures for Fisheries 
Fish have food, recreational, and cultural value. 
There will be three main impacts from climate 
change: changes in the abundance and distribution 
200 
I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
of fish stocks; overall changes in the variability of 
individual fish stocks; and changes in inland, 
coastal, and oceanic habitats. 
Options for the first include strengthening or, 
where appropriate, establishing fisheries institu-
tions that could assist in managing or allocating 
changing fish stocks due to effects of climate change 
(B) ; shifting fishing from coastal to distant waters 
(C) ; development of inshore or inland aquaculture 
(C); and finally, employment creation outside the 
sector (C). 
Responses to the second impact are part of wider 
measures to improve fisheries management. Fish-
eries management policies may need to be strength-
ened or modified, as appropriate, along with 
associated fish population-and-catch monitoring 
activities, to prevent overfishing where stocks de-
cline or to ensure sustainable exploitation of im-
proved fisheries stocks (B,C). In some areas, it takes 
many years for changes in fisheries policies to be 
developed and become fully effective. The time 
scale of policy change should be considered in 
weighing various management options. 
Consideration of options regarding changes in 
inland, coastal, and oceanic habitat is necessary to 
reduce any potential negative impacts as well as to 
take advantage of new habitat that may be created. 
One option is to consider fisheries (wild and aqua-
culture) habitat needs in planning coastal protection 
measures (B,C). 
Other options are strongly research-based and 
will need general strengthening of research institu-
tions (A) as well as more specific actions. The latter 
include restocking with ecologically sound species 
following biological and commercial evaluation of 
indigenous and non-indigenous species (A, C). Fish 
breeding supported by measures to conserve the 
genetic diversity and inherent variability of existing 
fish populations could also play an important role 
(A). Furthermore, increased research into popula-
tion dynamics and adaptive measures is needed (A). 
Moreover, the use of aquatic and marine species as 
indicators of change needs to be explored and, if 
necessary, enhanced (A). 
Given the close interaction between land cover 
and maintenance of adequate fishery habitat, fish-
ery managers need to cooperate closely with for-
estry and other resource managers (B). This is 
critical for policy success in this field. 
Marine mammals (e.g., whales, dolphins, seals) 
are of increasing cultural importance and decreasing 
significance for food. Most stocks of these animals 
will likely move as marine ecosystems shift to adapt 
to changes in temperature and circulation patterns 
and, as a consequence, may not be significantly 
affected, at least in abundance. Required adaptation 
measures are probably limited to scientific monitor-
ing (A) and ensuring that habitat needs are also 
considered from the standpoints of coastal planning 
and in ocean pollution control efforts (B-C).

I N T R O D U C T I O N 
7.1.1 
A n environmentally informed global popu-
lation is essential to addressing and coping with 
climate change. Throughout the world in whatever 
the sphere of human activity or exchange, there is 
now ignorance, apprehension, and confusion about 
climate change. For some individuals, groups, and 
organizations, the problem is unknown, irrelevant, 
or remote. For others, it is of overwhelming pro-
portion or misunderstood. Few bring to the world 
forum a workable grasp of the issue and the poten-
tial adverse consequences of climate change. De-
spite the fact that there are uncertainties and 
unknown dimensions about the topic, there is little 
disagreement among experts about the importance 
of understanding about greenhouse gas emissions 
and achieving sustainable human development. 
Given the importance of a well-informed popula-
tion, the Working Group developed suggestions 
and approaches for improving international aware-
ness about the causes and potential impacts of cli-
mate change. These suggestions and approaches are 
summarized in this section. While it was recognized 
that broad-based understanding is essential, it was 
also appreciated that no single mechanism or tem-
plate can work for every group or in every culture 
or country. The social, economic, and cultural di-
versity of nations will likely require educational 
approaches and information tailored to the specific 
requirements and resources of particular locales, 
countries, or regions. Nonetheless, international 
collaboration is critical to taking efficient and effec-
tive steps. So, too, is mobilizing and fully integrat-
ing the expertise and resources of international 
organizations. Although education must ultimately 
be context-specific and reflect what individuals and 
organizations can best do to make a difference, the 
commonality of the climate change problem re-
quires cooperative solutions. 
Across communities and target audiences, educa-
tion and information should be geared toward mak-
ing people more capable of dealing with the 
problems associated with climate change and better 
able to make responsible decisions as full global 
partners. Education is used broadly to encompass 
formal and informal processes of teaching and 
learning that occur throughout the life of the indi-
vidual in the home, the school, the workplace and a 
range of other settings where instruction, training, 
and firsthand experience are conveyed. Similarly, 
information refers to materials and data that are 
produced and accessible in a variety of formats 
varying in formality and technical sophistication. 
Thus, for purposes of IPCC response strategies, 
both education and information are interactive and 
dynamic ways of fostering new levels of environ-
mental sensitivity and awareness in public and pri-
vate lives. 
7.1.2 
It was recognized that a set of guiding prin-
ciples must govern the structure for developing and 
implementing education and public information 
measures. First, multilevel approaches are impor-
tant; both education and information measures 
must be appropriate to international, regional, na-
tional, and local formats and to wide-ranging audi-
ences from individuals to private and public sector 
organizations. Second, education and information 
strategies must be attentive to the cultural and 
multi-cultural diversity within and between nations 
and regions, including language diversity and the 
capacity to communicate fundamental concepts. 
Third, there must be sensitivity to other national 
differences, including those between developed and 
developing nations in education and information 
213 
214 
I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
resources, in mass media capacity, and in other re-
gional variations. Fourth, education and informa-
tion mechanisms must strengthen an appreciation of 
commonality and global interdependence among 
people facing the complex issues of climate change. 
Finally, it is important to convey an understanding 
that early responses are essential to resolving prob-
lems of future generations. 
This report examines public education and infor-
mation on climate change in terms of aims, audi-
ences, measures, and actions. Each is addressed in 
turn. It must be emphasized, however, that these 
sections do not stand on their own merit but are 
closely interrelated. The aims, audiences, measures, 
and actions identified in this section in reality also 
fall into three overlapping categories—those of im-
mediate concern, those of the near term, and those 
of a long-range nature. In devising public education 
and information mechanisms, a balance between 
long-term and short-term actions is recommended. 
Additionally, there must be a balance between top-
down and bottom-up target audiences. 
7.2 
A I M S 
7.2.1 
The purpose of public education and infor-
mation is to foster a common understanding about 
causes and effects of global climate change. There is 
also a need to change public attitudes and policies to 
effect responses to climate change. 
7.2.2 
The core aims may be summarized as fol-
lows: 
• Promote awareness and knowledge of climate 
change issues. 
• Encourage positive practices to limit and/or 
adapt to climate change. 
• Encourage wide participation by all countries, 
both developed and developing, in addressing 
climate change and developing appropriate re-
sponses. 
Among the aims of education and information is the 
need to ensure timely flow of authoritative, frank, 
and dispassionate information about global climate 
change, exchanging the most up-to-date informa-
tion as it becomes available. The information must 
fit into general approaches for information dissem-
ination on world environmental problems. 
7.2.3 
A n aware public is absolutely essential if 
politicians and other decision makers are to mobil-
ize the necessary means to limit the effects. Most 
people realize that climate changes exceed the length 
of human life; yet, unlike the physical Earth where 
deterioration is visible to the naked eye, deteriora-
tion of the air is not a tangible element. Therefore, a 
priority should be placed on education and infor-
mation because attitudinal and behavioral changes 
can bring about structural change in production and 
consumption processes. Global strategies defined 
by I P C C and others at all levels can convince 
leaders of the need for joint or complementary ac-
tion to achieve common goals—to foster a concept 
of global common good. 
These aims can be met by governments ensuring 
the understanding, support, knowledge, and ex-
pertise of the private sector, 
including non-
governmental organizations, and the general public 
and by moving normally long-term measures of 
public education and information into the main-
stream much more rapidly. Recognizing that well-
planned and well-organized public information and 
education are separate activities, both must develop 
on parallel tracks, both must form an inseparable 
part of response strategies, and both must be open 
to public action so that people feel directly con-
cerned and mobilized. 
7.3 
A U D I E N C E S 
7.3.1 
The audience or target groups include ev-
eryone. N o person or organization should be ex-
cluded. For purposes of discussion, audiences are 
aggregated into common or related groups that 
might best be served by particular activities. 
7.3.2 
These audiences include present and future 
generations of children and youth as well as individ-
uals at household levels. Public and private sector 
policymakers and leaders at each level (local, na-
tional, and international) are a high priority, special 
Public Education 
and Information 
Mechanisms

target for immediate and short-term actions. Fur-
ther, media, educators and educational institutions, 
and scientists and other professional groups and 
their organizations similarly comprise an important 
group. Finally, but no less important, industrial, 
business, and agricultural sectors are key target 
groups. In particular, attention should be given to 
the bulk of the rural population.

7.4.1 
Informational and educational 
materials 
must be developed. Materials should be objective 
and reflect broadly accepted assessments of the sci-
ence of climate change suitable for use throughout 
the world. A n explanation of the range of uncer-
tainty is essential for clearly understanding the 
scope of the issue. Because of the dynamic nature of 
climate issues and because research is constantly 
producing new knowledge, information and educa-
tional materials must be periodically revised and 
updated. Informational and educational materials 
should include data on: resource and energy conser-
vation; efficient utilization of energy sources with 
reduced carbon dioxide emissions; control of air 
pollutant emissions; and promotion of sound na-
tional conservation strategies that highlight the spe-
cial role of conservation of forests and reforest-
ation/afforestation in climate change issues. 
7.4.2 
Materials should provide consistent, reli-
able, and realistic information on climate change 
and its consequences in simple and attractive for-
mats. Such materials should also include special at-
tention to the mechanics of the atmosphere and the 
interaction of human activities with it. 
7.4.3 
Materials should be appropriate for use by 
technology-based learning media ranging from ba-
sic radio, television, film, and video through very 
sophisticated levels of computer-interactive sys-
tems. Information in the form of basic data can be 
supplied by scientists and other professionals who 
develop the scientific base from which extension 
personnel develop the materials provided to the end 
users. This maintains a continual flow of knowledge 
and information needed to keep the public well 
informed. It is important to choose instruments, 
however, that are adapted to the receiver of the 
message. What is appropriate for one country or 
region likely will not be for another. 
Mass media—in particular, radio, television, 
oral, and print—must play an important role in 
developing and providing an in-depth approach to 
both education and information, ranging from in-
formation for schools to detailed publications and 
radio programming to meet special needs. Atten-
tion should also be given to developing forms of 
communication in more remote areas in developing 
countries. 
7.4.4 
Information packets, textbooks, and other 
educational materials for use in schools, as well as 
more detailed materials to meet teacher-preparation 
and trainer needs, must be developed. 
7.4.5 
Countries with information on the labeling 
of energy-efficient and environmentally preferred 
or low emission products should compile such in-
formation and make it available to all countries. 
Such information must be continually updated and 
provided quickly and effectively to all sectors.

7.5.1 
N A T I O N A L A N D L O C A L ACTIONS 
7.5.1.1 
National committees or other organiza-
tions on climate change should be encouraged or 
clearinghouses should be established to collect, de-
velop, and disseminate materials on climate change. 
This could help provide focal points for information 
on issues such as energy efficiency, energy savings, 
forestry, agriculture, environmentally sound hous-
ing and transportation efficiency. Information ex-
changes would also provide a means to share 
technical knowledge and expertise. 
7.5.1.2 
Information obtained through greenhouse 
gas emission audits may be used to identify the size 
of the problem as it relates to each nation. Practices 
216 
I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
may then be identified which would provide simple 
and cost-effective actions. Use of available research 
about attitudes and behavior of populations may be 
used to define local and national programs, identify 
primary and secondary target audiences, and enable 
the setting of realistic goals. 
7.5.1.3 It is important to consider the following 
procedures for the development of action programs 
at this level: 
• Organize symposia, seminars, and workshops. 
(For example, use professional and scientific 
societies to develop special programs for engi-
neers, architects, land-use planners, and other 
designers and policymakers, making them 
aware of how they can contribute to energy 
efficiency and conservation, and anticipate 
likely impacts of climate change.) 
• Develop specialized programs to provide train-
ing for educators and communicators (for ex-
ample, media personnel). 
• Devise or work through existing programs that 
will take advantage of local language and local 
culture. (For example, use public meetings and 
hearings, community organizations, and radio 
programs to inform the public.) 
• Establish or use existing extension-type service 
organizations to assist in technology transfer 
and education. 
• Establish local outreach through the develop-
ment of, or use of, existing support groups. 
• Call on the skill, structure, and involvement of 
local and regional special interest groups, for 
example, women's organizations and environ-
mental interest groups. 
• Use media campaigns to raise awareness about 
climate change concerns affecting the public 
and about what individuals themselves can do 
in their daily lives with regard to them. 
• Develop and/or strengthen, in the developing 
countries, the role of N G O s specializing in the 
field of environment, particularly in the field of 
global climate change. 
7.5.1.4 It is important to recognize that, irrespec-
tive of global climate change problems, certain ac-
tions at the local level are environmentally useful. 
These include education and information on the 
utilization of available alternative technology and 
on utilization of all resources as efficiently as possi-
ble, recycling waste where economically practica-
ble, encouraging more efficient use of all forms of 
energy, increasing tree planting, and minimizing 
loss of biomass. 
7.5.2 
INTERNATIONAL ACTIONS 
7.5.2.1 
International organizations 
( U N E S C O , 
U N E P , W M O , etc.) should utilize IPCC reports in 
developing and providing to all countries under-
standable guidelines for future program actions. 
7.5.2.2 
A n international institution should be de-
veloped or an existing international institution 
should serve as a clearinghouse for existing and 
newly developed informational and educational ma-
terials. Focal points within existing networks 
should be established for the development or coor-
dination of materials specific to global climate 
change issues. 
7.5.2.3 
Upon completion of IPCC reports, semi-
nars should be developed that focus on providing 
informational programs and educational materials 
to developing countries. 
7.5.2.4 
Information activities should pay special 
attention to the issues of geographic isolation, cul-
tural and linguistic diversity, and the absence of 
effective mass media within certain regions and 
countries throughout the world. 
7.5.3 
IMMEDIATE RESPONSES 
While a number of actions are immediately feasible 
at the international, national, and local levels, some 
specific examples are provided below to illustrate 
the inter-relationship between components dis-
cussed earlier and available steps. 
7.5.3.1 
Develop strategies at the national, re-
gional, and international level for the production, 
communication, and release of the IPCC reports. 
Participation by invited experts from the develop-
Public Education and Information Mechanisms 
217 
ing countries at this stage in particular, and in the 
IPCC activities in general, is highly desirable; fund-
ing for such participation should be ensured. 
7.5.3.2 Upon completion of the I P C C reports, or 
earlier as also proposed by the I P C C Special Com-
mittee, a series of short-term seminars should be 
targeted to inform high-priority decision makers, 
world leaders, scientists and other professionals, 
education and media developers, both in the public 
and private sectors, of the causes and effects of 
climate change, and the related international efforts 
already under way. This should include specially 
formatted publications, news releases, and related 
media events. Existing institutions (international 
organizations and NGOs) may be approached to 
determine interest in implementing such a seminar 
series. 
7.5.3.3 
Establish multi-disciplinary national com-
mittees, or other forms of national coordinating 
mechanisms, on climate change, to build a partner-
ship for implementing educational and informa-
tional 
strategies 
nationally and to 
establish 
appropriate networks with international and re-
gional organizations. Through such mechanisms, or 
otherwise, establish focal points in each country. 
This and other measures would help improve distri-
bution channels for dissemination of up-to-date in-
formation. 
7.5.3.4 
Solicit the support of international and re-
gional organizations and N G O s for curriculum de-
velopment by devising model courses of studies at 
various levels for primary grades through univer-
sities. These could be expected to include educa-
tional material (trainer and student texts) tailored at 
the national or local level, including appropriate 
specific examples of what individuals, organiza-
tions, and institutions can themselves do. 
7.5.3.5 Solicit the support of the international and 
regional organizations and N G O s in implementing 
educational and informational strategies in general. 
The immediate responses should take special ac-
count of the needs of the developing countries. In 
this connection, it may be noted that a Special Com-
mittee on the Participation of the Developing 
Countries has been established by IPCC for such 
purposes.

SUGGESTIONS FOR PROGRAMMES

The RSWG called for greater cooperation among all 
nations to improve and transfer existing technolo-
gies, develop and transfer new technologies, and 
improve the exchange of technological information 
to limit or adapt to climate change. 
Many countries noted the need to tailor technolo-
gies to the domestic technological and human re-
source capabilities of developing countries and to 
better develop those capabilities. 
Impediments to technology transfer and mecha-
nisms to overcome those impediments were dis-
cussed at length. 
8.1 
T E C H N O L O G I C A L 
D E V E L O P M E N T 
A . 
OVERVIEW 
1) Technological development, including im-
provement and reassessment of existing tech-
nologies, is urgently needed to: 
(a) limit or reduce anthropogenic greenhouse 
gas emissions; 
(b) absorb greenhouse gases—i.e., protect 
and increase greenhouse gas sinks; 
(c) adapt human activities to the impacts of 
climate change; and 
(d) monitor, detect, 
and predict climate 
change and its impacts. 
2) Technological actions designed to limit or 
adapt to climate change must be founded on a 
sound scientific basis, and must be consistent 
with the concept of sustainable development. 
3) Criteria 
(a) In selecting technologies, priority should 
be given to those technologies that provide 
significant economic and social benefits in 
addition to benefits in limiting or adapting 
to climate change, 
(b) Appropriate criteria for selecting technol-
ogies (and for technology transfer mea-
sures) also include economic efficiency, 
taking into account all the external costs 
and benefits. Account must also be taken 
of suitability to local needs and condi-
tions, additional benefits, ease of adminis-
tration, information needs, legal and 
institutional constraints, national security 
(including defense, economy, energy, and 
food), and acceptability to the public. 
4) (a) Technological development will have to be 
pursued in a wide range of sectors and 
activities such as energy (including non-
commercial sources), industry, agricul-
ture, and transport and management of 
natural resources. 
(b) Adequate and trained human resources in 
all the countries are a prerequisite for de-
velopment and transfer of technologies. 
(c) The growth of industrial and agricultural 
activities is one of the main anthropogenic 
components of the greenhouse 
effect. 
Technological advances to limit or adapt 
to climate change are critically important 
to provide a sound basis of sustainable de-
velopment. 
B. 
MEASURES FOR PROMOTION OF 
TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT 
1) Policies 
(a) Appropriate pricing policy that takes into 
account external (including environmen-
tal) costs and benefits, while recognizing 
223 
224 
I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
that it may not be easy to assess them 
accurately, is one of the key factors in 
determining the rate and direction of tech-
nological development, 
(b) In sectors where price signals do not elicit 
an adequate response, appropriate policies 
and incentives will be needed. 
2) Information 
(a) There is a need for international informa-
tion exchange to enable decision makers to 
continuously monitor development of 
technologies to limit or adapt to climate 
change. In this connection, it is necessary 
to ask where and how existing information 
systems are inadequate. 
(b) Governments should work cooperatively 
to conduct periodic assessments of the 
state of these technologies. 
(c) There is a need to develop methodologies 
to assess the social, environmental, and 
economic consequences of actions or inac-
tions on climate change. 
(d) There is an urgent need for economic an-
alyses and supporting scientific informa-
tion to determine external costs and 
benefits referred to B.l.(a) above. 
3) Support of Technological Development by 
Governments 
Governments may need to support the devel-
opment of technologies where such develop-
ment by the private sector is not feasible. 
4) Collaborative Efforts 
(a) International collaborative efforts can ac-
celerate development of technologies and 
offer substantial potential savings for all 
countries. Such efforts as already exist in 
bilateral and multilateral contexts, includ-
ing those in several U N and other interna-
tional organizations, need to be strength-
ened and expanded. 
(b) Such collaborative efforts as those existing 
in some countries between the private sec-
tor and government to develop technolo-
gies could be expanded further to include 
developing countries and international or-
ganizations. 
(c) Industrialized countries should take every 
feasible measure to assist and cooperate 
with (help) developing countries to ac-
quire and apply these technologies effec-
tively. Developing countries should be 
encouraged and assisted to develop their 
own technologies to achieve self-reliance.

AREAS FOR 
TECHNOLOGICAL 
DEVELOPMENT 
The following areas have been suggested for consid-
eration for technological development: 
1) Limitation 
(a) Limit or reduce C 0 2 emissions globally. 
(b) Absorb emitted C 0
2 (by growing bio-
mass, by work on chemical methods). 
(c) Limit or reduce emissions (use) of ozone-
depleting substances with greenhouse po-
tential (under the Montreal Protocol to the 
Vienna Convention). 
(d) Limit or reduce C H 4 emissions globally. 
(e) Limit or reduce N 2 0 emissions globally. 
(f) Limit or reduce 0 3 emissions globally. 
2) Adaptation 
(a) Manage coastal resources—e.g., erosion 
or flooding of coastal cities, ports, trans-
port routes, agriculture, estuarine saliniz-
ation from storm/tidal surges. 
(b) Manage water resources—e.g., 
water 
supply, 
flood 
control 
(groundwater, 
catchments, irrigation, river navigation, 
etc.). 
(c) Ensure adequate agricultural response 
(availability of temperature- and dryness-
tolerant varieties; correct rotation). 
(d) Ensure adequate forestry response (avail-
ability of temperature, dryness- and fire-
tolerant varieties; correct rotation). 
(e) Ensure adequate fishery response (changes 
in ocean currents, fishing grounds). 
(f) Revise soil mechanics criteria (permafrost, 
soil moisture, pore-water pressures). 
(g) Respond to changes in duration of ice-
closure of ports, rivers, coastal seas. 
3) Monitoring and Scientific Analyses 
(a) Global monitoring and related modeling 
Technology Development and Transfer 
225 
of atmospheric and ocean phenomena to 
try to detect warming signals, improve 
predictive capacity, assess climate sensi-
tivity, and estimate delays in reaching 
equilibrium conditions. 
(b) Monitor build-up of G H G s in atmo-
sphere. 
(c) Monitor sea level changes. 
(d) Monitor forests. 
(e) Systematic 
integrated 
monitoring of 
human-induced changes in ecosystems, 
land use, and ocean resources to determine 
their contribution to climatic change. 
(f) Investigate biogeochemistry of past and 
ongoing climate-change related phenom-
ena for better understanding of climate 
change mechanisms and impacts. 
(The RSWG recommended that the question of 
biodiversity and climate change be examined by 
Working Group II.)

OVERVIEW 
1) As the greenhouse gas emissions in developing 
countries are increasing with their population 
and economic growth, rapid transfer, on a 
preferential basis, to developing countries, of 
technologies that help to monitor, limit, or 
adapt to climate change, without hindering 
their economic development, is an urgent re-
quirement. 
2) It is important to understand the needs, op-
portunities, and constraints of the recipients 
when undertaking technology transfer. 
3) Many of the available technologies or those 
being developed in industrialized countries 
will have to be adapted to meet the conditions 
or needs of the developing countries. 
4) Substantial efforts to transfer technologies to 
developing countries are now occurring under 
existing bilateral and multilateral arrange-
ments. These should be strengthened and ex-
panded. 
B. 
FACTORS T H A T IMPEDE EFFECTIVE 
TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGIES A N D 
SUGGESTED SOLUTIONS 
1) A consensus has emerged on some of the fac-
tors that impede effective transfer of technolo-
gies that assist to limit or adapt to climate 
change and on the steps needed to address 
them. Such factors include: 
(a) lack of necessary institutions and trained 
human resources in developing countries; 
(b) social factors that inhibit change from es-
tablished ways; 
(c) lack of resources for purchase, operation, 
and maintenance of new technologies; and 
(d) higher initial capital costs in the case of 
some technology options. 
The suggested solutions to address these fac-
tors are: better utilization of existing multi-
lateral and bilateral development institutions 
to finance transfer of technologies; strength-
ening or creation of the necessary institutions; 
training of human resources; and introduction 
and operation of new technologies and estab-
lishment of new funding mechanisms, as ap-
propriate, to address these issues. The issue of 
funding mechanisms is discussed in the paper 
on Financial Measures and the report of the 
Special Committee. The governments, it is 
suggested, can provide grants, loans, and loan 
guarantees to overcome obstacles of high ini-
tial costs. 
For many countries, in particular develop-
ing countries, addressing this matter is of high 
priority. 
2) Introduction of new technologies is some-
times delayed by decisions of governments 
aimed at prevention of closure of existing in-
dustries that might cause economic and social 
disruption. The national governments and the 
international community should constantly 
226 
I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
strive to remove the difficulties and to facili-
tate the introduction of new environmentally 
8.3 
S U G G E S T I O N S F O R 
benign technologies, without hindering sus- 
P R O G R A M M E S 
tainable development. 
3) There are two other factors that impede trans-
fer of technologies that assist to limit or adapt 
to climate change. These are: 
(a) existence of legal barriers and restrictive 
trade practices which impede transfer of 
technologies; and 
(b) constraints arising from property rights 
involved in the development of technolo-
gies. 
There is, however, a divergence of opinion on 
the solutions needed to address these factors. 
While some hold that a strict protection of 
property rights, patents, etc., will promote 
effective development and transfer of technol-
ogy, others hold that the level of such protec-
tion should conform with overall economic 
and development policies of the recipient 
countries. There are differences of opinion on 
the legal barriers and the methods to remove 
restrictive trade practices. It is noted that these 
issues are under in-depth discussion in other 
forums such as G A T T and U N C T A D , but no 
agreement has emerged. 
C . 
ISSUES TO BE F O L L O W E D U P 
Developing countries are of the view that transfer of 
technologies on a non-commercial basis is necessary 
and that specific bilateral and multilateral arrange-
ments should be established to promote this. Some 
other countries where technologies are not owned 
by the government believe that transfer of technolo-
gies would be a function of commercial negotia-
tions. It has not been possible to bridge the 
difference on views on these questions. It is ex-
tremely important to reach early international 
agreement on these issues, and other questions 
raised above, in order to promote effective flow of 
technologies to monitor, limit, or adapt to climate 
change. 
The following illustrative programmes are sug-
gested to facilitate technology development and 
transfer: 
1) Global 
energy programme. 
Designate ex-
perts on energy programming from respec-
tive countries who are to cooperate among 
themselves to formulate a coherent global en-
ergy programme, taking into account energy 
requirements and environmental objectives. 
2) Technology research centers. Establish or ex-
pand regional or national technology re-
search centers to develop technologies for 
basic infrastructure, energy efficiency, and 
alternative energy sources, agriculture, for-
estry, and water resources. 
3) Energy efficiency standards. Establish stan-
dards on the energy efficiency of imported 
and locally manufactured technologies. 
4) Energy services. Establish a policy to encour-
age private sector involvement in energy con-
servation and supply. 
5) Access to CFC substitutes. Initiate a pro-
gramme to promote C F C substitutes as well 
as provide assistance to developing countries 
in the acquisition and manufacture of the 
substitutes. 
6) Extension 
services. Organize a network of 
extension services to provide assistance to 
government agencies, communities, and the 
private sector in designing and implementing 
mitigation and adaptation projects. 
7) Forestation/Afforestation 
programme. 
New 
or expanded reforestation or forestation pro-
grammes could be linked to offset pro-
grammes for fossil-fuel-fired power plants, 
biomass energy projects, or a timber prod-
ucts industry as a means of obtaining financ-
ing and management for the programme. The 
social and economic incentives needed to en-
Technology 
Development 
and 
Transfer 
227 
courage long-term planting and maintenance 
should be identified. 
8) Technology 
advisory 
committees. 
Establish 
technology advisory committees comprising 
representatives from government and busi-
ness to recommend approaches for increasing 
export, joint venture, and other business op-
portunities related to global climate change 
limitation and adaptation efforts and to ad-
vise governments on ways to increase access 
to and encourage the development of com-
mercial sources of new technologies. 
9) Technology research and development. 
Pro-
mote research and development on technolo-
gies to: (1) monitor and detect climate 
change; (2) limit or adapt to climate change; 
and (3) predict regional and local change and 
to assess possible effects. 
10) Technology 
conferences. 
Conduct confer-
ences to transfer existing technologies to: 
(1) monitor and detect climate change; (2) 
limit or adapt to climate change; and (3) pre-
dict regional and local changes and to assess 
possible effects. 
11) Pilot 
transfer programmes. 
Conduct pilot 
programmes to transfer technologies in se-
lected countries and sectors. 
12) International 
guidelines for technology trans-
fer. 
Introduce international guidelines for 
technology transfer. 
13) International 
clearinghouse. 
Establish 
a 
clearinghouse to match needs with the skills 
and technology. 
14) An 
inventory 
of 
research 
organizations. 
Compile an inventory of research organiza-
tions. 
15) Training 
and education programme. 
Orga-
nize a programme for training and education 
of personnel to develop and use new technol-
ogies.

E X E C U T I V E S U M M A R Y 
This paper provides a preliminary assessment of 
the applicability of economic instruments to limit 
emissions of greenhouse gases, encourage sinks 
and 
facilitate 
adaptation 
to 
climate 
change. 
The 
instruments 
examined 
include 
emissions 
charges, tradeable emission permits, subsidies, and 
sanctions. 
The paper provides a "top-down" assessment of 
these measures, which, in conjunction with the 
more detailed work of the RSWG Subgroups, will 
comprise a set of ideas helpful to countries in pre-
paring and assessing possible means to address cli-
mate change. 
These measures have the potential to provide the 
signals necessary for the more environmentally sen-
sitive operation of markets. 
It is considered that economic instruments offer 
the possibility of achieving environmental improve-
ments at lower cost than regulatory instruments. 
However, it is unlikely that economic instruments 
will be applicable to all circumstances. Some combi-
nation of economic and regulatory measures will 
most likely be appropriate. The provision of infor-
mation and technical assistance are also seen as valu-
able complementary instruments. 
Three factors are considered as potential barriers 
to the operation of markets and/or the achievement 
of environmental objectives through market mecha-
nisms. These are: information problems, 
which can 
often cause markets to produce less effective or un-
favorable environmental outcomes; existing mea-
sures and institutions, 
which can encourage people 
to act in environmentally damaging ways; and bal-
ancing competing social, environmental, and eco-
nomic objectives. 
Initial response strategies may 
therefore be to address information problems di-
rectly and to review existing measures which may be 
barriers. 
A number of evaluation criteria exist for assess-
ment of instruments that might be adopted at the 
national and international levels. At the national 
level, these criteria relate to the need for the mea-
sures to: be compatible with sustainable economic 
development; be cost effective; comprehensively 
consider all significant sources and sinks; be com-
patible with international trade rules; be capable of 
amendment in light of new information; not hinder 
operation of other measures; be administratively 
practical overall; and consider distributional and 
information issues. 
Most of these criteria obviously also apply at the 
international level, where there is also a need for the 
measures to: be compatible with and support prin-
ciples of international technology transfer and fi-
nancial support discussed in other topic papers; take 
into account the special needs of the developing 
countries; recognize global climate objectives; and 
recognize acceptable inter-country arrangements 
that maintain an overall greenhouse contribution 
within the sum of their individual obligations. 
A general advantage of market based economic 
instruments 
is that they encourage limitations or 
reductions in emissions by those who can achieve 
them at least cost. They also provide an ongoing 
incentive for industry and individual consumers to 
apply the most efficient limitation/reduction mea-
sures through, for example, more efficient and 
cleaner technologies. Such incentives may be lack-
ing in the case of regulations. 
Regulations, 
however, are the customary means 
of controlling pollution in both market and cen-
trally planned economies. A major advantage of 
233 
234 
I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
regulations is that they create certainty as to desired 
outcomes, whereas major disadvantages are that 
they may fail to encourage innovation, introduce 
inflexibilities in meeting objectives, and offer few 
incentives to reduce emissions below specified 
levels. 
Tradeable emission permits are based on the con-
cept that emission entitlements or rights to pollute 
are provided to emitting sources, subject to an over-
all limit on total emissions, and allow the permit 
holders to trade or sell their entitlements to another 
party on the open market. 
While there are potential benefits of national or 
international tradeable emission permit systems, 
particularly their economic efficiency and cost ef-
fectiveness, many contributors had difficulty with 
the creation of "rights to pollute" and the adminis-
trative and monitoring requirements. A number of 
issues need further examination, such as: the politi-
cal problem created by a "right to pollute"; the 
criteria used to determine the initial allocation of 
emission entitlements; the special situation of devel-
oping countries; the potential scope and size of a 
trading market; and the feasibility of the adminis-
trative structure that would be required to imple-
ment such a programme. 
Emission charges provide a means of encouraging 
the limitation or reduction of emissions to a socially 
desirable level. They also provide an ongoing incen-
tive for efficient means of limiting or reducing emis-
sions and they could provide a funding base for 
further pollution abatement, research, and adminis-
tration. However, with such measures, it may be 
difficult to assess the optimal rate of taxation and 
detailed (and possibly expensive) knowledge is re-
quired about likely market reactions to different tax 
levels. The basis for the tax and means of collection 
also need to be considered. 
Domestic use of subsidies (e.g., direct grants, low 
interest rate financing, loan guarantees, tax defer-
rals, tax credits) is another possible economic in-
strument. While external public benefits can justify 
the use of such subsidies, difficulties such as their 
expense, need for careful design, need for review, 
and international trade aspects, mean that subsidies 
need to be considered with great care. They may 
also create disincentives for further innovation and 
development of appropriate technologies. 
Trade or financial sanctions established under an 
international convention would need to be consis-
tent with existing trade agreements and many con-
tributors expressed considerable reservations about 
applying them in a complex situation such as green-
house gases where monitoring diverse sources 
would be difficult. 
The above instruments raise a number of complex 
practical problems, particularly in relation to their 
implementation, and it is evident that further work 
is required in all countries, and in ongoing IPCC 
work, to fully evaluate the practicality of such mea-
sures and costs and benefits associated with differ-
ent mechanisms. It is appreciated that each instru-
ment assessed has a role in meeting greenhouse 
emission objectives, but the suitability of particular 
instruments is dependent on the particular circum-
stances and at this stage no measure is considered 
universally superior to all other available mecha-
nisms.

TO C L I M A T E C H A N G E 
9.1 
I N T R O D U C T I O N 
Over the last few decades there has been an in-
creased concentration of greenhouse gases in the 
atmosphere. It is clear that this trend will continue 
in the years to come unless something is done. 
While considerable uncertainty surrounds the ef-
fect of greenhouse gas emissions, this uncertainty 
does not justify a lack of action. It is prudent to take 
reasonable steps at this stage to avoid the risk of 
catastrophic consequences as a result of changes to 
the world climate in the future. 
This paper provides a preliminary assessment of 
the applicability of economic instruments to the 
problem of climate change. The instruments are 
examined both in terms of their ability to limit net 
emissions of greenhouse gases and their usefulness 
in facilitating adaptation to climate change. The fol-
lowing economic mechanisms are examined (both 
in national and international variants): emissions 
charges, tradeable emission permits, subsidies, and 
sanctions. 
The paper provides a "top-down" assessment of 
these economic measures. It is hoped that this, in 
addition to the more detailed ("bottom-up") work 
of the RSWG Subgroups, will comprise a set of 
ideas helpful to countries in preparing and assessing 
possible means to meet national goals and interna-
tional commitments relating to climate change. 
The analysis is conducted very much at a prelimi-
nary level. The paper aims to do no more than 
provide the basis for the further, more detailed 
work that remains to be done. This should be car-
ried forward in the light of further work being un-
dertaken in the context of RSWG and the product 
from the other Working Groups of IPCC and other 
organizations and individuals currently examining 
these issues. 
The ideas in this document do not necessarily 
represent the official views of contributing coun-
tries or organizations. 
9.2 
O V E R V I E W 
While markets will of themselves adjust to take ac-
count of the impacts of climate change (for example, 
through consumer support of environmentally 
sound goods) this adjustment will not sufficiently 
address the problems of climate change and careful 
intervention by national governments is required. 
These interventions should aim to overcome exist-
ing social, institutional or other barriers to the 
maintenance of environmental quality and provide 
the signals necessary for the more environmentally 
sensitive operation of markets. 
Economic instruments, through their encourage-
ment of flexible selection of abatement measures, 
may offer the possibility of achieving environmen-
tal improvements at lower cost than regulatory in-
struments. They also offer the opportunity for 
countries to introduce limitation/reduction and ad-
aptation measures while more detailed regulatory or 
other measures are being formulated and imple-
mented. However, it is unlikely that, in the final 
235 
236 
IPCC RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
analysis, economic instruments will be applicable to 
all circumstances. Some combination of economic 
and regulatory measures will most likely be appro-
priate. Provision of information and technical assis-
tance are seen as a valuable complementary instru-
ment. 
Experience to date, in addressing issues relating 
to reduction in C F C production and emissions in 
the context of the Montreal Protocol, suggests that 
solutions at the national level will need to draw 
heavily on the widest variety of economic, regula-
tory, and other response measures. Differing com-
binations of instruments are likely to be used by 
individual countries in order to best meet national 
goals and international commitments. 
Most contributors saw market-based instruments 
(as well as planning mechanisms 
in centrally 
planned economies) as having a role in achieving 
objectives for limiting or reducing emissions of 
greenhouse gases, rather than in determining what 
the optimal level of emissions ought to be. A l -
though it was recognized that the purpose of policy 
measures is to enhance overall welfare, this requires 
a balancing of the costs of climate change with the 
costs of policy measures implemented to reach 
emission reduction targets. Whether or not a strict 
cost/benefit approach is applied, it seems clear that 
all costs must be taken into account in setting policy 
objectives and determining the mix of options for 
implementation. 
Finally, the nature of the greenhouse issue high-
lights the importance of genuine cooperation by 
sovereign countries in implementing national pro-
grammes of economic and other measures. This will 
be as important as bilateral, regional, and interna-
tional activities enforced through conventions and 
protocols. Clearly, the two approaches would need 
to complement each other. 
9.3 
K E Y 
C O N S I D E R A T I O N S 
Market-based measures could effectively and effi-
ciently help to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases 
by operating through environmentally adjusted 
market forces. These should be framed to reflect 
fully the social costs of environmental resource use 
in light of available scientific knowledge. This is 
consistent with the principle of sustainable develop-
ment. 
Three factors were identified as potential barriers 
to the operation of markets and/or the achievement 
of environmental objectives through market mecha-
nisms. 
1) Information problems. 
2) Counterproductive operation of existing mea-
sures and institutions. 
3) Other competing objectives. 
A n understanding of these considerations is neces-
sary in assessing the likely success of a response 
strategy that utilizes market mechanisms. 
9.3.1 
INFORMATION 
Problems of information can often be the cause of 
markets producing less effective or even unfavor-
able environmental outcomes. 
These problems 
should be borne in mind in the development of 
economic instruments. 
There are three types of information problems. 
1) The information does not exist. 
2) The information is not disseminated. 
3) The decision makers (government, industry, 
or individual consumers) do not have the abil-
ity or the means to use the information. 
If information problems are the cause of economic 
activity producing unsatisfactory 
environmental 
outcomes, it would be appropriate for the policy 
response to target directly the information prob-
lems. This might be through a public education 
campaign. This is further referred to in the IPCC 
topic paper on public education and information 
measures. Better protection of intellectual property 
so as to encourage research into pollution abate-
ment technology, or other appropriate policy re-
sponses, may also be required. This is discussed in 
more detail in the IPCC topic paper on technology 
development and transfer measures. 
It should also be noted that the different types of 
economic instruments have different information 
requirements. The choice of instrument should 
have regard to the type of information available.

9.3.2 
EXISTING MEASURES A N D 
INSTITUTIONS 
Environmental problems can often be attributed to 
existing measures and institutions that encourage 
people to act in a way that is not consistent with the 
preservation of environmental quality. Some of 
these measures and institutions were adopted with-
out consideration of their contribution to increased 
emissions of greenhouse gases. Countries should be 
encouraged to reassess these measures (with, of 
course, due consideration to other economic and 
social objectives). 
Where counterproductive measures (including 
subsidies, 
sanctions, 
regulations, and technical 
standards) are the problem, it will be appropriate 
for 
the policy response to be directed at re-
examining them so that they will be conducive to 
the production of environmentally acceptable out-
comes. Removal of these distortions could also pro-
vide immediate direct benefits through improved 
economic efficiency in addition to reducing the risk 
of climate change. 
Governments also have the potential to contrib-
ute to the control of greenhouse gas emissions by 
attending to their public sectors. Options include: 
improving the practices of state-owned enterprises, 
and the environmentally and economically sound 
management of public lands. 
9.3.3 
O T H E R COMPETING OBJECTIVES 
There will always be competition among different 
social, environmental, and economic objectives. In-
evitably, this will affect the use of economic mea-
sures to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
In a world of limited resources, resources must be 
allocated between competing objectives and social 
welfare will not be maximized by pursuing any ob-
jective to the exclusion of others. It is recognized 
that, in balancing competing objectives, there will 
be trade-offs and total elimination of all environ-
mental problems is unlikely to be achieved. Of 
course, decision makers and the public have a need 
to know the extent of environmental damage and 
what trade-offs would be involved in achieving en-
vironmental objectives at the expense of other ob-
jectives, such as economic growth. This should 
form the basis for any effective and responsible ac-
tion to protect the environment. However, this is 
not to say that action on major environmental issues 
should always be delayed because insufficient infor-
mation is available.

E V A L U A T I O N 
C R I T E R I A 
The economic instruments addressed in this docu-
ment may be considered as options for any national 
programme established to respond to the problem 
of climate change or as options for an international 
institutional structure. Since the form of the instru-
ment may vary according to different circum-
stances, it is useful to distinguish criteria for the 
assessment of instruments or policy measures 
adopted at the national level from those relevant to 
an assessment of international instruments or policy 
measures. 
The following criteria can be used in the evalua-
tion of a national policy measure applicable to in-
dustry as well as individuals: 
1) The measure should be compatible with prin-
ciples of sustainable economic development. 
2) The measure should be cost effective in limit-
ing specified emissions in accordance with na-
tional goals or any international agreements 
and balanced so as to optimize the net social 
benefits from the use of resources in pursuit of 
competing social, environmental, and eco-
nomic goals. 
3) The measure should be comprehensive in 
terms of taking into account all significant 
sources and sinks of the specified emissions. 
4) The measure should seek to distribute costs 
toward sources of the specified emissions and 
to ensure there are no unnecessary cost bur-
dens on the encouragement of sinks. 
5) The measure must be compatible with interna-
tional trade rules and principles and should 
seek to avoid distortions or restrictions to 
trade. 
238 
I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
6) The measure should be able to be amended or 
adjusted efficiently and in a predictable man-
ner in response to new information in the 
fields of science, impacts, technology, and 
economics, and any international obligations 
that might emerge. 
7) The measure should not hinder the operation 
of other measures (particularly technology de-
velopment and information exchange) that fa-
cilitate the achievement 
of objectives 
in 
relation to specified emissions. 
8) Accurate and reliable information must be 
available at a national level about sources and 
sinks of specified emissions. 
9) The measure must be administratively practi-
cal and effective in terms of application, mon-
itoring and enforcement. 
The following criteria should be applicable to any 
international 
institutional measure incorporated 
into any convention or protocols: 
1) The international policy regime should be 
compatible with principles of sustainable 
economic development. 
2) The international measure should be cost ef-
fective (i.e., designed to achieve the pollution 
control goals of any agreement at the lowest 
economic and social cost). 
3) The measure should be comprehensive in 
terms of taking into account all significant 
sources and sinks of the specified emissions. 
4) The international measure should take ap-
propriate advantage of economic measures as 
well as regulatory measures to encourage uti-
lization of alternative, less polluting technol-
ogies and sinks. 
5) It should be able to be amended or adjusted, 
in a predictable manner, in response to new 
information and any assessments of science, 
impacts, technology, and economics. 
6) The international measure should be equita-
ble in terms of distribution of costs and 
obligations 
across national, 
intergenera-
tional, and income class categories and in 
terms of access to decision-making pro-
cesses. The implementation of such measures 
should take into account the circumstances 
that most emissions affecting the atmosphere 
at present originate in industrialized coun-
tries where the scope for change is greatest 
and that under present conditions emissions 
from developing countries are growing and 
may need to grow in order to meet their 
development requirements and thus, over 
time, are likely to represent an increasingly 
significant percentage of global emissions. 
7) It should respect established international 
trade rules, with the aim of not distorting or 
restricting world trade. 
8) The international policy measure should be 
administratively practical and effective in 
terms of application, monitoring, and en-
forcement. 
9) The measure should be compatible with sup-
port principles of international technology 
transfer and financial support discussed in 
other topic papers. 
10) The measure should take into account the 
special needs of the developing countries. 
11) The international policy regime should rec-
ognize that the interests of the international 
community relate to global climate objec-
tives, not the means by which they are 
achieved. 
12) The international measure should recognize 
any arrangements between individual coun-
tries that maintain an overall greenhouse 
contribution within the sum of their individ-
ual obligations as an acceptable compliance 
strategy. 
Some contributors thought that further investiga-
tion dealing with economic responses to climate 
change could build on the above. This would pre-
sent a strategy to deal with conflicting or controver-
sial criteria and guide resolution of most potential 
conflicts.

PREAMBLE 
Economic instruments offer the possibility of mini-
mizing the total social costs of achieving national 
goals and international commitments relating to cli-
mate change. They seek to meet 
limitation/ 
reduction or adaptation objectives by adjusting or 
harnessing market forces so that they take account 
of environmental costs. 
However, the use of economic instruments raises 
moral concerns in the minds of some contributors 
relating to the fact that some of the economic instru-
ments imply "paying for the right to pollute" and 
that economic instruments introduce a profit mo-
tive element into the achievement of public goals of 
environmental protection. Others have responded 
that regulations allow for the same rights to pollute, 
the only difference being in the transferability of the 
right, and that regulation does not banish the profit 
motive, since profit opportunities in regulatory sys-
tems are often directly dependent on securing favor-
able regulatory treatment. Indeed, the misuse of 
resources in lobbying for favorable regulatory treat-
ment represents a considerable drawback of the reg-
ulatory approach. 
Section 9.5.2, below, looks at measures that 
might be used in centrally planned economies to 
reduce emissions and then examines the role of reg-
ulations in market economies. 
Sections 9.5.3-9.5.6 examine the following eco-
nomic instruments that might be considered as al-
ternatives or supplements to the regulations. The 
instruments examined are: 
9.5.3 Tradeable emission permits 
9.5.4 Emissions charges 
9.5.5 Subsidies 
9.5.6 Sanctions 
It will be up to each country to select the mix of 
measures most appropriate to their particular cir-
cumstances in light of the suggested criteria for eval-
uating measures outlined in Section 9.4 and any 
steps (such as international consultation) necessary 
to avoid negative impacts on world trade. More 
work is required to identify the circumstances un-
der which each measure is most appropriate. 
9.5.2 
REGULATIONS 
9.5.2.1 Regulations in Centrally Planned 
Economies 
Because of the differences between the social and 
economic structures in different countries, different 
combinations of instruments or at least different 
emphases in their use will be required. In the partic-
ular case of centrally planned economies, the central 
plan encompasses a comprehensive set of regula-
tions and is the major instrument for achieving sus-
tainable limitations or reductions in emissions. 
Central planning provides possibilities for the 
government to coordinate and direct all efforts to 
limit or reduce emissions. Possibilities include: 
planning emissions reductions/limitations by those 
enterprises that can achieve them best at least cost so 
as to minimize the financial burden to society as a 
whole; provision of loans on favorable terms for 
environmentally sound investments; and alterations 
in price regulations to enhance the introduction of 
new environmentally acceptable technologies and 
activities. 
9.5.2.2 Regulations in Market Economies 
Governments in market economies also have the 
option to impose direct controls to limit or reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions. Regulatory controls typ-
ically seek to prescribe acceptable standards or to 
restrict or limit certain activities. They normally do 
not seek to influence market behavior through price 
signals. Such controls have been the customary 
means of controlling pollution. Examples include 
emission controls for motor vehicles or the installa-
tion of scrubbers on power plants. 
Direct controls have the advantage of creating 
certainty as to the desired actions and outcomes. 
They may also be useful where it may not be possi-
ble to frame appropriate market measures. Their 
implementation, however, may: 
• fail to encourage innovation, as there may be no 
incentive to further limit or reduce emissions; 
• introduce inflexibilities in meeting emission ob-
240 
I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
jectives, thereby imposing unnecessary eco-
nomic costs; and 
• require significant monitoring and/or adminis-
tration to ensure that the desired outcomes are 
achieved (although the same may be true for 
market measures). 
Some contributors thought that regulations were 
one area where there is extensive experience with 
controlling pollution. Further work on determining 
the potential for increased use of environmental reg-
ulations and analysis of their advantages and disad-
vantages, including areas where regulation might be 
more effective than economic measures, could be 
of use. 
9.5.3 
A SYSTEM OF TRADEABLE EMISSION 
PERMITS 
9.5.3.1 Method of Operation 
An emission permit system is based on the concept 
that emission entitlements (like coupons) or rights 
to pollute are provided to emitting sources (which 
can be as large as countries), subject to an overall 
limit on total emissions. The sum of entitlements is 
equal to an emissions budget set at the national level 
through regulation or at the international level 
through international agreements. A "tradeable" 
emission permit system extends the emission permit 
system by allowing the permit holders to trade or 
sell their entitlements to another party on the open 
market. It is supplementary to a regulatory pro-
gramme in that it operates within overall limits on 
emissions of the greenhouse gas. 
There has been to date only limited experience 
with tradeable emission permits at the national 
level, and no experience at the international level. 
One example that has been implemented in the 
United States is its programme to phase down the 
use of lead in gasoline. Under this programme, the 
United States government set a target for the usage 
of lead in gasoline through a regulatory process and 
used a trading system that allowed gasoline refiners 
to allocate the lead budget in an economically effi-
cient manner. Although this can be viewed as recog-
nizing a "right to pollute," it is only a right to 
pollute up to a level determined to be environmen-
tally acceptable by the U.S. government. 
Many options exist for determining the initial 
allocation of entitlements under a tradeable emis-
sion permit system. For example, at the national 
level, entitlements could be allocated to existing 
producers in proportion to their existing emission 
level or they could be auctioned to the highest bid-
der or sold by tender. 
At the international level, a tradeable emission 
permit system could be based on the same concepts 
as those described above. As a first step, an overall 
emission budget could be set. Global emission bud-
gets and initial emission entitlements for each coun-
try could be determined in a number of possible 
ways: the entitlements could be allocated by the 
level of emissions in a base year, by population size 
of a country, by a target unit of emissions per unit of 
G N P , by a target unit of fossil fuel use per unit of 
population or G N P , etc. 
Once the initial entitlements to each country have 
been determined, countries would of course have to 
allocate their overall budget to the sources in their 
country. This allocation procedure could follow 
whatever lines are deemed most appropriate, given 
their social and economic needs. However, at the 
international level, a tradeable permit system might 
operate like international share, currency, or com-
modity markets. Governments or individual enti-
tlement holders could be free to buy or sell, brokers 
could operate, and the spot price of an entitlement 
would float to a current market valuation of a mar-
ginal unit of emissions. Making the market freely 
accessible and issuing entitlements in small divisible 
units should go a considerable distance in prevent-
ing any nation or firm from cornering the market. 
At either the national or international level, a 
further variation of this system is to allow emission 
entitlements to be granted for the creation of sinks. 
A n international policy regime that focuses on 
global climate objectives, rather than the means by 
which they are achieved, would treat sink creation 
and emissions reduction as one-for-one substitutes. 
9.5.3.2 Benefits and Difficulties of a National 
Tradeable Permit Programme 
The following potential benefits have been sug-
gested: 
• it reduces the cost of meeting a total emission 
target set by regulation; 
Economic 
(Market) 
Measures 
241 
• it provides economic incentives to develop and 
use cost-effective, 
energy-efficient industrial 
processes, consumer products, and emission 
control technologies; 
• it works within a system of agreed emission 
budgets; 
• it provides an efficient mechanism for address-
ing the trade-offs between sources and sinks for 
the specified emissions; and 
• it provides the opportunity for low-income 
rights holders to sell rights to others in ex-
change for compensation of greater value. 
The following potential difficulties have been 
suggested: 
• it creates a "right to pollute" that can be pur-
chased by those with the highest level of in-
come; 
• it may not be politically acceptable in many 
countries; 
• it requires administrative structures that gener-
ally do not exist today; and 
• it requires extensive monitoring and record-
keeping to track the movement of entitlements 
and overall compliance with the total emissions 
budget. 
9.5.3.3 Benefits and Difficulties of an 
International Tradeable Permit 
Programme 
Generally an international programme will carry 
with it the same benefits and difficulties as a national 
programme. The potential cost savings may be 
higher but the level of the administrative and en-
forcement complexity could be even more severe. 
An international body of some kind would be re-
quired to identify whether the allowable limit of 
pollution was being exceeded. In addition, political 
concerns about the "right to pollute" and the ability 
of wealthy nations to procure those rights would be 
greater. Also, there is a lack of experience of these 
programmes at the international level. 
Issues Needing Further Examination 
Major concerns were expressed by contributors 
over the use of tradeable emission permits, some 
thinking that an international system of tradeable 
permits was not advisable. While it was agreed that 
studies of tradeable permits should continue, these 
countries asked that their major misgivings should 
be taken into consideration. 
There are a number of other issues associated 
with a tradeable emission permit programme that 
need further exploration, including: the political 
problem created by a "right to pollute"; the criteria 
used to determine the initial allocation of emission 
entitlements; the special situation of developing 
countries; the potential scope and size of a trading 
market; and the feasibility of the administrative 
structure that would be required to implement such 
a programme, including the conditions necessary 
for them to be feasible, such as identifiable emission 
point sources, standard metering practices, avail-
ability of comprehensive and up-to-date informa-
tion on options, and a market in which to trade 
permits. 
The contribution from the Environmental De-
fense Fund discussed in some detail the practical 
arrangements that might be adopted in the imple-
mentation of a system of tradeable emission rights, 
both at a national level and internationally. This and 
other such work should be consulted in the further 
development of proposals that might utilize this 
instrument. 
Some contributors thought that an alternative ap-
proach to a system of emission charges would be to 
have the polluter pay by conducting research de-
signed to reduce emissions—e.g., through an ap-
propriate tax credit system. 
9.5.4 
A SYSTEM OF EMISSION CHARGES 
Emission charges are levies imposed in relation to 
the level of emissions. They provide a means of 
encouraging the limitation or reduction of emis-
sions to a level that is socially desirable. They also 
provide an ongoing incentive for the parties con-
cerned to implement efficient means of limiting or 
reducing emissions by, for example, implementing 
energy efficiency measures. For governments, ma-
jor attractions of taxes may be the revenue they 
generate. This revenue could provide a funding base 
for further pollution abatement, research, and ad-
ministration. It could also enable other taxes to be 
lowered, budget deficits to be reduced or govern-
ment expenditures to be increased in other fields. 
A carbon tax on burning fossil fuels is one exam-
242 
I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
pie of an emission charge. Emissions of carbon di-
oxide are a major contributor to the greenhouse 
effect and most of the carbon dioxide comes from 
the burning of fossil fuels. 
A tax on fossil fuels, levied in relation to its car-
bon content although not a direct tax on emissions, 
could in some circumstances reduce emissions of 
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. For the tax to 
be effective and efficient, its level should not be 
influenced by the funding requirements of other 
programmes; its level should be the same across all 
countries; and it should apply uniformly to all 
forms of fossil fuels. It would also be necessary to 
take account of emissions of other greenhouse gases 
over the full fuel cycle. 
The view was expressed that an "energy tax" that 
does not vary with carbon content could also be 
employed to encourage overall energy efficiency. 
Such a tax would not necessarily lead to fuel switch-
ing and its revenues could also be used to fund 
programmes for promoting environmentally favor-
able energy technologies. 
Recent work by the O E C D has shown that the 
use of taxes to fight pollution has been growing in 
popularity amongst O E C D countries, although the 
experience to date shows that the primary function 
of pollution taxes (which in the climate change con-
text can be emission taxes) has been to raise the 
revenue required for pollution management. The 
taxes have not generally been set high enough to 
influence the behavior of polluters. 
There are some problems associated with the use 
of emissions charges. These will require careful con-
sideration in the development of response strategies 
that might make use of this option. 
First, it is difficult to assess the optimal rate at 
which the tax should be applied in order to meet 
national goals, where these can be defined in terms 
of technical levels of emissions. Unlike regulations 
or the system of tradeable emission rights, the level 
of emissions is not set directly but attained through 
the market responding to the taxes. In order for 
national goals to be attained, some quite detailed 
knowledge is required about how the market is 
likely to react to different taxation levels. This in-
formation could be difficult and expensive to ac-
quire. The cost-effectiveness 
studies currently 
being prepared by the RSWG Energy and Industry 
Subgroup may help with information on this 
matter. 
Second, there is the difficulty of deciding on the 
basis for the taxes and how they would be collected. 
(This criticism also applies to a number of other 
economic and regulatory instruments.) 
The implementation of a coherent emission tax 
regime at the international level poses further prac-
tical difficulties. In particular, factors such as vary-
ing local price elasticities and tax structures, ex-
change rate fluctuations, etc., mean that it would be 
extremely difficult to derive with any confidence a 
uniform tax that would lead to the required limita-
tion or reduction in emissions, where there is suffi-
cient technical knowledge to enable an emission 
level to be specified. 
A reasonable and practical option would be to 
give each country flexibility to set its own national 
charge rates at a level that would achieve its national 
goals. However, some contributors felt that an in-
ternational levy system should not be discarded 
from consideration in this context. 
It is evident that the question of emission charges 
raises many complex and difficult issues. Careful 
and substantive analysis of the short and long run 
environmental and economic impacts of such mea-
sures is needed. 
9.5.5 
SUBSIDIES 
The use of subsidies to limit or reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions by developing countries is discussed 
in the topic paper on financial mechanisms. This 
section looks at the domestic use of subsidies. 
Subsidies and government financial assistance 
(hereinafter referred to as "subsidies") are aimed at 
assisting environmentally sound goods and actions 
by lowering their costs. Various forms of subsidies 
have been used, among other things, to encourage 
the use of energy efficient equipment and to encour-
age the use of non-fossil energy sources. These in-
clude direct grants, low interest rate financing, loan 
guarantees, tax deferrals (e.g., accelerated deprecia-
tion), tax credits, etc. 
Because of the external public benefits of devel-
oping environmentally sound technologies, sub-
sidies could be used to encourage the development 
and greater use of such technologies. 
A number of difficulties are associated with the 
use of subsidies. 
Economic 
(Market) 
Measures 
243 
• In general, subsidizing environmentally sound 
activities tends to be less efficient than applying 
charges or fees directed toward the emissions 
that are to be reduced. 
• It is difficult to assess the optimal rate of subsi-
dization. 
• They can be expensive. 
• More important, unless carefully designed, 
they could fail to be effective. For example, a 
subsidy on competing energy sources would 
not only encourage a move to alternative fuels, 
but could also encourage a net increase in en-
ergy consumption and C 0 2 emissions, unless 
accompanied by economic or regulatory mea-
sures. 
• Overly generous subsidies or their continual 
use without review can act as a disincentive for 
investigation and research 
into alternative 
means of meeting the same objective and thus 
act to lock pollution abatement into outdated or 
inefficient technology. 
• Unqualified use of subsidies could hinder the 
full direction of costs to sources of the specified 
emissions, and might cause trade distortions. 
• Although some food and agricultural subsidies 
may lead to some greenhouse gas emissions 
(e.g., methane) and their removal would result 
in overall social benefit, this can also produce 
significant local or regional social costs which 
need to be considered. 
The question of subsidies may prove to be contro-
versial from the point of view of international trade. 
Environmental subsidies have been the subject of 
some discussion by members of G A T T but there 
has been no agreement as to what differentiates an 
environmental subsidy from other subsidies. 
9.5.6 
SANCTIONS 
A final type of economic instrument is the use of 
economic sanctions for the enforcement of interna-
tional agreements. This would require an interna-
tional convention to establish a system of agreed 
trade or financial sanctions to be imposed on coun-
tries that did not adhere to agreed targets. The aim 
here would be to discourage non-complying coun-
tries from deriving benefits without taking action. 
Discussion of trade sanctions has already taken 
place under the Montreal Protocol in relation to 
products containing CFCs and halons. Sanctions 
might range from the imposition of import taxes on 
the offending products to outright bans until the 
exporter conforms with agreed international stan-
dards. The mechanisms for operating such a system 
would need to be made consistent with existing 
trade agreements such as G A T T . 
However, many contributors expressed consid-
erable reservations about applying this measure to 
greenhouse gases other than CFCs and halons be-
cause of the complexity of the situation. In particu-
lar, it would be difficult to monitor the many 
diverse sources of greenhouse gases. Moreover, it 
was felt that sanctions could appear arbitrary, since 
it could be difficult to determine accurately whether 
particular countries exceeded internationally agreed 
levels or not. This could create confusion and re-
sentment as to why they were subject to the sanc-
tions. Some contributors objected to the concept of 
sanctions because of the risk that they could be used 
as a pretext to impose new non-tariff barriers on the 
exports by developing countries. 
9.6 
C O N C L U S I O N S 
The following are the significant conclusions of the 
country contributions and the subsequent discus-
sions at WGIII meetings. 
1) Economic instruments offer the potential to 
achieve national goals and international com-
mitments for limitation/reduction of green-
house gases and adaptation to climate change, 
at minimum social cost. 
2) The type of instrument chosen will depend to 
a great extent on the context in which it is to be 
applied, the economy of the country con-
cerned, and the type of greenhouse gas to be 
controlled. It is likely that the instruments 
chosen would include a combination of regu-
lations, economic signals, and economic in-
struments, plus the provision of information 
and technical assistance to improve the opera-

10.1.1 
The financial approach presented in this 
document is based on discussions within the Inter-
governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 
Response Strategies Working Group (RSWG). A 
workshop on "Implementation Measures" includ-
ing "Financial Measures" was held in Geneva, Oc-
tober 2-6, 1989. Prior to that workshop, views on 
this topic were submitted by Australia, Canada, 
France, India, Japan, Malta, the Netherlands, New 
Zealand, Norway, and the United Kingdom. Views 
were also submitted 
by the following Non-
governmental Organizations (NGOs): the Natural 
Resources Defense Council ( N R D C ) of the United 
States, and the Stockholm Environment Institute 
(SEI) of Sweden. Since then, additional contribu-
tions on the topic were sent to the coordinators by 
Canada, Japan, Norway, Switzerland, and the 
United Kingdom, as well as by N R D C . The docu-
ment is intended to reflect a wide variety of ideas 
and opinions and should lead to effective action to 
tackle the problem of global climate change. 
10.1.2 
Scientific analysis on the issue is not yet 
finalized. The nature and the scale of the economic 
and technical measures which are needed will deter-
mine the scope and conception of finance. Response 
measures will, in part, be determined as a result of 
ongoing deliberations within the IPCC. The finan-
cial options listed here are discussed with a view to 
defining a sufficiently broad, flexible, and coopera-
tive framework for action. 
10.1.3 
Although the scope of the discussed mech-
anisms is not limited to developing countries, this 
paper pays special attention to the mechanisms that 
should help countries where the protection of the 
atmosphere would entail a special or abnormal bur-
den, in particular due to their level of development 
or their effective responsibility in the deterioration 
of the atmosphere. 
10.1.4 
The objective is to encourage adoption by 
industrialized and developing countries alike, of 
strategies to adapt their economy to control, limit, 
or reduce greenhouse gas emissions and at the same 
time increase the capacity of the natural environ-
ment to absorb these gases. 
10.2 
G E N E R A L 
C O N S I D E R A T I O N S 
10.2.1 
The following considerations require spe-
cial attention. The first tangible results in limiting 
climate change by these actions will not appear for 
some time. We are thus engaged in a long-term 
process. 
10.2.2 
Environmental problems caused by global 
warming can often not be disassociated from other 
environmental problems or from other develop-
ment factors. This interdependence of environment 
and development must be recognized and taken into 
account in the actions of the international commu-
nity. 
10.2.3 
The programmes to be undertaken will re-
quire actions in both industrialized and developing 
countries, under the following broad categories: 
limitation/reduction measures, adaptation 
mea-
sures, research and development, transfer of tech-
nologies, public awareness, and education.

I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
10.2.4 
The special needs of developing countries, 
including their vulnerability to problems posed by 
climate change and their lack of financial resources, 
must be recognized and cooperation and assistance 
tailored to meet their individual needs. Financing 
requirements might be considerable. 
Substantial 
economic gains, however, could be achieved, for 
example, through measures that result in energy 
conservation and efficiency. Economic and techno-
logical measures are described in more detail in a 
separate implementation paper. 
10.2.5 
The presence of a positive international 
economic environment, including further reduction 
of trade barriers, will also be important to support 
economic growth of developing countries, and to 
generate resources that can be applied toward press-
ing needs. 
10.2.6 
The scale and diversity of the environmen-
tal requirements in developing countries, together 
with their development problems, favor an ap-
proach that ensures mobilizing a wide variety of 
international organizations, possibly including new 
ones. It will also be important to ensure the full 
participation of existing regional organizations. 
10.2.7 
Priority should be given to those financial 
measures and policies that can have an early impact 
in limiting or reducing emissions of greenhouse 
gases and that make economic sense in their own 
right. 
10.3 
G U I D I N G P R I N C I P L E S F O R 
C O O P E R A T I O N 
10.3.1 
The following principles derived from, in-
ter alia, the U N G A Declaration 43/53 and the 
Noordwijk Declaration on Climate Change should 
guide the financial approach. They do not, of 
course, predetermine legal issues arising from a fu-
ture climate convention. These issues are discussed 
in a separate implementation paper as well. 
1) Industrialized and developing countries have a 
common responsibility and need to limit and/ 
or adapt to climate change. The interdepen-
dence of the causes of global warming and the 
interweaving of the necessary economic solu-
tions require a collaborative approach, with 
due respect to national sovereignty. This con-
cept is based upon the recognition that: 
2) The atmosphere and climate are vital to all 
human beings. 
3) It is important for every person and country to 
contribute to limiting climate change caused 
by human activities. 
4) In pursuing economic growth as a legitimate 
means of improving standards of living, coun-
tries need to integrate environmental consid-
erations with development policies in order to 
ensure sustainable development. 
5) The elements outlined above apply to indus-
trialized countries as well as to developing 
countries. A l l countries are likely to face in-
creased costs associated with preventive and 
adaptive measures necessary to address cli-
mate change. 
10.3.2 
Industrialized countries have specific re-
sponsibilities on two levels. 
1) Major part of emissions affecting the atmo-
sphere at present originate in industrialized 
countries where the scope for change is great-
est. They should therefore adopt domestic 
measures to limit climate change and take the 
lead in setting an example by adapting their 
own economies in line with future agreements 
to limit or reduce emissions. The field of ac-
tion involves faster suppression of the produc-
tion and consumption of chlorofluorocar-
bons, energy savings or recourse to non-fossil 
energy sources, a rational use of forestry re-
sources to commence active reforestation, 
limiting, or reducing C 0 2 emissions, etc. 
2) They should help developing countries partic-
ipate in international action without compro-
mising their development, by contributing 
additional financial resources, by appropriate 
Financial 
Mechanisms 
251 
transfer of technology, by engaging in close 
cooperation concerning scientific observa-
tion, by analysis and research, and finally by 
means of technical cooperation and assistance 
geared to forestalling and managing ecological 
problems. Additional resources should over 
time be mobilized to help developing coun-
tries take the necessary measures that are com-
patible with their development requirements, 
and thus compensate for the additional spe-
cific effort they would be ready to make. Fur-
thermore, 
they 
should 
show 
scientific 
leadership in addressing climate change issues 
including systematic observations, modeling, 
prediction, and assessment. 
10.3.3 
Emissions from developing countries are 
growing and may need to grow in order to meet 
their development requirements and thus, over 
time, are likely to represent an increasingly signifi-
cant percentage of global emissions. Developing 
countries should take measures to adapt their econ-
omies. They should undertake, according to their 
individual circumstances, to set out on a course to 
make a rational use of forestry resources to com-
mence active reforestation and to promote energy 
savings or recourse to non-fossil energy sources. 
International cooperation and urgency plead in fa-
vor of the adoption of such programs, which are 
likewise applicable in industrialized countries. The 
immediate development needs of developing coun-
tries would under present conditions require an in-
crease in their present level of C 0 2 emissions. The 
developing countries should attempt to minimize 
such increases in emissions. 
10.3.4 
Multilateral development banks, bilateral 
assistance programs, and United Nations develop-
ment and scientific and technological organizations 
should be used in their respective fields of compe-
tence. A number of delegations have observed that 
it is necessary that these institutions expand their 
fields of competence into new areas that are respon-
sive to environmental necessity. What is justified is 
a reinforcement of external support for revised in-
ternal priorities, policies, and measures, including 
internal resource allocation, which are in the coun-
try's own interest. In addition, regional coopera-
tion bodies should adopt the required initiatives and 
implement the appropriate solidarity action at their 
level. A concerted effort by all of the above-
mentioned institutions to formulate coordinated, 
integrated strategies that assure that all development 
assistance investments, whether undertaken with 
existing or additional funds, would further the goal 
of climate stability.

10.4.1 
The Working Group reached a general 
consensus on priority use for financial resources 
channeled to developing countries. It was accepted 
that some activities contributed both to limiting/ 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting 
economic development, and that early priority 
should be attached to these. 
10.4.2 
It was noted that some activities would 
require a much greater scale of resources than 
others, and that considerations of cost effectiveness 
should apply in deciding particular priorities. It was 
further noted that there was already a significant 
amount of activity being funded by existing assis-
tance organizations in some of the priority areas. 
10.4.3 
Among the highest priority areas for co-
operation and assistance are those enumerated 
below. 
1) Efficient use of energy, including appropriate 
use of technologies, increasing the use of non-
fossil fuels, and switching to fossil fuels with 
lower G H G emission rates. 
2) Forestry—to promote the rational manage-
ment of forest resources and reforestation. 
3) Agriculture—to limit or reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions from agricultural activities. 
4) Measures taken under the Montreal Protocol 
to help developing countries in the develop-
252 
I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
ment and introduction of alternatives to CFCs 
and halons. 
5) Cooperation with and assistance to develop-
ing countries for their full participation, as 
recommended by the Special Committee on 
the participation of developing countries in 
the meetings of the I P C C ; a simple system of 
mobilization and coordination (with a leading 
role for coordinating the participation of de-
veloping countries by the IPCC Secretariat) 
should be elaborated. 
6) Cooperation and assistance, including transfer 
of expertise such as that required to develop 
and operate forest management programs and 
large-scale reforestation programs, to help de-
veloping countries plan how to tackle prob-
lems posed by climate change, 
including 
cooperation and assistance in the design of 
policies and programmes. This holds for adap-
tation as well as for limitation/reduction-
oriented policy planning. It was noted that 
small investments in policy or programme de-
sign could yield large returns. 
7) Research and development programmes — 
including monitoring climate change and re-
search on technologies that might be used to 
reduce/limit emissions of greenhouse gases 
and develop adaptive strategies. 
8) Technology transfer arrangements, including 
the training of experts. 
9) Public awareness and education. 
10.4.4 
Some delegations also suggested that fi-
nancial resources might be used for the following 
purposes: 
1) Cooperation 
with 
developing 
countries, 
which in future abstain from activities that 
produce greenhouse gases. In this context, re-
gional banks, which have so far not been ac-
tively involved in the IPCC process, should 
play a coordinating role by introducing envi-
ronmentally sound criteria in their projects. 
Furthermore, cooperation with and assistance 
to developing countries to support their activ-
ities that reduce net emissions of greenhouse 
gases or that introduce alternative technolo-
gies (i.e., those that emit low levels or no 
greenhouse gases) should be considered. 
2) Assistance to developing countries in adjust-
ing to the problems presented by climate 
change. It was noted that there might be a 
parallel with support for current economic or 
structural adjustment programmes. 
3) Funding to support the developing countries 
in fulfilling their obligations under a climate 
convention, and subsequent related protocols, 
thereby ensuring widespread implementation 
of the required measures to limit, reduce, and, 
as far as possible, prevent climate change.

10.5.1 
The Working Group noted that the ques-
tion of ways by which financial resources could be 
generated to assist developing countries was sepa-
rate from the issue of how to channel those re-
sources. It was agreed that all avenues should be 
considered. Among the options for generating offi-
cial resources were mentioned: 
1) General taxation or other revenues not neces-
sarily related to climate change or the natural 
environment which might be allocated for 
specific budgetary purposes. 
2) Specific taxes or levies related to the emission 
of greenhouse gases, including taxes or levies 
on the use of fossil fuels. 
10.5.2 
Other creative proposals for generating re-
sources have included: 
1) Undisbursed official resources, which might 
result from savings on government energy 
bills and lower levels of military expenditures. 
2) Levying a fixed percentage tax on travel tickets 
issued worldwide. 
3) A world climate lottery. 
Financial 
Mechanisms 
253 
4) Once any future agreement or protocol on 
limiting/reducing greenhouse gas emissions is 
in place, it may be that one source of resources 
would be levies on or payments from coun-
tries unable to meet their treaty or other oblig-
ations. 
10.5.3 
Some delegations stressed the importance 
of assuring the additionality of resources. It would 
not always be possible to identify precisely all the 
resources thus allocated. However, whenever such 
identification is possible, separate statistics should 
be kept. The statistics relating to official develop-
ment assistance of industrialized countries should 
be adapted so as to record the special effort that 
these countries would be prepared to make. 
10.5.4 
Some delegations expressed serious diffi-
culties with proposals for prior dedication of re-
sources, such as all or part of any revenues from 
taxes, levies, or fees on greenhouse gas emissions, 
but agreed that these should be studied among fu-
ture options. 
10.6

10.6.1 
The Working Group agreed that a pro-
gressive approach should be adopted to meet the 
need for financial assistance and cooperation and 
the mechanisms to be utilized or developed. This 
approach would parallel that being pursued in the 
implementation of the Montreal Protocol on the 
phasing out of CFCs and halons. 
10.6.2 
There was 
agreement 
that 
resources 
should flow in a timely, coordinated, and cost-
effective manner throughout the response tracks de-
scribed below. 
1) One track builds on work under way or 
planned in existing institutions. In this regard, 
the World Bank, a number of the regional 
development banks, other multilateral organi-
zations, including the U N specialized agencies 
such as U N D P , and the bilateral assistance 
agencies have initiated efforts to incorporate 
global climate change issues into their pro-
grams. The September 25th Communique of 
the Development Committee and the work 
plans of the new O E C D Development Assis-
tance Committee Group on Development As-
sistance and the Environment are particularly 
noteworthy. Each organization is expected 
to define coherent guidelines for action, and 
to review the need for additional resources 
and expanded programmes. Bilateral donors 
should further integrate and reinforce the en-
vironmental component in their assistance 
programmes, and develop co-financing ar-
rangements with multilateral institutions: the 
deployment of existing development assis-
tance 
monies 
should, therefore, 
be re-
examined. In this regard, the Working Group 
welcomed recent initiatives to increase alloca-
tions of bilateral funds to support environ-
mental programmes. The second track is 
described below. 
2) A number of delegations from both indus-
trialized and developing countries strongly 
urged that the parallel creation of new mecha-
nisms or facilities, like a new international 
Fund, is already justified. They stressed that 
such new instruments should be directly re-
lated to a future climate convention or subse-
quent protocols. It was added that such new 
instruments could be located within the 
World Bank system (with new rules), or else-
where. With respect to this, W M O , U N D P , 
and U N E P were mentioned. It was also noted 
that the Global Environmental Facility pro-
posed by the World Bank in collaboration 
with U N E P and U N D P was welcomed. 
Moreover, some suggested that these instru-
ments should receive guidance from an execu-
tive body to be created under a climate 
convention. Other delegations suggested and 
it was agreed that proposals for new instru-
ments should be clarified. Some delegations 
stated that full assessment of existing mecha-
nisms or facilities should be made before 
studying the need for new mechanisms or a 
new international Fund. 
254 
I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
10.6.3 
While generation of funds might be distin-
guished from allocation of funds, additional re-
sources could be generated by a new mechanism 
from among the options described above (see sec-
tion on sources of funds) but allocated to existing 
institutions to administer programmes. 
10.6.4 
The issue of additionality was discussed in 
some detail. A number of delegations both from 
industrialized 
and developing 
countries 
felt 
strongly that funds raised should be clearly addi-
tional and distinct from those provided for develop-
ment assistance, and that they should be provided 
through separate windows or facilities to make clear 
that they would be provided under different terms 
than normal official development assistance. A 
number of industrialized countries indicated that 
they could not, at present, offer significant addi-
tional resources. This approach does not preclude 
the creation of a body, for consultations among the 
main multilateral partners, similar to the consulta-
tive group on international agricultural research. 
Furthermore, it was noted that unless serious at-
tempts are made to minimize or eliminate contribu-
tions to atmospheric burdens of greenhouse gases 
from existing development assistance portfolios, it 
would be difficult or impossible to justify addi-
tional funds for this purpose. 
10.6.5 
Some delegations expressed the strong 
view that supportive economic measures would be 
important in the context of assistance provided. 
Others expressed reservations about the appro-
priateness of certain types of economic policy dia-
logue in this respect. 
10.6.6 
With regard to the two tracks outlined 
above, the group agreed that individual developing 
countries should initiate studies on their current and 
projected emissions levels and assistance needs in 
limiting/reducing them, across the three most im-
portant sectors—energy, forestry, and agriculture. 
A number of delegations advocated the involvement 
of the World Bank from the start. Each R S W G 
Subgroup should take these into consideration in its 
deliberations. Donors were urged to provide re-
sources for such studies, which should be com-
pleted as expeditiously as possible. In advance of 
such studies donors and recipients should agree on 
the terms of reference. The Working Group noted 
that this approach paralleled that currently under 
way to implement the Montreal Protocol in which 
an accelerated effort is under way to complete as-
sessments and country studies (supported by exter-
nal resources) of the increased needs for coop-
eration and assistance to make possible a phase-out 
of production and use of CFCs. 
10.6.7 
While recognizing the complexity of such 
studies, the Working Group expressed the hope 
that such assessments and strategy plans would pro-
ceed expeditiously to permit early consideration of 
the magnitude of financing requirements, which 
might be encountered by developing countries. 
Some delegations strongly expressed the view that 
such information is indispensable to assess the capa-
bilities of existing institutions, once strengthened 
and reoriented, to meet the financing needs identi-
fied, and to assess the need and scope for new mech-
anisms. 
10.7 
F U T U R E W O R K 
P R O G R A M M E 
10.7.1 
The Working Group agreed that further 
progress was needed in a number of areas, partic-
ularly in assessing the magnitude of the financing 
needed for developing countries, the need for new 
mechanisms, and the contribution of the private 
sector. 
10.7.2 
Individual country studies of current and 
projected emissions of greenhouse gases and plans 
for limiting or reducing emissions are needed to 
permit the assessment of the magnitudes involved. 
It was noted that the application of efficient tech-
nologies can have a major bearing on future capital 
requirements. 
10.7.3 
Such information is fundamental to deter-
mining the future demands on existing institutions 
Financial 
Mechanisms 
255 
and the potential need for new mechanisms. There 
was consensus on the need to further study the 
context of a new mechanism, in the concept of a 
future climate convention or its protocols. 
10.7.4 
The Working Group further noted the im-
portant contribution that the private sector might 
make in cooperating with developing countries to 
respond to climate change. In particular, the private 
sector can facilitate effective technology transfer, 
and, through foreign direct investment, support 
economic growth and provide additional resources. 
The potential for co-financing and other forms of 
public and private sector collaboration should be 
explored. 
10.8 
C O N C L U D I N G

The framework for action that has just been pre-
sented, and the financial mechanisms that could ac-
company it, are of a progressive nature. The first 
far-reaching measures (for 
example, 
research, 
swifter reduction of the emissions of chloro-
fluorocarbons, reinforcement of the scientific ob-
servations 
system, 
technical 
assistance 
for 
developing countries, support for forestry) are al-
ready under way and should be strengthened expe-
ditiously.

E X E C U T I V E S U M M A R Y 
1) The coordinators' report has as its primary 
objective the compilation of elements that 
might be included in a future framework Con-
vention on Climate Change, and a discussion 
of the issues that are likely to arise in the 
context of developing those elements. 
2) There is a general view that while existing legal 
instruments and institutions with a bearing on 
climate should be fully utilized and further 
strengthened, they are insufficient alone to 
meet the challenge. A very broad international 
consensus has therefore emerged in the I P C C , 
confirmed notably at the 44th United Nations 
General Assembly, on the need for a frame-
work Convention on Climate Change. Such a 
Convention should generally follow the for-
mat of the Vienna Convention for the Protec-
tion of the Ozone Layer, in laying down, as a 
minimum, general principles and obligations. 
It should further be framed in such a way as to 
gain the adherence of the largest possible num-
ber and most suitably balanced spread of 
countries while permitting timely action to be 
taken; it should contain provision for separate 
annexes/protocols to deal with specific obliga-
tions. As part of the commitment of the par-
ties to action on greenhouse gas emissions and 
the adverse effects of global warming, the 
Convention would also address the particular 
financial needs of the developing countries, 
the question of the access to and transfer of 
technology, and institutional requirements. 
3) The paper points out a number of issues to be 
decided in the negotiation of a Convention. In 
general these are: 
• the political imperative of striking the cor-
rect balances: on the one hand, between 
the arguments for a far-reaching, action-
oriented Convention and the need for ur-
gent adoption of such a Convention so as to 
begin tackling the problem of climate 
change; and, on the other hand, between the 
cost of inaction and the lack of scientific 
certainty; 
• the extent to which specific obligations, par-
ticularly on the control of emissions of car-
bon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, 
should be included in the Convention itself 
or be the subject of separate protocol(s): 
• the timing of negotiation of such protocol(s) 
in relation to the negotiations on the Con-
vention. 
4) In particular, within the Convention the follow-
ing specific issues will need to be addressed: 
• financial needs of developing countries. 
The 
need for additional resources for developing 
countries and the manner in which this 
should be addressed, particularly in terms of 
the nature, size, and conditions of the fund-
ing, even if detailed arrangements form the 
subject of a separate protocol, will have to be 
considered by the negotiating parties; 
• development and transfer of technology. The 
basis on which the promotion of the devel-
opment and transfer of technology and pro-
vision of technical assistance to develop-
261 
262 
I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
ing countries should take place will need to 
be elaborated, taking into account consid-
erations such as terms of transfer, assured 
access, intellectual property rights, and 
the environmental soundness of such tech-
nology; 
• institutions. Views differ substantially on the 
role and powers of the institutions to be 
created by the Convention, particularly in 
exercising supervision and control over the 
obligations undertaken. 
5) The inclusion of any particular element in the 
paper does not imply consensus with respect to 
that element, or the agreement of any particular 
government to include that element in a Conven-
tion. 
6) The coordinators have not sought to make a 
value judgment in listing and summarizing in the 
attached paper the elements proposed for inclu-
sion in a framework Convention: their text seeks 
merely to assist the future negotiators in their 
task. They note, however, that a readiness to 
address the foregoing fundamental problems in a 
realistic manner will be a prerequisite for ensur-
ing the success of the negotiations and the sup-
port of a sufficiently wide and representative 
spread of nations.

11.1 
P R E A M B L E 
In keeping with common treaty practice including 
the format of the Vienna Convention, the Climate 
Change Convention would contain a preamble that 
might seek to address some or all of the following 
items: 
• a description of the problem and reasons for 
action (need for timely and effective response 
without awaiting absolute scientific certainty); 
• reference to relevant international legal instru-
ments (such as the Vienna Convention and 
Montreal Protocol) and declarations (such as 
U N G A Resolution 43/53 and Principle 21 of 
the Stockholm Declaration); 
• recognition that climate change is a common 
concern of mankind, affects humanity as a 
whole, and should be approached within a 
global framework, without prejudice to the 
sovereignty of states over the airspace superad-
jacent to their territory as recognized under 
international law; 
• recognition of the need for an environment of a 
quality that permits a life of dignity and well-
being for present and future generations; 
• reference to the balance between the sovereign 
right of states to exploit natural resources and 
the concomitant duty to protect and conserve 
climate for the benefit of mankind, in a manner 
not to diminish either; 
• endorsement and elaboration of the concept of 
sustainable development; 
• recognition of the need to improve scientific 
knowledge (e.g., through systematic observa-
tion) and to study the social and economic im-
pacts of climate change, respecting national 
sovereignty; 
• recognition of the importance of the develop-
ment and transfer of technology and of the cir-
cumstances and needs, particularly financial, of 
developing countries; need for regulatory, sup-
portive, and adjustment measures to take into 
account different levels of development and 
thus differing needs of countries; 
• recognition of the responsibility of all countries 
to make efforts at the national, regional, and 
global levels to limit or reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions and prevent activities that could ad-
versely affect climate, while bearing in mind 
that: 
-most emissions affecting the atmosphere at 
present originate in industrialized countries 
where the scope for change is greatest; 
-implementation may take place in different 
time frames for different categories of coun-
tries and may be qualified by the means at the 
disposal of individual countries and their sci-
entific and technical capabilities; 
-emissions 
from developing countries are 
growing and may need to grow in order to 
meet their development requirements and 
thus, over time, are likely to represent an in-
263 
264 
I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
creasingly significant percentage of global 
emissions; 
• recognition of the need to develop strategies to 
absorb greenhouse gases, i.e., protect and in-
crease greenhouse gas sinks; to limit or reduce 
anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions; and 
to adapt human activities to the impacts of cli-
mate change. 
Other key issues that will have to be addressed 
during the development of the preambular language 
include: 
• Should mankind's interest in a viable environ-
ment be characterized as a fundamental right? 
• Is there an entitlement not to be subjected, di-
rectly or indirectly, to the adverse effects of 
climate change? 
• Should there be a reference to the precautionary 
principle? 
• In view of the inter-relationship among all 
greenhouse gases, their sources and sinks, 
should they be treated collectively? 
• Should countries be permitted to meet their 
aggregate global climate objectives through 
joint arrangements? 
• Should reference be made to weather modifica-
tion agreements such as the E N M O D treaty as 
relevant legal instruments ? 
• Is there a common interest of mankind in the 
development and application of technologies to 
protect and preserve climate? 
• Does the concept of sustainable development 
exclude or include the imposition of new condi-
tionally in the provision of financial assistance 
to developing countries, and does it imply a link 
between the protection and preservation of the 
environment, including climate change, and 
economic development so that both are to be 
secured in a coherent and consistent manner? 
• Should the preamble address the particular 
problems of countries with an agricultural 
system vulnerable to climate change and with 
limited access to capital and technologies, 
recognizing the link with sustainable 
de-
velopment? 
• Is there a minimum standard of living that is a 
prerequisite to adopting response strategies to 
address climate change? 
11.2 
D E F I N I T I O N S 
As is the practice, definitions will need to be elabo-
rated in a specific article on definitions. The terms 
that will need to be defined will depend on the 
purpose of the Convention and thus the language 
used by the negotiating parties. 
11.3 
G E N E R A L 
O B L I G A T I O N S 
Following the format of such treaties as the Vienna 
Convention, an article would set out the general 
obligations agreed to by the parties to the Conven-
tion. Such obligations may relate to, for example: 
• the adoption of appropriate measures to protect 
against the adverse effects of climate change, to 
limit, reduce, adapt to, and, as far as possible, 
prevent climate change in accordance with the 
means at the disposal of individual countries 
and their scientific and technical capabilities; 
and to avoid creating other environmental 
problems in taking such measures; 
• the protection, stabilization, and improvement 
of the composition of the atmosphere in order 
to conserve climate for the benefit of present 
and future generations; 
• taking steps having the effect of limiting climate 
change but that are already justified on other 
grounds; 
• the use of climate for peaceful purposes only, in 
a spirit of good neighborliness; 
• cooperation by means of research, systematic 
observation, and information exchange in order 
to understand better and assess the effects of 
human activities on the climate and the poten-
tial adverse environmental and socio-economic 
impacts that could result from climate change, 
respecting national sovereignty; 
• the encouragement of the development and 
transfer of relevant technologies, as well as the 
provision of technical and financial assistance, 
taking into account the particular needs of de-
veloping countries to enable them to fulfill their 
obligations; 
Legal and Institutional 
Mechanisms 
265 
• cooperation in the formulation and harmoniza-
tion of policies and strategies directed at limit-
ing, reducing, adapting to, and, as far as pos-
sible, preventing climate change; 
• cooperation in the adoption of appropriate legal 
or administrative measures to address climate 
change; 
• provision for bilateral, multilateral, and re-
gional agreements or arrangements not incom-
patible with the Convention and any annex/ 
protocol, including opportunities for groups of 
countries to fulfill the requirements on a re-
gional or subregional basis; 
• cooperation with competent international orga-
nizations effectively to meet the objectives of 
the Convention; 
• the encouragement of and cooperation in the 
promotion of public education and awareness 
of the environmental and socio-economic im-
pacts of greenhouse gas emissions and of cli-
mate change; 
• the strengthening or modification if necessary 
of existing legal and institutional instruments 
and arrangements relating to climate change; 
and 
• a provision on funding mechanisms. 
'ther key issues that will have to be addressed in 
e process of elaborating this article include the 
flowing: 
• Should there be a provision setting any specific 
goals with respect to levels of emissions (global 
or national) or atmospheric concentrations of 
greenhouse gases while ensuring stable devel-
opment of the world economy, particularly sta-
bilization by industrialized countries, as a first 
step, and later reduction of C 0 2 emissions and 
emissions of other greenhouse gases not con-
trolled by the Montreal Protocol? Such provi-
sion would not exclude the application of more 
stringent national or regional emission goals 
than those that may be provided for in the Con-
vention and/or any annex/protocol. 
• In light of the preambular language, should 
there be a provision recognizing that imple-
mentation of obligations may take place in dif-
ferent time frames for different categories of 
countries and/or may be qualified by the means 
at the disposal of individual countries and their 
scientific and technical capabilities? 
• Should there be a commitment to formulate 
appropriate measures, such as annexes, proto-
cols or other legal instruments, and, if so, 
should such formulation be on a sound scien-
tific basis or on the basis of the best available 
scientific knowledge? 
• In addressing the transfer of technology, partic-
ularly to developing countries, what should be 
the terms of such transfers (i.e., commercial 
versus non-commercial, preferential versus 
non-preferential, 
the relationship 
between 
transfers and the protection of intellectual 
property rights)? 
• Should funding mechanisms be limited to mak-
ing full use of existing mechanisms or also entail 
new and additional resources and mechanisms? 
• Should provision be made for environmental 
impact assessments of planned activities that are 
likely to cause significant climate change as well

It has been the general practice under international 
environmental agreements to establish various insti-
tutional mechanisms. The parties to a Climate 
Change Convention might, therefore, wish to make 
provision for a Conference of the Parties, an Execu-
tive Organ, and a Secretariat. 
The Conference of the Parties may, among other 
things: keep under continuous review the imple-
mentation of the Convention and take appropriate 
decisions to this end; review current scientific infor-
266 
I P C C RESPONSE STRATEGIES WORKING GROUP REPORTS 
mation; and promote harmonization of policies and 
strategies directed at limiting, reducing, adapting to, 
and, as far as possible, preventing climate change. 
Questions that will arise in developing provisions 
for appropriate institutional mechanisms include: 
• Should any of the Convention's institutions 
(e.g., the Conference of the Parties and/or the 
Executive Organ) have the ability to take deci-
sions inter alia on response strategies or func-
tions in respect of surveillance, verification and 
compliance that would be binding on all the 
parties, and, if so, should such an institution 
represent all of the parties or be composed of a 
limited number of parties (e.g., based on equi-
table geographic representation)? 
• What should be the role of the Secretariat? 
• What should be the decision-making pro-
cedures, including voting requirements (e.g., 
consensus, majority)? 
• If a trust fund or other financial mechanism 
were established under the Convention, how 
should it be administered? 
• Should scientific and/or other bodies be estab-
lished on a permanent or ad hoc basis, to pro-
vide advice and make recommendations to the 
Conference of the Parties concerning research 
activities and measures to deal with climate 
change? 
• Should the composition of the above bodies 
reflect equitable climatic or geographic repre-
sentation? 
• Should there be a provision for working groups 
(e.g., on scientific matters as well as on socio-
economic impacts and response strategies)? 
• Is there a need for innovative approaches to 
institutional mechanisms in the light of the na-
ture of the climate change issue? 
• What should be the role of non-governmental 
organizations?

It would appear to follow general practice to include 
provision for cooperation in research and system-
atic monitoring. In terms of research, each party 
might be called upon to undertake, initiate, and/or 
cooperate in, directly or through international 
bodies, the conduct of research on and analysis of: 
• physical and chemical processes that may affect 
climate; 
• substances, practices, processes, and activities 
that could modify the climate; 
• techniques for monitoring and measuring 
greenhouse gas emission rates and their uptake 
by sinks; 
• improved climate models, particularly for re-
gional climates; 
• environmental, social, and economic effects 
that could result from modifications of climate; 
• alternative substances, technologies, and prac-
tices; 
• environmental, social, and economic effects of 
response strategies; 
• human activities affecting climate; 
• coastal areas, with particular reference to sea 
level rise; 
• water resources; and 
• energy efficiency. 
The parties might also be called upon to cooper-
ate in establishing and improving, directly or 
through competent international bodies, and taking 
fully into account national legislation and relevant 
ongoing activities at the national, regional, and in-
ternational levels, joint or complementary pro-
grammes for systematic monitoring and analysis of 
climate, including a possible worldwide system; 
and cooperate in ensuring the collection, validation 
and transmission of research, observational data 
and analysis through appropriate data centers. 
Other issues that will arise in developing this 
provision include: 
• Should consideration be given to the establish-
ment of panels of experts or of an independent 
scientific board responsible for the coordina-
tion of data collection from the above areas of 
research and analysis and for periodic assess-
ment of the data? 
• Should provision be made for on-site inspec-
tion? 
• Should there be provision for open and non-
discriminatory access to meteorological data 
developed by all countries? 
• Should a specific research fund be established?

Precedents would suggest the inclusion of a provi-
sion for the transmission of information through 
the Secretariat to the Conference of the Parties on 
measures adopted by them in implementation of the 
Convention and of protocols to which they are 
party. In an annex to the Vienna Convention, the 
types of information exchanged are specified and 
include scientific, technical, socio-economic, com-
mercial and legal information. 
For the purposes of elaborating this provision, 
issues having to be addressed by the negotiating 
parties include those below. 
• Is there a need for the elaboration of a compre-
hensive international research programme in 
order to facilitate cooperation in the exchange 
of scientific, technological, and other informa-
tion on climate change? 
• Should parties be obliged to report on measures 
they have adopted for the implementation of 
the Convention, with the possible inclusion of 
regular reporting on a comparable basis of their 
emissions of greenhouse gases? 
• Should each party additionally be called upon 
to develop a national inventory of emissions, 
strategies, and available technologies for ad-
dressing climate change? If so, the Convention 
might also call for the exchange of information 
on such inventories, strategies, and technolo-
gies.

While the issue of technology has been addressed in 
the section on General Obligations, it might be 
considered desirable to include separate provisions 
on technology transfer and technical cooperation. 
Such provisions could call upon the parties to pro-
mote the development and transfer of technology 
and technical cooperation, taking into account par-
ticularly the needs of developing countries, to en-
able them to take measures to protect against the 
adverse effects of climate change, to limit, reduce, 
and, as far as possible, prevent climate change, or to 
adapt to it. 
Another issue that will arise is: should special 
terms be attached to climate-related transfers of 
technology (such as a preferential and/or non-
commercial basis and assured access to, and transfer 
of, environmentally sound technologies on favor-
able terms to developing countries), taking into 
consideration the protection of intellectual property 
rights?

It would be usual international practice to include a 
provision on the settlement of disputes that may 
arise concerning the interpretation or application of 
the Convention and/or any annex/protocol. Provi-
sions similar to those in the Vienna Convention for 
the Protection of the Ozone Layer might be em-
ployed, i.e., voluntary resort to arbitration or the 
International Court of Justice (with a binding 
award) or, if neither of those options is elected, 
mandatory resort to conciliation (with a recom-
mendatory award). 
It would be the usual international practice to 
include clauses on the following topics: 
• amendment of the Convention; 
• status, adoption and amendment of annexes; 
• adoption and entry into force of, and amend-
ments to, protocols; 
• signature; 
• ratification; 
• accession; 
• right to vote; 
• relationship between the Convention and any 
protocol(s); 
• entry into force; 
• reservations; 
• withdrawal; 
• depositary; and 
• authentic texts.

The negotiating parties may wish the Convention to 
provide for the possibility of annexes and/or proto-
cols. Annexes might be concluded as integral parts 
of the Convention, while protocols might be con-
cluded subsequently (as in the case of the Montreal 
Protocol to the Vienna Convention on Protection 
of the Ozone Layer). While it is recognized that the 
Convention is to be all-encompassing, the negotiat-
ing parties will have to decide whether greenhouse 
gases, their sources and sinks, are to be dealt with: 
individually, in groups, or comprehensively; in an-
nexes or protocols to the Convention. The follow-
ing, among others, might also be considered as 
possible subjects for annexes or protocols to the 
Convention: 
• agricultural practices; 
• forest management; 
• funding mechanisms; 
• research and systematic observations; 
• energy conservation and alternative sources of 
energy; 
• liability and compensation; 
• international emissions trading; 
• international taxation system; and 
• development and transfer of climate change-
related technologies. 
Issues that will arise in connection with the develop-
ment of annexes and protocols include: 
• timing, i.e., negotiating parties advocating a 
more action-oriented Convention may seek to 
include specific obligations in annexes as op-
posed to subsequent protocols and/or negotiate 
one or more protocols in parallel with the Con-
vention negotiations; 
• sequence, i.e., if there is to be a series of proto-
cols, in what order should they be taken up?
