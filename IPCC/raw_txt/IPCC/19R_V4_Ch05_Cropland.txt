5.2.1 
Biomass 
5.2.1.1 CHOICE OF METHODS 
Carbon can be stored in the biomass of croplands that contain perennial woody vegetation including, but not 
limited to, monocultures such as tea, coffee, oil palm, coconut, rubber plantations, fruit and nut orchards, and 
polycultures such as agroforestry systems. The default methodology for estimating carbon stock changes in woody 
biomass is provided in Chapter 2, Section 2.2.1. This section elaborates this methodology with respect to 
estimating changes in carbon stocks in biomass in Cropland Remaining Cropland.  
The change in biomass is only estimated for perennial woody crops. For annual crops, increase in biomass stocks 
in a single year is assumed equal to biomass losses from harvest and mortality in that same year - thus there is no 
net accumulation of biomass carbon stocks.  
Changes in carbon in cropland biomass (CCCB) may be estimated from either: (a) annual rates of biomass gain 
and loss (Chapter 2, Equation 2.7) or (b) carbon stocks at two points in time (Chapter 2, Equation 2.8). The first 
approach (gain-loss method) provides the default Tier 1 method and can also be used at Tier 2 or 3 with refinements 
described below. The second approach (the stock-difference method) applies either at Tier 2 or Tier 3, but not Tier 
1. It is good practice to improve inventories by using the highest feasible tier given national circumstances. It is 
good practice for countries to use a Tier 2 or Tier 3 method if carbon emissions and removals in Cropland 
Remaining Cropland is a key category and if the sub-category of biomass is considered significant. It is good 
practice for countries to use the decision tree in Figure 2.2 in Chapter 2 to identify the appropriate tier to estimate 
changes in carbon stocks in biomass. 
Tier 1 
The default method is to multiply the area of perennial woody cropland by a net estimate of biomass accumulation 
from growth and subtract losses associated with harvest or gathering or disturbance (according to Equation 2.7 in 
Chapter 2). Losses are estimated by multiplying a carbon stock value by the area of cropland on which perennial 
woody crops are harvested.   
Default Tier 1 assumptions are: all carbon in perennial woody biomass removed (e.g., biomass cleared and 
replanted with a different crop) is emitted in the year of removal; and perennial woody crops accumulate carbon 
for an amount of time equal to a nominal harvest/maturity cycle. The latter assumption implies that perennial 
woody crops accumulate biomass for a finite period until they are removed through harvest or reach a steady state 
where there is no net accumulation of carbon in biomass because growth rates have slowed and incremental gains 
from growth are offset by losses from natural mortality, pruning or other losses. 
Under Tier 1, updated default factors shown in updated Table 5.1, Table 5.2 and Table 5.3, are applied to nationally 
derived estimates of land areas. For perennial cropland C uptake, multiply unharvested area that is still younger 
than the age of maturity by the above-ground growth rate.  If harvest and immature areas are unknown, it is 
assumed that in cropland remaining cropland, the annual harvest area is equal to total area divided by rotation 
length in years.  For perennial cropland C losses, the updated tables provide two types of carbon stocks of perennial 
woody biomass per area. One is maximum carbon stock at harvest/maturity state (Lmax). This is appropriate for 
estimating harvest loss due to crop renewal. The other is the mean carbon stock over the whole lifetime of the crop 
(Lmean). This is used for loss due to conversion to another land use where the age of converted cropland is unknown. 
These values should be used appropriately to calculate carbon losses following the guidance in 5.2.1.2. 
 
Tier 2 
 
Chapter 5: Cropland 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
5.7 
Two methods can be used for Tier 2 estimation of changes in biomass. Method 1 (also called the Gain-Loss 
Method) requires the biomass carbon loss to be subtracted from the biomass carbon increment for the reporting 
year (Chapter 2, Equation 2.7).  Method 2 (also called the Stock-Difference Method) requires biomass carbon 
stock inventories for a given land-use area at two points in time (Chapter 2, Equation 2.8). 
A Tier 2 estimate, in contrast, will generally develop estimates for the major woody crop types by climate zones, 
using country-specific carbon accumulation rates and stock losses where possible or country-specific estimates of 
carbon stocks at two points in time. Under Tier 2, carbon stock changes are estimated for above-ground and below-
ground biomass in perennial woody vegetation. Tier 2 methods involve country-specific or region-specific 
estimates of biomass stocks by major cropland types and management system and estimates of stock change as a 
function of major management system (e.g., dominant crop, productivity management).  To the extent possible, it 
is good practice for countries to incorporate changes in perennial crop or tree biomass using country-specific or 
region-specific data.  Where data are missing, default data may be used.   
Tier 3 
A Tier 3 estimate will use a highly disaggregated Tier 2 approach or a country-specific method involving process 
modelling and/or detailed measurement. Tier 3 involves inventory systems using statistically-based sampling of 
carbon stocks over time and/or process models, stratified by climate, cropland type and management regime. For 
example, validated species-specific growth models that incorporate management effects such as harvesting and 
fertilization, with corresponding data on management activities, can be used to estimate net changes in cropland 
biomass carbon stocks over time. Models, perhaps accompanied by measurements like those in forest inventories, 
can be used to estimate stock changes and extrapolate to entire cropland areas, as in Tier 2. 
Key criteria in selecting appropriate models are that they are capable of representing all of the management 
practices that are represented in the activity data. It is critical that the model be validated with independent 
observations from country-specific or region-specific field locations that are representative of climate, soil and 
cropland management systems in the country. 
5.2.1.2 CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTORS 
Emission and removal factors required to estimate the changes in carbon stocks include (a) annual biomass 
accumulation or growth rate, and (b) biomass loss factors which are influenced by such activities as removal 
(harvesting), fuelwood gathering and disturbance. 
Above-ground woody biomass growth rate 
Tier 1 
Updated Tables 5.1 to 5.3 provide estimates of biomass stocks and/or biomass growth rates and losses for major 
climatic regions and agricultural systems. Updated Table 5.1 provides default values of biomass growth and losses 
applicable to agroforestry cropping systems in broad climate regions. Agroforestry systems are defined in Table 
5.5. Updated Table 5.2 provides default sequestration rates in above- and below-ground biomass for agro-forestry 
systems by region and climate zone. Updated Table 5.3 provides default values of biomass growth and losses for 
perennial cropping monoculture systems.  Countries should use appropriate default values of above-ground 
biomass growth rate relative to each climate region and cropping system from updated Table 5.1, Table 5.2 or 
Table 5.3.  However, given the large variation in cropping systems, incorporating trees or tree crops, it is good 
practice to seek national data on above-ground woody biomass growth rate. 
Tier 2 
Annual woody biomass growth rate data can be, at a finer or disaggregated scale, based on national data sources 
for different cropping and agroforestry systems. Rates of change in annual woody biomass growth rate should be 
estimated in response to changes in specific management/land-use activities (e.g., fertilization, harvesting, 
thinning). Results from field research should be compared to estimates of biomass growth from other sources to 
verify that they are within documented ranges. It is important, in deriving estimates of biomass accumulation rates, 
to recognize that biomass growth rates will occur primarily during the first 20 years following changes in 
management, after which time the rates will tend towards a new steady-state level with little or no change occurring 
unless further changes in management conditions occur.

Tier 3 
For Tier 3, highly disaggregated factors for biomass accumulation are needed. These may include categorisation 
of species, specific for growth models that incorporate management effects such as harvesting and fertilization. 
Measurement of above-ground biomass, similar to forest inventory with periodic measurement of above-ground 
biomass accumulation, is necessary.

1 Updated Table 5.3 from 2006 IPCC Guidelines 
Below-ground biomass accumulation 
Tier 1 
The default assumption is that there is no change in below-ground biomass of perennial trees in agricultural 
systems. There are limited below-ground biomass data for agricultural systems. 
Tier 2 
This includes the use of actually measured below-ground biomass data from perennial woody vegetation. 
Estimating below-ground biomass accumulation is recommended for Tier 2 calculation. Estimates are provided in 
Table 5.2. Root-to-shoot ratios show wide ranges in values at both individual species (e.g., Anderson et al. 1972) 
and community scales (e.g., Jackson et al. 1996; Cairns et al. 1997). Limited data is available for below ground 
biomass thus, as far as possible, empirically-derived root-to-shoot ratios specific to a region or vegetation type 
should be used.  
Tier 3 
This includes the use of data from field studies identical to forest inventories and modelling studies, if stock 
difference method is adopted.  
Biomass losses from removal, fuelwood and disturbance 
Tier 1 
The default assumption is that all biomass lost is assumed to be emitted in the same year. Limited biomass removal, 
fuelwood gathering and disturbance loss data from cropland source are available. Food and Agriculture 
Organization of the United Nations (FAO) provides total roundwood and fuelwood consumption data, but not 
separated by source (e.g., Cropland, Forest Land, etc.). It is recognized that statistics on fuelwood are extremely 
poor and uncertain worldwide. Default removal and fuelwood gathering statistics (discussed in Chapter 4, Section 
4.2) may include biomass coming from cropland such as when firewood is harvested from home gardens. Thus, it 
is necessary to ensure no double counting of losses occurs. If no data are available for roundwood or fuelwood 
sources from Cropland, the default approach will include losses in Forest Land (Section 4.2) and will exclude 
 
Chapter 5: Cropland 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
5.13 
losses from Cropland. Updated Tables 5.1 and 5.3 provide default values of maximum carbon stock per area (Lmax) 
and mean carbon stock per area (Lmean). Countries should use Lmax in updated Table 5.1 and 5.3 in the case that 
perennial woody biomass is replaced at or over the year of harvest/maturity under a nominal harvest/maturity cycle 
assuming that perennial cropland is harvested and regenerated back into perennial cropland. Carbon losses are 
estimated by multiplying annual area of harvested/replaced cropland by Lmax.  Countries should use Lmean in 
updated Table 5.1 and 5.3 in the case that carbon removal has occurred by land use change where the age of the 
perennial crop removed is unknown. Carbon losses are estimated by multiplying the annual area of land conversion 
by Lmean. When perennial cropland is converted to another type of cropland, losses are reported in cropland 
remaining cropland. When perennial cropland is converted to non-cropland land uses, losses are reported in 
relevant land converted categories 
Tiers 2 and 3 
National level data at a finer scale, based on inventory studies or production and consumption studies according 
to different sources, including agricultural systems, can be used to estimate biomass loss. These can be obtained 
through a variety of methods, including estimating density (crown coverage) of woody vegetation from air photos 
(or high-resolution satellite imagery) and ground-based measurement plots. Species composition, density and 
above-ground vs. below-ground biomass can vary widely for different cropland types and conditions and thus it 
may be most efficient to stratify sampling and survey plots by cropland types. General guidance on survey and 
sampling techniques for biomass inventories is given in Chapter 3, Annex 3A.3.   
5.2.1.3 CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
Activity data in this section refer to estimates of land areas of growing stock and harvested land with perennial 
woody crops. The area data are estimated using the approaches described in Chapter 3. They should be regarded 
as strata within the total cropland area (to keep land-use data consistent) and should be disaggregated depending 
on the tier used and availability of growth and loss factors. Examples of Cropland subcategories are given in 
updated Table 5.4. 
Tier 1 
Under Tier 1, annual or periodic surveys are used in conjunction with the approaches outlined in Chapter 3 to 
estimate the average annual area of established perennial woody crops and the average annual area of perennial 
woody crops that are harvested or removed. The area estimates are further sub-divided into general climate regions 
or soil types to match the default biomass gain and loss values. Under Tier 1 calculations, international statistics 
such as FAO databases, and other sources can be used to estimate the area of land under perennial woody crops. 
Tier 2 
Under Tier 2, more detailed annual or periodic surveys are used to estimate the areas of land in different classes 
of perennial woody biomass crops. Areas are further classified into relevant sub categories such that all major 
combinations of perennial woody crop types and climatic regions are represented with each area estimate. These 
area estimates must match any country-specific biomass carbon increment and loss values developed for the Tier 
2 method. If country-specific finer resolution data are only partially available, countries are encouraged to 
extrapolate to the entire land base of perennial woody crops using sound assumptions from best available 
knowledge.  
Tier 3 
Tier 3 requires high-resolution activity data disaggregated at sub-national to fine grid scales. Similar to Tier 2, 
land area is classified into specific types of perennial woody crops by major climate and soil categories and other 
potentially important regional variables (e.g., regional patterns of management practices). Furthermore, it is good 
practice to relate spatially explicit area estimates with local estimates of biomass increment, loss rates, and 
management practices to improve the accuracy of estimates.

EXAMPLES OF CLASSIFICATION OF PERENNIAL CROP SYSTEMS 
 
Crop system 
Description 
Agroforestry 
Fallows 
Land rested from cultivation, but comprises planted and managed trees, often 
leguminous, shrubs and herbaceous cover crops before it is cultivated again. 
Includes improved and natural fallows and can be implemented before any of the 
following systems.   
Hedgerows 
Linear plantation around fields, including shelterbelts, windbreaks, boundary 
plantings and live fences. 
Alley cropping  
Fast-growing, usually leguminous, woody species (mainly shrubs) grown in crop 
fields, usually at high densities. The woody species are regularly pruned and the 
prunings are applied as mulch into the alleys as a source of organic matter and 
nutrients. Also known as intercropping. 
Multistrata 
systems 
Multistorey combinations of a large number of various trees and perennial and 
annual crops. They include home gardens and agroforests. 
Parklands 
Intercropping of agricultural crops or grazing land under low density mature 
scattered trees. Typical of dry areas like Sahel (e.g. Faidherbia albida). 
Shaded 
perennial-crop 
systems 
Growing shade-tolerant species such as cacao and coffee under, or in between, 
overstorey shade trees that can be used for timber or other commercial tree products 
Silvoarable 
systems 
Woody species planted in parallel tree rows to allow mechanization and 
intercropped with an annual crop; usually used for timber (e.p. Juglans spp), but 
also for fuel (e.p. Populus spp). Usually low tree density per hectare. 
Silvopastoral 
systems 
Woody species planted on permanent grasslands, often grazed. 
 
Plantations 
Monoculture plantation crops such as tea, coffee and cacao grown without shade 
trees, as well as oil palms, rubber and coconuts. 
Monoculture 
Vine systems 
A plantation of vines, typically producing grapes used for winemaking, but also 
kiwifruit or passionfruit. 
 
Orchards 
systems 
Land planted with woody vegetation, often fruit trees (eg. apple, pear, plum, nut 
trees). Understory vegetation is usually mowed or grazed. 
Source: Cardinael et al. (2018), adapted from Nair et al. (2009) 
Within the FAOSTAT land use classification system most perennial crop systems will be classified under 6650 (Land under permanent 
crops). Fallows may be reported under 6655 (Land with temporary fallow), and parklands and silvopastoral systems under 6655 (Land 
under permanent meadows and pastures), Land that meets the forest definition will be reported as Forest land.

Soil carbon 
Cropland management modifies soil C stocks to varying degrees depending on how specific practices influence C 
input and output from the soil system (Paustian et al. 1997a; Bruce et al. 1999; Ogle et al. 2005).  The main 
management practices that affect soil C stocks in croplands are the type of residue management, tillage 
management, fertilizer management (both mineral fertilizers and organic amendments), choice of crop and 
 
Chapter 5: Cropland 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
5.15 
intensity of cropping management (e.g., continuous cropping versus cropping rotations with periods of bare fallow), 
irrigation management, and mixed systems with cropping and pasture or hay in rotating sequences.  In addition, 
drainage and cultivation of organic soils reduces soil C stocks (Armentano and Menges, 1986).  
General information and guidance for estimating changes in soil C stocks are found in Section 2.3.3 of Chapter 2 
(including equations).  That section should be read before proceeding with specific guidelines dealing with 
Cropland soil C stocks. The total change in soil C stocks for Cropland is estimated using Equation 2.24 (Chapter 
2), which combines the change in soil organic C stocks for mineral soils and organic soils; and stock changes 
associated with soil inorganic C pools (Tier 3 only).  This section provides specific guidance for estimating soil 
organic C stock changes. Soil inorganic C is fully covered by Section 2.3.3.1. 
To account for changes in soil C stocks associated with Cropland Remaining Cropland, countries need at a 
minimum, estimates of the Cropland area at the beginning and end of the inventory time period. If land-use and 
management data are limited, aggregate data, such as FAO statistics on Cropland, can be used as a starting point, 
along with expert knowledge about the approximate distribution of land management systems (e.g., medium, low 
and high input cropping systems, etc.). Cropland management classes must be stratified according to climate 
regions and major soil types, which can either be based on default or country-specific classifications.  This can be 
accomplished with overlays of land use on suitable climate and soil maps.   
5.2.3.1 CHOICE OF METHOD 
Inventories can be developed using a Tier 1, 2, or 3 method, with each successive Tier requiring more detail and 
resources than the previous one.  It is also possible that countries will use different tiers to prepare estimates for 
the separate subcategories of soil C (i.e., soil organic C stocks changes in mineral soils and organic soils, and stock 
changes associated with soil inorganic C pools).  Decision trees are provided for mineral soils (Figure 2.5) and 
organic soils (Figure 2.6) in Section 2.3.3.1 (Chapter 2) to assist inventory compilers with selection of the 
appropriate tier for their soil C inventory.  
Mineral soils 
Tier 1 
For mineral soils, the estimation method is based on changes in soil organic C stocks over a finite period following 
changes in management that impact soil organic C.  Equation 2.25 (Chapter 2) is used to estimate change in soil 
organic C stocks in mineral soils by subtracting the C stock in the last year of an inventory time  period (SOC0) 
from the C stock at the beginning of the inventory time period (SOC(0 –T)) and dividing by the time dependence of 
the stock change factors (D).  In practice, country-specific data on land use and management must be obtained and 
classified into appropriate land management systems (e.g., high, medium and low input cropping), including tillage 
management, and then stratified by IPCC climate regions and soil types.  Soil organic C stocks (SOC) are estimated 
for the beginning and end of the inventory time period using default reference carbon stocks (SOCref) and default 
stock change factors (FLU, FMG, FI ).     
Tier 2 
Developing Country-Specific Factors for the Default Equations  
For Tier 2, the same basic equations are used as in Tier 1 (Equation 2.25), but country-specific information is 
incorporated to specify better the stock change factors and reference C stocks with more disaggregation of climate 
regions, soil types, and/or the land management classification.  See Section 2.3.3.1, Chapter 2, Volume IV for 
more information. 
Biochar C Amendments 
Tier 2 methods for biochar C amendments utilize a top-down approach in which the total amount of biochar 
generated and added to mineral soil is used to estimate the change in soil organic C stocks  with country-specific 
factors.  See Section 2.3.3.1, Chapter 2, Volume IV for more information.  
Steady-State Method 
The Tier 2 steady-state method is a three sub-pool steady-state C model that provides an optional alternative 
method for estimating soil C stock changes in the 0-30 cm layer of mineral soils in Cropland Remaining Cropland.2  
This Tier 2 steady-state method estimates C stock changes from combinations of tillage and C-input management 
activities under conditions defined by the soil texture and the weather.  The method is not appropriate for rice 
cultivation and is not parameterised to estimate the change in soil organic C stocks due to biochar C amendments. 
 
2 The Tier2 Steady state method may be applicable to other land uses, but this will require further development and 
parameterisation than provided in this section. 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
5.16 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
This is an approach with intermediate complexity between Tier 1 and Tier 3 methods, and is based on a steady-
state solution to the three soil organic C sub-pools in the Century ecosystem model (Ogle et al. 2012; Parton et al. 
1987; Paustian et al. 1997b).   
The Tier 2 steady-state method addresses more complexity in soil C dynamics than Tier 1 or Tier 2 using default 
equations, by subdividing soil organic C into three separate sub-pools with fast (Active sub-pool), intermediate 
(Slow sub-pool), and long turnover times (Passive sub-pool). The turnover time of C within each sub-pool 
determines the length of time that C remains in the soil. The Tier 2 steady-state method incorporates spatial and 
temporal variation in climate, organic carbon inputs to soils, soil properties and management practices. However, 
compilers can further develop and/or parameterise this model given appropriate datasets, which would be a Tier 3 
method (See Section 2.5.2 for more information about developing a Tier 3 model-based approach).  See Boxes 
5.1A and 5.1B for more information about the method. 
BOX 5.1A (NEW)  
UNDERSTANDING THE BASIS FOR THE TIER 2 STEADY STATE METHOD 
The Tier 2 steady-state method, based on a soil C model, features intermediate complexity between 
Tier 1 and Tier 3 methods.  It allows a compiler to estimate C stock changes in a more disaggregated 
way compared to Tier 1, but lacks the full complexity of Tier 3 methods. The model parameters 
were determined using a Bayesian Calibration method (See Annex 5A.3), and application of this 
method will generate SOC stock change factor that are specific to climate, soil and management 
conditions in a country.  Consequently, the resulting stock change factors are more disaggregated 
than the default Tier 1 methods that are derived at a global scale with limited disaggregation to 
broadly-defined climate regions.  
It is noteworthy that Tier 2 methods are often based directly on the Tier 1 equations with country-
specific factors, but this is not a requirement for a Tier 2 method (See Volume 4, Chapter 1, Box 
1.1). This method is analogous to the Tier 2 methods for estimating CH4 emissions from enteric 
fermentation (Volume 4, Chapter 10), with a set of equations for calculating gross energy intake in 
order to derive a country-specific emission factor. The Tier 2 equations are used to derive stock 
change factors from country-specific data on crop type, yields, tillage, organic amendments, soil 
texture, and weather.  The Tier 2 steady-state method uses management activity data that are 
typically more available in a country than that required to apply the methods for the default 
equations.  The method gives the countries with these data an option to develop C stock change that 
are more responsive to their particular conditions than the Tier 1 approach.  The Tier 1 equations 
require detailed information on the combination of crops types, tillage practices, manure 
amendments, mineral fertilization, irrigation management, grazing management, green manures, and 
fallows for individual parcels of land in the inventory. Although several of these activity data are 
needed for the Tier 2 steady-state method, much of the data requirements with the default equations 
are represented by the C inputs to the soil that are derived from crop yields, thereby eliminating 
several data requirements. 
This method differs from Tier 3 methods that utilize process-based models that yield a fully dynamic 
time series by simulating changes in management and environmental conditions through time. This 
Tier 2 method does not simulate C change but simply calculates an annual C stock change from the 
current C stock to the future steady-state soil C stock calculated based on current conditions. In 
addition, the steady-state method is much less complex with about 20 parameters compared to the 
100s to 1000s parameters that are often found in Tier 3 process-based models. Consequently, the 
data and resource requirements are considerably less intensive than typical process-based model 
applications (See examples in Box 2.2d, Chapter 2, Volume IV).  
The Tier 2 steady state method introduces additional interannual variation into the final results 
compared to Tier 1, by representing the impact of drivers such as weather on C inputs to soils and 
losses associated with decomposition of soil organic matter. Using this method may require 
additional quality assurance, quality control and verification (see Volume 1, Chapter 6, Section 
6.11).

DESCRIPTION OF THE TIER 2 STEADY STATE METHOD FOR ESTIMATING MINERAL SOIL 
ORGANIC CARBON STOCK CHANGES 
The Tier 2 steady-state method is adapted from the Century Ecosystem Model (Parton et al. 1987) 
and estimates changes in soil organic C for the top 30cm of the soil profile. In this model, the stock 
of the soil carbon sub-pools is initialised by running the model with climate and carbon input data 
associated for a period of 5-20 years prior to the start of the inventory (or longer if data are available). 
A proportion of biomass C (C input to the soil) is transferred to soil litter, and then divided into 
fraction, β, that goes to metabolic components with the remaining fraction (Cinput- β) going to 
structural components 1. The structural component is composed of more recalcitrant, ligno-cellulose 
plant materials. The metabolic component is composed of more readily decomposed organic matter. 
Decomposition products are transferred according to calculated fractional transfer coefficients (f1 to 
f8) to and between three soil organic matter sub-pools, active, slow and passive. The active sub-pool 
is microbial (bacteria and fungi) biomass and associated metabolites with a rapid turnover (months 
to years), the slow sub-pool has intermediate stability and turnover (decades), and the passive sub-
pool is mineral-protected C and microbial decomposition products with long turnover times 
(centuries).  Irrespective of the turnover time the approach is used to estimate the stock of each sub-
pool and how they change over time.  The total soil organic carbon stock and stock change is 
calculated as the sum of the values derived for each sub-pool. 
 
Decomposition rates for sub-pools depend on the decay rate constants, temperature effects, and 
moisture effects. Decomposition of the active and slow sub-pools is also influenced by the soil 
texture (sand content) and tillage practice. Sub-pools with longer turnover times imply that the C 
remains in the soil for more years before the organic matter is decomposed and carbon is respired as 
CO2 by the soil decomposer community. As decomposition occurs in each sub-pool, some of the 
decomposing C is transferred to other sub-pools and components (arrows in the diagram) and some 
of the C is converted into CO2 and lost from the soil (not identified with arrows). The transfer of C 
to the next sub-pool or component at steady state is determined by the transfer coefficients (f).  
Higher transfer coefficients imply that more of the C is transferred to the next sub-pool or component 
rather than converted into CO2. The steady-state solution for this model is discussed further in 
Paustian et al. (1997) and Ogle et al. (2012).  
1 This approach is not intended to be used for estimation of dead organic matter. Compilers should apply the dead organic 
matter methods in section 5.2.2. 
The land base is stratified as fine as possible to include the spatial variation in climate, soil properties, irrigation, 
and tillage practices. However, there will be practical limits to the level of stratification given the resolution of 
data and national circumstances for inventory compilation. The method can be applied by subdividing the country 
into grid cells or regions, such as counties, districts or municipalities. Each grid cell or region would contain a 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
5.18 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
single combination of climate, soil properties and tillage practices and have an area of land assigned to the unit. 
Within each grid cell or region, the compiler will determine the C input using country-specific equations, or 
alternatively a generic equation can be used (Equation 5.0h). Compilers will also need values for the parameters 
defining the quality of the C input (lignin and nitrogen content) or use generic values available in Tables 5.5b and 
5.5c. The type of tillage applied within each grid cell or region will need to be compiled to determine the correct 
value for tillage parameter. Monthly average temperature, precipitation and potential evapotranspiration is needed 
for each grid cell or region. This information is available from global datasets, such as the Climatic Research Unit 
(CRU) climate dataset3, if country-specific data are not available. The average sand content is needed for each grid 
cell or region, which is available from Harmonized World Soil Database4  or from Soil Grids5, if country-specific 
data are not available. If global data sources are used, it is important to understand and acknowledge the uncertainty 
associated with these data products to estimate confidence intervals for the resulting changes in soil C stocks.   
The following sections provide the equations and steps involved with application of the method within a grid cell 
or region (e.g., counties, districts or municipalities). The equations estimate water and temperature effects on 
decomposition; the size of the active, slow and passive soil carbon sub-pools; and the change in total SOC. The 
values of default parameters are given in Table 5.5a. All constants in the equations are considered globally 
applicable and should not be altered when applying this Tier 2 steady-state method. The change in soil C stock is 
calculated annually, multiplied by the area of the grid cell or region and the product summed across all grid cells 
or regions to determine the annual inventory soil C stock change.

Step-by-Step procedure for implementing the Tier2 steady-state method for Mineral 
Soils 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
5.24 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Steps 1 to 8 are conducted for each grid cell or region, depending on the spatial unit of the inventory.  Step 9 sums 
the changes across the entire spatial domain6. 
Step 1. Calculate the Initial Stocks of the Active, Slow and Passive SOC sub-pools 
The initial stocks are calculated based on the climatic, soil texture, management and carbon input data for a run-
in period7 of 5 to 20 years (more years may be used if data are available). 
Step 1.1: Calculate the average annual values of 
tfac
 (Equation 5.0e) and 
wfac
 (Equation 5.0f) for the run-in 
period. 
Step 1.2: Calculate the C input to the active sub-pool ( ) for the run-in period (Equation 5.0g) using the following 
data: 
a. the average annual carbon input (
Cinput
) for the run-in period, which may be estimated with Equation 5.0h 
if country-specific methods are not available, 
b. the appropriate values for LC and NC for the crop and/or grass in place during the run-in period can be 
found in the Tier2 steady-state method section for cropland (see Section 5.2.3.2 for cropland default values, 
otherwise compile country-specific values), 
c. the value of 
2f  from Table 5.5a, and 
d. the sand content of the 0-30 cm soil layer ( sand ). 
Step 1.3: Calculate the values of 
ak  (Equation 5.0b), 
sk  (Equation 5.0c) and 
p
k  (Equation 5.0d) using: 
a. the average values of 
tfac
  and 
wfac
 calculated in Step 1.1, 
b. the values of 
kfaca
, 
kfacs
, 
kfacp
 and the appropriate tillage factor (
tillfac
 ) from Table 5.5A, and 
c. the sand content of the 0-30 cm soil layer ( sand ). 
Step 1.4: Calculate the values for ACTIVEy* (Equation 5.0b), SLOWy* (Equation 5.0c) and PASSIVEy* (Equation 
5.0d) for the run-in period, which become the initial SOC stocks for the ACTIVE, SLOW and PASSIVE SOC 
sub-pools at the commencement of the inventory period. 
Step 2. Calculate C Input to the Active Sub-pool for each year of the inventory period 
Calculate value of  (the C input to the active SOC sub-pool) for each year in the inventory period using Equation 
5.0g. 
Step 2.1: Calculate the C input to the metabolic dead organic matter component (  ). 
Step 2.2: Calculate the C input to the active soil carbon sub-pool ( ). 
Step 2.3: Repeat Steps 2.1 to 2.2 for all other years in the inventory period to derive annual values for   and  . 
Step 3. Calculate Water Effect on Decomposition 
Estimate the water effect on soil organic matter decomposition using Equation 5.0f. 
Step 3.1: For each month in a year, calculate the ratio of total precipitation to total potential evapotranspiration.  
a. If the ratio is ≤1.25 then set the value of 
i
mappet   for the month to the estimated ratio. 
b. If the ratio is >1.25 then set the value of 
i
mappet  for the month to 1.25. 
c. Set 
iw  for months with irrigation to 0.775. 
Step 3.2: Calculate water effect on decomposition for each month (
iw ) in a year. For land area under irrigation 
management, set the water effect on decomposition for the month (
iw ) to 0.775.  
Step 3.3: Calculate the annual water effect on decomposition (
wfac
).

7 Compilers can use longer run-in periods than 20 years to establish the initial soil organic C stocks for the inventory, but 5 
years is considered a minimum period of time for this method.  Initial values of the active, slow and passive pools can lead 
to biases in results if the run-in period is not long enough to capture the trajectory of the stocks based on legacy effects 
associated with historical land use and management.

Step 3.4: Repeat steps 3.1 to 3.3 to calculate the water effect (
wfac
) on decomposition for all years in the inventory 
period. 
Step 4. Calculate Temperature Effect on Decomposition 
Calculate the temperature effect on soil organic matter decomposition using Equation 5.0e. 
Step 4.1: For each month in a year, calculate temperature effect on decomposition (
iT ) using the values for 
maximum monthly temperature for decomposition ( max
t
), optimum temperature for decomposition ( opt
t
) and the 
monthly average temperature (
i
temp ). 
a. If the monthly average temperature is ≤45 °C, use the calculated value of 
iT . 
b. If the monthly average temperature is >45 °C, set 
iT  equal to 0. 
Step 4.2: Calculate annual temperature effect on decomposition (
tfac
).  
Step 4.3: Repeat steps 4.1 and 4.2 to calculate the annual temperature effect on decomposition for all years in the 
inventory. 
Step 5. Calculate the size of the Passive C Sub-pool 
Calculate the size of the passive sub-pool using Equation 5.0d. 
Step 5.1: Calculate decay rate for the PASSIVE SOC sub-pool in the soil (
p
k ). 
Step 5.2: Calculate the steady state stock for the PASSIVE sub-pool SOC stock (
y*
PASSIVE ). 
Step 5.3: Calculate the PASSIVE sub-pool SOC stock by determining the additional increase or decrease in SOC 
from the previous year in the inventory (
y
PASSIVE ).  Note that the initial size of the PASSIVE SOC sub-pool used 
at the start of the inventory period is calculated as defined in step 1. Note also that if the estimated 
p
k  value is 
above 1, then set the value of 
p
k  to 1 in the equation for calculating 
y
PASSIVE . 
Step 5.4: Repeat steps 5.1 to 5.3 to calculate the PASSIVE SOC stocks for all years in the inventory. 
Step 6. Calculate the size of the SLOW SOC Sub-pool 
Calculate the size of the slow sub-pool using Equation 5.0c. 
Step 6.1: Calculate decay rate for SLOW SOC sub-pool in the soil (
sk ). 
Step 6.2: Calculate the steady state stock for the SLOW SOC sub-pool (
y*
SLOW ). 
Step 6.3: Calculate the SLOW SOC stock by determining the additional increase or decrease in SOC from the 
previous year in the inventory (
y
SLOW ).  Note that the initial size of the SLOW SOC sub-pool used at the start of 
the inventory period is calculated as defined in step 1. Note also that if the estimated
sk  value is above 1, then set 
the value of 
sk  to 1 in the equation for calculating 
y
SLOW ). 
Step 6.4: Repeat steps 6.1 to 6.3 to calculate the SLOW SOC sub-pool stocks for all years in the inventory. 
Step 7. Calculate the size of the ACTIVE SOC Sub-pool 
Calculate the size of the active sub-pool using Equation 5.0b.   
Step 7.1: Calculate decay rate for the ACTIVE SOC sub-pool in the soil (
ak ). 
Step 7.2: Calculate the steady state stock for the ACTIVE SOC sub-pool (
y*
ACTIVE ). 
Step 7.3: Calculate the ACTIVE SOC stock by determining the additional increase or decrease in SOC from the 
previous year in the inventory (
y
ACTIVE ).  Note that the initial size of the ACTIVE SOC sub-pool used at the 
start of the inventory period is calculated as defined in step 1. Also note that if the estimated 
ak  value is above 1, 
then set the value of 
ak  to 1 in the equation for calculating (
y
ACTIVE ). 
Step 7.4: Repeat Steps 7.1 to 7.3 to calculate the ACTIVE SOC sub-pool stocks for all years in the inventory.  
Step 8. Calculate the total annual SOC stock change 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
5.26 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Step 8.1: Calculate the SOC stock (
y
SOC ) for each grid cell or region by summing the SOC in the ACTIVE, 
SLOW and PASSIVE sub-pools (
y
ACTIVE , 
y
SLOW  and
y
PASSIVE , respectively) using Equation 5.0a. 
Step 8.2: Calculate the stock change factor (𝐹𝑆𝑂𝐶𝑖) for each grid cell or region using Equation 5.0a. 
Step 8.3: Calculate the total change in SOC stock (
CMineral
) using Equation 5.0a by multiplying the stock change 
factor (𝐹𝑆𝑂𝐶𝑖) by the area of the grid cell or region i ( A ), and summing the changes across all land included in the 
Tier 2 steady-state method. 
Tier 3 
Tier 3 approaches may use dynamic models and/or detailed soil C inventory measurements as the basis for 
estimating annual stock changes. Estimates from models are computed using coupled equations that estimate the 
net change of soil C. A variety of models exist (e.g., see reviews by McGill et al. 1996; and Smith et al. 1997).  
Key criteria in selecting an appropriate model include its capability of representing all of the relevant management 
practices/systems for croplands; model inputs (i.e., driving variables) are compatible with the availability of 
country-wide input data; and verification against experimental data.   
A Tier 3 approach may also be developed using a measurement-based approach in which a monitoring network is 
sampled periodically to estimate soil organic C stock changes.  A much higher density of benchmark sites will 
likely be needed than with models to represent adequately the combination of land-use and management systems, 
climate, and soil types.  Additional guidance is provided in Section 2.3.3.1 of Chapter 2. 
For biochar C amendments to soils, Tier 3 methods can be used to address GHG sources and sinks not captured in 
Tiers 1 or 2, such as priming effects, changes to N2O or CH4 fluxes from soils, and changes to net primary 
production. More information on Tier 3 methods is provided in Section 2.3.3.1 of Chapter 2, Volume IV.

No refinement. 
The 2013 Supplement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories: Wetlands provides 
additional guidance that updates the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for national Greenhouse Gas Inventories. See section 
2.2 of the 2013 Wetlands Supplement covers Tier 1, 2, and 3 approaches for drained organic soils in cropland.   
5.2.3.2 CHOICE OF STOCK CHANGE AND EMISSION FACTORS 
Mineral soils 
Tier 1 
Table 5.5 provides Tier 1 approach default stock change factors for land use (FLU), input (FI) and management 
(FMG).  The method and studies that were used to derive the default stock change factors are provided in Annex 
5A.1 and References. The default time period for stock changes (D) is 20 years and management practice is 
assumed to influence stocks to a depth of 30 cm, which is also the depth for the reference soil C stocks in Table 
2.3 (Chapter 2).  
Tier 2 
Developing Country-Specific Factors for the Default Equations 
A Tier 2 approach entails the estimation of country-specific stock change factors. Derivation of input (FI) and 
management factors (FMG) are based on comparisons to medium input and intensive tillage, respectively, because 
they are considered the nominal practices in the IPCC default management classification (see Choice of Activity 
Data). It is good practice to derive values for a higher resolution classification of management, climate and soil 
types if there are significant differences in the stock change factors among more disaggregated categories based 
on an empirical analysis and/or well tested model. Additional guidance is provided in Chapter 2, Section 2.3.3.1.

Notes: Long-term cultivation, perennial crops paddy rice and tillage management factors were derived using methods provided in Annex 
5A1.  
1Where data were sufficient, separate values were determined for temperate and tropical temperature regimes; and dry, moist, and wet 
moisture regimes. Temperate and tropical zones correspond to those defined in Chapter 3; wet moisture regime corresponds to the combined 
moist and wet zones in the tropics and moist zone in temperate regions.  
2+ two standard deviations, expressed as a percent of the mean; where sufficient studies were not available for a statistical analysis to derive 
a default, uncertainty was assumed to be + 50% based on expert opinion. NA denotes ‘Not Applicable’, where factor values constitute 
defined reference values, and the uncertainties are reflected in the reference C stocks and stock change factors for land use. 
3 This error range does not include potential systematic error due to small sample sizes that may not be representative of the true impact for 
all regions of the world. 
4There were not enough studies to estimate some of the stock change factors for mineral soils in the tropical montane climate region.  As 
an approximation, the average stock change between the temperate and tropical regions was used to approximate the stock change for the 
tropical montane climate.

Reference C stocks can be derived from country-specific data in a Tier 2 approach.  Reference values in Tier 1 
correspond to non-degraded, unimproved lands under native vegetation, but other reference conditions can also be 
chosen for Tier 2. In addition, the depth for evaluating soil C stock changes can be different with the Tier 2 method. 
The effect of tillage on soil carbon stocks can be markedly different for depths above the tillage depth compared 
to below the tillage depth (Angers et al. 1997; Angers and Eriksen-Hamel, 2008; Gal et al. 2017), and including 
soil C stock data below the depth of tillage is necessary to provide an accurate estimate of tillage system effect on 
C stocks.  However, the depth of the reference C stocks (SOCREF) and stock change factors need to the same for all 
land uses (i.e., FLU, FI, and FMG) to ensure consistent application of methods for determining the impact of land 
use change on soil C stocks.. 
The carbon stock estimates may be improved when deriving country-specific factors for FLU and FMG, by 
expressing carbon stocks on a soil-mass equivalent basis rather than a soil-volume equivalent (i.e. fixed depth) 
basis. This is because the soil mass in a certain soil depth changes with the various operations associated with land 
use that affect the density of the soil, such as uprooting, land levelling, tillage, and rain compaction due to the 
disappearance of the cover of tree canopy. However, it is important to realize that all soil C stocks used to derive 
stock change factors across all land uses must be on an equivalent mass basis if this method is applied.  This will 
require necessary soils data to do comprehensively for all land uses. See Box 2.2b in Chapter 2, Section 2.3.3.1 
for more information. 
Biochar C Amendments 
The parameter 𝐹𝑜���𝑒𝑟𝑚𝑝 can be based on H/Corg or O/Corg measured directly from representative samples of biochar, 
or from published data for biochar produced using similar process conditions as the biochar that is applied to soils 
in the country. Tier 2 emission factors may be disaggregated based on variation in environmental conditions, such 
as the climate and soil types, in addition to variation associated with the biochar production methods that generate 
production types defined by the specific feedstock type and conversion process. See Section 2.3.3.1, Chapter 2, 
Volume IV for more information. 
Steady-State Method 
Default parameters are provided for the three-pool steady-state C pool equations (Table 5.5a).  The average lignin 
and nitrogen contents of the C input is also required to estimate the size of the three C pools (See Tables 5.5b and 
5.5c). 
Tier 3 
Constant stock change rate factors per se are less likely to be estimated in favor of variable rates that more 
accurately capture land-use and management effects.  Tier 3 methods for biochar C amendments to soils are 
country-specific and may involve empirical or process-based models to account for a broader set of impacts of 
biochar amendments. More information on Tier 3 methods is provided in Section 2.3.3.1, Chapter 2, Volume IV.

The 2013 Supplement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories: Wetlands provides 
additional guidance that updates the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for national Greenhouse Gas Inventories. See section 
2.2 of the 2013 Wetlands Supplement covers Tier 1, 2, and 3 approaches for drained organic soils in cropland.  
5.2.3.3 CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
Mineral soils 
Tier 1 
Cropland systems are classified by practices that influence soil C storage. The default management classification 
system is provided in Figure 5.1. Inventory compilers should use this classification to categorize management 
systems in a manner consistent with the default Tier 1 stock change factors. This classification may be further 
developed for Tiers 2 and 3 approaches. In general, practices that are known to increase C storage, such as irrigation, 
mineral fertilization, organic amendments, cover crops and high residue yielding crops, have higher inputs, while 
practices that decrease C storage, such as residue burning/removal, bare fallow, and low residue crop varieties, 
have lower inputs.  These practices are used to categorize management systems and then estimate the change in 
soil organic C stocks. Practices should not be considered that are used in less than 1/3 of a given cropping sequence 
(i.e., crop rotation), which is consistent with the classification of experimental data used to estimate the default 
stock change factors. Rice production, perennial croplands, and set-aside lands (i.e., lands removed from 
production) are considered unique management systems (see below). 
Each of the annual cropping systems (low input, medium input, high input, and high input w/organic amendment) 
are further subdivided based on tillage management. Tillage practices are divided into no-till (direct seeding 
without primary tillage and only minimal soil disturbance in the seeding zone; herbicides are typically used for 
weed control), reduced tillage (primary and/or secondary tillage but with reduced soil disturbance that is usually 
shallow and without full soil inversion; normally leaves surface with >30percent coverage by residues at planting) 
and full tillage (substantial soil disturbance with full inversion and/or frequent, within year tillage operations, while 
leaving <30percent of the surface covered by residues at the time of planting). It is good practice only to consider 
reduced and no-till if they are used continuously (every year) because even an occasional pass with a full tillage 
implement will significantly reduce the soil organic C storage expected under the reduced or no-till regimes (Pierce 
et al. 1994; Smith et al. 1998). Assessing the impact of rotational tillage systems (i.e., mixing reduced, no-till 
and/or full tillage practices) on soil C stocks will require a Tier 2 method.

Figure 5.1 
Classification scheme for cropping systems  
In order to classify cropland management systems, the inventory compiler should start at the top and proceed 
through the diagram answering questions (move across branches if answer is yes) until reaching a terminal point 
on the diagram. The classification Diagram is consistent with default stock change factors in Table 5.5.C input 
classes (i.e., low, medium, high and high with organic amendment) are further subdivided by tillage practice. 
 
The main types of land-use activity data are: i) aggregate statistics (Approach 1), ii) data with explicit information 
on land-use conversions but without specific geo-referencing (Approach 2), or iii) data with explicit information 
on land-use conversions and geo-referencing (Approach 3), such as land-use and management inventories making 
up a statistically-based sample of a country’s land area (see Chapter 3 for discussion of approaches). At a minimum, 
globally available land-use and crop production statistics, such as FAO databases (http://www.fao.org/faostat), 
provide annual compilations of total land area by major land-uses, select management data (e.g., irrigated vs. non-
irrigated cropland), land area in ‘perennial’ crops (i.e., vineyards, perennial herbaceous crops, and tree-based crops 
such as orchards) and annual crops (e.g., wheat, rice, maize, sorghum, etc.). FAO databases would be an example 
of aggregate data (Approach 1).

2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
5.35 
Management activity data supplement the land-use data, providing information to classify management systems, 
such as crop types and rotations, tillage practices, irrigation, manure application, residue management, etc.  These 
data can also be aggregate statistics (Approach 1) or information on explicit management changes (Approach 2 or 
3). Where possible, it is good practice to determine the specific management practices for land areas associated 
with cropping systems (e.g., rotations and tillage practice), rather than only area by crop.  Remote sensing data are 
a valuable resource for land-use and management activity data, and potentially, expert knowledge is another source 
of information for cropping practices. It is good practice to elicit expert knowledge using methods provided in 
Volume 1, Chapter 2 (eliciting expert knowledge). 
National land-use and resource inventories, based on repeated surveys of the same locations, constitute activity 
data gathered using Approach 2 or 3, and have some advantages over aggregated land-use and cropland 
management data (Approach 1). Time series data can be more readily associated with a particular cropping system 
(i.e., combination of crop type and management over a series of years), and the soil type can be determined by 
sampling or by referencing the location to a suitable soil map. Inventory points that are selected based on an 
appropriate statistical design also enable estimates of the variability associated with activity data, which can be 
used as part of a formal uncertainty analysis. An example of a survey using Approach 3 is the National Resource 
Inventory in the U.S. (Nusser and Goebel, 1997). 
Activity data require additional in-country information to stratify areas by climate and soil types. If such 
information has not already been compiled, an initial approach would be to overlay available land cover/land-use 
maps (of national origin or from global datasets such as IGBP_DIS) with soil and climate maps of national origin 
or global sources, such as the FAO Soils Map of the World and climate data from the United Nations 
Environmental Program. A detailed description of the default climate and soil classification schemes is provided 
in Chapter 3, Annex 3A.5. The soil classification is based on soil taxonomic description and textural data, while 
climate regions are based on mean annual temperatures and precipitation, elevation, occurrence of frost, and 
potential evapotranspiration. 
Tier 2 
Developing Country-Specific Factors for the Default Equations 
Tier 2 approaches are likely to involve a more detailed stratification of management systems than in Tier 1 (see 
Figure 5.1) if sufficient data are available. This can include further within country subdivisions of annual cropping 
input categories (i.e., low, medium, high, and high with amendment), rice cultivation, perennial cropping systems, 
and set-asides.  It is good practice to further subdivide default classes based on empirical data that demonstrates 
significant differences in soil organic C storage among the proposed categories.  In addition, Tier 2 approaches 
can involve a finer stratification of climate regions and soil types. 
For Tier 2, the specific definitions of management and input factors are typically made to match available activity 
data on how an activity affects C stocks. For example, if a country has management factors related to specific 
tillage practices that involve a mix of intensities over time, then the country will also need activity data on those 
specific tillage practices to apply the country-specific factors. 
Biochar C Amendments 
For biochar C amendments, the activity data required for the Tier 2 method includes the total quantities of biochar 
distributed as amendment to mineral soils. These data must be disaggregated by production type, where production 
type is defined as a process utilizing a specific feedstock type, and a specific conversion process. Changes in soil 
C associated with biochar amendments are considered to occur where it is incorporated into soil. However, due to 
the distributed nature of the land sector in which this can take place, inventory compilers may not have access to 
data on when or where biochar C amendments occur. Inventory compilers may be able to compile data on the total 
amount of biochar applied to cropland mineral soils from biochar producers, exporters, importers, distributors 
and/or from those applying biochar to cropland in the country. Note that exported biochar is not included in the 
total amount of biochar amended to soils in the country.  
Additionally, activity data on the amount of biochar amendments may be disaggregated by climate zones and/or 
soil types if country-specific factors are disaggregated by these environmental variables. The additional climate 
and soil activity data may be obtained with a survey of biochar distributors and land managers.  
Steady-State Method 
This method requires soil C input data based on the amount of biomass that is converted to dead organic matter 
annually. This rate will vary depending on the crop production, management activity, and other environmental 
variables. Removals or reductions in dead organic matter are subtracted from the C input amount, which could 
occur with livestock grazing, grassland burning, or harvesting of grass for feed or bioenergy. Additions of C, 
particularly organic amendments such as manure, are included in the estimate of C input.  
It is good practice to estimate C input using country-specific factors in order to produce more accurate estimates.  
If country-specific factors are not available, Equation 5.0h can be used to estimate C inputs with global factors

Data on crop yield statistics (yields and area harvested, by crop) may be obtained from national sources. If such 
data are not available, FAO publishes data on crop production: (http://faostat.fao.org/). Tillage management data 
are also required (proportion of full tillage, reduced tillage and no-till), and irrigation data for any lands that are 
provided supplement water (proportion of land). Monthly average temperature, precipitation and potential 
evapotranspiration is needed for each grid cell or region.  This information is available from global datasets, such 
as the CRU climate dataset (https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/hrg/), if country-specific data are not available. The 
average sand content is needed for each grid cell or region, which is available from Harmonized World Soil 
Database (http://webarchive.iiasa.ac.at/Research/LUC/External-World-soil-database/HTML/).  
Tier 3 
For application of dynamic models and/or a direct measurement-based inventory in Tier 3, similar or more detailed 
data on the combinations of climate, soil, topographic and management data are needed, relative to the Tiers 1 and 
2 methods, but the exact requirements will depend on the model or measurement design. 
For biochar C amendments, the additional activity data required to support a Tier 3 method will depend on which 
processes are represented and which environmental variables that are required as input to the model.  Priming 
effects, soil GHG emissions, and plant production responses to biochar all vary with biochar type, climate, and 
soil type. Furthermore, soil GHG emissions and plant production responses also vary with crop type and 
management. Therefore, Tier 3 methods may require environmental data on climate zones, soil types, crop types 
and crop management systems (such as nitrogen fertilizer application rates, and whether soils are flooded for paddy 
rice production), in addition to the amount of biochar amendments in each of the individual combinations of strata 
for the environmental variables. More detailed activity data specifying the process conditions for biochar 
production or the physical and chemical characteristics of the biochar may also be required (such as surface area, 
cation exchange capacity, pH, and ash content).

5.2.3.4 CALCULATION STEPS FOR TIER 1 
Mineral soils 
The steps for estimating SOC0 and SOC(0-T) and net soil C stock change per ha for Cropland Remaining Cropland 
on mineral soils are as follows: 
Step 1: Organize data into inventory time periods based on the years in which activity data were collected (e.g., 
1990 to 1995, 1995 to 2000, etc.) 
Step 2: Determine the amount Cropland Remaining Cropland by mineral soil types and climate regions in the 
country at the beginning of the first inventory time period.  The first year of the inventory time period will depend 
on the time step of the activity data (0-T; e.g., 5, 10 or 20 years ago). 
Step 3: Classify each Cropland into the appropriate management system using Figure 5.1.   
 
8 This term is included in the equation to account for N release and the subsequent increases in N2O emissions (e.g., van der 
Weerden et al., 1999; Davies et al., 2001), from renewal/cultivation of grazed grass or grass/clover pasture and other forage 
crops. 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
5.38 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Step 4: Assign a native reference C stock values (SOCREF) from Table 2.3 based on climate and soil type.   
Step 5: Assign a land-use factor (FLU), management factor (FMG) and C input levels (FI) to each Cropland based 
on the management classification (Step 2).  Values for FLU, FMG and FI are given in Table 5.6.  
Step 6: Multiply the factors (FLU, FMG, FI) by the reference soil C stock (SOCREF) to estimate an ‘initial’ soil 
organic C stock (SOC(0-T)) for the inventory time period.    
Step 7: Estimate the final soil organic C stock (SOC0) by repeating Steps 1 to 5 using the same native reference 
C stock (SOCREF), but with land-use, management and input factors that represent conditions for each cropland in 
the last (year 0) inventory year.  
Step 8: Estimate the average annual change in soil organic C stocks for Cropland Remaining Cropland (∆CMineral) 
by subtracting the ‘initial’ soil organic C stock (SOC(0-T)) from the final soil organic C stock (SOC0), and then 
dividing by the time dependence of the stock change factors (i.e., 20 years using the default factors).  If an inventory 
time period is greater than 20 years, then divide by the difference in the initial and final year of the time period.  
Step 9: Repeat steps 2 to 8 if there are additional inventory time periods (e.g., 1990 to 2000, 2001 to 2010, etc.). 
A numerical example is given below for Cropland Remaining Cropland on mineral soils, using Equation 2.25 and 
default reference C stocks (Table 2.3) and stock change factors (Table 5.6). 
Example: The following example shows calculations for aggregate areas of cropland soil carbon 
stock change. In a warm temperate wet climate on high activity clay soils there are 1Mha of 
permanent annual cropland. The native reference carbon stock (SOCREF) for the region is 64 tonnes 
C ha-1. At the beginning of the inventory calculation period (in this example, 10 yrs earlier in 1990), 
the distribution of cropland systems were 400,000 ha of annual cropland with low carbon input levels 
and full tillage and 600,000 ha of annual cropland with medium input levels and full tillage. Thus, 
initial soil carbon stocks for the area were:  
400,000 ha ● (64 tonnes C ha-1 ● 0.75 ● 1 ● 0.92) + 600,000 ha ● (64 tonnes C ha-1 ● 0.75 ● 1 ● 1) 
= 46.46 million tonnes C.  
In the last year of the inventory time period (in this example, the last year is 2000), there are: 200,000 
ha of annual cropping with full tillage and low C input, 700,000 ha of annual cropping with reduced 
tillage and medium C input, and 100,000 ha of annual cropping with no-till and medium C input. 
Thus, total soil carbon stocks based on the inventory year are:  
200,000 ha ● (64 tonnes C ha-1 ● 0.75 ● 1 ● 0.92) + 700,000 ha ● (64 tonnes C ha-1 ● 0.75 ● 1.01 
● 1) + 100,000 ha ● (64 tonnes C ha-1 ● 0.75 ● 1.11 ● 1) = 49.06 million tonnes C.  
Thus, the average annual stock change over the period for the entire area is: 49;06 – 46.46 = 2.60 
million tonnes/20 yr = 130000 tonnes C per year soil C stock increase (Note: 20 years is the time 
dependence of the stock change factor, i.e., factor represents annual rate of change over 20 years).

5.3.1 
Biomass 
5.3.1.1 CHOICE OF METHOD 
This section provides guidance on methods for calculating carbon stock change in biomass due to the conversion 
of land from natural conditions and other uses to Cropland, including deforestation and conversion of pasture and 
grazing lands to Cropland. The methods require estimates of carbon in biomass stocks prior to and following 
conversion, based on estimates of the areas of lands converted during the period between land-use surveys. As a 
result of conversion to Cropland, it is assumed (in Tier 1) that the dominant vegetation is removed entirely leading 
to emissions, resulting in near zero amounts of carbon remaining in biomass. Some type of cropping system is 
planted soon thereafter increasing the amount of carbon stored in biomass. The difference between initial and final 
biomass carbon pools is used to calculate carbon stock change from land-use conversion;  and in subsequent years 
accumulations and losses in perennial woody biomass in Cropland are counted using methods in Section 5.2.1 
(Cropland Remaining Cropland).  
It is good practice to consider all carbon pools (i.e., above ground and below ground biomass, dead organic matter, 
and soils) in estimating changes in carbon stocks in Land Converted to Cropland. Currently, there is insufficient 
information to provide a default approach with default parameters to estimate carbon stock change in dead organic 
matter (DOM) pools9. DOM is unlikely to be important except in the year of conversion. It is assumed that there 
will be no DOM in Cropland. In addition, the methodology below considers only carbon stock change in above-
ground biomass since limited data are available on below-ground carbon stocks in perennial Cropland. 
The IPCC Guidelines describe increasingly sophisticated alternatives that incorporate greater detail on the areas 
of land converted, carbon stocks on lands, and loss of carbon resulting from land conversions. It is good practice 
to adopt the appropriate tier depending on key source analysis, data availability and national circumstances. All 
countries should strive for improving inventory and reporting approaches by advancing to the highest tier possible 
given national circumstances. It is good practice for countries to use a Tier 2 or Tier 3 approach if carbon emissions 
and removals in Land Converted to Cropland is a key category and if the sub-category of biomass is considered 
significant based on principles outlined in Volume 1, Chapter 4. Countries should use the decision tree in Figure 
1.3 to help with the choice of method. Land Converted to Cropland is likely to be a key category for many countries 
and further biomass is likely to be a key source.  
Tier 1 
The Tier 1 method follows the approach in Chapter 4 (Forest Land) where the amount of biomass that is cleared 
for cropland is estimated by multiplying the area converted in one year by the average carbon stock in biomass in 
the Forest Land or Grassland prior to conversion. It is good practice to account completely for all land conversions 
to Cropland. Thus, this section elaborates on the method such that it includes different initial uses, including but 
not limited to forests.  
Equation 2.15 in Chapter 2 summarises the major elements of a first-order estimation of carbon stock change from 
land-use conversion to Cropland. Average carbon stock change on a per hectare basis is estimated for each type 
of conversion. The average carbon stock change is equal to the carbon stock change due to the removal of biomass 
from the initial land use (i.e., carbon in biomass immediately after conversion minus the carbon in biomass prior 
to conversion), plus carbon stocks from one year of growth in Cropland following conversion. It is necessary to 
account only for any woody vegetation that replaces the vegetation that was cleared during land-use conversion. 
The GPG-LULUCF combines carbon in biomass after conversion and carbon in biomass that grows on the land 
following conversion into a single term. In this method, they are separated into two terms, BAFTER and CG to 
increase transparency.  
As described in section 5.3.1.1., at Tier 1, carbon stocks in biomass immediately after conversion (BAFTER) are 
assumed to be zero, since the land is cleared of all vegetation before planting crops. Average carbon stock change 
per hectare for a given land-use conversion is multiplied by the estimated area of lands undergoing such a 
conversion in a given year. In subsequent years, change in biomass of annual crops is considered zero because 
carbon gains in biomass from annual growth are offset by losses from harvesting. Changes in biomass of perennial 
woody crops are counted following the methodology in Section 2.3.1.1 (Change in carbon stocks in biomass in 
 
9 Any litter and dead wood pools (estimated using the methods described in Chapter 2, Section 2.3.2) should be assumed 
oxidized following land conversion. 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
5.40 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
land remaining in a land-use category) and Section 5.2.1 (Change in carbon stocks in biomass in cropland 
remaining cropland). Thus, carbon gain of an annual crop is estimated only for the first year following a conversion, 
whereas, carbon gains and losses of perennial woody crop may also occur in subsequent years up to 20 years (at 
maximum).  
The default assumption for Tier 1 is that all carbon in biomass removed is lost to the atmosphere through burning 
or decay processes either on-site or off-site. Tier 1 calculations do not differentiate immediate emissions from 
burning and other conversion related losses.   
Tier 2 
The Tier 2 calculations are structurally similar to Tier 1, with the following distinctions. First, Tier 2 relies largely 
on country-specific estimates of the carbon stocks in initial and final land uses rather than the default data. Area 
estimates for Land Converted to Cropland are disaggregated according to original vegetation (e.g., from Forest 
Land or Grassland) at finer spatial scales to capture regional and crop systems variations in country-specific carbon 
stocks values. 
Second, Tier 2 may modify the assumption that carbon stocks immediately following conversion are zero. This 
enables countries to take into account land-use transitions where some, but not all, vegetation from the original 
land use is removed. 
Third, under Tier 2, it is good practice to apportion carbon losses to burning and decay processes if applicable. 
Emissions of carbon dioxide occur as a result of burning and decay in land-use conversions. Further, non-CO2 
trace gas emissions occur as a result of burning. By partitioning losses to burning and decay, countries can also 
calculate non-CO2 trace gas emissions from burning (Section 5.3.4).  
The immediate impacts of land conversion activities on the five carbon stocks can be summarized in a disturbance 
matrix, which describes the retention, transfers and releases of carbon in the pools in the original ecosystem 
following conversion to Cropland. A disturbance matrix defines for each pool the proportion that remains in that 
pool and the proportion that is transferred to other pools. A small number of transfers are possible and are outlined 
in a disturbance matrix in Table 5.7. The disturbance matrix ensures consistency of the accounting of all carbon 
pools.

Impossible transitions are blacked out. 
Biomass transfers to dead wood and litter can be estimated using Equation 2.20. 
Tier 3 
The Tier 3 method is similar to Tier 2, with the following distinctions: i) rather than relying on average annual 
rates of conversion, countries can use direct estimates of spatially disaggregated areas converted annually for each 
initial and final land use; ii) carbon densities and soil carbon stock change are based on locally specific information, 
which makes possible a dynamic link between biomass and soil; and iii) biomass volumes are based on actual 
inventories. The transfer of biomass, to dead wood and litter following land-use conversion can be estimated using 
Equation 2.20.

5.3.1.2 CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTORS 
The emission/removal factors needed for the default method are: carbon stocks before conversion in the initial 
land use and after conversion to Cropland; and growth in biomass carbon stock from one year of cropland growth. 
Tier 1 
Default biomass carbon stock in initial land-use categories (BBEFORE) mainly Forest Land and Grassland are 
provided in Updated Table 5.8. Initial land-use based carbon stocks should be obtained for different Forest Land 
or Grassland categories based on biome type, climate, soil management systems, etc. It is assumed that all biomass 
is cleared when preparing a site for cropland use, thus, the default for BAFTER is 0 tonne C ha-1.  
In addition, a value is needed for carbon stocks after one year of growth in crops planted after conversion (CG). 
Updated Table 5.9 provides general defaults for annual and perennial crop for CG while updated Table 5.3 
provides defaults for specific perennial crops. Separate defaults are provided for annual non-woody crops and 
perennial woody crops. For lands planted in annual crops, the default value of CG is 4.7 tonnes of C per hectare, 
based on the original IPCC Guidelines recommendation of 10 tonnes of dry biomass per hectare (dry biomass has 
been converted to tonnes carbon in Table 5.9). The total accumulation of carbon in perennial woody biomass will, 
over time, exceed that of the default carbon stock for annual cropland. However, default values provided in this 
section are for one year of growth immediately following conversion, which usually give lower carbon stocks for 
perennial woody crops compared to annual crops.

are converted to grassland or cropland is not likely to be typical of the forest type, i.e. the carbon stocks are 
probably lower than average. It is good practice for countries to evaluate country specific values for disturbed 
forest under Tier 2. 
Default parameters for emissions from burning and decay are provided. However, countries are encouraged to 
develop country-specific coefficients to improve the accuracy of estimates. The IPCC Guidelines use a general 
default of 0.5 for the proportion of biomass burnt on-site for both Forest Land and Grassland conversions. Research 
studies suggest that the fraction is highly variable and could be as low as 0.2 (Fearnside, 2000; Barbosa and 
Fearnside, 1996; and Fearnside, 1990). Updated default proportions of biomass burnt on-site are provided in 
Chapter 4 (Forest Land) for a range of forest vegetation classes. These defaults should be used for transitions from 
Forest Land to Cropland. For non-forest initial land uses, the default proportion of biomass left on-site and burnt 
is 0.35. This default takes into consideration research, which suggests the fraction should fall within the range 0.2 
to 0.5 (e.g., Fearnside, 2000; Barbosa and Fearnside, 1996; and Fearnside, 1990). It is good practice for countries 
to use 0.35 or another value within this range, provided that the rationale for the choice is documented. There is 
no default value for the amount of biomass taken off-site and burnt; countries will need to develop a proportion 
based on national data sources. In Chapter 4 (Forest Land), the default proportion of biomass oxidized as a result 
of burning is 0.9, as originally stated in the GPG-LULUCF. 
The method for estimating emissions from decay assumes that all biomass decays over a period of 10 years. For 
reporting purposes countries have two options: 1) report all emissions from decay in one year, recognizing that in 
reality they occur over a 10 year period, and 2) report all emission from decay on an annual basis, estimating the 
rate as one tenth of the totals. If countries choose the latter option, they should add a multiplication factor of 0.10 
to the equation. 
Tier 3 
Under Tier 3, all parameters should be country-defined using measurements and monitoring for more accurate 
values rather than the defaults. Process based models and decay functions can also be used. 
5.3.1.3 CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
All tiers require estimates of land areas converted to Cropland. The same area estimates should be used for both 
biomass and soil C calculations on Land Converted to Cropland. Higher tiers require greater specificity of areas. 
At a minimum, the area of Forest Land and natural Grassland converted to Cropland should be identified separately 
for all tiers. This implies at least some knowledge of the land uses prior to conversion. This may also require expert 
judgment if Approach 1 in Chapter 3 of these guidelines is used for land area identification.  
Tier 1 
Separate estimates are required of areas converted to Cropland from initial land uses (i.e., Forest Land, Grassland, 
Settlements, etc.) to final crop land type (i.e., annual or perennial) (ATO_OTHERS). For example, countries should 
estimate separately the area of tropical moist forest converted to annual cropland, tropical moist forest converted 
to perennial cropland, tropical moist Grassland converted to perennial cropland, etc. Although, to allow other pools 
to equilibrate and for consistency with land area estimation overall, land areas should remain in the conversion 
category for 20 years (or other period reflecting national circumstances) following conversion. The methodology 
assumes that area estimates are based on a one-year time frame, which is likely to require estimation on the basis 
of average rates on land-use conversion, determined by measurements estimates made at longer intervals. If 
countries do not have these data, partial samples may be extrapolated to the entire land base or historic estimates 
of conversions may be extrapolated over time based on the judgement of country experts. Under Tier 1 calculations, 
international statistics such as FAO databases, GPG-LULUCF and other sources, supplemented with sound 
assumptions, can be used to estimate the area of Land Converted to Cropland from each initial land use. For higher 
tier calculations, country-specific data sources are used to estimate all possible transitions from initial land use to 
final crop type.  For perennial woody cropland, the total area of planted perennial woody crops for the age classes 
within the maturing/harvesting cycle (up to 20 years) is required to estimate all biomass carbon change (CG). See 
section 5.2.1.3 for details. 
Tier 2 
It is good practice for countries to use actual area estimates for all possible transitions from initial land use to final 
crop type. Full coverage of land areas can be accomplished either through analysis of periodic remotely sensed 
images of land-use and land cover patterns, through periodic ground-based sampling of land-use patterns, or hybrid 
inventory systems. If finer resolution country-specific data are partially available, countries are encouraged to use 
sound assumptions from best available knowledge to extrapolate to the entire land base. Historic estimates of 
conversions may be extrapolated over time based on the judgment of country experts.

Tier 3 
Activity data used in Tier 3 calculations should be a full accounting of all land-use transitions to Cropland and be 
disaggregated to account for different conditions within a country. Disaggregation can occur along political 
(county, province, etc.), biome, climate, or on a combination of such parameters. In many cases, countries may 
have information on multi-year trends in land conversion (from periodic sample-based or remotely sensed 
inventories of land use and land cover). Periodic land-use change matrix need to be developed giving the initial 
and final land-use areas at disaggregated level based on remote sensing and field surveys.5.3.1.4

Soil carbon 
Land is typically converted to Cropland from native lands, managed Forest Land and Grassland, but occasionally 
conversions can occur from Wetlands and seldom Settlements. Regardless of soil type (i.e., mineral or organic), 
the conversion of land to Cropland will, in most cases, result in a loss of soil C for some years following conversion 
(Mann, 1986; Armentano and Menges, 1986; Davidson and Ackerman, 1993). Possible exceptions are irrigation 
of formerly arid lands and conversion of degraded lands to Cropland.  
General information and guidance for estimating changes in soil C stocks are provided in Section 2.3.3 of Chapter 
2 (including equations), and that section needs to be read before proceeding with a consideration of specific 
guidelines dealing with cropland soil C stocks. The total change in soil C stocks for Land Converted to Cropland 
is estimated using Equation 2.24 (Chapter 2), which combines the change in soil organic C stocks (SOC stocks) 
for mineral soils and organic soils; and stock changes associated with soil inorganic C pools (Tier 3 only). This 
section provides specific guidance for estimating soil organic C stock changes; see Section 2.3.3.1 for discussion 
on soil inorganic C (no additional guidance is provided in the Cropland section below). 
To account for changes in soil C stocks associated with Land Converted to Cropland, countries need to have, at a 
minimum, estimates of the areas of Land Converted to Cropland during the inventory time period. If land-use and 
management data are limited, aggregate data, such as FAO statistics, can be used as a starting point, along with 
knowledge of country experts of the approximate distribution of land-use types being converted and their 
associated management. If the previous land uses and conversions are unknown, SOC stocks changes can still be 
computed using the methods provided in Cropland Remaining Cropland, but the land base area will likely be 
different for croplands in the current year relative to the initial year in the inventory. It is critical, however, that 
the total land area across all land-use sectors be equal over the inventory time period (e.g., 7 million ha may be 
converted from Forest Land and Grassland to Cropland during the inventory time period, meaning that croplands 
will have an additional 7 Million ha in the last year of the inventory, while grasslands and forests will have a 
corresponding loss of 7 Million ha in the last year). Land Converted to Cropland is stratified according to climate 
regions and major soil types, which could either be based on default or country-specific classifications. This can 
be accomplished with overlays of climate and soil maps, coupled with spatially-explicit data on the location of 
land conversions. 
5.3.3.1 CHOICE OF METHOD 
Inventories can be developed using a Tier 1, 2 or 3 approach with each successive tier requiring more detail and 
resources than the previous one.  It is also possible that countries will use different tiers to prepare estimates for 
the separate subcategories of soil C (i.e., soil organic C stocks changes in mineral soils and organic soils; and stock 
changes associated with soil inorganic C pools). Decision trees are provided for mineral soils (Figure 2.5) and 
organic soils (Figure 2.6) in Section 2.3.3.1 (Chapter 2) to assist inventory compilers with selection of the 
appropriate tier for their soil C inventory. 
Mineral soils 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
5.44 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Tier 1 
Soil organic C stock changes for mineral soils can be estimated for land-use conversion to Cropland using Equation 
2.25 in Chapter 2. For Tier 1, the initial (pre-conversion) soil organic C stock (SOC(0-T)) and C stock in the last 
year of the inventory time period (SOC0) are computed from the default reference soil organic C stocks (SOCREF) 
and default stock change factors (FLU, FMG, FI). Annual rates of stock changes are estimated as the difference in 
stocks (over time) divided by the time dependence (D) of the Cropland stock change factors (default is 20 years).     
Tier 2 
The Tier 2 method for mineral soils also uses Equation 2.25, but involves country-specific or region-specific 
reference C stocks and/or stock change factors and may include disaggregated land-use activity and environmental 
data. Tier 2 methods for biochar C amendments utilize a top-down approach in which the total amount of biochar 
generated and added to mineral soil is used to estimate the change in soil organic C stocks  with country-specific 
factors. See Section 2.3.3.1, Chapter 2, Volume IV for more information. 
Tier 3 
Tier 3 methods will involve more detailed and country-specific models and/or measurement-based approaches 
along with highly disaggregated land-use and management data. Tier 3 approaches estimate soil C change from 
land-use conversions to Cropland, and may employ models, data sets and/or monitoring networks. If possible, it 
is recommended that Tier 3 methods be integrated with estimates of biomass removal and the post-clearance 
treatment of plant residues (including woody debris and litter), as variation in the removal and treatment of residues 
(e.g., burning, site preparation) will affect C inputs to soil organic matter formation and C losses through 
decomposition and combustion. It is important that models be evaluated with independent observations from 
country-specific or region-specific field locations that are representative of the interactions of climate, soil and 
cropland management on post-conversion change in soil C stocks. 
Tier 3 methods for biochar C amendments can be used to address GHG sources and sinks not captured in Tiers 1 
or 2, such as priming effects, changes to N2O or CH4 fluxes from soils, and changes to net primary production. 
More information on Tier 3 methods is provided in Section 2.3.3.1 of Chapter 2, Volume IV.

The 2013 Supplement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories: Wetlands provides 
additional guidance that updates the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for national Greenhouse Gas Inventories. See section 
2.2 of the 2013 Wetlands Supplement covers Tier 1, 2, and 3 approaches for drained organic soils in cropland.   
5.3.3.2 CHOICE OF STOCK CHANGE AND EMISSION FACTORS 
Mineral soils 
Tier 1 
For native unmanaged land, as well as for managed forest lands, settlements and nominally managed grasslands 
with low disturbance regimes, soil C stocks are assumed equal to the reference values (i.e., land-use, disturbance 
(forests only), management and input factors equal 1), while it will be necessary to apply the appropriate stock 
change factors to represent previous land-use systems that are not the reference condition, such as improved and 
degraded grasslands.  It will also be necessary to apply the appropriate stock change factor to represent input and 
management effects on soil C storage in the new cropland system. Default reference C stocks are found in Table 
2.3 (Chapter 2).  See the appropriate land-use chapter for default stock change factors.  
In the case of transient land-use conversions to Cropland, the stock change factors are given in Table 5.10, and 
depend on the length of the fallow (vegetation recovery) cycle in a shifting cultivation system, representing an 
average soil C stock over the crop-fallow cycle. Mature fallow denotes situations where the non-cropland 
vegetation (e.g., forests) recovers to a mature or near mature state prior to being cleared again for cropland use, 
whereas in shortened fallow, vegetation recovery is not attained prior to re-clearing. If land already in shifting-
cultivation is converted to permanent Cropland (or other land uses), the stock change factors representing shifting 
cultivation would provide the ‘initial’ C stocks (SOC(0-T)) in the calculations using Equation 2.25 (Chapter 2).

Tier 2 
Estimation of country-specific stock change factors is probably the most important development associated with 
the Tier 2 approach. Differences in soil organic C stocks among land uses are computed relative to a reference 
condition, using land-use factors (FLU). Input factors (FI) and management factors (FMG) are then used to further 
refine the C stocks of the new cropland system. Additional guidance on how to derive these stock change factors 
is given in Croplands Remaining Croplands, Section 5.2.3.2. See the appropriate chapter for specific information 
regarding the derivation of stock change factors for other land-use categories (Forest Land in Section 4.2.3.2, 
Grassland in 6.2.3.2, Settlements in 8.2.3.2, and Other Land in 9.3.3.2).  
Reference C stocks can be derived from country-specific data in a Tier 2 approach. Reference values in Tier 1 
correspond to non-degraded, unimproved lands under native vegetation, but other reference conditions can also be 
chosen for Tier 2. In addition, the depth for evaluating soil C stock changes can be different with the Tier 2 method 
(see also section 6.2.3.1). However, the depth of the reference C stocks (SOCREF) and stock change factors needs 
to be the same for all land uses (i.e., FLU, FI, and FMG) to ensure consistency in the application of methods for 
estimating the impact of land use change on soil C stocks. 
The Tier 1 method may over- or under-estimate soil C stock changes on an annual basis, particularly with land use 
change (e.g., Villarino et al. 2014). Therefore, land use change, such as Cropland converted to Grassland, may 
include development of factors that estimate changes over longer periods of time than the default 20 years, and 
may better match the period of time over which carbon accumulates or is lost from soils due to land use change.  
When C stock changes extend over periods of many decades, activity data for historical land-use change are needed 
to estimate the soil C stock changes that are still occurring in the current inventory year. 
The carbon stock estimates may be improved when deriving country-specific factors for FLU and FMG, by 
expressing carbon stocks on a soil-mass equivalent basis rather than a soil-volume equivalent (i.e. fixed depth) 
basis. This is because the soil mass in a certain soil depth changes with the various operations associated with land 
use that affect the density of the soil, such as uprooting, land levelling, tillage, and rain compaction due to the 
disappearance of the cover of tree canopy. However, it is important to realize that all data used to derive stock 
change factors across all land uses must be on an equivalent mass basis if this method is applied. This will be 
challenging to do comprehensively for all land uses. See Box 2.2b in Chapter 2, Section 2.3.3.1 for more 
information. 
For biochar C amendments, the parameter 𝐹𝑜���𝑒𝑟𝑚𝑝 can be based on H/Corg or O/Corg measured directly from 
representative samples of biochar, or from published data for biochar produced using similar process conditions 
as the biochar that is applied to soils in the country. Tier 2 emission factors may be disaggregated based on variation 
in environmental conditions, such as the climate and soil types, in addition to variation associated with the biochar 
production methods that generate production types defined by the feedstock type and conversion process. See 
Section 2.3.3.1, Chapter 2, Volume IV for more information.  
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
5.46 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Country-specific emission factors (i.e., permanence factors) for biochar C for croplands may be different from the 
past land use for Land Converted to Cropland, and these differences need to be addressed in the calculations.  This 
requires estimating the biochar carbon stocks from past biochar carbon additions that remain in Land Converted 
to Cropland after conversion. The biochar C stocks are then subject to the conditions for cropland, which may lead 
some additional loss of biochar C. 
Tier 3 
Constant stock change rate factors per se are less likely to be estimated in favor of variable rates that more 
accurately capture land-use and management effects.  
Tier 3 methods for biochar C amendments are country-specific and may involve empirical or process-based models 
to account for a broader set of impacts of biochar amendments. These methods will likely estimate biochar C 
stocks and associated changes over time so the biochar C stocks in Land Converted to Cropland will need to be 
tracked through the land use change process.  
More information on Tier 3 methods is provided in Section 2.3.3.1, Chapter 2, Volume IV.

5.3.3.3 CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
Mineral soils 
Tier 1 and Tier 2 - Default Equations 
For purposes of estimating soil carbon stock change, area estimates of Land Converted to Cropland should be 
stratified according to major climate regions and soil types. This can be based on overlays with suitable climate 
and soil maps and spatially-explicit data of the location of land conversions. Detailed descriptions of the default 
climate and soil classification schemes are provided in Chapter 3, Annex 3A.5. Specific information is provided 
in the each of the land-use chapters regarding treatment of land-use/management activity data (Forest Land in 
Section 4.2.3.3, Cropland in 5.2.3.3, Grassland in 6.2.3.3, Settlements in 8.2.3.3, and Other Land in 9.3.3.3).   
One critical issue in evaluating the impact of Land Converted to Cropland on soil organic C stocks is the type of 
land-use and management activity data. Activity data gathered using Approach 2 or 3 (see Chapter 3 for discussion 
about approaches) provide the underlying basis for determining the previous land use for Land Converted to 
Cropland. In contrast, aggregate data (Approach 1, Chapter 3) only provide the total amount of area in each land 
at the beginning and end of the inventory period (e.g., 1985 and 2005). Approach 1 data are not sufficient to 
determine specific transitions. In this case all Cropland will be reported in the Cropland Remaining Cropland 
category and in effect transitions become step changes across the landscape. This makes it particularly important 
to achieve coordination among all land sectors to ensure that the total land base is remaining constant over time, 
given that some land area will be lost and gained within individual sectors during each inventory year due to land-
use change. 
For biochar C amendments, the activity data for the Tier 2 method includes the total quantities of biochar 
distributed as amendment to mineral soils. These data must be disaggregated by production type, where production 
type is defined as a process utilizing a specific feedstock type, and a specific conversion process. Changes in soil 
C associated with biochar amendments are considered to occur where it is incorporated into soil. However, due to 
the distributed nature of the land sector in which this can take place, inventory compilers may not have access to 
data on when or where biochar C amendments occur. Inventory compilers may be able to compile data on the total 
amount of biochar applied to cropland mineral soils from biochar producers, distributors and/or from those 
applying biochar to cropland in the country. Note that exported biochar is not included in the total amount of 
biochar amended to soils in the country. 
Additionally, activity data on the amount of biochar amendments may be disaggregated by climate zones and/or 
soil types if country-specific factors are disaggregated by these environmental variables. The additional climate 
and soil activity data may be obtained with a survey of biochar distributors and land managers.   
Tier 3 
For application of dynamic models and/or a direct measurement-based inventory in Tier 3, similar or more detailed 
data on the combinations of climate, soil, topographic and management data are needed, relative to Tier 1 or 2 
methods, but the exact requirements will be dependent on the model or measurement design.    
 
Chapter 5: Cropland 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
5.47 
For biochar C, the additional activity data required to support a Tier 3 method will depend on which processes are 
represented and environmental variables that are required as input to the model. Priming effects, soil GHG 
emissions, and plant production responses to biochar all vary with biochar type, climate, and soil type. Furthermore, 
soil GHG emissions and plant production responses also vary with crop type and management. Therefore, Tier 3 
methods may require environmental data on climate zones, soil types, crop types and crop management systems 
(such as nitrogen fertilizer application rates, and whether soils are flooded for paddy rice production), in addition 
to the amount of biochar amendments in each of the individual combinations of strata for the environmental 
variables. More detailed activity data specifying the process conditions for biochar production or the physical and 
chemical characteristics of the biochar may also be required (such as surface area, cation exchange capacity, pH, 
and ash content).

2.2 of the 2013 Wetlands Supplement covers Tier 1, 2, and 3 approaches for drained organic soils in cropland.   
5.3.3.4 CALCULATION STEPS FOR TIER 1 
Mineral soils 
The steps for estimating SOC0 and SOC(0-T) and net soil C stock change per ha of Land Converted to Cropland on 
mineral soils are as follows: 
Step 1: Organize data into inventory time periods based on the years in which activity data were collected (e.g., 
1990 to 1995, 1995 to 2000, etc.) 
Step 2: Determine the amount of Land Converted to Cropland by mineral soil types and climate regions in the 
country at the beginning of the first inventory time period. The first year of the inventory time period will depend 
on the time step of the activity data (0-T; e.g., 5, 10 or 20 years ago). 
Step 3: For Grassland converted to Cropland, classify previous grasslands into the appropriate management 
system using Figure 6.1. No classification is needed for other land uses at the Tier 1 level. 
Step 4: Assign native reference C stock values (SOCREF) from Table 2.3 based on climate and soil type.   
Step 5: Assign a land-use factor (FLU), management factor (FMG) and C input levels (FI) to each grassland based 
on the management classification (Step 2). Values for FLU, FMG and FI are given in Table 6.2 for grasslands.  Values 
are assumed to be 1 for all other land uses.  
Step 6: Multiply the factors (FLU, FMG, FI) by the reference soil C stock to estimate an ‘initial’ soil organic C 
stock (SOC(0-T)) for the inventory time period.    
Step 7: Estimate the final soil organic C stock (SOC0) by repeating Steps 1 to 5 using the same native reference 
C stock (SOCREF), but with land-use, management and input factors that represent conditions for the cropland in 
the last (year 0) inventory year.  
Step 8: Estimate the average annual change in soil organic C stocks for land converted to Cropland (∆CMineral) by 
subtracting the ‘initial’ soil organic C stock (SOC(0-T)) from the final soil organic C stock (SOC0), and then dividing 
by the time dependence of the stock change factors (i.e., 20 years using the default factors).  Note: if an inventory 
time period is greater than 20 years, then divide by the difference in the initial and final year of the time period.  
Step 9: Repeat Steps 2 to 8 if there are additional inventory time periods (e.g., 1990 to 2000, 2001 to 2010, etc.).  
Note that Land Converted to Cropland will retain that designation for 20 years. Therefore, inventory time periods 
that are less than 20 years may need to refer to the previous inventory time period to evaluate if a parcel of land is 
considered Land Converted to Cropland or Cropland Remaining Cropland. 
A numerical example is given below for Forest Land converted to Cropland on mineral soils, using Equation 2.25 
and default reference C stocks (Table 2.3) and stock change factors (Table 5.6).

2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Example: For a forest on volcanic soil in a tropical moist environment: SOCRef = 70 tonnes C ha-1. 
For all forest soils (and for native grasslands) default values for stock change factors (FLU , FMG , FI) 
are all 1; thus SOC(0-T) is 70 tonnes C ha-1. If the land is converted into annual cropland, with 
intensive tillage and low residue C inputs then: 
SOC0 = 70 tonnes C ha-1 ● 0.90 ● 1 ● 0.92 = 58.0 tonnes C ha-1.  
Thus the average annual change in soil C stock for the area over the inventory time period is 
calculated as: 
(58 tonnes C ha-1 – 70 tonnes C ha-1) / 20 yrs =    -0.6 tonnes C ha-1 yr-1.

METHANE EMISSIONS FROM RICE 
CULTIVATION 
No refinement in the Introduction. 
5.5.1 
Choice of method 
The basic equation to estimate CH4 emissions from rice cultivation is shown in Equation 5.2. CH4 emissions are 
estimated by multiplying daily emission factors by cultivation period10 of rice and annual harvested areas11. In its 
most simple form, this equation is implemented using national activity data (i.e., national average cultivation period 
of rice and area harvested) and a single emission factor. However, the natural conditions and agricultural 
management of rice production may be highly variable within a country. It is good practice to account for this 
variability by disaggregating national total harvested area into sub-units (e.g., harvested areas under different water 
regimes). Harvested area for each sub-unit is multiplied by the respective cultivation period and emission factor 
that is representative of the conditions that define the sub-unit (Sass, 2002). With this disaggregated approach, total 
annual emissions are equal to the sum of emissions from each sub-unit of harvested area.

The different conditions that should be considered include rice ecosystem types, flooding pattern before and during 
cultivation period, and type and amount of organic amendments. Other conditions such as soil type, and rice 
cultivar can be considered for the disaggregation if country-specific information about the relationship between 
these conditions and CH4 emissions are available. The rice ecosystem types and water regimes during cultivation 
period are listed in Table 5.12. If the national rice production can be sub-divided into agro-climatic zones with 
different production systems (e.g., flooding patterns), Equation 5.2 should be applied to each region separately. 
The same applies if rice statistics or expert judgments are available to distinguish management practices or other 
factors along administrative units (district or province). In addition, if more than one crop is harvested during a 
given year, emissions should be estimated for each cropping season taking into account possible differences in 
cultivation practices (e.g., use of organic amendments, flooding pattern before and during the cultivation period).  
The decision tree in Figure 5.2 guides inventory agencies through the process of applying the good practice IPCC 
approach. Implicit in this decision tree is a hierarchy of disaggregation in implementing the IPCC method. Within 
this hierarchy, the level of disaggregation utilised by an inventory agency will depend upon the availability of 
activity and emission factor data, as well as the importance of rice as a contributor to its national greenhouse gas 
 
10 In the case of a ratoon crop, ‘cultivation period’ should be extended by the respective number of days. 
11 In case of multiple cropping during the same year, ‘harvested area’ is equal to the sum of the area cultivated for each cropping.

Tier 1 applies to countries in which either CH4 emissions from rice cultivation are not a key category or country-
specific emission factors do not exist. The disaggregation of the annual harvest area of rice needs to be done for at 
least three baseline water regimes including irrigated, rainfed, and upland. It is encouraged to incorporate as many 
of the conditions (i, j, k, etc.) that influence CH4 emissions (summarized in Box 5.2) as possible. Emissions for each 
sub-unit are adjusted by multiplying a baseline default emission factor (for field with no pre-season flooding for 
less than 180 days prior to rice cultivation and continuously flooded fields without organic amendments, EFc) by 
various scaling factors as shown in Equation 5.2. The calculations are carried out for each water regime and organic 
amendment separately as shown in Equation 5.3.

soil type and rice cultivar). As for Tier 1 approach, it is encouraged to implement the method at the most 
disaggregated level and to incorporate the multitude of conditions (i, j, k, etc.) that influence CH4 emissions.

Tier 3 includes models and monitoring networks tailored to address national circumstances of rice cultivation,

disaggregated at sub-national level. Models can be empirical or mechanistic, but in either case need to be validated 
with independent observations from country or region-specific studies (Cai et al. 2003b; Li et al. 2004; Huang et 
al. 2004; and Pathak et al. 2005). Tier 3 methodologies may also take into account inter-annual variability triggered 
by typhoon, flooding, drought, etc.  A few countries have used Tier 3 method in their national communications to

2017), and USA used DayCent (Cheng et al. 2013)]. 
BOX 5.2 (UPDATED) 
CONDITIONS INFLUENCING CH4 EMISSIONS FROM RICE CULTIVATION  
The following rice cultivation characteristics should be considered in calculating CH4 emissions as 
well as in developing emission factors: 
Regional differences in rice cropping practices: If the country is large and has distinct agricultural 
regions with different climate and/or production systems (e.g., flooding patterns), a separate set of 
calculations should be performed for each region. 
Multiple crops: If more than one rice crop is harvested on a given area of land during the year, and 
the growing conditions vary among cropping seasons, calculations should be performed for each 
season. 
Water regime: In the context of this chapter, water regime is defined as a combination of (i) ecosystem 
type and (ii) flooding pattern. 
Ecosystem type: At a minimum, separate calculations should be undertaken for each rice ecosystem 
(i.e., irrigated, rainfed, and deep-water rice production). 
Flooding pattern: Flooding pattern of rice fields has a significant effect on CH4 emissions (Sass et al. 
1992; Yagi et al. 1996; Wassmann et al. 2000; Pathak and Wassmann 2007; Pathak et al. 2003). Rice 
ecosystems can further be distinguished into continuously and intermittently flooded (irrigated rice), 
and regular rainfed, drought prone, and deep water (rainfed), according to the flooding patterns 
during the cultivation period. Also, flooding pattern before cultivation period should be considered 
(Yagi et al. 1998; Cai et al. 2000; 2003a; Fitzgerald et al. 2000). 
Organic amendments to soils: Organic material incorporated into rice soils increases CH4 emissions 
(Schütz et al. 1989; Yagi and Minami 1990; Sass et al. 1991; Pathak and Wassmann 2007; Pathak et 
al. 2003). The impact of organic amendments on CH4 emissions depends on type and amount of the 
applied material which can be described by a dose response curve (Denier van der Gon and Neue 
1995; Yan et al. 2005). Organic material incorporated into the soil can either be of endogenous (straw, 
green manure, etc.) or exogenous origin (compost, farmyard manure, etc.). Calculations of emissions 
should consider the effect of organic amendments. 
Other conditions: It is known that other factors, such as soil type (Sass et al. 1994; Wassmann et al. 
1998; Huang et al. 2002), rice cultivar (Watanabe and Kimura 1998; Wassmann and Aulakh 2000), 
sulphate containing amendments (Lindau et al. 1993; Denier van der Gon and Neue 2002), etc., can 
significantly influence CH4 emissions. Inventory agencies are encouraged to make every effort to 
consider these conditions if country-specific information about the relationship between these 
conditions and CH4 emissions is available. 
5.5.2 
Choice of emission and scaling factors 
Tier 1 
Scaling factors are used to adjust the baseline emission factor (EFc), as provided in Table 5.11, to account for the 
various conditions discussed in Box 5.2, which result in adjusted daily emission factors (EFi) for a particular sub-
unit of disaggregated harvested area according to Equation 5.3. Default cultivation period is provided in Table 
5.11A which can be used for Equation 5.1. 
The most important scaling factors, namely water regime during and before cultivation period and organic 
amendments, are represented in Tables 5.12, 5.13 and 5.14, respectively, through default values.  Country-specific

scaling factors should only be used if they are based on well-researched and documented measurement data. It is 
encouraged to consider soil type, rice cultivar, and other factors, if available.

Water regime during the cultivation period (SFw): Table 5.12 provides default scaling factors and error ranges 
reflecting different water regimes. The aggregated case refers to a situation when activity data are only available 
for rice ecosystem types, but not for flooding patterns (see Box 5.2). In the disaggregated case, flooding patterns 
can be distinguished in the form of three subcategories as shown in Table 5.12. It is good practice to collect more 
disaggregated activity data and apply disaggregated case SFw whenever possible.

Notes: 
a Fields are never flooded for a significant period of time. 
  
b Fields are flooded for a significant period of time and the water regime is fully controlled.  
 • Continuously flooded: Fields have standing water throughout the rice growing season and may only dry out for harvest (end-season 
drainage). 
 • Single drainage period: Fields have a single drainage event and period during the cropping season at any growth stage, in addition to 
the end of season drainage. 
   • Multiple drainage periods: Fields have more than one drainage event and period of time without flooded conditions during the 
cropping season, in addition to an end of season drainage, including alternate wetting and drying (AWD). 
 
c Fields are flooded for a significant period of time with water regimes that depend solely on precipitation.  
 • Regular rainfed: The water level may rise up to 50 cm during the cropping season. 
 • Drought prone: Drought periods occur during every cropping season. 
 • Deep-water rice: Water level rises to more than 50 cm above the soil for a significant period of time during the cropping season. 
Other rice ecosystem categories, like swamps and inland, saline or tidal wetlands may be discriminated within each sub-category. 
Water regime before the cultivation period (SFp): Table 5.13 provides default scaling factors for water regime 
before the cultivation period, which can be used when country-specific data are unavailable. This table 
distinguishes four different water regimes prior to rice cultivation, namely:  
1. Non-flooded pre-season < 180 days, which often occurs under double cropping of rice;   
2. Non-flooded pre-season > 180 days, e.g., single rice crop following a dry fallow period;  
3. Flooded pre-season in which the minimum flooding interval is set to 30 days; i.e., shorter flooding periods 
(usually done to prepare the soil for ploughing) will not be included in this category; and 
4. Non-flooded pre-season in which the rice fields were not flooded for > 365 days such as upland crop ̶ paddy 
rotation.  
When activity data for the pre-season water status are not available, aggregated case factors can be used. It is good 
practice to collect more disaggregated activity data and apply disaggregated case of SFp. Scaling factors for 
additional water regimes can be applied if country-specific data are available. Note that the scaling factor SFp 
indicates the water management condition of a rice field before planting, which consequently affects the seasonal 
CH4 emission. SFp, however, is only used to estimate CH4 emission during the rice growing period, and cannot be 
used to quantify CH4 emissions that occurred before the cultivation period or after harvest (i.e. outside of rice 
growing season, such as CH4 emission during winter flooding period).

b For calculation of pre-season emission see below (section on completeness) 
c  Refers to "upland crop - paddy rotation" or fallow without flooding in previous year. 
Organic amendments (SFo): It is good practice to develop scaling factors that incorporate information on the type 
and amount of organic amendment applied (compost, farmyard manure, green manure, and rice straw). On an equal 
mass basis, more CH4 is emitted from amendments containing higher amounts of easily decomposable carbon and 
emissions also increase as more of each organic amendment is applied. Equation 5.3 and Table 5.14 present an 
approach to vary the scaling factor according to the amount of different types of amendment applied. Rice straw is 
often incorporated into the soil after harvest. In the case of a long fallow after rice straw incorporation, CH4 
emissions in the ensuing rice-growing season will be less than the case that rice straw is incorporated just before 
rice transplanting (Fitzgerald et al. 2000). Therefore, the timing of rice straw application was distinguished. An 
uncertainty range of 0.54-0.64 can be adopted for the exponent 0.59 in Equation 5.3.

a Straw application means that straws are incorporated into the soil. It does not include cases where straws are just placed on soil surface, 
and straws that were burnt on the field. 
Tier 2 
Inventory agencies can use country-specific emission factors from field measurements that cover the conditions of 
rice cultivation in their respective country. Box 5.2a provides information about measuring methane emissions for 
developing a baseline emission factor for rice cultivation. It is good practice to compile country-specific data bases 
on available field measurements which supplement the Emission Factor database 13 by other measurement 
programs (e.g., national) not yet included in this data base. However, certain standard QA/QC requirements apply 
to these field measurements (see Section 5.5.5).  
In Tier 2, inventory agencies can define the baseline management according to the prevailing conditions found in 
their respective country and determine country-specific emission factors for such a baseline. Then, inventory 
agencies can also determine country-specific scaling factors for management practices other than the baseline. In 
case where country-specific scaling factors are not available, default scaling factors can be used.  However, this 
may require some recalculation of the scaling factors given in Tables 5.12 to 5.14 if the condition is different from 
the baseline. 
Soil type (SFs) and rice cultivar (SFr): In some countries, emission data for different soil types and rice cultivar 
are available and can be used to derive SFs and SFr, respectively, for Tier 2 method. Both experiments and 
mechanistic knowledge confirm the importance of these factors, but large variations within the available data do 
not allow one to define reasonably accurate default values for Tier 1 method.  
Tier 3 
Tier 3 approaches do not require choice of emission factors, but are instead based on a thorough understanding of 
drivers and parameters (see above).

 BOX 5.2A (NEW) 
GOOD PRACTICE GUIDANCE FOR DEVELOPING BASELINE EMISSION FACTORS (EF) FOR CH4 EMISSIONS FROM 
RICE CULTIVATION 
The following information provides good practices in performing manual measurement of methane 
emissions using the closed-chamber technique for continuously flooded rice fields with 
recommended fertilizer application and no organic amendment. The data can be used to develop 
country- and region-specific EFc. 
Chamber Design: It is good practice to use lightweight material that is break resistant and inert to 
reactions with CH4 (e.g., acrylic and PVC). It may be a rectangular or cylindrical chamber, covering 
at least two rice hills. The chamber height must be higher than the rice plant. If necessary, use a base 
with a grove that can be filled with water to ensure a gas-tight closure. The chamber is equipped 
with a small fan, a thermometer, a vent hole with a stopper, and a gas sampling port (e.g., a flexible 
tube connected to a valve). 
Field Set up and Experimental Design: Select a field that is homogeneous with respect to soil 
properties. Use an appropriate experimental design with at least 3 replications.  
Sampling Strategies:  Sampling can be done 1 or 2 times per day between mid-morning and late 
morning period, and at least once a week for the whole growing period. More frequent measurements 
are needed during agricultural management events (e.g., irrigation, drainage, and N fertilization). 
All treatments would have to be measured at the same time. At each sampling time, it is good 
practice to obtain 3 to 4 gas samples within 30 minutes after closure of the chamber.   
For gas sampling, the use of a syringe or a pump is recommended depending on the required sample 
volume. Plastic or glass containers can be used for collecting samples and should be transferred to a 
laboratory and analyzed within the allowable storage period. 
Gas Analysis: Use gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) for 
analysis. Calibrate the GC before every analysis, using certified standard gases. 
Data Processing: Use a linear regression of the gas concentration inside the chamber against time to 
calculate the hourly flux. Identify the reasons of non-linearity (if exists) for the validation and 
correction of calculated flux. Use trapezoidal integration to calculate cumulative gas emissions from 
the hourly flux data. 
Deriving Emission Factor: Flux data from several sites, regions, or environmental conditions that 
conform to the requirements for a continuously flooded rice system with no organic amendments, 
can be used to derive region- or country-specific EFs based on a simple average and standard 
deviation.  The compiler could also derive disaggregated EFs using regression models to predict the 
values for different regions and/or environmental conditions. 
For more details refer to Minamikawa et al. (2015) and Sanders and Wassmann (2014). 
5.5.3 
Choice of activity data 
In addition to the essential activity data requested above, it is good practice to match data on organic amendments 
and soil types to the same level of disaggregation as the activity data. It may be necessary to complete a survey of 
cropping practices to obtain data on the type and amount of organic amendments applied. 
Activity data are primarily based on harvested area statistics, which should be available from a national statistics 
agency as well as complementary information on cultivation period and agronomic practices. The activity data 
should be broken down by regional differences in rice cropping practices or water regime (see Box 5.2). Harvested 
area estimates corresponding to different conditions may be obtained on a countrywide basis through accepted 
methods of reporting. The use of locally verified areas would be most valuable when they are correlated with 
available data for emission factors under differing conditions such as climate, agronomic practices, and soil 
properties. If these data are not available in-country, they can be obtained from international data sources: e.g., the 
World Rice Statistics on the website of International Rice Research Institute (IRRI14), which include harvest area 
of rice by ecosystem type for major rice producing counties, a rice crop calendar for each country, and other useful 
information, and the FAOSTAT on the website of FAO15, where data of rice area harvested can be obtained. The 
use of locally verified areas would be most valuable when they are correlated with available data for emission

Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use

2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
factors under differing conditions such as climate, agronomic practices, and soil properties. It may be necessary to 
consult local experts for a survey of agronomic practices relevant to methane emissions (organic amendments, 
water management, etc.). 
Most likely, activity data will be more reliable as compared to the accuracy of the emission factors. However, for 
various reasons the area statistics may be biased and a check of the harvested area statistics for (parts of) the 
country with remotely sensed data is encouraged.  
In addition to the essential activity data requested above, it is good practice, particularly in Tiers 2 and 3 
approaches, to match data on organic amendments and other conditions, e.g., soil types, to the same level of

Example Calculation for Tier 1 
An example is provided for estimating methane emission from rice cultivation, with the following background 
information.   
A country in Southeast Asia has rice area of 3 million hectares, with 50percent of the area classified as irrigated, 
30percent rainfed, 15percent upland, and 5percent deep water. Irrigated areas are planted for 2 growing seasons 
annually. Rice growing periods are 102 days, except for deep water rice which has 220 days. For irrigated areas, 
50percent is continuously flooded and 50percent is managed with multiple drainage periods. All irrigated areas are 
not flooded for less than 180 days prior to cultivation, while rainfed and upland areas are not flooded for more than 
180 days prior to cultivation. Deepwater rice areas are flooded for 30 days prior to cultivation. For irrigated areas, 
2 tonnes/ha of straw residues are incorporated shortly before cultivation (less than 30 days). 
Table 5.14a shows the calculation for total rice harvested area in a given year. Cropping season refers to the number 
of times rice is harvested per year. The calculation for adjusted daily emission factor is presented in Table 5.14b 
using Equation 5.2. The scaling factor for organic amendment (SFo), for irrigated rice field, is computed using 
Equation 5.3 for rice straw application rate of 2 tonnes/ha and conversion factor (CFOA) of 1.0 as provided in Table 
5.14. Based on Equation 5.1, the total methane emission is 410.47 Gg CH4/yr, as shown in Table 5.14c.

Uncertainty assessment 
The general principles of uncertainty assessment relevant for national emission inventories are elucidated in 
Volume 1, Chapter 3. The uncertainty of emission and scaling factors may be influenced by climatic, temporal, 
and spatial heterogeneity. Reducing the uncertainty depends on a better understanding of the spatial heterogeneity 
and correlation among these variables and the complexity of the mechanisms driving methane emission (Zhang et 
al. 2017). 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
5.60 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
For this source category, good practice should permit determination of uncertainties using standard statistical 
methods when enough experimental data are available. Studies to quantify some of this uncertainty are rare but 
available (e.g., for soil type induced variability). The variability found in such studies is assumed to be generally 
valid. For more detail, see Sass (2002). 
Important activity data necessary to assign scaling factors (i.e., data on cultural practices and organic amendments) 
may not be available in current databases/statistics. Estimates of the fraction of rice farmers using a particular 
practice or amendment must then be based on expert judgement, and the uncertainty range in the estimated fraction 
should also be based on expert judgement. As a default value for the uncertainty in the fraction estimate as ± 0.2 
(e.g., the fraction of farmers using organic amendment estimated at 0.4, the uncertainty range being 0.2 - 0.6). 
Volume 1, Chapter 3 provides advice on quantifying uncertainties in practice including combining expert 
judgements and empirical data into overall uncertainty estimates. 
In the case of CH4 emissions from rice cultivation, the uncertainty ranges of Tier 1 values (emission and scaling 
factors) can be adopted directly from Tables 5.11-5.14. Ranges are defined as the standard deviation about the 
mean, indicating the uncertainty associated with a given default value for this source category. The exponent in 
Equation 5.3 is provided with an uncertainty range of 0.54 - 0.64. Uncertainty assessment of Tier 2 and Tier 3 
approaches will depend on the respective data-base and model used. Therefore, it is good practice to apply general 
principles of statistical analysis as outlined in Volume 1, Chapter 3 as well as model approaches as outlined in 
Volume 4, Chapter 3, Section 3.5.

Estimation of default stock change factors for 
mineral soil C emissions/removals for cropland 
Long-Term Cultivation, Perennial Crops and Tillage Management Factors: 
Default stock change factors have been updated in Table 5.5 based on an analysis of a global dataset of 
experimental results for tillage long-term cultivation, and perennial crops to a 30cm depth. The land-use factor for 
long-term cultivation and perennial crops represents the change in carbon that occurs after 20 or more years of 
continuous cultivation or perennial crop production, respectively. Tillage factors represent the effect on C stocks 
at 20 years following the management change. Data were compiled from published literature based on the 
following criteria: a) must be an experiment with a control and treatment; b) provide soil organic C stocks or the 
data needed to compute soil organic C stocks (bulk density, OC content, gravel content); c) provide depth of 
measurements; d) provide the number of years from the beginning of the experiment to C stock sample collection; 
and c) provide location information. 
There were 303 published studies with 2383 observations for long-term cultivation and perennial tree/woody crops, 
and 212 published studies with 2046 observations for reduced tillage and no-tillage (References provided at bottom 
of Table 5.5). The histograms below provide summaries of the distribution of published studies for climate regions.

Semi-parametric mixed effect models were developed to estimate the new factors (Breidt et al. 2007). Several 
variables were tested including depth, number of years since the management change, climate, the type of 
management change (e.g., reduced tillage vs. no-till), and the first-order interactions among the variables.  
Variables and interactions terms were retained in the model if they met an alpha level of 0.05 and decreased the 
Akiake Information Criterion by two. For depth, data were not aggregated to a standardized set of depths but rather 
each of the original depth increments were used in the analysis (e.g., 0-5 cm, 5-10 cm, and 10-30 cm) as separate 
observations of stock changes. Similarly, time series data were not aggregated, even though those measurements 
are taken from the same plots. Consequently, random effects were included to account for the dependencies in 
times series data and among data points representing different depths from the same study. 
Special consideration was given to representing depth increments in order to avoid aggregating data across 
increments from the original experiments.  Data are collected by researchers at various depths that do not match 
among studies. We created a custom set of covariates, which are functions of the increment endpoints. These 
functions come from integrating the underlying quadratic function over the increments. This approach was needed 
in order to make statistically valid inferences with the semi-parametric mixed effect model techniques, and to 
avoid errors associated with aggregating data into a uniform set of depth increments.  
Using this customized approach, we estimated land use and management factors to a 30 cm depth.  Uncertainty 
was quantified based on the prediction error for the model, and represents a 95percent confidence interval for each 
of the factor values. The resulting confidence intervals can be used to construct probability distribution functions 
with a normal density for propagating error through the inventory calculations. 
Paddy Rice Land-Use Factors: 
Evidence from chronosequences with up to 2000 years of rice cultivation history show rice paddy production 
accumulates soil organic carbon at a fast rate during the first few decades, and then continues to accumulate carbon 
at a slower rate until a steady-state is reached at about 300 years (Huang et al. 2015; Kölbl et al. 2014). To update 
this land use factor for paddy rice, we conducted a literature review and collected the field experiment data of soil 
carbon stock changes in paddy rice fields that are available in peer-reviewed journals (References provided at 
bottom of Table 5.5). For each long-term experiment site, data were compiled for conventional management (e.g., 
normal levels for N, P, K chemical fertilizer applications, rice straw residue management and organic amendments). 
We calculated the ratio of soil organic carbon (tonne C ha-1 for 0-30 cm soil depth) between survey years for the 
paired comparisons between paddy rice and corresponding native vegetation.  The length of time ranged from 15 
to 25 years. The resulting estimates capture the large increase in carbon in the first few decades after rice cultivation, 
and therefore, are considered conservative because carbon can still increase at a slower rate for several more years 
(Huang et al. 2015; Kölbl et al. 2014). The land use factor for paddy rice is estimated as the average of these ratios, 
and uncertainty is based on the 2.5 percentile to 97.5 percentile of the distribution of ratios.

Annex 5A.2 
Background for developing emission factors and 
scaling factors for methane emission from paddy 
field, using scientific literature 
1. Collection of data  
• Since 2004, there exists a large body of field measurements of CH4 emission from rice fields across the 
world. The data set of Yan et al. 2005 (which is the data set used in developing the default emission factor 
and scaling factors in the IPCC 2006 IPCC Guidelines) was updated with all studies conducted through 30 
June 2017, expanding the dataset with observations of CH4 emission from rice fields around the world.  
• A comprehensive search was performed of published literature, which report field measurements of CH4, 
as described previously in the paper by Yan et al. 2005. This included a keyword search for topics such as 
rice or paddy*; methane or CH4 or greenhouse gas*; and flux* or emission*, in the ISI Web of Science 
(Thomson Reuters, New York, NY, USA) and Google Scholar (Google, Mountain View, CA, USA).  
• From this comprehensive search, the following information was compiled: (i) the average CH4 flux in the 
rice-growing season; (ii) integrated seasonal emission; (iii) water regime during and before the rice-growing 
season; (iv) the timing, type and amount of organic amendment; (v) soil properties (i.e., SOC and soil pH); 
(vi) location, agroecological zone, and year of experiment or studies; and (viii) duration and season of 
measurement. 
• The following information describes the criteria for selecting data that were included in the data set:  
(i) As suggested previously by Yan et al. 2005, hourly or daily flux is used in the compilation because 
it has a better index of emission strength than the integrated seasonal emission. When the average 
daily CH4 flux was not directly reported, the value is estimated using integrated seasonal emissions 
divided by the measurement period. 
(ii) Water regimes were categorized into following conditions: (i) continuous flooding; (ii) single 
drainage; (iii) multiple drainage; (iv) rainfed; and (v) deep water. The pre-season water regime was 
classified as: (i) non flooded pre-season for less than 180 days; (ii) non flooded pre-season for more 
than 180 days; (iii) flooded pre-season for more than 30 days; and (iv) non-flooded pre-season for 
more than 365 days. See Table 5.15 for the illustration of the water regimes before the cultivation 
period. 
(iii) For organic amendments, the data were classified as (i) straw incorporated shortly (i.e. less than 30 
days) before cultivation; (ii) straw incorporated long (i.e. more than 30 days) before cultivation; (iii) 
compost; (iv) farmyard manure; and (v) green manure.  Data for rice straw are expressed in dry weight, 
while for other organic materials data are expressed in fresh weight.  
(iv) To account for the spatial variability of CH4 emissions at the global scale, experimental sites were 
classified into different zones based on their climatic conditions. Using IRRI’s climatic classification 
(IRRI, 2002), Asian rice fields were categorized into six agro-ecological zone: (i) warm arid and semi-
arid tropics; (ii) warm sub-humid tropics; (iii) warm humid tropics; (iv) warm arid and semi-arid sub-
tropics with summer rainfall; (v) warm sub-humid sub-tropics with summer rainfall; and (vi) 
warm/cool humid sub-tropics with summer rainfall. Rice fields in the other region of the world were 
grouped into three regions, i.e., Latin America, Europe and United States. 
(v) For soil properties, because of the limited availability of information, only soil organic carbon (SOC) 
and soil pH (as continuous variables) were included in the data set. If soil organic matter content 
rather than SOC was reported, it was converted to SOC using a Bemmelen index value of 0.58. To 
meet the requirement of the statistical model, measurements without information for three 
continuous variables (i.e. SOC data, soil pH and the amount of organic amendment) were excluded. 
The final dataset used in the analysis included 1089 measurements, from 122 rice fields across the 
world. In this data set, measurements from Asian rice fields increased from 554 (Yan et al. 2005) to 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
5.64 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
942. In addition, 147 measurements from other regions of the world were added to the datasets 
(dataset provided in Wang et al. 2018). 
2. Processing and compilation of data  
Consistent with previous study by Yan et al. (2005), the following linear mixed model, suitable for analyzing 
unbalanced data (Speed et al. 2013), was used to determine the effect of controlling variables on CH4 flux from 
rice fields:

In this model soil pH was treated as a categorical variable and grouped into the following “h” classes: <4.5, 4.5-5.0, 
5.0-5.5, 5.5-6.0, 6.0-6.5, 6.5-7.0, 7.0-7.5, 7.5- 8.0 and >8.0. For other categorical variables, their corresponding 
sublevels (i, j, k, l) and descriptions are shown in Tables 5A.2-1.  
The last part of Equation 5A.2-1 reflects the effect of the application of organic amendment on CH4 flux. This effect 
is an interaction of the type and amount of organic material. In cases where the amount of organic amendment is 
zero, it is assumed that there is zero application rate for each type of organic material. Obviously, this assumption 
will result in more data points in the analysis than there are in real observations of organic amendments. To 
ameliorate this problem, the residuals of observations are weighted with organic amendment as 1 and those without 
as 0.2 (as the observational result was repeated five times for the five types of organic materials. All the variables 
were treated as fixed effect, and experimental site was treated as a random effect to address dependencies in data 
collected from the same experiment. 
The effects of the controlling variables on CH4 flux were computed by fitting Equation 5A.2.1 to field observations 
using the SPSS Mixed Model procedure (V24.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). 
3. Developing of global and regional emission factors and scaling factors 
• The estimated effects of various variables were used to derive a default EF. In the model, the CH4 emissions 
from rice fields are a combination of the effects of SOC and pH values, pre-season water status, water

regime in the rice-growing season, organic amendment and climate. An assumption was made to provide a 
default EF, that is, all observations in the data set to have a water regime of continuous flooding, a preseason 
water status of non flooded pre-season <180 d and no organic amendments, while keeping other conditions 
constant, as stated in the original papers (Yan et al. 2005). Using Equation 5A.2.2, the default EF is derived 
for continuously flooded rice fields, with a pre-season water status of non flooded pre-season <180 days, 
and without organic amendment:

The values of scaling factors from the aggregated and disaggregated cases are assumed to be referenced as global 
and regional scaling factors, respectively. The scaling factors of the disaggregated case for water regime during the 
rice season and preseason are estimated using the modelling results in Equation 5A.2.1. Firstly, the fluxes of CH4 
for ‘continuously flooding’ during the rice season and ‘non flooded pre-season <180 d’ in preseason were assumed 
to be 1. Then, the corresponding relative fluxes for different water regimes were calculated by the ratios of back-
transformed estimates (i.e., exponential function) of different water regimes to back-transformed estimates (i.e., 
exponential function) of ‘continuously flooding’ during the rice season and ‘non flooded pre-season <180 d’ in pre-
season. Given the different sizes of observations for various water regimes in the data set, the calculations of the 
scaling factors for the aggregated case were weighted accordingly. For organic amendment, the fluxes of CH4 from 
various form of organic materials were calculated, first with an application amount of 6 t/ha. The CH4 flux from 
straw applied shortly (<30 days) before cultivation (6 t/ha) is assumed to be 1, the relative fluxes for other organic 
materials are then calculated. 
See Wang et al. (2018) for more information and datasets used for the analysis.

TABLE 5A.2.1 (NEW) 
DESCRIPTION OF THE SELECTED VARIABLES THAT CONTROL CH4 EMISSIONS FROM RICE FIELDS  
Variables 
Description 
Preseason water status 
Flooded pre-season 
Permanently flooded rice fields are assumed to have a preseason water regime of 
‘flooded pre-season’. Late rice (e.g., in China) is usually planted immediately after 
early rice on the same field and is therefore regarded as having a preseason water 
regime of ‘flooded pre-season’. 
Non flooded pre-season >180 
d 
If rice is planted once a year and the field is not flooded in the non-rice growing 
season, the preseason water regime is classified as ‘non flooded pre-season >180 d’. 
Non flooded pre-season <180 
d 
Rice is planted more than once a year, but there is more than one month of fallow 
time between the two seasons, ‘non-flooded pre-season <180 d’ usually implies 
preseason drainage. 
Non-flooded pre-season >365 
d 
For measurements conducted on rice fields that are preceded by two upland crops or 
an upland crop and a drained fallow season, the preseason water regime of such 
experiments is classified as ‘non-flooded pre-season >365 d’. 
Water regime in the rice-growing season 
Continuous flooding 
Rice is cultivated under continuously flooded condintion but sometimes an end-
season drainage before rice harvest included. 
Single drainage 
One mid-season drainage and an end-season drainage are adopted over the entire rice-
growing season. 
Multiple drainage 
Multiple drainge refers to the management water regime, also called 'intermittent 
irrigation', in which the number of drainage events was not clear, but there are more 
than one events during the growing season. 
Rainfed, wet season (regular 
rainfed) 
Rice cultivation that relies on rainfall for water, in this case the field is flood prone 
during the rice-growing season. 
Rainfed, dry season (drought 
prone) 
Rice cultivation that relies on rainfall for water, in this case the field is drought prone 
during the rice-growing season. 
Deep water 
Rice grown in flooded conditions with water depth more than 50 cm deep. 
Organic amendment 
Straw incorporated shortly 
(<30 days) before cultivation 
Straw applied just before rice transplanting as on-season; straw that is left on the soil 
surface in the fallow season and incorporated into the soil before the next rice 
transplanting is also categorized as ‘straw incorporated shortly (<30 days) before 
cultivation’. The amount of straw return is expressed in dry weight (t ha-1). 
Straw incorporated long (>30 
days) before cultivation 
Straw incorporated into soils in the previous season (upland crop or fallow) is 
categorized as ‘straw incorporated long (>30 days) before cultivation’. The amount of 
straw return is expressed in dry weight (t ha-1). 
Compost, farmyard manure, 
green manure 
The amount of organic materials is expressed in fresh weight (t ha-1).

The sensitivity analysis was based on a method developed by Sobol (2001). We evaluated all parameters except 
for the temperate effect on decomposition (Equation 5.0e) and moisture effects on decomposition (Equation 5.0F). 
The parameters in these functions were highly correlated so we only evaluated one parameter from each function 
(𝑡𝑜𝑜���𝑡 for Equation 5.0e and 𝑤1 for Equation 5.0f). A bootstrap sampling method was used to evaluate the total 
global sensitivity index of the parameters given the log-likelihood value of the mismatch between the model output 
and the observed data.  This information was used to determine if the sample size was sufficient for ranking the 
sensitivity of the parameters (i.e., minimising the variance enough on the index values to avoid Type 1 error). The

are given in the Table 5A.3.2.

1 No-till cultivation factor is fixed at a value of 1 based on the model formulation. 
2 The maximum temperature for decomposition was not evaluated because it was highly correlated with the temperature optimum for 
decomposition. 
Bayesian parameterisation techniques were used to determine the probability distributions of the most sensitive 
parameters, which included parameters with a sensitivity greater than 0.001 (Table 5A.3-2). However, the 𝑡𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑒���𝑎𝑐 
parameter for reduced-till is included because the parameter for full-till was included. Sampling-importance 
resampling was used to generate a joint posterior distribution (Rubin, 1998). This approach includes two steps, a) 
drawing independent random samples from a known prior distribution, and b) resampling the initial draws from 
step (a) based on importance sampling weights for individual parameter sets. Samples are more likely to be 
maintained in the posterior distribution with higher likelihoods (Smith & Gelfand, 1992).  Uniform priors were 
selected with an initial sample size 𝑙��� = 1,000,000 and a re-sample size 𝑙��� = √𝑙���, i.e., 1000, which allows for 
distributional convergence in the posterior distribution (Givens & Hoeting, 2005). The final posterior distribution 
was estimated as a truncated multivariate distribution under the assumption that parameter values should not 
exceed the minimum and maximum values in the posterior distribution. The resulting parameters are given in 
Table 5A.3-2 and the covariance matrix is given Table 5A.3-3.
