INTRODUCTION 
The Waste volume gives methodological guidance for estimation of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and 
nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from following categories: 
• 
Solid waste disposal (Chapter 3),  
• 
Biological treatment of solid waste (Chapter 4),  
• 
Incineration and open burning of waste (Chapter 5), 
• 
Wastewater treatment and discharge (Chapter 6).  
Chapter 3, Solid Waste Disposal, provides also a methodology for estimating changes in carbon stored in solid 
waste disposal sites (SWDS), which is reported as an information item in the Waste Sector (see also Volume 4, 
AFOLU, Chapter 12, Harvested Wood Products).   
Chapter 2, Waste Generation, Composition and Management Data, gives general guidance of data collection for 
solid waste management including disposal, biological treatment, waste incineration and open burning of waste. 
Categories and activities of the Waste Sector and their definitions can be found in Table 8.2 in Chapter 8 of 
Volume1, General Guidance and Reporting. It is good practice to apply these categories in reporting as fully as 
possible. 
Figure 1.1 shows the structure of categories within the Waste Sector and coding of their IPCC categories.

Typically, CH4 emissions from SWDS are the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the Waste Sector. 
CH4 emissions from wastewater treatment and discharge may also be important.  
Incineration and open burning of waste containing fossil carbon, e.g., plastics, are the most important sources of 
CO2 emissions in the Waste Sector. All greenhouse gas emissions from waste-to-energy, where waste material is 
used directly as fuel or converted into a fuel, should be estimated and reported under the Energy Sector. The 
guidance given in Chapter 5 of this Volume is generally valid for waste burning with or without energy recovery. 
CO2 is also produced in SWDS, wastewater treatment and burning of non-fossil waste, but this CO2 is of 
biogenic origin and is therefore not included as a reporting item in this sector.1 In the Energy Sector, CO2 
emissions resulting from combustion of biogenic materials, including CO2 from waste-to-energy applications, 
are reported as an information item. Nitrous oxide is produced in most treatments addressed in the Waste volume. 
The importance of the N2O emissions varies much depending on the type of treatment and conditions during the 
treatment.  
Waste and wastewater treatment and discharge can also produce emissions of non-methane volatile organic 
compounds (NMVOCs), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and carbon monoxide (CO) as well as of ammonia (NH3). 
However, specific methodologies for the estimation of emissions for these gases are not included in this Volume, 
and the readers are guided to refer to guidelines developed under the Convention of Long Range Transboundary 
Air Pollution (EMEP/CORINAIR Guidebook, EEA, 2005) and EPA's Compilation of Air Pollutant Emissions 
Factors (U.S.EPA, 1995). The NOx and NH3 emissions from the Waste Sector can cause indirect N2O emissions. 
NOx is produced mainly in burning of waste, while NH3 in composting. Overall, the indirect N2O from the Waste 
Sector are likely to be insignificant. However, when estimates of NOx and NH3 emissions are available, it is 
good practice to estimate the indirect N2O emissions for complete reporting (see Chapter 7 of Volume 1). 
The scope of the Waste Volume is similar to the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas 
Inventories (1996 Guidelines, IPCC, 1997) and the Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in 
National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (GPG2000, IPCC, 2000). Following new subcategories have been added 
to complement the guidance to cover all major waste management practices: 
• 
Biological treatment of solid waste: Guidance for estimation of CH4 and N2O emissions from biological 
treatment (composting, anaerobic digestion in biogas facilities) has been included in Chapter 4, Biological 
Treatment of Solid Waste. 
• 
Open burning of waste: Guidance to estimate emissions from open burning of waste as well as for 
estimation of CH4 emissions from incineration complements the previous guidance on waste incineration in 
Chapter 5, Incineration and Open Burning of Waste.  
• 
Septic tanks and latrines: Methods to estimate CH4 and N2O emissions from septic tanks and latrines as well 
as from discharge of wastewater into waterways are included in Chapter 6, Wastewater Treatment and 
Discharge.

1  CO2 emissions of biogenic origin are either covered by the methodologies and reported as carbon stock change in the 
AFOLU Sector, or do not need to be accounted for because the corresponding CO2 uptake by vegetation is not reported in 
the inventory (e.g., annual crops).
