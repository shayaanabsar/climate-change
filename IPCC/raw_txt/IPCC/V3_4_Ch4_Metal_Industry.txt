INTRODUCTION 
The following sections 4.2 through 4.7 give guidance for estimating greenhouse gas emissions that result from 
the production of metals.   
• 
Section 4.2 covers emissions from iron and steel, and metallurgical coke production;  
• 
Section 4.3 covers emissions from ferroalloy production;  
• 
Section 4.4 covers emissions from aluminium production;  
• 
Section 4.5 covers emissions from magnesium production; 
• 
Section 4.6 covers emissions from lead production; 
• 
Section 4.7 covers emissions from zinc production.  
Care should be exercised to avoid double counting of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in both this chapter and in 
Volume 2 on Energy Sector, or, in omitting CO2 emissions since CO2 emissions resulting from carbon’s role as 
process reactant and as a heat source to drive the chemical reactions involved in the metallurgical processes are 
closely related in many cases.  Should CO2 capture technology be installed at a metals production facility, the 
CO2 captured should be deducted in a higher tier emissions calculation. Any methodology taking into account 
CO2 capture should consider that CO2 emissions captured in the process may be both combustion and process-
related. In cases where combustion and process emissions are to be reported separately, e.g., for iron and steel 
production, inventory compilers should ensure that the same quantities of CO2 are not double counted. In these 
cases the total amount of CO2 captured should preferably be reported in the corresponding energy combustion 
and IPPU source categories in proportion to the amounts of CO2 generated in these source categories. The 
default assumption is that there is no CO2 capture and storage (CCS) taking place. For additional information on 
CO2 capture and storage refer to Volume 3, Section 1.2.2 and for more details to Volume 2, Section 2.3.4.

IRON & STEEL AND METALLURGICAL COKE 
PRODUCTION 
The production of iron and steel leads to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide 
(N2O). This chapter provides guidance for estimating emissions of CO2 and CH4.1   
The iron and steel industry broadly consists of: 
• 
Primary facilities that produce both iron and steel;  
• 
Secondary steelmaking facilities;  
• 
Iron production facilities; and 
• 
Offsite production of metallurgical coke. 
Figure 4.1 illustrates the main processes for iron and steel production: metallurgical coke production, sinter 
production, pellet production, iron ore processing, iron making, steelmaking, steel casting and very often 
combustion of blast furnace and coke oven gases for other purposes.  The main processes may occur under what 
is referred to as an ‘integrated’ facility and typically include blast furnaces, and basic oxygen steelmaking 
furnaces (BOFs), or in some cases open hearth furnaces (OHFs).  It is also common for parts of the production to 
be offsite under the responsibility of another operator such as an offsite coke production facility.  
In some countries, there will be coke production facilities that are not integrated with iron and steel production 
(i.e., ‘offsite’). This chapter provides guidance for estimating emissions of CO2 and CH4 from all coke 
production to ensure consistency and completeness.  Countries should estimate emissions from onsite and offsite 
coke production separately under higher tiers as the by-products of onsite coke production (e.g., coke oven gas, 
coke breeze, etc.) are often used during the production of iron and steel. 
Primary and secondary steel-making: 
Steel production can occur at integrated facilities from iron ore, or at secondary facilities, which produce steel 
mainly from recycled steel scrap. Integrated facilities typically include coke production, blast furnaces, and basic 
oxygen steelmaking furnaces (BOFs), or in some cases open hearth furnaces (OHFs). Raw steel is produced 
using a basic oxygen furnace from pig iron produced by the blast furnace and then processed into finished steel 
products.  Pig iron may also be processed directly into iron products. Secondary steelmaking most often occurs 
in electric arc furnaces (EAFs). In 2003, BOFs accounted for approximately 63 percent of world steel production 
and EAFs approximately accounted for 33 percent; OHF production accounted for the remaining 4 percent but is 
today declining.    
Iron production: 
Iron production can occur onsite at integrated facilities or at separate offsite facilities containing blast furnaces 
and BOFs. In addition to iron production via blast furnace, iron can be produced through a direct reduction 
process. Direct reduction involves the reduction of iron ore to metallic iron in the solid state at process 
temperatures less than 1000°C. 
Metallurgical coke production: 
Metallurgical coke production is considered to be an energy use of fossil fuel, and as a result emissions should 
be reported in Category 1A of the Energy Sector. The methodologies are presented here in Volume 3, however, 
because the activity data used to estimate emissions from energy and non-energy in integrated iron and steel 
production have significant overlap. All fuel consumed in this source category not allocated as inputs to the 
sinter plants, pelletisation plants and blast furnace should be regarded as fuel combustion, which is dealt with 
and reported in the Energy Sector (see Volume 2: Energy). 
 
                                                           
1  No methodologies are provided for N2O emissions. These emissions are likely to be small, but countries can calculate 
estimates provided they develop country-specific methods based on researched data.

Introduction 
METALLURGICAL COKE PRODUCTION 
Metallurgical coke is primarily used in the blast furnace to make iron. Coke is also used in other metallurgical 
processes, such as the manufacture of cast iron, ferroalloys, lead, and zinc, and in kilns to make lime and 
magnesium.  Metallurgical coke is the solid product obtained from the carbonisation of coal, principally coking 
coal, at high temperature. It is low in moisture content and volatile matter. Coking coal refers to bituminous coal 
with a quality that allows the production of a coke suitable to support a blast furnace charge. Its gross calorific 
value is greater than 23 865 kJ/kg (5 700 kcal/kg) on an ash-free but moist basis. Coke oven gas is a by-product 
of the manufacture of metallurgical coke for the production of iron and steel. Figure 4.2 illustrates the coke 
production process and associated sources of CH4 and CO2 emissions.   
Note that coke oven gas may be burned to heat coke ovens or transferred onsite in an integrated iron and steel 
plant and used in sinter production or iron production processes. Coke oven gas may also be transferred off site 
(e.g., into the natural gas distribution system) and used as an energy source. The combustion of coke in blast 
furnaces during the iron and steel-making process produces blast furnace gas, which may then be recovered and 
transferred from the iron and steel mill to the onsite coke plant and burned to heat coke ovens or used in sinter 
production. The combustion of blast furnace gas and coke oven gas is the main sources of CO2 and CH4 
emissions in coke production. 
SINTER PRODUCTION 
Iron ore and other iron-containing materials may be agglomerated in sinter plants at integrated iron and steel 
plants prior to introduction into the blast furnace.  Feedstock to sinter plants may include fine iron ores, additives 
(e.g., lime, olivine), and iron-bearing recycled materials from downstream iron and steelmaking processes (e.g., 
dust from blast-furnace gas cleaning). Coke breeze (small-grade coke oven coke with particle sizes of < 5 mm) is 
the most commonly used process material in sinter plants. The coke breeze may be produced from the onsite 
coke ovens in integrated iron and steel plants, or may be purchased from offsite coke producers. Blast furnace 
gas or coke oven gas produced onsite during integrated iron and steel production may be used in sinter plants. 
Operation of sinter plants produces carbon dioxide emissions from oxidation of the coke breeze and other inputs.  
Off gas from sinter production also contains methane and other hydrocarbons. Figure 4.3 illustrates the sinter 
production process. 
PELLET PRODUCTION 
Pellets are formed from iron-containing raw materials (i.e., fine ore and additives) into 9-16 mm spheres in a 
very high temperature process.  The process includes grinding, drying, balling, and thermal treatment of the raw 
materials. Pelletisation plants are principally located at iron mines or at shipping ports, but can also be located 
onsite as part of an integrated iron and steel facility. Natural gas or coal may be used as fuel for pelletisation 
plants; for pelletisation plants located onsite at an integrated iron and steel facility, coke oven gas may be used as 
a fuel. Energy consumption for the process and the associated CO2 emissions will depend in part on the quality 
of the iron ore and other raw materials used in the process. The CO2 emissions will also depend upon the carbon 
contents and heating values of fuels used in the process. 
IRONMAKING AND THE ROLE OF COKE 
Most CO2 emitted by the iron and steel industry is associated with the production of iron, more specifically the 
use of carbon to convert iron ore to iron. Figure 4.4 describes the iron-making process and associated sources of 
emissions. Carbon is supplied to the blast furnace mainly in the form of coke produced from metallurgical grade 
coking coal (but can also be in the form charcoal made from wood or other forms of carbon.). Carbon serves a 
dual purpose in the iron making process, primarily as a reducing agent to convert iron oxides to iron, but also as 
an energy source to provide heat when carbon and oxygen react exothermically. Blast furnace gas is produced 
during the combustion of coke in blast furnaces. It is typically recovered and used as a fuel partly within the 
plant and partly in other steel industry processes, or in power stations equipped to burn it.  Blast furnace gas may 
also be recovered and transferred from the iron and steel mill to the onsite coke plant and burned for energy 
within the coke ovens.  Blast furnace gas may also be transferred offsite and used as an energy source both 
within the furnace and when blast furnace gas is combusted to heat blast air. Oxygen steel furnace gas is 
obtained as a by-product of the production of steel in a basic oxygen furnace (BOF) and is recovered on leaving 
the furnace. All carbon used in blast furnaces should be considered process-related IPPU emissions. 
Additionally, iron can be produced through a direct reduction process. Direct reduction involves the reduction of 
iron ore to metallic iron in the solid state at process temperatures less than 1 000°C. A solid product referred to 
as direct reduced iron (DRI) is produced by the direct reduction process. DRI has a carbon content of < 2 percent. 
DRI is normally used as a replacement for scrap metal in the electric arc furnace steelmaking route, but may also 
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
4.12 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
be used as a feedstock for blast furnace iron making. DRI may also be melted into briquettes, referred to as hot 
briquetted iron (HBI), when the product has to be stored or transported. Inventory preparers can estimate the CO2 
emissions from these processes from the energy consumption and carbon content of the fuel (e.g., natural gas, 
coal). 
STEELMAKING 
Steel production in a BOF begins by charging the vessel with 70-90 percent molten iron and 10-30 percent steel 
scrap. High purity oxygen then combines with the carbon in the iron to create an exothermic reaction that melts 
the charge while lowering the carbon content. Iron from the blast furnace usually contains 3-4 percent carbon, 
which must be reduced to less than 1 percent, refined, and alloyed to produce the desired grade of steel.  
Steel production in an EAF typically occurs by charging 100 percent recycled steel scrap, which is melted using 
electrical energy imparted to the charge through carbon electrodes and then refined and alloyed to produce the 
desired grade of steel. Although EAFs may be located in integrated plants, typically they are stand-alone 
operations because of their fundamental reliance on scrap and not iron as a raw material. Since the EAF process 
is mainly one of melting scrap and not reducing oxides, carbon’s role is not as dominant as it is in the blast 
furnace/BOF process. In a majority of scrap-charged EAF, CO2 emissions are mainly associated with 
consumption of the carbon electrodes. All carbon used in EAFs and other steelmaking processes should be 
considered process-related IPPU emissions. Figure 4.5 illustrates the steel making process and associated sources 
of emissions.

Methodological issues 
4.2.2.1 
CHOICE OF METHOD: METALLURGICAL COKE PRODUCTION 
The IPCC Guidelines outline three tiers for calculating CO2 emissions and two tiers for calculating CH4 
emissions from coke production. The choice of a good practice method for estimation of CO2 emissions depends 
on national circumstances as shown in the decision tree in Figure 4.6 Estimation of CO2 Emissions from 
Metallurgical Coke Production.  For CH4 emissions, use the decision tree in Figure 4.8. 
Metallurgical coke is produced either at the iron and steel facility (‘onsite’) or at separate facilities (‘offsite’).The 
Tier 1 method calculates emissions from all coke production using default emission factors applied to national 
coke production.  
The Tier 2 method for estimating CO2 emissions distinguishes between onsite and offsite coke production. It 
uses national activity data for the consumption and production of process materials (e.g., coking coal consumed, 
coke produced, and coal tar products produced). As discussed above, the Tier 2 method is not applicable to 
estimating CH4 emissions.  The Tier 3 method requires plant-specific CO2 emissions data and plant-specific CH4 
emissions data, or plant-specific activity data. 
 
TIER 1 METHOD – PRODUCTION-BASED EMISSION FACTORS 
Equation 4.1 calculates emissions from all coke production. The Tier 1 method assumes that all coke made 
onsite at iron and steel production facilities is used onsite. The Tier 1 method is to multiply default emission 
factors by tonnes of coke produced. Emissions should be reported in the Energy Sector.

EF= emission factor, tonnes CO2/tonne coke production or tonnes CH4/tonne coke production 
Note: The Tier 1 method assumes that all of the coke oven by-products are transferred off site and that all 
of the coke oven gas produced is burned on site for energy recovery. 
 
TIER 2 METHOD 
The Tier 2 method is appropriate if national statistics on process inputs and outputs from integrated and non-
integrated coke production processes are available. Tier 2 will produce a more accurate estimate than Tier 1 
because it takes into account the actual quantity of inputs into and outputs rather than making assumptions.  
As expressed in Equations 4.2 and 4.3, Tier 2 estimates CO2 emissions from onsite coke production separately 
from off-site production. This separation is due to overlapping data requirements when estimating emissions 
from onsite coke production and emissions from iron and steel production.

TIER 3 METHOD 
Unlike the Tier 2 method, the Tier 3 method uses plant specific data because plants can differ substantially in 
their technology and process conditions. If actual measured CO2/CH4 emissions data are available from onsite 
and offsite coke production plants, these data can be aggregated and used directly to account for national 
emissions from metallurgical coke production using the Tier 3 method. Total national emissions will equal the 
sum of emissions reported from each facility. If facility-specific CO2 emissions data are not available, CO2 
emissions can be calculated from plant-specific activity data applying the Tier 2 method, Equations 4.2 and 4.3. 
Total national emissions will equal the sum of emissions reported from each facility.

CHOICE OF METHOD: IRON AND STEEL PRODUCTION  
These Guidelines outline three tiers for calculating CO2 emissions and two tiers for calculating CH4 emissions 
from iron and steel production. The choice of a good practice method depends on national circumstances as 
shown in the decision tree in Figure 4.7 for CO2 emissions and Figure 4.8 for CH4 emissions: Decision Tree for 
Estimation of CO2 Emissions from Iron & Steel Production and Decision Tree for Estimating of CH4 Emissions 
from Iron and Steel Production. The Tier 1 method is based on national production data and default emission 
factors. It may lead to errors due to its reliance on assumptions rather than actual data for the quantity of inputs 
into the sinter production and iron and steel production sector that contribute to CO2 emissions. Therefore, the 
Tier 1 is appropriate only if iron and steel production is not a key category. Default emission factors are provided 
for sinter production, blast furnace iron making, direct reduced iron production, pellet production, and each 
method of steelmaking. The primary sources of emissions are the blast furnace iron making, and steelmaking.  
The Tier 2 method for estimating CO2 emissions from iron and steel production is based on data for the known 
consumption of raw materials, including reducing agents, and industry-wide data. It uses a mass balance 
approach and material-specific carbon contents. The Tier 2 method is not applicable to estimating CH4 
emissions. The Tier 3 method requires plant-specific emissions or activity data aggregated to the national level 
for estimating CO2 and CH4 emissions.

4.21 
METHODOLOGY FOR ESTIMATING CO2 EMISSIONS  
Tier 1 method – production-based emission factors 
The Tier 1 approach for emissions from iron and steel production is to multiply default emission factors by 
national production data, as shown in Equation 4.4. Because emissions per unit of steel production vary widely 
depending on the method of steel production, it is good practice to determine the share of steel produced in 
different types of steelmaking processes, calculate emissions for each process, and then sum the estimates. 
Equation 4.4 considers steel production from Basic Oxygen Furnaces (BOF), Electric Arc Furnaces (EAF), and 
Open Hearth Furnaces (OHF). In the event that activity data for steel production for each process is not available, 
default allocation of total national steel production among these three steelmaking processes is provided in Table 
4.1 in Section 4.2.2.3. 
Equation 4.5 calculates emissions from pig iron production that is not converted into steel. It is preferable to 
estimate emissions from this production separately because the emission factors for integrated iron and steel 
production (BOF and OHF processes) take into account emissions from both steps. 
Equation 4.6 calculates CO2 emissions from production of Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) for the Tier 1 method 
using a CO2 emission factor. 
It is also good practice to estimate separately the emissions from sinter production and national pellet production, 
using Equations 4.7 and 4.8. Equations 4.7 and 4.8 should be used if the inventory compiler does not have 
detailed information about the process materials used. If the process materials are known, emissions should be 
calculated using the Tier 2 method. 
Total emissions are the sum of Equations 4.4 to 4.8.

Tier 2 method 
The Tier 2 method is appropriate if the inventory compiler has access to national data on the use of process 
materials for iron and steel production, sinter production, pellet production, and direct reduced iron production. 
In addition, as discussed in Section 4.2.2.5, there are a number of other process inputs and outputs that could be 
considered under Tier 2. These data may be available from governmental agencies responsible for manufacturing 
or energy statistics, business or industry trade associations, or individual iron and steel companies. The Tier 2 
method will produce a more accurate estimate than the Tier 1 method because it takes into account the actual 
quantity of inputs that contribute to CO2 emissions.  
In calculating pellet production emissions, energy consumption and heating value and carbon content of the fuel 
can be used similarly to the other methodologies.

Tier 3 method  
Unlike the Tier 2 method, the Tier 3 method uses plant specific data.  The Tier 3 method provides an even more 
accurate estimate of emission than the Tier 2 method because plants can differ substantially in their technology 
and process conditions. If actual measured CO2 emissions data are available from iron and steelmaking facilities, 
these data can be aggregated to account for national CO2 emissions. If facility-specific CO2 emissions data are 
not available, CO2 emissions can be calculated from plant-specific activity data for individual reducing agents, 
exhaust gases, and other process materials and products. Total national emissions will equal the sum of 
emissions reported from each facility. Equations 4.9 through 4.11 describe the parameters that are necessary for 
an accounting of plant-specific emissions using the Tier 3 method and plant-specific activity data at a facility 
level. Plant-specific carbon contents for each material are required for the Tier 3 method. 
 
METHODOLOGY FOR CH4 
When carbon-containing materials are heated in the furnace for sinter production or iron production, the volatiles, 
including methane, are released. With open or semi-covered furnaces, most of the volatiles will burn to CO2 
above the charge, in the hood and off-gas channels, but some will remain un-reacted as CH4 and non-methane 
volatile organic compounds (NMVOC). The amounts depend on the operation of the furnace. Sprinkle-charging 
will reduce the amounts of CH4 compared to batch-wise charging. Increased temperature in the hood (less false 
air) will reduce the content of CH4 further.  
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
4.24 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
This section describes a Tier 1 default method and a more advanced Tier 3 facility-level method for CH4 from 
sinter production or iron production, both of which are similar to the approaches described for estimating CO2 
emissions. There is no Tier 2 method. CH4 may be emitted from steel–making processes as well, however those 
emissions are assumed to be negligible. Therefore CH4 emissions from steel-making processes are not discussed 
here. 
The Tier 1 methodology for CH4 is based on emission factors and national production statistics.

CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTORS 
TIER 1 METHOD 
Carbon dioxide emission factors 
Table 4.1 provides default emission factors for coke, sinter, pellet, iron, and steel production. The emission 
factors for the three steelmaking methods are based on expert judgment using typical practice for the different 
steel production scenarios listed. The default emission factors account for all carbon input into the blast furnace.  
It is assumed based on the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) Reference Document on 
Production of Iron and Steel (European IPPC Bureau, 2001) (referred to in this section as ‘IPPC I&S BAT 
Document’) that most of the carbon input to the blast furnace is from coke (60 -90 percent).  
The default CO2 emission factor for coke production is derived by averaging plant-specific CO2 emissions data 
for 11 European coke plants reported in the IPPC I&S BAT Document. Emissions of CO2 are reported in Table 
6.2 of the IPPC I&S BAT Document in units of kilograms of CO2 per tonne of liquid steel produced. The CO2 
emissions range from 175 to 200 kg CO2 per tonne liquid steel. The conversion factors provided in Table 6.2 of 
the IPPC Document are 940 kg pig iron per tonne liquid steel and 358 kg coke per tonne pig iron. Based on these 
conversion factors the average CO2 emissions from the 11 European coke plants is 0.56 tonne CO2 per tonne 
coke produced. 
The CO2 emission factor for sinter plants is derived by averaging plant-specific CO2 emissions data for four 
European sinter plants reported in the IPPC I&S BAT Document. Emissions of CO2 are reported in Table 4.1 of 
Chapter 4: Metal Industry Emissions 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.25 
the IPPC I&S BAT Document in units of kilograms of CO2 per tonne of liquid steel produced. The CO2 
emissions range from 205 to 240 kg CO2 per tonne liquid steel. The conversion factors provided in Table 4.1 of 
the IPPC I&S BAT Document are 940 kg pig iron per tonne liquid steel and 1160 kg sinter per tonne pig iron. 
Based on these conversion factors the average CO2 emissions from the four European sinter plants is 0.2 kg CO2 
per kg sinter produced.   
The CO2 emission factor for blast furnace iron making is derived by averaging plant-specific CO2 emissions data 
for European sinter plants reported in the IPPC I&S BAT Document. The CO2 and CO content of blast furnace 
gas produced by the iron making process is reported in Tables 7.2 and 7.3 of the IPPC I&S BAT Document in 
units of kilograms of CO2 per tonne of pig iron produced and kilograms of CO per tonne of pig iron produced. 
The CO2 content ranges from 400 to 900 kg CO2 per tonne pig iron produced and the CO content ranges from 
300 to 700 kg CO per tonne of pig iron produced. Based on the assumption that all of the blast furnace gas 
burned for energy recovery (and combusted to CO2) within the integrated iron and steel mill and that no blast 
furnace gas is transferred off site, this corresponds to an emission factor of 1.35 kg CO2 per kg pig iron produced.

Note that the CO2 emission factor for EAF steelmaking in this table is based on production of steel from scrap metal, and therefore the 
EAF emission factor does not account for any CO2 emissions from blast furnace iron making.  The Tier 1 CO2 emission factor for EAFs in 
this table is therefore not applicable to EAFs that use pig iron as a raw material. 
 
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
4.26 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
The emission factor for pellet production is based on the IPPC I&S BAT Document which provides an emission 
factor range of 15.6 to 31.8 kg CO2 per tonne product. However, the CO2 emission factor for a specific process 
will depend on the characteristic of the raw materials and fuels used in the process. The emission factor would 
vary depending upon whether coal, natural gas, or coke oven gas was used as the primary fuel. The ‘default’ 
emission factor provided is at the high end of the range, 30 kg CO2 per tonne product, and should be used if the 
inventory compiler does not know anything about the fuels or raw materials used. If the inventory compiler 
knows the inputs used, CO2 emissions should be calculated using the Tier 2 method, accounting for the fuel 
consumption, heating value and carbon content of the fuel.  
For the purposes of Tier 1 emission calculations, it is assumed that the default fuel for production of Direct 
Reduced Iron is natural gas. Natural gas-based processes account for the vast majority of installed direct reduced 
iron (DRI) production capacity worldwide, with 63 percent of that capacity being the MIDREX process. Fuel 
consumption for production of direct reduced iron using the MIDREX process is typically 10.5 - 14.5 GJ natural 
gas/metric tonne solid DRI assuming 100 percent lump iron ore operation.  Fuel consumption for production of 
hot briquetted iron from iron fines was reported to be 12.5 GJ natural gas per tonne of product for the FINMET 
process and 14 GJ natural gas per tonne of product for the CIRCORED process. The default energy consumption 
of 12.5 GJ natural gas per tonne of DRI produced and the default carbon content of natural gas of 15.3 kg carbon 
per GJ natural gas correspond to a CO2 emission factor of 191.3 kg carbon per tonne DRI produced (0.7 tonnes 
CO2 per tonne DRI produced). 
 
Methane emission factors 
Default CH4 emission factors are provided in Table 4.2 below. The Tier 1 CH4 emission factor for coke 
production is derived by averaging plant-specific CH4 emissions data for 11 European coke plants reported in the 
IPPC I&S BAT Document.  Emissions of CH4 are reported in Table 6.2 and Table 6.3 of the IPPC I&S BAT 
Document in units of grams of CH4 per tonne of liquid steel produced. The CH4 emissions reported range from 
27 to 32 grams CH4 per tonne liquid steel. Based on the conversion factors the average CH4 emissions from the 
11 European coke plants is 0.1 grams CH4 per tonne coke produced.   
The Tier 1 CH4 emission factor for sinter production is derived by averaging plant-specific CH4 emissions data 
for European sinter plants reported in the EMEP/CORINAIR Emissions Inventory Guidebook (EEA, 2005) and 
in other emission inventory reports. Emissions of CH4 are reported in Table 8.2a of the EMEP/CORINAIR 
Emission Inventory Guidebook for sinter and palletising plants. For sinter plants using coke breeze an emission 
factor of 50 mg CH4 per MJ was reported and a range of coke input of 38 to 55 kg coke per tonne sinter was 
reported. This corresponds to an average emission factor of 0.07 kg CH4 per tonne sinter using the default value 
of 28.2 TJ/Gg coke. An emission factor of 0.05 kg CH4 per tonne sinter was reported for sinter plants operating 
in Finland. (Pipatti, 2001)

TIER 2 METHOD 
The default carbon contents in Table 4.3 should be used if an inventory compiler does not have information on 
conditions in iron and steel-making facilities and coke production facilities, but has detailed activity data for the 
process materials and offsite transfers. The Tier 2 method, as described in Equation 4.2 for integrated coke 
production, Equations 4.9 to 4.11 for iron and steel production and Equation 4.3 for non-integrated coke 
production includes the major material flows in iron and steel-making and coke production that lead to 
emissions.  Carbon contents in Table 4.3 are based on those provided in Table 1.2 and 1.3 in Volume 2, Chapter 
1.

TIER 3 METHODS 
The Tier 3 method is based on aggregated plant-specific emission estimates or the application of the Tier 2 
equations at a plant specific level. The inventory compiler should ensure that each facility has documented the 
emission factors and carbon contents used, and that these emission factors are indicative of the processes and 
materials used at the facility. The Tier 3 method requires carbon contents and production/consumption mass 
rates for all of the process materials and off-site transfers such as those listed in Table 4.3. While Table 4.3 
provides default carbon contents, it is good practice under Tier 3 to adjust these values to reflect variations at the 
plant level from default values represented in the table. The default factors listed in Table 4.3 are only 
appropriate for the Tier 3 method if plant-specific information indicates that they correspond to actual 
conditions. It is anticipated that for the Tier 3 method the plant-specific data would include both carbon content 
data and production/consumption mass rate data, and that therefore the default values in Table 4.3 would not be 
applied to the Tier 3 method in most instances. 
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
4.28 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.2.2.4 
CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
TIER 1 METHOD 
The Tier 1 method requires only the amount of steel produced in the country by process type, the total amount of 
pig iron produced that is not processed into steel, and the total amount of coke, direct reduced iron, pellets, and 
sinter produced; in this case the total amount of coke produced is assume to be produced in integrated coke 
production facilities. These data may be available from governmental agencies responsible for manufacturing 
statistics, business or industry trade associations, or individual iron and steel companies. If a country only has 
aggregate data available, a weighted factor should be used.  Total crude steel production is defined as the total 
output of usable ingots, continuously-cast semi-finished products, and liquid steel for castings. 
TIER 2 METHOD 
The Tier 2 method requires the total amount of iron and steel, coke oven gas, blast furnace gas, and process 
materials such as limestone used for iron and steel production, direct reduced iron production, and sinter 
production in the country, in addition to onsite and offsite production of coke. These data may be available from 
governmental agencies responsible for manufacturing or energy statistics, business or industry trade associations, 
or individual iron and steel companies. These amounts can then be multiplied by the appropriate default carbon 
contents in Table 4.3 and summed to determine total CO2 emission from the sector. However, activity data 
collected at the plant-level is preferred (Tier 3).  If this is not a key category and data for total industry-wide 
reducing agents and process materials are not available, emissions can be estimated using the Tier 1 approach.  
TIER 3 METHOD 
The Tier 3 method requires collection, compilation, and aggregation of facility-specific measured emissions data 
or facility-specific process material production/consumption mass data and carbon content data  The Tier 3 
method can be based on a plant-specific mass balance approach (for CO2 emissions) or on plant-specific direct 
emissions monitoring data (for both CO2 and CH4 emissions) .  The Tier 3 method also may require activity data 
to be collected at the plant level and aggregated for the sectors. The plant-specific data should preferably be 
aggregated from data furnished by individual iron and steel and coke production companies. The amounts of 
process materials are more accurately determined in this manner. These data may also be available from 
governmental agencies responsible for manufacturing or energy statistics, or from business or industry trade 
associations. The appropriate amounts can then be multiplied by facility specific carbon content data and 
summed to determine total CO2 emissions from the sectors, and the total emissions will be more accurate than 
when using the Tier 2 method. This approach also allows for additional accuracy by allowing individual 
companies to provide more accurate plant-specific data and/or to use more relevant carbon contents that may 
differ from the default factors used in Tier 2 method. 
4.2.2.5 
COMPLETENESS 
RELATIONSHIP TO THE ENERGY SECTOR 
In estimating emissions from this source category: coke production (Energy) and iron and steel production 
(IPPU), there is a risk of double counting or omission in either the Industrial Processes or the Energy Sector. 
Since the primary use of carbon sources (predominantly coke, but also coal, oil, natural gas, limestone, etc.) is to 
produce pig iron, the CO2 and CH4 emissions from iron and steel production including sinter production are 
considered industrial process emissions and should be reported as such. The CO2 and CH4 emissions from coke 
production (both fuel consumption and conversion losses) are categorised as energy production and should be 
reported as such. However, for integrated production and iron and steel  with onsite coke production, there may 
be flows of by-products (e.g., coke oven gas, blast furnace gas, coke oven by-products) between the coke 
production facility and the iron and steel production facility, creating potential double counting issues. Carbon 
consumed in the from of coke oven gas at an iron and steelmaking facility and the resulting CO2 and CH4 
emissions would be categorized as IPPU emissions and reported as such.  Carbon consumed in the form of blast 
furnace gas at an onsite coke production facility and the resulting CO2 and CH4 emissions would be categorized 
as Energy emissions and should reported as such  Tracking of such carbon flows will require good knowledge of 
the inventory in that source category.  
Because of the dominant role of coke, it is important to consider the existence of coke making at a facility and 
define the boundary limits of a carbon balance at an iron and steelmaking facility to assure that CO2 emissions 
are not double-counted. CO2 and CH4 emissions associated with onsite and offsite coke making are to be 
reported under Energy Sector (see Volume 2).  
Chapter 4: Metal Industry Emissions 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.29 
OTHER FORMS OF CARBON 
Although the dominant means of producing crude iron, or pig iron, is the blast furnace using coke, other forms of 
carbon (e.g., pulverized coal, coal derivatives, recycled plastics or tires, natural gas, or fuel oil) can also be used 
to substitute for some portion of the coke in the blast furnace. In these cases, these materials should be accounted 
for as process sources of carbon in the same manner as coke, and care should be taken to deduct these materials 
from any general energy statistics if they are included there. Iron can also be produced in other types of iron 
making vessels besides blast furnaces, often using natural gas or coal instead of coke, and these carbon sources 
should be accounted for in the same manner as coke because they are serving the same purpose. 
In most blast furnaces, the iron making process is aided by the use of carbonate fluxes (limestone or dolomite). 
Because these materials are necessary raw materials for the process, they should be accounted for as part of the 
iron and steelmaking inventory. Again, however, care should be taken not to double-count emissions associated 
with limestone and dolomite usage if accounted for separately in the minerals sector. (See Section 2.5, Other 
Process Uses of Carbonates, in this volume.) 
SINTER 
Some integrated facilities also utilize sinter plants to convert iron-bearing fines into an agglomerate (or sinter) 
suitable for use as a raw material in the blast furnace. Typically, coke fines (or coke breeze) are used as a fuel in 
the sintering process and are a source of CO2 and CH4 emissions.  If the coke fines are produced at a coke plant 
within the facility and the CO2 and CH4 emissions are accounted for in the coal entering the facility, or if the 
coke breeze is otherwise accounted for as purchased coke, the CO2 and CH4 emissions from coke used in 
sintering should not be double-counted.  Emissions from sinter production are categorised as IPPU emissions 
and should be reported as such. 
EXHAUST GASES 
It is important not to double count the use of blast-furnace-derived by-product gases such as blast furnace gas, or 
recovered BOF off-gas as energy in the energy sector as sources of CO2, if they have been accounted for as 
process emissions. Process emissions should include all carbon inputs in the blast furnace, used as the primary 
reductant. In a typical fully integrated coke and iron and steel plant situation, adjustments may need to be made 
for coke oven by-products and the carbon content of shipped steel, which should be clearly mentioned in the 
description of the sources. In some cases, it may also be necessary to make adjustments for blast furnace gas, or 
iron that may be sold or transferred offsite. The process flow of exhaust gases are clearly illustrated in Figures 
4.1-4.5. 
ELECTRODE CONSUMPTION 
Electrode consumption amounts to about 3.5 kg/tonne for EAF furnaces. However, depending upon the 
characteristics of the charged materials, some carbon may be added to the EAF (typically about 20 kg/tonne) for 
process control purposes or may be contained in the charged materials themselves as iron substitutes, an 
increasingly more frequent trend. In these cases, CO2 and CH4 emissions from these additional carbon-bearing 
materials should be considered process-related and accounted for in the inventory because their carbon content is 
not as likely to have been accounted for elsewhere in the inventory. In addition, if natural gas is used to enhance 
reactions in an EAF as reducing agent it should be accounted for as a carbon source as all process materials used 
in iron and steel manufacturing are reported as IPPU emissions. 
Some specialty steel production takes place in electric induction furnaces, in which case the charge is 100 
percent steel scrap and where there are no carbon electrodes. There are no appreciable CO2 or CH4 emissions 
from this steelmaking process. 
OHF PROCESS 
Although the OHF is no longer prevalent, it may be necessary to inventory CO2 and CH4 emissions from this 
steelmaking process in some countries. An open hearth furnace is typically charged with both molten iron and 
scrap as in the case of a BOF, and oxygen is injected into the furnace, but reduction of carbon in the iron and 
melting of the charge also takes place by firing fossil fuels (e.g., natural gas, fuel oil, coal or tar) across the 
surface of the raw material bath.  Carbon in the iron may be ignored, as in the case of the BOF, because it has 
been accounted for as a source of carbon for iron-making. However, carbon in the fuels used in the open hearth 
process should be accounted for as IPPU emissions. 
4.2.2.6 
DEVELOPING A CONSISTENT TIME SERIES 
Emissions from coke production, sinter production, and iron and steel and production should be calculated using 
the same method for every year in the time series. Where data are unavailable to support a more rigorous method 
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
4.30 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
for all years in the time series, these gaps should be recalculated according to the guidance provided in Volume 1, 
Chapter 5, Time Series Consistency and Recalculation. 
4.2.3 
Uncertainty assessment 
The default emission factors for coke production and iron and steel production used in Tier 1 may have an 
uncertainty of ± 25 percent.  Tier 2 material-specific carbon contents would be expected to have an uncertainty 
of 10 percent. Tier 3 emission factors would be expected to be within 5 percent if plant-specific carbon content 
and mass rate data are available. Table 4.4 provides an overview of the uncertainties for emission factors, carbon 
contents and activity data. 
 
For Tier 1 the most important type of activity data is the amount of steel produced using each method. National 
statistics should be available and likely have an uncertainty of ± 10 percent. For Tier 2, the total amount of 
reducing agents and process materials used for iron and steel production would likely be within 10 percent.   Tier 
3 requires plant-specific information on the amounts of reducing agents and process materials (about 5 percent 
uncertainty).  Also actual emissions data for Tier 3 would be expected to have ± 5 percent uncertainty. Tier 3 
uncertainty may be more accurately derived based on an analysis of the actual data received. 
4.2.4 
Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC), 
Reporting and Documentation 
4.2.4.1 
QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL (QA/QC) 
It is good practice to conduct quality control checks as outlined in Volume 1, Chapter 6, and an expert review of 
the emissions estimates. Additional quality control checks as outlined in Volume 1, Chapter 6, and quality 
assurance procedures may also be applicable, particularly if higher tier methods are used to determine emissions 
from this source category. Inventories agencies are encouraged to use higher tier QA/QC for key categories as 
identified in Volume 1, Chapter 4. 
In addition to the guidance in Volume 1, specific procedures of relevance to this source category are outlined 
below. 
Review of emission factors and carbon contents 
Inventory compilers should compare aggregated national emission factors and carbon contents with the IPCC 
default factors carbon contents in order to determine if the national value is reasonable relative to the IPCC 
default. Differences between national default values should be explained and documented, particularly if they are 
representative of different circumstances.  
Site-specific activity data check 
For site-specific data, inventory compilers should review inconsistencies between sites to establish whether they 
reflect errors, different measurement techniques, or result from real differences in emissions, operational 
conditions or technology.  
Inventory compilers should ensure that emission factors and activity data are developed in accordance with 
internationally recognised and proven measurement methods. If the measurement practices fail this criterion,

then the use of these emissions or activity data should be carefully evaluated, uncertainty estimates reconsidered 
and qualifications documented. If there is a high standard of measurement and QA/QC is in place at most sites, 
then the uncertainty of the emissions estimates may be revised downwards. 
Expert review 
Inventory compilers should include key industrial trade organisations associated with iron and steel production 
in a review process. This process should begin early in the inventory development process to provide input to the 
development and review of methods and data acquisition 
Third party reviews are also useful for this source category, particularly related to initial data collection, 
measurement work, transcription, calculation and documentation. 
Activity data check 
For all tier levels, inventory compilers should check with Volume 2, Chapter 2 (Stationary Combustion of 
Energy Sector) to ensure that emissions from reducing agents and process materials (coal, coke, natural gas, etc.) 
are not double-counted or omitted. 
Inventory compilers should examine any inconsistency between data from different plants to establish whether 
these reflect errors, different measurement techniques or result from real differences in emissions, operational 
conditions or technology. This is particularly relevant to the plant-specific estimates of amounts of reducing 
agents or reported carbon content of process materials. 
Inventory compilers should compare aggregated plant-level estimates to industry totals for process materials 
consumption where such trade data are available. 
4.2.4.2 
REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION 
It is good practice to document and archive all information required to produce the national emissions inventory 
estimates as outlined in Volume 1, Section 6.11. It is not practical to include all documentation in the national 
inventory report.  However, the inventory should include summaries of methods used and references to source 
data such that the reported emissions estimates are transparent and steps in their calculation may be retraced.  
TIER 1 METHOD 
Besides reporting of estimated emissions, it is good practice to report the total steel production by process and 
corresponding emission factors used and to report the amount of iron produced that is not processed into steel. In 
the corresponding table, it should be noted that reported emissions are only part of total emissions from the 
sector and that coke production emissions are categorized as energy emissions and are reported in Volume 2, 
Chapter 2, Stationary Combustion of Energy Sector. 
TIER 2 METHODS 
Good practice is to document the estimated or calculated emissions, all activity data, and corresponding 
emission factors and any assumptions or data justifying alternative emission factors. There should be a clear 
explanation of the linkage with the source category 1A (Fuel Combustion) estimate for integrated coke 
production emissions to demonstrate that double counting or missing emissions have not occurred.  
TIER 3 METHOD 
Good practice is to document the calculated emissions and source of all data, taking into account the need to 
protect the confidentiality of data for specific facilities if the data are business-sensitive or of a proprietary nature. 
In addition, inventory compilers should for all tiers, document all information needed to reproduce the estimate, 
as well as the QA/QC procedures.

FERROALLOY PRODUCTION 
4.3.1 
Introduction 
Ferroalloy is the term used to describe concentrated alloys of iron and one or more metals such as silicon, 
manganese, chromium, molybdenum, vanadium and tungsten. Silicon metal production is usually included in the 
ferroalloy group because silicon metal production process is quite similar to the ferrosilicon process. These 
alloys are used for deoxidising and altering the material properties of steel. Ferroalloy facilities manufacture 
concentrated compounds that are delivered to steel production plants to be incorporated in alloy steels. Silicon 
metal is used in aluminium alloys, for production of silicones and in electronics. Ferroalloy production involves 
a metallurgical reduction process that results in significant carbon dioxide emissions. 
In ferroalloy production, raw ore, carbon materials and slag forming materials are mixed and heated to high 
temperatures for reduction and smelting. The carbonaceous reductants are usually coal and coke, but bio-carbon 
(charcoal and wood) is also commonly used as a primary or secondary carbon source. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and 
methane (CH4) emissions from coke production are estimated in Section 4.2 and reported within the Energy 
Sector. Electric submerged arc furnaces with graphite electrodes or consumable Søderberg electrodes are used. 
The heat is produced by the electric arcs and by the resistance in the charge materials. The furnaces may be open, 
semi-covered or covered. A commonly used technology is the submerged-arc open-top electric furnace (EAF). 
In the EAF, passing current through graphite electrodes suspended in a cup-shaped, refractory-lined steel shell 
accomplishes heating. Carbon reduction of the metallic oxides occurs as both coke and graphite electrodes are 
consumed. The carbon in the electrodes captures the oxygen from the metal oxides to form CO, while the ores 
are reduced to molten base metals. The component metals then combine in the solution. 
In addition to emissions originating from reducing agents and electrodes, the calcination of carbonate fluxes such 
as limestone or dolomite, when used, contribute to the emission of greenhouse gases.  
Primary emissions in covered arc furnaces consist almost entirely of CO as opposed to CO2, due to the strong 
reducing environment. This CO is either utilised for energy production in boilers, or it is flared. The energy 
produced is assumed to be used internally at the site and the carbon content of the CO subsequently converted to 
CO2 in-plant.   
The CO gas produced in open or semi-closed furnaces is burnt to CO2 above the charge level. Any CO emitted to 
the atmosphere is assumed to be converted to CO2 within days afterwards. While CO2 is the main greenhouse 
gas from ferroalloy production, recent research has shown that CH4, and N2O account for an equivalent 
greenhouse emission of up to 5 percent of the CO2 emissions from ferrosilicon (FeSi) and silicon-metal (Si-metal) 
production. Methodologies are presented for CO2 and CH4 emissions in this section.   These emissions should be 
better investigated for all ferroalloy production, and more measurements of these emissions should be done from 
FeSi and Si-metal production.  
4.3.2 
Methodological issues 
4.3.2.1 
CHOICE OF METHOD  
METHODOLOGY FOR CO2 
The IPCC Guidelines outline several approaches for calculating CO2 emissions from ferroalloy production. For 
practical purposes, this section adopts a mass balance approach where all CO emitted is reported as emitted CO2. 
The choice of a good practice method depends on national circumstances as shown in the decision tree in Figure 
4.9. The Tier 1 method calculates emissions from general emission factors applied to a country’s total ferroalloy 
production. The Tier 1 method is very simple, and it may lead to errors due to its reliance on assumptions rather 
than actual data. Therefore it is appropriate only when ferroalloy production is not a key category. The Tier 2 
method calculates emissions from a known consumption of reducing agents, preferably from plant-specific 
consumption data, but alternatively from industry-wide data using emission factors similar to those used to 
estimate combustion emissions. The Tier 3 method is based on facility-specific emissions data.  
Tier 1 method: production-based emission factors 
The simplest estimation method is to multiply default emission factors by ferroalloy product type as shown in 
Equation 4.15.

of carbon in carbonate ores and slag forming materials will vary. The most accurate method is therefore to

calculate the CO2 emissions from the total amount of carbon in reducing agents, electrode paste, ores, slag

METHODOLOGY FOR CH4 AND DISCUSSION OF N2O EMISSIONS  
The heating of carbon materials in the furnace releases volatiles including methane. With open or semi-covered 
furnaces – predominantly used for FeSi and Si ferroalloy production - most of the volatiles will burn to CO2 
above the charge, in the hood and off-gas channels, but some will remain un-reacted as CH4 and NMVOC. The 
amounts depend on the operation of the furnace. Sprinkle-charging will reduce the amounts of CH4 compared to 
batch-wise charging. Increased temperature in the hood (less false air) will reduce the content of CH4 further.  
The IPCC Guidelines outline several approaches for calculating CH4 emissions from FeSi- and Si- ferroalloy 
production. The choice of a good practice method depends on national circumstances as shown in the decision 
tree in Figure 4.10. The Tier 1 method calculates emissions from general emission factors applied to a country’s 
total ferroalloy production. The Tier 1 method is very simple, and it may lead to errors due to its reliance on 
assumptions rather than actual data. Therefore it should only be used when ferroalloy production is not a key 
category. The Tier 2 method calculates emissions from operation-specific emission factors. The Tier 3 method 
uses facility-specific emissions data.  
The errors associated with estimates or measurements of N2O emissions from the ferroalloys industry are very 
large and thus, a methodology is not provided.

4.3.2.2 
CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTORS 
EMISSION FACTORS FOR CO2 
Tier 1 method: production-based emission factors 
When the only data available are national ferroalloy production statistics, it is good practice to use default 
emission factors. However, because of widely disparate factors depending on the type of ferroalloy production, it 
is necessary to determine how much tonnage is produced by which method and then to sum the product of the 
factors shown in Table 4.5 and the appropriate production tonnages. These factors are based on expert judgement 
using typical practice for the ferroalloy production scenarios listed. If any bio-carbon, except some woodchips 
for FeSi and Si-metal production, is used, the factors cannot be employed.

These default emission factors have been assessed by Olsen (2004) for the manganese alloys, Lindstad (2004) 
for the silicon alloys and by Olsen, Monsen and Lindstad (1998) for FeCr.   
For FeMn alloys the emission factors are based on production where the Mn containing raw materials are a 
mixture of oxide ores, carbonate ores and imported Mn-sinter. If the sinter is produced abroad it will not give 
any contribution to the national greenhouse gas inventory. Emission from sinter production must be reported 
where the production is located. 
The factor for FeSi90 and Si-metal is based on a Fix C consumption of 110  percent of the stoichiometric amount 
needed for reduction of SiO2. For the other FeSi-alloys the factor is based on 114  percent of the stoichiometric 
amount of Fix C. 
Tier 2 method: production-based, raw material specific emission factors 
The emission factors for the reducing agents used in production of manganese and silicon alloys are given in 
Table 4.6. The factors have been assessed by Olsen (2004) for use in manganese alloys production and by 
Lindstad (2004) for use in silicon alloys.

Tier 3 method: calculations based on amounts and analyses of reducing agents 
 For the Tier 3 method, it is necessary to determine the carbon contents of the reducing agents used in the 
production processes. But most ferroalloys producers analyse only on the basis of percentage of ash and volatiles, 
and calculate: 
Fix C % = 100 % – % Ash – % Volatiles. 
In that case, the total C-contents of reducing agents. is calculated by the following equation.

EMISSION FACTORS FOR CH4 
Tier 1 method: FeSi and Si alloy production-based emission factors 
When the only data available are national ferroalloy production statistics, it is good practice to use default 
emission factors. However, because of the disparate factors depending on the type of ferroalloy production, it is 
necessary to determine how much tonnage is produced by which method and then to sum the product of the 
factors shown in Table 4.7 and the appropriate production tonnages. The default emission factors for CH4 is 
based on the averages of a small number of operation-specific measurements (shown in Table 4.7 for Tier 2) 
carried out by SINTEF and DNV mainly in 1995 and 1998 (FFF (2000)).

Tier 3 method: Direct measurements 
Tier 3 is based on measurements rather than emission factors.  The inventory compiler should consult guidance 
on plant-level measurements outlined in Volume 1, Chapter 2, and on QA/QC of measurements in Volume 1, 
Chapter 6.  
4.3.2.3 
CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
TIER 1 METHOD 
The Tier 1 method requires only the amount of ferroalloy produced in the country by product type.  These data 
may be available from governmental agencies responsible for manufacturing statistics, business or industry trade 
associations, or individual ferroalloy companies. These tonnages can then be multiplied by the corresponding 
emission factors in Table 4.5 to estimate CO2 emissions from the sector and Table 4.7 to estimate CH4 emissions 
from the sector. 
TIER 2 METHOD 
The Tier 2 method requires the total amount of reducing agent and other process materials used for ferroalloy 
production in the country, and knowledge of processes used. These data may be available from governmental 
agencies responsible for manufacturing or energy statistics, business or industry trade associations, or individual 
ferroalloy companies.  These amounts can then be multiplied by the appropriate generic emission factors in 
Tables 4.6 and 4.8 and summed to determine total CO2 and CH4 emissions from the sector. However, activity 
data collected at the plant-level is preferred.   
TIER 3 METHOD 
The Tier 3 method requires collection, compilation, and aggregation of facility-specific emissions data. These 
data may be available directly from companies. 
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
4.40 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.3.2.4 
COMPLETENESS 
In estimating emissions from this source category, there is a risk of double-counting or omission in either the 
Industrial Processes or the Energy Sector. Since the primary use of carbon sources (coal, coke, limestone, 
dolomite etc.) is to produce ferroalloys, the emissions are considered to be industrial process emissions and 
should be reported as such. It should be noted that the risk of double counting is particularly high for the Tier 1 
approach. Any deviation from reporting emissions as originating from an industrial process should be explicitly 
mentioned in the inventory, and a double-counting/completeness check should be performed. 
4.3.2.5 
DEVELOPING A CONSISTENT TIME SERIES 
Emissions from ferroalloy production should be calculated using the same method for every year in the time 
series. Where data are unavailable to support a Tier 3 method for all years in the time series, these gaps should 
be recalculated according to the guidance provided in Volume 1, Chapter 5. 
4.3.3 
Uncertainty assessment 
Uncertainties for ferroalloy production result predominantly from uncertainties associated with activity data, and 
to a lesser extent from uncertainty related to the emission factor. Although some ferroalloys may be produced 
using wood or other biomass as a carbon source, information and data regarding these practices were not 
available. Emissions from ferroalloys produced with wood or other biomass would not be counted under this 
source because wood-based carbon is of biogenic origin.  Emissions from ferroalloys produced with coking coal 
or graphite inputs would be counted in national trends, but may generate differing amounts of CO2 per unit of 
ferroalloy produced compared to the use of petroleum coke. 
4.3.3.1 
EMISSION FACTOR UNCERTAINTIES  
For Tier 3, actual emissions data would be expected to have less than 5 percent uncertainty. For Tier 2, the 
material-specific emission factors would be expected to be within 10 percent, which would provide less 
uncertainty overall than for Tier 1. Emission factors would be expected to be within 10 percent or less than 5 
percent if plant-specific carbon content data are available. The default emission factors used in Tier 1 may have 
an uncertainty of 25 to 50 percent. 
4.3.3.2 
ACTIVITY DATA UNCERTAINTIES 
For Tier 1 the most important type of activity data is the amount of ferroalloy production by product type. 
National statistics should be available and likely have an uncertainty less than 5 percent. Tier 2 applied with 
plant-specific information on the amounts of reducing agents and process materials as applied in Tier 2 method 
should not exceed 5 percent uncertainty.

Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC), 
Reporting and Documentation 
4.3.4.1 
QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL (QA/QC) 
It is good practice to conduct quality control checks as outlined in Volume 1, Chapter 6, and an expert review of 
the emissions estimates. Additional quality control checks as outlined in Volume 1, Chapter 6, and quality 
assurance procedures may also be applicable, particularly if higher tier methods are used to determine emissions 
from this source category. Inventories agencies are encouraged to use higher tier QA/QC for key categories as 
identified in Volume 1, Chapter 4. 
In addition to the guidance in Volume 1, specific procedures of relevance to this source category are outlined 
below. 
Review of emission factors 
Inventory compilers should compare aggregated national emission factors with the IPCC default factors in order 
to determine if the national factor is reasonable relative to the IPCC default. Differences between national factors 
and default factors should be explained and documented, particularly if they are representative of different 
circumstances.  
Site-specific activity data check 
For site-specific data, inventory compilers should review inconsistencies between sites to establish whether they 
reflect errors, different measurement techniques, or result from real differences in emissions, operational 
conditions or technology. For ferroalloy production, inventory compilers should compare plant data with other 
plants. 
Inventory compilers should ensure that emission factors and activity data are developed in accordance with 
internationally recognised and proven measurement methods. If the measurement practices fail this criterion, 
then the use of these emissions or activity data should be carefully evaluated, uncertainty estimates reconsidered 
and qualifications documented. If there is a high standard of measurement and QA/QC is in place at most sites, 
then the uncertainty of the emissions estimates may be revised downwards. 
Expert review 
Inventory compilers should include key industrial trade organisations associated with ferroalloy production in a 
review process. This process should begin early in the inventory development process to provide input to the 
development and review of methods and data acquisition 
Third party reviews are also useful for this source category, particularly related to initial data collection, 
measurement work, transcription, calculation and documentation. 
Activity data check 
For all tier levels, inventory compilers should check with Volume 2, Chapter 2, Stationary Combustion of 
Energy Sector, to ensure that emissions from reducing agents and process materials (coal, coke, natural gas, etc.) 
are not double-counted or omitted. 
Inventory compilers should examine any inconsistency between data from different plants to establish whether 
these reflect errors, different measurement techniques or result from real differences in emissions, operational 
conditions or technology. This is particularly relevant to the plant-specific estimates of amounts of reducing 
agents or reported carbon content of process materials. 
Inventory compilers should compare aggregated plant-level estimates to industry totals for process materials 
consumption where such trade data are available. 
4.3.4.2 
REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION 
It is good practice to document and archive all information required to produce the national emissions inventory 
estimates as outlined in Volume 1, Section 6.11. It is not practical to include all documentation in the national 
inventory report.  However, the inventory should include summaries of methods used and references to source 
data such that the reported emissions estimates are transparent and steps in their calculation may be retraced.  
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
4.42 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
TIER 1 METHOD 
Besides reporting of estimated emissions, it is good practice to report the total ferroalloy production by process 
and corresponding emission factors used. In the corresponding table, it should be noted that reported emissions 
are only part of total emissions from the sector and the rest are reported elsewhere Volume 2, Chapter 2, 
Stationary Combustion of Energy Sector. 
TIER 2 METHODS 
Good practice is to document the estimated or calculated emissions, all activity data, and corresponding 
emission factors and any assumptions or data justifying alternative emission factors. There should be a clear 
explanation of the linkage with the Fuel Combustion Sub-Sector estimate to demonstrate that double counting or 
missing emissions have not occurred.  
TIER 3 METHOD 
Good practice is to document the calculated emissions and source of all data, taking into account the need to 
protect the confidentiality of data for specific facilities if the data are business-sensitive or of a proprietary nature. 
In addition, inventory compilers should for all tiers, document all information needed to reproduce the estimate, 
as well as the QA/QC procedures.

PRIMARY ALUMINIUM PRODUCTION 
4.4.1 
Introduction 
This section covers process emissions from primary aluminium production2. Worldwide, primary aluminium is 
produced exclusively by the Hall-Heroult electrolytic process. In this process, electrolytic reduction cells differ 
in the form and configuration of the carbon anode and alumina feed system and belong to one of four technology 
types: Centre-Worked Prebake (CWPB)3, Side-Worked Prebake (SWPB), Horizontal Stud Søderberg (HSS) and 
Vertical Stud Søderberg (VSS). 
The most significant process emissions are: 
(i) Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the consumption of carbon anodes in the reaction to convert 
aluminium oxide to aluminium metal; 
(ii) Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) emissions of CF4 and C2F6 during anode effects. 
Also emitted are smaller amounts of process emissions, CO, SO2, and NMVOC. SF6 is not emitted during the 
electrolytic process and is only rarely used in the aluminium manufacturing process, where small quantities are 
emitted when fluxing specialized high magnesium aluminium alloys4.  
The decision trees in Figures 4.11 and 4.12 provide guidance for selecting a methodology estimating emissions 
from aluminium production. All inventory compilers in countries with aluminium production should be able to 
implement at a minimum level the Tier 1 method and thereby ensure completeness of reporting. Although this 
chapter presents default emission factors for both CO2 and PFC emissions, countries should make every effort to 
use higher Tier methods because emission rates can vary greatly, and the uncertainty associated with Tier 1 
factors is very high. Aluminium smelters routinely collect the process data needed for calculation of Tier 2 
emissions factors. 
4.4.2 
Methodological issues 
4.4.2.1 
CHOICE OF METHOD FOR CO2 EMISSIONS FROM PRIMARY 
ALUMINIUM PRODUCTION 
During normal operations, aluminium is produced at the cathode and carbon is consumed at the anode per the 
electrolytic reduction reaction: 
 
2Al2O3 + 3C � 4Al + 3CO2 
 
Most carbon dioxide emissions result from the electrolysis reaction of the carbon anode with alumina (Al2O3). 
The consumption of prebaked carbon anodes and Søderberg paste is the principal source of process related 
carbon dioxide emissions from primary aluminium production. Other sources of process related carbon dioxide 
emissions associated with Prebake anode baking account for less than 10 percent of the total non-energy related 
carbon dioxide emissions. 
The reactions leading to carbon dioxide emissions are well understood and the emissions are very directly 
connected to the tonnes of aluminium produced through the fundamental electrochemical equations for alumina 
reduction at a carbon anode and oxidation from thermal processes. Both of these fundamental processes 
                                                           
2  Emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels associated with primary aluminium production, bauxite mining, bauxite ore 
refining, and aluminium production from recycled sources are covered in Volume 2: Energy. Also, carbon dioxide 
emissions associated with production of electricity from fossil fuel combustion to produce aluminium are also covered in 
Volume 2.

4  A 2004 IAI survey found no evidence of SF6 being emitted from primary aluminium smelting through the Hall-Heroult 
electrolytic production process.

producing carbon dioxide are included in process parameters routinely monitored at the production facilities, the 
net anode carbon consumed for Prebake facilities, or anode paste consumption for Søderberg facilities. 
For the CO2 emissions calculation, production data require technology differentiation as Søderberg or 
Prebake.There is no need for further differentiation as to the specific type of Søderberg or Prebake technology. 
The decision tree shown in Figures 4.11 describes good practice in choosing the CO2 inventory methodology 
appropriate for national circumstances.

Tier 1 method for CO2 emissions 
The Tier 1 method for calculating CO2 emissions uses only broad cell technology characterizations (Prebake or 
Søderberg) as a lower order estimate of CO2 emissions from aluminium production. Given the uncertainty 
associated with the Tier 1 method, it is good practice to use higher tier methods if CO2 from primary aluminium 
is a key category. 
Total CO2 emissions are calculated according to Equation 4.20.

Tier 2 or Tier 3 methods for CO2 emissions 
For both the Prebake and Søderberg processes CO2 emissions are calculated using a mass balance approach that 
assumes that the carbon content of net anode consumption or paste consumption is ultimately emitted as CO2.  
The Tier 2 methods for both Prebake and Søderberg processes make use of typical industry values for impurities 
while the Tier 3 methods uses actual concentrations of impurities.  The choice of method between the Tier 2 and 
Tier 3 method will depend on whether anode or paste composition data are available at the individual plant level.  
CO2 emissions for Prebake cells (CWPB and SWPB): 
The CO2 emissions for the Tier 2 and the Tier 3 method for Prebake cells are calculated according to Equation 
4.21. Tier 3 requires specific operating facility data for all the components in Equation 4.21, whereas Tier 2 is 
based on default values for some of the components. Section 4.4.2.2 below provides more details on using these 
parameters.

Emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels used in the production of baked anodes are covered in Volume 2:

combustion of volatile matter released during the baking operation and the combustion of baking furnace 
packing material (coke). Equations 4.22 and 4.23 can be used for the calculation of such emissions.5

CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTORS FOR CO2 EMISSIONS FROM 
PRIMARY ALUMINIUM PRODUCTION 
Tier 1 method for CO2 emissions 
Table 4.10 lists the default emission factors for CO2 per tonne of aluminium. The emission factors of 1.6 and 1.7 
for Prebake and Søderberg technologies are based on International Aluminium Institute (IAI) global survey data 
(International Aluminium Institute, Life Cycle Assessment of Aluminium , 2000).

Tier 2 and Tier 3 emission factors for CO 2 emissions 
CO2 emissions for Prebake cells (CWPB and SWPB): 
The most significant factors in Equation 4.21 are metal production and net anode consumption for Prebake 
technology.  Both these parameters should be collected from individual operating facilities for use with the Tier 
2 or the Tier 3. Other terms in the equation make minor adjustments for non-carbon components of the anodes 
(for example, sulphur and ash) and thus are not as critical.  Tier 3 is based on the use of specific operating 
facility data for these minor components, whereas Tier 2 is based on default values listed in Tables 4.11 to 4.13. 
Tier 3 improves the accuracy of the results, but the improvement in accuracy is not expected to exceed 5 percent.  
Carbon consumed per tonne of aluminium produced is typically recorded by primary aluminium production 
facilities given its economic significance. Facilities using prebake cells refer to this consumption as ‘net anode or 
net carbon consumption,’ and those using Søderberg cells refer to it as ‘anode paste consumption.’ 
                                                           
7  The emission factor for Prebake cells includes CO2 emissions from the combustion of pitch volatiles and packing coke 
from baking anodes.

CO2 emissions for Søderberg cells (VSS and HSS): 
The binder content in paste, BC, typically varies by less than 1 percent and is part of operation practice by 
facility. It is an important term in Equation 4.24 because the carbon content of the pitch, which acts as a binder, 
is lower than that of the coke, which makes up the remainder of the paste. As was noted previously for Prebake 
anode consumption, the most important components of Equation 4.24 are the metal production and paste 
consumption.  The other terms in Equation 4.24 make small corrections based on impurities and minor 
differences in carbon content of paste materials. Tier 3 is based on the use of specific operating facility data for 
these minor components, whereas Tier 2 is based on default values listed in Table 4.14. Tier 3 improves the 
accuracy of the results; however, the impact can be expected to be less than 5 percent on the result.

CHOICE OF METHOD FOR PFCS 
During electrolysis, alumina (Al2O3) is dissolved in a fluoride melt comprising about 80 weight percent cryolite 
(Na3AlF6). Perfluorocarbons (CF4 and C2F6 collectively referred to as PFCs) are formed from the reaction of the 
carbon anode with the cryolite melt during a process upset condition known as an ‘anode effect’. An anode effect 
occurs when the concentration of alumina in the electrolyte is too low to support the standard anode reaction. 
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
4.50 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
BOX 4.2 
ANODE EFFECT DESCRIPTION 
An anode effect is a process upset condition where an insufficient amount of alumina is dissolved 
in the electrolyte, causing voltage to be elevated above the normal operating range, resulting in the 
emission of PFC-containing gases. 
Both Tier 2 and Tier 3 for PFCs are based on plant-specific process data for anode effects, which are regularly 
collected. In choosing a method for PFCs, it should be noted that the uncertainty associated with higher tier 
methodologies is significantly lower than that for Tier 1, and therefore Tier 2 and Tier 3 are strongly 
recommended if this is a key category. Depending on the production technology type, the uncertainty of the 
methods for PFCs ranges from several hundred percent for the Tier 1 method to less than twenty percent for the 
Tier 3 method.  The Tier 3 methodology for PFC inventory should be utilized with slope or overvoltage 
coefficients calculated from measurement data obtained using good measurement practices (U.S. EPA and IAI, 
2003). Communication with primary aluminium producers will determine the availability of process data, which, 
in turn dictates the method used to calculate emissions. Plants routinely measure anode effect performance as 
anode effect minutes per cell-day or anode effect overvoltage. PFC emissions are directly related to anode effect 
performance via a coefficient, either the slope coefficient or the overvoltage coefficient.  
The decision tree shown in Figure 4.12 describes good practice in choosing the PFC inventory methodology 
appropriate for national circumstances. For high performing facilities that emit very small amounts of PFCs, the 
Tier 3 method will likely not provide a significant improvement in the overall facility GHG inventory in 
comparison with the Tier 2 Method.8  Consequently, it is good practice to identify these facilities prior to 
selecting methods in the interest of prioritising resources. The parameters that identify these high performing 
facilities depend on the type of process data collected by the facility. High performing facilities are those that 
operate with less than 0.2 anode effect minutes per cell day when anode effect minutes are measured.  When 
overvoltage is recorded, high performing facilities operate with less than 1.4 mV overvoltage. In addition, for 
these high performing facilities accurate measurement of the Tier 3 PFC coefficient is difficult because the very 
low frequency of anode effects requires an extended time to obtain statistically robust results. The status of a 
facility as a high performing facility should be assessed annually because economic factors, such as the restarts 
of production lines after a period of inactivity, or, process factors, such as periods of power curtailments might 
cause temporary increases in anode effect frequency.  In addition, over time, facilities that might not at first meet 
the requirements for high performers may become high performing facilities through implementation of new 
technology or improved work practices. Note that in all cases, applying different Tiers for different years will 
require careful implementation to ensure time series consistency. 
For all other facilities, the Tier 3 approach is preferred because plant-specific coefficients will lead to estimates 
that are more accurate. If no PFC measurements have been made to establish a plant-specific coefficient, the Tier 
2 Method can be used until measurements have been made and Tier 3 coefficients are established. Countries can 
use a combination of Tier 2 and Tier 3 depending on the type of data available from individual facilities. 
 
Tier 1 method: Use of technology based default emission factors 
The Tier 1 method uses technology-based default emission factors for the four main production technology types 
(CWPB, SWPB, VSS and HSS). PFC emissions can be calculated according to Equation 4.25. The level of 
uncertainty in the Tier 1 method is much greater because individual facility anode effect performance, which is 
the key determinant of anode effects and thus PFC emissions, are not directly taken into account. Tier 1 can be 
consistent with good practice only when PFCs from primary aluminium is not a key category and when pertinent 
process data are not available from operating facilities. 
                                                           
8  The levels for the process parameters that define high performing facilities for PFC emissions are the combined result of 
the magnitude of, and, the uncertainty in the Tier 2 coefficient.  The levels are calculated by using the positive and negative 
extremes of the 95% confidence limits for the Tier 2 coefficient as a proxy for the range of likely values for Tier 3 
coefficients for these facilities.  The potential difference is then assessed on the overall greenhouse gas emissions from a 
production facility considering both PFC and CO2 emissions. When facilities operate at or below the anode effect process 
parameter levels noted here for high performing facilities, the impact of moving from the Tier 2 method for PFCs to the 
Tier 3 method would not result in a change greater than 5% in overall GWP weighted GHG emissions. PFC emissions 
from high performing facilities account for less than 3% of global PFC emissions based on IAI 2004 anode effect survey 
data.

There are two different equations for estimating individual plant CF4 emissions, which are both based on the 
relationship between anode effect and performance. These are the slope and overvoltage coefficient equations. 
Both types of coefficients are based on direct measurements of PFCs. Tier 2 makes use of an average coefficient 
from measurements at numerous facilities while Tier 3 is based on measurements at the individual facility. 
Because the process mechanisms that produce PFC emissions are similar for CF4 and C2F6, the two gases should 
be considered together when estimating PFC emissions. C2F6 emissions are calculated in all the methods 
described herein as a fraction of CF4 emissions. 
With an established relationship between anode effect process data and PFC emissions, process data collected on 
an on-going basis can be used to calculate PFC emissions in lieu of direct measurement of PFCs. The choice 
between the two estimation relationships depends on the process control technology in use. Equation 4.26 should 
be used when anode effect minutes per cell day are recorded and Equation 4.27 should be used when overvoltage 
data are recorded. 
Slope Coefficient: The slope coefficient represents the kg of CF4 per tonne of aluminium produced, divided by 
anode effect minutes per cell-day9. Since PFC emissions are measured per tonne of aluminium produced, it 
includes the effects of cell amperage and current efficiency, the two main factors determining the amount of 
aluminium produced in the cell. Equation 4.26 describes the slope method for both CF4 and C2F6.

Overvoltage Coefficient: Some process control systems characterize anode effects by calculating an Anode 
Effect Overvoltage10 (AEO) statistic. AEO is defined as the extra cell voltage above the target operating voltage, 
and this parameter has been shown to be a good predictor of PFC emissions when recorded by the process 
control system.  The AEO process control technology is in use at many modern smelters. AEO is calculated by 
summing the product of time and voltage above the target operating voltage and dividing this figure by the time 
over which data were collected.

Note:
1. High performing facilities emit so little PFCs that no significant improvement can be expected in the overall facility GHG inventory by 
using the Tier 3 method rather than the Tier 2 method. High performing facilities are defined, based on what process data are collected, as 
those that operate with less than 0.2 anode effect minutes per cell day, or, less than 1.4 mV overvoltage. In such facilities the improvement 
in accuracy in facility GHG inventory is less than 5% when moving from Tier 2 to Tier 3 methods for PFCs.
2. Good practices for obtaining facility specific PFC equation coefficients are detailed in the IAI GHG Protocol (IAI, 2005).
3. In this case, Tier 2 method should be used until site-specific Tier 3 coefficients become available and the Tier 3 method employed unless 
PFC emissions become immaterial, in which case facilities can choose to use either the Tier 2 or Tier 3 method.

11 These slope coefficients were derived from measurement of PFCs and correlating the measured PFC emissions to anode 
effect minutes per cell day at over one-hundred aluminium smelters.  The values in Table 4.16 are the technology specific 
factors from measurement data available as of March 2005 when this document was developed. It is important to note Tier 
2 slope coefficients are based on the anode-effect minutes per cell-day statistic as defined in the IAI GHG Protocol (IAI, 
2005a). It is good practice to refer to the most current data for calculation of PFC emissions as noted in the IAI GHG 
Protocol and to the IPCC Emission Factor Database.   
Chapter 4: Metal Industry Emissions 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.55 
Tier 3: PFC emission factor based on a facility specific relationship between 
anode effect performance and PFC emissions 
The Tier 3 method is based on a facility specific slope or anode effect overvoltage PFC coefficient. This 
coefficient characterizes the relationship between facility anode effect performance and measured PFC emissions 
from periodic or continuous measurements that are consistent with established measurement practices (U.S. EPA 
and IAI, 2003) and the International Aluminium Institute GHG Protocol (IAI, 2005a). 
4.4.2.5 
CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
Production statistics should be available from every facility to enable use of Tier 1 methods for both CO2 and 
PFC emissions.  Uncertainty in the tonnes of aluminium produced is likely to be low in most countries. Given 
the expected universal availability of production data, production capacity data should only be used as a check 
on production statistics. 
Good practice methods for PFC emissions require accurate anode effect minutes per cell day data or accurate 
overvoltage (AEO) data for all cell types.  Annual statistics should be based on the production-weighted average 
of monthly anode effect data.  Both Tier 2 and Tier 3 utilize anode effect minutes per cell day or anode effect 
overvoltage, and aluminium production data. Individual aluminium companies or industry groups, national 
aluminium associations or the International Aluminium Institute, should be consulted to ensure that the data are 
available and in a useable format for inventory estimation.  
For CO2 emissions, all aluminium smelters collect data to support Tier 2 or Tier 3 methods.  Søderberg smelters 
collect anode paste consumption data while Prebake smelters record baked anode consumption. The Tier 2 and 
Tier 3 methods use the same equation for calculation of CO2 emissions; however, the Tier 3 method uses facility 
specific composition data for anode materials while the Tier 2 method uses industry average anode composition 
data. 
4.4.2.6 
COMPLETENESS 
Primary aluminium facilities will generally have good records of tonnes of aluminium produced throughout the 
entire time series covered by the inventory.  In addition, carbon consumption data are typically available over the 
same period.  Anode effect process data may be incomplete over the entire time series and measures may have to 
be employed, such as those described in Section 4.4.2.7, Developing a Consistent Time Series, to calculate PFC 
emissions over some portions of the inventory period. Primary aluminium production also utilizes large amount 
of electricity and care should be exercised to avoid omissions of carbon dioxide associated with electricity input, 
or, to avoid double counting of this carbon dioxide. 
4.4.2.7 
DEVELOPING A CONSISTENT TIME SERIES 
Aluminium production statistics will typically be available for the entire history of the facility. Developing a 
consistent time series for carbon dioxide emissions should not be a problem since most facilities historically 
have measured and recorded anode or paste consumption.  Where historic anode or paste consumption data are 
missing, carbon dioxide emissions can be estimated from aluminium production utilizing the Tier 1 method. 
A complete time series of PFC related activity data such as anode effect minutes per cell day or overvoltage 
gives the best time series results. Because PFC emissions only became a major focus area in the early 1990s for 
the global aluminium industry, some facilities may have limited information about the required anode effect data 
to implement Tier 2 or Tier 3 PFC inventory practices over the entire time covered by the inventory. Substantial 
errors and discontinuities can be introduced by reverting to Tier 1 methods for PFC emissions for years for 
which activity data are not available.  The appropriateness of applying Tier 2 or Tier 3 PFC emission factors 
back in time to a given facility and availability of detailed process data vary with the specific conditions. 
Generally, backcasting of Tier 2 or Tier 3 methods using splicing or surrogate data are preferred over use of Tier 
1 emission factors. Specifically, where only anode effect frequency data are available and anode effect duration 
data are unavailable, it is good practice to splice or backcast PFC emissions per tonne aluminium based on anode 
effect frequency data.  Currently many facilities are making PFC measurements that facilitate implementation of 
Tier 3 PFC inventory methods. There are a number of issues that impact on whether Tier 3 PFC emission factors 
can be extrapolated to past inventory periods.  Factors that should be considered include whether any technology 
upgrades have been implemented at the facility, whether there have been substantial changes in work practices, 
whether any changes in the calculation of underlying process data have occurred, and the quality of the 
measurements made to establish the Tier 3 coefficients. It is good practice to consult with representatives from 
the operating facilities, either directly or through regional or international organizations representing the industry 
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
4.56 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
to develop the best strategy for the specific group of operating locations included in the national inventory.  
Additional helpful information on splicing methods and details regarding constructing a time series for primary 
aluminium is available from IAI (IAI, 2005). Expert advice is also available from the International Aluminium 
Institute (London, UK) regarding greenhouse gas emissions and typical industry emissions from aluminium 
production.  
4.4.3 
Uncertainty assessment 
There are major differences in the uncertainty for PFC emissions depending on the choice of Tier 1, Tier 2, or 
Tier 3 methods.  The differences in uncertainty resulting from choice of method for carbon dioxide emissions are 
much smaller than for PFC emissions. There is no basis for country or regional differences in emissions resulting 
from aluminium production other than the differences that result from the specific type of production 
technologies and work practices in use in the country or region. These differences are reflected in the calculation 
methodologies described above.  
4.4.3.1 
EMISSION FACTOR UNCERTAINTIES 
The uncertainty in the emission factors for calculating carbon dioxide emissions from carbon anode or paste 
consumption should be less than ±5 percent for both the Tier 2 and Tier 3 methods, and less than ±10 percent for 
the Tier 1 method. The reactions leading to carbon dioxide emissions are well understood and the emissions are 
very directly connected to the tonnes of aluminium produced through the fundamental electrochemical equations 
for alumina reduction at a carbon anode and oxidation from thermal processes. Both of these fundamental 
processes producing carbon dioxide are included in process parameters routinely monitored at the production 
facilities, the net carbon consumed and/or paste consumption. The main source of uncertainty is in the net carbon 
consumed for Prebake technologies and paste consumption for Søderberg cells. These factors are both carefully 
monitored and are important factors in the economic performance of a facility. Improvements in accuracy of 
carbon dioxide emissions inventories can be achieved by moving from Tier 1 to Tier 2 methods because there is 
a range of performance of reduction facilities in the consumption of carbon anode materials. Less significant 
improvements in accuracy can be expected in choosing the Tier 3 method over the Tier 2 method. This is 
because the major factors in the calculation are the net anode carbon consumed or paste consumption and the 
production of aluminium. The uncertainty of both these components of the calculation equation is low, 2 to 5 
percent, and these uncertainties dominate the overall calculation of carbon dioxide emissions in the Tier 2 and 
Tier 3 methods.  Facility specific data are used in both Tier 2 and Tier 3 calculations for these parameters. The 
Tier 3 method refines the calculation to use actual composition of the carbon anode materials. While there can be 
considerable variability in the minor components of the anode materials this variability does not contribute 
significantly to the overall calculation of carbon dioxide emissions.  
In considering changes in uncertainty in PFC emissions inventory when moving from Tier 1 to Tier 2 and Tier 3 
methods, there are major reductions in uncertainty when choosing the Tier 2 or Tier 3 methods over the Tier 1 
method. The high level of uncertainty in the Tier 1 method results directly from the large variability in anode 
effect performance among operators using similar production technology. The Tier 1 method is based on using a 
single default coefficient for all operators by technology type. Since there can be variations in anode effect 
performance (frequency and duration) by factors of 10 among operators using the same technology (IAI, 2005c), 
use of the Tier 1 method can result in uncertainties of the same magnitude. There is less impact on uncertainty 
levels in choosing the Tier 3 method over the Tier 2 method; however, the level of uncertainty reduction depends 
on the cell technology type. The uncertainty for industry average coefficients ranges from +/-6 percent for 
CWPB, the most widely measured and used technology, to +/-44 percent for HSS. Both Tier 2 and Tier 3 
methods are based on direct PFC measurements that establish a relationship between anode effect performance 
and PFC specific emissions. The Tier 2 method uses an industry average equation coefficient while the Tier 3 
method uses a facility specific coefficient based on direct PFC measurements made at the facility. As more 
facility measurements are made, especially in those facilities operating with Søderberg technologies, the 
uncertainty in the average coefficients should be reduced. The lowest uncertainty for PFC emissions calculations 
is from the use of the Tier 3 method. However, to achieve this lower uncertainty in Tier 3 PFC calculations it is 
important to use good practices in making facility specific PFC measurements. These measurement good 
practices have been established and documented in a protocol available globally (USEPA/IAI, 2003). When 
properly established these Tier 3 coefficients will have an uncertainty of +/-15 percent at the time the 
coefficients are measured.  
Chapter 4: Metal Industry Emissions 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.57 
4.4.3.2 
ACTIVITY DATA UNCERTAINTIES 
There is very little uncertainty in the data for the annual production of aluminium, less than 1 percent. The 
uncertainty in recording carbon consumption as baked anode consumption or coke and paste consumption is 
estimated to be only slightly higher than for aluminium production, less than 2 percent. The other component of 
calculated facility specific emissions using Tier 2 or Tier 3 methods is the anode effect activity data, i.e., either 
anode effect minutes per cell day or anode effect overvoltage. These parameters are typically logged by the 
process control system as part of the operations of nearly all aluminium production facilities and the 
uncertainties in these data are low. 
4.4.4 
Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC), 
Reporting and Documentation 
4.4.4.1 
QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL (QA/QC) 
It is good practice at all primary aluminium production facilities to maintain records of all of the necessary 
activity data to support calculations of emissions factors as suggested in these guidelines. These records will 
include production of aluminium, anode effect performance and consumption of carbon materials used in either 
Prebake or Søderberg cells. In addition, the International Aluminium Institute maintains global summaries of 
aggregated activity data for these same parameters and regional data are available from regional aluminium 
associations. It is good practice to aggregate emissions estimates from each smelter to estimate total national 
emissions. However, if smelter-level production data are unavailable, smelter capacity data may be used along 
with aggregate national production to estimate smelter production.  
It is good practice to verify facility CO2 emission factors per tonne aluminium by comparison with the expected 
range of variation that would be predicted from the variation noted in Tables 4.10 and 4.11 for carbon dioxide 
specific emissions. Also, the underlying equation coefficients used for calculating PFC emission factors per 
tonne aluminium should be compared with those noted in Table 4.15. It is suggested that any inventory value 
outside the 95 percent confidence range of the data population variance be confirmed with the data source. 
Use of standard measurement methods improves the consistency of the resulting data and knowledge of the 
statistical properties of the data. For primary aluminium, the EPA/IAI Protocol for Measurement of 
Tetrafluoromethane (CF4) and Hexafluoroethane (C2F6) Emissions from Primary Aluminum Production is the 
internationally recognized standard (U.S. EPA and IAI, 2003). Inventory compilers should encourage plants to 
use this method for developing Tier 3 PFC equation coefficients. Significant differences between calculated 
coefficients based on PFC measurements and the industry average Tier 2 coefficients for similar reduction 
technology should elicit further review and checks on calculations. Large differences should be explained and 
documented. An international data set of anode effect performance, which can be used to identify outlier data, is 
available from the International Aluminium Institute. In addition, an up-to-date database of PFC measurements 
is also maintained by IAI and should be consulted when assessing the appropriateness of reported data. 
Inter-annual changes in emissions of carbon dioxide per tonne aluminium should not exceed +/-10 percent based 
on the consistency of the underlying processes that produce carbon dioxide. In contrast, inter-annual changes in 
emissions of PFCs per tonne of aluminium may change by values of up to +/- 100 percent. Increases in PFC 
specific emissions can result from process instability. Increases in anode effect frequency and duration can be the 
result of factors such as unanticipated power interruptions, changes in sources of alumina feed materials, cell 
operational problems, and increases in potline amperage to increase aluminium production. Decreases in PFC 
specific emissions can result from decreases in anode effect frequency and duration due to changes in the 
computer algorithms used in cell process control, upgrades in cell technology such as the installation of point 
feeders, improved work practices and better control of raw materials. 
4.4.4.2 
REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION 
It is good practice to document and archive all information required to produce the national emissions inventory 
estimates as outlined in Volume 1, Chapter 6, Quality Assurance and Quality Control, Internal Documentation 
and Archiving. Some examples of specific documentation and reporting relevant to this source category are 
provided below. 
It is not practical to include all documentation in the national inventory report.  However, the inventory should 
include summaries of methods used and references to source data such that the reported emissions estimates are 
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
4.58 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
transparent and steps in their calculation may be retraced. To improve transparency, it is good practice to report 
emissions for PFCs from aluminium production separately from other source categories.  Additionally, it is good 
practice that CF4 and C2F6 emissions are reported separately on a mass basis. 
The supporting information necessary to ensure transparency in reported emissions estimates is shown in Table 
4.17, Good practice Reporting Information for PFC Emissions from Aluminium Production by Tier, below. 
Much of the production and process data are considered proprietary by operators, especially where there is only 
one smelter in a country. It is good practice to exercise appropriate techniques, including aggregation of data, to 
ensure protection of confidential data.

MAGNESIUM PRODUCTION 
4.5.1 
Introduction 
In the magnesium industry, there are a number of potential emission sources and gases. The amount and type of 
emission from the magnesium industry will reflect the raw material used for primary magnesium metal 
production and/or the type of cover gas mixture used in the casting and recycling foundries to prevent oxidation 
of molten magnesium. It is good practice to consider, in a disaggregated way if possible, all segments of the 
magnesium industry and their related emissions. A list of possible greenhouse gas emissions, which may be 
associated with primary, and secondary magnesium metal production and casting operations, is provided in 
Table 4.18. 
Primary magnesium refers to metallic magnesium derived from mineral sources. Primary magnesium can be 
produced either by electrolysis or a thermal reduction process. The raw materials used for primary magnesium 
production are dolomite, magnesite, carnalite, serpentine, brines or seawater. Processing of carbonate raw 
materials (magnesite and dolomite) will release CO2 during manufacturing. The CO2 is released during 
calcination of carbonate-based ores (dolomite/magnesite) - a ‘pre-treatment’ step to the main electrolytic/thermal 
reduction processes. This process is similar to the generation of CO2 in the mineral industry (see Chapter 2). 
Secondary magnesium production includes the recovery and recycling of metallic magnesium from a variety of 
magnesium containing scrap materials e.g., post consumer parts, machine cuttings, casting scraps, furnace 
residues, etc.  Magnesium casting processes may involve metal from both primary production and secondary 
magnesium production. Magnesium casting processes involve handling of molten pure magnesium and/or 
molten high magnesium content alloys. Molten magnesium (also understood to mean high magnesium content 
alloys) maybe cast by a variety of methods including gravity casting, sand casting, die casting and others.   
All molten magnesium spontaneously burns in the presence of atmospheric oxygen. Production and casting of all 
magnesium metal requires a protection system to prevent burning. Among the various protection systems 
commonly used are those that use gaseous components with high GWP values, such as SF6, which typically 
escape to the atmosphere. Metallic magnesium cast from the various processes and sources all require protection 
methods and will therefore have similar potentials for GHG emissions.

carrier gas (commonly air and/or CO2) and SF6 or SO2
12) or, in some cases, flux. High-magnesium content alloys 
are also commonly protected using SF6 containing cover gases. Due to recent technological developments and a 
push towards the replacement of SF6, the magnesium industry has introduced alternative cover gases. It is 
foreseen that the two most common alternatives to SF6 in the next decade will be the fluorinated hydrocarbon 
HFC-134a and the fluorinated ketone FK 5-1-12 (C3F7C(O)C2F5), traded under the name Novec™61213, and that 
the individual magnesium producer’s/processor’s choice of cover gas will be strongly influenced by 
national/regional circumstances (Tranell et al., 2004).  
CO2 EMISSIONS FROM PRIMARY PRODUCTION  
As indicated in Table 4.18, the magnesium-containing ores which release CO2 during calcination are dolomite 
(Mg•Ca(CO3)2) and magnesite (MgCO3). For each kilogram of magnesium produced, theoretically 3.62 kg14 
(dolomite) or 1.81 kg (magnesite) respectively of CO2, is emitted during calcination. The actual CO2 emissions 
per kilogram magnesium produced will be higher than the theoretical emission due to losses of magnesium in the 
process chain.  
MAGNESIUM CASTING PROCESSES (PRIMARY & SECONDARY) 
In magnesium casting processes, the size and type of GHG emission will depend on the chosen cover gas system 
used to protect liquid magnesium.  In addition to emissions of the active protection compound (SF6, HFC-134a 
or FK 5-1-12) in the cover gas itself – there may be emissions of various fluorinated decomposition products 
(e.g., PFCs) and potentially also the carrier gas (depending on choice of air and/or CO2 or N2).   
SF6 
It has been a common assumption that SF6 in magnesium cover gas is inert and that hence, essentially all SF6 
used in the magnesium industry will be emitted.  However, recent independent studies (Bartos et al., 2003 and 
Tranell et al., 2004) demonstrate that SF6 does, to a certain degree, destruct in contact with liquid/gaseous 
magnesium at common magnesium holding/processing temperatures. The fraction of SF6 destroyed in the 
furnace, as well as the type/amount of secondary gas products generated from the reaction with magnesium, will 
depend on pertaining operating conditions such as SF6 concentration in cover gas, total cover gas flow-rate, size 
of reactive magnesium surface area, type of carrier gas used, furnace charging practises, etc. 
HFC-134a, FK 5-1-12 and decomposition products (e.g., PFCs) 
Both HFC-134a and FK 5-1-12 are less thermodynamically stable (and thus have much lower GWP) than SF6. It 
is hence expected that these gases will decompose/react extensively in the contact with liquid/gaseous 
magnesium, leading to the production of various fluorinated gases (e.g., PFCs). Tranell et al., 2004 found that as 
a general rule of thumb, when SF6 is replaced by HFC-134a, less than half the amount of active fluorinated 
compound  on a molar basis is needed to protect a given magnesium surface (under otherwise identical 
conditions). When SF6 replaces FK 5-1-12, less than a quarter of the quantity of active compound is needed. It 
was reported that, as is the case for SF6, the amount of active compound in the in-going cover gas destroyed in 
the furnace depends on conditions such as compound concentration in in-going cover gas, total cover gas flow-
rate, size of reactive magnesium surface area, type of carrier gas used, charging practises etc. It should be noted 
that emissions of PFCs as decomposition products would be more significant in terms of CO2 equivalent than FK 
5-1-12 emissions, given their relative radiative effects15. 
Carrier gases 
Many cover gas systems use CO2 as a carrier gas -alone or in combination with dry air- to dilute the active 
fluorinated compound and reduce the oxygen partial pressure in the furnace. It is a quantitatively reasonable 
assumption that all CO2 used in the cover gas is emitted as CO2.  The amount of carbon dioxide cover gas used is 
much lower than the usual active agents in the cover gas system and can generally be disregarded. 
                                                           
12 Consistent with the scope of these Guidelines outlined in Volume 1, this chapter does not provide methods for estimating 
emissions of SO2. 
13 FK 5-1-12 (C3F7C(O)C2F5), traded as Novec™612, is a fluorinated ketone produced by 3M (Milbrath, 2002). 
14 This represents a case where the ore has a stoichiometric Mg/Ca ratio of 1.  
15 The GWP value of FK 5-1-12 is not identified in the IPCC Third Assessment Report (IPCC, 2001), but it is estimated to be 
similar to that of CO2 according to the producer of this gas.

Methodological issues 
4.5.2.1 
CHOICE OF METHOD  
CO2 EMISSIONS FROM PRIMARY PRODUCTION 
The choice of a good practice method for inventory preparation of carbon dioxide emissions from the primary 
magnesium (raw material) production segment will depend on national circumstances. The decision tree (see 
Figure 4.13, Decision Tree for Estimation of CO2 Emissions from Primary Magnesium Production) describes 
good practice in adapting the methods to these country-specific circumstances. 
 
Tier 1 
The Tier 1 method relies on national primary production data and knowledge of raw materials used in the 
country. National production data may not be publicly available as there are a limited number of countries 
producing magnesium and only a few individual producers - often only one in a country - often resulting in the 
designation of national production data as confidential. In the absence of national primary magnesium 
production

industry 
associations, 
such 
as 
the 
International 
Magnesium 
Association 
(http://www.intlmag.org/), may be able to provide regional statistics. Failing other data, it may be possible to 
estimate primary magnesium production from annual national magnesium metal sales. This method has 
increased uncertainty, since it does not account for magnesium used in national product manufacturing. 
CO2 emissions are calculated using Equation 4.28.

The Tier 2 method for determining CO2 emissions from primary magnesium involves collecting company/plant- 
specific empirical emission factors, in addition to company specific production data. The company specific 
emission factors may differ substantially from the default emission factors depending on process materials 
handling. This collection should take place if the emissions are a key category.

MAGNESIUM CASTING PROCESSES (PRIMARY & SECONDARY)  
SF6 
The choice of a good practice method for inventory preparation of SF6 emissions from magnesium casting 
process segment will also depend on national circumstances. The decision tree (Figure 4.14, Decision Tree for 
Estimation of SF6 Emissions from Magnesium Processing) describes good practice in adapting the methods to 
these country-specific circumstances. 
Tier 1 – default emission factors 
The Tier 1 method is based on the total amount of magnesium casting or handling in the country (Equation 4.30). 
The underlying assumption for the Tier 1 approach is that all SF6 consumption in the magnesium industry 
segment is emitted as SF6. As described in Section 4.5.1, this assumption will potentially overestimate the GHG 
emissions, but the overestimate will lie within the overall uncertainty range given in Section 4.5.3. The basic 
Tier 1 method uses a single value as a basis for the default emission calculation when SF6 is used for oxidation 
protection, despite the fact that SF6 consumption vary substantially between different casting operations and 
operators (sometimes orders of magnitude). The Tier 1 method should be used only when the inventory compiler 
has no knowledge of type of magnesium handling- or casting operation (recycling, billet casting or die-casting 
etc.)

Tier 2 – company-specific SF6 consumption 
As for the Tier 1 method, the Tier 2 method also assumes that all SF6 consumed is subsequentlyemitted. Instead 
of the amount of magnesium casting, however, the Tier 2 method uses data on national (or sub-national) 
consumption of SF6 in the magnesium industry as reported by the industry or available through other sources 
such as national statistics (Equation 4.31). 
The most accurate application of the method is normally collection of direct data on SF6 consumption from all 
individual users of the gas in the magnesium industry. If no direct data are available, an alternative but a less 
accurate method is to estimate the share of annual national SF6 consumption attributable to the magnesium 
industry. This requires collecting annual data on national SF6 sales and assumes that all SF6 gas sold to the 
magnesium industry is emitted within the year.

Tier 3 – direct measurement approach 
If actual measured emission data are available from individual magnesium processing facilities, these data can be 
aggregated and used directly to account for national emissions. In such reporting, it is good practice to include 
destruction of SF6 and formation of secondary gas products.

HFC-134a, FK 5-1-12 and decomposition products (e.g., PFCs) 
As described in Section 4.5.1, the industrial use of fluorinated compounds other than SF6 for magnesium 
oxidation protection commenced in 2003-2004. As such, the industrial experience in using these compounds for 
magnesium protection purposes is yet very limited. Even individual plants will have little historic data, if any, on 
actual emissions of these other fluorinated compounds from their operations. While there is a general sense in 
industry that the volume use of these alternate gases will be less than SF6, there are no data available at this time 
on which to base emission factors. Hence, it is not possible at this time to develop an emission factor-based 
approach (Tier 1 or 2) for reporting emissions.  
However, if the GHG emission from the use of magnesium cover gases is a national key category, it is good 
practice to collect direct measurements or meaningful indirect measurements of GHG emissions (fugitive 
emissions of HFC134-a and FK 5-1-12 as well as emissions of PFCs as decomposition products) from 
magnesium foundries using HFC-134a or FK 5-1-12 as cover gases. This is consistent with the Tier 3 approach. 
 
Carrier gases 
The contribution of carbon dioxide carrier gas used in protective cover gas systems is normally a small fraction 
of the global warming potential.  In general, these emissions may be disregarded.  
 
4.5.2.2 
CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTORS 
CO2 EMISSIONS FROM PRIMARY PRODUCTION 
Tier 1 – default emission factors 
 
As previously mentioned, the Tier 1 method calculates emissions from default emission factors applied to a 
country’s total primary magnesium production. The default emission factors (Table 4.19) take into account the 
type of material used and basic stoichiometric ratios which have been adjusted by empirical data for generic 
manufacturing process losses.  The resulting emission of CO2 per tonne magnesium produced is considerably 
higher than the theoretical volume described in the Section 4.5.1.

5.13 
Magnesite 
2.83 
 
Tier 2 – country/company-specific emission factors 
The Tier 2 method for estimating CO2 emissions from primary magnesium involves collecting company/plant-
specific empirical emission factors. The company specific emission factors may differ substantially from the 
default emission factors depending on process materials handling. This collection should take place if the 
emissions are a key category. 
Tier 3 – direct measurement approach 
If actual measured CO2 emissions data are available from individual primary magnesium facilities, these data 
can be aggregated and used directly to account for national emissions.   
 
MAGNESIUM CASTING PROCESSES (PRIMARY & SECONDARY) 
SF6 
Tier 1 – default emission factors 
The underlying assumption for the Tier 1 approach is that all SF6 consumption in this industry segment is 
emitted, though. as described in Section 4.5.1, this assumption will potentially overestimate the GHG emissions.  
The Tier 1 method also assumes no knowledge of type of magnesium handling- or casting operation (recycling, 
billet casting or die-casting, etc.) Under recommended conditions for die-casting, the consumption rates are 
about 1 kg SF6 per tonne magnesium produced or smelted (Gjestland and Magers, 1996). Although the SF6 
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
4.66 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
consumption vary substantially between different casting operations and operators (sometimes orders of 
magnitude), the basic Tier 1 method uses this value as a basis for the default emission calculation when SF6 is 
used for oxidation protection. If the national magnesium manufacturing processes are well documented, a more 
accurate application of the Tier 1 method is to disaggregate production data and emission factors according to 
the various manufacturing processes. These emission factors should relate SF6 emissions to magnesium 
production at the same disaggregated level as the available activity data (e.g., national, sub-national). National 
emission factors based on plant measurements are preferable to international default factors because they reflect 
conditions specific to the country. Such information may be accessible through industry associations, surveys or 
studies.

Tier 2 – company-specific SF6 consumption 
As for the Tier 1 method, the underlying principle for the Tier 2 method is that all SF6 consumed is emitted. In 
the Tier 2 method it is, however, assumed the national (or sub-national ) consumption of SF6 in the magnesium 
industry is reported by the industry or available through other sources such as national statistics. 
The most accurate application of the method is normally collection of direct data on SF6 consumption from all 
individual users of the gas in the magnesium industry. If no direct data are available, an alternative but a less 
accurate method is to estimate the share of annual national SF6 consumption attributable to the magnesium 
industry. This requires collecting annual data on national SF6 sales and assumes that all SF6 gas sold to the 
magnesium industry is emitted within the year. 
Tier 3 – direct measurement approach 
If actual measured emission data are available from individual magnesium processing facilities, these data can be 
aggregated and used directly to account for national emissions.  In such reporting, it is good practice to include 
destruction of SF6 and formation of secondary gas products. 
 
HFC-134a, FK 5-1-12 and decomposition products (e.g., PFCs) 
As described above, there are little historic data upon which to base emission factors. However, if the GHG 
emission from the use of magnesium cover gases is a national key category, it is good practice, for inventory 
preparation purposes, to collect direct measurements and or reliable indirect measures of GHG emissions 
(fugitive emissions of HFC134-a and FK 5-1-12 as well as emissions of PFCs as decomposition products) from 
magnesium foundries using HFC-134a or FK 5-1-12 as cover gases. This may be considered a Tier 3 approach. 
Over time, it may be possible to use Tier 3 measurements as a means of developing emission factors that could 
be used for Tier 2. 
 
Carrier gases 
As mentioned previously in this chapter, the contribution of carbon dioxide carrier gas used in protective cover 
gas systems is normally a small fraction of the global warming potential.  In general it may be disregarded.  
 
4.5.2.3 
CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
CO2 EMISSIONS FROM PRIMARY PRODUCTION 
For the Tier 1 method, inventory compilers need to obtain national primary production data and knowledge of 
raw material type used in the country. As discussed in Section 4.5.2.1, these data may not be publicly available 
and therefore be difficult to obtain, in particular for small-scale (particularly thermal reduction type) production 
units in developing countries. Approximate national magnesium production data may be available through 
industry associations such as the International Magnesium Association. For the Tier 2 method, inventory 
Chapter 4: Metal Industry Emissions 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.67 
compilers need to collect primary magnesium production data and data on carbonate raw materials from each 
company/plant. With the Tier 3 method, activity data consists of direct measured and reported emissions.   
 
MAGNESIUM CASTING PROCESSES (PRIMARY & SECONDARY) 
SF6 
For the Tier 1 method, it is good practice to disaggregate production data into segments using SF6, if possible, 
(e.g., primary production, recycling, billet casting, die casting, gravity casting, etc.) and apply available segment-
specific emission factors. Where disaggregated data are not available, more aggregated production data, possibly 
combining output from several different processes, may be used to provide an estimate. In the absence of SF6 
consumption data or magnesium production data, the alternative is to collect annual national data on SF6 sales to 
the magnesium industry. SF6 producers may be able to provide these data directly, or they may be available from 
national statistics. It is good practice to consider data on consumption by other industries that use SF6 (e.g., 
electrical equipment) when estimating the share consumed by the magnesium industry. 
With the Tier 3 and 2 methods, the activity data are reported SF6 (and secondary gas product) emissions or SF6 
consumption totals from each plant. For the Tier 1 method, national- or individual plant- magnesium production 
data are necessary. Where there is some direct reporting of SF6 use in a segment, it is good practice to assess the 
share of production represented by the plants that directly report. For the other plants, it is good practice to use 
production-based estimates of emissions. 
HFC-134a, FK 5-1-12 and decomposition products (e.g., PFCs) 
With the Tier 3 method, activity data consists of direct measured and reported emissions. No Tier 1 or 2 method 
guidance is provided and hence, no activity data are necessary.   
Carrier gases 
It is good practice in inventory reporting that the chosen activity data for carrier gases are analogous to those of 
the active compound used. I.e., if CO2 is used as carrier gas for SF6, the activity data of CO2 should reflect that of 
SF6. If CO2 is used as carrier for HFC-134a or FK 5-1-12, CO2 activity data should reflect HFC-134a or FK 5-1-
12 activity data. 
 
4.5.2.4 
COMPLETENESS 
Incomplete direct reporting or incomplete activity data should not be a significant issue for primary production 
in developed countries. Typically, there are a small number of well-known primary magnesium producers in 
developed countries, and these producers are likely to keep good records. In developing countries, completeness 
issues generally arise in the casting segments, where facilities are more widely distributed, and have a wide 
range of capacities and technologies. Some plants may supply to niche markets not captured by national data sets. 
The inventory compiler should confirm the absence of estimates for these smaller industry segments rather than 
simply assuming they do not occur. It is also good practice to undertake periodic surveys of the industry and 
establish close links with international and local industry associations to check completeness of estimates.  
Because alternate (non-SF6) cover gas systems decompose to various fluorinated by-products, there may be some 
unaccounted global warming potential not described. This is not expected to be significant. 
Since an increasing fraction of the world’s primary production, as well as processing of magnesium, takes place 
in many small production units in countries with developing economies, completeness is expected to become a 
significant issue. 
Inventory compilers should be cautious of the potential for double counting emissions from calcination of 
magnesium carbonate raw materials during primary magnesium production and those emissions associated with 
calcining limestone, dolomite, and other carboneous minerals (see Chapter 2, Other Process Uses of Carbonates, 
in this volume.) All emissions associated with the calcination of carbonates for primary magnesium production 
should be reported as GHG emissions from magnesium production.  
4.5.2.5 
DEVELOPING A CONSISTENT TIME SERIES 
In terms of overall magnesium production statistics, these data will typically be available for the history of a 
plant. However, in some cases, historical production data may not be available due to lack of initial records or 
changes in the structure of the industry in the intervening period. In this case, production data from international 
sources may be used.  
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
4.68 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
There may be issues with establishing a consistent time series for CO2 emissions from primary magnesium 
production since these emissions may not have been reported prior to year 2006 (guidelines for reporting did not 
exist in the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines (IPCC, 1997)). For most primary magnesium production facilities it 
may, however, be assumed that the CO2 emission level is relatively constant over time on a per tonne 
magnesium produced basis. 
In terms of SF6 emissions, it is good practice for the Tier 1 approach to multiply historic activity data by sub-
national/national or default emission factor presently in use to establish consistent time series. It should be noted 
that plant specific emission factors would typically decrease over time due to environmental awareness, 
economic factors, and improved technologies and practices.  
Since the magnesium industry did not use HFC-134a and FK 5-1-12 cover gases to a significant extent in any 
country prior to 2003, historic emissions will likely be zero. Given the level of complexity in reporting emissions 
related to the use of these gases, developing consistent time series will be a challenge to inventory compilers. 
It is good practice to assess the appropriate historical emission factors following the guidance in Volume 1, 
Chapter 5. To ensure consistency over time, it is good practice to recalculate emissions estimates using 
previously used and new methods to ensure that any trends in emissions are real and not caused by changes in 
the estimation methodologies. Good practice is to document assumptions in all cases and archive them at the 
inventory compiler. 
4.5.3 
Uncertainty assessment 
CO2 EMISSIONS FROM PRIMARY PRODUCTION 
At the plant level, there should normally be well-documented raw material type/analysis and use, as well as 
tonnage magnesium produced.  Directly-reported activity data, which are required for Tier 2 and 3 methods for 
all gases, are typically accurate to within less than 5 percent. At the national inventory level, the accuracy of 
magnesium production activity and emission data is comparable to that of other national production statistics 
(i.e., ±5 percent). Additional uncertainty is introduced through estimating the share of production not reporting 
directly. 
MAGNESIUM CASTING PROCESSES (PRIMARY & SECONDARY) 
SF6 
In the Tier 1 approach, aggregating production from different secondary segments and using the default emission 
factor introduces uncertainty. For example, national data from casting operations may not be segregated into die-
casting and gravity casting segments despite their potentially different SF6 emission rates. Thus, this approach 
gives by default a very rough approximation of real emissions. Given that different handling and casting 
operations may use concentrations of SF6 in cover gas that differ by orders of magnitude, uncertainties using the 
Tier 1 method may also range over orders of magnitude.  For the Tier 1 and 2 methods, there is also a level of 
uncertainty associated with the assumption that 100 percent of the SF6 used is emitted. In a typical casting 
operation, the uncertainty in this assumption should be within 30 percent (Bartos et al., 2003). 
For the Tier 2 method, there is a very low uncertainty associated with SF6 use on a plant level, since SF6 use is 
measured easily and accurately from purchase data. (An uncertainty estimate of less than 5 percent is usually 
appropriate for directly reported data.) 
For the Tier 3 method, uncertainties arise mainly from monitoring equipment calibration/accuracy. Typical gas 
analysis methods such as Fourier Transformed Infra Red Spectroscopy (FTIR) generally operate with an 
estimated accuracy of ± 10 percent.   In addition to FTIR and similar analytical techniques, there will be further 
uncertainty caused by problems related to representative sampling and calibration that could raise the overall 
uncertainty of FTIR to ± 20 percent. 
HFC-134a, FK 5-1-12 and decomposition products (e.g., PFCs) 
As with the Tier 3 method for SF6, main uncertainties are associated with monitoring equipment 
calibration/accuracy in processes using HFC-134a or FK 5-1-12 cover gases. Uncertainties are approximated to 
± 10 percent. 
Carrier gases 
The largest uncertainty is associated with the Tier 1 approach of considering CO2 emissions from cover gases 
negligible. This is particularly true if a facility uses a very CO2 rich carrier gas blend. Other tiers have the same 
uncertainties as related for SF6.

Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC), 
Reporting and Documentation 
4.5.4.1 
QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL (QA/QC) 
It is good practice to conduct quality control checks as outlined in Volume 1, Chapter 6, and an expert review of 
the emissions estimates. Additional quality control checks, as outlined in Volume 1, Chapter 6, and quality 
assurance procedures may also be applicable, particularly for higher tier methods. Inventory compilers are 
encouraged to use higher tier QA/QC for key categories as identified in Volume 1, Chapter 4. 
The following section outlines additional procedures specific to magnesium production: 
Comparison of emissions estimates using different approaches 
If emissions were calculated using data from individual plants, inventory compilers should compare the estimate 
to emissions calculated using national magnesium production data or (in the case of  SF6) national consumption 
data attributed to magnesium use. The results of the comparison should be recorded and any discrepancies 
should be investigated.  
Review of plant-level data  
The following plant-specific information should be archived to facilitate independent review: 
• 
Magnesium production volumes and process types; 
• 
Cover gas with global warming potential (SF6, HFC-134a, FK 5-1-12, CO2, etc.) consumption/composition 
or magnesium production (where factors are used); 
• 
Plant-level QA/QC results (including documentation of sampling, measurement method, and measurement 
results for plant level data); 
• 
Results of QA/QC conducted by any integrating body (e.g., industry association such as the International 
Magnesium Association.); 
• 
Calculations and estimation method; and 
• 
Where applicable, a list of assumptions in allocating national SF6 usage, HFC-134a, FK 5-1-12 or other 
cover gases of interest or production to plant level. 
Inventory compilers should determine if national or international measurement standards were used for reporting 
of global warming cover gas (SF6, HFC-134a, FK 5-1-12, etc.) consumption or magnesium production data at the 
individual plants. If standard methods and QA/QC procedures were not followed, then use of these activity data 
should be reconsidered.  
Review of national activity data  
QA/QC activities associated with the reference to magnesium production data should be evaluated and 
referenced. Inventory compilers should check if the trade association or agency that compiled the national 
production data used acceptable QA/QC procedures. If the QA/QC procedures are deemed acceptable, inventory 
compilers should reference the QC activity as part of the QA/QC documentation. 
Assessment of emission factors 
Where company/country-specific factors are used, inventory compilers should review the level of QC associated 
with the underlying data. It is good practice that the inventory compiler cross-check national level default factors 
against plant-level factors to determine if these are representative. 
Peer review 
Inventory compilers should involve magnesium industry experts in a thorough review of the inventory estimate, 
giving consideration to potential confidentiality issues. Historical production data may be less sensitive to public 
disclosure than current data and could be utilised for an external peer review of plant level emissions.  
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
4.70 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Verification of SF6 emissions data 
Inventory compilers should sum the amount of SF6 used by different industrial sectors (e.g., magnesium, 
electrical equipment) and compare this value with the total usage of SF6 in the country, obtained from 
import/export and production data. This provides an upper bound on the potential emissions.16 
4.5.4.2 
REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION 
It is good practice to document and archive all information required to produce the national emissions inventory 
estimates as outlined in Volume 1, Section 6.11. It is not practical to include all documentation in the national 
inventory report. However, the inventory should include summaries of methods used and references to source 
data such that the reported emissions estimates are transparent and steps in their calculation may be retraced. 
To improve transparency, it is good practice to report emissions estimates from the magnesium source category 
separately by industry segments such as primary production, secondary production and casting.   
The following additional information can provide a reasonable degree of transparency in reporting: 
Direct reporting 
• 
Number of magnesium plants reporting; 
• 
The types of processes and manufacture employed; 
• 
Magnesium and magnesium products produced; 
• 
SF6 emissions associated with the magnesium segment; 
• 
Use of other protective cover gases with global warming potential; and  
• 
Emission factor data (and reference) for each protective cover gas with global warming potential. 
National cover gas sales-based estimate of potential emissions 
• 
National SF6 consumption (and reference); 
• 
National use of HFC-134a assigned to the magnesium sector; 
• 
National use of FK 5-1-12 assigned to the magnesium sector; 
• 
Assumptions for allocating SF6 , HFC-134a, FK 5-1-12, used to magnesium; 
• 
Estimate of percentage of national SF6, HFC-134a, FK 5-1-12, used in magnesium (and reference); and 
• 
Any other assumptions made. 
In most countries, the magnesium industry will be represented by a small number of plants. In this industry, the 
activity level data and cover gas emissions (that are directly related to activity levels) may be considered 
confidential business information and public reporting may be subject to confidentiality considerations.  
                                                           
16 It may not always be the case that such aggregated consumption data will provide an upper limit on emissions. It is 
possible, depending on the national characteristics of the SF6 consuming industry that in some years actual emissions of 
SF6 may be greater than consumption of SF6. For instance, consumption in die casting of magnesium may be very low, 
there may not be much semiconductor manufacturing, but a considerable bank of SF6 in electrical equipment may have 
evolved through the years. In this case, leakage from bank combined with emissions resulting from decommissioning of 
equipment may lead to actual emissions that exceed consumption of SF6 (potential emissions). See also Section 8.2 on SF6 
emissions from electrical equipment.

LEAD PRODUCTION 
4.6.1 
Introduction 
PRIMARY PRODUCTION PROCESSES 
There are two primary processes for the production of rough lead bullion from lead concentrates.  The first type 
is sintering/smelting, which consists of sequential sintering and smelting steps and constitutes roughly 78 percent 
of the primary lead production. The second type is direct smelting, which eliminates the sintering step and 
constitutes the remaining 22 percent of primary lead production in the developed world. (Sjardin, 2003) 
In the sintering/smelting process, the initial sintering blends lead concentrates with recycled sinter, lime rock and 
silica, oxygen, and high-lead-content sludge to remove sulphur and volatile metals via combustion (Metallurgical 
Industry, 1995). The process, which produces a sinter roast that consists of lead oxide and other metallic oxides, 
results in the emission of sulphur dioxide (SO2) and energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) from the natural gas 
used to ignite the lead oxides (DOE, 2002). The sinter roast is then put in a blast furnace along with ores 
containing other metals, air, smelter by-products, and metallurgical coke (Metallurgical Industry, 1995). The 
coke burns as it reacts with air and produces carbon monoxide (CO) that actually performs the reduction of the 
lead oxide by chemical reaction (DOE, 2002). The smelting process occurs in either a traditional blast furnace or 
an Imperial Smelting Furnace, and it is the reduction of the lead oxide during this process that produces CO2 
emissions (Sjardin, 2003). The sintering process produces molten lead bullion (Metallurgical Industry, 1995). 
In the direct smelting process, the sintering step is skipped, and the lead concentrates and other materials are 
entered directly into a furnace in which they are melted and oxidized (Sjardin, 2003). A variety of furnaces are 
used for the direct smelting process, with the Isasmelt-Ausmelt, Queneau-Schumann-Lurgi, and Kaldo furnaces 
used for bath smelting and the Kivcet furnace used for flash smelting.  A number of reducing agents, which 
include coal, metallurgical coke, and natural gas, are used in the process in different quantities for each furnace, 
which results in different levels of CO2 emissions for each type of furnace (Sjardin, 2003; LDA, 2002).  The 
direct smelting process offers significant environmental and potential cost saving benefits through the avoidance 
of the sintering process and is therefore expected to constitute a growing portion of primary refinery lead 
production in the future (LDA, 2002). 
SECONDARY PRODUCTION PROCESS 
The secondary production of refined lead amounts to the processing of recycled lead to prepare it for reuse.  The 
vast majority of this recycled lead comes from scrapped lead acid batteries. The lead acid batteries are either 
crushed using a hammer mill and entered into the smelting process with or without desulphurization or they are 
smelted whole (Sjardin, 2003). Traditional blast furnaces, Imperial Smelting Furnaces, electric arc furnaces, 
electric resistance furnaces, reverbatory furnaces, Isasmelt furnaces, Queneau-Schumann-Lurgi furnaces, and 
Kivcet furnaces can all be used for the smelting of these batteries and other recycled scrap lead (Sjardin, 2003).  
As with the furnaces used for primary lead bullion production, these furnaces generate different levels of CO2 
emissions from their use of differing types and quantities of reductants. The primary reductants are coal, natural 
gas, and metallurgical coke, although the electric resistance furnace uses petroleum coke (Sjardin, 2003). 
4.6.2 
Methodological Issues 
4.6.2.1 
CHOICE OF METHOD 
The IPCC Guidelines outline three methods for calculating CO2 emissions from lead production. The choice of a 
good practice method depends on national circumstances as shown in the decision tree in Figure 4.15. The Tier 1 
method calculates emissions from general emission factors applied to a country’s total lead production and is the 
least accurate. This method is appropriate only when lead production is not a key category. The Tier 2 method 
uses country specific process material data for both primary and secondary production processes multiplied by 
the appropriate carbon contents of process materials. The Tier 3 method requires facility-specific measured 
activity or emissions data.

TIER 1 METHOD 
The simplest estimation method is to multiply default emission factors by lead production. When the only data 
available are national lead production statistics, it is good practice to use default emission factors.  Equation 4.32 
calculates total carbon dioxide emissions from lead production by summing emissions by source and accounting 
for emissions from secondary feedstock pre-treatment.  If it is not possible to differentiate the type of production 
process, the default emission factor should be used. The default emission factor assumes a that 80 percent of 
production (including both primary and secondary) is smelted using an Imperial Smelting Furnaces or blast 
furnaces, while the remaining 20 percent is smelted using the direct smelting method in the Kivcet, Ausmelt, and 
Queneau-Schumann-Lurgi furnaces. This assumption is consistent with global lead production data (Sjardin, 
2003).

EFS = emission factor for secondary materials, tonne CO2/tonne lead product 
The CO2 emission factors used in Equation 4.32 are shown in Table 4.21. 
TIER 2 METHOD 
The Tier 2 method recognizes that there are substantial differences in carbon dioxide emissions for lead 
production depending on the production methodology and the source of the raw materials, either from secondary 
sources such as recycled batteries, or, from primary production from ores.  Secondary lead sources may be pre-
treated to remove impurities resulting in carbon dioxide emissions. Emissions can be calculated using country 
specific emission factors based on the use of reducing agents, furnace types and other process materials of 
interest. Factors can be developed based on carbon contents applicable to those materials. Table 4.22 provides 
carbon contents that can be used to derive country-specific factors.  These data may be available from 
governmental agencies responsible for manufacturing or energy statistics, business or industry trade associations, 
or individual lead companies. Tier 2 is more accurate than Tier 1 because it takes into account the materials and 
the variety of furnace types used in the lead sector that contribute to CO2 emissions for a particular country 
rather than assuming  worldwide industry-wide practices.  
TIER 3 METHOD 
If actual directly measured CO2 emissions data are available from lead facilities, these data can be aggregated 
and used directly to account for national emissions using the Tier 3 method.  Total national emissions will equal 
the sum of emissions reported from each facility.  If facility emissions are not available, emissions should be 
calculated from plant-specific data for individual reducing agents and other process materials. To achieve a 
higher level of accuracy than Tier 2, it is good practice to develop emissions estimates at the plant-level because 
plants can differ substantially in their technology, specifically furnace technology. These data may be available 
from governmental agencies responsible for manufacturing or energy statistics, or from business or industry 
trade associations, but is preferably aggregated from data furnished by individual lead facilities.   
4.6.2.2 
CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTORS 
TIER 1 METHOD 
When the only data available are national lead production statistics, it is good practice to use default emission 
factor of 0.52 tonne of CO2/ tonne of lead (Sjardin 2003). This default should only be used when no information 
is available on the relative amounts of lead produced from primary and from secondary materials.  If information 
is available, emissions should be calculated using the appropriate factors in Table 4.21. (Sjardin, 2003).  The 
uncertainty in the default factor is high and varies depending on the mix of production methods and the 
percentage of secondary processing. In addition, the factor assumes that 80 percent of the world’s lead 
production (including both primary and secondary) is smelted using an Imperial Smelting Furnaces, while the 
remaining 20 percent is smelted using the direct smelting method in the Kivcet, Ausmelt, and Queneau-
Schumann-Lurgi furnaces (Sjardin, 2003). 
 
TIER 2 METHOD 
This method offers the opportunity to adjust emission factors to reflect variations from the presumed norms 
based on plant-specific data for the carbon content of these materials and based on furnace type. The default 
carbon contents in Table 4.22 should be used if an inventory compiler does not have information on conditions

* The amount of CO2 emissions from charcoal can be calculated by using this carbon content value, but it should be reported as zero in 
national greenhouse gas inventories. (See Section 1.2 of Volume 1.) 
 
TIER 3 METHOD 
The Tier 3 method is based on aggregated emission estimates or the application of the Tier 2 at a plant-specific 
level. The inventory compiler should ensure that each facility has documented the emission factors and carbon 
contents used, and that these emission factors are indicative of the processes and materials used at the facility.  
The Tier 3 method requires carbon contents and production/consumption mass rates for all of the process 
materials and off-site transfers such as those listed in Table 4.22. While Table 4.22 provides default carbon 
contents, it is good practice under Tier 3 to adjust these values to reflect variations at the plant level from default 
values represented in the table.  The default factors listed in Table 4.22 are only appropriate for the Tier 3 
method if plant-specific information indicates that they correspond to actual conditions.  It is anticipated that for 
the Tier 3 method the plant-specific data would include both carbon content data and production/consumption 
mass rate data, and that therefore the default values in Table 4.22 would not be applied to the Tier 3 method in 
most instances. 
4.6.2.3 
CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
TIER 1 METHOD 
The Tier 1 method requires only the amount of lead produced in the country and if available, the amount 
produced by furnace type. These data may be available from governmental agencies responsible for 
manufacturing statistics, business or industry trade associations, or individual lead companies. These tonnages 
can then be multiplied by the corresponding emission factor in Table 4.21 to estimate CO2 emissions from the 
sector or the default factor if furnace type is unavailable. 
Chapter 4: Metal Industry Emissions 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.75 
TIER 2 METHOD  
The Tier 2 method requires only the total amounts of reducing agents and other process materials used for lead 
production in the country. These data may be available from governmental agencies responsible for 
manufacturing or energy statistics, business or industry trade associations, or individual lead companies.  These 
amounts can then be multiplied by the appropriate carbon contents in Table 4.22 and summed to determine total 
CO2 emission from the sector. However, activity data collected at the plant-level is preferred (Tier 3). If this is 
not a key category and data for total industry-wide reducing agents and process materials are not available, 
emissions can be estimated using the Tier 1 approach. 
TIER 3 METHOD 
The Tier 3 method requires collection, compilation, and aggregation of facility-specific measured emissions or 
activity data.   If emissions data are not available, the Tier 3 method requires activity data to be collected at the 
plant level and aggregated for the sector. The amounts of reducing agents and the type of furnace used are more 
accurately determined in this manner. These data may be available from governmental agencies responsible for 
manufacturing or energy statistics, or from business or industry trade associations, but are preferably aggregated 
from data furnished by individual lead facilities. This approach also allows for additional accuracy by allowing 
individual companies to provide more accurate plant-specific data and/or to use more relevant emission factors 
to reflect carbon contents and furnace types that may differ from the default factors used in the Tier 2 method. 
4.6.2.4 
COMPLETENESS 
In estimating emissions from this source category, there is a risk of double counting or omission in either the 
IPPU or the Energy Sector. As a general guide, all process emissions from lead production should be reported in 
the IPPU Sector.  
4.6.2.5 
DEVELOPING A CONSISTENT TIME SERIES 
Emissions from lead production should be calculated using the same method for every year in the time series. 
Where data are unavailable to support a Tier 3 method for all years in the time series, these gaps should be 
recalculated according to the guidance provided in Volume 1, Chapter 5, Time Series Consistency and 
Recalculation. 
4.6.3 
Uncertainty assessment  
Uncertainty estimates for lead production result predominantly from uncertainties associated with activity data, 
and from uncertainty related to the emission factor. Table 4.23 provides an overview of the uncertainties for 
emission factors and activity data. 
4.6.3.1 
EMISSION FACTOR UNCERTAINTIES  
The default emission factors used in Tier 1 may have an uncertainty of ± 50 percent. Tier 2 carbon contents are 
expected to have an uncertainty of ± 15 percent. Tier 3 unit specific emission factors would be expected to be 
within 5 percent if plant-specific carbon content data are available. 
4.6.3.2 
ACTIVITY DATA UNCERTAINTIES  
National production statistics should be available and likely have an uncertainty of ± 10 percent. For Tier 2, the 
total amount of reducing agents and process materials used for lead production would likely be within 10 percent. 
Tier 3 requires plant-specific information on production data (about 5 percent uncertainty). In addition, actual 
emissions data for tier 3 would be expected to have ± 5 percent uncertainty.

Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC), 
Reporting and Documentation 
4.6.4.1 
QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL (QA/QC) 
It is good practice to conduct quality control checks as outlined in Volume 1, Chapter 6, and an expert review of 
the emissions estimates. Additional quality control checks as outlined in Volume 1, Chapter 6, and quality 
assurance procedures may also be applicable, particularly if higher tier methods are used to determine emissions 
from this source category. Inventories agencies are encouraged to use higher tier QA/QC for key categories as 
identified in Volume 1, Chapter 4. 
In addition to the guidance in Volume 1, Chapter 6, specific procedures of relevance to this source category are 
outlined below. 
Review of emission factors 
Inventory compilers should compare aggregated national emission factors with the IPCC default factors in order 
to determine if the national factor is reasonable relative to the IPCC default. Differences between national factors 
and default factors should be explained and documented, particularly if they are representative of different 
circumstances.  
Site-specific activity data check 
For site-specific data, inventory compilers should review inconsistencies between sites to establish whether they 
reflect errors, different measurement techniques, or result from real differences in emissions, operational 
conditions or technology. For lead production, inventory compilers should compare plant data with other plants. 
Inventory compilers should ensure that emission factors and activity data are developed in accordance with 
internationally recognised and proven measurement methods. If the measurement practices fail this criterion, 
then the use of these emissions or activity data should be carefully evaluated, uncertainty estimates reconsidered 
and qualifications documented. If there is a high standard of measurement and QA/QC is in place at most sites, 
then the uncertainty of the emissions estimates may be revised downwards. 
Expert review 
Inventory compilers should include key industrial trade organisations associated with lead production in a review 
process. This process should begin early in the inventory development process to provide input to the 
development and review of methods and data acquisition 
Third party reviews are also useful for this source category, particularly related to initial data collection, 
measurement work, transcription, calculation and documentation. 
Activity data check 
For all tier levels, inventory compilers should check with Volume 2: Energy to ensure that emissions from 
reducing agents and process materials (coal, coke, natural gas, etc.) are not double-counted or omitted. 
Chapter 4: Metal Industry Emissions 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.77 
Inventory compilers should examine any inconsistency between data from different plants to establish whether 
these reflect errors, different measurement techniques or result from real differences in emissions, operational 
conditions or technology. This is particularly relevant to the plant-specific estimates of amounts of reducing 
agents or reported carbon content of process materials. 
Inventory compilers should compare aggregated plant-level estimates to industry totals for process materials 
consumption where such trade data are available. 
4.6.4.2 
REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION 
It is good practice to document and archive all information required to produce the national emissions inventory 
estimates as outlined in Volume 1, Section 6.11. It is not practical to include all documentation in the national 
inventory report.  However, the inventory should include summaries of methods used and references to source 
data such that the reported emissions estimates are transparent and steps in their calculation may be retraced.  
TIER 1 METHOD 
Besides reporting of estimated emissions, it is good practice to report the total lead production by process and 
corresponding emission factors used. 
TIER 2 METHOD 
Good practice is to document the estimated or calculated emissions, all activity data, and corresponding carbon 
contents any assumptions or data justifying alternative values. There should be a clear explanation of the linkage 
with the Volume 2, Energy, to demonstrate that double counting or missing emissions have not occurred.  
TIER 3 METHOD 
Good practice is to document the calculated emissions and source of all data, taking into account the need to 
protect the confidentiality of data for specific facilities if the data are business-sensitive or of a proprietary nature. 
In addition, inventory compilers should for all tiers, document all information needed to reproduce the estimate, 
as well as the QA/QC procedures.

ZINC PRODUCTION 
4.7.1 
Introduction 
PRIMARY PRODUCTION PROCESSES 
There are three different types of primary zinc production.  The first method is a metallurgical process called 
electro-thermic distillation. The process is used to combine roasted concentrate and secondary zinc products into 
a sinter feed that is burned to remove zinc, halides, cadmium, and other impurities. The resulting zinc oxide-rich 
sinter is combined with metallurgical coke in an electric retort furnace that reduces the zinc oxides and produces 
vaporized zinc which is captured in a vacuum condenser. The reduction results in the release of non-energy 
carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The electro-thermic distillation process is used in the United State and in Japan. 
(Sjardin, 2003; European IPPC Bureau, 2001) 
The second method of zinc production is a pyrometallurgical process involving the use of an Imperial Smelting 
Furnace, which allows for the simultaneous treatment of lead and zinc concentrates. The process results in the 
simultaneous production of lead and zinc and the release of non-energy CO2 emissions. The metallurgical 
coke/coal reductant used in this process must be allocated to lead and zinc production in order to perform an 
emission calculation without double counting. A mass based allocation results in a factor of 0.74 tonnes 
coke/tonne zinc. (Sjardin, 2003; European IPPC Bureau, 2001) 
The third zinc production method is the electrolytic process, which is a hydrometallurgical technique. In this 
process, zinc sulphide is calcined, resulting in the production of zinc oxide. The zinc oxide is then leached in 
sulphuric acid and purified to remove iron impurities, copper, and cadmium. The zinc is then drawn out of the 
solution using electrolysis. The electrolytic process does not result in non-energy CO2 emissions. (Sjardin 2003; 
European IPPC Bureau 2001) 
SECONDARY PRODUCTION PROCESSES 
There are more than 40 hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical technologies that can be used to recover zinc 
metal from various materials. The preferred method for a given situation depends on the zinc source 
(contamination level and zinc concentration) and the desired end use for the recovered zinc. The process 
frequently consists of zinc concentration (through physical and/or chemical separation), sintering, smelting, and 
refining. In some cases, high grade zinc is removed from this process after physical concentration and consumed 
by other industries, including iron and steel manufacture, brass manufacture, and zinc die-casting, without going 
through the rest of the process steps. (Sjardin, 2003) 
The sintering, smelting, and refining steps are identical to the steps used in the primary zinc production process, 
so certain smelting processes are considered emissive, while the sintering and refining steps are considered non 
emissive from the perspective of non-energy CO2 emissions. When the concentration step involves the use of a 
carbon-containing reductant and high temperatures to volatilize or fume zinc from the source materials, the 
process could result in non-energy CO2 emissions. The Waelz Kiln and slag reduction or fuming processes are 
two such concentration methods. The Waelz Kiln process, which is used to concentrate zinc in flue dusts, 
sludges, slags, and other zinc-containing materials, involves the use of metallurgical coke as a reductant. 
However, the reduced zinc is re-oxided during the processes and the metallurgical coke also serves as a heat 
source during the process. The slag reduction or fuming process, which is used strictly to concentrate zinc in 
molten slags from copper and zinc smelting, involves the use of coal or another carbon source as a reductant. 
(Sjardin, 2003; European IPPC Bureau, 2001) 
4.7.2 
Methodological issues 
4.7.2.1 
CHOICE OF METHOD  
The IPCC Guidelines outline several approaches for calculating CO2 emissions from zinc production. The choice 
of a good practice method depends on national circumstances as shown in the decision tree in Figure 4.16. The 
Tier 3 method may be used if facility-specific measured emissions data are available. Tier 2 method uses country 
specific emissions factors for both primary and secondary production processes. The Tier 1 method is very 
simple and it may lead to errors due to its reliance on assumptions rather than actual data. The Tier 1 method 
calculates emissions from general emission factors applied to a country’s total zinc production and is the least 
rigorous method. This method should only be used when zinc production is not a key category.

TIER 1 METHOD 
The simplest estimation method is to multiply default emission factors by zinc product type (Equation 4.33).  
When the only data available are national zinc production statistics, it is good practice to use default emission 
factors. If material specific data are not available to calculate emissions using the Tier 2 methodology, but the 
process type is known, inventory compilers can calculate emissions using Equation 4.34.

TIER 2 METHOD 
Emission can be calculated using  country specific emission factor based on aggregated plant statistics on the use 
of reducing agents, furnace types and other process materials of interest is developed based on default emission 
factors applicable to those materials. These data may be available from governmental agencies responsible for 
manufacturing or energy statistics, business or industry trade associations, or individual zinc companies. Tier 2 is 
more accurate than Tier 1 because it takes into account the materials and the variety of furnace types used in the 
zinc sector that contribute to CO2 emissions for a particular country rather than assuming industry-wide practices.  
 
TIER 3 METHOD 
If actual measured CO2 emissions data are available from zinc facilities, these data can be aggregated and used 
directly to account for national emissions using the Tier 3 method.

CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTORS 
TIER 1 METHOD 
The emission factor for the pyrometallurgaical process (Imperial Smelting Furnace) is an aggregate, weighted 
emission factor encompassing both primary and secondary zinc production in Europe (Sjardin, 2003), No data 
was available to determine an emission factor for the electro-thermic process. An emission factor based on the 
amount of coke consumed per tonne of EAF dust consumed in a Waelz Kiln furnace was developed based on the 
materials balance provided by Viklund-White (2000), wherein Viklund-White finds that 400 kg of coke are 
consumed for every metric tonne of EAF dust consumed.

default factor is based on weighting of known emission

TIER 2 METHOD 
The Tier 2 method requires the calculation of a country specific emission factor based on the total amount of 
reducing agents and other carbon containing process materials used for zinc production in the country. These 
country specific emission factors should be based on aggregated plant statistics on the use of reducing agents, 
furnace types and other process materials of interest. An emission factor was developed based on the amount of 
metallurgical coke consumed per tonne of EAF dust consumed: 0.4 tonnes coke/ tonne EAF dust consumed 
(Viklund-White, 2000). If activity data are available, an emission factor of 1.23 tonnes of EAF dust per tonne of 
zinc could be used to calculate emissions. When producing zinc from EAF dust in a Waelz Kiln furnace, the 
complexities of the process suggest that emission factors are more accurate if they are based on the amount of 
EAF dust consumed rather than the total zinc produced . This is because the amount of reduction materials 
(metallurgical coke) consumed is directly dependent upon the amount, and zinc content, of the EAF dust 
consumed. Weighing equipment is used in the Waelz Kiln process to control the amount of metallurgical coke 
entered into the kiln (Sjardin 2003; European IPPC Bureau 2001). 
4.7.2.3 
CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
TIER 1 METHOD 
The Tier 1 method requires only the amount of zinc produced in the country, and if available, the process type. 
These data may be available from governmental agencies responsible for manufacturing statistics, business or 
industry trade associations, or individual zinc companies. These tonnages can then be multiplied by the default 
emission factors to estimate CO2 emissions. 
TIER 2 METHOD 
The Tier 2 method requires the calculation of a country specific emission factor based on the total amount of 
reducing agents and other carbon containing process materials used for zinc production in the country. These 
data may be available from governmental agencies responsible for manufacturing or energy statistics, business or 
industry trade associations, or individual zinc companies. These country specific emission factors can then be 
multiplied by the production amount to determine total CO2 emission from the sector. If this is not a key 
category and data for total industry-wide reducing agents and process materials are not available, emissions can 
be estimated using the Tier 1. 
Chapter 4: Metal Industry Emissions 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.81 
TIER 3 METHOD 
The Tier 3 method requires collection, compilation, and aggregation of facility-specific measured emissions data, 
if any. However, activity data collected at the plant-level can also be used, with separate emission factors for 
each plant multiplied by plant specific production. If this is not a key category and data for total industry-wide 
reducing agents and process materials are not available, emissions can be estimated using the Tier 1.

4.7.2.4 
COMPLETENESS 
In estimating emissions from this source category, there is a risk of double-counting or omission in either the 
Industrial Processes or the Energy Sector. It is important to note that the Tier 1 emission factor assumes that the 
CO2 emissions from the combustion of various fuels used for production of heat in the calcining, sintering, 
leaching, purification smelting, and refining processes are captured within the CO2 from fossil fuel combustion 
emission category.  In using the tier 2 or 3 methodologies, double-counting can be avoided.  The largest source 
of potential double-counting, emissions from coke production, are calculated in Section 4.2 and reported in the 
Energy Sector.   
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
4.82 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.7.2.5 
DEVELOPING A CONSISTENT TIME SERIES 
Emissions from zinc production should be calculated using the same method for every year in the time series. 
Where data are unavailable to support a Tier 3 method for all years in the time series, these gaps should be 
recalculated according to the guidance provided in Volume 1, General Guidance and Reporting. 
4.7.3 
Uncertainty assessment  
Uncertainty estimates for zinc production result predominantly from uncertainties associated with activity data, 
and from uncertainty related to the emission factors. Table 4.25 provides an overview of the uncertainties for 
emission factors and activity data. 
4.7.3.1 
EMISSION FACTOR UNCERTAINTIES  
The default emission factors used in Tier 1 may have an uncertainty of ± 50 percent. Tier 2 country specific 
emission factors are expected to have an uncertainty of ± 15 percent. Tier 3 unit specific emission factors would 
be expected to be within 5 percent if plant-specific carbon content data are available. 
4.7.3.2 
ACTIVITY DATA UNCERTAINTIES  
National production statistics should be available and likely have an uncertainty of ± 10 percent. For Tier 2, the 
total amount of reducing agents and process materials used for lead production would likely be within 10 percent. 
Tier 3 actual emissions data would be expected to have ± 5 percent uncertainty.

4.7.4.1 
QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL (QA/QC) 
It is good practice to conduct quality control checks as outlined in Volume 1, Chapter 6, and an expert review of 
the emissions estimates. In addition to the guidance in Volume 1, specific procedures of relevance to this source 
category are outlined below. 
Review of emission factors 
Inventory compilers should compare aggregated national emission factors with the IPCC default factor in order 
to determine if the national factor is reasonable relative to the IPCC default. Significant differences between 
national factors and the default factor should be explained and documented, particularly if they are representative 
of different circumstances. 
 
Chapter 4: Metal Industry Emissions 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.83 
Site-specific activity data check 
For site-specific data, inventory compilers should review inconsistencies between sites to establish whether they 
reflect errors, different measurement techniques, or result from real differences in emissions, operational 
conditions or technology. For zinc production, inventory compilers should compare plant data with other plants. 
Inventory compilers should ensure that emission factors and activity data are developed in accordance with 
internationally recognised and proven measurement methods. If the measurement practices fail this criterion, 
then the use of these emissions or activity data should be carefully evaluated, uncertainty estimates reconsidered 
and qualifications documented. If there is a high standard of measurement and QA/QC is in place at most sites, 
then the uncertainty of the emissions estimates may be revised downwards. 
Expert review 
Inventory compilers should include key industrial trade organisations associated with zinc production in a review 
process. This process should begin early in the inventory development process to provide input to the 
development and review of methods and data acquisition. 
Third party reviews are also useful for this source category, particularly related to initial data collection, 
measurement work, transcription, calculation and documentation. 
Activity data check 
For all tier levels, inventory compilers should check to ensure that emissions from reducing agents and process 
materials (coal, coke, natural gas, etc.) are not double-counted as energy related emissions or omitted. 
Inventory compilers should examine any inconsistency between data from different plants to establish whether 
these reflect errors, different measurement techniques or result from real differences in emissions, operational 
conditions or technology. This is particularly relevant to the plant-specific estimates of amounts of reducing 
agents or reported carbon content of process materials. 
Inventory compilers should compare aggregated plant-level estimates to industry totals for process materials 
consumption where such trade data are available. 
4.7.4.2 
REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION 
It is good practice to document and archive all information required to produce the national emissions inventory 
estimates as outlined in Volume 1, Section 6.11. It is not practical to include all documentation in the national 
inventory report. However, the inventory should include summaries of methods used and references to source 
data such that the reported emissions estimates are transparent and steps in their calculation may be retraced.  
TIER 1 METHOD 
Besides reporting of estimated emissions, it is good practice to report the total zinc production by process and 
corresponding emission factors used. 
TIER 2 METHOD 
Good practice is to document the estimated or calculated emissions, all activity data, and corresponding 
emission factors and any assumptions or data justifying alternative emission factors.  
TIER 3 METHOD 
Good practice is to document the calculated emissions and source of all data, taking into account the need to 
protect the confidentiality of data for specific facilities if the data are business-sensitive or of a proprietary nature.  
In addition, inventory compilers should for all tiers, document all information needed to reproduce the estimate, 
as well as the QA/QC procedures
