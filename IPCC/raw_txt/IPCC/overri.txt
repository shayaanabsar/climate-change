This document is one volume of the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for
National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.
The series consists of three books:
•
THE GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY REPORTING INSTRUCTIONS
•
THE GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY WORKBOOK
•
THE GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY REFERENCE MANUAL
These books together provide the range of information needed to plan,
carry out and report results of a national inventory using the IPCC system.
The Reporting Instructions (Volume 1) provides step-by-step directions for
assembling, documenting and transmitting completed national inventory data
consistently, regardless of the method used to produce the estimates.
These instructions are intended for all users of  the IPCC Guidelines and
provide the primary means of ensuring that all reports are consistent and
comparable.
The Workbook (Volume 2) contains suggestions about planning and getting
started on a national inventory for participants who do not have a national
inventory available already and are not experienced in producing such
inventories. It also contains step-by-step instructions for calculating
emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O),
halocarbons (HFCs, PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), ozone and aerosol
precursors, from six major emission source categories. It is intended to
help experts in as many countries as possible to start developing inventories
and become active participants in the inventories programme.
The Reference Manual (Volume 3) provides a compendium of information on
methods for estimation of emissions for a broader range of greenhouse
gases and a complete list of source types for each. It summarises a range of
possible methods for many source types. It also provides summaries of the
scientific basis for the inventory methods recommended and gives extensive
references to the technical literature. It is intended to help participants at
all levels of experience to understand the processes which cause
greenhouse gas emissions and removals to occur and the estimation
methods used in compiling inventories.

The flow diagram above illustrates how the different types of users
(working at different levels of inventory detail) can use the various volumes
of the Guidelines. You should recognise that reality is more complex than
this simple explanatory chart. Many countries may have some parts of the
inventory complete at a high level of detail but may only be getting started
on other parts. It is quite likely that some users will need to do several
iterations of the thinking process reflected in the diagram with regard to
different parts of their inventory.
The stages outlined in the flow diagram are:
Question 1
Do you have a detailed national inventory?
Answer: Yes
If your country already has a complete national inventory, you should
transform the data it contains into a form suitable for use by IPCC. This
means transforming it into a standard format. In order to do this, use
Volume 1 of the IPCC Guidelines, Reporting Instructions. This gives details of
the way in which data should be reported and documented.
Answer: No
You should start to plan your inventory and assemble the data you will
need to complete the Worksheets in this book. Refer to the Getting Started
section of the Workbook.
Question 2
Do you want to use the IPCC computer software?
Answer: Yes
If you want to use the IPCC software, you will still follow the instructions
included in the Workbook to assemble the data you have collected into an
inventory (see margin box). You will use the software instead of the printed
worksheets to enter data.
Answer: No
If you do not use the IPCC software, use the Workbook and the
Worksheets it contains to assemble the data you have collected into an
inventory.
Finally...
Inventory data should be returned to IPCC in the form recommended in
the Reporting Instructions. It is important that, where you have used a
methodology other than the IPCC Default Methodology, it is properly
documented. This will ensure that national inventories can be aggregated
and compared in a systematic way in order to produce a coherent regional
and global picture.

R e v i se d  1 9 9 6  I P C C  G u i d e l i n e s fo r  N a t i o n a l  G r e e n h o u se  G a s I n v e n t o r i e s:   R e p o r t i n g  I n st r u c t i o n s
O V E R V I E W.5
In general terms “anthropogenic” refers to greenhouse gas emissions
and removals that are a direct result of human activities or are the
result of natural processes that have been affected by human activities.
Users may include any human-induced emissions and removals in their
inventory as long as they can be clearly documented and quantified.
• 
National inventories should include greenhouse gas emissions and
removals taking place within national (including administered)
territories and offshore areas over which the country has jurisdiction.
There are, however, four qualifications of this principle in the
Guidelines:
(a) Emissions based upon fuel sold to ships or aircraft engaged in
international transport should not be included in national totals
but reported separately.
(b) Emissions from road vehicles should be attributed to the country
where the fuel is loaded into the vehicle.  The error in national
emissions introduced in the case of road transport is expected to
be small.
(c) Emissions from the combustion or decay of wood and wood
products are assumed to take place in the country in which the
wood was harvested and within a year of harvesting.  This is
because it has been determined that the most workable approach
to estimating CO2 emissions and removals from forests is to
account for changes in stocks of standing biomass in forests and
other locations.  The simple assumption is that wood removed
from stocks releases CO2 emissions in the year and in the country
where the wood was removed.  While the IPCC method allows
for accounting of exports and carbon stored in products, it does
not yet provide a methodology, which is a priority for future work.
(d) In line with the principle of national emissions, the IPCC
methodology accounts for the bulk of greenhouse gas emissions
related to fuel combustion in the country in which those emissions
are released.  The IPCC methodology for carbon stored in non-
fuel products manufactured from fuels as raw materials takes into
account emissions released from those products during their use
or destruction.  Emissions are attributed to the country where the
conversion to non-energy products takes place, even when the
products are traded internationally.  This is believed to be a
relatively small net error, but it is also a priority for future work.
Data Quality and Time Frame:
• 
The data available to estimate anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions
resulting from fuel combustion are generally of a better quality than the
data available to estimate greenhouse gas emissions and removals in the
areas of agriculture and land use change/forestry.  Accordingly, while
the IPCC Guidelines request an emission figure for a single year in most
source/sink sectors, three-year averages (with the base year in the
middle) are preferred in the areas of agriculture and land use
change/forestry.  In addition, the IPCC Guidelines recognise that
greenhouse gas emissions and removals in the area of land use
change/forestry can occur over an extended period of time once the
activity has been completed.  For example, when estimating emissions

R e v i se d  1 9 9 6  I P C C  G u i d e l i n e s fo r  N a t i o n a l  G r e e n h o u se  G a s I n v e n t o r i e s:   R e p o r t i n g  I n st r u c t i o n s
from the abandonment of forests and grasslands, users are requested
to estimate emissions related to two time periods of previous activity:
(a) 0 - 20 years ago, and (b) 20 - 100 years ago.
Default Method:
• 
The IPCC Guidelines contain “default” methodologies for the estimation
of greenhouse gas emissions and removals.  Users are encouraged to
go beyond these minimum default methods where possible, and report
the results.
The IPCC Guidelines also include a number of “default” assumptions and
data for use in the estimation of greenhouse gas emissions and
removals.  This default information is included primarily to provide
users with a starting point from which they can develop their own
national assumptions and data.  Indeed, national assumptions and data
are always preferred because the default assumptions and data may not
always be appropriate for specific national contexts.
In general, therefore, default assumptions and data should be used only
when national assumptions and data are not available.  Section 2 of the
Introduction to the IPCC Greenhouse Gas Inventory Workbook
provides information on the quality of the default data available in
different greenhouse gas source/sink categories.  When it is indicated
that the data available are of low quality, users should recognise that
the default data do not provide a basis for the development of a
definitive inventory of that source/sink category.
• 
Many of the categories of greenhouse gas emissions and removals can
be estimated only with large ranges of uncertainty. Quite naturally,
some national experts have developed methods which are designed to
produce ranges of estimates rather than point estimates for highly
uncertain categories. The IPCC Guidelines, however, require that users
provide a single point estimate for each gas and emissions/removal
category. This is simply to make the task of compilation, comparison
and evaluation of national reports manageable. Users are encouraged
to provide uncertainty ranges or other statements of confidence or
quality along with the point estimates. The procedures for reporting
uncertainty information are discussed in the Greenhouse Gas Inventory
Reporting Instructions.
Double Counting of Emissions:
The methods proposed for the estimation of emissions sometimes simplify
the inventory construction in order to use data which are more readily
available than those needed for a detailed and more precise approach.  In
certain cases this may cause or increase the risk of double counting
emissions.  There are two areas where this may occur in the Guidelines.
1)
All countries preparing CO2 inventories using the IPCC Guidelines
are asked to estimate the emissions from fuel combustion using the IPCC
Reference Approach either as the primary means of preparing the
inventory or as a verification stage following the preparation of an inventory
using national methods. The Reference Approach is a simple procedure
which demands relatively little data and lends itself to wide-spread
application as a "common denominator".
OVERVIEW
R e v i se d  1 9 9 6  I P C C  G u i d e l i n e s fo r  N a t i o n a l  G r e e n h o u se  G a s I n v e n t o r i e s:   R e p o r t i n g  I n st r u c t i o n s
O V E R V I E W.7
The Reference Approach provides an upper bound to CO2 emissions
inferred from the country's supply of fossil fuels by identifying the carbon
content, subtracting from it the carbon stored in non-energy products and
products made from fuels used as raw material, adjusting for carbon which
remains unburnt and multiplying by 44/12. It is an upper bound1 because
some of the carbon will be emitted in forms other than CO2, in part
because fuel combustion is not always complete but also because fuels may
leak or evaporate.  Consequently the CO2 emissions figure obtained from
the Reference Approach will include carbon emitted as CH4, CO or
NMVOC.  At the same time the Guidelines encourage countries to estimate
separate inventories for these gases and when this is done these gases are
reported twice, in their emitted form and as CO2.  It is in this sense that
they are "double counted".
Use of the Reference Approach carries with it two consequences which
should be carefully noted.
Because the Reference Approach uses fossil fuel supply statistics as a basis
for determining the carbon supply
•
Not all carbon based emissions from fossil fuel are reported twice.
The Reference Approach CO2 estimate will not include emissions
from combustion or release of fossil fuels for which the corresponding
quantities (activity data) are not included in national production or
import figures.  Notable examples of activities which lead to emissions
not included are the venting of natural gases from coal mining and
handling and oil and gas production.  Emissions from the flaring of
natural gases are also excluded.  As a result, when emissions from
these activities are included in the relevant inventories using the
fugitive emissions methodologies recommended in the Guidelines no
"double counting" occurs.
•
CO2 emissions from biomass used as fuels are excluded from the total
CO2 emissions figure.  The restriction of the Reference Approach to
fossil fuels results from the sustainable nature of biofuels.  The CO2
emissions are, however, reported for information purposes.  Note
that non-CO2 emissions from biofuels are included in their respective
inventories.
2)
Double counting may also occur when calculated emissions from
the manufacture of products from fuels used as raw materials or from the
use of fuels for their physical properties (e.g. lubricants) include emissions
produced from the later destruction of these products.   The double count
will be with any separate reporting within the Waste module of the
Guidelines of emissions from destruction.
3) 
When a national CO2 inventory is constructed from emissions
estimated for each source category using emission factors derived from
measurements on combustion plant, care should be taken to include the
CO2 equivalent of other fossil carbon based emissions from the source
                                                  
     1 In practice, because of inaccuracies in the supply statistics and/or
emission factors, CO2 estimates from the Reference Approach may be less
than those obtained by summing all CO2 emissions from the combustion of
fuel.

category.  In this manner, the resulting total CO2 emissions can be
compared with the result of the CO2 Reference Approach as part of the
inventory verification stage.  If, however, CO2 emission factors, derived
from the carbon content of the fuel, are used then no addition of the CO2
equivalent of carbon gases is required.
