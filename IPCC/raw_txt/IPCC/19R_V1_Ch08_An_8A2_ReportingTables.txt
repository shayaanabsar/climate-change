(1) Although peat is not strictly speaking a fossil fuel, the CO2 emissions from combustion of peat are included in the national emissions as for fossil fuels. See Chapter 1 of Energy Volume, page 1.15.   
(2)  Information items that are not themselves emissions, therefore not included in the national total. The carbon should be converted to carbon dioxide. It is subtracted in the CO2 emission columns (net 
emissions). Only CO2 captured for permanent storage in geological reservoirs should be subtracted. 
(3) Enter the amount of CO2 captured as a negative number since this amount is subtracted from total CO2 produced.

(3)  Fugitive emissions during above ground operations such as processing and CO2 recycling during enhanced oil and gas 
recovery operations should be reported as fugitive emissions from oil and natural gas and reported under the appropriate

(1)  This column includes other halogenated compounds for which CO2 equivalent conversation factors are available, including, 
for example, hydrofluoroethers (HFEs) and perfluoropolyethers (PFPEs) used for temperature control, device testing, 
cleaning substrate surfaces and other parts, and soldering during electronics manufacturing and other processes. 
Halogenated gases for which a CO2 equivalent conversion factor is not available should not be included in this column. Such 
gases should be reported in the column “Other halogenated gases without CO2 equivalent conversion factors”. 
(2)  This column includes other halogenated compounds for which CO2 equivalent conversation factors are NOT available, 
including, for example, perfluoroamines and perfluoroalkyl morpholines used for temperature control, device testing, cleaning 
substrate surfaces and other parts, and soldering during electronics manufacturing and other processes. When this column 
is used, gases should be listed separately (in IPPU background tables and Table 2.11) and the name of the gas should be 
given in the documentation box. Insert additional columns if necessary.  
(3)  Insert additional rows if needed.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(4)  Small amounts of CO2 used as a diluent for SF6 and emitted during magnesium processing is considered insignificant and is 
usually counted elsewhere. The "Other halogenated gases" here mainly comprise fluorinated ketones.  
(5)  Emissions from feedstock uses in petrochemical industry should be addressed in 2B8 (Petrochemical and Carbon Black 
Production). Emissions from some product uses should be allocated to each industry source category (e.g., CO2 from carbon 
anodes and electrodes  2C (Metal Industry)). 
(6)  Only NMVOC emissions and no direct GHGs are relevant to this category. 
(7)  Emissions from asphalt production, and paving of roads and roofing are included here.  
(8)  "Other halogenated compounds" may include, for example, c-C4F8O and the HFEs, PFPEs, perfluoroamines and 
perfluoroalkyl morpholines discussed in notes (1) and (2). Specific compounds to be reported here include (but are not limited 
to) those listed with and without GWPs in Table 6.5 of Volume 3 and throughout Chapter 6 of Volume 3. 
 
 
 
* Cells to report emissions of NOx, CO, NMVOC and SO2 have not been shaded although the physical potential for emissions is 
lacking for some categories.

(1)  Typically, global warming potential (100 year time horizon) identified in the IPCC Assessment Report can be used. The source 
of the factors must be specified in the bracket.  
 
 
(2)  Emissions may occur but no methodological guidance is provided in these Guidelines.   
(3)  Insert additional columns if necessary. For example, additional halogenated compounds with GWPs include HFC-1234yf, 
HFC-1234ze(E), and HCFC-1233zd(E). The other halogenated gases for which the CO2 equivalent conversion factor is not 
available should not be included in this table. Such gases should be reported in Table 2.11 IPPU background table: 
Greenhouse gases without CO2 equivalent conversion factors.   
 
 
(4)  Insert additional rows if necessary. 
Note: Where information is confidential the entries should provide aggregate figures but there should be a note indicating this in

(1)  The columns ‘Primary NEU fuel’ and ‘Other NEU fuel’ should be completed with the actual fuel types used.  
(2)  These are the same emissions reported in the sectoral background table (also the same emissions notation keys NE, NO, 
IE, where applicable). If (partly) reported elsewhere, a reference to that other source category should be added in the next 
column. 
(3)  Report here only the CO2 emissions from combustion of waste gases produced from industrial processes but used for fuel 
combustion in other economic sectors and reported in the Energy sector.(e.g. from combustion of blast furnace gas or 
chemical off-gases transferred offsite to another source category). 
(4)  For example, powdered anthracite coal may be used in Glass Production (2A3). 
(5)  In cases where the production of off-gases (i.e. byproduct gases) is fully accounted for in the energy statistics, the combustion 
of these gases may be used to calculate and report CO2 emissions from the feedstock losses. Part of these off-gases may 
be combusted off-site (i.e. in a sector other than the petrochemical industry) and should thus be accounted for separately as 
fuel combustion in the Energy Sector.  
(6)  Part of the blast furnace gas produced from coke used in blast furnaces may be combusted off-site (i.e. in a sector other than 
the iron and steel industry) and should thus be accounted for separately as fuel combustion in the Energy Sector. 
 
(7)  Carbon electrodes are generally manufactured from coke, coal or tar either on-site by the users themselves or separately by 
anode production plants and then sold to users domestically and/or exported. If anodes are also imported and/or exported, 
there is no direct correspondence between fuels used for anode production and the amounts of anodes used in the country.

(8)  Mineral turpentines are often used as solvent, possibly blended with other liquids. Aromatics derived from coal oils may also 
be used as solvents. 
(9)  Emissions from asphalt production, paving of roads and roofing should be reported under 2D4. However, bitumen - and other 
oil as diluent or 'road oil' - used for this activity does not result in CO2 emissions. 
(10)  CO2 from blast furnace gas and chemical off-gases should be reported here only when utilised in public power or heat 
production.

(1)  Where the carbon contained in the emissions of CH4 and CO is significant part of the sectoral emissions, this should be copied from the corresponding columns in the Sectoral Background Table 3.4. 
This amount of carbon emitted as CH4 and CO is then subtracted from carbon stock change to avoid double counting (see Volume 4, Section 2.2.3).   
(2)  The activity data used for this column correspond to the difference between the column Area and the Area of organic soils. 
(3)  CO2 Emissions from Wetlands are reported in a separate background table (Table 3.3) that includes all gases emitted from Wetlands.

(1)   Parties should report both Controlled/Prescribed Burning and Wildfires emissions, where appropriate, in a separate manner. 
(2)   For each land type data should be selected between area burned or biomass burned. Units for area will be in hectare (ha) and for biomass burned in kilogram dry matter (kg dm).   
(3)   If CO2 emissions from biomass burning are not already included in Table 3.2 (Carbon stock changes background table), they should be reported here. Carbon stock changes associated with biomass 
burning should not also be reported in Table 3.2 to avoid double counting. 
(4)   CH4 and CO emissions from biomass burning and DOM are reported separately. 
(5)  Where the carbon contained in the emissions of CH4 and CO is a significant part of the sectoral emissions this should be transferred to the corresponding columns in the Sectoral Background Table 
3.2. This amount of carbon emitted as CH4 and CO is then subtracted from carbon stock change to avoid double counting. The conversion factors to convert CH4 and CO to C (as input to Table 3.2) 
are 12/16 for CH4 and 12/28 for CO. (see Volume 4, Section 2.2.3).

(1)  90 to 99 percent of ammonia emissions originate in the Agriculture Sector. Other emission sources for ammonia are in the Energy Sector (such as combustion, petroleum refining, catalyst cars in the 
transport sector), in the Industrial Processes and Product Use Sector in particular from production of ammonia, nitric acid, ammonium nitrate and phosphate, urea, and fertilizers), and from metal 
industry (coke ovens battery operations), and also in the Waste Sector (solid waste disposal and waste incineration).  
(2)  Indirect N2O emissions from nitrogen leaching /runoff from managed soils in AFOLU categories are included in Table 3.8. 
(3)  Any other sources not included in 3C5 and 3C6. 
(4)  Insert additional rows if necessary.
