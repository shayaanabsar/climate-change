CH4 Emissions from Flooded Land: Basis for 
Future Methodological Development 
This Appendix provides a basis for future methodological development rather than complete guidance. 
Flooded Land may emit CH4 in significant quantities, depending on a variety of characteristic such as age and 
depth of reservoirs, land-use prior to flooding, climate, and management practices. In contrast with CO2 
emissions, CH4 emissions are highly variable spatially and temporally. Current measurements of CH4 fluxes 
from Flooded Land are not sufficiently comprehensive to support the development of accurate default emission 
factors (especially for bubbles emissions and degassing emissions).  In addition, data are not available for 
countries with substantial surface area cover by reservoirs, as India, China, and Russia.   
Measurement studies do not indicate that the time elapsed since flooding has a significant influence on CH4 
fluxes from boreal and temperate reservoirs. The opposite is true in tropical regions where time elapsed since 
flooding may have a significant influence on both diffusive, bubbles CH4 and degassing emissions.  This trend 
was observed only on Petit-Saut reservoir in French Guiana (Abril et al., 2005); however, some old tropical 
reservoirs show high bubbles emissions (Duchemin et al., 2000; Stallard and Keller, 1994).  The model 
developed on Petit-Saut reservoir predicted very well the dissolved CH4 concentrations in an Ivory Coast 
reservoir (Galy-Lacaux et al., 1998). 
Evidence suggests that in Flooded Land, CH4 was generally produced exclusively from flooded soils; the 
production of this gas could sustain measured fluxes at the water-air interface (Houel, 2003; Duchemin, 2000; 
Abril et al., 2005).  
3a.1 
Flooded Land Remaining Flooded Land 
This section provides information on how to estimate CH4 emissions from Flooded Land Remaining Flooded 
Land. This information is drawn from available literature and is intended to be useful to countries that wish to 
develop preliminary estimates of CH4 emissions from this source.  Countries with potentially significant CH4 
emissions from Flooded Land seeking to report these emissions should consider the development of country-
specific emission factors to reduce overall uncertainty. Guidance on the development of such factors is provided 
in Box 2a.1 in Appendix 2.

CH4 EMISSIONS FROM FLOODED LAND REMAINING 
FLOODED LAND 
METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES 
Post-flooded CH4 emissions can occur via the following pathways:  
• 
Diffusive emissions, due to molecular diffusion across the air-water interface;  
• 
Bubble emissions, or gas emissions from the sediment through the water column via bubbles;  this is a very 
important pathway for CH4 emissions, especially  in temperate and tropical regions;  
• 
Degassing emissions, or emissions resulting from a sudden change in hydrostatic pressure, as well as the 
increased air/water exchange surface after reservoir waters flow through a turbine and/or  a spillway  (Hélie, 
2004; Soumis et al., 2004; Delmas et al., 2005); this is a very important pathway for CH4 emissions from 
young tropical reservoirs.  
The Tier 1 approach only covers diffusive emissions. Tier 2 includes a term for estimating CH4 bubble emissions, 
and if applicable, separate consideration of ice-free and ice-covered periods. Tier 3 methods refer to any detailed 
measurement-based approach that includes an estimate of all relevant CH4 fluxes from Flooded Land, which also 
includes degassing emissions, and considers the depth, the geographical localization and water temperature of 
the reservoir for its entire life-time. Tier 3 methods are not outlined further in this chapter, but countries should 
refer to Box 2a.1 in Appendix 2 on the derivation of country-specific emission factors as a resource for 
implementing a Tier 3 approach. Table 3a.1 summarizes the coverage of the three tiers and CH4 emission 
pathway.

The following section describes the Tier 2 and Tier 1 approaches for CH4 emissions.  
CHOICE OF METHOD  
Methane can be emitted from flooded lands through release of bubbles, by diffusion and by degassing.  The 
decision tree in Figure 3a.1 guides inventory compilers through the processes of selecting an appropriate 
approach for CH4 emissions from Flooded Land. Tier selection and the level of spatial and temporal 
disaggregation implemented by inventory compilers will depend upon the availability of activity data and 
emission factors, as well as the importance of reservoirs as contributors to national greenhouse gas emissions.   
Country-specific scientific evidence and data are always preferable to Tier 1 default data.   
Tier 1 
The Tier 1 method for estimating CH4 emissions from Flooded Land includes only diffusion emissions during 
ice-free period. Emissions during the ice-cover period are assumed to be zero.  Equation 3a.1 can be used with 
measured emissions provided in Table 3a.2 and country-specific total area of flooded land:

Tier 2 
A Tier 2 approach for CH4 emissions requires country-specific emission factors for diffusive and bubble 
emissions, and if applicable, accounts for different rates of diffusion and bubble emissions during the ice-free 
and ice-covered periods. Flooded land area may also be disaggregated by climatic zone, or any relevant 
parameter listed in Box 2a.1 in Appendix 2. This approach is described in Equation 3a.2.

CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTORS  
Tier 1 
The key default values for Tier 1 are emission factors for CH4 via the diffusion pathway. Table 3a.2 provides 
measured emissions for various climate zones. To the extent possible given available research, these measured 
emissions integrate spatial (intra reservoir and regional variations) and temporal variations (dry/rainy and other 
seasonal, inter-annual variations) in the emissions from reservoirs.  Default emission factors should be used in 
Tier 1 for the ice-free period only. During complete ice-cover period, CH4 emissions are assumed to be zero.  
When default data are not available, countries should use the closest default emission factors value (emissions of 
the most similar climatic region). 
Tier 2 
Under Tier 2, country-specific emission factors should be used instead of default factors to the extent possible. 
Additional estimates of winter emissions and CH4 bubble emissions are also needed, which will require the 
development of country-specific emission factors. It is anticipated that a mix of default values and country-
specific emission factors will be used when the latter do not cover the full range of environmental and 
management conditions. The development of country-specific emission factors is discussed in Box 2a.1 in 
Appendix 2. The derivation of country-specific factors should be clearly documented, and published in peer 
reviewed literature.  
CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
Several different types of activity data may be needed to estimate flooded land emissions, depending on the tier 
being implemented and the known sources of spatial and temporal variability within the national territory. These 
activity data types correspond to the same data required for CO2 emissions as described in Section 7.3.2. 
Flooded land area  
Country-specific data on flooded land area are required for all tiers to estimate diffusive and bubble emissions. 
Alternatively, countries can obtain an estimate of their flooded land area from a drainage basin cover analysis, 
from a national dam database,  from  the International Commission on Large Dams (ICOLD, 1998) or from the 
Appendix 3: CH4 Emissions from Flooded Land: Basis for Future Methodological Development 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Ap3.5 
World Commission on Dams report (WCD, 2000). Since flooded land area could change rapidly, countries 
should use updated and recent data.  Tier 2 and Tier 3 approaches preferably rely on a national database to track 
reservoirs surface area.  This database should also include other parameters as reservoir depth, year of flooding, 
reservoir localization (see Box 2a.1 in Appendix 2).  
Period of ice-free cover/Period of ice-cover 
Under Tiers 2 and 3, the periods during which the reservoirs are ice-free or ice-covered are required to estimate 
emissions of CH4 emissions. These data can be obtained from national meteorological services.  
Outflow/Spillway volume 
Under Tier 3, flooded land outflow and spillway volume are required to estimate degassing emissions of CH4.  
CH4 concentrations upstream and downstream of dams 
Under Tier 3, CH4 concentrations upstream and downstream of dams would be needed for estimating degassing 
emissions. Information on how to measure these data can be obtained from the references cited in Box 2a.1 in 
Appendix 2.

The values in the second column represent the medians of CH4 emissions reported in the literature, which themselves are arithmetic 
means of flux measured above individual reservoirs. The medians are used because the frequency distributions of underlying flux 
measurements are not normal, and their arithmetic means are already skewed by extreme values. Min and Max values are, respectively, 
the lowest and highest of all individual measurements within a given climate region; these are provided as an indication of variability 
only. Nm = number of measurements; Nres = number of reservoirs sampled. 
These measurements may include non-anthropogenic emissions (e.g., emissions from carbon in the upstream basin) and possible double 
counting of anthropogenic emissions (e.g., waste water from urban areas in the region of the reservoir) and so may overestimate the 
emissions.

UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT 
The two largest sources of uncertainty in the estimation of CH4 emissions from Flooded Land are the quality of 
emission factors for the various pathways (diffusive, bubble and degassing) and estimates of the flooded land 
areas. 
Emission factors 
As shown in Table 3a.2, average diffusive emissions can vary by an order of magnitude in boreal and temperate 
regions, and by one to three orders of magnitude in tropical regions.  The same variability in bubble emissions is 
observed in all regions (about one order of magnitude).  Therefore, the use of any default emission factor will 
result in high uncertainty. 
CH4 degasssing emissions are also an important source of uncertainty.  Degassing emissions are important 
component of GHG emissions from flooded tropical lands (Galy-lacaux et al., 1997), accounting for more than 
40% of the total GHG emissions from a nine year old reservoir (Delmas et al., 2005).  However, for many 
reservoirs degassing emissions are small or negligible (Duchemin, 2000; Soumis et al., 2004). Hence, until 
additional knowledge becomes available on the dynamics of CH4 degassing emissions, estimation should be 
conducted on a case-by-case basis.  
To reduce the uncertainties on emissions factors, countries should develop appropriate, statistically-valid 
sampling strategies that take into account natural variability of the ecosystem under study (Box 2a.1 in Appendix 
2).  When applicable, the distinction between ice-free and ice-covered periods may be a significant improvement 
in accuracy (Duchemin et al., 2005). Those sampling strategy should include enough sampling stations per 
reservoir, enough reservoirs and sampling periods.  The number of sampling stations should be determined using 
recognized statistical approach.  Moreover, countries should consider factors included in Box 2a.1 in Appendix 2. 
Flooded land surface area 
Information on the flooded area retained behind larger dams (>100 km2) should be available and will probably 
be uncertain by approximately 10%, especially in countries with large dams and hydroelectric reservoirs. For 
countries with many flooded lands and where national databases are not available, flooded area retained behind 
dams will probably be uncertain by more than 50%. Detailed information on the location, type and function of 
smaller dams may be also difficult to obtain, though statistical inference may be possible based on the size 
distribution of reservoirs for which data are available. In addition, reservoirs are created for variety of reasons 
that influence the availability of data, and, consequently, the uncertainty on surface area is dependent on country-
specific conditions. 
3a.2 
Land Converted to Flooded Land 
With the actual knowledge, for Land Converted to Flooded Land, it is suggested to use measured emissions in 
Table 3a.2. Inventory compilers should use Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 methods described in Section 3a.1 to 
estimate CH4 emissions from Land Converted to Flooded Land.
