Executive Summary
The cryosphere (including, snow, glaciers, permafrost, lake and 
river ice) is an integral element of high mountain regions, which 
are home to roughly 10% of the global population. Widespread 
cryosphere changes affect physical, biological and human systems in 
the mountains and surrounding lowlands, with impacts evident even 
in the ocean. Building on the IPCC’s 5th Assessment Report (AR5), 
this chapter assesses new evidence on observed recent and projected 
changes in the mountain cryosphere as well as associated impacts, 
risks and adaptation measures related to natural and human systems. 
Impacts in response to climate changes independently of changes in 
the cryosphere are not assessed in this chapter. Polar mountains are 
included in Chapter 3, except those in Alaska and adjacent Yukon, 
Iceland and Scandinavia, which are included in this chapter.
Observations of cryospheric changes, impacts, 
and adaptation in high mountain areas
Observations show general decline in low-elevation snow 
cover (high conﬁdence1), glaciers (very high conﬁdence) and 
permafrost (high conﬁdence) due to climate change in recent 
decades. Snow cover duration has declined in nearly all regions, 
especially at lower elevations, on average by 5  days per decade, 
with a likely2 range from 0–10 days per decade. Low elevation snow 
depth and extent have declined, although year-to-year variation is 
high. Mass change of glaciers in all mountain regions (excluding the 
Canadian and Russian Arctic, Svalbard, Greenland and Antarctica) 
was very likely -490 ± 100 kg m–2 yr–1 (-123 ± 24 Gt yr–1) in 2006–
2015. Regionally averaged mass budgets were likely most negative 
(less than -850 kg m–2 yr–1) in the southern Andes, Caucasus and the 
European Alps/Pyrenees, and least negative in High Mountain Asia 
(-150 ± 110 kg m–2 yr–1) but variations within regions are strong. 
Between 3.6–5.2  million km2 are underlain by permafrost in the 
eleven high mountain regions covered in this chapter corresponding 
to 27–29% of the global permafrost area (medium conﬁdence). 
Sparse and unevenly distributed measurements show an increase 
in permafrost temperature (high conﬁdence), for example, by 
0.19ºC ± 0.05ºC on average for about 28 locations in the European 
Alps, Scandinavia, Canada and Asia during the past decade. Other 
observations reveal decreasing permafrost thickness and loss of ice 
in the ground. {2.2.2, 2.2.3, 2.2.4} 
Glacier, snow and permafrost decline has altered the frequency, 
magnitude and location of most related natural hazards (high 
conﬁdence). Exposure of people and infrastructure to natural 
hazards has increased due to growing population, tourism and

In this report, the following summary terms are used to describe the available evidence: limited, medium, or robust; and for the degree of agreement: low, medium or 
high. A level of conﬁdence is expressed using ﬁve qualiﬁers: very low, low, medium, high and very high, and typeset in italics, for example, medium conﬁdence. For a given 
evidence and agreement statement, different conﬁdence levels can be assigned, but increasing levels of evidence and degrees of agreement are correlated with increasing 
conﬁdence (see Section 1.9.2 and Figure 1.4 for more details).

In this report, the following terms have been used to indicate the assessed likelihood of an outcome or a result: Virtually certain 99–100% probability, Very likely 90–100%, 
Likely 66–100%, About as likely as not 33–66%, Unlikely 0–33%, Very unlikely 0–10% and Exceptionally unlikely 0–1%. Additional terms (Extremely likely: 95–100%, 
More likely than not >50–100% and Extremely unlikely 0–5%) may also be used when appropriate. Assessed likelihood is typeset in italics, for example, very likely (see 
Section 1.9.2 and Figure 1.4 for more details). This Report also uses the term ‘likely range’ to indicate that the assessed likelihood of an outcome lies within the 17–83% 
probability range.
socioeconomic development (high conﬁdence). Glacier retreat 
and permafrost thaw have decreased the stability of mountain slopes 
and the integrity of infrastructure (high conﬁdence). The number 
and area of glacier lakes has increased in most regions in recent 
decades (high conﬁdence), but there is only limited evidence that 
the frequency of glacier lake outburst ﬂoods (GLOF) has changed. In 
some regions, snow avalanches involving wet snow have increased 
(medium conﬁdence), and rain-on-snow ﬂoods have decreased at 
low elevations in spring and increased at high elevations in winter 
(medium conﬁdence). The number and extent of wildﬁres have 
increased in the Western USA partly due to early snowmelt (medium 
conﬁdence). {2.3.2, 2.3.3}
Changes in snow and glaciers have changed the amount and 
seasonality of runoff in snow-dominated and glacier-fed river 
basins (very high conﬁdence) with local impacts on water 
resources and agriculture (medium conﬁdence). Winter runoff 
has increased in recent decades due to more precipitation falling as 
rain (high conﬁdence). In some glacier-fed rivers, summer and annual 
runoff have increased due to intensiﬁed glacier melt, but decreased 
where glacier melt water has lessened as glacier area shrinks. 
Decreases were observed especially in regions dominated by small 
glaciers, such as the European Alps (medium conﬁdence). Glacier 
retreat and snow cover changes have contributed to localized declines 
in agricultural yields in some high mountain regions, including the 
Hindu Kush Himalaya and the tropical Andes (medium conﬁdence). 
There is limited evidence of impacts on operation and productivity 
of hydropower facilities resulting from changes in seasonality and 
both increases and decreases in water input, for example, in the 
European Alps, Iceland, Western Canada and USA, and the tropical 
Andes. {2.3.1}
Species composition and abundance have markedly changed 
in high mountain ecosystems in recent decades (very high 
conﬁdence), partly due to changes in the cryosphere (high 
conﬁdence). Habitats for establishment by formerly absent species 
have opened up or been altered by reduced snow cover (high 
conﬁdence), retreating glaciers (very high conﬁdence), and thawing 
of permafrost (medium conﬁdence). Reductions in glacier and 
snow cover have directly altered the structure of many freshwater 
communities (high conﬁdence). Reduced snow cover has negatively 
impacted the reproductive ﬁtness of some snow-dependent 
plant and animal species, including foraging and predator-prey 
relationships of mammals (high conﬁdence). Upslope migration 
of individual species, mostly due to warming and to a lesser extent 
due to cryosphere-related changes, has often increased local species 
richness (very high conﬁdence). Some cold-adapted species, including 
endemics, in terrestrial and freshwater communities have declined 
134

in abundance (high conﬁdence). While the plant productivity has 
generally increased, the actual impact on provisioning, regulating and 
cultural ecosystem services varies greatly (high conﬁdence). {2.3.3}
Tourism and recreation activities such as skiing, glacier 
tourism and mountaineering have been negatively impacted 
by declining snow cover, glaciers and permafrost (medium 
conﬁdence). In several regions, worsening route safety has reduced 
mountaineering opportunities (medium conﬁdence). Variability and 
decline in natural snow cover have compromised the operation of 
low-elevation ski resorts (high conﬁdence). Glacier and snow decline 
have impacted aesthetic, spiritual and other cultural aspects of 
mountain landscapes (medium conﬁdence), reducing the well-being 
of people (e.g.,  in the Himalaya, eastern Africa, and the tropical 
Andes). {2.3.5, 2.3.6}
Adaptation in agriculture, tourism and drinking water supply 
has aimed to reduce the impacts of cryosphere change 
(medium conﬁdence), though there is limited evidence on their 
effectiveness owing to a lack of formal evaluations, or technical, 
ﬁnancial and institutional barriers to implementation. In some 
places, artiﬁcial snowmaking has reduced the negative impacts on 
ski tourism (medium conﬁdence). Release and storage of water from 
reservoirs according to sectoral needs (agriculture, drinking water, 
ecosystems) has reduced the impact of seasonal variability on runoff 
(medium conﬁdence). {2.3.1, 2.3.5} 
Future projections of cryospheric changes, their impacts 
and risks, and adaptation in high mountain areas
Snow cover, glaciers and permafrost are projected to continue 
to decline in almost all regions throughout the 21st century 
(high conﬁdence). Compared to 1986–2005, low elevation snow 
depth will likely decrease by 10–40% for 2031–2050, regardless of 
Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) and for 2081–2100, 
likely by 10–40 % for RCP2.6 and by 50–90% for RCP8.5. Projected 
glacier mass reductions between 2015–2100 are likely 22–44% for 
RCP2.6 and 37–57% for RCP8.5. In regions with mostly smaller 
glaciers and relatively little ice cover (e.g., European Alps, Pyrenees, 
Caucasus, North Asia, Scandinavia, tropical Andes, Mexico, eastern 
Africa and Indonesia), glaciers will lose more than 80% of their 
current mass by 2100 under RCP8.5 (medium conﬁdence), and 
many glaciers will disappear regardless emission scenario (very high 
conﬁdence). Permafrost thaw and degradation will increase during 
the 21st century (very high conﬁdence) but quantitative projections 
are scarce. {2.2.2, 2.2.3, 2.2.4}
Most types of natural hazards are projected to change in 
frequency, magnitude and areas affected as the cryosphere 
continues to decline (high conﬁdence). Glacier retreat and 
permafrost thaw are projected to decrease the stability of mountain 
slopes and increase the number and area of glacier lakes (high 
conﬁdence). Resulting landslides and ﬂoods, and cascading events, 
will also emerge where there is no record of previous events (high 
conﬁdence). Snow avalanches are projected to decline in number 
and runout distance at lower elevation, and avalanches involving wet 
snow even in winter will occur more frequently (medium conﬁdence). 
Rain-on-snow ﬂoods will occur earlier in spring and later in autumn, 
and be more frequent at higher elevations and less frequent at lower 
elevations (high conﬁdence). {2.3.2, 2.3.3}
River runoff in snow dominated and glacier-fed river basins 
will change further in amount and seasonality in response to 
projected snow cover and glacier decline (very high conﬁdence) 
with negative impacts on agriculture, hydropower and water 
quality in some regions (medium conﬁdence). The average 
winter snowmelt runoff is projected to increase (high conﬁdence), and 
spring peaks to occur earlier (very high conﬁdence). Projected trends 
in annual runoff vary substantially among regions, and can even be 
opposite in direction, but there is high conﬁdence that in all regions 
average annual runoff from glaciers will have reached a peak that 
will be followed by declining runoff at the latest by the end of the 
21st century. Declining runoff is expected to reduce the productivity 
of irrigated agriculture in some regions (medium conﬁdence). 
Hydropower operations will increasingly be impacted by altered 
amount and seasonality of water supply from snow and glacier melt 
(high conﬁdence). The release of heavy metals, particularly mercury, 
and other legacy contaminants currently stored in glaciers and 
permafrost, is projected to reduce water quality for freshwater biota, 
household use and irrigation (medium conﬁdence). {2.3.1}
Current trends in cryosphere-related changes in high mountain 
ecosystems are expected to continue and impacts to intensify 
(very high conﬁdence). While high mountains will provide new 
and greater habitat area, including refugia for lowland species, 
both range expansion and shrinkage are projected, and at high 
elevations this will lead to population declines (high conﬁdence). 
The latter increases the risk of local extinctions, in particular for 
freshwater cold-adapted species (medium conﬁdence). Without 
genetic plasticity and/or behavioural shifts, cryospheric changes will 
continue to negatively impact endemic and native species, such as 
some coldwater ﬁsh (e.g., trout) and species whose traits directly 
depend on snow (e.g.,  snowshoe hares) or many large mammals 
(medium conﬁdence). The survival of such species will depend 
on appropriate conservation and adaptation measures (medium 
conﬁdence). Many projected ecological changes will alter ecosystem 
services (high conﬁdence), affecting ecological disturbances (e.g., 
ﬁre, rock fall, slope erosion) with considerable impacts on people 
(medium conﬁdence). {2.3.3}
Cultural assets, such as snow- and ice-covered peaks in many 
UNESCO World Heritage sites, and tourism and recreation 
activities, are expected to be negatively affected by future 
cryospheric change in many regions (high conﬁdence). Current 
snowmaking technologies are projected to be less effective in 
a warmer climate in reducing risks to ski tourism in most parts of 
Europe, North America and Japan, in particular at 2ºC global warming 
and beyond (high conﬁdence). Diversiﬁcation through year-round 
activities supports adaptation of tourism under future climate change 
(medium conﬁdence). {2.3.5, 2.3.6}

Enablers and response options to promote adaptation 
and sustainable development in high mountain areas
The already committed and unavoidable climate change 
affecting all cryosphere elements, irrespective of the emission 
scenario, points to integrated adaptation planning to support 
and enhance water availability, access, and management 
(medium conﬁdence). Integrated management approaches 
for water across all scales, in particular for energy,  agriculture, 
ecosystems and drinking water supply, can be effective at dealing 
with impacts from changes in the cryosphere. These approaches also 
offer opportunities to support social-ecological systems, through the 
development and optimisation of storage and the release of water from 
reservoirs (medium conﬁdence), while being cognisant of potential 
negative implications for some ecosystems. Success in implementing 
such management options depends on the participation of relevant 
stakeholders, including affected communities, diverse knowledge 
and adequate tools for monitoring and projecting future conditions, 
and ﬁnancial and institutional resources to support planning and 
implementation (medium conﬁdence). {2.3.1, 2.3.3, 2.4}
Effective governance is a key enabler for reducing disaster 
risk, considering relevant exposure factors such as planning, 
zoning, and urbanisation pressures, as well as vulnerability 
factors such as poverty, which can challenge efforts towards 
resilience and sustainable development for communities 
(medium conﬁdence). Reducing losses to disasters depend on 
integrated and coordinated approaches to account for the hazards 
concerned, the degree of exposure, and existing vulnerabilities. 
Diverse knowledge that includes community and multi-stakeholder 
experience with past impacts complements scientiﬁc knowledge to 
anticipate future risks. {CCB-1, 2.3.2, 2.4}  
International cooperation, treaties and conventions exist for 
some mountain regions and transboundary river basins with 
potential to support adaptation action. However, there is 
limited evidence on the extent to which impacts and losses 
arising from changes in the cryosphere are speciﬁcally 
monitored and addressed in these frameworks. A wide range 
of institutional arrangements and practices have emerged over the 
past three decades that respond to a shared global mountain agenda 
and speciﬁc regional priorities. There is potential to strengthen 
them to also respond to climate-related cryosphere risks and open 
opportunities for development through adaptation (limited evidence, 
high agreement). The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Sendai 
Framework and Paris Agreement have directed some attention in 
mountain-speciﬁc research and practice towards the monitoring and 
reporting on targets and indicators speciﬁed therein. {2.3.1, 2.4}

2.1 
Introduction
High mountain regions share common features, including rugged 
terrain, a low-temperature climate regime, steep slopes and 
institutional and spatial remoteness. These features are often linked 
to physical and social-ecological processes that, although not unique 
to mountain regions, typify many of the special aspects of these 
regions. Due to their higher elevation compared with the surrounding 
landscape, mountains often feature cryosphere components, such as 
glaciers, snow cover and permafrost, with a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on 
surrounding lowland areas even far from the mountains (Huggel 
et al., 2015a). Hence the mountain cryosphere plays a major role in 
large parts of the world. Considering the close relationship between 
mountains and the cryosphere, high mountain areas are addressed 
in a dedicated chapter within this special report. Almost 10% 
(671 million people) of the global population lived in high mountain 
regions in 2010, based on gridded population data (Jones and 
O’Neill, 2016) and a distance of less than 100 km from glaciers or 
permafrost located in mountains areas as deﬁned in Figure 2.1. This 
population is expected to grow to 736–844 million across the shared 
socioeconomic pathways by 2050 (Gao, 2019). Many people living 
outside of mountain areas and not included in these numbers are 
also affected by changes in the mountain cryosphere.
This chapter assesses recent and projected changes in glaciers, snow 
cover, permafrost and lake and river ice in high mountain areas, their 
drivers, as well as their impact on the different services provided by 
the cryosphere and related adaptation, with a focus on literature 
published after AR5. The assessment of cryospheric change is focused 
on recent decades rather than a perspective over a longer period,

Figure 2.1 |   Distribution of mountain areas (orange shading) and glaciers (blue) as well as regional summary statistics for glaciers and permafrost in mountains. Mountains 
are distinguished based on a ruggedness index (>3.5), a logarithmically scaled measure of relative relief (Gruber, 2012). Eleven distinct regions with glaciers, generally 
corresponding to the primary regions in the Randolph Glacier Inventory, RGI v6.0 (RGI Consortium, 2017) are outlined, although some cryosphere related impacts presented in 
this chapter may go beyond these regions. Region names correspond to those in the RGI. Diamonds represent regional glacier area (RGI 6.0) and circles the permafrost area in 
all mountains within each region boundary (Obu et al., 2019). Histograms for each region show glacier and permafrost area in 200 m elevation bins as a percentage of total 
regional glacier and permafrost area, respectively. Also shown is the median elevation of the annual mean 0ºC free-atmosphere isotherm calculated from the ERA-5 re-analysis 
of the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts over each region’s mountain area for the period 2006–2015, with 25–75% quantiles in grey. The annual 0ºC 
isotherm elevation roughly separates the areas where precipitation predominantly falls as snow and rain. Areas above and below this elevation are loosely referred to as high 
and low elevations, respectively, in this chapter.

and future changes spanning the 21st century. A palaeo-perspective 
is covered in IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) Working Group I 
contribution on ‘The Physical Science Basis’. High mountain areas, 
as discussed here, include all mountain regions where glaciers, snow 
or permafrost are prominent features of the landscape, without a 
strict and quantitative demarcation, but with a focus on distinct 
regions (Figure 2.1). Mountain regions located in the polar regions 
are considered in Chapter 3 except those in Iceland, Scandinavia and 
Alaska and parts of adjacent Yukon Territory and British Columbia, 
which are included in this chapter. Many changes in the mountain 
environment are not solely or directly related to climate change 
induced changes in the cryosphere, but to other direct or indirect 
effects of climate change, or to other consequences of socioeconomic 
development. Consistent with the scope of this report with a focus 
on the ocean and the cryosphere, this section deals primarily with 
the impacts that can at least partially be attributed to cryosphere 
changes. Even though other drivers may be the dominant driver 
of change in many cases, they are not considered explicitly in this 
chapter, although unambiguous attribution to cryosphere changes is 
often difﬁcult.
2.2 
Changes in the Mountain Cryosphere
2.2.1 
Atmospheric Drivers of Changes 
in the Mountain Cryosphere
Past changes of surface air temperature and precipitation in high 
mountain areas have been documented by in situ observations 
and regional reanalyses (Table SM2.2 and Table SM2.4). However, 
mountain observation networks do not always follow standard 
measurement procedures (Oyler et al., 2015; Nitu et al., 2018) 
and are often insufﬁciently dense to capture ﬁne-scale changes 
(Lawrimore et al., 2011) and the underlying larger scale patterns. 
Future changes are projected using General Circulation Models 
(GCMs) or Regional Climate Models (RCMs) or simpliﬁed versions 
thereof (e.g.,  Gutmann et al., 2016), used to represent processes 
at play in a dynamically consistent manner, and to relate mountain 
changes to larger-scale atmospheric forcing based on physical 
principles. Existing mountain-speciﬁc model studies typically cover 
individual mountain ranges, and there is currently no initiative found, 
such as model intercomparisons or coordinated model experiments, 
which speciﬁcally and comprehensively addresses high mountain 
meteorology and climate globally. This makes it difﬁcult to provide 
a globally uniform assessment.
2.2.1.1 
Surface Air Temperature
Mountain surface air temperature observations in Western North 
America, European Alps and High Mountain Asia show warming 
over recent decades at an average rate of 0.3ºC per decade, with a 
likely range of ± 0.2ºC, thereby outpacing the global warming rate 
0.2 ± 0.1ºC per decade (IPCC, 2018). Underlying data from global 
and regional studies are compiled in Table SM2.2, and Figure 2.2 
provides a synthesis on mountain warming trends, mostly based 
on studies using in situ observations. Local warming rates depend 
on the season (high conﬁdence). For example, in the European Alps, 
warming has been found to be more pronounced in summer and 
spring (Auer et al., 2007; Ceppi et al., 2012), while on the Tibetan 
Plateau warming is stronger in winter (Liu et al., 2009; You et al., 
2010). Studies comparing observations at lower and higher elevation 
at the global scale indicate that warming is generally enhanced 
above 500 m above sea level (a.s.l.) (e.g., Wang et al., 2016a; Qixiang 
et al., 2018, Table SM2.2). At the local and regional scale, evidence for 
elevation dependent warming, i.e., that the warming rate is different 
across elevation bands, is scattered and sometimes contradictory 
(Box 2.1). On the Tibetan Plateau, evidence based on combining in 
situ observations (often scarce at high elevation) with remote sensing 
and modelling approaches, indicates that warming is ampliﬁed 
around 4,000 m a.s.l., but not above 5,000 m a.s.l. (Qin et al., 2009; 
Gao et al., 2018). Studies in the Italian Alps (Tudoroiu et al., 2016) 
and Southern Himalaya (Nepal, 2016) have shown higher warming 
at lower elevation. Evidence from Western North and South America 
is conﬂicting (Table SM2.2). In other regions, evidence to assess 
whether warming varies with elevation is insufﬁcient. In summary, 
there is medium evidence (medium agreement) that surface warming 
is different across elevation bands. Observed changes also depend on 
the type of temperature indicator: changes in daily mean, minimum

and maximum temperature can display contrasting patterns 
depending on region, season and elevation (Table SM2.2).
Attribution studies for changes in surface air temperature speciﬁcally 
in mountain regions are rare. Bonﬁls et al. (2008) and Dileepkumar et al. 
(2018) demonstrated that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions 
are the dominant factor in the recent temperature increases, partially 
compensated by other anthropogenic factors (land use change 
and aerosol emissions for Western USA and Western Himalaya, 
respectively). These ﬁndings are consistent with conclusions of AR5 
regarding anthropogenic effects (Bindoff et al., 2013). It is thus likely 
that anthropogenic inﬂuence is the main contributor to surface 
temperature increases in high mountain regions since the mid-20th 
century, ampliﬁed by regional feedbacks.
Until the mid-21st century, regardless of the climate scenario 
(Cross-Chapter Box  1 in Chapter  1), surface air temperature is 
projected to continue increasing (very high conﬁdence) at an 
average rate of 0.3ºC per decade, with a likely range of ±0.2ºC per 
decade, locally even more in some regions, generally outpacing 
global warming rates (0.2 ± 0.1ºC per decade; IPCC, 2018) (high 
conﬁdence). Beyond mid-21st century, atmospheric warming in 
mountains will be stronger under a high greenhouse gas emission 
scenario (RCP8.5) and will stabilise at mid-21st levels under a low 
greenhouse gas emission scenario (RCP2.6), similar to global change 
patterns (very high conﬁdence). The warming rate will result from the 
combination of regional (high conﬁdence) and elevation-dependent 
(medium conﬁdence) enhancement factors. Underlying evidence 
of future projections from global and regional studies is provided 
in Table SM2.3. Figure  2.3 provides examples of regional climate 
projections of surface air temperature, as a function of elevation and 
season (winter and summer) in North America (Rocky Mountains), 
South America (Subtropical Central Andes), Europe (European Alps) 
and High Mountain Asia (Hindu Kush, Karakoram, Himalaya), based 
on global and regional climate projections. 
2.2.1.2 
Rainfall and Snowfall
Past precipitation changes are less well quantiﬁed than temperature 
changes and are often more heterogeneous, even within mountain 
regions (Hartmann and Andresky, 2013). Regional patterns are 
characterised by decadal variability (Mankin and Diffenbaugh, 
2015) and inﬂuenced by shifts in large-scale atmospheric circulation 
(e.g., in Alaska; Winski et al., 2017). While mountain regions do not 
exhibit clear direction of trends in annual precipitation over the past 
decades (medium conﬁdence that there is no trend), snowfall has 
decreased, at least in part due to higher temperatures, especially at 
lower elevation (Table SM2.4, high conﬁdence).
Future projections of annual precipitation indicate increases of the 
order of 5 to 20% over the 21st century in many mountain regions, 
including the Hindu Kush and Himalaya, East Asia, eastern Africa, 
Box 2.1 |  Does Atmospheric Warming in the Mountains Depend on Elevation?
In mountain regions, surface air temperature generally tends to decrease with increasing elevation thus directly impacting how much 
of the precipitation falls as snow as opposed to rain. Therefore, changes in air temperature have different consequences for snow 
cover, permafrost and glaciers at different elevations. A number of studies have reported that trends in air temperature vary with 
elevation, a phenomenon referred to as elevation dependent warming (EDW; Pepin et al., 2015, and references therein), with potential 
consequences beyond those of uniform warming. EDW does not imply that warming is larger at higher elevation, and smaller at lower 
elevation, but it means that the warming rate (e.g., in ºC per decade) is not the same across all elevation bands. Although this concept 
has received wide attention in recent years, the manifestation of EDW varies by region, season and temperature indicator (e.g., daily 
mean, minimum or maximum temperature), meaning that a uniform pattern does not exist. The identiﬁcation of the underlying driving 
mechanisms for EDW and how they combine is complex.
Several physical processes contribute to EDW, and quantifying their relative contributions has remained largely elusive (Minder et al., 
2018; Palazzi et al., 2019). Some of the processes identiﬁed are similar to those explaining the ampliﬁed warming in the polar regions 
(Chapter 3). For example, the sensitivity of temperature to radiative forcing is increased at low temperatures common in both polar and 
mountain environments (Ohmura, 2012). Because the relationship between speciﬁc humidity and downwelling radiation is nonlinear, 
in a dry and cold atmosphere found at high elevation, any increase in atmospheric humidity due to temperature increase drives 
disproportionately large warming (Rangwala et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2014). Snow-albedo feedback plays an important role where the 
snow cover is in decline (Pepin and Lundquist, 2008; Scherrer et al., 2012), increasing the absorption of solar radiation which in turn 
leads to increased surface air temperature and further snowmelt. Other processes are speciﬁc to the mountain environment. Especially 
in the tropics, warming can be enhanced at higher elevation by a reduction of the vertical temperature gradient, due to increased 
latent heat release above the condensation level, favored in a warmer and moister atmosphere (Held and Soden, 2006). The cooling 
effect of aerosols, which also cause solar dimming, is more pronounced at low elevation and reduced at high elevation (Zeng et al., 
2015). While many mechanisms suggest that warming should be enhanced at high elevation, observed and simulated EDW patterns 
are usually more complex (Pepin et al., 2015, and references therein). Numerical simulations by global and regional climate models, 
which show EDW, need to be considered carefully because of intrinsic limitations due to potentially incomplete understanding and 
implementation of relevant physical processes, in addition to coarse grid spacing with respect to mountainous topography (Ménégoz 
et al., 2014; Winter et al., 2017).

the European Alps and the Carpathian region, and decreases in 
the Mediterranean and the Southern Andes (medium conﬁdence, 
Table SM2.5). Changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme 
precipitation events vary according to season and region. For 
example, across the Himalayan-Tibetan Plateau mountains, the 
frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events are projected 
to increase throughout the 21st century, particularly during the 
summer monsoon (Panday et al., 2015; Sanjay et al., 2017). This 
suggests a transition toward more episodic and intense monsoonal 
precipitation, especially in the easternmost part of the Himalayan 
chain (Palazzi et al., 2013). Increases in winter precipitation extremes 
are projected in the European Alps (Rajczak and Schär, 2017). 
At lower elevation, near term (2031–2050) and end of century 
(2081–2100) projections of snowfall all indicate a decrease, for all 
greenhouse gas emission scenarios (very high conﬁdence). At higher 
elevation, where temperature increase is insufﬁcient to affect rain/
snow partitioning, total winter precipitation increases can lead to 
increased snowfall (e.g.,  Kapnick and Delworth, 2013; O’Gorman, 
2014) (medium conﬁdence).
2.2.1.3 
Other Meteorological Variables
Atmospheric humidity, incoming shortwave and longwave radiation, 
and near-surface wind speed and direction also inﬂuence the high 
mountain cryosphere. Detecting their changes and associated 
effects on the cryosphere is even more challenging than for surface 
air temperature and precipitation, both from an observation 
and modelling standpoint. Therefore, most simulation studies 
of cryosphere changes are mainly driven by temperature and 
precipitation (see, e.g., Beniston et al., 2018, and references therein).
Atmospheric moisture content, which is generally increasing in 
a warming atmosphere (Stocker et al., 2013), affects latent and 
longwave heat ﬂuxes (Armstrong and Brun, 2008) with implications 
for the timing and rate of snow and ice ablation, and in some areas 
changes in atmospheric moisture content could be a signiﬁcant driver 
of cryosphere change (Harpold and Brooks, 2018). Short-lived climate 
forcers, such as sulphur and black carbon aerosols (You et al., 2013), 
reduce the amount of solar radiation reaching the surface, with 
potential impacts on snow and ice ablation. Solar brightening caused 
by declining anthropogenic aerosols in Europe since the 1980s was

shown to have only a minor effect on atmospheric warming at high 
elevation (Philipona, 2013), and effects on the cryosphere were not 
speciﬁcally discussed.
Wind controls preferential deposition of precipitation, post- 
depositional snow drift and affects ablation of snow and glaciers 
through turbulent ﬂuxes. Near-surface wind speed has decreased on 
the Tibetan Plateau between the 1970s and early 2000s, and stabilised 
or increased slightly thereafter (Yang et al., 2014a; Kuang and Jiao, 
2016). This is consistent with existing evidence for a decrease in 
near-surface wind speed on mid-latitude continental areas since the 
mid-20th century (Hartmann et al., 2013). In general, the literature on 
past and future changes of near-surface wind patterns in mountain 
areas is very limited.
2.2.2 
Snow Cover
Snow on the ground is an essential and widespread component of 
the mountain cryosphere. It affects mountain ecosystems and plays 
a major role for mass movement and ﬂoods in the mountains. It 
plays a key role in nourishing glaciers and provides an insulating and 
reﬂective cover at their surface. It inﬂuences the thermal regime of 
the underlying ground, including permafrost, with implications for 
ecosystems. Climate change modiﬁes key variables driving the onset 
and development of the snow cover (e.g., solid precipitation), and 
those responsible for its ablation (e.g., air temperature, radiation). 
The snow cover, especially in low-lying and mid-elevation areas of 
mountain regions, has long been identiﬁed to be particularly sensitive 
to climate change. 
The mountain snow cover is characterised by a very strong 
interannual and decadal variability, similar to its main driving force 
solid precipitation (Lafaysse et al., 2014; Mankin and Diffenbaugh, 
2015). Observations spanning several decades are required to 
quantify trends. Long-term in situ records are scarce in some regions 
of the world, particularly in High Mountain Asia, Northern Asia and 
South America (Rohrer et al., 2013). Satellite remote sensing provides 
new capabilities for monitoring mountain snow cover on regional 
scales. The satellite record length is often insufﬁcient to assess trends 
(Bormann et al., 2018). Evidence of past changes from regional 
studies is provided in Table SM2.6. At lower elevation, there is high 
conﬁdence that the mountain snow cover has generally declined 
in duration (on average by 5 snow cover days per decade, with a 
likely range from 0 to 10 days per decade), mean snow depth and 
accumulated mass (snow water equivalent) since the middle of the 
20th century, with regional variations. At higher elevation, snow cover 
trends are generally insigniﬁcant (medium conﬁdence) or unknown.
Most of the snow cover changes can be attributed, at lower 
elevation, to more precipitation falling as liquid precipitation (rain) 
and to increases in melt at all elevations, mostly due to changes in 
atmospheric forcings, especially increased air temperature (Kapnick 
and Hall, 2012; Marty et al., 2017) which in turn are attributed to 
anthropogenic forcings at a larger scale (Section  2.2.1). Formal 
anthropogenic attribution studies provide similar conclusions in 
Western North America (Pierce et al., 2008; Najaﬁ et al., 2017).
Assessing the impact of the deposition of short-lived climate forcers 
on snow cover changes is an emerging issue (Skiles et al., 2018 
and references therein). This concerns light absorbing particles, in 
particular, which include deposited aerosols such as black carbon, 
organic carbon and mineral dust, or microbial growth (Qian 
et al., 2015), although the role of the latter has not been speciﬁcally 
quantiﬁed. Due to their seasonally variable deposition ﬂux and 
impact, and mostly episodic nature in case of dust deposition 
(Kaspari et al., 2014; Di Mauro et al., 2015), light absorbing particles 
contribute to interannual ﬂuctuations of seasonal snowmelt rate 
(Painter et al., 2018) (medium evidence, high agreement). There is 
limited evidence (medium agreement) that increases in black carbon 
deposition from anthropogenic and biomass burning sources have 
contributed to snow cover decline in High Mountain Asia (Li et al., 
2016; Zhang et al., 2018) and South America (Molina et al., 2015). 
Projected changes of mountain snow cover are studied based on 
climate model experiments, either directly from GCM or RCM output, 
or following downscaling and the use of snowpack models. These 
projections generally do not speciﬁcally account for future changes 
in the deposition rate of light absorbing particles on snow (or, if 
so, simple approaches have been used hitherto; e.g., Deems et al., 
2013), so that future changes in snow conditions are mostly driven 
by changes in meteorological drivers assessed in Section  2.2.1. 
Evidence from regional studies is provided in Table SM2.7. Although 
existing studies in mountain regions do not use homogenous 
reference periods and model conﬁgurations, common future trends 
can be summarised as follows. At lower elevation in many regions 
such as the European Alps, Western North America, Himalaya and 
subtropical Andes, the snow depth or mass is projected to decline by 
25% (likely range between 10 and 40%), between the recent past 
period (1986–2005) and the near future (2031–2050), regardless 
of the greenhouse gas emission scenario (Cross-Chapter Box  1 
in Chapter  1). This corresponds to a continuation of the ongoing 
decrease in annual snow cover duration (on average 5 days per 
decade, with a likely range from 0 to 10). By the end of the century 
(2081–2100), reductions of up to 80% (likely range from 50 to 90%) 
are expected under RCP8.5, 50% (likely range from 30 to 70%) under 
RCP4.5 and 30% (likely range from 10 to 40%) under RCP2.6. At 
higher elevations, projected reductions are smaller (high conﬁdence), 
as temperature increases at higher elevations affect the ablation 
component of snow mass evolution, rather than both the onset and 
accumulation components. The projected increase in winter snow 
accumulation may result in a net increase in winter snow mass 
(medium conﬁdence). All elevation levels and mountain regions 
are projected to exhibit sustained interannual variability of snow 
conditions throughout the 21st century (high conﬁdence). Figure 2.3 
provides projections of temperature and snow cover in mountain 
areas in Europe, High Mountain Asia (Hindu Kush, Karakoram and 
Himalaya), North America (Rocky Mountains) and South America 
(sub-tropical Central Andes), illustrating how changes vary with 
elevation, season, region, future time period and climate scenario.

Glaciers
The high mountain areas considered in this chapter (Figure  2.1), 
including all glacier regions in the world except those in Antarctica, 
Greenland, the Canadian and Russian Arctic, and Svalbard (which are 
covered in Chapter 3) include ~170,000 glaciers covering an area 
of ~250,000 km2 (RGI Consortium, 2017) with a total ice volume of 
87 ± 15 mm sea level equivalent (Farinotti et al., 2019). These glaciers 
span an elevation range from sea level, for example in south-east 
Alaska, to >8,000 m a.s.l. in the Himalaya and Karakoram, and occupy 
diverse climatic regions. Their mass budget is determined largely by 
the balance between snow accumulation and melt at the glacier 
surface, driven primarily by atmospheric conditions. Rapid changes in 
mountain glaciers have multiple impacts for social-ecological systems, 
affecting not only biophysical properties such as runoff volume 
and sediment ﬂuxes in glacier-fed rivers, glacier related hazards, 
and global sea level (Chapter 4) but also ecosystems and human 
livelihoods, socioeconomic activities and sectors such as agriculture 
and tourism, as well as other intrinsic assets such as cultural values. 
While glaciers worldwide have experienced considerable ﬂuctuations 
throughout the Holocene driven by multidecadal variations of 
solar and volcanic activity, and changes in atmospheric circulation

(Solomina et al., 2016), this section focuses on observed glacier 
changes during recent decades and changes projected for the 21st 
century (Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 2).
Satellite and in situ observations of changes in glacier area, length 
and mass show a globally largely coherent picture of mountain 
glacier recession in the last decades (Zemp et al., 2015), although 
annual variability and regional differences are large (Figure 2.4; very 
high conﬁdence). The global trend is statistically signiﬁcant despite 
considerable interannual and regional variations (Medwedeff and Roe, 
2017). Since AR5’s global 2003–2009 estimate based on Gardner et al. 
(2013), several new estimates of global-scale glacier mass budgets 
have emerged using largely improved data coverage and methods 
(Bamber et al., 2018; Wouters et al., 2019; Zemp et al., 2019).
These estimates combined with available regional estimates 
(Table 2.A.1) indicate that the glacier mass budget of all mountain 
regions (excluding Antarctica, Greenland, the Canadian and 
Russian Arctic, and Svalbard) was very likely -490 ± 100 kg m–2 yr–1 
(-123 ± 24 Gt yr–1) during the period 2006–2015 with most negative 
averages (less than -850 kg m–2 yr–1) in the Southern Andes, Caucasus/
Middle East, European Alps and Pyrenees. High Mountain Asia shows 
the least negative mass budget (-150 ± 110 kg m–2 yr–1, Figure 2.4), 
but variations within the region are large with most negative regional 
balance estimates in Nyainqentanglha, Tibet (-620 ± 230 kg m–2 yr–1) 
and slightly positive balances in the Kunlun Mountains for the period 
2000–2016 (Brun et al., 2017). Due to large ice extent, the total 
mass loss and corresponding contribution to sea level 2006–2015 is 
largest in Alaska, followed by the Southern Andes and High Mountain 
Asia (Table 2.A.1). Zemp et al. (2019) estimated an increase in mean 
global-scale glacier mass loss by ~30% between 1986–2005 and 
2006–2015.
It is very likely that atmospheric warming is the primary driver for the 
global glacier recession (Marzeion et al., 2014; Vuille et al., 2018). 
There is limited evidence (high agreement) that human-induced 
increases in greenhouse gases have contributed to the observed 
mass changes (Hirabayashi et al., 2016). It was estimated that the 
anthropogenic fraction of mass loss of all glaciers outside Greenland 
and Antarctica increased from 25 ± 35% during 1851–2010 to 
69 ± 24% during 1991–2010 (Marzeion et al., 2014). 
Other factors, such as changes in meteorological variables other 
than air temperature or internal glacier dynamics, have modiﬁed 
the temperature-induced glacier response in some regions (high 
conﬁdence). For example, glacier mass loss over the last seven 
decades on a glacier in the European Alps was intensiﬁed by higher 
air moisture leading to increased longwave irradiance and reduced 
sublimation (Thibert et al., 2018). Changes in air moisture have also 
been found to play a signiﬁcant role in past glacier mass changes 
in eastern Africa (Prinz et al., 2016), while an increase in shortwave 
radiation due to reduced cloud cover contributed to an acceleration 
in glacier recession in the Caucasus (Toropov et al., 2019). In the 
Tien Shan mountains changes in atmospheric circulation in the 
North Atlantic and North Paciﬁc in the 1970s resulted in an abrupt 
reduction in precipitation and thus snow accumulation, amplifying 
temperature-induced glacier mass loss (Duethmann et al., 2015). 
Deposition of light absorbing particles, growth of algae and bacteria 
and local ampliﬁcation phenomena such as the enhancement of 
particles concentration due to surface snow and ice melt, and 
cryoconite holes, have been shown to enhance ice melt (e.g., Ginot 
et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2017; Williamson et al., 2019) but there 
is limited evidence and low agreement that long-term changes in 
glacier mass are linked to light absorbing particles (Painter et al., 
2013; Sigl et al., 2018). Debris cover can  modulate glacier melt but 
there is limited evidence on its role in recent glacier changes (Gardelle 
et al., 2012; Pellicciotti et al., 2015). Rapid retreat of calving outlet 
glaciers in Patagonia was attributed to changes in glacier dynamics 
(Sakakibara and Sugiyama, 2014).
Departing from this global trend of glacier recession, a small fraction 
of glaciers have gained mass or advanced in some regions mostly 
due to internal glacier dynamics or, in some cases, locally restricted 
climatic causes. For example, in Alaska 36 marine-terminating 
glaciers exhibited a complex pattern of periods of signiﬁcant retreat 
and advance during 1948–2012, highly variable in time and lacking 
coherent regional behaviour (McNabb and Hock, 2014). These 
ﬂuctuations can be explained by internal retreat-advance cycles 
typical of tidewater glaciers that are largely independent of climate 
(Brinkerhoff et al., 2017). Irregular and spatially inconsistent glacier 
advances, for example, in Alaska, Iceland and Karakoram, have been 
associated with surge-type ﬂow instabilities largely independent of 
changes in climate (Sevestre and Benn, 2015; Bhambri et al., 2017; 
Section  2.3.2). Regional scale glacier mass gain and advances in 
Norway in the 1990s and in New Zealand between 1983–2008 have 
been linked to local increases in snow precipitation (Andreassen 
et al., 2005) and lower air temperatures (Mackintosh et al., 2017), 
respectively, caused by changes in atmospheric circulation. Advances 
of some glaciers in Alaska, the Andes, Kamchatka and the Caucasus 
were attributed to volcanic activity causing ﬂow acceleration through 
enhanced melt water at the ice-bed interface (Barr et al., 2018).
Region averaged glacier mass budgets have been nearly balanced 
in the Karakoram since at least the 1970s (Bolch et al., 2017; Zhou 
et al., 2017; Azam et al., 2018), while slightly positive balances since 
2000 have been reported in the western Kunlun Shan, eastern Pamir, 
and the central and northern Karakoram mountains (Gardelle et al., 
2013; Brun et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2017; Berthier and Brun, 2019). 
This anomalous behavior has been related to speciﬁc mechanisms 
countering the effects of atmospheric warming, for example, an 
increase in cloudiness (Bashir et al., 2017) and snowfall (Kapnick 
et al., 2014) spatially heterogeneous glacier mass balance sensitivity 
(Sakai and Fujita, 2017), feedbacks due to intensiﬁed lowland 
irrigation (de Kok et al., 2018), and changes in summer atmospheric 
circulation (Forsythe et al., 2017).
There is medium evidence (high agreement) that recent glacier mass 
changes have modiﬁed glacier ﬂow. A study covering all glaciers 
in High Mountain Asia showed glacier slowdown for regions with 
negative mass budgets since the 1970s and slightly accelerated 
glacier ﬂow for Karakoram and West Kunlun regions where mass 
budgets were close to balance (Dehecq et al., 2019). Waechter et al. 
(2015) report reduced ﬂow velocities in the St. Elias Mountains in 
North America, especially in areas of rapid ice thinning near glacier

termini. In contrast Mouginot and Rignot (2015) found complex 
ice ﬂow patterns with simultaneous acceleration and deceleration 
for glaciers of the Patagonian Iceﬁeld as well as large interannual 
variability during the last three decades concurrent with general 
thinning of the ice ﬁeld.
Cross-Chapter Box 6 |  Glacier Projections in Polar and High Mountain Regions
Authors: Regine Hock (USA), Andrew Mackintosh (Australia/New Zealand), Ben Marzeion (Germany)
Century-scale projections for all glaciers on Earth including those around the periphery of Greenland and Antarctica are presented here. 
Projections of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are presented in Chapter 4. Future changes in glacier mass have global implications 
through their contribution to sea level change (Chapter 4) and local implication, for example, by affecting freshwater resources (Section 2.3.1). 
Glacier decline can also lead to loss of palaeoclimate information contained in glacier ice (Thompson et al., 2017).
AR5 included projections of 21st century glacier evolution from four process-based global-scale glacier models (Slangen and Van 
De Wal, 2011; Marzeion et al., 2012; Giesen and Oerlemans, 2013; Radić et al., 2014). Results have since been updated (Bliss et al., 
2014; Slangen et al., 2017; Hock et al., 2019) using new glacier inventory data and/or climate projections, and projections from two 
additional models have been presented (Hirabayashi et al., 2013; Huss and Hock, 2015). These six models were driven by climate 
projections from 8–21 General Circulation Models (GCMs) from the CMIP5 (Taylor et al., 2012) forced by various RCPs, and results are 
systematically compared in Hock et al. (2019).
Based on these studies there is high conﬁdence that glaciers in polar and high mountain regions will lose substantial mass by the 
end of the century. Results indicate global glacier mass losses by 2100 relative to 2015 of 18% (likely range 11–25%) (mean of 
all projections with range referring to ± one standard deviation) for scenario RCP2.6 and 36% (likely range 26–47%) for RCP8.5, 
but relative mass reductions vary greatly between regions (Figure CB6.1). Projected end-of-century mean mass losses relative to 
2015 tend to be largest in mountain regions dominated by smaller glaciers and relatively little ice cover, exceeding on average 
80%, for example, the European Alps, Pyrenees, Caucasus/Middle East, Low Latitudes and North Asia for RCP8.5 (see Figure 2.1 for 
region deﬁnitions). While these glaciers’ contribution to sea level is negligible their large relative mass losses have implications for 
streamﬂow (Section 2.3.1, FAQ 2.1).
The magnitude and timing of these projected mass losses is assigned medium conﬁdence because the projections have been 
carried out using relatively simple models calibrated with limited observations in some regions and diverging initial glacier volumes. 
For example, mass loss by iceberg calving and subaqueous melt processes that can be particularly important components of glacier 
mass budgets in polar regions (McNabb et al., 2015) have only been included in one global-scale study (Huss and Hock, 2015).  
In  addition instability mechanisms that can cause rapid glacier retreat and mass loss are not considered (Dunse et al., 2015; 
Sevestre et al., 2018; Willis et al., 2018).
The projected global-scale relative mass losses 2015–2100 correspond to a sea level contribution of 94 (likely range 69–119) mm sea 
level equivalent (SLE) corresponding to an average rate of 1.1 (likely range 0.8–1.4) mm SLE yr–1 for RCP2.6, and 200 (likely range 
156 to 240) mm SLE, a rate of 2.4 (likely range 1.8–2.8) mm SLE yr–1 for RCP8.5, in addition to the sea level contribution from the 
Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets (Chapter 4). Averages refer to the mean and ranges to ± one standard deviation of all simulations. 
For RCP2.6, rates increase only slightly until approximately year 2040 with a steady decline thereafter, as glaciers retreat to higher 
elevations and reach new equilibrium. In contrast, for RCP8.5, the sea level contribution from glaciers increases steadily for most of 
the century, reaching an average maximum rate exceeding 3 mm SLE yr–1 (Hock et al., 2019). For both RCPs the polar regions are the 
largest contributors with projected mass reductions by 2100 relative to 2015 combined for the Antarctic periphery, Arctic Canada, the 
Greenland periphery, Iceland, Russian Arctic, Scandinavia and Svalbard ranging from 16% (likely range 9 to 23%) for RCP2.6 to 33% 
(likely range 22 to 44%) for RCP8.5. Due to extensive ice cover, these regions make up roughly 80% of the global sea level contribution 
from glaciers by 2100. The global projections are similar to those reported in AR5 for the period 2081–2100 relative to 1986–2005, 
if differences in period length and domain are accounted for (AR5’s glacier estimates excluded the Antarctic periphery). The eleven 
mountain regions covered in Chapter 2 are likely to lose 22–44% of their glacier mass by 2100 relative to 2015 for RCP2.6 and 
37–57% for RCP8.5. Worldwide many glaciers are expected to disappear by 2100 regardless emission scenario, especially in regions 
with smaller glaciers (very high conﬁdence) (Cullen et al. 2013; Rabatel et al., 2013; Huss and Fischer, 2016; Rabatel et al., 2017).

The global-scale projections (Figure CB6.1) are consistent with results from regional-scale studies using more sophisticated models. 
Kraaijenbrink et al. (2017) projected mass losses for all glaciers in High Mountain Asia of 64 ± 5% (RCP8.5) by the end of the century 
(2071–2100) compared to 1996–2015. A high-resolution regional glaciation model including ice dynamics indicated that by 2100 
glacier volume in western Canada will shrink by ~70% (RCP2.6) to ~90% (RCP8.5) relative to 2005 (Clarke et al., 2015). Zekollari 
et al. (2019) projected that the glaciers in the European Alps will largely disappear by 2100 (94 ± 4% mass loss relative to 2017) for 
RCP8.5, while projected mass losses are 63 ± 11% for RCP2.6.
AR5 concluded with high conﬁdence that due to a pronounced imbalance between current glacier mass and climate, glaciers are 
expected to further recede even in the absence of further climate change. Studies since AR5 agree and provide further evidence 
(Mernild et al., 2013; Marzeion et al., 2018).

2.2.4 
Permafrost
This section assesses permafrost, but not seasonally frozen ground, 
in high mountain areas. As mountains also exist in polar areas, some 
overlap exists between this section and Chapter 3. Observations of 
permafrost are scarce (Tables 2.1 and 2.2, PERMOS, 2016; Bolch et al., 
2018) and unevenly distributed among and within mountain regions. 
Unlike glaciers and snow, permafrost is a subsurface phenomenon 
that cannot easily be observed remotely. As a  consequence, its 
distribution and change are less understood than for glaciers or 
snow, and in many mountain regions it can only be inferred (Gruber 
et al., 2017). Permafrost thaw and degradation impact people via 
runoff and water quality (Section 2.3.1), hazards and infrastructure 
(Section 2.3.2) and greenhouse gas emissions (Box 2.2).
AR5 and IPCC’s Special Report on ‘Managing the Risks of Extreme 
Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation’ 
(SREX) assessed permafrost change globally, but not separately 
for mountains. AR5 concluded that permafrost temperatures had 
increased in most regions since the early 1980s (high conﬁdence), 
although warming rates varied regionally, and attributed this 
warming to increased air temperature and changes in snow cover 
(high conﬁdence). The temperature increase for colder permafrost 
was generally greater than for warmer permafrost (high conﬁdence). 
SREX found a likely warming of permafrost in recent decades and 
expressed high conﬁdence that its temperatures will continue to 
increase. AR5 found decreases of northern high-latitude near surface 
permafrost for 2016–2035 to be very likely and a general retreat of 
permafrost extent for the end of the 21st century and beyond to be 
virtually certain. While some permafrost phenomena, methods of 
observation and scale issues in scenario simulations are speciﬁc to 
mountainous terrain, the basic mechanisms connecting climate and 
permafrost are the same in mountains and polar regions.
Between 3.6–5.2  million km2 are underlain by permafrost in the 
eleven high mountain regions outlined in Figure  2.1 (medium 
conﬁdence) based on data from two modelling studies (Gruber, 2012; 
Obu et al., 2019). For comparison, this is 14–21 times the area of 
glaciers (Section 2.2.3) in these regions (Figure 2.1) or 27–29% of the 
global permafrost area. The distribution of permafrost in mountains 
is spatially highly heterogeneous, as shown in detailed regional 
modelling studies (Boeckli et al., 2012; Bonnaventure et al., 2012; 
Westermann et al., 2015; Azócar et al., 2017; Zou et al., 2017).
Permafrost in the European Alps, Scandinavia, Canada, Mongolia, the 
Tien Shan and the Tibetan Plateau has warmed during recent decades 
and some observations reveal ground-ice loss and permafrost 
degradation (high conﬁdence). The heterogeneity of mountain 
environments and scarcity of long-term observations challenge the 
quantiﬁcation of representative regional or global warming rates. 
A recent analysis ﬁnds that permafrost at 28 mountain locations in 
the European Alps, Scandinavia, Canada as well as High Mountain 
Asia and North Asia, warmed on average by 0.19 ± 0.05ºC per decade 
between 2007–2016 (Biskaborn et al., 2019). Over longer periods, 
observations in the European Alps, Scandinavia, Mongolia, the Tien 
Shan and the Tibetan Plateau (see also Cao et al., 2018) show general 
warming (Table 2.1, Figure 2.5) and degradation of permafrost at 
individual sites (e.g., Phillips et al., 2009). Permafrost close to 0ºC 
warms at a lower rate than colder permafrost because ground-ice 
melt slows warming. Similarly, bedrock warms faster than debris 
or soil because of low ice content. For example, several European 
bedrock sites (Table  2.1) have warmed rapidly, by up to 1ºC per 
decade, during the past two decades. By contrast, total warming of 
0.5ºC–0.8ºC has been inferred for the second half of the 20th century 
based on thermal gradients at depth in an ensemble of European 
bedrock sites (Isaksen et al., 2001; Harris et al., 2003). Warming has 
been shown to accelerate at sites in Scandinavia (Isaksen et al., 
2007) and in mountains globally within the past decade (Biskaborn 
et al., 2019). During recent decades, rates of permafrost warming in 
the European Alps and Scandinavia exceeded values of the late 20th 
century (limited evidence, high agreement).
The observed thickness of the active layer (see Annex I: Glossary), 
the layer of ground above permafrost subject to annual thawing and 
freezing, increased in the European Alps, Scandinavia (Christiansen 
et al., 2010), and on the Tibetan Plateau during the past few 
decades (Table 2.2), indicating permafrost degradation. Geophysical 
monitoring in the European Alps during approximately the past 
15 years revealed increasing subsurface liquid water content (Hilbich 
et al., 2008; Bodin et al., 2009; PERMOS, 2016), indicating gradual 
ground-ice loss.
During recent decades, the velocity of rock glaciers in the European 
Alps exceeded values of the late 20th century (limited evidence, high 
agreement). Some rock glaciers, that is, masses of ice-rich debris 
that show evidence of past or present movement, show increasing 
velocity as a transient response to warming and water input, although 
continued permafrost degradation would eventually inactivate them 
(Ikeda and Matsuoka, 2002). Rock glacier velocities observed in the 
European Alps in the 1990s were on the order of a few decimetres 
per year and during approximately the past 15 years they often 
were about 2–10 times higher (Bodin et al., 2009; Lugon and Stoffel, 
2010; PERMOS, 2016). Destabilisation, including collapse and rapid 
acceleration, has been documented (Delaloye et al., 2010; Buchli 
et al., 2013; Bodin et al., 2016). One particularly long time series 
shows velocities around 1960 just slightly lower than during recent 
years (Hartl et al., 2016). In contrast to nearby glaciers, no clear 
change in rock glacier velocity or elevation was detected at a site in 
the Andes between 1955–1996 (Bodin et al., 2010). The majority of 
similar landforms investigated in the Alaska Brooks Range increased 
their velocity since the 1950s, while few others slowed down (Darrow 
et al., 2016).
Decadal-scale permafrost warming and degradation are driven 
by air temperature increase and additionally affected by changes 
in snow cover, vegetation and soil moisture. Bedrock locations, 
especially when steep and free of snow, produce the most direct 
signal of climate change on the ground thermal regime (Smith and 
Riseborough, 1996), increasing the conﬁdence in attribution. Periods 
of cooling, one or few years long, have been observed and attributed 
to extraordinary low-snow conditions (PERMOS, 2016). Extreme 
increases of active-layer thickness often correspond with summer 
heat waves (PERMOS, 2016) and permafrost degradation can be 
accelerated by water percolation (Luethi et al., 2017). Similarity and

synchronicity of interannual to decadal velocity changes of rock 
glaciers within the European Alps (Bodin et al., 2009; Delaloye et al., 
2010) and the Tien Shan (Sorg et al., 2015), suggest common regional 
forcing such as summer air temperature or snow cover.
Because air temperature is the major driver of permafrost change, 
permafrost in high mountain regions is expected to undergo 
increasing thaw and degradation during the 21st century, with 
stronger consequences expected for higher greenhouse gas emission 
scenarios (very high conﬁdence). Scenario simulations for the Tibetan 
Plateau until 2100 estimate permafrost area to be strongly reduced, 
for example by 22–64% for RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 and a  spatial 
resolution of 0.5º (Lu et al., 2017). Such coarse-scale studies (Guo 
et al., 2012; Slater and Lawrence, 2013; Guo and Wang, 2016), 
however, are of limited use in quantifying changes and informing 
impact studies in steep terrain due to inadequate representation of 
topography (Fiddes and Gruber, 2012). Fine-scale simulations, on the 
other hand, are local or regional, limited in areal extent and differ 
widely in their representation of climate change and permafrost. 
They reveal regional and elevational differences of warming and 
degradation (Bonnaventure and Lewkowicz, 2011; Hipp et al., 2012; 
Farbrot et al., 2013) as well as warming rates that differ between 
locations (Marmy et al., 2016) and seasons (Marmy et al., 2013). 
While structural differences in simulations preclude a quantitative 
summary, these studies agree on increasing warming and thaw 
of permafrost for the 21st century and reveal increased loss of 
permafrost under stronger atmospheric warming (Chadburn et al., 
2017). Permafrost thaw at depth is slow but can be accelerated by 
mountain peaks warming from multiple sides (Noetzli and Gruber, 
2009) and deep percolation of water (Hasler et al., 2011). Near Mont 
Blanc in the European Alps, narrow peaks below 3,850 m a.s.l. may 
lose permafrost entirely under RCP8.5 by the end of the 21st century 
(Magnin et al., 2017). As ground-ice from permafrost usually melts 
slower than glacier ice, some mountain regions will transition from 
having abundant glaciers to having few and small glaciers but large 
areas of permafrost that is thawing (Haeberli et al., 2017).

Figure 2.5 |   Mean annual ground temperature from boreholes in debris and bedrock in 
the European Alps, Scandinavia and High Mountain Asia. Temperatures differ between 
locations and warming trends can be interspersed by short periods of cooling. One 
location shows degrading of permafrost. Overall, the number of observed boreholes is 
small and most records are short. The depth of measurements is approximately 10 m,

2.2.5 
Lake and River Ice
Based on limited evidence, AR5 reported shorter seasonal ice 
cover duration during the past decades (low conﬁdence), however, 
did not speciﬁcally address changes in mountain lakes and rivers. 
Observations of extent, timing, duration and thickness of lake and 
river ice rely mostly on in situ measurements (e.g., Sharma et al., 
2019) and, increasingly on remote sensing (Duguay et al., 2014). Lake 
and river ice studies focusing speciﬁcally on mountain regions are 
rare but observations from lakes in the European Alps, Scandinavia 
and the Tibetan Plateau show highly variable trends in ice cover 
duration during the past decades.
For example, Cai et al. (2019) reported shorter ice cover duration 
for 40 lakes and longer duration for 18 lakes on the Tibetan Plateau 
during the period 2000–2017. Similarly, using microwave remote 
sensing, Du et al. (2017) found shorter ice cover duration for 43 out 
of 71 lakes >50 km2 including lakes on the Tibetan Plateau during 
2002–2015, but only ﬁve of these had statistically signiﬁcant trends 
(p  <  0.05), due to large interannual variability. The variable trends in 
the duration of lake ice cover on the Tibetan Plateau between 2002–
2015 corresponded to variable trends in surface water temperatures. 
Of 52 study lakes in this region, 31 lakes showed a mean warming 
rate of 0.055 ± 0.033ºC yr–1, and 21 lakes showed a mean cooling 
rate of -0.053 ± 0.038ºC yr–1 during 2001–2012 (Zhang et al., 2014). 
Kainz et al. (2017) reported a signiﬁcant (p  <  0.05) increase in the 
interannual variability in ice cover duration for a subalpine lake 
in Austria during 1921–2015 in addition to a signiﬁcant trend in 
later freeze on, earlier ice break up and shorter ice cover duration. 
A signiﬁcant (p < 0.05) trend towards shorter ice cover duration was 
found for another Austrian alpine lake during 1972–2015 (Niedrist 
et al., 2018).
Highly variable trends were also found in the timing and magnitude 
of river ice jams during 1903–2015, as reported by Rokaya et al. 
(2018) for Canadian rivers, including rivers in the mountains. Most of 
the variability in river ice trends could be explained by variable water 
ﬂow, in particular due to ﬂow regulation.
There is high conﬁdence that air temperature and solar radiation are 
the most important drivers to explain observed changes of lake ice 
dynamics (Sharma et al., 2019). In mountainous regions where the 
interannual variability in ice cover duration is high, additional drivers 
become important, for example, morphometry, wind exposure, 
salinity, and hydrology, in particular hydrological processes driven by 
glaciers (Kropácek et al., 2013; Song et al., 2014; Yao et al., 2016; Gou 
et al., 2017). Despite high spatial and temporal variability in lake and 
river ice cover dynamics in mountain regions there is limited evidence 
(high agreement) that further air temperature increases will result in 
a general trend towards later freezing, earlier break-up, and shorter 
ice cover duration in the future (Gebre et al., 2014; Du et al., 2017).
Overall, there is only limited evidence on changes in lake and river ice 
speciﬁcally in the mountains, indicating a trend, but not universally, 
towards shorter lake ice cover duration consistent with increased 
water temperature.

Mountain Social-Ecological Systems: 
Impacts, Risks and Human Responses
2.3.1 
Water Resources
The mountain cryosphere is an important source of freshwater in 
the mountains themselves and in downstream regions. The runoff 
per unit area generated in mountains is on average approximately 
twice as high as in lowlands (Viviroli et al., 2011) making mountains 
a signiﬁcant source of fresh water in sustaining ecosystem and 
supporting livelihoods in and far beyond the mountain ranges 
themselves. The presence of snow, glaciers, and permafrost generally 
exert a strong control on the amount, timing and biogeochemical 
properties of runoff (FAQ 2.1). Changes to the cryosphere due 
to climate change can alter freshwater availability with direct 
consequences for human populations and ecosystems.
2.3.1.1 
Changes in River Runoff
AR5 reported increased winter ﬂows and a shift in timing towards 
earlier spring snowmelt runoff peaks during previous decades (robust 
evidence, high agreement). In glacier-fed river basins, it was projected 
that melt water yields from glaciers will increase for decades in many 
regions but then decline (very high conﬁdence). These ﬁndings have 
been further supported and reﬁned by a wealth of new studies 
since AR5.
Recent studies indicate considerable changes in the seasonality 
of runoff in snow and glacier dominated river basins (very high 
conﬁdence; Table SM2.9). Several studies have reported an increase 
in average winter runoff over the past decades, for example in 
Western Canada (Moyer et al., 2016), the European Alps (Bocchiola, 
2014; Bard et al., 2015) and Norway (Fleming and Dahlke, 2014), 
Box 2.2 |  Local, Regional and Global Climate Feedbacks Involving the Mountain Cryosphere
The cryosphere interacts with the environment and contributes to several climate feedbacks, most notably ones involving 
the snow cover, referred to as the snow albedo feedback. The presence or absence of snow on the ground drives profound changes in 
the energy budget of land surfaces, hence inﬂuencing the physical state of the overlying atmosphere (Armstrong and Brun, 2008). 
The reduction of snow on the ground, potentially ampliﬁed by aerosol deposition and modulated by interactions with the vegetation, 
increases the absorption of incoming solar radiation and leads to atmospheric warming. In mountain regions, this positive feedback 
loop mostly operates at the local scale and is seasonally variable, with most visible effects at the beginning and end of the snow 
season (Scherrer et al., 2012). Examples of other mechanisms contributing to local feedbacks are introduced in Box 2.1. At the regional 
scale, feedbacks associated with deposition of light absorbing particles and enhanced snow albedo feedback were shown to induce 
surface air warming (locally up to 2ºC) (Ménégoz et al., 2014) with accelerated snow cover reduction (Ji, 2016; Xu et al., 2016), and 
may also inﬂuence the Asian monsoon system (Yasunari et al., 2015). However, many of these studies have considered so-called 
rapid adjustments, without changes in large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns, because they used regional or global models 
constrained by large-scale synoptic ﬁelds. In summary, regional climate feedbacks involving the high mountain cryosphere, particularly 
the snow albedo feedback, have only been detected in large mountain regions such as the Himalaya, using global and regional climate 
models (medium conﬁdence).
Global-scale climate feedbacks from the cryosphere remain largely unexplored with respect to the proportion originating from 
high mountains. Although mountain topography affects global climate (e.g.,  Naiman et al., 2017), there is little evidence for 
mountain-cryosphere speciﬁc feedbacks, largely because of the limited spatial extent of the mountain cryosphere. The most relevant 
feedback probably relates to permafrost in mountains, which contain about 28% of the global permafrost area (Section 2.2.4). Organic 
carbon stored in permafrost can be decayed following thaw and transferred to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide or methane (Schuur 
et al., 2015). This self-reinforcing effect accelerates the pace of climate change and operates in polar (Section 3.4.1.2.3) and mountain 
areas alike (Mu et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2018a). In contrast to polar areas, however, there is limited evidence and low agreement on 
the total amount of permafrost carbon in mountains because of differences in upscaling and difﬁculties to distinguish permafrost 
and seasonally frozen soils due to the lack of data. For example, on the Tibetan Plateau, the top 3 m of permafrost are estimated to 
contain about 15 petagrams (Ding et al., 2016) and mountain soils with permafrost globally are estimated to contain approximately 
66 petagrams of organic carbon (Bockheim and Munroe, 2014). At the same time, there is limited evidence and high agreement that 
the average density (kg C m–2) of permafrost carbon in mountains is lower than in other areas. For example, densities of soil organic 
carbon are low in the sub-arctic Ural (Dymov et al., 2015) and 1–2 orders of magnitude lower in subarctic Sweden (Fuchs et al., 
2015) in comparison to lowland permafrost, and 50% lower in mountains than in steppe-tundra in Siberia and Alaska (Zimov et al., 
2006). Some mechanisms of soil carbon decay and transfer to the atmosphere in mountains are similar to those in lowland areas, for 
example collapse following thaw in peatlands (Mu et al., 2016; Mamet et al., 2017), and some are speciﬁc to areas with steep slopes, 
for example drainage of water from thawing permafrost leading to soil aeration (Dymov et al., 2015). There is no global-scale analysis 
of the climate feedback from permafrost in mountains. Given that projections indicate increasing thaw and degradation of permafrost 
in mountains during the 21st century (very high conﬁdence) (Section 2.2.4), a corresponding increase in greenhouse gas emissions 
can be anticipated but is not quantiﬁed.

due to more precipitation falling as rain under warmer conditions. 
Summer runoff has been observed to decrease in basins, for example 
in Western Canada (Brahney et al., 2017) and the European Alps 
(Bocchiola, 2014), but to increase in several basins in High Mountain 
Asia (Mukhopadhyay and Khan, 2014; Duethmann et al., 2015; 
Reggiani and Rientjes, 2015; Engelhardt et al., 2017). Both increases, 
for example, in Alaska (Beamer et al., 2016) and the Tien Shan (Wang 
et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2016), and decreases, for example, in Western 
Canada (Brahney et al., 2017) have also been found for average 
annual runoff. In Western Austria, Kormann et al. (2015) detected an 
increase in annual ﬂow at high elevations and a decrease at low 
elevations between 1980–2010.
These contrasting trends for summer and annual runoff often result 
from spatially variable changes in the contribution of glacier and 
snow melt. As glaciers shrink, annual glacier runoff typically ﬁrst 
increases, until a turning point, often called ‘peak water’ is reached, 
upon which runoff declines (FAQ 2.1). There is robust evidence and 
high agreement that peak water in glacier-fed rivers has already 
passed with annual runoff declining especially in mountain regions 
with predominantly smaller glaciers, for example, in the tropical 
Andes (Frans et al., 2015; Polk et al., 2017), Western Canada (Fleming 
and Dahlke, 2014; Brahney et al., 2017) and the Swiss Alps (Huss 
and Fischer, 2016). A global modelling study (Huss and Hock, 2018) 
suggests that peak water has been reached before 2019 for 82–95% 
of the glacier area in the tropical Andes, 40–49% in Western Canada 
and USA, and 55–67% in Central Europe (including European Alps 
and Pyrenees) and the Caucasus (Figure 2.6).
Projections indicate a continued increase in winter runoff in many 
snow and/or glacier-fed rivers over the 21st century (high conﬁdence) 
regardless of the climate scenario, for example, in North America 
(Schnorbus et al., 2014; Sultana and Choi, 2018), the European Alps 
(Addor et al., 2014; Bosshard et al., 2014), Scotland (Capell et al., 
2014) and High Mountain Asia (Kriegel et al., 2013) due to increased 
winter snowmelt and more precipitation falling as rain in addition to 
increases in precipitation in some basins (Table SM2.9). There is robust 
evidence (high agreement) that summer runoff will decline over the 
21st century in many basins for all emission scenarios, for example, 
in Western Canada and USA (Shrestha et al., 2017), the European 
Alps (Jenicek et al., 2018), High Mountain Asia (Prasch et al., 2013; 
Engelhardt et al., 2017) and the tropical Andes (Baraer et al., 2012), 
due to less snowfall and decreases in glacier melt after peak water. 
A global-scale projection suggests that decline in glacier runoff by 
2100 (RCP8.5) may reduce basin runoff by 10% or more in at least 
one month of the melt season in several large river basins, especially 
in High Mountain Asia during dry seasons, despite glacier cover of 
less than a few percent (Huss and Hock, 2018).
Projected changes in annual runoff in glacier dominated basins are 
complex including increases and decreases over the 21st century 
for all scenarios depending on the time period and the timing of 
peak water (high conﬁdence) (Figure 2.6). Local and regional-scale 
projections in High Mountain Asia, the European Alps, and Western 
Canada and USA suggest that peak water will generally be reached 
before or around the middle of the century. These ﬁnding are 
consistent with results from global-scale modelling of glacier runoff 
(Bliss et al., 2014; Huss and Hock, 2018) indicating generally earlier 
peak water in regions with little ice cover and smaller glaciers 
(e.g., Low Latitudes, European Alps and Pyrenees, and the Caucasus) 
and later peak water in regions with extensive ice cover and large 
glaciers (e.g., Alaska, Southern Andes). In some regions (e.g., Iceland) 
peak water from most glacier area is projected to occur earlier for 
RCP2.6 than RCP8.5, caused by decreasing glacier runoff as glaciers 
ﬁnd a new equilibrium. In contrast melt-driven glacier runoff 
continues to rise for the higher emission scenario. There is very high 
conﬁdence that spring peak runoff in many snow-dominated basins 
around the world will occur earlier in the year, up to several weeks, 
by the end of the century caused by earlier snowmelt (e.g., Coppola 
et al., 2014; Bard et al., 2015; Yucel et al., 2015; Islam et al., 2017; 
Sultana and Choi, 2018). 
In addition to changes in ice and snow melt, changes in other 
variables such as precipitation and evapotranspiration due to 
atmospheric warming or vegetation change affect runoff amounts 
and timing (e.g., Bocchiola, 2014; Lutz et al., 2016). Changes in melt 
water from ice and snow often dominates the runoff response to 
climate change at higher elevations, while changes in precipitation 
and evapotranspiration become increasingly important at lower 
elevations (Kormann et al., 2015). Permafrost thaw may affect runoff 
by releasing water from ground ice (Jones et al., 2018) and indirectly 
by changing hydrological pathways or ground water recharge as 
permafrost degrades (Lamontagne-Hallé et al., 2018). The relative 
importance of runoff from thawing permafrost compared to runoff 
from melting glaciers is expected to be greatest in arid areas where 
permafrost tends to be more abundant (Gruber et al., 2017). Because 
glaciers react more rapidly to climate change than permafrost, runoff 
in some mountain landscapes may become increasingly affected by 
permafrost thaw in the future (Jones et al., 2018).
In summary, there is very high conﬁdence that glacier and snow 
cover decline have affected and will continue to change the amounts 
and seasonality of river runoff in many snow-dominated and/or 
glacier-fed river basins. The average winter runoff is expected to 
increase (high conﬁdence), and spring peak maxima will occur earlier 
(very high conﬁdence). Although observed and projected trends 
in annual runoff vary substantially among regions and can even 
be opposite in sign, there is high conﬁdence that average annual 
runoff from glaciers will have reached a peak, with declining runoff 
thereafter, at the latest by the end of the 21st century in all regions 
regardless emission scenario. The projected changes in runoff are 
expected to affect downstream water management, related hazards 
and ecosystems (Section 2.3.2, 2.3.3).

Figure 2.6 |   Timing of peak water from glaciers in different regions (Figure 2.1) under two emission scenarios for Representative Concentration Pathways RCP2.6 and 
RCP8.5. Peak water refers to the year when annual runoff from the initially glacier-covered area will start to decrease due to glacier shrinkage after a period of melt induced 
increase. The bars are based on Huss and Hock (2018) who used a global glacier model to compute the runoff of all individual glaciers in a region until year 2100 based on 
14 General Circulation Models (GCMs). Depicted is the area of all glaciers that fall into the same 10-year peak water interval expressed as a percentage of each region’s 
total glacier area, i.e., all bars for the same RCP sum up to 100% glacier area. Shadings of the bars distinguish different glacier sizes indicating a tendency for peak water 
to occur later for larger glaciers. Circles/diamonds mark timing of peak water from individual case studies based on observations or modelling (Table SM2.10). Circles refer 
to results from individual glaciers regardless of size or a collection of glaciers covering <150 km2 in total, while diamonds refer to regional-scale results from a collection of 
glaciers with >150 km2 glacier coverage. Case studies based on observations or scenarios other than RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 are shown in both the left and right set of panels.

Frequently Asked Questions
FAQ 2.1 | 
How does glacier shrinkage affect river runoff further downhill?
Glaciers supply water that supports human communities both close to the glacier and far away from the glacier, for example 
for agriculture or drinking water. Rising temperatures cause mountain glaciers to melt and change the water availability. At 
ﬁrst, as the glacier melts, more water runs downhill away from the glacier. However, as the glacier shrinks, the water supply 
will diminish and farms, villages and cities might lose a valuable water source. 
Melting glaciers can affect river runoff, and thus freshwater resources available to human communities, not only 
close to the glacier but also far from mountain areas. As glaciers shrink in response to a warmer climate, water 
is released from long-term glacial storage. At ﬁrst, glacier runoff increases because the glacier melts faster and 
more water ﬂows downhill from the glacier. However, there will be a turning point after several years or decades, 
often called ‘peak water’, after which glacier runoff and hence its contribution to river ﬂow downstream will 
decline (FAQ 2.1; Figure 1). Peak water runoff from glaciers can exceed the amount of initial yearly runoff by 
50% or more. This excess water can be used in different ways, such as for hydropower or irrigation. After the 
turning point, this additional water decreases steadily as the glacier continues to shrink, and eventually stops 
when the glacier has disappeared, or retreated to higher elevations where it is still cold enough for the glacier 
to survive. As a result, communities downstream lose this valuable additional source of water. Total amounts of 
river runoff will then depend mainly on rainfall, snowmelt, ground water and evaporation.
Furthermore, glacier decline can change the timing in the year and day when the most water is available in 
rivers that collect water from glaciers. In mid- or high latitudes, glacier runoff is greatest in the summer, when 
the glacier ice continues to melt after the winter snow has disappeared, and greatest during the day when air 
temperature and solar radiation are at their highest (FAQ 2.1, Figure 1). As peak water occurs, more intense 
glacier melt rates also increase these daily runoff maxima signiﬁcantly. In tropical areas, such as parts of the 
Andes, seasonal air temperature variations are small, and alternating wet and dry seasons are the main control 
on the amount and timing of glacier runoff throughout the year.
The effects of glaciers on river runoff further downhill depend on the distance from the glacier. Close to the 
glaciers (e.g., within several kilometres), initial increases in yearly glacier runoff until peak water followed by 
decreases can affect water supply considerably, and larger peaks in daily runoff from the glaciers can cause 
ﬂoods. Further away from the glaciers the impact of glacier shrinkage on total river runoff tends to become 
small or negligible. However, the melt water from glaciers in the mountains can be an important source of water 
in hot and dry years or seasons when river runoff would otherwise be low, and thereby also reducing variability 
in total river runoff from year to year, even hundreds of kilometres away from the glaciers. Other components 
of the water cycle such as rainfall, evaporation, groundwater and snowmelt can compensate or strengthen the 
effects of changes in glacier runoff as the climate changes.

2.3.1.2 
Water Quality
Glacier decline can inﬂuence water quality by accelerating the release 
of stored anthropogenic legacy pollutants, with impacts to downstream 
ecosystem services. These legacy pollutants notably include persistent 
organic pollutants (POPs), particularly polychlorinated biphenyls 
(PCBs) and dichlorodiphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT), polycyclic 
aromatic hydrocarbons, and heavy metals (Hodson, 2014) and are 
associated with the deposition and release of black carbon. There is 
limited evidence that some of these pollutants found in surface waters 
in the Gangetic Plain during the dry season originate from Himalayan 
glaciers (Sharma et al., 2015), and glaciers in the European Alps store 
the largest known quantity of POPs in the Northern Hemisphere 
(Milner et al., 2017). Although their use has declined or ceased 
FAQ 2.1, Figure 1 |   A simpliﬁed overview of changes in runoff from a river basin with large (e.g., >50%) glacier cover as the glaciers shrink, showing the 
relative amounts of water from different sources – glaciers, snow (outside the glacier), rain and groundwater. Three different time scales are shown: annual 
runoff from the entire basin (upper panel); runoff variations over one year (middle panel) and variations during a sunny then a rainy summer day (lower panel). 
Note that seasonal and daily runoff variations are different before, during and after peak ﬂow. The glacier’s initial negative annual mass budget becomes more 
negative over time until eventually the glacier has melted away. This is a simpliﬁed ﬁgure so permafrost is not addressed speciﬁcally and the exact partitioning 
between the different sources of water will vary between river basins.

worldwide, PCBs have been detected in runoff from glacier melt due 
to the lag time of release from glaciers (Li et al., 2017). Glaciers also 
represent the most unstable stores of DDT in European and other 
mountain areas ﬂanking large urban centres and glacier derived DDT 
is still accumulating in lake sediments downstream from glaciers 
(Bogdal et al., 2010). However, bioﬂocculation (the aggregation of 
dispersed organic particles by the action of organisms) can increase 
the residence time of these contaminants stored in glaciers thereby 
reducing their overall toxicity to freshwater ecosystems (Langford 
et al., 2010). Overall the effect on freshwater ecosystems of these 
contaminants is estimated to be low (medium conﬁdence) (Milner 
et al., 2017).
Of the heavy metals, mercury is of particular concern and an estimated 
2.5 tonnes has been released by glaciers to downstream ecosystems 
across the Tibetan Plateau over the last 40 years (Zhang et al., 2012). 
Mercury in glacial silt, originating from grinding of rocks as the 
glacier ﬂows over them, can be as large or larger than the mercury 
ﬂux from melting ice due to anthropogenic sources deposited on the 
glacier (Zdanowicz et al., 2013). Both glacier erosion and atmospheric 
deposition contributed to the high rates of total mercury export found 
in a glacierised watershed in coastal Alaska (Vermilyea et al., 2017) 
and mercury output is predicted to increase in glacierised mountain 
catchments (Sun et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2018b) (medium conﬁdence). 
However, a key issue is how much of this glacier-derived mercury, 
largely in the particulate form, is converted to toxic methyl mercury 
downstream. Methyl mercury can be incorporated into aquatic food 
webs in glacier streams (Nagorski et al., 2014) and bio-magnify up 
the food chain (Lavoie et al., 2013). Water originating from rock 
glaciers can also contribute other heavy metals that exceed guideline 
values for drinking water quality (Thies et al., 2013). In addition, 
permafrost degradation can enhance the release of other trace 
elements (e.g., aluminium, manganese and nickel) (Colombo et al., 
2018). Indeed, projections indicate that all scenarios of future climate 
change will enhance the mobilisation of metals in metamorphic 
mountain catchments (Zaharescu et al., 2016). The release of toxic 
contaminants, particularly where glacial melt waters are used for 
irrigation and drinking water in the Himalayas and the Andes, is 
potentially harmful to human health both now and in the future 
(Hodson, 2014) (medium conﬁdence).
Soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations in rivers downstream of 
glaciers are predicted to decrease with declining glacier coverage (Hood 
et al., 2009) as a large percentage is associated with glacier-derived 
suspended sediment (Hawkings et al., 2016). In contrast, dissolved 
organic carbon (DOC), dissolved inorganic nitrogen and dissolved 
organic nitrogen concentrations in pro-glacial rivers is projected to 
increase this century due to glacier shrinkage (Hood et al., 2015; 
Milner et al., 2017) (robust evidence, medium agreement). Globally, 
mountain glaciers are estimated to release about 0.8 Tera g C yr–1 
(Li et al., 2018) of highly bioavailable DOC that may be incorporated 
into downstream food webs (Fellman et al., 2015; Hood et al., 2015). 
Loss rates of DOC from glaciers in the high mountains of the Tibetan 
Plateau were estimated to be ~0.19 Tera g C yr–1, (Li et al., 2018) 
higher than other regions suggesting that DOC is released more 
efﬁciently from Asian mountain glaciers (Liu et al., 2016). Glacier 
DOC losses are expected to accelerate as they shrink, leading to 
a cumulative annual loss of roughly 15 Tera g C yr–1 of glacial DOC 
by 2050 from melting glaciers and ice sheets (Hood et al., 2015). 
Permafrost degradation is also a major and increasing source of 
bioavailable DOC (Abbott et al., 2014; Aiken et al., 2014). Major ions 
calcium, magnesium, sulphate and nitrate (Colombo et al., 2018) are 
also released by permafrost degradation as well as acid drainage 
leaching into alpine lakes (Ilyashuk et al., 2018).
Increasing water temperature has been reported in some high 
mountain streams (e.g., Groll et al., 2015; Isaak et al., 2016) due to 
decreases in glacial runoff, producing changes in water quality and 
species richness (Section  2.3.3). In contrast, water temperature in 
regions with extensive glacier cover are expected to show a transient 
decline, due to an enhanced cooling effect from increased glacial 
melt water (Fellman et al., 2014). 
In summary, changes in the mountain cryosphere will cause signiﬁcant 
shifts in downstream nutrients (DOC, nitrogen, phosphorus) and 
inﬂuence water quality through increases in heavy metals, particularly 
mercury, and other legacy contaminants (medium evidence, high 
agreement) posing a potential threat to human health. These threats 
are more focused where glaciers are subject to substantial pollutant 
loads such as High Mountain Asia and Europe, rather than areas like 
Alaska and Canada.
2.3.1.3 
Key Impacts and Vulnerability 
2.3.1.3.1 Hydropower
Hydropower comprises about 16% of electricity generation globally 
but close to 100%, in many mountainous countries (Hamududu 
and Killingtveit, 2012; IHA, 2018). It represents a signiﬁcant source 
of revenue for mountainous regions (Gaudard et al., 2016). Due 
to the dependence on water resources as key input, hydropower 
operations are expected to be affected by changes in runoff from 
glaciers and snow cover (Section 2.3.1.1, FAQ 2.1). Both increases 
and decreases in annual and/or seasonal water input to hydropower 
facilities have been recorded in several high mountain regions, for 
example, in Switzerland (Hänggi and Weingartner, 2012; Schaeﬂi 
et al., 2019), Canada (Jost et al., 2012; Jost and Weber, 2013), Iceland 
(Einarsson and Jónsson, 2010) and High Mountain Asia (Ali et al., 
2018). However, there is only limited evidence (medium agreement) 
that changes in runoff have led to changes in hydropower plant 
operation. For example, in Iceland, the National Power Company 
observed in 2005 that ﬂows into their energy system were greater 
than historical ﬂows. By incorporating the most recent runoff data 
into strategies for reservoir management it was possible to increase 
production capacity (Braun and Fournier, 2016).
There is robust evidence (medium agreement) that water input to 
hydropower facilities will change in the future due to cryosphere-related 
impacts on runoff (Section 2.3.1.1). For example, in the Skagit river 
basin in British Columbia and Northern Washington (Lee et al., 2016) 
and in California (Madani and Lund, 2010) projections (SRES A1B) show 
more runoff in winter and less in summer. In India, snow and glacier 
runoff to hydropower plants is projected to decline in several basins 
(Ali et al., 2018). In some cases, catchments that are close together 
154
Chapter 2 
High Mountain Areas
2
are projected to evolve in contrasting directions in terms of runoff, 
for example in the European Alps (Gaudard et al., 2013; Gaudard 
et al., 2014). Increased runoff due to changes in the cryosphere will 
increase the risk of overﬂows (non-productive discharge), particularly 
during winter and spring melt, with the greatest impacts on run-of-
river power plants (e.g., in Canada; Minville et al., 2010; Warren and 
Lemmen, 2014) (medium conﬁdence).
There is medium evidence (high agreement) that changes in glacier- 
and moraine-dammed lakes, and changes in sediment supply will 
affect hydropower generation (Colonia et al., 2017; Hauer et al., 
2018). Many glacier lakes have increased in volume, and can damage 
hydropower infrastructure when they empty suddenly (Engeset 
et al., 2005; Jackson and Ragulina, 2014; Carrivick and Tweed, 2016) 
(Section 2.3.2; Figure 2.7). If large enough, hydropower reservoirs 
can reduce the downstream negative impacts of changes in the 
cryosphere by storing and providing freshwater during hot, dry 
periods or by alleviating the effects of glacier ﬂoods (Jackson and 
Ragulina, 2014; Colonia et al., 2017). In mountain rivers, sediment 
volume and type depend on connectivity between hillslopes and the 
valley ﬂoor (Carrivick et al., 2013), glacier activity (Lane et al., 2017) 
and on water runoff regime feedbacks with river channel dynamics 
(Schmidt and Morche, 2006). An increase in suspended sediment 
loading under current reservoir operating policies is projected for 
some hydropower facilities, for example, in British Columbia and 
Northern Washington (Lee et al., 2016). 
Only a few studies have addressed the economic effects on 
hydropower due directly to changes in the cryosphere. For example 
in Peru, Vergara et al. (2007) studied the effect of both reduced 
glacier runoff and runoff with no glacier input once the glaciers 
have completely melted for the Cañón del Pato hydropower plant in 
Peru, and found an economic cost of between 5–20 million USD yr–1, 
with the lower ﬁgure for the cost of energy paid to the producer 
and the higher ﬁgure the society cost. Costs calculated for all of 
Peru, where ~80% of electricity comes from hydropower range from 
60–212 million USD yr–1. If the cost of rationing energy is considered, 
the national cost is estimated as 1,500 million USD yr–1.
Other factors than changes in the cryosphere, such as market policies 
and regulation, may have greater signiﬁcance for socioeconomic 
development of hydropower in the future (Section 2.3.1.4, Gaudard 
et al., 2016). Hence, despite the efforts of hydropower agencies 
and regulatory bodies to quantify changes or to develop possible 
adaptation strategies (IHA, 2018), only a few organisations are 
incorporating current knowledge of climate change into their 
investment planning. The World Bank uses a decision tree approach 
to identify potential vulnerabilities in a hydropower project incurred 
from key uncertain factors and their combinations (Bonzanigo 
et al., 2015).
2.3.1.3.2 Agriculture
High mountains have supported agricultural livelihoods for centuries. 
Rural communities are dependent on adequate levels of soil moisture 
at planting time, derived in part in many cases from irrigation 
water which includes glacier and snowmelt water; as a result, they 
are exposed to risk which stems from cryosphere changes (high 
conﬁdence) (Figure  2.8). The relative poverty of many mountain 
communities contributes to their vulnerability to the impacts of these 
cryosphere changes (McDowell et al., 2014; Carey et al., 2017; Rasul 
and Molden, 2019) (medium evidence, high agreement). Glacier and 
snowmelt water contribute irrigation water to adjacent lowlands 
as well. Pastoralism, an important livelihood strategy in mountain 
regions, is also impacted by cryosphere changes, but described in 
Section 2.3.7.
There is medium evidence (medium agreement) that reduction in 
streamﬂow due to glacier retreat or reduced snow cover has led 
to reduced water availability for irrigation of crops and declining 
agricultural yields in several mountain areas (Table SM2.11), for 
example in the tropical Andes (e.g.,  Bury et al., 2011) and High 
Mountain Asia (e.g., Nüsser and Schmidt, 2017). In the Southern 
Andes, increased streamﬂow in the Elqui River in Chile, due to glacier 
retreat or changing snow cover, has led to increased water availability 
for irrigation and increased agricultural yields (Young et al., 2010).
In addition to the effects on agriculture of changing availability of 
irrigation water, reductions in snow cover can also impact agriculture 
through its direct effects on soil moisture, as reported for Nepal, 
where lesser snow cover has led to the drying of soils and lower 
yields of potatoes and fodder (Smadja et al., 2015). Agriculture in high 
mountain areas is sensitive to other climatic drivers as well. Rising air 
temperatures increase crop evapotranspiration, thus increasing water 
demand for crop production to maintain optimal yield (Beniston and 
Stoffel, 2014). They are also associated with upslope movement of 
cropping zones, which favours some farmers in high mountain areas, 
who are increasingly able to cultivate new crops, such as onions, 
garlic and apples in Nepal (Huntington et al., 2017; Hussain et al., 
2018), and maize in Ecuador (Skarbø and VanderMolen, 2014). Dry 
spells and unseasonal frosts have also impacted agriculture in Peru 
(Bury et al., 2011).
Adaptation activities in mountain agriculture related at least partially 
to cryospheric changes are detailed in Table SM2.12 and their 
geographic spread shown in Figure 2.9. Agriculture in these areas 
is sensitive to non-climate drivers as well, such as market forces 
and political pressures (Montana et al., 2016; Sietz and Feola, 2016; 
Figueroa-Armijos and Valdivia, 2017) and shifts in water governance 
(Rasmussen, 2016). The majority of the adaptation activities are 
autonomous, though some are planned or carried out with support 
from national governments, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), 
or international aid organisations. Though many studies report on 
beneﬁts from these activities which accrue to community members 
as increased harvests and income, systematic evaluations of these 
adaptation strategies are generally lacking. A range of factors, 
discussed below, place barriers which limit the scale and scope of 
these activities in the mountain agricultural sector, including a lack 
of ﬁnance and technical knowledge, low adaptive capacity within 
communities, ill-equipped state organisations, ambiguous property 
rights and inadequate institutional and market support (medium 
evidence, high agreement). Section  2.3.7 examines two other 
responses to decreasing irrigation water: wage labour migration, 
which often serves as an adaptation strategy, and displacement of 
155
High Mountain Areas

entire communities, an indication of the limits to adaptation – this 
displacement is also due in some cases to natural hazards.
To cope with the reduced water supplies, planted areas have been 
reduced in a number of different places in Nepal (Gentle and 
Maraseni, 2012; Sujakhu et al., 2016). Adaptation responses within 
irrigation systems include the adoption of new irrigation technologies 
or upgrading existing technologies, adopting water conservation 
measures, water rationing, constructing water storage infrastructure, 
and change in cropping patterns (Rasul et al., 2019; Figure 2.9). Water 
delivery technologies which reduce loss are adopted in Chile (Young 
et al., 2010) and Peru (Orlove et al., 2019). Similarly, greenhouses 
have been adopted in Nepal (Konchar et al., 2015) to reduce 
evapotranspiration and frost damage, though limited access to ﬁnance 
is a barrier to these activities. Box 2.3 describes innovative irrigation 
practices in India. Local pastoral communities have responded 
to these challenges with techniques broadly similar to those in 
agricultural settings by expanding irrigation facilities, for example, 
in Switzerland (Fuhrer et al., 2014). In addition to adopting new 
technologies, some water users make investments to tap more distant 
sources of irrigation water. Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 1 discusses 
such efforts in Northern Pakistan, where landslides, associated with 
cryosphere change, have also damaged irrigation systems.  
The adoption of new crops and varieties is an adaptation response 
found in several regions. Farmers in northwest India have increased 
production of lentils and vegetables, which provide important 
nutrients to the local diet, with support from government watershed 
improvement programs which help address decreased availability 
of irrigation water, though stringent requirements for participation 
in the programs have limited access by poor households to this 
assistance (Dame and Nüsser, 2011). Farmers who rely on irrigation 
in the Naryn River basin in Kyrgyzstan have shifted from the water 
intensive fruits and vegetables to fodder crops such as barley and 
alfalfa, which are more proﬁtable. Upstream communities, with 
greater access to water and more active local institutions, are more 
willing to experiment with new crops than those further downstream 
(Hill et al., 2017). In other areas, crop choices also reﬂect responses 
to rising temperatures along with new market opportunities such as 
the demand for fresh vegetables by tourists in Nepal (Konchar et al., 
2015; Dangi et al., 2018) and the demand for roses in urban areas in 
Peru (SENASA, 2017). Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge 
(Cross-Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 1), access to local and regional seed 
supply networks, proximity to agricultural extension and support 
services also facilitate the adoption of new crops (Skarbø and 
VanderMolen, 2014).
Local institutions and embedded social relations play a vital role 
in enabling mountain communities to respond to the impacts of 
climate driven cryosphere change. Indigenous pastoral communities 
who have tapped into new water sources to irrigate new areas have 
also strengthened the control of access to existing irrigated pastures 
in Peru (Postigo, 2014) and Bolivia (Yager, 2015). In an example of 
indigenous populations in the USA, two tribes who share a large 
reservation in the Northern Rockies rely on rivers which receive glacier 
melt water to irrigate pasture, and maintain ﬁsheries, domestic water 
supplies, and traditional ceremonial practices. Tribal water managers 
have sought to install infrastructure to promote more efﬁcient water 
use and protect ﬁsheries, but these efforts have been impeded by 
land and water governance institutions in the region and by a history 
of social marginalisation (McNeeley, 2017). 
High mountain communities have sought new ﬁnancial resources 
from wage labour (Section 2.3.7), tourism (Mukherji et al., 2019) and 
government sources to support adaptation activities. Local water 
user associations in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan have adopted less 
water intensive crops and reorganised the use and maintenance of 
irrigation systems, investing government relief payments after ﬂoods 
(Stucker et al., 2012). Similar measures are reported from India and 
Pakistan (Dame and Mankelow, 2010; Clouse, 2016; Nüsser and 
Schmidt, 2017), Nepal (McDowell et al., 2013) and Peru (Postigo, 
2014). In contrast, fewer adaptation measures have been adopted in 
Uzbekistan, due to low levels of capital availability and to agricultural 
policies, including centralised water management, crop production 
quotas and weak agricultural extension, which limit the response 
capacity of farmers (Aleksandrova et al., 2014). 
Lowland agricultural areas which receive irrigation water from rivers 
fed by glacier melt and snowmelt are projected to face negative 
impacts in some regions (limited evidence, high agreement). In 
the Rhone basin in Switzerland, many irrigated pasture areas are 
projected to face water deﬁcits by 2050, under the A1B scenario 
(Fuhrer et al., 2014; Cross Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1). For California 
and the southwestern USA, a shift to peak snowmelt earlier in the 
year would create more frequent ﬂoods, and a reduced ability of 
existing reservoirs to store water by 2050 under RCP8.5 (Pagán et al.,  
2016) and by 2100 under RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 (Pathak  
et al., 2018). The economic values of these losses have been estimated 
at 10.8–48.6  billion USD by around 2050 (Sturm et al., 2017).  
A similar transition to runoff peaks earlier in the year by 2100 under 
RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, creating challenges for management of 
irrigation water, has been reported for the countries in central Asia 
which are dependent on snow cover and glaciers of the Tien Shan 
(Xenarios et al., 2018). In India and Pakistan, where over 100 million 
farmers receive irrigation from the Indus and Ganges Rivers, which 
also have signiﬁcant inputs from glaciers and snowmelt, also face 
risks of decreasing water supplies from cryosphere change by 2100 
(Biemans et al., 2019; Rasul and Molden, 2019).

Box 2.3 |  Local Responses to Water Shortage in northwest India
Agriculture in Ladakh, a cold arid mountain region (~100,000 km2) in the western Himalaya of India with median elevation of 3,350 m 
a.s.l. and mean annual precipitation of less than 100 mm, is highly dependent on streams for irrigation in the agricultural season in the 
spring and summer (Nüsser et al., 2012; Barrett and Bosak, 2018). Glaciers in Ladakh, largely located at 5,000–6,000 m a.s.l. and small 
in size have retreated at least since the late 1960s although less pronounced than in many other Himalayan regions (Chudley et al., 
2017; Schmidt and Nüsser, 2017). However, the effect of glaciers on streamﬂow in Ladakh is poorly constrained, and measurements 
on changes in runoff and snow cover are lacking (Nüsser et al., 2018).
To cope with seasonal water scarcity at critical times for irrigation, villagers in the region have developed four types of artiﬁcial ice 
reservoirs: basins, cascades, diversions and a form known locally as ice stupas. All these types of ice reservoirs capture water in the 
autumn and winter, allowing it to freeze, and hold it until spring, when it melts and ﬂows down to ﬁelds (Clouse et al., 2017; Nüsser 
et al., 2018). In this way, they retain a previously unused portion of the annual ﬂow and facilitate its use to supplement the decreased 
ﬂow in the following spring (Vince, 2009; Shaheen, 2016). Frozen basins are formed from water which is conveyed across a slope 
through channels and check dams to shaded surface depressions near the villages. Cascades and diversions direct water to pass over 
stone walls, slowing its movement and allowing it to freeze. Ice stupas direct water through pipes into fountains, where it freezes 
into conical shapes (Box 2.3 Figure 1). These techniques use local materials and draw on local knowledge (Nüsser and Baghel, 2016). 
A study examined 14 ice reservoirs, including ice stupas, and concluded that they serve as ‘site-speciﬁc water conservation strategies; 
and that they can be regarded as appropriate local technologies to reduce seasonal water scarcity at critical times (Nüsser et al., 
2018). It listed the beneﬁts of ice reservoirs as improved water availability in spring, reduction of seasonal water scarcity and resulting 
crop failure risks, and the possibility of growing cash crops. However, the study questioned their usefulness as a long-term adaptation 
strategy, because their operation depends on winter runoff and freeze-thaw cycles, both of which are sensitive to interannual 
variability, and often deviate from the optimum range required for effective functioning of the reservoirs. It also raised questions 
about the ﬁnancial costs and labour requirements, which vary across the four types of ice reservoirs.

2.3.1.3.3 Drinking water supply
Only a few studies provide detailed empirical assessments of the 
effects of cryosphere change on the amounts of drinking water 
supply. Decreases in drinking water supplies due to reduced glacier 
and snowmelt water have been reported for rural areas in the Nepal 
Himalaya (McDowell et al., 2013; Dangi et al., 2018), but the tropical 
Andes have received the most attention, including both urban 
conglomerates and some rural areas, where water resources are 
especially vulnerable to climate change due to water scarcity and 
increased demands (Chevallier et al., 2011; Somers et al., 2018), 
amidst rapidly retreating glaciers (Burns and Nolin, 2014).
The contribution of glacier water to the water supply of La Paz, 
Bolivia, between 1963–2006 was assessed at 15% annually and 27% 
during the dry season (Soruco et al., 2015), though rising as high as 
86% during extreme drought months (Buytaert and De Bièvre, 2012). 
Despite a 50% area loss, the glacier retreat has not contributed to 
reduced water supplies for the city, because increased melt rates 
have compensated for reductions in glacier volume. However, for 
a complete disappearance of the glaciers, assuming no change in 
precipitation, a reduction in annual runoff by 12% and 24% in the 
dry season was projected (Soruco et al., 2015) similar to reductions 
projected by 2050 under a RCP8.5 scenario for a basin in southern 
Peru (Drenkhan et al., 2019). Huaraz and Huancayo in Peru are other 
cities with high average contribution of melt water to surface water 
resources (up to ~20%; Buytaert et al., 2017) and rapid glacier retreat 
in their headwaters (Rabatel et al., 2013).
Overall, risks to water security and related vulnerabilities are highly 
heterogeneous varying even at small spatial scales with populations 
closer to the glaciers being more vulnerable, especially during dry 
months and droughts (Buytaert et al., 2017; Mark et al., 2017).  
A regional-scale modelling study including all of Bolivia, Ecuador and 
Peru (Buytaert et al., 2017) estimated that roughly 390,000 domestic 
water users, mostly in Peru, rely on a high (>25%) long-term average 
contribution from glacier melt, with this number rising to almost 
4 million in the driest month of a drought year. Despite high conﬁdence 
in declining longer-term melt water contributions from glaciers in the 
tropical Andes (Figure CB6.1), major uncertainties remain how these 
will affect future human water use. Regional-scale water balance 
simulations forced by multi-model climate projections (Buytaert and 
De Bièvre, 2012), suggest a relatively limited effect of glacier retreat 
on water supply in four major cities (Bogota, La Paz, Lima, Quito) 
due to the dominance of human factors inﬂuencing water supply 
(Carey et al., 2014; Mark et al., 2017; Vuille et al., 2018), though 
uncertainties are large. Population growth and limited funding for 
infrastructure maintenance exacerbate water scarcity, though water 
managers have established programs in Quito and in Huancayo and 
the Santa and Vilcanota basins (Peru) to improve water management 
through innovations in grey infrastructure and ecosystem-based 
adaptations (Buytaert and De Bièvre, 2012; Buytaert et al., 2017; 
Somers et al., 2018).
In summary, there is limited evidence (medium agreement) that 
glacier decline places increased risks to drinking water supply. In 
the Andes, future increases in water demand due to population 
growth and other socioeconomic stressors are expected to outpace 
the impact of climate change induced changes on water availability 
regardless the emission scenario.
2.3.1.4 
Water Governance and Response Measures
Cryospheric changes induced by climate change, and their effects 
on hydrological regime and water availability, bear relevance for the 
management and governance of water as a resource for communities 
and ecosystems (Hill, 2013; Beniston and Stoffel, 2014; Carey et al., 
2017), particularly in areas where snow and ice contribute signiﬁcantly 
to river runoff (medium conﬁdence) (Section  2.3.1.1). However, 
water availability is one aspect relevant for water management and 
governance, given that multiple and diverse decision making contexts 
and governance approaches and strategies can inﬂuence how the 
water resource is accessed and distributed (medium conﬁdence) 
(De Stefano et al., 2010; Beniston and Stoffel, 2014).
A key risk factor that inﬂuences how water is managed and 
governed, rests on existing and unresolved conﬂicts that may or 
may not necessarily arise exclusively from demands over shared 
water resources, raising tensions within and across borders in river 
basins inﬂuenced by snow and glacier melt (Valdés-Pineda et al., 
2014; Bocchiola et al., 2017). For example, in Central Asia, competing 
demand for water for hydropower and irrigation between upstream 
and downstream countries has raised tensions (Bernauer and 
Siegfried, 2012; Bocchiola et al., 2017). Similarly, competing demand 
for water is also reported in Chile (Valdés-Pineda et al., 2014) and in 
Peru (Vuille, 2013; Drenkhan et al., 2015). Since AR5, some studies 
have examined the impacts and risks related to projections of 
cryosphere-related changes in streamﬂow in transboundary basins 
in the 21st century, and suggest that these changes create barriers in 
effectively managing water in some settings (medium conﬁdence). For 
instance, within the transnational Indus River basin, climate change 
impacts may reduce streamﬂow by the end of this century, thus 
putting pressure on established water sharing arrangements between 
nations (Jamir, 2016) and subnational administrative units (Yang 
et al., 2014b). In this basin, management efforts may be hampered 
by current legal and regulatory frameworks for evaluating new dams, 
which do not take into account changes in streamﬂow that may 
result from climate change (Raman, 2018). Within the transnational 
Syr Darya and Amu Darya basins in Central Asia, competition for 
water between multiple uses, exacerbated by reductions in ﬂow 
later in this century, may hamper future coordination (Reyer et al., 
2017; Yu et al., 2019). However, other evidence from Central Asia 
suggests that relative water scarcity may not be the only factor to 
exacerbate conﬂict in this region (Hummel, 2017). Overall, there is 
medium conﬁdence in the ability to meet future water demands in 
some mountain regions, given the combined uncertainties associated 
with accurate projections of water supply in terms of availability and 
the diverse sociocultural and political contexts in which decisions on 
water access and distribution are taken.
Since AR5, several studies highlight that integrated water 
management approaches, focused on the multipurpose use of water 
that includes water released from the cryosphere, are important as 
adaptation measures, particularly for sectors reliant on this water

source to sustain energy production, agriculture, ecosystems and 
drinking water supply (Figure  2.9). These measures, backed by 
effective governance arrangements to support them, demonstrate 
an ability to address increasing challenges to water availability 
arising from climate change in the mountain cryosphere, providing 
co-beneﬁts through the optimisation of storage and the release of 
water from high mountain reservoirs (medium conﬁdence). Studies 
in Switzerland (e.g., Haeberli et al., 2016; Brunner et al., 2019), Peru 
(e.g., Barriga Delgado et al., 2018; Drenkhan et al., 2019), Central Asia 
(Jalilov et al., 2018) and Himalaya (Molden et al., 2014; Biemans et al., 
2019) highlight the potential of water reservoirs in high mountains, 
including new reservoirs located in former glacier beds, alleviating 
seasonal water scarcity for multiple water usages. However, concerns 
are also raised in the environmental literature about their actual 
and potential negative impacts on local ecosystems and biodiversity 
hotspots, such as wetlands and peat bogs, which have been reported 
for small high mountain reservoirs, for example, in the European Alps 
(Evette et al., 2011) and for large dam construction projects in High 
Mountain Asia (e.g., Dharmadhikary, 2008).
Transboundary cooperation at regional scales are reported to 
further support efforts that address the potential risks to water 
resources in terms of its availability and its access and distribution 
governance (Dinar et al., 2016). Furthermore, the UN 2030 Agenda 
and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (UN, 2015) may 
offer additional prospects to strengthen water governance under 
a changing cryosphere, given that monitoring and reporting on key 
water-related targets and indicators, and their interaction across 
other SDGs, direct attention to the provision of water as a key 
condition for development (Section 2.4). However, there is limited 
evidence to date to assess their effectiveness on an evidentiary basis.
2.3.2 
Landslide, Avalanche and Flood Hazards
High mountains are particularly prone to hazards related to snow, 
ice and permafrost as these elements exert key controls on mountain 
slope stability (Haeberli and Whiteman, 2015). This section assesses 
knowledge gained since previous IPCC reports, in particular SREX 
(e.g., Seneviratne et al., 2012), and AR5 Working Group II (Cramer 
et al., 2014). In this section, observed and projected changes in hazards 
are covered ﬁrst, followed by exposure, vulnerability and resulting 
impacts and risks, and ﬁnally disaster risk reduction and adaptation. 
Cryospheric hazards that constitute tipping points are also listed in 
Table 6.1 in Chapter 6. 
Hazards assessed in this section range from localised effects on 
mountain slopes and adjacent valley ﬂoors (distance reach of up 
to several kilometres) to events reaching far into major valleys 
and even surrounding lowlands (reach of tens to hundreds of 
kilometres), and include cascading events. Changes in the cryosphere 
due to climate change inﬂuence the frequency and magnitude of 
hazards, the processes involved, and the locations exposed to the 
hazards (Figure 2.7). Natural hazards and associated disasters are 
sporadic by nature, and vulnerability and exposure exhibit strong 
geographic variations. Assessments of change are based not only 
on direct evidence, but also on laboratory experiments, theoretical 
considerations and calculations, and numerical modelling.
2.3.2.1 
Observed and Projected Changes
2.3.2.1.1 Unstable slopes, landslides and glacier instabilities
Permafrost degradation and thaw as well as increased water ﬂow 
into frozen slopes can increase the rate of movement of frozen 
debris bodies and lower their surface due to loss of ground ice 
(subsidence). Such processes affected engineered structures such 
as buildings, hazard protection structures, roads, or rail lines in all 
high mountains during recent decades (Section  2.3.4). Movement 
of frozen slopes and ground subsidence/heave are strongly related 
to ground temperature, ice content, and water input (Wirz et al., 
2016; Kenner et al., 2017). Where massive ground ice gets exposed, 
retrogressive thaw erosion develops (Niu et al., 2012). The creep 
of rock glaciers (frozen debris tongues that slowly deform under 
gravity) is in principle expected to accelerate in response to rising 
ground temperatures, until substantial volumetric ice contents have 
melted out (Kääb et al., 2007; Arenson et al., 2015a). As documented 
for instance for sites in the European Alps and Scandinavia for recent 
years to decades, rock glaciers replenished debris ﬂow starting zones 
at their fronts, so that the intensiﬁed material supply associated 
with accelerated movement (Section 2.2.4) contributed to increased 
debris ﬂow activity (higher frequency, larger magnitudes) or slope 
destabilisation (Stoffel and Graf, 2015; Wirz et al., 2016; Kummert 
et al., 2017; Eriksen et al., 2018). 
There is high conﬁdence that the frequency of rocks detaching and 
falling from steep slopes (rock fall) has increased within zones of 
degrading permafrost over the past half-century, for instance in 
high mountains in North America, New Zealand, and Europe (Allen 
et al., 2011; Ravanel and Deline, 2011; Fischer et al., 2012; Coe et al., 
2017). Compared to the SREX and AR5 reports, the conﬁdence in this 
ﬁnding increased. Available ﬁeld evidence agrees with theoretical 
considerations and calculations that permafrost thaw increases 
the likelihood of rock fall (and also rock avalanches, which have 
larger volumes compared to rock falls) (Gruber and Haeberli, 2007; 
Krautblatter et al., 2013). These conclusions are also supported by 
observed ice in the detachment zone of previous events in North 
America, Iceland and Europe (Geertsema et al., 2006; Phillips et al., 
2017; Sæmundsson et al., 2018). Summer heat waves have in recent 
years triggered rock instability with delays of only a few days or 
weeks in the European Alps (Allen and Huggel, 2013; Ravanel et al., 
2017). This is in line with theoretical considerations about fast thaw 
of ice ﬁlled frozen fractures in bedrock (Hasler et al., 2011) and other 
climate impacts on rock stability, such as from large temperature 
variations (Luethi et al., 2015). Similarly, permafrost thaw increased 
the frequency and volumes of landslides from frozen sediments in 
many mountain regions in recent decades (Wei et al., 2006; Ravanel 
et al., 2010; Lacelle et al., 2015). At lower elevations in the French 
Alps, though, climate driven changes such as a reduction in number 
of freezing days are projected to lead to a reduction in debris ﬂows 
(Jomelli et al., 2009).

A range of slope instability types was found to be connected to glacier 
retreat (Allen et al., 2011; Evans and Delaney, 2015). Debris left 
behind by retreating glaciers (moraines) slid or collapsed, or formed 
fast ﬂowing water-debris mixtures (debris ﬂows) in recent decades, 
for instance in the European and New Zealand Alps (Zimmermann 
and Haeberli, 1992; Blair, 1994; Curry et al., 2006; Eichel et al., 2018). 
Over decades to millennia, or even longer, rock slopes adjacent to or 
formerly covered by glaciers, became unstable and in some cases, 
eventually collapsed. Related landslide activity increased in recently 
deglacierised zones in most high mountains (Korup et al., 2012; 
McColl, 2012; Deline et al., 2015; Kos et al., 2016; Serrano et al., 
2018). For example, according to Cloutier et al. (2017) more than 
two-thirds of the large landslides that occurred in Northern British 
Columbia between 1973–2003, occurred on cirque walls that have 
been exposed after glacier retreat from the mid-19th century on. 
Ice-rich permafrost environments following glacial retreat enhanced 
slope mass movements (Oliva and Ruiz-Fernández, 2015). At lower 
elevations, re-vegetation and rise of tree limit are able to stabilise 
shallow slope instabilities (Curry et al., 2006). Overall, there is high 
conﬁdence that glacier retreat in general has in most high mountains 
destabilised adjacent debris and rock slopes over time scales from 
years to millennia, but robust statistics about current trends in this 
development are lacking. This ﬁnding reconﬁrms, and for some 
processes increases conﬁdence in related ﬁndings from the SREX and 
AR5 reports.
Ice break-off and subsequent ice avalanches are natural processes 
at steep glacier fronts. How climate driven changes in geometry and 
thermal regime of such glaciers inﬂuenced ice avalanche hazards over 
years to decades depended strongly on local conditions, as shown for 
the European Alps (Fischer et al., 2013; Faillettaz et al., 2015). The few 
available observations are insufﬁcient to detect trends. Where steep 
glaciers are frozen to bedrock, there is, however, medium evidence 
and high agreement from observations in the European Alps and 
from numerical simulations that failures of large parts of these 
glaciers were and will be facilitated in the future due to an increase 
in basal ice temperature (Fischer et al., 2013; Faillettaz et al., 2015; 
Gilbert et al., 2015).
In some regions, glacier surges constitute a recurring hazard, due 
to widespread, quasi-periodic and substantial increases in glacier 
speed over a period of a few months to years, often accompanied 
by glacier advance (Harrison et al., 2015; Sevestre and Benn, 2015). 
In a number of cases, mostly in North America and High Mountain 
Asia (Bevington and Copland, 2014; Round et al., 2017; Steiner et al., 
2018), surge-related glacier advances dammed rivers, causing major 
ﬂoods. In rare cases, glacier surges directly inundated agricultural 
land and damaged infrastructure (Shangguan et al., 2016). Sevestre 
and Benn (2015) suggest that surging operates within a climatic 
envelope of temperature and precipitation conditions, and that shifts 
in these conditions can modify surge frequencies and magnitudes. 
Some glaciers have reduced or stopped surge activity, or are 
projected to do so within decades, as a consequence of negative 
glacier mass balances (Eisen et al., 2001; Kienholz et al., 2017). For 
such cases, related hazards can also be expected to decrease. In 
contrast, intensive or increased surge activity (Hewitt, 2007; Gardelle 
et al., 2012; Yasuda and Furuya, 2015) occurred in a region on and 
around the Western Tibetan plateau which exhibited balanced or 
even positive glacier mass budgets in recent decades (Brun et al., 
2017). Enhanced melt water production was suggested to be able 
to trigger or enhance surge-type instability, in particular for glaciers 
that contain ice both at the melting point and considerably below 
(Dunse et al., 2015; Yasuda and Furuya, 2015; Nuth et al., 2019).
A rare type of glacier instability with large volumes (in the order of 
10–100 million m3) and high mobility (up to 200–300 km/h) results 
from the complete collapse of large sections of low-angle valley 
glaciers and subsequent combined ice/rock/debris avalanches. The 
largest of such glacier collapses have been reported in the Caucasus 
Mountains in 2002 (Kolka Glacier, ~130 fatalities) (Huggel et al., 
2005; Evans et al., 2009), and in the Aru Range in Tibet in 2016 (twin 
glacier collapses with 9 fatalities) (Kääb et al., 2018). Although there 
is no evidence that climate change has played a direct role in the 
2002 event, changes in glacier mass balance, water input into the 
glaciers, and the frozen regime of the glacier beds were involved in 
the 2016 collapses and at least partly linked with climate change 
(Gilbert et al., 2018). Besides the 2016 Tibet cases, it is unknown 
if such massive and rare collapse-like glacier instabilities can be 
attributed to climate change.
2.3.2.1.2 Snow avalanches
Snow avalanches can occur either spontaneously due to 
meteorological factors such as loading by snowfall or liquid water 
inﬁltration following, for example, surface melt or rain-on-snow, or 
can be triggered by the passage of people in avalanche terrain, the 
impact of falling ice or rocks, or by explosives used for avalanche 
control (Schweizer et al., 2003). There is no published evidence found 
that addresses the links between climate change and accidental 
avalanches triggered by recreationists or workers. Changes in snow 
cover characteristics are expected to induce changes in spontaneous 
avalanche activity including changes in friction and ﬂow regime 
(Naaim et al., 2013; Steinkogler et al., 2014).
Ballesteros-Cánovas et al. (2018) reported increased avalanche 
activity in some slopes of the Western Indian Himalaya over the 
past decades related to increased frequency of wet-snow conditions. 
In the European Alps, avalanche numbers and runout distance 
have decreased where snow depth decreased and air temperature 
increased (Teich et al., 2012; Eckert et al., 2013). In the European Alps 
and Tatras mountains, over past decades, there has been a decrease 
in avalanche mass and run-out distance and a decrease in avalanches 
with a powder part; avalanche numbers decreased below 2,000 m 
a.s.l., and increased above (Eckert et al., 2013; Lavigne et al., 2015; 
Gadek et al., 2017). A positive trend in the proportion of avalanches 
involving wet snow in December through February was shown for 
the last decades (Pielmeier et al., 2013; Naaim et al., 2016). Land use 
and land cover changes also contributed to changes in avalanches 
(García-Hernández et al., 2017; Giacona et al., 2018). Correlations 
between avalanche activity and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation 
(ENSO) were identiﬁed from 1950–2011 in North and South America 
but there was no signiﬁcant temporal trend reported for avalanche 
activity (McClung, 2013). Mostly inconclusive results were reported 
by Sinickas et al. (2015) and Bellaire et al. (2016) regarding the

relationship between avalanche activity, climate change and disaster 
risk reduction activities in North America. In summary, in particular 
in Europe, there is medium conﬁdence in an increase in avalanche 
activity involving wet snow, and a decrease in the size and run-out 
distance of snow avalanches over the past decades.
Future projections mostly indicate an overall decrease in snow depth 
and snow cover duration at lower elevation (Section 2.2.2), but the 
probability of occurrence of occasionally large snow precipitation 
events is projected to remain possible throughout most of the 21st 
century (Section 2.2.1). Castebrunet et al. (2014) estimated an overall 
20 and 30% decrease of natural avalanche activity in the French Alps 
for the mid and end of the 21st century, respectively, under A1B 
scenario, compared to the reference period 1960–1990. Katsuyama 
et al. (2017) reached similar conclusions for Northern Japan, and 
Lazar and Williams (2008) for North America. Avalanches involving 
wet snow are projected to occur more frequently during the winter at 
all elevations due to surface melt or rain-on-snow (e.g., Castebrunet 
et al., 2014, for the French Alps), and the overall number and runout 
distance of snow avalanches is projected to decrease in regions 
and elevations experiencing signiﬁcant reduction in snow cover 
(Mock et al., 2017). In summary, there is medium evidence and high 
agreement that observed changes in avalanches in mountain regions 
will be exacerbated in the future, with generally a decrease in hazard 
at lower elevation, and mixed changes at higher elevation (increase 
in avalanches involving wet snow, no clear direction of trend for 
overall avalanche activity).
2.3.2.1.3 Floods
Glacier-related ﬂoods, including ﬂoods from lake outbursts (GLOFs), 
are documented for most glacierised mountain ranges and are among 
the most far-reaching glacier hazards. Past events affected areas 
tens to hundreds of kilometres downstream (Carrivick and Tweed, 
2016). Retreating glaciers produced lakes at their fronts in many high 
mountain regions in recent decades (Frey et al., 2010; Gardelle et al., 
2011; Loriaux and Casassa, 2013). Lake systems in High Mountain 
Asia also often developed on the surface of downwasting, low-slope 
glaciers where they coalesced from temporally variable supraglacial 
lakes (Benn et al., 2012; Narama et al., 2017). Corroborating SREX 
and AR5 ﬁndings, there is high conﬁdence that current global glacier 
shrinkage caused new lakes to form and existing lakes to grow in 
most regions, for instance in South America, High mountain Asia and 
Europe (Loriaux and Casassa, 2013; Paul and Mölg, 2014; Zhang et al., 
2015; Buckel et al., 2018). Exceptions occurred and are expected to 
occur in the future for few lakes where evaporation, runoff and 
reduced melt water inﬂux in total led to a negative water balance 
(Sun et al., 2018a). Also, advancing glaciers temporarily dammed 
rivers, lake sections, or fjords (Stearns et al., 2015), for instance 
through surging (Round et al., 2017), causing particularly large ﬂoods 
once the ice dams breached. Outbursts from water bodies in and 
under glaciers are able to cause ﬂoods similar to those from surface 
lakes but little is known about the processes involved and any trends 
under climate change. In some cases, the glacier thermal regime 
played a role so that climate driven changes in thermal regime are 
expected to alter the hazard potential, depending on local conditions 
(Gilbert et al., 2012). Another source of large water bodies under 
glaciers and subsequent ﬂoods has been subglacial volcanic activity 
(Section 2.3.2.1.4). There is also high conﬁdence that the number 
and area of glacier lakes will continue to increase in most regions 
in the coming decades, and new lakes will develop closer to steep 
and potentially unstable mountain walls where lake outbursts can be 
more easily triggered by the impact of landslides (Frey et al., 2010; 
ICIMOD, 2011; Allen et al., 2016a; Linsbauer et al., 2016; Colonia 
et al., 2017; Haeberli et al., 2017).
In contrast to the number and size of glacier lakes, trends in the 
number of glacier-related ﬂoods are not well known for recent decades 
(Carrivick and Tweed, 2016; Harrison et al., 2018), although a number 
of periods of increased and decreased ﬂood activity have been 
documented for individual glaciers in North America and Greenland, 
spanning decades (Geertsema and Clague, 2005; Russell et al., 2011). 
A decrease in moraine-dammed glacier lake outburst ﬂoods in recent 
decades suggests a response of lake outburst activity being delayed 
by some decades with respect to glacier retreat (Harrison et al., 
2018) but inventories might signiﬁcantly underestimate the number 
of events (Veh et al., 2018). For the Himalaya, Veh et al. (2019)161 
found no increase in the number of glacier lake outburst ﬂoods since 
the late 1980s. The degradation of permafrost and the melting of ice 
buried in lake dams have been shown to lower dam stability and 
contribute to outburst ﬂoods in many high mountain regions (Fujita 
et al., 2013; Erokhin et al., 2017; Narama et al., 2017).
Floods originating from the combination of rapidly melting snow and 
intense rainfall, referred to as rain-on-snow events, are some of the 
most damaging ﬂoods in mountain areas (Pomeroy et al., 2016; Il 
Jeong and Sushama, 2018). The hydrological response of a catchment 
to a rain-on-snow event depends on the characteristics of the 
precipitation event, but also on turbulent ﬂuxes driven by wind and 
humidity, which typically provide most of the melting energy during 
such events (Pomeroy et al., 2016), and the state of the snowpack, in 
 particular the liquid water content (Würzer et al., 2016). An increase  
in the occurrence of rain-on-snow events in high-elevation zones, and 
a decrease at the lowest elevations have been reported (Western USA, 
1949–2003, McCabe et al. (2007); Oregon, 1986–2010, Surﬂeet and 
Tullos (2013); Switzerland, 1972–2016, Moran-Tejéda et al. (2016), 
central Europe, 1950–2010, Freudiger et al. (2014)). These trends 
are consistent with studies carried out at the scale of the Northern 
Hemisphere (Putkonen and Roe, 2003; Ye et al., 2008; Cohen et al., 
2015). There are no studies found on this topic in Africa and South 
America. In summary, evidence since AR5 suggests that rain-on-
snow events have increased over the last decades at high elevations, 
particularly during transition periods from autumn to winter and 
winter to spring (medium conﬁdence). The occurrence of rain-on-
snow events has decreased over the last decade in low-elevation or 
low-latitude areas due to a decreasing duration of the snowpack, 
except for the coldest months of the year (medium conﬁdence).
Il Jeong and Sushama (2018) projected an increase in rain-on-
snow events in winter and a decrease in spring, for the period 
2041–2070 (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) in North America, corroborated 
by Musselman et al. (2018). Their frequency in the Swiss Alps is 
projected to increase at elevations higher than 2,000 m a.s.l. (SRES 
A1B, 2025, 2055, and 2085) (Beniston and Stoffel, 2016). This study 
162

showed that the number of rain-on-snow events may increase by  
50%  with  a regional temperature increase of 2ºC to 4ºC, and 
decrease with  a temperature rise exceeding 4ºC. In Alaska, an 
overall increase of rain-on-snow events is projected, however with  
a projected decline in the southwestern/southern region (Bieniek 
et al., 2018). In summary, evidence since AR5 suggests that the 
frequency of rain-on-snow events is projected to increase and occur 
earlier in spring and later in autumn at higher elevation and to 
decrease at lower elevation (high conﬁdence).
2.3.2.1.4 Combined hazards and cascading events
The largest mountain disasters in terms of reach, damage and 
lives lost that involve ice, snow and permafrost occurred through a 
combination or chain of processes. New evidence since SREX and AR5 
has strengthened these ﬁndings (Anacona et al., 2015a; Evans and 
Delaney, 2015). Some process chains occur frequently, while others 
are rare, speciﬁc to local circumstances and difﬁcult to anticipate. 
Glacier lake outbursts were in many mountain regions and over 
recent decades documented to have been triggered by impact waves 
from snow-, ice- or rock-avalanches, landslides, iceberg calving 
events, or by temporary blockage of surface or subsurface drainage 
channels (Benn et al., 2012; Narama et al., 2017). Rock-slope 
instability and catastrophic failure along fjords caused tsunamis 
(Hermanns et al., 2014; Roberts et al., 2014). For instance, a landslide 
generated wave in 2015 at Taan Fjord, Alaska, ran up 193 m on the 
opposite slope and then travelled more than 20 km down the fjord 
(Higman et al., 2018). Earthquakes have been a starting point for 
different types of cascading events, for instance by causing snow-, 
ice- or rock-avalanches, and landslides (van der Woerd et al., 2004; 
Podolskiy et al., 2010; Cook and Butz, 2013; Sæmundsson et al., 
2018). Glaciers and their moraines, including morainic lake dams, 
seem however, not particularly prone to earthquake triggered failure 
(Kargel et al., 2016).
Landslides and rock avalanches in glacier environments were often 
documented to entrain snow and ice that ﬂuidise, and incorporate 
additional loose glacial sediments or water bodies, thereby 
multiplying their mobility, volume and reach (Schneider et al., 2011; 
Evans and Delaney, 2015). Rock avalanches onto glaciers triggered 
glacier advances in recent decades, for instance in North America, 
New Zealand and Europe, mainly through reducing surface melt 
(Deline, 2009; Reznichenko et al., 2011; Menounos et al., 2013). 
In glacier covered frozen rock walls, particularly complex thermal, 
mechanical, hydraulic and hydrologic interactions between steep 
glaciers, frozen rock and its ice content, and unfrozen rock sections 
lead to combined rock/ice instabilities that are difﬁcult to observe 
and anticipate (Harris et al., 2009; Fischer et al., 2013; Ravanel et al., 
2017). There is limited evidence of observed direct event chains to 
project future trends. However, from the observed and projected 
degradation of permafrost, shrinkage of glaciers and increase in 
glacier lakes it is reasonable to assume that event chains involving 
these could increase in frequency or magnitude, and that accordingly 
hazard zones could expand.
Volcanoes covered by snow and ice often produce substantial 
melt water during eruptions. This typically results in ﬂoods and/or 
lahars (mixtures of melt water and volcanic debris) which can be 
exceptionally violent and cause large-scale loss of life and destruction 
to infrastructure (Barr et al., 2018). The most devastating example 
from recent history occurred in 1985, when the medium-sized 
eruption of Nevado del Ruiz volcano, Colombia, produced lahars that 
killed more than 23,000 people some 70 km downstream (Pierson 
et al., 1990). Hazards associated with ice and snow-clad volcanoes 
have been reported mostly from the Cordilleras of the Americas, 
but also from the Aleutian arc (USA), Mexico, Kamchatka (Russia), 
Japan, New Zealand and Iceland (Seynova et al., 2017). In particular, 
under Icelandic glaciers, volcanic activity and eruptions melted large 
amounts of ice and caused especially large ﬂoods if water accumulated 
underneath the glacier (Björnsson, 2003; Seneviratne et al., 2012). 
There is medium conﬁdence that the overall hazard related to ﬂoods 
and lahars from ice- and snow-clad volcanoes will gradually diminish 
over years-to-decades as glaciers and seasonal snow cover continue 
to decrease under climate change (Aguilera et al., 2004; Barr et al., 
2018). On the other hand, shrinkage of glaciers may uncover steep 
slopes of unconsolidated volcanic sediments, thus decreasing in the 
future the resistance of these volcano ﬂanks to heavy rain fall and 
increasing the hazard from related debris ﬂows (Vallance, 2005). In 
summary, future changes in snow and ice are expected to modify the 
impacts of volcanic activity of snow- and ice-clad volcanoes (high 
conﬁdence) although in complex and locally variable ways and at 
a variety of time scales (Barr et al., 2018; Swindles et al., 2018).
2.3.2.2 
Exposure, Vulnerability and Impacts
2.3.2.2.1 Changes in exposure
Conﬁrming ﬁndings from SREX, there is high conﬁdence that the 
exposure of people and infrastructure to cryosphere hazards in high 
mountain regions has increased over recent decades, and this trend 
is expected to continue in the future (Figure 2.7). In some regions, 
tourism development has increased exposure, where often weakly 
regulated expansion of infrastructure such as roads, trails, and 
overnight lodging brought more visitors into remote valleys and 
exposed sites (Gardner et al., 2002; Uniyal, 2013). As an example 
for the consequences of increased exposure, many of the more 
than 350 fatalities resulting from the 2015 earthquake triggered 
snow-ice avalanche in Langtang, Nepal, were foreign trekkers and 
their local guides (Kargel et al., 2016). Further, several thousand 
religious pilgrims were killed during the 2013 Kedarnath glacier 
ﬂood disaster (State of Uttarakhand, Northern India) (Kala, 2014). 
The expansion of hydropower (Section 2.3.1) is another key factor, 
and in the Himalaya alone, up to two-thirds of the current and 
planned hydropower projects are located in the path of potential 
glacier ﬂoods (Schwanghart et al., 2016). Changes in exposure of 
local communities, for instance, through emigration driven by climate 
change related threats (Grau and Aide, 2007; Gosai and Sulewski, 
2014), or increased connectivity and quality of life in urban centres 
(Tiwari and Joshi, 2015), are complex and vary regionally. The effects 
of changes in exposure on labour migration and relocation of entire 
communities are discussed in Section 2.3.7.

2.3.2.2.2 Changes in vulnerability
Considering the wide ranging social, economic, and institutional 
factors that enable communities to adequately prepare for, respond 
to and recover from climate change impacts (Cutter and Morath, 
2013), there is limited evidence and high agreement that mountain 
communities, particularly within developing countries, are highly 
vulnerable to the adverse effects of enhanced cryosphere hazards. 
There are few studies that have systematically investigated the 
vulnerability of mountain communities to natural hazards (Carey 
et al., 2017). Coping capacities to withstand impacts from natural 
hazards in mountain communities are constrained due to a number 
of reasons. Fundamental weather and climate information is lacking 
to support both short-term early warning for imminent disasters, and 
long-term adaptation planning (Rohrer et al., 2013; Xenarios et al., 
2018). Communities may be politically and socially marginalised 
(Marston, 2008). Incomes are typically lower and opportunities 
for livelihood diversiﬁcation restricted (McDowell et al., 2013). 
Emergency responders can have difﬁculties accessing remote 
mountain valleys after disasters strike (Sati and Gahalaut, 2013). 
Cultural or social ties to the land can limit freedom of movement 
(Oliver-Smith, 1996). Conversely, there is evidence that some 
mountain communities exhibit enhanced levels of resilience, drawing 
on long-standing experience, and Indigenous knowledge and local 
knowledge (Cross-Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 1) gained over many 
centuries of living with extremes of climate and related disasters 
(Gardner and Dekens, 2006). In the absence of sufﬁcient data, few 
studies have considered temporal trends in vulnerability (Huggel 
et al., 2015a).
2.3.2.2.3 Impacts on livelihoods
Empirical evidence from past events shows that cryosphere 
related landslides and ﬂoods can have severe impacts on lives and 
livelihoods, often extending far beyond the directly affected region, 
and persisting for several years. Glacier lake outburst ﬂoods alone 
have over the past two centuries directly caused at least 400 deaths 
in Europe, 5,745 deaths in South America, and 6,300 deaths in Asia 
(Carrivick and Tweed, 2016), although these numbers are heavily 
skewed by individual large events occurring in Huaraz and Yungay, 
Peru (Carey, 2005) and Kedarnath, India (Allen et al., 2016b).
Economic losses associated with these events are incurred through 
two pathways. The ﬁrst consists of direct losses due to the disasters, 
and the second includes indirect costs from the additional risk and 
loss of potential opportunities, or from additional investment that 
would be necessary to manage or adapt to the challenges brought 
about by the cryosphere changes. Nationwide economic impacts from 
glacier ﬂoods have been greatest in Nepal and Bhutan (Carrivick and 
Tweed, 2016). The disruption of vital transportation corridors that can 
impact trading of goods and services (Gupta and Sah, 2008; Khanal 
et al., 2015), and the loss of earnings from tourism can represent 
signiﬁcant far-reaching and long-lasting impacts (Nothiger and 
Elsasser, 2004; IHCAP, 2017). The Dig Tsho ﬂood in the Khumbu Himal 
of Nepal in 1985 damaged a hydropower plant and other properties, 
with estimated economic losses of 500 million USD (Shrestha et al., 
2010). Less tangible, but equally important impacts concern the 
cultural and social disruption resulting from temporary or permanent 
evacuation (Oliver-Smith, 1979). According to the International 
Disaster – Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT), over the period 
1985–2014, absolute economic losses in mountain regions from all 
ﬂood and mass movements (including non-cryosphere origins) were 
highest in the Hindu Kush Himalaya region (45 billion USD), followed 
by the European Alps (7 billion USD), and the Andes (3 billion USD) 
(Stäubli et al., 2018). For example, a project to dig a channel in Tsho 
Rolpa glacier in Nepal that lowered a glacial lake cost 3  million 
USD in 2000 (Bajracharya, 2010), and similar measures have been 
taken at Imja Tsho Lake in Nepal in 2016 (Cuellar and McKinney, 
2017). Other impacts are related to drinking and irrigation water and 
livelihoods (Section 2.3.1). In summary, there is high conﬁdence that 
in the context of mountain ﬂood and landslide hazards, exposure, and 
vulnerability growing in the coming century, signiﬁcant risk reduction 
and adaptation strategies will be required to avoid increased impacts.
2.3.2.3 
Disaster Risk Reduction and Adaptation
There is medium conﬁdence that applying an integrative 
socioecological risk perspective to ﬂood, avalanche and landslide 
hazards in high mountain regions paves the way for adaptation 
strategies that can best address the underlying components of 
hazard, exposure and vulnerability (Carey et al., 2014; McDowell and 
Koppes, 2017; Allen et al., 2018; Vaidya et al., 2019). Some degree 
of adaptation action has been identiﬁed in a number of countries 
with glacier covered mountain ranges, mostly in the form of reactive 
responses (rather than formal anticipatory plans) to high mountain 
hazards (Xenarios et al., 2018; McDowell et al., 2019) (Figure 2.9). 
However, scientiﬁc literature reﬂecting on lessons learned from 
adaptation efforts generally remains scarce. Speciﬁcally for ﬂood and 
landslide hazards, adaptation strategies that were applied include: 
hard engineering solutions such as lowering of glacier lake levels, 
channel engineering, or slope stabilisation that reduce the hazard 
potential; nature-based solutions such as revegetation efforts to 
stabilise hazard prone slopes or channels; hazard and risk mapping 
as a basis for land zoning and early warning systems that reduce 
potential exposure; various community level interventions to develop 
disaster response programmes, build local capacities and reduce 
vulnerability. For example, there is a long tradition of engineered 
responses to reduce glacier ﬂood risk, most notably beginning in the 
mid-20th century in Peru (Box 2.4), Italian and Swiss Alps (Haeberli 
et al., 2001), and more recently in the Himalaya (Ives et al., 2010). 
There is no published evidence that avalanche risk management, 
through defence structures design and norms, control measures and 
warning systems, has been modiﬁed as an adaptation to climate 
change, over the past decades. Projected changes in avalanche 
character bear potential reductions of the effectiveness of current 
approaches for infrastructure design and avalanche risk management 
(Ancey and Bain, 2015).
Early warning systems necessitate strong local engagement and 
capacity building to ensure communities know how to prepare for and 
respond to emergencies, and to ensure the long-term sustainability 
of any such project. In Pakistan and Chile, for instance, glacier ﬂood 
warnings, evacuation and post-disaster relief have largely been 
community led (Ashraf et al., 2012; Anacona et al., 2015b).
164
Chapter 2 
High Mountain Areas

Cutter et al. (2012) highlight the post-recovery and reconstruction 
period as an opportunity to build new resilience and adaptive 
capacities. Ziegler et al. (2014) exemplify consequences when such 
process is rushed or poorly supported by appropriate long-term 
planning, as illustrated following the 2013 Kedarnath glacier ﬂood 
disaster, where guest houses and even schools were being rebuilt 
in the same exposed locations, driven by short-term perspectives. As 
changes in the mountain cryosphere, together with socioeconomic, 
cultural and political developments are producing conditions beyond 
historical precedent, related responses are suggested to include 
forward-thinking planning and anticipation of emerging risks and 
opportunities (Haeberli et al., 2016).
Researchers, 
policymakers, 
international 
donors 
and 
local 
communities do not always agree on the timing of disaster risk 
reduction projects and programs, impeding full coordination (Huggel 
et al., 2015b; Allen et al., 2018). Several authors highlight the value of 
improved evidential basis to underpin adaptation planning. Thereby, 
transdisciplinary and cross-regional collaboration that places human 
societies at the centre of studies provides a basis for more effective 
and sustainable adaptation strategies (McDowell et al., 2014; Carey 
et al., 2017; McDowell et al., 2019; Vaidya et al., 2019).
In summary, the evidence from regions affected by cryospheric ﬂoods, 
avalanches and landslides generally conﬁrms the ﬁndings from the 
SREX report (Chapter 3), including the requirement for multi-pronged 
approaches customised to local circumstances, integration of 
Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge (Cross-Chapter Box 4 
in Chapter 1) together with improved scientiﬁc understanding and 
technical capacities, strong local participation and early engagement 
in the process, and high-level communication and exchange between 
all actors. Particularly for mountain regions, there is high conﬁdence 
that integration of knowledge and practices across natural and social 
sciences, and the humanities, is most efﬁcient in addressing complex 
hazards and risks related to glaciers, snow, and permafrost.
Box 2.4 |  Challenges to Farmers and Local Population Related to Shrinkages in the  
Cryosphere: Cordillera Blanca, Peru
The Cordillera Blanca of Peru contains most of the glaciers in the tropics, and its glacier coverage declined signiﬁcantly in the recent 
past (Burns and Nolin, 2014; Mark et al., 2017). Since the 1940s, glacier hazards have killed thousands (Carey, 2005) and remain 
threatening. Glacier wastage has also reduced river runoff in most of its basins in recent decades, particularly in the dry season (Baraer 
et al., 2012; Vuille et al., 2018). Residents living adjacent to the Cordillera Blanca have long recognised this glacier shrinkage, including 
rural populations living near glaciers and urban residents worried about glacier lake ﬂoods and glacier landslides (Jurt et al., 2015; 
Walter, 2017). Glacier hazards and the glacier runoff variability increase exposure and uncertainty while diminishing adaptive capacity 
(Rasmussen, 2016).
Cordillera Blanca residents’ risk of glacier-related disasters is ampliﬁed by intersecting physical and societal factors. Cryosphere hazards 
include expanding or newly forming glacial lakes, slope instability, and other consequences of rising temperatures, and precipitation 
changes (Emmer et al., 2016; Colonia et al., 2017; Haeberli et al., 2017). Human vulnerability to these hazards is conditioned by 
factors such as poverty, limited political inﬂuence and resources, minimal access to education and healthcare, and weak government 
institutions (Hegglin and Huggel, 2008; Carey et al., 2012; Lynch, 2012; Carey et al., 2014; Heikkinen, 2017). Early warning systems 
have been, or are being, installed at glacial lakes Laguna 513 and Palcacocha to protect populations (Muñoz et al., 2016). Laguna 
513 was lowered by 20 m for outburst prevention in the early 1990s but nonetheless caused a destructive ﬂood in 2010, though 
much smaller and less destructive than a ﬂood that would have been expected without previous lake mitigation works (Carey et al., 
2012; Schneider et al., 2014). An early warning system was subsequently installed, but some local residents destroyed it in 2017 
due to political, social and cultural conﬂicts (Fraser, 2017). The nearby Lake Palcacocha also threatens populations (Wegner, 2014; 
Somos-Valenzuela et al., 2016). The usefulness for ground-level education and communication regarding advanced early warning 
systems has been demonstrated in Peru (Muñoz et al., 2016). 
Vulnerability to hydrologic variability and declining glacier runoff is also shaped by intertwining human and biophysical drivers playing 
out in dynamic hydro-social systems (Bury et al., 2013; Rasmussen 2016; Drenkhan et al., 2015; Carey et al., 2017). Water security is 
inﬂuenced by both water availability (supply from glaciers) as well as by water distribution, which is affected by factors such as water 
laws and policies, global demand for agricultural products grown in the lower Santa River basin, energy demands and hydroelectricity 
production, potable water usage, and livelihood transformations over time (Carey et al., 2014; Vuille et al., 2018). In some cases, the 
formation of new glacial lakes can create opportunities as well as hazards, such as new tourist attractions and reservoirs of water, 
thereby showing how socioeconomic and geophysical forces intersect in complex ways (Colonia et al., 2017).

Figure 2.8 |   Synthesis of observed physical changes and impacts on ecosystems and human systems and ecosystems services in eleven high mountain regions over past 
decades that can at least partly be attributed to changes in the cryosphere. Only observations documented in the scientiﬁc literature are shown, but impacts may also 
be experienced elsewhere. For physical changes yellow/green refers to an increase/decrease, respectively, in amount or frequency of the measured variable. For impacts 
on ecosystems and human systems and ecosystems services blue or red depicts whether an observed impact is positive (beneﬁcial) or negative (adverse). Cells assigned 
‘increase and decrease’ indicate that within that region both increase and decrease of physical changes are found, but are not necessarily equal; the same holds for cells 
showing ‘positive and negative’ impacts. Conﬁdence levels refer to conﬁdence in attribution to cryospheric changes. No assessment means: not applicable, not assessed at 
regional scale, or the evidence is insufﬁcient for assessment. Tundra refers to tundra and alpine meadows. Migration refers to an increase and decrease in net migration, 
not beneﬁcial/adverse value. Impacts on tourism refer to the operating conditions for the tourism sector. Cultural services include cultural identity, sense of home, intrinsic 
and aesthetic values, as well as contributions from glacier archaeology. Figure is based on observed impacts listed in Table SM2.11.
2.3.3 
Ecosystems
Widespread climate driven ecological changes have occurred in high 
mountain ecosystems over the past century. Those impacts were 
assessed in a dedicated manner only in earlier IPCC assessments 
(Beniston and Fox, 1996; Gitay et al., 2001; Fischlin et al., 2007) but 
not in AR5 (Settele et al., 2014). Two of the most evident changes 
include range shifts of plants and animals in Central Europe and the 
Himalaya but also for other mountain regions (e.g., Morueta-Holme 
et al., 2015; Evangelista et al., 2016; Freeman et al., 2018; Liang 
et al., 2018; You et al., 2018; He et al., 2019), and increases in 
species richness on mountain summits (Khamis et al., 2016; Fell 
et al., 2017; Steinbauer et al., 2018) of which some have accelerated 
during recent decades (e.g., Steinbauer et al., 2018), though slowing 
over the past ten years in Austria (e.g., Lamprecht et al., 2018). 
While many changes in freshwater communities have been directly 
attributed to changes in the cryosphere (Jacobsen et al., 2012; 
Milner et al., 2017), separating the direct inﬂuence of atmospheric 
warming from the inﬂuence of concomitant cryospheric change 
and independent biotic processes has been often challenging for 
terrestrial ecosystems (Grytnes et al., 2014; Lesica and Crone, 2016; 
Frei et al., 2018; Lamprecht et al., 2018). Changing climate in high 
mountains places further stress on biota, which are already impacted 
by land use and its change, direct exploitation, and pollutants (Díaz 
et al., 2019; Wester et al., 2019). Species are required to shift their 
behaviours, including seasonal aspects, and distributional ranges to 
track suitable climate conditions (Settele et al., 2014). In the Special 
Report on Global Warming of 1.5ºC (SR15), climate change scenarios 
exceeding mean global warming of 1.5º C relative to preindustrial 
levels have been estimated to lead to major impacts on species 
abundances, community structure, and ecosystem functioning in 
high mountain areas (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018). The size and 
isolation of mountain habitats (Steinbauer et al., 2016; Cotto et al., 
2017), which may vary strongly with the topography of mountain 
ridges (Elsen and Tingley, 2015; Graae et al., 2018), affects critically 
the survival of species as they migrate across mountain ranges, 
increasing in general the risks for many species from climate change 
(Settele et al., 2014; Dobrowski and Parks, 2016).
2.3.3.1 
Terrestrial Biota
The cryosphere can play a critical role in moderating and driving 
how species respond to climate change in high mountains (high 
conﬁdence). Many mountain plant and animal species have 
changed abundances and migrated upslope while expanding or 
contracting their ranges over the past decades to century, whereas 
others show no change (Morueta-Holme et al., 2015; Suding et al., 
2015; Lesica and Crone, 2016; Fadrique et al., 2018; Freeman et al., 
2018; Rumpf et al., 2018; Johnston et al., 2019; Rumpf et al., 2019) 
(medium agreement, robust evidence). These responses are often 
linked directly to warming, yet a changing cryosphere, for example, 
in the form of decreasing snow thickness or altered seasonality of 
snow (e.g., Matteodo et al., 2016; Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Amagai 
et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2018) or indirectly leading to changes in soil 
moisture (Harpold and Molotch, 2015), can play a signiﬁcant role 
for growth, ﬁtness and survival of many species (e.g., Grytnes et al., 
2014; Winkler et al., 2016) (medium evidence, high agreement).

ecosystem services, such as by provisioning new habitat for endemic 
plant species and increasing plant productivity (high conﬁdence). 
Decreasing snow cover duration, glacier retreat and permafrost 
thaw have already and will over coming decades allow plant species, 
including some endemic species, to increase their abundance and 
extend their range in many mountain ranges (Yang et al., 2010a; 
Grytnes et al., 2014; Elsen and Tingley, 2015; Dolezal et al., 2016; 
Wang et al., 2016b; D’Amico et al., 2017; Liang et al., 2018; Yang 
et al., 2018; You et al., 2018; He et al., 2019). Over recent decades, 
plant colonisation after glacier retreat has been swift, for example, 
at many sites with favourable soils in the European Alps (Matthews 
and Vater, 2015; Fickert and Grüninger, 2018) or has even accelerated 
compared to 100 years ago (Fickert et al., 2016). At other sites of 
the European Alps (D’Amico et al., 2017) and in other mountain 
ranges (e.g., Andes and Alaska; Darcy et al., 2018; Zimmer et al., 
2018) the rate of colonisation remains slow due to soil type, soil 
formation and phosphorous limitation (Darcy et al., 2018). In Bhutan, 
snowlines have ascended and new plant species have established 
themselves in these areas, yet despite range expansion and increased 
productivity, yak herders describe impacts on the ecosystem services 
as mostly negative (Wangchuk and Wangdi, 2018). Earlier snowmelt 
often leads to earlier plant growth and, provided there is sufﬁcient 
water, including from underlying permafrost, plant productivity has 
increased in many alpine regions (e.g., Williams et al., 2015; Yang 
et al., 2018). Decreased snow cover duration has led to colonisation 
of snowbed communities by wide-ranging species in several regions, 
for example, in the Australian Alps (Pickering et al., 2014), though 
this can lead to declines in the abundance of resident species, for 
example, in the Swiss Alps (Matteodo et al., 2016). 
Cryospheric change in high mountains directly harms some plant 
species and ecosystems in some regions, degrading a number 
of ecosystem services, such as maintaining regional and global 
biodiversity, and some provisioning services, for example, fodder 
or wood production, in terms of timing and magnitude (high 
conﬁdence). In mountains, microrefugia (a local environment 
different from surrounding areas) and isolation have contributed 
to high plant endemism that increases with elevation (Steinbauer 
et al., 2016; Zhang and Zhang, 2017; Muellner-Riehl, 2019). 
Microrefugia may enable alpine species to persist if global warming 
remains below 2˚C relative pre-industrial levels (Scherrer and 
Körner, 2011; Hannah et al., 2014; Graae et al., 2018) (medium 
evidence, medium agreement). Yet, where glaciers have been 
retreating over recent decades, cool microrefugia have shifted 
location or decreased in extent (Gentili et al., 2015). In regions with 
insufﬁcient summer precipitation, earlier snowmelt and absence 
of permafrost lead to insufﬁcient water supply during the growing 
season, and consequently an earlier end of peak season, altered 
species composition, and a decline in greenness or productivity 
(Trujillo et al., 2012; Sloat et al., 2015; Williams et al., 2015; 
Yang et al., 2018) (medium evidence, high agreement). Across 
elevations, alpine-restricted species show greater sensitivity to 
the timing of snowmelt than wide ranging species (Lesica, 2014; 
Winkler et al., 2018), and though the cause is often not known, 
some alpine-restricted species have declined in abundance or 
disappeared in regions with distinctive ﬂora (Evangelista et al., 
2016; Giménez-Benavides et al., 2018; Lamprecht et al., 2018; 
Panetta et al., 2018) (medium evidence, high agreement).
The shrinking cryosphere represents a loss of critical habitat for 
wildlife that depend on snow and ice cover, affecting well-known and 
unique high-elevation species (high conﬁdence). Areas with seasonal 
snow and glaciers are essential habitat for birds and mammals 
within mountain ecosystems for foraging, relief from climate stress, 
food caching and nesting grounds (Hall et al., 2016; Rosvold, 2016) 
(robust evidence). Above 5,000 m a.s.l. in Peru, there was recently 
a ﬁrst observation of bird nesting for which its nesting may be 
glacier obligate (Hardy et al., 2018). The insulated and thermally 
stable region under the snow at the soil-snow interface, termed 
the subnivean, has been affected by changing snowpack, limiting 
winter activity and decreasing population growth for some mountain 
animals, including frogs, rodents and small carnivores (Penczykowski 
et al., 2017; Zuckerberg and Pauli, 2018; Kissel et al., 2019) (medium 
evidence). Many mountain animals have been observed to change 
their behaviour in a subtle manner, for example., in foraging or 
hunting behaviour, due to cryospheric changes (e.g., Rosvold, 2016; 
Büntgen et al., 2017; Mahoney et al., 2018) (medium evidence, 
high agreement). In the Canadian Rocky Mountains, grizzly bears 
have moved to new snow free habitat after emerging in spring 
from hibernation to dig for forage, which may increase the risk of 
human-bear encounters (Berman et al., 2019). In the US Central Rocky 
Mountains, migratory herbivores, such as elk, moose and bison, track 
newly emergent vegetation that greens soon after snowmelt (Merkle 
et al., 2016). For elk, this was found to increase fat gain (Middleton 
et al., 2018). Due to loss of snow patches that increase surface water 
and thus insect abundance, some mammal species, for example, 
reindeer and ibex, have changed their foraging behaviour to evade 
the biting insects with negative impacts on reproductive ﬁtness (Vors 
and Boyce, 2009; Büntgen et al., 2017). 
Many endemic plant and animal species including mammals and 
invertebrates in high mountain regions are vulnerable to further 
decreasing snow cover duration, such as later onset of snow 
accumulation and/or earlier snowmelt (high conﬁdence) (Williams 
et al., 2015; Slatyer et al., 2017). Winter-white animals for which coat 
or plumage colour is cued by day length will confront more days 
with brown snowless ground (Zimova et al., 2018), which has already 
contributed to range contractions for several species, including hares 
and ptarmigan (Imperio et al., 2013; Sultaire et al., 2016; Pedersen 
et al., 2017) (robust evidence). Under all climate scenarios, the 
duration of this camouﬂage mismatch will increase, enhancing 
predation rates thereby decreasing populations of coat-colour 
changing species (e.g., 24% decrease by late century under RCP8.5 
for snowshoe hares; Zimova et al., 2016; see also Atmeh et al., 2018) 
(medium evidence, high agreement). For roe deer (Plard et al., 2014) 
and mountain goats (White et al., 2017), climate driven changes in 
snowmelt duration and summer temperatures will reduce survival 
considerably under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios (medium evidence, 
high agreement).

2.3.3.2 
Freshwater Biota
Biota in mountain freshwater ecosystems is affected by cryospheric 
change through alterations in both the quantity and timing of 
runoff from glaciers and snowmelt. Where melt water from glaciers 
decreases, river ﬂows have become more variable, with water 
temperature and overall channel stability increasing and habitats 
becoming less complex (Giersch et al., 2017; Milner et al., 2017) 
(medium evidence, medium agreement).
Analysis of three invertebrate datasets from tropical (Ecuador), 
temperate (Italian Alps) and sub-Arctic (Iceland) alpine regions 
indicates that a number of cold-adapted species have decreased in 
abundance below a threshold of watershed glacier cover varying 
from 19–32%. With complete loss of the glaciers, 11–38% of the 
regional species will be lost (Jacobsen et al., 2012; Milner et al., 2017) 
(medium conﬁdence). As evidenced in Europe (Pyrenees, Italian Alps) 
and North America (Rocky Mountains) (Brown et al., 2007; Giersch 
et al., 2015; Giersch et al., 2017; Lencioni, 2018) the loss of these 
invertebrates – many of them endemic – as glacier runoff decreases 
and transitions to a regime more dominated by snowmelt leading 
to a reduction in turnover between and within stream reaches (beta 
diversity) and regional (gamma) diversity (very high conﬁdence). 
Regional genetic diversity within individual riverine invertebrate 
species in mountain headwater areas has decreased with the loss 
of environmental heterogeneity (Giersch et al., 2017), as decreasing 
glacier runoff reduces the isolation of individuals permitting a greater 
degree of genetic intermixing (Finn et al., 2013; Finn et al., 2016; 
Jordan et al., 2016; Hotaling et al., 2018) (medium evidence, high 
agreement). However, local (alpha) diversity, dominated by generalist 
species of invertebrates and algae, has increased (Khamis et al., 
2016; Fell et al., 2017; Brown et al., 2018) (very high conﬁdence) in 
certain regions as species move upstream, although not in the Andes, 
where downstream migration has been observed (Jacobsen et al., 
2014; Cauvy-Fraunié et al., 2016). 
Many climate variables inﬂuence ﬁsheries, through both direct and 
indirect pathways. The key variables linked to cryospheric change 
include: changes in air and water temperature, precipitation, nutrient 
levels and ice cover (Stenseth et al., 2003). A shrinking cryosphere has 
signiﬁcantly affected cold mountain resident salmonids (e.g., brook 
trout, Salvelinus fontinalis), causing further migration upstream in 
summer thereby shrinking their range (Hari et al., 2006; Eby et al., 
2014; Young et al., 2018). Within the Yanamarey watershed of the 
Cordillera Blanca in Peru, ﬁsh stocks have either declined markedly 
or have become extinct in many streams, possibly due to seasonal 
reductions of ﬁsh habitat in the upper watershed resulting from 
glacier recession (Bury et al., 2011; Vuille et al., 2018). In contrast, 
glacier recession in the mountains of coastal Alaska and to a lesser 
extent the Paciﬁc northwest have created a large number of new 
stream systems that have been, and could continue to be with 
further glacier retreat, colonised from the sea by salmon species 
that contribute to both commercial and sport ﬁsheries (Milner et al., 
2017; Schoen et al., 2017) (medium conﬁdence). Changes in water 
temperature will vary seasonally, and a potential decreased frequency 
of rain-on-snow events in winter compared to rain-on-ground would 
increase water temperature, beneﬁting overwintering survival (Leach 
and Moore, 2014). Increased water temperature remaining below 
thermal tolerance limits for ﬁsh and occurring earlier in the year can 
beneﬁt overall ﬁsh growth and increase ﬁtness (Comola et al., 2015) 
(medium evidence, medium agreement).
In the future, increased primary production dominated by diatoms 
and golden algae will occur in streams as glacier runoff decreases, 
although some cold-tolerant diatom species will be lost, resulting in 
a decrease in regional diversity (Fell et al., 2017; Fell et al., 2018). 
Reduced glacier runoff is projected to improve water clarity in 
many mountain lakes, increasing biotic diversity and the abundance 
of bacterial and algal communities and thus primary production 
(Peter and Sommaruga, 2016) (limited evidence). Extinction of 
range-restricted prey species may increase as more favourable 
conditions facilitate the upstream movement of large bodied 
invertebrate predators (Khamis et al., 2015) (medium conﬁdence). 
Modelling studies indicate a reduction in the range of native species, 
notably trout, in mountain streams, (Papadaki et al., 2016; Vigano 
et al., 2016; Young et al., 2018) (medium evidence, high agreement), 
which will potentially impact sport ﬁsheries. In northwest North 
America, where salmon are important in native subsistence as well 
as commercial and sport ﬁsheries, all species will potentially be 
affected by reductions in glacial runoff from mountain glaciers over 
time (Milner et al., 2017; Schoen et al., 2017), particularly in larger 
systems where migratory corridors to spawning grounds are reduced 
(medium conﬁdence). 
In summary, cryospheric change will alter freshwater communities 
with increases in local biodiversity but range shrinkage and 
extinctions for some species causes regional biodiversity to decrease 
(robust evidence, medium agreement, i.e., high conﬁdence).
2.3.3.3 
Ecosystem Services and Adaptation
The trend to a higher productivity in high mountain ecosystems due to 
a warmer environment and cryospheric changes, affects provisioning 
and regulating services (high conﬁdence). Due to earlier snowmelt, 
the growing season has begun earlier, for example, on the Tibetan 
Plateau, and in the Swiss Alps (Wang et al., 2017; Xie et al., 2018), 
and in some regions earlier growth has been linked to greater plant 
production or greater net ecosystem production, possibly affecting 
carbon uptake (Scholz et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2018). 
In other areas productivity has decreased, despite a longer growing 
season, for example, in the US Rocky Mountains, US Sierra Nevada 
Mountains, Swiss Alps, and Tibetan Plateau (Arnold et al., 2014; Sloat 
et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2017; De Boeck et al., 2018; Knowles et al., 
2018) (robust evidence, medium agreement). Changed productivity 
of the vegetation in turn can affect the timing, quantity and quality 
of water supply, a critical regulating service ecosystems play in high 
mountain areas (Goulden and Bales, 2014; Hubbard et al., 2018) 
(medium conﬁdence). Permafrost degradation has dramatically 
changed some alpine ecosystems through altered soil temperature 
and permeability, decreasing the climate regulating service of a vast 
region and leading to lowered ground water and new and shrinking 
lakes on the Tibetan Plateau (Jin et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2010b; Shen 
et al., 2018) (medium evidence, high agreement).

Ecosystems and their services are vulnerable to changes in the 
intensity and/or the frequency of an ecological disturbance that exceed 
the previous range of variation (Johnstone et al., 2016; Camac et al., 
2017; Fairman et al., 2017); cf. 3.4.3.2 Ecosystems and their Services) 
(high conﬁdence). For example, in the Western USA, mountain 
ecosystems are experiencing an increase in the number and extent 
of wildﬁres, which have been attributed to many factors, including 
climate factors such as earlier snowmelt and vapour-pressure deﬁcit 
(Settele et al., 2014; Westerling, 2016; Kitzberger et al., 2017; Littell, 
2018; Littell et al., 2018). Similarly, landslides and ﬂoods in many 
areas have been attributed to cryospheric changes (Section 2.3.2). 
Disturbances can feedback and diminish many of the ecosystem 
services such as provisioning, regulating and cultural services (Millar 
and Stephenson, 2015; McDowell and Koppes, 2017; Mcdowell et al., 
2018; Murphy et al., 2018; Maxwell et al., 2019). Consistent with AR5 
ﬁndings (Settele et al., 2014) the capacity of many freshwater and 
terrestrial mountain species to adapt naturally to climate change is 
projected to be exceeded for high warming levels, leading to species 
migration across mountain ranges or loss with consequences for 
many ecosystem services (Elsen and Tingley, 2015; Dobrowski and 
Parks, 2016; Pecl et al., 2017; Rumpf et al., 2019) (robust evidence, 
medium agreement, i.e.,  high conﬁdence). Although the adaptive 
potential of aquatic biota to projected changes in glacial runoff is not 
fully understood (Lencioni et al., 2015), dispersion and phenotypic 
plasticity together with additional microrefugia formation due to 
cryospheric changes, is expected to help threatened species to better 
adapt, perhaps even in the long term (Shama and Robinson, 2009). 
Likewise, traits shaped by climate and with high genetically-based 
standing variation may be used to spatially identify, map and manage 
global ‘hotspots’ for evolutionary rescue from climate change (Jones 
et al., 2018; Mills et al., 2018). Nature conservation increases the 
potential for mitigating adverse effects on many of these ecosystem 
services, including those that are essential for the support of the 
livelihoods and the culture of mountain peoples, including economical 
aspects such as recreation and tourism (e.g., Palomo, 2017; Elsen 
et al., 2018; Wester et al., 2019) (medium conﬁdence). 
2.3.4 
Infrastructure and Mining
There is high conﬁdence that permafrost thaw has had negative 
impacts on the integrity of infrastructure in high mountain areas. Like 
in polar regions (Section 3.4.3.3.4), the local effects of infrastructure 
together with climate change degraded permafrost beneath and 
around structures (Dall’Amico et al., 2011; Doré et al., 2016) 
Infrastructure on permafrost in the European Alps, mostly found near 
mountain summits but not in major valleys, has been destabilised by 
permafrost thaw, including mountain stations in France and Austria 
(Ravanel et al., 2013; Keuschnig et al., 2015; Duvillard et al., 2019) 
as well as avalanche defence structures (Phillips and Margreth, 
2008) and a ski lift (Phillips et al., 2007) in Switzerland. On the 
Tibetan Plateau, deformation or damage has been found on roads 
(Yu et al., 2013; Chai et al., 2018), power transmission infrastructure 
(Guo et al., 2016) and around an oil pipeline (Yu et al., 2016). For 
infrastructure on permafrost, engineering practices suitable for 
polar and high mountain environments (Doré et al., 2016) as well as 
speciﬁc for steep terrain (Bommer et al., 2010) have been developed 
to support adaptation.
In some mountain regions, glacier retreat and related processes 
of change in the cryosphere have afforded greater accessibility for 
extractive industries and related activities to mine minerals and 
metals (medium conﬁdence). Accelerated glacier shrinkage and 
retreat have been reported to facilitate mining activities in Chile, 
Argentina and Peru (Brenning, 2008; Brenning and Azócar, 2010; 
Anacona et al., 2018), and Kyrgyzstan (Kronenberg, 2013; Petrakov 
et al., 2016), which also interact with and have consequences for 
other social, cultural, economic, political and legal measures, where 
climate change impacts also play a role (Brenning and Azócar, 2010; 
Evans et al., 2016; Khadim, 2016; Anacona et al., 2018). However, 
negative impacts due to cryosphere changes may also occur. One 
study projects that reductions in glacier melt water and snowmelt in 
the watershed in the Chilean Andes will lead to a reduction of water 
supply to a copper mine by 2075–2100 of 28% under scenario A2 and 
of 6% under B2; construction of infrastructure to draw water from 
other sources will cost between 16–137 million USD (Correa-Ibanez 
et al., 2018).
Conversely, there is also evidence suggesting that some of these 
mining activities affect glaciers locally, and the mountain environment 
around them, further altering glacier dynamics, glacier structure and 
permafrost degradation. This is due mainly to excavation, extraction, 
and use of explosives (Brenning, 2008; Brenning and Azócar, 2010; 
Kronenberg, 2013), and deposition of dust and other mine waste 
material close to or top of glaciers during extraction and transportation 
(Brenning, 2008; Torgoev and Omorov, 2014; Arenson et al., 2015b; 
Jamieson et al., 2015). These activities have reportedly generated slope 
instabilities (Brenning, 2008; Brenning and Azócar, 2010; Torgoev and 
Omorov, 2014), glacier mass loss due to enhanced surface melt from 
dust and debris deposition (Torgoev and Omorov, 2014; Arenson et al., 
2015b; Petrakov et al., 2016), and even glacier advance by several 
kilometres (Jamieson et al., 2015), although their impact is considered 
less than that reported for changes in glaciers due to climatic change 
(limited evidence, medium agreement). Glacier Protection Laws and 
similar measures have been introduced in countries such as Chile and 
Argentina to address these impacts (Khadim, 2016; Anacona et al., 
2018; Navarro et al., 2018). In addition, the United Nations Human 
Rights Council passed a declaration in 2018 to “protect and restore 
water-related ecosystems” in mountain areas as elsewhere from 
contamination by mining (UNHRC, 2018); however, evidence on the 
effectiveness of these measures remains inconclusive.
2.3.5 
Tourism and Recreation
The mountain cryosphere provides important aesthetic, cultural, and 
recreational services to society (Xiao et al., 2015). These services 
support tourism, providing economic contributions and livelihood 
options to mountain communities and beyond. The relevant changes 
in the cryosphere affecting mountain tourism and recreation include 
shorter seasons of snow cover, more winter precipitation falling 
as rain instead of snow, and declining glaciers and permafrost

(Sections  2.2.1, 2.2.2, 2.2.3 and 2.2.4). Downhill skiing, the most 
popular form of snow recreation, occurs in 67 countries (Vanat, 2018). 
The Alps in Europe support the largest ski industry (Vanat, 2018). In 
Europe, the growth of alpine skiing and winter tourism after 1930 
brought major economic growth to alpine regions and transformed 
winter sports into a multi-billion USD industry (Denning, 2014). 
Sixteen percent of skier visits occur in the USA, where expenditures 
from all recreational snow sports generated more than 695,000 
jobs and 72.7 billion USD in trip-related spending in 2016 (Outdoor 
Industry Association, 2017). While the number of ski resorts in the 
USA has been decreasing since the 1980s, China added 57 new ski 
resorts in 2017 (Vanat, 2018). Although the bulk of economic activity 
is held within mountain communities, supply chains for production 
of ski equipment and apparel span the globe. Steiger et al. (2017) 
point out that Asia, Africa and South America are underrepresented 
in the ski tourism literature, and Africa and the Middle East are not 
signiﬁcant markets from a ski tourism perspective.
Skiing’s reliance on favourable atmospheric and snow conditions 
make it particularly vulnerable to climate change (Arent et al., 2014; 
Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018). Snow reliability, although not universally 
deﬁned, quantiﬁes whether the snow cover is sufﬁcient for ski resorts 
operations. Depending on the context, it focuses on speciﬁc periods 
of the winter season, and may account for interannual variability 
and/or for snow management (Steiger et al., 2017). The effects of 
less snow, due to strong correlation between snow cover and skier 
visits, cost the USA economy 1 billion USD and 17,400 jobs per year 
between 2001–2016 in years of less seasonal snow (Hagenstad et al., 
2018). Efforts to reduce climate change impacts and risks to economic 
losses focus on increased snowmaking, such as artiﬁcial production 
of snow (Steiger et al., 2017), summertime slope preparation (Pintaldi 
et al., 2017), grooming (Steiger et al., 2017), and snow farming, that 
is, storage of snow (Grünewald et al., 2018). The effectiveness of 
snow management methods as adaptation to long-term climate 
change depends on sufﬁciently low air temperature conditions 
needed for snowmaking, water and energy availability, compliance 
with environmental regulations (de Jong, 2015), and ability to pay 
for investment and operating costs. When these requirements are 
met, evidence over the past decades shows that snow management 
methods have generally proven efﬁcient in reducing the impact of 
reduced natural snow cover duration for many resorts (Dawson and 
Scott, 2013; Hopkins and Maclean, 2014; Steiger et al., 2017; Spandre 
et al., 2019a). The number of skier visits was found to be 39% less 
sensitive to natural snow variations in Swiss ski resorts with 30% 
areal snowmaking coverage (representing the national average), 
compared to resorts without snowmaking (Gonseth, 2013). In some 
regions, many resorts (mostly smaller, low-elevation resorts) have 
closed due to unfavourable snow conditions brought on by climate 
change and/or the associated need for large capital investments for 
snowmaking capacities (e.g., in northeast USA; Beaudin and Huang, 
2014). To offset loss in ski tourism revenue, a key adaptation strategy 
is diversiﬁcation, offering other non-snow recreation options such 
as mountain biking, mountain coasters and alpine slides, indoor 
climbing walls and water parks, festivals and other special events 
(Figure 2.9; Hagenstad et al., 2018; Da Silva et al., 2019).
In the near term (2031–2050) and regardless of the greenhouse gas 
emission scenario, risks to snow reliability exist for many resorts, 
especially at lower elevation, although snow reliability is projected 
to be maintained at many resorts in North America (Wobus et al., 
2017) and in the European Alps, Pyrenees and  Scandinavia (Marke 
et al., 2015; Steiger et al., 2017; Scott et al., 2019; Spandre et al., 
2019a; Spandre et al., 2019b). At the end of the century (2081–2100), 
under RCP8.5, snow reliability is projected to be unviable for most 
ski resorts under current operating practices in North America, the 
European Alps and Pyrenees, Scandinavia and Japan, with some 
exceptions at high elevation or high-latitudes (Steiger et al., 2017; 
Wobus et al., 2017; Suzuki-Parker et al., 2018; Scott et al., 2019; 
Spandre et al., 2019a; Spandre et al., 2019b). Only few studies have 
used RCP2.6 in the context of ski tourism, and results indicate that 
the risks at the end of the century (2081–2100) are expected to be 
similar to the near term impacts (2031–2050) for RCP8.5 (Scott et al., 
2019; Spandre et al., 2019a).
The projected economic losses reported in the literature include 
an annual loss in hotel revenues of EUR 560 million  (2012 value) 
in Europe, compared to the period 1971–2000 under a 2ºC global 
warming scenario (Damm et al., 2017). This estimate includes 
population projections but does not account for snow management. 
In the USA, Wobus et al. (2017) estimate annual revenue losses from 
tickets (skiing) and day fees (cross country skiing and snowmobiling) 
due to reduced snow season length, will range from 340–780 million 
USD in 2050 for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively, and from 130 million 
to 2 billion USD in 2090 for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 respectively, taking 
into account snow management and population projections. Total 
economic losses from these studies would be much higher if all 
costs were included (costs for tickets, transport, lodging, food and 
equipment). Regardless of the climate scenario, as risk of ﬁnancial 
unviability increases, there are reported expectations that companies 
would need to forecast when their assets may become stranded 
assets and require devaluation or conversion to liabilities, and 
report this on their balance sheets (Caldecott et al., 2016). Economic 
impacts are projected to occur in other snow-based winter activities 
including events (e.g.,  ski races) and other recreation activities 
such as cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, backcountry skiing, ice 
climbing, sledding, snowmobiling and snow tubing. By 2050, 13 (out 
of 21) prior Olympic Winter Games locations are projected to exhibit 
adequate snow reliability under RCP2.6, and 10 under RCP8.5. By 
2080, the number decreases to 12 and 8, respectively (Scott et al., 
2018). Even for cities remaining cold enough to host ski competitions, 
costs are projected to rise for making and stockpiling snow, as was 
the case in Sochi, Russia in 2014 and Vancouver, Canada in 2010 
(Scott et al., 2018), and preserving race courses through salting 
(Hagenstad et al., 2018).
In summer, cryosphere changes are impacting glacier-related 
activities (hiking, sightseeing, skiing, climbing and mountaineering) 
(Figure 2.8). In recent years, several ski resorts operating on glaciers 
have ceased summer operations due to unfavourable snow conditions 
and excessive operating costs (e.g., Falk, 2016). Snow management 
and snowmaking are increasingly used on glaciers (Fischer et al., 
2016). Glacier retreat has led to increased moraine instability which 
can compromise hiker and climber safety along established trails and 
common access routes, for example, in Iceland (Welling et al., 2019), 
though it has made some areas in the Peruvian Andes more accessible 
to trekkers (Vuille et al., 2018). In response, some hiking routes have 
170
Chapter 2 
High Mountain Areas
2
been adjusted and ladders and ﬁxed anchors installed (Duvillard et al., 
2015; Mourey and Ravanel, 2017). As permafrost thaws, rock falls on 
and off glaciers are increasingly observed, threatening the safety of 
hikers and mountaineers, for example, in Switzerland (Temme, 2015) 
and New Zealand (Purdie et al., 2015). Glacier retreat and permafrost 
thaw have induced major changes to iconic mountaineering routes in 
the Mont Blanc area, European Alps with impacts on mountaineering 
practices, such as shifts in suitable climbing seasons, and reduced 
route safety (Mourey and Ravanel, 2017; Mourey et al., 2019). 
Cryosphere decline has also reduced opportunities for ice climbing 
and reduced attractions for summer trekking in the Cascade 
Mountains, USA (Orlove et al., 2019). In response to these impacts, 
tour companies have shifted to new sites, diversiﬁed to offer other 
activities or simply reduced their activities (Furunes and Mykletun, 
2012) (Figure 2.9). Steps to improve consultation and participatory 
approaches to understand risk perception and design joint action 
between affected communities, authorities and operators, are 
evident, for example, in Iceland (Welling et al., 2019). In some cases, 
new opportunities are presented such as marketing ‘climate change 
tourism’ where visitors are attracted by ‘last chance’ opportunities to 
view a glacier; for example, in New Zealand (Stewart et al., 2016), in 
China (Wang et al., 2010) or through changing landscapes such as 
new lakes, for instance in Iceland (Þórhallsdóttir and Ólafsson, 2017), 
or to view the loss of a glacier, for example, in the Bolivian Andes 
(Kaenzig et al., 2016). The opening of a trekking route promoting this 
opportunity created tensions between a National Park and a local 
indigenous community in the Peruvian Andes over the management 
and allocation of revenue from the route (Rasmussen, 2019). The 
consequences of ongoing and future glacier retreat are projected 
to negatively impact trekking and mountaineering in the Himalaya 
(Watson and King, 2018). Reduced snow cover has also negatively 
impacted trekking in the Himalaya, since tourists ﬁnd the mountains

less attractive as a destination, and the reduced water availability 
affects the ability of hotels and campsites to serve visitors (Becken 
et al., 2013).
In summary, ﬁnancial risks to mountain communities that depend 
on tourism for income, are high and include losses to revenues 
generated from recreation primarily in the winter season. Adaptation 
to cryosphere change for ski tourism focuses on snowmaking and is 
expected to be moderately effective for many locations in the near 
term (2031–2050), but it is unlikely to substantially reduce the risks in 
most locations in the longer term (end of century) (high conﬁdence). 
Determining the extent to which glacier retreat and permafrost thaw 
impact upon overall visitor numbers in summer tourism, and how any 
losses or increased costs are offset by opportunities, is inconclusive. 
Furthermore, tourism is also impacted by cryospheric change that 
impacts on water resources availability, increasing competition for 
its use (Section 2.3.1.3).
2.3.6 
Cultural Values and Human Well-being
Cryosphere changes also impact cultural values, which are held by 
populations in high mountains and other regions around the world; 
these impacts often harm human well-being (Tschakert et al., 2019) 
(medium evidence, high agreement). Cultural values were covered 
extensively in AR5, with particular emphasis on small island states 
and the Arctic; the research on cultural values in high mountain 
regions is relatively new. Out of a total of 247 UNESCO World 
Heritage natural sites recognised for their outstanding universal 
value, 46 sites include glaciers within their boundaries, where the 
presence of glaciers is stated among the principal reason (5 sites), or 
secondary reason (28 sites), for World Heritage inscription; complete 
glacier extinction is projected by 2100 in 8 to 21 of these sites, 
under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively, compromising the 
outstanding universal value placed on these sites, which have been 
inscribed at least partly for their exceptional glaciers (Bosson et al., 
2019). UNESCO deﬁnes “outstanding universal value” as “cultural 
and/or natural signiﬁcance which is so exceptional as to transcend 
national boundaries and to be of common importance for present and 
future generations of all humanity” (UNESCO, 2012). Furthermore, in 
recognising the importance of the cultural and intangible value placed 
by communities on aspects of their surrounding environment, such as 
those afforded by cryosphere elements in the high mountains, cultural 
values are mentioned under the workplan of the Warsaw International 
Mechanism as a speciﬁc work area under ‘Non-economic loss and 
damage’ (UNFCCC Secretariat, 2014; Serdeczny, 2019).
Cultural values include spiritual, intrinsic and existence values, as well 
as aesthetic dimensions, which are also an element of tourism and 
recreation (Section 2.3.5), though they focus more directly on ties 
to sacred beings or to inherent rights of entities to exist. However, 
these values overlap, since the visual appeal of natural landscapes 
links with a sense of the immensity of mountain landscapes, glaciers 
and fresh snow (Paden et al., 2013; Gagné et al., 2014). Moreover, 
different stakeholders, such as local communities, tourists and 
policymakers, may place different emphasis on speciﬁc cultural values 
(Schirpke et al., 2016). For the indigenous Manangi community of the 
Annapurna Conservation Area of Nepal, the loss of glaciers which 
they have observed threatens their ethnic identity (Konchar et al., 
2015). Villagers in the Italian Alps also report that glacier retreat 
weakens their identity (Jurt et al., 2015).
Spiritual and intrinsic values in high mountain regions often, but 
not exclusively, rest on deeply held religious beliefs and other local 
customs (medium evidence, high agreement). Some communities 
understand mountains through a religious framework (Bernbaum, 
2006). In settings as diverse as the Peruvian Andes, the Nepal 
Himalaya, the European Alps, the North Cascades (USA), Mount 
Kilimanjaro and the Hengduan Mountains of southwest China, local 
populations view glacier retreat as the product of their failure to show 
respect to sacred beings or to follow proper conduct. Experiencing 
deep concern that they have disturbed cosmic order, they seek to 
behave in closer accord with established traditions; they anticipate 
that the retreat will continue, leading to further environmental 
degradation and to the decline of natural and social orders  – a 
prospect which causes them distress (Becken et al., 2013; Gagné 
et al., 2014; Allison, 2015). In the USA, the snow covered peaks of the 
Cascades have also evoked a deep sense of awe and majesty, and 
an obligation to protect them (Carroll, 2012; Duntley, 2015). Similar 
views are found in the Italian Alps, where villagers speak of treating 
glacier peaks with “respect,” and state that glacier retreat is due, 
at least in part, to humans “disturbing” the glaciers (Brugger et al., 
2013), resulting in an emotion which Albrecht et al. (2007) termed 
solastalgia, a kind of deep environmental distress or ecological grief 
(Cunsolo and Ellis, 2018).
Glacier retreat threatens the Indigenous knowledge and local 
knowledge of populations in mountain regions; this knowledge 
constitutes a cultural service to wider society by contributing 
to scientiﬁc understanding of glaciers (Cross-Chapter Box  4 
in Chapter  1). Though this knowledge is dynamic, and records 
previous states of glaciers, it has been undermined by the complete 
disappearance of glaciers in a local area (Rhoades et al., 2008). This 
knowledge of glaciers is often tied to religious beliefs and practices. 
It is based on direct observation, stories passed down from one 
generation to another within community, placenames, locations 
of structures and other sources (Gagné et al., 2014). Residents of 
mountain areas can provide dates for previous locations of glacier 
fronts, sometimes documenting these locations through the presence 
of structures (Brugger et al., 2013). Much like other cases of data 
from citizen science (Theobald et al., 2015), their observations often 
overlap with the record of instrumental observations (Deng et al., 
2012), and can signiﬁcantly extend this record (Mark et al., 2010).
An additional cultural value is the contribution of glaciers to the 
understanding of human history. Glacier retreat has supported 
the increase of knowledge of past societies by providing access 
to archaeological materials and other cultural resources that had 
previously been covered by ice. The discovery of Oetzi, a mummiﬁed 
Bronze Age man whose remains were discovered in 1991 in the Alps 
near the Italian-Austrian border, marked the beginning of scientiﬁc 
research with such materials (Putzer and Festi, 2014). Subsequent 
papers described objects that were uncovered in retreating glaciers 
and shrinking ice patches in the Wrangell-Saint Elias Range (Dixon

et al., 2005), the Rocky Mountains (Lee, 2012) and Norway (Bjørgo 
et al., 2016). This ﬁeld provides new insight into human cultural 
history and contributes to global awareness of climate change (Dixon 
et al., 2014). Though climate change permits the discovery of new 
artefacts and sites, it also threatens these objects and places, since 
they become newly exposed to harsh weather (Callanan, 2016).
2.3.7 
Migration, Habitability and Livelihoods
High mountain communities have historically included mobility 
in their sets of livelihood strategies, as a means to gain access to 
production zones at different elevations within mountain zones 
and in lowland areas, and as a response to the strong seasonality 
of agricultural and pastoral livelihoods. Cryosphere changes in high 
mountain areas have inﬂuenced human mobility and migration 
during this century by altering water availability and increasing 
exposure to mass movements and ﬂoods and other cryospheric 
induced disasters (Figure 2.7) (Barnett et al., 2005; Carey et al., 2017; 
Rasul and Molden, 2019). These changes affect three forms of human 
mobility: transhumant pastoralism, temporary or permanent wage 
labour migration and displacement, in which entire communities 
resettle in new areas.
Transhumant pastoralism, involving movements between summer 
and winter pastures, is a centuries old practice in high mountain 
areas (Lozny, 2013). In High Mountain Asia and other regions, it is 
declining due to both climatic factors, including changes in snow 
distribution and glaciers, and to non-climatic factors, and is projected 
to continue declining, at least in the short term (medium evidence, 
high agreement). The changes in snow and glaciers adversely affect 
herders at their summer residences and winter camps in the Himalaya 
(Namgay et al., 2014) and in Scandinavian mountains (Mallory and 
Boyce, 2018). Reduced winter snowfall has led to poorer pasture 
quality in Nepal (Gentle and Maraseni, 2012) and India (Ingty, 2017). 
Other climate change impacts, including erratic snowfall patterns 
and a decrease in rainfall, are perceived by herders in Afghanistan, 
Nepal and Pakistan to have resulted in vegetation of lower quality 
and quantity (Shaoliang et al., 2012; Joshi et al., 2013; Gentle and 
Thwaites, 2016). Heavy snowfall incidents in winter caused deaths of 
a large number of livestock in northern Pakistan in 2009 (Shaoliang 
et al., 2012). Herders in Nepal reported of water scarcity in traditional 
water sources along migration routes (Gentle and Thwaites, 2016). 
Increased glacier melt water has caused lakes on the Tibetan Plateau 
to increase in size, covering pasture areas and leading pastoralists 
to alter their patterns of seasonal movement (Nyima and Hopping, 
2019). However, rising temperatures, with associated effects on snow 
cover, have some positive impacts. Seasonal migration from winter 
to summer pastures start earlier in Northern Pakistan, and residence 
in summer pasture lasts longer (Joshi et al., 2013), as it does in 
Afghanistan (Shaoliang et al., 2012).
Wage labour migration is also a centuries old practice in the 
Himalaya, the Andes and the European Alps (Macfarlane, 1976; Cole, 
1985; Viazzo, 1989). Studies show that migration is a second-order 
effect of cryosphere changes, since the ﬁrst-order effects, a decrease 
in agricultural production (Section 2.3.1.3.2), have led to increased 
wage labour migration to provide supplementary income in a number 
of regions (medium evidence, high agreement). Wage labour 
migration linked to cryosphere changes occurs on several time scales, 
including short-term, long-term and permanent migration, and on 
different spatial scales. Though migration usually takes place within 
the country of origin, and sometimes within the region, cases of 
international migration have also been recorded (Merrey et al., 2018). 
The studies since AR5 on migration driven by cryosphere changes 
are concentrated in High Mountain Asia and the Andes, supporting 
the ﬁnding, reported in AR5 Working Group II (Section 12.7), that 
stress on livelihoods is an important driver of climate change induced 
migration. The research on such migration also supports the ﬁnding 
in SR15 (Section 4.3.5.6) that migration can have mixed outcomes 
on reducing socioeconomic vulnerability, since cases of increase and 
of reduction of vulnerability are both found in migration from high 
mountain regions that is driven by cryosphere changes. 
Changing water availability, mass movements and ﬂoods are 
cryosphere processes which drive wage labour migration (medium 
evidence, high agreement). A debris ﬂow in central Nepal in 2014, in 
a region where landslides have increased in recent decades, led more 
than half the households to migrate for months (van der Geest and 
Schindler, 2016). In the Santa River drainage, Peru, rural populations 
have declined 10% between 1970–2000, and the area of several 
major subsistence crops also declined (Bury et al., 2013). Research in 
this region suggests that seasonal wage labour migration from small 
basins within the main Santa basin is largest in the small drainages in 
which glacier retreat has reduced melt water ﬂow most signiﬁcantly; 
where this process is not as acute, and streamﬂow is less reduced, 
migration rates are lower  (Wrathall et al., 2014). A study from a 
region in the central Peruvian Andes shows that the residents of the 
villages that have the highest dependence on glacier melt water travel 
further and stay away longer than the residents of the villages where 
glacier melt water forms a smaller portion of stream ﬂow (Milan 
and Ho, 2014). However, the inverse relation between reliance on 
cryosphere-related water sources and migration was noted in a case 
in the Naryn River drainage in Kyrgyzstan, where the villages that are 
more dependent on glacier melt water had lower, rather than higher, 
rates of wage labour migration than the villages which were less 
dependent on it; the villages with lower rates of such migration also 
had more efﬁcient water management institutions than the others 
(Hill et al., 2017). Several studies, which project cryosphere-related 
emigration to continue in the short term, emphasise decreased 
water availability, due to glacier retreat as a driver in Kyrgyzstan 
(Chandonnet et al., 2016) and Peru (Oliver-Smith, 2014), and to 
reduced snow cover in Nepal (Prasain, 2018). In most cases, climate 
is only one of several drivers (employment opportunities and better 
educational and health services in lowland areas are others).
Several studies show that wage labour migration is more frequent 
among young adults than among other age groups, supporting the 
observation in AR5 that climate change migrants worldwide are 
concentrated in this age (limited evidence, high agreement). This 
age-speciﬁc pattern is found in a valley in Northern Pakistan in 
which agriculture relies on glacier melt water for irrigation; as river 
ﬂow decreases, the returns to agricultural labour have declined, and 
emigration has increased, particularly among the youth, who are 
173

assigned, by local cultural practices, to carry out the heaviest work 
(Parveen et al., 2015). Emigration has increased in recent decades 
from two valleys in highland Bolivia which rely on glacier melt water, 
as water supplies have declined, though other factors also contribute 
to emigration, including land fragmentation, increasing household 
needs for income, the lack of local wage-labour opportunities and 
an interest among the young in educational opportunities located in 
cities (Brandt et al., 2016). In Nepal, young members of high-elevation 
pastoral households impacted by cryosphere change have been 
increasingly engaged in tourism and labour migration since 2000 
(Shaoliang et al., 2012); similar responses are reported for Sikkim 
in the Indian Himalaya (Ingty, 2017). A recent study documents the 
inter-generational dynamics of emigration from a livestock raising 
community in the Peruvian Andes, where glacier retreat has led to 
reduced streamﬂow that supports crucial dry season pasture (Alata 
et al., 2018). Though people 50 years old or older in this community 
are accustomed to living in the high pasture zones, younger people 
use livestock raising as a means of accumulating capital. They sell 
off their animals and move to towns at lower elevations. This loss of 
young adults has reduced the capacity of households to undertake 
the most demanding tasks, particularly in periods of inclement 
weather, accelerating the decline of herding. As a result, the human 
and animal populations of the communities are shrinking.
Recent research on cryosphere driven migration shows some 
cases of complex livelihood interactions or feedback loops, in 
which migration is not merely a result of changes in agricultural 
livelihoods, but also has impacts, either positive or negative, on these 
livelihoods (medium conﬁdence). In some instances, the different 
livelihood strategies complement each other to support income and 
well-being. A review of migration in the Himalaya and Hindu Kush 
found that households that participated in labour migration and 
received remittances had improved adaptive capacity, and lowered 
exposure to natural hazards (Banerjee et al., 2018). In other cases, 
the households and communities, which undertake wage labour 
migration, encounter conﬂicts or incompatibilities between migration 
and agricultural livelihoods. Sustainable management of land, water 
and other resources is highly labour intensive, and hence labour 
mobility constrains and limits the adoption of sustainable practices 
(Gilles et al., 2013). Moreover, the labour available to a household 
is differentiated by age. In Northern Pakistan, where cryosphere 
changes are reducing streamﬂow the emigration of young people 
has led to a decline not only in the labour in ﬁelds and orchards, 
but also a decline in the maintenance of irrigation infrastructure, 
leading to an overall reduction of the agricultural livelihoods in the 
community (Parveen et al., 2015).
In addition to affecting pastoral transhumance and increasing wage 
labour migration, cryosphere changes impact human mobility by 
creating cases of displacement. These cases differ from wage labour 
migration because they involve entire communities. As a result, 
they are irreversible, unlike cases in which individuals undertake 
long-term or permanent migration from their communities but retain 
the possibility of returning, because, for example, some relatives or 
former neighbours have remained in place. In this way, these cases of 
displacement represent cryosphere driven challenges to habitability. 
Though natural hazards have historically led some communities 
to relocate, cryosphere changes have contributed to instances of 
displacement. Unreliable water availability and increased risks of 
natural hazards are responsible for resettlement of villages in certain 
high mountain areas (McDonald, 1989; Parveen et al., 2015). A village 
in Western Nepal moved to lower elevation after decreasing snowfall 
reduced the ﬂow of water in the river on which their pastoralism and 
agriculture depended (Barnett et al., 2005). Three villages in Nepal 
faced severe declines in agricultural and pastoral livelihoods because 
decreased snow cover led to reduced soil moisture and to the drying 
up of springs, which were the historical source of irrigation water; 
in conjunction with an international non-governmental organisation 
(INGO), the residents planned a move to a lower area (Prasain, 2018). 
The issue of habitability arises in the cases, mentioned above, of 
communities that relocate after ﬂoods or debris ﬂows destroy houses 
and irrigation infrastructure, or damage ﬁelds and pastures. It occurs 
as well in the cases of households with extensive long-term migration, 
where agricultural and pastoral livelihoods are undermined by 
reduced water supply caused by cryospheric change (Barnett et al., 
2005). In addition, the loss of cultural values, including spiritual 
and intrinsic values (Section 2.3.6), can contribute to decisions to 
migrate (Kaenzig, 2015). Combined with the patterns of permanent 
emigration, this issue of habitability raises the issue of limits to 
adaptation in mountain areas (Huggel et al., 2019). Projections of 
decreased streamﬂow by 2100 in watersheds with strong glacier melt 
water components in Asia, Europe, and North and South America 
(Section 2.3.1.1) indicate that threats to habitability may continue 
through this period and affect the endeavours of achieving the SDGs 
in developing countries (Rasul et al., 2019).
2.4 
International Policy Frameworks and 
Pathways to Sustainable Development
The governance of key resources that are affected by climate-related 
changes in the cryosphere, such as water, is a relevant aspect for 
climate resilient sustainable development in mountains at the 
catchment level (Section  2.3.1.4). In this section, we address 
broader policy frameworks that are expected to shape a solution 
space through global action. An important development since AR5, 
at the global level, is the adoption of key frameworks that include 
the Paris Agreement (UNFCCC, 2015), UN 2030 Agenda and its 
SDGs (UN, 2015), and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk 
Reduction (UNISDR, 2015), which call for integrated and coordinated 
climate adaptation action that is also relevant for and applicable in 
mountain regions.
In international climate policy, the importance of averting, minimising 
and addressing loss and damage associated with adverse impacts of 
climate change is articulated in the Paris Agreement under Article 8, 
more speciﬁcally (UNFCCC, 2015). However, despite evident impacts 
of climate change on the mountain cryosphere (Section  2.3.2), 
there is limited evidence or reference in the literature to loss and 
damage for mountains, globally (Huggel et al., 2019). With already 
committed and unavoidable climate change, its effects on the high 
mountain cryosphere (Section  2.2) and related impacts and risks 
(Section 2.3), substantial adverse effects are expected in the coming 
174
Chapter 2 
High Mountain Areas
2
decades (Huggel et al., 2019), especially at high emission scenarios, 
which renders this issue a relevant aspect for planning climate 
resilient development in mountains. At least in one region, a concrete 
example for responding to and translating the Paris Agreement in a 
transboundary mountain setting, is reported. In 2015, through policy 
measures afforded by the Alpine Convention for the European Alps, 
the ministers for the environment of the Alpine countries established 
the Alpine Climate Board, who at the XV Alpine Conference in April 
2019, presented a climate target system that includes strategic targets 
for ‘climate-resilient Alps’ (Hojesky et al., 2019). The implementation 
and monitoring of these initiatives, however, remains to be assessed 
on an evidentiary basis. Furthermore, mechanisms afforded through 
the workplan of the Warsaw International Mechanism, speciﬁcally 
its work area under ‘Non-economic loss and damage’, are prospects 
relevant to address impacts to cultural and intrinsic values associated 
with losses in the high mountain cryosphere (UNFCCC Secretariat, 
2014; Serdeczny, 2019).
Monitoring and reporting on progress towards sustainable 
development through the implementation of the SDGs (UN, 2015) is 
receiving some research attention in the context of mountain regions 
(Rasul and Tripura, 2016; Gratzer and Keeton, 2017; Bracher et al., 
2018; Wymann von Dach et al., 2018; Kulonen et al., 2019; Mishra 
et al., 2019), noting key mountain speciﬁc considerations to improve 
the conditions under which the SDGs may serve a purpose in the 
mountain context. For example, previous research has identiﬁed 
a need for disaggregated data for SDG indicators and targets at 
subnational scales, with relevant area units that are both within 
country boundaries and/or across borders in transboundary settings 
(Rasul and Tripura, 2016; Bracher et al., 2018; Wymann von Dach 
et al., 2018 ). Furthermore, the use of non-standardised proxy data 
can further limit the potential for comparisons between countries 
and within regions (Bracher et al., 2018; Kulonen et al., 2019). On 
substance, assessments of the economic performance of livelihood 
options, combined with robust socioeconomic data for mountain 
systems, are still lacking in many parts of the world, compromising 
the ability for meaningful comparison and aggregation of data and 
knowledge for monitoring and reporting on progress of SDGs at 
regional or global scales (Gratzer and Keeton, 2017).
Disasters associated with natural hazards in high mountains are 
placing many communities and their potential for sustainable 
development at risk (Wymann von Dach et al., 2017; Keiler and 
Fuchs, 2018; Vaidya et al., 2019). The Sendai Framework for Disaster 
Risk Reduction 2015–2030 (UNISDR, 2015) offers a global policy 
framework under which risks, including climate change, can be 
accounted for and addressed at national scales. However, there is 
limited evidence in monitoring and reporting on progress on targets 
therein (Wymann von Dach et al., 2017), particularly in systematically 
reporting on root causes of disasters in high mountains and 
associated compounded risks and cascading impacts, and even 
more so when accounting for impacts related to climate change. 
Technical guidelines available for the high mountain context provide 
complementary means to monitor and report on the effectiveness of 
measures to reduce associated risks with changes in the cryosphere 
(e.g., GAPHAZ, 2017).
Other relevant frameworks include the Convention Concerning the 
Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, enacted to 
protect the planet’s most signiﬁcant and irreplaceable places from 
loss or damage (UNESCO, 1972). In it, conservation strategies are 
listed that aim at preserving natural and cultural heritage across 
regions, including sites that contain glaciers (Section 2.3.6), and are 
suggested as means to further support efforts towards the promotion 
of knowledge, collective cultural memory and climate policy (Bosson 
et al., 2019).
Overall, there are promising prospects through international policy 
frameworks to support governance and adaptation to climate-related 
changes in the mountain cryosphere whilst addressing sustainable 
development, with evidence suggesting that treaties and conventions 
are relevant enablers to support cooperation and implementation 
at the mountain region scale (Dinar et al., 2016). However, there 
is limited evidence to systematically assess for effectiveness in 
addressing speciﬁc challenges posed by changes in the mountain 
cryosphere, globally.
2.5 
Key Gaps in Knowledge and Prospects
Impacts associated with climate-related changes in the high 
mountain cryosphere are evident in the observations reported in this 
chapter (Section 2.3). However, uncertainties remain with detection 
and attribution of key atmospheric drivers that inﬂuence much of 
these climate-related changes (Section 2.2.1), due to limited spatial 
density and/or temporal extent of observation records at high 
elevations. For example, trends in total or solid precipitation at high 
elevation remain highly uncertain, due to intrinsic uncertainties with 
in situ observation methods, and large natural variability. There 
are clear knowledge gaps in the distribution and characteristics 
of cryospheric variables, in particular the extent and ice content 
of permafrost in mountains, but also current glacier ice volumes, 
trends in lake and river ice, and the spatial and temporal variation 
of snow cover. These knowledge gaps persist despite a wealth of 
new data since AR5 especially from Earth observation satellites, 
which overcome much of the remoteness and inaccessibility of high 
mountains yet still face challenges for observations in mountains 
such as dealing with cloud cover and rugged terrain. Along with 
improved capacities to generate and integrate diverse observation 
data, initiatives such as citizen science (e.g., Dickerson-Lange et al., 
2016; Wikstrom Jones et al., 2018) or Indigenous knowledge and 
local knowledge (Section 1.8.2, Cross Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 1) can 
also complement some observations that are based on conventional 
instruments and models. Radiative forcing effects of light absorbing 
particles, and understanding their spatiotemporal dynamics, is a 
key knowledge gap for the attribution of changes in high mountain 
snow and glaciers, and the  understanding of regional feedbacks 
(Section 2.2.2, Box 2.2).
These observational knowledge gaps currently impede efforts to 
quantify trends, and to calibrate and evaluate models that simulate 
the past and future evolution of the cryosphere and its impacts. 
Speciﬁc uncertainties are associated with projections of future 
climate change trends at high elevations due mostly to current 
175
High Mountain Areas 
Chapter 2

limits in regional climate models and downscaling methods to 
capture the subtle interplays between large-scale climate change 
and local phenomena inﬂuenced by complex topography and high 
relief (Section 2.2.1). Coarse-scale simulations of future permafrost 
conditions in high mountains are fraught with difﬁculties in capturing 
ﬁne-scale variation of topography, surface cover and near-surface 
materials (Section  2.2.4). Improved cross-disciplinary studies 
bringing together current observation and modelling approaches in 
each speciﬁc ﬁeld hold potential to contribute to addressing these 
gaps in the future.
Experiences with changes in water availability, and with changes 
in frequency and/or magnitude of natural hazards, demonstrate 
the relevance of integrated approaches to understand past impacts 
and prepare for future risks, where exposure and the underpinning 
existing vulnerabilities of mountain socioecological systems 
inﬂuence the extent of these impacts (Section  2.3.2.3). However, 
there is insufﬁcient understanding of the effects of cryospheric 
change on some natural hazards such as glacier outburst ﬂoods and 
on infrastructure, for example for transportation. Increased wildﬁre 
risk with a shrinking cryosphere is an uncertainty both spatially and 
temporally and with consequent effects on mountain ecosystems, 
particularly with respect to soil carbon and potential biome shifts. 
Overall, few studies have taken a comprehensive risk approach to 
systematically characterise and compare magnitude and extent of 
past impacts and future risks across high mountain regions, including 
compound risks and cascading impacts where instances of deep 
uncertainty in responses and outcomes may arise (Cross Chapter 
Box  5 in Chapter  1). Furthermore, a key knowledge gap is the 
capacity to economically quantify cryosphere-speciﬁc impacts and 
potential risks.
With ecosystems, particularly the terrestrial component, uncertainty 
exists at which community changes can be directly linked to 
cryospheric change as distinct from those due to atmospheric 
warming. In some cases, the changes can be linked, for example, where 
a receding glacier creates new habitat, but rising air temperature 
allow some species to establish that would not otherwise be able 
to. A major research gap is in our understanding of the fate of 
legacy pollutants such as mercury downstream of their release from 
glaciers and permafrost in terms of quantity and regional differences, 
freshwater sinks, and potential effects to ecosystems and human 
health. Similarly, the effect of permafrost thaw on water quality and 
ecosystems due to the increasing release of natural heavy metals and 
nutrients represents a gap in knowledge.
While adaptation measures are reported for high mountain 
cryosphere changes (Figure 2.9 a), it stands as a relatively new and 
developing area of research since AR5 (Figure 2.9 b), with particular 
gaps in terms of systematically evaluating their cost-beneﬁts and 
long-term effectiveness as ‘ﬁt-for-purpose’ solutions in the mountain 
context. Improved inter-comparability of successful adaptation cases, 
including the transferability of evidence for how adaptation can 
address both climate change and sustainable development objectives 
in different mountain regions, are prospects to support an evidentiary 
basis for future assessments of adaptation to cryosphere changes in 
the high mountains (Adler et al., 2019; McDowell et al., 2019).

Appendix 2.A: Additional Information 
on Global and Regional Glacier Mass 
Change Estimates for 2006–2015
Two global-scale estimates of recent glacier mass changes have 
been published since AR5 (Wouters et al., 2019; Zemp et al., 2019) 
that include area-averaged estimates for large-scale glacier regions 
as deﬁned by the Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI Consortium, 
2017). Zemp et al. (2019) is based on extrapolation of geodetic and 
glaciological observations, while Wouters et al. (2019) use gravimetric 
measurements from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment 
(GRACE). For some regions, additional estimates are available mostly 
based on remote sensing data (Table 2.A.1).
These estimates were used to derive an average mass change rate 
for the period 2006–2015 for each glacier region covered in both 
Chapter  2  and 3. Where several estimates were available for this 
period or similar periods, these were averaged and uncertainties 
obtained from standard error propagation assuming the estimates 
to be independent. The GRACE estimates were only considered in 
regions with extensive ice cover due to generally large uncertainties 
in regions with little ice cover (Wouters et al., 2019). The estimates 
for the polar regions by Box et al. (2018) were not used since they 
are based on an earlier version of the data by Wouters et al. (2019).
Individual regional estimates for overlapping periods between 
2000 and 2017 were recalculated to represent the period 2006–
2015, prior to averaging with other existing estimates. For Western 
Canada and USA the mass change rate by Menounos et al. (2019) 
for 2000–2009 was assumed to hold for 2006–2009, and the rate 
of –12 ± 5 Gt yr–1 for 2009–2018 was assumed to be valid for 2010–
2015. For Iceland the mass change rate by Björnsson et al. (2013) 
for 2003–2010 was assumed to hold for 2006–2010, and the rate 
by Foresta et al. (2016) for 2011–2015 was used for the remaining 
years. The estimate for Iceland by Nilsson et al. (2015) for the period 
2003–2009 is similar to the estimate by Björnsson et al. (2013), but 
was not used since it is based on spatially relatively scarce remote 
sensing data compared to Björnsson et al. (2013), which is based on 
detailed glaciological and geodetic balances. The GRACE estimate for 
Iceland was not used since it deviates strongly from the estimate by 
Zemp et al. (2019) which is well-constrained by direct observations 
in this region, while the GRACE estimate may have been affected 
by the mass change signal from ice masses in southeast Greenland 
and processes in the Earth mantle cause by isostatic adjustments 
since the end of the 19th century (Sørensen et al., 2017). For the 
Low Latitudes (>99% of glacier area in the Andes) available mass 
loss estimates differ considerably. Zemp et al. (2019)‘s high estimate 
relies on extrapolation of observations from less than 1% of the 
glacier area, while the low estimate by Braun et al. (2019) for the 
Andes may underestimate mass loss due to incomplete coverage 
and systematic errors in their derived digital elevation models due 
to radar penetration. In the absence of other estimates for this 
period the average of both estimates is used. For Arctic Canada and 
the Southern Andes, the estimates by Zemp et al. (2019) were not 
considered since they rely on observations from less than 5% of the 
glacier area. The regional estimates by Gardner et al. (2013) for the 
period 2003–2009 informed AR5 and are given for comparison but 
not included in the composite estimate for 2006–2015.
Table 2A.1 |   Regional estimates of glacier mass budget in three different units. Only estimates from the studies marked in bold were used to derive the average SROCC 
estimates. Regional glacier area A and volume V are taken from the Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI Consortium, 2017) and Farinotti et al. (2019), respectively. Method 
geod. refers to the geodetic method (using elevation changes) and gl. refers to the glaciological method (based on in situ mass-balance observations). Results are given for 
various aggregated areas including among others all regions combined (global), and global excluding the Antarctic (A) and Greenland (G) periphery. All regional estimates 
(in kg m–2 yr–1) are shown in Figures 2.4 and 3.8). SLE is sea level equivalent.
