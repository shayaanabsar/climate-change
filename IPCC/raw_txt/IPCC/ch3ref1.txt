SOLVENT AND OTHER PRODUCT USE
3.1
Overview
Solvents and related compounds are important for greenhouse gas (GHG) and other
emission inventories because they are a significant source of emissions of non-methane
volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs). No other GHGs are emitted in significant
amounts from the use of solvents and related compounds, which include chemical
cleaning substances used in dry cleaning, printing, metal degreasing, and a variety of
industrial applications as well as household use. Also included in this category are paints,
lacquers, thinners and related materials used in coatings in a variety of industrial,
commercial and household applications. Table 3-1 lists some of the potentially important
subcategories included under this source category.
This category also includes evaporative emissions of greenhouse gases arising from other
types of product use.  This included, for example, N2O emissions from medical use.
Emissions arising from the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in applications like
refrigeration, air conditioning, fire extinguishers, solvents foam-blowing, cooling and
aerosols should be reported in Industrial Processes under category 2F.
All of the substances included here contain significant amounts of NMVOC. Emissions are
produced through evaporation of the volatile chemicals when these products are exposed
to air. Non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) are often emitted in
significant quantities from evaporation during the variety of dispersed activities discussed
above. These emissions are sometimes referred to as "area" sources because they occur
in large numbers of small dispersed applications, rather than from large centralised
industrial processes (or "point" sources).
Solvent and other product use is treated as a separate category in detailed inventory
procedures (e.g., CORINAIR) because the nature of this area source requires a
somewhat different approach to emissions estimation than that used for calculating other
emissions categories. The IPCC Guidelines treats the category separately for this reason.

NMVOC Emissions from Solvent and Other
Product Use
NMVOC emissions estimates are characterised by high uncertainty. This is especially true
for the solvent use source category on a global scale. The contribution of this source
category is believed to be quite significant. A preliminary analysis estimated total global
NMVOC release from solvent use to be about 11 per cent of total NMVOC emissions
(Watson, et al., 1991).
Based on national GHG emissions inventories, NMVOC emissions from these sources
can represent a much larger share of the total NMVOC emissions for some countries.
NMVOC from solvent use represents 31 per cent of the total NMVOC emissions for
both Italy and Denmark. (ENEA, 1991, Fenger et al., 1990)  The Netherlands estimates
solvent use to account for 25 per cent, and both Finland and the United States estimate
emissions to be 24 per cent of their total NMVOC emissions (van den Born et al., 1991,
Boström et al., 1992, US EPA, 1991).  By contrast, emissions from solvent use in Nigeria
were only 3 per cent of the total NMVOC (Obioh et al., 1992).

The wide variations in national emissions from solvent and other product use highlight
the differences in their use between countries and some of the difficulties associated with
accurately estimating emissions from these sources.
There are two basic approaches to estimation of emissions from Solvent and Other
Product Use, which depend on the availability of data on the activities producing
emissions and the emission factors.
1
Production-based - In some cases, solvent or coating use is associated with
centralised industrial production activities, such as automobile and ship production,
textile manufacture, paper coating, chemical products manufacture, etc. In these
cases it is generally possible to develop NMVOC emission factors based on unit of
product output. These are based on the amount of paint, solvents, or other
chemically volatile products consumed per unit of production of the final products.
Once reasonable factors are developed it is straightforward to estimate annual
emissions based on production data which are generally available on an annual basis
for most countries. Industrial production data is also compiled and published by
international organisations (e.g., United Nations, 1992) and these data can be used
to supplement locally available data.
2
Consumption-based - In many applications of paints, solvents and similar
products, the end uses are too small-scale, diverse, and dispersed to be tracked
directly. Therefore emissions estimates are generally based on total consumption
(i.e., sales) of the solvents, paints, etc. used in these applications. The assumption is
that once these products are sold to end users, they are applied and emissions
produced relatively rapidly. For most surface coating and general solvent use, this
approach is used. Emission factors are developed based on the likely ultimate release
of NMVOC to the atmosphere per unit of product consumed. These emission
factors can then be applied to sales data for the specific solvent or paint products.
The IPCC/OECD joint programme has not produced any original work on estimation of
NMVOCs from the use of these products. This is for two reasons. First, NMVOC is a
greenhouse gas (actually a class of gases) covered under the programme, but it has been

assigned a lower priority for national experts just initiating greenhouse gas inventory
work. Most methods development work within the IPCC/OECD programme has focused
on providing methods and default information for the first priority gases - CO2, CH4, and
N2O, which are direct greenhouse gases. Second, NMVOCs are among the gases already
under heavy scrutiny in national and international inventory programmes because of their
role as local and regional air pollutants. Hence there is a large and growing body of
literature containing guidance on estimation procedures and emission factors for
NMVOCs from a number of source categories, including from solvents and other
products.
National experts who are already familiar with these procedures and have emissions data
available or under development, should report these data to the IPCC/OECD
programme, as discussed in Volume 1: Reporting Instructions.
Other experts needing information should consult the existing major references such as:
•
Default Emission Factor Handbook (EEATF, 1992);
•
US EPA's Compilation of Air Pollutant Emissions Factors (AP-42) (US EPA, 1985)
and Supplement F (AP-42) (US EPA, 1993);
•
Criteria Pollutant Emission Factors for the 1985 NAPAP Emissions Inventory
(Stockton and Stelling, 1987).

Sciences, 1993).
•

Because NMVOC emission controls vary widely throughout the world, it is important for
national experts to account for the level of emission control application in their country.
Also, there may be significant differences among countries regarding the processes and
equipment used. These differences can affect the level of NMVOC emissions. Finally,
because estimates based on consumption data provide only an approximation of the
activities associated with the manufacture of all products within a particular subcategory,
there is a degree of uncertainty in the estimates (Watson, et al., 1991).
