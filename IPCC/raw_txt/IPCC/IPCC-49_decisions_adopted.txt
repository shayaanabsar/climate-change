Decision IPCC-XLIX-4.  IPCC Scholarship Programme 
  
Document: IPCC-XLIX/Doc. 9, Rev.1 
 
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change at its 49th Session expresses its gratitude to the 
Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation and the Cuomo Foundation for their continued support of the 
IPCC Scholarship Programme through the current 5th round of awards. It also expresses its 
gratitude to the many experts, authors and review editors who are volunteering their time to review 
the current round of applications for scholarship. 
 
In providing guidance to the Board of Trustees on the use of the Scholarship Fund, the Panel 
stresses: 
1.   The need to continue to prioritize the funding of post-graduate scholarships for developing 
country scientists, especially from least developed countries, in line with the general aim of the 
Nobel Peace Prize Fund as agreed by the IPCC.  
2.    The benefits of supporting Chapter Scientists from developing countries to participate in the 
work of the IPCC, but to do so in ways that do not undermine the ability of the Scholarship Fund 
to continue to support post-graduate activities.  
3.      The need to mobilize additional resources for Scholarship Programme activities in order to 
expand the ability of developing country scientists to contribute in robust ways to advancing 
climate science and participating in the work of the IPCC.

IPCC and note the recommendations of the group as consideration for future work. 
2.  
Express its gratitude for the work of the members, the co-chairs and the rapporteur of the 
IPCC Task Group on Gender as well as for the support of the IPCC secretariat. 
3.  
Establish a Task Group on Gender Policy and Gender Implementation Plan (TG-Gender) with 
the aim of developing a draft Gender Policy and a Gender Implementation plan to improve 
gender balance and address gender-related issues within the IPCC, for consideration by the 
Panel at its 52nd Session.

Annex 1 
  
Terms of Reference and Mandate of the IPCC Task Group on Data Support for Climate 
Change Assessments (TG-Data) 
  
  
1 PURPOSE 
  
The purpose of the TG-Data is to:  
  
1.1  Provide guidance to the IPCC’s Data Distribution Centre (DDC) in order to provide curation, 
transparency, traceability and stability of data and scenarios related to the reports of the IPCC. 
 
1.2  Facilitate, in cooperation with the DDC, the availability and consistent use of climate change 
related data and scenarios in support of the implementation of the work programme of the IPCC. 
 
1.3  Facilitate in cooperation with the DDC the availability and use of climate change related data 
resulting from the activities of the IPCC in accordance with the mandate of the IPCC. 
  
  
2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 
  
With respect to IPCC’s Data Distribution Centre (DDC) the TG-Data will:     
 
 
2.1  Provide oversight of the DDC’s activities, in close liaison with the three IPCC Working Group 
Bureaus (WGBs). 
 
2.2  Identify in close liaison with the Co-Chairs or their representatives of the three Working Groups 
(WGs) relevant external sources of data, scenario information, and external data partnerships. 
 
2.3  Provide in close liaison with the Co-Chairs or their representatives of three WGs guidance to 
incorporate consistently and efficiently relevant regional data and scenario information into the IPCC 
assessment work by developing and proposing policies and structures that will help to link and 
curate data as needed and used by the Co-Chairs or their representatives of the three WGs. 
 
2.4  Recommend partnerships with external organisations to ensure the stability of the IPCC data 
sets they hold. 
 
With respect to the use of data and scenarios the TG-Data will:        
 
 
2.5  Provide expert information on data and scenarios in support of the implementation of the work 
programme of the IPCC. 
 
2.6  In cooperation with the Co-Chairs or their representatives of the three WGs, develop and 
update good practice guidance materials related to data and scenarios, targeting IPCC authors who 
lack familiarity with the IPCC process and/or the relevant data and scenarios. 
 
2.7  Contribute to building capacity in the use of data and scenarios for climate-related research, 
particularly in developing and transition-economy regions and countries. e.g. through encouraging 
activities such as expert meetings and liaison with relevant academic institutions to address the 
requirements of developing countries. To achieve this, TG-Data may work with organizations and 
activities that have training as their core mandate but would not develop training programmes on 
their own. 
 
Furthermore, the TG-Data will:   
 
2.8  Explore in close consultation with the Co-Chairs or their representatives of the three WGs 
options for a sustainable structure, functioning, and resourcing for the DDC building upon the 
material contained in Annex 9 to the present report.

3.2  Members will be selected from nominations of experts solicited by the IPCC Secretariat from 
governments and observer organizations. 
  
3.3  TG-Data will be composed of approximately 12 members, but not more than 15. The 
composition of the TG-Data shall aim to reflect to the extent possible: 
a) the range of scientific, technical and socio-economic views and expertise as 
needed to fulfil its role and responsibilities; 
b) geographical representation, experts from developed and developing countries 
and from countries with economies in transition,

though with contingency for members to serve shorter terms. 
  
 
5 MODUS OPERANDI 
  
5.1  Within the framework of the purpose and the roles and responsibilities, the TG-Data, in 
consultation with the WG Co-Chairs, will prepare its draft workplan for duration of its term, including

subject to review by the IPCC Bureau and presented to the Panel for approval, contingent on the 
availability of funds. 
 
5.2  TG-Data should have one face to face meeting in a year. Additional meetings will be preferably 
held through teleconferencing and/or in combination with existing IPCC meetings where TG-Data

IPCC. 
  
  
2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 
  
The DDC will, contingent on the availability of resources:

IPCC in a transparent manner, under the guidance of the TG-Data and the Working Group Bureaus 
(WGBs), to provide information via IPCC websites relevant to data and scenarios. 
2.4  Curate new data sets unavailable elsewhere and link to external data sets of relevance. 
2.5  Improve accessibility to Data Distribution Centre materials for supporting IPCC authors and

to enhance the financial stability of the IPCC in the long term; 
 
7. 
Encourages members to make first-time contributions to the IPCC Trust Fund in order to 
broaden the donor base; 
 
8. 
Expresses its gratitude to members that support the Technical Support Units (TSUs) and a 
number of IPCC activities, including data centres, meetings and outreach activities; 
 
9. 
Encourages members to transfer funds as soon as practicable, while noting that 
contributions from IPCC members are due on 1 January of each calendar year, noting that 
when transferring funds to WMO, members should indicate that the contribution is “for the 
IPCC Trust Fund” to ensure proper identification of the recipient; 
 
10. Expresses its gratitude to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United 
Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) for financing one Secretariat position each, and to 
WMO for hosting the Secretariat;

pose a high risk of late or non-arrival; 
 
16. Encourages the Secretariat and Working Group Technical Support Units to follow the 
provision described in Paragraph 12 of Appendix B to the Principles Governing IPCC Work, 
authorizing the Secretary to reallocate funds up to 20 per cent of a budget appropriation line, 
to provide flexibility for the allocation of additional trips to Lead Author Meetings to support 
cross-Working Group linkages.
