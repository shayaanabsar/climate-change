3 CHEMICAL INDUSTRY EMISSIONS 
3.1 
INTRODUCTION 
The following Sections 3.2 through 3.10 give guidance for estimating greenhouse gas emissions that result from 
the production of various inorganic and organic chemicals for which experience by a number of countries has 
confirmed significant contributions to global or individual national greenhouse gas emission levels.  
• 
Section 3.2 covers emissions from ammonia production; 
• 
Section 3.3 covers emissions from nitric acid production;  
• 
Section 3.4 covers emissions from adipic acid production;  
• 
Section 3.5 covers emissions from the production of caprolactam, glyoxal, and glyoxylic acid;  
• 
Section 3.6 covers emissions from the production of carbide;  
• 
Section 3.7 deals with emissions from the production of titanium dioxide;  
• 
Section 3.8 deals with emissions from the production of soda ash;  
• 
Section 3.9 covers emissions from key processes in the petrochemical and carbon black production, i.e., 
methanol, ethylene and propylene, ethylene dichloride, ethylene oxide, acrylonitrile, and carbon black;  
• 
Section 3.10 deals with emissions from fluorochemical production i.e., HFC-23 from the production of 
HCFC-22 and fugitive and by-product emissions from the production of other fluorinated compounds 
including hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and uranium hexafluoride (UF6). 
Care should be exercised to avoid double counting of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in both this chapter and in 
Volume 2 on Energy Sector, or, in omitting CO2 emissions since CO2 emissions resulting from carbon’s role as 
process reactant and as a heat source to drive the chemical reactions involved in the chemical processes can be 
closely related.  Should CO2 capture technology be installed at a chemical plant, the CO2 captured should be 
deducted in a higher tier emissions calculation. Respective guidance on the capture and subsequent destruction 
or use of HFC-23 or other fluorochemicals is given in section 3.10. Any methodology taking into account CO2 
capture should consider that CO2 emissions captured in the process may be both combustion and process-related. 
In cases where combustion and process emissions are to be reported separately, e.g., in the petrochemical 
industry, inventory compilers should ensure that the same quantities of CO2 are not double counted. In these 
cases the total amount of CO2 captured should preferably be reported in the corresponding energy combustion 
and IPPU categories in proportion to the amounts of CO2 generated in these source categories. The default 
assumption is that there is no CO2 capture and storage (CCS) taking place. For additional information on CO2 
capture and storage refer to Volume 3, Section 1.2.2 and for more details to Volume 2, Section 2.3.4.

AMMONIA PRODUCTION 
3.2.1 
Introduction 
Ammonia (NH3) is a major industrial chemical and the most important nitrogenous material produced. Ammonia 
gas is used directly as a fertiliser, in heat treating, paper pulping, nitric acid and nitrates manufacture, nitric acid 
ester and nitro compound manufacture, explosives of various types, and as a refrigerant. Amines, amides, and 
miscellaneous other organic compounds, such as urea, are made from ammonia (Austin, 1984; p.303). 
Ammonia production requires a source of nitrogen (N) and hydrogen (H). Nitrogen is obtained from air through 
liquid air distillation or an oxidative process where air is burnt and the residual nitrogen is recovered. Most 
ammonia is produced from natural gas (chiefly methane (CH4)), although H can be obtained from other 
hydrocarbons (coal (indirectly), oil), and water (Hocking, 1998; p.317). A small number of plants continue to use 
fuel oil as the fuel input and H source in the partial oxidation process. The carbon (C) content of the hydrocarbon 
is eliminated from the process at the primary steam reforming stage and shift conversion stage through 
conversion to carbon dioxide (CO2) which is the main potential direct greenhouse gas emission. Plants using 
hydrogen rather than natural gas to produce ammonia do not release CO2 from the synthesis process. 
3.2.2 
Methodological issues 
The chemistry to obtain ammonia feedstocks is similar irrespective of the hydrocarbon used – CH4 or other fossil 
fuels (Hocking, 1998; p.319). Because the industry uses predominantly natural gas, the following outline of the 
process and sources of greenhouse emissions (CO2) is based on production using natural gas. Anhydrous 
ammonia produced by catalytic steam reforming of natural gas (mostly CH4) involves the following reactions 
with carbon dioxide produced as a by-product. 
Primary steam reforming: 
CH4 + H2O  →  CO + 3H2 
CO + H2O → CO2 + H2 
Secondary air reforming: 
CH4 + air  → CO + 2H2 + 2N2 
Overall reaction: 
0.88CH4 + 1.26Air + 1.24H2O  → 0.88CO2 + N2 + 3H2 
Ammonia synthesis: 
N2 + 3H2  → 2NH3 
Secondary reformer process gas shift conversion: 
CO + H2O  → CO2 + H2 
(Hocking, 1998; EFMA, 2000a; EIPPCB, 2004a) 
The processes that affect CO2 emissions associated with ammonia production are: 
• 
carbon monoxide shift at two temperatures using iron oxide, copper oxide and/or chromium oxide catalyst 
for conversion to carbon dioxide; 
• 
carbon dioxide absorption by a scrubber solution of hot potassium carbonate, monoethanolamine (MEA), 
Sulfinol (alkanol amine and tetrahydrothiophene dioxide) or others; 
• 
methanation of residual CO2 to methane with nickel catalysts to purify the synthesis gas. 
The production of ammonia represents a significant non-energy industrial source of CO2 emissions. The primary 
release of CO2 at plants using the natural gas catalytic steam reforming process occurs during regeneration of the 
CO2 scrubbing solution with lesser emissions resulting from condensate stripping. 
Should CO2 capture technology be installed and used at a plant, it is good practice to deduct the CO2 captured in 
a higher tier emissions calculation. The default assumption is that there is no CO2 capture and storage (CCS). In 
most cases, methodologies that account for CO2 capture should consider that CO2 emissions captured in the 
process may be both combustion and process-related. However, in the case of ammonia production no distinction 
is made between fuel and feedstock emissions with all emissions accounted for in the IPPU Sector. Similarly, all 
CO2 captured should be accounted for in the IPPU Sector. For additional information on CO2 capture and storage 
refer to Volume 3, Section 1.2.2 and for more details on capture and storage to Volume 2, Section 2.3.4. 
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
3.12 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
CARBON DIOXIDE REGENERATOR 
After absorption of CO2 from the process gas, the saturated scrubbing solutions (e.g., potassium carbonate, MEA, 
etc.) are regenerated (i.e., for re-use) with steam stripping and/or boiling to release CO2 from the bicarbonates 
according to the following reactions: 
Heat 
2KHCO3  →  K2CO3 + H2O + CO2   
Heat 
(C2H5ONH2)2 + H2CO3  →  2C2H5ONH2 + H2O + CO2 
The stripping gas, containing CO2 and other impurities, may be directed to a urea plant (where operational), to a 
liquid carbonic acid plant, or vented to the atmosphere (Environment Canada, 1987).  
CONDENSATE STRIPPER 
Cooling the synthesis gas after low temperature shift conversion forms a condensate containing small quantities 
of CO2 and other process impurities.  The condensate is stripped by steam, whereby the components may be 
vented to the atmosphere, but normally recycled to the process together with the process stream (U.S. EPA, 
1985). 
3.2.2.1 
CHOICE OF METHOD 
The choice of method will depend on national circumstances as shown in the decision tree, Figure 3.1. Emissions 
are estimated from the total fuel requirement, or values derived from estimates of the total fuel requirement, used 
in the production of NH3. The fuel energy requirement is not accounted for separately. Note that values reported 
in energy units (or volume units) need to be converted to mass units when estimating emissions. 
Methods are classified according to the extent of plant-level data that are available. The Tier 1 method is based 
on default values and national statistics; the Tier 2 method is based on complete plant-level output data 
distinguished by fuel input type and process type, and default values; and the Tier 3 method is based entirely on 
plant-level input data. 
The Tier 3 method uses plant-level output data and plant-level fuel input per unit of output to derive the total fuel 
requirement. Similarly, Tier 3 can also use plant-level emission factors per unit of output provided that the 
source of these factors is plant-level detailed data on the fuel inputs per unit of output. 
TIER 1 METHOD 
The Tier 1 method uses ammonia production to derive emissions as follows:

CCF = carbon content factor of the fuel, kg C/GJ 
COF = carbon oxidation factor of the fuel, fraction 
RCO2 = CO2 recovered for downstream use (urea production), kg 
Ammonia production and emission factors can be obtained from national statistics and the emission factor can be 
determined from default values shown in Table 3.1. Where no information is available on the fuel type and/or 
process type, it is good practice to use the highest emission factor shown in Table 3.1. CO2 recovered for 
downstream use can be estimated from the quantity of urea produced where CO2 is estimated by multiplying 
urea production by 44/60, the stoichiometric ratio of CO2 to urea. When a deduction is made for CO2 used in 
urea production it is good practice to ensure that emissions from urea use are included elsewhere in the 
inventory. If data are not available on urea production it is good practice to assume that CO2 recovered is zero.

TIER 2 METHOD 
The initial step is to determine the total fuel requirement. For the Tier 2 method the total fuel requirement for 
each fuel type is estimated as follows:

Ammonia production, the fuel type and process type can be obtained from producers, and the fuel requirement 
per unit of output (FR) can be determined from the default values shown in Table 3.1. Emissions are derived 
according to Equation 3.3:

COFi = carbon oxidation factor of the fuel type i, fraction 
RCO2 = CO2 recovered for downstream use (urea production, CO2 capture and storage (CCS)), kg 
When using the Tier 2 method, the C content of the fuel (CCF) and C oxidation factor (COF) may be obtained 
from the default values shown in Table 3.1 or country specific Energy Sector information. Data on CO2 
recovered for urea production and CCS should be obtained from producers. 
TIER 3 METHOD 
The Tier 3 method requires that the fuel requirement be obtained from producers. The total fuel requirement is 
the sum of the total fuel requirements reported by each NH3 production plant. That is:

Where: 
TFRi = total fuel requirement for fuel type i, GJ

Once data on total fuel requirements are collected and collated, CO2 emissions can be estimated using Equation 
3.3. When using the Tier 3 method, it is good practice to obtain information on the CCF and COF from 
producers or to use country specific energy sector information. As with the Tier 2 method, data on CO2 
recovered for urea production (if any) and CCS (if undertaken) should be obtained from producers. 
Although data on ammonia production is not used in the calculation under the Tier 3 method it also needs to be 
collected from producers for reporting purposes.

CO2 RECOVERED FOR INDUSTRIAL GAS 
CO2 recovered for industrial gas applications is not accounted for separately as this is a relatively 
low volume short term use and it is assumed that all industrial gas carbon will be emitted to the 
atmosphere in the producing country. For example, industrial CO2 used in freezing applications is 
assumed to be released in the producing country.

CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTORS 
TIER 1 METHOD 
If plant-level information is not available, it is good practice to use default factors. These default values often 
represent midpoint or mean values of data sets (as determined by expert analysis). The extent to which they 
represent a specific plant’s emission rate is unknown. Default factors by production process are provided in 
Table 3.1, and should be used only in cases where plant-specific data are not available. The default factors are 
estimates of total fuel requirements per unit of output expressed in energy units. They can be converted to mass 
units based on C content of the fuel and the C oxidation factor in Volume 2: Energy of these Guidelines. These 
values are also included in Table 3.1 as are emission factors of tonnes of CO2 per tonne of NH3 derived using 
these values. 
Chapter 3: Chemical Industry Emissions 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.15 
For the Tier 1 method it is good practice to use the highest total fuel requirement per tonne of ammonia. If no 
information on fuel type is available, it is good practice to use the average value shown in Table 3.1 for partial 
oxidation.

using C content based on natural gas (dry basis) and partial oxidation default factors can be derived using C content based on residual 
fuel oil. 
 
TIER 2 METHOD 
The total fuel requirement values per unit of output in Table 3.1 can be used in conjunction with data on NH3 
production by fuel type and process type, along with either default or country specific data on the C content 
factor and carbon oxidation factor of the fuels. 
TIER 3 METHOD 
Plant-level data on total fuel requirement provide the most rigorous data for calculating CO2 emissions from 
ammonia production. It is good practice to obtain information on the CCF and COF from producers or use 
country-specific Energy Sector data. The CCF is the key emission factor variable for deriving the quantity of 
CO2 emissions. Derivation of emissions using plant-level ammonia production depends on an accurate estimate 
of the fuel requirement per unit of output, along with information on the other variables. 
3.2.2.3 
CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
TIER 1 METHOD 
The Tier 1 method requires data on national production of NH3. If national-level activity data are not available, 
information on production capacity can be used. It is good practice to multiply the total national production 
capacity by a capacity utilisation factor of 80 percent ± 10 percent (i.e., a range of 70-90 percent) if the inventory 
compiler can document that utilisation for a year was below capacity. The same capacity utilisation factor should 
be applied to each year of the time-series. 
TIER 2 METHOD 
The Tier 2 method requires plant level data on ammonia production classified by fuel type and production 
process. In addition, plant level data on CO2 recovered for downstream use or other application are required.  
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
3.16 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
TIER 3 METHOD 
The plant-level activity data required for the Tier 3 approach are total fuel requirement classified by fuel type, 
CO2 recovered for downstream use or other applications, ammonia production. Although ammonia production is 
not used in the Tier 3 calculation, collection of all activity data that influence the estimation of emissions allows 
changes over time and any misreporting of activity data to be identified. Where plant-level fuel requirement per 
unit of output is used, collection of plant-level production data is required. 
 
BOX 3.2 
DOUBLE COUNTING 
In order to avoid double counting, the total quantities of oil or gas used (fuel plus feedstock) in 
ammonia production must be subtracted from the quantity reported under energy use in the 
Energy Sector.  
In addition, the quantity of CO2 recovered for downstream use in urea production must be 
subtracted from the total quantity of CO2 generated to derive CO2 emitted. Emissions of CO2 from 
urea use should be accounted for in the corresponding sectors. In particular, emissions from urea 
use as fertiliser should be included in the Agriculture Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) 
Sector (see Volume 4). Emissions from urea use in automobile catalytic converters should be 
accounted for in the Energy Sector (Volume 2). Emissions from any other chemical products 
manufactured using CO2 recovered from the process (e.g., emissions from carbonic acid use) are 
covered by methodology suggested in this section and should not be accounted for in other IPPU 
sections or in other sectors. 
 
BOX 3.3 
UREA PRODUCTION 
Urea (CO(NH2)2) (carbonyl amide or carbamide) is an important nitrogenous fertiliser with the 
highest nitrogen content available in a solid fertiliser. Urea is also used as a protein food 
supplement for ruminants, in melamine production, as an ingredient in the manufacture of resins, 
plastics, adhesives, coatings, textile anti-shrink agents, and ion-exchange resins (Austin, 1984; 
pp.311-312). A developing use is as a reducing agent in selective catalytic reduction of NOx in 
exhaust gases originating from diesel or gasoline direct injection engines. Emissions from urea 
applications should be accounted for in the appropriate application sectors. 
Urea production is a downstream process associated with ammonia production plants. The process 
uses the by-product CO2 stream from an ammonia synthesis plant along with ammonia. 
Urea is produced by the reaction of NH3 and CO2 to produce ammonium carbamate which is then 
dehydrated to urea according to the reactions: 
Ammonium carbamate production: 
2NH3 + CO2 → NH2COONH4 
Dehydration of ammonium carbamate to urea: 
 NH2COONH4 → CO(NH2)2 + H2O 
Assuming complete conversion of NH3 and CO2 to urea, 0.733 tonnes of CO2 are required per 
tonne of urea produced. Greenhouse gas emissions from modern plants are likely to be small. 
Excess NH3 and CO2 are contained in the process water which is formed during the reaction. 
Water treatment is designed to recover these substances from the process water to enable recycling 
of the gases to the synthesis (EIPPCB, 2004a; p.118). Based on typical inputs for modern plants 
(EIPPCB, 2004a; p.121), the input values imply that emissions of CO2 range from 2 to 7kg per 
tonne of urea. For a plant of 1 000 tonnes of urea per day and assuming capacity utilisation of 
around 90 percent, this would imply annual emissions of CO2 of slightly in excess of 2Gg. 
Although emissions from urea production are unlikely to be significant in well-managed modern 
plants, it is good practice to obtain plant-level information on urea production and to account for 
any significant emissions. 
 
Chapter 3: Chemical Industry Emissions 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.17 
3.2.2.4 
COMPLETENESS 
In countries where only a subset of plants report data for the Tier 3 method or where there is a transition from 
Tier 2 to Tier 3, it may not be possible to report emissions using Tier 3 for all facilities during the transition.  
Where data for the Tier 3 method are not available for all plants, Tier 2 could be used for the remaining plants. 
Also, where data for the Tier 2 method are reported by only a subset of plants or where there is a transition from 
Tier 1 to Tier 2, it may be possible to determine the share of production represented by non-reporting plants and 
use this information to estimate the remaining emissions using Tier 1 in order to ensure completeness during the 
transition period.  
Complete coverage for ammonia production requires accounting for all emissions from all sources. CO2 
emissions are straightforward. Completeness can be improved by ensuring that emissions of any fugitive CH4 
either from the primary reformer stage or catalytic methanation of CO2 process are included. In order to include 
emissions of NOx, CO and SO2 from the primary reformer stage, see guidance provided in Chapter 7 of Volume 
1: General Guidance and Reporting. 
3.2.2.5 
DEVELOPING A CONSISTENT TIME SERIES 
CO2 emissions should be recalculated for all years whenever emission calculation methods are changed (e.g., if 
the inventory compiler changes from the use of default values to actual values determined at the plant level). If 
plant-specific data are not available, including plant-specific production data and data for downstream use, for all 
years in the time series, it will be necessary to consider how current plant data can be used to recalculate 
emissions for previous years. It may be possible to apply current plant-specific emission factors to production 
data from previous years, provided that plant operations have not changed substantially. Recalculation is 
required to ensure that any changes in emissions trends are real and not an artefact of changes in procedure. It is 
good practice to recalculate the time series according to the guidance provided in Volume 1, Chapter 5. 
3.2.3 
Uncertainty assessment 
3.2.3.1 
EMISSION FACTOR UNCERTAINTIES 
Uncertainties for the default values shown in Table 3.1 are estimates based on data from EFMA (2000a; p.21) 
and de Beer, Phylipsen and Bates (2001; p.21). In general, default emission factors for gaseous inputs and 
outputs have higher uncertainties than for solid or liquid inputs and outputs. Mass values for gaseous substances 
are influenced by temperature and pressure variations and gases are more easily lost through process leaks. It is 
good practice to obtain uncertainty estimates at the plant level, which should be lower than uncertainty values 
associated with default values. Default emission factor uncertainties reflect variations between plants across 
different locations. 
3.2.3.2 
ACTIVITY DATA UNCERTAINTIES 
Where activity data are obtained from plants, uncertainty estimates can be obtained from producers. These 
activity data are likely to be highly accurate (i.e., with uncertainty as low as ±2 percent). This will include 
uncertainty estimates for fuel use, uncertainty estimates for ammonia production and CO2 recovered. Data that 
are obtained from national statistical agencies usually do not include uncertainty estimates. It is good practice to 
consult with national statistical agencies to obtain information on any sampling errors. Where national statistical 
agencies collect data from the population of ammonia production facilities, uncertainties in national statistics are 
not expected to differ from uncertainties established from plant-level consultations. Where uncertainty values are 
not available from other sources, a default value of ±5 percent can be used. 
3.2.4 
Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC), 
Reporting and Documentation 
3.2.4.1 
QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL 
It is good practice to conduct quality control checks as outlined in Volume 1, Chapter 6. More extensive quality 
control checks and quality assurance procedures are applicable, if higher tier methods are used to determine 
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
3.18 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
emissions. Inventory compilers are encouraged to use higher tier QA/QC for key categories as identified in 
Volume 1, Chapter 4. 
Comparison of emission factors 
Inventory compilers should check if the estimated emission factors are within the range of default emission 
factors provided for the Tier 1 method, and also ensure that the emission factors are consistent with the values 
derived from analysis of the process chemistry. For example, the CO2 generation rate based on natural gas 
should not be less than 1.14 tonnes of CO2 per tonne of ammonia produced. If the emission factors are outside of 
the estimated ranges, it is good practice to assess and document the plant-specific conditions that account for the 
differences. 
Plant-specific data check 
The following plant-specific data are required for adequate auditing of emissions estimates: 
• 
Activity data comprising input and output data (input data should be total fuel requirement – fuel energy 
input plus feedstock input; 
• 
Calculations and estimation method;  
• 
List of assumptions;  
• 
Documentation of any plant-specific measurement method, and measurement results.  
If emission measurements from individual plants are collected, inventory compilers should ensure that the 
measurements were made according to recognised national or international standards. QC procedures in use at 
the site should be directly referenced and included in the QC plan. If the measurement practices were not 
consistent with QC standards, the inventory compiler should reconsider the use of these data. 
3.2.4.2 
REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION 
It is good practice to document and archive all information required to produce the national emissions inventory 
estimates as outlined in Volume 1, Section 6.11. It is not practical to include all documentation in the national 
inventory report. However, the inventory should include summaries of methods used and references to source 
data such that the reported emissions estimates are transparent and steps in their calculation may be retraced.  
Much of the production and process data are considered proprietary by operators, especially where there are only 
a small number of plants within a country. It is good practice to apply appropriate techniques, including 
aggregation of data, to ensure protection of confidential data. Guidance on managing confidential data is 
provided in Section 2.2, Volume 1.

NITRIC ACID PRODUCTION 
3.3.1 
Introduction 
Nitric acid is used as a raw material mainly in the manufacture of nitrogenous-based fertiliser. Nitric acid may 
also be used in the production of adipic acid and explosives (e.g., dynamite), for metal etching and in the 
processing of ferrous metals. 
During the production of nitric acid (HNO3), nitrous oxide (N2O) is generated as an unintended by-product of the 
high temperature catalytic oxidation of ammonia (NH3). The amount of N2O formed depends, inter alia, on 
combustion conditions (pressure, temperature), catalyst composition and age, and burner design (EFMA, 2000b; 
p.15). In addition, some NOx is produced. Formation of NOx is most pronounced at start-up and shut-down when 
the process is least stable (EFMA, 2000b; p.15). N2O is also generated in other industrial processes that use 
nitrogen oxides or nitric acid as feedstocks (e.g. the manufacture of caprolactam, glyoxal, and nuclear fuel 
reprocessing). Nitric acid is a significant source of atmospheric N2O if not abated and is the major source of N2O 
emissions in the chemical industry. While, unlike other emissions from nitric acid production, there are no 
mature technologies specifically designed for the destruction of N2O (Perez-Ramirez et al., 2003) a number of 
technologies for N2O mitigation during nitric acid manufacture have been developed in recent years. Examples 
include a tail-gas process where both N2O and NO emissions can be simultaneously reduced (requiring addition 
of ammonia to the tail-gas), a process-gas option involving direct catalytic decomposition right after the 
platinum gauzes, and a full-scale catalyst decomposition option. 
There are two types of nitric acid plants, single pressure plants and dual pressure plants. In single pressure plants 
the oxidation and absorption take place at essentially the same pressure, and in dual pressure plants absorption 
takes place at a higher pressure than the oxidation stage. 
3.3.2 
Methodological issues 
Nitric acid production involves three distinct chemical reactions that can be summarised as follows: 
4NH3 + 5O2 → 4NO + 6H2O 
2NO + O2  →  2NO2 
3NO2 + H2O  →  2HNO3 + NO 
 
Nitrous oxide generation during the production of nitric acid is not well documented. Nitrogen oxidation steps 
under overall reducing conditions are considered to be potential sources of N2O. Nitric oxide (NO), an 
intermediate in the production of nitric acid, is also documented to readily decompose to N2O and nitrogen 
dioxide (NO2) at high pressures for a temperature range of 30 to 50ºC (Cotton and Wilkinson, 1988). 
Perez-Ramirez et al. (2003; p.123) specify three intermediate reactions during the oxidation of ammonia that 
might result in the formation of N2O: 
NH3 + O2  → 0.5N2O + 1.5H2O 
NH3 + 4NO  → 2.5N2O + 1.5H2O 
NH3 + NO + 0.75O2  → N2O + 1.5H2O 
 
Reactions that lead to the formation of N2O or N2 are undesirable in that they decrease the conversion efficiency 
of NH3 and reduce the yield of the desired product, NO (Perez-Ramirez et al., 2003; p.124). It is not possible to 
define a precise relationship between NH3 input and N2O formation because in general, ‘the amount of N2O 
formed depends on combustion conditions, catalyst composition and state (age), and burner design’ (Perez-
Ramirez et al., 2003; p.123). Emissions of N2O depend on the amount generated in the production process and 
the amount destroyed in any subsequent abatement process. Abatement of N2O can be intentional, through 
installation of equipment designed to destroy N2O, or unintentional in systems designed to abate other emissions 
such as nitrogen oxides (NOx). 
Perez-Ramirez et al. (2003; p.126) classify abatement approaches as follows and abatement measures associated 
with each approach are outlined in Table 3.2:

Primary abatement measures aim at preventing N2O being formed in the ammonia burner. This involves 
modification of the ammonia oxidation process and/or catalyst. 
• 
Secondary abatement measures remove N2O from the valuable intermediate stream, i.e. from the NOx gases 
between the ammonia converter and the absorption column. Usually this will mean intervening at the 
highest temperature, immediately downstream of the ammonia oxidation catalyst. 
• 
Tertiary abatement measures involve treating the tail-gas leaving the absorption column to destroy N2O. The 
most promising position for N2O abatement is upstream of the tail-gas expansion turbine. 
• 
Quaternary abatement measures are the pure end-of-pipe solution, where the tail-gas is treated downstream 
of the expander on its way to the stack.

The abatement achieved will depend on the technology implemented with tertiary measures stated as, ‘enabling 
the achievement of high levels of N2O removal (>99 percent)’ (Perez-Ramirez et al., 2003; p.136). Additionally, 
it is noted that although NSCR is a proven technology for N2O reduction, the replacement of NSCR systems by 
SCR systems for NOx reduction has a negative side-effect on its application for N2O reduction. Further, ‘NSCR 
is most likely not a viable option anymore, due to the high fuel consumption levels and high secondary 
emissions’ (Perez-Ramirez et al., 2003; p.137). 
Future adoption of technologies will depend on cost-effectiveness and the stringency of any emissions regulation. 
More cost-effective options are available for new plants than for existing plants. Tail-gas options are appealing 
since they do not interfere with the process. Direct N2O decomposition is a very attractive and cost effective 
option in plants with tail-gas temperatures greater than 723 K. However, two-thirds of the nitric acid plants in 
Europe have low-temperature tail-gases. To this end, preheating or using reductants (light hydrocarbons or 
ammonia) is required, making the after-treatment prohibitive. The most elegant and cost-effective option is the in 
process-gas catalytic decomposition, located in the heart of the plant (the ammonia burner). Concerns with this 
abatement option are chemical and mechanical stability of the catalyst as well as the possible NO loss. Several 
catalyst manufacturers and nitric acid producers have addressed this problem and catalysts are in the early stages 
of commercialisation. Advantageously, and contrary to the tail-gas option, this technology can be retrospectively 
applied to all existing plants. Further discussion of options is provided in Perez-Ramirez et al. (2003). 
3.3.2.1 
CHOICE OF METHOD 
The choice of good practice method depends on national circumstances. The decision tree in Figure 3.2 
describes good practice in adapting the methods to national circumstances. Emissions can be estimated from:  
• 
continuous emissions monitoring (CEM) where emissions are directly measured at all times;  
Chapter 3: Chemical Industry Emissions 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.21 
• 
periodic emissions monitoring that is undertaken over a period(s) that is reflective of the usual pattern of 
operation of the plant to derive an emission factor that is multiplied by output (100 percent HNO3) to derive 
emissions;  
• 
irregular sampling to derive an emission factor that is multiplied by output (100 percent HNO3) to derive 
emissions;  
• 
by multiplying a default emission factor by output (100 percent HNO3). 
Methods are classified according to the extent of plant-level data that are available. Both Tier 2 and Tier 3 are 
based on plant-level activity data.

Emissions are estimated as follows:

Where: 
EN2O = N2O emissions, kg 
EF = N2O emission factor (default), kg N2O/tonne nitric acid produced 
NAP = nitric acid production, tonnes 
When applying the Tier 1 method it is good practice to assume that there is no abatement of N2O emissions and 
to use the highest default emission factor based on technology type shown in Table 3.3. 
TIER 2 METHOD 
There are a large number of nitric acid plants (estimates range from 255 to 600 plants according to Choe et al., 
1993; Bockman and Granli, 1994) with substantial variations in the N2O generation factors among plant types. 
Consequently, default factors may be needed more often for nitric acid N2O emissions estimates. Where default 
values are used to estimate emissions from nitric acid production, it is good practice to categorise plants 
according to type and to use an appropriate N2O generation factor. 
The Tier 2 method uses plant-level production data disaggregated by technology type and default emission 
factors classified by technology type. Emissions are calculated as follows:

Note that the default emission factors shown in Table 3.3 include the impact on emissions of abatement 
technology where relevant. To use these factors, inventory compilers should verify that the abatement 
technology is installed at individual plants and operated throughout the year.  
The basic equation for estimating N2O emissions includes additional terms that recognise the potential future use 
of N2O abatement technologies. The N2O destruction factor has to be multiplied by an abatement system 
utilisation factor in order to account for any down-time of the emission abatement equipment (i.e., time the 
equipment is not operating).

TIER 3 METHOD – DIRECT MEASUREMENT 
While the tier 2 approach applies technology specific emission factors reflecting the national technology mix. 
Tier 3 is based on real measurement data (e.g., CEMS). Plant-level production data disaggregated by technology 
type and plant level emission factors obtained from direct measurement of emissions. These may be derived 
from irregular sampling of emissions of N2O or periodic emissions monitoring of N2O undertaken over a 
period(s) that reflects the usual pattern of operation of the plant. Emissions can be derived using Equation 3.6. 
Alternatively, the Tier 3 method uses the results of continuous emissions monitoring (CEM), although it is noted 
that most plants are unlikely to employ CEM due to the resource costs. Where CEM is employed, emissions can 
be estimated based on the sum of measured N2O emissions derived from the concentration of N2O in monitored 
emissions for each recorded monitoring interval.

3.3.2.2 
CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTORS 
TIER 1 METHOD 
It is good practice to use the highest emission factor based on the technology type shown in Table 3.3 and to 
assume that there is no abatement of N2O emissions. 
TIER 2 METHOD 
If plant-level factors are not available, it is good practice to use default factors. These default values often 
represent midpoint or mean values of data sets (as determined by expert analysis). The extent to which they 
Chapter 3: Chemical Industry Emissions 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.23 
represent a specific plant’s emission rate is unknown. Default factors in Table 3.3 should be used only in cases 
where plant-specific measurements are not available. 
Table 3.3 includes emission factors for N2O, and associated uncertainties. The factors listed in Table 3.3 for 
plants using non-selective catalytic reduction (NSCR), (a NOx abatement technology that can also be managed to 
abate N2O), already incorporate the effect of N2O abatement measures. To use these factors, inventory compilers 
should verify that the abatement technology is installed at individual plants and operated throughout the year. 
TIER 3 METHOD 
Plant measurements provide the most rigorous data for calculating net emissions (i.e., N2O generation and 
destruction factors). Monitoring N2O emissions from nitric acid production is practical because these are point 
sources and there are a finite number of production plants. Given currently available technology, instrumentation 
for sampling and monitoring emission rates do not limit precision or accuracy of the overall measurement. 
Usually sampling frequency and timing is sufficient to avoid systematic errors and to achieve the desired level of 
accuracy. 
As a general rule, it is good practice to conduct sampling and analysis whenever a plant makes any significant 
process changes that would affect the generation rate of N2O, and sufficiently often otherwise to ensure that 
operating conditions are constant. In addition, plant operators should be consulted annually to determine the 
specific destruction technologies employed and confirm their use, since technologies may change over time. 
Precise measurement of the emissions rate and abatement efficiencies requires measurement of both the exit 
stream and the uncontrolled stream. Where measurement data are available only on the exit stream, good 
practice is to base emissions on these data. In this case, any available estimates of abatement efficiency should 
be provided only for information purposes and are not used to calculate emissions.

3.3.2.3 
CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
It is good practice to compile production data at a level of detail that allows the use of a Tier 2 or Tier 3 method, 
where possible. Activity data should be based on 100 percent HNO3, - it is good practice to ensure that all 
production data reported are for 100 percent HNO3. 
TIER 1 METHOD 
The Tier 1 method requires data on national production of nitric acid. National nitric acid statistics may omit a 
substantial proportion of the national total (see details in Section 3.3.2.4 Completeness). If national-level activity 
data are not available, information on production capacity can be used. It is good practice to multiply the total 
national production capacity by a capacity utilisation factor of 80 percent ± 10 percent (i.e., a range of 70-90 
percent). 
TIER 2 METHOD 
The Tier 2 method requires plant-level production data disaggregated by technology type and abatement system 
type. It is good practice to gather activity (production) data at a level of detail consistent with that of any 
generation and destruction data. Typical plant-level production data is assumed to have an uncertainty of ±2 
percent due to the economic value of having accurate information. 
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
3.24 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
TIER 3 METHOD 
As with the Tier 2 method, plant-level production data disaggregated by technology and abatement system type 
are required. It is good practice to gather activity (production) data at a level of detail consistent with that of any 
generation and destruction data. Although production data are not used in the estimation of emissions where the 
estimate is based on CEM, these data should be collected and reported to ensure that changes in variables that 
influence emissions can be monitored over time. Typical plant-level production data is assumed to have an 
uncertainty of ±2 percent due to the economic value of having accurate information.  
3.3.2.4 
COMPLETENESS 
Nationally compiled nitric acid production statistics could underestimate production. Studies that compare global 
statistics compiled from national data on nitric acid production with industry estimates of global production 
suggest that the national statistics account for only 50 to 70 percent of the total (Bouwman et al., 1995; Olivier, 
1999). This is probably due to nitric acid production that is integrated as part of larger production processes, 
where the nitric acid never enters into commerce and is not counted in the national statistics. It is good practice 
to account for these sources by methods such as identifying them through national registries of NOx emissions, 
another unintended by-product of nitric acid production. 
NSCR and SCR systems designed to abate N2O can give rise to additional emissions of CO, CO2 and 
hydrocarbons (CH4 and NMVOCs). These emissions will depend on the hydrocarbon reducing agent that is used 
(methane (CH4), propane (C3H8), propene (C3H6), LPG). Emissions can be estimated based on the quantity of 
reducing agent used and the completeness of combustion. Plant-level information will be required to enable 
emissions estimation. Over time default values could be developed as more information becomes available, 
however, at present there are no default values. Methods for estimating these emissions are not included in these 
Guidelines, however, inventory compilers are encouraged to investigate these emission sources and to develop 
appropriate methodologies. 
There will usually be few nitric acid plants in a country, and it is suggested that emissions are calculated from 
plant specific data.  In countries where only a subset of plants report data for the Tier 3 method or where there is 
a transition from Tier 2 to Tier 3, it may not be possible to report emissions using Tier 3 for all facilities during 
the transition.  Where data for the Tier 3 method are not available for all plants, Tier 2 could be used for the 
remaining plants. Also, where data for the Tier 2 method are reported by only a subset of plants or where there is 
a transition from Tier 1 to Tier 2, it may be possible to determine the share of production represented by non-
reporting plants and use this information to estimate the remaining emissions using Tier 1 in order to ensure 
completeness during the transition period. 
3.3.2.5 
DEVELOPING A CONSISTENT TIME SERIES 
N2O emissions should be recalculated for all years whenever emission calculation methods are changed (e.g., if 
the inventory compiler changes from the use of default values to actual values determined at the plant level). If 
plant-specific data are not available for all years in the time series, it will be necessary to consider how current 
plant measurements can be used to recalculate emissions for previous years. It may be possible to apply current 
plant-specific emission factors to production data from previous years, provided that plant operations have not 
changed substantially. Such a recalculation is required to ensure that any changes in emissions trends are real 
and not an artefact of changes in procedure. It is good practice to recalculate the time series according to the 
guidance provided in Volume 1, Chapter 5. 
3.3.3 
Uncertainty assessment 
3.3.3.1 
EMISSION FACTOR UNCERTAINTIES 
Uncertainties for the default values shown in Table 3.3 are estimates based on expert judgment. In general, 
default emission factors for gaseous substances have higher uncertainties because mass values for gaseous 
substances are influenced by temperature and pressure variations and gases are more easily lost through process 
leaks. The default values for nitric acid production have a relatively high level of uncertainty for two reasons. 
First, N2O may be generated in the gauze reactor section of nitric acid production as an unintended reaction by-
product (Cook, 1999). Second, the exhaust gas may or may not be treated for NOx control, and the NOx 
Chapter 3: Chemical Industry Emissions 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.25 
abatement system may or may not reduce (or may even increase) the N2O concentration of the treated gas1. It is 
good practice to obtain uncertainty estimates at the plant-level which should be lower than uncertainty values 
associated with default values. 
3.3.3.2 
ACTIVITY DATA UNCERTAINTIES 
Where activity data are obtained from plants, uncertainty estimates can be obtained from producers. Data that are 
obtained from national statistical agencies usually do not include uncertainty estimates. It is good practice to 
consult with national statistical agencies to obtain information on any sampling errors. Where national statistical 
agencies collect data from the population of nitric acid production facilities, uncertainties in national statistics 
are not expected to differ from uncertainties established from plant-level consultations. Where uncertainty values 
are not available from other sources, a default value of ±2 percent can be used. To reduce uncertainty it is good 
practice to ensure that all activity data are for 100 percent HNO3. 
3.3.4 
Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC), 
Reporting and Documentation 
3.3.4.1 
QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL 
It is good practice to conduct quality control checks as outlined in Volume 1, Chapter 6. More extensive quality 
control checks and quality assurance procedures are applicable if higher tier methods are used to determine 
emissions. Inventory compilers are encouraged to use higher tier QA/QC for key categories as identified in 
Volume 1, Chapter 4. 
Comparison of emissions estimates using different approaches 
If emissions are calculated using data from individual nitric acid plants (bottom-up approach), inventory 
compilers should compare the estimate to emissions calculated using national production data (top-down 
approach). They should record the results and investigate any unexplained discrepancies.  
Since industrial N2O source categories are relatively small compared to other anthropogenic and natural sources, 
it is not feasible to compare emissions with measured trends in atmospheric N2O concentrations. 
Plant-level data 
Inventory compilers should archive sufficient information to allow an independent review of the time series of 
emissions beginning in the base year, and to explain trends in emissions when making historical comparisons. 
This is particularly important in cases where recalculations are necessary, for example, when an inventory 
compiler changes from using default values to actual values determined at the plant level. 
Revision of direct emission measurements 
If plant-level N2O measurements are available, inventory compilers should confirm that internationally 
recognised, standard methods were used. If the measurement practices fail this criterion, then they should 
evaluate the use of these emissions data. In addition, they should reconsider the uncertainty estimates in light of 
the QA/QC results. 
Inventory compilers should compare plant-based factors to the IPCC defaults to ensure that the plant-specific 
factors are reasonable. They should explain and document any differences between plant-specific factors and 
default factors, particularly any differences in plant characteristics that might lead to these differences. 
3.3.4.2 
REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION 
It is good practice to document and archive all information required to produce the national emissions inventory 
estimates as outlined in Volume 1, Section 6.11. 
Some examples of specific documentation and reporting relevant to this source category are provided below: 
                                                           
1  In some cases, processes designed to reduce NOx emissions may result in additional N2O generation. Increased N2O 
concentrations due to NOx abatement technology have been measured at various power plants that employ non-catalytic 
reduction for NOx (Cook, 1999). From at least one nitric acid plant, it is known that NOx control resulted in increased N2O 
emissions (Burtscher, 1999).

Plant operators should supply this information to the inventory compiler for compilation, and also archive the 
information at the site. Plant operators should also log and archive the measurement frequencies and 
instrumental calibration records where actual plant measurements are made. 
Where there are only one or two producers in a country, activity data may be considered confidential. In this case, 
operators and the inventory compiler should determine the level of aggregation at which information can be 
reported while still protecting confidentiality. Detailed information including instrumentation records should still 
be archived at the plant level.  
It is not practical to include all documentation in the national inventory report. However, the inventory should 
include summaries of methods used and references to source data such that the reported emissions estimates are 
transparent and steps in their calculation may be retraced.

ADIPIC ACID PRODUCTION 
3.4.1 
Introduction 
Adipic acid is used in the manufacture of a large number of products including synthetic fibres, coatings, plastics, 
urethane foams, elastomers and synthetic lubricants. The production of Nylon 6.6 accounts for the bulk of adipic 
acid use. As noted by Hocking (1998; p.657), ‘A large fraction of this consumption is direct, as adipic acid in the 
production of nylon 6.6, but a substantial fraction of the adipic acid is further processed to give hexamethylene 
diamine, the other monomer required. A further small fraction of the adipic acid is converted into di-octyl (di-2-
ethylhexyl) or di-hexyl esters for use as plasticizers in flexible grades of PVC, etc., or as a high boiling point 
component of synthetic motor oils’. 
3.4.2 
Methodological issues 
Adipic acid is a dicarboxylic acid manufactured from a cyclohexanone/cyclohexanol mixture which is oxidised 
by nitric acid in the presence of a catalyst to form adipic acid. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is generated as an unintended 
by-product of the nitric acid oxidation stage: 
(CH2)5CO (Cyclohexanone)  +  (CH2)5CHOH (Cyclohexanol)  +  wHNO3 → 
HOOC(CH2)4COOH (Adipic Acid) + xN2O + yH2O 
 
Adipic acid is a significant source of atmospheric N2O if not abated. Emissions of N2O depend on the amount 
generated in the production process and the amount destroyed in any subsequent abatement process. Abatement 
of N2O can be intentional through installation of equipment specifically designed to destroy N2O in adipic acid 
plants. Adipic acid production also results in the emissions of NMVOC, CO and NOx. Process emissions from 
the production of adipic acid vary substantially with the level of emission control employed. 
3.4.2.1 
CHOICE OF METHOD 
The decision tree in Figure 3.3 describes good practice in adapting the methods to national circumstances. 
Emissions can be estimated from continuous emissions monitoring (CEM) where emissions are directly 
measured at all times, periodic emissions monitoring that is undertaken over a period(s) that is reflective of the 
usual pattern of operation of the plant to derive an emission factor that is multiplied by output to derive 
emissions, irregular sampling to derive an emission factor that is multiplied by output to derive emissions, or by 
multiplying a default emission factor by output. 
Methods are classified according to the extent of plant-level data that are available. Both Tier 2 and Tier 3 
require plant-level activity data.

Where:

When applying the Tier 1 method it is good practice to assume that there is no abatement of N2O emissions and 
to use the highest default emission factor shown in Table 3.4. 
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
3.28 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
TIER 2 METHOD 
The Tier 2 method uses plant-level production data and default emission factors. Where default values are used 
to estimate emissions, it is good practice to categorise plants according to the abatement technology type 
employed and the utilisation factor of the abatement technology. Emissions are calculated as follows:

AAPi = adipic acid production from technology type i, tonnes 
DFj = destruction factor for abatement technology type j, fraction 
ASUFj = abatement system utilisation factor for abatement technology type j, fraction 
The basic equation for estimating N2O emissions includes additional terms that recognise the use of N2O 
abatement technologies. The N2O destruction factor has to be multiplied by an abatement system utilisation 
factor in order to account for any down-time of the emission abatement equipment (i.e., time the equipment is 
not operating). 
To achieve the highest accuracy, good practice is to apply this equation at the plant-level using N2O generation 
and destruction factors developed from plant-specific measurement data. In this case, the national total is equal 
to the sum of plant totals. Where plant-level information is not available, good practice provides default N2O 
generation factors and destruction factors as shown in Table 3.4, Default Factors for Adipic Acid Production, 
based on abatement technologies implemented. To use these factors, inventory compilers should verify that the 
abatement technology is installed at individual plants and operated throughout the year.  
TIER 3 METHOD – DIRECT MEASUREMENT 
The Tier 3 method uses plant level production data and plant-level emission factors obtained from direct 
measurement of emissions. These may be derived from irregular sampling of emissions of N2O or periodic 
emissions monitoring of N2O undertaken over a period(s) that reflects the usual pattern of operation of the plant. 
Emissions can be derived using Equation 3.8. To achieve the highest accuracy, good practice is to apply this 
equation at the plant-level using N2O generation and destruction factors developed from plant-specific 
measurement data where relevant. Given the relatively small number of adipic acid plants (about 23 globally, 
Choe et al., 1993), obtaining plant-specific information requires few additional resources. 
Alternatively, the Tier 3 method uses the results of continuous emissions monitoring (CEM), although it is noted 
that most plants are unlikely to employ CEM due to the resource costs. Where CEM is employed, emissions can 
be estimated based on the sum of measured N2O emissions derived from the concentration of N2O in monitored 
emissions for each recorded monitoring interval.  
3.4.2.2 
CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTORS 
TIER 1 METHOD 
It is good practice to use the default emission factor shown in Table 3.4 and to assume that there is no abatement 
of N2O emissions. 
TIER 2 METHOD 
If plant-level factors are not available, it is good practice to use default factors. The Tier 2 method is based on 
default emission factors. These default values often represent midpoint or mean values of data sets (as 
determined by expert analysis). The extent to which they represent a specific plant’s emission rate is unknown. 
Default factors in Table 3.4 should be used only in cases where plant-specific measurements are not available. 
Also included in Table 3.4 are default N2O destruction factors for commonly used abatement technologies, and 
associated uncertainties. To use these factors, inventory compilers should verify that the abatement technology is 
installed at individual plants and operated throughout the year. Failure to determine if abatement technologies 
Chapter 3: Chemical Industry Emissions 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.29 
are being used can result in overestimation of emissions. Determination of the appropriate values requires that 
plants be classified according to the abatement technology implemented.. 
TIER 3 METHOD 
The Tier 3 method requires plant measurements. If the N2O abatement system is in use, plant measurements 
provide the most rigorous data for calculating net emissions (i.e., N2O generation and destruction factors). 
Monitoring N2O emissions from adipic acid production is practical because these are point sources and there are 
a finite number of production plants. Given currently available technology, instrumentation for sampling and 
monitoring emission rates do not limit precision or accuracy of the overall measurement. Usually sampling 
frequency and timing is sufficient to avoid systematic errors and to achieve the desired level of accuracy. 
Where the N2O abatement system is not in use, a plant-specific emission factor can be obtained from periodic 
monitoring of emissions which is multiplied by the production level to estimate plant-level emissions.  
As a general rule, it is good practice to conduct sampling and analysis whenever a plant makes any significant 
process changes that would affect the generation rate of N2O, and sufficiently often otherwise to ensure that 
operating conditions are constant. In addition, plant operators should be consulted annually to determine the 
specific destruction technologies employed and confirm their use, since technologies may change over time. 
Precise measurement of the emissions rate and abatement efficiencies requires measurement of both the exit 
stream and the uncontrolled stream. Where measurement data are available only on the exit stream, good 
practice is to base emissions on these data. In this case, any available estimates of abatement efficiency should 
be provided only for information purposes and not used to calculate emissions.

plant known to use this method. 
b The destruction factor (that represents the technology abatement efficiency) should be multiplied by an abatement system utility 
factor.  
c Note that these default values are based on expert judgement and not industry-supplied data or plant-specific measurements. In the first 
1-5 years of the abatement technology implementation, the utilisation factor tends to be at the lower end of the range. Lower utility of 
the equipment typically results because of the need to learn how to operate the abatement system and because more maintenance 
problems occur during the initial phase. After 1-5 years, the operating experience improves and the utilisation factor would tend to be 
at the high end of the range.

3.4.2.3 
CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
It is good practice to compile production data at a level of detail that allows the use of a Tier 2 or Tier 3 method.  
TIER 1 METHOD 
The Tier 1 method requires data on national production of adipic acid. If national-level activity data are not 
available, information on production capacity can be used. It is good practice to multiply the total national 
production capacity by a capacity utilisation factor of 80 percent ± 10 percent (i.e., a range of 70-90 percent). 
TIER 2 METHOD 
The Tier 2 method requires plant-level production data disaggregated by abatement technology type. It is good 
practice to gather activity (production) data at a level of detail consistent with that of any generation and 
destruction data. Typical plant-level production data is accurate to ±2 percent due to the economic value of 
having accurate information. 
Chapter 3: Chemical Industry Emissions 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.31 
TIER 3 METHOD 
As with the Tier 2 method, plant-level production data disaggregated by abatement technology type are required 
when emissions estimates are derived using data from irregular or periodic sampling of emissions. It is good 
practice to gather activity (production) data at a level of detail consistent with that of any generation and 
destruction data. Although production is not used in the estimation of emissions where the estimate is based on 
CEM, these data should be collected and reported to ensure that changes in variables that influence emissions 
can be monitored over time. Typical plant-level production data is accurate to ±2 percent due to the economic 
value of having accurate information.  
3.4.2.4 
COMPLETENESS 
Complete coverage for the adipic acid source category is straightforward because of the small number of readily 
identifiable plants. 
3.4.2.5 
DEVELOPING A CONSISTENT TIME SERIES 
N2O emissions should be recalculated for all years whenever emission calculation methods are changed (e.g., if 
the inventory compiler changes from the use of default values to actual values determined at the plant level). If 
plant-specific data are not available for all years in the time series, it will be necessary to consider how current 
plant measurements can be used to recalculate emissions for previous years. It may be possible to apply current 
plant-specific emission factors to production data from previous years, provided that plant operations have not 
changed substantially. Such a recalculation is required to ensure that any changes in emissions trends are real 
and not an artefact of changes in procedure. It is good practice to recalculate the time series according to the 
guidance provided in Volume 1, Chapter 5. 
3.4.3 
Uncertainty assessment 
3.4.3.1 
EMISSION FACTOR UNCERTAINTIES 
Uncertainties for the default values shown in Table 3.4 are estimates based on expert judgement. In general, 
adipic acid default emission factors are relatively certain because they are derived from the stoichiometry of an 
intended chemical reaction (nitric acid oxidation) and N2O-specific abatement systems. The uncertainty in the 
emission factor for adipic acid represents a variability in N2O generation due to differences in the composition of 
the cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol feedstock (i.e. ketone and alcohol) that are used by different manufacturers. 
Higher ketone content results in increased N2O generation, whereas higher alcohol content results in less N2O 
generation (Reimer, 1999a). Dependent on the process, based on nitric acid (HNO3) consumption an individual 
plant should be able to determine the production of N2O within 1 percent. Uncertainties for the default values are 
shown in Table 3.4. 
3.4.3.2 
ACTIVITY DATA UNCERTAINTIES 
Potential N2O emissions per metric tonne produced are far greater for adipic acid production than for other 
industrial sources of N2O. Measurements obtained from a properly maintained and calibrated monitoring system 
can determine emissions using Equation 3.8 to within ±5 percent at the 95 percent confidence level. Given the 
small number of adipic acid plants, the uncertainty in national production data (Tier 1) is the same as for plant-
level data, namely, ±2 percent. 
3.4.4 
Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC), 
Reporting and Documentation 
3.4.4.1 
QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL 
It is good practice to conduct quality control checks as outlined in Volume 1, Chapter 6, and an expert review of 
the emissions estimates. Additional quality control checks as outlined in Volume 1 and quality assurance 
procedures may also be applicable, particularly if higher tier methods are used to determine emissions from this 
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
3.32 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
source category. Inventory compilers are encouraged to use higher tier QA/QC for key categories as identified in 
Volume 1, Chapter 4. 
In addition to the guidance in Volume 1, specific procedures of relevance to this source category are outlined 
below. 
Comparison of emissions estimates using different approaches 
If emissions are calculated using data from individual adipic acid plants (bottom-up approach), inventory 
compilers should compare the estimate to emissions calculated using national production data (top-down 
approach). They should record the results and investigate any unexplained discrepancies.  
Since industrial N2O source categories are relatively small compared to other anthropogenic and natural sources, 
it is not feasible to compare emissions with measured trends in atmospheric N2O concentrations. 
Plant-level data 
Inventory compilers should archive sufficient information to allow an independent review of the time series of 
emissions beginning in the base year, and to explain trends in emissions when making historical comparisons. 
This is particularly important in cases where recalculations are necessary, for example, when an inventory 
compiler changes from using default values to actual values determined at the plant level. 
Revision of direct emission measurements 
If plant-level N2O measurements are available, it is suggested that inventory compilers confirm that 
internationally recognised, standard methods were used. If the measurement practices fail this criterion, then they 
should evaluate the use of these emissions data. In addition, they should reconsider the uncertainty estimates in 
light of the QA/QC results. 
Inventory compilers are encouraged to compare plant-based factors to the IPCC defaults to ensure that the plant-
specific factors are reasonable. They should explain and document any differences between plant-specific factors 
and default factors, particularly any differences in plant characteristics that might lead to these differences. 
3.4.4.2 
REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION 
It is good practice to document and archive all information required to produce the national emissions inventory 
estimates as outlined in Volume 1, Section 6.11. 
Some examples of specific documentation and reporting relevant to this source category are provided below: 
• 
Description of the method used; 
• 
Number of adipic acid plants; 
• 
Emission factors; 
• 
Production data; 
• 
Production capacity;  
• 
Number of plants using abatement technology; 
• 
Type of abatement technology, destruction efficiency, and utilisation;  
• 
Any other assumptions. 
Plant operators should supply this information to the inventory compiler for compilation, and also archive the 
information at the site. Plant operators should also log and archive the measurement frequencies and 
instrumental calibration records where actual plant measurements are made. 
Where there are only one or two producers in a country, as could often be the case for adipic acid production, 
activity data may be considered confidential. In this case, operators and the inventory compiler should determine 
the level of aggregation at which information can be reported while still protecting confidentiality. Detailed 
information including instrumentation records should still be archived at the plant level.  
It is not practical to include all documentation in the national inventory report. However, the inventory should 
include summaries of methods used and references to source data such that the reported emissions estimates are 
transparent and steps in their calculation may be retraced.

CAPROLACTAM, GLYOXAL AND GLYOXYLIC 
ACID PRODUCTION 
3.5.1 
Introduction 
This section addresses the production of three chemicals - caprolactam, glyoxal, and glyoxylic acid - that are 
potentially important sources of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in the countries in which the chemicals are 
produced. The methodology for caprolactam is discussed in detail and is suitable for application to estimation of 
emissions from glyoxal and glyoxylic acid. In Section 3.5.3, the production processes for glyoxal and glyoxylic 
acid that give rise to emissions of N2O are outlined. Default generation factors, destruction factors, and emission 
factors are provided based on information from Clariant (France) (Babusiaux, 2005). 
3.5.2 
Caprolactam 
Almost all of the annual production of caprolactam (C6H11NO) is consumed as the monomer for nylon-6 fibres 
and plastics (Kirk-Othmer, 1999; p.310), with a substantial proportion of the fibre used in carpet manufacturing. 
All commercial processes for the manufacture of caprolactam are based on either toluene or benzene. 
3.5.2.1 
METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES 
Where caprolactam is produced from benzene, the main process, the benzene is hydrogenated to cyclohexane 
which is then oxidised to produce cyclohexanone (C6H10O). The classical route (Raschig process) and basic 
reaction equations for production from cyclohexanone are (Reimschuessel, 1977; p.83: Lowenheim and Moran, 
1975; p. 201): 
Oxidation of NH3 to NO/NO2 
↓ 
NH3 reacted with CO2/H2O to yield ammonium carbonate (NH4)2CO3 
↓ 
(NH4)2CO3 reacted with NO/NO2 (from NH3 oxidation) to yield ammonium nitrite (NH4NO2) 
↓ 
NH3 reacted with SO2/H2O to yield ammonium bisulphite (NH4HSO3) 
↓ 
NH4NO2 and NH4HSO3 reacted to yield hydroxylamine disulphonate (NOH(SO3NH4)2) 
↓ 
NOH(SO3NH4)2 hydrolised to yield hydroxylamine sulphate (NH2OH)2.H2SO4) and ammonium 
sulphate ((NH4)2SO4) 
↓ 
Cyclohexanone reaction: 
C6H10O + ½(NH2OH)2.H2SO4 (+NH3 and H2SO4) → C6H10NOH + (NH4)2SO4 + H2O 
Beckmann rearrangement: 
C6H10NOH (+H2SO4 and SO2) → C6H11NO.H2SO4 (+4NH3 and H2O) → C6H11NO + 2(NH4)2SO4 
 
Lowenheim and Moran (1975; p. 202) summarise the Raschig production process as follows. Caprolactam is 
produced via Beckmann rearrangement (conversion of a ketone oxime into an amide, usually using sulphuric 
acid as a catalyst) by the addition of hydroxylamine sulphate to cyclohexanone. Hydroxylamine sulphate is 
produced from ammonium nitrate and sulphur dioxide. Ammonia gas and air are fed to a converter where 
ammonia is converted to hydroxylamine disulphonate by contacting it with ammonium carbonate and sulphur 
dioxide in series. Ammonium carbonate is produced by dissolving ammonia and carbon dioxide in water, and 
sulphur dioxide by burning sulphur. The disulphonate is hydrolysed to hydroxylamine sulphate and ammonium 
sulphate. The addition of hydroxylamine sulphate to cyclohexanone produces cyclohexanone oxime which is 
converted to caprolactam by the Beckmann rearrangement. 
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
3.34 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Production of caprolactam can give rise to emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) from the ammonia oxidation step, 
emissions of CO2 from the ammonium carbonate step, emissions of sulphur dioxide (SO2) from the ammonium 
bisulphite step, and emissions of NMVOCs. Emissions of CO2, SO2 and NMVOCs from the conventional 
process are unlikely to be significant in well-managed plants. The main greenhouse gas to be accounted for from 
caprolactam production is N2O. Modified caprolactam production processes are primarily concerned with 
elimination of the high volumes of ammonium sulphate that are produced as a by-product of the conventional 
process (Reimschuessel, 1977; p.84). NH3 oxidation remains an integral part of all processes to obtain the 
NO/NO2 required. 
 
CHOICE OF METHOD 
Estimation of emissions of N2O from caprolactam production can be treated as analogous to estimation of 
emissions of N2O from nitric acid production. Both production processes involve an initial step of NH3 oxidation 
which is the source of N2O formation and emissions. 
The choice of good practice method depends on national circumstances. The decision tree in Figure 3.4 
describes good practice in adapting the methods to national circumstances. Emissions can be estimated from 
continuous emissions monitoring (CEM) where emissions are directly measured at all times, periodic emissions 
monitoring that is undertaken over a period(s) that is reflective of the usual pattern of operation of the plant to 
derive an emission factor that is multiplied by output to derive emissions, irregular sampling to derive an 
emission factor that is multiplied by output  to derive emissions, or by multiplying a default emission factor by 
output. 
Methods are classified according to the extent of plant-level data that are available. Both Tier 2 and Tier 3 are 
require plant-level activity data. 
Tier 1 method 
Emissions are estimated as follows: 
EQUATION 3.9 
N2O EMISSIONS FROM CAPROLACTAM PRODUCTION – TIER 1 
CP
EF
E
N O
•
=
2
 
Where: 
EN2O = N2O emissions, kg 
EF = N2O emission factor (default), kg N2O/tonne caprolactam produced 
CP = caprolactam production, tonnes 
When applying the Tier 1 method it is good practice to assume that there is no abatement of N2O emissions and 
to use the highest default emission factor shown in Table 3.5. 
Tier 2 method 
Information on emissions arising from caprolactam production and control technologies is limited. Where plant-
level information is not available, good practice provides default N2O generation factors as shown in Table 3.5. 
The default factors are based on N2O emissions from nitric acid plants because there is no information on 
caprolactam plants and the initial reaction step of oxidation of ammonia is similar for both processes. Good 
practice encourages the development of factors specific to caprolactam plants.  
The number of caprolactam plants is relatively small (approximately 42 plants with around 19 plants using DSM 
(Stamicarbon) technology). It is unlikely that there are substantial variations in the N2O generation factors 
between plants. Where default values are used to estimate emissions from caprolactam production, it is good 
practice to ascertain the extent to which plant emissions vary according to type and to use an appropriate N2O 
generation factor. 
The Tier 2 method uses plant-level production data disaggregated by technology type and default emission 
factors classified by technology type. Emissions are calculated as follows:

CPi = caprolactam production from technology type i, tonnes 
DFj = destruction factor for abatement technology type j, fraction 
ASUFj = abatement system utilisation factor for abatement technology type j, fraction 
The basic equation for estimating N2O emissions includes additional terms that recognise current and the 
potential future use of N2O abatement technologies. The N2O destruction factor has to be multiplied by an 
abatement system utilisation factor in order to account for any down-time of the emission abatement equipment 
(i.e. time the equipment is not operating). 
Where plant-level information is not available, good practice provides default N2O generation factors as shown 
in Table 3.5, Default Factors for Caprolactam Production, based on plant types classified by age. To achieve the 
highest accuracy, good practice is to apply Equation 3.10 at the plant-level taking into account N2O generation 
and destruction factors developed from plant-specific measurement data. In this case, the national total is equal 
to the sum of plant totals. 
Tier 3 method – direct measurement 
The Tier 3 method uses plant level production data and plant-level emission factors obtained from direct 
measurement of emissions. These may be derived from irregular sampling of emissions of N2O or periodic 
emissions monitoring of N2O undertaken over a period(s) that reflects the usual pattern of operation of the plant. 
Emissions can be derived using Equation 3.10. 
Alternatively, the Tier 3 method uses the results of continuous emissions monitoring (CEM), although it is noted 
that most plants are unlikely to employ CEM due to the resource costs. Where CEM is employed, emissions can 
be estimated based on the sum of measured N2O emissions derived from the concentration of N2O in monitored 
emissions for each recorded monitoring interval. 
 
CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTORS 
Tier 1 method 
It is good practice to use the emission factor shown in Table 3.5 and to assume that there is no abatement of N2O 
emissions. 
Tier 2 method 
If plant-level factors are not available, it is good practice to use default factors. The Tier 2 method uses a default 
factor. Default values often represent midpoint or mean values of data sets (as determined by expert analysis). 
The extent to which they represent a specific plant’s emission rate is unknown. This is especially true for 
caprolactam production where the value is based on high pressure nitric acid plants. Default factor in Table 3.5 
should be used only in cases where plant-specific measurements are not available. 
Tier 3 method 
Plant measurements provide the most rigorous data for calculating net emissions (i.e., N2O generation and 
destruction factors). Monitoring N2O emissions from caprolactam production is practical because these are point 
sources and there are a finite number of production plants. Given currently available technology, instrumentation 
for sampling and monitoring emission rates do not limit precision or accuracy of the overall measurement. 
Usually sampling frequency and timing is sufficient to avoid systematic errors and to achieve the desired level of 
accuracy. 
As a general rule, it is good practice to conduct sampling and analysis whenever a plant makes any significant 
process changes that would affect the generation rate of N2O, and sufficiently often otherwise to ensure that 
operating conditions are constant. In addition, plant operators should be consulted annually to determine the 
specific destruction technologies employed and confirm their use, since technologies may change over time. 
Precise measurement of the emissions rate and abatement efficiencies requires measurement of both the exit 
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use

2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
stream and the uncontrolled stream. Where measurement data are available only on the exit stream, good 
practice is to base emissions on these data. In this case, any available estimates of abatement efficiency should 
be provided only for information purposes and not used to calculate emissions.

CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
It is good practice to compile production data at a level of detail that allows the use of Tier 2 or Tier 3 method. 
Tier 1 method 
The Tier 1 method requires data on national production of caprolactam. If national-level activity data are not 
available, information on production capacity can be used. It is good practice to multiply the total national 
production capacity by a capacity utilisation factor of 80 percent ± 20 percent (i.e., a range of 60-100 percent). 
Tier 2 method 
The Tier 2 method requires plant-level production data disaggregated by the age the plant. If additional 
information on technology type and abatement technology is available, it is good practice to collect this 
information and disaggregate production data according to the information obtained. That is, it is good practice 
to gather activity (production) data at a level of detail consistent with that of generation and destruction data. 
Where plant-level emission factors are used, good practice is to collect plant-level production data. Typical 
plant-level production data are accurate to ±2 percent due to the economic value of having accurate information. 
Tier 3 method 
The Tier 3 method require plant-level production data disaggregated by technology type when emissions 
estimates are derived using data from irregular or periodic sampling of emissions.  It is good practice to collect 
activity (production) data at a level of detail consistent with that of any generation and destruction data. 
Although production is not used in the estimation of emissions where the estimate is based on CEM, these data 
should be collected and reported to ensure that changes in variables that influence emissions can be monitored 
over time. Typical plant-level production data are accurate to ±2 percent due to the economic value of having 
accurate information. 
 
COMPLETENESS 
Complete coverage requires accounting for all plants and emissions of all direct greenhouse gases. In addition to 
N2O, there may be non-combustion emissions of CO2, NOx, NMVOCs and SO2. In order to include emissions of 
the indirect greenhouse gases (NOx, NMVOCs and SO2), see guidance provided in Chapter 7 of Volume 1: 
General Guidance and Reporting. Plant-level information will be required to enable emissions estimation. Over 
time default values could be developed as more information becomes available. 
There will be few caprolactam plants in a country, and it is suggested that emissions are calculated from plant 
specific data. 
DEVELOPING A CONSISTENT TIME SERIES 
N2O emissions should be recalculated for all years whenever emission calculation methods are changed (e.g., if 
the inventory compiler changes from the use of default values to actual values determined at the plant level). If 
plant-specific data are not available for all years in the time series, it will be necessary to consider how current 
plant measurements can be used to recalculate emissions for previous years. It may be possible to apply current 
plant-specific emission factors to production data from previous years, provided that plant operations have not 
changed substantially. Such a recalculation is required to ensure that any changes in emissions trends are real 
and not an artefact of changes in procedure. It is good practice to recalculate the time series according to the 
guidance provided in Volume 1, Chapter 5. 
3.5.2.2 
UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT 
EMISSION FACTOR UNCERTAINTIES 
Uncertainties for the default value shown in Table 3.5 is an estimate based on default values for nitric acid plants. 
In general, default emission factors for gaseous substances have higher uncertainties because mass values for 
gaseous substances are influenced by temperature and pressure variations and gases are more easily lost through 
process leaks. The default values for caprolactam production have a relatively high level of uncertainty due to 
the limited information available. It is good practice to obtain uncertainty estimates at the plant-level which 
should be lower than uncertainty values associated with default values. 
ACTIVITY DATA UNCERTAINTIES 
Where activity data are obtained from plants, uncertainty estimates can be obtained from producers. Data that are 
obtained from national statistical agencies usually do not include uncertainty estimates. It is good practice to 
consult with national statistical agencies to obtain information on any sampling errors. Where national statistical 
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
3.38 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
agencies collect data from the population of nitric acid production facilities, uncertainties in national statistics 
are not expected to differ from uncertainties established from plant-level consultations. Where uncertainty values 
are not available from other sources, a default value of ±2 percent can be used. 
3.5.2.3 
QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL (QA/QC), 
REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION 
QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL 
It is good practice to conduct quality control checks as outlined in Volume 1, Chapter 6. More extensive quality 
control checks and quality assurance procedures are applicable if higher tier methods are used to determine 
emissions. Inventory compilers are encouraged to use higher tier QA/QC for key categories as identified in 
Volume 1, Chapter 4. 
Comparison of emissions estimates using different approaches 
If emissions are calculated using data from individual caprolactam plants (bottom-up approach), inventory 
compilers should compare the estimate to emissions calculated using national production data (top-down 
approach). They should record the results and investigate any unexplained discrepancies.  
Since industrial N2O source categories are relatively small compared to other anthropogenic and natural sources, 
it is not feasible to compare emissions with measured trends in atmospheric N2O concentrations. 
Plant-level data 
Inventory compilers should archive sufficient information to allow an independent review of the time series of 
emissions beginning in the base year, and to explain trends in emissions when making historical comparisons. 
This is particularly important in cases where recalculations are necessary, for example, when an inventory 
compiler changes from using default values to actual values determined at the plant level. 
Revision of direct emission measurements 
If plant-level N2O measurements are available, inventory compilers should confirm that internationally 
recognised, standard methods were used. If the measurement practices fail this criterion, then they should 
evaluate the use of these emissions data. In addition, they should reconsider the uncertainty estimates in light of 
the QA/QC results. 
Inventory compilers should compare plant-based factors to the IPCC defaults to ensure that the plant-specific 
factors are reasonable. They should explain and document any differences between plant-specific factors and 
default factors, particularly any differences in plant characteristics that might lead to these differences. 
 
REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION 
It is good practice to document and archive all information required to produce the national emissions inventory 
estimates as outlined in Volume 1, Section 6.11. 
Some examples of specific documentation and reporting relevant to this source category are provided below: 
• 
Description of the method used; 
• 
Number of caprolactam plants; 
• 
Emission factors; 
• 
Production data; 
• 
Production capacity;  
• 
Number of plants using abatement technology; 
• 
Type of abatement technology, destruction efficiency, and utilisation;  
• 
Any other assumptions. 
Plant operators should supply this information to the inventory compiler for compilation, and also archive the 
information at the site. Plant operators should also log and archive the measurement frequencies and 
instrumental calibration records where actual plant measurements are made. 
Where there are only one or two producers in a country as will be the case for caprolactam producers, activity 
data may be considered confidential. In this case, operators and the inventory compiler should determine the 
Chapter 3: Chemical Industry Emissions 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.39 
level of aggregation at which information can be reported while still protecting confidentiality. Detailed 
information including instrumentation records should still be archived at the plant level. 
It is not practical to include all documentation in the national inventory report. However, the inventory should 
include summaries of methods used and references to source data such that the reported emissions estimates are 
transparent and steps in their calculation may be retraced. 
3.5.3 
Glyoxal and glyoxylic acid production 
Glyoxal (ethanedial) (C2H2O2) is produced from oxidation of acetaldehyde (ethanal) (C2H4O) with concentrated 
nitric acid (HNO3). Glyoxal can also be produced from catalytic oxidation of ethylene glycol (ethanediol) 
(CH2OHCH2OH). Glyoxal is used as a crosslinking agent for vinyl acetate/acrylic resins, disinfectant, gelatine 
hardening agent, textile finishing agent (permanent-press cotton, rayon fabrics), wet-resistance additive (paper 
coatings) (Ashford, 1994; p.454). 
Glyoxylic acid is produced by nitric acid oxidation of glyoxal. Glyoxylic acid is used for the production of 
synthetic aromas, agrochemicals and pharmaceutical intermediates (Babusiaux, 2005; p.1). 
The basic reaction equation for the production of glyoxal from acetaldehyde is: 
2C2H4O (Acetaldehyde) + 2HNO3 → 2C2H2O2 (Glyoxal) + N2O + 3 H2O 
The stoichiometric relationship indicates that complete reaction will result in 0.379 tonnes of N2O per tonne of 
glyoxal. Under commercial conditions, the yield of N2O per tonne of glyoxal is approximately 0.52 tonnes 
(Babusiaux, 2005; p.1). 
Glyoxylic acid production is a batch process where nitric acid is reduced to NO and N2O with NO recovered as 
HNO3 in the process. N2O arises in the production process through a secondary reaction where glyoxal is 
converted to oxalic acid (COOH)2. 
Default factors for glyoxal and glyoxylic acid production are shown in Table 3.6. Emissions can be estimated 
using the same approach as described in the foregoing for caprolactam. To use default destruction factors, 
inventory compilers should verify that the abatement technology is installed at individual plants and operated 
throughout the year.

CARBIDE PRODUCTION 
3.6.1 
Introduction 
Greenhouse gas emissions are associated with production of silicon carbide (SiC) and calcium carbide (CaC2). 
The production of carbide can result in emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), carbon monoxide 
(CO) and sulphur dioxide (SO2). Silicon carbide is a significant artificial abrasive. It is produced from silica sand 
or quartz and petroleum coke. Calcium carbide is used in the production of acetylene, in the manufacture of 
cyanamide (a minor historical use), and as a reductant in electric arc steel furnaces. It is made from two carbon-
containing raw materials: calcium carbonate (limestone) and petroleum coke. 
Use of carbon-containing raw materials in the production processes result in emissions of CO2 and CO. The 
presence of hydrogen-containing volatile compounds and sulphur (S) in the petroleum coke may cause formation 
and emission to the atmosphere of CH4 and SO2. 
3.6.2 
Methodological issues 
CO2 AND CH4 FROM SILICON CARBIDE PRODUCTION 
Silicon carbide is produced from silica sand or quartz and petroleum coke, which is used as a carbon source, 
according to the reactions (Austin, 1984; p. 262): 
SiO2 + 2C  → Si + 2CO 
Si + C  → SiC 
The formula describing the overall reaction is given below but in practice it does not proceed in the 
stoichiometric proportions indicated: 
SiO2 + 3C  → SiC + 2CO (+ O2 → 2CO2) 
In the production process, silica sand and carbon are mixed in an approximate molar ratio of 1:3. Some carbon, 
about 35 percent, is contained in the product and the rest is converted to CO2 in excess oxygen and released to 
the atmosphere as a process by-product. 
The petroleum coke used in this process may contain volatile compounds, which will form methane. Some 
methane will escape to the atmosphere, particularly during start-up.  
CO2 FROM CALCIUM CARBIDE PRODUCTION 
Calcium carbide (CaC2) is made by heating calcium carbonate (limestone) and subsequently reducing CaO with 
carbon e.g., petroleum coke. Both steps lead to emissions of CO2. Around 67 percent of the carbon from 
petroleum coke will be contained in the product.  
The basic reactions are: 
CaCO3 → CaO + CO2 
CaO + 3C → CaC2 + CO (+ ½ O2 → CO2) 
The CO gas will be used as an energy source in most plants. 
 
BOX 3.4 
DOUBLE COUNTING 
To avoid double counting, CO2 emission from combusting CO gas generated in the process of 
CaC2 production should be accounted in the IPPU Sector, and should not be included in the 
Energy Sector. Petroleum coke used in the production process should be deducted from the 
Energy Sector as a non-energy use of petroleum coke. 
 
The most important application of calcium carbide is producing acetylene (C2H2) by reacting CaC2 with water. A 
substantial use of acetylene is welding applications. Acetylene is also used in chemical synthesis for the 
Chapter 3: Chemical Industry Emissions 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.41 
production of acetaldehyde, acetic acid, acetic anhydride, and as a feedstock to manufacture ‘acetylene black’, a 
form of carbon black. Frequently, acetylene is not produced within the same plant that produces CaC2 and this 
needs to be taken into account when applying higher tier methods to estimating CO2 emissions from CaC2 use.  
Use of acetylene in chemical synthesis and production of acetylene black results in carbon contained in the 
products reducing the total emissions of CO2 that are related to CaC2 use. Acetylene may be produced from 
partial oxidation of natural gas as well as from CaC2. The approach to accounting for acetylene in these uses is 
outlined in Section 3.9 of this volume. 
Production and use of acetylene for welding applications is summarised by reaction: 
CaC2 + 2H2O → Ca(OH)2 + C2H2 (+ 2.5O2 → 2CO2 + H2O) 
Where acetylene is used in welding applications, emissions can be derived from the quantity of CaC2 used in the 
production of this acetylene on the assumption that the acetylene will be used in a relatively short period of time 
after production. 
 
BOX 3.5 
ALLOCATION OF EMISSIONS FROM CaO PRODUCTION 
CaO (lime) might be produced in-house or at a plant other than the carbide plant. In either case, the 
emissions from the CaO step should be reported as emissions from lime production (Section 2.3 of 
this volume) and only the emissions from reaction of CaO with petroleum coke and use of the 
product to produce acetylene for welding applications should be reported as emissions from 
calcium carbide. 
 
3.6.2.1 
CHOICE OF METHOD 
Methods are classified according the extent of plant-level data that are available. The Tier 1 method is based on 
default values and national statistics. Tier 2 is based on plant-level data on production and use of CaC2 in 
acetylene production for welding applications. The Tier 3 method is based on plant-level data on petroleum coke 
input (including the carbon content factor (CCF) and carbon oxidation factor (COF) if available; alternatively, 
country specific Energy Sector values may be used), use of CaC2 in acetylene production for welding 
applications, and plant-level emission factors where relevant. 
Both Tier 2 and Tier 3 are based on plant-level activity data. The choice of method to estimate emissions of CO2 
and CH4 depends on national circumstances as shown in Figure 3.5. 
CO2 AND CH4 FROM CARBIDE PRODUCTION 
Tier 1 method 
Emissions from carbide production can be estimated from activity data (AD) on petroleum coke consumption or 
carbide production, calcium carbide used in the production of acetylene used in welding applications, and default 
emission factors. Where AD on petroleum coke consumption are used the CCF and COF of the petroleum coke 
can be obtained from Volume 2, Chapter 1 and the result must be multiplied by 44/12 to convert C to CO2. The 
basic equation for estimating emissions is: 
EQUATION 3.11 
EMISSIONS FROM CARBIDE PRODUCTION 
EF
AD
ECO
•
2 =
 
Where: 
ECO2 = emissions of CO2, tonnes 
AD = activity data on petroleum coke consumption or carbide production, tonnes raw material used or 
tonnes carbide produced 
EF = CO2 emission factor. There are two options as follows:  
When carbide production is used as activity data, EF should be average CO2 emissions per unit of 
output for carbide production, tonnes CO2/tonne carbide production. 
When petroleum coke consumption is used as activity data, EF should be CCF (carbon content 
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
3.42 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
factor) multiplied by COF (carbon oxidation factor) multiplied by 44/12 and adjusted to account for 
the C contained in the product, tonnes CO2/tonne material used 
Adjustment factor for SiC = 0.35 ⇒ Emission factor = 0.65 • CCF • COF • 44/12; 
Adjustment factor for CaC2 = 0.67 ⇒ Emission factor = 0.33 • CCF • COF • 44/12. 
Equation 3.11 can also be used to estimate CH4 emissions, where EF is the appropriate emission factor for CH4. 
Estimation of emissions from CaC2 needs to include emissions of CO2 indirectly attributable to CaC2 that is used 
in acetylene production. Equation 3.11 can be applied where AD is the amount of CaC2 used and EF is the 
emission factor associated with this use. Under the Tier 1 method it is good practice to assume that all CaC2 used 
in acetylene production gives rise to CO2 emissions. 
Tier 2 method 
The Tier 2 method uses plant-level data on production of carbide and the amount of C contained in the product. 
For CaC2, data on the use of CaC2 for the production of acetylene used in welding applications is also required. 
Emissions from production and use can be estimated with Equation 3.11 using default emission factors. Where 
acetylene is produced from CaC2 at another location and the quantity of CaC2 used for this purpose is not known, 
it is good practice to document this fact. 
Tier 3 method 
The Tier 3 method requires plant-level data on the petroleum coke input along with the CCF and COF if 
available; alternatively, country specific Energy Sector values for CCF and COF may be used. Plant-level data 
on the amount of C contained in the product are also required. 
In the case of CaC2, data on the use of CaC2 for the production of acetylene used in welding applications are 
required, as are plant-level emission factors. Where acetylene is produced from CaC2 at another location and the 
quantity of CaC2 used for this purpose is not known, it is good practice to document this fact. In addition, plant-
level emission factors for CH4 need to be collected. Equation 3.11 can be applied to estimate emissions for each 
plant and total national emissions are the sum of these estimates. 
Production data are not used in the calculation but should be collected for reporting purposes. Where acetylene 
production data cannot be disaggregated by use, national inventory compilers using the Tier 3 method are 
encouraged to account for any emissions at the point where they arise; for example, emissions from acetylene 
use in welding applications should be accounted for at the point of use of acetylene using a country specific 
emission factor. A similar approach should be followed for other uses of acetylene.

3.6.2.2 
CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTORS 
Tier 1 method 
The Tier 1 method uses default values for CCF, COF and C contained in the product where petroleum coke is 
used in the estimation. Alternatively, where carbide production is used, the method uses default emission factors 
shown in Tables 3.7 and 3.8 where relevant. In both cases, the default factor for CaC2 use is applied. 
Tier 2 method 
As for the Tier 1 method, the Tier 2 method uses default emission factor values except for the amount of C 
contained in the product, where plant-level data are required. 
Tier 3 method 
The Tier 3 method requires plant-level data for all variables except for CCF and COF of the petroleum coke 
where country specific Energy Sector values may be used. This includes plant-level emission factors for lime if 
it is produced in-house and plant-level emission factors for CaC2 used to produce acetylene for welding 
applications.

CO2 from silicon carbide production 
More carbon is needed in the silicon carbide production process than calculated from a stoichiometric reaction. 
The excess carbon is oxidised during the process, little is left as ash (Raaness, 1991). Typical default values for 
Norwegian plants for carbon content in coke are 97 percent and for carbon contained in product, 35 percent. This 
implies a typical emission factor of 2.3 tonnes CO2/tonne petroleum coke used (IPCC, 1997), or 2.62 tonnes 
CO2/tonne carbide produced. 
CH4 from silicon carbide production 
Measurements at Norwegian plants suggest emission factors of 10.2 kg CH4/tonne petroleum coke or 11.6 kg 
CH4/tonne carbide produced (IPCC, 1997).

CO2 from calcium carbide production 
Emission factors may be derived from the use of raw materials (petroleum coke) and from carbide production 
using a mass-balance approach. Limestone used in carbide manufacture contains about 98 percent CaCO3 and is 
accounted for elsewhere. 1 750 kg limestone (or 950 kg CaO), 640 kg of petroleum coke and  20 kg carbon 
electrodes are required to produce 1 tonne of carbide. 
The default emission factors for estimating emissions are included in Table 3.8.

The theoretical emission factor calculated from a stoichiometric reaction is lower for the petroleum coke step 
than that shown in the table. Excess carbon is oxidised in the process and the suggested emission factors were 
calculated from the actual use of raw materials in a Norwegian plant. The emission factor for acetylene use is 
calculated from the actual (not stoichiometric) carbon content of carbide.  
The CO2 emissions may be lowered by utilising the gas when producing dicyanodiamide from carbide (Olsen, 
1991). 
3.6.2.3 
CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
Tier 1 method 
The Tier 1 method requires data on petroleum coke used in carbide production or national production of carbide. 
These data may be obtained from national statistics or from industrial and trade organizations representing 
carbide and petroleum coke producers.  
Tier 2 method 
Activity data required for the Tier 2 method comprise plant-level data on carbide produced and the amount of 
CaC2 used in the production of acetylene for welding applications. 
Chapter 3: Chemical Industry Emissions 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.45 
Tier 3 method 
The Tier 3 method requires plant-level activity data for all variables including the petroleum coke input and 
CaC2 used to produce acetylene for welding applications. 
The Tier 2 methods require the collection of activity data from individual plants or companies. In Tier 1 the 
activity data provided by national statistics or by industrial and trade organizations associated with carbide and 
petroleum coke production should be used. However, if sufficient plant-specific or company-specific data are 
available, they may be used to estimate emissions.  
3.6.2.4 
COMPLETENESS 
Carbide production plants are generally known in each country. As a result, carbide production data may be 
available in national statistical databases, or could be collected, even if these data have not been published in 
national statistics. The petroleum coke consumption data may be obtained directly from carbide production 
plants, or from coke producers and traders. Activity data and emissions estimation is complicated by the fact that 
acetylene produced from CaC2 is not necessarily produced at the same plant that produces the CaC2. This needs 
to be accounted for when using the higher tier methods, with emissions originating from the use of CaC2 
accounted at the point where the emissions occur; for example, in the case of acetylene used in welding 
applications, where the acetylene is produced at a different location to the CaC2 emissions should be accounted 
for at the point of production of the acetylene on the assumption that it will be used in a short time after 
production. 
Application of the Tier 2 and 3 methods assumes the bottom-up (plant by plant) estimation of emissions and 
plant-level data collection. In countries where only a subset of plants report data for the Tier 3 method or where 
there is a transition from Tier 2 to Tier 3, it may not be possible to report emissions using Tier 3 for all facilities 
during the transition.  Where data for the Tier 3 method are not available for all plants, Tier 2 could be used for 
the remaining plants. Also, where data for the Tier 2 method are reported by only a subset of plants or where 
there is a transition from Tier 1 to Tier 2, it may be possible to determine the share of production represented by 
non-reporting plants and use this information to estimate the remaining emissions using Tier 1 in order to ensure 
completeness during the transition period. 
3.6.2.5 
DEVELOPING A CONSISTENT TIME SERIES 
It is good practice to estimate emissions from carbide production using the same method for every year in the 
time series. Where data are unavailable to support a more rigorous method for all years in the time series, it is 
good practice is to recalculate these gaps according to the guidance provided in Volume 1, Chapter 5. 
3.6.3 
Uncertainty assessment 
3.6.3.1 
EMISSION FACTOR UNCERTAINTIES 
In general, the default CO2 emission factors are relatively uncertain because industrial-scale carbide production 
processes differ from the stoichiometry of theoretical chemical reactions. The uncertainty in the emission factors 
for CH4 is due to the possible variations in the hydrogen-containing volatile compounds in the raw material 
(petroleum coke) that are used by different manufacturers and due to the possible variations in production 
process parameters. Where uncertainty values are not available from other sources, a default value of ±10 
percent can be used. 
It is good practice to obtain uncertainty estimates at the plant level which should be lower than uncertainties 
associated with default values. 
3.6.3.2 
ACTIVITY DATA UNCERTAINTIES 
Where activity data are obtained directly from plants, uncertainty estimates can be obtained from producers. This 
will include uncertainty estimates for petroleum coke and limestone used and for carbide production data. Data 
that are obtained from national statistical agencies or from industrial and trade organizations usually do not 
include uncertainty estimates. It is good practice to consult with national statistical agencies to obtain 
information on any sampling errors. Where national statistic agencies collect carbide production data from 
production facilities, uncertainties in national statistics are not expected to differ from uncertainties estimated 
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
3.46 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
from plant-level consultations. Where uncertainty values are not available from other sources, a default value of 
±5 percent can be used. 
3.6.4 
Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC), 
Reporting and Documentation 
3.6.4.1 
QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL 
It is good practice to conduct quality control checks as outlined in Volume 1, Chapter 6, and an expert review of 
the emission estimates. More extensive quality control checks and quality assurance procedures may be 
applicable, particularly if higher tier methods are used to determine emissions from this source category. 
Inventory compilers are encouraged to use higher tier QA/QC for key categories as identified in Volume 1, 
Chapter 4. 
In addition to the guidance given in Volume 1, specific procedures of relevance to this source category are 
outlined below. 
Comparison of emission estimates using different approaches 
If the Tier 2 (plant-specific) method is used, then inventory compilers should compare the emission estimates to 
the estimates calculated using national level activity data (Tier 1). The inventory compilers are also encouraged 
to compare the emission estimates calculated using different modifications of the same methods. 
The results of such comparison should be recorded for internal documentation, including explanation for any 
discrepancies. 
Review of emission factors 
Inventory compilers should compare aggregated national emission factors with the IPCC default emission factors 
in order to determine if the national factor is reasonable relative to the IPCC default. The same procedure (i.e., 
comparison with the IPCC default) should be applied to plant specific emission factors. Differences between 
national or plant specific factors and default factors should be explained and documented, particularly if they are 
representative of different circumstances. 
Plant-specific data check 
For plant-specific data, inventory compilers should review inconsistencies between plants to establish whether 
they reflect errors, different measurement techniques, or result from real differences in raw materials, operational 
conditions or technology.  
Inventory compilers should ensure that activity data and emission factors are developed in accordance with 
internationally recognized and proven measurement methods. If any emission measurements from individual 
plants are collected inventory compilers should ensure that the measurements were made according to the 
recognised national or international standards. If the measurement practices fall this criterion, then the use of this 
emission factors and activity data should be carefully evaluated, uncertainty estimations reconsidered and 
qualifications documented.  
Expert review 
Inventory compilers are encouraged to include key industrial and trade organizations associated with carbide and 
petroleum coke production in a review process. This process should begin on the early stage of the inventory 
development to provide input to the development and review of methods and data acquisition.  
Third party reviews may be also useful for this source category, particularly in relation of initial data collection, 
transcription, calculation and documentation. 
3.6.4.2 
REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION 
It is good practice to document and archive all information required to produce the national emissions inventory 
estimates as outlined in Volume 1, Section 6.11. Recalculation of previous years emissions also should be 
documented and archived.

TITANIUM DIOXIDE PRODUCTION 
3.7.1 
Introduction 
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is one of the most commonly used white pigments. The main use is in paint 
manufacture followed by paper, plastics, rubber, ceramics, fabrics, floor covering, printing ink, and other 
miscellaneous uses (Austin, 1984; Lowenheim and Moran, 1975). Given production of around 4 million tonnes 
of TiO2, and the substantial use of the chloride route, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are likely to be significant 
and need to be accounted for in greenhouse gas inventories. Global production by the chloride route has increase 
approximately eight fold since 1970 whilst sulphate route production has been relatively stable (Kirk-Othmer, 
1999; p. 2017). Note that in the discussion, titanium dioxide products are referred to generically as titanium 
dioxide unless there is a need to make a distinction between the products. The discussion applies to titanium slag, 
synthetic rutile (>90 percent TiO2) and rutile TiO2. 
3.7.2 
Methodological issues 
TiO2 is produced as anatase TiO2 and rutile TiO2. The forms of TiO2 differ in terms of the crystalline structure 
and purity of the final product. Anatase TiO2 may be produced by digesting ilmenite (essentially ferrous titanate 
(FeO.TiO2)) with sulphuric acid, the sulphate process, or from titanium slag. Basic reaction equations for the 
acid digestion route are (Lowenheim and Moran, 1975; p. 814): 
FeTiO3 + 2H2SO4 → FeSO4 + TiO.SO4 + 2H2O 
TiO.SO4 + 2H2O → TiO2.H2O + H2SO4 
TiO2.H2O + heat → TiO2 + H2O 
The sulphate route process does not give rise to process greenhouse gas emissions that are of significance. 
There are three processes that are used in the production of TiO2 that lead to process greenhouse gas emissions: 
titanium slag production in electric furnaces, synthetic rutile production using the Becher process, and rutile 
TiO2 production via the chloride route. 
Titanium slag used for production of anatase TiO2 is produced from electric furnace smelting of ilmenite. Where 
titanium slag is used the acid reduction step is not required as the electric furnace smelting reduces the ferric iron 
contained as an impurity in ilmenite. Rutile TiO2 may be produced by further processing of the anatase TiO2. 
Process emissions arise from the reductant used in the process. 
Production of synthetic rutile can give rise to CO2 emissions where the Becher process is used. This process 
reduces the iron oxide in ilmenite to metallic iron and then reoxidises it to iron oxide, and in the process 
separates out the titanium dioxide as synthetic rutile of about 91 to 93 percent purity (Chemlink, 1997). Black 
coal is used as the reductant and the CO2 emissions arising should be treated as industrial process emissions. 
The main route for the production of rutile TiO2 is the chloride route. Rutile TiO2 is produced through the 
carbothermal chlorination of rutile ore or synthetic rutile to produce titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) and oxidation 
of the TiCl4 vapours to TiO2 according to the following reactions (Kirk-Othmer, 1999; p.2017): 
2TiO2 + 4Cl2 + 3C → 2TiCl4 + 2CO + CO2 
TiCl4 + O2 → TiO2 + 2Cl2 
Based on stoichiometry and assuming complete conversion of the input C to CO2 through further conversion of 
CO in excess air, the CO2 emission factor cannot be less than 0.826 tonnes of CO2 per tonne of TiO2 (based on 
1.5 moles of CO2 per mole of TiO2).  
3.7.2.1 
CHOICE OF METHOD 
The general approach for calculating CO2 emissions from titanium dioxide production is the same irrespective of 
the product because the emissions are based on the quantity of reducing agent or carbothermal input. The choice 
of a good practice method depends on national circumstances as shown in the decision tree in Figure 3.6. 
Process emissions of carbon dioxide in TiO2 production take place primarily as a result of anode carbon 
oxidisation in the production of titanium slag, coal oxidisation in the process of producing synthetic rutile using 
the Becher process, and petroleum coke oxidisation in the process of producing rutile TiO2 via the chloride route. 
Methods are classified according to the extent of plant-level data that are available.

TIER 1 METHOD 
The Tier 1 method uses a default emission factor per unit of output multiplied by activity data obtained from 
national statistics. The basic equation for estimating CO2 emissions is:

tonnes CO2/tonne product 
TIER 2 METHOD 
Emissions can be calculated from the consumption of the reducing agent for electrode carbon (titanium slag), 
and coal (synthetic rutile) in the Becher process, and the carbothermal input (petroleum coke) for rutile TiO2 
from the chloride rout process. The Tier 2 method uses plant-level data on the quantities of reducing agent and 
carbothermal input to derive emissions as follows:

COFi = carbon oxidation factor for reducing agent or carbothermal input i, fraction 
To achieve the highest accuracy, good practice is to apply Equation 3.13 at the plant-level with all data inputs 
obtained from plant operators. 
Where plant-level information is not available, good practice provides default CO2 emission factors for synthetic 
rutile and rutile TiO2 as shown in Table 3.9. A default factor for titanium slag is not available because of the 
small number of plants. 
 
BOX 3.6 
DOUBLE COUNTING 
In order to avoid double counting, the quantities of electrode carbon, coal used as a reductant, and 
petroleum coke used in the chloride route process, must be subtracted from the quantity reported 
under energy and non-energy use in the Energy Sector. 
3.7.2.2 
CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTORS 
TIER 1 METHOD 
If plant-level information is not available, it is good practice to use default factors. These default values often 
represent midpoint or mean values of data sets (as determined by expert analysis). The extent to which they 
represent a specific plant’s emission rate is unknown. Default factors by product are provided in Table 3.9, and 
should be used only in cases where plant-specific data are not available. The default factors are based on 
Chapter 3: Chemical Industry Emissions 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.49 
estimates of reductant or carbothermal input per unit of output assuming complete conversion of the C content to 
CO2. 
TIER 2 METHOD 
Plant-level data provides the most rigorous data for calculating CO2 emissions from titanium dioxide production. 
For the Tier 3 method, C content of the reductant and carbothermal inputs along with the proportion of C 
oxidised are the key emission factor variables for deriving the quantity of CO2 emitted.

3.7.2.3 
CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
It is good practice to compile activity data at a level of detail that allows the use of the Tier 2 method. When 
applying the methods it is essential that a clear distinction is made between the products to avoid multiplying the 
incorrect emission factor by activity data. 
TIER 1 METHOD 
The Tier 1 method requires data on national production of titanium slag, synthetic rutile and rutile TiO2. If 
national-level activity data are not available, information on production capacity can be used with emissions 
estimated using a default emission factor. It is good practice to multiply the total national production capacity by 
a capacity utilisation factor of 80 percent ± 10 percent (i.e., a range of 70-90 percent). 
TIER 2 METHOD 
The plant-level activity data required for the Tier 2 method are total reductant use, total carbon electrode 
consumption, and total carbothermal input. It is good practice to also collect data on total titanium slag 
production, total synthetic rutile production, and total rutile TiO2 production. Collection of production data 
enables comparisons of inputs per unit of outputs over time and provides a sound basis for ensuring time series 
consistency. Where plant-level emission factors are used, good practice is to collect plant-level production data. 
Typical plant-level activity data is assumed to be accurate to ±2 percent due to the economic value of having 
accurate information. If plant-level data are not available, nationally compiled production data may be used.  
3.7.2.4 
COMPLETENESS 
Complete coverage for titanium dioxide production requires accounting for all emissions from all sources 
including titanium slag, synthetic rutile and rutile TiO2. CO2 emissions are the main process emissions. In order 
to include emissions of NOx, CO and SO2 from this source category, see guidance provided in Chapter 7 of 
Volume 1: General Guidance and Reporting.  
3.7.2.5 
DEVELOPING A CONSISTENT TIME SERIES 
CO2 emissions should be recalculated for all years whenever emission calculation methods are changed (e.g., if 
the inventory compiler changes from the use of default values to actual values determined at the plant level). If 
plant-specific data are not available, including plant-specific production data, for all years in the time series, it 
will be necessary to consider how current plant data can be used to recalculate emissions for previous years. It 
may be possible to apply current plant-specific emission factors to production data from previous years, provided 
that plant operations have not changed substantially. Recalculation is required to ensure that any changes in 
emissions trends are real and not an artefact of changes in procedure. It is good practice to recalculate the time 
series according to the guidance provided in Volume 1, Chapter 5. 
3.7.3 
Uncertainty assessment 
3.7.3.1 
EMISSION FACTOR UNCERTAINTIES 
Uncertainties for the default values are estimates based on expert judgement. It is good practice to obtain 
uncertainty estimates at the plant level which should be lower than uncertainty values associated with default 
values. 
3.7.3.2 
ACTIVITY DATA UNCERTAINTIES 
Where activity data are obtained from plants, uncertainty estimates can be obtained from producers. This will 
include uncertainty estimates for reductant use, carbothermal inputs, and production data. Data that are obtained 
from national statistical agencies usually do not include uncertainty estimates. It is good practice to consult with 
national statistical agencies to obtain information on any sampling errors. Where national statistical agencies 
collect data from the population of titanium dioxide production facilities, uncertainties in national statistics are 
not expected to differ from uncertainties established from plant-level consultations. Where uncertainty values are 
not available from other sources, a default value of ±5 percent can be used.

3.7.4 
Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC), 
Reporting and Documentation 
3.7.4.1 
QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL 
It is good practice to conduct quality control checks as outlined in Volume 1, Chapter 6. More extensive quality 
control checks and quality assurance procedures are applicable, if higher tier methods are used to determine 
emissions. Inventory compilers are encouraged to use higher tier QA/QC for key categories as identified in 
Volume 1, Chapter 4. 
Comparison of emission factors 
Inventory compilers should check if the estimated emission factors are within the range of default emission 
factors provided for the Tier 1 method, and also ensure that the emission factors are consistent with the values 
derived from analysis of the process chemistry. For example, the CO2 generation rate for rutile TiO2 from the 
chloride route process should not be less than 0.826 tonnes of CO2 per tonne of rutile TiO2 produced. If the 
emission factors are outside of the estimated ranges, it is good practice to assess and document the plant-specific 
conditions that account for the differences. 
If emission measurements from individual plants are collected, inventory compilers should ensure that the 
measurements were made according to recognised national or international standards. QC procedures in use at 
the site should be directly referenced and included in the QC plan. If the measurement practices were not 
consistent with QC standards, the inventory compiler should reconsider the use of these data. 
3.7.4.2 
REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION 
It is good practice to document and archive all information required to produce the national emissions inventory 
estimates as outlined in Volume 1, Section 6.11. It is not practical to include all documentation in the national 
inventory report. However, the inventory should include summaries of methods used and references to source 
data such that the reported emissions estimates are transparent and steps in their calculation may be retraced.  
Plant-specific data check 
The following plant-specific data is required for adequate auditing of emissions estimates: 
• 
Activity data comprising electrode carbon consumption (titanium slag), coal reductant use (synthetic rutile), 
carbothermal input (rutile TiO2), titanium slag production, synthetic rutile production, and rutile TiO2 
production; 
• 
Emission factor data including the carbon content of the reductant (carbon electrode and coal) and 
carbothermal input (petroleum coke), and the proportion oxidised in the process; 
• 
Calculations and estimation method;  
• 
List of assumptions;  
• 
Documentation of any plant-specific measurement method, and measurement results.  
In general production and process data are considered proprietary by operators, especially where there are only a 
small number of plants within a country. It is good practice to apply appropriate techniques, including 
aggregation of data, to ensure protection of confidential data.

SODA ASH PRODUCTION 
3.8.1 
Introduction 
Soda ash (sodium carbonate, Na2CO3) is a white crystalline solid that is used as a raw material in a large number 
of industries including glass manufacture, soap and detergents, pulp and paper production and water treatment. 
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is emitted from the use of soda ash and these emissions are accounted for as a source 
under the relevant using industry as discussed in Volume 3, Chapter 2. CO2 is also emitted during production 
with the quantity emitted dependent on the industrial process used to manufacture soda ash. 
Emissions of CO2 from the production of soda ash vary substantially with the manufacturing process. Four 
different processes may be used commercially to produce soda ash. Three of these processes, monohydrate, 
sodium sesquicarbonate (trona) and direct carbonation, are referred to as natural processes. The fourth, the 
Solvay process, is classified as a synthetic process. Calcium carbonate (limestone) is used as a source of CO2 in 
the Solvay process. Other uses of limestone and other carbonates are discussed in Volume 3, Chapter 2. 
3.8.2 
Natural soda ash production 
About 25 percent of the world production is produced from natural sodium carbonate-bearing deposits referred 
to as natural processes. During the production process, Trona (the principal ore from which natural soda ash is 
made) is calcined in a rotary kiln and chemically transformed into a crude soda ash. Carbon dioxide and water 
are generated as by-products of this process. Carbon dioxide emissions can be estimated based on the following 
chemical reaction: 
2Na2CO3.NaHCO3.2H2O (Trona) → 3Na2CO3 (Soda Ash) + 5H2O + CO2 
 
3.8.2.1 
METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES 
CHOICE OF METHOD 
The choice of method will depend on national circumstances. Emissions can be estimated using an output-based 
approach (emissions per unit of output), or an input-based approach (emissions per unit of input). However, it is 
good practice to use the input-based method where data are available.  
Methods are classified according to the extent of plant-level data that are available. The Tier 1 method is based 
on default values and national statistics, and the Tier 2 method is based on complete plant-level input or output 
data and plant specific emission factors. If there is monitoring and direct measurement of CO2 emissions this 
would be equivalent to a Tier 3 method. 
Tier 1 method 
Natural soda ash production emits CO2 through the thermal decomposition (calcination) of the Trona 
(Na2CO3.NaHCO3.2H2O) to produce soda ash. According to the chemical reaction presented above, it takes 
10.27 tonnes of Trona to produce 1 tonne of carbon dioxide. Hence, for natural soda ash production using Trona, 
emissions of carbon dioxide can be calculated from the Trona input or natural soda ash output by the following 
formula:  
EQUATION 3.14 
CO2 EMISSIONS FROM NATURAL SODA ASH PRODUCTION – TIER 1 
EF
AD
ECO
•
2 =
 
Where: 
ECO2 = emissions of CO2, tonnes 
AD = quantity of Trona used or soda ash produced, tonnes of Trona used or tonnes natural soda ash 
produced 
EF = emission factor per unit of Trona input or natural soda ash output, tonnes CO2/tonne of Trona or 
tonnes CO2/tonne natural soda ash produced: EFTrona = 0.097 tonnes CO2/tonne of Trona, EFSoda Ash = 
0.138 tonnes CO2/tonnes natural soda ash produced. 
Chapter 3: Chemical Industry Emissions 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.53 
It is good practice to assess the available national statistics for completeness. The choice of good practice 
methods depends on national circumstances, as shown in Figure 3.7: Decision Tree for Estimation of CO2 
Emissions from Natural Soda Ash Production. If no data are available for the purity of the Trona input, it is good 
practice to assume it is 90 percent and adjust the emission factor shown in Equation 3.14. 
Tier 2 method 
To use the Tier 2 method, it is necessary to gather complete data on Trona consumption or natural soda ash 
production for each of the plants within the country along with plant-specific emission factors for the Trona 
input or soda ash output. The CO2 emissions for each plant can be calculated using either variation of Equation 
3.14. For plants where plant-specific emission factors are not available, the default emission factors provided in 
Equation 3.14 can be used. Total CO2 emissions are the sum of the emissions from all plants. 
Tier 3 method 
The Tier 3 method uses plant-level CO2 emissions data obtained from direct measurement. Total emissions are 
the sum of emissions from all plants.

Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
3.54 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTORS 
Tier 1 method 
The Tier method uses the default emission factors presented in Equation 3.14. The default emission factors are 
derived from the stoichiometric ratio between soda ash produced and purified sodium sesquicarbonate obtained 
from Trona. They are based on the main natural production process that is used at present, where soda ash is 
produced by calcination of purified sodium sesquicarbonate. 
Tier 2 method 
The Tier 2 method requires plant-level emission factors per unit of Trona input or per unit of natural soda ash 
output. Plant-level emission factors should reflect the fractional purities of the Trona input and natural soda ash 
output and it is good practice to ensure that these are taken into account in the derivation of plant-level emission 
factors.  
CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
It is good practice to compile activity data at a level of detail that allows the use of the Tier 2 method. When 
applying the methods it is essential that a clear distinction is made between the products to avoid multiplying the 
incorrect emission factor by activity data. 
Tier 1 method 
The Tier 1 method requires data on national consumption of Trona or national production of natural soda ash. If 
national-level activity data are not available, information on production capacity can be used with emissions 
estimated using a default emission factor. It is good practice to multiply the total national production capacity by 
a capacity utilisation factor of 80 percent ± 10 percent (i.e., a range of 70-90 percent). 
Tier 2 method 
Activity data should be collected at the plant-level to use the Tier 2 method. The most important data are the 
amount of Trona used for soda ash production and the amount of natural soda ash produced at each plant. 
Although soda ash production is not used in the calculation if emissions are derived from Trona input, it is good 
practice to collect and report these data to enable comparisons of inputs per unit of outputs over time and 
provide a sound basis for ensuring time series consistency.  
COMPLETENESS 
Completeness of the activity data (e.g., Trona utilisation) is a crucial attribute of good practice. Therefore, it is 
good practice to assess the available national statistics for completeness.  If data are available at the plant-level, 
it is good practice to aggregate these data and check the result with the data available at a national level. This 
practice enables assessment of whether any significant soda ash producer is omitted, and ensures that all 
production processes within the country have been considered. If data at the plant-level are not available, it is 
good practice to use production capacity data along with national statistics to estimate the emissions for 
completeness purposes. 
DEVELOPING A CONSISTENT TIME SERIES 
It is good practice to calculate emissions from soda ash using the same method for every year in the time series. 
Where data are unavailable to support a more rigorous method for all years in the time series, good practice is to 
recalculate these gaps according to the guidance provided in Volume 1, Chapter 5. 
3.8.2.2 
UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT 
EMISSION FACTOR UNCERTAINTIES 
The stoichiometric ratio is an exact number and assuming 100 percent purity of the input or output, the 
uncertainty of the default emission factor is negligible. However, the default factors do not take into account the 
fractional purities of either the Trona input or soda ash output and, in both cases, are expected to result in 
consistent over-estimation of emissions. As noted earlier, if no data are available for the purity of the Trona input, 
it is good practice to assume it is 90 percent and adjust the emission factor shown in Equation 3.14. It is good 
practice to develop uncertainty estimates based on plant-level data. 
ACTIVITY DATA UNCERTAINTIES 
Where activity data are obtained from plants, uncertainty estimates can be obtained from producers. This will 
include uncertainty estimates for Trona used and natural soda ash used. Data that are obtained from national 
statistical agencies usually do not include uncertainty estimates. It is good practice to consult with national 
statistical agencies to obtain information on any sampling errors. Where national statistical agencies collect data 
Chapter 3: Chemical Industry Emissions 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.55 
from the population of soda ash production facilities, uncertainties in national statistics are not expected to differ 
from uncertainties established from plant-level consultations. Where uncertainty values are not available from 
other sources, a default value of ±5 percent can be used. 
3.8.2.3 
QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL (QA/QC), 
REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION 
QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL 
It is good practice to conduct quality control checks as outlined in Volume 1, Chapter 6, and an expert review of 
the emissions estimates. Additional quality control checks as outlined in Volume 1, and quality assurance 
procedures may also be applicable, particularly if higher tier methods are used to determine emissions from this 
source category. Inventory compilers are encouraged to use higher tier QA/QC for key categories as identified in 
Volume 1, Chapter 4. 
Comparison of the emissions estimates using different approaches  
If the bottom-up approach is used, then inventory compilers should compare the emissions estimates to the 
estimate calculated using the top-down approach. The results of such comparisons should be recorded for 
internal documentation, including explanations for any discrepancies.  
REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION 
It is good practice to document and archive all information required to produce the national emissions inventory 
estimates as outlined in Volume1, Section 6.11. It is not practical to include all documentation in the national 
inventory report. However, the inventory should include summaries of methods used and references to data 
sources, and all the information needed to reproduce the estimate.  
Besides the emissions, good practice is to report the activity data used in the calculation (Trona utilisation) and 
the corresponding emission factors along with all assumptions used in the derivation. 
To preserve an internally consistent emission time series, whenever national methods change, good practice is to 
recalculate the entire time series. If confidentiality is an issue for any type of production, estimates may be 
aggregated to the minimum extent possible to maintain confidentiality.  
In addition, inventory compilers should document the QA/QC procedures. 
3.8.3 
Solvay soda ash production 
About 75 percent of the world production of soda ash is synthetic ash made from sodium chloride. In the Solvay 
process, sodium chloride brine, limestone, metallurgical coke and ammonia are the raw materials used in a series 
of reactions leading to the production of soda ash. Ammonia, however, is recycled and only a small amount is 
lost. The series of reactions involved in the Solvay process may be described as follows: 
CaCO3 + heat → CaO + CO2  
CaO + H2O → Ca(OH)2 
2NaCl + 2H2O + 2NH3 + 2CO2 → 2NaHCO3 + 2NH4Cl 
2NaHCO3 + heat → Na2CO3  + CO2 + H2O 
Ca(OH)2  + 2NH4Cl → CaCl2 + 2NH3 + 2H2O 
The net overall reaction may be summarised as: 
CaCO3 + 2NaCl → Na2CO3 + CaCl2  
From the series of reactions presented above, CO2 is generated in two pyrolysis processes. The CO2 generated is 
captured, compressed and directed to Solvay precipitating towers for consumption in a mixture of brine (aqueous 
NaCl) and ammonia. Although CO2 is generated as a by-product, the CO2 is recovered and recycled for use in 
the carbonation stage and in theory the process is neutral, i.e., CO2 generation equals uptake. 
In practice, some CO2 is emitted to the atmosphere during production by the Solvay process because more CO2 is 
produced than is stoichiometrically required. The excess CO2 arises from calcining the limestone with 
metallurgical grade coke. The limestone is combined with the coke at approximately 7 percent of limestone by 
weight.  
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
3.56 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
The estimation of the CO2 emissions from a stand alone soda ash plant should be based on an overall balance of 
CO2 around the whole chemical process. For inventory purposes, a simplified version of the balance may be used 
assuming that the CO2 emissions result from the stoichiometric oxidation of the coke carbon. The Solvay 
ammonia soda ash production process is a chemical industry activity and emissions should be reported under the 
Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU) Sector. 
 
BOX 3.7 
DOUBLE COUNTING 
In order to avoid double counting, CO2 emissions generated in the process of  soda ash production 
should be accounted in the IPPU Sector, and should not be included in the Energy Sector. Coke 
used in the production process should be deducted from the Energy Sector as a non-energy use of 
coke. 
3.8.3.1 
QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL (QA/QC), 
REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION 
The allocation of emissions from the use of metallurgical grade coke in the Solvay process to the Energy Sector 
means that a methodology for estimating these emissions is not provided in the Industrial Processes and 
Product Use Sector. However, data on soda ash production from the Solvay process should be collected and 
collated to ensure that all data on soda ash production by process are available for recording, reporting, archiving 
and reconciliation with national statistics on soda ash use.  
QUALITY ASSURANCE/ QUALITY CONTROL 
It is good practice to conduct quality control checks as outlined in Volume 1, Chapter 6. Additional quality 
control checks as outlined in Volume 1, and quality assurance procedures may also be applicable. Inventory 
compilers are encouraged to use higher tier QA/QC for key categories as identified in Volume 1, Chapter 4. 
REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION 
It is good practice to document and archive all information required to produce the national emissions inventory 
estimates as outlined in Volume1, Section 6.11. It is not practical to include all documentation in the national 
inventory report. However, the inventory should include summaries of methods used and references to data 
sources, and all the information needed to reproduce the estimate.

PETROCHEMICAL AND CARBON BLACK 
PRODUCTION 
3.9.1 
Introduction 
The petrochemical industry uses fossil fuels (e.g., natural gas) or petroleum refinery products (e.g., naphtha) as 
feedstocks. This section provides guidance for estimating emissions from the production of methanol, ethylene 
and propylene2, ethylene dichloride, ethylene oxide, and acrylonitrile. These petrochemicals are addressed in 
detail because their global production volume and associated greenhouse gas emissions are relatively large. 
However, the chemicals included are not intended to represent the entire petrochemical process industry. There 
are a number of other petrochemical processes that emit small amounts of greenhouse gases for which specific 
guidance is not provided (e.g., styrene production).  
This section also provides guidance for production of carbon black. Carbon black is not considered to be a 
petrochemical; however, the carbon black production process uses petrochemical feedstocks. Emissions from 
carbon black production are smaller than for petrochemical processes but may be significant for certain countries.  
Examples of feedstock to product production chains for methanol, ethylene and propylene, ethylene dichloride, 
ethylene oxide, acrylonitrile, and carbon black are included in the Annex to Section 3.9.  
Allocation and Reporting  
Within the petrochemical industry and carbon black industry, primary fossil fuels (natural gas, petroleum, coal) 
are used for non-fuel purposes in the production of petrochemicals and carbon black. The use of these primary 
fossil fuels may involve combustion of part of the hydrocarbon content for heat raising and the production of 
secondary fuels (e.g., off gases).  
Combustion emissions from fuels obtained from the feedstocks should be allocated to the source category in the 
IPPU Sector. However, where the fuels are not used within the source category but are transferred out of the 
process for combustion elsewhere (e.g., for district heating purposes) the emissions should be reported in the 
appropriate Energy Sector source category.  The industries are included in the source category Chemical 
Industry (2B1 – 2B10), see Figure 1.1, Industrial Process and Product Use Source Categories in Chapter 1 of this 
volume. Further discussion of the non-energy use of fuels is included in Chapters 1 and 5 of this volume.   
Note that national energy statistics may include total combustion of fossil fuels (including natural gas, oil, and 
coal,) and also secondary fuels (such as industrial process off gases) for energy production. It is important to 
investigate if fuels used in petrochemical industries are included in national energy statistics. If this is the case, 
emissions from petrochemical processes should be subtracted from the calculated energy sector emissions to 
avoid double counting. This is particularly relevant for ethylene and methanol, where primary fuel (e.g., natural 
gas, ethane, propane) feedstock consumption may be reported in national energy statistics. 
Should carbon dioxide (CO2) capture technology be installed and used at a plant, it is good practice to deduct the 
CO2 captured in a higher tier emissions calculation. The default assumption is that there is no CO2 capture and 
storage (CCS) taking place. Any methodology taking into account CO2 capture should consider that CO2 
emissions captured in the process may be both combustion and process-related. In cases where combustion and 
process emissions are to be reported separately, inventory compilers should ensure that the same quantities of 
CO2 are not double counted. In these cases the total amount of CO2 captured should preferably be reported in the 
corresponding energy combustion and IPPU source categories in proportion to the amounts of CO2 generated in 
these source categories. For additional information on CO2 capture and storage refer to Volume 3, Section 1.2.2 
and for more details on capture and storage to Volume 2, Section 2.3.4. 
Petrochemical processes may utilise CO2 captured elsewhere as a feedstock, and CO2 may also be captured from 
petrochemical processes. This may create potential double counting issues. For example, some methanol plants 
may utilise by-product CO2 captured from other industrial processes as a feedstock for methanol production. To 
avoid double counting the CO2 captured should not be reported as CO2 emissions from the process from which 
the CO2 is captured.

production.

METHANOL 
Worldwide almost all methanol is made by way of steam reforming of natural gas. The steam reforming and shift 
reaction produce ‘synthesis gas’ comprised of CO2, carbon monoxide (CO), and hydrogen (H2). The natural gas 
to methanol production process produces methanol and by-product CO2, CO, and H2 from the synthesis gas.  
There are several alternative processes for producing methanol from natural gas or other feedstocks. These 
include conventional reforming process, combined reforming and partial oxidation process. An example of a 
feedstock to product process flow diagram for methanol production is provided in an Annex to Section 3.9 
(Annex 3.9A). Process descriptions for methanol production are included in Box 3.8 below. 
BOX 3.8 
METHANOL PROCESS DESCRIPTIONS 
Conventional Reforming Process 
The Conventional Reforming Process for methanol production involves steam reforming (which 
may include either a single reformer unit or both a primary reformer unit and a secondary reformer 
unit) and methanol synthesis. The overall equations for the Conventional Reforming Process are: 
 
 
The surplus hydrogen from this process and methanol process purge gas containing methane (CH4) 
and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) are recovered and burned for energy 
recovery, generally within the methanol production process, to produce process steam and/or 
electricity for the process. The Conventional Reforming Process may utilise CO2 captured from 
other industrial processes as a supplemental feedstock to the methanol production process. 
Combined Reforming Process 
The Combined Reforming Process combines the Conventional Steam Reforming process with a 
Catalytic Partial Oxidation process. The Partial Oxidation chemical equations are: 
 
The Combined Reforming Process produces a synthesis gas that contains a more balanced ratio of 
hydrogen to carbon monoxide (CO) and CO2 than does the Conventional Reforming Process, and 
does not produce a hydrogen gas stream for energy recovery. The Combined Reforming Process 
produces a purge gas containing CH4 that is burned for energy recovery within the methanol 
process.  
Other Production Processes 
Methanol may also be produced from the partial oxidation of oil, coal, or petrochemical 
feedstocks, or by gasification of coal to synthesis gas, however; these feedstocks and processes 
currently represent only a small amount of worldwide methanol production. 
 
ETHYLENE 
Worldwide almost all ethylene is made by way of steam cracking of petrochemical feedstocks. Ethylene may be 
produced from steam cracking of petrochemical feedstocks in a petrochemical plant, and may also be produced 
from cracking and other processes operated at petroleum refineries. Steam cracking for ethylene production also 
produces secondary products including propylene and butadiene. A process description for steam cracking 
process for ethylene production is provided in Box 3.9 below.

ETHYLENE PROCESS DESCRIPTION 
Steam Cracking 
The fundamental chemical equation for ethylene production is as follows: 
 
The types and mix of feedstock used in steam cracking for ethylene production varies by region, 
and include ethane, propane, butane, naphtha, gas oil, and other petrochemical feedstocks. In the 
United States, most ethylene is produced from steam cracking of ethane, while in Europe, Korea, 
and Japan most ethylene is produced from steam cracking of naphtha.  
Steam cracking of petrochemical feedstocks to produce ethylene also produces other high value 
(saleable) petrochemical products, including propylene, butadiene, and aromatic compounds. Most 
propylene worldwide is produced as a by-product of ethylene production, recovered either from 
steam crackers or from fluid catalytic cracking units at petroleum refineries. Steam crackers using 
naphtha feedstock are the largest source of propylene. There are other process technologies that are 
used to produce propylene including catalytic dehydrogenation of propane. Note that the emissions 
estimation methods in this section apply only to production of ethylene and propylene in steam 
crackers and do not apply to other process technologies used to produce ethylene or propylene.  
The steam cracking process also produces by-product hydrogen and methane and C4+ 
hydrocarbons that are generally burned for energy recovery within the process. 
(Houdek, 2005: Figure 1 on Page 3, Page 4) 
 
ETHYLENE DICHLORIDE AND VINYL CHLORIDE MONOMER  
Worldwide almost all ethylene dichloride (1, 2 dichloroethane) is made by way of direct chlorination or 
oxychlorination of ethylene, or by a combination of the two processes (referred to as the ‘balanced process.’) An 
example of a feedstock to product process flow diagram for ethylene dichloride production is provided in an 
Annex to Section 3.9 (Annex 3.9A). Process descriptions for ethylene dichloride and vinyl chloride monomer 
production are provided in Box 3.10 below. Note that the chemical compound ‘ethylene dichloride’ is also 
referred to as 1,2-dichloroethane. The chemical compound ‘dichloroethylene,’ also referred to as 1, 2-
dichloroethene, is a different compound. 
BOX 3.10 
ETHYLENE DICHLORIDE AND VINYL CHLORIDE MONOMER PROCESS DESCRIPTIONS 
Direct Chlorination and Oxychlorination Processes 
The direct chlorination process involves gas-phase reaction of ethylene with chlorine to produce 
ethylene dichloride. The oxychlorination process involves gas-phase reaction of ethylene with 
hydrochloric acid and oxygen to produce ethylene dichloride and water. The ethylene dichloride is 
then cracked to produce vinyl chloride monomer and hydrochloric acid. The oxychlorination 
process produces a process off gas containing by-product CO2 produced from the direct oxidation 
of the ethylene feedstock. 
The fundamental chemical equations for the direct chlorination and oxychlorination processes are 
as follows: 
 
 
Direct chlorination  
C2H4 + Cl2 → C2H4Cl2 
 
Oxychlorination reaction 
C2H4 + ½ O2 + 2 HCl

ETHYLENE DICHLORIDE AND VINYL CHLORIDE MONOMER PROCESS DESCRIPTIONS 
Balanced Process 
The combination of the direct chlorination process to produce ethylene dichloride and the ethylene 
dichloride cracking process to produce vinyl chloride monomer produces a surplus of hydrogen 
chloride. The oxychlorination process provides a sink for the hydrogen chloride. Therefore, 
ethylene dichloride/vinyl chloride monomer production facilities may operate a ‘balanced process’ 
in which both the direct chlorination process and the oxychlorination process are combined. The 
‘balanced process’ also produces process vent gas containing by-product CO2 from the direct 
oxidation of the ethylene feedstock. 
The fundamental chemical equations for the ‘balanced process’ for producing vinyl chloride 
monomer from ethylene are as follows: 
 
The direct chlorination process and the oxychlorination process for ethylene dichloride production 
are not 100 percent efficient in the utilisation of the ethylene feedstock. On the order of three 
percent of the ethylene feedstock is not converted to ethylene dichloride but is converted either to 
CO2 (by direct oxidation in the oxychlorination process) or to other chlorinated hydrocarbons (in 
either the oxychlorination process or the direct chlorination process.) Process off gas containing 
other chlorinated hydrocarbons is generally treated prior to discharge to the atmosphere. The 
chlorinated hydrocarbons are converted to CO2 in a thermal incineration process or a catalytic 
incineration process. Most ethylene dichloride/vinyl chloride monomer plants recover energy from 
the incinerator off gases and process off gases. 
 
ETHYLENE OXIDE 
Ethylene oxide (C2H4O) is manufactured by reacting ethylene with oxygen over a catalyst. The by-product CO2 
from the direct oxidation of the ethylene feedstock is removed from the process vent stream using a recycled 
carbonate solution, and the recovered CO2 may be vented to the atmosphere or recovered for further utilisation 
(e.g., food production.) The oxygen may be supplied to the process through either air or through pure oxygen 
separated from air. An example of a feedstock to product process flow diagram for ethylene oxide production is 
provided in an Annex to Section 3.9 (Annex 3.9A). A process description for ethylene oxide production is 
provided in Box 3.11 below. 
BOX 3.11 
ETHYLENE OXIDE PROCESS DESCRIPTION 
The fundamental chemical equations for the production of ethylene oxide from ethylene and the 
production of monoethylene glycol are as follows: 
 
The ratio of the ethylene oxide reaction and the by-product reaction defines the selectivity of the 
ethylene oxide process, in terms of tonnes of ethylene consumed per tonne of ethylene oxide 
produced. The combined ethylene oxide reaction and by-product CO2 reaction is exothermic and 
generates heat, which is recovered to produce steam for the process. The ethylene oxide process 
also produces other liquid and off-gas by-products (e.g., ethane) that may be burned for energy 
recovery within the process. The amount of CO2 and other by-products produced from the process 
and the amount of steam produced from the process is dependent upon the selectivity of the 
process.   
Ethylene oxide is used as a feedstock in the manufacture of glycols, glycol ethers, alcohols, and 
amines. Worldwide approximately 70 percent of ethylene oxide produced is used in the 
manufacture of glycols, including monoethylene glycol.

ACRYLONTRILE 
Worldwide more than 90 percent of acrylonitrile (vinyl cyanide) is made by way of direct ammoxidation of 
propylene with ammonia (NH3) and oxygen over a catalyst.  This process is referred to as the SOHIO process, 
after the Standard Oil Company of Ohio (SOHIO). Acrylonitrile can also be manufactured by ammoxidation of 
propane or directly from reaction of propane with hydrogen peroxide.  The propane-peroxide direct process has 
recently been commercialised by British Petroleum (BP) and other manufacturers. (DOE, 2000) However, 
process data were not readily available for production of acrylonitrile from propane feedstocks.  Therefore no 
emission estimation methodology is provided for this process.  An example of a feedstock to product process 
flow diagram for acrylonitrile production from propylene is provided in an Annex to Section 3.9 (Annex 3.9A). 
Process descriptions for acrylonitrile production are provided in Box 3.12 below. 
BOX 3.12 
ACRYLONITRILE PROCESS DESCRIPTION 
SOHIO Process 
The SOHIO process involves a fluidized bed reaction of chemical-grade propylene, ammonia, and 
oxygen over a catalyst. The catalyst is a mixture of heavy metal oxides (including bismuth and 
molybdenum). The process produces acrylonitrile as its primary product and acetonitrile (methyl 
cyanide) and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) as secondary products. The process yield of the primary 
product acrylonitrile depends in part on the type of catalyst used and the process configuration.  
The ammoxidation process also produces by-product CO2, CO, and water from the direct oxidation 
of the propylene feedstock, and produces other hydrocarbons from side reactions in the 
ammoxidation process.  
The acetonitrile and hydrogen cyanide are separated from the acrylonitrile by absorption, and the 
hydrogen cyanide may be used in manufacturing other products on site or sold as product.  
Hydrogen cyanide that is not used or sold may be burned for energy recovery or flared. The 
acetonitrile may be also recovered for sale as a product, but more often the acetonitrile is burned 
for energy recovery or flared. The off gas from the main absorber vent containing CO2, CO, 
nitrogen, water, unreacted propylene, and other hydrocarbons, may be flared or treated in a thermal 
or catalytic oxidation unit, with or without energy recovery.  
Heavy bottoms liquids from the acetonitrile – hydrogen cyanide - acrylonitrile absorption 
separations process may also be burned for energy recovery or recycled. Acrylonitrile and other 
non-methane hydrocarbons are also released from miscellaneous process vents, including storage 
tanks. These miscellaneous process vents may be flared or captured and burned for energy 
recovery.  
The fundamental chemical equations for the production of acrylonitrile by ammoxidation are as 
follows: 
 
The ammoxidation of propylene to acrylonitrile is not 100 percent efficient in utilisation of the 
propylene feedstock. On the order of 70 percent of the propylene feedstock is converted to 
acrylonitrile. On the order of 85 percent of the propylene feedstock is converted to either the 
primary product acrylonitrile or secondary products acetonitrile or hydrogen cyanide. The 
remainder of the propylene feedstock is either converted directly to CO2 by direct oxidation of the 
feedstock in the ammoxidation process or converted to other hydrocarbons through side reactions 
in the ammoxidation process. 
 
CARBON BLACK 
Worldwide almost all carbon black is produced from petroleum-based or coal-based feedstocks using the 
‘furnace black’ process.  Process descriptions for carbon black production are provided in Box 3.13 below.

C3H6 + 3 O2 → 3 CO + 3 H2O 
 
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
3.62 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
The furnace black process is a partial combustion process where a portion of the carbon black feedstock is 
combusted to provide energy to the process. Carbon black may also be produced using other petroleum-
feedstock or coal-based feedstock partial oxidation processes, including the ‘channel black’ process and ‘lamp 
black’ process, or may be produced directly by the partial oxidation of natural gas or aromatic oils (‘channel 
black process’). Carbon black may also be produced by the thermal cracking of acetylene-containing feedstocks 
(‘acetylene black process’) or by the thermal cracking of other hydrocarbons (‘thermal black process’.)  
Approximately 95 percent of worldwide carbon black production is by way of the furnace black process; the 
remaining 5 percent being produced by way of other processes.  
Approximately 90 percent of carbon black produced worldwide is used in the tire and rubber industry (referred 
to as ‘rubber black.’) and the remainder is used in pigment applications (e.g., inks) and other applications (e.g., 
carbon dry cell batteries.) Carbon black may be produced using a furnace black process, thermal black process, 
acetylene carbon black process, channel black process and lamp black process. These processes are further 
described in Box 3.13 below.  An example of a feedstock to product process flow diagram for carbon black 
production using the furnace black process is provided in an Annex to Section 3.9 (Annex 3.9A). 
BOX 3.13 
CARBON BLACK PRODUCTION PROCESS DESCRIPTIONS 
Furnace Black Process 
The furnace black process produces carbon black from ‘carbon black feedstock’ (also referred to 
as ‘carbon black oil’) which is a heavy aromatic oil that may be derived either as a by-product of 
the petroleum refining process or the metallurgical (coal) coke production process. For either 
petroleum-derived or coal-derived feedstock, the carbon black feedstock, the ‘primary feedstock,’ 
is injected into a furnace heated by a ‘secondary feedstock’ (generally natural gas or oil). Both the 
natural gas secondary feedstock and a portion of the carbon black feedstock are oxidized to 
provide heat to the production process that pyrolyzes the remaining carbon black feedstock to 
carbon black. The vent gas from the furnace black process contains CO2, CO, sulphur compounds, 
CH4, and NMVOCs. A portion of the tail gas is generally burned for energy recovery to heat the 
downstream carbon black product dryers. The remaining tail gas may also be burned for energy 
recovery, flared, or vented uncontrolled to the atmosphere.   
Thermal Black Process 
Carbon black is produced in the thermal black process by thermal decomposition of gaseous 
hydrocarbons or atomized petroleum oils in the absence of air in a pair of production furnaces.  
The carbon black feedstock is introduced into a preheated furnace that is heated by a secondary 
feedstock, usually natural gas, and by the off gas from the carbon black production process. One of 
the pair of furnaces is being preheated by the secondary feedstock while the other furnace is 
receiving carbon black feedstock.  Yield from this process is approximately 45 percent of total 
carbon input to the process (or 40 percent with respect to the total carbon black feedstock used) 
and energy utilisation is approximately 280 MJ/kg carbon black produced.  
Acetylene Black Process  
Carbon black produced from acetylene or acetylene-containing light hydrocarbons by feeding the 
feedstock to a preheated reactor where the acetylene decomposes to carbon black in an exothermic 
process. Total worldwide production of acetylene black is only approximately 40 000 metric tons 
per year. The carbon black yield from this process is approximately 95-99 percent of theoretical 
yield.  Acetylene black is approximately 99.7 percent carbon.  
Other Production Processes  
The channel black process involves partial oxidation of vaporised carbon black feedstock that is 
burned in a furnace with a carrier gas (which may be coke oven gas, hydrogen, or methane). The 
carbon black yield for this process may be 60 percent of total carbon input for production of 
rubber-grade carbon black or 10-30 percent of total carbon input for pigment-grade carbon black.   
The lamp black process involves open burning of carbon black feedstock in shallow pans. Data are 
not readily available concerning feedstock yield and energy consumption for the lamp black 
process. This process represents an insignificant percentage of worldwide carbon black production.

The Tier 3 methodology can be used to estimate plant-level CO2 emissions and CH4 emissions. The Tier 3 
method depends upon the availability of plant-specific data for the petrochemical process. The Tier 2 
methodology is a mass balance approach that is applicable to estimating CO2 emissions but is not applicable to 
estimating CH4 emissions. When using the Tier 2 methodology, both carbon flows of primary and secondary 
feedstocks to the process are included in the mass balance calculation. Carbon flows of primary fuels to the 
Chapter 3: Chemical Industry Emissions 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.65 
process may involve combustion of part of the hydrocarbon content for heat raising and the production of 
secondary fuels (e.g., off gases). In order to apply the Tier 2 methodology the flows of primary and secondary 
feedstocks to the process and the flows of primary and secondary products must be characterised, and the flows 
of by-products burned for energy recovery within the process and flows of by-products transferred out of the 
process must be characterised.  
 
CARBON DIOXIDE 
The decision tree for choice of method for CO2 emissions is shown in Figure 3.8. The Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 
methods are described in this section. 
 
Tier 1 product-based emission factor method 
The Tier 1 emission factor methodology is applied to estimate CO2 emissions from the petrochemical process in 
cases where neither plant specific data nor activity data for carbon flows are available for the petrochemical 
process. The Tier 1 emission factor method does not require activity data for the consumption of each carbon-
containing feedstock to the petrochemical production process. It requires only activity data for the amount of 
product produced.  The Tier 1 methodology does not consider the carbon content of emissions of carbon 
monoxide or NMVOC that may be generated by the petrochemical processes. The equations in this section for 
petrochemical production processes also apply to carbon black production. 
The Tier 1 method calculates emissions from petrochemical processes on the basis of activity data for production 
of each petrochemical and the process-specific emission factor for each petrochemical, as shown in the Equation 
3.15 for production of each primary petrochemical product (e.g., methanol, ethylene, ethylene dichloride, 
ethylene oxide, acrylonitrile) and carbon black.

data for ethylene steam crackers operating in Western Europe. Geographic Adjustment Factors are applied to the 
Tier 1 emission factor to account for regional variability in steam cracker operating efficiency.  Geographic 
Adjustment Factors are only applicable to ethylene production.  
If activity data for annual primary product production are not available, primary product production may be 
estimated from feedstock consumption, as shown in the Equation 3.16:

Either Equation 3.15 or both Equation 3.15 and Equation 3.16 would be applied separately to each of the known 
feedstocks for each petrochemical process. The Tier 1 emissions estimate shown in Box 1 of Figure 3.8 would 
utilise Equation 3.15, while the Tier 1 emissions estimate shown in Box 2 of Figure 3.8 would use either

Equation 3.15 or both Equation 3.16 and Equation 3.15. Equation 3.15 would be utilised alone in cases where 
annual primary product production data are available for the petrochemical process. In cases where annual 
primary product production data are not available but feedstock consumption data are available for the 
petrochemical process, Equation 3.16 would be utilised to estimate the annual production of primary products, 
and the annual primary product production estimated using Equation 3.16 would then be applied in Equation 
3.15 to estimate the emissions. 
 
Tier 2 total feedstock carbon balance method 
The Tier 2 method is a feedstock-specific and process-specific carbon balance approach. This approach is 
applicable in cases where activity data are available for both feedstock consumption and primary and secondary 
product production and disposition. Activity data for all carbon flows are required to implement the Tier 2 
methodology. Examples of process flow diagrams that illustrate feedstock and product flows for the methanol, 
ethylene dichloride, ethylene oxide, acrylonitrile, and carbon black production processes are included in an 
Annex to Section 3.9. The number of potential feedstocks and products for ethylene production from the steam 
cracking process is such that the process is better illustrated by a feedstock-product matrix rather than by a 
process flow diagram. The feedstock-product matrix for ethylene production is included in Table 3.25 in Section 
3.9.2.3. A flow diagram of the Tier 2 method is shown in Figure 3.10.

The Tier 2 method calculates the difference between the total amount of carbon entering into the production 
process as primary and secondary feedstock and the amount of carbon leaving the production process as 
petrochemical products. The difference in carbon content of the primary and secondary feedstocks and the 
carbon content of the primary and secondary products produced by and recovered from the process is calculated 
as CO2.  The Tier 2 mass balance methodology is based on the assumption that all of the carbon input to the 
process is converted either into primary and secondary products or into CO2. This means that any of the carbon 
input to the process that is converted into CO, CH4, or NMVOC are assumed to be CO2 emissions for the 
purposes of the mass balance calculation.   
The overall mass balance equation for the Tier 2 methodology is Equation 3.17.

Feedstock and product carbon contents 
Carbon contents of feedstocks and products of petrochemical production processes are listed in Table 3.10, in 
units of tonnes of carbon per tonne of feedstock or product. Carbon contents of pure substances (e.g., methanol) 
are calculated from the chemical formula. Carbon contents of other feedstocks and products (e.g., carbon black 
feedstock, carbon black) are estimated from literature sources. Representative carbon contents of fossil fuels 
(e.g., natural gas, naphtha) can be found in Table 1.3 in Chapter 1 of Volume 2: Energy; however, carbon 
contents for fossil fuels will vary by country and region and are best obtained from national energy statistics or 
fossil fuel product specifications or national standards. 
 
Tier 3 direct estimate of plant-specific emissions 
The most rigorous good practice method is to use plant specific data to calculate CO2 emissions from the 
petrochemical production process. In order to apply the Tier 3 method, plant-specific data and/or plant-specific 
measurements are required. The emissions from the petrochemical production process include CO2 emitted from 
fuel or process by-products combusted to provide heat or thermal energy to the production process, CO2 emitted 
from process vents, and CO2 emitted from flared waste gases. These emissions are calculated using Equations 
3.20 through 3.22. 
Overall CO2 emissions from the petrochemical production process are calculated using Equation 3.20

METHANE 
The decision tree for choice of method for CH4 emissions is shown in Figure 3.9. The Tier 1 and Tier 3 methods 
for CH4 are described in this section. There is no Tier 2 method applicable to CH4 emissions. 
Tier 1 product-based emission factor method 
CH4 emissions from petrochemical processes may be fugitive emissions and/or process vent emissions. Fugitive 
emissions are emitted from flanges, valves, and other process equipment. Emissions from process vent sources 
include incomplete combustion of waste gas in flare and energy recovery systems. CH4 emissions using the Tier 
1 method may be calculated using Equation 3.23 for fugitive CH4 emissions and Equation 3.24 for process vent 
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
3.70 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
emissions and Equation 3.25 for total CH4 emissions. If annual primary product production data are not available 
but feedstock consumption data are available for the petrochemical process, Equation 3.16 would be utilised to 
estimate the annual production of primary products, and the annual primary product production estimated using 
Equation 3.16 would then be applied in Equations 3.23 and 3.24 to estimate the emissions.

PPi = annual production of petrochemical i, tonnes 
EFfi = CH4 fugitive emission factor for petrochemical i, kg CH4/tonne product 
EFpi = CH4 process vent emission factor for petrochemical i, kg CH4/tonne product 
 
Tier 2 total feedstock carbon balance method 
The total feedstock carbon mass balance method is not applicable to estimation of CH4 emissions. The total 
carbon mass balance method estimates the total carbon emissions from the process but does not directly provide 
an estimate of the amount of the total carbon emissions that is emitted as CO2, CH4, CO, or NMVOC.  
 
Tier 3 direct estimate of plant-specific emissions 
The Tier 3 method is based on continuous or periodic plant-specific measurements. The emissions from the 
petrochemical production process include CH4 emitted from fuel or process by-products combusted to provide 
heat or thermal energy to the production process, CH4 emitted from process vents, and CH4 emitted from flared 
waste gases. If methane is vented directly to the atmosphere this will dominate the emissions. CH4 emissions 
from process vents may also be combusted in a flare or energy recovery device. Measurement of atmospheric 
concentration of VOCs directly above the plants or in the plume is the preferred activity data for estimating 
fugitive CH4 emissions; however, such data may not be available. The atmospheric measurements are generally 
expensive and will most often not be continuous measurements but rather a discrete and periodic measurement 
program to obtain data to be used as basis for the development of plant specific emission factors.  The results of 
such measurement programs would then be related to other plant process parameters to enable estimation of 
emissions between measurement periods. 
Direct measurement of VOC and CH4 concentrations in plant exhaust gas streams and direct measurement of 
fugitive VOC and CH4 emissions from plant valves, fittings, and related equipment using a comprehensive leak 
detection programme can also be used to obtain plant-specific activity data for developing Tier 3 estimates of 
CH4 emissions.  However the plant-specific leak detection programme should provide fugitive CH4 emissions 
data for all of the relevant CH4-emitting plant equipment. Similarly, the plant-specific measurement data for 
stacks and vents would need to cover the major portion of stack and vent CH4 emissions sources at the plant in 
order to provide a basis for a Tier 3 emission calculation. 
Chapter 3: Chemical Industry Emissions 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.71 
Emissions of CH4 from process stacks and vents may be estimated by direct measurement of the CH4 
concentration of the exhaust gas or estimated as a component of the total VOC concentration measured in the 
exhaust gas.  Fugitive emissions of CH4 from plant equipment (e.g., valves, fittings) may be estimated through 
application of plant-specific leak detection data and plant equipment inventories, provided that the plant-specific 
leak detection program and equipment inventory are comprehensive, such that the program provides fugitive 
CH4 emissions data for all of the relevant CH4-emitting plant equipment. Similarly, the plant-specific 
measurement data for stacks and vents would need to cover the major portion of stack and vent CH4 emissions 
sources at the plant in order to provide a basis for a Tier 3 emission calculation.  
Measurement of fugitive emissions may also be based on the CH4 concentration in the atmosphere immediately 
above the plant or in a plume downwind. Such atmospheric measurement data would generally measure 
emissions from the entire plant, and does not separate between the different sources. In addition to CH4 
concentration the area of the plume and the wind speed must be measured. The emissions are given by Equation 
3.26.

Note: ∫t means the quantity should be summed over time. 
Note that the Tier 3 methodology does not direct inventory compilers to conduct atmospheric measurements or 
other specific types of direct measurements to estimate site-specific CH4 emissions.  It is anticipated that plant-
specific leak detection data and plant-specific stack and vent emission data will be more readily available than 
atmospheric measurement data.  However, if atmospheric measurement data are available the data may be used 
to develop Tier 3 estimates of CH4 emissions, or to verify other estimates.  Atmospheric measurement data may 
provide a more accurate estimate of process CH4 emissions than leak detection data and stack and vent emission 
data. A plant would use either i) Equation 3.26 or ii) Equations 3.27, 3.28, and 3.29 to estimate CH4 emissions. 
Process vent emissions are assumed to be monitored either discretely or continuously. The method of calculation 
will vary depending upon the type of data, and therefore no separate equation is provided for process vent 
emissions calculation. 
Overall emissions of CH4 from the petrochemical production process based on plant-specific leak detection data

CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTORS 
This section includes a discussion of the choice of emission factors for the Tier 1 method.  The Tier 2 method is 
based on mass balance principles and the Tier 3 method is based on plant-specific data; therefore there are no 
default emission factors applicable to the Tier 2 and Tier 3 methods.

Tier 1 emission factors for CO2 emissions and CH4 emissions for petrochemical products are provided below.  
Tier 1 emission factors for CO2 emissions do not include carbon emitted as CO, CH4, or NMVOC. Separate Tier 
1 emission factors are provided for CH4 emissions from petrochemical processes.  Tier 1 emission factors are not 
provided for carbon monoxide and NMVOC emissions. 
The Tier 1 method allows for the selection of a ‘default’ feedstock and ‘default’ process in instances where 
activity data are not available to identify the feedstock or the process utilised to produce the petrochemical. 
Table 3.11 provides the default feedstocks and default processes for each petrochemical production process. In 
Chapter 3: Chemical Industry Emissions 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.73 
the event that no activity data are available concerning the specific processes and feedstocks used within a 
country to produce the petrochemical, the default process and default feedstock identified in Table 3.11 and the 
associated Tier 1 emission factors identified in the subsequent tables in this section are used to estimate the CO2 
emissions from the petrochemical production process. Country-specific emission factors may be used instead of 
the default emission factors if country-specific factors are available.  
Methanol 
Carbon dioxide emissions 
Emissions of CO2 from methanol production from the steam reforming and partial oxidation processes may be 
estimated by applying the default process feedstock emission factors, or the feedstock-specific and process-
specific emission factors in Table 3.12, to activity data for methanol production, process configuration and 
process feedstock.  The default emission factors are based on the average of plant-specific CO2 emissions data 
reported for four methanol plants using the conventional steam reforming process without primary reformer and 
using natural gas feedstock.  Emissions data used in developing the default CO2 emission factor were reported 
for conventional process methanol plants in New Zealand, Chile, and Canada and in the Netherlands.  Emission 
factors in the table include both the CO2 emissions arising from the process feedstock and the CO2 emissions 
arising from feedstock combusted within the steam reforming process. Table 3.13 summarises the total feedstock 
consumption, in units of GJ/tonne methanol produced, for the various methanol production process 
configurations and feedstocks shown in Table 3.12. 
The conventional reforming process can include a single reformer unit or both a primary reformer unit and a 
secondary reformer. The emission factors differ depending upon the number of reformer units. Lurgi is a 
provider of methanol process technology and has published emission factors for several conventional reforming 
process technologies, see Table 3.12. The production capacity of Mega Methanol plants is generally greater than 
5 000 tonnes per day of methanol. The emission factors for the Lurgi Conventional process technologies should 
be applied only if the specific process technology is known. Otherwise the emission factor for conventional 
steam reforming without primary reformer, or the emission factor for conventional steam reforming with primary 
reformer, should be applied. 
The conventional steam reforming process for methanol production can be integrated with an ammonia 
production process. The emission factor for integrated methanol and ammonia production should be used only if 
the specific process technology is known.

Methane emissions 
Methanex reported CH4 emissions from two Canadian methanol production plants in their 1996 Climate Change 
Action Plan (Methanex, 1996). Methanex reported that CH4 emissions from methanol production may arise from 
reformers, package boilers, methanol distillation units, and crude methanol storage tanks. CH4 emissions from 
the plants accounted for approximately 0.5 percent to 1.0 percent of the total greenhouse gas emissions from the 
plants, but were reported to vary depending upon the level of maintenance and operational control of the plant 
equipment. The average emission factor reported for two reporting years is 2.3 kg CH4 emissions per tonne of 
methanol produced. CH4 emissions from a second Methanex methanol production plant were reported to be 0.15 
kg CH4 per tonne of methanol produced.  The higher of the two reported values, 2.3 kg CH4 per tonne of 
methanol produced, should be applied as the default CH4 emission factor for methanol production. CH4 
emissions as low as 0.1 kg/tonne have been estimated for the methanol plant Tjeldbergodden, Norway (SFT, 
2003a).

Emissions of CO2 from steam cracking for ethylene production may be estimated using the feedstock-specific 
emission factors in Table 3.14 and activity data for the amount of ethylene produced from the steam cracking 
processes. Separate emission factors are provided in Table 3.14 for the CO2 emissions from feedstock 
consumption and from supplemental energy consumption in the steam cracking process. However, the CO2 
emissions from both feedstock consumption and supplemental energy consumption are to be reported as 
Industrial Process emissions under the reporting convention discussed above. The default emission factors are 
derived from plant-specific data for steam crackers operating in Western Europe. The emission factors may be 
adjusted by applying the default geographic adjustment factors in Table 3.15 to account for differences in the 
energy efficiency of steam cracking units among various countries and regions. Note that as indicated in Table 
3.11, the default feedstock for steam crackers operating in North and South America and Australia is ethane, and 
the default feedstock for steam crackers operating on other continents is naphtha. 
These default emission factors do not include CO2 emissions from flaring. Emissions from flaring amount to 
about 7 percent of total emissions in a well-maintained plant in Norway. Steam cracking processes that utilise 
naphtha, propane, and butane feedstocks are assumed to be energy neutral, requiring no use of supplemental fuel, 
therefore there are assumed to be no CO2 emissions associated with supplemental fuel consumption for these 
feedstocks.

Default feedstocks for ethylene production are identified in Table 3.11. The emission factors do not include supplemental fuel use in flares.  
Other feedstocks are assumed to have the same product yields as naphtha feedstock. 
Uncertainty values for this table are included in Table 3.27. 
 
The emission factors in Table 3.14 may be used in the event that activity data are available only for the amount 
of ethylene produced by the steam cracking process. Steam cracking is a multi-product process that leads to 
ethylene, propylene, butadiene, aromatics, and several other high-value chemicals. There is an inherent 
assumption of a specific product mix in the default emission factors in Table 3.14. The default product mix for 
each emission factor in Table 3.14 is identified in the ethylene steam cracking feedstock-product matrix in 
Section 3.9.2.3. The feedstock/product matrix identifies the default values for production of ethylene, propylene, 
and other hydrocarbon products from the steam cracking process in units of kilograms of each product produced 
per tonne of feedstock. In order to develop the emission factors for steam cracking shown in Table 3.14 the total 
CO2 process emissions of a steam cracker have been divided by the output of ethylene only. In other words 
ethylene has been chosen as the reference for estimating the total CO2 emissions from the steam cracking process 
as a whole. Multiplication of the emission factors in Table 3.14 by the ethylene production therefore leads to the 
total CO2 emissions resulting not only from the production of ethylene but also from the production of propylene, 
butadiene, aromatics, and all other chemicals produced by the steam cracking process. The default emission 
factors in Table 3.14 provide the total CO2 emissions from the steam cracking process, not only the CO2 
emissions associated with the production of the ethylene from the steam cracking process.

Methane emissions 
Default fugitive CH4 emission factors for steam cracking of ethane and naphtha for ethylene production are 
estimated from total VOC emissions factors and VOC species profile data from EMEP/CORINAIR Emission 
Inventory Guidebook (EEA, 2005). Overall volatile organic compound emissions from steam cracking are 
estimated to be 5 kg/tonne ethylene produced based on a European publication, for which the feedstock is 
assumed to be naphtha, and estimated to be 10 kg VOC/tonne ethylene produced based on a U.S. publication, for 
which the feedstock is assumed to be ethane. From the total VOC emission factors the overall CH4 emissions 
from steam cracking of naphtha are estimated from the VOC species profile to be 3 kg/tonne ethylene produced, 
primarily from leakage losses, and the overall CH4 emissions from cracking of ethane are estimated from the 
species profile to be twice those from cracking of naphtha (6 kg/tonne ethylene produced); however these factors 
are subject to uncertainty as the overall VOC emission factors of 5 kg VOC/tonne ethylene for naphtha feedstock 
and 10 kg VOC/tonne ethylene for ethane feedstock are each based on a single publication. Emissions of CH4 
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use

2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
from steam cracking of feedstocks other than ethane and naphtha have been assumed to be the same as that 
estimated from the EMEP/CORINAIR data for steam cracking of naphtha. 
Published data show a large variability in reported CH4 emission factors for ethylene production. The European 
Association of Plastics Manufacturers (APME) Eco-Profiles of the European Plastics Industry reports a CH4 
emission factor for ethylene production of 2.9 kg CH4/tonne ethylene produced, as referenced in the APME Eco-
Profiles for Olefins Production (Boustead, 2003a). The CH4 emission factor for ethylene steam cracker process 
operations is based on life-cycle analysis data for 15 European steam crackers. Emissions as low as 0.14 kg 
CH4/tonne ethylene are estimated on the basis of direct measurement at a Norwegian ethylene plant (SFT 2003b) 
and as low as 0.03 kg CH4/tonne ethylene based on company data reported in the Australian Methodology for the 
Estimation of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks, 2003 (AGO, 2005). Other European and Australian steam 
cracker operators reported plant-specific CH4 emissions on the order of 10 percent of the values reported in 
Table 3.16 (DSM, 2002; Qenos, 2003; Qenos, 2005). Therefore, the emission factors in Table 3.16 should not be 
used to estimate CH4 emissions from steam cracker ethylene plants for which plant-specific data are available.  
In this case the plant-specific data and the Tier 3 method should be used. Default CH4 emission factors for 
various process feedstocks are shown in Table 3.16. Note that the default feedstocks for ethylene production are 
identified in Table 3.11.

Ethylene dichloride and vinyl chloride monomer 
Carbon dioxide emissions 
Emission factors are provided in Table 3.17 for the ethylene dichloride and vinyl chloride monomer production 
processes, including the direct chlorination process, oxychlorination process, and balanced process. The CO2 
emission factors are derived by averaging plant-specific CO2 emissions data for European plants reported in the 
Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) Reference Document on Best Available Techniques in the 
Large Volume Organic Chemical Industry (European IPPC Bureau, February 2003; referred to in this section as 
the IPPC LVOC BAT Document). Note that as indicated in Table 3.11, the default process is the balanced 
process for EDC production with an integrated VCM production plant. The total CO2 emission factor for each 
process includes noncombustion CO2 emissions from the ethylene dichloride process vent and combustion CO2 
emissions from ethylene dichloride plant combustion sources. Plant combustion source emission factors include 
combustion of both process waste gas and auxiliary fuel in the process waste gas thermal incinerator. The 
combustion-related emission factor does not include emissions from flares. Combustion-related emission factors 
in Table 3.17 are based on data from oxychlorination process plants but the emission factors are assumed also to 
apply to direct chlorination and balanced process plants. Feedstock consumption factors for ethylene dichloride 
and vinyl chloride monomer production processes are provided in Table 3.18. The PlasticsEurope EcoProfiles 
(Boustead, 2005) for EDC production indicates ethylene utilisation of 0.306 tonnes ethylene per tonne EDC 
produced, based on eight European plants. 
It should be noted that the CO2 emission factors in Table 3.17 in units of tonnes CO2 per tonne EDC produced 
and in units of tonnes CO2 per tonne VCM produced are not additive. The two CO2 emission factors both apply 
to the integrated EDC/VCM production process, however the tonnes CO2 per tonne EDC factor is based on EDC 
production activity data while the tonnes CO2 per tonne VCM factor is based on VCM production activity data.  
The CO2 emission factor that will be applied will depend upon whether activity data for EDC production or 
activity data for VCM production are available.  Similarly, the feedstock consumption factors in Table 3.18 in 
units of tonnes ethylene consumed per tonne EDC produced and in units of tonnes ethylene consumed per tonne 
VCM produced are not additive. The feedstock consumption factor that will be applied will depend upon 
whether activity data are available for EDC production or for VCM production.

the process is not included in the average emission factor.

Methane emissions 
The EMEP/CORINAIR ‘species profile’ for the ethylene dichloride/vinyl chloride monomer balanced process 
indicates that there are no CH4 emissions from the process other than CH4 emissions from combustion sources.  
The EMEP/CORINAIR species profile reports that VOC emissions from leakage losses and storage and 
handling do not contain CH4. The EMEP/CORINAIR also reports that 2 percent of the total VOC emissions 
from the balanced process are from combustion sources and that CH4 constitutes 1.2 percent of overall VOC 
emissions. Therefore it may be assumed that non-combustion CH4 emissions from ethylene dichloride/vinyl 
chloride monomer production are negligible. 
CH4 emissions from combustion of natural gas supplemental fuel in the ethylene dichloride/vinyl chloride 
monomer production process may be estimated from activity data for natural gas supplemental fuel consumption 
and CH4 emission factor for natural gas combustion. Natural gas consumption for integrated ethylene 
dichloride/vinyl chloride monomer production is estimated to be 110.1 Nm3 natural gas/tonne VCM produced for 
an integrated ethylene dichloride/vinyl chloride monomer production plant in the Netherlands and 126.4 Nm3 
natural gas/tonne VCM produced for an integrated ethylene dichloride/vinyl chloride monomer production plant 
in Germany. The average of these two values is 118.3 Nm3 natural gas/tonne VCM. The CH4 emission factor for 
the integrated EDC/VCM production process is based on a CH4 emission factor of 5 g CH4/GJ natural gas 
combusted and the average natural gas consumption of the two European plants. The default CH4 emission factor 
for the integrated ethylene dichloride/vinyl chloride monomer production process is provided in Table 3.19. The 
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use

default emission factor is not applicable to stand-alone EDC production plants. If natural gas consumption 
activity data are available, the CH4 emission factor of 5 g CH4/GJ may be applied directly to the activity data, 
rather than using the default emission factor.

Ethylene oxide 
Carbon dioxide emissions 
Emissions of CO2 from ethylene oxide production may be estimated using emission factors based on activity 
data for ethylene oxide production, and activity data for process configuration and catalyst selectivity. Separate 
CO2 emission factors are provided in Table 3.20 for the CO2 emissions from the air process and for the CO2 
emissions from the oxygen process for a range of catalyst selectivity. The default emission factors for the air 
process and for the oxygen process are estimated from process-specific catalyst selectivity data provided in the 
IPPC LVOC BAT document. Specific data concerning the type of process and the selectivity of the process 
catalyst are needed in order to select emission factors from Table 3.20. The emission factors are derived from the 
catalyst selectivity using stoichiometric principles and are based on the assumption that emissions of CH4 and 
NMVOC from the process are negligible and that all of the carbon contained in the ethylene feedstock is 
converted either into ethylene oxide product or to CO2 emissions. The emission factors in Table 3.20 do not 
include emissions from flares.  
As shown in Table 3.20, the default emission factor for the air process is based on a default process catalyst 
selectivity of 70 percent and the default emission factor for the oxygen process is based on a default catalyst 
selectivity of 75 percent. If activity data are not available for the process configuration or the catalyst selectivity, 
the default process configuration is the air process and the default catalyst selectivity is 70 percent. If activity 
data are available that identify the process used as the oxygen process, but activity data are not for the catalyst 
selectivity for the oxygen process, the emission factor for the default catalyst selectivity of 75 percent for the 
oxygen process in Table 3.20 should be used.

Methane emissions 
The IPPC LVOC BAT document for ethylene oxide production reported CH4 emissions factors (in units of 
kilograms methane per tonne ethylene oxide produced) for the ethylene oxide process vent, ethylene oxide 
purification process exhaust gas steam, and fugitive emissions sources. CH4 emission factors were reported in 
the IPPC LVOC BAT document for European ethylene oxide plant carbon dioxide removal vents before and 
after treatment. CH4 emissions were also reported for two ethylene oxide plants in the Netherlands. CH4 
emission factors for ethylene oxide production were developed by averaging these data. Emissions of CH4 may 
be estimated by applying the emissions factors included in Table 3.21 to activity data for ethylene oxide 
production. The default CH4 emission factor for ethylene oxide production assumes no thermal treatment process.

The emission factors in Table 3.22 are based on an average (default) propylene feedstock consumption factor of 
1.09 tonnes propylene feedstock per tonne acrylonitrile produced, corresponding to a primary product yield 
factor of approximately 70 percent. The default CO2 emission factor is based on conversion of propylene 
feedstock to secondary product acetonitrile at 18.5 kilograms per tonne acrylonitrile produced, and conversion of 
propylene to secondary product hydrogen cyanide at 105 kilograms per tonne acrylonitrile produced, and is 
based on process-specific acrylonitrile yield data and process-specific feedstock consumption data reported in 
the IPPC LVOC BAT document (European IPPC Bureau, 2003). Note however that the acrylonitrile production 
process may be configured and operated to produce a greater or lesser amount of secondary products. The 
default CO2 emission factor is based on the assumption that the secondary products (acetonitrile and hydrogen 
cyanide) of the acrylonitrile production process and hydrocarbon by products in the main absorber vent gas are 
either burned for energy recovery or flared to CO2 and are not recovered as products or emitted to the 
atmosphere without combustion treatment. The CO2 emission factors do not include CO2 emissions from any 
combustion of auxiliary fuel (e.g., natural gas) for the process waste gas energy recovery or flare systems. 
If activity data are not available concerning whether secondary products are recovered for sale, the default 
assumption is that the secondary products are either burned for energy recovery or flared to CO2 and the default 
primary product process yield factor is 70 percent. 
For the process configuration where secondary products (acetonitrile and hydrogen cyanide) are recovered for 
sale and are not either flared to CO2 or burned for energy recovery, the overall process yield factor of primary 
and secondary products is 85 percent. 
If activity data for propylene feedstock consumption are not available, the propylene feedstock consumption may 
be estimated from the acrylonitrile production activity data by applying a default feedstock consumption factor 
of 1.09 tonnes propylene feedstock consumed per tonne acrylonitrile produced. 
Methane emissions 
The Life-Cycle Analysis Data Summary for Acrylonitrile reports a CH4 emission factor for acrylonitrile 
production of 0.18 kg CH4/tonne acrylonitrile produced, as referenced in the European Association of Plastics 
Manufacturers (APME) Life-Cycle Analysis Report (Boustead, 1999). The CH4 emission factor for acrylonitrile 
process operations is based on life-cycle analysis data for European acrylonitrile plants in Germany, Italy, and 
the United Kingdom collected between 1990 and 1996. CH4 emissions from acrylonitrile production may be 
estimated by applying this default emission factor to the acrylonitrile production data.

Carbon black 
Carbon dioxide emissions 
Emissions of CO2 from carbon black production may be estimated by applying the process and feedstock-
specific emission factors to the carbon black production activity data.  Separate emission factors are provided in 
Table 3.23 for the furnace black process, thermal black process, and acetylene black process and their associated 
feedstocks, and separate emission factors are provided for primary feedstock and secondary feedstock. The 
emission factors are based on the assumption that process emissions are subjected to a thermal treatment process. 
A range of values for primary and secondary carbon black feedstock is included in Table 4.11 of the draft 
Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) Reference Document for Best Available Techniques in the 
Large Volume Inorganic Chemicals (LVIC) Solid and Others Industry (European IPPC Bureau, June 2005; 
referred to in this chapter as the Draft IPPC LVIC BAT Document.) The CO2 emission factors in Table 3.23 are 
based on the average of the range of values. Primary and secondary feedstock consumption is converted to 
carbon consumption using average values for carbon black feedstock carbon content. The CO2 emission factors 
are calculated from the carbon input to the process (primary and secondary feedstocks) and carbon output 
(carbon black) from the process, using an average value for carbon black carbon content.

CH4 emissions for the carbon black production process are provided in Table 3.24. The draft IPPC LVIC BAT 
document for carbon black reported the CH4 content of uncombusted tail gas from the carbon black production 
process and the estimated rate of generation of tail gas from the carbon black production process. Based on 
10,000 Nm3 tail gas per tonne carbon black produced and an average reported CH4 concentration of 0.425 
percent by volume, the uncontrolled CH4 emission factors is 28.7 kg CH4/tonne carbon black produced. 
Combustion flare efficiency for carbon black process flare systems was reported in the Draft IPPC LVIC BAT 
Document as 99.8 percent for carbon monoxide, and the same efficiency is assumed to apply to CH4. The CH4 
emission factor for carbon black production after application of combustion control is 0.06 kg CH4/tonne carbon 
black produced. An overall CH4 emission factor of 0.11 kg CH4/tonne carbon black, based on company data, was 
reported in the Australian Methodology for the Estimation of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks, 2003 (AGO, 
2005.) Three carbon black production plants in Germany reported a common CH4 emission factor of 0.03 kg 
CH4/tonne carbon black produced, based on measurement data after waste gas combustion using BAT 
(Thermische Nachverbrennung als Stand der Technik.)

TIER 2 
The Tier 2 methodology is based on mass balance calculations and therefore there are no emission factors 
associated with the methodology. 
Chapter 3: Chemical Industry Emissions 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.81 
TIER 3 
For the Tier 3 method plant specific emissions may be estimated using Equations 3.20 through 3.22 for CO2, and 
using either Equation 3.26 or Equations 3.27 through 3.29 for CH4. The emission factors may be related to 
annual production for estimation of emissions between measurements when these are not continuous. 
3.9.2.3 
CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
General aspects of data collection for obtaining activity data are discussed in Chapter 2 of Volume 1. When 
using the Tier 3 method plant-specific activity data should be obtained from the production plants. Direct 
measurements of the total flow to the steam cracker and flare system together with an analysis of the gas carbon 
content will provide the most accurate basis for an emissions estimate.  
Plant specific energy balance and/or carbon balance may also be used to derive plant specific emission factors. 
The variety of energy and carbon flows across the plant boundary makes this a data intensive but still much less 
resource intensive approach. While feedstock consumption data may be hard to obtain sales data and national 
statistics may provide approximate production volumes of the chemicals.  
METHANOL 
Emissions of CO2 from methanol production may be calculated from specific feedstock (e.g., natural gas) 
consumption and product (methanol) production activity data and carbon mass balance calculations. 
ETHYLENE 
Emissions of CO2 from ethylene production may be calculated from specific feedstock consumption and product 
production activity data and carbon mass balance calculations. In order to create a complete mass balance for the 
ethylene production process and implement the Tier 2 methodology for ethylene production, all feedstocks and 
the production and disposition of all primary and secondary products of the process should be identified using 
activity data. In cases where activity data are available for ethylene production but not available for production 
of secondary products from the steam cracking process, the production of secondary products may be estimated 
using the default factors in Table 3.25 and Equation 3.18. However, use of these default factors is a less accurate 
method than use of specific activity data for all primary and secondary products, and will increase the 
uncertainty of the estimate, as performance of steam crackers may vary depending on site-specific conditions. 
For example, site-specific data reported for steam crackers operating in Germany indicate that  hydrocarbon 
losses under normal operating conditions are on the order of 8.5 kg per tonne of hydrocarbon feedstock (BASF, 
2006) whereas the default value for hydrocarbon losses shown in Table 3.25 is 5 kg per tonne of hydrocarbon 
feedstock. In the event that activity data are not available for all secondary products, the Tier 1 method can be 
applied instead of the Tier 2 method. 
Secondary products produced by the steam cracking process may recovered and transferred to a petrochemical 
plant or petroleum refinery for material reuse, recycled within the steam cracking process as feedstock, or burned 
for energy recovery. Typically C4+ secondary products are recycled as feedstock or recovered for material reuse 
(BASF, 2006). Allocation of CO2 emissions from combustion of secondary products for energy recovery is 
described in Box 1.1 in Chapter 1 of this volume. If activity data are not available for the disposition of C4+ 
secondary products the default assumption is that the C4+ secondary products are recovered and transferred to 
another process for material reuse. If data are not available for the disposition of CH4 produced by the steam 
cracking process, the default assumption is that the CH4 is burned for energy recovery within the steam cracking 
process and results in CO2 emissions from the process. 
Steam crackers operated within the petrochemical industry may obtain the petrochemical feedstock for the 
ethylene production process directly from an adjacent petroleum refinery.  Depending upon the feedstock and 
process operating conditions, steam crackers may also generate ‘backflows’ of hydrocarbon by-products that are 
returned to the adjacent refinery for further processing. Any CO2 emissions from processing backflows at 
petroleum refineries are not included in the process CO2 emission factors for the steam cracker ethylene 
production process, but are considered in the feedstock and carbon flow analysis for the process.

ETHYLENE DICHLORIDE AND VINYL CHLORIDE MONOMER 
Emissions of CO2 from ethylene dichloride and vinyl chloride monomer production may be calculated from 
specific feedstock (ethylene) consumption and product (ethylene dichloride) production activity data and carbon 
mass balance calculations. 
ETHYLENE OXIDE 
Emissions of CO2 from ethylene oxide production may be calculated from specific feedstock (ethylene) 
consumption and product (ethylene oxide) production activity data and carbon mass balance calculations. 
ACRYLONITRILE 
In the event that activity data are not available for production of secondary products (acetonitrile and hydrogen 
cyanide), the default values in Table 3.26 and Equation 3.19 may be applied to the activity data for primary 
product production to estimate secondary product production.

If no activity data are available concerning acetonitrile product recovery it may be assumed that it is not 
recovered as product and is burned for energy recovery to CO2. If no activity data are available concerning 
thermal treatment of the acetonitrile main absorber vent gas it may be assumed that the vent gas is thermally 
treated and combusted to CO2 and is not vented to the atmosphere uncontrolled.

CARBON BLACK 
Emissions of CO2 from carbon black production may be calculated from specific primary feedstock (e.g., carbon 
black feedstock) and secondary feedstock (e.g., natural gas) consumption and product (carbon black) production 
activity data and carbon mass balance calculations. 
3.9.2.4 
COMPLETENESS 
In estimating CO2 emissions from petrochemical and carbon black processes, there is a risk of double-counting 
or omission in either the IPPU or the Energy Sector. Petrochemical and carbon black plants produce methane 
and non-methane hydrocarbon by-products that may be burned for energy recovery and such energy recovery 
may be reported in national energy statistics under ‘other’ fuels or some similar categorisation. If CO2 emissions 
from ‘other’ fuel combustion include industrial process off gases that are burned for energy recovery some 
adjustment to the energy statistics or to the CO2 emissions calculation for petrochemical production would be 
needed to avoid double counting of the CO2 emissions. 
METHANOL 
There may be production of methanol from biogenic (renewable) sources. Such biogenic methanol may be 
incorporated into methanol national production statistics, which would result in overestimation of CO2 emissions 
from fossil fuel (e.g., natural gas) derived methanol unless adjustments are made to the methanol production 
activity data. 
ETHYLENE 
There may be production of ethylene from petroleum refining processes or from petrochemical processes other 
than steam crackers. Such ethylene may be incorporated into ethylene national production statistics, which 
would result in overestimation of CO2 emissions from steam cracker derived ethylene unless adjustments are 
made to the ethylene production activity data.   
ETHYLENE DICHLORIDE AND VINYL CHLORIDE MONOMER 
Ethylene dichloride is an intermediate petrochemical product used to manufacture vinyl chloride monomer and 
other products. Activity data for production of ethylene dichloride may not be complete because the ethylene 
dichloride may be converted directly to vinyl chloride monomer in an integrated EDC/VCM plant. Therefore it 
may be the case that the vinyl chloride monomer production activity data are more complete with respect to 
industry coverage than the ethylene dichloride production activity data. However, utilisation of vinyl chloride 
monomer activity data as a surrogate for ethylene dichloride data also has issues related to completeness because 
not all of the ethylene dichloride is used to manufacture vinyl chloride monomer. Therefore adjustments to the 
activity data for vinyl chloride monomer may be needed to account for utilisation of ethylene dichloride in the 
production of other products. Based on data for North America and Europe utilisation of ethylene dichloride for 
products other than vinyl chloride monomer would amount to the order of 5 percent of total ethylene dichloride 
production. 
ETHYLENE OXIDE 
Ethylene oxide is an intermediate petrochemical product used to manufacture ethylene glycols and other 
products. Activity data for production of ethylene oxide may not be complete because the ethylene oxide may be 
converted directly to ethylene glycol in an integrated EO/EG plant. Ethylene oxide may also be converted into 
other products (e.g., amines, ethers, etc.) in integrated plants. Since only on the order of 70 percent of ethylene 
oxide production worldwide is used in the manufacture of ethylene glycols, production activity data for chemical 
products of ethylene oxide may not be more complete with respect to industry coverage than the ethylene oxide 
production activity data. 
CARBON BLACK 
There may be small amounts of production of carbon black from biogenic (renewable) sources such as animal 
black and bone black. Such biogenic carbon black may be incorporated into carbon black national production 
statistics, which would result in overestimation of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel derived carbon black. There 
also may be carbon black production within the physical boundaries of petroleum refineries rather than within 
the chemical industry. Carbon black produced within petroleum refineries is anticipated to be incorporated into 
national carbon black production statistics, therefore CO2 emissions from carbon black production within 
petroleum refineries should be reported along with other emissions from carbon black production within the 
chemical industry as industrial process emissions. 
There may be gaps in completeness with respect to carbon black feedstock consumption activity data. Activity 
data for carbon black feedstock derived from coal tar products, waste gases, or acetylene may not be available, 
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
3.84 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
which would result in underestimating of CO2 emissions from carbon black production if a higher-tier carbon 
balance approach was used. 
3.9.2.5 
DEVELOPING CONSISTENT TIME SERIES 
The emissions from petrochemical and carbon black production should be estimated using the same Tier and 
type of activity data for all years. Constructing a time series for emissions from petrochemical and carbon black 
production using plant specific measurement activity data will give the most accurate current emissions. 
However activity data on flaring and fugitive emissions will most likely not be available for previous years. If no 
technology upgrades have taken place calculating a plant specific emission factor based on recent measurement 
data related to production of petrochemicals may provide a reasonable result. Petrochemical production is often 
integrated in an industrial complex producing more than one chemical, or exchanges energy or chemical flows 
with adjacent industrial plants, and carbon black may be produced within petroleum refineries. When 
constructing a time series based on feedstock consumption great care should be taken to assure that the activity 
data includes the same flows every year in the time series. Again a Tier 1 type calculation using emission factors 
developed from recent plant specific emission estimates based on Tier 2 carbon balance calculation may be used. 
Investigations to uncover a change in choice of feedstock as well as variations in primary and secondary 
chemicals produced both within a single year and between years. Reconstruction of gaps in emission estimates 
and recalculations should follow the guidance in Volume 1, Chapter 5. 
3.9.3 
Uncertainty assessment 
Uncertainty assessments for each emissions factor and activity data applicable to each process are discussed in 
this section. Uncertainty ranges for the emission factors and activity data included in the Tables in the previous 
sections are summarised in Table 3.27. 
METHANOL 
Much of the uncertainty in emission estimates for methanol production is related to the difficulty in determining 
activity data including the quantity of methanol produced and, for higher tier methodologies, the amount of 
natural gas and other feedstocks consumed on an annual basis. Natural gas and other feedstock consumption may 
only be reported on an annual basis in national energy statistics, without any breakout of consumption for 
methanol production. If natural gas consumption activity data are not available then only an emission factor 
approach rather than a higher tier carbon balance approach is applicable.  If activity data are not available for 
consumption of other feedstocks for methanol production, it may be assumed that all of the national methanol 
production is from natural gas feedstock. However, this assumption would introduce some uncertainty. Further, 
activity data may not be available for annual CO2 feedstock consumption in methanol production plants that 
utilise CO2 as a supplemental feedstock in the production process. 
ETHYLENE 
Uncertainty in activity data for ethylene production is related to the difficulty in determining the types, quantities, 
and characteristics of feedstocks to the steam cracking process (e.g., ethane, naphtha) and the types, quantities, 
and characteristics of products from the process (e.g., ethylene, propylene). Feedstock consumption and product 
production may only be reported on an annual basis in national energy statistics and commodity statistics, 
without any breakout of feedstock consumption for ethylene production or product production from the steam 
cracking ethylene production process. The ability to conduct a carbon balance calculation for ethylene 
production depends upon the availability of both activity data for consumption of specific feedstocks and 
production of specific products of the steam cracking process. If only activity data for national annual ethylene 
production are available, the default feedstock for the country/region may be assumed and the default emission 
factor applied. In this case the feedstocks analysis would be conducted by utilising the default yield table for the 
default feedstock. However, considering the wide variability in emission factors and yield factors among the 
feedstocks, the unavailability of specific feedstock consumption data would introduce significant uncertainty into 
the emissions calculations and feedstocks analysis. If specific feedstock consumption activity data are available 
then a separate emissions estimate and feedstocks analysis may be conducted for each feedstock, which would 
reduce the uncertainty. Ideally, however, activity data would be available for both specific feedstock 
consumption and specific product production, allowing a higher tier carbon balance calculation to be conducted.   
Another source of uncertainty is related to the difficulty in determining other details of the steam cracking 
ethylene process configuration, including backflows of products of the steam cracking process from the 
petrochemical plant to the [potentially adjacent] petroleum refinery and flows of by products to energy recovery 
or flaring.  The unavailability of activity for refinery backflows would introduce uncertainty into the feedstocks 
analysis. 
Chapter 3: Chemical Industry Emissions 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.85 
ETHYLENE DICHLORIDE AND VINYL CHLORIDE MONOMER 
Sources of uncertainty for ethylene dichloride include the difficulty in determining the specific process utilised 
for the ethylene dichloride production and in determining activity data for the consumption of ethylene feedstock 
in the production process. If only activity data for ethylene dichloride production are available, the emission 
calculation may be conducted using the default [balanced] process product yield factor and default emission 
factor for the process. However, considering the variability in emission factors and yield factors for the 
oxychlorination process, direct oxidation process, and balanced process, the unavailability of specific ethylene 
feedstock consumption data by process would introduce significant uncertainty into the emissions calculations  
ETHYLENE OXIDE 
A main source of uncertainty for ethylene oxide production is the difficulty in determining activity data for the 
consumption of ethylene feedstock for ethylene oxide production.  If ethylene consumption activity data are not 
available then only an emission factor approach rather than a higher tier carbon balance approach is applicable.  
If only activity data for national annual ethylene oxide production are available, the default product yield may be 
assumed and the default emission factor applied.  In this case the feedstocks analysis would be conducted by 
utilising the default product yield factor. However, considering the range of reported product yield factors and 
emission factors for the ethylene oxide process, the unavailability of specific ethylene feedstock consumption 
data would introduce significant uncertainty into the emissions calculations. 
ACRYLONITRILE 
Sources of uncertainty for acrylonitrile production include the difficulty in determining the specific process 
configuration for acrylonitrile production, in determining activity data for the consumption of propylene 
feedstock in the production process, and in determining activity data for the production of acrylonitrile and 
acetonitrile from the process. If only activity data for acrylonitrile production are available, the emission 
calculation may be conducted using the default process configuration (assuming no acetonitrile recovery) and 
default emission factor for the process. However, the assumption that acetonitrile is not recovered from the 
process introduces significant uncertainty in the emission and feedstocks calculations and may result in 
overestimation of emissions and underestimation of feedstocks flows from the acrylonitrile process. Activity 
data for national production of both acrylonitrile and acetonitrile from the acrylonitrile production process would 
allow application of the process-specific emission factor for the percentage of national acrylonitrile production 
from which acetonitrile is recovered. Ideally, however, activity data for propylene consumption and activity data 
for acrylonitrile, acetonitrile, and hydrogen cyanide production from the acrylonitrile production process would 
allow utilisation of a higher-tier method, which would reduce the uncertainty. 
CARBON BLACK 
Uncertainty in activity data for carbon black production is related to the difficulty in determining the types, 
quantities, and characteristics of primary and secondary feedstocks to the carbon black process, and in 
determining the type of process used for the carbon black production and the characteristics of the carbon black 
product from the process. Primary and secondary feedstock consumption and carbon black production may only 
be reported on an annual basis in national energy statistics and commodity statistics, without any breakout of 
feedstock consumption for carbon black production for each carbon black production process. Most worldwide 
production of carbon black is by the furnace black process, therefore if feedstock consumption activity data are 
not available by process, all of the carbon black production may be assumed to be from the furnace black process 
without introducing a large amount of uncertainty. 
Also, if activity data are available for primary carbon black feedstock consumption, the data may be reported in 
generic terms as ‘carbon black feedstock’ without any indication of whether the feedstock is a petroleum-based 
feedstock produced at petroleum refineries or a coal tar-based feedstock produced from metallurgical coke 
production. Activity data may also not be available for other primary carbon black feedstocks (e.g., acetylene).  
Also, specific activity data may be available for natural gas consumption as secondary carbon black feedstock, 
however, activity data may not be available for other secondary feedstocks that may be used in carbon black 
production (e.g., coke oven gas). Unavailability of specific primary and secondary feedstock consumption data 
would add uncertainty to the feedstocks analysis. 
The ability to conduct a carbon balance calculation for carbon black production depends upon the availability of 
activity data for the consumption and the characteristics of primary and secondary feedstocks. If only activity 
data for national annual carbon black production are available, the default feedstock characteristics and product 
yield may be assumed and the default emission factor may be applied. However, considering the variability in 
feedstock characteristics and origin, the unavailability of specific feedstock consumption and composition 
activity data would introduce significant uncertainty into the emissions and feedstocks calculations. If specific 
feedstock consumption and characteristics activity data and associated carbon black production activity data are 
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
3.86 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
available then a separate carbon balance and feedstocks analysis may be conducted for each feedstock and 
process using a higher tier method, which would reduce the uncertainty. 
 
UNCERTAINTY RANGES 
Uncertainty ranges for Tier 1 emission factors and Tier 2 activity data and Tier 3 activity data for each process 
are provided in Table 3.27. The source of the data or expert judgement used in preparing the uncertainty estimate 
is identified in the table for each factor or activity data. Expert judgement elicitation was conducted by 
evaluating the range of available data. In many cases process-specific data were available only for several plants; 
the relatively large uncertainty ranges are the result of the relatively few data available and the expected 
variability of process configurations and feedstock utilisation efficiency among petrochemical and carbon black 
plants.

Quality Assessment/Quality Control (QA/QC), 
Reporting and Documentation 
3.9.4.1 
QUALITY ASSESSMENT/QUALITY CONTROL 
Quality Assurance/Quality Control for emissions factors and activity data involves methods to improve the 
quality or better understand the uncertainty of the emissions estimates.  It is good practice to conduct quality 
control checks for the Tier 1 method as outlined in Volume 1, Chapter 6. More extensive quality control checks 
and quality assurance procedures are applicable, if Tier 2 or Tier 3 methods are used to determine emissions. 
Inventory compilers are encouraged to use higher tier QA/QC for key categories as identified in Volume 1, 
Chapter 4.   
Evaluation of Tier 1 and Tier 2 method activity data 
The Tier 1 and Tier 2 methods both depend upon the application of activity data for petrochemical and carbon 
black production and/or activity data for feedstock consumption.  These activity data should not be expected to 
vary by more than about +/- 10 percent year to year, barring significant changes in the overall economic output 
of the country, the construction of new petrochemical production capacity, or other similar factors.  If the 
activity data vary by more than about +/-10 percent year to year, it is good practice to assess and document the 
country-specific conditions that account for the differences. 
Evaluation of Tier 1 method emission factors 
Inventory compilers that develop country-specific emission factors for petrochemical and carbon black 
production and apply the Tier 1 method should assess whether the estimated emission factors are within the 
range of the default emission factors and process-specific emission factors provided for the Tier 1 method in this 
guidance.  If the emission factors are outside of the range of factors reported in this Guidance, then the reasons 
why this is the case should be investigated (e.g., the process configuration differs from that for the emission 
factors reported in this guidance; the feedstock is a unique material not considered in this Guidance.) Inventory 
compilers should also ensure that the country-specific emission factors are consistent with the values derived 
from analysis of the process chemistry. For example, for methanol production from natural gas the carbon 
content of the CO2 generated, as estimated using the emission factor, should equal approximately the difference 
between the carbon content of the natural gas feedstock and the carbon content of the methanol product. If the 
emission factors are outside of the estimated ranges, it is good practice to assess and document the plant-specific 
conditions that account for the differences.  It is also good practice or inventory compilers using Tier 1 method 
emission factors included in this Guidance to conduct quality control checks to assess whether the data 
characteristics of the emission factor conform to the characteristics of the petrochemical and carbon black 
production processes in the country in which the emission factor is applied. 
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
3.88 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Evaluation of Tier 2 method mass balance calculations 
Application of the Tier 2 mass balance method depends upon the identification and characterisation of process 
flows. For the Tier 2 method, failure to identify all carbon-containing process flows or mischaracterisation of the 
flow rates or carbon contents of such process flows could result in significant deviation of the estimated CO2 
emissions from the actual CO2 emissions. The quality of Tier 2 mass balance calculation results are generally 
more dependent upon the quality of the activity data than are Tier 1 calculation results because in general a 
greater number of activity data need to be applied to the Tier 2 method than to the Tier 1 method.  Therefore, it is 
good practice to assess and document the quality of each activity data applied to the Tier 2 method and the 
completeness of the activity data prior to applying the Tier 2 method.  If the data quality or completeness are 
deemed not adequate for application of the Tier 2 method then the Tier 1 method should be applied. 
Evaluation of Tier 3 method plant-specific data 
The Tier 3 method is based on the application of plant-specific emissions data.  It is good practice for inventory 
compilers that conduct audits of plant-specific emissions estimates used in the inventory.  This involves 
evaluating whether the plant-specific data are representative of plant emissions and, if plant-specific data for a 
specific plant are applied to the national inventory, evaluating whether the plant-specific data representative of 
petrochemical and carbon black production processes in the country as a whole.  Audits of plant-specific data 
would involve the evaluation of: 
• 
Documentation of plant-specific measurement methodology; 
• 
Documentation of plant-specific measurement results; 
• 
Emissions estimation method and calculations;  
• 
Process feedstock(s) and product(s) 
• 
Activity data employed in emissions calculations; 
• 
Documentation of process technology and configuration; 
• 
List of assumptions;  
If the specific process for which plant-specific data are obtained is deemed not to be representative of other 
plants in the country producing the same petrochemical (e.g., if the feedstock differs or the process configuration 
differs) then the plant-specific data should not be applied to the overall inventory but only to the activity data for 
the specific plant. If emission measurements from individual plants are collected, inventory compilers should 
ensure that the measurements were made according to recognised national or international standards and the 
quality control methods were applied to the emissions measurement. Quality control procedures in use at the 
plant should be directly referenced and included in the quality control plan. If the measurement practices were 
not consistent with quality control standards or if the measurement procedures and results cannot be adequately 
documented, the inventory compiler should reconsider the use of the plant-specific data. 
3.9.4.2 
REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION 
Combustion emissions from combustion of off gases generated by petrochemical production processes are 
attributed to the IPPU Sector source category which produces them, and are reported as industrial process 
emissions. However, if any portion of the off gases generated by an IPPU Sector source category is combusted 
within a different IPPU Sector source category, or combusted within an Energy Sector source category, the 
corresponding emissions are reported as fuel combustion emissions rather than as industrial process emissions. 
This means that if the combustion emissions occur within the IPPU Sector source category which produced the 
off gases, then the emissions are reported as industrial process emissions attributed to that IPPU Sector source 
category. However, if the off gases are transferred out of the process to another source category in the IPPU 
Sector or a source category in the Energy Sector, then the emissions from the combustion of the off gases are 
reported as fuel combustion emissions within that source category. When the total emissions from the 
combustion of the off gases are calculated, the quantity transferred to and reported in the Energy Sector and the 
quantity transferred to and reported in a different IPPU Sector source category should be clearly quantified in the 
IPPU Sector source category calculations and in the Energy Sector source category calculations. If a country-

was developed and applied in the emission factor calculation, including reporting of the production process 
configuration upon which the emission factor and calculation are based.

FLUOROCHEMICAL PRODUCTION 
3.10.1 HFC-23 emission from HCFC-22 production 
3.10.1.1 
INTRODUCTION 
Trifluoromethane (HFC-23 or CHF3), is generated as a by-product during the manufacture of 
chlorodifluoromethane (HCFC-22 or CHClF2).3 Materials such as HFC-23 (and other HFCs, PFCs and SF6) are 
not significantly removed by aqueous (acidic, neutral or alkaline) scrubbing processes and will be released into 
the atmosphere. It is estimated that in 1990 the HFC-23 released from HCFC-22 plants was at most 4 percent of 
the production of HCFC-22 (U.S. EPA, 2001), in the absence of abatement measures. There are a small number 
of HCFC-22 production plants globally and thus a discrete number of point sources of HFC-23 emissions. While 
the methodology described here is applicable to by-product emissions of any fluorinated greenhouse gas, it has 
been written specifically for HFC-23. The methodology for emissions of fluorinated by-products in general and 
‘fugitive emissions’ is covered by Section 3.10.2.  
3.10.1.2 
METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES 
CHOICE OF METHOD 
There are two broad measurement approaches to estimating HFC-23 emissions from HCFC-22 plants. These are 
described in IPCC (2000), DEFRA (2002a and 2002b), EFCTC (2003) and UN (2004) and have been translated 
into Tier 2 and 3 methodologies described below. National emissions using either of these methodologies are the 
sum of those from the individual facilities. Tier 1 (default) methodology can be applied to individual plants or, if 
there is no abatement by destruction, to the total national output of HCFC-22. Accounting for HFC-23 emissions 
is not simply mechanistic but requires information on the process operations responsible for producing and 
emitting HFC-23, so that the most appropriate methodology and factors can be adopted. Therefore, it is good 
practice, to the extent possible, to establish contacts with plant managers in order to obtain the necessary data. 
The Tier 1 method is relatively simple, involving the application of a default emission factor to the quantity of 
HCFC-22 produced. This method can be applied at the plant level or the national level. Tier 2 and Tier 3 
methodologies are suitable only for plant level calculations because they rely on data that are only available from 
plants. In cases where there are Tier 3 data available for some plants, the Tier 1 or Tier 2 methods can be applied 
to the remainder to ensure complete coverage.   
It is good practice to estimate national emissions by summing measured parameters from all HCFC-22 plants in 
a country. Tier 3 plant emission measurements are the most accurate, followed by Tier 2 measurements based on 
plant efficiencies. Direct measurement is significantly more accurate than Tier 1 because it reflects the 
conditions specific to each manufacturing facility. In most cases, the data necessary to prepare Tier 3 estimates 
should be available because facilities operating to good business practice perform regular or periodic sampling of 
the final process vent or within the process itself as part of routine operations. The Tier 1 (default) method 
should be used only in cases where plant-specific data are unavailable and this subcategory is not identified as 
significant subcategory under key category. (See Section 4.2 of Volume 1.) Modern plant using process 
optimization will need to keep accurate HFC-23 generation data as part of this optimization, so plant-specific 
data should be available to most countries in most cases. 
The choice of good practice method will depend on national circumstances. The decision tree in Figure 3.16 
describes good practice in adapting the methods in these Guidelines to country-specific circumstances. 
Procedures to abate emissions include destruction of HFC-23 in a discrete facility and, in this case, emissions 
occur only when the destruction facility is not in operation. The tiers of methodology provide estimates for the 
quantity of HFC-23 that is produced and the share of production that is ultimately emitted depends on the length 
of time that the destruction facility is not operated.  For facilities using abatement techniques such as HFC-23 
destruction, verification of the abatement efficiency is also done routinely. It is good practice to subtract abated 
HFC-23 emissions from national estimates where the abatement has been verified by process records on every 
plant. 
                                                           
3  HCFC-22 is used as a refrigerant in several different applications, as a blend component in foam blowing, and as a 
chemical feedstock for manufacturing synthetic polymers. 
Chapter 3: Chemical Industry Emissions 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.93 
Tier 1 
In the Tier 1 methodology, a default factor is used to estimate production (and potential emissions) of HFC-23 
from the total HCFC-22 production from each facility (for both potentially dispersive uses, as reported under the 
Montreal Protocol, and feedstock uses, which are reported separately to the Ozone Secretariat). See Equation 
3.30.

EFdefault = HFC-23 default emission factor, kg HFC-23/kg HCFC-22 
PHCFC-22 = total HCFC-22 production, kg 
This methodology is suitable where plant-specific measurements are not available and, in that case, the default 
condition is that all of the estimated HFC-23 production is released into the atmosphere. 
 
Tier 2 
In the Tier 2 methodology, the HFC-23 emission factor is derived from records of process efficiencies and used 
in the calculation shown as Equation 3.31. This is a material balance approach and relies on calculating the 
difference between the expected production of HCFC-22 and the actual production and then assigning that 
difference to loss of raw materials, loss of product (HCFC-22) and conversion to by-products, including HFC-23. 
These parameters will be different for each plant and so should be assessed separately for each facility reporting 
into the national data.

Freleased = Fraction of the year that this stream was released to atmosphere untreated, fraction 
The emission factor can be calculated from both the carbon efficiency (Equation 3.32) and the fluorine efficiency 
(Equation 3.33) and the value used in Equation 3.31 should normally be the average of these two values unless 
there are overriding considerations (such as a much lower uncertainty of one of the efficiency measures) that can 
be adequately documented. Annual average carbon and fluorine balance efficiencies are features of a well-
managed HCFC-22 plant and are either normally available to the plant operator or may be obtained by 
examination of process accounting records.  Similarly, if there is a vent treatment system, the length of time that 
this was in operation, and treating the vent stream from the HCFC-22 plant, should be available from records. 
Total HCFC-22 production includes material that is used as a chemical feedstock as well as that which is sold for 
potentially dispersive uses.

The factor to assign the efficiency loss to HFC-23 is specific to each plant and, if this method of calculation is 
used, the factor should have been established by the process operator. By default, the value is 1; that is all of the 
loss in efficiency is due to co-production of HFC-23. In practice, this is commonly the most significant 
efficiency loss, being much larger than losses of raw materials or products. 
The factors for carbon and fluorine contents are calculated from the molecular compositions of HFC-23 and 
HCFC-22 and are common to all HCFC-22 plants at 0.81 for carbon and 0.54 for fluorine. 
 
Tier 3 
Tier 3 methodologies are potentially the most accurate. The Tier 3 methodologies provided here give equivalent 
results and the choice between them will be dictated by the information available in individual facilities. In each 
case, the national emission is the sum of factory specific emissions, each of which may be determined using a 
Tier 3 method to estimate the composition and flowrate of gas streams vented to atmosphere (either directly and 
continuously – as in Tier 3a - or by continuous monitoring of a process parameter related to the emission - Tier 
3b - or by monitoring the HFC-23 concentration continuously within the reactor product stream - Tier 3c):

Equation 3.40 for calculation of HFC-23 emissions at an individual facility by in-process 
measurement.) 
Tier 3a 
The Tier 3a method is based on frequent or continuous measurement of the concentration and flow-rate from the 
vent at an individual plant. So that the quantity emitted to atmosphere is the mathematical product of the mass 
concentration of the component in the stream, the flowrate of the total stream (in units compatible with the mass 
concentration) and the length of time that this flow occurred:

fij = the mass flow of the gas stream from process stream j at plant i (generally measured volumetrically 
and converted into mass flow using standard process engineering methods), kg gas/hour 
t = the length of time over which these parameters are measured and remain constant, hours 
If any HFC-23 is recovered from the vent stream for use as chemical feedstock, and hence destroyed, it should 
be discounted from this emission; material recovered for uses where it may be emitted may be discounted here, if 
the emissions are included in the quantity calculated by the methods in Chapter 7. Because emissions are 
measured directly in this tier, it is not necessary to have a separate term for material recovered, unlike Tiers 3b 
and 3c. 
The total quantity of HFC-23 released is then the annual sum of these measured instantaneous releases. Periods 
when the vent stream is processed in a destruction unit to remove HFC-23 should not be counted in this 
calculation. If it is necessary to estimate the quantity destroyed at each facility, the operator should calculate this 
based on the difference between the operating time of the plant and the duration of release (t above). 
Tier 3b 
In many cases, measurements are not continuous but were gained during an intensive process survey or plant 
trial, and the results of the trial may be used to provide a proxy for calculating emissions during normal plant 
operation. In this case, the emission rate of the by-product is related to a more easily (or accurately) measurable 
parameter, such as feedstock flow rate. The trial(s) must meet the following conditions: 
• 
There should have been no major process design, construction or operating changes that affect the plant 
upstream of the measurement point and so could render relationships between emissions and production 
invalid. (See also Box 3.14) 
• 
The relationship between emissions and plant operating rate must be established during the trial(s), together 
with its uncertainty. 
For almost all cases the rate of plant operation is a suitable proxy and the quantity of HFC-23 emitted depends 
on the current plant operating rate and the length of time that the vent flow was released.

Fij = a dimensionless factor relating the measured standard mass emission rate to the emission rate at the 
actual plant operating rate. In many cases, the fraction produced is not sensitive to operating rate and 
Fi is unity (i.e., the emission rate is proportional to operating rate). In other cases the emission rate is 
a more complex function of the operating rate. In all cases Fi should be derived during the plant trial 
by measuring HFC-23 production at different operating rates. For situations where a simple function 
relating the emissions to the operating rate cannot be determined from testing, the proxy method is 
not considered appropriate and continuous measurement is desirable.  
PORij = the current process operating rate applicable to vent stream j at plant i averaged over t in

Tier 3c 
It is a relatively simple procedure to monitor the concentration of HFC-23 in the product of a reaction system 
relative to the amount of HCFC-22. This provides a basis for estimation of the quantity of HFC-23 released as 
the mathematical product of the monitored concentration and the mass flow of HCFC-22 made. If there is no 
vent treatment to abate emissions, this is a simple procedure. However, where there is abatement then it must be 
shown that this actually treats all streams that may be released into the atmosphere, including direct gas vents 
and the outgassing of aqueous streams. The latter, especially, may not be passed to the destruction facility. If all 
potential vent streams are not treated, the method cannot be used.

The total quantity of HFC-23 released into the atmosphere is the sum of the quantities from the individual 
release periods and individual reaction systems. 
HFC-23 that is recovered for use as chemical feedstock should be subtracted from the total quantity estimated 
here. 
In summary, the Tier 1 method is relatively simple, involving the application of a default emission factor to the 
quantity of HCFC-22 produced. This method can be applied at the plant level or the national level. Tier 2 and 
Tier 3 methodologies are suitable only for plant level calculations. In cases where there are Tier 3 data available 
for some plants, the Tier 1 or Tier 2 methods can be applied to the remainder to ensure complete coverage. 
Uncertainty in the national emission is then calculated using production weighted uncertainties of the individual 
sources and standard statistical techniques. Regardless of the method, emissions abated should be subtracted 
from the gross estimate from each plant to determine net emissions before these are added together in the 
national estimate.

It is good practice to use the Tier 3 method if possible. Direct measurement is significantly more accurate than 
Tier 1 because it reflects the conditions specific to each manufacturing facility. In most cases, the data necessary 
to prepare Tier 3 estimates should be available because facilities operating to good business practice perform 
regular or periodic sampling of the final process vent or within the process itself as part of routine operations. 
For facilities using abatement techniques such as HFC-23 destruction, verification of the abatement efficiency is 
also done routinely. The Tier 1 (default) method should be used only in rare cases where plant-specific data are 
unavailable and this subcategory is not identified as significant subcategory under key category. (See Section 4.2 
of Volume 1.)

2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.99 
CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTORS 
There are several measurement options within the Tier 3 method relating to the location and frequency of the 
sampling. In general, direct measurement of the emissions of HFC-23 may provide the highest accuracy but 
continuous or frequent measurement of parameters within the production process area itself may be more 
pragmatic and can be equally accurate. In both cases, the frequency of measurement must be high enough to 
represent the variability in the process (e.g., across the life of the catalyst). Issues related to measurement 
frequency are summarised in Box 3.14, Plant Measurement Frequency. General advice on sampling and 
representativeness is provided in Volume 1, Chapter 2. 
In cases where plant-specific measurements or sampling are not available and Tier 1 methods are used, the 
default emission factor should be used, assuming no abatement methods. For plants in operation prior to 1995 
the default emission factor is 0.04 kg HFC-23/kg HCFC-22 (4 percent) (IPCC, 1996; USEPA, 2001). This is a 
default to be used when there are no measurements and describes the output of HFC-23 from a typical HCFC-22 
plant in the absence of recovery or destruction of HFC-23. The value is consistent with atmospheric observations 
of HFC-23 concentrations in the 1978-1995 time period (Oram et al.,1998). These showed globally averaged 
emissions to be equivalent to 2 percent of the total quantity of HCFC-22 produced at a time when significant 
HFC-23 was being recovered and converted into Halon 1301 (McCulloch, 1992) and abatement was required 
practice in several countries where there was significant production. 
It is possible, by process optimisation, to reduce the production to between 0.014 and 0.03 kg HFC-23/kg 
HCFC-22 (1.4 to 3 percent) but it is not possible to completely eliminate HFC-23 formation this way (IPCC, 
2000). Furthermore, the extent of the reduction is highly dependent on the process design and the economic 
environment (measures to reduce HFC-23 can often reduce the process output). In an optimised process HFC-23 
production and emissions will, invariably, have been measured; it is not possible to optimise process operation 
without such measurements and so default values have no meaning in this context for an individual plant. 
However, the state of the technological art has been advanced by optimisation of individual plants and that art 
should have been built into the design of recent plants, suggesting a default emission factor of 0.03 kg HFC-
23/kg HCFC-22 (3 percent). These default values have a large uncertainty (in the region of 50 percent). For more 
accurate assessments, the actual emissions should be determined by Tier 2 or Tier 3 methodology and, if 
necessary, assigned to previous years using the guidance provided in Chapter 7 of this volume.

BOX 3.14 
PLANT MEASUREMENT FREQUENCY 
The accuracy and precision of the estimates of annual HFC-23 emissions depend on the number of 
samples (the frequency of sample collection) together with the accuracy of measurement of 
flowrates and the extent to which discrete flow measurements can represent the total quantity 
vented. Since production processes are not completely static, the greater the process variability, the 
more frequently plants need to measure. As a general rule, sampling and analysis should be 
repeated whenever a plant makes any significant process changes. Before choosing a sampling 
frequency, the plant should set a goal for accuracy and use statistical tools to determine the sample 
size necessary to achieve the goal. For example, a study of HCFC-22 producers indicates that 
sampling once per day is sufficient to achieve an extremely accurate annual estimate. This 
accuracy goal should then be revised, if necessary, to take into account the available resources.  
(RTI, Cadmus, 1998) 
 
CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
When using the Tier 1 method, production data should be obtained directly from producers. There are several 
ways producers may determine their production levels, including shipment weights and measuring volume-
times-density, using flow meters. These data should account for all HCFC-22 production for the year, whether 
for sale or for use internally as feedstock, and the plant should describe how the HCFC-22 production rate is 
determined. In some circumstances, producers may consider plant production data to be confidential. For 
national-level activity data, submission of HCFC-22 production data is already required under the Montreal 
Protocol. 
COMPLETENESS 
It should be possible to obtain complete sampling data because there are only a small number of HCFC-22 plants 
in each country, and it is standard practice for each plant operator to monitor process efficiencies and hence 
HFC-23 losses, leading to the adoption of Tier 2 methodology. The destruction efficiencies of thermal oxidisers 
used to abate HFC-23 are generally high (>99 percent) but it is important to establish the composition of the exit 
gas in order to ensure that account is taken of emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases from this point.  
DEVELOPING A CONSISTENT TIME SERIES 
Emission of HFC-23 from HCFC-22 production should be estimated using the same method for the entire time 
series and appropriate emission factors. If data for any years in the time series are unavailable for the Tier 3 
method, these gaps should be filled according to the guidance provided in Volume 1, Chapter 5. 
3.10.1.3 
UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT 
TIER 1 
Unlike the other Tiers, where uncertainties are based on measurements and statistics, Tier 1 uncertainties are 
assessed through expert judgement and an error of approximately 50 percent could be considered for Tier 1 
based upon knowledge of the variability in emissions from different manufacturing facilities. An error of this 
magnitude will completely outweigh the uncertainty in the activity. 
TIER 2 
Uncertainty of the Tier 2 result is calculated by the root-squared sum of the individual uncertainties in 
production mass quantity and efficiencies, assuming the carbon and fluorine uncertainties are the same. Where 
the uncertainties in carbon and fluorine efficiency differ significantly (enough to cause a material difference to 
the calculated emission), the value with the lower uncertainty should be used throughout the calculation. 
Uncertainty in the value derived by Tier 2 methods is much larger than that expected from Tier 3 but is, 
nevertheless, quantifiable. Typically, for a plant producing about 4 percent HFC-23, the carbon efficiency is in 
the region of 95 percent and the fluorine efficiency 92 percent. If these efficiencies can be measured to within 1 
percent, then the error in the Tier 2 HFC-23 estimate would be less than 20 percent. Estimating efficiencies to 
this degree of accuracy will require rigorous accounting procedures and that all raw materials and product for 
sale should be weighed in or out of the facility. Such a regime sets the expected accuracy of the overall activity 
(for both Tiers 1 and 2); with good accounting and measurement of production by weight, it should be possible 
to reduce the error in the activity to below 1 percent. 
Chapter 3: Chemical Industry Emissions 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.101 
TIER 3 
For HFC-23, the Tier 3 method is significantly more accurate than either the Tier 2 measured or Tier 1 default 
methods.  Regular Tier 3 sampling of the vent stream can achieve an accuracy of 1-2 percent at a 95 percent 
confidence level in HFC-23 emissions and the uncertainty of the Tier 3 (proxy) result may be similar. In both 
cases, the uncertainty may be calculated statistically from the uncertainties of the input parameters and, because 
these methods do not rely on emission factors or activities, the concept of subdividing uncertainty has no validity.  
Uncertainty of the estimate is expressed as a coefficient of variance (percent) and, for each of these streams, 
there will be an uncertainty as a consequence of uncertainties in measured concentration and flowrate and 
uncertainty in the duration of the flow. The combined uncertainty can be determined analytically and should be 
calculated using the standard methodology described in Chapter 3 of Volume 1. 
3.10.1.4 
QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL (QA/QC), 
REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION 
QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL 
It is good practice to conduct quality control checks as outlined in Volume 1, Chapter 6, and an expert review of 
the emissions estimates. Additional quality control checks as outlined in Volume 1, Chapter 6, and quality 
assurance procedures may also be applicable, particularly if higher tier methods are used to determine emissions 
from this source category. Inventory compilers are encouraged to use higher tier QA/QC for key categories as 
identified in Volume 1, Chapter 4.  
In addition to the guidance in Volume 1, specific procedures of relevance to this sub-source category are 
outlined below: 
Comparison of emissions estimates using different approaches 
Inventory compilers should compare reported plant emissions estimates against those determined using the Tier 
1 default factor and production data. If only national production data are available, they should compare 
aggregated plant emissions to a national default estimate. If significant differences are found in the comparison, 
they should answer the following questions: 
1. Are there inaccuracies associated with any of the individual plant estimates (e.g., an extreme outlier may be 
accounting for an unreasonable quantity of emissions)? 
2. Are the plant-specific emission factors significantly different from one another? 
3. Are the plant-specific production rates consistent with published national level production rates? 
4. Is there any other explanation for a significant difference, such as the effect of controls, the manner in which 
production is reported or possibly undocumented assumptions? 
Direct emission measurement check 
• 
Inventory compilers should confirm that internationally recognised, standard methods were used for plant 
measurements. If the measurement practices fail this criterion, then the use of these emissions data should be 
carefully evaluated. It is also possible that, where a high standard of measurement and QA/QC is in place at 
sites, the uncertainty of the emissions estimates may be revised downwards.  
• 
Each plant’s QA/QC process should be evaluated to assess if the number of samples and the frequency of 
sample collection is appropriate given the variability in the process itself.  
• 
Where possible, inventory compilers should verify all measured and calculated data through comparison 
with other systems of measurement or calculation. For example, emissions measurement within the process 
itself can be verified periodically with measurement of the vent stream. Inventory compilers should verify 
abatement system utilisation and efficiency.  
• 
With a periodic external audit of the plant measurement techniques and results, it is also possible to compare 
implied emission factors across plants and account for major differences. 
 
REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION 
It is good practice to document and archive all information required to produce the national emissions inventory 
estimates as outlined in Volume 1, Section 6.11. 
Some examples of specific documentation and reporting relevant to this source category are provided below: 
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
3.102 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
• 
To provide for completely transparent reporting, emissions of HFC-23 from HCFC-22 production should be 
reported as a separate item, rather than included with other HFC emissions.  
• 
Documentation should also include: 
(i) Methodological description; 
(ii) Number of HCFC-22 plants; 
(iii) HCFC-22 production (if multiple producers); 
(iv) Presence of abatement technology; 
(v) Process descriptions, operating parameters; and  
(vi) Related emission factors. 
Confidentiality  
• 
The use of the Tiers 2 and 3 methods would mean that the plant emissions of HFC-23 are reported 
separately from the production of HCFC-22. By de-coupling the HFC-23 emissions and HCFC-22 
production, the emission data on HFC-23 cannot be considered to be of commercial confidence as it does 
not reveal the levels of production of HCFC-22 without detailed and confidential knowledge of the 
individual manufacturing facility. 
• 
The application of the Tier 1 method to total national production of HCFC-22 would enable this to be 
calculated from published emissions of HFC-23 and, if there were less than three producers, such production 
data could be considered confidential business information. In such cases, steps should be taken to protect 
confidentiality through, for example, the aggregation of all HFC emissions. For transparency reasons, 
whenever there is aggregation, a qualitative discussion of HCFC-22 production should be included. 
• 
When national emissions are calculated as the sum from individual facilities and these have been calculated 
using different methodologies, it is not possible to recalculate the HCFC-22 production from these data 
alone and there should be no problems concerning confidentiality. 
3.10.2 Emissions from production of other fluorinated 
compounds  
3.10.2.1 
INTRODUCTION 
A large number of fluorine containing greenhouse gases can be produced as by-products of fluorochemical 
manufacture and emitted into the atmosphere. For example, in a recent national inventory, significant by-product 
emissions of SF6, CF4, C2F6, C3F8, C4F10, C5F12 and C6F14 were reported for a fluorochemical plant (UNFCCC, 
2005). Other examples include the release of by-product CF4 from the production of CFC-11 and 12 or of SF6 
from the production of uranium hexafluoride in the nuclear fuel cycle.  
Emissions of a chemical occur during its production and distribution or as a by-product during the production of 
a related chemical (HFC-23 from HCFC-22 production is covered specifically in Section 3.10.1 above).  There 
may also be emissions of the material that is being produced; the so-called ‘fugitive emissions’. Both by-product 
and fugitive emissions are calculated in the same way. In this section, emissions associated with use are not 
addressed specifically, being counted in the emissions related to consumption (see Chapters 4.5, 6, 7 and 8 in 
this volume). Typically, fluorochemicals may be released from chemical processes involving a broad range of 
technologies and processes5: 
• 
Telomerization Process used in the production of fluorochemicals fluids and polymers 
• 
Photooxidation of tetrafluoroethylene to make fluorochemical fluids 
• 
Direct Fluorination often used in SF6 production 
• 
Halogen Exchange Processes to make low boiling PFCs like C2F6 and CF4, HFC 134a and 245fa 
• 
NF3 manufacturing by direct fluorination 
• 
Production of uranium hexafluoride

3.103 
• 
Production of fluorinated monomers like tetrafluoroethylene and hexafluoropropylene 
• 
Production of fluorochemical agrochemcials 
• 
Production of fluorochemical anesthetics 
Halogen exchange processes are extensively used for HFC manufacture, while most PFCs and SF6 require 
elemental fluorine, generated electrochemically. In ‘electrochemical fluorination’ processes, the fluorine is not 
separated but makes the desired product in the electrochemical cell. In other processes it is separated and 
subsequently used, either as the elemental gas or as a component of a carrier system, such as CoF3. Each process 
will have a different spectrum of emissions, in terms of both chemical nature and quantities, and so a common 
default emission function is of relatively little value. It is essential that the existence of potentially emissive 
plants is identified within each country, hence this step is first in the decision tree (Figure 3.17). The common 
factor for these plants is the use of anhydrous hydrogen fluoride, which is the source of fluorine in halogen 
exchange processes and in processes that use elemental fluorine. The production and importation of anhydrous 
hydrogen fluoride can therefore be used as a means of tracing significant producers of fluorochemicals. Further 
enquiries (see Figure 3.17) can then elucidate whether or not there are significant fluorochemical greenhouse gas 
emissions. 
3.10.2.2 
METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES 
CHOICE OF METHOD 
It is good practice to choose the method using the decision tree shown in Figure 3.17. If the Category 2B9 
Fluorochemical Production is identified as key and this subcategory is judged to be significant, inventory 
compilers should consider whether or not emissions are dominated by the production of a sub-set of chemicals, 
and focus more sophisticated data collection efforts on production of these chemicals. The number of major 
producers of these fluorinated greenhouse gases is quite small: in the case of SF6, there are globally about 6 
companies with about 10 production facilities world-wide (Preisegger, 1999). The number of smaller producers 
may grow in the near future, particularly in developing economies. However, a survey of national producers 
should not be difficult to compile. 
Tier 1 
In the Tier 1 methodology, a default emission factor, or a similar number derived for the particular country's 
circumstances, can be used to estimate national production-related emissions of individual HFCs, PFCs, SF6 and 
other fluorinated greenhouse gases.

Problems of confidentiality arising from reporting specific component data can be circumvented by providing a 
single number for total national emissions of each HFC, PFC and SF6. This may be facilitated if data are 
collected by a third party and reported only as this total. 
 
Tier 2 
The method based on process efficiencies, which works for HFC-23 emissions from HCFC-22 plants, is of less 
value for other types of plants. This is due in part to the lower inefficiency expected from these other by-product 
emissions; the uncertainty in measurement of efficiencies is likely to be much greater than the by-product 
emission factor. Furthermore, a range of by-products may be responsible for process inefficiency (unlike the case 
for HCFC-22 where one by-product predominates). However, production efficiency data should exist for each 
process and, in the absence of a more rigorous estimate, the quantity of emissions estimated from process 
inefficiencies may be used in a qualitative decision as to whether or not these emissions are a significant 
subcategory under a key category (in which case, Tier 3 methodology is specified). 
 
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
3.104 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Tier 3 
The Tier 3 methodology is potentially the most accurate estimate and is the sum of factory specific emissions of 
each by-product fluorinated greenhouse gas determined using standard methods to estimate the composition and 
flowrate of gas streams actually vented to atmosphere after any abatement technology. In this case:

or, where proxy methodology is used, for example where the emission rate of the by-product is normalised to a 
more easily (or accurately) measurable parameter, such as feedstock flow rate, as described in Equation 3.35 in 
Section 3.10.1:

in Equations 3.38 and 3.39 in Section 3.10.1 
Note that, generally, flows are measured volumetrically and should be converted into mass flow (kg/hour) based 
on the ideal gas law, temperature, pressure and composition, similarly concentration should be converted into 
compatible units (e.g., kg/kg). 
In this case, the flowrates, concentrations and duration should be calculated separately for the periods when the 
abatement technology is or is not operating and only those that lead to actual emissions should be summed and 
reported. 
 
CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTORS 
Tier 3 relies on measurements of the quantities of individual materials that are released into the atmosphere and 
neither Tier 2 nor Tier 3 relies on emission factors. For Tier 1, in the absence of abatement measures, a default 
emission factor of 0.5 percent of production, not counting losses in transport and transfer of materials, is 
suggested for HFCs and PFCs, based on data supplied to AFEAS (2004). There is a wide range of substances 
that may potentially be released. However, the AFEAS data showed that the components that were lost during 
production of a particular fluorochemical had, in general, radiative forcing properties similar to those of the 
desired fluorochemical. Consequently, for sources that are not significant subcategories under key category, 
fugitive and by-product emissions are the same and are included in the 0.5 percent emission factor.  
In the case of SF6, based on German experience, a default emission factor of 0.2 percent of the total quantity of 
SF6 produced is suggested for those countries in which the predominant end use does not require highly purified 
SF6 gas (e.g., electrical equipment, insulated windows) (Preisegger, 1999). Based on experience in Japan, in 
countries where the major uses require highly purified SF6 gas (e.g., semiconductor manufacturing), the default 
value should be 8 percent because of handling losses during disposal of residual gas (i.e., the ‘heel’ that is not 
used or recycled) in returned cylinders (Suizu, 1999). If national data are available, these should be used, 
particularly for other materials not specifically listed here. 
The default emission factors are based on situations where no abatement measures are employed. If the quantity 
of gas emitted to the atmosphere is reduced by, for example, thermal oxidation of the vent stream, the quantity 
emitted should be adjusted to account for the destruction efficiency of the oxidiser and the length of time that it 
is in service. Based on the experience in the destruction of HFC-23, a default destruction efficiency of 100 
percent is suggested but the on-line time of the destruction process will have a greater effect on emissions and 
should be recorded.

CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
Again, activity data has no role in the Tiers 3 and 2 estimates, which are based on measurements. For Tier 1, the 
activity is the annual mass of the desired fluorochemical that is produced. 
Recycling 
Recycling of used gas may be done by the producers of new gas or by other recycling firms. Emissions may 
occur during handling and purification of old gas and handling of recycled gas. Specific emission factors are not 
available. Thus, good practice is to use the same default factor as for new production. 
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
3.106 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
COMPLETENESS  
For some inventory compilers, identifying smaller producers and, in particular, recycling firms may be a difficult 
task. However, initial estimates based on the national mass balance of these fluorinated greenhouse gases should 
identify if production related emissions from such entities provide a sizeable contribution to total national 
emissions. 
DEVELOPING A CONSISTENT TIME SERIES 
Both by-product and fugitive emissions of fluorocompounds from production processes should be estimated 
using the same method for the entire time series and appropriate emission factors. If data for any years in the 
time series are unavailable for the Tier 3 method, these gaps should be filled according to the guidance provided 
in Volume 1, Chapter 5. 
3.10.2.3 
UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT 
For Tier 1, the uncertainty in activity data needs to be determined for the reporting country and statistically 
combined with the uncertainty in the default emission factor. Typically, in a well operated facility, the default 
uncertainty in activity data should be in the region of 1 percent, assuming that rigorous accounting records are 
maintained and that production is monitored by weight. The actual emission factor may range from well in 
excess of the default value to zero. The default uncertainty of the default emission factors is therefore set at 100 
percent, for example 0.5±0.5 (%). 
For Tier 3 emissions, the uncertainty of the measurements should be determined individually and combined 
(using standard statistical methods) to provide a total uncertainty for the estimate. The methodology is identical 
to that described for HFC-23 from HCFC-22. In the Tier 2 methodology, the uncertainty both of the 
measurements of efficiencies and the assignment of losses to individual compounds should be assessed. Because 
these are liable to produce a much larger uncertainty than that from Tier 3, the utility of Tier 2 is likely to be 
limited to assessing whether or not by-product fluorochemical emissions are a significant subcategory under key 
category. 
3.10.2.4 
QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL (QA/QC), 
REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION 
QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL 
It is good practice to conduct quality control checks as outlined in Volume 1, Chapter 6, and an expert review of 
the emissions estimates. Additional quality control checks as outlined in Volume 1, Chapter 6, quality assurance 
procedures may also be applicable, particularly if higher tier methods are used to determine emissions from this 
source category. Inventory compilers are encouraged to use higher tier QA/QC for key categories as identified in 
Volume 1, Chapter 4. 
Comparison of emissions estimates using different approaches 
Inventory compilers should compare the estimate based on aggregated producer-level data to an estimate based 
on national production data and the suggested default emission factors. They should investigate significant 
discrepancies in cooperation with the producers to determine if there are unexplained differences. 
REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION 
Confidentiality issues may arise where there are limited numbers of manufacturers. In these cases more 
aggregate reporting of total national emissions may be necessary. If survey responses cannot be released as 
public information, third-party review of survey data may be necessary to support data verification efforts.  
It is good practice to document and archive all information required to produce the national emissions inventory 
estimates as outlined in Volume 1, Section 6.11. It is not practical to include all documentation in the national 
inventory report. However, the inventory should include summaries of methods used and references to source 
data such that the reported emissions estimates are transparent and steps in their calculation may be retraced.
