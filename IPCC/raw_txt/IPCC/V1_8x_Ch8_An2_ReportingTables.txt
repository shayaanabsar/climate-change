(1) Although peat is not strictly speaking a fossil fuel, the CO2 emissions from combustion of peat are included in the national emissions as for fossil fuels. See Chapter 1 of Energy Volume, page 1.15.   
(2)  Information items that are not themselves emissions, therefore not included in the national total. The carbon should be converted to carbon dioxide. It is subtracted in the CO2 emission columns (net 
emissions). Only CO2 captured for permanent storage in geological reservoirs should be subtracted. 
(3) Enter the amount of CO2 captured as a negative number since this amount is subtracted from total CO2 produced.

(1)  The other halogenated gases for which the CO2 equivalent conversion factor is not available should not be included in this 
column. Such gases should be reported in the column “Other halogenated gases without CO2 equivalent conversion 
factors”. 
(2)  When this column is used, gases should be listed separately (in IPPU background tables and Table 2.11) and the name of 
the gas should be given in the documentation box. Insert additional columns if necessary.  
(3)  Insert additional rows if needed  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(4)  The "Other halogenated gases" are fluorinated alcohols, fluorinated ethers, NF3, SF5CF3. 
 
 
 
 
 
(5)  Small amounts of CO2 used as a diluent for SF6 and emitted during magnesium processing is considered insignificant and 
is usually counted elsewhere. The "Other halogenated gases" here mainly comprise fluorinated ketones. 
 
(6)  Emissions from feedstock uses in petrochemical industry should be addressed in 2B8 (Petrochemical and Carbon Black 
Production). Emissions from some product uses should be allocated to each industry source category (e.g., CO2 from 
carbon anodes and electrodes � 2C (Metal Industry)). 
(7)  Only NMVOC emissions and no direct GHGs are relevant to this category. 
(8)  Emissions from asphalt production, and paving of roads and roofing are included here.  
(9)  "Other halogenated gases" are NF3, c-C4F8O, etc. 
(10) The "Other halogenated gases" here include C4F9OC2H5 (HFE-7200), CHF2OCF2OC2F4OCHF2 (H-Galden 1040x), 
CHF2OCF2OCHF2 (HG-10), etc. 
 
 
*  Cells to report emissions of NOx, CO, NMVOC and SO2 have not been shaded although the physical potential for emissions is 
lacking for some categories.

(1)  
The columns ‘Primary NEU fuel’ and ‘Other NEU fuel’ should be completed with the actual fuel types used. 
 
(2)  
These are the same emissions reported in the sectoral background table (also the same emissions notation keys NE, NO, IE, where applicable). If (partly) reported 
elsewhere, a reference to that other source category should be added in the next column. 
(3)  
Report here only the CO2 emissions from combustion of waste gases produced from industrial processes but used for fuel combustion in other economic sectors and 
reported in the Energy sector.(e.g. from combustion of blast furnace gas or chemical off-gases transferred offsite to another source category). 
(4)  
For example powdered anthracite coal may be used in Glass Production (2A3). 
(5)  
In cases where the production of off-gases (i.e. byproduct gases) is fully accounted for in the energy statistics, the combustion of these gases may be used to 
calculate and report CO2 emissions from the feedstock losses. Part of these off-gases may be combusted off-site (i.e. in a sector other than the petrochemical 
industry) and should thus be accounted for separately as fuel combustion in the Energy Sector.  
(6)  
Part of the blast furnace gas produced from coke used in blast furnaces may be combusted off-site (i.e. in a sector other than the iron and steel industry) and should 
thus be accounted for separately as fuel combustion in the Energy Sector. 
 
(7)  
Carbon electrodes are generally manufactured from coke, coal or tar either on-site by the users themselves or separately by anode production plants and then sold 
to users domestically and/or exported. If anodes are also imported and/or exported, there is no direct correspondence between fuels used for anode production and 
the amounts of anodes used in the country. 
(8)  
Mineral turpentines are often used as solvent, possibly blended with other liquids. Aromatics derived from coal oils may also be used as solvents. 
(9)  
Emissions from asphalt production, paving of roads and roofing should be reported under 2D4. However, bitumen - and other oil as diluent or 'road oil' - used for this 
activity does not result in CO2 emissions. 
(10)  CO2 from blast furnace gas and chemical off-gases should be reported here only when utilised in public power or heat production.

(1)  Where the carbon contained in the emissions of CH4 and CO is significant part of the sectoral emissions, this should be copied from the corresponding columns in the Sectoral Background Table 3.4. 
This amount of carbon emitted as CH4 and CO is then subtracted from carbon stock change to avoid double counting (see Volume 4, Section 2.2.3).   
(2)  The activity data used for this column correspond to the difference between the column Area and the Area of organic soils. 
(3)  CO2 Emissions from Wetlands are reported in a separate background table (Table 3.3) that includes all gases emitted from Wetlands.

(1)   Parties should report both Controlled/Prescribed Burning and Wildfires emissions, where appropriate, in a separate manner. 
(2)   For each land type data should be selected between area burned or biomass burned.  Units for area will be in hectare (ha) and for biomass burned in kilogram dry matter (kg dm).   
(3)   If CO2 emissions from biomass burning are not already included in Table 3.2 (Carbon stock changes background table), they should be reported here. Carbon stock changes associated with biomass 
burning should not also be reported in Table 3.2 to avoid double counting. 
(4)
   CH4 and CO emissions from biomass burning and DOM are reported separately. 
(5)  Where the carbon contained in the emissions of CH4 and CO is a significant part of the sectoral emissions this should be transferred to the corresponding columns in the Sectoral Background Table 
3.2. This amount of carbon emitted as CH4 and CO is then subtracted from carbon stock change to avoid double counting. The conversion factors to convert CH4 and CO to C (as input to Table 3.2) 
are 12/16 for CH4 and 12/28 for CO. (see Volume 4, Section 2.2.3).

    A country may report aggregate estimates for total lime applications when data are not available for limestone and dolomite.

(2)  Waste burned for energy is reported in the Energy Sector under 1A. Information on reporting of waste combustion in the Energy Sector should be given in the documentation box. 
(3)  Activity data for estimation of CH4 emissions is total amount of organically degradable material in the wastewater (TOW)  [Gg BOD/yr or Gg COD/yr]. 
(4)  Activity data for estimation of N2O emissions is total amount of nitrogen in effluent  [Gg N/yr].
