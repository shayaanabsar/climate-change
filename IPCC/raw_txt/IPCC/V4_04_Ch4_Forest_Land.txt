4 FOREST LAND 
4.1 
INTRODUCTION 
This chapter provides methods for estimating greenhouse gas emissions and removals due to changes in biomass, 
dead organic matter and soil organic carbon on Forest Land and Land Converted to Forest Land. It builds on the 
Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (1996 IPCC Guidelines) and the Good 
Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (GPG-LULUCF). The chapter: 
• 
addresses all five carbon pools identified in Chapter 1 and transfers of carbon between different pools within 
the same land areas; 
• 
includes carbon stock changes on managed forests due to human activities such as establishing and 
harvesting plantations, commercial felling, fuelwood gathering and other management practices, in addition 
to natural losses caused by fire, windstorms, insects, diseases, and other disturbances; 
• 
provides simple (Tier 1) methods and default values and outline approaches for higher tier methods for the 
estimation of carbon  stock changes; 
• 
provides methods to estimate non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions from biomass burning (other non-CO2 
emissions such as N2O emissions from soils are covered in Chapter 11); 
• 
should be used together with generic description of methods and equations from Chapter 2, and the 
approaches for obtaining consistent area data described in Chapter 3. 
The Guidelines provide methods for estimating and reporting sources and sinks of greenhouse gases only for 
managed forests, as defined in Chapter 1. Countries should consistently apply national definitions of managed 
forests over time. National definitions should cover all forests subject to human intervention, including the full 
range of management practices from protecting forests, raising plantations, promoting natural regeneration, 
commercial timber production, non-commercial fuelwood extraction, and abandonment of managed land. 
This chapter does not include harvested wood products (HWP) which are covered by Chapter 12 of this Volume. 
Managed Forest Land is partitioned into two sub categories and the guidance and methodologies are given 
separately in two sections: 
• 
Section 4.2 Forest Land Remaining Forest Land  
• 
Section 4.3 Land Converted to Forest Land  
Section 4.2 covers the methodology that applies to lands that have been Forest Land for more than the transition 
period required to reach new soil carbon levels (default is 20 years). Section 4.3 applies to lands converted to 
Forest Land within that transition period. The 20-year interval is taken as a default length of transition period for 
carbon stock changes following land-use change. It is good practice to differentiate national forest lands by the 
above two categories. The actual length of transition period depends on natural and ecological circumstances of a 
particular country or region and may differ from 20 years.  
Unmanaged forests, which are brought under management, enter the inventory and should be included in the 
Land Converted to Forest Land. Unmanaged forests which are converted to other land uses enter the inventory 
under their post conversion land-use categories with the appropriate transition period for the new land-use 
category.  
If there are no data on land conversion and the period involved are available, the default assumption is that all 
managed forest land belongs to the category Forest Land Remaining Forest Land and greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions and removals are estimated using guidance given in Section 4.2.  
Relevant carbon pools and non-CO2 gases 
The relevant carbon pools and non-CO2 gases for which methods are provided are given below: 
• 
Biomass (above-ground and below-ground biomass) 
• 
Dead organic matter (dead wood and litter) 
• 
Soil organic matter 
• 
Non-CO2 gases (CH4, CO, N2O, NOX) 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
4.8 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
The selection of carbon pools or non-CO2 gases for estimation will depend on the significance of the pool and 
tier selected for each land-use category. 
Forest land-use classification 
Greenhouse gas emissions and removals per hectare vary according to site factors, forest or plantation types, 
stages of stand development and management practices. It is good practice to stratify Forest Land into various 
sub categories to reduce the variation in growth rate and other forest parameters and to reduce uncertainty (Box 
4.1). As a default, the Guidelines use the most recent ecological zone (see Table 4.1 in Section 4.5 and Figure 
4.1 in this chapter) and forest cover (see Table 4.2 in Section 4.5 and Figure 4.2 in this chapter) classifications, 
developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO, 2001). National experts should use more detailed 
classifications for their countries, if available and suitable, given the other data requirements.  
 
BOX 4.1 
LEVELS OF DETAIL 
Stratification of forest types into homogeneous sub-categories, and if possible at regional or sub-
regional level within a country, reduces the uncertainty of estimates of greenhouse gas emissions 
and removals. For simplicity and clarity, this chapter discusses estimation of emissions and 
removals at national level and for a relatively small number of subcategories of Forest Land.  This 
level of detail is designed to match the available sources of default input data, carbon contents and 
other assumptions.  It is important, however, for users of these Guidelines to understand that they 
are encouraged to carry out the greenhouse gas emissions inventory calculations at a finer level of 
detail, if possible.  Many countries have more detailed information available about forests and 
land-use change than were used in constructing default values in this Chapter. These data should 
be used, if suitable, for the following reasons: 
1.  Geographic detail at regional rather than national level 
Experts may find that greenhouse gas estimation for various regions within a country are necessary 
to capture important geographic variations in ecosystem types, biomass densities, fractions of 
cleared biomass which are burnt, etc. 
2.  Finer detail by subcategory 
Experts may subdivide the recommended land-use categories and subcategories to reflect 
important differences in climate, ecology or species, forest types, land-use or forestry practices, 
fuelwood gathering patterns, etc.   
In all cases, working at finer levels of disaggregation does not change the basic nature of the 
method of estimations, although additional data and assumptions will generally be required beyond 
the defaults provided in this Chapter.  Once greenhouse gas emissions are estimated, using the 
most appropriate level of detail determined by the national experts, results should also be 
aggregated up to the national level and the standard categories requested in these Guidelines.  This 
will allow for comparability of results among all participating countries. Generally, the data and 
assumptions used for finer levels of detail should also be reported to ensure transparency and 
repeatability of methods.   
 
Terminology  
The terminology used in the methods for estimating biomass stocks and changes need to be consistent with the 
terminologies and definitions used by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). FAO is the main source of 
activity data and emission factors for forest and other land-use categories in Tier 1 level calculations. Examples 
of terminology from FAO are: biomass growth, mean annual increment, biomass loss, and wood-removal. The 
Glossary in Annex 4A.1 includes definitions of these terminologies.

FOREST LAND REMAINING FOREST LAND 
This section deals with managed forests that have been under Forest Land for over 20 years (default), or for over 
a country-specific transition period. Greenhouse gas inventory for Forest Land Remaining Forest Land (FF) 
involves estimation of changes in carbon stock from five carbon pools (i.e., above-ground biomass, below-
ground biomass, dead wood, litter, and soil organic matter), as well as emissions of non-CO2 gases. Methods for 
estimating greenhouse gas emissions and removals for lands converted to Forest Land in the past 20 years (e.g., 
from Cropland and Grassland) are presented in Section 4.3. The set of general equations to estimate the annual 
carbon stock changes on Forest Land are given in Chapter 2.   
4.2.1 
Biomass  
This section presents methods for estimating biomass gains and losses. Gains include total (above-ground and 
below-ground) biomass growth. Losses are roundwood removal/harvest, fuelwood removal/harvest/gathering, 
and losses from disturbances by fire, insects, diseases, and other disturbances. When such losses occur, below-
ground biomass is also reduced and transformed to dead organic matter (DOM). 
4.2.1.1 
CHOICE OF METHOD 
Chapter 2 describes two methods, namely, Gain-Loss Method based on estimates of annual change in biomass 
from estimates of biomass gain and loss (Equation 2.7) and a Stock-Difference Method which estimates the 
difference in total biomass carbon stock at time t2 and time t1 (Equation 2.8). 
The biomass gain-loss method is applicable for all tiers although the stock-difference method is more suited to 
Tiers 2 and 3. This is because, in general, the stock-difference method will provide more reliable estimates for 
relatively large increases or decreases of biomass or where very accurate forest inventories are carried out. For 
areas with a mix of stands of different forest types, and/or where biomass change is very small compared to the 
total amount of biomass, the inventory error under the stock-difference method may be larger than the expected 
change. Unless periodic inventories give estimates on stocks of dead organic matter, in addition to growing stock, 
one should be aware that other data on mortality and losses will still be required for estimating the transfer to 
dead organic matter, harvested wood products and emissions caused by disturbances. Subsequent inventories 
must also allow identical area coverage in order to get reliable results when using the stock-difference method. 
The choice of using gain-loss or stock-difference method at the appropriate tier level will therefore be a matter of 
expert judgment, taking into account the national inventory systems, availability of data and information from 
ecological surveys, forest ownership patterns, activity data, conversion and expansion factors as well as cost-
benefit analysis.  
The decision tree as shown in Figure 1.2 in Chapter 1 should be used to guide choice between the Tiers. This 
promotes efficient use of available resources, taking into account whether the biomass of this category is a 
significant carbon pool or a key category as described in Volume 1, Chapter 4. 
Tier-1 Method (Biomass Gain-Loss Method) 
Tier 1 is feasible even when country-specific estimates of activity data and emission/removal factors are not 
available, and works when changes of the carbon pool in biomass on Forest Land Remaining Forest Land are 
relatively small. The method requires the biomass carbon loss to be subtracted from the biomass carbon gain 
(Equation 2.7). The annual change in carbon stocks in biomass can be estimated using the gain-loss method, 
where the annual increase in carbon stocks due to biomass growth and annual decrease in carbon stocks due to 
biomass losses are estimated: 
• 
The annual increase in biomass carbon stock is estimated using Equation 2.9, where area under each forest 
sub-category is multiplied by mean annual increment in tonnes of dry matter per hectare per year. 
• 
Since the biomass growth is usually in terms of merchantable volume or above-ground biomass, the below-
ground biomass is estimated with a below-ground biomass to above-ground biomass ratio (Equation 2.10). 
Alternatively, merchantable volume (m3) can be converted directly to total biomass using biomass 
conversion and expansion factors (BCEFI ), (Equation 2.10).  
• 
If BCEFI  values are not available and if the biomass expansion factor (BEF) and basic wood density (D) 
values are separately estimated, then the following conversion can be used: 
BCEFI  = BEFI  ●  D 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
4.12 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Biomass Expansion Factors (BEFI) expand merchantable volume to total aboveground biomass 
volume to account for non-merchantable components of the tree, stand and forest. BEFI is 
dimensionless. 
• 
The average above-ground biomass of forest areas affected by disturbances are given in Tables 4.7 and 4.8; 
net average annual above-ground biomass growth values are provided in Tables 4.9, 4.10, and 4.12; net 
volume annual increment values are provided in Tables 4.11A and 4.11B; wood density is given in Tables 
4.13 and 4.14; and below-ground biomass to above-ground biomass ratios (R) are given in Table 4.4. Refer 
to Box 4.2 for detailed explanation on how to convert and expand volumes of growing stock, increment and 
wood removals to biomass. 
• 
In some ecosystems, basic wood density (D) can influence spatial patterns of forest biomass (Baker et al., 
2004b). Tier 1 users who do not have measurements of wood density at the desired sub-strata level can 
estimate wood density by estimating the proportion of total forest biomass contributed by the 2-3 dominant 
species and using species-specific wood density values (Tables 4.13 and 4.14) to calculate a weighted 
average wood density value. 
• 
Annual biomass loss or decrease in biomass carbon stocks is estimated using Equation 2.11, which requires 
estimates of annual carbon loss due to wood removals (Equation 2.12), fuelwood removal (Equation 2.13) 
and disturbances (Equation 2.14). Transfer of biomass to dead organic matter is estimated using Equation 
2.20, based on estimates of annual biomass carbon lost due to mortality (Equation 2.21), annual carbon 
transfer to slash (Equation 2.22).   
• 
Biomass estimates are converted to carbon values using carbon fraction of dry matter (Table 4.3). 
When either the biomass stock or its change in a category (or sub-category) is significant or a key category, it is 
good practice to select a higher tier methodology for estimation. The choice of Tier 2 or 3 method depends on 
the types and accuracy of data and models available, level of spatial disaggregation of activity data and national 
circumstances. 
If using activity data collected via Approach 1 (see Chapter 3), and it is not possible to use supplementary data to 
identify the amount of land converted from and to Forest Land, the inventory compiler should estimate C stocks 
in biomass on all Forest Land using the Tier 1 method described above for Forest Land Remaining Forest Land.  
Tier 2 
Tier 2 can be used in countries where country-specific estimates of activity data and emission/removal factors 
are available or can be gathered at reasonable cost. Tier 2, same as Tier 1, uses Equations 2.7 to 2.14 (excluding 
Equation 2.8).  Species-specific wood density values (Tables 4.13 and 4.14) permit the calculation of biomass 
from species-specific forest inventory data. It is possible to use the stock-difference method (Equation 2.8) at 
Tier 2 where the necessary country-specific data are available 
Tier 3 
Tier 3 approach for biomass carbon stock change estimation allows for a variety of methods, including process-
based models. Implementation may differ from one country to another, due to differences in inventory methods, 
forest conditions and activity data. Transparent documentation of the validity and completeness of the data, 
assumptions, equations and models used is therefore a critical issue at Tier 3. Tier 3 requires use of detailed 
national forest inventories when the stock-difference method is used (Equation 2.8). They may be supplemented 
by allometric equations and models (for example, Chambers et al. (2001) and Baker et al. (2004a) for the 
Amazon; Jenkins et al. (2004) and Kurz and Apps (2006) for North America; and Zianis et al. (2005) for 
Europe), calibrated to national circumstances that allow for direct estimation of biomass growth.

BOX 4.2 
BIOMASS CONVERSION AND EXPANSION FACTORS FOR ASSESSING BIOMASS AND CARBON IN FORESTS1 
Forest inventories and operational records usually document growing stock, net annual increment 
or wood removals in m3 of merchantable volume. This excludes non-merchantable above-ground 
components such as tree tops, branches, twigs, foliage, sometimes stumps, and below-ground 
components (roots).  
Assessments of biomass and carbon stocks and changes, on the other hand, focus on total biomass, 
biomass growth and biomass removals (harvest), including non-merchantable components, 
expressed in tons of dry-weight. Several methods may be used to derive forest biomass and its 
changes. Above-ground biomass and changes can be derived in two ways, namely: 
(i) directly by measuring sample tree attributes in the field, such as diameters and heights, and 
applying, species-specific allometric equations or biomass tables based on these equations once or 
periodically. 
(ii) indirectly by transforming available volume data from forest inventories, e.g., merchantable 
volume of growing stock, net annual increment or wood removals (Somogyi et al., 2006).  
The latter approach may achieve the transformation by applying biomass regression functions, 
which usually express biomass of species or species groups (t/ha) or its rate of change, directly as a 
function of growing stock density (m3/ha), and age, eco-regions or other variables (Pan et al., 
2004). 
More commonly than these biomass regression functions, a single, discrete transformation factors2 
is applied to merchantable volume to derive above-ground biomass and its changes:  
(i) Biomass Expansion Factors (BEF) expand the dry weight3 of the merchantable volume of 
growing stock, net annual increment, or wood removals, to account for non-merchantable 
components of the tree, stand, and forest. Before applying such BEFs, merchantable volume (m3) 
must be converted to dry-weight (tonne) by multiplying with a conversion factor known as basic 
wood density (D) in (t/m3). BEFs are dimensionless since they convert between units of weight. 
This method gives best results, when the BEFs have actually been determined based on dry 
weights, and when locally applicable basic wood densities are well known. 
(ii) Biomass Conversion and Expansion Factors (BCEF) combine conversion and expansion. 
They have the dimension (t/m3) and transform in one single multiplication growing stock, net 
annual increment, or wood removals (m3) directly into above-ground biomass, above-ground 
biomass growth, or biomass removals (t). 
BCEFs are more convenient. They can be applied directly to volume-based forest inventory data 
and operational records without the need of having to resort to basic wood densities. They provide 
best results, when they have been derived locally, based directly on merchantable volume. 
Mathematically, BCEF and BEF are related by:  
BCEF = BEF ● D 
Application of this equation requires caution because basic wood density and biomass expansion 
factors tend to be correlated. If the same sample of trees was used to determine D, BEF or BCEF, 
conversion will not introduce error. If, however, basic wood density is not known with certainty, 
transforming one into the other might introduce error, as BCEF implies a specific but unknown 
basic wood density. Ideally, all conversion and expansion factors would be derived or their 
applicability checked locally. 
                                                           
1 Please see glossary (Annex 4A.1) for definitions of terms. 
2 While these transformation factors are usually applied in discrete form, they can also be expressed and depicted as 
continuous functions of growing stock density, age, or other variables.     
3 In some applications, biomass expansion factors expand dry-weight of merchantable components to total biomass, 
including roots, or expand merchantable volume to above-ground or total biomass volume (Somogyi et al., 2006). As used 
in this document, biomass expansion factors always transform dry-weight of merchantable volume including bark to 
above-ground biomass, excluding roots.  
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
4.14 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Both BEF and BCEF tend to decrease as a function of stand age, as growing stock density (volume 
of growing stock per ha) increases. This is because of the increasing ratio of merchantable volume 
to total volume. The decrease is rapid at low growing stock densities or for young stands and levels 
out for older stands and higher stand densities.  
The GPG-LULUCF provided only average default BEF values, together with wide ranges, and 
general guidance on how to select applicable values for specific countries from these ranges.  To 
facilitate selection of more reliable default values, this document provides default factors as a 
function of growing stock density in Table 4.5.  Since more comprehensive and more recent data 
were found in the literature, Table 4.5 contains BCEF defaults only. Countries that possess 
country-specific basic wood densities and BEF on a consistent basis may apply them to calculate 
country-specific BCEF using the formula given above.    
BCEF or BEF that apply to growing stock and net annual increment are different. In this 
document, the following symbols are used: 
BCEFS: biomass conversion and expansion factor applicable to growing stock; transforms 
merchantable volume of growing stock into above-ground biomass. 
BCEFI: biomass conversion and expansion factor applicable to net annual increment; transforms 
merchantable volume of net annual increment into above-ground biomass growth.  
   BCEFR: biomass conversion and expansion factors applicable to wood removals; transforms 
merchantable biomass to total biomass (including bark). BCEFR and BEFR for wood and fuelwood 
removal will be larger than that for growing stock due to harvest loss (see Annex 4A.1 Glossary). 
If a country specific value for harvest loss is not known, defaults are 10% for hardwoods and 8% 
for conifers (Kramer and Akca, 1982). Default conversion and expansion factors for wood 
removals can be derived by dividing BCEFS by (1– 0.08) for conifers and (1-0.1) for broadleaves.   
It is good practice to estimate growing stock biomass, above-ground biomass growth and above-
ground biomass removals by strata; to document these strata; and to aggregate results ex post. 
Methods described above will yield above-ground biomass and its changes. Results must be 
expanded to total biomass via applicable below-ground biomass to above-ground biomass ratios.  
 
4.2.1.2 
CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTORS  
The Gain-Loss Method requires the above-ground biomass growth, biomass conversion and expansion factor 
(BCEF), BEF, and/or basic wood densities according to each forest type and climatic zone in the country, plus 
emission factors related to biomass loss, including losses due to wood removals, fuelwood removals and 
disturbances.  
Annual biomass carbon gain, ΔCG  
Mean above-ground biomass growth (increment), G W  
Tier 1 
Default values of the above-ground biomass growth (GW) which are provided in Tables 4.9, 4.10 and 4.12 can be 
used at Tier 1.  If available, it is good practice to use other regional default values for different forest types more 
relevant to the country. 
Tier 2 
Tier 2 method uses more country-specific data to calculate the above-ground biomass growth, GW from country-
specific net annual increment of growing stock (IV).  Tables 4.11a and 4.11b provide default values for IV. 
Combined default biomass conversion and expansion factor (BCEFI) of Iv are provided in Table 4.5. Separate 
data on biomass expansion factor for increment (BEFI) and basic wood density (D) can also be used to convert 
the available data to GW. Tables 4.13 and 4.14 provide default values for basic wood density.  
Tier 3 
Under Tier 3, process-based estimation will have access to detailed forest inventory or monitoring system with 
data on growing stock and past and projected net annual increment and functions relating to growing stock or net 
annual increment directly to biomass and biomass growth. It is also possible to derive net annual increment by 
process simulation. Specific carbon fraction and basic wood density should also be incorporated. 
Forest inventories usually provide conditions of forest growing stock and net annual increment in the year of the 
inventory. When the year of inventory does not coincide with the year of reporting, interpolated or extrapolated 
Chapter 4: Forest Land 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.15 
net annual increment or increment estimated by models (i.e., model capable of simulating forest dynamics), 
should be used along with data on harvesting and disturbances to update inventory data  to the year of interest. 
Below-ground biomass growth (increment) 
Tier 1 
Below-ground carbon stock changes, as a default assumption consistent with the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, can be 
zero. Alternatively, default values for below-ground biomass to above-ground biomass ratios (R) are to be used 
to estimate below-ground biomass growth. Default values are provided in Table 4.4. Strictly, these ratios of 
below-ground biomass to above-ground biomass are only valid for stocks, but no appreciable error is likely to 
obtain if they are applied to above-ground biomass growth over short periods.  
Tier 2 
Country-specific below-ground biomass to above-ground biomass ratios should be used to estimate below-
ground biomass for different forest types.  
Tier 3 
For preference, below-ground biomass should be directly incorporated in models for calculating total biomass 
increment and losses. Alternatively, nationally or regionally determined below-ground biomass to above-ground 
biomass ratios or regression models (e.g., Li et al., 2003) may be used. 
Annual carbon loss in biomass, ΔCL  
Biomass loss due to wood removals, L w o o d- r em ov al s and L f ue l wo o d 
When computing carbon loss through biomass removals, the following factors are needed: Wood removal (H), 
fuelwood removal as trees or parts of trees (FG), basic wood density (D), below-ground biomass to above-
ground biomass ratio (R), carbon fraction (CF), BCEF for wood removals. While all wood removals represent a 
loss for the forest biomass pool, Chapter 12 provides guidance for estimating annual change in carbon stocks in 
harvested wood products. 
Disturbances, L d i st u r b a nc e 
The estimate of other losses of carbon requires data on areas affected by disturbances (Adisturbance) and the 
biomass of these forest areas (BW). Above ground biomass estimates of forest types affected by disturbance are 
required, along with below-ground biomass to above-ground biomass ratio and fraction of biomass lost in 
disturbance.  
Chapter 2, Tables 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6 provide fuel biomass consumption values, emission factors, and combustion 
factors needed for estimating proportion of biomass lost in fires and proportion to be transferred to dead organic 
matter under higher tiers.   
Tier 1 
The average biomass varies with the forest types and management practices. The default values are given in 
Tables 4.7 and 4.8. In the case of fire, both CO2 and non-CO2 emissions occur from combusted fuels of above-
ground biomass including understory. Fire may consume a high proportion of understory vegetation. In the case 
of other disturbances, a fraction of above ground biomass is transferred to dead organic matter and under Tier 1, 
all biomass in area subjected to disturbance is assumed to be emitted in the year of disturbance.   
Tier 2 
Under Tier 2, biomass changes due to disturbances will be taken into account by forest category, type of 
disturbance and intensity. Average values for biomass are obtained from country-specific data. 
Tier 3 
In addition to calculating losses similar to Tier 2, Tier 3 can also adopt models, which typically employ spatially 
referenced or spatially explicit information on the year and type of disturbance.  
4.2.1.3 
CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
Area of managed Forest Land 
All tiers require information on areas of managed Forest Land according to different forest types, climate, 
management systems, and regions. 
Tier 1 
Tier 1 uses data of forest area which can be obtained through national statistics, from forest agencies (which may 
have information on areas of different management practices), conservation agencies (especially for areas 
managed for natural regeneration), municipalities, survey and mapping agencies. Cross-checks should be made 
to ensure complete and consistent representation for avoiding omissions or double counting as specified in 
Chapter 3. If no country data are available, aggregate information can be obtained from international data 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
4.16 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
sources (FAO, 1995; FAO, 2001; TBFRA, 2000). It is good practice to verify, validate, and update the FAO data 
using national sources. 
Tier 2 
Tier 2 uses country-defined national data sets, according to different forest types, climate, management systems, 
and regions, with a resolution sufficient to ensure appropriate representation of land areas in line with provisions 
of Chapter 3 of this volume. Approach 2 of Chapter 3 is relevant for Tier 2. 
Tier 3 
Tier 3 uses country-specific data on managed Forest Land from different sources, notably national forest 
inventories, registers of land use and land-use changes, or remote sensing. These data should give a full 
accounting of all land-use transitions to Forest Land and disaggregate along climate, soil, and vegetation types. 
Geo-referenced area under different forest types may be used to track changes in area under different land-use 
types, using Approach 3 of Chapter 3. 
Wood removals 
The inventory requires data on wood removals, including fuelwood removals and biomass losses due to 
disturbances, in order to calculate biomass stock changes and carbon pool transfers. In addition to wood 
removals for industrial purposes, there may also be wood removals for small scale processing or direct sales to 
consumers from land owners. This quantity may not be included in official statistics and may need to be 
estimated by survey. Fuelwood from branches and tops of felled trees must be subtracted from transfers to the 
dead wood pool. Salvage of wood from areas affected by disturbances must also be subtracted from biomass, to 
ensure that no double counting occurs in Tier 1 inventories in which the biomass in areas affected by 
disturbances is already assumed released to the atmosphere.   
In using production statistics, users must pay careful attention to the units involved. It is important to check 
whether the information in the original data is reported in biomass, volumes underbark or overbark to ensure that 
expansion factors are used only where appropriate and in a consistent way.  
Unless restricted to Approach 1 land representation without supplementary data, so that all forest land is counted 
under Forest Land Remaining Forest Land, wood removals from Forest Land being converted to another land 
use should not be included in losses reported for Forest Land Remaining Forest Land since these losses are 
reported in the new land-use category. If the statistics on wood removals do not provide stratification on lands, 
then an amount of biomass approximating the biomass loss from lands converted from Forest Land should be 
subtracted from the total wood removals. 
Extraction of roundwood is published in the UNECE/FAO Timber Bulletin and by FAO Yearbook of Forest 
Products. The latter is based primarily on data provided by the countries. In the absence of official data, FAO 
provides an estimate based on the best information available. Usually, the FAO yearbook appears with a two-
year time lag. 
Tier 1 
FAO data can be used as a Tier 1 default for H in Equation 2.12 in Chapter 2. The roundwood data include all 
wood removed from forests which are reported in cubic meters underbark. The underbark data need conversion 
to overbark before using BCEFR. Conversion from underbark to overbark volumes is done by using bark 
percentages. 
Tier 2 
Country-specific data should be used.  
Tier 3 
Country-specific wood removals data from different forest categories should be used at the spatial resolution 
chosen for reporting  
Fuelwood removal 
Estimation of carbon losses due to fuelwood removal requires annual volume of fuelwood removed (FG) and 
basic wood density (D).  Fuelwood is produced in different ways in countries and varies from ordinary timber 
harvesting, to using parts of trees, to gathering of dead wood. Fuelwood constitutes the largest component of 
biomass loss for many countries, thus reliable estimates are needed for such countries. . If possible, fuelwood 
removal from Forest Land Remaining Forest Land and that coming from Forest Land conversion to other uses 
should be separated.  
Tier 1 
FAO provides statistics on fuelwood and charcoal removals for all countries. FAO statistics are based on what is 
provided by the concerned ministries/ departments in the countries and in some cases may not account fully for 
the entire fuelwood and charcoal removal due to the limitations of national data collection and reporting systems. 
Thus, under Tier 1, FAO statistics can be used directly but should be checked for completeness by the national 
Chapter 4: Forest Land 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.17 
source of data for the FAO such as the Ministry of Forests or Agriculture or any statistical organization. FAO or 
any national estimates should be supplemented from regional surveys or local studies on fuelwood consumption, 
since fuelwood is collected from multiple sources; forests, timber processing residues, farms, homesteads, 
village commons, etc.  If more complete information is available nationally, it should be used. 
Tier 2 
Country-specific data should be used, if available. Regional surveys of fuelwood removals can be used to verify 
and supplement the national or FAO data source. At the national level, aggregate fuelwood removals can be 
estimated by conducting regional level surveys of rural and urban households at different income levels, 
industries and establishments.  
Tier 3 
Fuelwood removals data from national level studies should be used at the resolution required for the Tier 3 
model, including the non-commercial fuelwood removals. Fuelwood removal should be linked to forest types 
and regions.  
Different methods of fuelwood removal from Forest Land Remaining Forest Land should be accounted at 
regional or disaggregated level through surveys. The source of fuelwood should be identified to ensure that no 
double counting occurs.  
Disturbances 
A database on rate and impact of natural disturbances by type, for all European countries (Schelhaas et al., 2001), 
can be found at: http://www.efi.fi/ 
A UNEP database on global burnt area can be found at: http://www.grid.unep.ch/ 
However, one should note that the UNEP database is only valid for year 2000. In many countries inter-annual 
variability in burnt area is large, so these figures will not provide a representative average. Many countries 
maintain their own disturbance statistics e.g., Stocks et al. (2002) which can be employed in Tier 2 or Tier 3 
approaches (Kurz and Apps, 2006).  
The FRA2005 (FAO, 2005) should also be examined for data on disturbances. 
4.2.1.4 
CALCULATION STEPS FOR TIER 1 
The following summarizes steps for estimating change in carbon stocks in biomass (∆C B) 
using the default methods: 
 
Step 1:  Using guidance from Chapter 3 (approaches in representing land areas), categorise the area (A) of 
Forest Land Remaining Forest Land into forest types of different climatic or ecological zones, as adopted by the 
country. As a point of reference, Annex 3A.1 of GPG-LULUCF (IPCC, 2003) provides national-level data of 
forest area and annual change in forest area by region and by country as a means of comparison. Alternatively 
FAO also periodically provides area data; 
Step 2: Estimate the annual biomass gain in Forest Land Remaining Forest Land (∆CG) using estimates of area 
and biomass growth, for each forest type and climatic zone in the country available using Equations 2.9 and 2.10 
in Chapter 2;   
Step 3: Estimate the annual carbon loss due to wood removals (Lwood-removals) using Equation 2.12 in Chapter 2;  
Step 4: Estimate annual carbon loss due to fuelwood removal (Lfuelwood) using Equation 2.13 in Chapter 2;  
Step 5: Estimate annual carbon loss due to disturbance (Ldisturbance) using Equation 2.14 in Chapter 2, avoid 
double counting of losses already covered in wood removals and fuelwood removals; 
Step 6: From the estimated losses in Steps 3 to 5, estimate the annual decrease in carbon stocks due to biomass 
losses (∆CL) using Equation 2.11 in Chapter 2; 
Step 7: Estimate the annual change in carbon stocks in biomass (∆CB) using Equation 2.7 in Chapter 2. 
 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
4.18 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Example. The following example shows Gain-Loss Method (Tier 1) calculations of annual change 
in carbon stocks in biomass (∆CB), using Chapter 2, Equation 2.7 (∆CB = (∆CG – ∆CL)), for a 
hypothetical country in temperate continental forest zone of Europe (Table 4.1, Section 4.5):  
- 
the area of Forest Land Remaining Forest Land (A) within the country is 100,000 ha (see 
Chapter 3 for area categorization); 
- 
it is a 25-year-old pine forest, average above-ground growing stock volume is 40 m3 ha-1; 
- 
the merchantable round wood harvest over bark (H) is 1,000 m3 yr-1; 
- 
whole trees fuel wood removal (FGtrees) is 500 m3 yr-1;  
- 
area of insect disturbance is 2,000 ha yr-1 with above-ground biomass affected 4.0 tonne d.m. 
ha-1. 
Annual gain in biomass (∆CG) is a product of mean annual biomass increment (GTOTAL), area of 
land (A) and carbon fraction of dry matter (CF); Equation 2.9 in Chapter 2 (ΔCG = ∑ij (A ● GTOTAL 
● CF). GTOTAL is calculated using Chapter 2, Equation 2.10 for given values of annual above-
ground biomass growth (GW), below-ground biomass to above-ground biomass ratio (R), and 
default data tables in Section 4.5.  
For the hypothetical country,  
GW                  = 4.0 tonnes d.m. ha-1 yr-1 (Table 4.9); 
R  
= 0.29 tonne d.m. (tonne d.m.)-1 for above-ground biomass of 50 to 150 t ha-1 (Table 4.4 
with reference to Table 4.7 for above ground biomass);  
GTOTAL 
= 4.0 tonnes d.m. ha-1 yr-1 ● (1 + 0.29) = 5.16 tonnes d.m. ha-1 yr-1 (Equation 2.10); and 
CF  
= 0.47 tonne C (tonne d.m.)-1 (Table 4.3).  
Consequently, (Equation 2.9): ∆CG = 100,000 ha ● 5.16 tonnes d.m. ha-1 yr-1 ● 0.47 tonne C (tonne 
dm)-1 = 242,520 tonnes C yr-1. 
Biomass loss (∆CL) is a sum of annual loss due to wood removals (Lwood-removals), fuel wood 
gathering (Lfuelwood) and disturbances (Ldisturbance), Equation 2.11 in Chapter 2. 
Wood removal (Lwood-removals) is calculated with Equation 2.12, Chapter 2, merchantable round 
wood over bark (H), biomass conversion expansion factor (BCEFR), bark fraction in harvested 
wood (BF), below-ground biomass to above-ground biomass ratio (R), carbon fraction of dry 
matter (CF) and default tables, Section 4.5.  
For the hypothetical country,  
BCEFR 
= 1.11 tonnes d.m. m-3 (Table 4.5 with reference to growing stock volume 40 m3 ha-1);  
BF 
= 0.1 tonne d.m. (tonne d.m.)-1. R = 0.29 tonne d.m. (tonne d.m.)-1 for above-ground 
biomass 50 to 150 t ha-1 (Table 4.4, for above-ground biomass refer to Table 4.7); and 
CF 
= 0.47 tonne C (tonne d.m.)-1 (Table 4.3).  
Lwood-removals = 1,000 m3 yr-1 ● 1.11 tonnes d.m. m-3 (1 + 0.29 + 0.1) ● 0.47 tonne C (tonne d.m.)-1  
 
  = 725.16 tonnes C yr-1 (Equation 2.12). 
Fuelwood removal (Lfuelwood) is calculated using Equation 2.13, Chapter 2, wood removals as whole 
trees (FGtrees), biomass conversion expansion factor (BCEFR), below-ground biomass to above-
ground biomass ratio (R), carbon fraction of dry matter (CF) and default tables in Section 4.5. For 
the hypothetical country,  
BCEFR 
= 1.11 tonnes d.m. m-3 (Table 4.5 with reference to growing stock volume 40 m3 ha-1); 
R 
= 0.29 tonne d.m. (tonne dm)-1 for above-ground biomass 50 to 150 t ha-1 (Table 4.4, for 
above-ground biomass refer to Table 4.7); and 
CF 
= 0.47 tonne C (tonne dm)-1 (Table 4.3).  
Lfuelwood = 500 m3 yr-1 ● 0.75 tonne d.m. m-3 (1 + 0.29) ● 0.47 tonne C (tonne d.m.)-1  
           = 336.50 tonne C yr-1 (Equation 2.13). 
Chapter 4: Forest Land

4.19 
Annual carbon loss in biomass due to disturbances (Ldisturbance) is calculated using Equation 2.14, 
Chapter 2, area of disturbances (Adisturbance), average above-ground biomass affected (BW), below-
ground biomass to above-ground biomass ratio (R), carbon fraction of dry matter (CF), fraction of 
biomass lost in disturbance (fd) and default tables in Section 4.5. For the hypothetical country,  
R  
= 0.29 tonne d.m. (tonne dm)-1 for above-ground biomass 50 to 150 t ha-1 (Table 4.4, for 
above-ground biomass refer to Table 4.7);  
CF 
= 0.47 tonne C (tonne dm)-1  (Table 4.3); and fd = 0.3 
Ldisturbance  = 2,000 ha yr-1 ● 4.0 tonnes d.m. ha-1 (1 + 0.29) ● 0.47 tonne C (tonne dm)-1 ● 0.3 
              = 1,455.12 tonnes C yr-1 (Equation 2.14) 
Annual decrease in carbon stocks due to biomass losses (∆CL), 
∆CL 
= 725.16 tonnes C yr-1 + 336.50 tonnes C yr-1 + 1,455.12 tonnes C yr-1  
  
= 2,516.78 tonnes C yr-1 (Equation 2.11) 
Annual change in carbon stocks in biomass (∆CB) 
Using Chapter 2, Equation 2.7 (∆CB = (∆CG – ∆CL)), 
∆CB = 242,520 tonnes C yr-1 – 2,516.78 tonnes C yr-1 = 240,003.22 tonnes C yr-1  
4.2.1.5 
UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT 
This section considers source-specific uncertainties relevant to inventory estimates made for Forest Land 
Remaining Forest Land. Estimating country-specific and/or disaggregated values requires more accurate 
information on uncertainties than given below. Volume 1, Chapter 3 provides information on uncertainties 
associated with sample-based studies. The literature available on uncertainty estimates on emission factors and 
activity data is limited. 
Emission and removal factors  
FAO (2006) provides uncertainty estimates for forest carbon factors; basic wood density (10 to 40%); annual 
increment in managed forests of industrialized countries (6 %); growing stock (industrialized countries 8%, non-
industrialized countries 30%); combined natural losses for industrialized countries (15%); wood and fuelwood 
removals (industrialized countries 20%). 
In Finland, the uncertainty of basic wood density of pine, spruce and birch trees is under 20% in studies of 
Hakkila (1968, 1979). The variability between forest stands of the same species should be lower or at most the 
same as for individual trees of the same species. In Finland, the uncertainty of biomass expansion factors for 
pine, spruce, and birch was approximately 10% (Lehtonen et al., 2003). 
In eight Amazon tropical forest inventory plots, combined measurement errors led to errors of 10-30% in 
estimates of basal area change over periods of less than 10 years (Phillips et al., 2002). 
The major sources of uncertainty of wood density and biomass expansion factors are stand age, species 
composition, and structure. To reduce uncertainty, countries are encouraged to develop country- or region-
specific biomass expansion factors and BCEFs that fit their conditions. In case country- or regional-specific 
values are unavailable, the sources of default parameters should be checked and their correspondence with 
specific conditions of a country should be examined. 
The causes of variation of annual increment include climate, site growth conditions, and soil fertility. Artificially 
regenerated and managed stands are less variable than natural forests. The major ways to improve accuracy of 
estimates are associated with application of country-specific or regional increment stratified by forest type. If the 
default values of increment are used, the uncertainty of estimates should be clearly indicated and documented. 
Tier 3 approaches can use growth curves stratified by species, ecological zones, site productivity and 
management intensity. Similar approaches are routinely used in timber supply planning models and this 
information can be incorporated into carbon accounting models (e.g., Kurz et al., 2002). 
Data on commercial fellings are relatively accurate, although they may be incomplete or biased due to illegal 
fellings and underreporting due to tax regulations. Traditional wood that is gathered and used directly, without 
being sold, is not likely to be included in any statistics. Countries must carefully consider these issues. The 
amount of wood removed from forests after storm breaks and pest outbreaks varies both in time and volume. No 
default data can be provided on these types of losses. The uncertainties associated with these losses can be 
estimated from the amount of damaged wood directly withdrawn from the forest or using data on damaged wood 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
4.20 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
subsequently used for commercial and other purposes. If fuelwood gathering is treated separately from fellings, 
the relevant uncertainties might be high, due to high uncertainty associated with traditional gathering. 
Activity data 
Area data should be obtained using the guidance in Chapter 3 or from FAO (2000). Industrialized countries 
estimated an uncertainty in forest area estimates of approximately 3% (FAO, 2000).  
4.2.2 
Dead organic matter 
The general description of methods for estimating changes in carbon stocks in dead organic matter (DOM) pools 
(litter and dead wood) has been provided in Chapter 2.  
This section focuses on methods for estimating carbon stock changes in dead organic matter pools for Forest 
Land Remaining Forest Land. Tier 1 methods assume that the net carbon stock changes in DOM pools are zero 
because the simple input and output equations used in Tier 1 methods are not suitable to capture the DOM pool 
dynamics. Countries that want to quantify DOM dynamics need to develop Tier 2 or 3 methodologies. The 
countries where DOM is a key category should adopt higher tiers and estimate DOM changes. 
The dead wood (DW) pool contains carbon in coarse woody debris, dead coarse roots, standing dead trees, and 
other dead material not included in the litter or soil carbon pools. Estimating the size and dynamics of the dead 
wood pool poses many practical limitations, particularly related to field measurements. The uncertainties 
associated with estimates of the rate of transfer from the DW pool to the litter and soil pools, and emissions to 
the atmosphere are generally high. The amount of dead wood is highly variable between stands, both in managed 
(Duvall and Grigal, 1999; Chojnacky and Heath, 2002) and unmanaged lands (Spies et al., 1988). Amounts of 
dead wood depend on the time since last disturbance, the type of the last disturbance, losses during disturbances, 
the amount of biomass input (mortality) at the time of the disturbance (Spies et al., 1988), natural mortality rates, 
decay rates, and management (Harmon et al., 1986). 
Net litter accumulation rates can be estimated using the stock-difference method or the gain-loss method. The 
latter requires an estimate of the balance of the annual amount of litterfall (which includes all leaves, twigs and 
small branches, fruits, flowers, roots, and bark) minus the annual rate of litter decomposition. In addition, 
disturbances can add and remove carbon from the litter pool, influencing the size and composition of the litter 
pool. The litter dynamics during the early stages of stand development depend on the type and intensity of the 
last disturbance. Where disturbance has transferred biomass to DOM pools (e.g., wind-throw or insect kill), litter 
pools can be decreasing until losses are compensated by litter inputs. Where disturbance has removed litter (e.g., 
wildfire), litter pools can be increasing in the early stages of stand development if litter input exceeds decay. 
Management such as timber harvesting, slash burning, and site preparation alter litter properties (Fisher and 
Binkley, 2000), but there are few studies clearly documenting the effects of management on litter carbon (Smith 
and Heath, 2002).  
4.2.2.1 
CHOICE OF METHOD 
The decision tree in Figure 2.3 in Chapter 2 provides guidance in the selection of the appropriate tier level for 
the implementation of estimation procedures. The choice of method is described jointly for dead wood and Litter 
since the equations are identical for both, but the estimates are calculated separately for each of the two pools. 
The estimation of changes in carbon stocks in DOM pool requires estimates of changes in carbon stocks of dead 
wood and litter pools (refer to Equation 2.17 of Chapter 2). 
Tier 1 
The Tier 1 method assumes that the dead wood and litter carbon stocks are in equilibrium so that the changes in 
carbon stock in the DOM pools are assumed to be zero. Countries experiencing significant changes in forest 
types, disturbance or management regimes in their forests are encouraged to develop domestic data to quantify 
the impacts from these changes using Tier 2 or 3 methodologies and to report the resulting stock changes and 
non-CO2 emissions.  
Tiers 2 and 3 
Two general methods are available for estimating the carbon stock changes in dead wood and litter. Similar 
methods exist for the estimation of biomass carbon stock changes, and the choice of method for estimating DOM 
changes may be affected by the choice of method for biomass carbon stock change estimation.  
Gain-Loss Method: The Gain-Loss method uses a mass balance of inputs to and losses from the dead wood and 
litter pools to estimate stock changes over a specified period. This involves estimating the area of managed 
Forest Land Remaining Forest Land and the average annual transfer of carbon stock into and out of dead wood 
and litter pools (Equation 2.18 in Chapter 2). To reduce uncertainty, the area under Forest Land Remaining 
Chapter 4: Forest Land 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.21 
Forest Land can be further stratified by climate or ecological zones, and classified by forest type, productivity, 
disturbance regime, management practice, or other factors that affect dead wood and litter carbon pool dynamics. 
Estimation of the net balance requires calculation on a per hectare basis of the annual transfers into the dead 
wood and litter pools from stem mortality, litterfall and turnover, and the losses from decomposition. In addition, 
in areas subject to management activities or natural disturbances, dead wood and litter will be added in the form 
of biomass residues, and transferred through harvest (salvage of standing dead trees), burning or other 
mechanisms.  
It is good practice that the stratification of Forest Land adopted for DOM be identical to that used for the 
estimation of changes in biomass carbon stocks (Section 4.2.1). 
Stock-Difference Method: This involves estimating the area of managed Forest Land Remaining Forest Land, 
determining the dead wood and litter carbon stocks at two points of time and the calculation of the difference 
between the two carbon stock estimates (Equation 2.19 in Chapter 2). The annual carbon stock change for the 
inventory year is obtained by dividing the change in carbon stock by the period (years) between the two 
measurements. Method 2 is only feasible for countries which have forest inventories based on sample plots.  
Calculating carbon stock changes as the difference of carbon stocks at two points in time requires that the area at 
time t1 and t2 is identical to ensure that reported carbon stocks are not the result of changes in area. 
For Tiers 2 and 3 methods, both options, are data intensive and require field measurements and models for their 
implementation. Such models can build on the knowledge and information compiled for the simulation of forest 
dynamics as used in the timber supply planning process (e.g. Kurz et al., 2002, and Kurz and Apps, 2006).  
4.2.2.2 
CHOICE OF EMISSION/REMOVAL FACTORS 
Tier 1 
By default, it is assumed that the carbon stocks in the DOM pools in Forest Land Remaining Forest Land are 
stable. Carbon-dioxide emissions originating from dead wood and litter pools during wildfire are assumed to be 
zero, and accumulation of carbon in dead wood and litter pools during regrowth is also not counted. Non- CO2 
emissions from wildfire, including CH4 and CO are estimated in Tier 1.  
Tiers 2 and 3 
The parameter fBLol is the fraction of total biomass left to decay on the ground, see Chapter 2, Equation 2.20. 
Resolution and accuracy of the transferred carbon will correspond to the expansion factors applied in calculating 
losses. 
Tier 2 estimation of fBlol requires national data on average proportions of carbon left after disturbances. When 
national data are incomplete, Chapter 2 provides two tables:  
• 
Default values of combustion factor to be used as (1– fBL) in case the country has good growing stock 
biomass data; in this case the proportion lost is used; see Table 2.6 
• 
Default values of biomass removals to be used as [MB • (1– fBL)] in case the growing stock biomass data are 
not reliable. MB is the mass of fuel available for combustion (see Table 2.4 and Equation 2.27 in Chapter 2). 
Country-specific values for transfer of carbon in live trees that are harvested to harvest residues can be derived 
from 
national 
expansion 
factors, 
taking 
into 
account 
the 
forest 
type 
(coniferous/broadleaved/ 
mixed), the rate of biomass utilization, harvesting practices and the amount of damaged trees during harvesting 
operations. Both harvest and natural disturbances add biomass to dead wood and litter pools. Other management 
practices (such as burning of harvest residues) and wildfire remove carbon from dead wood and litter pools. If 
the area under each management practice and type of forest affected by disturbance are known, then disturbance 
matrices (see Chapter 2, Table 2.1; Kurz et al., 1992) can be used to define for each disturbance type the 
proportion of each biomass, dead organic matter, and soil carbon pool that is transferred to other pools, to the 
atmosphere, or removed from the forest during harvest.  
Tier 3 estimation of fBlol, will require more detailed knowledge of the proportion of rapid emissions from 
disturbances such as fires and windstorms. Data should be obtained by on-site measurements or from studies of 
similar disturbances. Disturbance matrices (see Chapter 2, Table 2.1) have been developed to define, for each 
disturbance type, the proportion of biomass (and all other carbon pools) that is transferred to other carbon pools, 
released to the atmosphere, or transferred to harvested wood products (Kurz et al., 1992). Disturbance matrices 
ensure conservation of carbon when calculating the immediate impacts of harvest or disturbances on ecosystem 
carbon. 
Tier 3 methods rely on more complex forest carbon accounting models that track the rates of input and losses 
from dead organic matter pools for each forest type, productivity, and age-class. Where comprehensive forest 
inventories exist, that include re-measurement of dead organic matter pools, estimates of carbon stock changes 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
4.22 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
can also be derived using the stock-difference approach described in Equation 2.19 in Chapter 2. It is good 
practice that inventory-based approaches with periodic sampling follow the principles set out in Chapter 3, 
Annex 3A.3. Inventory-based approaches can be coupled with models to capture the dynamics of all forest 
carbon pools. Tier 3 methods provide estimates of greater certainty than lower tiers and feature a greater link 
between the dynamics of biomass and dead organic matter carbon pools. Other important parameters in 
modelling dead wood and litter carbon budgets are decay rates, which may vary with the forest type and climatic 
conditions, and forest management practices (e.g., controlled broadcast burning or thinning and other forms of 
partial harvest).  
4.2.2.3 
CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
Countries using a Tier 1 method require no activity data for estimation of changes in carbon stock in DOM in 
Forest Land Remaining Forest Land. 
Countries using higher tiers require activity data on the areas of Forest Land Remaining Forest Land classified 
by major forest types, management practices, and disturbance regimes. Total forest area and all other activity 
data should be consistent with that reported under other sections of this chapter, notably under biomass section 
of Forest Land Remaining Forest Land (Section 4.2.1). Country-specific activity data on the area annually 
affected by harvest and disturbances can be derived from national monitoring programs. The assessment of 
changes in carbon stock in DOM is greatly facilitated if this information can be used in conjunction with national 
soil and climate data, vegetation inventories, and other geophysical data.  
Data sources will vary according to a country’s forest management system. Data can be compiled from 
individual contractors or companies, regulation bodies and governmental agencies responsible for forest 
inventory and management, and from research institutions. Data formats vary widely, and include, among others, 
activity reports submitted regularly within incentive programs or as required by regulations, forest management 
inventories and from monitoring programs using remotely sensed imagery (Wulder et al., 2004).  
4.2.2.4 
CALCULATION STEPS FOR TIER 1 
Since Tier 1 assumes no change in DOM for Forest Land Remaining Forest Land, guidance on calculations 
steps is not relevant. 
4.2.2.5 
UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT 
Tier 1 by definition assumes stable carbon stocks so formal uncertainty analysis is not appropriate. In fact the 
assumption is almost never true at the stand level and unlikely to be true in general, although the resulting error 
could be small for a forested landscape because increases in some stands could be off-set by decreases in others, 
but for the entire landscape or country, dead organic matter pools can be either increasing or decreasing. An 
understanding of the types of changes that are occurring in the forests of a country can provide some qualitative 
insight into the direction of change in dead organic matter pools. For example, in some countries biomass 
growing stocks are increasing because harvest and disturbance losses are smaller than growth increments. It is 
likely that dead organic matter pools are also increasing, even if the rate of increase cannot be known unless a 
Tier 2 or 3 estimation method is used.  
Countries that use methods that assume all carbon losses occur in the year of disturbance are likely to 
overestimate disturbance losses in the years of above-average disturbances, and underestimate true emissions in 
years of below-average disturbances. Countries with fairly constant harvest or disturbance rates that rely on such 
methods are likely to be closer to the actual net carbon stock changes.  
The uncertainty of estimates using higher Tier methods must be evaluated for each country using expert 
judgment. It is fair to assume that the uncertainty in the estimates of changes of carbon stock in dead organic 
matter is generally larger than that of the estimates of changes in carbon stock in biomass since, in most 
countries, considerably more data are available on biomass stocks than on dead organic matter stocks. Moreover, 
models that describe biomass dynamics are generally more advanced than models of dead organic matter 
dynamics. 
Given the increased importance of understanding the non-timber components of forest ecosystems, many 
countries have revised their inventory procedures. More data on dead organic matter carbon stocks and their 
dynamics are becoming available, which will allow inventory agencies to better identify, quantify and reduce 
uncertainties in dead organic matter estimates in the years to come.  
Chapter 4: Forest Land 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.23 
4.2.3 
Soil carbon 
This section elaborates on estimation procedures and good practices for estimating change in forest soil C stocks. 
It does not include forest litter, which is a dead organic matter pool. Separate guidance is provided for two types 
of forest soils: 1) mineral forest soils, and 2) organic forest soils.   
The organic   C content of mineral forest soils (to 1 m depth) typically varies between 20 to over 300 tonnes C 
ha-1 depending on the forest type and climatic conditions (Jobbagy and Jackson, 2000). Globally, mineral forest 
soils contain approximately 700 Pg C (Dixon et al., 1994), but soil organic C pools are not static due to 
differences between C inputs and outputs over time. Inputs are largely determined by the forest productivity, the 
decomposition of litter and its incorporation into the mineral soil and subsequent loss through 
mineralization/respiration (Pregitzer, 2003). Other losses of soil organic C occur through erosion or the 
dissolution of organic C that is leached to groundwater or loss through overland flow. A large proportion of 
input is from above-ground litter in forest soils so soil organic matter tends to concentrate in the upper soil 
horizons, with roughly half of the soil organic C in the upper 30 cm layer. The C held in the upper profile is 
often the most chemically decomposable, and the most directly exposed to natural and anthropogenic 
disturbances. This section only deals with soil C and does not address decomposing litter (i.e., dead organic 
matter, see Section 4.2.2). 
Human activities and other disturbances such as changes in forest type, productivity, decay rates and 
disturbances can alter the C dynamics of forest soils. Different forest management activities, such as rotation 
length; choice of tree species; drainage; harvest practices (whole tree or sawlog, regeneration, partial cut or 
thinning); site preparation activities (prescribed fires, soil scarification); and fertilization, affect soil organic C 
stocks (Harmon and Marks, 2002; Liski et al., 2001; Johnson and Curtis, 2001). Changes in disturbance regimes, 
notably in the occurrence of severe forest fires, pest outbreaks, and other stand-replacing disturbances are also 
expected to alter the forest soil C pool (Li and Apps, 2002; de Groot et al., 2002). In addition, drainage of forest 
stands on organic soils reduces soil C stocks. 
General information and guidelines on estimating changes soil C stocks are found in Chapter 2, Section 2.3.3, 
and needs to be read before proceeding with the specific guidelines dealing with forest soil C stocks. Changes in 
soil C stocks associated with forests are computed using Equation 2.24 in Chapter 2, which combines the change 
in soil organic C stocks for mineral soils and organic soils; and stock change for soil inorganic C pools (Tier 3 
only).  This section elaborates on estimation procedures and good practices for estimating change in forest soil C 
organic stocks (Note: It does not include forest litter, i.e., dead organic matter). Separate guidance is provided for 
two types of forest soils: 1) mineral forest soils, and 2) organic forest soils. See Section 2.3.3.1 for general 
discussion on soil inorganic C (no additional information is provided in the Forest Land discussion below). 
To account for changes in soil C stocks associated with Forest Land Remaining Forest Land, countries need to 
have, at a minimum, estimates of the total Forest Land area at the beginning and end of the inventory time period, 
stratified by climate region and soil type. If land-use and management activity data are limited, Approach 1 
activity data (see Chapter 3) can be used as the basis for a Tier 1 approach, but higher Tiers are likely to need 
more detailed records or knowledge of country experts about the approximate distribution of forest management 
systems. Forest Land classes must be stratified according to climate regions and major soil types, which can be 
accomplished with overlays of suitable climate and soil maps. 
4.2.3.1 
CHOICE OF METHOD 
Inventories can be developed using Tier 1, 2 or 3 approaches, and countries may choose to use different tiers for 
mineral and organic soils.  Decision trees are provided for mineral soils (Figure 2.4) and organic soils (Figure 
2.5) in Chapter 2 to assist inventory compilers with selection of the appropriate tier for their soil C inventory. 
Mineral soils 
In spite of a growing body of literature on the effect of forest types, management practices and other 
disturbances on soil organic C, the available evidence remains largely site- and study-specific, but eventually 
may be generalized based on the influence of climatic conditions, soil properties, the time scale of interest, 
taking into consideration sampling intensity and effects across different soil depth increments (Johnson and 
Curtis, 2001; Hoover, 2003; Page-Dumroese et al., 2003).  However, the current knowledge remains 
inconclusive on both the magnitude and direction of C stock changes in mineral forest soils associated with 
forest type, management and other disturbances, and cannot support broad generalizations.  
Tier 1 
Due to incomplete scientific basis and resulting uncertainty, it is assumed in the Tier 1 method that forest soil C 
stocks do not change with management.  Furthermore, if using Approach 2 or 3 activity data (see Chapter 3), it is 
not necessary to compute C stock changes for mineral soils (i.e., change in SOC stocks is 0).  
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
4.24 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
If using activity data collected via Approach 1 (see Chapter 3), and it is not possible to identify the amount of 
land converted from and to Forest Land, then the inventory compiler should estimate soil C stocks for Forest 
Land using the areas at and the end of the year for which the inventory is being estimated, and the difference 
estimates the uptake or less of forest soil. The changes in soil C stocks for Forest Land are summed with the 
changes in stocks for other land uses to estimate the influence of land-use change.  If the compiler does not 
compute a stock for Forest Land, it is likely to create systematic errors in the inventory.  For example, land 
converted from Forest Land to Cropland or Grassland will have a soil C stock estimated in the final year of the 
inventory, but will have no stock in the first year of the inventory (when it was forest).  Consequently, 
conversion to Cropland or Grassland is estimated as a gain in soil C because the soil C stocks are assumed to be 
0 in the Forest Land, but not in Cropland and Grassland.  This would introduce a bias into the inventory 
estimates. SOC0 and SOC0-T are estimated for the top 30 cm of the soil profile using Equation 2.25 (Chapter 2). 
Note that areas of exposed bedrock in Forest Land are not included in the soil C stock calculation (assume a 
stock of 0). 
Tier 2 
Using Equation 2.25 (Chapter 2) soil organic C stocks are computed based on reference soil C stocks and 
country-specific stock change factors for forest type (FI), management (FMG) and natural disturbance regime (FD).  
Note that the stock change factor for natural disturbance regime (FD) is substituted for the land-use factor (FLU) 
in Equation 2.25.  In addition, country-specific information can be incorporated to better specify reference C 
stocks, climate regions, soil types, and/or the land management classification system.   
Tier 3 
Tier 3 approaches will require considerable knowledge and data allowing for the development of an accurate and 
comprehensive domestic estimation methodology, including evaluation of model results and implementation of a 
domestic monitoring scheme and/or modelling tool. The basic elements of a country-specific approach are 
(adapted from Webbnet Land Resource Services Pty ltd, 1999): 
• 
Stratification by climatic zones, major forest types and management regimes coherent with those used for 
other C pools in the inventory, especially biomass;  
• 
Determination of dominant soil types in each stratum; 
• 
Characterization of corresponding soil C pools, identification of determinant processes in SOC input and 
output rates and the conditions under which these processes occur; and 
• 
Determination and implementation of suitable methods to estimate carbon stock changes from forest soils 
for each stratum on an operational basis, including model evaluation procedures; methodological 
considerations are expected to include the combination of monitoring activities – such as repeated forest soil 
inventories - and modelling studies, and the establishment of benchmark sites. Further guidance on good soil 
monitoring practices is available in the scientific literature (Kimble et al., 2003, Lal et al., 2001, McKenzie 
et al., 2000). It is good practice for models developed or adapted for this purpose to be peer-reviewed, and 
validated with observations representative of the ecosystems under study and independent from the 
calibration data.  
Organic soils 
Tier 1 
Currently, only C emissions due to drainage of forest organic soils are addressed in the Tier 1 method due to data 
limitations and lack of sufficient knowledge that constrain the development of a more refined default 
methodology.  Using Equation 2.26 (Chapter 2), drained forest organic soils are stratified by climate type, and 
then multiplied by a climate-specific emission factor to derive an estimate of annual C emissions. Areas 
converted to Forest Land can be included in the total area estimate, in using Approach 1 land representation, 
without supplementary data, to be able to identify land-use changes. 
Tier 2 
For Tier 2, the same basic equation is used as in Tier 1 (Equation 2.26), but country-specific information is 
incorporated to better specify emission factors, climate regions, and/or develop a forest classification scheme, 
relevant for organic soils.  
Tier 3 
Tier 3 methodology involves the estimation of CO2 emissions associated with management of forested organic 
soils, including all anthropogenic activities likely to alter the hydrological regime, surface temperature, and 
vegetation composition of forested organic soils; and major disturbances such as fires.  
Chapter 4: Forest Land 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.25 
4.2.3.2 
CHOICE OF STOCK CHANGE AND EMISSION FACTORS 
Mineral soils 
Tier 1 
It is not necessary to compute the stock estimates for Forest Land Remaining Forest Land with Approach 2 or 3 
activity data (see Chapter 3).  If using Approach 1 activity data, stock change factors, including input, 
management and disturbance regime, are equal to 1 using the Tier 1 approach.  Consequently, only reference C 
stocks are needed to apply the method, and those are provided in Table 2.3 of Chapter 2. 
Tier 2 
In a Tier 2 approach, stock change factors are derived based on a country-specific classification scheme for 
management, forest types, and natural disturbance regimes.  A Tier 2 approach should also include the derivation 
of country-specific reference C stocks, and a more detailed classification of climate and soils than the default 
categories provided with the Tier 1 method.  
It is good practice to focus on the factors that have the largest overall effect, taking into account the impact on 
forest SOC and the extent of affected forests. Management practices can be coarsely labeled as intensive (e.g., 
plantation forestry) or extensive (e.g., natural forest); these categories can also be redefined according to national 
circumstances. The development of stock change factors is likely to be based on intensive studies at 
experimental sites and sampling plots involving replicated, paired site comparisons (Johnson et al., 2002; Olsson 
et al., 1996; see also the reviews by Johnson and Curtis, 2001; and Hoover, 2003).  In practice, it may not be 
possible to separate the effects of a different forest types, management practices and disturbance regimes, in 
which case some stock change factors can be combined into a single modifier. If a country has well-documented 
data for different forest types under different management regimes, it might be possible to derive soil organic C 
estimates directly without using reference C stocks and adjustment factors.  However, a relationship to the 
reference C stocks must be established so that the impact of land-use change can be computed without artificial 
increases or decreases in the C stocks due to a lack of consistency in the methods across the various land-use 
categories (i.e., Forest Land, Cropland, Grassland, Settlements, and Other Land).   
Inventories can also be improved by deriving country-specific reference C stocks (SOCref), compiled from 
published studies or surveys. Such values are typically obtained through the development and/or compilation of 
large soil profile databases (Scott et al., 2002; Siltanen et al., 1997).  Additional guidance for deriving stock 
change factors and reference C stocks is provided in Section 2.3.3.1 (Chapter 2). 
Tier 3 
Constant stock change rate factors per se are less likely to be estimated in favor of variable rates that more 
accurately capture land-use and management effects.  See Section 2.3.3.1 (Chapter 2) for further discussion. 
Organic soils 
Tier 1 
Default emission factors are provided in Table 4.6 of Section 4.5, to estimate the loss of C associated with 
drainage of organic soils. 
Tier 2 
Tier 2 approaches involve the derivation of emission factors from country-specific data.  The main consideration 
is whether forests types or management in addition to climate regions will be subdivided into finer classes.  
These decisions will depend on experimental data that demonstrate significant differences in C loss rates.  For 
example, drainage classes can be developed for various forest management systems.  In addition, management 
activities may disrupt the C dynamics of the underlying organic soils. Harvest, for example, may cause a rise in 
the water table due to reduced interception, evaporation and transpiration (Dubé et al., 1995).     
Tier 3 
Constant emission rate factors per se are less likely to be estimated in favor of variable rates that more accurately 
capture land-use and management effects.  See Section 2.3.3.1 (Chapter 2) for further discussion.  
4.2.3.3 
CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
Mineral soils 
Tier 1 
For the Tier 1 approach, it is assumed that forest soil C stocks do not change with management, and therefore it 
is not necessary to classify forest into various types, management classes or natural disturbance regimes.  
However, if using Approach 1 activity data (see Chapter 3), environmental data will be needed to classify the 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
4.26 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
country into climate regions and soil types in order to apply the appropriate reference C stocks to Forest Land.  
A detailed description of the default climate classification scheme is given in Chapter 3, Annex 3A.5.  If the 
information needed to classify climate types is not available from national databases, there are international 
sources of climate data such as United Nations Environmental Program.  Data will also be needed to classify 
soils into the default categories provided in Chapter 3, and if national data are not available to map the soil types, 
international soils data provide a reasonable alternative, such as the FAO Soils Map of the World.   
Tier 2 
Activity data for the Tier 2 approach consist of the major forest types, management practices, disturbance 
regimes and the areas to which they apply. It is preferable for the data to be linked with the national forest 
inventory, where one exists, and/or with national soil and climate databases. Typical changes include: 
conversion of unmanaged to managed forest; conversion of native forest into a new forest type; intensification of 
forest management activities, such as site preparation, tree planting and rotation length changes; changes in 
harvesting practices (bole vs. whole-tree harvesting; amount of residues left on-site); frequency of disturbances 
(pest and disease outbreaks, flooding, fires, etc). Data sources will vary according to a country’s forest 
management system, but could include individual contractors or companies, statutory forest authorities, research 
institutions and agencies responsible for forest inventories. Data formats vary widely, and include, among others, 
activity reports, forest management inventories and remote sensing imagery. 
In addition, Tier 2 should involve a finer stratification of environmental data than the Tier 1 approach, including 
climate regions and soil types, which would likely be based on national climate and soils data.  If a finer 
classification scheme is utilized in a Tier 2 inventory, reference C stocks will also need to be derived for the 
more detailed set of climate regions and soil types, and the land management data will need to be stratified based 
on the country-specific classification. 
Tier 3 
For application of dynamic models and/or a direct measurement-based inventory in Tier 3, similar or more 
detailed data on the combinations of climate, soil, topographic and management data are needed, relative to the 
Tiers 1 and 2 methods, but the exact requirements will be dependent on the model or measurement design.  
Organic soils 
Tier 1 
Forests are not stratified into various systems using Tier 1 methods.  However, land areas do need to be stratified 
by climate region and soil type (see Chapter 3 for guidance on soil and climate classification) so that organic 
soils may be identified and the appropriate default emission factor applied.   
Tier 2 
Tier 2 approaches may involve a finer stratification of management, forest type or disturbance regime, in a 
manner consistent with the country-specific emission factors for organic soils. For example, forest systems will 
need to be stratified by drainage if management factors are derived by drainage class.  However it is good 
practice for the classification to be based on empirical data that demonstrates significant differences in rates of C 
change for the proposed categories.  In addition, Tier 2 approaches should involve a finer stratification of climate 
regions.   
Tier 3 
For application of dynamic models and/or a direct measurement-based inventory in Tier 3, similar or more 
detailed data on the combinations of climate, soil, topographic and management data are needed, relative to the 
Tiers 1 and 2 methods, but the exact requirements will be dependent on the model or measurement design. 
4.2.3.4 
CALCULATION STEPS FOR TIER 1 
Mineral soils 
Since Tier 1 assumes no change in mineral soil C stocks for Forest Land Remaining Forest Land, guidance on 
calculations steps are not provided. 
Organic soils 
Step 1: Estimate the area of drained organic soils under managed forest in each climatic region of the country 
for each year or for the last year in each time period of the inventory (e.g., emissions over an inventory time 
period between 1990 and 2000 would be based on the land-use in 2000, assuming land-use and management are 
only known for these two years during the inventory time period).   
Step 2: Select the appropriate emission factor (EF) for annual losses of CO2 (from Table 4.6).  
Step 3: Estimate total emissions by summing the product of area (A) multiplied by the emission factor (EF) for 
all climate zones.  
Chapter 4: Forest Land 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.27 
4.2.3.5 
UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT 
Three broad sources of uncertainty exists in soil C inventories: 1) uncertainties in land-use and management 
activity and environmental data; 2) uncertainties in reference soil C stocks if using Tier 1 or 2 approaches 
(mineral soils only); and 3) uncertainties in the stock change/emission factors for Tier 1 or 2 approaches, model 
structure/parameter error for Tier 3 model-based approaches, or measurement error/sampling variability 
associated with Tier 3 measurement-based inventories.   In general, precision of an inventory is increased (i.e., 
smaller confidence ranges) with more sampling to estimate values for the three broad categories.  In addition, 
reducing bias (i.e., improve accuracy) is more likely through the development of a higher Tier inventory that 
incorporates country-specific information.   
For Tier 1, uncertainties are provided with the reference C stocks in the first footnote of Table 2.3 (Chapter 2), 
and emission factor uncertainties for organic soils are provided in Table 4.6, Section 4.5.  Uncertainties in land-
use and management data will need to be addressed by the inventory compiler, and then combined with 
uncertainties for the default factors and reference C stocks (mineral soils only) using an appropriate method, 
such as simple error propagation equations. Refer to Section 4.2.1.5 for uncertainty estimate for land area 
estimates.  However, it is good practice for the inventory compiler to derive uncertainties from country-specific 
activity data instead of using a default level.  
Default reference C stocks for mineral soils and emission factors for organic soils can have inherently high 
uncertainties, particularly bias, when applied to specific countries. Defaults represent globally averaged values of 
land-use and management impacts or reference C stocks that may vary from region-specific values (Powers et al., 
2004; Ogle et al., 2006). Bias can be reduced by deriving country-specific factors using Tier 2 method or by 
developing a Tier 3 country-specific estimation system. The underlying basis for higher Tier approaches will be 
research in the country or neighbouring regions that address the effect of land use and management on soil C.  In 
addition, it is good practice to further minimize bias by accounting for significant within-country differences in 
land-use and management impacts, such as variation among climate regions and/or soil types, even at the 
expense of reduced precision in the factor estimates (Ogle et al., 2006).  Bias is considered more problematic for 
reporting stock changes because it is not necessarily captured in the uncertainty range (i.e., the true stock change 
may be outside of the reported uncertainty range if there is significant bias in the factors).  
Uncertainties in land-use activity statistics may be improved through a better national system, such as 
developing or extending a ground-based survey with additional sample locations and/or incorporating remote 
sensing to provide additional coverage.  It is good practice to design a classification that captures the majority of 
land-use and management activity with a sufficient sample size to minimize uncertainty at the national scale. 
For Tier 2 methods, country-specific information is incorporated into the inventory analysis for purposes of 
reducing bias. For example, Ogle et al. (2003) utilized country-specific data to construct probability distribution 
functions for US specific factors, activity data and reference C stocks for agricultural soils. It is good practice to 
evaluate dependencies among the factors, reference C stocks or land-use and management activity data.  In 
particular, strong dependencies are common in land-use and management activity data because management 
practices tend to be correlated in time and space.  Combining uncertainties in stock change/emission factors, 
reference C stocks and activity data can be done using methods such as simple error propagation equations or 
Monte-Carlo procedures. 
Tier 3 models are more complex and simple error propagation equations may not be effective at quantifying the 
associated uncertainty in resulting estimates.  Monte Carlo analyses are possible (Smith and Heath, 2001), but 
can be difficult to implement if the model has many parameters (some models can have several hundred 
parameters) because joint probability distribution functions must be constructed quantifying the variance as well 
as covariance among the parameters.  Other methods are also available such as empirically-based approaches 
(Monte et al., 1996), which use measurements from a monitoring network to statistically evaluate the 
relationship between measured and modelled results (Falloon and Smith, 2003).  In contrast to modelling, 
uncertainties in measurement-based Tier 3 inventories can be determined from the sample variance, 
measurement error and other relevant sources of uncertainty. 
4.2.4 
Non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions from biomass 
burning 
Both uncontrolled (wildfires) and managed (prescribed) fires can have a major impact on the non-CO2 
greenhouse gas emissions from forests. In Forest Land Remaining Forest Land, emissions of CO2 from biomass 
burning also need to be accounted for because they are generally not synchronous with rates of CO2 uptake. This 
is especially important after stand replacing wildfire, and during cycles of shifting cultivation in tropical regions. 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
4.28 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Where the type of forest changes (e.g., conversion of natural forests to plantation forests), there may be net 
emissions of CO2 from biomass burning during the initial years, in particular if significant woody biomass is 
burnt during the conversion. Over time, however, the impacts are not as great as those that result from Forest 
Land Converted to Cropland or Grassland. Fire emissions during land-use conversion are reported in the new 
land-use category unless restricted Approach 1 land area representation is being used without supplementary 
data to enable land use conversions to be identified explicitly, in which case fire emissions from Forest Land 
should all be included in the Forest Land Remaining Forest Land category. 
The general method for estimating greenhouse gas emissions in Forest Land Remaining Forest Land, and in 
Land Converted to Forest Land is described in Equation 2.27 in Chapter 2. Default tables for Tier 1 approach or 
components of a Tier 2 approach are provided in that Section 2.4 of Chapter 2.  
4.2.4.1 
CHOICE OF METHOD 
It is good practice that countries choose the appropriate Tier for reporting greenhouse gas emissions from fire, 
based on the decision tree in Figure 2.6 in Chapter 2. Where fire is a key category, emphasis should be on using 
a Tier 2 or Tier 3 approach. For prescribed fires, country-specific data are required to generate reliable estimates 
of emissions, since activity data, in general, are poorly reflected in global data sets. In Forest Land, both the CO2 
emissions due to biomass burning and the CO2 removals resulting from vegetation regrowth need to be 
accounted for when estimating the net carbon flux. 
4.2.4.2 
CHOICE OF EMISSIONS FACTORS 
The mass of fuel available for combustion (MB of Equation 2.27) is critical for estimating the non-CO2 emissions. 
Default data to support estimation of emissions under a Tier 1 approach are given in Tables 2.4 to 2.6 in Chapter 
2. Countries need to judge how their vegetation types correspond with the broad vegetation categories described 
in the default tables. Guidance for this is provided in Chapter 3 (Consistent Representation of Lands). Countries 
using Tier 2 are likely to have national data at disaggregated level on MB, according to forest types and 
management systems. Tier 3 estimation requires spatial estimates of MB according to different forest types, 
regions and management systems. Tier 3 estimation methods can also distinguish fires burning at different 
intensities, resulting in different amounts of fuel consumption. 
4.2.4.3 
CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
Estimates of area burnt in Forest Land Remaining Forest Land are needed. A global database exists that covers 
the area burnt annually by fires but this will not provide reliable data for the area burnt annually by prescribed 
fires in individual countries. It is good practice to develop national estimates of the area burnt and the nature of 
the fires especially how they affect forest carbon dynamics (e.g., effects on tree mortality) to improve the 
reliability of national inventories. Countries using Tier 2 are likely to have access to national estimates. Tier 3 
estimation requires regional and forest type specific estimates of area subjected to fire and fire intensity. 
 
Summary of steps for calculating greenhouse gas emissions from biomass burning using Equation 2.27 in 
Chapter 2: 
Step 1: Using guidance from Chapter 3 (approaches in representing land-use areas), categorise the area of 
Forest Land Remaining Forest Land into forest types of different climatic or ecological zones, as adopted by the 
country for Equation 2.27. Obtain estimates of A (area burnt) from global database or from national sources. 
Step 2: Estimate the mass of fuel (MB) available for combustion, in tonnes/ha, which includes biomass, litter 
and dead wood. 
Step 3: Select combustion factor Cf (default values are in Table 2.6, Chapter 2). 
Step 4: Multiply MB and Cf to provide an estimate of the amount of fuel combusted. If MB or Cf  is unknown, 
defaults for the product of MB and Cf are given in Table 2.4.  
Step 5: Select emission factors Gef (default factors are in Table 2.5, Chapter 2). 
Step 6: Multiply parameters A, MB, Cf, (or MB and Cf, Table 2.4) and Gef to obtain the quantity of greenhouse 
gas emission from biomass burning. Repeat the steps for each greenhouse gas.

UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT 
Country-specific uncertainty estimates are to be estimated for Forest Land Remaining Forest Land. These result 
from the product of the uncertainties associated with activity data (area burnt) and the emission factors.  It is 
good practice to provide error estimates (e.g., ranges, standard errors) and not to use country-specific data (for 
example, if it is of a limited nature) or approaches, unless this leads to a reduction in uncertainties compared 
with a Tier 1 approach.  
4.3 
LAND CONVERTED TO FOREST LAND 
This section provides methodological guidance on annual estimation of emissions and removals of greenhouse 
gases, which occur on lands converted to Forest Land from different land-uses, including Cropland, Grassland, 
Wetlands, Settlements, and Other land, through afforestation and reforestation, either by natural or artificial 
regeneration (including plantations). The emissions and removals on abandoned lands, which are regenerating to 
forest due to human activities, should be also estimated under this section. It substitutes the method described 
under categories 5A, 5C, and 5D of the IPCC Guidelines. Land is converted to Forest Land by afforestation and 
reforestation, either by natural or artificial regeneration (including plantations). The anthropogenic conversion 
includes promotion of natural re-growth (e.g., by improving the water balance of soil by drainage), establishment 
of plantations on non-forest lands or previously unmanaged Forest land, lands of settlements and industrial sites, 
abandonment of croplands, pastures or other managed lands, which re-grow to forest. Unmanaged forests are not 
considered as anthropogenic greenhouse gas sources or sinks, and are excluded from inventory calculations. 
Where these unmanaged forests are affected by human activities such as planting, thinning, promotion of natural 
regeneration or others, they change status and become managed forests, reported under the category Land 
Converted to Forest Land, whose greenhouse gas emissions and removals should be included in the inventory 
and estimated with the use of the guidance in this section. Land conversion may result in an initial loss of carbon 
due to changes in biomass, dead organic matter, and soil carbon. But natural regeneration or plantation practices 
lead to carbon accumulation and that is related to changes in the area of plantations and their biomass stocks. 
Converted areas are considered Forest Land, if, following conversion, they correspond to definition of forest 
adopted by the country. Land Converted to Forest Land is covered in this section of the national greenhouse gas 
inventory until the time the soil carbon in new forests reach a stable level. A default period of 20 years4 is 
suggested. Forest ecosystems may require a certain time to return to the level of biomass, stable soil and litter 
pools of undisturbed state. With this in mind and as a practical matter, the default 20-year time interval is 
suggested. Countries also have an option to extend the length of transition period. After 20 years or other time 
interval chosen, the converted lands become forest, i.e., the land areas are transferred from the Land Converted 
to Forest Land category to Forest Land Remaining Forest Land (Section 4.2), where areas still becoming 
established can be treated as a separate stratum if necessary. Logging followed by regeneration or re-growth 
should be considered under Forest Land Remaining Forest Land category, since no land-use change is involved.  
Some abandoned lands may be too infertile, saline, or eroded for forest re-growth to occur. In this case, either 
the land remains in its current state or it may further degrade and lose organic matter. Those lands that remain 
constant with respect to carbon flux can be ignored.  However, in some countries, the degradation of abandoned 
lands may be a significant problem and could be an important source of CO2. Where lands continue to degrade, 
both above-ground biomass and soil carbon may decline rapidly, e.g., due to erosion. The carbon in eroded soil 
could be re-deposited in rivers, lakes or other lands downstream. For countries with significant areas of such 
lands, this issue should be considered in a more refined calculation. 
Classification of land: Land Converted to Forest Land can be classified based on climate domain and ecological 
zones and forest crown cover classes. The carbon stock varies with climate, biome or forest type, species mix, 
management practices, etc. It is good practice to stratify lands into homogenous sub-categories (see Chapter 3) 
to reduce uncertainty in estimates of greenhouse gas emissions. 
The estimation of emissions and removals of carbon from land-use conversion to Forest Land is divided into 
three sub-sections: Change in Carbon Stocks in Biomass (Section 4.3.1), Change in Carbon Stocks in Dead 
Organic Matter (Section 4.3.2) and Change in Carbon Stocks in Soils (Section 4.3.3). The annual changes in 
carbon stocks on Land Converted to Forest Land are calculated using Equations 2.2 and 2.3 of Chapter 2 on the 
                                                           
4 It is clear that most forest ecosystems will take longer than 100 years to return to the level of biomass, soil and litter pools 
in undisturbed state; however human-induced activities can enhance the rate of return to stable state of carbon stocks. With 
this in mind and as a practical matter, the default 20-year time interval is suggested to capture the establishment of the 
forest ecosystems. Countries also have the option to extend the length of the transition period, though a consistent 
transition period will be required for the land use matrix system of land area representation to work properly.

basis of annual changes in carbon stocks in biomass, dead organic matter (including dead wood and litter) and 
soil. Changes in carbon stock in Land Converted to Forest Land are estimated using:  
• 
annual change in carbon stocks in above- and below-ground biomass  
• 
annual change in carbon stocks in dead organic matter that includes dead wood and litter  
• 
annual change in carbon stocks in soils  
The approach for calculation of non-CO2 emissions is described in Section 4.3.4 based on methods given in 
Chapter 2.  
Application of these methods will only be possible if using Approach 2 or 3 land area representation as set out in 
Chapter 3, or Approach 1 data with supplementary data to enable land-use conversions to be identified. The 
actions to be taken in this case have already been identified in Section 4.2 above (Forest Land Remaining Forest 
Land). 
4.3.1 
Biomass 
This section presents methodological guidance for calculation of emissions and removals of CO2 by changes in 
biomass on Land Converted to Forest Land. It substitutes the methodology provided for reporting on “Changes 
in Forest and Other Woody Biomass Stocks” and “Abandonment of Managed Lands” categories of the IPCC 
Guidelines as applied to newly established forests. 
4.3.1.1 
CHOICE OF METHOD 
This section presents methodological guidance for calculation of emissions and removals of CO2 by changes in 
above-ground and below-ground biomass on Land Converted to Forest Land. Based on key category analysis, 
activity data and resources available, three tier methods are suggested to estimate changes in biomass stocks. The 
decision tree in Figure 1.3 in Chapter 1 illustrates good practice approach for choosing the method to calculate 
CO2 emissions and removals in biomass on Land Converted to Forest Land. 
Tier 1 
Annual change in carbon stocks in biomass is estimated with the use of Equation 2.7 in Chapter 2. Tier 1 follows 
the default approach. It implies the use of default parameters provided in Section 4.5. This approach can be also 
applied, if the data on previous land uses are not available, which may be the case, when areas are estimated 
using Approach 1 from Chapter 3. It implies the use of default parameters in Tables 4.1 through 4.14.  
Annual increase in carbon stocks in biomass, ∆CG. The calculations of ∆CG should be made according to 
Equation 2.9 in Chapter 2. As the growth rate of trees strongly depends on management regime, a distinction 
should be made between intensively (e.g., plantation forestry) and extensively (naturally re-growing stands with 
reduced or minimum human intervention) managed forests. The intensively and extensively managed forests can 
be further stratified based on climate, species, management practices, etc.  Hence, the annual increase in carbon 
stocks can be estimated separately for intensively and extensively managed forests, using Equation 2.9 twice. 
First, for intensively managed forests using relevant area (AI) and the relevant mean annual biomass growth 
(GTotal) for intensively managed forests and second, for extensively managed forests by using appropriate area 
(AE) and mean annual biomass growth (GTotal) data for extensively managed forests. GTOTAL is calculated using 
Equation 2.10, Chapter 2, and default data tables in Section 4.5. The intensively managed and extensively 
managed forests can be further stratified based on climate, species, forest management practices, etc. The default 
data for extensively and intensively managed forests from the tables should be chosen with regard to tree species 
composition and climatic region. The default data for extensively and intensively managed forests should be 
taken from Section 4.5, correspondingly. 
Annual decrease in carbon stocks in biomass due to losses, ∆CL. Biomass loss due to wood removal      
(Lwood-removals), fuelwood removal (Lfuelwood) and disturbances (Ldisturbance)  attributed to Land Converted to Forest 
Land, is estimated using Equation 2.11 in Chapter 2. 
The loss of biomass due to wood removal (Lwood-removals) is estimated with the use of Equation 2.12, of Chapter 2, 
and default values of basic wood density and the data on round wood logging, biomass conversion expansion 
factor, below-ground biomass to above-ground biomass ratio (R) and carbon fraction of dry matter (CF), 
provided in Section 4.5 tables. The biomass loss due to fuelwood removal (Lfuelwood) is estimated using Equation 
2.13, fuelwood collecting data and relevant BCEFR for growing stock, R and CF from default tables in Section 
4.5. The (Ldisturbance) could be estimated using Equation 2.14, in Chapter 2, area of disturbance, average growing 
stock biomass of land areas affected by disturbances and appropriate R and CF from default tables in Section 4.5. 
Chapter 4: Forest Land 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.31 
The ∆CL should be assumed 0, if no data on losses are available (for Equation 2.11). To prevent double 
accounting or omission, consistent reporting of biomass loss should be maintained in Sections 4.2.1 and 4.3.1. 
Tier 2 
The Tier 2 method is similar to Tier 1, but it uses nationally derived data and more disaggregated activity data 
and allows for more precise estimates of changes in carbon stocks in biomass. The net annual CO2 removals are 
calculated as a sum of increase in biomass due to biomass growth on converted lands, changes due to actual 
conversion (difference between biomass stocks before and after conversion) and losses on converted lands 
(Equations 15 and 16, Chapter 2). 
In addition to default values, the application of Tier 2 (Equation 2.15) requires national data on: i) area annually 
converted to forest; ii) average annual growth in carbon stocks in biomass per ha on converted lands, obtained 
e.g., from forest inventories (no default data can be provided); iii) change in biomass carbon when non-forest 
land becomes Forest Land; and iv) emissions due to loss of biomass on converted land. The approach may 
require data on previous land uses as well as knowledge of land-use change matrix (see Table 3.4 in Chapter 3) 
and carbon stocks on those lands. 
∆CG should be estimated using Equation 2.9, where the area (A) of Land Converted to Forest Land should be 
considered separately along with respective mean annual increments for intensively and extensively managed 
forests (further categorized based on species, climate, etc.) and summed up.  Average annual increment in 
biomass for managed forests is calculated in accordance with Tier 2 method as in Section 4.2.1, Forest Land 
Remaining Forest Land and Equation 2.10, Chapter 2, based on country-specific data on average annual biomass 
growth in merchantable volume per ha on land converted to forests (obtained e.g., from forest inventories) and 
on basic wood density, biomass conversion and expansion factors and below-ground to above-ground biomass 
ratio.  
∆CCONVERSION accounts for the initial change in biomass stocks resulting from the land-use conversion, e.g., part 
of biomass may be withdrawn through land clearing, restocking or other human-induced activities applied on 
land prior to artificial or natural regeneration. These changes in carbon stocks in biomass are calculated with the 
use of Equation 2.16 in Chapter 2. This requires estimates of biomass stocks on land type i before (BBEFOREi) and 
after (BAFTERi ) the conversion in tonnes d.m. ha-1, area of land-use i converted to Forest Land (∆ATO_FORESTi) in a 
certain year, and the carbon fraction of dry matter (CF). 
The calculation of ∆CCONVERSION may be applied separately to account for different carbon stocks occurring on 
specific types of land (ecosystems, site types, etc.) before the transition. The ∆ATO_FORESTi refers to the particular 
inventory year for which the calculations are made.  
∆CL is estimated using Equation 2.11 in Chapter 2. Biomass loss due to wood removal (Lwood-removals), fuelwood 
removal (Lfuelwood), and disturbances (Ldisturbance) should be estimated with the use of Equations 2.12 to 2.14, in 
Chapter 2. Inventory compilers are encouraged to develop country-specific wood density and BEF or BCEF 
values for growing stock increment and harvests to apply them in Equation 2.12 (for Tier 2 calculations). 
Chapter 2 describes the method for calculation of biomass losses from fuelwood gathering (Lfuelwood) and 
disturbances (Ldisturbance). The ∆CL should be assumed 0, if no data on losses are available. It is good practice to 
ensure consistent reporting on biomass losses between Sections 4.2.2 and 4.2.3 to avoid over- and 
underestimates due to double counting or omissions. 
Tier 3 
Tier 3 should be used when land conversion to Forest Land is a key category and leading to a significant change 
of carbon stocks. It can follow the same equations and steps as Tier 2 or can use more complex methods and 
models, but in either case, it can make use of substantial national methods and country-specific data. The 
Equations 2.15 and 2.16 can be expanded on the basis of finer geographical scale and sub-division to forest type, 
species, and land type before conversion. Country-defined methodologies may be based on regular forest 
inventory or geo-referenced data and (or) models for accounting for changes in biomass. National activity data 
can have high resolution and be available for all categories of converted lands and forest types established on 
them. It is good practice to describe and document the methodology in accordance with Volume 1, Chapter 8 
(Reporting Guidance and Tables). 
Transfer of biomass to dead organic matter 
During the process of conversion of land to Forest Land as well as during the process of extraction of biomass 
through felling, the non-commercial component of the biomass is left on the forest floor or transferred to dead 
organic matter. Refer to Section 4.3.2 for description of the method and the assumptions about the fate of dead 
organic matter.

2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.3.1.2 
CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTORS 
Annual increase in carbon stocks in biomass, ∆C G   
The calculations distinguish between two broad management practices: intensive (e.g., plantation forestry with 
site preparation, planting of selected species and fertilization) and extensive (natural regeneration with minimum 
human intervention). These categories can also be refined according to national circumstances, for example 
based on stand origin (e.g., natural or artificial regeneration, restocking, promotion of natural re-growth, etc.), 
climate, species, management practice, etc. 
Tier 1 
The methods for calculation of total biomass require above-ground and below-ground biomass pools (for pool 
descriptions, refer to Chapter 1). The tables in Section 4.5 represent default values of average annual growth in 
above-ground biomass for intensively (plantations) and extensively (naturally regenerated) managed forests, 
biomass conversion and expansion factors, below-ground biomass to above-ground biomass ratio and carbon 
fraction of dry matter (CF). The below-ground biomass to above-ground biomass ratio should be used to account 
for below-ground biomass in total biomass estimations. Basic wood density and biomass expansion factors, 
which allow for calculation of ∆CG as described in Section 4.2.1 Forest Land Remaining Forest Land. It is good 
practice to explore any regional or otherwise relevant default values to the country. 
Tier 2 
It is good practice to determine, wherever possible, annual increment values, below-ground biomass to above-
ground biomass, basic wood density, and biomass conversion and expansion factors appropriate for national 
conditions and use them in calculations under Tier 2. These categories can also be refined according to national 
circumstances, for example based on stand origin (natural or artificial regeneration, restocking, promotion of 
natural re-growth, etc.), climate, species composition, and management regime. The further stratifications may 
refer to tree species composition, management regime, stand age, climatic region and soil type, etc. Countries are 
encouraged to obtain specific biomass increment and expansion factors through research efforts. Additional 
guidance is provided in Section 4.2.1. 
Tier 3 
The increment in biomass carbon stocks can be estimated based on country-specific annual biomass growth and 
carbon fraction in biomass data that come from forest inventories, sample plots, research and (or) models. The 
inventory compilers should ensure that the models and forest inventory data have been appropriately 
documented and described in line with the requirements highlighted in Volume 1, Chapter 8. 
Change in biomass stocks on land before and after conversion, ∆C C ON VE R S I O N 
The calculations of biomass stocks before and after conversion should be made with the use of values consistent 
with other land uses. For example, comparable values of carbon stock should be used to estimate initial carbon 
stock for Grassland converted to Forest Land and for changes in biomass for Grassland Remaining Grassland. 
Tier 1 
No estimate of ∆CCONVERSION is required for Tier 1 calculations.  
Tier 2 
It is good practice to obtain and use, wherever possible, country-specific data on biomass stocks on land before 
and after conversion. The estimates should be consistent with those used in calculations of carbon stock changes 
in Cropland, Grassland, Wetlands, Settlements and Other Land, and should be obtained from national agencies 
or surveys. Tier 2 may imply the use of a combination of country-specific and default data. For default biomass 
stock values on land before the conversion, refer to other sections of this Volume. 
Tier 3 
Estimates and calculations should be performed based on forest inventory and or model data. Forest inventory, 
models and data should be documented in line with procedures outlined in Volume 1, Chapter 8. 
Change in carbon stocks in biomass due to losses, ∆C L 
Wood removal, fuelwood removal, and natural disturbances such as windfall, fires, and insect outbreaks result in 
loss of carbon on Land Converted to Forest Land that should be reported in accordance with good practice 
approach provided in Section 4.2.1. The good practice approach provided in Section 4.2.1 for estimating losses 
of carbon is fully applicable and should be used for appropriate calculations under Section 4.2.2. If changes in 
carbon stocks are derived from regular forest inventories, the losses from wood removal and disturbances will be 
covered without a need to report on them separately. It is good practice to ensure consistent reporting on losses 
of biomass between Sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 to avoid double counting or omissions. 
The data on logging of round wood should be taken from national sources or FAO. It should be noted that FAO 
data on logging is in merchantable round wood over bark. Bark fraction in harvested wood (BF) should be 
Chapter 4: Forest Land 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.33 
applied to account for bark in wood removals with harvest. If logging is significant in the country, the inventory 
compilers are encouraged to use national harvest data or derive country-specific BF values. 
In most countries, information on area disturbed is not likely to be available by the two sub-categories, Forest 
Land Remaining Forest Land and Land Converted to Forest Land sub-categories. Given that the latter is, in most 
cases, much smaller than the former, all disturbances can be applied to Forest Land Remaining Forest Land, or 
the disturbed area can be pro-rated in proportion to the two land sub-categories. 
Fuelwood consumption data are not normally reported separately for Forest Land Remaining Forest Land and 
Land Converted to Forest Land. Then it is likely that the default fuelwood data is likely to be reported in Forest 
Land Remaining Forest Land. The reporting of fuelwood should be cross-checked between the two land sub-
categories to avoid double counting by checking with reporting of fuelwood in Forest Land Remaining Forest 
Land. 
4.3.1.3 
CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
Area of land converted to forest, ∆A T O _ F O R E S T 
All tiers require information on areas converted to Forest Land over the 20 years prior to the inventory year. 
After 20 years or other time interval chosen, the lands converted to Forest Land, as defined in the country, 
should be transferred to and accounted for under Section 4.2 (Forest Land Remaining Forest Land). The same 
area data should be used for Sections 4.3.2 (Change in Carbon Stocks in Dead Organic Matter), Section 4.3.3 
(Change in Carbon Stocks in Soils), and Section 4.3.4 (Non-CO2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions). If possible, these 
areas should be further disaggregated to take into consideration major soil types and biomass densities on land 
before and after conversion. Box 4.3 gives examples of a good practice approach in identification of lands 
converted to Forest Land. Subject to national data availability, the inventory compilers can also choose good 
practice approach on the basis of approaches provided in Chapter 3. 
Different biomass growth rates should be used for calculations of biomass stocks for forests naturally re-growing 
on abandoned lands and for forest plantations. To undertake calculations under Tiers 2 and 3, inventory 
compilers are encouraged to obtain information on types of previous land uses for lands converted to Forest 
Land. 
Tier 1 
Activity data can be obtained through national statistics, from forestry agencies (information on areas of 
different management practices), conservation agencies (naturally regenerated areas), municipalities, survey and 
mapping agencies. Expert judgment may be used to assess whether new forests are predominantly intensively or 
extensively managed, if no recorded data are available. If the data on intensively and extensively managed areas 
of forests become available, these should be used for further partitioning areas to obtain more accurate estimates. 
Cross-checks should be applied to ensure complete and consistent representation of data to avoid omissions or 
double counting. If no country data are available, aggregate information can be obtained from international data 
sources (FAO, 2001; TBFRA, 2000).  
Tier 2 
Areas under different land uses subjected to conversion during a given year or over a period of years should be 
available. They can come from national data sources and a land-use change matrix or its equivalent that covers 
all possible transitions to Forest Land. Country-defined national data sets should have a resolution sufficient to 
ensure appropriate representation of land areas in line with provisions of Chapter 3 of this Volume. It is 
important to estimate area converted to forest through natural regeneration and plantation approach. 
Tier 3 
National activity data on land conversion to Forest Land through natural and artificial regeneration should be 
available from different sources, notably national forest inventories, registers of land use and land-use changes 
and remote sensing, as described in Chapter 3 of this Volume. These data should give a full accounting of all 
land-use transitions to Forest Land and can be further disaggregated along climate, soil, and vegetation types. 
Area under plantations is usually available according to species and age of the stand.

BOX 4.3 
EXAMPLES OF GOOD PRACTICE APPROACH IN IDENTIFICATION OF LANDS CONVERTED TO FOREST LAND 
National land management systems can allow for identification of land-use changes, and the land 
census systems implemented in many countries also enables consistent representation and timely 
tracking changes in land use. The national inventory compilers should take the data from land 
management systems or censuses and use them as the basis for identification of converted lands. 
The land conversion data may be obtained directly from companies, private owners, ministries and 
agencies, which undertake particular activities over converted lands. 
In some countries, special accounting systems have been designed to estimate emissions and 
removals over converted lands. The Australia National Carbon Accounting System (NCAS) 
<http://www.greenhouse.gov.au/> is an example of a good practice approach in identification of 
land conversion. The NCAS is a sophisticated model-based tool that comprises data from resource 
census, field studies, and remote sensing. It operates at high spatial and temporal scales. The 
NCAS addresses all sectors of activity in land systems, including carbon pools and all greenhouse 
gases as affected by human-induced activities. It allows for tracking afforestation and reforestation 
activities within the territory of the country along with estimating emissions and removals relevant 
to them. As soon as the new data enter the NCAS, the inventory data are updated continuously. 
Design and implementation of the NCAS and its components has been subjected to extensive peer 
review and Quality Assurance/Quality Control regime (AGO, 2002). 
Similar systems are being developed in New Zealand (Stephens et al., 2005; Trotter et al., 2005), 
Canada (Kurz and Apps, 2006), and other countries. The use of such land management systems 
contributes to development of high quality inventories and reduces the levels of uncertainty within 
the sector. 
4.3.1.4 
CALCULATION STEPS FOR TIER 1 
The following summarizes steps for estimating change in carbon stocks in biomass (∆C B) 
using the default methods 
Step 1: Estimate area converted to Forest Land (during the period 20 years before the year of the inventory) 
from other land-use categories such as Cropland, Grassland, and Settlements. Refer to Chapter 3 for detailed 
approaches for estimating Land Converted to Forest Land. 
Step 2: Disaggregate the area converted to Forest Land according to intensively managed forest (through 
plantation forestry) and extensively managed forest (through natural regeneration) based on the approach used 
for conversion. 
Step 3: Calculate the initial biomass loss associated with the land conversion, ∆CCONVERSION (Equation 2.16). 
This can be stratified by land conversion methods. 
Step 4: Estimate the annual increase in carbon stocks in biomass due to growth on Land Converted to Forest 
Land (∆CG), for intensively managed forests at species and other sub-category level, using Equations 2.9 and 
2.10 in Chapter 2. Estimate annual increment of biomass at species and other sub-category level.  
Step 5: Estimate the annual increase in carbon stocks in biomass growing on Land Converted to Forest Land 
(∆CG), for extensively managed forests at species and other sub-category level, using Equations 2.9 and 2.10 in 
Chapter 2. 
Step 6: Estimate annual loss or decrease in biomass (Lwood-removals) due to commercial fellings (industrial wood 
and sawn logs) using Equation 2.12 in Chapter 2. 
Step 7: Estimate biomass loss due to fuelwood removal (Lfuelwood) on Land Converted to Forest Land using 
Equation 2.13 in Chapter 2. 
Step 8: Estimate annual carbon loss due to disturbance or other losses (Ldisturbance) using Equation 2.14 in 
Chapter 2. 
Step 9: Estimate the total loss of biomass carbon due to wood removal, fuelwood removal, and disturbance 
(∆CL) using Equation 2.11 in Chapter 2. 
Step 10: Estimate the annual change in carbon stock in biomass (∆CB) on Land Converted to Forest Land using 
Equation 2.15 in Chapter 2.

Example. The following example shows Gain-Loss method (Tier 1) calculations of annual change 
in carbon stocks in biomass (∆CB in Equation 2.7, Chapter 2) for a hypothetical country in 
temperate continental forest zone of Europe (Table 4.1, Section 4.5). The area of non-forest land 
converted to Forest Land (A) within the country is 1,000 ha (see Chapter 3 for area categorization). 
The new forest is intensively managed 9-year-old pine plantation, average above-ground growing 
stock volume is 10 m3 ha-1. Thinning removed 100 m3 yr-1 of merchantable round wood over bark 
(H); 50 m3 yr-1 of whole trees (FGtrees) were removed as fuel wood. The area of insect disturbance 
(Adisturbance) is 50 ha yr-1 with 1.0 tonne d.m. ha-1 of above-ground biomass affected (BW). 
Annual gain in biomass (∆CG) is a product of mean annual biomass increment (GTOTAL), area of 
land converted to Forest Land (A) and carbon fraction of dry matter (CF), Equation 2.9, Chapter 2. 
GTOTAL is calculated using annual above-ground biomass increment (GW), below-ground biomass 
to above-ground biomass ratio (R), (Equation 2.10, Chapter 2) and default data tables, Section 4.5. 
For the hypothetical country,  
GW                  = 4.0 tonnes d.m. ha-1 yr-1 (Table 4.12); and 
R  
= 0.40 tonne d.m. (tonne d.m.)-1 for above-ground biomass <50 t ha-1 (Table 4.4, with 
reference to Table 4.8 for above-ground biomass). 
GTOTAL 
= 4.0 tonnes d.m. ha-1 yr-1 ● (1 + 0.40) = 5.6 tonnes d.m. ha-1 yr-1 (Equation 2.10) 
CF 
= 0.47 tonne C (tonne d.m.)-1 (Table 4.3) 
∆CG (Equation 2.9): = 1,000 ha ● 5.6 tonnes d.m. ha-1 yr-1 ● 0.47 tonne C (tonne d.m.)-1  
  
 
 = 2,632 tonnes C yr-1 
Biomass loss (∆CL) is a sum of annual loss due to wood removals (Lwood-removals), fuelwood 
removal (Lfuelwood) and disturbances (Ldisturbance), Equation 2.11, Chapter 2. 
Wood removals (Lwood-removals) is calculated using Equation 2.12 in Chapter 2 with merchantable 
round wood over bark (H), biomass conversion expansion factor (BCEFR), bark fraction in 
harvested wood (BF), below-ground biomass to above-ground biomass ratio (R), carbon fraction 
of dry matter (CF), and default tables in Section 4.5. For the hypothetical country, 
BCEFR 
= 2.0 tonnes d.m. m-3 (Table 4.5, with reference to volume of growing stock 10 
m3 ha-1); 
Default BEF 
= 0.1 tonne d.m. (tonne d.m.)-1; 
R  
= 0.40 tonne d.m. (tonne d.m.)-1 for above-ground biomass <50 t ha-1 (Table 
4.4, for above-ground biomass refer to Table 4.8); and 
CF 
 
= 0.47 tonne C (tonne d.m.)-1 (Table 4.3).  
Lwood-removals   = 100 m3 yr-1 ● 2 tonnes d.m. m-3 (1 + 0.40 + 0.1) ● 0.47 tonne C (tonne d.m.)-1  
  
   = 141 tonnes C yr-1 (Equation 2.12) 
Fuelwood removal (Lfuelwood) is calculated using Equation 2.13, Chapter 2 with wood removals as 
whole trees (FGtrees), biomass conversion expansion factor (BCEFR), below-ground biomass to 
above-ground biomass ratio (R), carbon fraction of dry matter (CF), and default tables in Section 
4.5. For the hypothetical country,  
BCEFR 
= 2.0 tonnes d.m. m-3 (Table 4.5, with reference to growing stock volume 10 m3 ha-1);  
R  
= 0.40 tonne d.m. (tonne d.m.)-1 for above-ground biomass <50 t ha-1 (Table 4.4, with 
reference to Table 4.8 for above-ground biomass); and 
CF 
= 0.47 tonne C (tonne d.m.)-1 (Table 4.3).  
Lfuelwood 
= 50 m3 yr-1 ● 2.0 tonnes d.m. m-3 (1 + 0.40) ● 0.47 tonne C (tonne d.m.)-1  
  
= 65.80 tonnes C yr-1 (Equation 2.13)

Annual carbon loss in biomass due to disturbances (Ldisturbance) is calculated using Equation 2.14, 
Chapter 2 with area of disturbances (Adisturbance), average above-ground biomass affected (BW), 
below-ground biomass to above-ground biomass ratio (R), carbon fraction of dry matter (CF), 
fraction of biomass lost in disturbance (fd), and default tables in Section 4.5. For the hypothetical 
country,  
fd 
= 0.3; 
R  
= 0.40 tonne d.m. (tonne d.m.)-1 for above-ground biomass <50 t ha-1 (Table 4.4, with 
reference to Table 4.8 for above-ground biomass); and 
CF 
= 0.47 tonne C (tonne d.m.)-1 (Table 4.3). 
Ldisturbance = 50 ha yr-1 ● 1.0 tonne d.m. ha-1 (1 + 0.40) ● 0.47 tonne C (tonne d.m.)-1 ● 0.3 
  
= 9.87 tonnes C yr-1 (Equation 2.14) 
Annual decrease in carbon stocks due to biomass losses (∆CL), 
∆CL 
= 141.00 tonnes C yr-1 + 65.80 tonnes C yr-1 + 9.87 tonnes C yr-1  
  
= 216.67 tonnes C yr-1 (Equation 2.11) 
Annual change in carbon stocks in biomass (∆CB) 
Using Chapter 2, Equation 2.7 (∆CB = (∆CG – ∆CL)), 
∆CB = 2,632 tonnes C yr-1 – 216.67 tonnes C yr-1 = 2,415.33 tonnes C yr-1 (Equation 2.7) 
 
4.3.1.5 
UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT 
The emission factors required for estimating carbon stock changes for Land Converted to Forest Land are nearly 
identical to those required for Forest Land Remaining Forest Land, but refer to lands converted to forests within 
20 years of the inventory year (default period of conversion).  The discussion on uncertainty for Forest Land 
Remaining Forest Land also applies here. The uncertainty involved in the estimation of biomass stocks on land 
before and after conversion is likely to be high. This uncertainty can be reduced by conducting sample field 
studies in dominant land-use categories subjected to conversion to Forest Land. The uncertainty is likely to be 
low for the wood removal (industrial round wood), since national statistics are likely to be maintained on 
commercial harvests, although sometimes it may be difficult to separate commercial harvests due to 
deforestation from those that come from Forest Land Remaining Forest Land. However, the uncertainty is likely 
to be high for fuelwood removal and gathering and biomass loss due to disturbance. The uncertainty involved for 
commercial and traditional methods should be reduced by conducting sample surveys in different socio-
economic and climatic regions.   
The critical activity data required for estimating carbon stock changes include the area of land converted and loss 
rates of biomass during the initial conversion and thereafter. The level of uncertainty for area under intensive and 
extensive plantations is likely to be low since most countries maintain records of the area afforested and 
reforested. The uncertainty should be reduced by developing a land-use change matrix of Forest Land 
Remaining Forest Land and for different categories of Land Converted to Forest Land, based on remote sensing 
or other monitoring techniques. A combination of remote sensing and ground surveys could have an uncertainty 
as low as 10-15%. 
4.3.2 
Dead organic matter 
In this section, changes in carbon stock in dead organic matter pools are discussed for the land-use category 
Land Converted to Forest Land. Cropland, Grassland, Settlements, and other land-use categories can be 
potentially converted to Forest Land through planting or natural regeneration. It is likely that most non-forest 
land will not have significant dead wood or litter carbon pools. Accordingly, the Tier 1 assumption is that carbon 
stocks in dead wood and litter pools in non-forest land are zero, and that carbon in dead organic matter pools 
increases linearly to the value of mature forests over a specified time period (default = 20 years). The Tier 1 
assumption for the conversion of unmanaged to managed Forest Land is that the dead organic matter carbon 
stocks in unmanaged forests are similar to those of managed forests and that no carbon stock changes need to be 
reported. In reality, other things being equal, dead organic matter carbon stocks in unmanaged forests are higher 
than those in managed forests because harvest removes woody biomass that would otherwise contribute to long-

4.37 
term dynamics of DOM pools (Kurz et al., 1998) and it is good practice that countries with high rates of 
conversion of unmanaged to managed forests use higher Tier methods to estimate the resulting changes in DOM 
carbon stocks.  
Methods to estimate emissions and removals of carbon in dead organic matter pools following conversion of 
land to Forest Land require estimates of the carbon stocks just prior to and just following the conversion, and 
estimates of the areas of lands converted during the inventory period. Some of the non-forest land-use categories, 
such as Wetlands, Settlements, Cropland and Grassland can have significant carbon stock in the DOM pools. It 
is good practice to assess whether the assumption of zero DOM pool sizes is justified for lands converted to 
Forest Land. Higher Tier methods can specify the initial DOM pool sizes (e.g., in some land-use categories dead 
wood and litter pools are non-zero) and quantify the length of the transition period (default = 20 years) during 
which DOM pools are changing as a result of a transition to Forest Land. 
4.3.2.1 
CHOICE OF METHOD 
The general methods for estimating changes in carbon stock in dead organic matter pools have been described in 
Chapter 2, Section 2.3.2. The decision tree in Figure 1.3 in Chapter 1 provides guidance in the selection of the 
appropriate tier level for the implementation of estimation procedures. Dead wood and litter carbon stock 
estimates often differ significantly depending on previous land use, forest type, and regeneration type.  
Tier 1 
For Land Converted to Forest Land, the Tier 1 assumption is that dead wood and litter pools increase linearly 
from zero (in the non-forest land-use category) to the default values for the climate region over a period of T 
years (the current default is 20 years for both litter and dead wood carbon pools). Human activities such as 
fuelwood collection and some silvicultural practices such as frequent thinnings can greatly affect the rate of 
carbon accumulation in dead wood and litter pools. It is good practice to assess whether the default pool sizes 
and the assumed transitions periods are reasonable given a country’s climatic and management regimes. The 20-
year default period is appropriate for litter pools but likely too short for dead wood pools, particularly in colder 
regions with slow growing vegetation. If the time required to accumulate DOM pools is longer than the default 
period, then the Tier 1 assumptions may overestimate the rates of carbon accumulation. Where the area involved 
in land-use conversion to forests is large, it is good practice to develop national estimates of the rates of litter 
and dead wood carbon accumulation in lands converted to Forest Land.  
Tiers 2 and 3 
Changes in carbon stock in dead wood and litter pools under a Tier 2 or Tier 3 can be estimated using the two 
methods outlined in Chapter 2 (Equations 2.18 and 2.19 in Chapter 2).  It is good practice to stratify areas 
converted to Forest Land according to the prior land use, the methods used during the conversion (e.g., site 
preparation, treatment of residual biomass), and the productivity and characteristics of the forest that is 
regrowing.  All of these factors influence the magnitude and rate of change of carbon stock in the DOM pools on 
Land Converted to Forest Land. 
Countries using higher Tier methods are also encouraged to select more appropriate transition periods for litter 
and dead wood carbon stocks. Litter pools can stabilize relatively quickly as inputs balance outputs. Dead wood 
pools generally require much longer transition periods from non-forest to forest conditions. Moreover, both litter 
and dead wood carbon stock sizes are affected by many factors and countries using higher Tiers are encouraged 
to select DOM stock values at maturity that adequately reflect national circumstances. Countries using Tier 3 
modeling approaches will obtain estimates of dead organic matter stocks based on the simulated balance of input 
and losses. 
4.3.2.2 
CHOICE OF EMISSION/REMOVAL FACTORS 
Tier 1 
Countries using a Tier 1 method require data on the default dead wood and litter carbon stocks in the six land-
use categories in different climatic regions, as defined in Table 3.1, Chapter 3. The Tier 1 assumption is that 
carbon stocks in litter and dead wood pools in all non-forest land-use categories are zero. For lands converted to 
Forest Land, the carbon stocks in dead wood and litter pools are assumed to increase linearly over the transition 
period T (default is 20 years for both litter and dead wood C stocks). Thus, the annual rate of increase is 
estimated as the ratio between the difference in carbon stocks in the DOM pools in the non-forest and forest 
categories, and the number of years in the transition period T. 
Tiers 2 and 3 
The higher Tier methods described in Chapter 4, Section 4.2 Forest Land Remaining Forest Land are equally 
applicable to Land Converted to Forest Land. Additional emission and removal factors are required where the 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
4.38 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
impacts of the land-use conversion practices (e.g., site preparation and slash burning) are to be estimated. 
Additional requirements may arise if the assumption that carbon stocks in dead wood and litter pools of non-
forest land-use categories are zero cannot be justified, such as in some agro-forestry systems, in settlements with 
substantial forest cover, and in other circumstances. This may pose special challenges because forest inventories 
typically do not include such areas and other data sources need to be identified or measurement programs 
implemented.  
4.3.2.3 
CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
The Tier 1 method requires activity data on the annual rate of conversion to Forest Land. Activity data should be 
consistent with those used for estimating changes in carbon stock in biomass on Land Converted to Forest Land, 
according to the general principles set out in Chapter 3. Activity data can be obtained from national statistics, 
from forest management agencies, conservation agencies, municipalities, survey and mapping agencies. Where 
reporting programs are used, it is good practice to implement verification procedures and cross-checks to ensure 
complete and consistent representation of Land Converted to Forest Land, to avoid omissions or double counting. 
Data should be disaggregated according to the general climatic categories and forest types.  
Inventories using higher Tiers will require more comprehensive information on the establishment of new forests, 
with refined soil classes, climate, and spatial and temporal resolution.  
All changes in dead organic matter pools occurring over the number of years (T) selected as the transition period 
should be included. Lands where the transitions occurred more than T years ago are transferred to and reported 
under the category Forest Land Remaining Forest Land.  
4.3.2.4 
CALCULATION STEPS FOR TIER 1 
The following summarizes steps for estimating change in carbon stocks in dead organic 
matter using the default methods 
Step 1: Estimate area converted to Forest Land (during the period 20 years prior to the year of inventory) from 
other land-use categories such as Cropland, Grassland and Settlements. Refer to Chapter 3 for detailed 
approaches for estimating Land Converted to Forest Land. 
Step 2: The Tier 1 assumption is that dead organic matter (dead wood and litter) carbon stocks on non-forest 
land are zero. If national data on dead wood and litter carbon stocks in non-forest land are available, 
disaggregate the area converted to Forest Land according to the land-use category of origin, e.g., Grassland, 
Cropland, etc., using the same categories for which dead organic matter estimates are available. Default values 
for litter carbon stocks in Forest Land are provided in Table 2.2. Statistically valid, regional default estimates for 
dead wood carbon stocks in forests are not available. 
Step 3: Estimate the average annual increment of dead organic matter stocks, separately for dead wood and 
litter, by dividing the difference in pre- and post-conversion carbon stocks by the time period of transition 
(Equation 2.23 in Chapter 2). The default Tier 1 assumption is that non-forest dead organic matter carbon stocks 
are zero and that the period of transition is 20 years.    
Step 4: Estimate the annual change in carbon stock in dead organic matter on Land Converted to Forest Land 
by multiplying the average annual increment (Step 3) by the area of lands converted to Forest Land over the past 
20 (default) years.  
4.3.2.5 
UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT 
In general, the magnitude of uncertainty in dead organic matter pools is larger than the uncertainty in biomass 
estimates because much less data are typically available for DOM pools compared to biomass pools. 
Uncertainties in area estimates made using the approaches suggested in Chapter 3 are indicated in Table 3.7 and 
uncertainties in assessing dead organic matter carbon stock changes may be several times larger than the 
uncertainty of biomass stock change estimates using default coefficients.  
Although relatively few estimates of uncertainty, in changes in carbon stock in DOM pools, are available in the 
literature or elsewhere, several sources of uncertainty can be identified for the estimates of changes in carbon 
stock in dead organic matter pools on Land Converted to Forest Land. First, the assumption that carbon stocks in 
DOM are zero in non-forest land is not always justified. Underestimating the true initial DOM stock size will 
lead to overestimates of the true accumulation rates. Second, the default values for litter and dead wood carbon 
stock sizes are likely to be biased by being based upon estimates from land that was Forest Land for a long 
period of time. Thus the stock sizes at the end of the transition period may be overestimated, again, leading to 
Chapter 4: Forest Land 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.39 
overestimates of the accumulation rates. Third, the default transition period may be too long for litter carbon 
stocks, leading to underestimates of the true accumulation rates. For the dead wood pool, however, the current 
default assumption of a 20-year transition period is likely to be too short. Thus, the rate of carbon accumulation 
in the dead wood pool may be overestimated.  
4.3.3 
Soil carbon 
Land conversions on mineral soils generally either maintain similar levels of C storage or create conditions that 
increase soil C stocks, particularly if the land was previously managed for annual crop production (Post and 
Kwon, 2000). However, under certain circumstances, Grassland conversion to Forest Land has been shown to 
cause small C losses in mineral soils for several decades following conversion (Davis and Condron, 2002; Paul 
et al., 2002).  Emissions of C from organic soils will vary depending on the previous use and level of drainage.  
Specifically, conversion from Cropland will tend to decrease emissions; conversions from Grassland will likely 
maintain similar emission rates; while conversion from Wetlands often increases C emissions.    
General information and guidelines on estimating changes soil C stocks are found in Section 2.3.3 in Chapter 2 
(including equations), and need to be read before proceeding with guidelines dealing with forest soil C stocks. 
The total change in soil C stocks for Land Converted to Forest Land is computed using Equation 2.24 (Chapter 
2), which combines the change in soil organic C stocks for mineral soils and organic soils; and carbon stock 
changes for inorganic soil C pools (Tier 3 only).  This section provides specific guidance for estimating soil 
organic C stock changes; see Section 2.3.3.1 (Chapter 2) for general discussion on soil inorganic C (no 
additional information is provided in the Forest Land discussion below). 
To account for changes in soil C stocks associated with Land Converted to Forest Land, countries need to have, 
at a minimum, estimates of the areas of Land Converted to Forest Land during the inventory time period, 
stratified by climate region and soil type. If land-use and management data are limited, Approach 1 activity data 
can be used as a starting point, along with knowledge of country experts of the approximate distribution of land-
use types being converted.  If previous lands uses and conversions for Land Converted to Forest Land are 
unknown, SOC stocks changes can still be computed using the methods provided in Forest Land Remaining 
Forest Land, but the land base will likely be different for forests in the current year relative to the initial year in 
the inventory.  It is critical, however, that the total land area across all land-use sectors be equal over the 
inventory time period (e.g., if 5 Million ha is converted from Cropland and Grassland to Forest Land during the 
inventory time period, then Forest Land will have an additional 5 Million ha in the last year of the inventory, 
while Cropland and Grassland will have a corresponding loss of 5 Million ha in the last year), and the total 
change will be estimated when summing SOC stocks across all land uses.  Land Converted to Forest Land is 
stratified according to climate regions and major soil types, which could either be based on default or country-
specific classifications.  This can be accomplished with overlays of climate and soil maps, coupled with 
spatially-explicit data on the location of land conversions. 
Inventories can be developed using Tier 1, 2 or 3 approaches, with each successive Tier requiring more detail 
and resources than the previous.  It is possible that countries will use different tiers to prepare estimates for the 
separate components in this source category (i.e., soil organic C stocks changes in mineral soils and organic soils; 
and stock changes associated with soil inorganic C pools).   
4.3.3.1 
CHOICE OF METHOD 
Inventories can be developed using Tier 1, 2 or 3 approaches and countries may choose different tiers for mineral 
and organic soils.  Decision trees are provided for mineral (Figure 2.4) and organic soils (Figure 2.5) in Section 
2.3.3.1 (Chapter 2) to assist inventory compilers with selection of the appropriate tier for their soil C inventory. 
Mineral soils 
Tier 1 
Change in soil organic C stocks can be estimated for mineral soils with land-use conversion to Forest Land using 
Equation 2.25 (Chapter 2).  For Tier 1, the initial (pre-conversion) soil organic C stock (SOC(0-T)) and C stock in 
the last year of the inventory time period (SOC0) are determined from the common set of reference soil organic 
C stocks (SOCREF) and default stock change factors (FLU, FMG, FI) as appropriate for describing land use and 
management both pre- and post-conversion. Note that area of exposed bedrock in Forest Land or the previous 
land use are not included in the soil C stock calculation (assume a stock of 0).  Annual rates of stock changes are 
calculated as the difference in stocks (over time) divided by the time dependence (D) of the stock change factors 
(default is 20 years).   
 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
4.40 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Tier 2 
The Tier 2 approach for mineral soils also uses Equation 2.25 (Chapter 2), but involves country or region-
specific reference C stocks and/or stock change factors and possibly more disaggregated land-use activity and 
environmental data.   
Tier 3 
Tier 3 approaches will involve more detailed and country-specific models and/or measurement-based approaches 
along with highly disaggregated land-use and management data. It is good practice that Tier 3 approaches 
estimating soil C change from land-use conversions to Forest Land, employ models, monitoring networks and/or 
data sets that are capable of representing transitions over time from other land uses, including Grassland, 
Cropland, and possibly Settlements or other land uses. It is important that models be evaluated with independent 
observations from country or region-specific field locations that are representative of the interactions of climate, 
soil and forest type/management on post-conversion change in soil C stocks. 
Organic soils 
Tier 1 and Tier 2 
Land Converted to Forest Land on organic soils within the inventory time period is treated the same as Forest 
Land Remaining Forest Land on organic soils. C losses for the newly converted Forest Land are computed using 
Equation 2.26 (Chapter 2) if the soils are drained.  Additional guidance on the Tiers 1 and 2 approaches are 
given in Section 4.3.3.1.  
Tier 3 
Similar to mineral soils, a Tier 3 approach will involve country-specific models and/or measurement-based 
approaches along with highly disaggregated land-use and management data (see mineral soils above for 
additional discussion).  
4.3.3.2 
CHOICE OF STOCK CHANGE AND EMISSION FACTORS 
Mineral soils 
Tier 1 
For native unmanaged land, as well as for managed Forest Land, Settlements and nominally managed Grassland 
with low disturbance regimes, soil C stocks are assumed equal to the reference values (i.e., land use, disturbance 
(forests only), management and input factors equal 1), but it will be necessary to apply the appropriate stock 
change factors to represent other systems which may be converted to Forest Land, such as improved and 
degraded Grassland, as well as all Cropland systems.  See the appropriate land-use section for default stock 
change factors (Forest Land in 4.2.3.2, Cropland in Section 5.2.3.2, Grassland in 6.2.3.2, Settlements in 8.2.3.2, 
and Other Land in 9.3.3.2). Default reference C stocks are found in Table 2.3 (Chapter 2). 
Tier 2 
Estimation of country-specific stock change factors is probably the most important development associated with 
the Tier 2 approach.  Differences in soil organic C stocks among land uses are computed relative to a reference 
condition.  If default reference C stocks are used, the reference condition is native vegetation that is neither 
degraded nor improved through land-use and management practices. Stock change factors for land-use 
conversion to native forests will be equal to 1 if the forest represents the reference condition.  However, stock 
change factors will need to be derived for Land Converted to Forest Land that do not represent the reference 
condition, accounting for the influence of disturbance (FD), input (FI) and management (FMG), which are then 
used to further refine the C stocks of the new forest system.  See the appropriate section for specific information 
regarding the derivation of stock change factors for other land-use sectors (Cropland in 5.2.3.2, Grassland in 
Section 6.2.3.2, Settlements in 8.2.3.2, and Other Land in 9.3.3.2). 
Reference C stocks can also be derived from country-specific data in a Tier 2 approach.  However, reference 
values should be consistent across the land uses (i.e., Forest Land, Cropland, Grassland, Settlements, Other 
Land), and thus must be coordinated among the various teams conducting soil C inventories for AFOLU.   
Tier 3 
Constant stock change rate factors per se are less likely to be estimated in favor of variable rates that more 
accurately capture land-use and management effects.  See Section 2.3.3.1 (Chapter 2) for further discussion. 
Organic soils 
Tier 1 and Tier 2 
Land Converted to Forest Land on organic soils within the inventory time period is treated the same as Forest 
Land Remaining Forest Land on organic soils, i.e., they have a constant emission factor applied to them, based 
Chapter 4: Forest Land 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.41 
on climate regime. Tier 1 emission factors are given in Table 4.6 (Section 4.5), while Tier 2 emission factors are 
derived from country or region-specific data.  
Tier 3 
Constant emission rate factors per se are less likely to be estimated in favor of variable rates that more accurately 
capture land-use and management effects. See Section 2.3.3.1 in Chapter 2 for further discussion.  
4.3.3.3 
CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA  
Mineral soils 
Tier 1 and Tier 2 
For purposes of estimating soil carbon stock change, area estimates of Land Converted to Forest Land should be 
stratified according to major climate regions and soil types. This can be based on overlays with suitable climate 
and soil maps and spatially-explicit data of the location of land conversions. Detailed descriptions of the default 
climate and soil classification schemes are provided in Chapter 3. Specific information is provided in the each of 
the land-use sections regarding treatment of land-use/management activity data (Forest Land in Section 4.2.3.3, 
Cropland in 5.2.3.3, Grassland in 6.2.3.3, Settlements in 8.2.3.3, and Other Land in 9.3.3.3). 
One critical issue in evaluating the impact of Land Converted to Forest Land on soil organic C stocks is the type 
of land-use and management activity data.  Activity data gathered using Approach 2 or 3 (see Chapter 3 for 
discussion about Approaches) provide the underlying basis for determining the previous land use for Land 
Converted to Forest Land.  In contrast, aggregate data (Approach 1, Chapter 3) only provide the total amount of 
area in each land use and do not form a basis for determining specific transitions.  Therefore, the previous land 
use before conversion to Forest Land will be unknown. This is not problematic using Tier 1 or 2 methods 
because the calculation is not dynamic and assumes a step change from one equilibrium state to another.  With 
aggregate data (Approach 1), changes in soil organic C stocks may be computed separately for each land-use 
sector and then combined to obtain the total stock change.  Some of the stock changes will result from less or 
more land area in a particular sector, but such changes in the land base will be counter-balanced by a 
concomitant increase or decrease in land area for another sector.  Using this approach, it will be necessary for 
coordination among each sector to ensure the total land base is remaining constant over time, given that some 
land area will be lost and gained within individual sectors during each inventory year due to land-use change. 
Tier 3 
For application of dynamic models and/or a direct measurement-based inventory in Tier 3, similar or more 
detailed data on the combinations of climate, soil, topographic and management data are needed, relative to Tier 
1 or 2 method, but the exact requirements will be dependent on the model or measurement design.    
Organic soils 
Tier 1 and Tier 2 
Land Converted to Forest Land on organic soils within the inventory time period is treated the same as Forest 
Land Remaining Forest Land on organic soils; see Section 4.2.3.3.  
Tier 3 
Similar to mineral soils, Tier 3 approaches will likely require more detailed data on the combinations of climate, 
soil, topographic and management data, relative to Tier 1 or 2 methods, but the exact requirements will be 
dependent on the model or measurement design.

The steps for estimating SOC0 and SOC(0-T) and net soil C stock change per ha of Land Converted to Forest 
Land are as follows: 
Step 1: Determine the land-use and management by mineral soil types and climate regions for land at the 
beginning of the inventory period, which can vary depending on the time step of the activity data (0-T; e.g., 5, 10 
or 20 years ago). 
Step 2: Select the native reference C stock value (SOCREF), based on climate and soil type from Table 2.3, for 
each area of land being inventoried.  The reference C stocks are the same for all land-use categories to ensure 
that erroneous changes in the C stocks are not computed due to differences in reference stock values among 
sectors. 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
4.42 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Step 3: Select the land-use factor (FLU), management factor (FMG) and C input levels (FI) representing the land-
use and management system present before conversion to forest.  Values for FLU, FMG and FI are given in the 
respective section for the land-use sector (Cropland in Chapter 5, and Grassland in Chapter 6).   
Step 4: Multiply these values by the reference soil C stock to estimate of ‘initial’ soil organic C stock (SOC(0-T)) 
for the inventory time period.    
Step 5: Estimate SOC0 by repeating step 1 to 4 using the same native reference C stock (SOCREF), but with land-
use, management and input factors that represent conditions in the last (year 0) inventory year. For Tier 1, all 
stock change factors are assumed equal to 1 for Forest Land (although for Tier 2, different values for these 
factors under newly converted Forest Land should be used, based on country-specific data). 
Step 6: Estimate the average annual change in soil C stock for the area over the inventory time period, 
∆CCCMineral, (see Equation 2.25 in Chapter 2). 
Step 7: Repeat Steps 1 to 6 if there are additional inventory time periods (e.g., 1990 to 2000, 2001 to 2010, etc.). 
A numerical example is given below for afforestation of cropland soil.  
Example: An area of 100,000 ha of cropland was planted to forest.  The soil type is an Ultisol in a 
tropical moist climate, which has a native reference stock, SOCRef (0-30 cm), of 47 tonnes C ha-1 
(Table 2.3). The previous land use was annual row crops, with conventional tillage, no fertilization 
and where crop residues are removed, so that the soil carbon stock at the beginning of the 
inventory time period (in this example, 5 yrs earlier in 1995) was (SOCRef ● FLU ● FMG ● FI) = 47 
tonnes C ha-1 ● 0.48 ● 1 ● 0.92 = 20.8 tonnes C ha-1 (see Table 5.5, Chapter 5, for stock change 
factor for cropland). Under Tier 1, managed forest is assumed to have the same soil C stock as the 
reference condition (i.e. all stock change factors are equal to 1). Thus, the average annual change 
in soil C stock for the area over the inventory time period is estimated as (47 tonnes C ha-1 – 20.8 
tonnes C ha-1) / 20 yrs = 1.3 tonnes C ha-1 yr-1.  For the area reforested there is an increase of 
131,000 tonnes C yr-1. (Note: 20 years is the time dependence of the stock change factor, i.e., 
factor represents annual rate of change over 20 years) 
 
 
Organic soils 
Calculation steps are the same as described in Section 4.2.3.4 above. 
4.3.3.5 
UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT 
Uncertainty analyses for Land Converted to Forest Land are fundamentally the same as Forest Land Remaining 
Forest Land.  Three broad sources of uncertainty exists: 1) uncertainties in land-use and management activity 
and environmental data; 2) uncertainties in reference soil C stocks if using Tier 1 or 2 approaches (mineral soils 
only); and 3) uncertainties in the stock change/emission factors for Tier 1 or 2 approaches, model 
structure/parameter error for Tier 3 model-based approaches, or measurement error/sampling variability 
associated with a Tier 3 measurement-based inventories.  See the uncertainty section in Forest Land Remaining 
Forest Land for additional discussion (Section 4.2.3.5). 
4.3.4 
Non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions from biomass 
burning 
The guidance to estimate non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions from biomass burning or fire on Land Converted to 
Forest Land is discussed in Section 4.2.4. General guidance is also provided in Chapter 2, Section 2.4. 
Guidance for estimating N2O emissions from forest soils is provided in Chapter 11.

COMPLETENESS, TIME SERIES, QA/QC, AND 
REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION 
4.4.1 
Completeness 
Completeness is a requirement for greenhouse gas inventories, and it is good practice to address all forest carbon 
gains and losses including harvested wood products. Greenhouse gas inventory for Forest Land should include 
all land under Forest Land and all land-use categories converted to Forest Land. For completeness, it is good 
practice to include all the carbon pools and non-CO2 greenhouse gases. Chapter 11, Section 11.2 provides advice 
on N2O emission from drained organic soils. The forest area used for calculation for different carbon pools 
should be the same. Emissions from organic soils and emissions or removals attributed to land-use change on 
mineral soils should be estimated. Higher tiers include additional impacts of management and natural 
disturbance regimes on mineral soil C stocks or emissions from organic soils, by incorporating country-specific 
information. A complete accounting of emissions and removals of CO2 associated with Forest Land Remaining 
Forest Land and Land Converted to Forest Land, or from the effects of biomass burning in managed (and 
unmanaged, when applicable) Forest Land is necessary. It is good practice that all losses from biomass carbon 
pools that result in transfers to dead organic matter pools are first accounted as changes to biomass carbon stocks. 
It is good practice that countries using Tier 1 estimation methods do not account for carbon emissions from 
DOM pools during fire or other disturbances because all DOM pool additions are assumed to have been released 
in the year of addition. Consequently, Tier 1 methods also preclude the accounting of DOM pool increases 
following natural disturbances.  
4.4.2 
Developing a consistent times series 
It is good practice to develop a consistent time series of inventories of anthropogenic emissions and removals of 
greenhouse gases for all AFOLU categories using the guidance in Volume 1, Chapter 5. Because activity data 
may only be available every few years, achieving time series consistency may require interpolation or 
extrapolation from longer time series or trends, possibly using information on changes in forest policies and 
incentive schemes where drivers are needed.  
Consistent accounting over time of land areas included in biomass and soil C emissions and removals inventory 
requires that activity data for all land-use categories be stratified by a common definition of climate and soil 
types. Thus, areas subject to land-use change will not be lost or double-counted due to accounting errors 
resulting from inconsistent definitions for climate and forest types and soil strata within other land-use categories. 
To estimate emissions and removals of greenhouse gases, whether by Tier 1, 2 or 3, ideally the same protocol 
(sampling strategy, method, etc.) should be applied consistently every year in the time series, at the same level of 
disaggregation, and, where country-specific data are used, it is good practice to use the same coefficients and 
methods for equivalent calculations at all points in the time series.  
However, as inventory capacity and information and data sources availability improve over time, new sources 
and sink categories should be included, or moving to higher tier, the methods and data used to calculate 
estimates can be updated and refined. In these circumstances, consistent recalculation of historical emissions and 
removals is a good practice. In some cases, if some historical data are missing, then they may need to be 
estimated from other data sources. For example, the 2006 IPCC Guidelines now require estimation of emissions 
of CO2 and non-CO2 from forests, which were not included under the 1966 Guidelines (refer to Chapter 1). The 
level of knowledge and detail of emission estimates for soils will also improve over time, necessitating 
recalculation of historic inventories to take account of new data and/or methods. Often, changes in forest soils 
cannot be detected at time scale finer than a decade; it will be necessary to interpolate between measurements in 
order to obtain annual estimates of emissions and removals. Changes in forest types, practices and disturbances 
need to be tracked for long time periods determined for example by soil carbon dynamics or forest rotation periods 
where these are specifically tracked in detailed model calculations.  
Where countries use Tier 1 methods, estimates of DOM stock changes are only provided in the case of land-use 
change to or from Forest Land. It is good practice to recalculate the entire time series of data if either the default 
values for litter and dead wood carbon pools or the lengths of the transition periods are changed. It is also good 
practice to recalculate the entire time series of estimates if revisions to activity data, such as the rate of land-use 
change, have occurred. As more ground plot and other sample data on dead wood and litter carbon stocks become 
available in the future, countries are likely to improve the models used in higher Tier estimation procedures. It is 
good practice to use the same model parameter values (such as litterfall rates, decay rates, disturbance impacts) for 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
4.44 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
the entire time series and to recalculate the entire time series if one or more of the model parameters have changed. 
Failure to do so may result in artificial sources or sinks, for example as a result of decay rate modifications.  
4.4.3 
Quality Assurance and Quality Control 
The characteristics of the greenhouse gas inventory estimate of Forest Land can have different level of precision, 
accuracy and levels of bias. Moreover, the estimates are influenced by the quality and consistency of data and 
information available in a country, as well as gaps in knowledge. In addition, depending on the tier level used by 
a country, estimates can be affected by different sources of errors, such as sampling errors, assessment errors, 
classification errors in remote sensing imagery, and modeling errors that can propagate to the total estimation.  
It is good practice to execute quality control checks through Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) 
procedures, and expert review of the emission estimation procedures. Additional quality control checks as 
outlined in Tier 2 procedures in Volume 1, Chapter 6, and quality assurance procedures may also be applicable, 
particularly if higher Tier methods are used to estimate emissions. It is good practice to supplement the general 
QA/QC related to data processing, handling, and reporting and documenting, with source-specific category 
procedures. QA/QC procedures should be documented separately for Forest Land Remaining Forest Land and 
for Land Converted to Forest Land.  
Agencies which collect data are responsible for reviewing the data collection methods, checking the data to 
ensure that they are collected and aggregated or disaggregated correctly, and cross-checking the data with other 
data sources and with previous years to ensure that the data are realistic, complete and consistent over time. FAO 
data needs to cross checked with other national sources for accuracy and consistency. The basis for the estimates 
(e.g., statistical surveys or ´desk estimates´) must be reviewed and described as part of the QC process. 
Documentation is a crucial component of the review process because it enables reviewers to identify inaccuracy, 
gaps and suggest improvements. Documentation and transparency in reporting is most important for highly 
uncertain source categories and to give reasons for divergences between country-specific factors and default or 
factors used by other countries. Countries with similar (ecological) conditions are encouraged to collaborate in 
the refinements of methods, emissions factors and uncertainty assessment. 
Activity data check: The inventory agency should, where possible, check data comprising of all managed land 
areas, using independent sources and compare them. For many countries, FAO database could be the main 
source and in such a case the data must be cross-checked with other sources. Any differences in area records 
should be documented for the purposes of review. Activity data area totals should be summed across all land-use 
categories to ensure that total area involved in the inventory and its stratification across climate and soil types 
remains constant over time. This ensures that Forest Land areas are neither ‘created’ nor ‘lost’ over time, which 
would result in major errors in the inventory. When using country-specific data (such as data on standing 
biomass and biomass growth rates, carbon fraction in above-ground biomass and biomass expansion factors, and 
synthetic fertilizer consumption estimates), the inventory agency should compare them to the IPCC default 
values or the Emission Factor Database (EFDB) and note the differences. 
The country-specific parameters should be of high quality, preferably peer-reviewed experimental data, 
adequately described, and documented. The agencies performing the inventory are encouraged to ensure that 
good practice methods have been used and the results peer-reviewed. Assessments on test areas can be used to 
validate the reliability of figures reported.  
Internal and external review: The review processes as set out in Volume 1, Chapter 8 should be undertaken by 
experts preferably not directly involved in the inventory development. The inventory agency should utilize 
experts in greenhouse gas removals and emissions in AFOLU to conduct expert peer-review of the methods and 
data used. Given the complexity and uniqueness of the parameters used in calculating country-specific factors 
for some categories, selected specialists in the field should be involved in such reviews. If soil factors are based 
on direct measurements, the inventory agency should review the measurements to ensure that they are 
representative of the actual range of environmental and soil management conditions, and inter-annual climatic 
variability, and were developed according to recognized standards. The QA/QC protocol in effect at the sites 
should also be reviewed and the resulting estimates compared between sites and with default-based estimates. 
It is good practice that countries using Tier 1 methods review and, if necessary, revise the default assumptions 
for carbon stocks in litter and dead wood pools which are required for estimation of carbon losses following 
deforestation. Countries that use higher tier methods are encouraged to calculate intermediate indicators of the 
models used to develop estimates of DOM stock changes. For example, QA/QC procedures could compare 
estimates of stock sizes, litterfall inputs, decay losses, etc., against literature values and other peer-reviewed 
publications. Where possible, it is also good practice to compare model estimates against field measurements 
and other data sources. One QA/QC check that is easily implemented in modelling systems is to calculate an 
internal mass balance to ensure that the model neither produces nor loses carbon that is not reported as a source 
Chapter 4: Forest Land 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.45 
or a sink. For example, conservation of mass requirements include that losses from biomass pools are either 
accounted as input to the DOM pools, are transferred outside of the forest ecosystem or released to the 
atmosphere (in case of fire). Further, harvest data can be used to check transfer (stop loss) estimates produced by 
models. A second QA/QC procedure that can be implemented in countries that use higher Tier estimation 
methods is to establish upper and lower bounds for DOM pools stratified by regions, forest type, and soil type 
(organic vs. mineral soils). Any values, reported in inventories or estimated by models that fall outside these 
bounds can be investigated further.  
4.4.4 
Reporting and Documentation 
General requirements for reporting and documentation are set out in Volume 1, Chapter 8. In general it is good 
practice to archive and document all data and information (such as figures, statistics, sources of assumptions, 
modeling approaches, uncertainty analyses, validation studies, inventory methods, research experiments, 
measurements arising from field site studies, associated protocols, and other basic data) applied to produce the 
national emissions/removals inventory. Elaborations on carbon pool definitions should be reported, and 
definitions relevant to determining the extent of the managed land included in the inventory, together with 
evidence that these definitions have been applied consistently over time provided. 
Documentation is needed for demonstrating completeness, consistency of time series data and methods for 
interpolating between samples, methods and years, and for recalculating and avoidance of double counting as 
well as for performing QA/QC. As inventory compilers decide to progress through higher tier levels, whose 
calculation methods and data are not described in the present volume or characterized by more disaggregated 
approaches, additional documentation is required to support the use of more advanced and accurate 
methodologies, country-defined parameters, and high resolution maps and data sets. However, at all tier levels, 
explanation is needed for decisions regarding choice of methodology, coefficients, and activity data. The aim is 
to facilitate reconstruction of estimates by independent third parties, but it may prove impractical to include all 
documentation necessary in national inventory report. The inventory should therefore include summaries of 
approaches and methods used, and references to source of data such that the reported emissions estimates are 
transparent and steps adopted in their calculation may be retraced.  
Emission factors: Sources of the emission or removal factors that were used (specific IPCC default values or 
otherwise) have to be quoted. If country- or region- or forest type-specific emission factors were used, and if 
new methods (other than the default IPCC methods) were used, the scientific basis of these emission factors and 
methods should be completely described and documented. This includes defining the input parameters and 
describing the process by which these emission factors and methods are derived, as well as describing sources 
and magnitudes of uncertainties. Inventory agencies using country-specific emission factors should provide 
information on the basis of selection of a different factor, describe how it was derived, compare it to other 
published emission factors, explain any significant differences, and attempt to place bounds on uncertainty. 
Activity data: Sources of all activity data, such as areas, soil types and characteristics and vegetation covers, 
used in the calculations should be provided (i.e., complete citations for statistical databases from which data 
were drawn). Reference to the metadata for the databases are useful, including information on dates and 
frequency of data collection, sampling procedures, analytical procedures used to obtain soil characteristics and 
minimum detectable change in organic carbon, and estimates of accuracy and precision. When activity data were 
not obtained directly from databases, the information and assumptions that were used to derive the activity data 
should be provided, as well as estimates of the uncertainty associated to the derived activity data. This applies in 
particular when scaling up procedures are used to derive large-scale estimates; in these cases the statistical 
procedures should be described along with the associated uncertainty. 
Results of model simulations: If inventory agencies used data output from models in their estimation 
procedures, the rationale for model selection and use should be provided. It is a good practice to provide 
complete citations of peer-reviewed publications in which the model is described, and modelling results are 
interpreted and validated. Detailed information should be provided to enable reviewers to assess the model’s 
validity, including the general modeling approach, key model assumptions, input and output data, parameter 
values and parameterization procedures, confidence intervals of model outputs, and the outcome of any 
sensitivity analysis conducted on the output. In addition, computer source code for models should be 
permanently archived for future reference, along with all the input and output files. 
Analysis of emissions: Significant fluctuations in emissions between years should be explained. A distinction 
should be made between changes in activity levels and changes in emission coefficients from year to year, and 
the reasons for these changes documented. If different emission factors are used for different years, the reasons 
for this should be explained and documented.

Definition 
Forest 
Land spanning more than 0.5 hectare with trees higher than 5 meters and a 
canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in 
situ. It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban 
land use.  
Forest is determined both by the presence of trees and the absence of other 
predominant land uses. The trees should be able to reach a minimum height of 
5 meters in situ. Areas under reforestation that have not yet reached but are 
expected to reach a canopy cover of 10 percent and tree height of 5 meters are 
included, as are temporarily unstocked areas, resulting from human 
intervention or natural causes, which are expected to regenerate.  
Includes: areas with bamboo and palms provided that height and canopy cover 
criteria are met; forest roads, firebreaks and other small open areas; forest in 
national parks, nature reserves and other protected areas such as those of 
specific scientific, historical, cultural or spiritual interest; windbreaks, 
shelterbelts and corridors of trees with an area of more than 0.5 hectare and 
width of more than 20 meters; plantations primarily used for forestry or 
protective purposes, such as rubber-wood plantations and cork oak stands.  
Excludes: tree stands in agricultural production systems, for example in fruit 
plantations and agroforestry systems. The term also excludes trees in urban 
parks and gardens. 
Other wooded land 
Land not classified as “Forest”, spanning more than 0.5 hectare; with trees 
higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of 5-10 percent, or trees able to reach 
these thresholds in situ; or with a combined cover of shrubs, bushes and trees 
above 10 percent. It does not include land that is predominantly under 
agricultural or urban land use. 
Other land 
All land that is not classified as Forest or Other Wooded Land. 
Includes:  agricultural land, meadows and pastures, built-up areas, barren land, 
etc; areas classified under the subcategory ‘Other Land with tree cover’. 
Other land with tree cover  
Land classified as Other Land, spanning more than 0.5 hectare with a canopy 
cover of more than 10 percent of trees able to reach a height of 5 meters at 
maturity.  
Includes: groups of trees and scattered trees in agricultural landscapes, parks, 
gardens, and around buildings (provided that the area, height and canopy cover 
criteria are met); tree plantations established mainly for other purposes than

Note: Lower values of the ranges for BCEFS apply if growing stock definition includes branches, stem tops and cull trees; upper values apply if branches and tops are not part of growing stock, minimum top diameters in 
the definition of growing stock are large, inventoried volume falls near the lower category limit or basic wood densities are relatively high. Continuous graphs, functional forms and updates with new studies can be found 
at  the forest- and climate- change website at: http://www.fao.org/forestry/ 
Average BCEF for inhomogeneous forests should be derived as far as possible as weighted averages. It is good practice to justify the factors chosen. To apply BCEFI, an estimate of the current average growing stock is 
necessary. It can be derived from FRA 2005 at http://www.fao.org/forestry/ 
 
BCEFR values are derived by dividing BCEFS by 0.9

(in any of the compartments above, e.g., carbon in growing stock or biomass removals), or 
in litter, dead wood and soil organic matter 
 
ABOVE-GROUND BIOMASS 
All biomass of living vegetation, both woody and herbaceous, above the soil including stems, stumps, branches, 
bark, seeds, and foliage. 
Note:  In cases where forest understory is a relatively small component of the above-ground biomass carbon pool, 
it is acceptable for the methodologies and associated data used in some tiers to exclude it, provided the tiers are 
used in a consistent manner throughout the inventory time series. 
ABOVE-GROUND BIOMASS GROWTH 
Oven-dry weight of net annual increment (s.b.) of a tree, stand or forest plus oven-dry weight of annual growth 
of branches, twigs, foliage, top and stump. The term “growth” is used here instead of “increment”, since the 
latter term tends to be understood in terms of merchantable volume.      
AFFORESTATION2 
The direct human-induced conversion of land that has not been forested for a period of at least 50 years to 
forested land through planting, seeding and/or the human-induced promotion of natural seed sources. 
AGROFORESTRY 
A land-use system that involves deliberate retention, introduction, or mixture of trees or other woody perennials 
in crop and animal production systems to take advantage of economic or ecological interactions among the 
components (Dictionary of Forestry, helms, 1998, Society of American Foresters). 
BASIC WOOD DENSITY 
Ratio between oven dry mass and fresh stem-wood volume without bark.  
BELOW-GROUND BIOMASS 
All biomass of live roots. Fine roots of less than (suggested) 2mm diameter are often excluded because these 
often cannot be distinguished empirically from soil organic matter or litter. 
BIOMASS CONVERSION AND EXPANSION FACTOR (BCEF) 
A multiplication factor  that coverts merchantable volume of growing stock, merchantable volume of net annual 
increment, or merchantable volume of wood-removal and fuelwood-removals to above-ground biomass, above-
ground biomass growth, or biomass removals, repectively. Biomass conversion and expansion factors for 
growing stock (BCEFS), for net annual increment (BCEFI), and for wood-removal and fuelwood-removals 
 
1 Occurs in some cases, e.g.,  where root stocks (walnut) or entire root systems are removed (biomass harvesting). 
2 In the context of the Kyoto Protocol, as stipulated by the Marrakesh Accords, cf. paragraph 1 of the Annex to draft decision 
-/CMP.1 (Land Use, Land-use Change and Forestry) contained in document FCCC/CP/2001/13/Add.1, p.58. 
Chapter 4: Forest Land 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.73 
(BCEFR) usually differ. As used in these guidelines, they account for above-ground components only. For more 
detail see Box 4.2. 
BIOMASS EXPANSION FACTOR (BEF) 
A multiplication factor that expands the dry-weight of growing stock biomass, increment biomass, and biomass 
of wood-removal or fuelwood-removals to account for non-merchantable or non-commercial biomass 
components, such as stump, branches, twigs, foliage, and, sometimes, non-commercial trees. Biomass expansion 
factors usually differ for growing stock (BEFS), net annual increment (BEFI), and wood-removal and fuelwood-
removals (BEFR). As used in these guidelines, biomass expansion factors account for above-ground components 
only. For more detail see Box 4.2. 
BIOMASS REMOVALS 
Biomass of wood-removal and firewood-removals (s.b.) plus oven-dry weight of branches, twigs, foliage of the 
trees or stands removed. 
CANOPY COVER 
See crown cover 
CARBON CONTENT   
Absolute amount of carbon in a pool or parts of it. 
CARBON FRACTION 
Tonnes of carbon per tonne of biomass dry matter.  
CARBON IN…  
See table above; absolute amount in tonnes, obtained by multiplying amount of biomass in respective component 
by the applicable carbon fraction, usually 50%.    
CARBON STOCK 
The quantity of carbon in a pool. 
CARBON STOCK CHANGE 
The carbon stock in a pool changes due to gains and losses. When losses exceed gains, the stock decreases, and 
the pool acts as a source; when gains exceed losses, the pools accumulate carbon, and the pools act as a sink. 
CLOSED FOREST 
Formations where trees, in the various stories and the undergrowth, cover a high proportion of the ground 
(>40%). 
CONVERSION 
Change of one land use to another. 
CONVERSION FACTOR 
Multiplier that transforms the measurement units of an item without affecting its size or amount. For example, 
basic wood density is a conversion factor that transforms green volume of wood into dry weight. 
CROWN COVER 
The percentage of the ground covered by a vertical projection of the outermost perimeter of the natural spread of 
the foliage (cannot exceed 100%).  
DEAD WOOD 
Includes all non-living woody biomass not contained in the litter, either standing, lying on the ground, or in the 
soil. Dead wood includes wood lying on the surface, dead roots, and stumps, larger than or equal to 10cm in 
diameter (or the diameter specified by the country). 
DEAD WOOD BIOMASS 
All non-living woody biomass not contained in the litter, either standing, lying on the ground, or in the soil. 
Dead wood includes wood lying on the surface, dead roots down to a diameter of 2mm, and stumps larger than 
or equal to 10cm in diameter or any other diameter used by the country. 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
4.74 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
DEFORESTATION3 
The direct human-induced conversion of forested land to non-forested land.  
DISTURBANCE 
A disturbance is defined as an environmental fluctuation and destructive event that disturb forest health, 
structure, and/or change resources or physical environment at any given spatial or temporal scale. Disturbances 
that affect health and vitality which include biotic agents such as insects and diseases, and abiotic agents such as 
fire, pollution, and extreme weather conditions (see also below, mortality and other disturbance). 
DISTURBANCE BY DISEASES 
Disturbances caused by diseases attributable to pathogens such as bacteria, fungi, phytoplasma, or virus. 
DISTURBANCE BY FIRE 
Disturbance caused by wildfire regardless of whether it broke out inside or outside the Forest. A wildfire is any 
unplanned and uncontrolled wildland fire which, regardless of ignition source, may require suppression response. 
DISTURBANCE BY INSECTS 
Disturbance caused by insect pests that are detrimental to tree health. 
DRY (FOREST) 
Moisture regimes for boreal and temperate zones are defined by the ratio of mean annual precipitation (MAP) 
and potential evapotranspiration (PET): Dry (MAP/PET < 1) and Wet (MAP/PET > 1); and for tropical zones by 
precipitation alone: Dry (MAP < 1,000mm), Moist (MAP: 1,000-2,000mm) and Wet (MAP > 2,000mm). 
DRY MATTER (D.M.) 
Dry matter refers to biomass that has been dried to an oven-dry state, often at 70ºC. 
FELLINGS  
Volume (over bark) of all trees, living or dead, above a 10cm diameter at breast height, felled annually in forests 
or other wooded land.  It includes volume of all felled trees whether or not they are removed. It includes 
silvicultural and pre-commercial thinning and cleanings of trees of more than 10cm diameter, left in the forest, 
and natural losses that are recovered.  
Note: In these guidelines, only the terms “wood-removal” and “fuelwood-removals” are used, consistent with 
GFRA 2005.  Removals are generally a subset of fellings.  
FOREST4 
Forest is a minimum area of land of 0.05 – 1.0 hectares with tree crown cover (or equivalent stocking level) of 
more than 10 – 30 per cent with trees with the potential to reach a minimum height of 2 – 5 metres at maturity in 
situ. A forest may consist either of closed forest formations where trees of various storeys and undergrowth 
cover a high portion of the ground or open forest. Young natural stands and all plantations which have yet to 
reach a crown density of 10 – 30 per cent or tree height of 2 – 5 metres are included under forest, as are areas 
normally forming part of the forest area which are temporarily unstocked as a result of human intervention such 
as harvesting or natural causes but which are expected to revert to forest. 
FOREST INVENTORY 
System for measuring the extent, quantity, and condition of a forest, usually by sampling: 
1.  A set of objective sampling methods designed to quantify the spatial distribution, composition, and rates of 
change of forest parameters within specified levels of precision for the purpose of management; 
2. The listing of data from such a survey. May be made of all forest resources including trees and other 
vegetation, fish, insects, and wildlife, as well as street trees and urban forest trees. 
 
3 In the context of the Kyoto Protocol, as stipulated by the Marrakesh Accords, cf. paragraph 1 of the Annex to draft decision 
-/CMP.1 (Land Use, Land-use Change and Forestry) contained in document FCCC/CP/2001/13/Add.1, p.58.

Chapter 4: Forest Land 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.75 
FOREST LAND 
This category includes all land with woody vegetation consistent with thresholds used to define Forest Land in 
the national greenhouse gas inventory. It also includes systems with a vegetation structure that currently fall 
below, but in situ could potentially reach the threshold values used by a country to define the Forest Land 
category. 
FOREST MANAGEMENT5 
A system of practices for stewardship and use of forest land aimed at fulfilling relevant ecological (including 
biological diversity), economic and social functions of the forest in a sustainable manner. 
FOREST PLANTATION 
Forest stands established by planting or/and seeding in the process of afforestation or reforestation. They are 
either of introduced species (all planted stands), or intensively managed stands of indigenous species, which 
meet all the following criteria: one or two species at planting, even age class, and regular spacing. 
FUELWOOD-REMOVAL 
The wood removed for energy production purposes, regardless of whether for industrial, commercial, or 
domestic use. Fuel wood includes wood collected or removed directly from forest or other wooded land for 
energy purposes only. It excludes fuelwood which is produced as a by-product or residual matter from the 
industrial processing of round wood. It includes removal from fellings in an earlier period and from trees killed 
or damaged by natural causes. It also includes removal by local people or owners for their own use. 
GROWING STOCK 
Volume over bark of all living trees more than X cm in diameter at breast height. It includes the stem from 
ground level or stump height up to a top diameter of Y cm, and may also include branches to a minimum 
diameter of W cm. Countries indicate the three thresholds (X, Y, W in cm) and the parts of the tree that are not 
included in the volume. Countries also indicate whether the reported figures refer to volume above ground or 
above stump. The diameter is measured at 30cm above the end of the buttresses if these are higher than 1 meter. 
It includes windfallen living trees and excludes smaller branches, twigs, foliage, flowers, seeds, and roots. 
GROWING STOCK BIOMASS 
Oven-dry weight of the growing stock (s.a.).  
HARVEST LOSS  
Difference between the assessed merchantable volume of growing stock and the actual volume of the harvested 
timber. Due to different measurement rules for standing and felled timber, losses are from bucking, breakage, 
defect. 
INCREMENT BIOMASS 
Oven-dry weight of (merchantable) net annual increment of a tree, stand, or forest. 
INTENSIVE FOREST MANAGEMENT 
A regime of forest management, where silvicultural practices define the structure and composition of forest 
stands. A formal or informal forest management plan exists. 
A forest is not under intensive management, if mainly natural ecological processes define the structure and 
composition of stands. 
INTRODUCED SPECIES 
A species introduced outside of its normal past and current distribution.   
LITTER  
Includes all non-living biomass with a size greater than the limit for soil organic matter (suggested 2mm) and 
less than the minimum diameter chosen for dead wood (e.g., 10cm), lying dead, in various states of 
decomposition above or within the mineral or organic soil. This includes the litter layer as usually defined in soil 
 
5 Forest management has particular meaning under the Marrakesh Accords, which may require subdivision of the managed 
forest as described in Chapter 4. 
 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use

2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
typologies. Live fine roots above the mineral or organic soil (of less than the minimum diameter limit chosen for 
below-ground biomass) are included in litter where they cannot be distinguished from it empirically. 
LOW ACTIVITY CLAY (LAC) SOILS 
Soils with low activity clay (LAC) minerals are highly weathered soils dominated by 1:1 clay mineral and 
amorphous iron and aluminium oxides (in FAO classification included: Acrisols, Nitosols, Ferrasols). 
MANAGED FOREST 
A managed forest is forest land subjected to conditions defined for managed land.  
MANAGED LAND 
Managed land is land where human interventions and practices have been applied to perform production, 
ecological or social functions.  
MERCHANTABLE VOLUME 
Mechantable volume is the volume overbark of all trees defined using the conditions described for growing 
stocks. Further, this can be applied to growing stocks as well as net annual increment and wood removals. 
MOIST (FOREST) 
Moisture regimes for boreal and temperate zones are defined by the ratio of mean annual precipitation (MAP) 
and potential evapotranspiration (PET): Dry (MAP/PET < 1) and Wet (MAP/PET > 1); and for tropical zones by 
precipitation alone: Dry (MAP < 1,000mm), Moist (MAP: 1,000-2,000mm) and Wet (MAP > 2,000mm). 
MORTALITY 
Trees dying naturally from competition in the stem-exclusion stage of a stand or forest. As used here, mortality 
does not include losses due to disturbances (s.a.). 
NATURAL FOREST 
A forest composed of indigenous trees and not classified as a forest plantation. 
NATURAL REGENERATION 
Re-establishment of a forest stand by natural means i.e., by natural seeding or vegetative regeneration. It may be 
assisted by human intervention e.g., by scarification of the soil or fencing to protect against wildlife or domestic 
animal grazing. 
NET ANNUAL INCREMENT 
Average annual volume of gross increment over the given reference period minus mortality (s.a.), of all trees to a 
specified minimum diameter at breast height. As used here, it is not net of losses due to disturbances (s.a.). 
ORGANIC SOILS 
Soils are organic if they satisfy the requirements 1 and 2, or 1 and 3 below (FAO, 1998): 
1) Thickness of organic horizon greater than or equal to 10cm.  A horizon of less than 20cm must have 12 
percent or more organic carbon when mixed to a depth of 20cm. 
2) Soils that are never saturated with water for more than a few days must contain more than 20 percent 
organic carbon by weight (i.e., about 35 percent organic matter). 
3) Soils are subject to water saturation episodes and has either: 
a. 
At least 12 percent organic carbon by weight (i.e., about 20 percent organic matter) if the soil 
has no clay; or  
b. At least 18 percent organic carbon by weight (i.e., about 30 percent organic matter) if the soil 
has 60% or more clay; or 
c. 
An intermediate, proportional amount of organic carbon for intermediate amounts of clay. 
OTHER DISTURBANCE 
Disturbance caused by factors other than fire, insects, or diseases. May include areas affected by drought, 
flooding, windfalls, acid rain, etc. 
Chapter 4: Forest Land 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.77 
PEAT SOIL (ALSO HISTOSOL) 
A typical wetland soil with a high water table and an organic layer of at least 40cm thickness (poorly drained 
organic soil). 
POOL/CARBON POOL 
A reservoir. A system which has the capacity to accumulate or release carbon. Examples of carbon pools are 
forest biomass, wood products, soils, and the atmosphere. The units are in mass. 
REFORESTATION6 
Direct human-induced conversion of non-forested land to forested land through planting, seeding and/or the 
human-induced promotion of natural seed sources, on land that was forested but that has been converted to non-
forested land. For the first commitment period, reforestation activities will be limited to reforestation occurring 
on those lands that did not contain forest on 31 December 1989. 
REMOVAL BIOMASS 
Oven dry weight of wood removals. 
REVEGETATION7 
A direct human-induced activity to increase carbon stocks on sites through the establishment of vegetation that 
covers a minimum area of 0.05 hectares and does not meet the definitions of afforestation and reforestation 
contained here. 
ROOT-SHOOT RATIO 
Ratio of below-ground biomass to above-ground biomass; applies to above-ground biomass, above-ground 
biomass growth, biomass removals and may differ for these components. 
ROUNDWOOD 
All round wood felled or otherwise harvested and removed; it comprises all wood obtained from removals e.g., 
quatities removed from forests and from trees outside forests, including wood recovered from natural felling and 
logging losses during a period. In the production statistics, it represents the sum of fuelwood, including wood for 
charcoal, saw-and veneer logs, pulpwood and other industrial roundwood. In the trade statistics, it represents the 
sum of industrial roundwood, and fuelwood, including wood for charcoal. It is reported in cubic meters 
excluding bark.   
SANDY SOILS 
Includes all soils (regardless of taxonomic classification) having > 70% sand and < 8% clay (based on standard 
textural measurements (in FAO classification include: Arenosols, sandy Regosols)). 
SAVANNA 
Savannas are tropical and subtropical formations with continuous grass cover, occasionally interrupted by trees 
and shrubs.  Savannas are found in Africa, Latin America, Asia and Australia. 
SEASONAL (FOREST) 
Semi-deciduous forests with a distinct wet and dry season and rainfall between 1,200 and 2,000 mm per year. 
STAND–REPLACING DISTURBANCES 
Major disturbances which kill or remove all the existing trees above the forest floor vegetation. Minor 
disturbances leave some of the pre-disturbance trees alive.  
SHRUB 
Woody perennial plants, generally more than 0.5 meters and less than 5 meters in height at maturity and without 
definite crown. Height limits for trees and shrubs should be interpreted with flexibility, particularly the minimum 
tree and maximum shrub height, which may vary between 5 and 7 meters. 
 
6 In the context of the Kyoto Protocol, as stipulated by the Marrakesh Accords, cf. paragraph 1 of the Annex to draft decision 
-/CMP.1 (Land Use, Land-use Change and Forestry) contained in document FCCC/CP/2001/13/Add.1, p.58.

Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
4.78 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
SOIL CARBON 
Organic carbon in mineral and organic soils (including peat) to a specified depth chosen by the country and 
applied consistently through the time series. Live fine roots of less than 2mm (or other value chosen by the 
country as diameter limit for below-ground biomass) are included with soil organic matter where they cannot be 
distinguished from it empirically. 
SOIL ORGANIC MATTER 
Includes organic carbon in mineral soils to a specified depth chosen by the country and applied consistently 
through the time series. Live and dead fine roots and DOM within the soil, that are less than the minimum 
diameter limit (suggested 2mm) for roots and DOM, are included with soil organic matter where they cannot be 
distinguished from it empirically.  The default for soil depth is 30cm and guidance on determining country-
specific depths is given in Chapter 2.3.3.1.  
SPODIC SOILS 
Soils exhibiting strong podzolization (in FAO classification includes many Podzolic groups). 
TOTAL BIOMASS 
Growing stock biomass of trees, stands or forests plus biomass of branches, twigs, foliage, seeds, stumps, and 
sometimes, non-commercial trees. Differentiated into above-ground biomass and below-ground biomass (s.a.). If 
there is no misunderstanding, possible also just to use “biomass” with the same meaning.  
TOTAL BIOMASS GROWTH 
Biomass of the net annual increment (s.a.) of trees, stands, or forests, plus  the biomass of the growth of  
branches, twigs, foliage, seeds, stumps, and sometimes, non-commercial trees. Differentiated into above-ground 
biomass growth and below-ground biomass growth (s.a.). If there is no misunderstanding, possible also just to 
use “biomass growth” with the same meaning. The term “growth” is used here instead of “increment”, since the 
latter term tends to be understood in terms of merchantable volume.      
TREE 
A woody perennial with a single main stem, or in the case of coppice with several stems, having a more or less 
definitive crown. Includes bamboos, palms, and other woody plants meeting the above criteria. 
VOLUME OVERBARK 
Growing stock or merchantable wood measured outside, that is including the bark. Bark adds 5-25% of total 
volume, depending on tree diameter and bark thickness of species. The weighted average bark percentage 
calculated from the data of TBFRA 2000 is 11% of the volume outside bark.  
VOLUME UNDERBARK 
Growing stock or merchantable wood without the bark. See above.  
WET (FOREST) 
Moisture regimes for boreal and temperate zones are defined by the ratio of mean annual precipitation (MAP) 
and potential evapotranspiration (PET): Dry (MAP/PET < 1) and Wet (MAP/PET > 1); and for tropical zones by 
precipitation alone: Dry (MAP < 1,000mm), Moist (MAP: 1,000-2,000mm) and Wet (MAP > 2,000mm). 
WOODY BIOMASS 
Biomass from trees, bushes and shrubs, for palms, bamboos not strictly correct in the botanical sense. 
WOOD FUEL 
Also wood-based fuels, wood-derived biofuels. All types of biofuels originating directly or indirectly from 
woody biomass. 
WOOD-REMOVAL  
The wood removed (volume of round wood over bark) for production of goods and services other than energy 
production (fuelwood). The term removal differs from fellings as it excludes felled trees left in the forest. It 
includes removal from fellings of an earlier period and from trees killed or damaged by natural causes. It also 
includes removal by local people or owners for their own use.  As the term “removal” is used in the context of 
climate change to indicate sequestration of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, removal in the context of  
forest harvesting  should always be used as “wood-removal or fuelwood-removal” to avoid misunderstandings.
