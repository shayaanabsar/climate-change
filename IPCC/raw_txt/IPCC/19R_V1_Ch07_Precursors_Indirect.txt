7 PRECURSORS AND INDIRECT EMISSIONS 
Users are expected to go to Mapping Tables in Annex 1, before reading this chapter. This is required to correctly 
understand both the refinements made and how the elements in this chapter relate to the corresponding chapter 
in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. 
7.1 
INTRODUCTION 
This chapter addresses the calculation of emissions of precursors of greenhouse gases and of indirect emissions 
that have not been addressed in Volumes 2-5 and that may be reported in greenhouse gas inventories.  
Although they are not included in global warming potential-weighted greenhouse gas emission totals, direct 
emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), 
and sulphur dioxide (SO2) are also reported in greenhouse gas inventories. Carbon monoxide, NOx and NMVOC 
as well as CH4 in the presence of sunlight contribute to the formation of the greenhouse gas ozone (O3) in the 
troposphere and are therefore often called ‘ozone precursors’. Furthermore, NOx emission plays an important role 
in the Earth’s nitrogen cycle and is an aerosol precursor. Sulphur dioxide emissions lead to formation of sulphate 
particles, which also play a role in climate change. Ammonia (NH3) is an aerosol precursor with increasing 
contribution to ambient particulate matter concentrations in several regions, in part due to decreasing SO2 
emissions. The majority of the carbon emitted in the form of non-CO2 species (i.e., CH4, CO, and NMVOCs) 
eventually oxidizes to CO2 in the atmosphere and this amount can be estimated from the emissions of these non-
CO2 gases. 
The guidance of this chapter is consistent with the use of any radiative forcing metric (e.g., Global Warming 
Potential or Global Temperature change Potential) included in assessment reports of the IPCC so far and follows 
the principle to avoid double counting (see Section 7.2.1.5). However, it does not provide guidance to estimate the 
overall radiative forcing resulting from emissions of greenhouse gases, precursors and indirect emissions.  
Section 7.2 addresses the estimation and reporting of the precursors for national inventories. The methodologies 
for ambient air quality emission inventories have been elaborated in detail in the EMEP1/EEA2 Emission Inventory 
Guidebook (Guidebook), and these methodologies for CO, NOx, NMVOCs, and SO2 emissions are referenced in 
this chapter rather than to be included in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. Exceptions are for sources not well covered 
by the Guidebook. 
Section 7.3 addresses nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions that result from the deposition of the nitrogen emitted as NOx  
and NH3. Nitrous oxide is produced in soils through the biological processes of nitrification and denitrification. 
Simply defined, nitrification is the aerobic microbial oxidation of ammonium to nitrate and denitrification is the 
anaerobic microbial reduction of nitrate to nitrogen gas (N2). Nitrous oxide is a gaseous intermediate in the reaction 
sequence of denitrification and a by-product of nitrification that leaks from microbial cells into the soil atmosphere. 
One of the main controlling factors in this reaction is the availability of inorganic nitrogen in the soil and therefore 
deposition of nitrogen resulting from NOx and NH3 will enhance emissions. Nitrous oxide emissions will also be 
enhanced if nitrogen is deposited in the ocean or in lakes. For this reason, the 2006 IPCC Guidelines include 
guidance for estimating N2O emissions resulting from nitrogen deposition of all anthropogenic sources of NOx and 
NH3. Only agricultural sources of nitrogen were considered in the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines (IPCC 1997).  
Guidance is provided in Section 7.3 on estimating N2O emissions from atmospheric deposition resulting from all 
categories except agricultural soil management and manure management. Section 7.3 provides information on NOx 
emissions. Countries may use national methodologies to estimate emissions of NH3 not originating from 
agriculture. NH3 emissions are also covered in the EMEP/EEA Emission Inventory Guidebook.

7.2.1 
Inventory of precursors 
7.2.1.1 ENERGY 
For most countries, road transportation will be a major source of NOx, CO, and NMVOC emissions. Public 
electricity and heat production will likely be the major source of SO2 emissions in countries where coal is used 
extensively, and also an important source of NOx emissions. Industrial combustion will also be a source of SO2, 
NOx and CO emissions and residential combustion a source of CO emissions. Oil production will likely be a source 
of NMVOC, NOx, and, CO emissions in countries that produce oil and gas. 
Most NOx emissions resulting from fuel combustion are typically ‘fuel-NOx’ that is formed from the conversion 
of chemically bound nitrogen in the fuel. The content of nitrogen in different fuel varies. Depending on the 
combustion temperature, thermal-NOx and prompt-NOx can also be formed from nitrogen contained in the 
combustion intake air (e.g., in pulverized coal combustion). 
Carbon monoxide and NMVOCs are generated during under-stoichiometric combustion conditions and are 
dependent on a variety of factors, including fuel type and combustion conditions. 
Emissions of sulphur oxides (SOx) are primarily related to the sulphur content of the fuel, although some sulphur 
can be retained in the ash. Abatement in stationary and mobile (e.g., marine) combustion can reduce the amount 
emitted; desulphurization of fuels can reduce SO2 emissions in transport related emissions. 
7.2.1.2 INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES AND PRODUCT USE  
No refinement. 
7.2.1.3 AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY AND OTHER LAND USE  
The burning of crop residues emits NOx, as does the addition of nitrogen to the soils from nitrogen fertilizers and 
other nutrients. Carbon monoxide and SO2 are emitted when biomass is burned. The primary sources of the 
NMVOC emissions are burning of crop residues and other plant wastes, and the anaerobic degradation of livestock 
feed and animal excreta. Plants, mainly trees (e.g. oil palm trees) and cereals, also contribute to NMVOC 
concentrations in the atmosphere. 
The EMEP/EEA Guidebook does not fully cover emissions from burning of biomass, therefore additional guidance 
is given in Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) Volume, Chapter 4, Section 4.2.4 for Non-CO2 
emissions from biomass burning from forest, Chapter 5, Sections 5.2.4 and 5.3.4 for Non-CO2 emissions from 
biomass burning in Cropland, and Chapter 6, Sections 6.2.4 and 6.3.4 for Non-CO2 emissions from biomass 
burning in Grassland (CO, CH4, N2O, NOx). Biomass burning when forest and grasslands are converted to other 
uses, forest fires, and biomass burning due to forest management practices are discussed in these chapters of 
Volume 4 for AFOLU sector. 
7.2.1.4 WASTE 
Open burning, as well as incineration of municipal and other solid wastes and sludge from wastewater treatment, 
produces emissions of NOx, CO, and SO2. NMVOC emissions can originate from wastewater treatment plants and 
solid waste disposal on land. 
7.2.1.5 CARBON EMITTED IN GASES OTHER THAN CO2  
The 2006 IPCC Guidelines estimate carbon emissions in terms of the species that are emitted. The majority of the 
carbon emitted in the form of non-CO2 species (i.e., CH4, CO, and NMVOCs) eventually oxidizes to CO2 in the 
atmosphere and this amount can be estimated from the emissions estimates of the non-CO2 gases (Seinfeld and 
Volume 1: General Guidance and Reporting

Pandis 1998; Boucher et al. 2009). This section provides guidance on calculating CO2 inputs to the atmosphere 
from emissions of carbon-containing compounds that are not included under other emission categories.3 
In national GHG inventories, inputs of CO2 from the atmospheric oxidation of CH4, CO, and NMVOCs are 
typically included in inventories for some source categories, correctly excluded for some other categories, and 
likely require estimating separately for yet other categories. The source categories falling into these first two groups 
are as follows (Gillenwater 2008): 
• 
Fossil fuel combustion and fuelling activities including the atmospheric oxidation of CH4, CO, and NMVOCs 
to CO2 is accounted for by the methodology used by most countries to calculate CO2 emissions from fossil 
fuel combustion.4 This methodology is based on fuel consumption statistics, data on the carbon content of 
each fuel, and oxidation factors; IPCC default carbon content or CO2 emission factors assume that except the 
small fraction of carbon remaining as un-oxidized solids, for example soot or ash (IPCC 1997; IPCC 2000), 
all carbon in the fuel is oxidized to CO2 in the combustion process or atmosphere.5 For most countries that 
use common CO2 factors, these inputs to the atmosphere of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion related emissions 
of CH4, CO, and NMVOCs are already accounted for under the Energy sector category 1A.6 
• 
Several managed sources of biogenic carbon (e.g., livestock) also emit CH4, CO, and NMVOCs. The carbon 
in these gases is derived from rapidly cycling (non-fossil) sources. For example, the carbon content of CH4 
from enteric fermentation is derived from plant matter, which has converted atmospheric CO2 to organic 
compounds. The atmospheric oxidation of CH4 merely completes a natural cycle and is not treated as a net 
anthropogenic contribution to the atmosphere's CO2 burden. Any net changes in the biogenic carbon stocks 
found in plant matter are assumed to be captured under the AFOLU sector through estimates of CO2 emissions 
and removals from land-use and land-use changes and forestry (i.e., biogenic carbon stock changes). 
Methane, CO, or NMVOCs are also emitted as fugitives from fossil fuel production activities such as coal mining 
as well as petroleum and natural gas exploration, processing and storage. The carbon emitted in the form of CH4, 
CO, or NMVOCs from these fugitive emission source categories is not typically captured in fuel combustion 
activity data because these emissions occur prior to the collection of data on fossil fuel consumption. Therefore, 
CO2 inputs to the atmosphere from the oxidation of these fugitive emissions are typically not estimated elsewhere 
in national GHG inventories, although fugitive CH4 emissions are reported separately in GHG inventories.   
Some industrial processes in which carbon from fossil fuel sources is used as a production feedstock (e.g., 
petrochemical production) may also lead to CO2 inputs to the atmosphere. The carbon emitted in the form of CH4, 
CO, or NMVOCs from these industrial processes may be included in a country’s non-energy use of fossil fuel 
statistics or they may be estimated separately.7 Carbon dioxide emissions from industrial processes that use carbon 
feedstock as reducing agents (e.g., iron and steel production) are typically included in GHG inventories based on 
the assumption that the carbon in the reducing agent is fully oxidized. Depending on the assumptions and methods 
used to estimate storage and emissions from those non-energy use and feedstock categories (e.g., solvent use), CO2 
resulting from emissions of CH4, CO, and NMVOCs may or may not be included elsewhere in GHG inventories. 
Two options are possible to address inputs of CO2 from CH4 of fossil origin. Countries may apply the methods 
described below to calculate the mass of CO2 oxidised. If countries use a metric for CH4 that includes the inputs of 
CO2 from CH4 of fossil origin (such as GWP and GTP for fossil methane provided in Table 8.A.1 of Appendix 
8.A in IPCC 2013), they should not estimate separately the amount of CO2 from atmospheric oxidation of CH4 of 
fossil origin to avoid double counting the warming impact. If countries choose to apply a metric which does not 
take into account the conversion of CH4 into CO2, countries should apply the methods described below to calculate 
the amount of CO2 from CH4. Countries should transparently document which option used. 
The methodologies for calculating CO2 from the atmospheric oxidation of CH4, CO, and NMVOCs are simple and 
for countries that already have detailed inventories of CH4, CO, and NMVOC emissions, no additional activity 
                                                           
3 The contents of Box 7.2 from the 2006 IPCC Guidelines have been elaborated and included in the text of this section. 
4 This includes evaporative emissions of NMVOCs associated with immediate fuelling activities for mobile or stationary 
sources where the mass of carbon associated with these emissions is accounted for in the fuel consumption activity data used 
in the combustion-related emission estimates for CO2. 
5 If a direct measurement method is used to estimate CO2 emissions from fuel combustion then CO2 emissions from the 
atmospheric oxidation of CH4, CO, and NMVOCs will not be included and must be estimated separately.   
6 If a country uses a country-specific CO2 emission factor based on direct measurement data to estimate emissions then CO2   
from the atmospheric oxidation of CH4, CO, and NMVOCs would not be included in emission estimates for fossil fuel 
combustion, as the direct measurement occurs prior to the atmospheric oxidation process. 
7 Non-energy products from fossil fuels include industrial applications of fossil carbon material such as in the manufacture of 
ammonia from natural gas.

data collection should be necessary. Input of CO2 to the atmosphere are calculated by converting previously 
estimated mass emissions of CH4, CO, or NMVOCs to CO2 based on the carbon content of each gas. For example, 
the activity data used to estimate CO2 inputs from the oxidation of emissions coal mining is already collected to 
estimate CH4 for that category (1.B.1). 
Methane, CO, or NMVOC emissions will eventually be oxidised to CO2 in the atmosphere. These CO2 inputs 
could be included in national inventories. They can be calculated from emissions of methane, CO and NMVOCs. 
The basic calculation principles are: 
From CH4:  
InputsCO2 = EmissionsCH4 • OF • 44/16 
From CO:  
InputsCO2 = EmissionsCO • OF • 44/28 
From NMVOC:  InputsCO2 = EmissionsNMVOC • C • OF • 44/12 
Where, 
InputsCO2 are the added CO2 to the atmosphere from the oxidation of CH4, CO, and NMVOCs that are not 
accounted for already under other categories. 
EmissionsCH4, EmissionsCO, and EmissionsNMVOC are the emission estimates taken from other relevant emission 
categories (e.g., CO, NMVOC, CH4 from oil and gas systems, 1.B.2). 
C is the fraction carbon in NMVOC by mass (default = 0.6 for solvent use and 0.85 for other source categories; 
see Tables A7.2 and A7.3 and Gillenwater 2008). 
OF is the oxidation factor of the carbon to carbon dioxide as a fraction. The default assumption is a value of 1. For 
open burning of waste in Volume 5, Chapter 5 a default value of 0.71 for OF is specified (see Table 5.2). 
The carbon content in NMVOCs will vary depending on the source. Therefore, an inventory based on the 
speciation of the NMVOC compounds gives more accurate results. 
In making these estimates inventory compilers should assess each category to ensure that this carbon is not already 
covered by the assumptions and approximations made in estimating CO2 emissions.  
See Table A7.1 for a list of the source categories relevant to the estimation of CO2 from atmospheric oxidation. 
When identifying categories for which these CO2 inputs are to be estimated, it is good practice to prevent double 
counting or omitting of carbon emitted to the atmosphere as CO2. 
NMVOCs do not represent a single molecular species, but instead a broad range of volatile hydrocarbon species 
with varying molecular weights and carbon contents. Therefore, an accurate estimate of emissions of CO2 from 
the atmospheric oxidation of NMVOCs requires a chemical speciation profile of the constituent NMVOCs 
(Gillenwater 2008). 
To estimate CO2 atmospheric inputs from NMVOC emissions the following steps may be used: 
Separate the portion of national NMVOCs emissions resulting from biogenic materials from the portion of 
NMVOC emissions resulting from petroleum or other fossil fuel products. 
Identify the portion of the fossil-based NMVOC emissions resulting from relevant energy and industrial process 
source categories (as determined using Table A7.2). 
For the portion of these NMVOC emissions resulting from solvent use, determine the average carbon content (on 
a mass basis) based on a chemical speciation profile (see Table A7.3 for example). If information on the speciation 
profile is not available, assume a default average carbon content of 60 percent by mass. For the remaining portion 
of relevant NMVOC emissions from other source categories, determine carbon content values using a chemical 
speciation profile. If information on the speciation profile is not available, assume an average default carbon 
content of 85 percent by mass (Gillenwater 2008, and see Table A7.3). 
There is scientific uncertainty regarding the degree to which all CH4 and NMVOCs are completely oxidised to 
CO2 in the atmosphere. There is very low uncertainty in this assumption for CO emissions. Boucher et al. 2009 
assumes 95 percent of emitted CH4 is oxidised, with a range of 51 to 100 percent. NMVOCs include a wide range 
of chemical species with atmospheric lifetimes that primarily range from minutes to months. Although, the fate of 
NMVOCs emitted to the atmosphere is generally oxidation to CO2 through complex chemical and photochemical 
reactions, the fate of a fraction of some NMVOC species can be dry or wet deposition to the Earth’s surface, where 
the carbon they contain may escape complete oxidation to CO2. The above equations assume a complete oxidation 
of NMVOCs, CO and CH4 to CO2 in the atmosphere, however countries may apply oxidation factors less than 1, 
based on scientific evidence.

7.3.1 
Methodology 
All anthropogenic NH3 or NOx emissions are potential sources of N2O emissions8. Specific guidance on estimating 
N2O emissions from that portion of nitrogen compounds associated with the volatilisation of NOx and NH3 from 
(1) manure management systems and applied sewage sludge and (2) synthetic and organic nitrogen input to 
managed soils, and urine and dung nitrogen deposited by grazing animals, are provided in Section 10.5 of Chapter 
10, Emissions from livestock and manure management, and Section 11.2.2 of Chapter 11, N2O emissions from 
managed soils and CO2 emissions from lime and urea application, of Volume 4 of AFOLU.  
This section provides guidance on estimating N2O emissions from the atmospheric deposition of nitrogen 
compounds from all other sources of NOx and NH3 emissions, such as fuel combustion, industrial processes, and 
burning of crop residues and agricultural wastes. The method needs only to be applied where data on NOx and 
NH3 emissions from these sources are available, e.g., from the inventories identified Section 7.2. 
Equation 7.1 and EF4 from Table 11.4, Chapter 11 of Volume 4 can be used to estimate N2O emissions from the 
atmospheric deposition of nitrogen resulting from NOx and NH3.

This method assumes that N2O emissions from atmospheric deposition are reported by the country that produced 
the original NOx and NH3 emissions. In reality, the ultimate formation of N2O may occur in another country due 
to atmospheric transport of emissions. The method also does not account for the probable lag time between NOx 
and NH3 emissions and subsequent production of N2O in soils and surface waters. This time lag is expected to be 
small relative to an annual reporting cycle.  
                                                           
8 In addition to being redeposited on soils and surface waters, NH3 can also lead to the formation of N2O from atmospheric 
chemical reactions. However, there is currently no method available for estimating conversion of NH3 to N2O in the 
atmosphere.

The carbon in CH4, CO, and NMVOC emissions is of both biogenic and fossil origin. Estimates 
of CO2 emissions from the fossil carbon portion of waste materials include the emissions of CO2 
from atmospheric oxidation of CH4, CO and NMVOCs when carbon content factors are used. 
(a) Only gases listed are those relevant to the estimation of CO2 emissions from atmospheric oxidation of CH4, CO and NMVOCs. Emission factors for CO and NMVOC can be found in the EMEP/EEA  
Emission Inventory Guidebook and for CH4 see the relevant chapters/volumes of this 2019 Refinement. 
(b) Assumes that CO2 emissions are estimated using data on the carbon content of fuels or waste materials, not direct measurement. 
(c) CO2 emissions from atmospheric oxidation of CH4, CO and NMVOCs may or may not be accounted for depending on the Oxidized During Use factor assumptions under non-energy use of fuels (2.D). 
(d) Assumes biofuels are reported separately.
