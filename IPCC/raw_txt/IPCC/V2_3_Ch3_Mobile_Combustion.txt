MOBILE COMBUSTION 
3.1 
OVERVIEW 
Mobile sources produce direct greenhouse gas emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous 
oxide (N2O) from the combustion of various fuel types, as well as several other pollutants such as carbon 
monoxide (CO), Non-methane Volatile Organic Compounds (NMVOCs), sulphur dioxide (SO2), particulate 
matter (PM) and oxides of nitrate (NOx), which cause or contribute to local or regional air pollution. This 
chapter covers good practice in the development of estimates for the direct greenhouse gases CO2, CH4, and N2O. 
For indirect greenhouse gases and precursor substances CO, NMVOCs, SO2, PM, and NOx, please refer to 
Volume 1 Chapter 7. This chapter does not address non-energy emissions from mobile air conditioning, which is 
covered by the IPPU Volume (Volume 3, Chapter 7).  
Greenhouse gas emissions from mobile combustion are most easily estimated by major transport activity, i.e., 
road, off-road, air, railways, and water-borne navigation. The source description (Table 3.1.1) shows the 
diversity of mobile sources and the range of characteristics that affect emission factors. Recent work has updated 
and strengthened the data. Despite these advances more work is needed to fill in many gaps in knowledge of 
emissions from certain vehicle types and on the effects of ageing on catalytic control of road vehicle emissions. 
Equally, the information on the appropriate emission factors for road transport in developing countries may need 
further strengthening, where age of fleet, maintenance, fuel sulphur content, and patterns of use are different 
from those in industrialised countries.

3.2 
ROAD TRANSPORTATION 
The mobile source category Road Transportation includes all types of light-duty vehicles such as automobiles 
and light trucks, and heavy-duty vehicles such as tractor trailers and buses, and on-road motorcycles (including 
mopeds, scooters, and three-wheelers). These vehicles operate on many types of gaseous and liquid fuels. In 
addition to emissions from fuel combustion, emissions associated with catalytic converter use in road vehicles 
(e.g., CO2 emissions from catalytic converters using urea) 1 are also addressed in this section.  
3.2.1 
Methodological Issues 
The fundamental methodologies for estimating greenhouse gas emissions from road vehicles, which are 
presented in Section 3.2.1.1, have not changed since the publication of the 1996 IPCC Guidelines and the 
GPG2000, except that, as discussed in Section 3.2.1.2, the emission factors now assume full oxidation of the fuel. 
This is for consistency with the Stationary Combustion Chapter in this Volume. The method for estimating CO2 
emissions from catalytic converters using urea, a source of emissions, was not addressed previously.  
Estimated emissions from road transport can be based on two independent sets of data: fuel sold (see section 
3.2.1.3) and vehicle kilometres. If these are both available it is important to check that they are comparable, 
otherwise estimates of different gases may be inconsistent. This validation step (Figure 3.2.1) is described in 
sections 3.2.1.3 and 3.2.3. It is good practice to perform this validation step if vehicle kilometre data are 
available. 
3.2.1.1 
CHOICE OF METHOD 
Emissions can be estimated from either the fuel consumed (represented by fuel sold) or the distance travelled by 
the vehicles. In general, the first approach (fuel sold) is appropriate for CO2 and the second (distance travelled by 
vehicle type and road type) is appropriate for CH4 and N2O. 
CO 2 EMISSIONS 
Emissions of CO2 are best calculated on the basis of the amount and type of fuel combusted (taken to be equal to 
the fuel sold, see section 3.2.1.3) and its carbon content. Figure 3.2.2 shows the decision tree for CO2 that guides 
the choice of either the Tier 1 or Tier 2 method. Each tier is defined below. 
 
                                                           
1 Urea consumption for catalytic converters in vehicles is directly related to the vehicle fuel consumption and technology.

 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
The Tier 1 approach calculates CO2 emissions by multiplying estimated fuel sold with a default CO2 emission 
factor. The approach is represented in Equation 3.2.1.

NMVOC and particulate matter2. Any carbon in the fuel derived from biomass should be reported as an 
information item and not included in the sectoral or national totals to avoid double counting as the net emissions 
from biomass are already accounted for in the AFOLU sector (see section 3.2.1.4 Completeness).  
The Tier 2 approach is the same as Tier 1 except that country-specific carbon contents of the fuel sold in road 
transport are used. Equation 3.2.1 still applies but the emission factor is based on the actual carbon content of 
fuels consumed (as represented by fuel sold) in the country during the inventory year. At Tier 2, the CO2 
emission factors may be adjusted to take account of un-oxidised carbon or carbon emitted as a non-CO2 gas. 
There is no Tier 3 as it is not possible to produce significantly better results for CO2 than by using the existing 
Tier 2. In order to reduce the uncertainties, efforts should concentrate on the carbon content and on improving 
the data on fuel sold. Another major uncertainty component is the use of transport fuel for non-road purposes. 
CO 2 EMISSIONS FROM UREA-BASED CATALYSTS 
For estimating CO2 emissions from use of urea-based additives in catalytic converters (non-combustive 
emissions), it is good practice to use Equation 3.2.2:

Activity

Purity 
 
 = the mass fraction (= percentage divided by 100) of urea in the urea-based additive 
The factor (12/60) captures the stochiometric conversion from urea (CO(NH2)2) to carbon, while factor (44/12) 
converts carbon to CO2. On the average, the activity level is 1 to 3 percent of diesel consumption by the vehicle. 
Thirty two and half percent can be taken as default purity in case country-specific values are not available 
(Peckham, 2003). As this is based on the properties of the materials used, there are no tiers for this source. 
CH 4 AND N 2O EMISSIONS 
Emissions of CH4 and N2O are more difficult to estimate accurately than those for CO2 because emission factors 
depend on vehicle technology, fuel and operating characteristics. Both distance-based activity data (e.g. vehicle-
kilometres travelled) and disaggregated fuel consumption may be considerably less certain than overall fuel sold. 
CH4 and N2O emissions are significantly affected by the distribution of emission controls in the fleet. Thus 
higher tiers use an approach taking into account populations of different vehicle types and their different 
pollution control technologies.  
                                                           
2 Research on carbon mass balances for U.S. light-duty gasoline cars and trucks indicates that “the fraction of solid 
(unoxidized) carbon is negligible” USEPA (2004a). This did not address two-stroke engines or fuel types other than 
gasoline. Additional discussion of the 100 percent oxidation assumption is included in Section 1.4.2.1 of the Energy 
Volume Introduction chapter.  
Chapter 3: Mobile Combustion  
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.13 
Although CO2 emissions from biogenic carbon are not included in national totals, the combustion of biofuels in 
mobile sources generates anthropogenic CH4 and N2O that should be calculated and reported in emissions 
estimates. 
The decision tree in Figure 3.2.3 outlines choice of method for calculating emissions of CH4 and N2O. The 
inventory compiler should choose the method on the basis of the existence and quality of data. The tiers are 
defined in the corresponding equations 3.2.3 to 3.2.5, below.   
Three alternative approaches can be used to estimate CH4 and N2O emissions from road vehicles: one is based 
on vehicle kilometres travelled (VKT) and two are based on fuel sold. The Tier 3 approach requires detailed, 
country-specific data to generate activity-based emission factors for vehicle subcategories and may involve 
national models. Tier 3 calculates emissions by multiplying emission factors by vehicle activity levels (e.g., 
VKT) for each vehicle subcategory and possible road type. Vehicle subcategories are based on vehicle type, age, 
and emissions control technology. The Tier 2 approach uses fuel-based emission factors specific to vehicle 
subcategories. Tier 1, which uses fuel-based emission factors, may be used if it is not possible to estimate fuel 
consumption by vehicle type.  
The equation for the Tier 1 method for estimating CH4 and N2O from road vehicles may be expressed as:

as an alternative, IEA or UN international data sources (all values should be reported in terajoules).  
• 
Step 2: For each fuel type, multiply the amount of fuel consumed by the appropriate CH4 and N2O default 
emission factors. Default emission factors may be found in the next Section 3.2.1.2 (Emission Factors).

Step 3: Emissions of each pollutant are summed across all fuel types.

Vehicle type should follow the reporting classification 1.A.3.b (i to iv) (i.e., passenger, light-duty or heavy-duty 
for road vehicles, motorcycles) and preferably be further split by vehicle age (e.g., up to 3 years old, 3-8 years, 
older than 8 years) to enable categorization of vehicles by control technology (e.g., by inferring technology 
adoption as a function of policy implementation year). Where possible, fuel type should be split by sulphur 
content to allow for delineation of vehicle categories according to emission control system, because the emission 
control system operation is dependent upon the use of low sulphur fuel during the whole system lifespan3. 
Without considering this aspect, CH4 may be underestimated. This applies to Tiers 2 and 3.

It may not be possible to split by road type in which case this can be ignored. Often emission models such as the 
USEPA MOVES or MOBILE models, or the EEA’s COPERT model will be used (USEPA 2005a, USEPA 
2005b, EEA 2005, respectively). These include detailed fleet models that enable a range of vehicle types and 
control technologies to be considered as well as fleet models to estimate VKT driven by these vehicle types. 
Emission models can help to ensure consistency and transparency because the calculation procedures may be 
fixed in software packages that may be used. It is good practice to clearly document any modifications to 
standardised models. 
Additional emissions occur when the engines are cold, and this can be a significant contribution to total 
emissions from road vehicles. These should be included in Tier 3 models. Total emissions are calculated by 
summing emissions from the different phases, namely the thermally stabilized engine operation (hot) and the 
warming-up phase (cold start) – Eq 3.2.5 above. Cold starts are engine starts that occur when the engine 
temperature is below that at which the catalyst starts to operate (light-off threshold, roughly 300oC) or before the 
engine reaches its normal operation temperature for non-catalyst equipped vehicles. These have higher CH4 (and 
CO and HC) emissions. Research has shown that 180-240 seconds is the approximate average cold start mode 
duration. The cold start emission factors should therefore be applied only for this initial fraction of a vehicle’s 
journey (up to around 3 km) and then the running emission factors should be applied. Please refer to USEPA 
(2004b) and EEA (2005a) for further details. The cold start emissions can be quantified in different ways. Table 
3.2.3 (USEPA 2004b) gives additional emissions per start. This is added to the running emission and so requires 
knowledge of the number of starts per vehicle per year4. This can be derived through knowledge of the average 
trip length. The European model COPERT has more complex temperature dependant corrections for the cold 
start (EEA 2000) for methane.  
                                                           
3  This especially applies to countries where fuels with different sulphur contents are sold (e.g. “metropolitan” diesel). Some 
control systems (for example, diesel exhaust catalyst converters) require ultra low sulphur fuels (e.g. diesel with 50 ppm S 
or less) to be operational. Higher sulphur levels deteriorate such systems, increasing emissions of CH4 as well as nitrogen 
oxides, particulates and hydrocarbons. Deteriorated catalysts do not effectively convert nitrogen oxides to N2, which could 
result in changes in emission rates of N2O. This could also result from irregular misfuelling with high sulphur fuel. 
4  This simple method of adding to the running emission the cold start (= number of starts • cold start factor) assumes 
individual trips are longer than 4 km. 
Volume 2: Energy   
    
3.16 
 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Both Equation 3.2.4 and 3.2.5 for Tier 2 and 3 methods involves the following steps: 
• 
Step 1: Obtain or estimate the amount of fuel consumed by fuel type for road transportation using national 
data (all values should be reported in terajoules; please also refer to Section 3.2.1.3.)  
• 
Step 2: Ensure that fuel data or VKT is split into the vehicle and fuel categories required. It should be taken 
into consideration that, typically, emissions and distance travelled each year vary according to the age of the 
vehicle; the older vehicles tend to travel less but may emit more CH4 per unit of activity. Some vehicles may 
have been converted to operate on a different type of fuel than their original design.  
• 
Step 3: Multiply the amount of fuel consumed (Tier 2), or the distance travelled (Tier 3) by each type of 
vehicle or vehicle/control technology, by the appropriate emission factor for that type. The emission factors 
presented in the EFDB or Tables 3.2.3 to 3.2.5 may be used as a starting point. However, the inventory 
compiler is encouraged to consult other data sources referenced in this chapter or locally available data 
before determining appropriate national emission factors for a particular subcategory. Established inspection 
and maintenance programmes may be a good local data source.  
• 
Step 4: For Tier 3 approaches estimate cold start emissions.  
• 
Step 5: Sum the emissions across all fuel and vehicle types, including for all levels of emission control, to 
determine total emissions from road transportation. 
3.2.1.2 
CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTORS 
Inventory compilers should choose default (Tier 1) or country-specific (Tier 2 and Tier 3) emission factors based 
on the application of the decision trees which consider the type and level of disaggregation of activity data 
available for their country. 
CO 2 EMISSIONS 
CO2 emission factors are based on the carbon content of the fuel and should represent 100 percent oxidation of 
the fuel carbon. It is good practice to follow this approach using country-specific net-calorific values (NCV) and 
CO2 emission factor data if possible. Default NCV of fuels and CO2 emission factors (in Table 3.2.1 below) are 
presented in Tables 1.2 and 1.4, respectively, of the Introduction Chapter of this Volume and may be used when 
country-specific data are unavailable. Inventory compilers are encouraged to consult the IPCC Emission Factor 
Database (EFDB, see Volume 1) for applicable emission factors. It is good practice to ensure that default 
emission factors, if selected, are appropriate to local fuel quality and composition.

At Tier 1, the emission factors should assume that 100 percent of the carbon present in fuel is oxidized during or 
immediately following the combustion process (for all fuel types in all vehicles) irrespective of whether the CO2 
Chapter 3: Mobile Combustion

has been emitted as CO2, CH4, CO or NMVOC or as particulate matter. At higher tiers the CO2 emission factors 
may be adjusted to take account of un-oxidised carbon or carbon emitted as a non-CO2 gas. 
CO 2 EMISSIONS FROM BIOFUELS 
The use of liquid and gaseous biofuels has been observed in mobile combustion applications (see Box 3.2.1). To 
properly address the related emissions from biofuel combusted in road transportation, biofuel-specific emission 
factors should be used, when activity data on biofuel use are available. CO2 emissions from the combustion of 
the biogenic carbon of these fuels are treated in the AFOLU sector and should be reported separately as an 
information item. To avoid double counting, the inventory compiler should determine the proportions of fossil 
versus biogenic carbon in any fuel-mix which is deemed commercially relevant and therefore to be included in 
the inventory.  
There are a number of different options for the use of liquid and gaseous biofuels in mobile combustion (see 
Table 1.1 of the Introduction chapter of this Volume for biofuel definitions). Some biofuels have found 
widespread commercial use in some countries driven by specific policies. Biofuels can either be used as pure 
fuel or as additives to regular commercial fossil fuels. The latter approach usually avoids the need for engine 
modifications or re-certification of existing engines for new fuels.  
To avoid double counting, over or under-reporting of CO2 emissions, it is important to assess the biofuel origin 
so as to identify and separate fossil from biogenic feedstocks5. This is because CO2 emissions from biofuels will 
be reported separately as an information item to avoid double counting, since it is already treated in the AFOLU 
Volume. The share of biogenic carbon in the fuel can be acknowledged by either refining activity data (e.g. 
subtracting the amount of non-fossil inputs to the combusted biofuel or biofuel blend) or emission factors (e.g. 
multiplying the fossil emission factor by its fraction in the combusted biofuel or biofuel blend, to obtain a new 
emission factor), but not both simultaneously. If national consumption of these fuels is commercially significant, 
the biogenic and fossil carbon streams need to be accurately accounted for thus avoiding double counting with 
refinery and petrochemical processes or the waste sector (recognising the possibility of double counting or 
omission of, for example, landfill gas or waste cooking oil as biofuel). Double counting or omission of landfill 
gas or waste cooking oil as biofuel should be avoided. 
CH 4 AND N 2O  
CH4 and N2O emission rates depend largely upon the combustion and emission control technology present in the 
vehicles; therefore default fuel-based emission factors that do not specify vehicle technology are highly 
uncertain. Even if national data are unavailable on vehicle distances travelled by vehicle type, inventory 
compilers are encouraged to use higher tiered emission factors and calculate vehicle distance travelled data based 
on national road transportation fuel use data and an assumed fuel economy value (see 3.2.1.3 Choice of Activity 
Data) for related guidance. 
If CH4 and N2O emissions from mobile sources are not a key category, default CH4 and N2O emission factors 
presented in Table 3.2.2 may be used when national data are unavailable. When using these default values, 
inventory compilers should note the assumed fuel economy values that were used for unit conversions and the 
representative vehicle categories that were used as the basis of the default factors (see table notes for specific 
assumptions).  
It is good practice to ensure that default emission factors, if selected, best represent local fuel 
quality/composition and combustion or emission control technology. If biofuels are included in national road 
transportation fuel use estimates, biofuel-specific emission factors should be used and associated CH4 and N2O 
emissions should be included in national totals.  
Because CH4 and N2O emission rates are largely dependent upon the combustion and emission control 
technology present, technology-specific emission factors should be used, if CH4 and N2O emissions from mobile 
sources are a key category. Tables 3.2.3 and 3.2.5 give potentially applicable Tier 2 and Tier 3 emission factors 
from US and European data respectively. In addition, the U.S. has developed emission factors for some 
alternative fuel vehicles (Table 3.2.4). The IPCC EFDB and scientific literature may also provide emission 
factors (or standard emission estimation models) which inventory compilers may use, if appropriate to national 
circumstances. 
                                                           
5  For example, biodiesel made from coal methanol with animal feedstocks has a non-zero fossil fuel fraction and is therefore 
not fully carbon neutral. Ethanol from the fermentation of agricultural products will generally be purely biogenic (carbon 
neutral), except in some cases, such as fossil-fuel derived methanol. Products which have undergone further chemical 
transformation may contain substantial amounts of fossil carbon ranging from about 5-10 percent in the fossil methanol 
used for biodiesel production upwards to 46 percent in ethyl-tertiary-butyl-ether (ETBE) from fossil isobutene 
(ADEME/DIREM, 2002). Some processes may generate biogenic by-products such as glycol or glycerine, which may then 
be used elsewhere.

BOX 3.2.1 
EXAMPLES OF BIOFUEL USE IN ROAD TRANSPORTATION 
Examples of biofuel use in road transportation include: 
• Ethanol is typically produced through the fermentation of sugar cane, sugar beets, grain, corn or 
potatoes. It may be used neat (100 percent, Brazil) or blended with gasoline in varying volumes (5-
12 percent in Europe and North America, 10 percent in India, while 25 percent is common in 
Brazil). The biogenic portion of pure ethanol is 100 percent. 
• Biodiesel is a fuel made from the trans-esterification of vegetable oils (e.g., rape, soy, mustard, 
sun-flower), animal fats or recycled cooking oils. It is non-toxic, biodegradable and essentially 
sulphur-free and can be used in any diesel engine either in its pure form (B100 or neat Biodiesel) 
or in a blend with petroleum diesel (B2 and B20, which contain 2 and 20 per cent biodiesel by 
volume). B100 may contain 10 percent fossil carbon from the methanol (made from natural gas) 
used in the esterification process. 
• Ethyl-tertiary-butyl-ether (ETBE) is used as a high octane blending component in gasoline (e.g., 
in France and Spain in blends of up to 15 percent content). The most common source is the 
etherification of ethanol from the fermentation of sugar beets, grain and potatoes with fossil 
isobutene.  
• Gaseous Biomass (landfill gas, sludge gas, and other biogas) produced by the anaerobic 
digestion of organic matter is occasionally used in some European countries (e.g. Sweden and 
Switzerland). Landfill and sewage gas are common sources of gaseous biomass currently.  
Other potential future commercial biofuels for use in mobile combustion include those derived 
from lignocellulosic biomass. Lignocellulosic feedstock materials include cereal straw, woody 
biomass, corn stover (dried leaves and stems), or similar energy crops. A range of varying 
extraction and transformation processes permit the production of additional biogenic fuels (e.g., 
methanol,dimethyl-ether (DME), and methyl-tetrahydrofuran (MTHF)). 
 
It is good practice to select or develop an emission factor based on all the following criteria: 
• 
Fuel type (gasoline, diesel, natural gas) considering, if possible, fuel composition (studies have shown that 
decreasing fuel sulphur level may lead to significant reductions in N2O emissions6) 
• 
Vehicle type (i.e. passenger cars, light trucks, heavy trucks, motorcycles) 
• 
Emission control technology considering the presence and performance (e.g., as function of age) of catalytic 
converters (e.g., typical catalysts convert nitrogen oxides to N2, and CH4 into CO2). Díaz et al (2001) reports 
catalyst conversion efficiency for total hydrocarbons (THCs), of which CH4 is a component, of 92 (+/- 6) 
percent in a 1993-1995 fleet. Considerable deterioration of catalysts with relatively high mileage 
accumulation; specifically, THC levels remained steady until approximately 60 000 kilometers, then 
increased by 33 percent to between 60 000 to 100 000 kilometres.  
• 
The impact of operating conditions (e.g., speed, road conditions, and driving patterns, which all affect fuel 
economy and vehicle systems’ performance)7. 
• 
Consideration that any alternative fuel emission factor estimates tend to have a high degree of uncertainty, 
given the wide range of engine technologies and the small sample sizes associated with existing studies8.  
The following section provides a method for developing CH4 emission factors from THC values. Well conducted 
and documented inspection and maintenance (I/M) programmes may provide a source of national data for 
emission factors by fuel, model, and year as well as annual mileage accumulation rates. Although some I/M 
programmes may only have available emission factors for new vehicles and local air pollutants, (sometimes 
called regulated pollutants, e.g. NOx, PM, NMVOCs, THCs), it may be possible to derive CH4 or N2O emission 
factors from these data. A CH4 emission factor may be calculated as the difference between emission factors for 
THCs and NMVOCs. In many countries, CH4 emissions from vehicles are not directly measured. They are a

emissions.

fraction of THCs, which is more commonly obtained through laboratory measurements. USEPA (1997) and 
Borsari (2005) and CETESB (2004 & 2005) provide conversion factors for reporting hydrocarbon emissions in 
different forms. Based on these sources, the following ratios of CH4 to THC may be used to develop CH4 
emission factors from country-specific THC data9:  
• 
2-stroke gasoline: 0.9 percent,  
• 
4-stroke gasoline: 10-25 percent,  
• 
diesel: 1.6 percent,  
• 
LPG: 29.6 percent,  
• 
natural gas vehicles: 88.0-95.2 percent,  
• 
gasohol E22: 24.3-25.5 percent, and 
• 
ethanol hydrated E100: 26.0-27.2 percent. 
Some I/M programmes may collect data on evaporatives, which may be assumed to be equal to NMVOCs.10 
Recent and ongoing research has investigated the relationship between N2O and NOx emissions. Useful data may 
become available from this work11. 
Further refinements in the factors can be made if additional local data (e.g. on average driving speeds, climate, 
altitude, pollution control devices, or road conditions) are available, for example, by scaling emission factors to 
reflect the national circumstances by multiplying by an adjustment factor (e.g., traffic congestion or severe 
loading). Emission factors for both CH4 and N2O are established not just during a representative compliance 
driving test, but also specifically tested during running conditions and cold start conditions. Thus, data collected 
on the driving patterns in a country (based on the relationship of starts to running distances) can be used to adjust 
the emission factors for CH4 and N2O. Although ambient temperature has been shown to have impacts on local 
air pollutants, there is limited research on the effects of temperature on CH4 and N2O (USEPA 2004b). Please 
see Box 3.2.2 for information on refining emission factors for mobile sources in developing countries.

REFINING EMISSION FACTORS FOR MOBILE SOURCES IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES 
In some developing countries, the estimated emission rates per kilometre travelled may need to be 
altered to accommodate national circumstances, which could include: 
•Technology variations - In many cases due to tampering of emission control systems, fuel 
adulteration, or simply vehicle age, some vehicles may be operating without a functioning catalytic 
converter. Consequently, N2O emissions may be low and CH4 may be high when catalytic 
converters are not present or operating improperly. Díaz et al (2001) provides information on THC 
values for Mexico City and catalytic converter efficiency as a function of age and mileage, and this 
also chapter provides guidance on developing CH4 factors from THC data.  
▪ Engine loading - Due to traffic density or challenging topography, the number of accelerations 
and decelerations that a local vehicle encounters may be significantly greater than that for 
corresponding travel in countries where emission factors were developed. This happens when these 
countries have well established road and traffic control networks. Increased engine loading may 
correlate with higher CH4 and N2O emissions. 
▪ Fuel Composition - Poor fuel quality and high or varying sulphur content may adversely affect 
the performance of engines and conversion efficiency of post-combustion emission control devices 
such as catalytic converters. For example, N2O emission rates have been shown to increase with 
the sulphur content in fuels (UNFCCC, 2004). The effects of sulphur content on CH4 emissions are 
not known. Refinery data may indicate production quantities on a national scale.  
Section 3.2.2 Uncertainty Assessment provides information on how to develop uncertainty 
estimates for emission factors for road transportation. 
Further information on emission factors for developing countries is available from Mitra et al. 
(2004).

Sources: USEPA (2004b), EEA (2005a), TNO (2003) and Borsari (2005) CETESB (2004 & 2005) with assumptions given 
below. Uncertainty ranges were derived from data in Lipman and Delucchi (2002), except for ethanol in cars. 
(a) Except for LPG and ethanol cars, default values are derived from the sources indicated using the NCV values reported in 
the Energy Volume Introduction chapter; density values reported by the U.S. Energy Information Administration; and the 
following assumed representative fuel consumption values: 10 km/l for motor gasoline vehicles; 5 km/l for diesel vehicles; 9 
km/l for natural gas vehicles (assumed equivalent to gasoline vehicles); 9 km/l for ethanol vehicles. If actual representative 
fuel economy values are available, it is recommended that they be used with total fuel use data to estimate total distance 
travelled data, which should then be multiplied by Tier 2 emission factors for N2O and CH4.  
(b) Motor gasoline uncontrolled default value is based on USEPA (2004b) value for a USA light duty gasoline vehicle (car) – 
uncontrolled, converted using values and assumptions described in table note (a). If motorcycles account for a significant 
share of the national vehicle population, inventory compilers should adjust the given default emission factor downwards. 
(c) Motor gasoline – light duty vehicle oxidation catalyst default value is based on the USEPA (2004b) value for a USA Light 
Duty Gasoline Vehicle (Car) – Oxidation Catalyst, converted using values and assumptions described in table note (a). If 
motorcycles account for a significant share of the national vehicle population, inventory compilers should adjust the given 
default emission factor downwards. 
(d) Motor gasoline – light duty vehicle vintage 1995 or later default value is based on the USEPA (2004b) value for a USA 
Light Duty Gasoline Vehicle (Car) – Tier 1, converted using values and assumptions described in table note (a). If 
motorcycles account for a significant share of the national vehicle population, inventory compilers should adjust the given 
default emission factor downwards. 
(e) Diesel default value is based on the EEA (2005a) value for a European heavy duty diesel truck, converted using values and 
assumptions described in table note (a). 
(f) Natural gas default and lower values were based on a study by TNO (2003), conducted using European vehicles and test 
cycles in the Netherlands. There is a lot of uncertainties for N2O. The USEPA (2004b) has a default value of 350 kg CH4/TJ 
and 28 kg N2O/TJ for a USA CNG car, converted using values and assumptions described in table note (a). Upper and lower 
limits are also taken from USEPA (2004b) 
(g) The default value for methane emissions from LPG, considering for 50 MJ/kg low heating value and 3.1 g CH4/kg LPG 
was obtained from TNO (2003). Uncertainty ranges have not been provided. 
(h) Ethanol default value is based on the USEPA (2004b) value for a USA ethanol heavy duty truck, converted using values 
and assumptions described in table note (a). 
(i) Data obtained in Brazilian vehicles by Borsari (2005) and CETESB (2004 & 2005). For new 2003 models, best case: 51.3 
kg THC/TJ fuel and 26.0 percent CH4 in THC. For 5 years old vehicles: 67 kg THC/TJ fuel and 27.2 percent CH4 in THC. For 
10 years old: 308 kg THC/TJ fuel and 27.2 percent CH4 in THC.

2 The urban emission factor is distinguished into cold and hot for passenger cars and light duty trucks. The cold emission 
 factor is relevant for trips which start with the engine at ambient temperature. A typical allocation of the annual mileage of a 
 passenger car into the different driving conditions could be: 0.3/0.1/0.3/0.3 for urban cold, urban hot, rural and 
 highway respectively. 
3 Passenger car emission factors are also proposed for light duty vehicles when no more detailed information exists. 
4 The sulphur content of gasoline has both a cumulative and an immediate effect on N2O emissions. The emission factors for 
 gasoline passenger cars correspond to fuels at the period of registration of the different technologies and a vehicle fleet of 
 ~50 000 km average mileage. 
5 N2O and CH4 emission factors from heavy duty vehicles and power two wheelers are also expected to depend on vehicle 
 technology. There is no adequate experimental information though to quantify this effect. 
6 N2O emission factors from diesel and LPG passenger cars vehicles are proposed by TNO (2002). Increase in diesel N2O 
 emissions as technology improves may be quite uncertain but is also consistent with the developments in the after treatment 
 systems used in diesel engines (new catalysts, SCR-DeNOx).

3.2.1.3 
CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
Activity data may be provided either by fuel consumption or by vehicle kilometres travelled VKT. Use of 
adequate VKT data can be used to check top-down inventories. 
FUEL CONSUMPTION 
Emissions from road vehicles should be attributed to the country where the fuel is sold; therefore fuel 
consumption data should reflect fuel that is sold within the country’s territories. Such energy data are typically 
available from the national statistical agency. In addition to fuel sold data collected nationally, inventory 
compilers should collect activity data on other fuels used in that country with minor distributions that are not part 
of the national statistics (i.e., fuels that are not widely consumed, including those in niche markets such as 
compressed natural gas or biofuels). These data are often also available from the national statistical agency or 
they may be accounted for under separate tax collection processes. For Tier 3 methods, the MOBILE or 
COPERT models may help develop activity data. 
It is good practice to check the following factors (as a minimum) before using the fuel sold data: 
• 
Does the fuel data relate to on-road only or include off-road vehicles as well? National statistics may report 
total transportation fuel without specifying fuel consumed by on-road and off-road activities. It is important 
to ensure that fuel use data for road vehicles excludes that used for off-road vehicles or machinery (see Off-
Road Transportation Section 3.3). Fuels may be taxed differently based on their intended use. A Road-Taxed 
fuel survey may provide an indication of the quantity of fuel sold for on-road use. Typically, the on-road 
vehicle fleet and associated fuel sales are better documented than the off-road vehicle population and 
activity. This fact should be considered when developing emission estimates.  
• 
Is agricultural fuel use included? Some of this may be stationary use while some will be for mobile sources. 
However, much of this will not be on-road use and should not be included here. 
• 
Is fuel sold for transportation uses used for other purposes (e.g., as fuel for a stationary boiler), or vice versa? 
For example, in countries where kerosene is subsidized to lower its price for residential heating and cooking, 
the national statistics may allocate the associated kerosene consumption to the residential sector even though 
substantial amounts of kerosene may have been blended into and consumed with transportation fuels. 
• 
How are biofuels accounted for? 
• 
How are blended fuels reported and accounted for? Accounting for official blends (e.g. addition of 25 
percent of ethanol in gasoline) in activity data is straightforward, but if fuel adulteration or tampering (e.g. 
spent solvents in gasoline, kerosene in diesel fuel) is prevalent in a country, appropriate adjustments should 
be applied to fuel data, taking care to avoid double counting. 
• 
Are the statistics affected by fuel tourism?  
• 
Is there significant fuel smuggling?  
• 
How is the use of lubricants as an additive in 2-stroke fuels reported? It may be included in the road 
transport fuel use or may be reported separately as a lubricant (see Box 3.2.4.). 
Two alternative approaches are suggested to separate non-road and on-road fuel use: 
(1) For each major fuel type, estimate the fuel used by each road vehicle type from vehicle kilometres travelled 
data. The difference between this road vehicle total and the apparent consumption is attributed to the off-road 
sector; or 
(2) The same fuel-specific estimate in (1) is supplemented by a similarly structured bottom-up estimate of off-
road fuel use from a knowledge of the off-road equipment types and their usage. The apparent consumption in 
the transportation sector is then disaggregated according to each vehicle type and the off-road sector in 
proportion to the bottom-up estimates. 
Depending on national circumstances, inventory compilers may need to adjust national statistics on road 
transportation fuel use to prevent under- or over-reporting emissions from road vehicles. It is good practice to 
adjust national fuel sales statistics to ensure that the data used just reflects on-road use. Where this adjustment is 
necessary it is good practice to cross-check with the other appropriate sectors to ensure that any fuel removed 
from on-road statistics is added to the appropriate sector, or vice versa. 
As validation, and if distance travelled data are available (see below vehicle kilometres travelled), it is good 
practice to estimate fuel use from the distance travelled data. The first step (Equation 3.2.6) is to estimate fuel 
consumed by vehicle type i and fuel type j.

t

If data are not available on the distance travelled on different road types, this equation should be simplified by 
removing the “t” the type of road. More detailed estimates are also possible including the additional fuel used 
during the cold start phase. 
It is good practice to compare the fuel sold statistics used in the Tier 1 approach with the result of equation 3.2.6. 
It is good practice to consider any differences and determine which data is of higher quality. Except in rare cases 
(e.g. large quantities of fuel sold for off-road uses, extensive fuel smuggling), fuel sold statistics are likely to be 
more reliable. This provides an important quality check. Significant differences between the results of two 
approaches may indicate that one or both sets of statistics may have errors, and that there is need for further 
analysis. Areas of investigation to pursue when reconciling fuel sold statistics and vehicle kilometre travelled 
data are listed in Section 3 2.3, Inventory quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC).  
Distance travelled data for vehicles by type and fuel are important underpinnings for the higher tier calculations 
of CH4 and N2O emissions from road transport. So it may be necessary to adjust the distance travelled data to be 
consistent with the fuel sold data before proceeding to estimating emissions of CH4 and N2O. This is especially 
important in cases where the discrepancy between the estimated fuel use (Eq 3.2.6) and the statistical fuel sold is 
significant compared to the uncertainties in fuel sold statistics. Inventory compilers will have to use their 
judgement on the best way of adjusting distance travelled data. This could be done pro rata with the same 
adjustment factor applied to all vehicle type and road type classes or, where some data are judged to be more 
accurate, different adjustments could be applied to different vehicle types and road types. An example of the 
latter could be where the data on vehicle travelled on major highways is believed to be reasonably well known 
and on the other hand rural traffic is poorly measured. In any case, the adjustments made for reasons of the 
choice of adjustment factor and background data as well as any other checks should be well documented and 
reviewed. 
VEHICLE KILOMETRES TRAVELLED (VKT) 
While fuel data can be used at Tier 1 for CH4 and N2O, higher tiers also need vehicle kilometres travelled (VKT) 
by vehicle type, fuel type and possibly road type as well.  
Many countries collect, measure, or otherwise estimate VKT. Often this is done by sample surveys counting 
vehicle numbers passing fixed points. These surveys can be automatic or manual and count vehicle numbers by 
type of vehicle. There may be differences between the vehicle classification used in the counts and other data 
(e.g. tax classes) that also give data on vehicle numbers. In addition they are unlikely to differentiate between 
similar vehicle using different fuels (e.g. motor gasoline and diesel cars). Sometimes more detailed information 
is also collected (e.g. vehicle speeds as well as numbers) especially where more detailed traffic planning has 
been performed. This may only be available for a municipality rather than the whole country. From these traffic 
counts, transport authorities can make estimates of the total VKT travelled in a country. Alternatives ways to 
determine the mileage are direct surveys of vehicle owners (private and commercial) and use of administrative 
records for commercial vehicles, taking care to account for outdated registration records for scrapped vehicles 
(Box 3.2.3 provides an approach to estimate the remaining fleets). 
Where VKT is estimated in a country it is good practice to use this data, especially to validate the fuel sold data 
(see section 3.2.1.4). 
Chapter 3: Mobile Combustion

3.27 
OTHER PARAMETERS. 
If CH4 or N2O emissions from road transportation are a key category, it is good practice to obtain more 
information on parameters that influence emission factors to ensure the activity data is compatible with the 
applicable Tier 2 or Tier 3 emission factor. This will require more dissagregated activity data in order to 
implement Equation 3.2.3 or 3.2.5: 
• 
the amount of fuel consumed (in terajoules) by fuel type (all tiers);  
• 
for each fuel type, the amount of fuel (or VKT driven) that is consumed by each representative vehicle type 
(e.g., passenger, light-duty or heavy-duty for road vehicles) preferably with age categories (Tiers 2 and 3); 
and 
• 
the emission control technology (e.g., three-way catalysts) (Tiers 2 and 3). 
• 
It may also be possible to collect VKT data by type of road (e.g. urban, rural, highway)  
If the distribution of fuel use by vehicle and fuel type is unknown, it may be estimated from the number of 
vehicles by type. If the number of vehicles by vehicle and fuel type is not known, it may be estimated from 
national statistics (see below).  
Vehicle technology, which is usually directly linked to the model and year of vehicle, affects CH4 and N2O 
emissions. Therefore, for Tier 2 and Tier 3 methods, activity data should be grouped based on Original 
Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) emission control technologies fitted to vehicle types in the fleet. The fleet age 
distribution helps stratify the fleet into age and subsequently technology classes. If the distribution is not 
available, vehicle deterioration curves may be used to estimate vehicle lifespan and therefore the number of 
vehicles remaining in service based on the number introduced annually (see Box 3.2.3). 
In addition, if possible, determine (through estimates or from national statistics) the total distance travelled (i.e., 
VKT) by each vehicle technology type (Tier 3). If VKT data are not available, they can be estimated based on 
fuel consumption and assumed national fuel economy values. To estimate VKT using road transport fuel use 
data, convert fuel data to volume units (litres) and then multiply the fuel-type total by an assumed fuel economy 
value representative of the national vehicle population for that fuel type (km/l).  
If using the Tier 3 method and national VKT statistics are available, the fuel consumption associated with these 
distance-travelled figures should be calculated and aggregated by fuel for comparison with national energy 
balance figures. Like the Tier 2 method, for Tier 3 it is suggested to further subdivide each vehicle type into 
uncontrolled and key classes of emission control technology. It should be taken into consideration that typically, 
emissions and distance travelled each year vary according to the age of the vehicle; the older vehicles tend to 
travel less but may emit more CH4 and N2O per unit of activity. Some vehicles, especially in developing 
countries, may have been converted to operate on a different type of fuel than their original design.  
To implement the Tier 2 or 3 method, activity data may be derived from a number of possible sources. Vehicle 
inspection and maintenance (I/M) programmes, where operating, may provide insight into annual mileage 
accumulation rates. National vehicle licensing records may provide fleet information (counts of vehicles per 
model-year per region) and may even record mileage between license renewals. Other sources for developing 
activity data include vehicle sales, import, and export records.  
Alternatively, vehicle stocks may be estimated from the number of new vehicle imports and sales by type, fuel 
and model year. The populations of vehicles remaining in service may be estimated by applying scrappage or 
attrition curves. 
Higher tier methods involving an estimate of cold start emissions require knowledge of the number of starts. 
This can be derived from the total distance travelled and the average trip length. Typically, this can be obtained 
from traffic surveys. This data is often collected for local or traffic studies for transport planning.

VEHICLE DETERIORATION (SCRAPPAGE) CURVES 
Deterioration (scrappage) curves can be used to adjust data obtained from fleet statistics based on 
vehicle licensing plates, where older vehicles are out of service but still registered in official 
records, leading to overestimation of emissions. They are approximated by Gompertz functions 
limiting maximum vehicle age.  
In the case of Brazil, the maximum vehicle age of 40 years was used for the National 
Communication of Greenhouse Gases (MCT,2002 and  
http://www.mct.gov.br/clima/comunic_old/veicul03.htm )  
utilizing the S-shaped Gompertz scrapping curve illustrated in this box, Vehicle Scrappage 
Function. This curve was provided by Petrobras, and is currently utilized by environmental 
agencies for emission inventories. The share of scrapped vehicles aged t is defined by the equation 
S(t) = exp [ - exp (a + b(t)) ]; where (t) is the age of the vehicle (in years) and S(t) is the fraction of 
scrapped vehicles aged t. In the year 1994, national values were provided for automobiles (a = 
1.798 and b= -0.137) and light commercial vehicles (a= 1.618 and b= -0.141).

3.2.1.4 
COMPLETENESS 
In establishing completeness, it is recommended that:  
• 
Where cross-border transfers take place in vehicle tanks, emissions from road vehicles should be attributed 
to the country where the fuel is loaded into the vehicle.  
• 
Carbon emitted from oxygenates and other blending agents which are derived from biomass should be 
estimated and reported as an information item to avoid double counting, as required by Volume 1. For more 
information on biofuels, see section 3.2.1.2.  
• 
Ensure the reliability of the fuel sold data by following the recommendations listed in Section 3.2.1.3. 
• 
Emissions from lubricants that are intentionally mixed with fuel and combusted in road vehicles should be 
captured as mobile source emissions. For more information on combustion of lubricants, please refer to Box 
3.2.4 
Chapter 3: Mobile Combustion  
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.29 
BOX 3.2.4  
LUBRICANTS IN MOBILE COMBUSTION 
Lubrication of a two-stroke petrol engine is conceptually quite different from that of a four-stroke 
engine, as it is not possible to have a separate lubricating oil sump. A two-stroke petrol engine 
should be lubricated by a mixture of lubricating oil and petrol in suitable proportion according to 
the manufacturer's recommendations. Depending on the engine type, mixtures of 1:25, 1:33 and 
1:50 are common.  
In the latest generation two-stroke engines, the lubricating oil is directly injected by an accurate 
metering device from a separate tank into the petrol in quantities that depend on the speed and load 
of the engine. Older or inexpensive two-stroke engines will receive the lubricant as part of the fuel 
mixture. Often these mixtures are prepared by the fuel supplier and delivered to the gas station but 
sometimes the vehicle owner will add oil at the service station. In some countries two stroke 
engines have been historically very significant as recent as the 1990’s (e.g. Eastern Europe) or are 
still very significant (e.g. India and parts of South-East Asia).  
The classification of these lubricants in energy statistics as lubricant or fuel may vary. Inventory 
compilers need to make sure that these lubricants are allocated to end use appropriately, accounted 
for properly, and that double counting or omission is avoided (compare treatment of lubricants in 
Volume 3 Chapter 5: Non-energy product and feedstock use of fuels). Lubricants intentionally 
mixed with fuel and combusted in road vehicles should be reported as energy and the associated 
emissions calculated using mobile source guidelines. When the chosen activity data for 2-stroke 
engines are based on kilometres travelled, the added lubricants should be considered in the fuel 
economy, as a part of the fuel blend. 
3.2.1.5 
DEVELOPING A CONSISTENT TIME SERIES 
When data collection and accounting procedures, emission estimation methodologies, or models are revised, it is 
good practice to recalculate the complete time series. A consistent time series with regard to initial collection of 
fleet technology data may require extrapolation, possibly supported by the use of proxy data. This is likely to be 
needed for early years. Inventory compilers should refer to the discussion in Volume 1 Chapter 5: Time Series 
Consistency for general guidance. 
Since this chapter contains many updated emission factors, for CO2 (accounting for 100 percent fuel oxidation), 
CH4, and N2O, inventory compilers should ensure time series consistency. A consistent time series should 
consider the technological change in vehicles and their catalysts control systems. The time series should take into 
account the gradual phase-in among fleets, which is driven by legislation and market forces. Consistency can be 
maintained with accurate data on fleet distribution according to engine and control system technology, 
maintenance, control technology obsolescence, and fuel type. If VKT are not available for the whole time series 
but for a recent year, guidelines in Volume 1 Chapter 5: Time Series Consistency should be used to select a 
splicing method. 
3.2.2 
Uncertainty Assessment  
CO2, N2O, and CH4 contribute typically around 97, 2-3 and 1 percent of CO2-equivalent emissions from the road 
transportation sector, respectively. Therefore, although uncertainties in N2O and CH4 estimates are much higher, 
CO2 dominates the emissions from road transport. Use of locally estimated data will reduce uncertainties, 
particularly with bottom-up estimates. 
Emission factor uncertainty 
For CO2, the uncertainty in the emission factor is typically less than 2 percent when national values are used (see 
Table 1.4 of the Introduction Chapter of this Volume). Default CO2 emission factors given in Table 3.2.1. Road 
Transport Default Carbon Dioxide Emission Factors have an uncertainty of 2-5 percent), due to uncertainty in 
the fuel composition. Use of fuel blends, e.g. involving biofuels, or adulterated fuels may increase the 
uncertainty in emission factors if the composition of the blend is uncertain.  
The uncertainties in emission factors for CH4 and N2O are typically relatively high (especially for N2O) and are 
likely to be a factor of 2-3. They depend on: 
• 
Uncertainties in fuel composition (including the possibility of fuel adulteration) and sulphur content; 
Volume 2: Energy   
    
3.30 
 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
• 
Uncertainties in fleet age distribution and other characterisation of the vehicle stock, including cross-border 
effects - the technical characteristics of vehicles from another country that take on fuel may be covered by 
technology models;  
• 
Uncertainties in maintenance patterns of the vehicle stock; 
• 
Uncertainties in combustion conditions (climate, altitude) and driving practices, such as speed, proportion of 
running distance to cold starts, or load factors (CH4 and N2O); 
• 
Uncertainties in application rates of post-combustion emission control technologies (e.g. three-way    
catalyst); 
• 
Uncertainties in the use of additives to minimize the aging effect of catalysts; 
• 
Uncertainties in operating temperatures (N2O); and 
• 
Uncertainties of test equipment and emission measurement equipment. 
It is good practice to estimate uncertainty based on published studies from which the emission factors were 
obtained. At least the following types of uncertainties may be discussed in published sources and need to be 
considered in the development of national emission factors from empirical data: 
• 
A range in the emission factor of an individual vehicle, represented as a variance of measurements, due to 
variable emissions in different operating conditions (e.g. speed, temperature); and 
• 
Uncertainty in the mean of emission factors of vehicles within the same vehicle class. 
In addition, the vehicle sample that was measured may have been quite limited, or even a more robust sample of 
measurements may not be representative of the national fleet. Test driving cycles cannot fully reflect real driving 
behaviour, so at least some emission factor studies now test cold start emissions separately from running 
emissions, so that countries may be able to create country-specific adjustments, though those adjustments will 
themselves require more data collection with its own uncertainties.  
Another source of uncertainty may be the conversion of the emission factor into units in which the activity data 
are given (e.g. from kg/GJ to g/km) because this requires additional assumptions about other parameters, such as 
fuel economy, which have an associated uncertainty as well.  
The uncertainty in the emission factor can be reduced by stratifying vehicle fleets further by technology, age and 
driving conditions.  
Activity data uncertainty 
Activity data are the primary source of uncertainty in the emission estimate. Activity data are either given in 
energy units (e.g. TJ) or other units for different purposes such as person-/ton-kilometres, vehicle stocks, trip 
length distributions, fuel efficiencies, etc. Possible sources of uncertainty, which will typically be about +/-5 
percent, include: 
• 
Uncertainties in national energy surveys and data returns;  
• 
Unrecorded cross-border transfers; 
• 
Misclassification of fuels; 
• 
Misclassification in vehicle stock; 
• 
Lack of completeness (fuel not recorded in other source categories may be used for transportation purposes); 
and 
• 
Uncertainty in the conversion factor from one set of activity data to another (e.g. from fuel consumption 
data to person-/ton-kilometres, or vice versa, see above). 
Stratification of activity data may reduce uncertainty, if they can be connected to results from a top-down fuel 
use approach.  
For estimating CH4 and N2O emissions, a different tier and hence different sets of activity data may be used. It is 
good practice to ensure that top-down and bottom-up approaches match, and to document and explain deviations 
if they do not match (see also Section 3.2.1.4 Completeness). For these gases, the emission factor uncertainty 
will dominate and the activity data uncertainty may be taken to be the same as for CO2. 
Further guidance on uncertainty estimates for activity data can be found in Volume 1 Chapter 3: Uncertainties. 
Chapter 3: Mobile Combustion  
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.31 
3.2.3 
Inventory Quality Assurance/Quality Control 
(QA/QC) 
It is good practice to conduct quality control checks as outlined in Volume 1 Chapter 6: Quality 
Assurance/Quality Control and Verification and expert review of the emission estimates. Additional quality 
control checks as outlined in Tier 2 procedures in the same chapter and quality assurance procedures may also be 
applicable, particularly if higher tier methods are used to determine emissions from this source category. 
Inventory compilers are encouraged to use higher tier QA/QC for source categories as identified in Volume 1 
Chapter 4: Methodological Choice and Identification of Key Categories. 
In addition to the guidance in the referenced chapters, specific procedures of relevance to this source category 
are outlined below. 
Comparison of emissions using alternative approaches 
For CO2 emissions, the inventory compiler should compare estimates using both the fuel statistics and vehicle 
kilometre travelled data. Any anomalies between the emission estimates should be investigated and explained. 
The results of such comparisons should be recorded for internal documentation. Revising the following 
assumptions could narrow a detected gap between the approaches: 
 
Off-road/non transportation fuel uses; 
 
Annual average vehicle mileage; 
 
Vehicle fuel efficiency; 
 
Vehicle breakdowns by type, technology, age, etc.; 
 
Use of oxygenates/biofuels/other additives; 
 
Fuel use statistics; and 
 
Fuel sold/used. 
Review of emission factors 
If default emission factors are used, the inventory compiler should ensure that they are applicable and relevant to 
the categories. If possible, the default factors should be compared to local data to provide further indication that 
the factors are applicable.  
For CH4 and N2O emissions, the inventory compiler should ensure that the original data source for the local 
factors is applicable to the category and that accuracy checks on data acquisition and calculations have been 
performed. Where possible, the default factors and the local factors should be compared. If the default factors 
were used to estimate N2O emissions, the inventory compiler should ensure that the revised emission factors in 
Table 3.2.3 were used in the calculation. 
Activity data check 
The inventory compiler should review the source of the activity data to ensure applicability and relevance to the 
category. Section 3.2.1.3 provides good practice for checking activity data. Where possible, the inventory 
compiler should compare the data to historical activity data or model outputs to detect possible anomalies. The 
inventory compiler should ensure the reliability of activity data regarding fuels with minor distribution; fuel used 
for other purposes, on- and off-road traffic, and illegal transport of fuel in or out of the country. The inventory 
compiler should also avoid double counting of agricultural and off-road vehicles. 
External review 
The inventory compiler should perform an independent, objective review of the calculations, assumptions, and 
documentation of the emissions inventory to assess the effectiveness of the QC programme. The peer review 
should be performed by expert(s) who are familiar with the source category and who understand the inventory 
requirements. The development of CH4 and N2O emission factors is particularly important due to the large 
uncertainties in the default factors. 
 
Volume 2: Energy   
    
3.32 
 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.2.4 
Reporting and Documentation 
It is good practice to document and archive all information required to produce the national emissions inventory 
estimates.  
It is not practical to include all documentation in the national inventory report. However, the inventory should 
include summaries of methods used and references to source data such that the reported emissions estimates are 
transparent and steps in their calculation may be retraced. This applies particularly to national models used to 
estimate emissions from road transport, and to work done to improve knowledge of technology-specific emission 
factors for nitrous oxide and methane, where the uncertainties are particularly great. This type of information, 
provided the documentation is clear, should be submitted for inclusion in the EFDB.  
Confidentiality is not likely to be a major issue with regard to road emissions, although it is noted that in some 
countries the military use of fuel may be kept confidential. The composition of some additives is confidential, 
but this is only important if it influences greenhouse gas emissions. 
Where a model such as the USEPA MOVES or MOBILE models or the EEA COPERT model is used (EPA 
2005a, EPA 2005b, EEA 2005, respectively), a complete record of all input data should be kept. Also any 
specific assumptions that were made and modifications to the model should be documented. 
3.2.5 
 Reporting tables and worksheets 
See the four pages of the worksheets (Annex 1) for the Tier I Sectoral Approach which are to be filled in for 
each of the source categories. The reporting tables are available in Volume 1, Chapter 8. 
 
3.3 
OFF-ROAD TRANSPORTATION 
The off-road category (1 A 3 e ii) in Table 3.1.1 includes vehicles and mobile machinery used within the 
agriculture, forestry, industry (including construction and maintenance), residential, and sectors, such as airport 
ground support equipment, agricultural tractors, chain saws, forklifts, snowmobiles. For a brief description of 
common types of off-road vehicles and equipment, and the typical engine type and power output of each, please 
refer to EEA 2005. Sectoral desegregations are also available at USEPA, 2005b12.  
Engine types typically used in these off-road equipment include compression-ignition (diesel) engines, spark-
ignition (motor gasoline), 2-stroke engines, and motor gasoline 4-stroke engines. 
3.3.1 
Methodological issues 
Emissions from off-road vehicles are estimated using the same methodologies used for mobile sources, as 
presented in Section 3.2. These have not changed since the publication of the 1996 IPCC Guidelines and the 
GPG2000, except that, as discussed in Section 3.2.1.2, the emission factors now assume full oxidation of the fuel. 
This is for consistency with the Stationary Combustion Chapter. Also these guidelines contain a method for 
estimating CO2 emissions from catalytic converters using urea, a source of emissions that was not addressed 
previously. 
3.3.1.1 
CHOICE OF METHOD 
There are three methodological options for estimating CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from combustion in off-
road mobile sources: Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3. Figure 3.3.1: Decision tree for estimating emissions from off-
road vehicles provides the criteria for choosing the appropriate method. The preferred method of determining 
CO2 emissions is to use fuel consumption for each fuel type on a country-specific basis. However, there may be 
difficulties with activity data because of the number and diversity of equipment types, locations, and usage

patterns associated with off-road vehicles and machinery. Furthermore, statistical data on fuel consumption by 
off-road vehicles are not often collected and published. In this case higher tier methods will be needed for CO2 
and they are necessary for non-CO2 gases because these are much more dependent on technology and operating 
conditions.  
A single method is provided for estimating CO2 emissions from catalytic converters using urea. Many types of 
off-road vehicles will not have catalytic converters installed, but emission controls will probably increasingly be 
used for some categories of off-road vehicles, especially those operated in urban areas (e.g., airport or harbour 
ground support equipment) in developed countries. If catalytic converters using urea are used in off-road 
vehicles, the associated CO2 emissions should be estimated.  
The general method for estimating greenhouse gas emissions from energy sources can be described as:

For Tier 1, emissions are estimated using fuel-specific default emission factors as listed in Table 3.3.1, assuming 
that for each fuel type, the total fuel is consumed by a single off-road source category.  
For Tier 2, emissions are estimated using country-specific and fuel-specific emission factors which, if available, 
are specific to broad type of vehicle or machinery. There is little or no advantage in going beyond Tier 2 for CO2 
emissions estimates, provided reliable fuel consumption data are available.

For Tier 3, if data are available, the emissions can be estimated from annual hours of use and equipment-specific

these data may not be systematically collected, published, or available in sufficient detail, and may have to be 
estimated using a combination of data and assumptions.

Equation 3.3.3 may be stratified by factors such as age, technological vintage or usage pattern, and this will

to support the stratification, (EEA 2005). Other detailed modelling tools are available for estimating off-road 
emissions using Tier 3 methodology (e.g., NONROAD (USEPA 2005a) and COPERT (Ntziachristos 2000)). 
For estimating CO2 emissions from use of urea-based additives in catalytic converters (non-combustive 
emissions), Equation 3.3.4 is used:

3.3.1.2 
CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTORS  
Default CO2 emission factors assume that 100% of the fuel carbon is oxidised to CO2. This is irrespective of 
whether the carbon is emitted initially as CO2, CO, NMVOC or as particulate matter.  
Country-specific NCV and CEF data should be used for Tiers 2 and 3. Inventory compilers may wish to consult 
CORINAIR 2004 or the EFDB for emission factors, noting that responsibility remains with the inventory 
compilers to ensure that emission factors taken from the EFDB are applicable to national circumstances.  
For a Tier 3 approach example, please see Box 3.3.1 where more information on tailoring the NONROAD 
emissions model using country-specific data as well as the model to enhance national emission factors are given. 
The default emission factors for CO2 and their uncertainty ranges, and the default emission factors for CH4 and 
N2O for Tier 1 are provided in Table 3.3.1.  To estimate CO2 emissions, inventory compilers also have the option 
of using emission factors based on country-specific fuel consumption by off-road vehicles.

Note: CO2 emission factor values represent full carbon content. 
a Data provided in Table 3.3.1 are based on European off-road mobile sources and machinery. For gasoline, in case fuel consumption by 
 sector is not discriminated, default values may be obtained according to national circumstances, e.g. prevalence of a given sector or 
 weighting by activity 
b Including diurnal, soak and running losses. 
c In general, off-road vehicles do not have emission control catalysts installed (there may be exceptions among off-road vehicles in 
 urban areas, such as ground support equipment used in urban airports and harbours). Properly operating catalysts convert nitrogen 
 oxides to N2O and CH4 to CO2. However, exposure of catalysts to high-sulphur or leaded fuels, even once, causes permanent 
 deterioration (Walsh, 2003). This effect, if applicable, should be considered when adjusting emission factors. 
3.3.1.3 
CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA  
Comprehensive top-down activity data on off-road vehicles are often unavailable, and where this is the case 
statistical surveys will be necessary to estimate the share of transport fuel used by off-road vehicles. Survey 
design is discussed in Chapter 2 of Vol.1 (Approaches to Data Collection). The surveys should be at the level of 
disaggregation indicated in Table 3.3.1 to make use of the default emission factor data, and be more detailed for 
the higher tiers. For the Tier 3 approach, modelling tools are available to estimate the amount of fuel consumed 
by each subcategory of equipment. Box 3.3.1 provides further information on using the NONROAD emissions 
model. This model may also be developed to incorporate country-specific modifications (see Box 3.3.2 for the 
Canadian experience).  
  
Chapter 3: Mobile Combustion  
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.37 
BOX 3.3.1 
NONROAD EMISSION MODEL (USEPA) 
NONROAD 2005 is a mathematical model developed by the USEPA and may be used to estimate 
and forecast emissions from the non-road (off-road) transportation sectors. The model itself and all 
available 
supporting 
documentation 
are 
accessible 
on 
the 
EPA’s 
website 
(http://www.epa.gov/otaq/nonrdmdl.htm). This model estimates emissions for six exhaust gases: 
hydrocarbons (HC), NOX, carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), sulphur oxides (SOX), 
and particulate matter (PM). The user selects among five different types for reporting HC — as 
total hydrocarbons (THC), total organic gases (TOG), non-methane organic gases (NMOG), non-
methane hydrocarbons (NMHC), and volatile organic compounds (VOC).  
Generally, this model can perform a bottom-up estimation of emissions from the defined sources 
using equipment specific parameters such as: (i) engine populations; (ii) annual hours of use; (iii) 
power rating (horsepower); (iv) load factor (percent load or duty cycle), and (v) brake-specific fuel 
consumption (fuel consumed per horsepower-hour). The function will calculate the amount of fuel 
consumed by each subcategory of equipment. Subsequently, sub-sector (technology/fuel)-specific 
emission factors may then be applied to develop the emission estimate. The model is sensitive to 
the chosen parameters but may be used to apportion emissions estimates developed using a top-
down approach.  
It is not uncommon for the bottom-up approach using this model to deviate from a similar top-
down result by a factor of 2 (100%) and therefore users are cautioned to review documentation for 
areas where this gap may be reduced through careful adjustment of their own inputs. 
Consequently, users must have some understanding of the population and fuel/technology make-up 
of the region being evaluated. However, reasonable adjustments can be established based upon: 
national manufacturing levels; importation/export records; estimated lifespan and scrappage 
functions. Scrappage functions attempt to define the attrition rate of equipment and may help 
illustrate present populations based upon historic equipment inventories (see Box 3.2.3 of Section 
3.2 of this volume).  
3.3.1.4 
COMPLETENESS 
Duplication of off-road and road transport activity data should be avoided. Validation of fuel consumption 
should follow the principles outlined in Section 3.2.1.3. Lubricants should be accounted for based on their use in 
off-road vehicles. Lubricants that are mixed with motor gasoline and combusted should be included with fuel 
consumption data. Other uses of lubricants are covered in the Volume 3: IPPU Chapter 5). 
Amounts of carbon from biomass, eg. biodiesel, oxygenates and some other blending agents should be estimated 
separately, and reported as an information item to avoid double counting as these emissions are already treated in 
the AFOLU sector. 
3.3.1.5 
DEVELOPING A CONSISTENT TIME SERIES 
It is good practice to determine activity data (e.g., fuel use) using the same method for all years. If this is not 
possible, data collection should overlap sufficiently in order to check for consistency in the methods employed. 
If it is not possible to collect activity data for the base year (e.g. 1990), it may be appropriate to extrapolate data 
backwards using trends in other activity data records. 
Emissions of CH4 and N2O will depend on engine type and technology. Unless technology-specific emission 
factors have been developed, it is good practice to use the same fuel-specific set of emission factors for all years. 
Mitigation activities resulting in changes in overall fuel consumption will be readily reflected in emission 
estimates if actual fuel activity data are collected. Mitigation options that affect emission factors, however, can 
only be captured by using engine-specific emission factors, or by developing control technology assumptions. 
Changes in emission factors over time should be well documented.   
For more information on determining base year emissions and ensuring consistency in the time series, see 
Volume 1, Chapter 5 (Time Series Consistency).

BOX 3.3.2 
CANADIAN EXPERIENCE WITH NONROAD MODEL 
Using the model to enhance national emission factors: 
NONROAD is initially populated with data native to the United States but may be customised for 
a given region or Party by simply adjusting the assumed input parameters to accommodate local 
situations. Parties may wish to designate their region as similar to one of those present in the USA 
to better emulate the seasonal climate. However, a designated temperature regime may also be 
input elsewhere. The NONROAD model is, thus, pre-loaded with local USA defaults thereby 
allowing their constituents to query it immediately.  
Canada has begun to adjust this model by commencing national studies to better evaluate country-
specific engine populations, available technologies, load factors and brake-specific fuel 
consumption values (BSFC) unique to the Canadian region. This new information will facilitate 
creation of Canada-specific input files and therefore not alter the core EPA programme algorithm 
but allow complete exploitation of the programmes strengths by providing more representative 
population and operating definitions. Through the introduction of lower uncertainty input data, the 
model may be used in conjunction with national fuel consumption statistics to arrive at a 
reasonable, disaggregated emission estimate. When operated with a similarly constructed On-Road 
model, for which operating parameters are better understood, a complete bottom-up, “apparent” 
fuel consumption estimate may be scaled to total national fuel sales. The country has used this 
modelling concept to help improve country-specific emission factors for the off-road consumption 
of fuel. The total fuel consumed is estimated by fuel type for each of the highly aggregated 
equipment sectors: (i) 2 cycle versus 4 cycle engines; (ii) Agriculture, Forestry, Industrial, 
Household and Recreational sub-sectors; (iii) gasoline versus diesel (spark vs. compression 
ignition). Once the model reports the total amount of fuels consumed according to this matrix, a 
composite emission factor is built based on the weighted averages of the contributing sub-sectors 
and their unique emission factors. The 2 cycle versus 4 cycle proportions will contribute to an 
average Off-Road gasoline EF while the Diesel EF is directly determined. Emission factors 
representing most GWP gases are not well researched and documented currently in North America 
and therefore, Canada has historically utilized applicable CORINAIR emission factors for these 
aggregated equipment sectors. The similarities between earlier technologies present in Europe and 
North America allow this utilization without introducing unreasonable uncertainty. 
3.3.2 
Uncertainty assessment  
Greenhouse gas emissions from off-road sources are typically much smaller than those from road transportation, 
but activities in this category are diverse and are thus typically associated with higher uncertainties because of 
the additional uncertainty in activity data. 
The types of equipment and their operating conditions are typically more diverse than that for road transportation, 
and this may give rise to a larger variation in emission factors and thus to larger uncertainties. However, the 
uncertainty estimate is likely to be dominated by the activity data, and so it is reasonable to assume as a default 
that the values in section 3.2.1.2 apply. Also, emission controls, if installed, are likely to be inoperable due to 
catalyst failure (e.g., from exposure to high-sulphur fuel).  Thus, N2O and CH4 emissions are more closely 
related to combustion-related factors such as fuel and engine technology than to emission control systems. 
3.3.2.1 
ACTIVITY DATA UNCERTAINTY 
Uncertainty in activity data is determined by the accuracy of the surveys or bottom-up models on which the 
estimates of fuel usage by off-road source and fuel type (see Table 3.3.1 for default classification) are based. 
This will be very case-specific, but factor of 2 uncertainties are certainly possible, unless if there is evidence to 
the contrary from the survey design.  
3.3.3 
Inventory Quality Assurance/Quality Control 
(QA/QC) 
It is good practice to conduct quality control checks as outlined in Chapter 6 of Volume 1, and expert review of 
the emission estimates, plus additional checks if higher tier methods are used.  
Chapter 3: Mobile Combustion  
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.39 
In addition to the guidance above, specific procedures of relevance to this source category are outlined below. 
Review of emission factors 
The inventory compiler should ensure that the original data source for national factors is applicable to each 
category and that accuracy checks on data acquisition and calculations have been performed. For default factors, 
the inventory compiler should ensure that the factors are applicable and relevant to the category. If possible, the 
default factors should be compared to national factors to provide further indication that the factors are applicable 
and reasonable. 
Check of activity data 
The source of the activity data should be reviewed to ensure applicability and relevance to the category. Where 
possible, the data should be compared to historical activity data or model outputs to look for anomalies. Where 
surveys data have been used, the sum of on-road and off-road fuel usage should be consistent with total fuel used 
in the country. In addition, a completeness assessment should be conducted, as described in Section 3.3.1.4. 
External review 
The inventory compiler should carry out an independent, objective review of calculations, assumptions or 
documentation or both of the emissions inventory to assess the effectiveness of the QC programme. The peer 
review should be performed by expert(s) who are familiar with the source category and who understand national 
greenhouse gas inventory requirements. 
3.3.4 
Reporting and Documentation 
It is good practice to document and archive all information required to produce the national emissions inventory 
estimates as outlined in Chapter 8 of Volume 1. 
It is not practical to include all documentation in the national inventory report. However, the inventory should 
include summaries of methods used and references to source data such that the reported emissions estimates are 
transparent and steps in their calculation may be retraced. 
Some examples of specific documentation and reporting issues relevant to this source category are provided 
below. 
In addition to reporting emissions, it is good practice to provide: 
• 
 Source of fuel and other data; 
• 
 Emission factors used and their associated references; 
• 
 Analysis of uncertainty or sensitivity of results or both to changes in input data and assumptions. 
• 
 Basis for survey design, where used to determine activity data 
• 
 References to models used in making the estimates 
3.3.5 
Reporting tables and worksheets 
See the four pages of the worksheets (Annex 1) for the Tier I Sectoral Approach which are to be filled in for 
each of the source categories. The reporting tables are available in Volume 1, Chapter 8. 
 
3.4 
RAILWAYS 
Railway locomotives generally are one of three types: diesel, electric, or steam. Diesel locomotives generally use 
diesel engines in combination with an alternator or generator to produce the electricity required to power their 
traction motors.  
Diesel locomotives are in three broad categories – shunting or yard locomotives, railcars, and line haul 
locomotives. Shunting locomotives are equipped with diesel engines having a power output of about 200 to 2000 
kW. Railcars are mainly used for short distance rail traction, e.g., urban/suburban traffic. They are equipped with 
a diesel engine having a power output of about 150 to 1000 kW. Line haul locomotives are used for long 
distance rail traction – both for freight and passenger. They are equipped with a diesel engine having a power 
output of about 400 to 4000 kW (EEA, 2005).  
Volume 2: Energy   
    
3.40 
 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Electric locomotives are powered by electricity generated at stationary power plants as well as other sources. The 
corresponding emissions are covered under the Stationary Combustion Chapter of this Volume. 
Steam locomotives are now generally used for very localized operations, primarily as tourist attractions and their 
contribution to greenhouse gas emissions is correspondingly small. However for a few countries, up to the 1990s, 
coal was used in a significant fraction of locomotives. For completeness, their emissions should be estimated 
using an approach similar to conventional steam boilers, which are covered in the Stationary Combustion 
Chapter. 
3.4.1 
Methodological issues 
Methodologies for estimating greenhouse gas emissions from railway vehicles (Section 3.4.1.1), have not 
changed fundamentally since the publication of the 1996 IPCC Guidelines and the GPG2000. However, for 
consistency with the Stationary Combustion Chapter, CO2 emissions are now estimated on the basis of the full 
carbon content of the fuel. This chapter covers good practice in the development of estimates for the direct 
greenhouse gases CO2, CH4 and N2O. For the precursor gases, or indirect greenhouse gases of CO, NMVOCs, 
SO2, PM, and NOx, please refer to the EMEP/Corinair Guidebook (EEA, 2005) for other mobile sources). 
3.4.1.1 
CHOICE OF METHOD 
There are three methodological options for estimating CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from railways. The decision 
trees in Figures 3.4.1 and 3.4.2 give the criteria for choosing methodologies.

The three tiers of estimation methodologies are variations of the same fundamental equation:

j

For Tier 1, emissions are estimated using fuel-specific default emission factors as listed in Table 3.4.1, assuming 
that for each fuel type the total fuel is consumed by a single locomotive type. For CO2, Tier 2 uses equation 3.4.1 
again with country-specific data on the carbon content of the fuel. There is little or no advantage in going beyond 
Tier 2 for estimating CO2 emissions.  
Volume 2: Energy   
    
3.42 
 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
With respect to Tier 2 for CH4 and N2O, emissions are estimated using country-specific and fuel-specific 
emission factors in equation 3.4.2. The emission factors, if available, should be specific to broad locomotive 
technology type.

Tier 3 methods , if data are available, use more detailed modelling of the usage of each type of engine and train, 
which will affect emissions through dependence of emission factors on load. Data needed includes the fuel 
consumption which can be further stratified according to typical journey (e.g. freight, intercity, regional) and 
kilometres travelled by type of train. This type of data may be collected for other purposes (e.g. emissions of air 
pollutants depending on speed and geography, or from the management of the railway). 
Equation 3.4.3 is an example of a more detailed methodology (Tier 3), which is mainly based on the USEPA 
method for estimating off-road emissions (USEPA 2005 a & b). This uses the following basic formula to 
calculate emissions (in Gg):

using Tier 3 methodologies (e.g., RAILI (VTT 2003); NONROAD (USEPA 2005a and b); COST 319 
(Jorgensen & Sorenson, 1997)). Please refer to Box 3.4.1 for an example of a Tier 3 approach. 
3.4.1.2 
CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTORS  
The default emission factors for CO2, CH4 and N2O and their uncertainty ranges for Tier 1 are provided in Table 
3.4.1. To estimate CH4 and N2O emissions, inventory compilers are encouraged to use country-specific emission 
factors for locomotives if available.

CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA  
National level fuel consumption data are needed for estimating CO2 emissions for Tier 1 and Tier 2 approaches. 
For estimating CH4 and N2O emissions using Tier 2, locomotive category level data is needed. Tier 3 approaches 
require activity data for operations (for example gross tonne kilometre (GTK) and duty cycles) at specific line 
haul locomotive level. These methods also require other locomotive-specific information, such as source 
population (with age and power ranges), mileage per train tonnage, annual hours of use and age-dependent usage 
patterns, average rated horse power (with individual power distribution within given power ranges), load factor, 
section information (such as terrain topography and train speeds). There are alternate modelling approaches for 
Tier 3 estimation (VTT 2003; EEA 2005). 
The railway or locomotive companies, or the relevant transport authorities may be able to provide fuel 
consumption data for the line haul and yard locomotives. The contribution from yard locomotives is likely to be 
very small for almost all countries. If the annual fuel consumption is not provided separately for yard 
locomotives, it may be possible to estimate fuel use if typical data on their use and daily fuel use is available 
according to the following equation: 
BOX 3.4.1 
EXAMPLE OF TIER 3 APPROACH 
The 1998 EPA non-road diesel engine regulations are structured as a 3-tiered progression 
(USEPA, 1998). Each USEPA-tier involves a phase in (by horse power rating) over several 
years. USEPA-Tier 0 standards were in phase until 2001. The more stringent USEPA-Tier 1 
standards took effect from 2002 to 2004, and yet more stringent USEPA-Tier 2 standards 
phase-in from 2005 and beyond. The main improvements are in the NOx and PM emissions 
over the USEPA-tiers. Use of improved diesel with lower sulphur content contributes to 
reduced SO2 emissions. The table below provides broad technology level emission factors for 
these and other locomotives above 3000 HP. Emission factors may also be provided in 
g/passenger-kilometer for passenger trains and g/ton-kilometer for freight trains for higher tiers 
if country-specific information is available (e.g., Hahn, 1989; UNECE 2002).

EQUATION 3.4.5 
ESTIMATING YARD LOCOMOTIVE FUEL CONSUMPTION  
Inventory fuel consumption = Number of yard locomotives • Average fuel consumption per 
locomotive and day • Average number of days of operation per locomotive in the year 
 
The number of yard locomotives can be obtained from railway companies or transport authorities.  If average 
fuel consumption per day is unknown, a value of 863 litres per day can be used (USEPA, 2005a). The number of 
days of operation is usually 365. If data for the number of yard locomotives cannot be obtained, the emissions 
inventory can be approximated by assuming that all fuel is consumed by line haul locomotives.  
If fuel consumption data are available for the jurisdiction (State or Territory) as a whole, double counting may 
occur when locomotives of one company fill-in the jurisdiction of another company.  This can be resolved at 
higher Tiers by the use of operating data. 
Where higher tier approaches are used, care should be taken that the fuel consumption data used for CO2 is 
consistent with the activity data used for CH4 and N2O. 
3.4.1.4 
COMPLETENESS 
Diesel fuel is the most common fuel type used in railways, but inventory compilers should be careful not to omit 
or double count the other fuels that may be used in diesel locomotives for traction purposes. These may be mixed 
with diesel and may include petroleum fuels (such as residual fuel, fuel oils, or other distillates), bio-diesel (e.g. 
oil esters from rape seed, soy bean, sunflower, Jatropha, or Karanjia oil, or recovered vegetable and animal fats), 
and synthetic fuels.  Bio-diesel can be used in all diesel engines with slight or no modification. Blending with 
conventional diesel is possible. Synthetic fuels include synthetic middle distillates (SMD) and Dimethyl Ether 
(DME) to be produced from various carbonaceous feedstocks, including natural gas, residual fuel oil, heavy 
crude oils, and coal via the production of synthesis gas. The mix varies and presently it is between 2 to 5 percent 
bio-diesel and the remaining petroleum diesel. The emission properties of these fuels are considered to be similar 
to those used for the road transport sector. CO2 emissions from fuels derived from biomass should be reported as 
information items, and not included in the national total to avoid double counting. 
Diesel locomotives may combust natural gas or coal for heating cars.  Although these energy sources may be 
“mobile,” the methods for estimating emissions from combustion of fuels for heat are covered under the 
Stationary Combustion section of this Energy Volume. Inventory compilers should be careful not to omit or 
double count the emissions from energy used for carriage heating in railways.  
Diesel locomotives also consume significant amounts of lubricant oils. The related emissions are dealt with in 
Chapter 5 of the IPPU volume. 
There are potential overlaps with other source sectors. A lot of statistical data will not include fuel used in other 
activities such as stationary railway sources; off-road machinery, vehicles and track machines in railway fuel use. 
Their emissions should not be included here but in the relevant non-railway categories as stationary sources, off-
road etc. If this is not the case and it is impossible to separate these other uses from the locomotives, then it is 
good practice to note this in any inventory report or emission reporting tables. 
3.4.1.5 
DEVELOPING A CONSISTENT TIME SERIES 
Emissions of CH4 and N2O will depend on engine type and technology. Unless technology-specific emission 
factors have been developed, it is good practice to use the same fuel-specific set of emission factors for all years. 
Mitigation options that affect emission factors can only be captured by using engine-specific emission factors, or 
by developing control technology assumptions. These changes should be adequately documented.  
For more information on determining base year emissions and ensuring consistency in the time series, see 
Chapter 5 of Volume 1: Time Series Consistency. 
3.4.1.6 
UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT  
Greenhouse gas emissions from railways are typically much smaller than those from road transportation because 
the amounts of fuel consumed are less, and also because operations often occur on electrified lines, in which case 
the emissions associated with railway energy use will be reported under power generation and will depend on the 
characteristics of that sector. 
Volume 2: Energy   
    
3.46 
 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
To reduce uncertainty, a comprehensive approach is needed for both emission factors and activity data, 
especially where bottom-up activity data are used. The use of representative locally estimated data is likely to 
improve accuracy although uncertainties may remain large. It is good practice to document the uncertainties 
both in the emission factors as well as in the activity data. Further guidance on uncertainty estimates for emission 
factors can be found in Chapter 3 of Volume 1: Uncertainties. 
Emission factor uncertainty 
Table 3.4.1 provides ranges indicating the uncertainties associated with diesel fuel. In the absence of specific 
information, the percentage relationship between the upper and lower limiting values and the central estimate 
may be used to derive default uncertainty ranges associated with emission factors for additives. 
Activity data uncertainty 
The uncertainty in top-down activity data (fuel use) is likely to be of the order 5 percent. The uncertainty in 
disaggregated data for bottom-up estimates (usage or fuel use by type of train) is unlikely to be less than 10 
percent and could be several times higher, depending on the quality of the underlying statistical surveys. Bottom-
up estimates are however necessary for estimating non-CO2 gases at higher tiers. These higher tier calculations 
could also yield CO2 estimates, but these will probably be more uncertain than Tier 1 or 2. Thus the way forward 
where railways are a key category is to use the top-down estimate for CO2 with country-specific fuel carbon 
contents, and higher tier estimates for the other gases. A bottom-up CO2 estimate can then be used for QA/QC 
cross-checks. 
Further guidance on uncertainty estimates for activity data can be found in Chapter 3 of Volume 1: Uncertainties. 
3.4.2 
Inventory Quality Assurance/Quality Control 
(QA/QC) 
It is good practice to conduct quality control checks as outlined in Chapter 6 of Volume 1: Quality Assurance/ 
Quality Control and Verification. 
Additional quality control checks as outlined in Tier 2 procedures in Chapter 6 of Volume 1 may also be 
applicable, particularly if higher tier methods are used to determine emissions from this source category. 
Inventory compilers are encouraged to use higher tier QA/QC for key categories as identified in Chapter 4 of 
Volume 1: Methodological Choice and Identification of Key Categories. In addition to the above guidance, 
specific procedures of relevance to this source category are outlined below. 
Review of emission factors 
The inventory compiler should ensure that the original data source for national factors is applicable to each 
category and that accuracy checks on data acquisition and calculations have been performed. For the IPCC 
default factors, the inventory compiler should ensure that the factors are applicable and relevant to the category. 
If possible, the IPCC default factors should be compared to national factors to provide further indication that the 
factors are applicable and reasonable. 
Check of activity data 
The source of the activity data should be reviewed to ensure applicability and relevance to the category. Where 
possible, the data should be compared to historical activity data or model outputs to look for anomalies. Data 
could be checked with productivity indicators such as fuel per unit of distance railway performance (freight and 
passenger kilometres) compared with other countries and compared across different years. 
3.4.3 
Reporting and Documentation 
It is good practice to document and archive all information required to produce the national emissions inventory 
estimates as outlined in Chapter 8 of Volume 1: Reporting Guidance and Tables. 
In addition to reporting emissions, it is good practice to provide: 
• 
the way in which detailed information needed for bottom-up estimates has been obtained, and what 
uncertainties are to be estimated; 
• 
how any bottom-up method of fuel use has been reconciled with top-down fuel use statistics. 
• 
emission factors used and their associated references, especially for additives 
• 
the way in which any biofuel components have been identified.

WATER-BORNE NAVIGATION 
This source category covers all water-borne transport from recreational craft to large ocean-going cargo ships 
that are driven primarily by large, slow and medium speed diesel engines and occasionally by steam or gas 
turbines. It includes hovercraft and hydrofoils. Water-borne navigation causes emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), 
methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), as well as carbon monoxide (CO), non-methane volatile organic 
compounds (NMVOCs), sulphur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter (PM) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx). 
Section 3.5.5 contains definitions of specialist terms that may be useful to an inventory compiler. 
3.5.1 
Methodological issues 
This section deals with the direct greenhouse gases CO2, CH4, and N2O. The source category is set out in detail 
in Table 3.5.1. The methods discussed can be used also to estimate emissions from military water-borne 
navigation (see section 3.5.1.4). For the purpose of the emissions inventory, a distinction is made between 
domestic and international water-borne navigation. Any fugitive emissions from the transport of fossil fuels (e.g., 
by tanker) should be estimated and reported under the category “Fugitive emissions” as set out in Chapter 4 of 
this Volume. 
3.5.1.1 
CHOICE OF METHOD 
Two methodological tiers for estimating emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from water-borne navigation are 
presented. Both tiers apply emission factors to fuel consumption activity data. The decision tree shown in Figure 
3.5.1 helps in making a choice between the two tiers. Emissions are estimated separately for domestic and 
international water-borne navigation. 
Tier 1 
The Tier 1 method is the simplest and can be applied with either default values or country-specific information. 
The fuel consumption data and emission factors in the Tier 1 method are fuel-type-specific and should be applied 
to the corresponding activity data (e.g. gas/diesel oil used for navigation). The calculation is based on the amount 
of fuel combusted and on emission factors for CO2, CH4, and N2O. The calculation is shown in Equation 3.5.1 
and emission factors are provided in Table 3.5.2 and Table 3.5.3

b = water-borne navigation type (i.e., ship or boat, and possibly engine type.) (Only at Tier 2 is the fuel

Tier 2 
The Tier 2 method also uses fuel consumption by fuel type, but requires country-specific emission factors with 
greater specificity in the classification of modes (e.g. ocean-going ships and boats), fuel type (e.g. fuel oil), and 
even engine type (e.g. diesel) (Equation 3.5.1). In applying Tier 2, the inventory compilers should note that the 
EMEP/Corinair emission inventory guidebook (EEA, 2005) offers a detailed methodology for estimating ship 
emissions based on engine and ship type and ship movement data. The ship movement methodology can be used 
when detailed ship movement data and technical information on the ships are both available and can be used to 
differentiate emissions between domestic and international water-borne navigation.

TIER 2 
Tier 2 emission factors should be country-specific and, if possible, derived by in-country testing of fuels and 
combustion engines used in water-borne navigation. Sources of emission factors should be documented in 
accordance with the provisions of these Guidelines. The EMEP/Corinair Emission inventory guidebook (EEA 
2005) guidebook can be a source for NOx, CO and NMVOC emission factors for both Tier 1 and Tier 2 
calculations.

3.51 
3.5.1.3 
CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
Data on fuel consumption by fuel type and engine type (for N2O and CH4) are required to estimate emissions 
from water-borne navigation. In addition, in the current reporting procedures, emissions from domestic water-
borne navigation are reported separately from international water-borne navigation which requires 
disaggregating the activity data to this level. For consistency, it is good practice to use similar definitions of 
domestic and international activities for aviation and water-borne navigation. These definitions are presented in 
Table 3.5.4 and are independent of the nationality or flag of the carrier. In some cases, the national energy 
statistics may not provide data consistent with this definition. It is good practice that countries separate the 
activity data consistent with this definition. In most countries, tax and custom dues are levied on bunkers for 
domestic consumption, and bunkers for international consumption are free of such dues. In the absence of more 
direct sources of data, information about domestic taxes may be used to distinguish between domestic and 
international fuel consumption. In any case, a country must clearly define the methodologies and assumptions 
used13.

* Most shipping movement data are collected on the basis of individual trip segments (from one departure to 
the next arrival) and do not distinguish between different types of intermediate stop (as called for in GPG 
2000). 
Basing the distinction on individual segment data is therefore simpler and is likely to reduce uncertainties. 
It is very unlikely that this change would make a significant change to the emission estimates.  This does 
not change the way in which emissions from international journeys are reported as an information item 
and not included in national totals. 
 
Fuel use data may be obtained using several approaches. The most feasible approach will depend on the national 
circumstances, but some of the options provide more accurate results than others. Several likely sources of actual 
fuel or proxy data are listed below, in order of typically decreasing reliability: 
• 
National energy statistics from energy or statistical agencies; 
• 
International Energy Agency (IEA) statistical information; 
• 
Surveys of shipping companies (including ferry and freight); 
• 
Surveys of fuel suppliers (e.g. quantity of fuels delivered to port facilities); 
• 
Surveys of individual port and marine authorities; 
• 
Surveys of fishing companies; 
• 
Equipment counts, especially for small gasoline powered fishing and pleasure craft; 
• 
Import/export records; 
• 
Ship movement data and standard passenger and freight ferry schedules; 
• 
Passenger counts and cargo tonnage data;  
• 
International Maritime Organisation (IMO), engine manufacturers, or Jane's Military Ships Database; 
• 
Ship movement data derived from Lloyds Register data 
It may be necessary to combine and compare these data sources to get full coverage of shipping activities. 
Marine diesel engines are the main power unit used within the marine industry for both propulsion and auxiliary 
power generation. Some vessels are powered by steam plants (EEA 2005). Water-borne navigation should also 
account for the fuel that may be used in auxiliary engines powering for example refrigeration plants and cargo 
                                                           
13 It is good practice to clearly state the reasoning and justification if any country opts to use the GPG2000 definitions.  
Volume 2: Energy

pumps, and in boilers aboard vessels. Many steam powered oil tankers are still in operation, which consume 
more fuel per day when discharging their cargo in a port to operate the pumps than they do in deep sea steaming. 
Table 3.5.5 presents the average percentage of fuel consumed by both the main engines and auxiliary engines of 
the total fuel consumed by water-borne navigation vessel types. This allows the inventory compiler to apply the 
appropriate emissions factors, if available, as these factors may differ between main engines and auxiliary 
engines. Table 3.5.6 provides fuel consumption factors for various water-borne navigation vessel types, if the 
ship fleet by tonnage and category is collected.

In addition, although gases from cargo boil-off (primarily LNG or VOC recovery) may be used as fuels on ships, 
the amounts are usually not large in comparison to the total fuel consumed. Due to the small contribution, it is 
not required to account for this in the inventory.  
3.5.1.4 
MILITARY 
The 2006 IPCC Guidelines do not provide a distinct method for calculating military water-borne emissions. 
Emissions from military water-borne fuel use can be estimated using the equation 3.5.1 and the same calculation 
approach is recommended for non-military shipping. Due to the special characteristics of the operations, 
situations, and technologies (e.g., .aircraft carriers, very large auxiliary power plants, and unusual engine types) 
associated with military water-borne navigation, a more detailed method of data analysis is encouraged when 
data are available. Inventory compilers should therefore consult military experts to determine the most 
appropriate emission factors for the country’s military water-borne navigation. 
 Due to confidentiality issues (see completeness and reporting), many inventory compilers may have difficulty 
obtaining data for the quantity of military fuel use. Military activity is defined here as those activities using fuel 
purchased by or supplied to military authorities in the country. It is good practice to apply the rules defining 
civilian domestic and international operations in water-borne navigation to military operations when the data 
necessary to apply those rules are comparable and available.  Data on military fuel use should be obtained from 
government military institutions or fuel suppliers. If data on fuel split are unavailable, all the fuel sold for 
military activities should be treated as domestic. 
Emissions resulting from multilateral operations pursuant to the Charter of the United Nations should not be 
included in national totals, but reported separately; other emissions related to operations shall be included in the 
national emissions totals of one or more Parties involved. The national calculations should take into account fuel 
delivered to the country’s military, as well as fuel delivered within that country but used by the military of other 
countries. Other emissions related to operations (e.g., off-road ground support equipment) should be included in 
the national emissions totals in the appropriate source category. 
3.5.1.5 
COMPLETENESS 
For water-borne navigation emissions, the methods are based on total fuel use. Since countries generally have 
effective accounting systems to measure total fuel consumption. The largest area of possible incomplete 
coverage of this source category is likely to be associated with misallocation of navigation emissions in another 
source category. For instance, for small watercraft powered by gasoline engines, it may be difficult to obtain 
complete fuel use records and some of the emissions may be reported as industrial (when industrial companies 
use small watercraft), other off-road mobile or stationary power production. Estimates of water-borne emissions 
should include not only fuel for marine shipping, but also for passenger vessels, ferries, recreational watercraft, 
other inland watercraft, and other gasoline-fuelled watercraft. Misallocation will not affect completeness of the 
total national CO2 emissions inventory. It will affect completeness of the total non-CO2 emissions inventory, 
because non-CO2 emission factors differ between source categories.  
Fugitive emissions from transport of fossil fuels should be estimated and reported under the category “Fugitive 
emissions”. Most fugitive emissions occur during loading and unloading and are therefore accounted under that 
category. Emissions during travel are considered insignificant.  
Completeness may also be an issue where military data are confidential, unless military fuel use is aggregated 
with another source category.  
There are additional challenges in distinguishing between domestic and international emissions. As each 
country's data sources are unique for this category, it is not possible to formulate a general rule regarding how to 
make an assignment in the absence of clear data. It is good practice to specify clearly the assumptions made so 
that the issue of completeness can be evaluated.  
3.5.1.6 
DEVELOPING A CONSISTENT TIME SERIES 
It is good practice to determine fuel use using the same method for all years. If this is not possible, data 
collection should overlap sufficiently in order to check for consistency in the methods employed. 
Emissions of CH4 and N2O will depend on engine type and technology. Unless technology-specific emission 
factors have been developed, it is good practice to use the same fuel-specific set of emission factors for all years.  
Mitigation activities resulting in changes in overall fuel consumption will be readily reflected in emission 
estimates if actual fuel activity data are collected. Mitigation options that affect emission factors, however, can 
Volume 2: Energy   
    
3.54 
 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
only be captured by using engine-specific emission factors, or by developing control technology assumptions. 
Changes in emission factors over time should be well documented. 
Marine diesel oil and heavy fuel oil are the fuels used primarily for large sources within water-borne navigation. 
As the carbon contents of these fuels may vary over the time series, the source of CO2 emission factors should be 
explicitly stated, as well as the dates the fuels were tested. 
3.5.1.7 
UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT 
Emission factors 
According to expert judgment, CO2 emission factors for fuels are generally well determined as they are primarily 
dependent on the carbon content of the fuel (EPA, 2004). For example, the default uncertainty value for diesel 
fuel is about ± -1.5 percent and for residual fuel oil ± -3 percent. The uncertainty for non-CO2 emissions, 
however, is much greater. The uncertainty of the CH4 emission factor may range as high as 50 percent. The 
uncertainty of the N2O emission factor may range from about 40 percent below to about 140 percent above the 
default value (Watterson, 2004). 
Activity data 
Much of the uncertainty in water-borne navigation emission estimates is related to the difficulty of distinguishing 
between domestic and international fuel consumption. With complete survey data, the uncertainty may be low 
(say ± -5 percent), while for estimations or incomplete surveys the uncertainties may be considerable (say ± -50 
percent). The uncertainty will vary widely from country to country and is difficult to generalise. Global data sets 
may be helpful in this area, and it is expected that reporting will improve for this category in the future. 
3.5.2 
Inventory Quality Assurance/Quality Control 
(QA/QC) 
It is good practice to conduct quality control checks. Specific procedures of relevance to this source category are 
outlined below.  
Comparison of emissions using alternative approaches 
If possible, the inventory compiler should compare estimates determined for water-borne navigation using both 
Tier 1 and Tier 2 approaches. The inventory compiler should investigate and explain any anomaly between the 
emission estimates. The results of such comparisons should be recorded.  
Review of emission factors 
The inventory compiler should ensure that the original data source for national factors is applicable to each 
category and that accuracy checks on data acquisition and calculations have been performed. If national emission 
factors are available, they should be used, provided that they are well documented. For the default factors, the 
inventory compiler should ensure that the factors are applicable and relevant to the category.  
If emissions from military use were developed using data other than default factors, the inventory compiler 
should check the accuracy of the calculations and the applicability and relevance of the data. 
Check of activity data 
The source of the activity data should be reviewed to ensure applicability and relevance to the category. Where 
possible, the data should be compared to historical activity data or model outputs to look for anomalies. Data 
could be checked with productivity indicators such as fuel per unit of water-borne navigation traffic performance 
compared with other countries. The European Environmental Agency provides a useful dataset, http://air-
climate.eionet.eu.int/databases/TRENDS/TRENDS_EU15_data_Sep03.xls, which presents emissions and 
passenger/freight volume for each transportation mode for Europe. The information for shipping is very detailed. 
Examples of such indicators include: for ships with less than 3000 GT are from 0.09 to 0.16 kg CO2/tonne-km; 
for larger ships between 0.04 and 0.14; and for passenger ferries, the factors range from 0.1-0.5 kg/passenger-km. 
External review 
The inventory compiler should perform an independent, objective review of calculations, assumptions or 
documentation of the emissions inventory to assess the effectiveness of the QC programme. The peer review 
should be performed by expert(s) (e.g. transport authorities, shipping companies, and military staff) who are 
familiar with the source category and who understand inventory requirements.

3.5.3 
Reporting and Documentation 
Emissions related to water-borne navigation are reported in different categories depending on their nature. For 
good practice, the categories to use are: 
• 
Domestic water-borne navigation; 
• 
International water-borne navigation (international bunkers); 
• 
Fishing (mobile combustion); 
• 
Mobile (Military [water-borne navigation]) 
• 
Non-specified Mobile (Vehicles and Other Machinery) 
Emissions from international water-borne navigation are reported separately from domestic, and not included in 
the national total. 
Emissions related to commercial fishing are not reported under water-borne navigation. These emissions are to 
be reported under the Agriculture/Forestry/Fishing category in the Energy Sector. By definition, all fuel supplied 
to commercial fishing activities in the reporting country is considered domestic, and there is no international 
bunker fuel category for commercial fishing, regardless of where the fishing occurs.  
Military water-borne emissions should be clearly specified to improve the transparency of national greenhouse 
gas inventories. (see section 3.5.1.4). 
In addition to reporting emissions, it is good practice to provide: 
• 
Source of fuel and other data; 
• 
Method used to separate domestic and international navigation; 
• 
Emission factors used and their associated references;  
• 
Analysis of uncertainty or sensitivity of results or both to changes in input data and assumptions.

Reporting tables and worksheets 
The four pages of the worksheets (Annex 1) for the Tier I Sectoral Approach should be filled in for each of the

bulk carriers, but the deck is flush and covered by oil pipelines and vents.  
 
 
3.6 
CIVIL AVIATION  
Emissions from aviation come from the combustion of jet fuel (jet kerosene and jet gasoline) and aviation 
gasoline14. Aircraft engine emissions are roughly composed of about 70 percent CO2, a little less than 30 percent 
H2O, and less than 1 percent each of NOx, CO, SOx, NMVOC, particulates, and other trace components 
including hazardous air pollutants. Little or no N2O emissions occur from modern gas turbines (IPCC, 1999). 
Methane (CH4) may be emitted by gas turbines during idle and by older technology engines, but recent data 
suggest that little or no CH4 is emitted by modern engines.  
Emissions depend on the number and type of aircraft operations; the types and efficiency of the aircraft engines; 
the fuel used; the length of flight; the power setting; the time spent at each stage of flight; and, to a lesser degree, 
the altitude at which exhaust gases are emitted. 
For the purpose of these guidelines, operations of aircraft are divided into (1) Landing/Take-Off (LTO) cycle and 
(2) Cruise. Generally, about 10 percent of aircraft emissions of all types, except hydrocarbons and CO, are 
produced during airport ground level operations and during the LTO cycle15. The bulk of aircraft emissions (90 
percent) occur at higher altitudes. For hydrocarbons and CO, the split is closer to 30 percent local emissions and 
70 percent at higher altitudes, (FAA, 2004a). 
Section 3.6.5 contains definitions of specialist terms that may be useful to an inventory compiler. 
                                                           
14 A fuel used only in small piston engine aircraft, and which generally represents less than 1 percent of fuel used in aviation. 
15 LTO cycle is defined in ICAO, 1993. If countries have more specific data on times in mode these can be used to refine 
computations in higher tier methods.

3.6.1 
Methodological issues 
This source category includes emissions from all civil commercial use of airplanes, including civil and general 
aviation (e.g. agricultural airplanes, private jets or helicopters). Methods discussed in this section can also be 
used to estimate emissions from military aviation, but emissions should be reported under category 
1A 5 ’Other‘ or the Memo Item “Multilateral Operations.” 
For the purpose of the emissions inventory, a distinction is made between domestic and international aviation, 
and it is good practice to report under the source categories listed in Table 3.6.1.  
All emissions from fuels used for international aviation (bunkers) and multilateral operations pursuant to the 
Charter of UN are to be excluded from national totals, and reported separately as memo items.  
3.6.1.1 
CHOICE OF METHOD 
Three methodological tiers for estimating emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O from aviation are presented. Tier 1 
and Tier 2 methods use fuel consumption data. Tier 1 is purely fuel based, while Tier 2 method is based on the 
number of landing/take-off cycles (LTOs) and fuel use. Tier 3 uses movement16 data for individual flights.  
All tiers distinguish between domestic and international flights. However, energy statistics used in Tier 1 often 
do not accurately distinguish between domestic and international fuel use or between individual source 
categories, as defined in Table 3.6.1. Tiers 2 and 3 provide more accurate methodologies to make these 
distinctions.  
The choice of methodology depends on the type of fuel, the data available, and the relative importance of aircraft 
emissions. For aviation gasoline, though country-specific emission factors may be available, the numbers of 
LTOs are generally not available. Therefore, Tier 1 and its default emission factors would probably be used for 
aviation gasoline. All tiers can be used for operations using jet fuel, as relevant emission factors are available for 
jet fuel. Table 3.6.2 summarizes the data requirements for the different tiers: 
The decision tree shown in Figure 3.6.1 should help to select the appropriate method. The resource demand for 
the various tiers depends in part on the number of air traffic movements. Tier 1 should not be resource intensive. 
Tier 2, based on individual aircraft, and Tier 3A, based on Origin and Destination (OD) pairs, would use 
incrementally more resources. Tier 3B, which requires sophisticated modelling, requires the most resources.  
Given the current limited knowledge of CH4 and N2O emission factors, more detailed methods will not 
significantly reduce uncertainties for CH4 and N2O emissions. However, if aviation is a key category, then it is 
recommended that Tier 2 or Tier 3 approaches are used, because higher tiers give better differentiation between 
domestic and international aviation, and will facilitate estimating the effects of changes in technologies (and 
therefore emission factors) in the future.  
The estimates for the cruise phase become more accurate when using Tier 3A methodology or Tier 3B models. 
Moreover because Tier 3 methods use flight movement data instead of fuel use, they provide a more accurate 
separation between domestic and international flights. Data may be available from the operators of Tier 3 models 
(such as SAGE, (Kim, 2005a and b; Malwitz, 2005) and AERO2K (Eyers, 2004). Other methods for 
differentiating national and international fuel use such as considering LTOs, passenger-kilometer data, a 
percentage split based on flight timetables (e.g., OAG data, ICAO statistics for tonne-kilometres performed by 
countries) are shortcuts. The methods may be used if no other methods or data are available. 
 
 
                                                           
16 Movement data refers to, at a minimum, information on the origin and destination, aircraft type, and date of individual 
flights.

Emissions from international and domestic civil aviation, including take-offs and 
landings. Comprises civil commercial use of airplanes, including: scheduled and 
charter traffic for passengers and freight, air taxiing, and general aviation. The 
international/domestic split should be determined on the basis of departure and 
landing locations for each flight stage and not by the nationality of the airline. 
Exclude use of fuel at airports for ground transport which is reported under 1 A 3 e 
Other Transportation. Also exclude fuel for stationary combustion at airports; 
report this information under the appropriate stationary combustion category. 
1 A 3 a i International 
aviation (International 
Bunkers) 
Emissions from flights that depart in one country and arrive in a different country. 
Include take-offs and landings for these flight stages. Emissions from international 
military aviation can be included as a separate sub-category of international 
aviation provided that the same definitional distinction is applied and data are 
available to support the definition. 
1 A 3 a ii Domestic 
Aviation 
Emissions from civil domestic passenger and freight traffic that departs and arrives 
in the same country (commercial, private, agriculture, etc.), including take-offs and 
landings for these flight stages. Note that this may include journeys of considerable 
length between two airports in a country (e.g. San Francisco to Honolulu).  
Exclude military, which should be reported under 1 A 5 b. 
1 A 5 b Mobile

All remaining aviation mobile emissions from fuel combustion that are not 
specified elsewhere. Include emissions from fuel delivered to the country’s 
military not otherwise included separately in 1 A3 a i as well as fuel delivered 
within that country but used by the militaries of other countries that are not 
engaged in multilateral operations. 
1.A.5 c Multilateral

Other reasons for choosing to use a higher tier include estimation of emissions jointly with other pollutants (e.g. 
NOx) and harmonisation of methods with other inventories. In Tier 2 (and higher) the emissions for the LTO and 
cruise phases are estimated separately, in order to harmonise with methods that were developed for air pollution 
programmes that cover only emissions below 914 meters (3000 feet). There may be significant discrepancies 
between the results of a bottom-up approach and a top-down fuel-based approach for aircraft. An example is 
presented in Daggett et al. (1999). 
TIER 1 METHOD 
The Tier 1 method is based on an aggregate quantity of fuel consumption data for aviation (LTO and cruise) 
multiplied by average emission factors. The methane emission factors have been averaged over all flying phases 
based on the assumption that 10 percent of the fuel is used in the LTO phase of the flight. Emissions are 
calculated according to Equation 3.6.1:  
Chapter 3: Mobile Combustion  
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.59 
EQUATION 3.6.1 
(AVIATION EQUATION 1)  
Emissions = Fuel Consumption • Emission Factor 
Tier 1 method should be used to estimate emissions from aircraft that use aviation gasoline which is only used in 
small aircraft and generally represents less than 1 percent of fuel consumption from aviation. Tier 1 method is 
also used for jet-fuelled aviation activities when aircraft operational use data are not available. 
Domestic and international emissions are to be estimated separately using the above equation, using one of the 
methods discussed in section 3.6.1.3 to allocate fuel between the two. 
TIER 2 METHOD  
Tier 2 method is only applicable for jet fuel use in jet aircraft engines. Operations of aircraft are divided into 
LTO and cruise phases. To use Tier 2 method, the number of LTO operations must be known for both domestic 
and international aviation, preferably by aircraft type. In Tier 2 method a distinction is made between emissions 
below and above 914 m (3000 feet); that is emissions generated during the LTO and cruise phases of flight.  
Tier 2 method breaks the calculation of emissions from aviation into the following steps: 
1. Estimate the domestic and international fuel consumption totals for aviation. 
2. Estimate LTO fuel consumption for domestic and international operations. 
3. Estimate the cruise fuel consumption for domestic and international aviation. 
4. Estimate emissions from LTO and cruise phases for domestic and international aviation. 
Tier 2 approach uses Equations 3.6.2 to 3.6.5 to estimate emissions:  
EQUATION 3.6.2 
(AVIATION EQUATION 2)  
Total Emissions = LTO Emissions + Cruise Emissions 
 
Where: 
EQUATION 3.6.3 
(AVIATION EQUATION 3)  
LTO Emissions = Number of LTOs • Emission Factor LTO 
 
EQUATION 3.6.4 
(AVIATION EQUATION 4)

The basis of the recommended Tier 2 methodology is presented schematically in Figure 3.6.2. 
In Tier 2 method, the fuel used in the cruise phase is estimated as a residual: total fuel use minus fuel used in the 
LTO phase of the flight (Equation 3.6.5). Fuel use is estimated for domestic and international aviation separately. 
The estimated fuel use for cruise is multiplied by aggregate emission factors (average or per aircraft type) in 
order to estimate the CO2 and NOx cruise emissions.17 Emissions and fuel used in the LTO phase are estimated 
from statistics on the number of LTOs (aggregate or per aircraft type) and default emission factors or fuel use 
factors per LTO cycle (average or per aircraft type).  
                                                           
17 Current scientific understanding does not allow other gases (e.g., N2O and CH4) to be included in calculation of cruise 
emissions. (IPCC,1999). 
 
 
 
Chapter 3: Mobile Combustion  
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.61 
Tier 2 method considers activity data at the level of individual aircraft types and therefore needs data on the 
number of domestic LTOs by aircraft type and international LTOs by aircraft type. The estimate should include 
all aircraft types frequently used for domestic and international aviation. Table 3.6.3 provides a way of mapping 
actual aircraft to representative aircraft types in the database. Cruise emission factors for emissions other than 
NOx are not provided in Tier 2 method; either national emission factors or the tier default emission factors must 
be used to estimate these cruise emissions.  
TIER 3 METHODS 
Tier 3 methods are based on actual flight movement data, either: for Tier 3A origin and destination (OD) data or 
for Tier 3B full flight trajectory information. National Tier 3 approaches can be used if they are well documented 
and have been reviewed following the guidance provided in Volume 1, Chapter 6 (QA/QC). To facilitate data 
review, countries that use Tier 3 methodology could separately report emissions for Commercial Scheduled 
Aviation and Other Jet Fuelled Activities. 
Tier 3A takes into account cruise emissions for different flight distances. Details on the origin (departure) and 
destination (arrival) airports and aircraft type are needed to use Tier 3A, for both domestic and international 
flights. In Tier 3A, inventories are modelled using average fuel consumption and emissions data for the LTO 
phase and various cruise phase lengths, for an array of representative aircraft categories.  
The data used in Tier 3A methodology takes into account that the amount of emissions generated varies between 
phases of flight. The methodology also takes into account that fuel burn is related to flight distance, while 
recognizing that fuel burn can be comparably higher on relatively short distances than on longer routes. This is 
because aircraft use a higher amount of fuel per distance for the LTO cycle compared to the cruise phase. 
The EMEP/CORINAIR Emission inventory guidebook (EEA 2002) provides an example of Tier 3A method for 
calculating emissions from aircraft. The EMEP/CORINAIR Emission inventory guidebook is continually being 
refined and is published electronically via the European Environment Agency Internet web site. 
EMEP/CORINAIR provides tables with emissions per flight distance.  
(Note that there are three EMEP/CORINAIR methods for calculating aircraft emissions; but, only the Detailed 
CORINAIR Methodology equates to Tier 3A.)  
Tier 3B methodology is distinguished from Tier 3A by the calculation of fuel burnt and emissions throughout the 
full trajectory of each flight segment using aircraft and engine-specific aerodynamic performance information. 
To use Tier 3B, sophisticated computer models are required to address all the equipment, performance and 
trajectory variables and calculations for all flights in a given year. Models used for Tier 3B level can generally 
specify output in terms of aircraft, engine, airport, region, and global totals, as well as by latitude, longitude, 
altitude and time, for fuel burn and emissions of CO, hydrocarbons (HC), CO2, H2O, NOx, and SOx. To be used 
in preparing annual inventory submissions, Tier 3B model must calculate aircraft emissions from input data that 
take into account air-traffic changes, aircraft equipment changes, or any input-variable scenario. The components 
of Tier 3B models ideally are incorporated so that they can be readily updated, so that the models are dynamic 
and can remain current with evolving data and methodologies. Examples of models include the System for 
assessing Aviation’s Global Emissions (SAGE), by the United States Federal Aviation Administration (Kim, 
2005 a and b; Malwitz, 2005), and AERO2k, (Eyers, 2004), by the European Commission.

3.6.1.2 
CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTORS 
TIER 1 
Carbon dioxide emission factors are based on the fuel type and carbon content. National emission factors for 
CO2 should not deviate much from the default values because the quality of jet fuel is well defined. It is good 
practice to use the default CO2 emission factors in Table 3.6.4 for Tier 1 (see Chapter 1, Introduction, of this 
Volume and Table 1.4). National carbon content could be used if available. CO2 should be estimated on the basis 
of the full carbon content of the fuel.

Default values for CH4 and N2O from aircraft are given in Table 3.6.5. Different types of aircraft/engine 
combinations have specific emission factors and these factors may also vary according to distance flown. Tier 1 
assumes that all aircraft have the same emission factors for CH4 and N2O based on the rate of fuel consumption. 
This assumption has been made because more disaggregated emission factors are not available at this level of 
aggregation.

a In the cruise mode CH4 emissions are assumed to be negligible (Wiesen et al., 1994).  For LTO cycles only 
 (i.e., below an altitude of 914 metres (3000 ft.)) the emission factor is 5 kg/TJ (10% of total VOC factor) 
 (Olivier, 1991). Since globally about 10% of the total fuel is consumed in LTO cycles (Olivier, 1995), the 
 resulting fleet averaged factor is 0.5 kg/TJ. 
b  IPCC, 1999. 
c Expert Judgement. 
 Emission factors for other gases (CO and NMVOC) and sulphur content which were included in the 1996  
 IPCC Guidelines can be found in the EFDB. 
TIER 2 
For Tier 2 method, it is good practice to use emission factors from Table 3.6.9 (or updates reflected in the EFDB) 
for the LTO emissions. For cruise calculations only NOx emissions can be computed directly based on specific 
emission factors (Table 3.6.10) and N2O can be computed indirectly from NOx emissions18. CO2 cruise 
emissions are calculated using Tier 1 CO2 emission factors (Table 3.6.4). The CH4 emissions are negligible and 
are assumed to be zero unless new information becomes available. Note that there is limited information on the 
emission factors for CH4 and N2O from aircraft, and the default values provided in Table 3.6.5 are similar to 
values found in the literature. 
TIER 3 
Tier 3A emission factors may be found in the EMEP/CORINAIR emission inventory guidebook, while Tier 3B 
uses emissions factors contained within the models necessary to employ this methodology. Inventory compilers 
should check that these emission factors are in fact appropriate.

3.6.1.3 
CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
Since emissions from domestic aviation are reported separately from international aviation, it is necessary to 
disaggregate activity data between domestic and international components. For this purpose, the following 
definitions should be applied irrespective of the nationality of the carrier (Table 3.6.6). For consistency, it is 
good practice to use similar definitions of domestic and international activities for aviation and water-borne 
navigation. In some cases, the national energy statistics may not provide data consistent with this definition. It is 
good practice that countries separate the activity data consistent with this definition. In any case, a country must 
clearly define the methodologies and assumptions used.

Based on past experience compiling aviation emissions inventories, difficulties have been identified regarding 
the international/domestic split, in particular obtaining the information on passenger and freight drop-off and 
pick up at stops in the same country that was required by the 1996 IPCC Guidelines/GPG2000 (Summary report 
of ICAO/UNFCCC Expert Meeting April 2004). Most flight data are collected on the basis of individual flight 
segments (from one take-off to the next landing) and do not distinguish between different types of intermediate 
stops (as called for in GPG2000). Basing the distinction on flight segment data (origin/destination) is therefore 
simpler and is likely to reduce uncertainties. It is very unlikely that this change would make a significant change 
to the emission estimates.19 This does not change the way in which emissions from international flights are 
reported as a memo item and not included in national totals. 
Improvements in technology and optimization of airline operating practices have significantly reduced the need 
for intermediate technical stops. An intermediate technical stop would also not change the definition of a flight 
as being domestic or international. For example if explicit data is available, countries may define as international 
flight segments that depart one country with a destination in another country and make an intermediate technical 
stop. A technical stop is solely for the purpose of refuelling or solving a technical difficulty and not for the 
purpose of passenger or cargo exchange.  
If national energy statistics do not already provide data consistent with this definition, countries should then 
estimate the split between domestic and international fuel consumption according to the definition, using the 
approaches set out below. 
Top-down data can be obtained from taxation authorities in cases where fuel sold for domestic use is subject to 
taxation, but that for international use is not taxed. Airports or fuel suppliers may have data on delivery of 
aviation kerosene and aviation gasoline to domestic and to international flights. In most countries tax and custom 
dues are levied on fuels for domestic consumption, and fuels for international consumption (bunkers) are free of 
such dues. In the absence of more direct sources of data, information about domestic taxes may be used to 
distinguish between domestic and international fuel consumption. 
Bottom-up data can be obtained from surveys of airline companies for fuel used on domestic and international 
flights, or estimates from aircraft movement data and standard tables of fuel consumed or both. Fuel 
consumption factors for aircraft (fuel used per LTO and per nautical mile cruised) can be used for estimates and 
may be obtained from the airline companies.  
Examples of sources for bottom-up data, including aircraft movement, are: 
• 
Statistical offices or transport ministries as a part of national statistics; 
• 
Airport records; 
• 
ATC (Air Traffic Control) records, for example EUROCONTROL statistics; 
                                                           
19  It is good practice to clearly state the reasoning and justification if any country opts to use the GPG2000 definitions.   
 
Volume 2: Energy

• 
Air carrier schedules published monthly by OAG which contains worldwide timetable passenger and freight 
aircraft movements as well as regular scheduled departures of charter operators. It does not contain ad-hoc 
charter aircraft movements;  
Some of these sources do not cover all flights (e.g. charter flights may be excluded). On the other hand, airline 
timetable data may include duplicate flights due to codeshares between airlines or duplicate flight numbers. 
Methods have been developed to detect and remove these duplicates. (Baughcum et al., 1996; Sutkus et al., 
2001).  
The aircraft types listed in Table 3.6.9, LTO Emission Factors were defined based on the assumptions listed 
below. Aircraft were divided into four major groups to reflect and note the distinct data source for each group: 
Large Commercial Aircraft: This includes aircraft that reflect the 2004 operating fleet and some aircraft types 
for back compatibility, identified by minor model. It was felt that this method would most accurately reflect 
operational fleet emissions. To minimize table size, some aircraft minor models were grouped when LTO 
emissions factors were similar. The Large Commercial Aircraft group LTO emissions factors data source is the 
ICAO Engine Exhaust Emissions Data Bank (ICAO, 2004a). 
Regional Jets: This group includes aircraft that are representative of the 2004 operating Regional Jet (RJ) fleet. 
Representative RJ aircraft were selected based on providing an appropriate range of RJ aircraft with LTO 
emissions factors available. The RJ group LTO emissions factors data source is the ICAO Engine Exhaust 
Emissions Data Bank (ICAO, 2004a). 
Low Thrust Jets: In some countries, aircraft in the low thrust category (engines with thrust below 26.7 kN) 
make up a non-trivial number of movements and therefore should be included in inventories. However, aircraft 
engines in this group are not required to satisfy ICAO engine emissions standards, thus LTO emissions factors 
data are not included in the ICAO Engine Exhaust Emissions Data Bank and difficult to provide. Therefore, 
there is one representative aircraft with typical emissions for aircraft in this group. The Low Thrust Jets group 
LTO emissions factors data source is the FAA’s Emissions and Dispersion Modelling System (EDMS) (FAA 
2004b). 
Turboprops: This group includes aircraft that are representative of the 2004 Turboprop fleet, which can be 
represented by three typical aircraft size based on engine shaft horsepower. The Turboprop group LTO 
emissions factors data source is the Swedish Aeronautical Institute (FOI) LTO Emissions Database. 
Similar data could be obtained from other sources (e.g. EEA, 2002). The equivalent data for turboprop and 
piston engine aircraft need to be obtained from other sources. The relationship between actual aircraft and 
representative aircraft are provided in the Table 3.6.3.  
Aircraft Fleet data may be obtained from various sources. ICAO collects fleet data through two of its statistics 
sub-programmes: the fleet of commercial air carriers, reported by States for their commercial air carriers, and 
civil aircraft on register, reported by States for the civil aircraft on their register at 31 December (ICAO 2004b). 
Some ICAO States do not participate in this data collection, in part because of the difficulty to split the fleet into 
commercial and non-commercial entities. Because of this, ICAO also makes use of other external sources. One 
of these sources is the International Register of Civil Aircraft, 2004, published by the Bureau Veritas (France), 
the CAA (UK) and ENAC (Italy) in cooperation with ICAO. This database contains the information from the 
civil aircraft registers of some 45 States (including the United States) covering over 450 000 aircraft.  
In addition to the above, there are commercial databases of which ICAO also makes use. None of them cover the 
whole fleet as they have limitations in scope and aircraft size. Among these one can find the BACK Aviation 
Solutions Fleet Data (fixed wing aircraft over 30 seats), AirClaims CASE database (fixed wing jet and turboprop 
commercial aircraft), BUCHAir, publishers of the JP Airline Fleet (covers both fixed and rotary wing aircraft). 
Other companies such as AvSoft may also have relevant information. Further information may be obtained from 
these companies’ websites. 
3.6.1.4 
MILITARY AVIATION 
Military activity is defined here as those activities using fuel purchased by or supplied to the military 
authorities of the country. Emissions from aviation fuel use can be estimated using equation 3.6.1 and the same 
calculations approach recommended for civilian aviation. Some types of military transport aircraft and 
helicopters have fuel and emissions characteristics similar to civil types. Therefore default emission factors for 
civil aircraft should be used for military aviation unless better data are available. Alternatively, fuel use may be 
estimated from the hours in operation. Default fuel consumption factors for military aircraft are given in Tables 
3.6.7 and 3.6.8. For fuel use factors see Section 3.6.1.3 ‘Choice of activity data’.

Military aircraft (transport planes, helicopters and fighters) may not have a civilian analogue, so a more detailed 
method of data analysis is encouraged where data are available. Inventory compilers should consult military 
experts to determine the most appropriate emission factors for the country’s military aviation. 
Due to confidentiality issues (see completeness and reporting), many inventory compilers may have difficulty 
obtaining data for the quantity of fuel used by the military. Military activity is defined here as those activities 
using fuel purchased by or supplied to the military authorities in the country. Countries can apply the rules 
defining civilian, national and international aviation operations to military operations when the data necessary to 
apply those rules are comparable and available. In this case, the international military emissions may be reported 
under International Aviation (International Bunkers), but must then be shown separately. Data on military fuel 
Volume 2: Energy   
    
3.68 
 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
use should be obtained from government military institutions or fuel suppliers. If data on fuel split are 
unavailable, all the fuel sold for military activities should be treated as domestic. 
Emissions resulting from multilateral operations pursuant to the Charter of the United Nations should not be 
included in national totals; other emissions related to operations shall be included in the national emissions totals 
of one or more Parties involved. The national calculations should take into account fuel delivered to the 
country’s military, as well as fuel delivered within that country but used by the military of other countries. Other 
emissions related to operations (e.g., off-road ground support equipment) shall be included in the national 
emissions totals in the appropriate source category.  
These data should be used with care as national circumstances may vary from those assumed in this table. In 
particular, distances travelled and fuel consumption may be affected by national route structures, airport 
congestion and air traffic control practices. 
3.6.1.5 
COMPLETENESS 
Regardless of method, it is important to account for all fuel used for aviation in the country. The methods are 
based on total fuel use, and should completely cover CO2 emissions. However, the allocation between LTO and 
cruise will not be complete for Tier 2 method if the LTO statistics are not complete. Also, Tier 2 method focuses 
on passenger and freight carrying scheduled and charter flights, and thus not all aviation. In addition, Tier 2 
method does not automatically include non-scheduled flights and general aviation such as agricultural airplanes, 
private jets or helicopters, which should be added if the quantity of fuel is significant. Completeness may also be 
an issue where military data are confidential; in this situation it is good practice to aggregate military fuel use 
with another source category.  
Other aviation-related activities that generate emissions include: fuelling and fuel handling in general, 
maintenance of aircraft engines and fuel jettisoning to avoid accidents. Also, in the wintertime, anti-ice and de-
ice treatment of wings and aircraft is a source of emissions at airport complexes. Many of the materials used in 
these treatments flow off the wings when planes are idling, taxiing, and taking off, and then evaporate. These 
emissions are, however, very minor and specific methods to estimate them are not included.  
There are additional challenges in distinguishing between domestic and international emissions. As each 
country’s data sources are unique for this category, it is not possible to formulate a general rule regarding how to 
make an assignment in the absence of clear data. It is good practice to specify clearly the assumptions made so 
that the issue of completeness can be evaluated. 
3.6.1.6 
DEVELOPING A CONSISTENT TIME SERIES 
Volume 1 Chapter 5: Time Series Consistency and Recalculation of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines provides more 
information on how to develop emission estimates in cases where the same data sets or methods cannot be used 
during every year of the time series. If activity data are unavailable for the base year (e.g. 1990) an option may 
be to extrapolate data to this year by using changes in freight and passenger kilometres, total fuel used or 
supplied, or the number of LTOs (aircraft movements).  
Emissions trends of CH4 and NOx (and by inference N2O) will depend on aircraft engine technology and the 
change in composition of a country's fleet. This change in fleet composition may have to be accounted for in the 
future, and this is best accomplished using Tier 2 and Tier 3B methods based on individual aircraft types for 
1990 and subsequent years. If fleet composition is not changing, the same set of emission factors should be used 
for all years.  
Every method should be able to reflect accurately the results of mitigation options that lead to changes in fuel 
use. However, only Tier 2 and 3B methods, based on individual aircraft, can capture the effect of mitigation 
options that result in lower emission factors.  
Tier 2 has been revised to account for NOx emissions in the climb phase, which are substantially different from 
those in cruise, and the differences in the amount of NOx calculated during that phase could be in the range of 
approximately 15 to 20 percent, due to the thrust/power required in that phase, and its relation with the higher 
production of NOx. Special care should be taken to develop a consistent time series if Tier 2 is used. 
 
Chapter 3: Mobile Combustion  
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.69 
3.6.1.7 
UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT 
EMISSION FACTORS  
The CO2 emission factors should be within a range of ±5 percent, as they are dependent only on the carbon 
content of the fuel and fraction oxidised. However, considerable uncertainty is inherent in the computation of 
CO2 based on the uncertainties in activity data discussed below. For Tier 1, the uncertainty of the CH4 emission 
factor may range between -57 and +100 percent. The uncertainty of the N2O emission factor may range between 
-70 and +150 percent Moreover, CH4 and N2O emission factors vary with technology and using a single 
emission factor for aviation in general is a considerable simplification. 
Information to assist in computing uncertainties associated with LTO emission factors found in Table 3.6.9 can 
be found in Lister and Norman, 2003; and ICAO, 1993. Information to assist in computing the uncertainties 
associated with cruise emission factors found in Table 3.6.10 data can be found in: Baughcum et al, 1996. 
Sutkus, et al, 2001; Eyers et al, 2004; Kim, 2005 a and b; Malwitz, 2005. If resources are not available to 
compute uncertainties, uncertainty bands can be used as defined as default factors in Section 3.6.1.2. 
Special attention should be taken with the cruise NOx emission factors for Tier 2 found in Table 3.6.10. These 
emission factors, have been updated from the 1996 Guidelines to reflect the fact that climb phase emissions are 
substantially different from those in cruise. The calculation of the NOx emission factors is based on two sets of 
data, one from 1 km to 9 km, and the second from 9 km to 13 km., and the differences in the amount of NOx 
calculated during that phase could be in the range of approximately 15 to 20 percent, due to the thrust/power 
required in that phase, and its relation with the higher production of NOx. If Tier 2 is used, care should be taken 
to report a consistent time series (see Section 3.6.1.6 and Volume 1, Chapter 5). 
ACTIVITY DATA 
The uncertainty in the reporting will be strongly influenced by the accuracy of the data collected on domestic 
aviation separately from international aviation. With complete survey data, the uncertainty may be very low (less 
than 5 percent) while for estimates or incomplete surveys the uncertainties may become large, perhaps a factor of 
two for the domestic share. The uncertainty ranges cited represent an informal polling of experts aiming to 
approximate the 95 percent confidence interval around the central estimate. The uncertainty will vary widely 
from country to country and is difficult to generalise. The use of global data sets, supported by radar, may be 
helpful in this area, and it is expected that reporting will improve for this category in the future.  
3.6.2 
Inventory Quality Assurance/Quality Control 
(QA/QC) 
It is good practice to conduct quality control checks as outlined in Chapter 6 of Volume 1 (Quality Assurance/ 
Quality Control and Verification), Tier 1 General Inventory Level QC Procedures. It is good practice to conduct 
expert review of the emission estimates when using Tier 2 or 3 methods. Additional quality control checks as 
outlined in Tier 2 procedures in the same chapter and quality assurance procedures may also be applicable, 
particularly if higher tier methods are used to determine emissions from this source category. Inventory 
compilers are encouraged to use higher tier QA/QC for key categories as identified in Chapter 4 of Volume I.  
Specific procedures relevant to this source category are outlined below. 
Comparison of emissions using alternative approaches 
If higher tier approaches are used, the inventory compiler should compare inventories to estimates with lower 
tiers. Any anomaly between the emission estimates should be investigated and explained. The results of such 
comparisons should be recorded for internal documentation.  
Review of Emission factors 
If national factors are used rather than the default values, directly reference the QC review associated with the 
publication of the emission factors, and include this review in the QA/QC documentation to ensure that the 
procedures are consistent with good practice. If possible, the inventory compiler should compare the IPCC 
default values to national factors to provide further indication that the factors are applicable. If emissions from 
military use were developed using data other than the default factors, the accuracy of the calculations and the 
applicability and relevance of the data should be checked.

Activity data check 
The source of the activity data should be reviewed to ensure applicability and relevance to the source category. 
Where possible, the inventory compiler should compare current data to historical activity data or model outputs 
to look for anomalies. In preparing the inventory estimates, the inventory compiler should ensure the reliability 
of the activity data used to differentiate emissions between domestic and international aviation.  
Data can be checked with productivity indicators such as fuel per unit of traffic performance (per passenger km 
or ton km). Where data from different countries are being compared, the band of data should be small. The 
European Environmental Agency provides a useful dataset20 which presents emissions and passenger/freight 
volume for each transportation mode for Europe. For example, Norway estimates that for domestic aviation, 
emissions are 0.22 kg CO2/passenger-km. However, note that the global fleet includes many small aircraft with 
relatively low energy efficiency. The U.S. Department of Transportation estimates an average energy intensity 
for the U.S. fleet of 3666 Btu/passenger mile (2403 kJ/passenger km). The International Air Transport 
Association estimates that the average aircraft consumes 3.5 litres of jet fuel per 100 passenger-km (67 passenger 
miles per U.S. gallon). 
Reliance on scheduled operations for activity data may introduce higher uncertainties than simple reliance on 
fuel use for CO2. However, fuel loss and use of jet fuel for other activities will result in over estimates of 
aviation’s contributions.  
External review 
The inventory compiler should perform an independent, objective review of calculations, assumptions or 
documentation of the emissions inventory to assess the effectiveness of the QC programme. The review should 
be performed by expert(s) (e.g. aviation authorities, airline companies, and military staff) who are familiar with 
the source category and who understand inventory requirements.  
3.6.3 
Reporting and Documentation  
It is good practice to document and archive all information required to produce the national emissions inventory 
estimates as outlined in Chapter 8 of Volume 1 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. Some examples of specific 
documentation and reporting relevant to this source category are provided below.  
Inventory compilers are required to report emissions from international aviation separately from domestic 
aviation, and exclude international aviation from national totals. It is expected that all countries have aviation 
activity and should therefore report emissions from this category. Though countries covering small areas might 
not have domestic aviation, emissions from international aviation should be reported. Inventory compilers should 
explain how the definition for international and domestic in the guidelines has been applied.  
Transparency would be improved if inventory compilers provide data on emissions from LTO separately from 
cruise operations. Emissions from military aviation should be clearly specified, so as to improve the transparency 
on national greenhouse gas inventories. In addition to the numerical information reported in the standard tables, 
provision of the following data would increase transparency: 
• 
Sources of fuel data and other essential data (e.g. fuel consumption factors) depending on the method used; 
• 
The number of flight movements split between domestic and international; 
• 
Emission factors used, if different from default values. Data sources should be referenced. 
• 
If Tier 3 method is used, emissions data could be provided separately for Commercial Scheduled Aviation 
and Other Jet Fuelled Activities.   
Confidentiality may be a problem if only one or two airline companies operate domestic transport in a given 
country. Confidentiality may also be a problem for reporting military aviation in a transparent manner.  
3.6.4 
Reporting tables and worksheets 
The four pages of the worksheets (Annex 1) for the Tier 1 Sectoral Approach are to be filled in for each of the 
source categories in Table 3.6.1. The reporting tables are available in Volume 1, Chapter 8.

Definitions of specialist terms 
Aviation Gasoline - A fuel used only in small piston engine aircraft, and which generally 
represents less than 1% of fuel used in aviation 
Climb – The part of a flight of an aircraft, after take off and above 914 meters (3000 feet) above 
ground level, consisting of getting an aircraft to the desired cruising altitude. 
Commercial scheduled – All commercial aircraft operations that have publicly available schedules 
(e.g., the Official Airline Guide, OAG 2006), which would primarily include passenger services.  
Activities that do not operate with publicly available schedules are not included in this definition, 
such as non-scheduled cargo, charter, air-taxi and emergency response operations. Note: 
Commercial Scheduled Aviation is used as a subset of jet fuel powered aviation operations. 
Cruise – All aircraft activities that take place at altitudes above 914 meters (3000 feet), including 
any additional climb or descent operations above this altitude. No upper limit is given.  
Gas Turbine Engines – Rotary engines that extract energy from a flow of combustion gas. Energy 
is added to the gas stream in the combustor, where air is mixed with fuel and ignited. Combustion 
increases the temperature and volume of the gas flow. This is directed through a nozzle over a 
turbine's blades, spinning the turbine and powering a compressor. For an aircraft, energy is 
extracted either in the form of thrust or through a turbine driving a fan or propeller.
