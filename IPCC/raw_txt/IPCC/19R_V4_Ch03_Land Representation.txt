3 CONSISTENT REPRESENTATION OF LANDS 
3.1 
INTRODUCTION 
This chapter provides guidance on using different types of data to represent land-use categories, and conversions 
between land-use categories, so that they are applied as appropriately and consistently as possible in inventory 
calculations.  
Countries use various methods to obtain data, including annual census, periodic surveys and remote sensing. Each 
of these methods of data collection will yield different types of information (e.g., maps or tabulations), at different 
reporting frequencies, and with different attributes. Guidance is provided on the use of three generic approaches.   
Approach 1 identifies the total area for each individual land-use category within a country, but does not provide 
detailed information on the nature of conversions between land uses. Approach 2 introduces tracking of 
conversions between land-use categories. Approach 3 extends Approach 2 by allowing land-use conversions to be 
tracked through time on a spatially explicit basis. Countries may use a mix of Approaches for different regions 
over time. 
The guidance presented here is intended to assist countries in making the best use of available data and reducing, 
as far as practicable, possible overlaps and omissions in reporting. The guidance allows informed decisions on the 
appropriate use of data of different types by those preparing greenhouse gas inventories, but is not intended to be 
prescriptive on how data may be collected.  Generally, all data should be:  
• adequate, i.e., capable of representing land-use categories, and conversions between land-use categories, as 
needed to estimate carbon stock changes and greenhouse gas emissions and removals;  
• consistent, i.e., capable of representing land-use categories consistently over time, without being unduly 
affected by artificial discontinuities in time-series data; 
• complete, which means that all land within a country should be included, with increases in some areas balanced 
by decreases in others, recognizing the bio-physical stratification of land if needed (and as can be supported 
by data) for estimating and reporting emissions and removals of greenhouse gases; and 
• transparent, i.e., data sources, definitions, methodologies and assumptions should be clearly described. 
• The descriptions of land use follow the framework of:  
• land-use category - is the broad land use (one of the six land-use categories described below) reported as either 
land remaining in a land-use category (i.e., remaining in the same use throughout the inventory time-series) or 
land converted to a new land-use category (representing a change in land use).  
• sub-category - refers to special circumstances (e.g., areas of grazing within Forest Land) that are estimated and 
reported separately but do not duplicate land in the broad land-use category.  
• Land-use categories and sub-categories may be further stratified on the basis of land-use practices and bio-
physical characteristics in order to create more homogeneous spatial units as may be used for emissions 
estimation (see Table 3.1 for examples). 
Using the above approaches and framework, consistent representation of lands at the national level for inventory 
purposes is achieved by following the main steps outlined below: 
1. provide country-specific definitions of land-use categories (see Section 3.2); 
2. decide which Approaches and methods to use to develop activity data (see Sections 3.3.1 and 3.3.3), 
considering the methods to be used for estimating greenhouse gas emissions and removals (see Section 3.4) 
and for estimating uncertainties (see Section 3.5).; 
3. stratify the entire land area of the country as appropriate (see Section 3.3.6); 
4. obtain data for these categories ensuring that the data cover the total land area of the country (see Section 3.2 
and 3.3); 
5. where needed, develop rules to translate land cover information into IPCC land-use and land-use change 
categories, using auxiliary information as appropriate (see Section 3.3.5); 
6. collect additional information if required (e.g., in situ or ground reference data, sampling, land use statistics 
etc.);

7. develop area estimates for land-use and land-use change categories according to good practice ensuring that 
all IPCC requirements for completeness, avoidance of double-counting, accuracy and time-series consistency 
(Chapter 5, Volume 1), are met; 
8. develop uncertainty estimates for the area estimates (see section 3.5). 
3.2 
LAND-USE CATEGORIES 
While the terms “land-use” and “land cover” are sometimes used interchangeably, they are not the same. Land 
cover refers to the bio-physical coverage of land (e.g., bare soil, rocks, forests, buildings and roads or lakes). Land-
use refers to the socioeconomic use that is made of the land (e.g. agriculture, commerce, residential use or 
recreation) (UNEP/FAO 1993). The definitions of land-use categories may incorporate management options and 
predominance over other land-uses when a land is subject to multiple uses.  
Attribution is the process of associating observed land cover and cover changes with land-use and land use change. 
Because different management and disturbance types have different impacts on carbon stocks and GHG emissions, 
knowledge of the cause of disturbance is needed not only to estimate areas of land-use and land-use change but 
also to estimate the associated GHG emissions and removals.  
The six broad land-use categories described below form the basis for estimating and reporting greenhouse gas 
emissions and removals from land-use and land-use conversions. The land-uses may be considered as top-level 
categories for representing all land-use areas, with sub-divisions describing specific circumstances significant to 
emissions estimation. The categories are broad enough to classify all land areas in most countries and to 
accommodate differences in national land-use classification systems, and may be readily stratified (e.g., by climate 
or ecological zones). The categories (and sub-categories) are intended to be identified through the use of 
Approaches for representing land-use area data described in subsequent sections.  
The land-use categories for greenhouse gas inventory reporting are listed below. These definitions are provided 
for the IPCC land-use categories because they are:  
• robust as a basis for emissions and removals estimation; 
• implementable; and  
• complete, in that all land areas in a country may be classified by these categories without duplication. 
(i) Forest Land 
This category includes all land with woody vegetation consistent with thresholds used to define Forest Land in the 
national greenhouse gas inventory. It also includes systems with a vegetation structure that currently fall below, 
but in situ could potentially reach the threshold values used by a country to define the Forest Land category. 
(ii) Cropland  
This category includes cropped land, including rice fields, and agro-forestry systems where the vegetation structure 
falls below the thresholds used for the Forest Land category.  
(iii) Grassland  
This category includes rangelands and pasture land that are not considered Cropland. It also includes systems with 
woody vegetation and other non-grass vegetation such as herbs and bushes that fall below the threshold values 
used in the Forest Land category. The category also includes all grassland from wild lands to recreational areas as 
well as agricultural and silvi-pastural systems, consistent with national definitions. 
(iv) Wetlands  
This category includes areas of peat extraction and land that is covered or saturated by water for all or part of the 
year (peatlands and other wetland types) and that does not fall into the Forest Land, Cropland, Grassland or 
Settlements categories. It includes reservoirs as a managed sub-division and natural rivers and lakes as unmanaged 
sub-divisions. Further definitions of wetlands sub-divisions are provided in the IPCC Wetland Supplement (IPCC 
2014). 
(v) Settlements  
This category includes all developed land, including transportation infrastructure and human settlements of any 
size, unless they are already included under other categories. This should be consistent with national definitions. 
(vi) Other Land 
This category includes bare soil, rock, ice, and all land areas that do not fall into any of the other five categories. 
It allows the total of identified land areas to match the national area, where data are available.  
Chapter 3: Consistent Representation of Lands 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.7 
If data are available, countries are encouraged to classify unmanaged lands by the above land-use categories (e.g., 
into Unmanaged Forest Land, Unmanaged Grassland, and Unmanaged Wetlands). This will improve transparency 
and enhance the ability to track land-use conversions from specific types of unmanaged lands into the categories 
above. 
Countries can apply other definitions within the IPCC categories, which may or may not refer to internationally 
accepted definitions, such as those proposed by FAO, Ramsar1, SEEA2, WCA3 and others. However, where there 
are inconsistencies between these other definitions and the IPCC land-use categories definitions, the data should 
be adjusted to fit within the IPCC categories. To ensure and show consistency and completeness of the land 
representation reported, it is good practice to map the relationship between IPCC land-use categories and any other 
land-use and land cover classification systems4 from which data for the land representation are derived. All 
definitions and classifications of land-use categories (and sub-categories) should be specified at the national level, 
described in a transparent manner, and be applied consistently over time. To avoid double-counting of land areas 
or misallocation of lands, each land unit is only reported in one category (or sub-division) in each year. 
When moving unmanaged land to managed land, it is good practice to describe the processes that lead to the re-
categorization. Managed land generally cannot become unmanaged as the legacy effects of past management can 
continue for extended periods, and such moves could result in anthropogenic emissions and removals being 
unreported. 
Where countries choose to develop country-specific methods for addressing issues of interannual variability (IAV), 
it is good practice to describe the methods used to identify lands subject to natural disturbances (see Section 2.6, 
Chapter 2, Volume 4) and to transparently report the area of these lands together with the rest of the lands in the 
same land use category.  
LAND-USE CONVERSIONS 
Full application of the guidance requires estimation of land-use conversions that take place between data collection 
intervals, particularly when different carbon stock estimates and different emission and removal factors are 
associated with lands before and after a transition. Applicable land-uses and land-use conversions are shown below: 
FF 
= 
Forest land Remaining Forest land 
 
LF 
= 
Land Converted to Forest land 
CC 
= 
Cropland Remaining Cropland 
 
LC 
= 
Land Converted to Cropland 
GG 
= 
Grassland Remaining Grassland 
 
LG 
= 
Land Converted to Grassland 
 
 
 
WW 
= 
Wetlands Remaining Wetlands 
 
LW 
= 
Land Converted to Wetlands 
SS 
= 
Settlements Remaining Settlements 
 
LS 
= 
Land Converted to Settlements 
OO 
= 
Other Land Remaining Other Land 
 
LO 
= 
Land Converted to Other Land 
Where detailed data about the origin of land converted to a category are available (which will depend on the 
Approach available to a country to represent land-use areas), countries can specify the land-use conversion. For 
example, LC can be sub-divided into Forest Land Converted to Cropland (FC) and Grassland Converted to 
Cropland (GC). While both land areas end up in the Cropland category, the differences in their emissions and 
removals of greenhouse gases due to their origin should be represented and reported wherever possible. When 
applying these land-use category conversions, countries should classify land under only one (end land-use) 
category to prevent double counting. The reporting category is therefore the end-use category, not the category of 
origin prior to the land-use conversion.  
If a country's national land-use classification system does not match categories (i) to (vi) as described above, the 
land-use classifications should be combined or disaggregated in order to represent the categories presented here. 
(See Section 3.3.5 “Derivation of IPCC Land-Use Categories from Land Cover Information” in this Chapter). 
Countries should report on the procedure adopted for the reallocation. The national definitions for all categories 
used in the inventory and any threshold or parameter values used in the definitions should be specified. Where

2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
national land classification systems are being changed or developed for the first time, compatibility with land-use 
classes (i) to (vi) above should be sought. 
The broad land-use categories listed above may be further stratified (as described in Section 3.3.6) by climate or 
ecological zone, soil and vegetation type, etc., as necessary, to match land areas with the methods for assessing 
carbon stock changes and greenhouse gas emissions and removals described in Chapters 2 and 4 to 9 of this 
Volume. Default climate and soil classification schemes are provided in Annex 3A.5. Examples of stratifications 
that are used for Tier 1 emissions and removals estimation are summarized in Table 3.1. Specific stratification 
systems vary by land use and carbon pools and are used in the estimation methods later in this Volume. Guidance 
on stratifying land-use areas to match data needs for estimating emissions and removals is provided in Section 
3.3.6 of this chapter.  
The method of determining areas of land-use and land-use change should be capable of representing lands 
according to the definitions applied by the country, and ensure that losses or gains smaller than the minimum 
mapping unit do not lead to bias in emission and removal estimates. 
In some cases, the spatial resolution of existing maps or sample units may be coarser than the definitions used to 
describe some of the land-use categories (e.g., if the Forest Land definition applied by a country includes a 
minimum area of, say, one hectare, yet the available land-use data has a minimum mapping unit of five hectares). 
This may lead to a situation where:  
• small areas of one or more land-use categories are reported under another category; and,  
• areas of land-use change are either under or overestimated.  
Where this occurs, it is good practice to assess the extent of under or over reporting and, where necessary, 
supplement the results with further samples or auxiliary information (e.g., concession boundaries, subsidies for 
land use changes or land management) that reflect the chosen definitions to validate the results and/or correct for 
these errors.  Where data are not available, techniques provided in Chapter 5 of Volume 1: Time Series Consistency 
can be used to address the data gaps. 
When land cover change information is used, auxiliary data is commonly required to allocate land cover change 
to the underlying cause of disturbance and to assign lands to the IPCC land-use categories through time. This 
process of attribution typically requires a combination of information including, but not limited to, past and current 
land cover, management practices and country-specific decisions on a series of reporting rules (see Box 3.1a). 
Moreover, reporting rules can also be applied to help countries determine how land-use change is categorized (Box 
3.1a).

EXAMPLES OF ASSIGNING IPCC LAND-USE AND LAND-USE CHANGE CATEGORIES 
IPCC land-
use categories 
Key elements that may 
need to be considered 
Examples 
Forest Land 
Definition of Forest 
Land to be applied to 
determine areas of 
Forest Land.  
While countries can set their own definitions, Forest Land should 
include all land with woody vegetation that meets country specific 
thresholds (e.g., a combination of minimum canopy cover, minimum 
height and minimum area) used to define Forest Lands. 
Reporting lands 
converted to Forest 
Land but where the 
vegetation structure 
currently does not 
necessarily meet the 
national definition of 
Forest Land.  
When establishing new forests (e.g., reforestation, forest restoration) it 
is often the case that the vegetation will not meet the national 
definition of Forest Land for some years. However, this land can be 
classed as Forest Land at the point of conversion. 
Determining if the land has the ‘potential’ to reach the national 
definitions can consider criteria such as 1) that a woody vegetation 
type exists on the land (e.g., newly planted or regrowing trees), and 2) 
it will be able to reach the Forest Land definition thresholds (e.g., the 
forest type will be able meet the Forest Land definition on that land).  
Countries typically document the assumptions used to assess if land 
meets these criteria. Countries also often include the time period within 
which the land should reach the Forest Land definition thresholds 
following the conversion. 
Reporting Forest Land 
areas that in a specific 
inventory year or years 
fall below the country 
definition of Forest 
Land.  
There are typically two reasons that Forest Land temporarily falls 
below the country definition: 1) forest harvesting 2) other disturbances 
(e.g., fire, pest attack). When cover loss is only temporary countries 
generally continue to report these areas under Forest Land. Countries 
may use tenure or forest type maps to determine if a loss of cover is 
due to harvest or clearing. For other disturbances data on the type of 
disturbance can be obtained from maps or statistical information.  
It is possible that some areas of temporarily destocked Forest Land will 
not recover to meet the definition of Forest Land. Countries can decide 
how long an area of Forest Land can remain temporarily destocked 
before it should be moved to a conversion category. The time chosen 
typically depends on expected recovery rates and may vary by, for 
example, forest type, land conditions and management practices and 
tenure. 
Cropland  
Reporting lands that are 
under opportunistic or 
rotational 
cropping/grazing/fallow 
practices. 
Management of agricultural lands often moves opportunistically 
between cropping-pasture/grazing systems or fallow depending on 
climate, soils and market conditions. Where this occurs countries may 
choose to either 1) keep reporting these lands under the predominant 
Land use, if any, or 2) transfer the lands between land use categories 
each reporting year. Countries using option 1 still apply the methods 
and emissions factors relevant for the actual land use and management 
system for estimating emissions and removals. 
Countries using option 1 typically document the land management 
practices and how they are grouped into a land use. They also may 
define the number of years after which if the land has not been cropped 
the land is moved to Grassland.  
Reporting of orchards, 
agroforestry or other 
woody crops. 
Depending on the definition of Forest Land used, some areas of 
orchards, agroforestry and woody crops can meet the definition of 
Forest Land. Countries typically document which woody crops meet 
the Forest Land definition and may also create sub-divisions under 
Cropland or Forest Land to separate these lands.  
Grassland 
Reporting of wooded 
areas and other non-
grass vegetation such as 
herbs and brushes that 
fall below the threshold 
values used in the 
Forest Land category.  
Where areas of wooded grasslands meet the national definition of 
Forest Land, they are reported under Forest Land. There may also be 
some areas of wooded grassland that are considered woody crops, such 
as naturally occurring areas of fruit or nut trees.

EXAMPLES OF ASSIGNING IPCC LAND-USE AND LAND-USE CHANGE CATEGORIES 
IPCC land-use 
categories 
Key elements that may 
need to be considered 
Examples 
Wetlands 
Separating different 
types of Wetlands and 
water bodies. 
Wetlands include a range of different lands and waterways that 
occur within a national boundary.  
Countries typically adopt national definitions of Wetlands. Some 
also use globally available products such as maps of wetlands 
reported under the Ramsar [1] convention to assist with sub-
categorisation. 
Determining the 
boundary between land 
and marine systems. 
In many areas there is an indistinct boundary between land and 
marine ecosystems (e.g., mangroves).  
To remain consistent with other areas of the inventory, countries 
typically use the agreed national border to separate land from marine 
systems. Emissions occurring in the marine ecosystem outside of the 
national borders are not captured under the AFOLU sector. 
Settlements 
Reporting of areas that 
could also be classified 
as other land-uses. 
Settlements may also contain lands with a cover that could be 
included in other land uses, such as urban parks, lawns and small 
semi-urban farms.  
Where an area of land meets the national definition of Forest Land 
then the land is reported as Forest Land. Other areas, such as lawns, 
may be included under Settlements unless they meet the definition 
applied for the other land uses, such as Grassland or Cropland. For 
example, urban areas with a land cover of scattered trees and grass 
are often classed as Settlements as they do not meet the definition of 
Forest Land and are not managed in line with the national definitions 
for other land use categories.

REPRESENTING LAND-USE AREAS 
This section describes three Approaches that may be used to represent areas of land-use using the categories 
defined in the previous section. The Approaches are presented below in order of increasing information content. 
Approach 1 identifies the total change in area for each individual land-use category within a country but does not 
provide information on the nature and area of conversions between land-uses. Approach 2 introduces tracking of 
land-use conversions between categories, but it does not allow land-use conversions to be tracked through time. 
Approach 3 extends Approach 2 by allowing land-use conversions to be tracked through time on a spatially explicit 
basis. 
The Approaches are not presented as a hierarchical system. When considering which Approach to adopt countries 
should consider their national circumstances, including data availability and quality, patterns of land use and land-
use change, land management, ecosystem characteristics and the emissions estimation methods to be used. Using 
activity data that are not consistent with the emissions estimation methods can decrease accuracy of carbon stock 
changes and the associated emissions and removals estimates. 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
3.12 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
The Approaches are not mutually exclusive, and a country can use a mix of Approaches for different regions of 
the country and/or land uses based on national circumstances. In all cases, it is good practice to describe how the 
approaches are used together and demonstrate how approaches applied cover all the land uses and land use changes, 
provide consistent time-series and prevent misallocation of lands within and between land use categories. 
All data should reflect the historical trends in land-use area, as needed for the inventory methods described in 
Chapters 2 and 4 to 9 of this Volume. The commencement time for the historical data required is based on the 
amount of time needed for dead organic matter and soil carbon stocks to reach equilibrium following land-use 
conversion (20 years is recommended as a default, but can e.g. be longer, e.g., for temperate and boreal systems). 
After the period to reach equilibrium has passed, land that was added to a land-use conversion category needs to 
be transferred to “land remaining in a land-use category”. The time-series data on land-use conversion is therefore 
also used to determine the annual transfer of area from the category “land converted to category” to “land 
remaining in a land-use category”.  
TIME-SERIES 
Inventories require data on land-use area for at least two points in time relevant to the inventory year.  For 
Approach 1 (identifying only the net national change in area of each land-use category, but not the transfers 
between them), the historical land-use may still not be known. In such circumstances countries should either infer 
the previous land-use (see Section 3.3.7 below) or assume that the land has remained in the land-use category for 
all time prior to the land-use conversion. This assumption may underestimate removals where conversions to land-
uses with higher carbon contents predominate, or underestimate emissions in the opposite case. 
It is important that there is a consistent time-series in the preparation of land-use category and conversion data so 
that artefact from method change is not included as an actual land-use conversion. Care should also be taken to 
ensure that the areas of managed and unmanaged land are both defined and estimated consistently. The following 
section details how to deal with changes in managed land areas (and consequent changes in carbon stock) when 
using stock change methods for emissions estimation. 
CONSISTENT USE OF LAND AREA IN CARBON STOCK ESTIMATES 
Over the time-series of a national inventory, it is likely that the total area of managed lands will increase as 
unmanaged lands are converted to managed land. In this case, where the land area is used to estimate the carbon 
stock (when using a stock-difference method of emissions estimation), it is possible that the entry of additional 
land into the inventory (by changing from an unmanaged to managed status) will incorrectly appear as a carbon 
stock increase. This could wrongly be inferred as a removal from the atmosphere, whereas in reality it is only an 
increase due to the expanded land-use area over the inventory time-series. To separate carbon stock increases 
arising from changes in area from true carbon stock changes, carbon stock estimates should be recalculated for the 
complete inventory time-series area whenever the total area of managed land changes in an annual inventory.  
The maximum area of land (and associated carbon stock) at any point in the time-series should be used as the basis 
for emissions and removals estimation throughout the inventory time-series. Carbon stocks on unmanaged lands 
can be assumed to remain constant (thus, carbon stock changes would be zero) until the year in which land is 
classified as a managed use. The recalculation will therefore change the initial carbon stock estimate in the year 
the land entered the inventory but will not affect the estimation of carbon stock change over the inventory time-
series until the relevant land becomes managed. 
DATA AVAILABILITY 
For many countries, implementing these inventory guidelines may require new data collection. Annex 3A.2.4 
provides guidance on remote sensing techniques, Annex 3A.3 provides general guidance on sampling techniques 
and Annex 3A.4 on spatially explicit (Approach 3) datasets. Where the data needed to apply these inventory 
guidelines on land-use are not available nationally, data on land categories may be derived from global datasets. 
For instance, FAO has such datasets, however, care should be taken as these are compiled with national data, 
(primary data), or secondary data gathered by a third party. More examples are provided in Annex 3A.1, but 
generally report on the basis of land cover only, and not land-use (See Section 3.3.5). It is preferable that data used 
should be capable of producing input to uncertainty calculations (See Section 3.5).  
When using land-use data, inventory compilers should: 
• Harmonize definitions between the existing independent databases as well as with the land-use categories to 
minimize gaps and overlaps. For example, overlaps might occur if woodland on farms were included both in 
forestry and agricultural datasets. In order to harmonize data, the woodland should be counted only once for 
greenhouse gas inventory purposes, taking into account the forest definition adopted nationally (See Section 
“Multiple land-uses in a single unit of land”). Information on possible overlaps for the purposes of 
harmonization should be available from agencies responsible for surveys. Harmonization of definitions does 
not mean that agencies should abandon definitions that are of use to them but should establish the relationship 
Chapter 3: Consistent Representation of Lands 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.13 
between definitions in use with the aim of eliminating double counting and omissions. This should be done 
throughout the dataset to maintain time-series consistency. 
• Ensure that the land-use categories used can identify all relevant activities. For example, if a country needs to 
track a managed land-use category such as Forest Land, then the classification system must distinguish 
managed from unmanaged Forest Land. 
• Ensure that data acquisition methods are reliable, well documented methodologically, timely, at an appropriate 
scale, and from reliable sources.  
• Ensure the consistent application of category definitions between time periods. For example, countries should 
check whether the definition of forest has changed over time in terms of tree crown cover and other parameters. 
If changes are identified, use the corrected data for recalculation consistently throughout the time-series, and 
report on actions taken. Guidance on recalculation can be found in Volume 1 Chapter 5. 
• Prepare uncertainty estimates for those land-use areas and conversions in area that will be used in the estimation 
of carbon stock changes, greenhouse gas emissions and removals. 
• Ensure that the national land area is consistent across the inventory time-series; otherwise stock changes will 
reflect false C increases or decreases due to a change in total land area accounted for when using a stock change 
emissions estimation method.  
• Assess whether the sum of the areas in the land classification databases is consistent with the total national 
area, given the level of data uncertainty. If coverage is complete, then the net sum of all the changes in land 
area between two time periods should be zero to within the uncertainties involved. In cases where coverage is 
incomplete, the difference between the area covered and the national area should, in general, be stable or vary 
slowly with time, again to within the uncertainties expected in the data. If the balancing term varies rapidly, or 
(in the case of complete coverage) sums are not equal, inventory compilers should investigate, explain, and 
make any corrections necessary. These checks on the total area should take into account the uncertainties in 
the annual or periodic surveys or censuses involved. Information on uncertainties should be obtained from the 
agencies responsible for the surveys. Remaining differences between the sum of areas accounted for by the 
available data and the national area should be within the expected uncertainty for area estimation. 
For some activities reported, such as the application of nitrogen fertilizer, liming and harvested wood products, 
only national aggregate data may be available. Where emissions and removals estimation methods are applied at 
a national level, it is appropriate to use such data without categorization by land-use 
3.3.1 
Three Approaches 
APPROACH 1: 
TOTAL LAND-USE AREA, NO DATA ON 
CONVERSIONS BETWEEN LAND-USES 
Approach 1 represents land-use area totals within a defined spatial unit, which is often defined by political 
boundaries, such as a country, province or municipality. Another characteristic of Approach 1 data is that only the 
net changes in land-use area can be tracked through time. Consequently, the exact location or pattern of the land-
uses is not known within the spatial unit, and moreover the exact changes in land-use categories cannot be 
ascertained. Datasets are likely to have been prepared for other purposes, such as forestry or agricultural statistics. 
Frequently, several datasets will be combined to cover all national land classifications and regions of a country. In 
this case the absence of a unified data system can potentially lead to double counting or omission, since the 
agencies involved may use different definitions of specific land-use for assembling their databases. Ways to deal 
with this are suggested below.  
Tables 3.2 and 3.3 show summary land-use area data for a hypothetical country (with a national land area of 140 
million ha) using locally relevant land classifications. Table 3.2. is prepared at the level of the broad land-use 
categories. Table 3.3 depicts the same information with example stratifications to estimate the effect of various 
activities using the emissions estimation methods described elsewhere in this Volume.  
Determination of the area of land-use conversion in each category is based on the difference in area at two points 
in time, either with partial or full land area coverage. No specification of inter-category conversions (i.e., ‘land 
remaining in a land-use category’ and ‘land converted to a new land-use category’) is possible under Approach 1 
unless supplementary data are available (which would then introduce a mix with Approach 2).  
The land-use area data may come originally from periodic sample survey data, maps or censuses (such as 
landowner surveys), but will probably not be spatially explicit. The sum of all land-use category areas may or may 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
3.14 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
not equal the total area of the country or region under consideration, and the net result of land-use conversions 
may or may not equal zero, depending on the consistency in data collection and application in the inventories for 
each land-use category. The final result of this Approach is a table of land-use at given points in time.  Because 
the total land base that is reported each year for all land-use categories should remain constant, a table similar to 
Table 3.3 should be generated as a QA/QC measure.  If inconsistencies are found, it is good practice to identify 
and correct the problem(s) for future inventories. This may require closer coordination among inventory teams for 
separate land-use categories (if analysed separately) or possibly new surveys or other types of data collection. 
Other parts of this Volume require information on land area in each land-use category presented in Table 3.3 to be 
broken down into the categories “land remaining in the same land-use category” and “land converted to a new 
land-use category”. This is dependent on methodological requirements in other chapters of this Volume. If land-
use data are not sufficient to support Approach 2 (see below), where the total (gross) land conversion areas can be 
quantified, the emissions and removals may be reported in the “land remaining in the same land-use category” (as 
specified in Table 3.2). This is because the data may only be sufficient to identify the net change in area of each 
land-use category, and not the total effect of all land conversions. However, in general the methods for both soils 
and biomass related emissions estimation require land area data categorized by “lands remaining” and “converted 
to” categories and thus it is desirable to do this if possible, even if this is done using expert judgment.   
Note that by reporting only in the “land remaining” category, emissions and removals will include, but not 
explicitly reflect a changing land base within a land-use category (different areas, e.g., by the net transition in areas 
to and from the Forest Land category) over time. This may overestimate or underestimate emissions for that 
particular “land remaining” category. However, a complete inventory will tend to counter-balance this with 
emissions and removals from another “land remaining” category in the inventory.  
It is acceptable to report non-CO2 emission by source category without attribution to land-uses if emissions are 
estimated based on national statistics, without reference to individual land-uses (e.g., N2O emissions from soils).  
Methods outlined in this Volume frequently estimate emissions using national statistics in this manner.

APPROACH 2: 
TOTAL LAND-USE AREA, INCLUDING CHANGES 
BETWEEN CATEGORIES 
The essential feature of Approach 2 is that it provides an assessment of both total losses and gains in the area of 
specific land-use categories and what these conversions represent (i.e., changes both from and to a category). Thus, 
Approach 2 differs from Approach 1 in that it includes information on conversions between categories, but is still 
only tracking those changes across two points in time. Tracking land-use conversions in this manner will normally 
require estimation of initial and final land-use categories for all conversion types, as well as of total area of 
unchanged land by category. The final result of this Approach can be presented as a non-spatially-explicit land-
use conversion matrix. The matrix form is a compact format for representing the areas that have come under 
different conversions between all possible land-use categories. Existing land-use databases may have sufficient 
detail for this Approach, or it may be necessary to obtain data through sampling or other methods. The input data 
may or may not have originally been spatially-explicit (i.e., mapped or otherwise geographically referenced). 
For Approach 2, emission and removal factors can be chosen to reflect differences in the rate of changes in carbon 
according to the conversions between any two categories, and differences in initial carbon stocks associated with 
different land-uses can be taken into account. For example, the rate of soil organic carbon loss will commonly be 
much higher from cropping than from pasture. 
Approach 2 is illustrated in Table 3.4 using the data from the Approach 1 example (Table 3.3) by adding 
information on all the conversions taking place. Such data can be written in the more compact form of a matrix 
and this is presented in Table 3.5. To illustrate the added value of Approach 2 and this land-use conversion matrix 
format, the data of Table 3.5 is given in Table 3.6 without the stratification of the land-use categories. This can be 
compared with the more limited information from Approach 1 in Table 3.2. In Table 3.6, the conversions into and 
out of land categories can be tracked, whereas in Table 3.2 only the net changes in a broad land-use category are 
detectable.    
In Tables 3.5 and 3.6, the area in the diagonal cells represents the area in each land-use category that was not 
affected by land-use conversion in this inventory year. In preparation for the greenhouse gas emission and removal 
estimations described elsewhere in this Volume, this area should be further sub-divided into the area that has 
remained in the land-use category and area that has been affected by a land-use conversion (i.e., the land converted 
to a different land-use category) in the previous Y years (where Y is the time period during which C pools are 
expected to reach equilibrium (the IPCC default is 20 years, based on soil C pools typical time to equilibrium after 
land-use conversion).  
Therefore, under the default assumption in every inventory year, the area converted to a land-use category should 
be added to the category “land converted to” and the same area removed from the land remaining in the land-use 
category. The area of land that entered that “land converted to” category, 21 years ago (if using the default 20 year 
period), should be removed and added to the category “land remaining land”. For example, in Table 3.5 if data 
indicated that four of the 56 Mha in the Grassland category had been converted from Forest Land 21 years ago, 
then four Mha of land should be moved from the category Land Converted to Grassland to the category Grassland 
Remaining Grassland in this annual inventory.

APPROACH 3: 
SPATIALLY-EXPLICIT LAND-USE CONVERSION 
DATA 
The key defining characteristic of Approach 3 is that it is both spatially and temporally consistent and explicit. 
Sample-based, survey-based and wall-to-wall methods can be considered Approach 3 depending on the design of 
the sampling/mapping program and the way the data is processed and analysed (Table 3.6A). The decision to use 
sample based, survey based or wall-to-wall methods, and how to process them, depends on national circumstances 
and the method applied to estimate carbon stock changes and the associated emissions and removals.  
Approach 3 data can be summarized in tables similar to Tables 3.5 and 3.6. The main advantage of spatially-
explicit data is that analysis tools such as Geographic Information Systems can be used to link multiple spatially-
explicit data sets (such as those used for stratification) and describe in detail the conditions on a particular piece 
of land prior to and after a land-use conversion. This analytical capacity can improve emissions estimates by better 
aligning land-use categories (and conversions) with strata mapped for classification of carbon stocks and emission 
factors by soil type, vegetation type. This may be particularly applicable for Tier 3 emission estimation 
methodologies. However, issues of compatible and comparable spatial resolutions need to be taken into account. 
An overview of potential methods for developing Approach 3 datasets is provided in Annex 3A.4. 
3.3.2 
Data of Land Representation 
Figure 3.1 is a decision tree to assist in describing and/or obtaining the data on land-use areas. It provides guidance 
on which Approach and method a country can use for representing lands depending on the availability of primary 
and secondary datasets. Approach 3 method, for example, can be applied if spatially explicit land-use data is 
available for the whole country including complete time series coverage. Geographically mixed Approach (1, 2 & 
3) can be used where limited spatial data is available. As shown in this figure, where data is missing new data can 
be collected or international datasets can be used to minimise gaps in geographical coverage. Similarly, 
interpolation or extrapolation techniques can be used where complete time series is not available and new data 
cannot be collected. This will ensure all lands are represented consistently using one of the three generic 
approaches. Lastly, it is important to document the choice of methods applied for land representation. 
All three Approaches can, if implemented appropriately and consistently, be used to produce robust greenhouse 
gas emission and removal estimates. However, it should be noted that Approach 1 will probably not detect changes 
in biomass, such as those due to the full extent of deforestation and reforestation on separate areas of land, but 
only those due to the net conversion of land-use area from a forest to a non-forest use. In general, only Approach 
3 will allow for the spatial representation required as an input to spatially-based carbon models.  
Different Approaches may be more effective over different time periods or may be required for different reporting 
purposes. Methods to carry out matching of the time-series between the different periods or uses should be applied.  
There are numerous sources of data and methods to process data that can be used to derive activity data. It is not 
necessarily the data itself that determines of the approach. For example, depending on how the data is used, a time-
series of data could be used to generate information at Approaches 1, 2 or 3. Other data, such as single surveys or 
sample processes used in isolation can only generate activity data at Approach 1. Where the data available allow 
for the application of approach higher than approach 1 it is good practice to do so to ensure that uncertainties are 
minimized as far as practicable. Table 3.6A provides some examples of different data and methods and the 
resulting Approach.

Methods for Land-Use and Land-Use Change 
Estimation 
The three main methods for estimating areas of land-use and land-use change are sample-based, survey-based and 
wall-to-wall. These methods are not mutually exclusive; for example, wall-to-wall methods typically require 
samples for calibration, validation and uncertainty analysis, and some sample methods require wall-to-wall maps 
for scaling as well as for dimensioning the sample size and designing the sample grid. The method itself does not

determine the Approach and all these methods can be used to develop land-use information at Approaches 1, 2 or 
3 (see Table 3.6A).  
Wall-to-wall methods 
The continually increasing volume and improving quality of data available from remote sensing allows countries 
to develop wall-to-wall maps of land cover and land cover change that, when combined with other data, can be 
used to generate land-use and land-use change information. There are numerous potential applications for remote 
sensing products to derive consistent land use and land use change estimates: 
• 
identifying land cover and land cover change (e.g., forest cover change and multiple land cover change types); 
• attribution of land cover change to specific disturbances (e.g., harvesting, clearing, fire) and processes (e.g., 
biomass growth) to determine land use; and, 
• stratification of land-use categories into logical units that facilitate the estimation of emissions and removals, 
such as forest condition, growth stage, time since disturbance and forest type.  
Although there is an ever-increasing focus on and availability of remote sensing data for wall-to-wall mapping, it 
is also possible to generate wall-to-wall methods using traditional mapping processes. For example, some countries 
have access to detailed maps of forest stands or agricultural areas with associated records of human interventions 
(such as harvesting) and other disturbances, such as fire. Combining these maps and records can produce time-
series consistent activity data. Where maps are not available, the record data can still be used in a survey type 
approach.  
There are two broad wall-to-wall methods:  
1. a consistent time-series of data using the same or similar sensors, common analysis methods and time-series 
processing methods; and,  
2. one or more maps developed using different sensors and methods, and not applying time-series consistent 
processes.  
When using Approach 3, wall-to-wall methods it is good practice to: 
• minimize the influence of misalignment of images or artefacts in data (e.g., cloud cover); 
• ensure the data will be consistent with the methods for estimating emissions and removals 
• ensure the time-series is dense enough to identify activities that drive emissions and removals (e.g., if the period 
between two points in time (i.e. the change detection period) is 5 years, but forest cover following clearing or 
harvesting recovers in 2 years, then management events affecting emissions and removals may be missed, 
depending on the method applied); 
• demonstrate that, in cases where the time between maps differ (e.g., a 5-year gap, followed by a 2-year gap), 
this does not bias results by changing detection rates; 
• use that the sensor data used in the maps does not cross over the mapping time period. For example, when 
creating composite products (e.g., to remove cloud or sensor errors) ensure that the images selected for one 
year are not the same or cross over image dates in the previous or following years (cross over occurs when e.g., 
a 2005 map uses data from 2002-2008 and a 2010 map uses data from 2007-2013);  
• demonstrate that the changes tracked through time are consistent and to report on any corrected biases and 
known uncertainties of the analysis.  
• ensure that any improvements made to any single map in the time-series are consistently applied to the other 
maps in the time-series and the results are recalculated, in particular when new maps are added to the time-
series; and 
• evaluate the final products to ensure consistent representation of land-use with no double counting or omission 
of lands. 
An example of an Approach 3 wall-to-wall approach can be found in Australia’s national inventory report 
(Department of the Environment and Energy 2018). 
It is challenging to maintain a spatially consistent time series where different land cover maps have been developed 
using different data (e.g., different sensors) or methods (different algorithms or operators using visual 
interpretation). In such cases it may not be possible to use this data in an Approach 3 context, since it is difficult 
to ensure that the land-uses will be spatially consistent through time in the time series. However such data may be 
used to stratify samples used in the application of Approach 2 (GFOI 2016).  
When using wall-to-wall Approach 2 methods it is good practice to: 
Chapter 3: Consistent Representation of Lands 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.23 
• describe the difference between the land cover data in the time series; 
• apply sample-based methods to determine uncertainties and correct for bias; and 
• describe how areas with potential multiple changes in land-use through time are addressed in estimating 
emissions and removals using the data. 
Sample based methods 
Sample based methods directly estimate land-use and land-use change from repeated samples. Samples may be 
obtained from ground surveys (such as a national forest inventory or national land survey) or remote sensing (e.g., 
satellite imagery, aerial photography or lidar or a combination of both). Well-designed sample-based methods 
provide an accurate statistical representation of land-use and land-use change but do not provide information on 
every specific area of the land territory (i.e. is not wall-to-wall spatially explicit). 
The two most common sampling methods applied are: 
• permanent sampling methods, where the same sample area is measured or analysed through time using 
consistent methods and processes; and, 
• temporary sampling methods, where data is collected for only one point in time or, if repeated measurements 
are taken through time, these are not taken for the same locations. 
Within these two broad methods there are a range of options countries can apply, including combining permanent 
and temporary sampling methods.  
Where permanent sample methods have been applied it is possible to use these data in an Approach 3 system by 
tracking each sample unit through time and determining the history and scaling appropriately. These units could 
also be used in an Approach 2 method by only determining land use and land use change between two consecutive 
periods. An example of Approach 3 sample based method for estimating land-use and land-use change can be 
found in Sweden’s national inventory report (Swedish Environmental Protection Agency 2016). 
Where only temporary sample units are used without repeat measurements, it is not possible to apply Approach 2 
or 3 methods unless temporary sample data is combined with other data (auxiliary data or permanent plots). 
A key issue when selecting a sampling design is that the sampling methods must be able to be applied over the 
whole area of interest and the sample size must be large enough to produce sufficiently accurate estimates of land-
use and land-use change categories and sub-divisions, given the policy requirement and the costs involved. No 
matter what type of sample method applied (ground or remote sensing), it is good practice to ensure: 
• a sufficient number of samples are used with repeat measurements over time to identify both land-use and land-
use changes with a desired level of uncertainty; 
• where samples are used to determine land cover, that these data are used with other information, if necessary, 
to identify the land-use category; 
• samples are collected or re-measured with sufficient temporal frequency to ensure land-use changes and 
management events affecting emissions and removals are identified; 
• samples are collected with sufficient temporal consistency that detection rates of change do not alter due to 
differences in sampling frequency;  
• where sampling methods have changed through time, these changes do not lead to inconsistencies in the 
reporting of areas of land-use and land-use change; and 
• the sample assessment protocols are well documented. 
Survey based methods 
Statistical survey methods involve obtaining information on land-use and land-use change and land management 
practices either through national programs or through targeted requests to land holders, land management agencies 
and companies.  
There are two broad methods for statistical surveys: 
• surveys that collect information on land management practices through time for a specific area or land use; 
and, 
• surveys that aim to collect information on land use and management practices in a specific period only, or only 
on land use without information on land management. 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
3.24 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Surveys can provide inventory compilers with access to lists of stands or land areas subject to different land-use 
and activities. These lists can provide detailed information on land areas and their management but may or may 
not include information on the exact location of the land unit. For example, within a region, information on the 
area, species, type and management of all forest areas (stands) may be available to the inventory compiler as a 
table, but the exact location of the stand is unavailable (e.g., due to privacy, commercial or political reasons). This 
data can be particularly accurate for land-uses with high-commercial value as detailed data is collected on these. 
However, these types of survey data do have temporal consistency and known geographic boundaries and can be 
considered Approach 2 or 3 depending on whether the land use changes are tracked across time or not. When using 
this method, it is good practice to: 
• ensure that the area of the land units surveyed is consistent with the area of the entire land use category and 
other land uses, in particular where the land units do not cover all the land-use categories (i.e., where a mix of 
Approaches are applied); and 
• where possible, compare the area estimates obtained from other methods, such as sample-based methods. 
Surveys that provide an estimate of the area of land use for a single point in time or where land use and activities 
cannot be assigned to any land unit only can be used to develop Approach 1 land representation. This data is often 
used in combination with other data to develop a complete land use estimate. An example of an Approach 3 survey 
based approach for estimating land-use and land-use change can be found in Canada’s national inventory report 
(Environment and Climate Change Canada 2018). 
3.3.4 
Combining Multiple Data Sources 
Remote sensing products are increasingly being used by countries as a source of information to estimate land-use 
and land-use change (GFOI 2016). The most common use of these products is to detect land cover and cover 
change. There are few cases where one single data source or method are used to develop area estimates for land-
use and land-use change for all strata, sub-strata and reporting categories. For instance, while remote sensing data 
is useful for identifying land cover and where a change in cover has occurred, the resulting products often do not 
provide information on the drivers that occurred to cause the change, the actual land uses and the likely associated 
emissions and removals. Combining remote sensing data products with other data sources is often required to 
obtain all the required information for estimating emissions and removals and to correctly allocate lands to the 
IPCC land-use categories over time. 
Typically, countries will combine a variety of different data sources and approaches to estimate areas of land-use. 
This could include multiple remote sensing products (including wall-to-wall and sampling approaches), census, 
survey, farmer interviews, field observations, expert knowledge, or some combination of these sources (Ogle et 
al. 2013; GFOI 2016). Combinations of data sources may also occur within a type of data. (e.g., national and 
regional or local statistics may be combined when national data is incomplete). These may occur for several 
reasons, including that the time-series is incomplete (i.e. some years are missing and are supplemented with other 
statistics), a land-use class or stratum is missing (e.g. sugarcane area is missing in the national cropland area 
statistics), more accurate statistics are available (e.g. from a different data provider). 
When combining different data types and sources it is good practice to: 
• report the spatial and temporal scales of the data sources;  
• ensure consistency between different temporal or spatial scales in the data sources; 
• verify spatial datasets conform to national mapping standards (e.g., appropriate equal area projections) to 
ensure accurate area calculations, and that raster and/or vector layers align and are within official national 
boundaries; 
• ensure that land conversion areas are consistent with each other across the entire time-series. For example, 
losses in the area of Forest Land categories are consistent with gains in the areas of Forest Land converted to 
Cropland, Grassland, Settlements, Wetlands, and Other Land; 
• ensure that the land conversion period is applied consistently across all land-use categories (i.e., that the same 
number of years is used before lands in a ‘converted to’ sub-category move to the ‘remaining’ sub-category); 
• establish a hierarchy among various data sources and proceed to their integration accordingly (i.e., higher 
quality data prevail to other data when an inconsistency appears among them); 
• fill data gaps to derive consistent time-series of land-use and land-use change (See Section 5.3, Chapter 5 
Volume 1); and, 
• report uncertainties of land-use and land-use change estimates. 
Chapter 3: Consistent Representation of Lands 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.25 
Spatially explicit approaches are commonly combined with other spatial data (e.g., forest and/or soil types, climate 
data) to produce emissions estimates. When using multiple spatial data layers, especially when combining vector 
and raster data sources of different spatial and temporal resolutions (Merchant & Narumalani 2009) it is good 
practice to ensure that: 
• all data layers are registered to a common projection, and that the layers align as far as possible, to prevent 
errors due to misalignment such as slivers or areas of false change along the edges of boundaries between 
different land-use categories; 
• reprojection of spatial data do not cause errors if applied correctly using appropriate type of projection for a 
given location (Seong 2003); 
• when combining data of different pixel sizes (e.g., climate data at 1km, with satellite land cover data at 25m) 
that the pixels align with ground coordinates; and, 
• if pixels are resampled (e.g., resampling of Landsat pixels from nominal 30 m to 25 m) this is done prior to 
classification. 
3.3.5 
Derivation of IPCC Land-Use Categories from Land 
Cover Information 
Inferring land use from land cover at a specific point in time can lead to misclassification of the predominant land-
use. It is good practice to clearly document the country-specific rules applied in the inventory to consistently 
derive land-use from land cover, both spatially and temporally, including predominance among land use categories. 
When deriving IPCC land-use and land-use change categories from land cover data, the following generic steps 
should be considered: 
• translate remote sensing data to land cover types using decision rules and image classification; 
• develop rules to translate land cover and cover change types to land-use and land-use change categories (i.e., 
attributing land cover information to land-use) using well-defined specific supplementary information 
• collect any required supplementary information and apply the developed rules. 
Existing national data 
Existing national data can be used for estimating land areas, alone or in combination with other data to derive 
IPCC land-use categories. Defining the equivalence between national land-use categories and IPCC land-use 
categories may not be straightforward, as national datasets are often developed for other purposes and do not 
necessarily match the IPCC definitions. For example, the definition of forest cover in some existing remote sensing 
products may differ from the nationally adopted definition for Forest Land. Even where the definitions are the 
same, existing forest type maps generally cannot compare to new remote sensing products due to differences in 
spectral and geometrical resolutions and the methods applied for land-use classification. This is particularly the 
case for older forest type maps derived from visual interpretation compared to semi-automated and automated 
methods. 
In developing IPCC land-use information, it is good practice to: 
• define the national land-use categories and develop rules to track them in the inventory, where needed; 
• describe how multiple data sources are combined to classify land-use and how the methods ensure consistent 
representation of lands; 
• demonstrate that the land-use categories definitions cover the entire variability of land-uses of the country 
territory, and do not overlap; 
• report an equivalence table between the categories used in the national land-use classification scheme and the 
IPCC land-use categories defined in Section 3.2, and 
• report which land cover elements and classification rules are used to identify land-use categories and 
attributions, including predominance among land uses. The applied classification rules need to be explained 
by reporting additional information used and any assumptions made to match land-use categories for the 
national classification system and the IPCC Guidelines discussed in this Chapter.  
Global datasets for land-use classification 
Accuracy of global products (Table 3.A.1.1) varies regionally due to factors including differential sensitivity of 
detection at biome and eco-regional scales, limited availability of regional data to calibrate algorithms and limited 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
3.26 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
validation of outputs. Furthermore, many global products only produce estimates of land cover not land-use, with 
definitions that may not match national country definitions. Because of these issues, using global maps for 
inventory reporting can lead to inconsistencies in data and tend to produce activity data estimates with lower 
accuracy and higher uncertainty than are attainable by national mapping (GFOI 2016). Conversely, national 
products can be tuned to national circumstances and land-use definitions using knowledge and auxiliary data 
available at the national/international level. Therefore, when using global data sets, it is good practice to:  
• assess the consistency of the global dataset with national definitions of land-use and suitability for reporting 
(e.g., time-series consistency, spatial scales, update processes); 
• assess the accuracy of the products for the mapped land-use categories and correct for bias by using ground or 
other reference data; and, 
• ensure that the accuracy assessment processes represent not just the IPCC land-use categories, but also the 
strata (e.g., by forest types, areas impacted by disturbances, soil classes) used to estimate emissions and 
removals. 
National assessment of the relative advantages of global and national maps to generate national level estimates of 
land-use and change are also related to: 1) preferences for national ownership of the process; 2) whether national 
mapping capacity already exists and 3) national needs for a land cover map (e.g. related to forest definition and 
land cover classifications, for integration with domestic planning). 
The relationship between global data and the national land-use definitions is important and in comparing national 
estimates and global products, it is good practice to: 
• ensure that products are applied to the same geographic extent and time period; 
• ensure that the land-use area and changes derived from the global data correspond as nearly as possible to the 
national definitions and legend; 
• use reference observations consistent with the national definition. If the reference data are stratified, e.g. by 
accessibility or biomass quantity, strata should be applied consistently over time irrespective of whether 
national or global map products are being used; and, 
• reduce common inconsistencies between global data and national definitions which are related to e.g. the 
minimum canopy cover thresholds, detailed consideration of land-use, the minimum size of land-use areas, and 
the minimum tree height. 
Addressing gaps in remote sensing data  
National inventories require annual estimates of emissions and removals and ideally, annual data would enable the 
generation of annual estimates of change for all land-uses. In practice, such data is not always available for all 
land-uses for every year and the cost of obtaining and processing the data may be too high. Consequently, inventory 
compilers will likely need to decide which data to collect, how frequently and to apply methods, such as splicing 
techniques, to cover these gaps. 
When covering data gaps from unavailable land-use and land cover data, it is good practice to: 
• define, document and report the years where remote sensing data are missing. When the number of years 
between data availability varies, demonstrate that the land-use change detected across the time series is 
consistent and not influenced by the change in frequency of observations; 
• justify the choice of the methods used to fill the data gap, and describe the method used for interpolation or 
extrapolation consistent with the guidance provided in Chapter 5, Volume 1. When using interpolation methods, 
if the land-use category on a sample unit or on a land use changes between consecutive inventories the year of 
conversion should be identified. If this is not possible a random year for the conversion should be selected.   
When extrapolating missing data based on trends and proxies, justify the length of the time-series used to 
develop the trend. Whenever possible use functional proxies (i.e. driver of changes) for extrapolation or 
interpolation; and 
• report the limitations and consequences of filling land cover data gaps with the chosen method. Whenever 
possible, estimate, document and report the uncertainty linked to the remote sensing annual data available and 
the uncertainty linked to the periods where this data is not available. 
Further, in the case of remote sensing data, some areas of land may not be covered with data in every period. This 
often occurs due to persistent cloud or haze, errors in the satellite or due to limited acquisitions in some areas. 
These areas are often removed from the analysis and classed as ‘no data’. Where wall-to-wall approaches are used, 
these gaps may lead to errors in the estimates of land-use and land-use change. This problem increases with 
Chapter 3: Consistent Representation of Lands 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.27 
increasing temporal density of the data. As such it is good practice to apply methods that can accurately fill these 
data gaps in a time-series consistent manner (See Annex 3A.2.4 for examples). 
3.3.6 
Stratification of land-use data 
Once land-use and land-use conversion areas have been established, it is necessary to consider the capacity and 
need for further stratification.  
Stratification is the process of disaggregating a land-use category (e.g. Forest Land, Cropland, Grassland) into 
logical, typically homogenous, sub-divisions (e.g. tropical/dry forest, crop types, improved or unimproved 
pastures). This process is commonly applied to reduce the uncertainty of emissions and removals estimates as it is 
useful to: 
• estimate emissions and removals for key land-use sub-categories; 
• enable tailoring of specific methods or data collection processes in different strata. For example, due to weather 
conditions and cloud effects, it is much more difficult to measure Forest Land converted to other land uses 
using multispectral remote sensing data in fragmented dryland forests than contiguous moist tropical forests; 
• track areas under conversion across time-series, especially to deal with subsequent changes; 
• assist in the management of uncertainties and plan continuous improvement of the inventory; 
• increase the flexibility in reporting of monitored data, such as the effectiveness of policies tailored to specific 
strata (e.g. forest types, risk types). 
Stratification may be needed to locate relevant data from subsequent chapters for emissions factors, carbon stocks, 
etc.  Table 3.1 shows the typical stratifications for which data are available for the application of Tier 1 emissions 
and removals estimation. Throughout the default tables used to populate equations to calculate a Tier 1 inventory, 
specific data cells are highlighted that represented the pre-defined stratifications applied to Tier 1 inventories. That 
is, Tier 1 default data (tables) conform to a consistent stratification so that there is no further calculation or 
ambiguity in the appropriate selection of default data to populate equations. Where countries are preparing Tiers 
2 and 3 inventories, it is likely that stratification schemes may differ based on country-specific information and 
selection, manipulation or supplementation of default data may be required. 
Common strata include layers such as soils, site class, topography, aspect, dominant tree species or species clusters 
are commonly used for stratification. However, unless all land-use area and stratification data are spatially-explicit 
(Approach 3), the development of rules for allocations to strata may be required. Table 3.6B provides some 
examples of possible data types and assumptions to stratify land-use and land cover.

To establish and report consistent land-use stratification scheme it is good practice to:  
• assess the availability of reliable data to classify land-use categories into sub-divisions that are available over 
time; 
• ensure that strata can be sufficiently distinct to be identifiable and establish clear definitions for land-use strata; 
• ensure that strata area cover the total land area of the category being stratified; as the boundaries of strata can 
change over time e.g. if the frontier of disturbance moves into areas of previously undisturbed forest. 
• ensure that the strata have the attributes required to develop estimates of emissions and removals (e.g., 
emissions factors or model parameters); and, 
• review the effect of the stratification to determine if further stratification would improve the estimates of 
emissions and removals.  
For example, Approach 1 land-use data are stratified by climate and soil type to estimate soil C stock changes.  
Optimally, the land-use data can be down-scaled to capture the proportion of land-uses in each climate or soil type, 
with   auxiliary information and expert knowledge. If re-scaling is not possible, inventory estimation can still 
proceed, but the emissions and removals estimates should reflect uncertainties in the assignment of emission/stock 
change factors (and associated parameters) that vary by climate and/or soil.  
Management data may only be available in an Approach 1 format (e.g., expert knowledge or periodic surveys of 
different sets of land owners) even if Approach 2 or 3 data are available for land-use categories. In this case, 
management can be summarized as a proportion of the management practice (e.g., % no till, intensive tillage and 
reduced tillage) in each “lands remaining” and “lands converted” land-use category. This will be a limiting 
Chapter 3: Consistent Representation of Lands 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.29 
assumption if the management classes are not evenly distributed as the impact of management on the emission or 
removal depends on land-use category.  
Tiers 2 and 3 methods may also evaluate interactions between management practices that affect emission/stock 
change factors. Determining the appropriate combinations of management is another issue that needs careful 
consideration.  Tier 1 methods typically do not address the temporal trends in emissions/stock change factors 
(assuming a linear change) or capture interactions among management practices on a specific land-use, but rather 
represent an average effect. Consequently, assignment of emission/stock change factors may become more 
complicated with higher Tier methods and require careful explanation of the scaling processes that were used to 
delineate the appropriate combinations of the climate, soil, ecological zones, and/or management systems. 
In some cases, management data may not cover the entire territory, being available only for specific regions, and 
so up-scaling of the data may be required to obtain national average coverage. A typical example is using project 
and activities data (e.g. mitigation actions/activities at the sub-national/corporate/project: see Box 2.0A, Chapter 
2, Volume 4) to derive extrapolation methods to transform local data into consistent national level data and report 
description of these methods. In other cases, statistical/auxiliary information may be available at the aggregated 
national level, so down-scaling of attributes may occur to assign management practices to particular land units.  
3.3.7 
Preparing area data for emissions and removals 
estimation 
Preparing a greenhouse gas inventory for AFOLU requires the integration of land-use area with data of land 
management and biomass, dead organic matter and soil carbon stock pools, in order to estimate carbon stock 
changes and CO2 and non-CO2 emissions and removals associated with land-use. Depending on the type of data 
available (Approach 1, 2 or 3), there are implications for the subsequent use of the data in the preparation of 
estimates of emissions and removals according to the land-use conversion framework represented in the reporting 
tables. 
Countries that only have access to Approach 1 data have two options for reporting land-use category conversions. 
Total areas for categories of “land remaining in a land-use” may include some portion of land that was converted 
to that land-use since the last inventory. Countries should wherever possible apportion change in land-use areas 
over time to inferred land-use conversion categories for the purposes of determining appropriate carbon stock and 
emission factor estimates. For example, a country with 1 Mha of forest, 1,000 ha deforestation and 1,000 ha 
afforestation has a zero net change in Forest Land area (presuming these changes occurred on managed land), but 
will have a reduction in forest biomass C stocks, at least until sufficient regrowth occurs. Subsequent decisions 
will be needed to relate these inferred area conversions between land-use categories to appropriate land 
management, biomass and soil C stocks and emission factors. Where this is done, countries should report the basis 
for these decisions, and any methods of verification or cross-checking of estimates that have been applied, and the 
effects on inventory uncertainty. If this apportioning is not done, then countries should state this, and report the 
effect on uncertainties associated with doing so.  
For countries with Approach 2 data, where information on the areas of each land-use conversion is known but is 
not spatially-explicit, these area estimates still need to be linked to appropriate initial carbon stocks, emissions 
factors, etc. In some cases, this may require the assignment of the land-use conversion data to climate, and/or 
vegetation type, soil and management strata. Again, this can be done by some form of sampling, scaling or expert 
judgement. Countries should report the basis for these decisions, and any methods of verification or cross-checking 
of estimates that have been applied. 
For countries using Approach 3 data, it is possible to apportion areas of land-use conversion by spatially 
intersecting the data with other spatial datasets, such as those on climate, and/or vegetation type, soil and 
management strata. However, it is likely that inference, for example, based on survey data and expert judgement, 
will be needed to apportion the land-use conversion and biophysical data by management practices as data on 
management practices are rarely available in spatially explicit formats.

MATCHING LAND AREAS WITH FACTORS 
FOR ESTIMATING GREENHOUSE GAS 
EMISSIONS AND REMOVALS 
This section provides brief guidance on matching the land-use area data with carbon stocks, emissions factors and 
other relevant data (e.g., forest biomass stocks, average annual net increment) to estimate greenhouse gas emissions 
and removals. An initial step in preparing national inventory estimates is to assemble the required activity data 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
3.30 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
(i.e., land-use areas) and match them with appropriate carbon stock, emissions and removal factors, Tier 3 models 
and other relevant data.  
This Volume provides default data (specifically marked) needed to make Tier 1 estimates for all AFOLU 
categories according to specified climate and ecological zone stratifications. In addition, countries may develop 
country-specific carbon stock, emission and removal factors and other relevant data (Tiers 2 and 3 inventory 
methods). The following summarizes the principles to be followed when matching activity data with carbon stock, 
emission and removal factors and other relevant data: 
• match national land-use area classifications to as many land-use categories as possible;  
• when national land-use classifications do not conform to the land-use categories of these guidelines, document 
the relationship between classification systems; 
• use classifications consistently through time and, when necessary, document any modifications made to 
classification system; 
• document definitions of land categories, land-use area estimates, and how they correspond to emission and 
removal factors; and,  
• match each land-use category or sub-category to the most suitable carbon stock estimates, emission and 
removal factors and other relevant data. 
Following are the recommended steps for matching land areas with emission and removal factors: 
1. Start with the most disaggregated land-use area stratification as well as the most detailed available emission 
and removal factors needed to make an estimate. For example, the Forest Land methodologies, described in 
Chapter 4 of this Volume, provide a default factor for above-ground biomass stocks in forest plantations that 
is disaggregated at the most detailed stratification, relative to other factors (i.e., forest type, region, species 
group, age class, and climate). These strata would be used as an initial base stratification. 
2. Include only those strata applicable in your country and use this as a base stratification. 
3. Match land-use area estimates to the base stratification at the most disaggregated level possible.  Countries 
may need to use expert judgment to align the best available land-use area estimates with the base stratification. 
4. Map emission and removal factors onto the base stratification by matching them as closely as possible to the 
stratification categories. Note that many of the default stock change and emissions factors and other parameters 
in Tier 1 (default) equations were statistically derived for specifically defined strata (e.g., climate type, soil 
type) so that countries wishing to use Tier 1 methods for these emissions and removals should stratify land-use 
categories using the definitions as specified for Tier 1 change factors and parameters. 
If a national land-use classification is fitted to the land-use categories (and sub-categories) this facilitates matching 
of emission and removal factors that follow the same classification. For example, default soil carbon factors for 
Forest Land, Cropland, and Grassland are disaggregated by the same climate regions (see Annex 3A.5). Therefore, 
the same land area classification can be used to estimate soil carbon changes in each of the land-use categories, 
enabling consistent tracking of lands and carbon fluxes on lands resulting from land-use category conversions. 
Countries may find that national land classifications change over time as national circumstances change and more 
detailed activity data and emission/removal factors become available. In some cases, the stratification will be 
elaborated with the addition of more detailed emission and removal factors. In other cases, new stratifications 
systems will be established when countries implement new forest inventories or remote sensing sampling designs.  
When changes to the stratification system occur, countries should recalculate the entire time-series of estimates 
using the new stratification if possible. 
3.4.1 
Use of different approaches and methodological Tiers 
when estimating emissions and removals due to land-
use change 
Emissions and removals of CO2 for the AFOLU sector are calculated from estimates of the total changes in carbon 
stocks for each land-use category. The overarching calculation process is described in Chapter 2, Volume 4.  
The change in carbon stocks can be estimated using emissions factors (Tier 1 and 2), models (Tier 3 gain-loss 
methods) or direct measurements (Tier 3 stock difference) or any logical and consistent combination of all three. 
As the different Approaches provide different levels of detail, the methods for estimating emissions and removals 
need to be tailored to the available land-use data. When considering how to apply methods for estimating GHG 
emissions and removals using activity data from different Approaches, it is important to differentiate between: 
Chapter 3: Consistent Representation of Lands 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.31 
• emissions and removals that occur in the year of the activity, such as fire or biomass loss from harvesting or 
clearing of land and emissions from drainage of organic soils and removals from forest growth; and, 
• lagged emissions/removals that may occur for years after an activity or change in land-use occurs, such as 
forest regrowth, decay/accumulation of soil organic matter or decay of carbon stock in forest products. 
As Approach 1 does not produce estimates for changes in land use, estimates for lagged emissions from carbon 
pools following transitions might produce emission and removals estimates that are different from those that can 
be calculated using Approach 2 or 3 (see Boxes 2.1 and 2.2). This limitation needs to be considered where 
Approach 1 data are being used in countries where land use change is occurring.  
Approach 2 data allow for the use of estimation methods that account for emissions and removals both in the year 
of the activity and also lagged emissions and removals from past activities. Approach 2 data can be used with any 
combination of Tier 1 and 2 emissions factors or Tier 3 models. Approach 2 does not allow for the tracking of 
multiple changes (>2) in land use on a single land unit through time. As such, when using Approach 2 methods it 
is good practice to stratify land into appropriate age or condition classes that can address these issues. For example, 
when using Tier 1 methods in forest land, stratifying into young forest land (less than 20 years) and mature forests 
(older than 20 years) can enhance the estimate of a land use change occurring in forest land. Similarly, a 
stratification into forest types or condition classes can enhance the accuracy of GHG estimates since the conversion 
of a mature forest typically results in higher C stock losses and associated GHG emissions than the conversion of 
a young, heavily disturbed or plantation forest. The same considerations apply to Approach 1 land representation. 
Approach 3 uses the time-series of data for land units to capture multiple changes in land-use increases the 
complexity of Tier 3 modelling systems for estimating emissions and removals. While it is possible to use different 
emissions estimation methods in spatially explicit approaches, it is important to ensure that all the estimation 
methods are applied consistently. For some carbon pools, such as biomass, using different methods and models 
for different land uses or sub-divisions of land use (e.g., forest type) will not create any inconsistencies even when 
land-use changes. However, other pools, in particular soil carbon, require that the estimation methods be consistent. 
For example, if two or more methods are used for estimating soil carbon changes for different land-uses, then the 
stocks and estimated stock changes need to be handled consistently when the land-use changes. Where multiple 
methods are applied for estimating changes in carbon stocks within and between land-uses it is good practice to 
describe how these models work consistently across land-uses. These issues are addressed in more depth in Chapter 
2.5, Volume 4. 
For Approach 3 gain-loss methods, the quantity of information on land-use and change through time often makes 
it difficult to use spreadsheets to calculate emissions and removals. Advanced methods using integrating tools 
(Brack et al. 2006; Kurz & Apps 2006) are typically used is such circumstances. These tools estimate emissions 
and removals for each uniquely identified land unit, assign the land unit to an IPCC land-use category then sum 
the results for reporting. 
Use of biomass maps with approach 3 data 
There is active research ongoing on methods to estimate biomass in tropical forests using remote sensing 
techniques, including analysis of spectral indices and use of SAR and lidar data. Information on the current state 
of biomass maps is provided in Chapter 2 Volume 4.  
The use of biomass maps needs to be considered in the context of the national inventory system to ensure that 
reporting of carbon stock changes for all pools and across land-uses is consistent. If biomass maps are used then 
it is good practice to demonstrate how the maps are consistent with national land-use classification system, in 
particular how they are integrated with the land-use data chosen by the country. 
3.5 
UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
APPROACHES 
Uncertainties should be quantified and reduced as far as practicable. Land-use area uncertainty estimates are 
required as an input to overall uncertainty analysis. Although the uncertainty associated with the Approaches (1 to 
3) obviously depends on how well they are implemented, it is possible to give an indication of what can be achieved 
in practice. Table 3.7 sets out the sources of uncertainty (not the significance) for different Approaches. This 
provides a guide to sources of uncertainties, indicative levels of uncertainty under certain conditions that might be 
encountered, and a basis for reducing uncertainties. 
The number of potential sources of uncertainty in area estimates will tend to increase from Approach 1 to Approach 
3, because successively more data are brought into the assessment. This does not imply that uncertainty increases, 
however, because of the additional cross-checks that are made possible by the new data, and because of the general 
reduction in uncertainties due to cancellation of errors. The main difference between Approach 1 and Approaches 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
3.32 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
2 and 3 is that percentage uncertainties on conversion between land-uses are likely to be greater in Approach 1 (if 
known at all). This is because in Approach 1 land-use conversions are derived from differences (net change) in 
total areas. The effect of this Approach 1 uncertainty on emissions and removals from conversions will depend on 
the relative amount of land conversion in the country as a fraction of total land area. Approach 3 produces detailed 
spatially-explicit information; which may be required e.g., for some spatial modelling approaches to emissions 
estimation.

Evaluation of land-use and land-use change information generated from remote 
sensing techniques and estimation of uncertainties  
Accuracy assessments on the land cover inputs can be useful in understanding the influence these inputs have on 
overall uncertainty, but alone such assessments are unlikely to be representative of the total uncertainty of the data 
used in estimating emissions and removals.  
When using remote sensing data to generate estimates of land use and land use change, it is good practice to ensure 
that:  
• uncertainty estimates are specific for the relevant land-use and land-use change categories, not for interim 
products;  
• uncertainty estimates include consideration of all sources of potential error 
• uncertainty assessment methods can be applied through the entire time-series, either as a single value or for set 
periods;  
Chapter 3: Consistent Representation of Lands 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.33 
• evaluation and uncertainty estimation methods are relevant to the Approach;  
• when using remote sensing data to assess accuracy, validation data of higher quality (e.g., greater spatial 
resolution or spectral range) are used; 
• analysis should be consistent with the discussion in Chapter 3 of Volume 1: Uncertainties.  
Collection of validation data  
Validation data (also called reference or accuracy assessment data) used in accuracy assessments can be collected 
using direct observations of ground conditions by field crews or from other remote sensing sources, such as high-
resolution satellite data or aerial imagery including drone surveys.  
Many biophysical features of interest can be collected on the ground to support the development and evaluation 
of land area estimates. However, ground measurements can be time consuming and expensive. Additionally, 
certain features are difficult to measure accurately from the ground but can be achieved relatively easily using 
high-resolution satellite data or aerial imagery. Also, it is important to consider spatial variability and plot size 
when ground information is used for validating pixel level data.    
Remote sensing data are typically available at lower cost, allowing for more samples to be collected rapidly and 
often are available for the entire time series to create a suitable validation dataset. Use of high-resolution remote 
sensing data can be cost effective to validate medium resolution remote sensing outputs. As such, many countries 
will use a combination of ground and remotely sensed reference data to make best use and advantage of each data 
source (GFOI 2016).  
It is good practice to ensure that validation data is:  
• of at least the same quality as the calibration data; 
• collected close to the time of the images used in the maps; and 
• of sufficient size and positional accuracy compared to the spatial resolution of the maps. 
When designing the validation sampling strategy countries may also consider assessing other spatial input data 
used to estimate emissions (e.g., underlying strata used in emissions estimation, such as soil type maps).   
Evaluation of sample-based method  
Remote sensing data can be used in a sample-based method. In these cases, the remote sensing data can often be 
treated in a similar manner to point based ground samples and uncertainties estimated using standard methods 
outlined in Chapter 3 of Volume 1: Uncertainties. However, unlike ground measurements, additional steps are 
often required to create land-use data as the remote sensing samples will represent land cover. As such, some of 
the methods used to develop wall-to-wall methods will be applicable for sample approaches as well.  
When using sample-based methods where the sample units are large (e.g., greater than 1km2) but the spatial 
assessment unit is small (e.g., a 30 m pixel), it may be appropriate to apply the same methods used to evaluate 
wall-to-wall methods to the sample unit to assess accuracy of the sample units themselves.  
Evaluation of wall-to-wall methods  
Wall-to-wall maps of land-use and land-use change data can be derived from remote sensing and other data. 
Multiple steps are required to develop time-series consistent maps of land-use and land-use change data; including 
but not limited to developing time-series consistent maps of land cover, attributing cover and cover changes to 
specific activities then applying country specific policy rules of assigning lands to an IPCC land-use category 
through time. 
Wall-to-wall mapping products are a form of census. Census approaches are subject to two types of error within 
each IPCC category: errors of inclusion (commission errors) and errors of exclusion (omission errors). Wall-to-
wall methods typically do not apply a sample-based estimator and therefore there is no estimate of bias. However, 
it cannot be assumed that wall-to-wall methods are free of bias, as errors will occur through all the processes of 
developing the land-use maps.  
Classification accuracy refers to the percentage of sample units correctly classified and can be calculated as 
commission and omission errors for each mapped category as well as an overall accuracy for all categories. 
Confusion or error matrices and map accuracy indices, can inform issues of systematic errors and precision in the 
maps, but do not produce the information necessary to construct confidence intervals (GFOI 2016). 
A statistical estimator corresponding to the sampling design (see Chapter 3 of Volume 1: Uncertainties) can be 
used to assess (and adjust for) bias and construct confidence intervals. 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
3.34 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
To assess map accuracy and create information that can be used for estimating the uncertainty of emissions and 
removals estimates it is good practice to collect and use validation data relevant to the estimation of emissions and 
removals, noting that:  
• the method and Tier adopted for generating emissions and removals estimates may influence how and when 
bias in activity data is addressed; and,  
• activity data accuracy needs to be assessed at the scale and for the strata used to develop the emissions and 
removals estimates otherwise the resulting emissions and removals estimates may still be biased. 
For transparency purposes it is good practice to clearly document the sampling methods (including sample sizes), 
how the samples relate to the classification system, and the QA/QC processes applied in sampling.

Annex 3A.2 
Development of land-use databases 
There are three broad sources of data for the land-use databases needed for greenhouse gas inventories:  
• databases prepared for other purposes;  
• collection by sampling; and 
• complete land inventory.  
The following subsections provide general advice on the use of these types of data. Greenhouse gas inventory 
preparers might not be involved in the detailed collection of remote sensing data or ground survey data but can 
use the guidance provided here to help plan inventory improvements and communicate with experts in these areas. 
3A.2.1 Use of data prepared for other purposes 
Two types of available databases may be used to classify land. In many countries, national datasets of the type 
discussed below will be available. Otherwise, inventory compilers may use international datasets. Both types of 
databases are described below. 
NATIONAL DATABASES 
These will usually be based on existing data, updated annually or periodically. Typical sources of data include 
forest inventories, agricultural census and other surveys, censuses for urban and natural land, land registry data 
and maps.  
INTERNATIONAL DATABASES  
Several projects have been undertaken to develop international land-use and land cover datasets at regional to 
global scales (Annex 3A.1 lists some of these datasets). Almost all of these datasets are stored as raster data 
generated using different kinds of satellite remote sensing imagery, complemented by ground reference data 
obtained by field survey or comparison with existing statistics/maps. These datasets can be used for: 
• Estimating spatial distribution of land-use categories. Conventional inventories usually provide only the total 
sum of land-use area by classes. Spatial distribution can be reconstructed using international land-use and land 
cover data as auxiliary data where national data are not available. 
• Reliability assessment of the existing land-use datasets. Comparison between independent national and 
international datasets can indicate apparent discrepancies and understanding these may increase confidence in 
national data and/or improve the usability of the international data, if required for purposes such as 
extrapolation. 
• When using an international dataset, inventory compilers should consider the following:  
(i) The classification scheme (e.g., definition of land-use classes and their relations) may differ from that 
in the national system. The equivalence between the classification systems used by the country and the 
systems described in Section 3.2 (Land-use categories) therefore needs to be established by contacting 
the international agency and comparing their definitions with those used nationally. 
(ii) Spatial resolution (typically 1km nominally but sometimes an order of magnitude more in practice) may 
be coarse, so national data may need aggregating to improve comparability. 
(iii) Classification accuracy and errors in geo-referencing may exist, though several accuracy tests are 
usually conducted at sample sites. The agencies responsible should have details on classification issues 
and tests undertaken. 
(iv) As with national data, interpolation or extrapolation will probably be needed to develop estimates for 
the time periods to match the dates required for reporting. 
3A.2.2 Collection of new data by sampling methods 
Sampling techniques for estimating areas and area changes are applied in situations where total tallies by direct 
measurements in the field or assessments by remote sensing techniques are not feasible or would provide 
inaccurate results. Sampling concepts that allow for estimation procedures that are consistent and unbiased, and 
result in estimates that are precise, should be used.  
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
3.38 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Sampling usually involves a set of sampling units that are located on a regular grid within the inventory area. A 
land-use class is then assigned to each sampling unit. Sampling units can be used to derive the proportions of land-
use categories within the inventory area. Multiplying the proportions by the total area provides estimates of the 
area of each land-use category. Where the total area is not known it is assumed that each sampling unit represents 
a specific area. The area of the land-use category can then be estimated via the number of sampling units that fall 
into this category. 
Where sampling for areas is repeated at successive occasions, area changes over time can be derived to construct 
land-use conversion matrices. 
Applying a sample-based type for area assessment enables the calculation of sampling errors and confidence 
intervals that quantify the reliability of the area estimates in each category. Confidence intervals can be used to 
verify if observed category area changes are statistically significant and reflect meaningful changes. 
Annex 3A.3 provides more information on sampling. 
3A.2.3 Collection of new data in complete inventories 
A complete inventory of land-use of all areas in a country will entail obtaining maps of land-use throughout the 
country at regular intervals. This can be achieved by using remote sensing techniques. As outlined under Approach 
3, the data will be most easily used in a GIS based on a set of grid cells or polygons supported by ground truth 
data needed to achieve unbiased interpretation. Coarser scale data can be used to build data for the whole country 
or appropriate regions. 
A complete inventory can also be achieved by surveying all landowners and each would need to provide suitable 
data where they own many different blocks of land. Inherent problems in the method include obtaining data at 
scales smaller than the size of the owner’s land as well as difficulties with ensuring complete coverage with no 
overlaps. 
3A.2.4 Tools for data collection  
REMOTE SENSING (RS) TECHNIQUES 
An increasingly remarkable array of remote sensing and other geospatial data, methods, and tools have become 
available in the last decade for consistent country-specific representation of land-use and land-use change. 
Advances in a) spatial and temporal higher coverage leading to increased availability of remotely sensed data 
routinely collected through earth observation satellites, b) time-series classification algorithms and related geodata 
processing workflows, and c) geographic information system (GIS)-based integration of in situ, collateral, and 
remote sensing data can be leveraged by inventory compilers for this purpose. Increased coordination and 
collaboration between the international space agencies such as NASA, JAXA, ESA, etc., have led to improved 
global remote sensing data collection and free availability and open access of high and moderate resolution datasets. 
Determination of fitness for use of remote sensing and other geospatial data, products, and tools is the 
responsibility of the user; the producer of remote sensing data on the other hand should provide the user with 
sufficient metadata to help make such a determination. The current geospatial metadata standard is based on ISO 
19115 which includes workflow provenance or lineage information. Provenance is vital to understand the exact 
sources, nature, and order of processing steps taken to generate a remote sensing product, and is required to 
understand how errors are expressed and propagated during the product’s creation (Tullis et al. 2015). Expertise 
in remote sensing systems and data processing (Jensen 2016) is necessary to interpret fitness for use in this context, 
and collaboration with a national or regional geospatial laboratory in the development of seamless remote sensing 
derived products is strongly encouraged. It should be noted that relevant remote sensing theory and applications 
have developed over more than a century (e.g., Thenkabail (2015); Jensen (2016)), and a detailed treatment cannot 
be replicated here. Instead, key aspects will be highlighted relative to the point of view of an inventory compiler. 
Determination of fitness for use may change over time as new sensors, methods, and workflows are developed and 
become available. This process is punctuated as earth observation satellites are decommissioned at their end of life 
and international investments are made in new launches with superior observation capacity. 
There is no a priori restriction on which remote sensing products may contribute to a consistent representation of 
lands, and no methodological requirement to maintain historical tradition. On the contrary, increased transparency, 
replicability, and accuracy in representation of land-use activity data benefits from the development of new and 
innovative geospatial workflows. Ensuring that land-use (of interest due to human activity) is consistently and 
accurately represented over time is more important than the specific methods that are ultimately selected. To aid 
compilers or reviewers in fitness for use determinations associated with remote sensing data and products, it is 
Chapter 3: Consistent Representation of Lands 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.39 
suggested that remote sensing resolutions, time-series consistency, compatibility with forest and other land-use 
definitions, and attribution of land-use change all be considered. 
Remotely sensed data, as discussed here, are those acquired using sensors (e.g., optical, radar or lidar) on board 
satellites, or airborne. Before these data can be effectively used to generate land-use activity data, various forms 
of calibration and harmonization may be required. Classification can be accomplished either through expert visual 
interpretation of the remotely sensed imagery, or by digital methods, or by some combination of the two. Some 
remote sensing approaches produce reliable sample datasets while others generate wall-to-wall maps for each 
epoch in the time-series of interest. Reliable reference data samples including (where possible) in situ or ground 
survey data is utilized to both improve land-use products (e.g., to refine area estimates) as well as to estimate 
accuracy of products incorporated in subsequent stages of the inventory process. 
The strengths of remote sensing come from its ability to provide spatially explicit information for land 
representation and repeated coverage, including the possibility of covering large and/or remote areas that are 
difficult to access in situ. Archives of remote sensing data also span several decades and can therefore be used to 
reconstruct historical time-series of land-use information. Remote sensing is particularly useful for obtaining area 
estimates of land-use categories and for assisting in the identification of relatively homogeneous strata that can 
guide the selection of sampling schemes and the number of samples to be collected. The challenges of remote 
sensing are related to interpretation: the images need to be consistently and reliably translated into meaningful 
information on land-use. Depending on the satellite sensor(s) involved, the data acquisition may be impaired by 
the presence of atmospheric clouds, smoke and haze. Another concern, particularly when comparing data over 
long time periods, is that remote sensing quality and resolutions may change over time. Further guidance is 
provided to address these challenges in the context of common remote sensing definitions, state of the art methods 
and approaches, and future possibilities particularly relevant to inventory compilers. 
Remote sensing resolutions 
Spatial 
Spatial resolution refers to the approximate ground-projected dimensions of remotely sensed image pixels. Landsat 
8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), for example, has a spatial resolution of 30 m, while the Sentinel 2 multispectral 
instrument has higher spatial resolutions of 10 m and 20 m, depending on the band. In choosing appropriate spatial 
resolution for land representation, it is critical to consider the minimum mapping unit (MMU), the smallest size 
which determines whether a feature is captured from a remotely sensed image. Pixel area and detectability are two 
important factors in assessing MMU suitability. A commonly accepted criterion is that the pixel area should not 
exceed 1/4 MMU. For example, if MMU is 0.5 ha (5,000 m2) then Landsat data at 30 m spatial resolution (900 m2 
pixel area) would meet the MMU criteria as there will be at least 5 Landsat pixels within the MMU. In contrast, 
using MODIS sensor data at 250m pixel (62,500 m2 pixel area) would fail the MMU criteria as the area covered 
by a single pixel is greater than the MMU. Spatial resolution is generally inversely related to spatial coverage; 
higher spatial resolution sensors cover smaller areas and vice versa. This relationship has direct implications for 
required processing time and expertise required and thus influences the total cost of the inventory. 
Spectral 
Spectral resolution describes the ability of a sensor to define wavelength intervals. As spectral resolution increases, 
there is a greater number of possible channels or bands, and corresponding wavelength ranges for those bands are 
narrower. Often a specific sensor’s spectral resolution is fixed and thus its potential applications are limited. In 
general, the higher the spectral resolution, the greater the ability of the sensor to separate different variables and 
to detect change. However, narrow wavelength ranges mean that less electromagnetic energy is available to 
impinge upon the detectors, which can decrease signal to noise ratio (SNR). Given this principle, many of the 
higher spatial resolution commercial satellites have relatively lower spectral resolutions. In general, there should 
be a good balance between the amount of spectral bands and the spatial resolution depending on the application. 
Temporal 
Temporal resolution refers to the length of time required for a satellite to revisit a land area of interest. Temporal 
resolution is related to image coverage and spatial resolution; i.e., sensors that cover the Earth more frequently, on 
the order of a day (e.g., MODIS) or 16 days (e.g., Landsat 8), have higher coverage and lower spatial resolution. 
However, this is changing with recent and planned satellite constellations (e.g., small satellites from Planet; 
RADARSAT Constellation Mission, etc.). Due to some degree of overlap in the imaging swaths of adjacent orbits 
and an increase in this overlap with latitude, some areas of the Earth tend to be re-imaged more frequently. Also, 
some satellite systems can point off-nadir to image the same area between different satellite passes separated by 
periods from one to five days. Adequate temporal resolution is critical for the development of image time-series 
that contain information relevant to human activity. 
 
 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
3.40 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Radiometric 
Radiometric resolution is related to the sensitivity of the detector elements in a sensor. In general, higher 
radiometric sensitivity leads to better discrimination of land cover and ultimately land use. Due to introduction of 
noise from a variety of sources, consistent sensor radiometric resolution may be somewhat less than the bit-depth 
reported in sensor specifications and may vary between bands due in part to the limitations of wavelength-
dependent irradiance and atmospheric transmittance. Noticeable improvements in radiometric resolution and in its 
reliability, has been observed in recent years as a function of sensor technology, such as the increase from the 8-
bit specification in Landsat 5 TM, 12-bits in Landsat 8 OLI, and 14-bits in Landsat 9 OLI-2 (planned for launch 
in 2020). 
Types of remote sensing data 
Commonly used types of remote sensing data are: 1) aerial imagery, 2) satellite imagery using visible and/or 
infrared bands, 3) satellite or airborne radar imagery and, 4) satellite or airborne lidar data. Combinations of 
different types of remote sensing data (e.g., visible/infrared and radar; different spatial or spectral resolutions) 
might very well be used for assessing different land-use categories or regions. A complete remote sensing system 
for tracking land-use conversions can include multiple sensor and data type combinations at a variety of resolutions, 
with appropriate processing methods to ensure sensor system-related variables do not introduce classification 
errors. 
Important criteria for selecting remote sensing data and products are: 
• Adequate land-use categorisation scheme; 
• Appropriate spatial resolution and image extent;  
• Appropriate temporal resolution for estimating of land-use conversion; 
• Capability to perform accuracy assessment; 
• Transparent methods applied in data acquisition and processing; and 
• Consistency and availability over time. 
1. Aerial photographs 
Analysis of aerial photographs and most recently very high-resolution digital air photos can reveal forest tree 
species and forest structure from which relative age distribution and tree health (e.g., needle loss in coniferous 
forests, leaf loss and stress in deciduous forests) may be inferred. In agriculture, analysis can show crop species, 
crop stress, and tree cover in agro-forestry systems. The smallest spatial unit possible to assess depends on the 
type of aerial photos used, but for standard products it is often as small as 1 square meter.  
2. Satellite images in visible and near infrared wavelengths 
Complete land-use or land cover of large areas (national or regional) may be facilitated by the use of satellite 
images. The possibility exists of obtaining long time-series of data from the desired area since the satellite 
continuously and regularly passes over it. The images usually generate a detailed mosaic of distinct categories, but 
the labelling into proper land cover and land-use categories commonly requires ground reference data from maps 
or field surveys. The smallest unit to be identified depends on the spatial resolution of the sensor and the scale of 
work. The most common multispectral sensor systems used for regional to national land cover and land-use 
mapping have a spatial resolution of 10 – 30 meters. At a spatial resolution of 30 meters, for example, units as 
small as 1 ha can be identified. Data from higher spatial resolution satellites are now also widely available (e.g., 
ESA Sentinel-2). 
3. Radar imagery 
The most common type of radar data is from the so-called Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems that operate 
at microwave frequencies. A major advantage of such systems is that they can penetrate clouds and haze and 
acquire data during night-time. They may therefore be the only reliable source of remote sensing data in many 
areas of the world with quasi-permanent cloud cover. By using different wavelengths and different polarisations, 
SAR systems may be able to distinguish land cover categories (e.g., forest/non-forest), or the biomass content of 
vegetation, although there are at present some limitations at high biomass due to signal saturation. Reports from 
Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (2010; 2011; 2014) provide detailed examples of orbital SAR data analysis 
in support of forest and wetland monitoring. 
4. Lidar  
Like SAR, light detection and ranging (lidar) is an active sensor technology (transmits and later detects its own 
energy). Laser light at a specific wavelength (e.g., 532 nm, 1,064 nm) is transmitted to the surface and some portion 
is reflected/scattered back to the instrument. However, in contrast to SAR, lidar is used mostly to determine the 
Chapter 3: Consistent Representation of Lands 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.41 
distance to and position of the reflective surface from the precise time and angles the pulse takes to return to the 
sensor. By using stream of pulses transmitted across the surface, the relative elevation of each reflecting target can 
be derived, producing a 3-dimensional (3D) point cloud that can be analysed for surface elevation and vegetation 
structure as well as composition. In addition, although currently less commonly implemented, the intensity of 
reflected energy can be used to evaluate properties of the reflected surface. Lidar generally has a narrow swath 
width, particularly with airborne systems which generate the most precise and detailed data. It therefore requires 
significant time and expense to acquire full coverage of large areas. In dynamic landscapes where, higher temporal 
resolution is needed, such data are best suited for high spatial resolution sample-based analysis. 
Remote sensing data pre-processing 
Imagery captured by airborne or spaceborne sensors must be corrected for radiometric, geometric and topographic 
distortions prior to using this data for land cover and land-use classification. The type of pre-processing depends 
on type of sensor system such as optical or radar. A detailed description of pre-processing methods can be found 
in Jensen (2016) and Richards (2013). Availability of seamless radiometrically corrected data in recent years has 
made it much easier to use this data for land cover and land-use change detection (Roy et al. 2010; Hansen & 
Loveland 2012; Hansen et al. 2013; Teillet 2015). Optical imagery might be affected by cloud cover, which can 
be removed by combining data from multiple images acquired in the same season. Ubiquitous cloud cover can 
benefit from recent advances (e.g., Fmask; see Zhu et al. 2015). GFOI (2016) provides detailed guidance on cloud 
removal including the effects of shadows.  
Development of country-specific remote sensing pre-processing capabilities may not always be practical. 
Fortunately, major remote sensing data suppliers such as US Geological Survey (USGS), European Space Agency 
(ESA), Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), and others are increasingly offering analysis ready data 
(ARD), which is most suitable for extraction of land-use categories required for national GHG inventories. For 
example, USGS (2017) is beginning to offer Landsat ARD using harmonized collections from Landsat 4, 5, 7, and 
8 between 1982 and the present. When using global or country-specific georeferenced datasets, it is good practice 
to ensure they meet national geodetic mapping standards. 
Time-series consistency 
Methodological changes and improvements in satellite data processing and calibration over time is a normal 
practice and often result in improved products for change detection. It is also common to source data from multiple 
sources and sensors, which, if not accounted properly, may result in inconsistent products that are unsuitable for 
detecting land use change. It is therefore good practice to reprocess time-series data when new data or methods 
become available such as those identified below: 
• Availability of improved ground control points (GCPs). For example, when using Landsat data from the USGS, 
it is important to use data from the same collection and tier for the entire time series. Combining data from 
different tiers may result in misregistration;  
• Availability of improved calibration or recalibration of sensors in response to degradation of sensor 
performance over time; 
• Availability of new data and processing methods such as Data Cube (CEOS 2016; Lewis et al. 2017); and 
cloud-based data processing platforms (FAO 2018); 
• Correction of errors. 
There are many new sensors and types of remote sensing data available in recent years to assess land cover and 
land-use changes. Using data from multiple sensors and sources, which is increasingly common, requires 
consistent processing of time-series remote sensing data following the principles discussed in Chapter 5 of Volume 
1: Time-Series Consistency. Summary of splicing techniques applicable to remote sensing data processing are: 
• Overlap techniques can be used when a new higher resolution sensor data becomes available in recent years, 
but such data are not available in the past. In such cases, data from old and new sensors can be compared for 
at least one year (preferably more) to establish a consistent relationship between the two products. This 
technique can be used, for example, to construct a consistent time-series using historic Landsat sensors and the 
more recent Sentinel-2 sensors (Zhang et al. 2018). 
• Interpolation techniques can be used where availability of remote sensing data from historic archives is limited. 
In such cases best available data for intermittent years in the time-series can be interpolated to fill gaps in the 
missing data.  
Other techniques such as merging of different spatial resolution data can be used to fill the data gaps. Pixel 
compositing is also another proven technique to construct best quality cloud free composites for classification. It 
is important to collect remote sensing data obtained in the same season throughout the time-series to minimise 
errors due to seasonal changes.

3.42 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Ground reference data 
To make use of remote sensing data for inventories, and in particular to relate land cover to land-use it is good 
practice to complement remote sensing data with in situ or ground reference data (often mistakenly called ground 
“truth” data even though it may also contain sources of error). Ground reference data can either be collected 
independently or obtained from forest or agricultural inventories. Land-uses that are rapidly changing over the 
estimation period or that have vegetation cover known to be easily misclassified should be more intensively ground 
sampled than other areas. This can typically only be done by using ground reference data, preferably from field 
surveys collected independently. High spatial resolution imagery obtained from aerial/drone or orbiting satellites 
may also be useful for reference and verification purposes. 
Integration of remote sensing and geographical information systems 
Visual interpretation of images is often used for identifying sampling sites for forestry inventories. The method is 
simple, and reliable. However, it is labour intensive and therefore restricted to limited areas and may be affected 
by subjective interpretations by different operators. 
Effective use of remote sensing data generally requires integration of the extensive coverage that remote sensing 
can provide with ground-based measurements or map data to represent areas associated with particular land uses 
in space and time. This is generally achieved most cost effectively using a geographic information system (GIS). 
Use of a GIS is the most common approach to combine multiple data sources including field measurements, survey 
and census data. This information is essential to train image classification or machine learning algorithms used for 
extracting land cover and land-use change. A number of important factors should be considered when combining 
multiple data sources as discussed in Section 3.3.4.  
Land-Use classification using remote sensing data 
Classification of land cover using remotely sensed data may be done by visual or digital (computer based) analysis. 
Each approach presents advantages and disadvantages. Visual analysis of imagery allows for human inference 
through the evaluation of overall characteristics of the scene (analysis of the contextual aspects in the image). 
Digital classification, on the other hand, allows several manipulations to be performed with the data, such as 
merging of different spectral data, which can help to improve modelling of the biophysical ground data (such as 
tree diameter, height, basal area, biomass) using the remotely sensed data. In addition, digital analysis allows for 
the immediate computation of areas associated with the different land categories. It has developed rapidly in recent 
decades, along with the associated technical computer development, making hardware, software and satellite data 
readily available at low cost in most countries. Capacity to use these data and facilities may have to be outsourced 
(e.g., using cloud-based computing platforms), particularly in mapping at the national level. 
There has also been extensive research on the best methods for image classification and as a result a wide variety 
of choices are available. Common image classification and machine learning algorithms include maximum 
likelihood, decision trees (e.g., random forest), support vector machines and neural networks. Many of these are 
available in standard image processing and statistical software packages (Jensen 2016). 
Image classification begins with the definition of the categories or classes to be included in the map. In supervised 
classification, it is necessary to provide training samples of each of the classes to be included. These samples could 
come from a variety of sources, including sample sites from a national forest inventory, or could be obtained from 
high spatial resolution images (GFOI 2016). Often images from a single date are used for image classification. 
However, multiple images from different seasons can also be used in image classification to try to capture classes 
with seasonal dynamics. Multi-season satellite data is particularly useful for mapping croplands, grasslands and 
fallow lands. As the level of stratification increases, alternative sources of reference data to train classifiers will 
be needed, such as prior vegetation maps or field plots.  
Extraction of information from satellite images can also be done by visual interpretation. This is best done by a 
subject matter expert familiar with the area being interpreted. However, this method can be very human resource 
intensive (GOFC-GOLD 2016) because the number of pixels may be very large, and the interpretations can largely 
vary due to human judgement, since it is hard to maintain consistency and repeatability between interpreters. 
Moreover, the minimum mapping unit for land classification is often less than 5 ha, which can be tedious to 
implement using visual interpretation. Further, differencing visually interpreted maps to develop change estimates 
by polygon overlay analysis typically results in gaps between polygons. It is also very difficult to make 
improvements to the resulting maps, especially once the time-series includes more than 3 or 4 epochs.  
This may be overcome by applying image classification algorithms to give consistent results in allocating a pixel 
to a category or another, or to segment the data. Unsupervised approaches use classification algorithms to assign 
image pixels into one of many unlabelled class groupings. Expert image interpreters then assign each of the 
groupings of pixels a value corresponding to the desired land class. Supervised approaches use ground reference 
data or expert knowledge of the region to train the classification algorithms which then identify and label areas 
similar to the input training data. The approaches have different challenges which are best addressed by iterative 
Chapter 3: Consistent Representation of Lands 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.43 
trials: supervised classification may wish to use more classes than are statistically separable; unsupervised methods 
may generate fewer classes than are desired and a given cover type may be split between several groupings. In 
both cases data analysts can check the accuracy of classification outputs.  
Rarely does the first attempt at image classification result in the final product. Close examination of the 
classification results often reveals issues and problems that can be resolved by changing or refining training data 
in the classification process. There are many ways to try to improve the results of a classification with noticeable 
problems, including the addition of more or improved training data. It may also be helpful to include additional 
kinds of data in the classification, such as topographic or climatic data (GFOI 2016). Any improvements in data 
processing methods should be reflected in the entire time-series to improve the accuracy and consistency of output 
data.  
While two dates of satellite imagery may be useful for quickly depicting land cover change, identification of 
permanent land-use changes may require more data and analysis. It is therefore good practice to ensure that all 
land cover changes identified by satellite data are verified using sufficient spatial and temporal resolution imagery, 
ground reference and other auxiliary datasets to isolate permanent land-use change from that of temporary loss of 
forest cover. This process, referred as attribution of satellite derived land cover change, helps to identify human 
induced land-use change. Typical data sets used in attribution include those with information relating to fires, 
forest management areas, agricultural areas, road coverage and urban areas (Mascorro et al. 2015). As data 
processing algorithms detect increasingly diverse change processes, the need to distinguish among the agents 
causing the change becomes critical. Not only do different change types have different impacts on natural and 
anthropogenic systems, they also provide insight into the overall processes controlling landscape condition. 
Reaching this goal requires overcoming two central challenges. The first is related to scale mismatch: change 
detection in digital images occurs at the level of individual pixels but change processes in the real world operate 
on areas larger or smaller than pixels, depending on the process. The second is related to separability: change 
agents are defined by natural and anthropogenic factors that have no connection with the spectral space on which 
the change is initially detected. Different change agents may have nearly identical spectral signatures of change at 
the pixel and even the patch level, and must be distinguished by factors completely outside the realm of remote 
sensing (Kennedy et al. 2007).  
Detection of land-use conversion using remote sensing 
Remote sensing can be used to detect locations of change. Methods for change detection can be divided into two 
categories (Singh, 1989): 
Post-classification change detection: This refers to techniques where two or more predefined land cover/use 
classifications exist from different points in time, and where the changes are detected, usually by subtraction of 
the datasets. The techniques are straightforward but are also sensitive to inconsistencies in interpretation and 
classification of the land-use categories.  
Pre-classification change detection: This refers to more sophisticated and biophysical approaches to change 
detection. Differences between spectral response data from two or more points in time are compared by statistical 
methods and these differences are used to provide information on land cover/use changes. This type is less sensitive 
to interpretation inconsistencies and can detect much more subtle changes than the post-classification approaches 
but is less straightforward and requires access to the original remotely sensed data. 
There are also other viable methods. For example, one can use change enhancements and visual interpretation.  
Areas of change are highlighted through display of different band combinations, band differences or derived 
indices (e.g., vegetation indices). This focuses attention on potential land-use conversions sites that can then be 
delineated and attributed through manual or automated techniques. These methods are subject to human interpreter 
inconsistencies but are capable of detecting subtle changes and better detecting and mapping land-use conversion 
where land cover, context and auxiliary information is needed to determine land-use conversion. 
Change detection is one of the most common uses of remote sensing data, and many methods have been used, 
tested and proposed in the literature. GOFC-GOLD (2016) includes descriptions and examples of several change 
detection methods and is a useful resource when considering options for combinations of methods and remote 
sensing data to be used for mapping change. In general, at least two dates of images (end-points) are necessary to 
map change. Image classification methods are commonly used, in which case multiple images are used to make 
the assignment to stable classes (places that have not changed) as well as change classes, such as Forest Land to 
Grassland (Woodcock et al. 2001). Such methods use the change in a spectral bands or indices as the basis for 
detecting change land cover (Lambin & Strahlers 1994; Coppin et al. 2004).  
Time-series classification 
Data processing methods that use many images, or a time-series of images, have been developed and tested (Chen 
et al. 2004; Kennedy et al. 2007; Furby et al. 2008; Zhuravleva et al. 2013). These approaches have many 
advantages, as they are not so dependent on the conditions at the time the individual images were collected. Use 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
3.44 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
of a time-series of images can help avoid some kinds of errors in the monitoring of forest change (GFOI 2016). 
For example, classification of time-series data can help make the distinction between permanent land-use change 
and temporary loss of forest due to harvesting. 
Change detection using two images has some advantages but also has some limitations (Jensen 2016). Direct 
mapping of change categories has important benefits. The Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial 
Research Organization (CSIRO) National Inventory System – Land Cover Change Project (NIS-LCCP) provides 
an example of how change can be confirmed from time-series information (Shimabukuro et al. 1998; Caccetta et 
al. 2007; Potapov et al. 2012; Hansen et al. 2013). 
Emerging remote sensing-derived land surface phenology (Morisette et al. 2009) represents a future opportunity 
for innovation in national inventories. Land surface phenology not only supports the extraction of land cover  
classes (e.g., Zhong et al. 2012), but offers valuable information on homogeneous landscape units (e.g., Bunker et 
al. 2016). Areas with unique forest and agricultural cycles characterized by both natural and anthropogenic 
influence may be difficult to ascertain with only a few representative images from a time-series. For example, even 
relatively coarse spatial resolution homogenous landscape units extracted from a relatively dense time-series (e.g., 
from bi-monthly MODIS-derived vegetation index) may support adaptive land-use extraction methodologies (e.g., 
based on finer spatial resolution Landsat-derived time-series) within entire countries or regions. 
Analysis of dense time-series remote sensing data can help in identifying forest disturbance events such as extent, 
type and year of disturbance, status of pre and post-disturbance land cover, disturbance intensity and rates of 
recovery (White et al. 2017). 
Evaluation of mapping accuracy 
Whenever a map of land cover or land-use is being used, inventory compilers should acquire information about 
the reliability of the map. When such maps are generated from classification of remote sensing data, it should be 
recognised that the reliability of the map is likely to vary between the different land categories. Some categories 
may be uniquely distinguished while others may be confounded with others. For example, coniferous forest is 
often more accurately classified than deciduous forest because its reflectance characteristics are more distinct, 
while deciduous forest may easily be confounded with, for example, Grassland or Cropland. Similarly, it is often 
difficult to ascertain changes in land management practices through remote sensing. For example, it may be 
difficult to detect a change from intensive to reduced tillage on a specific land area. 
Inventory compilers should estimate the accuracy of land-use/land cover maps on a category-by-category basis. A 
number of sample points on the map and their corresponding real-world categories are used to create a confusion 
matrix (see footnote 5 in Annex 3A.4) with the diagonal showing the proportion of correct identification and the 
off-diagonal elements showing the relative proportion of misclassification of a land category into one of the other 
possible categories. The confusion matrix expresses not only the accuracy of the map but it is also possible to 
assess which categories are easily confounded with each other. Based on the confusion matrix, a number of 
accuracy indices can be derived (Congalton, 1991). Multi-temporal analysis (analysis of images taken at different 
times to determine the stability of land-use classification) can also be used to improve classification accuracy, 
particularly in cases where ground truth data are limited. 
GROUND-BASED SURVEYS 
Ground-based surveys may be used to gather and record information on land-use, and for use as independent 
ground-truth data for remote sensing classification. Prior to the advent of remote sensing techniques such as aerial 
photography and satellite imagery, ground-based surveys were the only means of generating maps. The process is 
essentially one of visiting the area under study and recording visible and/or other physical attributes of the 
landscape for mapping purposes. Digitisation of boundaries and symbolising attributes are used to make hard copy 
field notes and historical maps useful in Geographical Information Systems (GIS). This is done via protocols on 
minimum land area delineation and attribute categorization that are linked to the scale of the resultant map and its 
intended use. 
Very precise measurements of area and location can be made using a combination of survey equipment such as 
theodolites, tape measures, distance wheels and electronic distance measuring devices. Development of satellite 
navigation systems means that location information can be recorded in the field directly into electronic format 
using portable computer devices. Data are downloaded to an office computer for registration and coordination with 
other layers of information for spatial analysis. 
Landowner interviews and questionnaires are used to collect socio-economic and land management information 
but may also provide data on land-use and land-use conversion. With this census type, the data collection agency 
depends on the knowledge and records of landowners (or users) to provide reliable data. Typically, the resident is 
visited and interviewed by a representative of the collection agency and data are recorded in a predetermined 
format, or a questionnaire is issued to the land-user for completion. The respondent is usually encouraged to use 
Chapter 3: Consistent Representation of Lands 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.45 
any relevant records or maps they may have, but questions may also be used to elicit information directly (Swanson 
et al. 1997). 
Census surveys are probably the oldest form of data collection methods (Darby, 1970). Land-user surveys can be 
conducted on the entire population or a sample of suitable size. Modern applications employ a full range of 
validation and accuracy assessment techniques. The survey may be undertaken through personal visits, telephone 
interviews (often with computer-assisted prompts) or mail-out questionnaires. Land-user surveys start with the 
formulation of data and information needs into a series of simple and clear questions soliciting concise and 
unequivocal responses. The questions are tested on a sample of the population in order to ensure that they are 
understandable and to identify any local technical terminology variations. For sample applications, the entire study 
area is spatially stratified by appropriate ecological and/or administrative land units, and by significant categorical 
differences within the population (e.g., private versus corporate, large versus small, pulp versus lumber, etc.). For 
responses dealing with land areas and management practices, some geographic location, whether precise 
coordinates, cadastral description or at least ecological or administrative units should be required of the respondent. 
Post-survey validation of results is conducted by searching for statistical anomalies, comparing with independent 
data sources, conducting a sample of follow-up verification questionnaires or conducting a sample of on-site 
verification surveys. Finally, presentation of results must follow the initial stratification parameters.

Default climate and soil classifications 
Climate regions are classified in order to apply emission and stock change factors for estimating biomass, dead 
organic matter and soil C stock changes.  The default climate classification, provided in Figure 3A.5.1 (updated), 
has been derived using the classification scheme shown in Figure 3A.5.2 based on the gridded Climate Research 
Unit (CRU) Time Series (TS) monthly climate data for the period from 1985 to 2015 following the methodology 
described by Harris et al. 2014. This classification should be used for Tier 1 methods because the default emission 
and stock change factors were derived using this scheme. Note that climate regions are further subdivided into 
ecological zones to apply the Tier 1 method for estimating biomass C stock changes (see Table 4.1, Chapter 4).  
Inventory compilers have the option of developing a country-specific climate classification based on local climate 
data, updated annually, if using Tier 2 and 3 methods, along with country-specific emission and stock change 
factors. It is good practice to apply the same classification, either default or country-specific, across all land-use 
types.  Thus, stock change and emission factors are assigned to each pool in a national inventory using a uniform 
classification of climate.  
Soils are classified in order to apply reference C stocks and stock change factors for estimation of soil C stock 
changes, as well as the soil N2O emissions (i.e., organic soils must be classified to estimate N2O emissions 
following drainage).  Organic soils are found in wetlands or have been drained and converted to other land-use 
types (e.g., Forest Land, Cropland, Grassland, Settlements). Soils having organic material (Histosols) are defined 
as (WRB, 2015): 
1. Starting at the soil surface and having a thickness of ≥ 10 cm and directly overlying: 
a. Ice, or 
b. Continuous rock or technic hard material, or 
c. Coarse fragments, the interstices of which are filled with organic material; or 
2. Starting ≤ 40 cm from the soil surface and having within ≤ 100 cm of the soil surface a combined thickness 
of either: 
a. ≥ 60 cm, if ≥ 75% (by volume) of the material consists of moss fibres; or 
b. ≥ 40 cm in other materials 
All other types of soils are classified as mineral. A default mineral soil classification is provided in Figure 3A.5.3 
for categorizing soil types based on the USDA taxonomy (USDA, 1999) and Figure 3A.5.4 for the World 
Reference Base for Soil Resources Classification (FAO, 1998) (Note: Both classifications produce the same 
default IPCC soil types). The default mineral soil classification should be used with Tier 1 methods because default

reference C stock and stock change factors were derived according to these soil types. Inventory compilers have 
the option of developing a country-specific classification for mineral and/or organic if applying Tiers 2 and 3 
methods, in combination with developing country-specific reference C stocks and stock change factors (or 
emission factors in the case of organic soils). It is good practice to use the same classification of soils across all 
land-use types.

Annex 3A.6 
Example process for allocating lands to IPCC 
land-use classes using Approach 3 wall-to-wall 
methods. 
Figure 3A.6.1 shows a decision tree for allocating lands to the IPCC land-use categories when using Approach 3 
wall-to-wall methods (i.e., where every land unit is assumed to have information on land cover over time). This 
method may also be applicable for some sample-based methods. The process is applied to each area of land (e.g., 
per pixel or vector unit) for each year of the inventory. The process uses three key types of information: land cover 
and cover change, auxiliary data and reporting rules. This approach is highly flexible and allows for numerous 
iterations depending on country circumstance.  
Land cover and cover change data are typically obtained from mapping such as from remote sensing (see Appendix 
3Ap.2.4). Auxiliary information comprises maps or other spatial and/or non-spatial information (proxies) that 
provide context to guide assessment of land use from the land cover data. Spatial auxiliary information typically 
includes maps of management or political boundaries (such as forest management areas or settlements), 
geophysical conditions (e.g., soils, climate) and disturbances (e.g., fires, harvesting). Spatial auxiliary data can 
also include analysis of the land cover time-series, looking forward and backward from the current years’ data to 
determine, for example, if the cover change is temporary or part of another land use type. Non-spatial auxiliary 
data such as management practices by region can also provide valuable context. Finally, reporting rules are used 
to assign each unit to an IPCC land-use category, including the subcategories of land-use 'remaining' land-use and 
land-use 'converted to' land-use. These rules include the temporary land cover change period (i.e., the length of 
time a new land cover type remains in place before the land is considered to have changed land-use). These periods 
may change for each land use category or sub-category based on country circumstances. 
The decision tree can be applied at each year of the inventory. The following clarifying text related to two key 
decision points will assist in its application: 
1. For the first year of data (not the first reporting year), the process assigns each land unit into an IPCC land-use 
category. All lands are placed into the ‘remaining’ subcategory as there is no data on conversions prior to the 
first year of analysis.  
Although not represented in this decision tree, where the first year of data is also the first reporting year it may be 
necessary to assign some lands to conversion categories using other auxiliary information.  For example: 
• The cover is identified as grass, but auxiliary maps show the land is a park within a residential area. In this 
case the land may assigned to Settlements.  
• The land is identified as grass, but the auxiliary map shows the land is within a forest management area and 
all the future cover data shows the cover as forest. In this case it is possible to assume that the cover is part 
of a harvest cycle and the land can be assigned to Forest Land. 
2. After the initial year, the cover and auxiliary data are analysed annually (even if the auxiliary data is not updated 
annually). The process is similar to the first step but includes additional analyses to ensure the lands are placed 
in the correct remaining or conversion sub-categories. There are two main processes for analysing land use and 
land use change depending on the cover change. 
Land cover does not change. 
• Where the cover and auxiliary data do not change, the land remains in the current remaining category. 
• Where cover does not change, but auxiliary data does (for example, grass cover remains, but the urban 
expansion means that the land is now classed as Settlements), the land is placed into the appropriate 
converted to or remaining sub-category depending on the country specific reporting rules 
Land cover does change. 
• Where cover changes and the auxiliary data suggest a land use change, analyse the time-series of cover data 
and apply the appropriate reporting rules to allocate the land to the appropriate converted to or remaining 
sub-category. 
• Where the cover data changes but the auxiliary data suggests this is not a land use change (e.g., forest 
harvesting), analyse the time-series of cover data, apply the temporary destocking reporting rules and 
allocate the land to the appropriate converted to or remaining sub-category. 
Both national data and global datasets can be used to derive IPCC land-use categories from land cover information.  
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
3.52 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
To accurately report the area of land-use change categories in the first year of the time-series of a GHG inventory 
requires estimates of areas of land-use changes that occurred before the initial reporting year. Since the area to be 
reported in a land-use change category is the cumulative area of conversions occurred in the period Y-X, where Y 
is the reporting year and X is the transition period length, in years, it is good practice to report a land-use 
conversion in an appropriate conversion category. The default length of X is 20 years but may vary depending on 
country circumstances.
