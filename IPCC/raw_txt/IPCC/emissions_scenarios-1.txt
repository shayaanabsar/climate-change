How will the world's climate change in the coming century? The answer to this question depends on how human societies 
develop in terms of demographics and economic development, technological change, energy supply and demand, and land use 
change. 
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios describes new scenarios of 
the future, and predicts greenhouse gas emissions associated with such developments. These scenarios are based on a thorough 
review of the literature, the development of narrative "storylines", and the quantification of these storylines with the help of six 
different integrated models from different countries. The scenarios provide the basis for future assessnlents of climate change 
and possible response strategies. The report illustrates that future emissions, even in the absence of explicit climate policies, 
depend very much on the choices people make; how economies are structured, which energy sources are preferred, and how 
people use available land resources. The IPCC published previous greenhouse gas emissions scenarios in 1990 and 1992. The 
current scenarios introduce many innovative aspects, such as narrative descriptions of the scenarios, inclusion of information 
on the availability of energy technologies, and an analysis of international equity issues. 
This IPCC Special Report is the most comprehensive and state-of-the-art assessment available of greenhouse gas emissions 
scenarios, and provides invaluable information for industry, policy-makers, environmental organizations, and researchers in 
global change, technology, engineering and economics.

Foreword 
The Intergovernmental Panel on CHmate Change (IPCC) was 
jointly established by the World Meteorological Organization 
(WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme 
(UNEP) to assess the scientific, technical and socio-economic 
information relevant for the understanding of the risk of 
human-induced climate change. Since its inception the IPCC 
has produced a series of comprehensive Assessment Reports on 
the state of understanding of causes of climate change, its 
potential impacts and options for response strategies. It 
prepared 
also 
Special 
Reports, 
Technical 
Papers, 
methodologies and guidelines. These IPCC publications have 
become standard works of reference, widely used by 
policymakers, scientists and other experts. 
In 1992 the IPCC released emission scenarios to be used for 
driving global circulation models to develop climate change 
scenarios. The so-called IS92 scenarios were pathbreaking. 
They were the first global scenarios to provide estimates for the 
full suite of greenhouse gases. Much has changed since then in 
our understanding of possible future greenhouse gas emissions 
and climate change. Therefore the IPCC decided in 1996 to 
develop a new set of emissions .scenarios which will provide 
input to the IPCC third assessment report but can be of broader 
use than the IS92 scenarios. The new scenarios provide also 
input for evaluating climatic and environmental consequences 
of future greenhouse gas emissions and for assessing 
alternative mitigation and adaptation strategies. They include 
improved emission baselines and latest information on 
economic restructuring throughout the world, examine 
different rates and trends in technological change and expand 
the range of different economic-development pathways, 
including narrowing of the income gap between developed and 
developing countries. To achieve this a new approach was 
adopted to take into account a wide range of scientific 
perspectives, and interactions between regions and sectors. 
Thiough the so-called "open process" input and feedback from 
G.O.P. Obasi 
Secretary-General 
World Meteorological Organization 
a community of experts much broader than the writing team 
were solicited. The results of this work show that different 
social, economic and technological developments have a strong 
impact on emission trends, without assuming explicit climate 
policy interventions. The new scenarios provide also important 
insights about the interlinkages between environmental quality 
and development choices and will certainly be a useful tool for 
experts and decision makers. 
As usual in the IPCC, success in producing this report has 
depended first and foremost on the co-operation of scientists 
and other experts worldwide. In the case of this report the 
active contribution of a broad expert community to the open 
process was an important element of the success. These 
individuals have devoted enormous time and effort to 
producing this report and we are extremely grateful for their 
commitment to the IPCC process. We would like to highlight 
in particular the enthusiasm and tireless efforts of the co-
ordinating lead author for this report Nebojsa Nakicenovic and 
his team at the International Institute for Applied Systems 
Analysis (IIASA) in Laxenburg/Austria who ensured the high 
quality of this report. 
Further we would like to express our sincere thanks to:

Preface 
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was 
established jointly by the World Meteorological Organisation 
(WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme 
(UNEP) to assess periodically the science, impacts, and socio-
economics of climate change and of adaptation and mitigation 
options. The IPCC provides, on request, scientific and 
technical advice to the Conference of the Parties to the United 
Nations 
Framework Convention on 
Climate Change 
(UNFCCC) and its bodies. In response to a 1994 evaluation of 
the earlier IPCC IS92 emissions scenarios, the 1996 Plenaiy of 
the IPCC requested this Special Report on Emissions Scenarios 
(SRES) (see Appendix I for the Teims of Reference). This 
report was accepted by the Working Group III (WGIII) plenary 
session in March 2000. The long-term nature and imcertainty 
of climate change and its driving forces require scenarios that 
extend to the end of the 21st century. This report describes the 
new scenarios and how they were developed. 
The SRES scenarios cover a wide range of the main driving 
forces of future emissions, from demographic to technological 
and economic developments. As required by the Terms of 
Reference, none of the scenarios in the set includes any future 
policies that explicitly address climate change, although all 
scenarios necessarily encompass various policies of other 
types. The set of SRES emissions scenarios is based on an 
extensive assessment of the literature, six alternative modelling 
approaches, and an "open process" that solicited wide 
participation and feedback from many groups and individuals. 
The SRES scenarios include the range of emissions of all 
relevant species of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and sulfur and 
their driving forces. 
The SRES writing team included more than 50 members from 
18 countries who represent a broad range of scientific 
disciplines, regional backgrounds, and non-governmental 
organizations (see Appendix II). The team, led by Nebojsa 
Nakicenovic of the International Institute for Applied Systems 
Analysis (IIASA) in Austria, included representatives of six 
scenario modeling groups and lead authors from all three 
earUer IPCC scenario activities - the 1990 and 1992 scenarios 
and the 1994 scenario evaluation. The SRES preparation 
included six major steps; 
• 
analysis of existing scenarios in the literature; 
• 
analysis of major scenario characteristics, driving 
forces, and their relationships; 
• 
fonnulation of four narrative scenario "storylines" to 
describe alternative futures; 
• 
quantification of each storyline using a variety of 
modelling approaches; 
• 
an "open" review process of the resultant emission 
scenarios and their assumptions; and 
• 
three revisions of the scenarios and the report 
subsequent to the open review process, i.e., the formal 
IPCC Expert Review and the final combined IPCC 
Expert and Government Review. 
As required by the Terms of Reference, the SRES preparation 
process was open with no single "official" model and no 
exclusive "expert teams." To this end, in 1997 the IPCC 
advertised in relevant scientific journals and other publications 
to solicit wide participation in the process. A web site 
documenting the SRES process and intermediate results was 
created to facilitate outside input. Members of the writing team 
also published much of their background research in the peer-
reviewed literature and on web sites. 
In June 1998, the IPCC Bureau agreed to make the 
unapproved, preliminary scenarios available to climate 
modelers, who could use the scenarios as a basis for the 
assessment of climatic changes in time for consideration in the 
IPCC's Third Assessment Report. We recommend that the new 
scenarios be used not only in the IPCC's future assessments of 
climate change, its impacts, and adaptation and mitigation 
options, but also as the basis for analyses by the wider research 
and policy community of climate change and other 
environmental problems.

These scenaiios have been widely used in the analysis of 
possible climate change, its impacts, and options to mitigate 
climate change. In 1995, the IPCC 1992 scenarios were 
evaluated. The evaluation recommended that significant 
changes (since 1992) in the understanding of driving forces of 
emissions and methodologies should be addressed. These 
changes in understanding relate to, e.g., the carbon intensity of 
energy supply, the income gap between developed and 
developing countries, and to sulfur emissions. This led to a 
decision by the IPCC Plenary in 1996 to develop a new set of 
scenarios. The new set of scenarios is presented in this report. 
What 
a r e scenarios 
and what is their 
purpose? 
F u t u r e greenhouse

s o c i o - e c o n o m i c 
development, 
a n d t e c h n o l o g i c a l c h a n g e . Their future evolution 
is highly uncertain. Scenarios are alternative images of how the 
future might unfold and are an appropriate tool with which to 
analyze how driving forces may influence future emission 
outcomes and to assess the associated uncertainties. They assist 
in climate change analysis, including climate modeling and the 
assessment of impacts, adaptation, and mitigation. The 
possibility that any single emissions path will occur as 
described in scenarios is highly uncertain. 
What 
a r e the m a i n characteristics 
of the new 
scenarios? 
A set of s c e n a r i o s was d e v e l o p e d t o r e p r e s e n t

"disaster" scenarios in the literature. Any scenario necessarily 
includes subjective elements 
and is open to various 
ЫегсгеЫиот. 
Preferences for the scenaiios presented here 
vary among users. No judgment is offered in this report as to 
the preference for any of the scenarios and they are not 
assigned probabilities of occurrence, neither must they be 
inteipreted as policy recommendations.

by non-climate change policies designed for a wide range of 
other purposes. Fuzthermore government policies can, to 
varying degrees, influence the GHG emission drivers such as 
demographic change, social and economic development, 
technological 
change, 
resource 
use, 
and 
pollution 
management. This influence is broadly reflected in the 
storylines and resultant scenarios.

a b o u t d r i v i n g f o r c e s . Six models were used which 
are representative of integrated assessment frameworks in the 
literature. One advantage of a multi-model approach is that the 
resultant 40 SRES scenarios together encompass the cuiTent 
range of uncertainties of future GHG emissions arising from 
different characteristics of these models, in addition to the 
current knowledge of and uncertainties that arise from scenario 
driving forces such as demographic, social and economic, and 
broad technological developments that drive the models, as 
described in the storylines. Thirteen of these 40 scenarios 
explore variations in energy technology assumptions. 
^ Included are anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide (COj), 
methane (CH^), nitrous oxide (NjO), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), 
perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF^), hydrochloro-
fluorocaibons (HCFCs), chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), the aerosol 
precursor and the chemically active gases sulfur dioxide (SO^), 
carbon monoxide (CO), niüogen oxides (N0,,), and non-methane 
volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs). Emissions are provided 
aggregated into four world i-egions and global totals. In the new 
scenarios no feedback effect of future climate change on emissions 
from biosphere and energy has been assumed.

Figure SPM-1: Schematic illustration of SRES scenarios. Four qualitative storylines yield four sets of scenarios called 
"families": A l , A 2 , B l , and B2. Altogether 40 SRES scenarios have been developed by six modeling teams. A l l are equally 
valid with no assigned probabilities of occurrence. The set of scenarios consists of six scenario groups drawn from the four 
families: one group each in A 2 , B l , B2, and three groups within the A l family, characterizing alternative developments of 
energy technologies: A l F I (fossil fuel intensive), A l B (balanced), and A I T (predominantly non-fossil fuel). Within each 
famüy and group of scenarios, some share "harmonized" assumptions on global population, gross world product, and final 
energy. These are marked as " H S " for harmonized scenarios. " O S " denotes scenarios that explore uncertainties in driving 
forces beyond those of the harmonized scenarios. The number of scenarios developed within each category is shown. For 
each of the six scenario groups an illustrative scenario (which is always harmonized) is provided. Four illustrative marker 
scenarios, one for each scenario family, were used in draft form in the 1998 SRES open process and are included in revised 
form in this report. Two additional illustrative scenarios for the groups A l F I and A I T are also provided and complete a set 
of six that illustrate all scenario groups. A l l are equally sound. 
B y 2100 the world will have changed in ways that are difficult to imagine - as difficult as it would have been at the end of the 
19th century to imagine the changes of the 100 years since. Each storyline assumes a distinctly different direction for future 
developments, such that the four storylines differ in increasingly irreversible ways. Together they describe divergent futures that 
encompass a significant portion of the underlying uncertainties in the main driving forces. They cover a wide range of key 
"future" characteristics such as demographic change, economic development, and technological change. For this reason, their 
plausibility or feasibility should not be considered solely on the basis of an extrapolation of c u r r e n t economic, technological, 
and social trends. 
• 
The A l storyline and scenario family describes a future world of very rapid economic growth, global population that 
peaks in mid-century and declines thereafter, and the rapid introduction of new and more efficient technologies. Major 
underlying themes are convergence among regions, capacity building, and increased cultural and social interactions, with 
a substantial reduction in regional differences in per capita income. The A l scenario family develops into three groups 
that describe alternative directions of technological change in the energy system. The three A l groups are distinguished 
by their technological emphasis: fossil intensive (AlFI), non-fossil energy sources (AIT), or a balance across all sources 
(A1B)3. 
^ Balanced is defined as not relying too heavily on one particular energy source, on the assumption that similar improvement rates apply 
to all energy supply and end use technologies. 
Summary 
f o r 
P o l i c y m a k e r s

• 
The A2 storylme and scenario family describes a very heterogeneous world. The underlying theme is self-reliance and 
preservation of local identities. Fertility patterns across regions converge very slowly, which results in continuously 
increasing global population. Economic development is primarily regionally oriented and per capita economic growth 
and technological change are more fragmented and slower than in other storylines. 
• 
The B l storyline and scenario family describes a convergent world with the same global population that peaks in mid-
century and declines thereafter, as in the A l storyline, but with rapid changes in economic structures toward a service 
and information economy, with reductions in material intensity, and the mtroduction of clean and resource-efficient 
technologies. The emphasis is on global solutions to economic, social, and envh-onmental sustainability, includmg 
improved equity, but without additional clknate initiatives. 
• 
The B2 storyline and scenario family describes a world in which the emphasis is on local solutions to economic, social, 
and environmental sustainability. It is a world with continuously increasing global population at a rate lower than A2, 
intermediate levels of economic development, and less rapid and more diverse technological change than in the В1 and 
A l storylines. While the scenario is also oriented toward environmental protection and social equity, it focuses on local 
and regional levels.

scenarios were harmonized by adopting common assumptions 
on global population and gross domestic product (GDP) 
development. Thus, the harmonized scenarios in each family 
are not independent of each other. The remaining 14 scenarios 
adopted alternative interpretations of the four scenario 
storylines to explore additional scenario uncertainties beyond 
differences in méthodologie approaches. They are also related 
to each other within each family, even though they do not share 
common assumptions about some of the driving forces.

combinations of demographic change, social and economic 
development, 
and 
broad 
technological 
developments, 
corresponding to the four families (Al, A2, B l , B2), each with 
an illustrative "marker" scenario. Two of the scenario groups of 
the A l family (AlFI, AIT) explicitly explore alternative 
energy technology developments, holding the other driving 
forces constant, each with an illustrative scenario. Rapid 
growth leads to high capital turnover rates, which means that 
early small differences among scenarios can lead to a large 
divergence by 2100. Therefore the A l family, which has the 
highest rates of technological change 
and economic 
development, was selected to show this effect.

SRES writing team as illustrative of a particular storyline. 
These scenarios have received the closest scrutiny of the entire 
writing team and via the SRES open process. Scenarios have 
also been selected to illustrate the other two scenario groups. 
Hence, this report has an illustrative scenario for each of the six

The A l and B l scenario families are based on the low 
Intemational Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) 
1996 projection. They share the lowest trajectory, increasing to 
8.7 billion by 2050 and declining toward 7 billion by 2100, 
which combines low fertility with low mortality. The B2 
scenario family is based on the long-term U N Medium 1998 
population projection of 10.4 billion by 2100. The A2 scenario 
family is based on a high population growth scenario of 15 
billion by 2100 that assumes a significant decline in fertility for 
most regions and stabilization at above replacement levels. It 
falls below the long-term 1998 U N High projection of 18 
billion. 
Technological change is not quantified in table SPM-1. 
5 Because of the impossibility of including the complex way land use 
is changing between the various land use types, this information is not 
in the table.

families ( A l , A2, B l , and B2) and six scenario groups: the fossil-intensive A l F I (comprising the high-coal and high-oil-and-gas 
scenarios), the predominantly non-fossil fuel AIT, the balanced A l B in Figure SPM-3a; A2 in Figure SPM-3b; B l in Figure

Associated changes in agricultural land use are driven principally 
by changing food demands caused by demographic and dietary 
shifts. Numerous other social, economic, institutional, and 
technological factors also affect the relative shares of agricultural 
lands, forests, and other types of land use. Different analytic 
methods lead to very different results, indicating that future land 
use change in the scenarios is very model specific.

between the driving forces and non-CO^ GHG emissions are 
generally more complex and less studied, and the models used 
for the scenarios less sophisticated. Hence, the uncertainties in 
the SRES emissions for non-CO^ greenhouse gases are 
generally greater than those for energy CO^^. 
* Therefore, the ranges of non-CO^ GHG emissions provided in the 
Report may not fully reflect the level of uncertainty compared to CO^, 
for example only a single model provided the sole value for

into four cumulative emissions categories; low, medium-low, medium-high, and high emissions. Each category contains one 
illustrative marker scenario plus alternatives that lead to comparable cumulative emissions, although often through different 
driving forces. This categorization can guide comparisons using either scenarios with different driving forces yet similar 
emissions, or scenarios with similar driving forces but different emissions. The cumulative emissions of the IS92 scenarios are

scenarios for CO^ emissions from energy and industry as well 
as total emissions but represents a much wider range for land-
use change. The six scenario groups cover wide and 
overlapping emission ranges. The range of GHG emissions in 
the scenarios widens over time to capture the long-term 
uncertainties reflected in the literature for many of the driving 
forces, and after 2050 widens significantly as a result of 
different socio-economic developments. Table SPM-2b 
summarizes the emissions across the scenarios in 2020, 2050, 
and 2100. Figure SPM-3 shows in greater detail the ranges of 
total 
emissions for the six scenario groups of scenarios 
that constitute the four families (the three scenario families A2, 
B l , and B2, plus three groups within the A l family AlFI, 
AIT, 
and AlB).

trend reversals (see Figures SPîvl-2 and SPM-3) depart from

upward emissions trend due to income growth is more than

(Figure

the literature and can be associated with slowing population 
growth, followed by a decline in some scenarios, increasing 
agricultural productivity, and increasing scarcity of forest land. 
These factors allow for a reversal of the current trend of loss of 
forest cover in many cases. Emissions decline fastest in the В1 
family. Only in the A2 family do net anthropogenic COj 
emissions from land use change^ remain positive through 2100. 
As was the case for energy-related emissions, C O 2 emissions 
related to land-use change in the A l family cover the widest 
range. The diversity across these scenarios is amplified through 
the high economic growth, increasing the range of alternatives, 
and through the different modeling approaches and their 
treatment of technology.

according to their cumulative emissions.^ (see Figure SPM-4). 
The 
SRES scenarios extend the IS92 range toward higher 
emissions (SRES maximum of 2538 GtC compared to 2140 
GtC for IS92), but not toward lower emissions. The lower 
bound for both scenario sets is approximately 770 
GtC.

Emissions of these gases in a number of scenarios begin to 
decline by 2050. The range of emissions is wider than in the 
IS92 scenarios due to the multimodel approach, which leads to 
a better treatment of uncertainties and to a wide range of 
driving forces. These totals include emissions from land use, 
energy systems, industry, and waste management.

initial increases, 
emissions related to land use peak and 
decline. In the B2 family, emissions continue to grow, albeit 
very slowly. In the A2 family, both high population growth and 
less rapid increases in agricultural productivity result in a 
continuous rapid growth in those emissions related to land use.

insights about the availability of alternatives to HFCs as 
replacements for substances controlled by the Montreal Protocol, 
initially HFC emissions are generally lower than in previous 
IPCC scenarios. In the A2 and B2 scenario families HFC 
emissions increase rapidly in the second half of the this century, 
while in the A2 and B2 scenario families the growth of emissions 
is significantly slowed down or reversed in that period.

These reflect sulfur control legislation in Europe, North

other developing regions. The timing and impact of these 
changes and controls vary across scenarios and regions^. After 
^ In this Report, cumulative emissions are calculated by adding 
annual net anthropogenic emissions in the scenarios over their time 
horizon. When relating these cumulative emissions to atmospheric 
concentrations, all natural processes that affect carbon concentrations 
in the atmosphere have to be taken into account. 
' Although global emissions of SO^ for the SRES scenarios are lower 
than the IS92 scenarios, uncertainty about SOj emissions and their 
effect on sulfate aerosols has increased compared to the IS92 
scenarios because of very diverse regional pattems of SO2 emissions 
in the scenarios.

Uncertainties in the future developments of key emission 
driving forces create large uncertainties in future emissions, 
even within the same socio-economic development paths. 
Therefore, emissions from each scenario family overlap 
substantially with emissions from other scenario families. The 
overlap implies that a given level of future emissions can arise 
from very different combinations of driving forces. Figures 
SPM-1, SPM-2, and SPM-3 show this for

Tables SPM-la and SPM-lb 
indicate that there ai'e scenarios with high per capita incomes 
in all regions that lead to high COj emissions (e.g., in the high-
growth, fossil fuel intensive scenario group AlFI). They also 
indicate that there are scenarios with high per capita incomes 
that lead to low emissions (e.g., the AIT scenario group or the 
B l scenario family). This suggests that in some cases other 
driving forces may have a greater inñuence on GHG emissions 
than income growth.

A2, B l , and B2, plus three groups within the A l scenario 
family, A l B , AlFI, and AIT - and four cumulative emissions 
categories were developed as the smallest subsets of SRES 
scenarios that capture the range of uncertainties associated 
with driving forces and emissions. 
The 
i m p o r t a n t u n c e r t a i n t i e s r a n g i n g f r o m 
d r i v i n g f o r c e s t o 
emissions 
may be different

a n a l y s i s . CHmate modelers may want to cover the range 
reflected by the cumulative emissions categories. To assess the 
robustness of options in terms of impacts, vulnerability, and 
adaptation may require scenarios with similar emissions but 
different socio-economic characteristics, as reflected by the six 
scenario groups. For mitigation analysis, variation in both 
emissions and socio-economic characteristics may be 
necessary. For analysis at the national or regional scale, the 
most appropriate scenarios may be those that best reflect 
specific circumstances and perspectives.

s c e n a r i o s o r t o t h e 
u n d e r l y i n g s c e n a r i o l i t e r a t u r e . Probabilities or likelihood are 
not assigned to individual SRES scenarios. None of the SRES 
scenarios represents an estimate of a central tendency for all 
driving forces or emissions, such as the mean or median, and 
none should be interpreted as such. The distribution of the 
scenarios provides a useful context for understanding the 
relative position of a scenario but does not represent the 
likelihood of its occurrence. 
The 
d r i v i n g f o r c e s a n d emissions 
of each 
SRES 
s c e n a r i o s h o u l d 
be 
used 
t o g e t h e r . 
To avoid internal inconsistencies, 
components of SRES scenarios should not be mixed. For 
example, the GHG emissions from one scenario and the SO2 
emissions from another scenario, or the population from one 
and economic development path from another, should not be 
combined.

w i t h a l o n g - t e r m c o n t e x t f o r n e a r - t e r m a n a l y s i s . The modeling 
tools that have been used to develop these scenarios that focus 
on the century time scale are less suitable for analysis of near 
term (a decade or less) developments. When analyzing 
mitigation and adaptation options, the user should be aware 
that although no additional climate initiatives are included in 
the SRES scenarios, various changes have been assumed to 
occur that would require other interventions, such as those 
leading to reductions in sulfur emissions and significant 
penetration of new energy technologies. 
W h a t f u t u r e work on emissions 
scenarios 
would 
be 
useful? 
• 
Establishment of a program for on-going evaluations 
and comparisons of long-term emission scenarios, 
including a regularly updated scenario database; 
• 
Capacity building, particularly in developing countries, 
in the area of modeling tools and emissions scenarios; 
• 
Multiple storyline, multi-model approaches in future 
scenario analyses; 
• 
New research activities to assess future developments 
in key G H G driving forces in greater regional, 
subregional, and sectoral detail which allow for a 
clearer link between emissions scenarios and mitigation 
options; 
• 
Improved specification and data for, and integration of 
the ПОП-СО2 GHG and non-energy sectors, such as land 
use, land-use change and forestry, in models, as well as 
model inter-comparison to improve scenarios and 
analyses; 
• 
Integration into models emissions of particulate, 
hydrogen, or nitrate aerosol precursors, and processes, 
Confidence in the quantification of any scenario decreases 
substantially as the time horizon increases because the basis for 
the assumptions becomes increasingly speculative. This is why a 
set of scenarios was developed. 
Summary 
f o r 
P o l i c y m a k e r s 
such as feedback of climate change on emissions, that 
may significantly influence scenario results and 
analyses; 
Development of additional gridded emissions for 
scenarios which would facilitate improved regional 
assessment; 
Assessment of strategies that would address multiple 
national, regional, or global priorities; 
Development of methods for scientifically sound 
aggregation of emissions data; 
More detailed information on assumptions, inputs, and 
the results of the 40 SRES scenarios should be made 
available at a web site and on a CD-ROM. Regular 
maintenance of the SRES web site is needed; 
• 
Extension of the SRES web site and production of a 
CD-ROM to provide, if appropriate, time-dependent 
geographic 
distributions of driving forces 
and 
emissions, and concentrations of GHGs and sulfate 
aerosols. 
• 
Development of a classification scheme for classifying 
scenarios as intervention or non-intervention scenarios.

1. 
Introduction and Background 
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 
decided at its September 1996 plenary session in Mexico City 
to develop a new set of emissions scenarios (see Appendix I for 
the Terms of Reference). This Special Report on Emission 
Scenarios (SRES) describes the new scenarios and how they 
were developed. 
The SRES writing team formulated a set of emissions 
scenarios. These scenarios cover a wide range of the main 
driving forces of future emissions, from demographic to 
technological and economic developments. The scenarios 
encompass different future developments that might influence 
greenhouse gas (GHG) sources and sinks, such as alternative 
structures of energy systems and land-use changes. As required 
by the Terms of Reference however, none of the scenarios in 
the set includes any future policies that explicitly address 
additional climate change 
initiatives', although G H G 
emissions are directly affected by non-climate change policies 
designed for a wide range of other purpose. 
The set of SRES emissions scenarios is based on an extensive 
assessment of the literature, six alternative modeling 
approaches, and an "open process" that solicited wide 
participation and feedback from many groups and individuals. 
The set of scenarios includes anthropogenic emissions of all 
relevant GHG species, sulfur dioxide (SOj), carbon monoxide 
(CO), nitrogen oxides (NO^,), and non-methane volatile organic 
compounds (NMVOCs), see Table 1-1 in Chapter 1. It covers 
most of the range of G H G emissions compared with the 
published scenario literature. For example, emissions of carbon 
dioxide (COj) in 2100 range from more than 40 to less than 6 
giga (or billion) tons^ of elemental carbon (GtC), that is, from 
almost a sevenfold increase to roughly the same emissions 
level as in 1990. 
Future emissions and the evolution of their underlying driving 
forces are highly uncertain, as reflected in the very wide range 
of future emissions paths in the literature that is also captured 
by the SRES scenarios. The use of scenarios in this report 
addresses the uncertainties 
related to 
k n o w n 
factors. 
Uncertainties related to u n k n o w n factors can of course never be 
persuasively captured by any approach. As the prediction of 
future anthropogenic GHG emissions is impossible, alternative 
GHG emissions scenarios become a major tool for analyzing 
potential long-range developments of the socio-economic 
system and corresponding emission sources. 
Emissions scenarios are a central component of any assessment 
of climate change. GHG and SO2 emissions are the basic input 
' For example, no scenarios are included that explicitly assume 
implementation of the emission targets in the UNFCCC and the Kyoto 
protocol. 
^ Metric tons are used throughout this report. Unless otherwise 
specified, monetary units are 1990 US dollars (see Chapter 4). 
for determining future climate patterns with simple climate 
models, as well as with complex general circulation models 
(GCMs). Possible climate change, together with the major 
driving forces of future emissions, such as demographic 
pattems, economic development and environmental conditions, 
provide the basis for the assessment of vulnerability, possible 
adverse impacts and adaptation strategies and policies to 
climate change. The major driving forces of future emissions 
also provide the basis for the assessment of possible mitigation 
strategies and policies designed to avoid climate change. The 
new set of emissions scenarios is intended for use in future 
IPCC assessments and by wider scientific and policymaking 
communities for analyzing the effects of future G H G 
emissions and for developing mitigation and adaptation 
measures and policies. 
2. 
Emissions Scenarios and Their Purposes 
Scenarios are images of the future, or alternative futures. They 
are neither predictions nor forecasts. Rather, each scenario is 
one alternative image of how the future might unfold (see 
Chapters 1 and 4 for more detail). As such they enhance our 
understanding of how systems behave, evolve and interact. 
They are useful tools for scientific assessments, learning about 
complex systems behavior and for policymaking and assist in 
climate change analysis, including climate modeling and the 
assessment of impacts, adaptation and mitigation. 
Future levels of global GHG emissions are a product of very 
complex, ill-understood dynamic systems, driven by forces 
such as population growth, socio-economic development, and 
technological progress among others, thus making long-term 
predictions about emissions virtually impossible. However, 
near-term policies may have profound long-term climate 
impacts. Consequently, policy makers need a summary of what 
is understood about possible future GHG emissions, and given 
the uncertainties 
in both emissions models and our 
understanding of key driving forces, scenarios are an 
appropriate tool for summarizing both current understanding 
and current uncertainties. 
GHG emissions scenarios are usually based on an internally 
consistent and reproducible set of assumptions about the key 
relationships and driving forces of change, which are derived 
from our understanding of both history and the current 
situation. Often these scenarios are formulated with the help of 
formal models. Sometimes GHG emissions scenarios are less 
quantitative and more descriptive, and in a few cases they do 
not involve any formal analysis and are expressed in qualitative 
terms. The SRES scenarios involve both qualitative and 
quantitative components; they have a narrative part called 
"storylines" and a number of corresponding quantitative 
scenarios for each storyline. SRES scenarios can be viewed as 
a linking tool that integrates qualitative narratives or stories 
about the future and quantitative formulations based on 
different formal modeling approaches. Although no scenarios 
are value free, the SRES scenarios are descriptive and are not

intended to be desirable or undesirable in their own right. They 
have been built as descriptions of plausible alternative futures, 
rather than preferred developments. 
However, developing scenarios for a period of one hundred 
years is a relatively new field. This is not only because of large 
scientific uncertainties and data inadequacies. For example, 
within the 2 P'century technological discontinuities should be 
expected, and possibly major shifts in societal values and in the 
balance of geopolitical power. The study of past trends over 
such long periods is hampered by the fact that most databases 
are incomplete if we go back much further than 50 years. Given 
these gaps in our data, methods, and understanding, scenarios 
are the best way to integrate demographic, economic, societal, 
and technological knowledge with our understanding of 
ecological systems to evaluate sources and sinks of G H G 
emissions. Scenarios as an integration tool in the assessment of 
climate change allow a role for intuition, analysis, and 
synthesis, and thus we turn to scenarios in this report to take 
advantage of those features to aid the assessment of future 
climate change, impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and 
mitigation. Since the scenarios focus on the century time scale, 
tools have been used that have been developed for this puipose. 
These tools are less suitable for analysis of near-term 
developments and this report does not intend to provide 
reliable projections for the near term. 
3. 
Review of Past IPCC Emissions Scenarios 
The IPCC developed sets of emissions scenarios in 1990 and 
1992. The six IS92 scenarios developed in 1992 (Leggett et a i , 
1992; Pepper et a l . , 1992), have been used very widely in 
climate change assessments. In 1995 the IPCC formally 
evaluated the 1992 scenarios and found that they were 
innovative at the time of their publication, path-breaking in 
their coverage of the full range of GHG emissions and useful 
for the puipose of driving atmospheric and climate models 
(Alcamo et a i , 1995). Specifically, their global carbon 
emissions spanned most of the range of other scenarios 
identified in the literature at that time. 
The review also identified a number of weaknesses. These 
included the limited range of carbon intensities of energy 
(carbon emissions per unit energy) and the absence of any 
scenario with significant closure in the income gap between 
developed and developing countries, even after a full century 
(Parikh, 1992). Furthermore, rapid growth of sulfur emissions 
in the IS92 scenarios had been questioned on the basis that they 
did not reflect recent legislation in Japan, Europe, and North 
America and that in general regional and local air quality 
concerns might prompt limits on future sulfur emissions. 
An important recommendation of the 1995 IPCC review was 
that, given the degree of uncertainty about future climate 
change, analysts should use the full range of IS92 emissions as 
input to climate models rather than a single scenario. This is in 
stark contrast to the actual use of one scenario from the set, the 
IS92a scenario, as the reference scenario in numerous studies. 
The review concluded that the mere fact of the IS92a being an 
intermediate, or central, CO2 emissions scenario at the global 
level at that time does not equate it with being the most likely 
scenario. Indeed, the conclusion was that there was no 
objective basis on which to assign likelihood to any of the 
scenai'ios. Furthermore, the IS92a scenario was shown to be 
"central" for only a few of its salient characteristics such as 
global population growth, global economic development and 
global CO2 emissions. In other ways, IS92a was found not to 
be central with respect to the published literature, particularly 
in some of its regional assumptions and emissions. The same is 
the case with the new set of SRES scenarios, as is shown 
below. 
The new set of SRES scenarios presented here is designed to 
respond to the IS92 weaknesses identified in the 1995 IPCC 
scenario evaluation and to incorporate advances in the state of 
the art since 1992. As in the case of the IS92 scenario series, 
also in this new set of SRES scenarios there is no single central 
case with respect to all characteristics that are relevant for 
different uses of emissions scenarios and there is no objective 
way to assign likelihood to any of the scenarios. Hence there is 
no "best guess" or "business-as-usual" scenario. 
4. 
SRES Writing Team, Approach, and Process 
IPCC Working Group III (WGIII) appointed the SRES writing 
team in January 1997. After some adjustments, it eventually 
came to include more than 50 members from 18 countries. 
Together they represent a broad range of scientific disciplines, 
regional backgrounds, and non-governmental organizations. In 
particular, the team includes representatives of six scenario 
modeling groups and a number of lead authors from all three 
earlier IPCC scenario activities: the 1990 and 1992 scenai'ios 
and the 1995 scenario evaluation. Their expertise and 
familiarity with earlier IPCC emissions scenario work assured 
continuity and allowed the SRES effort to build efficiendy 
upon prior work. The SRES team worked in close 
collaboration with colleagues on the IPCC Task Group on 
Climate Scenarios for Impact Assessment (TGCIA) and with 
colleagues from all three IPCC Working Groups (WGs) of the 
Third Assessment Report (TAR). Appendix II lists the 
members of the writing team and their affiliations and Chapter 
1 gives a more detailed description of the SRES approach and 
process. 
Taking the above audiences and purposes into account, the 
following more precise specifications for the new SRES 
scenarios were developed. The new scenarios should: 
• 
cover the full range of radiatively important gases, 
which include direct and indirect GHGs and SOj, 
• 
have sufficient spatial resolution to allow regional 
assessments of climate change in the global context; 
• 
cover a wide spectrum of alternative futures to reflect 
relevant uncertainties and knowledge gaps; 
T e c h n i c a l 
Summary 
25 
• 
use a variety of models to reflect methodological 
pluralism and uncertainty; 
• 
incorporate input from a wide range of scientific 
disciplines and expertise from non-academic sources 
through an open process; 
• 
exclude additional initiatives and policies specifically 
designed to reduce climate change; 
• 
cover and describe to the extent possible a range of 
policies that could affect climate change although they 
are targeted at other issues, for example, reductions in 
SO, emissions to limit acid rain; 
• 
cover as much as possible of the range of major 
underlying driving forces of emission scenarios 
identified in the open literature; 
• 
be transparent with input assumptions, modeling 
approaches, and results open to external review; 
• 
be reproducible - document data and methodology 
adequately enough to allow other researchers to 
reproduce the scenarios; and 
• 
be internally consistent - the various input assumptions 
and data of the scenarios are internally consistent to the 
extent possible. 
The writing team agreed that the scenario formulation process 
would consist of five major components: 
• 
review of existing scenarios in the literature; 
• 
analysis of their main characteristics and driving 
forces; 
• 
formulation of narrative "storylines" to describe 
alternative futures; 
• 
quantification of storylines with different modeling 
approaches; and 
• 
"open" review process of emissions scenarios and their 
assumptions 
As is evident from the components of the work program, there 
was agreement that the process be an open one with no single 
"official" model and no exclusive "expert teams." In 1997 the 
IPCC advertised in a number of relevant scientific journals and 
other publications to solicit wide participation in the process. 
To facilitate participation and improve the usefulness of the 
new scenarios, the SRES web site (www.sres.ciesin) was 
created. In addition, members of the writing team published 
much of the background work used for formulating SRES 
scenarios in the peer-reviewed literature^ and on web sites (see 
Appendix IV). Finally, the revised set of scenarios, the web 
sites, and the draft of this report have been evaluated through 
the IPCC expert and government review processes. This

process resulted in numerous changes and revisions of the 
report. In particular, during the approval process of Ihe 
Summary for Policymakers (SPM) in March 2000 at the 5"' 
Session of the WG III in Katmandu changes in this SPM were 
agreed that necessitated some changes in the underlying 
document, including this Technical Summary. These changes 
have been implemented in agreement with the Lead Authors. 
5. 
Scenario Literature Review and Analysis 
The first step in the formulation of the SRES scenarios was the 
review and the analysis of the published literature and the 
development of the database with more than 400 emissions 
scenarios that is accessible through the web site (www-
cger.nies.go.jp/cger-e/db/ipcc.html); 190 of these extend to 
2100 and are considered in the comparison with the SRES 
scenarios in the subsequent Figures. Chapters 2 and 3 give a 
more detailed description of the Hterature review and analysis. 
Figure TS-1 shows the global energy-related and industrial 
COj emission paths from the database as "spaghetti" curves for 
the period to 2100 against the background of the historical 
emissions from 1900 to 1990. These curves are plotted against 
an index on the vertical axis rather than as absolute values 
because of the large differences and discrepancies for the 
values assumed for the base year 1990. These sometimes arise 
from genuine differences among the scenarios (e.g., different 
data sources, definitions) and sometimes from different base 
years assumed in the analysis or from alternative calibrations.'* 
The differences among the scenarios in the specification of the 
base year illustrate the large genuine scientific and data 
uncertainty that surrounds emissions and their main driving 
forces captured in the scenarios. The literature includes 
scenarios with additional climate polices, which are sometimes 
referred to as mitigation or intervention scenarios. 
There are many ambiguities associated with the classification 
of emissions scenarios into those that include additional 
climate initiatives and those that do not. Many cannot be 
classified in this way on the basis of the information available 
from the database. Figure TS-1 indicates the ranges of 
emissions in 2100 from scenarios that apparently include 
additional climate initiatives (designated as "intervention" 
emissions range), those that do not ("non-intervention") and 
those that caimot be assigned to either of these two categories 
("non-classified"). This classification is based on the 
subjective evaluation of the scenarios in the database by the 
members of the writing team and is explained in Chapter 2. 
The range of the whole sample of scenarios has significant

wide range of future emissions. The range is also large in the base year 1990 and is indicated by an "error" bar. To separate the 
variation due to base-year specification from different future paths, emissions are indexed for the year 1990, when actual global 
energy-related and industrial CO, emissions were about 6 GtC. The coverage of COj emissions sources may vary across the 
256 different scenarios from the database included in the figure. The scenario samples used vary across the time steps (for 1990 
256 scenarios, for 2020 and 2030 247, for 2050 211, and for 2100 190 scenarios). Also shown, as vertical bars on the right of 
the figure, are the ranges of emissions in 2100 of IS92 scenarios and for scenarios from the literature that apparently include 
additional climate initiatives (designated as "intervention" scenarios emissions range), those that do not ("non-intervention"), 
and those that cannot be assigned to either of these two categories ("non-classified"). This classification is based on the 
subjective evaluation of the scenarios in the database by the members of the writing team and is explained in Chapter 2. Data 
sources: Morita and Lee, 1998a, 1998b; Nakicenovic et a l . , 1998. 
overlap with the range of those that cannot be classified and 
they share virtually the same median (15.7 and 15.2 GtC in 
2100, respectively), but the non-classified scenarios do not 
cover the high part of the range. Also, the range of the 
scenarios that apparenfly do not include climate polices (non-
intervention) has considerable overlap with the other two 
ranges (the lower bound of non-intervention scenarios is 
higher than the lower bounds of the intei-venfion and non-
classified scenarios), but with a significantly higher median 
(of 21.3 GtC in 2100). 
Historically, gross anthropogenic COj emissions have 
increased at an average rate of about 1.7% per year since 1900 
(Nakicenovic et a l . , 1996); if that historical trend continues 
global emissions would double during the next three to four 
decades and increase more than sixfold by 2100. Many 
scenarios in the database describe such a development. 
However, the range is very large around this historical trend so 
that the highest scenarios envisage about a tenfold increase of 
global emissions by 2100 as compared with 1990, while the 
lowest have emissions lower than today. The median and the 
average of the scenaiios lead to about a threefold emissions 
increase over the same time period or to about 16 GtC by 2100. 
This is lower than the median of the IS92 set and is lower than 
the IS92a scenario, often considered as the "central" scenario 
with respect to some of its tendencies. However, the 
distribution of emissions is asymmetric. The thin emissions 
"tail" that extends above the 95"' percenfile (i.e., between the 
six- and tenfold increase of emissions by 2100 compared to 
1990) includes only a few scenarios. The range of other 
emissions and the main scenario driving forces (such as 
population growth, economic development and energy 
production, conversion and end use) for the scenarios 
documented in the database is also laige and comparable to the 
variation of CO2 emissions. Statistics associated with scenarios 
from the literature do not imply probability of occurrence or 
likelihood of the scenarios. The frequency distribution of the 
database may be influenced by the use of IS92a as a reference

Summary

for scenario studies and by the fact that many scenarios in the 
database share common assumptions prescribed for the 
purpose of model comparisons with similar scenario driving 
forces. 
One of the recommendations of the writing team is that IPCC 
or a similar international institution should maintain such a 
database thereby ensuring continuity of knowledge and 
scientific progress in any future assessments of G H G 
scenarios. An equivalent database for documenting naiTative 
and other qualitative scenarios is considered to be also very 
useful for future climate-change assessments. One difficulty 
encountered in the analysis of the emissions scenarios is that 
the disünction between climate policies and non-climate policy 
scenarios and other scenarios appeared to be to a degree 
arbitrary and often impossible to make. Therefore, the wrhing 
team recommends that an effort should be made in the future 
to develop an appropriate emissions scenario classification 
scheme. 
6. 
Narrative Scenarios and Storylines 
Given these large ranges of future emissions and their driving 
forces, there is an infinite number of possible alternative 
futures to explore. The SRES scenarios cover a finite, albeit a 
very wide range, of future emissions. The approach involved 
the development of a set of four alternative scenario "families" 
comprising 40 SRES scenarios subdivided into seven scenario 
groups. During the approval process of the SPM in March 2000 
at the 5* Session of WGIII in Katmandu, it was decided to 
combine two of these groups into one, resulting in six groups. 
To facilitate the process of identifying and describing 
alternafive future developments, each scenario family includes 
a coherent narrative part called a "storyline," and a number of 
alternative inteфretatíons and quantifications of each storyline 
developed by six different modeling approaches. A l l the 
interpretations and quantifications of one storyline together are 
called a scenario family (see also Box 1-1 in Chapter 1 on 
terminology). Each storyline describes a demographic, social, 
economic, technological, environmental, and policy future for 
one of these scenario families. Storylines were formulated by 
the writing team in a process which identified driving forces, 
key uncertainties, possible scenario families, and their logic. 
Within each family different scenarios explore variations of 
global and regional developments and their implications for 
GHG and sulfur emissions. Each of these scenarios is 
consistent with the broad framework of that scenario family as 
specified by the storyline. Consequently, each scenario family 
and scenario group is equally sound. Chapters 4 and 5 give a 
more 
detailed 
description 
of 
the 
storylines, 
their 
quantifications, and the resultant 40 emissions scenarios. 
The main reasons for foimulating storylines are: 
• 
to help the writing team to think more coherentiy about 
the complex interplay among scenario driving forces 
within each and across alternative scenarios; 
• 
to make it easier to explain the scenarios to the various 
user communities by providing a narrative description 
of alternative futures that goes beyond quantitative 
scenario features; 
• 
to make the scenaiios more useful, in particular to 
analysts who contribute to IPCC WGII and WGIII; the 
social, political, and technological context described in 
the scenario storylines is all-important in analyzing the 
effects of policies either to adapt to climate change or 
to reduce GHG emissions; and 
• 
to provide a guide for additional assumptions to be 
made in detailed climate impact and mitigation 
analyses, because at present no single model or 
scenario can possibly respond to the wide variety of 
infonnational and data needs of the different user 
communities of long-term emissions scenarios. 
The SRES writing team reached broad agreement that there 
could be no "best guess" scenarios; that the future is inherentiy 
unpredictable and that views will differ on which of the 
storylines could be more likely. The writing team decided on 
four storylines: an even number helps to avoid the impression 
that there is a "central" or "most likely" case. The team wanted 
more than two in order to help illustrate that the future depends 
on many different underlying dynamics; the team did not want 
more than four, as they wanted to avoid complicating the 
process by too many alternatives. There is no "business-as-
usual" scenario. Nor should the scenarios be taken as policy 
recommendations. The storylines represent the playing out of 
certain social, economic, technological, and environmental 
paradigms, which will be viewed positively by some people 
and negatively by others. The scenarios cover a wide range, but 
not all possible futures. In particular, it was decided that 
possible "surprises" would not be considered and that there 
would be no "disaster" scenarios that are difficult to quantify 
with the aid of formal models. 
The titles of the storyhnes have been kept simple: A l , A2, B l , 
and B2. There is no particular order among the storylines; Box 
TS-1 lists them in alphabetic order. Figure TS-2 schematically 
illustrates the four storylines and scenario families. Each is 
based on a common specification of the main driving forces. 
They are shown, very simplistically, as branches of a two-
dimensional tree. The two dimensions shown indicate the 
global-regional 
and 
the 
development-environmental 
orientation, respectively. In reality, the four scenario families 
share a space of a much higher dimensionality given the 
numerous driving forces and other assumptions needed to 
define any given scenario in a particular modeling approach. 
The team decided to carry out sensitivity tests within some of 
the storylines by considering alternative scenarios with 
different fossil-fuel reserves, rates of economic growth, or rates 
of technical change within a given scenario family. For 
example, four scenario "groups" within the A l scenario family 
were explored. As mentioned, two of these four groups that 
explore fossil-intensive developments in the energy system 
were merged in the SPM. Together with the other three 
scenario families this results in seven groups of scenarios -

four scenario "families" are shown, very simplistically, as 
branches of a two-dimensional tree. In reality, the four 
scenario families share a space of a much higher 
dimensionality given the numerous assumptions needed to 
define any given scenario in a particular modeling approach. 
The 
schematic diagram illustrates that the scenarios build on 
the main driving forces of G H G emissions. Each scenario 
family is based on a common specification of some of the 
main driving forces. The A l storyline branches out into four 
groups of scenarios to illustrate that alternative development 
paths are possible within one scenario family. Two of these 
groups were merged in the 
S P M . 
Box TS-1: The Main Characteristics of the Four SRES Storylines and Scenario Families 
By 2100 the world will have changed in ways that are hard to imagine - as hard as it would have been at the end of the 19th 
century to imagine the changes of the 100 years since. Each storyline assumes a distinctly different direction for future 
developments, such that the four storylines differ in increasingly irreversible ways. Together they describe divergent futures that 
encompass a significant portion of the underlying uncertainties in the main driving forces. They cover a wide range of key 
"future" characteristics such as population growth, economic development, and technological change. For this reason, their 
plausibility or feasibility should not be considered solely on the basis of an extrapolation of c u r r e n t economic, technological, 
and social trends. 
• 
The A l storyline and scenario family describes a future world of very rapid economic growth, low population growth, 
and 
the rapid introduction of new and more efficient technologies. Major underiying themes are convergence among 
regions, capacity building, and increased cultural and social interactions, with a substantial reduction in regional 
differences in per capita income. The A l scenario family develops into four groups that describe alternative directions of 
technological change in the energy system. Two of the fossil-intensive groups were merged in the 
S P M . 
• 
The A 2 storyline and scenario family describes a very heterogeneous world. The underlying theme is self-reliance and 
preservation of local identities. Fertility patterns across regions converge very slowly, which results in high population 
growth. Economic development is primarily regionally oriented and per capita economic growth and technological 
change are more fragmented and slower than in other storylines. 
• 
The B l storyline and scenario family describes a convergent world with the same low population growth as in the A l 
storyline, but with rapid changes in economic structures toward a service and information economy, with reductions in 
material intensity, and the introduction of clean and resource-efficient technologies. The emphasis is on global solutions 
to economic, social, and environmental sustainability, including improved equity, but without additional climate 
initiatives. 
• 
The B2 storyline and scenario family describes a world in which the emphasis is on local solutions to economic, social, 
and 
environmental sustainability. It is a world with moderate population growth, intermediate levels of economic 
development, and less rapid and more diverse technological change than in the B l and A l storylines. While the scenario 
is also oriented toward environmental protection and social equity, it focuses on local and regional levels. 
After determining the basic features and driving forces for each of the four storylines, the team began modeling and quantifying 
the storylines. This resulted in 40 scenarios, each of which constitutes an alternative inteфretation and quantification of a 
storyline. A l l the inteфretations and quantifications associated with a single storyline are called a scenario family (see Chapter 
1 for terminology and Chapter 4 for further details). 
T e c h n i c a l 
Summary 
2 9 
effectively six equally sound groups after the merging of the 
two fossil-intensive groups in the SPM - that share common 
assumptions of some of the key driving forces and are thus not 
independent of each other. 
All four storylines and scenario families describe future worlds 
that are generally more affluent compared to the current 
situation. They range from very rapid economic growth and 
technological change to high levels of environmental 
protection, from low to high global populations, and from high 
to low GHG emissions. What is perhaps even more important 
is that all the storylines describe dynamic changes and 
transitions in generally different directions. Although they do 
not include additional climate initiatives, none of them are 
policy free. As time progresses, the storylines diverge from 
each other in many of their characteristic features. In this way 
they allow us to span the relevant range of GHG emissions and 
different combinations of their main sources. 
7. 
Quantitative Scenarios and Modeling 
Approaches 
The storylines were essentially complete by January 1998. 
After determining the basic features and driving forces for each 
of the four storylines, the six modeling groups represented on 
the writing team (on a voluntary basis) began quantifying 
them. The six modeling groups that quantified the storylines 
are listed in Box TS-2. Each model quantification of a storyline 
constitutes a scenario, and all scenarios derived from one 
storyline constitute a scenario family. The six models are 
representative of different approaches to modeling emissions 
scenarios and different integrated assessment (lA) frameworks 
in the literature and include so-called top-down and bottom-up 
models. The writing team recommends that IPCC or a similar 
international institution should assure participation of 
modeling groups around the world and especially from 
developing countries in any future scenario development and 
assessment efforts. Clearly, this would also require resources 
specifically directed at assisting modeling groups from 
developing countries. Indeed, a concerted effort was made to 
engage modeling groups and experts from developing 
countries in SRES as a direct response to the recommendations 
of the last IPCC scenario evaluation (Alcamo et a l . , 1995). 
The six models have different regional aggregations. The 
writing team decided to group the various global regions into 
four "macro-regions" common to all the different regional 
aggregations across the six models. Box TS-3 indicates that the 
four macro-regions (see Appendix III) are broadly consistent 
with the allocation of countries in the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC, 1992), 
although the correspondence is not exact because of changes in 
the countries listed in Annex I of UNFCCC (1997). 
All the qualitative and quantitative features of scenarios 
belonging to the same family were set to conform to the 
corresponding features of the underlying storyline. Together, 
26 scenarios were "harmonized" to share agreed common 
assumptions about global population and GDP (gross domestic 
product) development (a few that also share common 
population, GDP, and final energy trajectories at the level of the 
four SRES macro-regions are called "fully harmonized," see 
Section 4.1. in Chapter 4). Thus, the harmonized scenarios are 
not independent within each of the four families. However, 
scenarios within each family vary quite substantially in such 
Box TS-2: The Six IVIodeling Teams that Quantified the 40 SRES Scenarios 
In all, six models were used to generate the 40 scenarios: 
• 
Asian Pacific Integrated Model (AIM) 
from the National Institute of Environmental Studies in Japan (Morita et al., 
1994); 
• 
Atmospheric Stabilizafion Framework Model (ASF) from ICF Consulting in the USA (Lashof and Tirpak, 1990; Pepper 
e t a l , 1992, 1998; Sankovski et a l , 2000); 
• 
Integrated Model to Assess the Greenhouse Effect (IMAGE) from the National Institute for Public Health and 
Environmental Hygiene (RIVM) (Alcamo et a l , 1998; de Vries et a l , 1994, 1999, 2000), used m connection with the 
Dutch Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis (СРВ) 
WorldScan model (de Jong and Zalm, 1991), the Netherlands; 
• 
Multiregional Approach for Resource and Industry Allocation (MARIA) from the Science University of Tokyo in Japan 
(Mori and Takahashi, 1999; Mori, 2000); 
• 
Model for Energy Supply Strategy Alternatives and their General Environmental Impact (MESSAGE) from the 
Intemational Institute of Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in Austria (Messner and Strubegger, 1995; Riahi and Roehrl, 
2000); and 
• 
Mini Climate Assessment Model (MiniCAM) from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in the USA 
(Edmonds et a l , 1994, 1996a, 1996b). 
These six models are representative of emissions scenario modeling approaches and different l A frameworks in the literature 
and include so-called top-down and bottom-up models. For a more detailed description of the modeling approaches see

Box TS-3: SRES World "Macro-Regions" Used by All Six Modeling Teams 
The six models have different regional aggregations. The writing team decided to group the various global regions into four 
"macro-regions" common to all the different regional aggregations across the six models. The four macro-regions (see Appendix 
Ш) are broadly consistent with the allocation of the countries in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
(UNFCCC, 1992), although the correspondence is not exact due to changes in the countries listed m Annex I of UNFCCC 
(1997): 
• 
The OECD90 region groups together all countries belongmg to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD) as of 1990, the base year of the participatmg models, and corresponds to Annex II countries under 
UNFCCC (1992). 
• 
The REF region stands for countries undergoing economic reform and groups together the East European countries and 
the Newly Independent States of the former Soviet Union. It includes Armex I countries outside Annex II as defined in 
UNFCCC (1992). 
• 
The ASIA region stands for all developing (non-Annex I) countries m Asia. 
• 
The A L M region stands for rest of the world and includes all developing (non-Annex I) countries in Africa, Latm 
America, and the Middle East. 
In other words, the OECD90 and REF regions together correspond to the developed (industrialised) countries (referred to as 
IND in this report) while the ASIA and A L M regions together correspond to the developing countries (referred to as DEV in 
this report). The OECD90 and REF regions are consistent with the Annex I countries under the Framework Convention on 
Climate Change, while the ASIA and A L M regions correspond to the non-Annex I countries (UNFCCC, 1992). 
characteristics as the assumptions about availability of fossil-
fuel resources, the rate of energy-efficiency improvements, the 
extent of renewable-energy development, and, hence, resultant 
GHG emissions. Thus, after the modeling teams had quantified 
the key driving forces and made an effort to harmonize them 
with the storylines by adjusting control parameters, there still 
remained diversity in the assumptions about the driving forces 
and in the resultant emissions (see Chapter 4). 
The remaining 14 scenarios adopted alternative interprétations 
of the four scenario storylines to explore additional scenario 
uncertainties beyond differences in méthodologie approaches, 
such as different rates of economic growth and variations in 
population projections. These variations reflect the "modeling 
teams' choice" of alternative but plausible global and regional 
development compaied to "harmonized" scenarios and also 
stem from the differences in the underlying modeling 
approaches. Each of the 40 quantifications of one of the 
storylines constitutes a SRES scenario. This approach 
generated a large variation and richness in different scenario 
quantifications, often with overlapping ranges of main driving 
forces and GHG emissions across the four families. 
In addition, the A l scenario family branched out into four 
distinct scenario groups. They are based on four alternative 
technological developments in future energy systems, from 
carbon-intensive development to decaibonization. Sitnilar 
storyline variations were considered for other scenario 
families, but they did not result in genuine scenario groupings 
within the respective families. This further increased richness 
in different GHG and SO2 emissions paths, because this 
variation in the structure of the future energy systems in itself 
resulted in a range of emissions almost as large as that 
generated through the variation of other main driving forces 
such as population and economic development. It should be 
noted that future energy systems variations could be applied to 
the other storylines, but they may evolve differentiy from those 
in A l . They have been introduced into the A l storyline because 
of its "high growth with high technology" nature, where 
difterences in alternative technology developments translate 
into large differences in future G H G emission levels. 
Altogether the 40 SRES scenarios fall into seven groups: the 
three scenario families, A2, B l , and B2, plus four groups 
within the A l scenario. In the SPM, two of these groups, the 
coal and gas and oil intensive groups, were merged into one 
fossil-intensive group, leading to six groups. 
As in the case of the storylines, no single scenario - whether it 
represents a modeler's choice or hatmonized assumptions -
was treated as being more or less "probable" than the others 
belonging to the same family. Initially, for each storyline, one 
modeling group was given principal responsibility, and the 
quantification produced by that group is retened to as the 
"marker" scenario for that storyline. The four preliminary 
marker scenarios were used in 1998 to solicit comments during 
the "open process" and as input for climate modelers in 
accordance with a decision of the IPCC Bureau in 1998. The 
four marker scenarios were posted on the SRES web site 
(www.sres.ciesin) in June 1998 and were subsequently revised 
to account for comments and suggestions received tlirough this 
open scenario review process that lasted until January 1999. In 
addition to many revisions, the marker scenarios were also 
harmonized along with the other 26 scenarios that adopted 
common assumptions for the main driving forces within the 
four respective families. The choice of the markers was based 
on extensive discussion of: 
Technical 
Summary 
3 1 
• 
range of emissions across all of marker scenarios; 
• 
which of the initial quantifications (by the modelers) 
reflected the storyline best; 
• 
preference of some of the modeling teams and features 
of specific models; 
• 
use of four different models for the four markers. 
As a result the markers were not intended to be the median or 
mean scenarios from their respective families. Indeed, in general 
it proved impossible to develop scenarios in which all relevant 
characteristics match mean or median values. Thus, marker 
scenarios are no more or less likely than any other scenarios, but 
are those scenarios considered by the SRES writing team as 
illustrative of a parficular storyline. These scenarios have 
received the closest scrutiny of the entire writing team and via 
the SRES open process 
compared to other 
scenario 
quantifications. The marker scenarios are also those SRES 
scenarios that have been most intensively tested in terms of 
reproducibility. As a rule, different modeling teams have 
attempted to replicate the model quantification of marker 
scenarios. Available time and resources have not allowed a 
similar exercise to be conducted for all SRES scenarios, 
although some effort was devoted to reproduce the four scenario 
groups (merged into three in the SPM) that constitute different 
interpretations of the A l storyline with different models. 
Additional scenarios using the same harmonized assumptions 
as the marker scenarios developed by different modeling teams 
and other scenarios that give alternative quantitative 
inteфretations of the four storylines constitute the final set of 
40 SRES scenarios. This also means that the 40 scenarios are 
not independent of each other as they are all based on four 
storylines and subdivided into seven scenario groups (after 
merging two groups, six in the SPM) that share many common 
assumptions. In addition to many revisions of the marker and 
other harmonized scenarios, other ahemative scenarios were 
foiTuulated by the six modeling teams within each of the four 
scenario famiUes. The result is a more complete, refined set of 
40 emissions scenarios that reflects the broad spectrum of 
modeling approaches and regional perspectives. However, 
differences in modeling approaches have meant that not all of 
the scenarios provide estimates for all the direct and indirect 
GHG emissions for all the sources and sectors. In addition to 
the marker scenarios, two scenarios were also selected in the 
SPM to illustrate the alternative energy systems developments 
in the AI family. Hence, this report has an illustrative scenario 
for each of the six scenario groups in the SPM. The four SRES 
marker scenarios and the two illustrative scenarios (selected in 
the SPM) cover all the relevant gas species and emission 
categories comprehensively and thus constitute the smallest set 
of independent and fully documented SRES scenarios. 
The scenario groups and cumulative emissions categories were 
developed as the smallest subsets of SRES scenarios that 
capture the range of uncertainties associated with driving 
forces and emissions. Together, the four markers and the two 
additional illustrative scenarios selected in the SPM from the 
AI scenario groups constitute the set of SRES scenarios that 
reflects the uncertainty ranges in the emissions and their 
driving forces. Furthermore, the writing team recommends 
that, to the extent possible, these scenarios, but at least the four 
markers and the two additional illustrative scenarios selected in 
the SPM, should always be used together, and that, in general, 
no individual scenario should be singled out for any puipose. 
Multiple baselines and overlapping emissions ranges have 
important implications for making policy analysis, e.g., similar 
policies might have different impacts in different scenarios. 
Combination of policies might shape the future development in 
the direction of certain scenarios. 
8. 
Main Scenario Driving Forces Based on the 
Literature 
The 
scenarios cover a wide range of driving forces, from 
demographic to social and economic developments. This 
section summarizes the assumptions on important scenario 
drivers. For simplicity, only three of these are presented 
separately here following the exposition in Chapters 2, 3, and 
4. Nonetheless, it is important to keep in mind that the future 
evolution of these and other main driving forces is interrelated 
in the SRES scenarios (see Tables TS-2 and TS-3 for a 
summary of the ranges of the main driving forces across the 
scenario groups in 2100). 
The SRES scenarios span a wide range of assumptions for the 
most salient scenario drivers, and thus reflect the uncertainty of 
the future. Evidently, views of the future are a time-specific 
phenomenon, and this report and its scenarios are no exception. 
However, it is important to emphasize that this is an explicit 
part of the Terms of Reference for the SRES writing team - to 
reflect a range of views, based on current knowledge and the 
most recently available literature (see Appendix I). The 
scenario quantification results reflect well the literature range, 
except for extreme scenarios. 
8 . 1 . 
Population 
Projections 
Three different population trajectories were chosen for SRES 
scenarios to reflect future demographic uncertainties based on 
published population projections (Lutz, 1996; UN, 1998; see 
Chapter 3). The population projections are exogenous input to 
all the models used to develop the SRES scenarios. The models 
used do not develop population from other assumptions within 
the model. Figure TS-3 shows the three population projections 
in comparison with the three population projections used in the 
IS92 scenarios. Global population ranges between seven and 
15 billion people by 2100 across the scenarios, depending on 
the rate and extent of the demographic transition. The insert in 
Figure TS-3 shows population development in the developed 
(industrialized) regions. The range of future populations is 
smaller than in the IS92 scenarios, particularly in the 
developed (industrialized) regions, for which the lowest 
scenario indicates a very modest population decline compared 
to IS92 scenarios. The greatest uncertainty about future growth 
32 
T e c h n i c a l 
Summary 
lies in the developing regions across all scenarios in the 
literature. An equally pervasive trend across all scenarios is 
urbanization (see Chapter 3). Altogether, three different 
population projections were used in the 26 harmonized 
scenarios. Other scenarios explored alternative population 
projections consistent with the storylines. 
The lowest population trajectory is assumed for the A l and B l 
scenario families and is based on the low population projection 
in Lutz (1996), which combines low fertility with low 
mortality and central migration rate assumptions. After 
peaking at 8.7 billion in the middle of the 2P' century, world 
population declines to 7.1 billion by the year 2100. As 
discussed in Chapters 3 and 4, this population development is 
somewhat higher than the previous low population used in the 
IS92 scenarios. The B2 scenario family is based on the U N 
median 1998 population projection (UN, 1998). The global 
population mercases to about 9.4 billion people by 2050 and to 
about 10.4 billion by 2100. This population scenario is 
characteristic of recent median global population projections, 
which describe a continuation of historical trends toward a 
completion of the demographic transition that would lead to a 
constant global population, and is consistent with recent faster 
fertility declines in the world together with declining mortality 
rates. Hence, the population is somewhat lower than previous 
U N median projections, as used in the IS92 scenarios. This 
median scenario projects very low population growth in 
today's industrialized countries, with stabilization of growth in 
Asia in the second half of the 2P' century and in the rest of the 
world towards the end of the 2P' century. The A2 scenario 
family is based on the high population growth of 15 billion by

low, and UN, 1998, for medium) and 
IPCC IS92 scenarios (Leggett et a l , 
1992; Pepper et a i , 1992) from 1990 
to 2100. 
2100 reported in Lutz (1996), which assumes a significant 
decline in fertility for most regions and a stabilization at above 
replacement levels. It falls below the long-term 1998 U N high 
projection of 18 billion. It is also lower than in the highest IS92 
scenario (17.6 billion by 2100). Nevertheless, this scenario 
represents very high population growth compared with that in 
current demographic literature. Some demographers attach a 
probability of more than 90% that actual population will be 
lower than the trajectory adopted in the A2 scenario family 
(Lutz et a l . , 1997). A more detailed discussion of the 
population projections used to quantify the four scenario 
families is given in Chapters 3 and 4.

Economic 
Development 
The 
SRES scenarios span a wide range of future levels of 
economic activity (expressed in gross world product). The A l 
scenario family with a "harmonized" gross world product of 
US$529 trillion (all values in 1990 US dollars unless otherwise 
indicated) in 2100 delineates the SRES upper bound, whereas 
B2 with "harmonized" US$235 trillion in 2100 represents its 
lower bound. The range of gross world product across all 
scenarios is even higher, from US$197 to 550 by 2100. 
Although the SRES scenarios span a wide range, still lower 
and higher gross world product levels can be found in the 
literature (see Chapters 2, 3, and 4). Uncertainties in future 
gross world product levels are governed by the pace of future 
productivity growth and population growth, especially in 
developing regions. Different assumptions on conditions and

possibilities for development "catch-up" and for narrowing 
per capita income gaps in particular explain the wide range in 
projected future gross world product levels. Given a 
qualitatively negative relationship between population growth 
and per capita income growth discussed in Chapters 2 and 3, 
uncertainties in future population growth rates tend to narrow 
the range of associated gross world product projections. High 
population growth would, c e t e r i s p a r i b u s , lower per capita 
income growth, whereas low population growth would tend to 
increase it. This relationship is evident in empiric data - high 
per capita income countries are generally also those that have 
completed their demographic transition. The affluent live long 
and generally have few children. (Exceptions are some 
countries with small populations, high birth rates, and 
significant 
income 
from 
commodity 
exports.) 
This 
relationship between affluence and longevity again identiñes 
development as one of the most important indicators of human 
well being. Yet even assuming this relationship holds for an 
extended time into the future, its quantification is subject to 
considerable theoretic and empkic uncertainties (Alcamo et 
a i , 1995). 
Two of the SRES scenario families, A I and B l , explicitiy 
explore alternative pathways to gradually close existing income 
gaps. As a reflection of uncertainty, development catch-up 
diverges in terms of geographically distinct economic growth 
patterns across the four SRES scenario families. Table TS-I 
summarizes per capita income for SRES and IS92 scenarios for 
the four SRES world regions. SRES scenarios indicate a smaller 
difference between the now industrialized and developing 
countries compared with the IS92 scenarios. This tendency 
toward a substantially narrower income "gap" compared with 
the IS92 scenarios overcomes one of the major shortcomings of 
the previous IPCC scenarios cited in the literature (Parikh, 
1992).

S t r u c t u r a l and Technological 
Change 
In this brief summary of the SRES scenarios, structural and 
technological changes are illustrated by using energy and land 
use as examples. These examples are characteristic for the 
driving forces of emissions because the energy system and land 
use are the major sources of G H G and sulfur emission.

Renewables/Nuclear 
Figure TS-4: Global primary energy structure, shares (%) of oil and gas, coal, and non-fossil (zero-carbon) energy sources -
historical development from 1850 to 1990 and in SRES scenarios. Each comer of the triangle corresponds to a hypothetical 
situation in which all primary energy is supplied by a single source - oil and gas on the top, coal to the left, and non-fossil 
sources (renewables and nuclear) to the right. Constant market shares of these energies are denoted by their respective isoshare 
lines. Historical data from 1850 to 1990 are based on Nakicenovic et a l . (1998). For 1990 to 2100, alternative trajectories show 
the changes in the energy systems structures across SRES scenarios. They are grouped by shaded areas for the scenario 
families A l B , A2, B l , and B2 with respective markers shown as lines. In addition, the four scenario groups within the A l 
family A l B , A l C , A I G , and AIT, which explore different technological developments in the energy systems, are shaded 
individually. In the SPM, A l C and A I G are combined into one fossil-intensive group AlFI. For comparison the 1S92 scenario 
series are also shown, clustering along two trajectories (IS92c,d and IS92a,b,e,f). For model results that do not include non-
commercial energies, the corresponding estimates from the emulations of the various marker scenarios by the MESSAGE 
model were added to the original model outputs. 
Chapter 4 gives a more detailed treatment of the full range of 
emissions driving forces across the SRES scenarios. 
Figure TS-4 illustrates that the change of world primary energy 
structure diverges over time. It shows the contributions of 
individual primary energy sources - the percentage supplied by 
coal, that by oil and gas, and that by all non-fossil sources 
taken together (for simplicity of presentation and because not 
all models distinguish between renewables and nuclear 
energy). Each corner of the triangle corresponds to a 
hypothetical situation in which all primary energy is supplied 
by a single source - oil and gas at the top, coal to the left, and 
non-fossil sources (renewables and nuclear) to the right. 
Historically, the primary energy structure has evolved 
clockwise according to the two "grand transitions" (discussed 
in Chapter 3) that are shown by the two segments of the "thick 
black" curve. From 1850 to 1920 the first transition can be 
characterized as the substitution of traditional (non-fossil) 
energy sources by coal. The share of coal increased from 20% 
to about 70%, while the share of non-fossils declined from 
80% to about 20%. The second transition, from 1920 to 1990, 
can be characterized as the replacement of coal by oil and gas 
(while the share of non-fossils remained essentially constant). 
The share of oil and gas increased to about 50% and the share 
of coal declined to about 30%.

Summary

regrouped into tlieir respective scenario families and four A l 
scenarios groups (three in the SPM) that explore different 
technological developments in the energy systems. The SRES 
scenarios cover a wider range of energy structures than the 
previous IS92 scenario series, which reflects advances in 
knowledge on the uncertainty ranges of future fossil resource 
availability and technological change. 
In a clockwise direction, A l B , AIT, and B l scenario groups 
map the structural transitions toward higher shares of non-
fossil energy in the future, which almost closes the historical 
"loop" that started in 1850. The B2 scenarios indicate a more 
"moderate" direction of change with about half of the energy 
coming from non-fossil sources and the other half shared by 
coal on one side and oil and gas on the other. Finally, the A2 
scenario group marks a stark transition back to coal. Shares of 
oil and gas decline while non-fossils increase moderately. 
What is perhaps more significant than the diverging 
developments in these three marker scenarios is that the whole 
set of 40 scenarios covers virtually all possible directions of 
change, from high shares of oil and gas to high shares of coal 
and non-fossils. In particular, the A l scenario family covers 
basically the same range of structural change as all the other 
scenarios together. In contrast, the IS 92 scenarios cluster into 
two groups, one of which contains IS92c and IS92d and the 
other the four others. In all of these the share of oil and gas 
declines, and the main structural change occurs between coal 
on the one hand and non-fossils on the other. This divergent 
nature in the structural change of the energy system and in the 
underlying technological base of the SRES results in a wide 
span of future GHG and sulfur emissions.

extent than today to one category - 60% to cropland and energy biomass at the top, 80% to forests to the left, and 80% to 
other categories (including grasslands) to the right. Constant shares in total land area of cropland and energy biomass, forests, 
and other categories are denoted by their respective isoshare lines. For 1990 to 2100, alternative trajectories are shown for the 
SRES scenarios. The three marker scenarios A l B , B l , and B2 are shown as thick colored lines, and other SRES scenarios as 
thin colored lines. The ASF model used to develop the A2 marker scenario projects only land-use change related GHG 
emissions. Comparable data on land cover changes are therefore not available.The trajectories appear to be largely model 
specific and illustrate the different views and interpretations of future land-use patterns across the scenarios (e.g. the scenario 
trajectories on the right that illustrate larger increases in grasslands and decreases in cropland are MiniCAM results). 
3 6 
T e c h n i c a l 
Summary 
Figure TS-5 
illustrates that land-use patterns are also diverging 
over time. It shows the main land-use categories - the 
percentages of total land area use that constitute the forests, the 
joint shares of cropland and energy biomass, and all the other 
categories including grasslands. As for the energy triangle in 
Figure TS-4, in Figure TS-5 each comer coiTesponds to a 
hypothetical situation in which land use is dedicated to a much 
greater extent than today to two of the three land-use categories 
- 40% to cropland and energy biomass and 20% to forests at 
the top, 60% to forests and 40% to other categories (including 
grasslands) to the left, and 80% to other categories (including 
grasslands) to the right. 
In most scenarios, the current trend of shrinking forests is 
eventually reversed because of slower population growth and 
increased agricultural productivity. Reversals of deforestation 
trends are strongest in the В1 and A l families. In the В1 family 
pasture lands decrease significantly because of increased 
productivity in livestock management and dietary shifts away 
from meat, thus illustrating the importance of both 
technological and social developments. 
The main driving forces for land-use changes are related to 
increasing demands for food because of a growing population 
and changing diets. In addition, numerous other social, 
economic, and institutional factors govern land-use changes 
such as deforestation, expansion of cropland areas, or their 
reconversion back to forest cover (see Chapter 3). Global food 
production can be increased, either through intensification (by 
multi-cropping, raising cropping intensity, applying fertilizers, 
new seeds, improved farming technology) or through land 
expansion (cultivating land, converting forests). Especially in 
developing countries, there are many examples of the potential 
to intensify food production in a more or less ecological way 
(e.g. multi-cropping; agroforestry) that may not lead to higher 
GHG emissions. 
Different assumptions on these processes translate into 
alternative scenarios of future land-use changes and G H G 
emissions, most notably CO^, methane (CH^), and nitrous 
oxide (NjO). A distinguishing characteristic of several models 
(e.g., AIM, IMAGE, MARIA, and MiniCAM) used in SRES is 
the explicit modeling of land-use changes caused by expanding 
biomass uses and hence exploration of possible land-use 
conflicts between energy and agricuhural sectors. The 
corresponding scenarios of land-use changes are illustrated in 
Figure TS-5 for all SRES scenarios. In some contrast to the 
structural changes in energy systems shown in Figure TS-4, 
different land-use scenarios in Figure TS-5 appear to be rather 
model specific, following the general trends as indicated by the 
respective marker scenario developed with a particular model.

Greenhouse Gases and Sulfur Emissions 
The SRES scenarios generally cover the full range of GHG and 
sulfur emissions consistent with the storylines and the 
underlying range of driving forces from studies in the 
literature, as documented in the SRES database. This section 
summarizes the emissions of CO2, CH^, and SO,. For 
simplicity, only these three important gases are presented 
separately, following the more detailed exposition in Chapter 5 
(see Table TS-4 for a summary of the ranges of emissions 
across the scenario groups).

Figure TS-6 illustrates the CO2 emissions across the SRES 
scenarios in relation to each of the thi-ee main scenario driving 
forces - global population, gross world product and primary 
energy requirements. The general tendencies across the driving 
forces are consistent with the underlying literature. A l l else 
being equal, the higher future global populations, higher gross 
world product, or higher primary energy requirements would 
be associated with higher emissions. However, it is important 
to note that the range of emissions is large across the whole 
range of driving forces considered in SRES, indicating the 
magnitude of the uncertainty associated with emission 
scenarios. For instance, emissions can range widely for any 
given level of future population (e.g. between 5 to 20 GtC in 
case of a low population scenario of seven billion by 2100). 
Conversely, emissions in the range of 20 GtC are possible with 
global population levels ranging from seven to 15 billion by 
2100. 
While the SRES scenarios do not map all possibilities, 
they do indicate general tendencies, with an uncertainty range 
consistent with the underlying literature. This emphasizes an 
important SRES conclusion: alternative combinations of main 
scenario driving forces can lead to similar levels of GHGs 
emissions by the end of the 2P' century. Alternatively, similar 
future worlds with respect to socio-economic developments 
can 
result in wide differences in future GHGs emissions, 
primarily as a result of alternative technological developments. 
This suggests that technology is at least as important a driving 
force of future G H G emissions as population and economic 
development across the set of 40 SRES scenarios.

Figure TS-7 illustrates the range of COj emissions of the SRES 
scenarios against the background of all the IS92 scenaiios and 
other emissions scenarios from the literature documented in the 
SRES scenario database (blue shaded area). The range of 
future emissions is very large so that the highest scenarios 
envisage a tenfold increase of global emissions by 2100 while 
the lowest have emissions lower than today. 
The 
literature includes scenarios with additional climate 
initiatives and policies, which are also referred to as mitigation 
or intervention scenarios. As shown in Chapter 2, many 
ambiguities are associated with the classification of emissions 
scenarios into those that include additional climate initiatives 
and those that do not. Many cannot be classified in this way on

historical development from 1900 to 1990 and in 40 SRES scenarios from 1990 to 2100, shown as an index (1990 = 1). The 
range is large in the base year 1990, as indicated by an "error" bar, but is excluded from the indexed future emissions paths. 
The dashed time-paths depict individual SRES scenarios and the blue shaded area the range of scenarios from the literature (as 
documented in the SRES database). The median (50*), 5*, and 95* percentiles of the frequency distribution are shown. The 
statistics associated with the distribution of scenarios do not imply probability of occurrence (e.g., the frequency distribution of 
the scenarios in the literature may be influenced by the use of IS92a as a reference for many subsequent studies). The 40 SRES 
scenarios are classified into six groups (that result after A l C and A I G are combined into one fossil-intensive group AlFI, as in 
the SPM), which constitute four scenario families and three A l scenario groups. Jointly the scenarios span most of the range of 
the scenarios in the literature. The emissions profiles are dynamic, ranging from continuous increases to those that curve 
through a maximum and then decline. The colored vertical bars indicate the range of the four SRES scenario families in 2100. 
Also shown as vertical bars on the right of Figure TS-7a are the ranges of emissions in 2100 of IS92 scenarios and of scenai-ios 
from the literature that apparentiy include additional climate initiatives (designated as "intervention" scenarios emissions 
range), those that do not ("non-intervention"), and those that cannot be assigned to either of these two categories ("non-
classified").^ Three vertical bars in Figure TS-7b indicate the range of IS92 land-use emissions in 2025, 2050, and 2100.

basis of the infonnation available from the SRES scenario 
database and the published literature. 
Figure TS-7a indicates the ranges of emissions in 2100 from 
scenarios that apparently include additional climate initiatives 
(designated as "intervention" emissions range), those that do 
not ("non-intervention"), and those that cannot be assigned to 
either of these two categories ("non-classified"). This 
classification is based on the subjective evaluation of the 
scenarios in the database by the members of the writing team 
and is explained in Section 5 and in Chapter 2 in greater detail. 
It should be noted that the distributions of emissions of 
scenarios from the literature is asymmetric (see the emissions 
histogram in Figure 6-5 in Chapter 6) and that the thin tail that 
extends above 30 GtC by 2100 includes only a few scenarios. 
Figure TS-7a shows the ranges of emissions of the four 
families (vertical bars next to each of the four marker 
scenarios), which illustrate that the scenario groups by 
themselves cover a large portion of the overall scenario 
distribution. Together, they cover much of the range of future 
emissions, both with respect to the scenarios in the literature 
and all SRES scenarios. Adding all other scenarios increases 
the covered range. For example, the SRES scenarios span 
jointly from the 95* percentile to just above the 5* percentile 
of the distribution of energy and industry emissions scenarios 
from the literature. This illustrates again that they only exclude 
the most extreme emissions scenarios found in the literature 
that are situated out in the tails of the distribution. What is 
perhaps more important is that each of the four scenario 
families covers a substantial part of this distribution. This leads 
to a substantial overlap in the emissions ranges of the four 
scenario families. In other words, a similar quantification of 
driving forces can lead to a wide range of future emissions and 
a given level of future emissions can result from different 
combinations of driving forces. This result is of fundamental 
importance for the assessments of climate change impacts and 
possible mitigation and adaptation strategies. Thus, it warrants 
some fuither discussion. 
Another inteipretation is that a given combination of the main 
driving forces, such as the population and economic growth, is 
not sufficient to determine the future emissions paths. Different 
modeling approaches and different specifications of other 
scenario assumptions overshadow the influence of the main 
driving forces. A particular combination of driving forces, such 
as specified in the A l scenario family, is associated with a 
whole range of possible emission paths from energy and 
industry. The nature of climate change impacts and adaptation 
and mitigation strategies would be fundamentally different 
depending on whether emissions are high or low, given a 
particular combination of scenario driving forces. Thus, the 
implication is that the whole range needs to be considered in 
the assessments of climate change, from high emissions and 
driving forces to low ones. 
The A l scenario family explored variations in energy systems 
most explicitly and hence covers the largest part of the scenario 
distribution shown in Figure TS-7a, from the 95* to just above 
the 10"' percentile. The A l scenario family includes four 
groups of scenarios that explore different structures of future 
energy systems, from carbon-intensive development paths to 
high rates of decarbonization. Two of the fossil-intensive 
groups were merged into one group, as in SPM, resulting in 
three A l groups. A l l A l groups otherwise share the same 
assumptions about the main driving forces (see Chapter 6 and 
for further detail Chapters 4 and 5). This indicates that different 
structures of the energy system can lead to basically the same 
variation in future emissions as generated by different 
combinations of the other main driving forces - population, 
economic activities, and energy consumption levels. The 
implication is that decarbonization of energy systems - the 
shift from carbon-intensive to less carbon-intensive and 
carbon-free sources of energy - is of similar importance in 
detemiining the futme emissions paths as other driving forces. 
Sustained decarbonization requires the development and 
successful diffusion of new technologies. Thus investments in 
new technologies during the coming decades might have the 
same order of influence on future emissions as population 
growth, economic development, and levels of energy 
consumption taken together. 
Figure TS-7b shows that CO2 emissions from deforestation 
peak in many SRES scenarios after several decades and 
subsequently gradually decline. This pattern is consistent with 
many scenarios in the literature and can be associated with 
slowing population growth and increasing agricultural 
productivity. These allow a reversal of cuiTent deforestation 
trends, leading to eventual COj sequestration. Emissions 
decline fastest in the В1 family. Only in the A2 family do net 
anthropogenic COj emissions from land use remain positive 
through to 2100. As was the case for energy-related emissions, 
CO2 emissions related to land-use in the A l family cover the 
widest range. The range of land-use emissions across the IS92 
scenarios is narrower in comparison.

This comparison of SRES scenario characteristics implies that 
similar future emissions can result from very different socio­
economic developments, and similar developments of driving 
forces can result in different future emissions. Uncertainties in 
the future development of key emission driving forces create 
large uncertainties in future emissions even within the same 
socio-economic development paths. Therefore, emissions from 
each scenario family overlap substantially with emissions from 
other scenario families. 
To facilitate comparisons of emissions and their driving forces 
across the scenarios, the writing team grouped them into four 
categories of cumulative emissions between 1990 and 2100. 
However, any categorization of scenarios based on emissions 
of multiple gases is quite difficult. Figure TS-8 shows total COj 
emissions from all sources (from Figures TS-7a and b). The 40 
scenarios are shown aggregated into six groups, three for the A l

Scenarios are also presented for the three constituent groups of the A l family (fossil-intensive A l F I group, resulting by

family (that resuh by merging the two fossil-intensive groups 
A l C and A I G into one A l F I group as in the SPM). The 
scenarios that remain outside the six groups adopted alternative 
interpretations of the four scenario storylines. The emission 
trajectories ("bands") of the scenario groups display different 
dynamics, from monotonie increases to non-linear trajectories 
in which there is a subsequent decline from a maximum. The 
dynamics of the individual scenarios are also different across 
gasses, sectors, or world regions. This particularly diminishes 
the significance of focusing scenario categorization on any 
given year, such as 2100. In addition, all gases that contribute to 
radiative forcing should be considered, but methods of 
combming gases such as the use of global warming potentials 
(GWPs) are appropriate only for near-term GHG inventories^. 
In light of these difficulties, the classification approach 
In particular, in the IPCC WGI Second Assessment Report (SAR) 
GWPs are calculated for constant concentrations (Houghton et al., 
1996). In long-term scenarios, concentrations 
may 
change 
significantly, as do GWP values. It is unclear how to apply GWPs to 
long-tenn scenarios in a meaningful manner. In addition, the GWP 
approach is not applicable to gases such as SOj and ozone precursors. 
presented here uses cumulative COj emissions between 1990 
and 2100. CO2 is the dominant GHG and cumulative CO2 
emissions are expected to be roughly proportional to COj 
radiative forcing over the time scale of a century. According to 
the IPCC SAR, "any eventual stabilized concentration is 
governed more by the accumulated anthropogenic CO2 
emissions from now until the time of stabilization than by the 
way emissions change over the period" (Houghton et a l . , 1996). 
Therefore, the writing team also grouped the scenarios 
according to their cumulative emissions. 
Cumulative SRES carbon emissions through to 2100 range 
from less than 800 GtC to more than 2500 GtC with a median 
of about 1500 GtC. To represent this range, the scenario 
classification uses four intervals as follows: less than 1100 GtC 
(low), between 1100 and 1450 GtC (medium-low), between 
1450 and 1800 GtC (medium-high), and greater than 1800 
GtC (high). Each COj interval contains multiple scenarios and 
scenarios from more than one family. Each category also 
includes one of the four marker scenarios. Figure TS-9 shows 
how cumulative carbon emissions from the 40 SRES scenarios 
fit within the selected emission intervals (see Chapter 4 for 
further details). The 40 SRES scenarios extend the IS92 range

Figure TS-9: Global cumulative CO2 emissions (GtC, standardized). The ranges of cumulative emissions for the SRES 
scenarios are shown. Scenarios are grouped into four categories: low, medium-low, medium-high, and high emissions. Each 
category contains one marker scenario plus alternatives that lead to comparable cumulative emissions, although often through 
different driving forces. The ranges of cumulative emissions of the six SRES scenario groups are shown as colored vertical 
bars and the range of the IS92 scenarios as a black vertical bar. 
toward higher emissions (SRES maximum of 2570 GtC 
compared to 2140 GtC for IS92), but not toward lower 
emissions. The lower bound for both scenario sets is just below 
800 GtC. 
This categorization can guide comparisons using either 
scenarios with different driving forces yet similar emissions, 
or scenarios with similar driving forces but different 
emissions. This characteristic of SRES scenarios also has very 
important implications for the assessment of climate-change 
impacts, mitigation, and adaptation strategies. Two future 
worlds with fundamentally different characteristic features, 
such as the A l B and B2 marker scenarios, also have different 
cumulative CO2 emissions and radiative forcing, but very 
similar CO2 emissions in 2100. In contrast, scenarios that are 
in the same category of cumulative emissions can have 
fundamentally different driving forces and different CO2 
emissions in 2100, but very similar cumulative emissions and 
radiative forcing. Presumably, adverse impacts and effective 
adaptation measures would vary among the scenarios from 
different families that share similar cumulative emissions but 
have 
different 
demographic, 
socio-economic, 
and 
technological driving forces. This is another reason for 
considering the entire range of emissions in 
future 
assessments of climate change. 
9.2. 
Other 
Greenhouse 
Gases 
Of the GHGs, CO2 is the main contributor to anthropogenic 
radiative forcing because of changes in concentrations from 
pre-industrial times. According to Houghton et a l . (1996) well-
mixed GHGs (CO2, 
CH4, N2O, and the halocarbons) induced 
additional radiative forcing of around 2.5 W/m^ on a global and 
annually averaged basis. CO2 accounted for 60% of the total, 
which indicates that the other GHGs are significant as well. 
Whereas C O ^ emissions are by-and-large attributable to two 
major sources, energy consumption and land-use change, other 
emissions arise from many different sources and a large number 
of sectors and applications (e.g. see Table 5-3 in Chapter 5). 
The SRES emissions scenarios also have different emissions 
for other GHGs and chemically active species such as CO, 
NO J,, nitrogen oxides, and NMVOCs. The uncertainties that 
surround the emissions sources of the other GHGs, and the 
more complex set of driving forces behind them are 
considerable and unresolved. Therefore, the models and 
approaches employed for the SRES analyses cannot produce 
unambiguous and generally approved estimates for different 
sources and world regions over a century. Keeping these 
caveats above in mind, Table TS-4 (see later) shows the 
emissions of all relevant direct and indirect GHGs for the four 
marker scenarios and, in brackets, the range of the other 
scenarios in the same family (or scenario groups for the A I 
42 
T e c h n i c a l 
Summary 
family). Chapter 5 gives further detail about the full range of 
GHG emissions across the SRES scenarios. The emissions of 
other gases follow dynamic patterns much like those shown in 
Figures TS-7 and TS-8 for carbon dioxide emissions. A 
summary of GHG emissions is given in Chapter 6 and further 
details in Chapter 5. 
9 . 2 . 1 . 
M e t h a n e 
E m i s s i o n s 
Anthropogenic CH^ emissions arise from a variety of activities, 
dominated by biologic processes, each associated with 
considerable uncertainty. The future CH^ emissions in the 
scenarios depend in part on the consumption of fossil fuels, 
adjusted for assumed changes in technology and operational 
practices, but more strongly on scenario-specific, regional 
demographic and affluence developments, together with 
assumptions on preferred diets and agricultural practices. The 
writing team recommends further research into the sources and 
modeling 
approaches 
to 
capture 
large 
uncertainties 
surrounding future CH^ emissions. 
The resuhant CH^ emission trajectories for the four SRES 
scenario families portray complex patterns (as displayed in 
Figure 5-5 in Chapter 5). For example, the emissions in A2 and 
B2 marker scenarios increase throughout the whole time 
horizon to the year 2100. Increases are most pronounced in the 
high population A2 scenarios where emissions rise to between 
549 and 1069 (A2 marker: 900) MtCH^ by 2100, compared to 
310 MtCH4 in 1990. The emissions range by 2100 in the B2 
scenarios is between 465 and 613 (B2 marker: 600) MtCH^. In 
the A I B and B l marker scenarios, the CH^emissions level off 
and subsequently decline sooner or later in the 2P' century. 
This phenomenon is most pronounced in the A I B marker, in 
which the fastest growth in the first few decades is followed by 
the steepest decline; the 2100 level ends up slightly below the 
current emission of 310 MtCH^. The range of emissions in 
Table TS-4 indicates that alternative developments in energy 
technologies and resources could yield a higher range in CH^ 
emissions compared to the "balanced" technology A I B 
scenario group that includes the A I B marker scenario 
discussed above. In the fossil-intensive A l F I group (combined 
from A I C and A I G groups, as in the SPM), CH^ emissions 
could reach some 735 MtCH^ by 2100, whereas in the post-
fossil A I T scenario group emissions are con'espondingly lower 
(some 300 MtCH4 
2100). Interestingly, the A l scenarios 
generally have comparatively low CH^ emissions from non-
energy sources because of a combination of low population 
growth and rapid advances in agricultural productivity. Hence 
the SRES scenarios extend the uncertainty range of the IS92 
scenario series somewhat toward lower emissions. However, 
both scenario sets indicate an upper bound of emissions of 
some 1000 MtCH^ by 2100. 
9.2.2. 
N i t r o u s O x i d e 
E m i s s i o n s 
Even more than for CH^, the assumed future food supply will 
be a key determinant of future 
emissions. Size, age 
structure, and regional spread of the global population will be 
reflected 
in the emission trajectories, 
together 
with 
assumptions on diets and improvements in agricultural 
practices. Other things being equal, N2O emissions are 
generally highest in the high population scenario family A2. 
Importantly, as the largest anthropogenic source of NjO 
(cultivated soils) is already very uncertain in the base year, all 
future emission trajectories are affected by large uncertainties, 
especially if calculated with different models as is the case in 
this SRES report. Therefore, the writing team recommends 
further research into the sources and modeling of long-term 
NjO emissions. Uncertainty ranges are correspondingly large, 
and are sometimes asymmetric. For example, while the range in 
2100 reported in all A l scenarios is between 5 and 10 MtN (7 
MtN in the A I B marker), the A2 marker reports 17 MtN in 
2100. Other A2 scenarios report emissions that fall within the 
range reported for A l (from 8 to 19 MtN in 2100). Thus, 
different model representations of processes that lead to N2O 
emissions and uncertainties in source strength can outweigh 
easily any underlying differences between individual scenarios 
in terms of population growth, economic development, etc. 
Different assumptions with respect to future crop productivity, 
agricultural practices, and associated emission factors, 
especially in the very populous regions of the world, explain the 
very different global emission levels even for otherwise shared 
main scenario drivers. Hence, the SRES scenarios extend the 
uncertainty range of future emissions significantly toward 
higher emissions (4.8 to 20.2 MtN by 2100 in SRES compared 
to 5.4 to 10.8 MtN in the IS92 scenaiios. (Note that natural 
sources are excluded in this comparison.) 
9.2.3. 
H a l o c a r b o n s a n d H a l o g e n a t e d 
C o m p o u n d s 
The emissions of halocarbons (chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), 
hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), halons, methylbromide, 
and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)) and other halogenated 
compounds (polyfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulfur hexafluoride 
(SFg)) across the SRES scenarios are described in detail on a 
substance-by-substance basis in Chapter 5 and Fenhann (2000). 
However, none of the six SRES models has its own projections 
for emissions of ozone depleting substances (ODSs), their 
detailed driving forces, and their substitutes. Hence, a different 
approach for scenario generation was adopted. 
First, for ODSs, an external scenario, the Montreal Protocol 
scenario 
(A3, maximum 
allowed production) 
from 
WMO/UNEP (1998) is used as direct input to SRES. In this 
scenario corresponding emissions decline to zero by 2100 as a 
result 
of 
international 
environmental 
agreements, 
a 
development not yet anticipated in some of the IS92 scenarios 
(Pepper et a l , 1992). For the other gas species, most notably 
for CFC and HCFC substitutes, a simple methodology of 
developing different emission trajectories consistent with 
aggregate 
SRES 
scenario 
driving 
force 
assumptions 
(population, GDP, etc.) was developed. Scenarios are further 
differentiated as to assumed future technological change and 
control rates for these gases, varied across the scenarios 
consistently with the interpretation of the SRES storylines 
presented in Chapter 4 as well as the most recent literature. 
T e c h n i c a l 
S u m m a i j 
43 
Second, different assumptions about CFC applications as well 
as substitute candidates were developed. These were initially 
based on Kroeze and Reijnders (1992) and infonnation given 
in Midgley and McCulloch (1999), but updated with the most 
recent information from the Joint IPCC/TEAP Expert Meeting 
on Options for the Limitation of Emissions of HFCs and PFCs 
(WMO/UNEP, 1999). An important assumption, on the basis 
of the latest information from the industry, is that relatively few 
Montreal gases will be replaced fully by HFCs. CuiTcnt 
indications are that substitution rates of CFCs by HFCs will be 
less than 50% (McCulloch and Midgley, 1998). In Fenhann 
(2000) a further technological development is assumed that 
would result in about 25% of the CFCs ultimately being 
substituted by HFCs (see Table 5-9 in Chapter 5). This low 
percentage not only reflects the introduction of non-HFC 
substitutes, but also the notion that smaller amounts of 
halocarbons will be used in many applications when changing 
to HFCs (efficiency gains with technological change). A 
general assumption is that the present trend, not to substitute 
with high GWP substances (including PFCs and SFg) will 
continue. As a result of this assumption, the emissions reported 
here may be underestimates. This substitution approach is used 
in all four scenarios, and the technological options adopted are 
those known at present. Further substitution away from HFCs 
is assumed to require a climate policy and is therefore not 
considered in SRES scenarios. The range of emissions of HFCs 
in the SRES scenario is initially generally lower than in earlier 
IPCC scenarios because of new insights about the availability 
of alternatives to HFCs as replacements for substances 
controlled by the Montreal Protocol. In two of the four 
scenarios in the report, HFC emissions increase rapidly in the 
second half of the next century, while in two others the growth 
of emissions is significantly slowed down or reversed in that 
period. 
Aggregating all the different halocarbons (CFCs, HCFCs, 
HFCs) as well as halogenated compounds (PFCs and SFg) into 
MtC-equivalents 
(using 
GWPs 
from 
IPCC 
SAR, 
notwithstanding the caveats given in footnote 6) indicates a 
range between 386 and 1096 MtC-equivalent by 2100 for the 
SRES scenarios. This compares with a range of 746 to 875 
MtC-equivalent for IS92 (which, however, does not include 
PFCs and SFg). (The comparable SRES range excluding PFCs 
and SFg is between 299 and 753 MtC-equivalent by 2100.) The 
scenarios presented here indicate a wider range of uncertainty 
compared to IS92, particularly toward lower emissions 
(because of the technological and substitution reasons 
discussed above). 
The effect on climate of each of the substances aggregated to 
MtC-equivalents given in Table TS-4 varies greatly, because of 
differences in both atmospheric lifetime and the radiative effect 
per molecule of each gas. The net effect on climate of these 
substances is best determined by a calculation of their radiative 
forcing - which is the amount by which these gases enhance 
the anthropogenic greenhouse effect. The radiative forcing will 
be addressed in IPCC TAR and is thus not discussed in this 
report. 
9.3. 
Sulfur 
D i o x i d e 
Emissions 
Emissions of sulfur portray even more dynamic pattems in 
time and space than the CO2 emissions shown in Figures TS-7 
and TS-8. Factors other than climate change (namely regional 
and local air quality, and transformations in the stmcture of the 
energy system and end use) intervene to limit future emissions. 
Figure TS-10 shows the range of global sulfur emissions for all 
SRES scenarios and the four markers against the emissions 
range of the IS92 scenarios, more than 80 scenarios from the 
literature, and the historical development. 
A detailed review of long-term global and regional sulfur 
emission scenarios is given in Griibler (1998) and summarized 
in Chapter 3. The most important new finding from the scenario 
literature is recognition of the significant adverse impacts of 
sulfur emissions on human health, food production, and 
ecosystems. As a result, scenarios published since 1995 
generally assume various degrees of sulfur controls to be 
implemented in the future, and thus have projections 
substantially lower than previous ones, including the IS92 
scenario series. Of these, only the two low-demand scenarios 
IS92c and IS92d fall within the range of more recent long-term 
sulfur emission scenarios. A related reason for lower sulfur 
emission projections is the recent tightening of sulfur-control 
policies in the OECD countries, such as the Amendments of the 
Clean Air Act in the USA and the implementation of the Second 
European Sulfur Protocol. Such legislative changes were not 
reflected in previous long-term emission scenarios, as noted in 
Alcamo et a l (1995) and Houghton et a l . (1995). Similar sulfur 
control initiatives due to local air quality concerns are 
beginning to impact sulfur emissions also in a number of 
developing countries in Asia and Latin America (see lEA, 1999; 
La Rovere and Americano, 1998; Streets and Waldhoff, 2000; 
for a more detailed discussion see Chapter 3). As a result, even 
the highest range of recent sulfur-control scenarios is 
significantly below that of comparable, high-demand IS92 
scenarios (IS92a, IS92b, IS92e, and IS92f). The scenarios with 
the lowest ranges project stringent sulfur-control levels that lead 
to a substantial decline in long-term emissions and a retum to 
emission levels that prevailed at the beginnings of the 20* 
century. The SRES scenario set brackets global anthropogenic 
sulfur emissions of between 27 and 169 MtS by 2050 and 
between 11 and 93 MtS by 2100 (see Table TS-4). In contrast, 
the range of the IS92 scenarios (Pepper et a l , 1992) is 
substantially higher starting at 80 MtS and extending all the 
way to 200 MtS by 2050 and from 55 to 230 MtS by 2100. 
Reflecting recent developments and the literature, it is assumed 
that sulfur emissions in the SRES scenarios will also be 
controlled increasingly outside the OECD. As a result, both 
long-term trends and regional pattems of sulfur emissions 
evolve differently from carbon emissions in the SRES 
scenarios. As a general pattem, global sulfur emissions do not 
rise substantially, and eventually decline even in absolute terms 
during the second half of the 2P' century, as indicated by the 
median of all scenarios in Figure TS-10 (see also Chapters 2 
and 3). The spatial distribution of emissions changes markedly.

the SRES scenario families in 2100. For details of the two additional illustrative A l scenarios see Appendix VII. Database 
source: Grübler (1998). 
Emissions in the OECD countries continue their recent 
declining trend (reflecting the tightening of control measures). 
Emissions outside the OECD rise initially, most notably in 
Asia, which compensates for the declining OECD emissions. 
Over the long term, however, sulfur emissions decline 
throughout the world, but the timing and magnitude vary 
across the scenarios. It should be noted that SRES scenarios 
assume sulfur controls o n l y and do not assume any additional 
climate policy measures. 
Nevertheless, one 
important 
implication of this varying pattem of sulfur emissions is that 
the historically important, but uncertain, negative radiative 
forcing of sulfate aerosols may decline in the very long ran. 
This view is also confirmed by the model calculations reported 
in Subak et a l . (1997) and Nakicenovic et a l . (1998) based on 
recent long-term GHG and sulfur emission scenarios. 
9.4. 
Other 
Chemically 
Active 
Gases 
The SRES emissions scenarios also have different emissions 
for other GHGs and chemically active species such as CO, 
N0^,, 
and volatile organic compounds. The uncertainties that 
surround the emissions sources of these gases, and the more 
complex set of driving forces behind them are considerable and 
unresolved. Hence, model projections of these gases are 
particularly uncertain and the scenarios presented here are no 
exception. Improved inventories and studies linking driving 
forces to changing emissions in order to improve the 
representation of these gases in global and regional emission 
models remain an important future research task. 
The emissions of other gases follow dynamic pattems much 
like those shown in Figure TS-7 for carbon dioxide emissions. 
Further details about GHG emissions are given in Chapter 5.

Some models of the six SRES models do not provide a 
comprehensive description of N0^, emissions or include only 
specific sectors (e.g., energy-related sources) and have adopted 
other source categories from corresponding model rans derived 
from 
other 
models. 
Even 
with 
a 
simplified 
model 
representation, future NO^, emission levels are mainly 
determined by two set of variables: levels of fossil energy use 
(see Chapter 4), and level and timing of emission controls, 
inspired by local air quality concerns. 
As a result the spread of NO^^ emissions is largest within the A l 
scenario family (28 to 151 MtN/yr by 2100), almost as large as 
the range across all 40 SRES scenarios (see Table TS-4). Only 
T e c h n i c a l 
Summary

in tlie hiigiiest emission scenarios (tlie fossil fuel intensive 
scenarios within the A l scenario family and the high 
population, coal intensive A2 scenario family) do emissions 
rise continuously throughout the 2P' century. In the A I B 
("balanced") scenaiio group and in the B2 scenario family, 
NOjj emission levels rise less. N0^^ emissions tend to increase 
up to 2050 and stabilize thereafter, the result of a gradual 
substitution of fossil fuels by alternatives as well as of the 
increasing diffusion of N0,^ control technologies. Low 
emission futures are described by various ВI family scenarios, 
as well as in the A I T scenario group, that describe futures in 
which NOj^ emissions are controlled because of either local air 
quality concerns or rapid technological change away from 
conventional fossil technologies. Overall, the SRES scenarios 
describe a similar upper range of NO^^ emissions as the 
previous IS92 scenarios (151 M t N versus 134 MtN, 
respectively, by 2100), but extend the IS92 uncertainty range 
toward lower emission levels (16 versus 54 MtN by 2100 in the 
SRES and IS92 scenarios, respectively).

NMVOCs arise from fossil fuel combustion (as with NO^^, 
wide ranges of emission factors are typical for internal 
combustion engines), and also from industrial processes, fuel 
storage (fugitive emissions), use of solvents (e.g., in paint and 
cleaners), and a variety of other activities. In this report 
NMVOCs are discussed as one group. As for N0^^ emissions, 
not all models include the NMVOCs emissions category or all 
of its sources. 
A relatively robust trend across all 40 scenarios (see Chapter 5) 
is a gradual increase in NMVOC emissions up to about 2050, 
with a range between 190 and 260 Mt. Beyond 2050, 
uncertainties increase with respect to both emission levels and 
trends. By 2100, the range is between 58 and 552 Mt, which 
extends the IS92 scenario range of 136 to 403 Mt by 2100 
toward both higher and lower emissions (see Table TS-4). As 
for N0^ emissions, the upper bounds of NMVOC emissions 
are formed by the fossil fuel intensive scenarios within the A l 
scenario family, and the lower bounds by the scenarios within 
the B l scenario family. Characteristic ranges are between 60 
and 90 Mt NMVOC by 2100 in the low emissions cluster and 
between 370 and 550 Mt NMVOC in the high emissions 
cluster. All other scenario families and individual scenarios fall 
between these two emissions clusters; the B2 marker scenario 
(B2-MESSAGE) closely tracks the median of global N M V O C 
emissions from all the SRES scenarios (see Chapter 5).

E m i s s i o n s 
The same caveats as stated above for N0,^ and N M V O C 
emissions also apply to CO emissions - the number of models 
that represent all the emission source categories is limited and 
modeling and data uncertainties, such as emission factors, are 
considerable. As a result, CO emission estimates across 
scenarios are highly model specific and future emission levels 
overlap considerably between the four SRES scenario families 
(see Table TS-4). Generally, emissions are highest in the high 
growth fossil fuel intensive scenarios within the A l scenario 
family. Lowest emission levels are generally associated with 
the B l and B2 scenario famiUes. By 2100, emissions range 
between 363 and 3766 Mt CO, a considerably larger 
uncertainty range, particularly toward higher emissions, than in 
IS92, for which the 2100 emission range was between 450 and 
929 Mt CO (see Table TS-4).

Emissions 
Overview 
Table TS-4 (see later) summarizes the emissions of GHGs, 
sulfur dioxide and other radiatively active species by 2100 for 
the four markers and the ranges for other 36 scenarios. 
Combined with Tables TS-2 and TS-3, the tables provide a 
concise summary of the new SRES scenarios. Data are given 
for both the harmonized and all scenarios.

Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations 
In summary, the SRES scenarios lead to the following findings: 
• 
Alternative combinations of driving forces can lead to 
similar levels and structure of energy and land-use 
patterns, as illustrated by different scenarios and 
groups. Hence, even for a given scenario outcome (e.g., 
in terms of G H G emissions) there are alternative 
combinations of driving forces and pathways that could 
lead to that outcome. For instance, significant global 
changes could result from a scenario of high population 
growth, even if per capita incomes rise only modestly, 
as well as from a scenario in which a rapid 
demographic transition (to low population levels) 
coincides with high rates of income growth and 
affluence. 
• 
Important possibilities for further bifurcations in future 
development trends exist within one scenario family, 
even when particular values are adopted for the 
important scenario driving force variables to illustrate a 
particular development path. The technology scenario 
groups in the A l family illustrate such alternative 
development paths with similar quantifications of the 
main driving forces. 
• 
Emissions profiles are dynamic across the range of 
SRES scenarios. They portray trend reversals and 
indicate possible emissions crossover among different 
scenarios. They do not represent mere extensions of 
continuous increase of GHGs and SOj emissions into 
the future. This more complex pattern of future 
emissions across the range of SRES scenarios, time 
periods, world regions, and sectors reflects recent 
scenario literature. 
• 
Describing potential future developments involves 
inherent ambiguities and uncertainties. One and only one 
possible development path (as alluded to, for instance, in 
concepts such as "business-as-usual scenario") simply 
4 6 
T e c h n i c a l 
Summary 
does not exist alone. And even for each alternative 
development path described by any given scenario, there 
are numerous combinations of driving forces and 
numeric values that can be consistent with a particular 
scenario description. The numeric precision of any model 
result should not distract from the basic fact that 
uncertainty abounds. However, the multi-model approach 
increases the value of the SRES scenario set, since 
uncertainties in the choice of model input assumptions 
can be separated more explicitly from the specific model 
behavior and related modeling uncertainties. 
• 
Any scenario has subjective elements and is open to 
various interpretations. While the writing team as a 
whole has no preference for any of the scenarios, and has 
no judgment as to the probability or desirability of 
dilïerent scenarios, the open process and initial reactions 
to draft versions of this report show that individuals and 
interest groups do have such judgments. The writing 
team hopes that this will stimulate an open discussion in 
the policymaking arena about potential futures and 
choices that can be made in the context of climate 
change response. For the scientific community, the 
SRES scenario exercise has led to the identification of a 
number of recommendations for future research that can 
further 
increase the understanding 
of potential 
developments of socio-economic driving forces and their 
interactions, and the associated GHG emissions. A 
summary of the main findings and recommendations for 
potential users of the SRES scenarios is given in Boxes 
TS-4 and Box TS-5. The writing teams' suggestions for 
consideration by the IPCC are summarized in Box TS-6. 
• 
Finally, the writing team believes that the SRES 
scenarios largely fulfill all specifications set out in 
Chapter 1. To support reproducibility, more detailed 
information than can be included in this report will be 
made available by individual modeling groups and 
members of the writing team through other means, such 
as web sites, peer-reviewed literature, or background 
documentation, if additional resources can be made 
available. 
In conclusion, Tables TS-2, TS-3, and TS-4 summarize the 
main characteristics of the scenario groups that constitute the 
four families, both for the harmonized and for all scenarios. 
Tables TS-2 and TS-3 summarize the ranges of the primary and 
secondary scenario driving forces, respectively. Table TS-4 
summarizes the emissions of GHGs, SOj, and ozone precursor 
emissions. Together, the three tables provide a concise 
summary of the new SRES scenarios. 
Box TS-4: Main Findings and Implications of SRES Scenarios 
• 
The four scenario families each have a narrative storyline and consist of 40 scenarios developed by six modeling groups. 
• 
The 40 scenarios cover the ftill range of GHGs and SOj emissions consistent with the underlying range of driving forces 
from scenario literature. 
• 
The 40 SRES scenarios fall into various groups - the three scenario families A2, В1, and B2, plus different groups within 
the A l scenario family. The A l groups are distinguished by their technological emphasis - on coal (AlC), oil and gas 
(AIG), non-fossil energy sources (AIT), or a balance across all sources (AlB). In the SPM, the A l C and A I G scenario 
groups are combined into one fossil intensive group AlFI. A l l scenario groups are equally sound. 
• 
The scenarios are also grouped into four categories of cumulative COj emissions, which indicate that scenarios with 
different driving forces can lead to similar cumulative emissions and those with similar drivmg forces can branch out mto 
different categories of cumulative emissions. 
• 
Four from 40 scenarios are designated as marker scenarios that are characteristic of the four scenarios families. Together 
with the two additional illustrative scenarios selected from the scenario groups in the A1 family, they capture most of the 
emissions and driving forces spaimed by the full set of the scenarios. 
• 
There is no single central or "best guess" scenario, and probabilities or likelihood are not assigned to individual scenarios. 
Instead, the writing team recommends that the smallest set of scenarios used should include the four designated marker 
scenarios and the two additional illustrative scenarios selected from the scenario groups in the A1 family. 
• 
Distinction between scenarios that envisage sttingent envkonmental policies and those that kiclude direct climate policies 
was very difficult to make, a difficulty associated with many definitional and other ambiguities. 
• 
AU scenarios describe futures that are generally more affluent than today. Many of the scenarios envisage a more rapid 
convergence in per capita income ratios in the world compared to the IS92 scenarios while, at the same time, they jointly 
cover a wide range of GHGs and SOj emissions. 
• 
Emissions profiles are more dynamic than the IS92 scenarios, which reflects changes in future emissions trends for some 
scenarios and GHG species. 
• 
The levels of GHG emissions are generally lower than the IS92 levels, especially toward the end of the 2P' century, while 
emissions of SOj, which have a cooling effect on the atmosphere, are significantly lower than in IS92. 
• 
Alternative combinations of main scenario driving forces can lead to similar levels of GHG emissions by the end of the 
2P' century. Scenarios with different underlying assumptions can result in very similar climate changes. 
• 
Technology is at least as important a driving force of GHG emissions as population and economic development across 
the set of 40 SRES scenarios. 
Technical 
Summary

Box TS-5: Recommendations for Consideration by the User Communities 
The writing team recommends that the SRES scenarios be the main basis for the assessment of future emissions and their 
driving forces in the TAR. Accordingly, the SRES writing team makes the following recommendations regarding the emissions 
scenarios to be used in the atmosphere/ocean general circulation models (A/O GCMs) simmlations for WGI, for the models that 
will be used in the assessment of climate change impacts by WGII, and for the mitigation and stabilization assessments by 
WGIH: 
• 
It is recommended 
that a range of SRES 
scenarios 
f r o m more 
t h a n one f a m i l y be used 
i n any analysis. 
The scenario 
groups - the three scenario families A2, Bl, and B2, plus the groups within the AI scenario family, AIB, A l C & AIG 
(combined into AlFI in the SPM), and AIT - and four cumulative emissions categories were developed as the smallest 
subsets of SRES scenarios that capture the range of uncertainties associated with driving forces and emissions. 
• 
The important 
uncertainties 
may be different 
i n different 
applications 
- for example 
climate 
modeling; 
assessment 
of 
impacts, 
vulnerability, 
m i t i g a t i o n , and adaptation 
options; 
and policy 
analysis. 
Climate modelers may want to cover the 
range reflected by the cumulative emissions categories. To assess the robustness of options in terms of impacts, 
vulnerability, and adaptation may require scenarios with similar emissions but different socio-economic characteristics, 
as reflected by the seven groups. For mitigation analysis, variation in both emissions and socio-economic characteristics 
may be necessary. For analysis at the national or regional scale, the most appropriate scenarios may be those that best 
reflect specific ckcumstances and perspectives. 
• 
There is no single 
most, 
likely 
"central" 
or "best-guess" 
scenario, 
either 
with respect to other 
SRES 
scenarios 
or to the 
underlying 
scenario 
literature. Probabilities or likelihoods are not assigned to individual SRES scenarios. None of the 
SRES scenarios represents an estimate of a central tendency for all driving forces and emissions, such as the mean or 
median, and none should be interpreted as such. The statistics associated with the frequency distributions of SRES 
scenarios do not represent the likelihood of their occurrence. The writing team cautions against constructing a central, 
"best-estimate" scenario from the SRES scenarios; instead it recommends use of the SRES scenarios as they are. 
• 
Concerning 
large-scale 
climate 
models, 
the w r i t i n g team 
recommends 
that the m i n i m u m set of SRES 
scenarios 
should 
include 
the f o u r designated 
marker 
scenarios 
and the two a d d i t i o n a l illustrative 
scenarios 
selected 
in the SPM 
f r o m the 
scenario 
groups 
in the A I family. 
At the minimum (a) a simulation for one and the same SRES marker scenario should 
be performed by every TAR climate model for a given stabilization ceiling, and (b) the set of simulations performed by 
the TAR climate models and stabiUzation runs for a given ceiling should include аН four of the SRES marker scenarios 
and the two additional illustrative scenarios selected in SPM from the scenario groups in the A l family. 
• 
The d r i v i n g forces 
and emissions 
of each 
SRES 
scenario 
should 
be used 
together. 
To avoid intemal inconsistencies, 
components of SRES scenarios should not be mixed. For example, the GHG emissions from one scenario and the SOj 
emissions from another scenario, or the population from one and economic development path from another, should not 
be combined. 
• 
The SRES 
scenarios 
can provide 
policy 
makers 
with a long-term 
context 
for 
near-term 
decisions. 
This implies that they 
are not necessarily well suited for the analysis of near-term developments. When analyzing mitigation and adaptation 
options, the user should be aware that although no additional clunate initiatives are included in the SRES scenarios, 
various changes have been assumed to occur that would require other policy interventions. 
• 
A l l 4 0 SRES 
emissions 
scenarios, 
their 
m a i n d r i v i n g forces, 
and underlying 
assumptions 
should 
be made 
widely 
a v a i l a b l e . Depending on resources available the scenario documentation, should e.g., be placed on the web and made 
available on a CD-ROM. In addition, the time-dependent geographic distributions of the concentrations of GHGs and 
sulfate aerosol burden, together with their corresponding radiative forcings, should also be placed on the web. 
Box TS-6: Recommendations for Consideration by the IPCC 
• 
Assure that the SRES scenarios, their main assumptions, and modeling approaches are widely available through a web 
site or a CD-ROM. 
• 
Establish a long-term facility for documentation and comparison of emissions scenarios to succeed the SRES open 
process. This should include a scenario database and analytic evaluation capabilities and should be regularly maintained. 
• 
An effort should be made in the future to develop an appropriate emissions scenario classification scheme. 
• 
Identify resources for capacity building in the area of emissions scenarios and modeling tools, with a particular emphasis 
to involve strong participation from developing countries. 
• 
Promote activities within and outside the IPCC to extend the SRES multi-baseline and multi-model approach in future 
assessments of climate change impacts, adaptation, and mitigation. 
• 
Initiate new programs to assess GHG emissions from land use and sources of emissions other than energy-related COj 
emissions, to go beyond the effort of SRES, which was limited by tune and resources. 
• 
Initiate new programs to assess future developments of driving forces and GHG emissions for different regions and for 
different sectors (taking the set of SRES scenarios as reference for overall global and regional developments) to provide 
more regional and sectorial detail than time and resources allowed SRES to achieve.

1.1. 
Introduction 
The 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 
decided at its September 1996 plenary session in Mexico City 
to develop a new set of emissions scenaiios (see Appendix I for 
the Terms of Reference). This Special Report on Emission 
Scenarios (SRES) describes the new scenarios and how they 
were developed. 
The 
SRES writing team formulated a set of emissions 
scenarios. These scenarios cover a wide range of the main 
driving forces of future emissions, from demographic to 
technological and economic developments. The scenarios 
encompass different future developments that might influence 
greenhouse gas (GHG) 
sources and sinks, such as alternative 
structures of energy systems and land-use changes. As required 
by the terms of reference however, none of the scenarios in the 
set includes any future policies that explicifly address 
additional climate change initiatives ^ although all necessarily 
encompass various assumed future policies of other types that 
may indirectly influence GHGs sources and sinks. 
The set of SRES emissions scenarios is based on an extensive 
assessment of the literature, six alternative modeling 
approaches, and an "open process" that solicited wide 
participation and feedback from many groups and individuals. 
The set of scenarios includes anthropogenic emissions of all 
relevant G H G species and sulfur dioxide (SOj), carbon 
monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (N0^^) and non-methane 
volatile organic hydrocarbons (VOCs), as shown in Table 1-1. 
It covers most of the range of GHG emissions compared with 
the published scenario literature. For example, in the SRES 
scenarios, emissions of CO^ in 2100 range from more than 40 
to less than 6 giga (or billion) tons- of elemental carbon (GtC), 
that is, from almost a sevenfold increase to roughly the same 
emissions level as in 1990. 
Emissions scenarios are a central component of any assessment 
of climate change. Scenarios facilitate the assessment of future 
developments in complex systems that are either inherently 
unpredictable or have high scientific uncertainties, and the 
assessment of future emissions is an essential component of the 
overall assessment of global climate change by the IPCC. 
Emissions of GHGs and SO2 are the basic input for 
determining future climate patterns with simple climate 
models, as well as with complex general circulation models 
(GCMs). Possible climate changes together with the major 
driving forces of future emissions, such as demographic 
patterns, economic development and environmental conditions, 
provide the basis for the assessment of vulnerability, possible 
' For example, no scenarios are included that expUcitly assume 
implementation of the emission targets in the Kyoto protocol.

adverse impacts and adaptation strategies and policies to 
climate change. The major driving forces of future emissions 
also provide the basis for the assessment of possible mitigation 
strategies and policies designed to avoid climate change. 
Future emissions and the evolution of their underlying driving 
forces are highly uncertain, as reflected in the very wide range 
of future emissions paths in the literature. Of the many ways 
that uncertainties have been classified in the literature (see Box 
I-1 in Section 1.2 below), this introduction uses the three 
categories 
of 
Funtowicz and 
Ravetz 
(1990): 
"data 
uncertainties," "modeling uncertainties" and "completeness 
uncertainties." This categorization has the advantages of a 
small number of categories and of clear descriptive titles. Data 
uncertainties reflect the reality that most historical and base 
year data sets are neither fully complete nor fully reliable. This 
is certainly true for data on population, energy consumption, 
energy efficiency, gross world product, energy resources and 
reserves, and probably true for every parameter mentioned in 
this report. Modeling uncertainties refer both to the 
approximations necessary 
in any model of complex 
phenomena like GHG emissions, and to the range of plausible 
but different modeling approaches, each with its own strengths 
and weaknesses. Completeness uncertainties encompass, ñrst, 
relevant factors that can be identified but are nonetheless 
excluded from an analysis - for example exclusion of criteria 
other than cost minimization in an energy model, such as 
energy security, the protection of domestic industries, and free 
trade. Second, they also include factors that may be relevant 
but are as essentially unknown to us as jet aiiplanes were to 
Thomas Malthus or 3-D seismic techniques in oil exploration 
were to John D. Rockefeller. The use of scenarios and 
storylines in this report partially addresses completeness 
uncertainties 
related to 
k n o w n 
factors. 
Completeness 
uncertainties related to u n k n o w n factors can, of course, never 
be persuasively captured by any approach. 
The 
IPCC developed sets of emissions scenarios in 1990 
(Houghton et a l . , 1990) and 1992 (Leggett et a i , 1992; Pepper 
et a l . , 1992). In 1994 the IPCC formally evaluated the 1992 
scenario set (Alcamo et a l . , 1995) and, in 1996, it initiated the 
62 
B a c k g r o u n d and. 
O v e r v i e w 
effort described in this report. The new set of emissions 
scenarios is intended for use in future IPCC assessments and 
by 
wider scientific and policymaliing communities who 
analyze the effects of future GHG emissions and develop 
mitigation and adaptation measures and policies. The 
emissions profiles of tlie new scenarios can provide inputs for 
GClVIs and simplified models of climate change. The new 
scenarios also contain information, such as the level of 
economic activity, rates of technological change and 
demographic developments in different world regions, required 
to assess climate-change 
impacts and vulnerabilities, 
adaptation strategies and policies. The same kind of 
information, in conjunction with emissions trajectories, can 
serve as a benchmark for the evaluation of alternative 
mitigation measures and policies. Finally, the new set of 
scenarios may provide a common basis and an integrative 
element for the Third Assessment Report (TAR). 
IPCC Working Group III ( WGIII) appointed the SRES writing 
team in January 1997. After some adjustments it eventually 
included more than 50 scientists. Together they represent a 
broad range of scientific disciplines, regional backgrounds and 
non-governmental organizations. In particular the team 
includes representatives of six leading groups with extensive 
expertise in modeling altemative emissions scenarios. It also 
includes a number of members who were convening and lead 
authors in all three earlier IPCC scenario activities (see above). 
Their expertise and familiarity with earlier IPCC emissions 
scenario work assured continuity and allowed the SRES effort 
to build efficiently upon prior work. Appendix II lists the 
members of the writing team and their affiliations. 
The writing team reached a consensus concerning the overall 
work program. It was agreed that the scenario development 
process would consist of four major components. 
• 
First, a review of existing global and regional emissions 
scenarios 
from 
the 
published 
literature 
and 
development of a unique database of 416 global and 
regional scenarios (accessible at a web site: www-
cger.nies.go.jp/cger-e/db/ipcc.html). 
• 
Second, an analysis of the range of the scenarios' main 
characteristics, their relationships, and their "driving 
forces" (such as population, economic development, 
energy consumption, rates of technological change and 
GHG emissions) and the documentation of the results, 
some of which are published in the peer-reviewed 
literature.^ 
• 
Third, a formulation of narrative "storylines" to 
describe the main scenario characteristics, 
the 
development of quantitative prototype scenarios by six 
leading groups representing the main modeling 
approaches from around the world, and the publication 
of the prototype scenarios on a specially developed 
IPCC web site (sres.ciesin.org), on web sites of the 
modeling teams,'* and in the peer-reviewed literature.^ 
• 
Fourth, an "open" process through the IPCC web site 
(sres.ciesin.org) that involves feedback from modeling 
groups and experts worldwide, followed by the IPCC 
expert and govemment reviews that were coordinated 
by four review editors. 
Most of the background material and findings of the 
assessments conducted by the writing team have been 
documented in this report and in a series of publications 
including two special issues of intemational scientific journals, 
M i t i g a t i o n a n d A d a p t a t i o n S t r a t e g i e s f o r G l o b a l C h a n g e ^ and

1.2. 
What are Scenarios? 
Scenarios are images of the future, or alternative futures. They 
are neither predictions nor forecasts. Rather, each scenario is 
one altemative image of how the future might unfold. A set of 
scenarios assists in the understanding of possible future 
developments of complex systems. Some systems, those that 
are well understood and for which complete information is 
available, can be modeled with some certainty, as is frequently 
the case in the physical sciences, and their future states 
predicted. However, many physical and social systems are 
poorly understood, and information on the relevant variables is 
so incomplete that they can be appreciated only through 
intuition and are best communicated by images and stories. 
Prediction is not possible in such cases (see Box 1-1 on 
uncertainties inherent in scenario analysis). 
Scenarios can be viewed as a linking tool that integrates 
qualitative narratives or stories about the future and 
quantitative formulations based on formal modeling. As such 
they enhance our understanding of how systems work, behave 
and evolve. Scenarios are useful tools for scientific 
assessments, for leaming about complex systems behavior and 
for policy making (Jefferson, 1983; Davis, 1999). In scientific 
assessments, scenarios are usually based on an internally 
consistent and reproducible set of assumptions or theories 
about the key relationships and driving forces of change, which 
are derived from our understanding of both history and the 
current situation. Often scenarios are formulated with the help 
of numeric or analytic formal models. 
Future levels of global GHG emissions are the products of a 
very complex, ill-understood dynamic system, driven by forces

Box 1-1: Uncertainties and Scenario Analysis 
In general, there are three types of uncertainty: uncertainty in quantities, uncertainty about model structure and uncertainties 
that arise from disagreements among experts about the value of quantities or the functional form of the model (Morgan and 
Henrion, 1990). Sources of uncertainty could be statistical variation, subjective judgment (systematic error), imperfect 
definition (linguistic imprecision), natural variability, disagreement among experts and approximation (Morgan and Henrion, 
1990). Others (Funtowicz and Ravetz, 1990J distinguish three main sources of uncertainty: "data uncertainties," "modeling 
uncertainties" and "completeness uncertamties." Data uncertainties arise from the quality or appropriateness of the data used as 
inputs to models. Modeling uncertainties arise from an mcomplete understanding of the modeled phenomena, or from 
approximations that are used in formal representation of the processes. Completeness uncertainties refer to all omissions due to 
lack of knowledge. They are, in principle, non-quantifiable and irreducible. 
Scenarios help in the assessment of future developments in complex systems that are either inherently unpredictable, or that 
have high scientific uncertainties. In all stages of the scenario-building process, uncertainties of different nature are 
encountered. A large uncertainty surrounds future emissions and the possible evolution of their underlying driving forces, as 
reflected in a wide range of future emissions paths in the literature. The uncertainty is fiirther compounded in going from 
emissions paths to climate change, from climate change to possible impacts and finally from these driving forces to formulating 
adaptation and mitigation measures and policies. The uncertainties range from inadequate scientific understanding of the 
problems, data gaps and general lack of data to inherent uncertamties of future events in general. Hence the use of alternative 
scenarios to describe the range of possible future emissions. 
For the current SRES scenarios, the following sources of uncertainties are identified: 
C h o i c e of S t o r y l i n e s . Freedom in choice of qualitative scenario parameter combinations, such as low population combined with 
high gross domestic product (GDP), contributes to scenario uncertainty. 
A u t h o r s I n t e r p r e t a t i o n of Stoi-ylines. Uncertainty in the individual modeler's translation of narrative scenario storyline text in 
quantitative scenario drivers. Two kinds of parameters can be distinguished: 
• 
Harmonized drivers such as population, GDP, and final energy (see Section 4.1. in Chapter 4). Inter-scenario uncertainty 
is reduced in the hamionized runs as the modeling teams decided to keep population and GDP within certain agreed 
boundaries. 
• 
Other assumed parameters were chosen freely by the modelers, consistent with the storylines. 
T r a n s l a t i o n of t h e U n d e r s t a n d i n g of L i n k a g e s between 
D r i v i n g F o r c e s i n t o Q u a n t i t a t i v e I n p u t s f o r S c e n a r i o A n a l y s i s . Often the 
understanding of the linkages is incomplete or qualitative only. This makes it difficult for modelers to implement these linkages 
in a consistent manner. 
M e t h o d o l o g i c a l 
Differences. 
• 
Uncertainty induced by conceptual and structural differences in the way models work (model approaches) and in the ways 
models are parameterized. 
• 
Uncertamty in the assumptions that underlie the relationships between scenario drivers and output, such as the 
relationship between average income and diet change. 
Different 
Sources 
of D a t a . Data differ from a variety of well-acknowledged scientific studies, since "measurements" always 
provide ranges and not exact values. Therefore, modelers can only choose from r a n g e s of input parameters for. For example: 
• 
Base year data. 
• 
Historical development trajectories.

Current investment requirements. 
I n h e r e n t U n c e r t a i n t i e s . These uncertainties stem from the fact that unexpected "rare" events or events that a majority of 
researchers currently consider to be "rare future events" might nevertheless occur and produce outcomes that are fundamentally 
different from those produced by SRES model runs. 
such as population growth, socio-economic development, and 
technological progress; thus to predict emissions accurately is 
virtually impossible. However, near-tenn policies may have 
profound long-term climate impacts. Consequently, policy-
makers need a summary of what is understood about possible 
future GHG emissions, and given the uncertainties in both 
emissions models and our understanding of key driving forces, 
scenarios are an appropriate tool for summarizing both current 
understanding and current uncertainties. For such scenarios to 
be useful for climate models, impact assessments and the 
design of mitigation and adaptation policies, both the main 
outputs of the SRES scenarios (emissions) and the main inputs 
or driving forces (population growth, economic growth, 
technological, e.g., as it affects energy and land-use) are 
equally important. 
GHG emissions scenarios are usually based on an internally 
consistent and reproducible set of assumptions about the key 
6 4 
B a c k g r o u n d a n d 
O v e r v i e w 
relationships and driving forces of change, which are derived 
from our understanding of both history and the entrent 
situation. Often these scenarios are formulated with the help of 
formal models. Such scenarios specify the future emissions of 
GHGs in quantitative terms and, if fully documented, they are 
also reproducible. Sometimes G H G emissions scenarios are 
less quantitative and more descriptive, and in a few cases they 
do not involve any formal analysis and are expressed in 
qualitative terms. The SRES scenarios involve both qualitative 
and quantitative components; they have a narrative part called 
"storylines" and a number of corresponding quantitative 
scenarios for each storyline. Figure 1-1 illustrates the 
interrelated nature of these altemative scenario formulations. 
Although no scenarios are value free, it is often useful to 
distinguish between normative and descriptive scenarios. 
Normative (or prescriptive) scenarios are explicitly values-
based and teleologic, exploring the routes to desired or 
undesired endpoints (utopias or dystopias). Descriptive 
scenarios are evolutionary and open-ended, exploring paths 
into the future. The SRES scenarios are descriptive and should 
not be construed as desirable or undesirable in their own right. 
They are built as descriptions of possible, rather than preferred, 
developments. They represent pertinent, plausible, altemative 
futures. Their peitinence is derived from the need for policy 
makers and climate-change modelers to have a basis for 
assessing the impUcations of future possible paths for G H G 
and S O 2 emissions, and the possible response strategies. Their 
plausibility is based on an extensive review of the emissions 
scenarios available in the literature, and has been tested by 
altemative modeling approaches, by peer review (including the 
"open process" through the IPCC web site), and by the IPCC 
review and approval processes. Good scenarios are challenging 
and court controversy, since not everybody is comfortable with 
every scenario, but used intelligently they allow policies and 
strategies to be designed in a more robust way.

formulations, from narrative storylines to quantitative formal 
models. 
1.3. 
Purposes and Uses of SRES Emissions Scenarios 
The assessment of climate change dictates a global perspective 
and a very long time horizon that covers periods of at least a 
century. As the prediction of future anthropogenic G H G 
emissions is impossible, altemative GHG emissions scenarios 
become a major tool for the analysis of potential long-range 
developments 
of 
the 
socio-economic 
system 
and 
corresponding emission sources. 
However, to develop scenarios for a period of 100 years is a 
relatively new field. Difficulties arise not only from large 
scientific uncertainties and data inadequacies, but also because 
people are not trained to think in such time-spans. We are 
educated in narrow disciplines, and our ability to model 
complex systems, at the global level, is sfill in its infancy. For 
example, within the next century technological discontinuities 
should be expected, and possibly major shifts in societal values 
and in the balance of geopolitical power. The study of past 
trends over such long periods is hampered because most 
databases are incomplete if more than 50 years old. Given 
these gaps in our data, methods and understanding, scenarios 
are the best way to integrate our demographic, economic, 
societal and technological knowledge with our understanding 
of écologie systems to evaluate sources and sinks of GHG 
emissions. Scenarios as an integration tool in the assessment of 
climate change allow a role for intuition, analysis and 
synthesis, and thus we tum to scenarios to take advantage of 
these features and aid the assessment of future climate change, 
impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation and mitigation. Since the 
scenarios focus on the century time scale, tools are used that 
have been developed for this purpose. These tools are less 
suitable for the analysis of near-term developments, so this 
report does not intend to provide reliable projections for the 
near term. 
The IPCC's 1994 evaluation of its 1992 emissions scenarios 
identified four principal uses (Alcamo et a l . , 1995): 
• 
To provide input for evaluating climatic and 
environmental consequences of altemative future 
GHG 
emissions in the absence of specific measures to reduce 
such emissions or enhance GHG sinks. 
• 
To provide similar input for cases with specific 
alternative policy interventions to reduce G H G 
emissions and enhance sinks. 
• 
To provide input for assessing mitigation and 
adaptation possibilities, and their costs, in different 
regions and economic sectors. 
• 
To provide input to negotiations of possible agreements 
to reduce GHG emissions. 
The SRES emissions scenarios are intended for the first, third 
and fourth uses. They do not include any additional (explicit) 
policies or measures directed at reducing G H G sources and 
enhancing sinks. Thus, they cannot be directly applied to the 
second purpose of emissions scenarios. Instead, they could be 
used as reference cases for the introduction of specific policy 
B a c k g r o u n d a n d 
O v e r v i e w 
65 
interventions and measures in new model runs tliat siiare tlie 
same specifications for the other principal driving forces of 
future emissions. However, the SRES emissions scenarios 
include a host of other policies and measures that are not 
directed at reducing sources and increasing sinks of GHGs, but 
that nevertheless have an indirect effect on future emissions. 
For 
example, policies directed at 
achieving 
greater 
environmental protection may also lead to lower emissions of 
GHGs. Moreover, afforestation and reforestation measures 
increase COj sinks, and a shift to renewable energy sources 
reduces the sources of emissions. 
Within thi'ee of the broad objectives listed above, the new 
SRES emissions scenarios are also intended to meet the 
specific needs of three main IPCC user communities: 
• 
Working Group I (WGI), which includes climate 
modelers who need future emission trajectories for 
GHGs and aerosol precursors as inputs for the GCMs 
used to develop climate change scenarios. 
• 
Working Group II (WGII), which analyzes climate 
impacts and adaptation policies, first need the climate-
change scenarios produced by WGI's climate modelers. 
Second, analysts need to know the socio-economic 
changes associated with specific emissions scenarios, 
as impacts of climate change on ecosystems and people 
depend on many factors. Among these are whether the 
people arc numerous or few, rich or poor, free to move 
or relatively immobile, and included or excluded from 
world markets in technologies, food, etc. 
• 
WGIII, which analyzes potenüal mitigation policies for 
climate change, also needs to know the socio-economic 
settings against which policy options are to be 
evaluated. Are markets open or protected? Are 
technological options and economic resources plentiful 
or scarce? Are people vulnerable or adaptable? 
The 
interests of these three user groups create certain 
requhements that the SRES scenarios attempt to fulfill. For 
example, climate modelers and those who analyze climate 
impacts need scenaiios on the order of 100 years because of the 
long response time of the climate system. At the same time 
adaptation-policy analysis tends to be focused more on the 
medium-term, around 20 to 50 years. The SRES scenarios 
attempt to include enough infonnation and specific details to be 
useful to these groups. Spatially explicit emissions and socio-
economic variables are required for slightly different reasons. 
Some emissions, such as the SOj emissions that contribute to 
sulfate aerosols, have impacts that vary depending on where they 
are emitted. Climate modelers therefore need spatially explicit 
emission estimates. Similarly, impacts depend on the geographic 
pattems of changing temperatures, rainfall, humidity and cloud 
cover, and how these compare to evolving socio-economic 
patterns in specific scenarios. Impact modelers therefore need 
spatially explicit estimates of, in particular, population growth, 
migration, and the economic variables that reflect the expected 
adaptability or vulnerability of different populations and regional 
economies to different regional climate changes. 
Taking the above audiences and purposes into account, the 
following more precise specifications for the new SRES 
scenarios were developed. The new scenarios should: 
• 
cover the full range of radiatively important gases, 
which include direct and indirect GHGs and 
SO^; 
• 
have sufficient spatial resolution to allow regional 
assessments of climate change in the global context; 
• 
cover a wide spectrum of alternative futures to reflect 
relevant uncertainties and knowledge gaps; 
• 
use a variety of models to reflect methodological 
pluralism and uncertainty; 
• 
incorporate input from a wide range of scientific 
disciplines and expertise from non-academic sources 
through an open process; 
• 
exclude additional initiatives and policies specifically 
designed to reduce climate change; 
• 
cover and describe to the extent possible a range of 
policies that could affect climate change although they 
are targeted at other issues, for example, reductions in 
S O T emissions to limit acid rain; 
• 
cover as much as possible of the range of major 
underlying "driving forces" of emissions scenarios 
identified in the open literature; 
• 
be transparent with input assumptions, modeling 
approaches and results open to external review; 
• 
be reproducible - input data and methodology are 
documented adequately enough to allow 
other 
researchers to reproduce the scenarios; and 
• 
be internally consistent - the various input assumptions 
and data of the scenarios are internally consistent to the 
extent possible. 
1.4. 
Review of Past IPCC Emissions Scenarios 
The 1994 IPCC evaluation of the usefulness of the IPCC 1992 
(IS92) scenarios found that for the purposes of driving 
atmospheric and climate models, the COj emissions trajectories 
in these provided a reasonable reflection of variations found in 
the open literature. Specifically, their global C O ^ emissions 
spanned most of the range of other scenarios identified in the 
literature. Figure 1-2 shows the global, energy-related and 
industrial CO2 emissions of the IS92 scenarios ranging from 
very high emissions of 35.8 GtC to very low emissions of 4.6 
GtC 
by 2100 (corresponding to a sixfold increase and a 
decline by a third compared to 1990 levels, respectively). The 
shaded area in Figure 1-2 indicates the coverage of the IS92 
scenarios while the "spaghetti-like" curves indicate other 
energy-related emissions scenarios found by the IPCC review 
to be representative of the scenarios available in the open 
literature at that time (Alcamo et a l . , 1995). In the open 
literature, emissions trajectories for other gases were 
extremely thin in many instances, but the IS92 cases were not 
dissimilar to these. 
Another important recommendation of the 1994 IPCC review 
was that, given the degree of uncertainty about future climate

Figure 1-2: Energy-related and industrial global COj emissions for scenarios reviewed in the IPCC Report Climate Change 
1994 (Alcamo et a l . , 1995). The shaded area indicates coverage of 1S92 scenarios while the "spaghetti-like" curves indicate 
other energy-related emissions scenarios found by the IPCC review to be representative of the scenarios available in the open 
literature at that time. (Individual scenarios are listed in the Appendix of Alcamo et a i , 1995.) 
change, analysts should use the full range of IS92 emissions as 
input to climate models rather than a single scenario. This is in 
stark contrast to the actual use of one particular scenario in the 
set, the IS92a scenario, as the reference case in numerous 
studies. In fact, the IS92a scenario is often referred to in 
climate change modeling and impact studies as the "business-
as-usual" scenario and used as the only reference emissions 
trajectory. The review concluded that the mere fact of the IS92a 
being an intermediate, or central, COj emissions scenario at the 
global level does not equate it with being the most likely 
scenario. Indeed, the conclusion was that there was no 
objective basis on which to assign likelihood to any of the 
scenarios. Furthermore, the IS92a scenario was shown to be 
"central" for only a few of its salient characteristics such as 
global population growth, global economic development and 
global COj emissions. In other ways, IS92a was found not to 
be central with respect to the published literature, particularly 
in some of its regional input assumptions. The same is the case 
with the new set of SRES scenarios, as is shown below. No 
single scenario can be central with respect to all the 
characteristics relevant for different uses of emissions 
scenarios and there is no objective way to assign likelihood to 
any of the scenarios. 
1.5. 
Why New IPCC Emissions Scenarios? 
The 1994 IPCC evaluation of the IS92 scenarios found that the 
scenarios were innovative at the time of their publication and 
path-breaking in their coverage of the full range of GHG and 
SO2 emissions, on both a global and a regional basis. The review 
also identified a number of weaknesses. These included the 
limited range of CO^ intensities of energy (CO2 emissions per 
unit energy) reflected in the six scenarios and the absence of any 
scenario with significant closure in the income gap between 
developed and developing countries, even after a full century 
(Parikh, 1992). Across all six scenarios the per capita income in 
the developing countries grows only to a share of 17% to 26% 
of that of the industrial countries, compared to 6% today. 
Furthermore, since the development of the IS92 scenarios 
much has changed in our understanding of both the possible 
future G H G emissions and the climate impacts that might 
result. The most straightforwai'd change arises because the 
IS92 scenarios had to estimate data for the base year 1990 
(actual data were unavailable at the time); 1990 is no longer a 
forecast year and actual data can be used. But other changes are 
at least as important. It is now recognized that in some regions 
SO2 emissions may be as important to climate cliange as all 
П О П - С О 2 greenhouse related gases combined - at least in the 
near-term. As a result the rapid growth of SO, emissions in the 
IS92 scenarios has been questioned. The 1994 evaluation of the 
IS92 scenario series (Alcamo et a l . , 1995) concluded, for 
instance, that projected emissions in the Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries 
did 
not reflect recent legislative changes such as the 
Amendments of the Clean Air Act in the US or the Second 
European Sulfur Protocol. Thus, factors other than climate 
change, namely regional and local air quality, may well prompt 
limits on future SOj emissions independent of global warming 
concerns. Restructuring in Eastern and Central Europe and the 
Newly Independent States of the fonner Soviet Union has 
B a c k g r o u n d a n d 
O v e r v i e w 
6 7 
powerfully affected economic activity, with reductions in CO2 
emissions unforeseen in the IS92 scenarios. The advent of 
integrated assessment (lA) models has also made it possible 
now to construct internally consistent emissions scenarios that 
jointly consider the interactions among energy use, the 
economy, and land-use change. Some l A models account for 
interactions in both directions between driving forces of 
GHG 
and SO, emissions and possible impacts of climate change. 
Progress has also been made in achieving greater consistency 
among scenario characteristics 
such as the rates of 
technological change in different sectors. 
Owing to these advances, the 1994 IPCC review of the IS92 
scenarios concluded that new scenarios, if developed, should 
include these improvements: 
• 
estimation of emissions baselines and future non-CO, 
emissions, particularly from land use; 
• 
incorporation of the latest information on economic 
restructuring throughout the world; 
• 
expand the range of economic-development pathways, 
including a narrowing of the income gap between 
developing and industrialized countries; 
• 
examine different trends in and rates of technological 
change; 
• 
evaluate possible consequences of trade and market 
liberalization and privatization; and 
• 
reflect current emission commitments in connection 
with the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change (UNFCCC, 1997). 
However, the Terms of Reference for SRES explicitly preclude 
additional initiatives, measures and policies specifically 
designed to reduce climate change (see Appendix I). 
1,6. 
SRES Approach and Process 
The 1994 IPCC review also offered recommendations about the 
process by which a new set of scenarios might be prepared. It 
recommended that the IPCC or another suitable organization act 
as an "umbrella" under which different groups could develop 
comparable, comprehensive emissions scenarios. They further 
recommended that the process for developing scenarios should 
draw on increasing experience in scenario harmonization and 
model calculations, and that it should emphasize: 
• 
openness to broad participation by the research (and 
stakeholder) community, particularly from developing 
countries and countries with economies in transition; 
• 
extensive documentation of modeling assumptions, 
inputs and outputs; 
• 
pluralism and diversity of groups, approaches and 
methods, although the final set of scenarios should be 
haimonized; 
• 
comparability across the scenarios that necessitates 
standardized reporting conventions for model inputs 
and outputs; and 
• 
harmonization of emission scenarios in the set to 
provide common benchmarks for scenarios from 
different modeling groups. 
Further recommendations included wide dissemination of the 
scenarios to countries, international organizations, non-
governmental organizations and the scientific community. As 
part of this effort, a central archive should be established to 
make available the resuUs of new scenarios to any group. The 
archive should also make available some aspects of the models 
and input assumptions used to derive the scenarios. In addition, 
special efforts are needed to improve the capabilities of 
researchers to analyze and develop scenarios, especially in 
developing countries and countries with economies in 
transition. 
As described at the beginning of this chapter, IPCC WGIII 
appointed the SRES writing team in January 1997, and the 
team reached early consensus on the four major components of 
an overall work program (outlined in Section 1.1). The SRES 
team worked in close collaboration with colleagues on the 
IPCC Task Group on Climate Scenarios for Impact Assessment 
(TGCIA) and with colleagues from all three IPCC working 
groups. As is evident from the four components of the work 
program, it was agreed that the process be an open one with no 
"official" model and no exclusive "expert teams." High priority 
was given to wide participation so that any research group 
capable of preparing scenarios for any region could participate. 
In 1997 the IPCC advertised in a number of relevant scientific 
journals and other publications to solicit wide participation in 
the process. All global modeling teams and regional modelers 
were invited and encouraged to participate. In this way, 
researchers with local expertise from both developing and 
developed regions could contribute to the global exercise even 
if their own research was exclusively regional. To facilitate 
participation and improve the usefulness of the new scenarios, 
the open-process web site mentioned above was created. The 
open process provided a wide access to preliminary marker 
(see below) SRES scenario results and greatly facilitated 
coordination among the writing team. It also provided 
feedback about the needs of those who would use the final 
scenarios, and suggestions for improvements. The open 
process also served to document all relevant results and 
associated 
assumptions 
for the 
preliminary scenarios 
developed by the participating modeling groups. 
Four storylines were developed by the whole writing team in 
an iterative process that identified driving forces, key 
uncertainties, and quanthative scenario families. The team was 
fortunate to have a number of skilled practitioners in scenario 
building. The process of quantifying the four storylines 
deserves some elaboration. The storylines were essentially 
complete by January 1998, at which time the modeling groups 
represented on the writing team began to quantify them. For 
each storyline, one modeling group was given principal 
responsibility, and the quantification produced by that group is 
referred to as the "marker scenario" for that storyline. The four 
preliminary marker scenarios were posted on the web site of 
6 8 
B a c k g r o u n d a n d O v e r v i e w 
the open process. The choice of the marlcers was based on 
extensive discussion of: 
• 
range of emissions across all of marker scenarios; 
• 
which of the initial quantifications (by the modelers) 
reflected the storyline; 
• 
preference of some of the modeling teams and features 
of specific models; 
• 
use of different models for the four markers. 
As a result the markers are not necessarily the median or mean 
of the scenario family, but are those scenarios considered by 
the SRES writing team as illustrative of a particular storyline. 
These scenarios have received the closest scrutiny of the entire 
writing team and via the SRES open process compared to other 
scenario quantifications. The marker scenarios are also those 
SRES scenarios that have been most intensively tested in terms 
of reproducibility. As a rule, different modeling teams have 
attempted to replicate the model quantification of a particular 
marker scenario. Available time and resources have not 
allowed a similar exercise to be conducted for all SRES 
scenarios, although some effort was devoted to reproduce the 
four scenario groups^ that constitute different interpretations of 
one of the four storylines (see Figure 1-4) with different 
models. Additional versions of the preliminary marker 
scenaiios by different modeling teams and other scenarios that 
give alternative quantitative interpretations of the four 
storylines constitute the final set of 40 SRES scenarios. This 
also means that the 40 scenarios are not independent of each 
other as they are all based on four storylines. However, 
differences in modeling approaches have meant that not all of 
the scenarios provide estimates for all the direct and indirect 
GHG emissions for all the sources and sectors. The four SRES 
marker scenarios cover all the relevant gas species and 
emission categories comprehensively 
The four marker scenarios were posted on the IPCC web site 
(sres.ciesin.org) in June 1998, and the open scenario review 
process through the IPCC web site lasted until January 1999. 
The submissions invited through the open process and web site 
fell into three categories (see Appendix VI): 
• 
additional scenarios published in the reviewed 
literature that had not been included in the scenario 
database (see Appendix V); 
• 
new scenarios based on the SRES marker scenarios; 
and 
• 
general suggestions to improve the work of the SRES 
writing team as posted on the web site (preferably 
based on referenced literature). 
The submissions were used to revise the marker scenarios and 
to develop additional alternatives within each of the four 
scenario families. The result is a more complete, refined set of

groups were merged into one. See also the endnote in Box 1-2. 
40 new scenarios that reflects the broad spectrum of modeling 
approaches and regional perspectives. The preliminary marker 
scenarios posted on the web site were provided also to climate 
modelers, with the approval of the IPCC Bureau.

SRES Emissions Scenarios 
1 . 7 . 1 . 
L i t e r a t u r e Review 
and A 
nalysis 
The first step in formulation of the SRES emissions scenarios 
was to review both the published scenario literature and the 
development of the scenario database accessible through the 
web site (www-cger.nies.go.jp/cger-e/db/ipcc.html). Chapters 
2 and 3 give a more detailed description of the literature review 
and analysis. Figure 1-3 shows the global energy-related CO2 
emission paths from the database as "spaghetti" curves for the 
period to 2100 against the background of the historical 
emissions from 1900 to 1990. These curves are plotted against 
an index on the vertical axis rather than as absolute values 
because of the large differences and discrepancies for the 
values assumed for the base yeai- 1990. These sometimes arise 
from genuine differences among the scenarios (e.g., different 
data sources, definitions) and sometimes from different base 
years assumed in the analysis or in altemative calibrations. 
The differences among the scenarios in the specification of the 
base year illustrate the large genuine scientific and data 
uncertainty that surrounds emissions and their main driving 
forces captured in the scenarios. The literature includes 
scenarios with additional climate polices, which are sometimes 
referred to as mitigation or intervention scenarios. There are 
many ambiguities associated with the classification of 
emissions scenarios into those that include additional climate 
initiatives and those that do not. Many cannot be classified in 
this way on basis of the information available from the 
database. Figure 1-3 indicates the ranges of emissions in 2100 
from scenarios that apparently include additional climate 
initiatives (designated as intervention emissions range), those 
that do not (non-intervention) and those that cannot be 
assigned to either of these two categories (non-classified). This 
classification is based on the subjective evaluation of the 
scenarios in the database by the members of the writing team 
and is explained in Chapter 2. The range of the whole sample 
of scenarios has significant overlap with the range of those that 
cannot be classified and they share virtually the same median 
(15.7 and 15.2 GtC in 2100, respectively) but the non-classified 
scenarios do not cover the high part of the range. Also, the 
range of the scenarios that apparently do not include climate 
polices (non-intervention) has considerable overlap with the 
other two ranges (lower bound is higher) but with a 
significantly higher median (of 21.3 GtC in 2100). 
' The 1990 emissions from energy production and use are estimated by 
Marland et al. (1994) at 5.9 GtC excluding cement production. The 1990 
base year values in the scenarios reviewed range from 4.8 
(CETA/EMF14, Scenario MAGICC CO2) to 6.4 GtC (ICAM2/EMF14); 
see Dowlatabadi and Kandlikar 1995; Peck andTeisberg, 1995.

Figure 1-3: Global energy-related and industrial COj emissions - historical development and future scenarios, shown as an 
index (1990 = 1). The median (50*), the 5*, 25*, 75* and 95"' percentiles of the frequency distribution are shown. The 
statistics associated with scenarios from the literature do not imply probability of occuiTcnce (e.g., the frequency distribution 
of the scenarios may be influenced by the use of IS92a as a reference for many subsequent studies). The emissions paths 
indicate a wide range of future emissions. The range is also large in the base year 1990 and is indicated by an "eiTor" bar. To 
separate the variation due to base-year specification from different future paths, emissions are indexed for the year 1990, when 
actual global energy-related and industrial COj emissions were about 6 GtC. The coverage of COj emissions sources may vary 
across the 256 different scenarios from the database included in the figure. The scenario samples used vary across the time 
steps (for 1990 256 scenarios, for 2020 and 2030 247, for 2050 220, and for 2100 190 scenarios). Also shown, as vertical bars 
on the right of the figure, are the ranges of emissions in 2100 for scenarios from the literature that apparently include 
additional climate initiatives (designated as "intervention" scenarios emissions range), those that do not ("non-intervention"), 
and those that cannot be assigned to either of these two categories ("non-classified"). This classification is based on the 
subjective evaluation of the scenarios in the database by the members of the writing team and is explained in Chapter 2. Data 
sources: Morita and Lee, 1998a, 1998b; Nakicenovic et a l . , 1998. 
Historically, gross COj emissions have increased at an average 
rate of about 1.7% per year since 1900 (Nakicenovic et a l . , 
1996); if that historical trend continues global emissions would 
double during the next three to four decades and increase more 
than sixfold by 2100. Many scenarios in the database describe 
such a development. However, the range is very large around 
this historical trend so that the highest scenarios envisage more 
than a sevenfold increase of global emissions by 2100 as 
compared with 1990, while the lowest have emissions lower 
than those of today. The median and the average of the 
scenarios lead to about a threefold emissions increase over the 
same time period or to about 16 GtC. This is lower than the 
median of the IS92 set and is lower than the IS92a scenario, 
often considered as the "central" scenario with respect to some 
of its tendencies. However, the distribution of emissions is 
asymmetric. The thin emissions "tail" that extends above the 
95* percentile (i.e., between the six and tenfold increase of 
emissions by 2100 compared to 1990) includes only a few 
scenarios. The range of other emissions and the main scenario 
driving forces (such as population growth, economic 
development and energy production, conversion and end use) 
for the scenarios documented in the database is also large and 
comparable to the variation of CO^ emissions. Statistics

probability of occurrence or likelihood of the scenarios. The 
frequency distribution of the database may be influenced by the 
use of lS92a as a reference for scenario studies.

N a r r a t i v e Storylines 
and Scenario 
Q u a n t i f i c a t i o n s 
Given these large ranges of future emissions and their driving 
forces, there are an infinite number of possible alternative 
futures to explore. The SRES scenarios cover a finite, albeit a 
very wide, range of future emissions. To facilitate the process 
of identifying alternative future developments, the writing team 
decided to describe their scenarios coherently by narrative 
storylines. The storylines describe developments in many 
different economic, technical, environmental and social 
dimensions. The main reasons for formulating storylines are to: 
• 
help the writing team to think more coherently about 
the complex interplay between scenario driving forces 
within each and across alternative scenarios; 
7 0 
B a c k g r o u n d a n d 
O v e r v i e w 
• 
make it easier to explain the scenarios to tlie various 
• 
user communities by providing a narrative description 
of alternative futures that goes beyond quantitative 
scenario features; 
• 
make the scenarios more useful, in particular to 
analysts who contribute to IPCC WGII and WGIII; the 
social, political and technological context described in 
the scenario storylines is all-important in analyzing the 
effects of policies either to adapt to climate change or 
• 
to reduce GHG emissions; and 
• 
provide a guide for additional assumptions to be made 
in detailed climate impact and mitigation analyses, 
because at present no single model or scenario can 
possibly respond to the wide variety of informational 
and data needs of the different user communities of 
long-term emissions scenarios. 
The writing team consciously applied the principle of Occam's 
Razor (i.e., the economy of thought, Eatwell et a l . , 1998). They 
sought the minimum number of scenarios that could still serve 
as an adequate basis to assess climate change and that would 
still challenge policy makers to test possible response strategies 
against a significant range of plausible futures. The team 
decided on four storylines, as an even number helps to avoid 
the impression that there is a "central" or "most likely" case. 
The writing team wanted more than two storylines to help to 
illustrate that the future depends on many different underlying 
dynamics; the team did not want more than four, as it wanted 
to avoid complicating the process by too many alternatives. 
The scenarios would cover a wide range of - but not all 
possible - futures. In particular, there would be no "disaster" 
scenarios. None of the scenarios include new explicit climate 
policies. The team decided to carry out sensitivity tests within 
some of the storylines by considering alternative scenarios with 
different fossil-fuel reserves, rates of economic growth, or rates 
of technical change. 
The storylines describe developments in many different social, 
economic, technological, environmental and policy dimensions. 
The titles of the storylines have been kept simple: A I , A2, B l 
and B2. There is no particular order among the storylines; they 
are listed in the alphabetic and numeric order: 
• 
The A I storyline and scenario family describes a future 
world of very rapid economic growth, low population 
growth, and the rapid introduction of new and more 
efficient technologies. Major underlying themes are 
convergence among regions, capacity building and 
increased cultural and social interactions, with a 
substantial reduction in regional differences in per 
capita income. The A l scenario family develops into 
four groups that describe alternative directions of 
technological change in the energy system.** 
^ Please note that in the Summary for Policymakers, two of these 
groups were merged into one. See also the endnote in Box 1 -2. 
The A2 storyline and scenario family describes a very 
heterogeneous worid. The underlying theme is self-
reliance and preservation of local identities. Fertility 
patterns across regions converge very slowly, which 
results 
in high population 
growth. Economic 
development is primarily regionally oriented and per 
capita economic growth and technological change are 
more fragmented and slower than in other storylines. 
The B l storyline and scenaiio family describes a 
convergent world with the same low population growth 
as in the A l storyline, but with rapid changes in 
economic structures toward a service and information 
economy, with reductions in material intensity, and the 
introduction 
of 
clean 
and 
resource-efficient 
technologies. The emphasis is on global solutions to 
economic, social, and environmental sustain ability, 
including improved equity, but without additional 
climate initiatives. 
• 
The B2 storyline and scenario family describes a world 
in which the emphasis is on local solutions to 
economic, social, and environmental sustainability. It is 
a world with moderate population growth, intermediate 
levels of economic development, and less rapid and 
more diverse technological change than in the В1 and 
AI 
storylines. While the scenario is also oriented 
toward environmental protection and social equity, it 
focuses on local and regional levels. 
Figure 1-4 schematically illustrates the SRES scenarios. It 
shows that the scenarios build on the main driving forces of 
GHG emissions. Each scenario family is based on a common 
specification of the main driving forces. The four scenario 
families are illustrated, very simplistically, as branches of a 
two-dimensional tree. The two dimensions indicate global 
and regional scenario orientation and development and 
environmental orientation, respectively. In reality, the four 
scenarios share a space of a much higher dimensionality 
given the numerous driving forces and other assumptions 
needed to define any given scenario in a particular modeling 
approach. 
After determining the basic features and driving forces for each 
of the four storylines, the teams began to model and quantify 
them. This resulted in 40 scenarios, each constituting an 
alternative inteipretation and quantification of a storyline. All 
the interpretations and quantifications associated with a single 
storyline are called a scenario "family" (see also Box 1-2 on 
terminology and Chapter 4 for further details). 
In all, six models were used to generate the 40 scenarios: 
• 
Asian Pacific Integrated Model (AIM) from the 
National Institute of Environmental Studies in Japan 
(Morita et a l . , 1994); 
• 
Atmospheric Stabilization Framework Model (ASF) 
from ICF Consulting in the USA (Lashof and Tirpak, 
1990; Pepper et a l . , 1992, 1998; Sankovski et a i , 
2000);

SRES Scenarios 
Figure 1-4: Schematic illustration of SRES scenarios. The 
four scenario "families" are illustrated, very simplistically, as 
branches of a two-dimensional tree. In reality, the four 
scenario families share a space of a much higher 
dimensionality given the numerous assumptions needed to 
define any given scenario in a particular modeling approach. 
The schematic diagram illustrates that the scenarios build on 
the main driving forces of GHG emissions. Each scenario 
family is based on a common specification of some of the 
main driving forces. 
• 
Integrated Model to Assess the Greenhouse Effect 
(IMAGE) from the National Institute for Public Health 
and Environmental Hygiene (RIVM) (Alcamo et a l . , 
1998; 
de Vries et a i , 1994, 1999, 2000), used in 
connection with the Dutch Bureau for Economic Policy 
Analysis (СРВ) WorldScan model (de Jong and Zalm, 
1991), the Netherlands; 
• 
Multiregional Approach for Resource and Industry 
Allocation (MARIA) from the Science University of 
Tokyo in Japan (Mori and Takahashi, 1999; Mori, 
2000); 
• 
Model for Energy Supply Strategy Alternatives and 
their General Environmental Impact (MESSAGE) from 
the Intemational Institute of Applied Systems Analysis 
(IIASA) in Austria (Messner and Strubegger, 1995; 
Riahi and Roehrl, 2000); and the 
• 
Mini Climate Assessment Model (MiniCAM) from the 
Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in the 
USA (Edmonds et a l . , 1994, 1996a, 1996b). 
These six models are representative of emissions scenario 
modeling approaches and different l A frameworks in the 
literature and include so-called top-down and bottom-up 
models. 
The six models have different regional aggregations. The 
writing team decided to group the various global regions into 
four "macro-regions" common to all different regional 
aggregations across the six models. The four macro-regions 
(see Appendix III) are broadly consistent with the allocation of 
the countries in the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate 
Change 
(UNFCCC, 
1997), 
although 
the 
correspondence is not exact because of changes in the 
countries listed in Annex 1 of the UNFCCC: 
• 
The OECD90 region groups together all countries that 
belong to the OECD as of 1990, the base year of the 
participating models, and coiTesponds to Annex II 
countries under UNFCCC (1992). 
• 
The REF region comprises tiiose countries undergoing 
economic reform and groups together the East 
European countries and the Newly Independent States 
of the former Soviet Union. It includes Annex I 
countries outside Annex II as defined in UNFCCC 
(1992). 
• 
The ASIA region stands for all developing (non-Annex 
I) countries in Asia. 
• 
The A L M region stands for rest of the world and 
includes all developing (non-Annex I) countries in 
Africa, Latin America and the Middle East. 
In other words, the OECD90 and REF regions together 
correspond to the developed (i.e., industrialized) countries 
while the ASIA and A L M regions together coiTespond to the 
developing countries. The OECD90 and REF regions are 
consistent with the Annex I countries in the Framework 
Convention on Climate Change, while the ASIA and 
A L M 
regions correspond to the non-Annex I countries.

their 
I m p l i c a t i o n s 
The 40 SRES scenarios cover the full range of GHG and SO, 
emissions consistent with the storylines and underlying ranges 
of driving forces from studies in the literature as documented 
in the SRES database. The four marker scenarios are 
characteristic of the four scenario families and jointly capture 
most of the ranges of emissions and driving forces spanned by 
the full set of scenarios. Figure 1-6 illustrates the range of 
global energy-related and industrial CO^ emissions for the 40 
SRES scenarios against the background of all the emissions 
scenarios in the SRES scenario database shown in Figure 1-3. 
Figure 1-6 also shows a range of emissions of the four scenario 
families 
Figure 1-6 shows that the SRES scenarios cover most of the 
range of global energy-related CO2 emissions from the 
literature, from the 95* percentile at the high end of the 
distribution down to low emissions just above the 5* percentile 
of the distribution. Thus, they only exclude the most extreme 
emissions scenarios found in the literature - those situated in 
the tails of the distribution. What is perhaps more important is

Figure 1-5: Schematic illustration of SRES scenarios. The set of scenarios consists of four scenario families: A l , A2, Bl and 
B2. Scenario family A l is further subdivided mto four scenario groups: AlC, AIG, AlB and AIT, (see also note below), 
resultmg in seven scenario groups together with the other three scenario families. Each famUy and group consists of a number 
of scenarios. Some of them have "harmonized" driving forces and share the same prespecified population and gross world 
product (a few that also share common final energy trajectories are called "fully harmonized"). These are marked as "HS" for 
harmonized scenarios. One of the harmonized scenarios, origmally posted on the open-process web site, is called a "marker 
scenario." All other scenarios of the same family based on the quantification of the storyline chosen by the modeling team are 
marked as "OS." Six modeling groups developed the set of 40 emissions scenarios. The GHG and SOj emissions of the 
scenarios were standardized to share the same data for 1990 and 2000 on request of the user communities. The time-
dependent standardized emissions were also translated into geographic distributions. 
SRES Terminology 
IVfodel: a formal representation of a system that allows quantification of relevant system variables. 
Storyline: a narrative description of a scenario (or a family of scenarios) highlighting the main scenario characteristics, 
relationships between key driving forces, and the dynamics of the scenarios. 
Scenario: a description of a potential future, based on a clear logic and a quantified storyline. 
Family: scenarios that have a similar demographic, societal, economic and technical-change storyline. Four scenario families 
comprise the SRES: A l , A2, Bl and B2. 
Group: scenarios within a family that reflect a variation of the storyline. TheAl scenario family includes four groups designated 
by AIT, AlC, AIG and AlB (see also note below) that explore altemative structures of future energy systems. In the Summary 
for Policymakers, the A l C and AIG groups have been combined into one "fossil intensive" AlFI scenario group, thus reducing 
the number of groups constituting the A l scenario family to three. The other three scenario families consist of one group each. 
Category: scenarios are grouped into four categories of cumulative CO^ emissions between 1990 and 2100: low, medium-low, 
medium-high, and high emissions. Each category contains scenarios with a range of different driving forces yet similar 
cumulative emissions. 
Marker: a scenario that was originally posted on the SRES web site to represent a given scenario family. A marker is not 
necessarily the median or mean scenario. 
Illustrative: a scenario that is illustrative for each of the six scenario groups reflected in the Summary for Policymakers of this 
report (after combining AIG and A l C into a single AlFI group). Tliey include foiu- revised "scenario markers" for the scenario 
groups AlB, A2, B l and B2, and two additional illustrative scenarios for the AlFI and AIT groups. See also "(Scenario) Groups" 
and "(Scenario) IVIarkers." 
Harmonized: harmonized scenarios within a family share common assumptions for global population and GDP while fully 
harmonized scenarios are within 5% of the population projections specified for the respective marker scenario, within 10% of 
the GDP and within 10% of the marker scenario's final energy consumption. 
Standardized: emissions for 1990 and 2000 are indexed to have the same values. 
Other scenarios: scenarios that are not harmonized. 
Note: During the approval process of the Summary for Policymakers at the 5th Session of WGIII of the IPCC from 8-11 March 200Ü m 
Katmandu, Nepal, it was decided to combine the AlC and AIG groups into one "fossil intensive" group AlFI in contrast to the non-fossil 
group AIT, and to select two illustrative scenarios from these two Al groups to facilitate use by modelers and policy makers. This leads to six 
scenario groups that constitute the four scenario families, three of which are in the Al family. Ibese six groups all have "illustrative scenarios," 
four of which are marker scenarios. All scenarios are equally sound. See also Figure SPM-1.

Figure 1-6: Range of global energy-related and industrial C O j emissions for the 40 SRES scenarios. The dashed time-paths 
depict individual SRES scenarios and the shaded area the range of scenarios from the SRES database. The median (50*), 5*, 
and 95* percentiles of the frequency distribution are shown. The statistics associated with scenarios from the literature do not 
imply probability of оссштепсе (e.g., the frequency distribution of the scenarios may be influenced by the use of IS92a as a 
reference for many subsequent studies). The 40 SRES scenarios are classified into groups that constitute four scenario families. 
Joindy the scenarios span most of the range of the scenarios in the literature. The emissions profiles are dynamic, ranging from 
continuous increases to those that curve thi'ough a maximum and then decline. The colored vertical bars indicate the range of 
the four SRES scenario families in 2100. The black vertical bar shows the range of the IS92 scenarios. See also the note in 
Box 1.2. 
that each of the four scenario families covers a sizable part of 
this distribution, which implies that a similar quantification of 
driving forces can lead to a wide range of future emissions. 
More specifically, a given combination of the main driving 
forces is not sufficient to uniquely determine a future emissions 
path. There are too many uncertainties. The fact that each of the 
scenario families covers a substantial part of the literature 
range also leads to an overlap in the emissions ranges of the 
four families. This implies that a given level of future 
emissions can arise from very different combinations of 
driving forces. This result is of fundamental importance for the 
assessment of climate-change impacts and possible mitigation 
and adaptation strategies. Thus, it wanants some further 
discussion. The emissions paths of the A l and B2 scenario 
families perhaps best illustrate these implications. 
The A l scenario family has explored variations in energy 
systems most explicitly and hence covers the largest part of the 
scenario distribution shown in Figure 1 -6, from the 95* to just 
above the 10* percentile. The A l marker (AIB) scenario 
represents a structure of the future energy mix, balanced in the 
sense that it does not rely too heavily on one particular energy 
source. The A l scenario family includes different groups of 
scenarios that explore different specific structures of future 
energy systems, from carbon-intensive development paths to 
high rates of decarbonization as captured by the two illustrative 
scenarios that span most of the emissions range for the A l 
family. All groups otherwise share the same assumptions about 
the main driving forces. This indicates that different structures 
of the energy system can lead to basically the same vaiiation in 
future emissions as can be generated by different combinations 
of the other main driving forces - population, economic 
activities and energy consumption levels. The implication is 
that decarbonization of energy systems - the shift from carbon-
intensive to less carbon-intensive and carbon-free sources of 
energy - is of similar importance in determining the future 
emissions 
paths as other 
driving 
forces. 
Sustained 
decarbonization requires the development and successful 
diffusion of new technologies. Thus investments in new 
technologies during the coming decades might have the same 
order of influence on future emissions as population growth, 
economic development and levels of energy consumption taken 
together. 
For example, the comparison of the A I B and B2 marker 
scenarios indicates that they have similar emissions of about 
13.5 and 13.7 GtC by 2100, respectively. The dynamics of the 
paths are different so that they have different cumulative CO^ 
emissions. To facilitate such comparisons, the scenarios were 
grouped into four categories of cumulative emissions between 
74 
B a c k g r o u n d a n d O v e i - v i e w 
1990 and 2100. This categorization can guide comparisons 
using either scenarios with different driving forces yet similar 
emissions, or scenarios with similar- driving forces but different 
emissions. This characteristic of SRES scenarios also has very 
important implications for the assessment of climate-change 
impacts, mitigation and adaptation strategies. Two future 
worlds with fundamentally different characteristic features, 
such as AIB and B2 marker scenarios, also have different 
cumulative COj emissions and radiative forcing, but very 
similar COj emissions in 2100. In contrast, scenarios that are 
in the same category of cumulative emissions can have 
fundamentally different driving forces and different CO,, 
emissions in 2100, but very similar cumulative emissions and 
radiative forcing. Presumably, adverse impacts and effective 
adaptation measures would vary among the scenarios from 
different families that share similar cumulative emissions but 
have different demographic, socio-economic and technological 
driving forces. This is another reason for considering the entire 
range of future emissions in future assessments of climate 
change. There is no single "best guess" or central scenario. 
The SRES emissions scenaiios also have different emissions 
for other GHGs and chemically active species such as carbon 
monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and volatile organic hydrocarbons. 
The emissions of other gases follow dynamic patterns much 
like those shown in Figure 1-6 for 
emissions. Further 
details about G H G emissions are given in Chapter 5. Emissions 
of sulfur aerosol precursors portray even more dynamic 
patterns in time and space than the C O , emissions shown in 
Figure 1-6. Factors other than climate change, namely regional 
and local air quality, and transformations in the structure of the 
energy system and end use intervene to limit future emissions. 
In view of the significant adverse impacts, SOj emissions in 
the scenarios are increasingly controlled outside countries of 
the OECD. As such the SRES scenarios reflect both recent 
legislation in North America and in Europe and recent policy 
initiatives in a number of developing countries aimed at 
reducing SOj emissions (reviewed in more detail in Chapters 3 
and 5). As a result, in the second half of the 2 F ' century both 
the trends and regional patterns of SO^ emissions evolve 
differently from those of CO, emissions in the SRES scenarios. 
Emissions outside OECD90 rise initially, most notably in 
ASIA, and compensate for declining OECD90 emissions. Over 
die long term, however, SO, emissions decline throughout the 
world, but the timing and magnitude vary across the scenaiios. 
One important implication of this varying pattern of SOj 
emissions is that the historically important, but uncertain 
negative radiative forcing of sulfate aerosols may decline in the 
very long run. 
A n important feature of the SRES scenarios is their 
implications for radiative forcing. A vigorous increase of 
global SOj emissions during the next few decades across most 
of the scenarios followed by a decline thereafter will lead to a 
coolmg effect that will differ from the effect that results from 
the continuously increasing SOj emissions in the IS92 
scenarios. On one hand, the reduction in global SOj emissions 
reduces the role of sulfate aerosols in determining future 
climate toward the end of the 21" century and therefore reduces 
one aspect of uncertainty about future climate change (because 
the precise forcing effect of sulfate aerosols is highly 
uncertain). On the other hand, uncertainty increases because of 
the diversity in spatial patterns of SO2 emissions in the 
scenarios. Future assessments of possible climate change need 
to account for these different spatial and temporal dynamics of 
G H G and SOj emissions, and they need to cover the whole 
range of radiative forcing associated with the scenarios.

Structure of the Report 
The report consists of six chapters and 11 appendices. After 
this introductory chapter. Chapters 2 and 3 present the scenario 
literature review and analysis. Chapters 4 and 5 describe the 
new SRES scenarios. Chapter 6 summarizes the main findings, 
and the appendices present the méthodologie approach and 
statistical background material. 
Chapter 2 presents the assessment of anthropogenic GHG 
emissions scenarios and their main driving forces based on an 
extensive literature review. It describes the unique scenario 
database developed for this study, which contains over 400 
global and regional scenarios. The chapter presents the range 
of emissions from the scenarios in the literature with associated 
statistics such, as medians, percentiles and histograms. The 
main scenario driving forces are analyzed in the same way, 
from population and economic development to energy. 
Chapter 3 reviews the main driving forces of past and possible 
future 
anthropogenic 
G H G emissions. These include 
demographic, economic and social development, changes in 
resources and technology, agriculture and land-use change, and 
policy issues other than those related to climate. The 
relationships and possible interactions among the driving 
forces are highly complex and heterogeneous. The focus of the 
chapter is to provide an overview of the main driving forces 
and their possible relationships that are particularly relevant for 
the SRES scenarios. 
Chapter 4 presents the naiTative scenario storylines and the 
quantification of the main scenario driving forces with the six 
SRES IA models. First, an overview of the four storylines is 
given which describes their main characteristics, relationships 
and implications. Then, the 40 scenario quantifications of the 
four storylines with the six models are presented. For each 
storyline one scenario is designated as a representative marker 
scenario. Together the 40 scenarios span the range of scenario 
driving forces and their relationships presented in the previous 
two chapters. 
Chapter 5 documents anthropogenic GHG and SO2 emissions 
for the 40 SRES scenarios highlighting the four marker 
scenarios. First, COj emissions are presented, followed by 
other GHGs, and by the assessment of indhrect effects and 
aerosols. Together the 40 scenarios span the emissions ranges 
from the literature and the four marker scenarios jointly 
B a c k g r o u n d a n d 
O v e r v i e w 
75 
characterize both the dynamics of emissions pattems and their 
ranges. 
Chapter 6 summarizes the main characteristics of the SRES 
scenarios and findings and compares the new scenarios with 
the IS92 set as well as with other scenarios from the literature. 
The 
chapter addresses possible implications of the new 
scenarios for future assessments of climate change and 
concludes with recommendations from the writing team for 
user communities. 
Finally, 11 appendices conclude the report. They include for 
example the SRES Terms of Reference, a technical appendix 
that describes the six modeling approaches used to formulate 
the 40 scenarios, the scenario database and tables with further 
statistics that describe the new scenarios.

Introduction 
Presented in tliis cliapter is tlie assessment of more than 400 
global and regional greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions scenarios 
based on an extensive literature review. Emissions scenarios 
provide an important input for the assessment of future climate 
change. Future anthropogenic GHG emissions depend on 
numerous driving forces, including population growth, 
economic development, energy supply and use, land-use 
pattems, and a host of other human activities. These main 
driving forces that determine the emissions trajectories in the 
scenarios often also provide input to assess possible emissions 
mitigation strategies and possible impacts of unabated 
emissions. In view of the many different uses, it is not 
surprising that numerous emissions scenarios are presented in 
the literature and that the number of regional and global 
emissions scenarios is growing. 
An important characteristic of the scenarios in this Special Report 
on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) is that they reflect the underlying 
uncertainty, part of which derives from the range of emissions in 
the literature. The objective was to encompass the variation within 
the most important scenario driving forces and emissions, the 
complexity of possible relationships between driving forces and 
emissions, and the associated uncertainties that characterize 
altemative future developments. The SRES scenarios cover most 
of the range of the GHG emissions scenarios found in the 
Hterature, including the International Panel on CHmate Change 
(IPCC) 1992 Scenarios (IS92) series (Leggett et al., 1992). The 
writmg team considered the literature in creating a new set of 
scenarios. Importantly, however, the literature on existing 
scenarios provides only a general framework to aid analysis; it is 
mformative, but not determinative. 
The literature review consists of four parts; 
• 
documentarion of as many as possible of the 
quantitative global and regional emissions scenarios 
available both in the open literature and from 
international activities that involve documentation of 
submitted scenarios; 
• 
development of a scenario database to document the 
more than 400 emissions scenarios collected during the 
literature review; 
• 
evaluation of the ranges and relationships of the main 
scenario driving forces and the resultant emissions for 
the scenarios documented in the database; and 
• 
assessment of the scenario submissions received 
tlirough the SRES "open process." 
These four components of the literature review are well suited 
to document and assess the (quantitative) scenarios that assign 
numeric values to describe the future evolution of driving 
forces and emissions. 
Central to this assessment of emissions scenarios and their 
main driving forces is a unique scenario database developed by 
the National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES) in 
Japan for SRES (Morita and Lee, 1998). The database 
version of 3 April 1998, which is assessed in this chapter, 
includes 416 different scenarios. The current database 
version 
can 
be 
accessed 
through 
an 
ftp-site 
(www-cger.nies.go.jp/cger-e/db/ipcc.html). It is the most 
comprehensive collection of emissions scenarios in the 
publicly available literature. It includes most of the recent 
global and regional scenarios and all of the scenarios used in 
the latest IPCC evaluation of emissions scenarios (Alcamo et 
a l . , 1995). Therefore, the emissions scenarios documented in 
the database are representative of the literature in general. 
However, there are a number of ways in which the coverage 
of the scenarios in the database could be extended in the 
future. For example, inclusion of long-term emissions 
scenarios for individual countries, when available, would 
improve the regional coverage (e.g., Parikh, 1996; Murthy et 
a l . , 1997). Also, a large majority of the scenarios report only 
energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions (230 
scenarios), while only some report non-energy CO, and other 
GHG emissions. This shortcoming of the emissions scenarios 
in the literature was identified in the last IPCC evaluation 
(Alcamo et a l . , 1995). 
The scenarios in the database were collected from 171 different 
literature sources and other scenario-evaluafion activities, such 
as the Energy Modeling Forum (EMF; 
see Weyant, 1993) and 
the International Energy Workshop (lEW; see Manne and 
Schrattenholzer, 1996, 1997). The scenarios span a wide range 
of assumptions about demographic trends, levels of economic 
development, energy consumption and efficiency pattems, and 
other factors. The aim of this chapter is to show how the 
database can be utilized for the analysis of GHG emissions 
ranges and their main driving forces. Part of this assessment of 
the emissions scenarios is based on an earlier publication on 
the analysis of scenarios documented in the SRES database 
(Nakicenovic e t a l , 1998a). 
The scenarios in the database display a large range of future 
GHG 
emissions. Part of the range can be attributed to the 
different methods and models used to formulate the scenarios, 
which include simple spreadsheet models, economic models, 
and systems-engineering models. However, most of the range 
results from differences in the input assumptions of the 
scenarios, in particular those of the main scenario driving 
forces. In addition, simply to compare altemative emissions 
levels across different scenaiios is not sufficient to shed light 
on internal consistency, plausibility, and comparability of the 
assumptions behind the scenarios. Analysis of the underlying 
driving forces is thus also an important part of the evaluation. 
This chapter provides an analysis of the main driving forces, 
such as population growth, economic growth, energy 
consumption, and energy and carbon intensities. Some of these 
driving forces are specified as model inputs, and some are 
derived from model outputs, so it is necessaiy to determine the 
assumed relationships among the main driving forces. 
Although the scenario database is well suited for the 
documentation of quantitative scenarios, there is also a 
8 0 
A n O v e r v i e w of t h e S c e n a r i o L i t e r a t u r e 
significant literature on narrative scenarios. Both scenario types 
have in common that they are generally careñiUy constructed 
descriptions of possible future developments within the bounds 
of explicit assumptions and ckcumstances (see Chapter 1 for a 
more detailed discussion about scenarios). The difference is that 
the quantitative scenarios are usually developed with the help of 
formal models so as to assign internally consistent values to the 
various scenario characteristics. 
The SRES scenarios employ both approaches - a storyline that 
gives a broad, nairative, and qualitative scenario description 
plus a number of quantifications of each storyline with six 
different models. Thus, even though both narrative stories and 
quantitative scenarios are an integral part of the SRES 
emissions scenarios, the literature review focused on the 
documentation and the assessment of quantitative scenarios, 
for 
two reasons. First, it was not possible to devise a 
classification system that would allow the documentation of 
many different forms of natjative scenarios. Second, the SRES 
objective was to develop a set of numeric emissions scenarios 
for use in the IPCC and other assessments of climate change. 
Therefore, in this chapter the focus is only on the literature 
review of quantitative scenarios. A more detailed discussion of 
narrative scenarios is given in Chapter 4; it deals with the four 
SRES storylines and how they are related to recent work in the 
area of qualitative scenarios. 
The literature on quantitative scenarios is large indeed. This 
assessment is focused on the scenarios that extend at least to 
2020, but about 10 scenarios with a shorter time horizon of 
2010 are also included in the database. In addition, most of the 
scenarios have a global coverage, although a few regional 
scenarios are included to enhance the coverage of some parts of 
the world. These criteria narrowed considerably the number of 
global and regional GHG emissions scenarios witii sufficient 
information to be included m the scenario literature review. 
This scenario literature review and evaluation is the second 
undertaken by the IPCC. The first was conducted to evaluate 
the IS92 set of scenarios in comparison to other G H G 
emissions scenarios found in the literature (Alcamo et a l . , 
1995)4 It was completed in 1994 and included a 
comprehensive evaluation of GHG emissions and their main 
driving forces. This second review and evaluation builds upon 
and extends the earlier IPCC assessment. Consequently, an 
effort was made in the present review to include especially the 
GHG emissions scenarios published since the presentation of 
the IS92 scenarios. 
2.2. 
General Overview of Scenarios 
The construction of scenarios to investigate altemative future 
developments under a set of assumed conditions dates far back. 
' The IS92 scenarios have also been analyzed with regard to short-
term adequacy (see Gray, 1998). 
Scenarios are one of the main tools used to address the 
complexity and uncertainty of future challenges. The first 
scenarios were probably designed to help plan military 
operations, often called "war games." Today, scenarios are used 
regularly by military organizations around the world for 
training and planning purposes. Military strategists and 
teachers often use very sophisticated computer models to 
develop scenarios for a multitude of different purposes. 
Scenarios are also increasingly used by enterprises around the 
world for many commercial puiposes. Perhaps the most 
famous example is that of the Shell Group in the wake of the 
so-called oil crisis, which used scenarios to plan the corporate 
response strategies (Jefferson, 1983; Schwartz, 1991). Today, 
the use of scenarios is quite widespread.. Many scenarios, 
particularly those developed for enterprises in the energy 
sector, are quantitative and include GHG emissions. Recently, 
the World Business Council for Sustainable Development 
(WBCSD) presented a set of scenarios developed in 
collaboration with 35 major corporations (WBCSD, 1998). 
The 
SRES scenario database documents a number of such 
scenarios that are in the public domain and have been 
published. 
During the past three decades many global studies have used 
scenarios as a tool to assess future C O ^ (and in a few cases also 
other GHG) emissions. One of the fnst such global studies was 
E n e r g y i n a F i n i t e W o r l d , conducted by the Intemational 
Institute of Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) during the late 
1970s (Hafele et a l , 1981). Another influential series of 
scenarios that included the assessment of COj emissions was 
developed by the Worid Energy Council (WEC, 1993). 
Recently, IIASA and WEC jointly presented a set of global and 
regional scenarios that were developed with a set of integrated 
assessment models and then reviewed and revised thi'ough 11 
regional expert groups (Nakicenovic et a l , 1998b). Another 
recent set of three scenarios, based on elaborate narrative 
stories that described altemative futures, was developed by the 
Global Scenario Group (Raskin et a l . , 1998) and received 
considerable attention. 
Scenarios of future emissions played an important role from 
the beginning of the IPCC work. \ n 1990, the IPCC initiated 
the development of its first set of GHG emissions scenarios 
designed to serve as inputs to general circulation models 
(GCMs) and facilitate the assessments of climate-change 
impacts (Houghton et a i , 1990). Two years later, in 1992, the 
IPCC approved six new emissions scenarios (IS92) that 
provided altemative emissions trajectories for the years 1990 
through 2100 for such radiatively active gases as COj, carbon 
monoxide (CO), methane (CH^), nitrous oxide (N2O), nitrogen 
oxides (N0^), and sulfur dioxide (SOj) (Leggett et a l , 1992). 
They were widely used by atmospheric and climate scientists 
in the preparation of scenarios of atmospheric composition and 
climate change (Alcamo et a l , 1995). In many ways, the IS92 
scenarios were pathbreaking. They were the first global 
scenarios to provide estimates of the full suite of GHGs and at 
the time were the only scenarios to provide emissions

trajectories for SO^. The IS92 scenarios are marked for 
reference in many of the illustrations herein that show the 
variation of emissions and their driving forces across the 
scenarios in the SRES database. 
An important group of emissions scenarios included in this 
literature review was compiled from two international scenario 
and model comparison activities. This first group is from the 
JEW 
and involves structured comparisons of energy and 
emissions scenarios since 1981 (Manne and Schrattenholzer, 
1996, 
1997). The participating groups provide information for 
a standardized scenario poll from which the ranges and other 
sample statistics are reported for the main driving forces and 
emissions. The other group is the E M F (Weyant, 1993) and 
also involves regular scenario comparisons, in addition to 
standardized input assumptions, such as the international oil 
price or carbon emissions taxes. Both of these international 
scenario comparison activities provide a large share of the data 
for this scenario review and comparison. They include most of 
the global and regional emissions scenarios developed by 
formal modeling approaches. A large part of these activities is 
based on the use of scenarios for the purpose of climate-change 
research. A third scientific effort that involves scenario 
comparisons is the Energy Technology Systems Analysis 
Programme (ETSAP; 
Kram, 
1993) supported by the 
International Energy Agency (lEA). The ETSAP work involves 
scenario analysis by more than 40 scientific groups from about 
20 countries using the same modeling approach. 
In addition to the many scientific, governmental, and private 
organizations throughout the world engaged in scenario-
building, some international governmental organizations 
regularly develop global and regional scenarios that include 
GHG 
emissions. For example, the l E A regularly publishes 
global energy scenarios that include CO^ emissions (lEA, 
1998). Most of these scenarios are of shorter term and so are 
not suitable for the requirements of IPCC (see Chapter 1 for 
further details). Nevertheless, they are included in this 
assessment to facilitate a more comprehensive evaluation of 
emissions and their driving forces during the next few decades. 
Some studies consider scenarios that involve explicit policies 
and measures to reduce emissions of GHGs or adapt to climate 
change. Such climate change intervention, control, or 
mitigation scenarios are an important tool for the assessment of 
policies and measures that would be required to reduce future 
GHG emissions. In this report, we use the terminology from 
the most recent IPCC evaluation of emissions scenarios 
(Alcamo et a l . , 1995). Those scenarios that include some form 
of policy intervention are refemd to as i n t e r v e n t i o n s c e n a r i o s , 
while those that do not assume any climate policy measures, 
such as the 40 SRES scenarios, are referred to as 
n o n -
i n t e r v e n t i o n s c e n a r i o s . In some cases, intervention scenarios 
go even further and investigate more radical emissions 
reductions required to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of 
these gases (in accordance with Aiticle 2 of the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC, 
1992)). In contrast, the SRES scenarios do not include any 
explicit additional climate policy initiatives in accordance with 
the Terms of Reference (see Appendix I). 
The 
SRES writing team used a general approach to identify 
intervention scenarios. According to this approach, a scenario 
is identified as an intervention scenario if it meets one of the 
following two conditions: 
• 
it incorporates specific climate change targets, which 
may 
include absolute or relative G H G limits, GHG 
concentration levels (e.g., CO2 stabilization scenaiios), 
or maximum allowable changes in temperature or sea 
level; and 
• 
it includes explicit or implicit policies and/or measures 
of which the primary goal is to reduce GHG emissions 
(e.g., a carbon tax or a poUcy encouraging the use of 
renewable energy). 
Note that this classification system is only a first step, and 
further work is needed to refine this taxonomy. 
Some scenarios in the literature are difficult to classify as 
intervention or non-intervention, such as those developed to 
assess sustainable development. These studies consider futures 
that require radical policy and behavioral changes to achieve a 
transition to a sustainable development path; Greenpeace 
formulated one of the first (Lazarus et a l . , 1993). This class of 
scenarios describes low emissions futures that sometimes, but 
not always, result from specific climate policy measures. Such 
sustainable development scenarios are also included in this 
assessment of the scenario literature. Where they do not 
include the explicit policies of the SRES criteria, they can be 
classified as non-intervention scenarios. However, there is a 
great deal of ambiguity as to what constitutes policies directed 
at climate change, as opposed to those directed at achieving 
sustainable development in general. Thus, some of these 
sustainable development scenarios are "non-classified" (i.e., 
the information available is insufficient to determine whether 
or not the scenarios included any additional climate policy 
initiatives). 
2.3. 
Emissions Scenario Database 
The SRES Emissions Scenario Database (ESD) was designed 
to fulfill several objectives: 
• 
To facilitate a thorough review and analysis of the 
literature. 
• 
To enable a statistical analysis of all scenarios in the 
database - to generate distribution functions of the 
main scenario driving forces, calculate mean and 
median values, percentiles, and other sample statistics 
(the use of such statistical analyses of the scenarios in 
the database ensures that the new SRES emissions 
scenarios generally reflect the range of emissions and 
input assumptions currenfly found in the open 
literature).

The third objective was to malee the database accessible 
through a website (www-cger.nies.go.jp/cger-e/db/ 
ipcc.html) so that data queries, browsing, data retrieval, 
and entry of new scenarios would be possible by remote 
users, and necessitated designing a database that could 
manage flexibly large amounts of data as well as 
diverse data types. 
The database serves primarily to document the GHG emissions, 
including CO2, 
CH4, N , 0 , CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons), HFCs 
(hydrofluorocarbons), and other radiatively active gases such as 
SO,, 
CO, and N 0 ^ . In addition, it includes information about 
the main driving forces of GHG emissions, such as population 
growth and economic development, usually expressed in terms 
of gross domestic product (GDP), energy consumption, and 
land use. Each of these scenario characteristics has 
subcategories and different values in time and space. The 
temporal dimension is often in steps of 10 years, but this is not 
standardized across the scenarios in the database. The spatial 
dimension refers to the regional disaggregation of the 
scenarios. Priority was given to covering all accessible 
quantitative scenarios with global and regional coverage. The 
main scenario characteristics are documented by the name and 
aggregation given in the original study. In some cases, regional 
and national scenarios are also included to improve the 
coverage of some parts of the world. (Table 2-1 lists the 
number of scenarios in the database that include a given region, 
from the global level through to some individual countries.) 
There is great diversity with respect to regional aggregation of 
scenarios in the database. Inclusion of long-term emissions 
scenarios for individual countries, when available, would 
improve the regional coverage of the database. Sectoral studies 
in developing countries, such as power system emissions (e.g., 
Chattopadhyay and Parikh, 1993) or transport system 
emissions (e.g., Ramanathan and Parikh, 1999), were also 
considered in this assessment to develop SRES emissions 
scenarios. 
A list of scenario characteristics and their frequency of 
occurrence across the 416 scenarios is given in Appendix V. 
Most of these scenarios were created after 1994. Of the 416 
scenarios 340 provide data on the global level, and 256 
scenarios of these 340 report information on C O ^ emissions. 
A large majority (230) of the scenarios report only energy-
related CO2 emissions, while only some report non-energy 
CO2 and other G H G emissions. For example, only three 
models estimate land use-related emissions: the Atmospheric 
Stabilization Framework (ASF) (Lashof and Tirpak, 1990) 
model that was used to formulate the IS92 scenarios; the 
Integrated Model to Assess the Greenhouse Effect 2 (IMAGE 
2) model (Alcamo, 1994); and the Asian-Pacific integrated 
model (AIM; Morita et a l . , 1994). Only a few scenarios report 
regional and global SOj and sulfur aerosol emissions that are 
also climatically important because of their cooling effect 
(negative radiative forcing of climate change). Box 2-1 in 
Section 2.4.1 summarizes the set of scenarios that report non-
energy-related CO2 emissions. 
The information documented in the database about emissions 
scenarios illustrates both areas that are well covered in the 
scenario fiterature and areas with substantial gaps in 
knowledge. For example, the information in the database 
strongly confirms the findings of the latest IPCC scenario 
assessment and evaluation (Alcamo et a l . , 1995). One of the 
key findings is that of all GHG emissions, COj emissions are 
by far the most frequentiy studied, and that of all the CO2 
emissions sources, fossil fuel is the source most extensively 
analyzed in the literature. In part, this is because energy-related 
sources of CO, emissions contribute more to the cun-ent and 
potential future climate forcing than any other single G H G 
released by any other human activity. In part, this is also 
because of improved data, assessment methods, and models for 
energy-related activities than for other emissions sources. 
Another information gap example is the rather diverse regional 
disaggregation chosen for different scenarios. Even when the 
regions are similar or equivalent in terms of this assessment, 
the 
names 
are 
sometimes 
different, 
which 
hampers 
comparisons. Such gaps in knowledge limit the range and 
effectiveness of the various policy options that logically follow 
from the discussion. This creates a level of uncertainty that can 
only be addressed by concentrated research efforts. 
2.4. 
Analysis of Literature 
Individual scenarios are considered independent entities in the 
database. Clearly, in practice, individual scenarios are often 
related to each other and are not always developed 
independenfly. Some are simply variants of others generated 
for a particular purpose. Many "new" scenarios are designed to 
track existing benchmark scenarios. A good example is the set 
of IS92 scenarios, especially the "central" IS92a scenario, 
which was often used as a reference from which to develop 
other scenarios. A further consideration is that not all scenarios 
are created in an equal fashion. Some are the result of elaborate 
effort, which includes extensive reviews and revisions; others 
are simply the outcome of input assumptions without much 
significant reflection. Some are based on extensive formal 
models, while others are generated using simple spreadsheets 
or even without any fomial tools at all. 
Numerous factors influence future emissions paths in the 
scenarios. Clearly, demographic and economic developments 
play a crucial role in determining emissions. However, many 
other factors are involved also, from human resources, such as 
education, institutional frameworks, and lifestyles, to natural 
resource endowments, technologic change, and intemational 
trade. Many of these important factors are not documented in 
the database, and sometimes not even in the respective scenario 
reports and publications. Some are neither quantified in the 
scenarios nor explicitly assumed in a narrative form. 
For this analysis, a simple scheme is used to decompose the 
main driving foices of GHG emissions. This scheme is based 
on the Kaya identity (Kaya, 1990; Yamaji et a l , 1991), which 
gives the main emissions driving forces as multiplicative 
8 4 
A n O v e r v i e w of t h e S c e n a r i o L i t e r a t u r e 
factors on one side of tlie identity and total COj (or GHG) 
emissions on the other. It multiplies population growth, per 
capita value added (i.e., per capita gross world product), energy 
consumption per unit value added, and emissions per unit 
energy on one side of the identity, and total COj emissions on 
the other side (Yamaji et a l . , 1991);^ it is a specific appUcation 
of a frequently used approach to organize discussion of the 
drivers of emissions through the so-called IPAT identity that 
relates impacts (I) to population (?) multiplied by affluence 
(A) and technology (T), (see Chapter 3 for a more detailed 
discussion). The same approach can be used for other 
emissions such as SO2. However, the driving forces might be 
different for some species of anthropogenic emissions. 
Apart from its simplicity, an advantage of analysis that uses the 
Kaya identity to decompose emissions into four main driving 
forces is that it facilitates at least some standardization in the 
comparison and analysis of many diverse emissions scenarios. 
This decomposition is very useful because it indicates where to 
seek differences in scenario assumptions that may account for 
differences in the resultant GHG emissions (Alcamo et a l . , 
1995). However, the identity is not used here to suggest 
causality. An important caveat is that these driving forces are 
not independent of each other; in many scenarios they 
explicitly depend on each other. For example, scenario builders 
often assume that high rates of economic growth lead to high 
capital turnover. This favors more advanced and more efficient 
technologies, which result in lower energy intensities. 
Sometimes a weak inverse relationship is assumed between 
population and economic growth. Thus, the scenario ranges for 
these main driving forces are not (necessarily) independent of 
each other. (See also the discussion of the relationships 
between the main scenario driving forces in Chapter 3.) 
In the following sections, scenario ranges are presented for 
each of the four factors in the Kaya identity that represent the 
main (energy-related) emissions driving forces: population, 
gross world product, energy consumption, energy intensity 
(energy per unit of gross world product) and carbon intensity 
(CO2 emissions per unit of energy). The ranges for CO2 and 
SO2 emissions are presented first because they represent the 
"dependent variable" in the Kaya identity. These are followed 
by scenario ranges for the other factors in the decomposition 
that represent the "independent variables" (main emissions 
scenario driving forces) in the identity. This sequence was 
chosen to present the main scenario driving forces because it 
corresponds to their representation in the Kaya identity; it does 
not imply a p r i o r i any causal relationships among the driving 
forces themselves or between the drivmg forces and CO2 
emissions. 
3 C O 2 = ( C 0 2 / E ) X ( E / G D P ) x ( G D P I P ) x P, where E represents 
energy consumption, G D P the global domestic product (or global 
value added) and P population. Changes in C O 2 emissions can be 
described by changes in these four factors or driving forces. 
Four complementary methods of analysis are used: 
• 
charts that show the distiibutions of scenarios in terms 
of 
their main characteristics and driving forces, 
including CO2 emissions, population growth, global 
GDP, energy consumption, energy intensity, and carbon 
intensity; 
• 
histograms that show the range of values of main 
scenario driving forces, together with associated 
statistics such as the mean, minimum, and maximum 
values; 
• 
"snowflake" diagrams, in which each of the axes 
represents the range of one of the key driving forces; 
and 
• 
analysis of the relationships among the main driving 
forces of energy-related CO2 emissions. 
The main findings of this scenario analysis are reported in 
Nakicenovic e t a l . (1998a).

C a r b o n D i o x i d e Emissions 
Ranges 
The span of COj emissions across all scenarios in the database 
is indeed large, with a range from more than seven times the 
current emissions levels to below current levels in 2100 (see 
Figures 2-Ia and 2-Ib). The possible interpretations of this 
large range are many. The most important is the great 
uncertainty as to how the main driving forces, such as 
population growth, economic development, and energy 
production, conversion and end use, might unfold during the 
2P' century. A large majority of the scenarios in the database 
report only energy-related COj emissions (230 of the 256 that 
report CO2 emissions), while only some report non-energy 
CO2 and other GHG emissions. Therefore, these comparisons 
of emissions scenarios focus mostly on energy-related 
emissions. Box 2-1 summarizes the set of 26 scenarios that 
report land-use CO2 emissions. 
Figure 2-la shows the global energy-related and industrial COj 
emissions pathways from the database in the form of spaghetti 
curves for the period 1990 to 2100 against the background of 
historical emissions from 1900 to 1990. These curves are 
plotted against an index on the vertical axis rather than as 
absolute values, because of large differences and discrepancies 
for the values assumed for the base year 1990 in various 
scenarios. The discrepancies may result from genuine 
differences among the scenarios (e.g., different base years, data 
sources, and definitions'^) or from simple errors in calibration. 
The 1990 emissions from energy production and use aie estimated 
by Marland et al. (1999) at 5.9 GtC excluding cement production. It 
appears as if four scenarios also include deforestation, which might 
explain relatively large differences in the base-year emissions 
compared to the other scenarios. Excluding these four scenarios, the 
1990 base-year values in the scenarios reviewed range from 4.8 to 6.4 
GtC. With the four scenarios the range is from 4.8 to 7.4 GtC.

Box 2-1: Range of Land Use COj Emissions in the Database 
About 23% of the current total anthropogenic C O j emissions arise from land-use change (Pepper et al., 1992), which makes 
it an hnportant drivmg force. Direct comparison of absolute levels of land-use CO^ emissions between scenarios in the 
database is difficult because of variations in how models depict deforestation and in how modelers classify anthropogenic and 
natural land-use fluxes. In addition, models are based on different base-year data, which further complicates comparison. For 
example, the 1990 base-year emissions estimates from land-use change (e.g., deforestation) range from 0.6 to 1.4 gigatons of 
elemental carbon (GtC). However, by indexing emissions to 1990, it is possible to make more meaningful comparisons of 
trends among the 26 scenarios in the SRES database that report land-use CO^ emissions. It is important to note tiiat only three 
modeling groups produced the 26 scenarios described here. Clearly, emissions from land-use change have not been as well 
explored by the modeling community as energy-related emissions. 
All 26 scenarios show a decrease in COj emissions from land-use change over time and are below current levels by 2100; some 
models even report emissions reductions below zero, which suggests CO^ sequestration (e.g., through afforestation). The 
emissions range is very wide during the next few decades, but narrows considerably around mid-century. For example, there is 
more than a factor ten difference (after normalizing for base-year differences) between the highest and lowest scenarios in 2020. 
(For reference, the IS92a scenario falls slightly below the median of the range.) By 2050, however, the gap between the extremes 
narrows, and by 2100 the range is very small indeed: the highest scenario shows COj emissions from land use only 2.4 times as 
great as those found in the lowest scenario. All 26 scenarios in the database report COj emissions of less than 1 GtC originating 
from land-use change m 2100, and 23% of the scenarios indicate COj sequestration by the end of the 2P' century.

actual global energy-related and industrial CO, emissions were about 6 GtC. The actual coverage of COj emissions sources may 
vary across the 256 different scenarios from the database included in the figure. The scenario samples used vary across the time 
steps (for 1990 256 scenarios, for 2020 and 2030 247, for 2050 211, and for 2100 190 scenarios). As a result of software limitations, 
only 250 scenarios can be plotted on the graph. However, the scenarios not shown are included in the assessment and have almost

Figure 2-lb gives absolute values of CO2 emissions from 
various scenarios in the database. It shows the magnitude of 
differences between the scenarios in the base year 1990 and 
gives the resultant range of emissions in 2100 directly in 
GtC^ 
Between 1900 and 1990, global CO2 emissions have increased 
at an average rate of about 1.7% per year (Nakicenovic et a l . 
5 Some of the scenarios may also include CO^ emissions from 
industrial sources. Since non-energy-related industrial emissions are 
very low compared to the energy-related COj emissions, their impact 
on the results of the statistical analyses is negligible. It also appears as 
if four scenarios also include deforestation. These scenarios tend to 
cluster around the median and none occur in the tails of the scenaiio 
frequency distribution. Therefore, they have very little influence on 
the range. 
^ The issue of large differences in the base year quantifications across 
the range of scenarios is discussed in Chapter 4, in which are 
presented the new SRES scenarios as developed by six different 
modeling approaches utilizing different base-year specifications. 
1998b). Global emissions would double during the next three 
to four decades if this historical trend were to continue. Many 
scenarios in the database describe such a development. 
However, even by 2030 the range is very large around this 
value of possible doubling of global emissions. The highest 
scenarios have emissions four times the 1990 level by 2030, 
while the lowest are barely above half that level. The 
divergence increases with time so that the highest scenaiios 
envisage a tenfold increase of global emissions by 2100. The 
lowest scenarios continue to decrease and some of them are 
consistent with emissions trajectories that lead to an eventual 
stabilization of atmospheric GHG concentrations. 
Figure 2-la indicates a large range between the highest and the 
lowest scenarios. Some of the scenarios on both extremes can 
be characterized as clear outliers in the far tails of the scenario 
distribution. Often, such scenarios are normative in nature, 
having been formulated for a paiticular purpose. However, 
even if these extreme tails are discarded the range is very wide. 
The 95* percentile corresponds to a sixfold increase (about 37 
GtC) by 2100, while the 5* percentile leads to a decrease to

about a third (2 GtC) compared to the 1990 level. This range of 
2-37 GtC in 2100 indicates the high degree of uncertainty with 
respect to the level of future G H G emissions. The emissions 
range is somewhat smaller, from 6.5 to 22 GtC, for the 25* and 
75* percentiles, respectively. However, the statistics associated 
with scenarios from the literature do not imply probability of 
their occunence. 
Some additional information about the range of future 
emissions can be obtained by examining the results from 
detailed analyses (see, e.g., Alcamo et a l . , 1996, 1998) 
conducted by Nordhaus and Yohe (1983), Edmonds et a l . 
(1986), de Vries et a l . (1994), and Mamie and Richels (1994). 
These analyses confirm that the range is very lai'ge. The 
analysis of Edmonds et a l . (1986) shows a range of 87 to 2 GtC 
by the year 2070 for the 95* and 5* percentiles, respectively; 
the range is from 27 to 4 GtC for the 75* and 25* percentiles. 
Nordhaus and Yohe (1983) estimated the range to be from 55 to 
7 GtC for the 95* and 5"' percentiles, and from 27 to 12 GtC for 
the 75* and 25* percentiles, respectively. In contrast, de Vries 
et a l . (1994) estimated a fundamentally smaller range of 24 to 
11 GtC by 2050 for the 95* and 5* percentiles, respectively, but 
they standardized some of the scenario assumptions, such as 
population and economic growth, relative to a base case. 
The SRES team also applied the criteria presented in Section 
2.2 to identify intervention scenarios from among the C O , 
emissions scenarios in the database. Of the 190 scenarios that 
reported COj emissions through the year 2100, 62 were 
classified as intervention scenarios and 88 as non-intervention 
scenarios. For 40 scenarios the infonnation available was 
insufficient to determine whether or not they included any 
climate policies. These are referred to as non-classified 
scenarios. The statistics for these three scenario samples are 
given in Table 2-2. The medians for these samples are also 
shown in Figures 2-1 с to 2-If The analysis indicates that many 
of the 88 non-intervention scenarios are emulations of IS92 
scenaiios, and many of these are emulations of IS92a. For 
example, 42 of the 88 non-intervention scenarios were 
produced by EMF-14, of which 25 are based on IS92a. 
Figure 2-lc shows spaghetti cuives for the non-intervention 
scenarios found in Table 2-2. In the year 2100 these scenarios 
cover almost the same range (1.2 GtC to 59.4 GtC) as does the 
entire sample of 190 scenarios (-2.1 GtC to 59.4 GtC). The 
sample of non-intervention scenarios includes some that have 
very low emissions, which suggests that emissions can be low 
even in the absence of explicit climate intervention policies. 
However, the non-intervention sample also has a higher median

than the total sample - 21 GtC in 2100 compared with the 15.7 
GtC median found in the total sample. The lower median of the 
total sample may result from downward pressure exerted by the 
inclusion of some intervention scenarios in the total sample. 
However, it could also result from the influence of IS92a-like 
scenarios (upward pressure) in the non-intervention sample 
(see also Figure 2-10-
Figure 2-Id likewise depicts spaghetti curves for the intervention 
scenarios. The entire range for the intervention scenarios is small 
compared to those of the no policy scenarios and the total set of 
scenarios. In 2100 the maximum (14.4 GtC) and the median (6 
GtC) of this sample are significantly lower than maximum and 
median values of the full and non-intervention sets. 
Figure 2-le shows the range for scenarios that could not be 
classified into these two groups because of insufficient 
infonnation in the database. The range of scenarios in this 
category is similar to that of the total sample in that it is very 
broad. The median of this set in 2100 is also similar to that of 
the total sample (15.7 GtC) and follows a similar trajectory. 
Finally, the IS92a scenario (Leggett et a i , 1992; Pepper et a l , 
1992) appears to have influenced subsequent emissions scenarios 
in the literature. The median population, gross world product, and 
primary energy consumption trends in many scenarios in the 
literature track very closely the developments in the IS92a 
scenario (Morita and Lee, 1998). This is because IS92a 
constituted a reference baseline that was emulated by different

The first two histograms (Figures 2-2a and 2-2b) give the 
global CO2 emissions ranges for 2050 and 2100.^ The total 
range from the highest to the lowest scenario in 2100 is 
between 59 and 2 GtC,^ from about seven times the current

emissions to below zero. For about 10% of the scenarios, 
emissions in the year 2100 are half the current emissions or 
below this level. Presumably, some of the scenarios that have 
low 
future emissions include some policy interventions to 
reduce GHG emissions. 
The distribution of emissions in 2050 is asymmetric; most of the 
scenarios cluster in the range between 20 to 6 GtC. The thin tail 
that extends above this emissions level includes only 46 of a total 
of 211 scenarios. Altogether, the distribution implies a substantial 
increase in global CO2 emissions during the next 50 years. 
The distribution of emissions in 2100 is even more asymmetric 
than that in 2050. The emissions portray a structure that 
resembles a trimodal distribution: those that show emissions of 
more than 30 GtC (20 scenarios), those with emissions 
between 12 and 30 GtC (88 scenarios), and those that show 
emissions of less than 12 GtC (82 scenarios). That this is quite 
similar to the structure of primary energy consumption 
distribution for 2100 is not by chance. The lowest cluster may 
have been influenced by many analyses of stabilization of 
atmospheric concentrations at levels of 450-550 parts per 
million (10^) by volume (ppmv). The middle cluster appears to 
echo the many analyses that took IS92a as a reference scenario; 
it indicates the possible influence of IS92 scenarios on other 
scenarios in the literature. It is very likely that the majority of

D i o x i d e 
Emissions 
An overview of global long-term scenarios of SOj emissions is 
shown in Figure 2-3. Altogether 81 scenarios in the scenario 
database report SOj emissions. Most scenarios were published 
after 1995, which indicates the importance of the influential 
and innovative 
emissions included in the previous IFCC 
scenario series IS92 (Pepper et a l , 1992). Apparently, they 
stimulated research on long-term frends and impacts of SOj 
emissions. 
The 1990 base-year emissions estimates in the database range 
from 55 to 91 megatons of sulfur (MtS), a seemingly large 
difference that can be explained partially by the different extent 
of coverage of SOj emissions in different models and scenario 
studies, in addition to uncertainties in emissions factors. 
Typically, lower range emissions derive from models that report 
only (the dominant) energy sector emissions, higher ranges also 
include other anthropogenic sources such as SO2 emissions 
from métallurgie processes. Differences in 1990 base-year 
values across scenario studies and a review of available SO2 
emissions inventories are discussed in more detail in Chapter 3. 
Indexed to a common 1990 basis, future SO2 emissions trends 
reveal a number of remarkable characteristics. Fhst, contrary to 
other trends discussed in this chapter, increases are generally 
modest; numerous scenarios even depict a long-term decline in 
emissions. Thus, SO2 emissions are invariably projected to be 
decoupled progressively from their underlying driving forces of 
increases in population and economic activity, and hence 
energy demand. The median across all scenarios indicates a 
gradual increase of some 22% over 1990 levels by 2050, and a 
return to 1990 levels by 2100. Only two scenarios exceed the 
range of increases in long-term SO, emissions spanned by the 
IS92 scenario series. 
A detailed review of long-term global and regional SO2 
emissions scenarios is given in Grübler (1998) and is 
summarized in Chapter 3. The most important new finding 
from the scenario literature is recognition of the significant 
impacts of continued unabated high SO2 emissions on human 
health, food production, and ecosystems. As a resuh, scenarios 
published since 1995 all assume various degrees of SO2 
emissions control and interventions to be implemented in the 
future, and are thus substantially lower than previous 
projections, including the IS92 series. In most of these 
scenarios, such low levels of SO^ emissions are not simply the 
result of direct SOj emissions control measures, such as flue 
gas desulfurization. They also result from other interventions 
in which SO2 emissions reduction is more a secondary benefit 
than a primary goal (e.g., structural changes for various reasons 
other than SO2 control). 
2 . 4 . 4 . 
Population 
Projection 
Ranges 
Population is one of the fundamental driving forces of future 
emissions. Most models used to formulate population 
projections for the emissions scenarios are taken from the 
literature and are exogenous inputs. Today three main research 
groups project global population - United Nations (UN, 1998, 
1999), World Bank (Bos and Vu, 1994), and IIASA (Lutz et a l , 
1997). (For more details see the discussion in Chapter 3.) Most 
of the "central" population projections lead to a doubling of 
global population by 2100 (to about 10 billion people 
compared to 5.3 billion in 1990). In recent years the central 
population projections for the year 2100 have declined 
somewhat, but are still in line with a doubling by 2100. For 
example, the latest UN (1998) medium-low and medium-high 
projections indicate a range of between 7.2 and 14.6 bilUon 
people by 2100, with the medium scenario at 10.4 billion. The 
IIASA central estimate for 2100 is also 10.4 bilUon, with a 
95% probability that world population would exceed six and be 
lower than 17 bilUon (Lutz et a l , 1997). 
While all scenarios require some kind of population 
assumptions, relatively few are reported explicitly in the SRES 
database. Figure 2-4 illustrates global population projections in 
the database. Of the 416 scenarios currently documented, only 
46 report their underlying population projections. This limited 
number indicates that, even though population is an extremely 
important driving force for emissions, it is typically either not 
reported or not well explored in most models. For the small

Figure 2-4 contrasts the altemative population projections from 
the SRES database with historical developments. The long-
term historical population growth rate has been on average 
about I % per year during the past two centuries. Between 1800 
and 1900 the global population growth rate was about 0.5% per 
year. The average annual growth rate since 1900 has been 
1.3%. Between ¡990 and 1995 the rate was 1.46%; and since 
1995 world population has been growing 
at a rate of 1.3%

annually (UN, 1998). All scenarios reviewed here envisage that 
population growth will slow in the future. The most recent 
doubling of the worid's population took approximately 40 
years. Even the highest population projections in Figure 2-4 
grouped mto three clusters. The middle cluster is representative 
of the central projections, with a range of about 10 to less than 
иШюп 
people by 2100. The other two clusters mark the 
highest and the lowest population projections available in the 
hterature, with between 15 and 20 billion at the high end and 
about 6 billion at the low end. 
Despite these lai-ge ranges among altemative global population 
projections, the variation in this factor compared to the base 
year is the smallest of all the scenario driving forces considered 
in this comparison. Compared with 1990 values, the factor 
increase varies from 3.3 to 1.2.

0.1% per year, and the median is about 0.7% per year.

Figure 2-4: Global population - historical development and 46 scenarios from the database. Fevi^er than 46 lines are shown 
because many of the 46 scenarios use identical population projections. Only 46 of the scenarios in the database identify their 
population projections. Data source: Durand, 1967; Demeny, 1990; UN, 1996; Morita and Lee, 1998. 
The historical gross world product growth rate has been about 
4% per year since 1950; in the scenarios the average annual 
growth rates to 2100 range from 3.2% per year to 1.1% per year, 
with the median value at 2.3% per year. Table 2-3 summarizes 
the future economic growth rates of the 148 scenarios in the 
database that report gross world product for 2100. This 
translates into a gross world product level in 2100 that varies 
from 3.2 (IS92c, Pepper et a l . , 1992) to more than 32 
(FUND/EMF Modeler's choice. Toi, 1995) times the 1990 gross 
world product. The 1990 gross world product was about US$20 
trillion (all values in 1990 US dollars), which translates into a 
range from more than US$700 to about US$65 trillion by 2100. 
Figure 2-5 also indicates that this full range includes a few 
noticeable outliers toward the high and low of future gross 
world product development. The rest of the scenarios are 
grouped much more closely together, which compresses the 
range to a factor increase of about 17 to 7 (129 out of 148 
scenarios) times compared to 1990. The degree of clustering is 
discussed in greater detail in the histograms that follow.

For 2050 most of the scenarios cluster in a rather narrow range 
around a value of about US$100 trillion. In total, 166 scenaiios 
were used to derive the histogram for 2050. This picture 
changes radically for the year 2100, with a very wide variation 
of gross world product values, from about US$700 to US$70 
trillion, and a median of US$250 trillion. As expected, the 
distribution of emissions becomes significantly wider as the 
scenarios extend further into the future. Most of the 
distribution is concentrated between about US$320 and 
US$160 trillion, with very thin and asymmetric tails. A very 
strong peak of values lies at around US$250 trillion, which 
apparently represents an apparent consensus among modelers 
based on an average economic growth rate of about 2.3% per 
year. The frequency of the mode is smaller in 2100 than in

For 2050 and 2100 the gross world products for the IS92a and 
b scenarios are the same as the median for all scenarios 
reviewed (Pepper et a l . , 1992). 148 different scenarios were 
used to derive the histogram for the year 2100.

Population 
and Gross 
World 
Product 
Relationships 
The 
scenarios in the database portray a weak relationship 
between population and economic growth; the correlation is 
slightly negative. Scenarios that lead to a very high gross world 
product are generally associated with central to low population 
projections, while high population projections do not lead to 
the highest gross world product scenarios. At extremely high 
levels of average global income the correlation is strongly 
negative. The highest per capita incomes in 2100 - in the range 
between US$30,000 and US$45,000 - are achieved with a low-
to-medium population growth. 
Figure 2-7 illustrates some of the relationships between 
population and gross world product in the scenarios. It 
compares only 39 scenarios as information about population 
and gross world product assumptions is available for only a few 
scenarios. In most of these, global population transition is 
achieved during the 2F' century and stabilization occurs at a 
population between 10 to 12 billion people in the year 2100. 
Generally, this is associated with relatively high levels of 
economic development, in the range US$200-500 trillion in the 
year 2100. Scenarios at the lower end of this scale are labeled 
collectively as the "mid-range cluster," which includes all 
IIASA-WEC scenarios (IIASA-WEC, 1995; Nakicenovic et a i , 
1998b), IS92a and b (Pepper et a i , 1992), and AIM96 (Matsuoka

One scenario, IS92f, shows high population growth (over 18 
billion people by 2100) with comparatively low economic 
growth (about the same level as the mid-range cluster of 
scenarios, approximately US$300 trillion). At the other side of 
the scale are the two IS92 variants (c and d (Pepper et a i , 1992» 
with low population projections (about 6 billion people by 2100). 
2.4.8. 
Primary 
Energy 
Consumption 
Ranges 
Primary 
energy 
consumption is another 
fundamental 
determinant 
of GHG emissions. Clearly, high energy 
consumption leads to high emissions. However, what is more 
important for emissions is the structure of future energy 
systems. High carbon intensities of energy - namely high 
shares of fossil energy sources, especially coal, in total energy 
consumption - lead to scenarios with the highest COj 
emissions. The primary energy paths of different scenarios are 
compared here, and the issue of energy carbon intensity is 
considered in the next section. 
Figure 2-8 shows the primary energy consumption paths in the 
scenarios and its historical development since 1900. It gives the 
whole distribution of the 153 scenarios in the SRES database 
that report primary energy consumption, the median, and the 
95*, 75"', 25*, and 5* percentiles. As a result of the relatively 
large differences in the base-year values, the primary energy 
consumption paths are plotted as an index and spliced to the 
historical data in 1990. In 1990, primary energy was about 370 
EJ, including non-commercial energy (Nakicenovic et a l . , 
1996). 
On 
average the global primary energy consumption has 
increased at more than 2% per year (fossil energy alone has 
risen at almost 3% per year) since 1900. Also, the short-term 
trend from 1975 to 1995 shows a similar increase. In the 
scenarios the average growth rates to 2100 range from 2.4% 
per year to -0.1% per year, with a median value of 1.3% per 
year. 
For the full range of scenarios, the factor increase above the 
1990 level is 0.9 to 10 by 2100.'° However, Figure 2-8 
indicates that this full range includes a few noticeable outliers, 
especially toward the high end of energy consumption levels. 
The rest of the scenarios are grouped more closely together, 
which compresses the range to a factor increase of about 1.5 to 
7.5 times the 1990 level. The degree of clustering is discussed 
in greater detail below. 
Note that the highest scenario in the database reports 3400 EJ for 
primary energy consumption by 2100. Relative to the base year of 
this scenario (340 EJ), this level corresponds to a 10-fold increase. 
However, relative to the base-year value including non-commercial 
biomass (370 EJ), this level corresponds to a nine-fold increase only.

Histograms 
The final two histograms, Figures 2-9a and 2-9b, give the global 
primary energy consumption ranges for 2050 and 2100, indexed 
to 1990. The total range in 2100 is between 330 EJ and 3400 EJ, 
which corresponds to difference of more than a factor of ten 
This factor range is about the same as the factor range for gross 
world product (10.7) and much larger than that for population.

The distribution of primary energy consumption in 2050 is 
asymmetric, with a long but thin tail toward high levels. Most 
of the distribution is between 600 and 1300 EJ, or about 
1.5-3.5 times the 1990 level of consumption. The higher value 
corresponds to the continuation of a historical growth rate of 
global primary energy consumption of about 2.2% per year. 
Most of the scenarios cluster around 1000 EJ, which is about 
three times that of 1990. A total of 145 different scenarios were 
used to derive this histogram. 
In 2100, the distribution of primary energy consumption is 
much less concentrated and covers the full range, from about 
10 times the 1990 level (to 3400 EJ) to a slight decrease by a 
factor of 0.9 (340 EJ). However, only a few scenarios occur 
toward these extreme values of the two distribution tails. The 
rest of the observations portray an interesting structure that 
resembles a trimodal distribution. The first mode is around 
2600 EJ, the second around 1700 EJ, and the third at about 700 
EJ. The median of the whole distribution is at 1500 EJ. 
Interestingly, the continuation of the historical growth rate of 
about 2.2% per year corresponds to about 11 times the 1990 
level (about 4050 EJ in 2100), well above any values observed 
in the database. Thus, in contrast to data for 2050, all the 
scenarios for 2100 foresee a level of primary energy 
consumption that is lower than that of trend extrapolation. 
Altogether, 127 different scenarios were used to derive the 
histogram for the year 2100.

Relationships 
between 
P r i m a r y Energy 
and 
Gross 
W o r l d 
Product 
In all scenarios, economic growth outpaces the increase in 
energy consumption, which leads to substantial reductions in 
the ratio of primary energy consumption to gross world 
product, also known as "energy intensity." Individual 
technologies progress, inefficient technologies are retired in 
favor of more efficient ones, the structure of the energy-supply 
system and pattems of energy services change; these factors 
reduce the amount of primary energy needed per unit of gross 
world product. With all other factors being equal, the faster the 
economic growth, the higher the turnover of capital, and the 
greater the decline in energy intensity. 
These long-term relationships between energy and economic 
development are reflected in the majority of scenarios and are 
consistent with historical experience across a range of 
altemative development paths observed in different countries. 
Figure 2-10 shows the historical relationship since 1970 
between energy intensity and GDP per capita for various world 
regions (see IIASA-WEC, 1995). This shorter record of 
development is contrasted with the experience of the USA 
since 1800. Although there are consistent differences among 
regions and energy paths, the level of energy intensities in 
developing countries today is generally comparable with the

range of the now-industrialized countries when they had the 
same level of per capita GDP (see Figure 2-10). The historical 
experiences illustrate that different countries and regions can 
follow different development paths; moreover, there are some 
persistent differences in energy intensities even at similar 
levels of per capita 
GDP. 
Global energy intensities diverge across different scenarios, as 
shown in the shaded wedge in Figure 2-10. The wedge clearly 
illustrates a persistent inverse relationship between economic 
development and energy intensity across the wide range of 
scenarios in the database, despite numerous differences among 
them. 
2 . 4 . 1 1 . 
C a r b o n Intensity 
and 
Decarbonization 
Decarbonization denotes the declining average carbon intensity 
of primary energy over time (see Kanoh, 1992). Although the 
decarbonization of the world's energy system shown in Figure 
2-11 is comparatively slow, at the rate of 0.3% per year, the 
trend has persisted throughout the past two centuries 
(Nakicenovic, 1996). The overall tendency toward lower carbon 
intensities results from the continuous replacement of fuels with 
high carbon content by those with low carbon content. 
The carbon intensities of the scenarios are shown in Figure 2-
11 as an index spliced in the base year 1990 to the historical 
development. The median of all the scenarios indicates a 
continuation of the historical trend, with a decarbonization rate 
of about 0.4% per year, which is similar to the trend in the 
IS92a scenario (Pepper et a l . , 1992). 
The scenarios that are most intensive in the use of fossil fuels 
lead to practically no reduction in carbon intensity. The highest 
rates of decarbonization (up to 3.3% per year) are from 
scenarios that envision a complete transition to non-fossil 
sources of energy. 
Figure 2-12 illustrates the relationships between energy 
intensities of gross world product and carbon intensities of 
energy across the scenarios in the database. Both intensities 
are shown on logarithmic scales. The starting point is the base 
year 1990 normalized to an index (1990 = 100) for both 
intensities. Scenarios that unfold horizontally are pure 
decarbonization cases with littie structural change in the 
economy; scenarios that unfold vertically indicate reduction in 
the energy intensity of economic activities with littie change in 
the energy system. Most scenarios stay away from these 
extremes and develop a fan-shaped pattem - marked by both 
decarbonization and declining energy intensity - across the 
graph in Figure 2-12. 
The fan-shaped graph illustrates the notable differences in 
policies and structures of the global energy system among the 
scenarios. 
For example, 
in a number 
of 
scenarios 
decarbonization is achieved largely through energy efficiency 
improvements, while in others it is mainly the result of lower 
carbon intensity because of the vigorous substitution of fuels. 
A few scenarios follow a path opposite to the other scenarios: 
decarbonization of primary energy with decreasing energy 
efficiency until 2040. After 2040 the ratio of CO, per unit of 
primary energy increases - in other words, recarbonization.

minimum value of the distribution; the solid circles denote the 
median value; and the shaded circles represml 
the maximum 
database value for each variable. While the values are 
connected in the form of a snowflake, it is important to note 
that those of a given range (e.g., minimum, median, and 
maximum), taken together, do not necessarily yield a 
consistent or logically possible scenario. As is shown in 
Chapter 4 (Figure 4-4), actual scenarios may fall into a median 
range on some axes and into a higher or lower range on others. 
Snowflake diagrams are useful because they allow the reader to 
see at a glance the full range of values encompassed by the 
database. Subsequent snowflake diagrams plot SRES scenario 
values on the vaiious axes to illustrate where the scenarios fall 
relative to the database minimum, median, and maximum 
values. Snowflake diagrams should be used only for purposes 
of scenario classification and interpretation and not for 
scenario design, since the latter could lead to logical 
inconsistencies.

Conclusions 
In this chapter a brief overview and evaluation of the emissions 
scenarios is presented. Much of the quantitative analysis of the 
emissions scenarios is based on the unique scenario database 
developed for SRES. This database, its structure, and the 
process of assembling the data that it now contains are 
described. The database provides a valuable overview of the 
various emissions modeling approaches and scenarios in the 
literature. It is the most comprehensive ESD available, and it 
can 
be accessed tlirough a website (www-cger.nies.go.jp 
/cger-e/db/ipcc.html). 
The SRES database represents the basis for evaluations of 
emissions scenarios, their main driving forces, and their 
uncertainty ranges. The CO, emissions trajectories of the 
scenarios in the SRES database are presented and their 
distribution and the associated sample statistics assessed. In the 
same way, the main driving forces of future emissions -
population, economic development and energy consumption -
are analyzed. Finally, the possible relationships among these 
driving forces for the collection of emissions scenarios in the 
database are considered. 
Future levels of CO, emissions from the energy sector are a 
function of population, gross world product, the structure and 
efficiency of the economy, and the costs and availabihty of 
different sources of energy. 
The factor range for population increases by 2100 across the 
scenarios is between 1.2 and 3.3 times 1990 levels (see Figure 
2-4). This is the smallest factor increase of all the emissions 
driving forces. This probably reflects a relatively high 
consensus among demographers as to future population 
growth. However, this observation is based on a relatively 
small number of reported population projections in the 
database (46). The range in projected gross world product 
values is between 3.2 and 35 times the 1990 levels (see Figure 
2-5). The range of the factor increase of primary energy 
consumption is from 0.9 to 10 times 1990 levels (see Figure 2-
8). For energy intensity the range in 2100 is from 9.3 MJ/LJS$ 
down to 2.3 MJ/US$. 
The range in carbon intensity of primary energy is the widest 
range of all the driving forces considered here. It varies from 
0.025 to l.I times 1990 levels (about a factor of 45) in the year 
2100 (see Figure 2-11). Emissions trajectories are extremely 
sensitive to a number of driving forces, which include 
including population growth, economic growth, and energy 
intensity improvement. Variation in carbon intensity is the 
main indicator of the wide variation in energy-related COj. 
However, it is important to recognize that this is a result of the 
inputs, assumptions, methods, and types of models used to 
calculate the scenarios. 
The findings of the analysis of the scenarios in the literature 
suggest the following general conclusions: 
• 
the ranges over which the driving forces vary are large, 
which contributes to the wide range of future 
emissions; 
• 
of these driving forces, gross world product and 
population are often exogenous, while carbon and 
energy intensity are not; 
• 
the frequency distributions of driving forces and 
emissions are asymmetric, with long tails and often 
more than one peak; 
• 
for many driving forces the median and mean are closer 
to the minimum than to the maximum; 
• 
lack of information as to whether climate intervention 
policies and measures were included in the scenarios, 
for about 40 scenarios, means that it is not possible to 
distinguish between intervention and non-intervention 
scenarios; 
• 
it is hoped that IPCC or another international institution 
will, in the futiu-e, maintain this or a similar .database so 
as to assure a continuity of knowledge and scientific 
progress in GHG emissions scenarios (an equivalent 
database to document narrative and other qualitative 
scenarios would also be very useful for future climate-
change assessments); and 
• 
it would be useful in the future to evaluate the 
consistency of the driving forces and results of all 
scenarios included in the scenario database. In addition, 
it would be helpful to extend the database to include 
land-use change data where currentiy only land-use 
emissions are presented. As noted above, only a small 
percentage of scenarios contain information on land 
use.

3.1. 
Introduction 
Some of the major driving forces of past and future 
anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which 
include demographics, economics, resources, technology, and 
(non-climate) policies, are reviewed in this chapter. Economic, 
social, and technical systems and their interactions are highly 
complex and only a limited overview is provided in this 
chapter. The discussion of major scenario driving forces herein 
is structured by considering the links from demography and 
the economy to resource use and emissions. A frequently used 
approach to organize discussion of the drivers of emissions is 
through the so-called IPAT identity, equation (3.1). 
I m p a c t = P o p u l a t i o n x A j f l u e n c e x T e c h n o l o g y 
(3.1) 
The IPAT identity states that environmental impacts (e.g., 
emissions) are the product of the level of population times 
affluence (income per capita, i.e. gross domestic product 
(GDP) 
divided by population) times the level of technology 
deployed (emissions per unit of income). The IPAT identity has 
been widely discussed in analyses of energy-related carbon 
dioxide (COj) emissions (e.g., Ogawa, 1991; Parikh et a l . , 
1991; 
Nakicenovic et a i , 1993; Parikh, 1994; Alcamo et a i , 
1995; 
Gaffin and O'Neill, 1997; Gürer and Ban, 1997; O'Neill 
et al., 2000), in which it is often refeiTcd to as the Kaya identity 
(Kaya, 1990), equation (3.2). 
C O 2 E m i s s i o n s = P o p u l a t i o n X ( G D P I P o p u l a t i o n ) X 
X ( E n e r g y / G D P ) X 
( C O J E n e r g y ) 
The Kaya multiplicative identity also underlies the analysis of 
the emissions scenario literature (Chapter 2). It can be broken 
down into further subcomponents. For instance, the energy 
component can be decomposed into fossil and non-fossil 
shares, and emissions can be expressed as carbon emissions per 
unit of fossil energy, as shown in Figure 3-1 (Giirer and Ban, 
1997). A property of the multiplicative identity is that 
component growth rates are additive. For instance, global 
energy-related COj emissions since the middle of the 19* 
century are estimated to have increased by approximately 1.7% 
per year (Watson et a l , 1996). This growth rate can be 
decomposed roughly into a 3% growth in gross world product 
(the sum of a 1% growth in population and a 2% growth in per 
capita income) minus a 1% per year decline in the energy 
intensity of world GDP (the third term in equation (3.2)) and a 
decline in the carbon intensity of primary energy (the fourth 
term) of 0,3% per year (Nakicenovic et a l , 1993; Watson et a l , 
1996). 
While the Kaya identity above can be used to organize 
discussion of the primary driving forces of CO2 emissions and, 
by extension, emissions of other GHGs, there are important 
caveats. Most important, the four terms on the right-hand side 
of equation (3.2) should be considered neither as fundamental 
driving forces in themselves, nor as generally independent 
from each other. 
Global analysis is often not instructive and even misleading, 
because of the great heterogeneity among populations with 
respect to GHG emissions. The ratios of per capita emissions 
of the world's richest countries to those of its poorest countries 
approach several hundred (Parikh et a l , 1991; Engelman, 
1994). Of course, some level of aggregation is necessary. In 
practice, the models used to produce emissions scenarios in 
this report, for example, operate on the basis of 9-15 regions 
(see Appendix IV, Table IV-1). This level of detail isolates the 
most important differences, particularly with respect to 
industrial versus developing countries (Lutz, 1993). 
The spatial and temporal heterogeneity of emission growth that 
becomes masked in the global aggregates is shown in Figure 
3-1, 
in which 
the growth in energy-related COj emissions 
since 1970 is broken down into a number of subcomponents. 
For industrial countries the population growth has been modest 
and their emissions have evolved roughly in line with increases 
(or declines) in economic activity. For developing countries 
both population and income growth appear as important drivers 
of emissions. However, even in developing countries the 
regional heterogeneity becomes masked in the aggregate 
analysis (Griibler et a l , 1993a). 
Although, at face value, the IPAT and Kaya identities suggest 
that COj emissions grow linearly with population increases, 
this depends on the real (or modeled) interactions between 
demographics and economic growth (see Section 3.2) as well 
as on those between technology, economic structure, and 
affluence (Section 3.3). In principle, such interactions preclude 
a simple linear interpretation of the role of population growth 
in emissions. 
Demographic development interacts in many ways with social 
and economic development. Fertility and mortality trends 
depend, among other things, on education, income, social 
norms, and health provisions. In turn, these determine the size 
and age composition of the population. Many of these factors 
combined are recognized as necessary to explain long-run 
productivity, economic growth, economic structure, and 
technological change (Barro, 1997). In turn, long-run per 
capita economic growth and structural change are closely 
linked with advances in knowledge and technological change. 
In fact, long-run growth accounts (e.g., Solow, 1956; Denison, 
1962, 
1985; Maddison, 1989, 1995; Barro and Sala-I-Martin, 
1995) confirm that advances in knowledge and technology may 
be the most important reason for long-run economic growth; 
more important even than growth in other factors of production 
such as capital and labor. Abramovitz (1993) demonstrates that 
capital and labor productivity cannot be treated as independent 
from technological change. Therefore, it is not possible to treat 
the affluence and technology variables in IPAT as independent 
of each other. 
Pollution abatement efforts appear to increase with income, 
growing willingness to pay for a clean environment, and 
progress in the development of clean technology. Thus, as 
incomes rise, pollution should increase initially and later

decline, a relationship often retened to as the "environmental 
Kuznets curve." This process seems well established for 
traditional pollutants, such as particulates and sulfur (e.g., 
Worid Bank, 1992; Kato, 1996; Viguier, 1999), and there have 
been some claims that it might apply to G H G emissions. 
Schmalensee et a l . (1998) found that COj emissions have 
flattened and may have reversed for highly developed 
economies such as the US and Japan. Other researchers argue 
that the Kuznets curve does not apply to GHG emissions 
(Pearce, 1995; Galeotti and Lanza, 1999, Viguier, 1999). The 
flattening in emissions can be explained by normal market 
processes and does not appeal' to result from a willingness to 
pay to protect the global environment. Urbanization, 
infrastructure, poverty, and income distribution are other 
factors in the complex 1п1еф1ау between population, economy, 
and environment (see, e.g., Rotmans and de Vries, 1997; de 
Vries et a i , 1999; O'Neill et a l , 2000). 
Technological, economic, and social innovation have long been 
means by which a greater number of people can live from the 
same environmental resources. The best known historical 
examples of major periods of innovation include the Neolithic 
revolution (beginnings of organized agriculture from around 
10,000 years ago); and the industrial revolution that began two 
centuries ago (Rosenberg and Birdzell, 1986). In each case, 
changes in patterns of primary production (food, energy, 
materials) are linked to changes in social organization, 
institutions, economy, and technology (e.g., Mumford, 1934; 
Campbell, 1959; Landes, 1969; Hill, 1975; Wilber, 1981; 
Buchanan, 1992; Reynolds and Cutcliffe, 1997). The most 
remarkable change in recent decades is the so-called 
demographic transition, which has led to a stabilization of 
population in many parts of the world. No single one of these 
changes can be considered as the primary driver, and they 
cannot be considered as independent from each other; each 
play a role in an interconnected system. 
Most innovative efforts in the past two centuries were devoted 
to improving labor productivity and the human ability to 
harness resources for economic purposes. While material and 
energy efficiency improved slowly, economic growth was 
faster and thus aggregate resource use increased. 
Finally, and importantly, the high uncertainty with regard to the 
nature and extent of the relationships between driving forces of 
GHG emissions means that, with current knowledge, it is not 
possible to develop probabilistic future emission scenarios. 
Even if it were possible to derive (subjective) probability 
distributions of the future evolution of individual scenario 
driving-force variables (like population, economic growth, or 
technological change), the nature of their relationships is 
known only qualitatively at best or remains uncertain (and 
controversial) in many instances. 
The next five sections review the major driving forces of GHG 
emissions within the IPAT identity. Section 3.2 discusses the 
role of population. Section 3.3 addresses economic and social 
development processes (including technological change), 
S c e n a r i o D r i v i n g F o r c e s

Section 3.4 examines energy resources and tecimology in more 
detail, and Section 3.5 addresses agriculture, forestry, and land-
use change. Section 3.6 considers other sources of П О П - С О 2 
GHÍGs. The chapter concludes with a discussion of non-climate 
policies and their potential impact on the principal driving 
forces of future emissions. Each section briefly reviews past 
trends, available scenarios, and important new methodological 
and empirical advances since the publication of previous 
International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) emissions 
scenarios in 1992 (IS92). This chapter provides the background 
to establish recommendations for the range of driving-force 
variables to be explored in the new set of scenarios. The 
available literature and current understanding of the inherent 
uncertainties in developing very long-term scenarios are 
reflected. Each section elucidates in detail the important 
relationships between scenario driving forces, as the question 
of relationships is a new and important mandate for SRES. 
Nonetheless, most attention is paid to the possible relationships 
between population and economic growth, because this is the 
area most intensively discussed in the literature.

Population projections are arguably the backbone of G H G 
emissions scenarios, and are comparable in some ways with 
them. Population projections cover timeframes of a century or 
more, and they involve social and economic considerations and 
uncertainties similar to those in GHG emissions scenarios. 
Population projections are among the most commonly cited 
indicators of the future state of the world. Compared to the 
multitude of projection efforts they have a relatively high 
accuracy in the near-to-medium term. Even so the future is 
always unknowable and surprises are in store, as confirmed by 
a cursory review of the past history of population projections in 
which fundamental events were largely unforeseen (post-
World War II baby boom, acquired immunodeficiency 
syndrome (AIDS) or the recent rapidity of fertility decline in 
developing countries)). 
To be useful for the development of emissions scenarios, 
population projections need a timeframe of a century or more. 
global coverage and regional disaggregations, and an 
appropriate treatment of uncertainty reflected in the variants of 
the projections. Although other "demographic units" more 
immediately linked to GHG emissions than people, such as 
automobiles or households, can be considered, the integrated 
assessment models used in this report are all based on regional 
population and, in some cases, labor-force projections. 
3 . 2 . 2 . 
Past Population 
Trends 
World annual population growth rates probably averaged less 
than 0.6% during the 18* and 19"^ centuries, passed the 1% rate 
around 1920, and peaked at 2.04% in the late 1960s (UN, 
1998). This peak coincided with growing international concern 
about population growth in general. World population reached 
1 billion in 1804, 2 billion in 1927, 3 billion in I960, 4 billion 
in 1974, and 5 billion in 1987, reaching the 6 bilhon level 
shortly before the millenium (UN, 1998). 
The population of the developing regions increased from 1.71 
bilUon in 1950 to 4.59 billion in 1996, with annual growth rates 
dropping from a peak of 2.5% in 1965 to 1.7% presently. The 
population of the more-developed regions increased from 813 
million to 1.18 billion over the same period, with annual 
growth rates dropping from 1.2% in 1950 to 0.4% presenfly 
(UN, 
1998). Population distribution and growth thus differ 
markedly among major geographic regions. Latin America and 
the Caribbean was the fastest growing region between 1950 
and 1970, followed by Africa, and this is projected to remain 
the case until 2050 (UN, 1998). Table 3-1 shows the population 
levels of the major geographic areas between 1800 and the 
present.

Since the IPCC was first convened in 1988, its Working Group 
III has generated two distinct series of emissions scenarios; the 
1990 Scientific Assessment (SA90) series of four scenarios 
(Houghton et a l . , 1990), and the IS92 series of six scenarios 
(Houghton et a l . , 1992, 1995; Pepper et a i , 1992). The four

SA90 scenarios all used the same median population projection 
- the World Bank 1987 projection (Zachariah and Vu, 1988). 
The IS92a-f series made use of three different projection 
variants, the World Bank (World Bank, 1991) 1991 projection 
and the United Nations (UN, 1992) 1992 medium-high and 
medium-low projections. 
Wexler (1996) surveyed the world population projections used 
in GHG emissions scenarios since 1990. Of the models 
surveyed, all but one employed the World Bank central 
projections. The sole exception - the DICE model of 
Nordhaus (1993; Nordhaus and Yohe, 1983) - 
used 
algorithmic projections 
based 
on assumed declining 
population growth rates. As noted in Chapter 2, many long-
term emission scenarios available in the literature do not even 
report their underlying population projections. In general. 
World Bank projections have been more heavily employed 
than the U N projections, apparently because of the shorter 
time horizon and longer cycle time of the U N Long Range 
projections. U N Revisions until 1994 extended only to 2025 
(now to 2050), which is too short for emissions scenarios. The 
U N Long Range series is revised less frequently, with a six-
year interval between the previous two U N Long Range 
projections. The World Bank, in contrast, updates its published 
projection every two years, and it has always been a long-
range projection, out to year 2150. In addition, the World Bank 
maintains a country-level disaggregation throughout its 
projection, unlike the U N Long Range series, which switches 
to a nine-region summary. 
In 1994, however, the World Bank discontinued the publication 
of population projections, even if these continue to be 
generated for internal uses. In contrast to the past dominance of 
World Bank projections, the SRES scenario series instead 
employs published projections from the International Institute 
for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) along with the UN's 
Medium Long Range projection.

World population projections are currently generated by the 
following institutions: 
• 
United States Census Bureau (USCB); 
• 
World Bank; 
• 
UN; and 
• 
IIASA. 
The main defining characteristics of the individual projections 
and a detailed description of each projection is given in Gaffin 
(1998). 
Figure 3-2 displays these latest world population numbers from 
all 
four demographic organizations. Two of the four 
projections, from the World Bank and USCB, contain only one 
central estimate and are unpublished. Tliese are generated 
currently for internal organizational purposes and are not 
further considered here. 
The only population projections that cun^ently )псофога1е 
variation of the long-range fertility rates are those produced by 
UN and IIASA (Gaffin, 1998). For the U N , these variants 
result in four additional projections to the U N medium 
projection and are referred to as "low," "medium low," 
"medium high" and "high." The designations reflect the 
average world fertility rate relative to the medium projection. 
For IIASA, the primary variants also refer to world average 
fertility (and mortality) rate relative to the medium projection 
and are referred to in Figure 3-2 as "high" and "low." 
The central projections in Figure 3-3 show excellent agreement 
over the next 100 years, with the exception of the "overshoot" 
in the IIASA projection, discussed below. Although significant, 
such an agreement does not imply certainty or accuracy. 
Rather, it reflects the use of similar methodologies and

databases, the dominance of population momentum associated 
with a young population age structure, and the assumption of 
replacement-level fertility in the long term. 
Figure 3-4 shows the breakdown of population growth 
projections in industrial countries (IND) and developing 
countries (DEV) as defined by the UN. The key conclusion to 
draw from Figure 3-4 is the dominance of the DEV population 
on future world population growth. 
The most important variable to detennine future population 
levels is fertility. To a lesser extent, future population also 
depends on mortality and migration rates. Figure 3-5 shows the 
world-average total fertility rate (TFR), the average number of 
births per woman, assumed for the various projections. 
Overall, a fairly broad range of assumptions about future world 
average fertility is encompassed by the projections. Future 
population size is very sensitive (see Figure 3-2) to 
comparatively small changes in the long-range fertility rate. 
For example, within the U N projections, a decrease of the 
asymptotic fertility rate of less than half-a-birth per woman 
(from 2.1 to 1.7) decreases population in 2100 by 46% (UN, 
1998). Only the replacement-level fertility of about 2.1 results 
in a stable population in the long run. 
Such sensitivity to small asymptotic fertility-rate changes 
indicates the high and low projections from UN and IIASA are 
all feasible scenarios of the future population (Gaffin and 
O'Neill, 1998). 
Up to 2050, the IIASA central TFR is high compared with the 
UN and World Bank central projection. Later the IIASA central 
TFR 
dechnes to below replacement-level feitility rate, as 
depicted in Figure 3-5. As a result, the IIASA central forecast 
lies considerably above ail the others throughout the 21'*' 
century. After that, IIASA's below-replacement, long-term

Figure 3-5: Projected world average TFRs from the UN, IIASA, and World Bank. The older 1994 World Bank projections are 
shown, because the latest (1996) projection methodology is not published. USCB fertility rates are not readily available and so 
are omitted. U N fertility assumptions are shown only for the 1996 Revision as full detail of the 1998 data were unavailable at 
the time of drafting this report. 
fertility assumption causes the projection to decline and to 
"hit" the World Bank and UN curves in 2100. This "overshoot" 
occurs because the IIASA central scenario assumptions rely on 
an expert poll conducted in 1993 (Lutz, 1994), whereas other 
projections incorporate more recent information into their 
future assumptions (more rapid recent fertility declines in 
many developing countries; see Courbage, 1998). However, 
among demographers disagreement persists on the timing and 
rates of demographic transition in the developing countries, in 
particular- between the demographers at IIASA and those at the 
U N and World Bank (see the discussion in Lutz, 1994) on the 
differences among altemative population projections). This 
disagreement reflects important uncertainties in the projection 
of future demographic developments. The beiow-replacement, 
long-term fertility level in the IIASA central estimate is a 
hallmark of the institute's work. Demographers at IIASA 
strongly adhere to the view that there is little reason to expect 
developed nations to return to replacement-level fertility, while 
much evidence suggests that low long-term rates will persist 
(Lutz et a i , 1996). One issue here, however, is that the TFR 
measure is currently depressed in Europe, in part because 
women are delaying their childbearing until later ages 
(Bongaarts, 1998). Thus, the TFR may rise if these women do 
have children, and such a conection has to be incoфol•ated into 
the long-term TFR assumptions (e.g., see Courbage, 1998). 
Important uncertainties are by how fast and how much the TFR 
will rise.

The U N 1996 Revision generated substantial press attention in 
1997 because it forecast nearly 500 million fewer people in 
2050 than it had in 1994. The base year of data for the U N 1996 
Revision is 1995, whereas in the 1994 Revision fertility. 
mortality, and migration rates for 1995 are forecast. The 
reduction in the population projection largely results from 
more accurate data available for 1995 (UN, 1997b, 1997c). The 
major change was the lower-than-anticipated world average 
fertility of 2.96 children per woman during the period 
1990-1995, as compared with 3.10 children per woman 
assumed in the 1994 Revision. The main reason for this 
decrease is a faster-than-anticipated decline in fertility in a 
number of couniries in south central Asia, Bangladesh and 
India, and Sub-Saharan Africa, Kenya, and Rwanda (UN, 
1997c). Other important regional declines in fertility also took 
place in Brazil, the former Soviet republics, and the newly 
independent states in eastern and southern Europe (Haub, 
1997). Higher-than-anticipated mortality rates in a number of 
countries afflicted by wars and the spread of AIDS also 
contributed to the downward population revision.

Both the U N and the Wofld Health Organization (WHO) 
conduct ongoing surveys of the global HIV (human 
immunodeficiency virus) and AIDS epidemic. The most recent 
surveys indicate that at the beginning of 1998 30.6 million 
people were infected with HIV, the vhus that causes AIDS, and 
11.7 million people have already lost their lives to the disease 
(UNAIDS and WHO, 1998). 
Since the impact of HIV and AIDS on mortality rates is 
greatest in the sub-Saharan region, the impact of the epidemic 
on population growth will be greatest there. One study 
(Bongaarts, 1996) suggests that by 2005 the annual population 
growth rates (expressed as "persons increase per thousand 
population") in sub-Saharan Africa will be about 1.4 persons 
per thousand lower than would have occurred in the absence of 
the disease. Other regions, however, will experience a much 
smaller impact in population growth so that the AIDS-related 
S c e n a r i o D r i v i n g F o r c e s 
1 1 1 
deficit in world population growth rate will be only -0.4 
persons per thousand in 2005. The reason for the modest 
impact is that birth rates in many developing countries are 
much higher than the death rates, so the AIDS increase in 
mortality only partially offsets this larger difference.

In the recently published IIASA population projections (Lutz, 
1996), the correlations of fertility and mortality rates are also 
different to those of the U N projections. Within IIASA the 
main scenarios are labeled "central," "rapid transition," "slow 
transition," "high," and "low." In the two "transition" scenarios, 
mortality rates and fertility rates are correlated so that low or 
high mortality accompanies low or high fertility, respectively, 
in line with conventional wisdom among demographers that 
fertility declines are associated with mortality declines. This 
correlation narrows the range of projected population size as 
compared with an anticorrelation assumption. The "high" and 
"low" scenarios, by contrast, anticorrelate mortality and 
fertility and are considered quite unlikely.

Another recent development in demographic projections is that 
of probabilistic scenarios. Lutz et a l . (1997) consider, based on 
their probabilistic population projections, a doubling of world 
population unlikely. Their scenarios use fertility, mortality, and 
migration rate assumptions based on a Gaussian fit to a survey 
of demographic experts who were asked to give a range of rates 
for each region that they considered to cover the 90* percentile 
probability range. Given the Gaussian cui-ve fits to the expert 
data, a Monte Carlo simulation was run to generate 4000 
scenarios, with five-year timesteps, which have a probability 
distribution attached to them. The branch points in the fertility, 
mortality, and net migration rate curves, based on the expert 
data, were set in 1995, 2000,2030, and 2080. The probabilistic 
projections extend to 2100. The 5* and 95* percentile intervals 
are between 6.7 to 15.6 billion people by 2100, a range that 
usefully covers current knowledge on the uncertainty of future 
world population levels to be considered in SRES. It should be 
noted that such probability assignments derived from expert 
opinion are inherently subjective and do not necessarily 
suggest a corresponding likelihood of future оссштепсе.

Population aging has widely discussed implications for social 
planning, health care, labor force structural changes, and 
entitlement programs. As shown in Figure 3-6, percentage 
growth in the elderly age cohorts is predicted strongly by all 
projections. The figure shows the percentage of elderly age 
cohorts using the medium projection data. Importantiy, it will 
be a continuous process over the entire 2P' century, even 
though total population size is forecast in these cases to 
stabilize during the latter half of the century. 
The detailed economic effects of such a profound and rapid 
change in social structure are not well understood (Eberstadt, 
1997). The problem is considered below in the discussion of 
the impact of population dynamics on economic development. 
In short, conventional wisdom takes a more or less neutral view 
of the effect of population growth, including the impacts of 
aging, on the rate of economic growth (Hammer, 1985; Kelley, 
1988; National Research Council, 1986). Lowered population 
growth rates (and concomitant aging) might have a beneficial 
effect on the economy through reduced youth dependency 
ratios, which result in higher savings rates (Higgins and 
Williamson, 1997). Also, population aging could reduce labor 
supply and thus reduce potential economic growth. Against this 
argument, labor scarcity induces higher wages that in tum are 
a powerful incentive to increase labor productivity. Increasing

productivity (per capita economic output) would balance 
shortfalls from possible reductions in the labor force (Disney, 
1996) . However, lowered fertility and mortality rates will also 
cause the elderly dependency ratio to increase, which might 
lead to a trend of lower savings, characteristic of elderly 
cohorts, which have a reduced incentive to save. In terms of 
public savings, without institutional reforms aging could 
eventually lead to severe strains on social security and health 
care programs supported by governments and thus to reduced 
goventmental savings (US Council of Economic Advisors, 
1997) . 
Interestingly, a case has been made that aging may have 
significant impacts on future CO2 emissions. The suggested 
mechanism for this relates to household formation rate 
(MacKellar et a l . , 1995). An aging population has a greater 
proportion of people in older age groups. Assuming age-
specific household foimation rates remain constant over time, 
as more people enter the older age cohorts the overall 
household formation rates will increase. This increase will be 
accompanied by a decline in the number of people per 
household (a process already observed in industrialized 
countries) and is related to reduced fertility rates. As small 
households consume significantly more energy per person than 
large households (Ironmonger et a l . , 1995), the various effects 
suggest COj emissions will increase with increased aging 
(MacKellar et a l . , 1995). Important uncertainties of this effect 
remain, not least because household formation rates of aging 
populations are not well understood.

Urbanization is also a strongly anticipated demographic trend. 
Since 1970, most urban growth has taken place in developing 
countries. It is caused by both intemal increases of the existing 
urban population and rural-to-urban migration (UN, 1997b). 
Urbanization, though, is not a rigorously modeled phenomenon 
within the projections. Essentially, future urban and rural 
growth and decline rates are simply assumed and applied to the 
projected population levels. Thus, the projections contain no 
explicit feedback mechanism from urbanization to population 
growth, even though urbanization is an important factor in 
fertility rate changes (urban populations generally have lower 
fertility rates than rural populations). Instead, urbanization 
rates are considered implicitiy within the projections of future 
fertility. It is estimated that by 2010 more than half of the 
world's population will live in urban areas (UN, 1996). 
Urbanization will lead to a rapid expansion of infrastructure 
and especially transportation uses (Wexler, 1996). In addition, 
urban households in developing countries use significantiy 
more fossil fuels, as opposed to biofuels, than do rural 
households. However, the choice of fuel is predominantly an 
income effect rather than a function of locale (see Murthy et 
a i , 1997), even within urban settings. Hence, urbanization 
exerts its influence on emissions primarily via higher urban 
incomes compared to rural ones. Generally, opportunities for 
higher income are considered an important driver of rural-to-
urban migration, and so contribute to rising urbanization rates 
(HABITAT, 1996). Urbanization is obviously an important 
factor for future GHG emissions. 
3.2.5. 
Relationships 
3 . 2 . 5 . 1 . I n t r o d u c t i o n 
Within the caveats in Section 3.1, a number of demographic 
studies show that population change does exert a strong first-
order scaling effect on CO^ emissions models (O'Neill, 1996; 
Gaffin and O'Neill, 1997; O'Neill et a l . , 2000; Wexler, 1996). 
These studies support the notion that population growth and 
the policies that affect it are key factors for future emissions. 
Balanced against this, however, are other studies that take a 
more skeptical view (Kolsrud and Torrey, 1992; Birdsall, 1994; 
Preston, 1996). A full review of model results that address this 
question is given in O'Neill (1996) and Gaffin and O'Neill 
(1997) and is not be reproduced here because of space 
limitations (for a review see Gaffin, 1998). In essence, the 
controversy is one of the relationships between population 
growth and economic development, as well as other salient 
factors that influence emissions. These relationships were first 
discussed within the context of IPCC emissions scenarios by 
Alcamo et a l . (1995) and are discussed in more detail in the 
following sections.

of E c o n o m i c G r o w t h o n P o p u l a t i o n 
G r o w t h 
Figure 3-7 shows the long-established negative coirelation 
between fertility rates and per capita income. Clearly, richer 
countries uniformly have a relatively low fertility rate. Poorer 
countries, o n a v e r a g e , have a higher fertility rate. Lower 
fertility, however, does exist in some poor countries or regions, 
which illustrates the importance of social and institutional 
structures. 
Barro (1997) reports a statistically significant cortelation 
between per capita GDP growth and the variables life 
expectancy and fertility in his analysis of post-1960 growth 
performance of 100 countries. Other things being equal, 
growth rates correlate positively (higher) with increasing life 
expectancy and negatively (lower) widi high fertility, which 
confiims the view that the affluent live longer and have fewer 
children. 
Figure 3-7, a snapshot of many counûies passing through the 
"demographic fertility transition" can be explained from both 
economic and socio-demographic points of view (Easterlin, 
1978). Economically, Figure 3-7 can be interpreted as a 
reflection of the s u b s t i t u t i o n that families make - away from 
having children and toward consuming more goods and 
services. With greater wealth, both goods and services become 
increasingly available as part of the families' "basket of 
choices" for consumption and, accordingly, they shift away

dollars at 1995 prices for most of the world's countries. Data

from higher fertility to lower fertility. This move is further 
prompted by the rising relative costs of childcare, which 
include preferences that increase a child's quality of life, such 
as better schooling and extracurricular activities. 
This income effect is primarily interpreted with respect to 
fertility changes in currently developing countries. In currently 
industrial countries, any change of fertility in response to 
increasing wealth is likely to be different from and probably 
even opposite to that of developing countries' feitility. Indeed, 
there is evidence of this in Eastem Europe, Sweden, Russia, and 
(recently) the United States (UN, 1997a), and it is linked to the 
question of long-term fertility rates in industrial countries (see 
Section 3.2.3.2.). However, it is evident that future world 
population levels will be dominated by growth in developing 
countries. Thus, if it is accepted that fertility is lower with 
greater affluence, then in emissions scenarios lower populations 
will still tend to cortelate with higher per capita incomes. 
Another countervailing factor is that mortality rates should also 
decline with wealth; as an isolated effect, this obviously results 
in higher population levels. However, the combined impact of 
both fertility and mortality reduction on population size is a net 
reduction in population levels (Lutz, 1996). 
From a demographic point of view, the primary effect seen in 
Figure 3-7 is interpreted as infant and child mortality decline 
with increasing affluence. Families, in a sense, have to use 
birth control to achieve their desired number, which has always 
been lower than fertility rates. Increased affluence results in 
increased knowledge of, access to, and use of birth control, and 
accordingly families shift their reproductive behavior to lower 
fertility rates. Accompanying this basic premise is a host of 
complex social changes, including increased opportunities for 
education, employment, and non-maternal roles for women. 
Incorporation of the inverse relationship between economic 
and population growth in long-term emission scenarios is 
recent and mostly carried out in a qualitative way. Alcamo et 
a l . (1995) reviews the literature available up to 1994. 
Nakicenovic et a l . (1998a) report a long-term scenario study in 
which timing and extent of economic catch-up in developing 
countries were found to be tied to timing and pace of their 
demographic transition. Pattems of the range of per capita 
GDP growth rates for developing countries available in the 
literature (and given in Figure 3-10) also appear to reflect this 
relationship. Growth trends for the period 2020-2050 are 
generally higher than those for earlier or later periods; it is in 
this period that, according to demographic projections, the 
fastest change in demographic variables (especially fertility) 
will take place. 
3 . 2 . 6 . 
Conclusions 
From the available population projections, only those from the 
UN and IIASA fulfill the characteristics needed for use in 
long-term emission scenarios. First, the U N and IIASA data 
are published and available in the public domain, and second 
(more importantly) the scenarios consider uncertainty by 
developing more than just one, central demographic 
projection. 
We use the medium U N projections in the SRES emissions 
scenarios because they have greater recognition internationally, 
and garner considerable attention as evident from the press 
focus devoted to the 1996 Revision (mentioned above). In 
addition, the U N assumption of replacement-level fertility in 
the long term, in contrast to the IIASA below-replacement 
assumption, is an important normative approach widely used 
heretofore in projections. 
The rapid and slow demographic transition variants from 
IIASA projections remain attractive as the "high" and "low" 
population variants to be considered for the new IPCC 
emissions scenarios. The incorporation of a correlation 
between mortality rates and fertility (Lutz, 1996) is a logical 
first-order relationship not used in previous population variants 
and, in particular, not a feature of the U N variants. The two 
IIASA variants also represent well the uncertainty range as 
spanned by the probabilistic projections of Lutz et a l . (1997), 
which represent an important methodological advance in the 
field. As shown in Figure 3-2, the resultant IIASA population 
range falls within the range of the U N projections. 
Based on the above recommendations, Figure 3-8 compares the 
older IS92 population range with the population range 
described in this section. The population projections in IS92 
scenarios 
comprise the U N 1992 medium-high and 
medium-low variants for the high and low ranges with the 
World Bank 1991 projection as the central case. As seen in 
Figure 3-8, the new range for SRES is somewhat narrower and 
lower than the IS92 range. The cause is partly the positive 
correlation between mortality rates and fertility rates within the 
IIASA variants, which mildly offset each other in terms of 
future population size. Another reason is the recent downward

revision of the UN medium projection compared to earlier UN 
scenarios (as outlined above). 
The literature suggests a general inverse correlation between 
economic growth rates and population growth rates. Higher 
economic growth rates in developing countries should correlate 
with lower population growth rates in long-term scenarios and 
vice versa, because of the importance of economic 
development in bringing about the demographic fertility 
transition. This represents a distinctive change from the IS92 
trajectories. Importantly, there is still no quantitative basis for 
associating any p a r t i c u l a r economic growth curve with a 
particular population curve; this is a qualitative negative 
correlation only. Even more important is that income is not 
necessarily the best predictor of future fertility rates and many 
countries are currently moving through the demographic 
transition without a clear economic cause. Alternatively, some 
countries have failed to begin a fertility decline even though 
economic and social conditions have improved (e.g., Sathar 
and Casteriine, 1998). 
The inclusion of a household demographic unit, in addition to 
population, should be encouraged in future studies. The effect 
is linked to a strongly predicted demographic trend - aging. 
Also important are that smaller households are more energy 
intensive, per person, and that aging may continue to increase 
more rapidly than population in the future. These factors may 
increase COj emissions (MacKellar et a l . , 1995), although 
senior citizens group-living is a tendency in some 
industrialized countries. Urbanization might also have a strong 
effect on emissions because of its effect on income distribution 
and thus energy consumption pattems around the world, 
although many of these effects are included implicitly in the 
models and parameters used in this report. 
3.3. 
Economic and Social Development 
3 3 . 1 . 
I n t r o d u c t i o n 
Economic and social development comprises many dimensions 
and a number of indicators have been devised to assess 
progress and setbacks in human development (see Box 3-1). 
The 
U N defines development as the furthering of human 
choices. Such choices are neither finite nor static. Yet, 
regardless of the level of development, the three essential 
choices are to have access to the resources needed for a decent 
standard of living, to lead a long and healthy life, and to 
acquire knowledge (UNDP, 1997). Other valued choices range 
from political, economic, and social freedom to opportunities 
for being creative and productive, and to enjoy human rights 
(UNDP 1997). 
Arguably, choices are only possible once basic human needs 
for food, shelter, health care, safety, and education have been 
met. Poverty is therefore an important indicator of the absence 
of satisfactory economic development. Alleviation of poverty 
is an essential prerequisite for human development. Beyond the 
satisfaction of basic needs, the issue of what constitutes 
"development" involves many cultural, social, and economic 
dimensions that cannot be resolved by scientific methods, but 
are inherently a question of values, preferences, and policies.

Box 3-1: On Measures of Human and Economic Development 
Writing 220 years ago in The W e a l t h of N a t i o n s , Adam Smith noted that: "whatever the soil, climate, or extent of territory of 
any particular nation, the abundance or scantmess of its annual output fundamentally depends on its human resources - the skill, 
dexterity, and judgement of its labour" (Smith, 1970). Although economists recognized the importance of land, labor, and 
capital m explaining economic growth and national wealth, in the post-World War II period national well-being has usually been 
measured by GDP or gross national product (GNP). GDP is defined as the monetary equivalent of all products and services 
generated in a given economy in a given year. GNP equals GDP plus the net balance of mtemational payments to and from that 
economy. Few questions were asked about the underlying resource base for GDP growth and whether or not it was sustainable. 
Further, since GDP does not reflect all economic transactions it does not provide a full measure of human well-being. 
Nevertheless, GDP is very widely used because it is universally accepted as the monetary indicator of all products and services 
generated in a given economy within a given year. 
Environmental and Social Modiñcations to GDP 
More recently, several new approaches have been developed to address the inherent shortcomings of GDP measures. These 
include "green" national accounts that incorporate the role of the stocks and flows of renewable and non-renewable resources, 
and the related concept of genuine savings (UN, 1993). "Green" GDP is the informal name given to national income measures 
that are adjusted for the depletion of natural resources and degradation of the environment. The types of adjustment made to 
standard GDP include a measure of the user costs of exploiting natural resources and a value for the social costs of pollution 
emissions. In terms of measuring the sustainability of development, the green accounting aggregate with the most policy 
relevance is "genume savmg." This represents the value of the net change in assets that are important for development -
produced assets, natural resources, environmental quality, foreign assets, and human resources, which include rehjms to 
education and raw labor and the strength and scope of social mstituiions. Human resources Ш т out, not unexpectedly, to be the 
dominant form of wealth in the majority of countries (World Bank, 1997a). 
Purchasing Power Parities 
A further problem arises in intemational comparisons, in which economic indicators are converted from local currencies into a 
common currency, such as dollars. Traditionally, market exchange rates are used to make these conversions. In theory, exchange rates 
adjust so that the local currency prices of a group of identical goods and services represent equivalent value in every nation. In 
practice, such adjustments can lag far behind changing economic chcumstances. Policies, such as currency controls, may further 
distort the accuracy of market-based rates. Moreover, many goods and services are not traded internationally so market-based 
exchange rates may not reflect the relative values of such goods and services, even in theory. An alternative approach is based on 
estimates of the purchasing power of different currencies. The Intemational Comparison Project compared prices for several hundred 
goods and services in a large number of countries. On the basis of this comparison, the relative values of local currencies are adjusted 
to reflect PPP (see UNDP, 1993). In effect, the PPP currency values reflect the number of units of a country's currency required to 
buy the same quantity of comparable goods and services in the local market as one US dollar would buy in an "average" country. 
The average coimtry is based on a composite of all participating countries. In 1996 the World Bank initiated the ranking of countries 
by GDP converted at PPP rates; the effect was to reduce the income spread between the poorest and richest countries (WRI, 
1997a). 
UN Human Development Index 
The UN has tried to address the shortcomings of GDP by developing The H u m a n D e v e l o p m e n t I n d e x (UNDP, 1997). This index, 
produced since 1990, combines three factors to measure overall development: 
• 
Income as measured by real GDP per capita at PPP to represent command over resources to enjoy a decent standard of 
living. 
• 
Longevity as measured by life expectancy at birth. 
• 
Educational attainment as measured by adult literacy and school emolment. 
The U N has also developed other measures, such as the Gender-related Development Index (GDI) and the Gender 
Empowerment Measure (GEM) 
to assess conditions such as gender equality. 
The difficulty of incorporating these altemative measures into long-temi scenarios is that, with the exception of life expectancy, 
underlymg data or base projections (e.g. on future PPPs, levels of educational attainment, etc.) needed to develop these altemative 
indicators for future projections are not available. Therefore, this report largely focuses on traditional measures of economic 
development like GDP. Projections of PPPs are calculated by one of the six SRES models and are presented in Chapter 4.

S c e n a r i o D r i v i n g F o r c e s 
Given the inherent 
ambiguities of such a complex, 
multidimensional issue, it is easiest to define and develop 
indicators of no development. Estimates indicate, for instance, 
that 1.3 billion people in developing countries live on incomes 
of less than US$1 (PPP based) per day, a level used to define 
the absolute poverty cut-off in intemational compaiisons 
(UNDP, 1997). An equal number of people are estimated to 
have no access to safe drinking water (UNDP, 1997) and 2 
billion people are estimated to have no access to services 
provided by the use of modern energy forms (WEC, 
1993). 
Income is not an end in itself, but a way to enable human 
choices, or to foreclose them in the case of poverty. Therefore, 
levels of per capita income (GDP or GNP) 
have been widely 
used as a measure of the degree of economic development, as 
in many instances such levels correlate closely (as lead or lag 
indicator) with other indicators and dimensions of social 
development, such as mortality, nutiition, and access to basic 
services, etc. Average income values also do not indicate the 
distribution of income, which is an important quantity. 
Composite measures, such as the U N Human Development 
Index, are also used in historical analyses (see Box 3-1). Note, 
however, that the overall nature of scenario results may not 
vary much even if some other measure could be used, because 
often-used components, such as literacy rates, are generally 
correlated with income levels. 
In fact, per capita income is t h e (and often only) development 
indicator used in the literature for long-term energy and 
GHG 
emissions scenarios. This explains why this review chapter, 
while recognizing the importance of altemative dimensions 
and indicators to describe long-term human development, 
almost exclusively embraces an economic perspective. 
The widespread use of GDP or GNP per capita (however 
measured) should not distract from the fact that, while a 
powerful indicator, it does not describe all aspects of economic 
development (see Box 3-1). GDP and GNP are indicators of 
financial 
flows (see Box 3-1), and are not designed to measure 
stock variables such as the size of the capital stock in an 
economy. GDP and GNP relate only to goods and services that 
are subject to market transactions, t h a t is only those activities 
that are part of the formal economy. Subsistence and other 
"gray" economic activities and socially important obligatory 
activities, such as childcare or household work, are not 
included; also, depletion allowances for natural capital and 
resources are not considered. 
Although PPP comparison (see Box 3-1) is considered a valid 
indicator of relative wealth, it is sometimes quite uncertain and 
dependent on detailed comparison exercises. As a result, even 
if studies and scenarios consistently use the same indicator of 
economic development, numeric values are often not directiy 
comparable because of large differences in base-year values. 
Comparison of growth rates are more robust, but even here 
many difficulties exist (see, e.g., Alcamo et a l . , 1995, and 
Chapter 2). 
3 . 3 , 2 . 
H i s t o r i c a l 
Trends 
Rostow (1990) described several stages in the economic 
development process: 
• 
First, the pre-industrial economy, in which most 
resources must be devoted to agriculture because of the 
low level of productivity. 
• 
Second, the phase of capacity-building that leads to an 
economic acceleration. 
• 
Third, the acceleration itself, which requires about two 
decades. 
• 
Fourth, about six decades of industrialization and 
catch-up to the "productivity frontiers" prevailing in the 
industrialized countries. 
• 
Fifth, the period of mass-consumerism and the welfare 
state. 
It is important not to conceptuaUze economic development as 
a quasi-autonomous, linear development path. Numerous 
socio-institutional preconditions have to be met before any 
"take off' into accelerated rates of productivity and economic 
growth can materialize (see Section 3.3.4). "Leading sectors" 
(Fogel, 1970) that drive productivity and output growth change 
over time (Freeman and Perez, 1988; Freeman, 1990), and 
different "industrialization paths" (Chenery et a l . , 1986) have 
been identified in historical analyses. Still, historical evidence, 
consistent with neoclassic growth theory, allows a number of 
generalizations as to the pattems of advances in productivity 
and economic growth. 
By and large, growth rates aie lower for economies at the 
technology and productivity frontier, compared to those 
approaching it. For instance, in the 19* century productivity 
and per capita GDP growth in the rapidly industrializing US far 
exceeded those of England, then at the technology and 
productivity frontier. Likewise, in the post-World War II period 
growth rales in Japan and most of Western Europe exceeded 
those of the US (by then at the technology and productivity 
frontier) (Maddison, 1991, 1995). High human capital 
(education), a favorable institutional environment, free trade, 
and access to technology are acknowledged as key factors for 
rapid economic catch-up (see Section 3.3.4). Likewise, 
entrenchment in progressively outdated capital and technology 
vintages acts as a retarding force against growth (Frankel, 
1955), and rapid capital turnover and possibilities to "leapfrog" 
(Goldemberg, 1991) outdated technologies and infrastructures 
provide the potential for faster economic catch-up. 
Perhaps the most comprehensive compilation of data on 
historical economic development is that of Maddison (1995). 
Table 3-2 shows Maddison's per capita GDP growth rate 
estimates for selected regions and time periods. Since 1820 
global GDP has increased by a factor of 40, or at a rate of about 
2.2% per year. Per capita GDP growth was 1.2% per year faster 
than population growth. In the past 110 years (a time frame 
comparable to that addressed in this report) global GDP 
increased by a factor of 20, or at a rate of 2.7% per year, and

global per capita GDP grew by a factor of more than five, or at 
a rate of 1.5% per year. There is substantial variation in the 
rates of economic growth over time and across countries. Even 
for the present OECD countries modern economic growth 
dates only from approximately 1870 onward, and for 
developing economies comparable conditions for economic 
growth and catch-up in productivity levels existed only in the 
second half of the 20* century. These approximate dates also 
set the time frame for drawing useful comparisons between 
historical experiences and future projections (see Section 
3.3.3). 
Historically, economic growth has been concentrated in 
Europe, the Americas, and Australasia. Sustained high-
productivity growth (per capita GDP growth) resulted in the 
current high levels of per capita income in the OECD 
countries. Latecomers (such as Austria, Japan, Scandinavia) 
rapidly caught up to the productivity frontier of the other 
OECD economies (most notably that of the US) in the post-
World War П period. Per capita GDP growth rates of 3.5% per 
annum were, for instance, achieved in Westem Europe between 
1950 and 1980. Similarly, high per capita GDP growth rates 
were achieved in the developing economies of Asia. Per capita 
GDP 
growth rates of individual countries have even been 
higher - 8% per annum in Japan over the period 1950-1973, 
7% in Korea between 1965 and 1992, and 6.5% per year in 
China since 1980 (Maddison, 1995). Progress in increasing per 
capita income levels has been significant in many regions and 
countries over the long term, although income gaps in both 
absolute and relative terms have not been reduced in the 
aggregate. For instance, per capita GDP in Africa is estimated 
to have been about 20% of the level of the most affluent OECD 
region in 1870; by 1990 this ratio had decreased to 6% 
(Maddison, 1995). 
Other key indicators of human development have also 
improved strongly in recent decades. For instance, since 1960 
(in little more than a generation) infant mortality rates in 
developing countries have more than halved, malnutrition rates 
have declined by one-third, primary school attendance rates 
have increased from about half to three-quarters, and the share 
of rural families with access to safe drinking water has 
increased from 25% to 65% for low-income families and to 
more than 95% for high-income families (UNDP, 1997; World 
Bank, 1999). 
Equally noticeable in Table 3-2 is the slowdown of per capita 
GDP growth in the OECD countries since the end of the 1970s 
and the serious setbacks in Eastern Europe and developing 
countries outside Asia over the same time period. After a 
decade of decline in economic output, a trend reversal to 
positive growth rates is expected to occur only after the year 
2000 (World Bank. 1998b). Even optimistic scenarios indicate 
that the pre-crises (1989) levels of per capita income cannot be 
achieved again until 2010 (Nakicenovic et a l . , 1998a). 
The effects of the recent Asian financial crises are estimated to 
reduce significantly short-term economic growth in the region, 
but longer-term growth prospects remain solid. After a sluggish 
growth to the year 2000, economic growth in the developing 
countries of Asia is anticipated to resume at 6.6% per year for 
the period 2001-2007 (World Bank, 1998b). 
The past two centuries have seen major structural shifts, with 
inter-related changes in demography, economic structure, and 
technology. The world's largest economies have seen a 
continuous shift in economic structure, from agricultural 
production to industry and, to a greater extent, services (see 
Figure 3-9). During the past half-century, the industry share 
declined to leave these economies dominated by service 
sectors. A similar pattern has occurred in most other economies 
in Europe, North America, and Australasia. Another major 
feature of the past two centuries, not shown in Figure 3-9, is the 
growing role of government in the economy. The literature on 
structural change is reviewed in more detail in Jung et a l . 
(2000). 
Differences in statistical definitions make it difficult to 
compare structural change in the former centrally planned 
economies with that in mature market economies. Also, in the 
less-developed regions a marked decline in the contribution of 
agriculture to GDP has occuired in recent years, but the 
contribution of services is larger than it was historically in 
industrial countries at the same level of income. This indicates 
the dangers of using past history too literally as a guide to 
future behavior.

These economic developments 
have accompanied 
the 
processes of urbanization, increased access to education, 
improved health care, and longer life expectancies. They have 
been finked to increasing complexity in economic, legal, and 
social institutions (Tainter, 1996). The pattem seen in ths six. 
countries shown in Figure 3-9 is reproduced in most parts of 
the world. In general, increasing income per capita is 
associated with a shift in production patterns, first from 
agriculture to industry, and then more gradually away from 
industry into services. Succession processes beneath these 
macro-level changes are important. Industrial sectors and 
technologies have risen and fallen in importance over the past 
few centuries. These processes and analysts' various attempts 
to find patterns to describe them are further discussed in 
Section 3.3.4. 
3 . 3 . 3 . 
Scenarios 
of Economic 
Development 
Unlike population projections, no long-term economic-
development scenarios are available in the literature (for an 
earlier review, see Jefferson, 1983). In fact, for economic 
projections "long term" means time horizons of up to a decade 
(e.g., World Bank, 1997b), 1998b, far too short for the time 
frame addressed in this report. The longest time frames for 
economic growth projections available in the literature extend 
to 2015 (e.g., Maddison, 1998) and 2020 (World Bank, 1997b). 
The need for long-term economic growth scenarios has arisen 
primarily 
in connection 
with 
long-term 
energy 
and 
environmental impact analyses. Earlier reviews on the related 
economic growth assumptions are contained in Nordhaus and 
Yohe (1983), Keepin (1986), Grübler (1994), and Alcamo et a l . 
(1995). An expert poll on uncertainty in future GDP growtii 
projections is reported in Manne and Richels (1994). Recent 
scenario assumptions are reviewed in Chapter 2 above. 
The current state of modeling long-term economic growth is not 
well developed, not least because the dominant forces of long-
run productivity growth, such as the role of institutions and 
technological change (see Section 3.3.4), remain exogenous to 
modeis. As a resuil, productivity growth assumptions enter 
scenario calculations as exogenous input assumptions. The 
structural changes in the economy discussed in the previous 
paragraph result in additional difficulties; notably that service 
sector productivity growth is difficult to evaluate and project. 
Figure 3-10 summarizes the results of the analysis of available 
literature data on per capita economic growth, disaggregated 
into global as well as industrial and developing countries. 
Overall, uncertainty concerning productivity and hence per 
capita GDP growth is considerable. Uncertainties in 
productivity growth rates become amplified because even 
small differences in productivity growth rates in all scenarios, 
when compounded over a time frame of a century or more into 
the future, translate into enormous differences in absolute 
levels of per capita GDP. For instance, in the scenarios 
reviewed in Alcamo et a l . (1995) and Griibler ( 1994) per capita 
GDP growth rates range typically between 0.8 and 2.8% per 
year over the period 1990-2100. On the basis of an average 
global per capita income of US$4000 in 1990, global per capita 
GDP could range anywhere between about US$10,000 to about 
US$83,000 by 2100. Such uncertainties are amplified even 
more when regional disaggregations are considered, in 
particular futine productivity growth in developing countries. 
The range of views spans all the extremes between developing 
countries that lag perennially behind current income levels in 
the OECD, to scenarios in which they catch up. 
These ranges are reflected in the SRES scenarios shown in 
Figure 3-10. Exogenously assumed productivity growth rates

coiTcspond to alternative qualitative intei"pretations as to how 
the future could unfold, ranging from SRES low (all-min) to 
SRES high (all-max) rates. Extreme scenarios of productivity 
growth or lack of growth have not been explored because the 
SRES terms of reference cover a qualified range from the 
literature; methodological (and model) pluralism is mandatory 
(extreme scenarios can be reflected across a wide range of 
modeling approaches only to a limited degree). Furthermore, 
it IS not possible to treat uncertainties of future demographic, 
economic, and technological developments as independent. 
This is shown by the conclusions of recent scenario evaluation 
exercises (Alcamo et a l . , 1995) as well as by theoretical and 
empirical evidence (e.g. Abramovilz, 1993; Barro, 1997). 
Thus, contrary to the previous IPCC IS92 scenario series (that 
varied salient scenario driving forces independently of each 
other), the SRES scenarios attempt to incorporate advances in 
the understanding of the relationships between important 
scenario drivers. From this perspective, uncertainties about 
future productivity and hence economic growth are not 
parametric, but rather are related to the uncertainties in current 
understanding and modeling of the interactions between 
demographics, productivity growth, and socio-institutional 
and technological change. These are addressed in Section 
3.3.4. 
3 . 3 . 4 . 
Relationships 
3 . 3 . 4 . 1 . I n t r o d u c t i o n 
Economic growth can either be achieved by increasing the 
factor inputs to production, such as capital and labor, or by 
increasing productivity (i.e., the efficiency by which factors of 
production are used to generate economic output). Without 
productivity growth, long-run output growth cannot be 
maintained with limited or depletable resource inputs; as a 
result, complex societies become increasingly vulnerable 
(Tainter, 1988). Changes between inputs and outputs are 
usually analyzed by drawing upon the production function 
approach pioneered by Tinbergen (1942) and Solow (1957). 
Yet, empirical analyses (e.g., Denison, 1962, 1985) quickly 
identified that quality and composition of factor inputs are 
more important in explaining long-run output growth than 
merely the quantitative growth in available factor inputs. For 
instance, at first sight population growth might be considered 
as central for economic growth, because it increases the labor 
force. Upon closer examination, however, institutional and 
social factors that govern working-time regulation, female 
workforce participation, and above all the qualification of the 
workforce (education) have been more important determinants 
of long-run economic growth (Denison, 1962, 1985) than 
simple growth in the numbers of the potential workforce 
(usually calculated as the population in the age bracket 15 to 65 
years). Another puzzling finding of Solow (1957) is that, even 
1 2 0 
S c e n a r i o D r i v i n g F o r c e s 
when changes in quality and composition of factors of 
production are accounted for, increases in per capita economic 
output (productivity) remain largely unexplained, a "residual" 
in the analysis remains unclear (for a review, see Griliches, 
1996). The "residual," is usually ascribed to "advances in 
knowledge and technology" which, unlike capital and labor, 
cannot be measured directly. However, it might also be the 
result of other influences, which potentially include growing 
contributions to the economy by non-market or under-priced 
natural resources. Thus, considerable measurement 
and 
interpretative uncertainties remain in the explanation of 
productivity growth. 
New approaches and models extended the neoclassic growth 
model (e.g., Romer, 1986; Lucas, 1988; Grossmann and 
Helpman, 1991, 1993). In these, increases in human capital 
through education and the importance of technological 
innovation via directed activity (research and development 
(R&D)) complement more traditional approaches, which 
represents a return to the earlier work of Schumpeter (1943), 
Kuznets (1958), Nelson et a l . (1967), and Landes (1969). 
3 . 3 . 4 . 2 . I n f l u e n c e of 
D e m o g r a p h i c s 
Neoclassic economic growth theory embraces as a general 
principle the notion that long-term per capita income g r o w t h 
r a t e is independent of population g r o w t h r a t e . Thus, a rapidly 
growing population should not necessarily slow down a 
countries' 
economic 
development. 
Blanchet 
(1991) 
summarizes the country-level data. Prior to 1980, the 
overwhelming majority of studies showed no significant 
correlation between population growth and economic growth 
(National Research Council, 1986). Recent correlation studies, 
however, suggest a statistically significant, but weak, inverse 
relationship for the 1970s and 1980s, despite no correlation 
being established previously (Blanchet, 1991). As noted in 
Section 3.2, the reverse effect of income growth on 
demographics is much clearer. 
Population aging is another consideration advanced as having 
significant influence on economic growth rates. Reductions in 
workforce availability and excessive social security and 
pension expenditures are cited as possible drivers. Section 3.2 
above concluded that evidence for a strong negative impact is 
rather elusive. Two additional points deserve consideration. 
First, population aging is not necessarily the best indicator for 
workforce availabifity, because while the percentage of the 
elderly, in particular those of retirement age, increases, the 
proportion of younger people (of pre-work or -career age) 
decreases. As a result, the percentage of the working age 
population (age 15 to 65 years) in the total population 
changes less dramatically, even in scenarios of pronounced 
aging. For instance, in the IIASA low population scenario (7 
billion world population by 2100) discussed in Section 3.2, 
the percentage of age categories 15 to 65 years changes from 
62% in 1995 to 54% by 2100. This percentage falls to 48% in 
the regions with the highest population aging (Lutz et a l . , 
1996). 
A second point is that these demographic variables only 
indicate potential workforce numbers. Actual gainfully 
employed workforce numbers are influenced by additional 
important variables - unemployment levels, female workforce 
participation rates, and finally working time. The importance 
of these variables can be illustrated by a few statistics. 
Currently, about 40 million people are unemployed in the 
OECD countries (UNDP, 1997). The female workforce 
participation ratios vary enormously, from about 10% to 48% 
of the workforce (as in Saudi Arabia and Sweden, respectively; 
UNDP, 1997), and have been changing dramatically over time. 
For the US, for instance, female workforce participation rates 
increased from 17% in 1890 (US DOC, 
1975) to 45% in 1990 
(UNDP, 1997). Similar dramatic long-term changes have 
occurred in the number of working hours in all industrial 
countries. Compared to the mid-19* century, the number of 
average working hours has declined from about 3000 to about 
1500 (Maddison, 1995; Ausubel and Grübler, 1995). However, 
in most OECD countries the trend in working time reductions 
has slowed to a halt since the early 1980s (Marchand, 1992). 
Thus, unless the rather implausible assumption is made that 
with population aging all these other important determinants of 
labor input remain unchanged, the impacts of aging are likely 
to be compensated by corresponding changes in these variables 
(e.g. greater female workforce participation, earlier retirement, 
etc.). Finally, it must be reiterated that quahtative labor force 
characteristics, most notably education, are a more important 
determinant for long-ran productivity and hence economic 
growth than mere workforce numbers. 
3 . 3 . 4 . 3 . I n f l u e n c e of S o c i a l a n d I n s t i t u t i o n a l 
Changes 
The importance of social and institutional changes to provide 
conditions that enabled the acceleration of the Industrial 
Revolution is widely acknowledged (Rosenberg and Birdzell, 
1986, 1990). Rostow (1990) and Landes (1969) identify many 
social and cultural factors in the "preconditions for economic 
acceleration" and in the process of economic development. 
The importance of institutions and stable social environments 
is also increasingly discussed in the literature concerned with 
current economic growth (World Bank, 1991, 1998a). Barro 
(1997), and Barro and Sala-I-Martin (1995) report a 
statistically significant relationship between rule-of-law and 
democracy indices with per capita GDP growth. Law 
enforcement and legal rights are important indicators for 
human development in their own right, but enforceable legal 
contracts are equally important for markets to function. Other 
socio-institutional factors have been identified that are 
important to productivity and economic growth: education is 
mentioned above. Income inequaUty (and resultant social 
tensions) also appears to coirelate negatively with economic 
development (Worid Bank, 1998a; Maddison, 1995). 
Strong parallels run between social, institutional, and 
technological changes (Grübler, 1998a; OECD, 1998a). In 
particular, many features common to the processes of evolution 
S c e n a r i o D r i v i n g F o r c e s 
1 2 1 
in biologic organisms have been found (e.g., Teilhard de 
Chardin, 1959; Hayek, 1967; Matthews, 1984; Dawkins, 1986; 
Michaelis, 1997c). Thus, to understand these processes would 
involve: 
• 
A search for new behaviors, institutions, and social or 
cultural patterns. 
• 
Experimentation with those that are found. 
• 
Various methods of selecting the "fit" or "desirable" 
changes. 
• 
Various methods of perpetuating and diffusing those 
changes that are selected. 
Many aspects of the processes of technical change (e.g., its 
unpredictability and the importance of mechanisms such as 
path-dependence and "lock-in") also apply to social change. 
It is obviously difficult to evaluate the role of social, cultural, 
and institutional changes 
in economic and technical 
development. Whereas tiie monetary and technological aspects 
of change are often measurable and can be observed on a 
relatively "objective" basis, social, cultural, and institutional 
processes are hard to measure and often subjective. They tend 
to involve personal interactions among people, sometimes 
large numbers of people, over long periods. 
Nonetheless, these factors must be taken into account in the 
scenarios. The SRES approach to develop qualitative scenario 
"storylines" that provide an overall framework and background 
for quantitative scenario assumptions and model runs can be 
considered a particularly valuable strength. Storylines allow 
these issues to be addressed explicitly, even if current 
knowledge does not allow social, cultural, and institutional 
factors to be treated in a rigid, quantitative (not to mention 
deterministic) way.

International trade is recognized as an important source of 
economic gains, as it enables comparative advantages to be 
exploited and the diffusion of new technologies and practices. 
Equally important are domestic and intemational investments. 
From an economic perspective, trade reflects gains from 
increasing division of labor, and the historical evidence indicates 
an associated phenomenal growth. Updated (Griibler, 1998a) 
estimates from Rostow (1978) indicate an increase of more than 
a thousand-fold in intemational trade since the beginning of the 
19* century. In 1990, world trade accounted for close to US$3.4 
trillion (10'^), or 13% of world GDR Chenery et a l . (1986) and 
Barro (1997) indicate strong empirical evidence of a positive 
relationship between trade ("openness" of economies) and terms 
of trade (of the economies) on productivity, industrialization, 
and economic growth. Dosi et a l . (1990) highlight also the 
critical roles of policies and institutions in the relative success or 
failure of realizing economic gains from the intemational 
division of labor. Finally, openness to trade could have negative 
economic impacts on countries that experience a deterioration of 
terms of trade. 
Globalization is an increasingly popular term for an ill-defined 
collection of processes. The most important of these processes 
appear to be the liberalization of markets for goods, services, 
and capital, and the increasing flow of information and capital 
around the world. According to the iieoclassic model, 
globalization should benefit everyone; it helps industry in all 
countries to move closer to the productivity frontier and gives 
consumers access to a wider choice of goods and services at 
lower prices. In practice, of course, the world is more 
complicated than is assumed in the neoclassic model. 
Economists such as Dosi et a l . (1990) and Grossman and 
Helpman (1991) have experimented with altemative models, 
and shown that some countries may not benefit from free trade 
or from freely available information. Huntington (1996) 
observes that by "globalization," Americans and Europeans 
often mean "westernization" in the sense of global adoption of 
western social and cultural norms. This process of cultural 
convergence is a source of great concern in many parts of the 
world. However, Huntington suggests that economic 
globalization may be possible without cultural globalization.

C h a n g e 
The importance of "advances in knowledge" and technology in 
explaining the historical record of productivity growth is 
mentioned above. In the original study by Solow (1957) this 
was estimated to account for 87% of per capita productivity 
growth (the remainder was attributed to increases in capital 
inputs). Since then further methodological and statistical 
refinements have reduced the unexplained "residual" of 
productivity growth that is equated to advances in knowledge 
and technology, but it remains the largest single source of long-
run 
productivity and economic growth. It is estimated to 
account for more than one-third of total GDP growth in the 
USA since 1929 (Denison, 1985), and for between 34% and 
63% 
of GDP growth in the OECD countries over the period 
1947 to 1973 (Barro and Sala-I-Martin, 1995). 
The observed slowdown in productivity growth rates since the 
early 1970s is generally inteipreted as a weakening of the 
technological frontier in the OECD countries (Maddison, 
1995; 
Barro, 1997), although quantitative statistics (and even 
everyday experience) do not corroborate the perception of a 
slowdown in technological innovation and change. An 
altemative inteipretation of slower recent productivity growth 
is that the OECD countries have moved out of a long period of 
industrialization and into post-industrial development as 
service economies. In such economies, productivity is 
extremely hard to measure, partly because services comprise a 
mixture of government, non-market, and market activities, 
partly because economic accounts measure services primarily 
via inputs (e.g. cost of labor) rather than outputs, and partly 
because it is difficult to define service q u a l i t y . Nevertheless, 
labor productivity in the service sector appears to grow more 
slowly than that in the agricultural and industrial sectors 
(Millward, 1990; Baumol, 1993). The traditional concept of 
labor productivity may need revision to be applied usefully to 
the service economy. 
122 
S c e n a r i o D r i v i n g F o r c e s 
Finally, another interpretation is that productivity growth lags 
behind technological change, because appropriate institutional 
and social adjustment processes take considerable time to be 
implemented (Freeman and Perez, 1988; David, 1990). Once 
an appropriate "match" (Freeman and Perez, 1988) between 
institutional and technological chairge is achieved, productivity 
growth could accelerate. Maddison (1995) observes that the 
19* century productivity surge in the USA was preceded by a 
long period of investment in infrastructure. Landes (1969) 
notes that both the German and Japanese economic 
acceleration was preceded by a long period of investment in 
education. Maddison (1995) further suggests that recent 
developments in information technology involve considerable 
investment, both in hardware and in human leaming, which 
may result in higher efficiency improvements and productivity 
gains in the future only. This perspective is consistent with the 
possible emergence of a new "techno-economic paradigm" or 
"Kondratiev wave." This complementary theory of long-tem 
economic development focuses 
on the interplay and 
interrelationships between institutional and technological 
change. Following Kondratiev's (1926) observation of "long 
waves" in the American economy, Schumpeter (1935) 
developed a theory to explain these waves on the basis of 
discontinuities in entrepreneurial innovations. Freeman (1990) 
emphasizes Schumpeter's view that long waves are not so 
much evident in economic statistics as in qualitative features of 
the economy. Freeman and Perez (1988) describe five 
historical waves of technical and economic change and identify 
associated economic booms and recessions (successive 
"techno-economic paradigms"). 
Work at IIASA (e.g., Hafele et a l . , 1982; Grübler and 
Nakicenovic, 1991; Nakicenovic, 1996; Grübler e t a l . , 1993b; 
Grübler, 1998a) sought to identify regularities in the market 
succession of technology in energy supply, transport, and the 
iron and steel industry. In fact, there may be a close parallel 
between the waves of technology they observe and 
Kondratiev's economic long waves. However, both empirical 
and theoretical implications of "long waves" remain unclear 
(see the review in Freeman, 1996; and especially Rosenberg 
and Frischtak, 1984). Equally, no approach can hope to foresee 
reliably the form of the next "wave." It is possible that solar 
energy and nuclear power might play a strong role, perhaps 
combined with hydrogen as an energy carrier, as suggested by 
Hafele et a l . (1982) and others. The next wave in transport 
technology might well be an increasing share for aviation and 
high speed rail (Grübler and Nakicenovic, 1991), a transition to 
0.5 litre/100 km "hypercars" (Lovins et a l . , 1993), or a radical 
change in urban planning to minimize transport needs 
(Newman and Kenworthy, 1990). These possibilities highlight 
in particular the need for technology diffusion to avoid 
technological "lock-in" to older technological vintages (Parikh 
e t a l . , 1997). 
3.3.4.6. 
D o the P o o r G e t R i c h e r a n d the R i c h Slow

Neoclassic growth theory suggests that different capital and 
labor productivities across countries lead to differential 
productivity 
growth rates and hence 
to conditional 
convergence across different economies. Rostow (1990) 
coined the term that the "poor get richer and the rich slow 
down." The convergence theorem of neoclassic theory arises 
from diminishing returns on capital. Economies that tend to 
have less capital per worker tend to have higher rates of return 
and hence higher growth rates (see Abramovitz, 1986). 
Conversely, economies with high capital intensity (which, 
because of the relationship between capital intensity and 
productivity, are closer to or at the productivity frontier) tend 
to have lower growth rates. Evidently, economies differ in 
more respects than their capital intensities, and hence even 
neoclassic theory only postulates conditional convergence 
(after accounting for all other factors). 
The neoclassic concept of capital is usefully extended to 
include also human capital in the form of education, 
experience, and health (see, e.g., Lucas, 1988; Barro and Sala-
I-Martin, 1995). Thus, additional convergence potentials 
accrue for economies with a proportionally higher ratio of 
human-to-physical capital. Equally, the generation and 
adoption of new technologies is facihtated by high human 
capital. Yet, even with the inclusion of human capital, long-
term per capita growth must eventually cease in the absence of 
continuous improvements in technology. This cessation, 
however, mostly affects economies at the productivity frontier 
and not those that lag behind. For the latter, both theory and 
empirical evidence seem, all else being equal, to indicate 
conditional convergence (i.e., "the poor can get richer."). The 
c e t e r i s p a r i b u s condition is an impoitant qualifier for the 
convergence theorem. Evidently, the potential for conditional 
convergence and economic catch-up cannot be realized in an 
economy struck by civil war, poor institutions, or even low 
savings rates (related to the demographic transition discussed 
in Section 3.2). The recent Asian financial crisis also 
demonstrated that differential capital productivity indeed can 
lead to vast influxes of capital into developing economies, and 
appropriate 
assimilaflve capacities 
(banking 
systems, 
functioning legal system, institutions, etc.) need to be in place 
to use such capital flows productively (World Bank, 1998b). 
In terms of a functional relationship, therefore, per capita 
GDP 
growth rates are expected to be higher for economies 
with low per capita GDP levels. Notwithstanding many 
frustrating setbacks, such as the recent "lost decade" for 
economic catch-up in Africa and Latin America, empirical 
data indicate that the convergence theorem holds. Figure 3-11 
illustrates some empirical evidence put forward by Barro 
(1997) based on the experiences of some 100 countries in the 
period 1960 to 1985. 
Similar convergence trends have also been identified w i t h i n 
economies. For instance. Barro and Sala-I-Martin (1995) find 
significant convergence trends across individual states in the 
USA, 
between prefectures in Japan, and between different 
regions in Europe. Bairo (1997) concludes in his analysis that 
the conditional convergence rates across these countries is 
statistically highly significant, and proceeds rather slowly at

2-3% per year. It may take an economy 27 years to reach 50% 
of steady-state levels (the productivity frontier) and some 90 
years to achieve 90% of that level. Based on this convergence 
criterion alone, it may well take a century (given all other 
factors set favorably) for a poor economy to catch-up to levels 
that prevail in the industrial countries today, never mind the 
levels that might prevail in affluent countries 100 years in the 
future. Barro's analysis indicates a threshold GDP per capita 
level at approximately US$3000 per year. Below that level, 
additional productivity growth potentials result from catch-up; 
beyond that level, higher per capita GDP levels make further 
productivity growth ever more difficult to achieve (as indicated 
by the negative values of the residual GDP per capita growth 
rates in Figure 3-11). 
Given the wide range in historical experiences and the slow 
rates of convergence suggested by neoclassic growth theory, it 
is not surprising that the available scenario literature takes a 
cautious view on economic catch-up. Whereas convergence 
tendencies are generally evident in scenario assumptions (see 
the signiñcantly higher GDP per capita growth rates for 
currently developing countries compared to industrial 
countries in Figure 3-10), long-term convergence rates are low. 
For instance, from all six IS92 scenarios only one (IS92e) 
assumes that developing countries outside China may 
eventually reach present OECD income levels, and even in this 
most optimistic scenario it is assumed to occur only after 2080 
(Pepper et a l . , 1992). Even in this convergence scenario per 
capita income differences remain large - a factor of five by the 
end of the simulation horizon (US$31,000 per capita GDP per 
year in developing countries outside China versus US$150,000 
OECD average). In an influential critique Parikh (1992) 
referred to the IS92 scenario series as being "unfair to the 
South," a point also taken up in the evaluation of the IS92 
scenarios. Alcamo et a l . (1995) concluded that new IPCC 
scenarios "will be needed for exploring a wide variety of 
economic development pathways, for example, a closing of the 
income gap between industrial and developing countries." With 
a few notable exceptions (e.g., the scenario developed by 
Lazarus et a l . (1993) and the Case С scenarios presented in 
IIASA-World Energy Conference (WEC) (IIASA-WEC, 
1995) and Nakicenovic e t a l . (1998a)), the challenge to explore 
conditions and pathways that close the income gap between 
developing and industrial regions appears to have been 
insufficientiy taken up in the scenario literature, a gap this 
report aims to begin to fill. Chapter 4 describes two scenarios 
in which the ratios between regions of GDP/capita decline and 
the absolute differences increase.

I n t e n s i t y 
Evidence suggests that the physical input of energy or 
materials per unit of monetary output (materials or energy 
intensity) follows an inverted U-curve (lU hypothesis) as a 
function of income. For some materials the lU-hypothesis 
(Moll, 1989; Tilton, 1990) holds quite well. The underiying 
explanatory factors are a mixture of structural change in the 
economy along with technology and resource substitution and 
innovation processes. Recent literature illustrates material 
consumption that rises faster than GDP in well-developed 
countries in a relationship better described as N-shaped (de 
Bruyn and Opschoor, 1994; de Bruyn, et a l , 1995; Suri and 
Chapman, 1996; Ansuategi et a l , 1997). A similar l U curve is 
observed for modem, commercial energy forms (Darmstadter 
et a l , 1977; Goldemberg et a l , 1988; Martin, 1988; 
IIASA-WEC, 1995; Watson et a l , 1996; Judson et a l , 1999), 
although the initially rising part of commercial energy 
intensity stems from the substitution of traditional (inefficient) 
energy fonns and technologies by modem commercial energy 
forms (see also the discussion of the "environmental Kuznets 
curve" for traditional air pollutants in Section 3.1, also an 
inverted U-shaped curve). The resultant aggregate total 
(commercial plus non-commercial) energy intensity shows a 
persistent declining trend over time, especially with rising 
incomes (Watson et a l , 1996; Nakicenovic et a l , 1998a). 
Empirical evidence thus suggests that, all else being equal, 
energy and materials intensities are closely related to overall 
macroeconomic productivity. In other 
words, higher 
productivity (GDP per capita) is associated with lower energy 
and materials intensity (lower use of energy and materials per 
unit of 
GDP). 
Figure 3-12 shows material intensity versus per capita income 
data for 13 world regions for some metals (Van Vuuren et a l , 
2000; see also the discussion in de Vries et a l , 1994). Figure 
3-13 shows a similar curve for total energy intensity (including 
traditional non-commercial energy forms) for 11 world 
1 2 4 
S c e n a r i o D r i v i n g F o r c e s 
regions', again as a function of per capita income (Nakicenovic 
et a l . , 1998a). 
The most important conclusion to retain from Figures 3-12 and 
3-13 is that energy and materials intensity (i.e. energy use per 
unit of economic output) tend to decline with rising levels of 
GDP per capita. Thus, energy and material productivity - the 
inverse of energy intensity - improve in line with overall 
macroeconomic productivity (as represented, e.g., by GDP per 
capita levels). Also, they tend to deteriorate when productivity 
levels fall, as happened during the start of the deep economic 
recession in Central and Eastem Europe (Govemment of 
Russian Federation, 1995). A corollary of this relationship is 
that material and energy intensities decline the faster per capita 
income grows. Thus, overall economic productivity growth 
(GDP 
per capita growth) and reductions in materials and 
energy use per unit GDP (materials and energy productivity 
growth) are closely related. The fundamental reason is that 
high macroeconomic growth presupposes accelerated rates of 
technical change and corresponds with a fast turnover of 
capital stock and, hence, a faster incorporation in the economy. 
This represents an important new finding for long-term energy 
and emissions scenarios that have, to date, largely treated 
economic and resource productivity growth as independent of

each other. According to recent empirical and theoretical 
findings, they no longer can. 
Two final caveats are important. First, growth in productivity 
and intensity improvement growth have historically been 
outpaced by economic output growth. Hence, materials and 
energy use has risen in absolute tenns (see Nriagu, 1996; 
Watson et a i , 1996; Griibler, 1998a). The second caveat is that 
energy and material intensity are affected by many factors 
other than macroeconomic productivity growth and resultant 
income. OECD (1998b) notes that high rates of productivity 
increase have been associated in the past with new competitive 
pressures, strong price or regulatory incentives, catching up or 
recovery, and a good "climate for innovation." Also, the 
emergence of new technologies and 
resource-strategic 
considerations has led to rapid productivity growth. 
Table 3-3 summarizes selected macroeconomic, labor, energy, 
and material productivity increases that have been achieved in 
a range of economies and sectors at different times. Principally, 
it demonstrates that the least likely assumption for future 
scenarios from historical evidence is absence of productivity 
growth. Human ingenuity (as reflected in new technologies and 
new practices) historically has responded to puiposeful action 
(R&D and inventive activities) and to a wide range of policies 
to improve vastly productivity in the use of a l l factors of 
production. Of course, it remains uncertain how future 
productivity growth rates will diffuse nationally, regionally, 
and internationally. The essential lesson provided by history is 
that change is continuous and pervasive. From that perspective, 
static or "business-as-usual" scenarios need to be replaced by 
"dynamics-as-usual" scenarios, which divide into "fast" and 
S c e n a r i o D r i v i n g F o r c e s

"slow" alternatives as a function of perceived opportunities, 
new institutional configurations, policies, and environmental 
constraints, even if these do not include climate policies (as 
mandated by the SRES Terms of Reference, see Appendix I). 
For 
instance, low historical rates of energy intensity 
improvement reflect the low priority placed on energy 
efficiency by most producers and users of technology. On 
average energy costs account for only about 5% of GDP. Energy 
intensity reductions average about 1 % per year, in contrast to 
improvements in labor productivity above 2% per year over the 
period 1870 to 1992. Over shorter time periods, and given 
appropriate incentives, energy intensity improvement rates can 
be substantially higher, as in the OECD countries after 1973 or 
in China since 1977, where energy intensity improvement rates 
of 5% have been observed. Rapid productivity growth can also 
occur during periods of successful economic catch-up; for 
instance, Japanese labor productivity grew at 7.7% annually 
during 1950-1973 (Maddison, 1995). Similar high-productivity 
growths were also achieved in industrial oil usage in the OECD 
or US car fuel economies after 1973. Of the examples given in 
Table 3-3, productivity increases are the highest for 
communication. Not surprisingly, many observers consider that 
given a continuation of historical trends communication may 
become a similarly important driver of economic growth in the 
future as traditional, resource- and energy-intensive industries 
have been in the past.

The 
i n f o r m a l 
economy: 
• 
What is the link between informal economic activities 
and GHG emissions? 
The effect of development pattern assumptions in the 
assessment of future G H G emissions is greater for developing 
countries. As a major part of the needed infrastracture to meet 
development needs is still to be built in the developing 
countries, the spectrum of future options is considerably 
wider than that in industrial countries. The traditional 
approach to assume "business-as-usual" as the baseline is 
particularly meaningless in such cases; instead there is a need 
for multiple baselines for different scenaiios built to cover the 
range of possible futures. It cannot be assumed that 
developing countries will automatically follow the past 
development paths of industrial countries. The significant 
transformations that recentiy intervened in the intemational 
economy and energy markets hightight the important dangers 
of such a double analogy, both in space and time. It can also 
be argued that many developing countries may have passed 
already any developmental bifurcation point, in which case 
developments could follow the pattems of industriaUzed 
countries. 
Both the GDP stracture and the physical basis on which it is to 
be achieved in developing countries have to be considered. A 
cracial question regards their share in the world production of 
highly energy- and pollution-intensive goods, such as steel and 
S c e n a r i o D r i v i n g F o r c e s 
1 2 7 
aluminum. As the recent shift of heavy industries from the 
industrial toward the developing countries ends, long-term 
economic output could come from services and other less 
energy-intensive activities. 
Moreover, technological choices, both in production and 
consumption apparatus, can substantially decrease the energy 
demand per GDP. For instance, Chinese households are not 
bound to adopt the same model of energy-intensive 
refrigerators that have equipped American families. Similarly, 
future cement factories in developing countries should not fail 
to include up-to-date technological improvements, such as the 
dry process. 
The spatial distribution of the population and its ecoiiomic 
activities is still unclear, which raises the possibility of adopting 
urban and/or regional planning. Industrial policies directed at 
rural development and strengthening the role of small and 
medium cities would reduce the extent of rural exodus and the 
degree of demographic concentration in large cities. 
These examples show that developing countries could adopt 
anticipative strategies to avoid, in the long-term, the problems 
faced today by industrial societies ("leapfrogging"). Such 
alternative development patterns highlight the technical 
feasibility of emission futures in the developing regions that 
can 
be compatible with national objectives. However, the 
barriers to a more sustainable development in the developing 
regions can hardly be underestimated, and range from financial 
constraints to cultural behaviors (in both industrial and 
developing countries), which include the lack of appropriate 
institutional structures. 
3.3.5. 
Conclusion 
The process of economic and social development depends both 
on the ability of the current lead countries in productivity to 
maintain their technological and institutional creativity, and on 
the ability of other countries to adopt 
leading-edge 
technologies and institutions or to develop their own. The 
crucial issues of "how much" and "what kind" of productivity 
growth can be addressed only by describing alternative 
scenarios of future development. To develop alternative 
scenarios it is necessary to recall the important qualitative 
relationship between demographic transition and social and 
economic development. Causality links could be in either 
direction, but the importance of the relationship is recognized 
in 
both theoretical and empirical studies. Hence, as 
summarized in Section 3.2, this relationship should be 
incoфorated into the SRES scenarios. Scenarios of accelerated 
rates of economic and social development should therefore be 
the scenarios with an accelerated demographic transition. This 
corresponds to a linking of high per capita development with 
comparatively low population levels. 
There is a need to explore in particular pathways that close the 
development gap (see Parikh, 1992; Alcamo et a l . , 1995). As 
the likelihood of zero or even negative productivity growth in 
the developed countries is low, closure of the development gap 
requires accelerated rates of productivity growth and the need 
to overcome or avoid setbacks in per capita income growth in 
many developing countries. Scenarios that explore this 
possibility will necessarily extend beyond the range of futures 
spanned by the IS92 scenarios, as well as beyond the range of 
the majority of the "conventional wisdom" scenario literature 
on the future of developing countries. 
As 
a major part of the needed infrastructure to meet 
development needs still has to be built, the spectrum of future 
options is considerably wider in developing than in industrial 
countries. For instance, the technical possibilities for low 
emission futures in the developing countries are many. The 
extent of the spectrum of future options depends on the 
changes discussed in Sections 3.2 and 3.3, but also on the 
outcome of crucial issues. These include political power 
structure, national governance and institutional structure; 
income distribution; cultural attitudes and consumption 
patterns (diets, housing, etc.), development of and access to 
modem technologies (energy, production, distribution, etc.), 
and the geographic distribution of activities (land use, urban 
settlement, transportation needs, etc.). 
Particular sets of technological and behavioral options can be 
clustered into alternative, internally consistent packages to 
represent dilïerent choices over time and so define different 
development paths for any economy. Such clusters can give 
rise to self-reinforcing loops between technical choice, 
consumer demand, and geographic distribution, which create 
"lock-in" effects and foreclosures of options in technology and 
socio-institutional innovations. The time-dependent nature of 
these choices gives rise to bifurcations and irreversibilities in 
which the shift from one development path to another entails 
important economic and political costs. 
Globalization of markets, technologies, and information 
networks may help accelerate productivity growth in the 
future. However, both economic and social losers could result 
from the globalization process. The financial instability during 
1998 has cast further doubt on the inevitability of global 
convergence as a standard model of political economy. Hence, 
a further important dimension of uncertainty to be explored in 
the scenarios is the degree of globalization or regionalization in 
economic, social, and technological development. 
The 
various perspectives on economic history discussed in 
Section 3.3.4 reveal several possible options for the future: 
• 
Perhaps the most extreme view may be that the 
development process is nearing completion in Europe, 
North America, and Australasia, so that the main 
prospect for growth is through the diffusion of existing 
best-practice technologies to the rest of the world. 
• 
The nature of economic development may have 
changed significantly in high-income countries, with a 
new emphasis on services, quality, and information. 
1 2 8 
S c e n a r i o D r i v i n g F o r c e s 
Such development is hard to measure in material terms. 
Many writers refer to "dematerialization" and the 
emergence of the "knowledge-based" economy. 
• 
The start of a new "Kondratiev wave" may be 
underway, to be revealed in the early 2P' century in a 
surge 
of economic growth, with the 
massive 
development of high-technology industries leading to 
new products of increasing value and renewed 
opportunities for fast developmental catch-up. 
As a result, scenarios can span from low dematerialization to 
high dematerialization futures associated with a wide range of 
income levels. In the former, the shift toward more value-added 
products in industry would be compensated by rising labor 
productivity and hence lower product costs. Economic 
production remains material oriented. It may be a world with 
huge underground cities, air-conditioned tourist resort areas 
with indoor beaches, a significant fraction of people in low-
density regions may fly their own aiфlanes, and robots may do 
housework in most homes. In the latter, much of the money 
flow would be associated with exchange of information and 
services. Industrial value added would be, to a large extent, 
generated from R&D and know-how, and less from increasing 
productivity in traditional industries. Educational, childcare, 
and medical services would make up a large part of personal 
expenditures. Already, all kinds of artistic and handicraft work 
have become part of the formal monetary economy, partly 
because of the booming world tourist industry. Much 
"economic growth" may revolve around the (re)distribution of 
scarce, positional goods such as space and valuable artworks. 
Therefore, the task of future scenario development entails more 
than just the adoption of altemative quantitative assumptions. 
The overall context within which altemative assumptions on 
productivity growth or energy and materials intensity take 
place needs to be made explicit. This is simply because many 
key influencing factors (e.g., institutions) cannot be assessed 
quantitatively, or the relationship between factors is known 
only qualitatively. The development of altemative qualitative 
scenario "storylines" (see Chapter 4) is therefore an important 
advance over previous IPCC scenario methodologies.

In this section, energy end-uses, resources, and technologies

future emissions levels. First, major pattems of energy end-use

Sectors 
3 . 4 . 2 . 1 . 
O v e r v i e w 
Sectoral energy use and G H G emissions changes are often 
discussed in terms of trends in the major end-use sectors (e.g., 
Sathaye et a l . , 1989; lEA, 1997c; Schipper et a l , 1997a; Price 
et a l , 1998). Trends reveal striking differences between sectors 
and regions of the world. The key sectors of the economy that 
use energy are industry (including agriculture), commercial, 
residential, and institutional buildings, and transportation. Key 
drivers of energy use and carbon emissions include activity 
drivers (total population growth, urbanization, building, and 
vehicle stock, commodity production), economic drivers (total 
GDP, income, and price elasticities), energy intensity trends 
(energy intensity of energy-using equipment, appliances, 
vehicles), and carbon intensity trends. These factors are in tum 
driven by changes in consumer preferences, energy and 
technology costs, settlement and infrastructure patterns, 
technical progress, and overall economic conditions. 
Table 3-4 shows that global primary energy use grew from 
191 EJ in I97I to 307 EJ in 1990 at an average annual growth 
rate of 2.5% per year. This growth tapered off in all sectors 
after 1990, and total global primary energy increased to only 
319 EJ by 1995, mainly because of the large declines 
experienced in the REF region (see Chapter 1 for definition of 
SRES world regions) as a result of the political and economic 
restracturing of the countries within it. Table 3-4 shows that 
the industrial sector clearly dominates total primary energy 
use, 
followed 
by the buildings sector (commercial, 
residential, and institutional buildings combined), transport 
sector, and agriculture sector. 
Energy intensity is the amount of energy used to perform a 
particular service, such as to produce a ton of steel, power a 
refrigerator, or propel a vehicle. Technical progress generally 
leads to improved energy efficiency in technologies such as 
lights, vehicles, refrigerators, and manufacturing processes. 
Many studies show that considerable energy efficiency 
improvement can be realized (technically and economically) in 
the short term (10-15 years) with available technologies 
(Szargut and Morris, 1987; Ayres, 1989; Jochem, 1989; Lovins 
and Lovins, 1991; Nakicenovic et a l , 1993; WEC, 1995b; 
Watson e t a l . , 1996; Worrell e t a l . , 1997). 
In 1990, industry accounted for two-fifths of global primary 
energy use, residential and commercial buildings for a slightly 
smaller amount, and transportation for one-fifth of the total. 
These shares vary according to economic structures in each 
region (see below). Carbon emissions that result from energy 
use depend on the carbon intensity of the energy source. 
Changes in carbon intensity mainly result from fuel 
substitution, but can also arise from changes in technology or 
process. The largest shifts in carbon intensity over the long 
term are associated with changes in the energy sources used for 
power generation since 1850 (Nakicenovic and Grübler, 1996). 
Smaller but still significant shifts resulted from fuel switching

in industrial, commercial, and residential energy consumption. 
The relationship between total sector energy use and economic 
drivers such as GDP per capita varies across countries depends 
upon the sector. In 1995, the relationship in the transport and 
buildings sectors was relatively strong and that in the industrial 
sector was moderate (Price et a i , 1998). Income elasticities 
vary widely among the different types of energy services and 
the country or region under consideration. For example, the 
income elasticity of refrigerator ownership in most countries in 
the IND region (see Chapter 1 for definition of SRES world 
regions) is extremely low, as most households already own a 
refrigerator. The elasticity is much higher in medium-income 
countries in which refrigerator ownership is low. Other 
economic indicators, such as level of economic development in 
the industrial sector and personal consumption expenditures in 
residential buildings, are more closely correlated with energy 
use in these sectors.

Driving forces behind energy use and carbon emissions in the 
industrial sector include the state of economic development, 
consumption and trade pattems, relative costs of labor, capital, 
and energy, and availability of resources. In 1990, industry 
accounted for 42% (129 EJ) of global primary energy use. 
Between 1971 and 1990, industrial energy use grew at a rate of 
2.1 % per year, slightly less than the world total energy demand 
growth of 2.5% per year. This growth rate has slowed in recent 
years, and was virtually fiat between 1990 and 1995, primarily 
because of declines in industrial output in the REF region.

S c e n a r i o D r i v i n g F o r c e s 
Energy use in tlie industrial sector is dominated by the 
industrialized countries, which accounted for 42% of world 
industrial energy use in 1990. Countries in the REF, ASIA, and 
A L M regions used 29%, 20%, and 9% of world industrial 
energy, respectively, that year. The share of industrial sector 
energy consumption within the industrialized countries 
declined from 40% in 1971 to 33% in 1995, which partly 
reflects 
the transition toward a less 
energy-intensive 
manufacturing base. The industrial sector dominates in the 
REF region, accounting for more than 50% of total primary 
energy demand, a result of the long-term policy that 
emphasized materials production and was promoted under 
years of central planning. Average annual growth in industrial 
energy use in this region was 2% between 1971 and 1990, but 
dropped by an average of 7.3% per year between 1990 and 
1995 (lEA, 1997a; lEA, 1997b; BP, 1997). 
The agriculture sector used only 3% of global primary 
commercial energy in 1990. Unlike the other sectors, the REF 
region dominated agricultural energy use in 1990, using 34% 
of the total, followed by the IND (30%), ASIA (26%), and 
A L M (10%). Between 1971 and 1990, the average amiual 
growth in primary energy used for agriculture was slower in the 
industrialized countries (2.2% per year) than in the three other 
regions, for which growth ranged between 4.5% and 4.8% per 
year. Trends in agricultural primary energy use changed 
significantly in the REF and A L M regions after 1990, with 
REF consumption dropping to an average of 10.6% per year 
and A L M consumption increasing to an average of 12.6% per 
year by 1995. 
Energy use in the industrial sector is dominated by the 
production of a few major energy-intensive commodities, such 
as steel, paper, cement, and chemicals. Rapidly industrializing 
countries have higher demands for these infrastructure 
materials and more mature markets have declining or stable 
levels of consumption. Studies of material consumption in 
industrialized countries show increases 
in the 
initial 
development of society to a maximum consumption level, 
which then remains constant or even decHnes as infrastructure 
needs are met and material recycling increases. Absolute and 
per capita consumptions of some materials appear to have 
reached levels of stabilization in many industrialized countries, 
although this is not true of all materials (e.g. paper). Expressed 
as a function of unit GDP, material intensity generally declines 
after reaching a maximum (WilUams et a l . , 1987; Wemick, 
1996; WRI, 
1997b; see also Section 3.3). Although the use of 
all materials in developing countries will certainly grow, per 
capita consumption may not reach that in the industrialized 
countries, because more efficient processes and substitutes are 
available. 
Carbon intensities with respect to GDP (CO2 emissions as a 
function of GDP) 
in the industrial sector have been relatively 
stable in most countries except for those that are rapidly 
industrializing (Houghton et a i , 1995). This trend results from 
the changing economic structure, reduced energy intensity, and 
reduced carbon intensity of the fuel mix. A shift toward less 
carbon-intensive fuels took place between 1971 and 1992 in 
most industrialized countries, as well as in South Korea (Aug 
and Pandiyan, 1997; Schipper et a l . , 1997a). The industrial 
sector fuel mix has become more carbon-intensive in some 
developing countries, such as China and Mexico (Ang and 
Pandiyan, 1997; Sheinbaum and Rodriguez, 1997), although a 
trend away from coal to other fuels has also occurred in some 
developing countries (Han and Chatterjee, 
1997). The 
contribution of fuel-mix changes to COj emissions reduction 
has been .small in most industrialized countries (Golove and 
Schipper, 1997; Schipper 
a/., 1997a). 
Technical energy-intensity reductions of I to 2% per year are 
possible in the industrial sector and have occurred in the past 
(Ross and Steinmeyer, 1990). The annual change in energy 
intensity in the industrial sector varied between -0.1% and 
-6.6% 
per year for a variety of countries from the early 1970s 
to the early 1990s. Generally, electricity intensity remained 
constant and fuel intensity declined, which reflects the 
increasing importance of electricity (lEA, 1997c).

In the buildings sector, household expenditure levels, appliance 
and equipment penetration levels, and the share of population 
that lives in urban areas all affect energy use. In 1990, 
residential, commercial, and institutional buildings consumed 
almost 100 EJ of primary energy, about one-third of the total 
global primary energy. Uncertainties persist with respect to 
quantities and structure of non-commercial fuel use in 
developing countries. Primary energy use in the buildings 
sector worldwide grew at an average annual rate of 2.9% 
between 1971 and 1990. Growth in buildings energy use varied 
widely by region, ranging from 1.8% per yeai' in the IND 
region to 7.1% per year in the A L M 
region. Growth in 
commercial buildings was higher than growth in residential 
buildings in all regions of the world, averaging 3.5% per year 
globally. In 1990, the IND region used about 60% of global 
building energy, followed by REF (22%), ASIA (10%), and 
A L M (9%) countries, respectively. • Between 1990 and 1995, 
growth in the use of primary energy in buildings slowed in all 
regions except the industrialized countries, where buildings 
primary energy use climbed at an average of 1.9% per year. 
The greatest decline occuired in the REF region, where 
buildings energy use declined by an average of 6.8% annually 
between 1990 and 1995, dominated by a 7.2% per year average 
drop in residential primary energy use. Growth in buildings 
energy use in the other two regions ~ ASIA and A L M - slowed 
during this period, but growth rates were still high, averaging 
4.8% 
and 3.8%, respectively (BP, 1997; l E A , 1997a; lEA, 
1997b). 
Along with population size, key activity drivers of energy 
demand in buildings are the rate of urbanization, number of 
dwellings, per capita living area, persons per residence, and 
commercial floor space. As populations become more 
urbanized and areas develop electrification, the demand for 
energy services such as refrigeration, lighting, heating, and 
S c e n a r i o D r i v i n g F o r c e s 
1 3 1 
cooling increases. In the residential buildings sector, the level 
of energy demand is further influenced by population age 
distribution, household income, number of households, size of 
dwellings, and number of people per household. In the 
commercial buildings sector, factors that influence energy 
demand include the overall population level (i.e., the number of 
people who desire commercial services), the size of the labor 
force, and commercial sector income. 
The number of people living in urban areas increased from 
1.35 billion, or 37% of the total, in 1970 to 2.27 bilhon, or 
43% of the total, in 1990 (see also Section 3.2). Growth in 
urbanization was strongest in the ASIA and A L M regions, 
where the average annual increase in urban population was 
nearly 4.0% per year. This increase and the resultant income 
effects led to increased usage of commercial fuels, such as 
kerosene and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), for cooking 
instead of traditional biomass fuels. In general, higher levels 
of urbanization are associated with higher incomes and 
increased household energy use (Sathaye et a l . , 1989; Nadel et 
al., 1997). 
Energy consumption in residential buildings is strongly 
correlated with household income levels. Between 1973 and 
1993, 
increases in total private consumption translated into 
larger homes, more appUances, and an increased use of energy 
services (water heating, space heating) in most industrialized 
countries (lEA, 1997c). Dwelling size is a key determinant of 
residential energy use, and has grown with personal 
consumption expenditures in most industrialized countries. In 
the DEV region, urban areas are generally associated with 
higher average incomes (Sathaye and Ketoff, 1991). Wealthier 
populaces in developing countries exhibit consumption 
patterns similar to those in industrialized countries - purchases 
of appliances and other energy-using equipment increase with 
gains in disposable income (WEC, 
1995b). 
In the commercial sector, the ratio of primary energy use to 
commercial sector GDP fell in a number of industrialized 
countries between 1970 and the early 1990s, despite a large 
growth in energy-using equipment in commercial buildings. 
Almost certainly this is an effect of improved equipment 
efficiencies 
combined with economic growth in the 
commercial sector 
unrelated 
to energy 
consumption. 
Electricity use in the commercial sector shows a relatively 
strong correlation with commercial sector GDP, although there 
is a wide range of electricity use at any given level of 
commercial sector GDP 
(lEA, 1997c). 
Overall energy intensity in the buildings sector can be 
measured using energy consumption per capita values. 
Between 1971 and 1990, global primary energy use in the 
buildings sector grew from 16.5 GJ per capita to 20 GJ per 
capita. Buildings per capita energy use varied widely by 
region, with the IND and REF regions dominating globally. 
Energy use per capita was higher in the residential sector than 
in the commercial sector in all regions, although average 
annual growth in commercial energy use per capita was higher 
during the period, averaging 1.7% per year globally compared 
to 0.6% per year for the residential sector (Price et a l . , 1998). 
Space heating is an important end-use in the IND and REF 
regions and in some developing countries; it accounts for half 
of China's residential and commercial building energy demand 
(Nadel et a l . , 1997). The penetration of central heating 
doubled, from about 40% of dwellings to almost 80% of 
dwellings, in many industrialized countries between 1970 and 
1992 (lEA, 1997c). District heating systems are common in 
some areas of Europe and in the REF region. Space heating is 
not common in most developing countries, with the exception 
of China, South Korea, South Africa, Argentina, and a few 
other South American countries (Sathaye et a l . , 1989). 
Residential space-heating energy intensities declined in most 
industrial countries (except Japan) between 1970 and 1992 
because of reduced heat losses in buildings, lowered indoor 
temperatures, 
more 
careful 
heating 
practices, 
and 
improvements in efficiency of heating equipment (Schipper et 
a l . , 1996; lEA, 1997c). Water heating, refrigeration, space 
cooling, and lighting are the next largest residential energy 
uses, respectively, in most industrialized countries (lEA, 
1997c). In developing countries, cooking and water heating 
dominate, followed by lighting, small appliances, and 
refrigerators 
(Sathaye 
and 
Ketoff 
1991). Appliance 
penetration rates increased in all regions between 1970 and 
1990. The energy intensity of new appliances has declined over 
the past two decades - new refrigerators in the US were 65% 
less energy-intensive in 1993 than in 1972 (Schipper et a l . , 
1996). 
Primary energy use per square meter of commercial sector 
floor area has gradually declined in most industrial countries, 
despite countervailing trends such as growth in the share of 
electricity, increases in electricity intensity, and reduction in 
fuel use and fuel intensity. Electricity use and intensity per unit 
area increased rapidly in the commercial buildings sector as the 
penetration of computers, other office equipment, air 
conditioning, and lighting grew. Fuel intensity per unit ai-ea 
declined rapidly in industrialized countries as the share of 
energy used for space heating in commercial buildings dropped 
because of thermal improvements in buildings (Krackeler et 
a i , 1998). 
Carbon intensity of the residential sector declined in most 
industrialized countries between 1970 and the early 1990s 
(LBL, 
1998). In the commercial sector, CO2 emissions per 
square meter of commercial floor area also dropped in most 
industrialized countries during this period, even though carbon 
intensity per unit area for electric end-uses increased in most 
industrialized countries, dropping only in France, Sweden, and 
Norway - countries that moved away from fossil fuels 
(Krackeler et a l . , 1998). In developing countries, (non-
commercial) biomass is often used in the residential sector, 
especially in rural areas. Increased urbanization, as well as 
increases in incomes and rural electrification, can lead to rising 
carbon intensities in buildings when sustainable biomass use is 
replaced with carbon-intensive fuels such as LPG, coal, and 
132 
S c e n a r i o D r i v i n g F o r c e s 
electricity generated by fossil fuels. Conversely, if biomass use 
was previously on an unsustainable basis, the shift toward 
commercial fuels can lower carbon intensities. The trend 
toward replacement of biomass fuels by commercial fuels is 
expected to continue in developing countries (lEA, 1995). 
In addition to the energy use in buildings, Tiwari and Parikh 
(1995) drew attention to energy use for buildings construction, 
which accounts for 17% of India's carbon emissions in tenns 
of embodied energy in steel, cement, glass, bricks, etc. 
Typically, this embodied buildings energy is accounted for as 
industrial energy use in energy statistics. Tiwari and Parikh 
(1995) found that in India alternative construction methods 
could save 23% of energy use at 0.03% increase in costs.

T r a n s p o r t 
The transport sector consumed slightly over 63 EJ, or about 
20% 
of global primary energy, in 1990. Transport sector 
primary energy use grew at a relatively rapid average annual 
rate of 2.8% between 1971 and 1990, slowing to 1.7% per year 
between 1990 and ¡995. Industrialized countries clearly 
dominate energy consumption in this sector, using 62% of the 
world's transport energy in 1990, followed by REF (16%), 
A L M (12%), and ASIA (10%) regions. The most rapid growth 
was seen in the ASIA countries (5.9% per year) and the A L M 
region (4.6% per year). Transport energy use dropped 
dramatically in the REF region after 1990; by 1995 this region 
only consumed 11% of global transport energy use. Growth in 
transpoit primary energy use also declined slightly in the IND 
region, dropping from an average of 2.2% per year between 
1971 and 1990 to 1.9% per year between 1990 and 1995. High 
growth continued in the ASIA and A L M regions, with the 
ASIA countries increasing to an average of 7.6% per year 
between 1990 and 1995 (BR 1997; lEA, 1997a; lEA, 1997b). 
Influences on G H G emissions from the transport sector are 
often divided into those that affect activity levels (travel and 
freight movements) and those that affect technology (energy 
efficiency, carbon intensity of fuel, emission factors for nitrous 
oxide (NjO), etc.). The various driving forces and their effects 
are reviewed in detail in the IPCC Working Group II (WGII) 
Second Assessment Report (SAR) 
(Michaelis et a l . , 1996). 
In aggregate, transport patterns are closely related to economic 
activity, infrastructure, settlement pattems, and prices of fuels 
and vehicles. They are also related to communication links. At 
the household level, travel is affected by transport costs, 
income, household size, local settlement patterns, the 
occupation of the head of the household, household make-up, 
and location (Jansson, 1989; Hensher et a l . , 1990; Walls et a l . , 
1993). People in higher-skilled occupations that require higher 
levels of education are more price- and income-responsive in 
their transport energy demand than people in lower-skilled 
occupations (Greening and Jeng, 1994; Greening et a l . , 1994). 
Urban layout both affects and is affected by the predominant 
transport systems. It is also strongly influenced by other factors 
such as people's preference for living in low-density areas, 
close to parks or other green spaces, away from industry, and 
close to schools and other services. Travel pattems may be 
influenced by many factors, including the size of the 
settlements, proximity to other settlements, location of 
workplaces, provision of local facilities, and car ownership. A 
survey of cities around the world (Newman and Kenworthy, 
1990) found that population density strongly and inversely 
correlates with transport energy use. 
Many studies have examined the response of car travel and 
gasoline demand to gasoline price, and are reviewed, for 
example, in Michaelis (1996) and Michaelis et a l . (1996). Such 
studies typically find a measurable reduction in fuel demand, 
distance traveled, car sales, and energy intensity in response to 
fuel price increases. Studies of freight transport found 
relatively small short-term impacts of diesel price increases, 
and often produced results that were inconclusive or 
statistically insignificant. Over the longer term, price 
responsiveness is generally assumed to be larger because of 
possible technology responses. 
An 
important influence on future travel may be the 
development of telecommunication technologies. In some 
instances, improved communication can substitute for travel 
as people can work at home or shop via the intemet. In others, 
communication can help to increase travel by enabling 
friendships and working relationships to develop over long 
distances, and by permitting people to stay in touch with their 
homes and offices while traveling. To the extent that 
improvements in telecommunication technology stimulate the 
economy, they are likely to result in increased freight 
transport. 
Energy intensity in the transport sector is measured as energy 
used per passenger-km for passenger transport and per ton-km 
for freight transport. Transport energy projections typically 
incorporate a reduction in fleet energy intensity in the range 0.5 
to 2% per year (Grübler et a l , 1993b; l E A , 1993; Walsh, 
1993). On-road energy intensity (fuel consumption per 
kilometer driven) of Hght-duty passenger vehicles in North 
America fell by nearly 2% per year between 1970 and 1990, to 
about 13 to 14 liters per 100 kilometers, but it is now stationary 
or rising. In other industrialized countries, changes in on-road 
fuel consumption from 1970 to the present were quite small. 
The average on-road energy intensity in North America was 
85% higher than that in Europe in 1970, but only 25 to 30% 
higher by the mid-1990s (Schipper, 1996). 
In some countries, such as Italy and France, where fleet 
average energy intensity has fallen during the past 20 years, the 
energy intensity of car travel (MJ/passenger-km) has increased 
as a result of declining car occupancy and the increasing use of 
more efficient diesel vehicles (Schipper et a l , 1993). However, 
conversion to diesel has been encouraged by low duties on 
diesel fuel relative to those on gasoline. The lower costs of 
driving diesel vehicles may have acted as a significant stimulus 
to travel by diesel car owners, and so offset much of the energy 
S c e n a r i o D r i v i n g 
F o r c e s 
133 
saved from their high-energy efficiency. A more recent trend, 
though, is toward higher energy intensity in new cars in 
countries such as the US, Germany, and Japan (lEA, 
1993). 
Factors in the recent increases in energy intensity include the 
trend toward larger cars, increasing engine size, and the use of 
increasingly power-hungry accessories (Martin and Shock, 
1989; 
Difiglio et a l . , 1990; Greene and Duleep, 1993; l E A , 
1993). 
Average truck energy use per ton-km of freight moved has 
shown little sign of reduction during the past 20 years in 
countries for which data are available (Schipper et a l . , 1993). 
Energy use is typically in the region 0.7 to 1.4 MJ/ton-km for 
the heaviest trucks but can be in excess of 5 MJ/ton-km for 
smaller trucks. In countries where services and light industry 
are growing faster than heavy industry, the share of small 
trucks or vans in road freight is increasing. Along with the 
increasing power-to-weight ratios of goods vehicles, these 
trends offset, and in some cases outweigh, the benefits of 
improved engine and vehicle technology (Delsey, 1991). 
Energy intensity tends to be lower in countries with large 
heavy-industry sectors, because a high proportion of goods 
traffic is made up of bulk materials or primary commodities. 
Air traffic grew about three times as fast as GDP in the early 
1970s, but only about twice as fast since the early 1980s. After 
allowing for the effects of continually falling prices, the 
elasticity of the 10-year average growth rate with respect to the 
10-year average GDP growth is not much more than 1.0 
(Michaelis, 1997a). Over the 30 years to 1990, the average 
energy intensity of the civil aircraft fleet fell by about 2.7% per 
year. The fastest reduction, of about 4% per year, was in the 
period 1974 to 1988. The large reductions in energy intensity 
during the 1970s and 1980s resulted partly from developments 
in the technology used for new aircraft in the rapidly expanding 
civil aircraft fleet and partly from increases in aircraft load 
factor (passengers per seat or percentage of cargo capacity 
filled). The aircraft weight load factor increased from 49% in 
1972 to 59% in 1990, but nearly all of this rise occurred during 
the 1970s (ICAO, 1995a, 1995b). 
Transport sector carbon intensities for personal travel, 
measured as the ratio of emissions to passenger-km traveled, 
increased in most European countries and Japan between 1972 
and 1994. This increase resulted from falling load factors 
(persons per vehicle), which were greater than improvements 
in vehicle energy intensity. The only exception among 
industrialized countries was the US, where carbon intensities 
dropped from 55 kgC/passenger-km in 1972 to 46 
kgC/passenger-km in 1994 (lEA, 1997c; Schipper et a l . , 
1997a). Carbon intensity of freight travel, measured as the ratio 
of emissions to ton-km transported, rose slightly in a number 
of industrialized countries between 1972 and 1994, mostly 
because of modal shifts to more carbon-intensive trucks 
(Schipper et a l . , 1997b). As mobility increases in developing 
countries, transport emissions could rise dramatically. 
Ramanathan and Parikh (1999) indicate passenger traffic 
growth at 8% per year and train traffic growth at 5% per year 
for 
India. They found that efficiency improvements could 
reduce future energy demand by 26%. If in addition, the modal 
split changes in favor of public transport modes, these authors 
estimate a 45% reduction in energy demand (Ramanathan and 
Parikh, 1999). 
Fuels used to power transport are typically oil-based, except 
for rail, for which shifts toward electrified systems can lower 
carbon intensities depending upon the source of fuel for 
electricity generation in the country. In France, for example, 
the move toward electrified rail based on electricity generated 
by nuclear power led to lower carbon intensities (lEA, 1997c). 
Increased use of diesel engines can reduce CO2 emissions, but 
leads to greater emissions of other gaseous pollutants, such as 
NjO and carbon monoxide (CO). 
Use of alternative fuels, such 
as compressed natural gas, LPG, and ethanol, can significantiy 
reduce COj emissions from transport (lEA, 
1995).

Resources 
The term energy resource can be defined as "the occurrence of 
material in recognizable form" (WEC, 1995a) - it is 
essentially the amount of oil, gas, coal, etc., in the ground. In 
the IPCC WGII SAR (energy primer, see Nakicenovic et a l . , 
1996) a further definitional distinction was made. Resources 
were defined as those occurrences considered "potentially 
recoverable with foreseeable technological and economic 
developments" and any additional amounts not considered as 
potentially recoverable were referred to as "occun'ences." An 
energy reserve is a portion of the total, and depends on 
exploration to locate and evaluate a resource and on the 
availability of a technology to extract some of the resource at 
acceptable cost. Proved oil reserves, for example, are defined 
as "those quantities which geological and engineering 
information indicates with reasonable certainty can be 
recovered in the future from known reservoirs under existing 
economic and operating conditions" (BP, 1996). Thus, 
reserves can increase with exploration (new or better 
information), engineering advances (better economic and 
operating conditions), and higher prices (better economic 
conditions). In essence, reserves are "replenished" by shifting 
volumes from the resource into the reserve category. Reserves 
can also be depleted through production and can decrease with 
lower prices. Throughout this section the size of reserve and 
resource figures are expressed in EJ or ZJ (i.e. 10^' J, or 1000 
EJ). 
For SRES the fossil resource categorization used is reserves, 
resources, and additional occuirences. The definition of BP 
(1996) was adopted for reserves. Resources are those 
hydrocarbon occurences with uncertain geologic assurance or 
that lack economic attractiveness. 
Finally, 
all other 
hydrocarbons that do not fall within the reserve and resource 
categories are aggregated 
in the category "additional 
occuirences" (i.e., occurrences that have a high degree of

The assessment is summarized in Table 3-5. This account of 
fossil resources needs to be put in context with the long-run 
demand for these fuels and their relative production 
economics. It is the specific demand for these fuels that 
"converts" resources into reserves (Odell, 1997, 1998, 1999). 
Obviously, this is a dynamic process that, in addition to future 
demand trajectories, depends on advances in taiowledge and 
technological progress. The discussion of oil reserves below 
applies to all hydrocarbon and nuclear resources. 
In terms of exploration, the oil industry is relatively mature and 
the quantity of additional reserves that remain to be discovered 
is unclear . One group argues that few new oil fields are being 
discovered, despite the surge in drilling activity from 1978 to 
1986, 
and that most of the increases in reserves results from 
revisions of underestimated existing reserves (Ivanhoe and 
Leckie, 1993; Laherrere, 1994; Campbell, 1997; Hatfield, 
1997). Laherrere (1994) puts ultimately recoverable oil 
resources at about 10 ZJ (1800 billion baiTcls), including 
production to date. Adelman and Lynch (1997), while 
accepting some aspects in the propositions behind the 
pessimistic view of reserves, point to previous pessimistic 
estimates that have been wrong. They argue that "there are 
huge amounts of hydrocarbons in the earth's crust" and that 
"estimates of declining reserves and production are incurably 
wrong because they treat as a quantity what is really a dynamic 
process driven by growing knowledge." Smith and Robinson 
(1997) note improvements in technology, such as 3D seismic 
surveys and extended reach (e.g. horizontal) drilling, that have 
improved recovery rates from existing reservoirs and made 
profitable the development of fields previously regarded as 
uneconomic. Both of these increase reserves and lower costs. 
The various arguments and assessments are reviewed in greater 
detail in Gregory and Rogner (1998). To include all these views 
and to reflect uncertainty, future reserves availability cannot be 
represented by single numbers. Instead, a range of values that 
reflect the optimistic and pessimistic assumptions on extent 
and success rates of exploration activities, as well as the future 
evolution of prices and technology, needs to be considered for 
a scenario approach. To this end, the estimates of Masters et a l . 
(1994) reflect the current state of knowledge as to the 
uncertainties in future potentials for conventional oil resources. 
These estimates assess conventional oil reserves at slighdy 
above 6 ZJ, and a corresponding range of additionally 
recoverable resources between 1.6 and 5.9 ZJ. The figures 
include estimates of oil that is yet to be discovered. 
In addition to conventional oil reserves and resources, oil 
shales, natural bitumen, and heavy crude oil, together called 
unconventional oil resources, have previously been defined as 
occurrences that cannot be tapped by conventional production 
methods for technical or economic reasons, or both (Rogner, 
1996, 
1997). In part these resources represent some of the huge 
amounts of hydrocarbons in the earth's cmst that Adelman and 
Lynch (1997) refer to. Technologies to extract some of these 
resources competitively at current market conditions are now 
developed and production has started in countries such as 
Canada and Venezuela. Masters et a l . (1987) put total 
recoverable resources of heavy and extra heavy crude oil at 3 
ZJ, recoverable resources of bitumen at 2 ZJ, and ultimate 
resources of shale oil in place at 79 ZJ (they do not estimate 
the proportion of shale oil that might be recovered and hence 
S c e n a r i o D r i v i n g F o r c e s 
135 
give resources in place). The extent to which these 
unconventional resources might be defined as reserves in the 
future depends on the continued development of technologies 
to extract them at acceptable costs. Nakicenovic et a l . (1996) 
in IPCC WGII SAR assess all unconventional oil reserves 
at 
7.1 ZJ, with an additional 20 ZJ of unconventional oil 
resources estimated to be recoverable with foreseeable 
technological progress. 
Estimates of ultimately recoverable reserves of gas are less 
controversial than those for oil. Proved reserves are high, both 
in relation to current production (BP, 1996) and to cumulative 
production to date (Masters et a l . , 1994). Masters et a l . (1994) 
and Ivanhoe and Leckie (1993) note that gas discoveries need 
to be matched to an infrastructure for gas consumption, which 
is currently lacking in many parts of the world. Hence, 
exploration has been limited and the potential for discoveries 
of major quantities of gas in the 2P' century is high. Estimates 
of gas reserves and resources are being revised continuously. 
The most up-to-date information is represented by the figures 
of the Intemational Gas Union (IGU, 1997a), which give 
conventional gas reserves of 5.4 ZJ plus 9.4 ZJ additional 
reserves, including gas yet to be discovered. On the basis of 
IGU comments that some of their regional estimates of 
reserves are extremely conservative, Gregory and Rogner 
(1998) suggest an optimistic estimate 
for ultimately 
recoverable reserves of 28 ZJ (5.4 ZJ reserves plus 22.6 ZJ 
additional reserves, including quantities to be discovered), 
using the same ratio of optimistic to pessimistic reserves as 
Masters et a l . (1994). 
In addition to conventional reserves, reviews of the literature 
indicate very substantial amounts of unconventional gas 
occurrences. Rogner (1996, 1997) estimated resources in place 
for coal-bed methane (CH^) of 10 ZJ, gas from fractured shale 
of 17 ZJ, tight formation gas of 7 ZJ, gas remaining i n s i t u after 
production of 5 ZJ, and clathrates at some 980 ZJ. The 
magnitude of these estimates is also confirmed in IPCC WGII 
SAR (Nakicenovic et a l . , 1996), which gives 6.9 ZJ 
unconventional gas as current reserves, and an additional 20 ZJ 
as recoverable with current or foreseeable improvements in 
technologies. The largest resource occurrence of all fossil fuels 
(even exceeding coal) is estimated to be methane clathrates. 
Also called hydrates, methane clathrates represent gas locked 
in frozen ice-like crystals that probably cover a significant 
proportion of the ocean floor and have been found in numerous 
locations in continental permafrost areas. Technologies to 
recover these resources economically could be developed in 
the future, if demand for natural gas continues to grow in the 
longer run, in which case gas resource availability would 
increase enormously. The implications of such developments 
are considered in some of the SRES scenarios. 
Coal reserves are different in character to oil and gas - coal 
occurs in seams, often covers large areas, and relatively limited 
exploration is required to provide a reasonable estimate of coal 
in place. Total coal in place is estimated at about 220-280 ZJ 
(WEC, 1995a; Rogner, 1996; 1997; Gregory and Rogner, 
1998). Of this total, about 22.9 ZJ are classified as recoverable 
reserves (WEC, 1995a; 1998), over 200 times current 
production levels. The question is the extent to which 
additional resources can be upgraded to reserves. WEC (1995a; 
1998) estimates additional recoverable reserves at about 80 ZJ, 
although it is not clear under what conditions these reserves 
would become economically attractive. Over 90% of their 
estimate of total reserves occur in just six countries, with 70% 
in the Russian Federation alone. Further coal resources are 
known to exist in various countries, some of which might be 
exploitable in the future, perhaps at high cost. However, in 
some countries the environmental damage from coal mining 
will prevent possible additional reserves being developed. In 
the IPCC w o n SAR, Nakicenovic et a l (1996) estimate that, 
in addition to today's reserves, a further 89 ZJ could, at least in 
principle, be mined with technological advances, a ligure in 
agreement with the WEC (1998) estimates. 
The picture for uranium and thorium reserves is different 
again. Current proved uranium reserves recoverable at less 
than US$130/kg amount to some 3.38 million tons (WEC, 
1998) or 2 ZJ in once-through fuel cycles. This extractable 
thermal energy would be some 60 times larger if reprocessing 
and fast breeder reactors are used (Ishitani and Johansson, 
1996). These reserves are sufficient to meet the needs of an 
expanded nuclear program well into the 2U' century, even 
without reprocessing and fast breeder 
reactors. The 
ultimately recoverable global natural uranium resource base 
is currently estimated at around 29 million tons, which 
con-esponds to 17 ZJ without reprocessing and about 1000 ZJ 
with reprocessing and fast breeder reactors (Nakicenovic et 
a i , 1996). Additionally, very limited exploration for new 
reserves has occuiTed in recent yeai-s because of the relative 
abundance of existing known reserves and the drop of real 
uranium prices from US$150/kg in 1980 to about US$30/kg 
in 1996. The exploration and development of uranium 
deposits today is probably on a par with that of the oil 
industry 100 years ago, while thorium occurrences have 
hardly been assessed. Uranium and thorium are minerals 
contained in deposits in the Earth's crust and their long-term 
availability will be determined by the same process 
dynamics, in terms of knowledge and technology advances, 
as for their hydrocarbon counterparts. Once new reserves are 
required, given the comparison with the oil industry over the 
past 100 years, the potential for exploration to yield major 
discoveries at acceptable cost is enormous. From the 
perspective of occurrence alone, uranium resources are 
already 
known to be 
immense, 
especially if low-
concentration sources such as seawater or granite rock are 
considered. In summary, the development of nuclear power 
throughout the 2P' century, even based only on once-through 
reactors, is unlikely to be constrained by uranium (or 
thorium) resource limitations.

(Nakicenovic e t a l . , 1996) and shown in Table 3-6. A summary 
of the literature of renewable resource development potentials 
consistent with IPCC WGII SAR, including a detailed regional 
breakdown, is given in Christiansson (1995) and Neij (1997). 
Hydropower cun'ently provides some of the cheapest electricity 
available in the world, although the potential for new capacity 
is limited in some regions. WEC (1994, 1995a) estimates the 
gross world potential for hydroelectric schemes at about 144 EJ 
per year, of which about 47 EJ per year is technically feasible 
for development, about 32 EJ per year is economically feasible 
at present, and about 8 EJ per year is currently in operation. 
IPCC WGII SAR (Nakicenovic e t a l , 1996) gives a comparable 
medium-teiTn potential of between 13 and 55 EJ, and a 
maximum technical potential above 130 EJ. 
Other important renewable energy resources are wind and 
solar, as well as modem forms of biomass use. Biomass 
resources 
a r e potentially the largest renewable global energy 
source, with an annual primary production of 220 billion oven 
dry tons (ODT) or 4500 EJ (Hall and Rosillo-Calle, 1998). 
The annual bioenergy potential is estimated to be in the order 
of 2900 EJ, of which 270 EJ could currently be considered 
available on a sustainable basis (Hall and Rosillo-Calle, 1998). 
Hall and Rao (1994) conclude that the biomass challenge is 
not one of availability but of the sustainable management, 
conversion, and delivery to the market place in the form of 
modem and affordable energy services. It is also important to 
distinguish between harvesting and deforestation; the fonner 
results in afforestation, and the latter in conversion of forest 
land for other uses, such as agriculture or urban development. 
The use of biomass as an energy source necessitates the use of 
land. Based on estimates by IIASA-WEC (1995), by 2100 
about 690-1350 million hectares of additional land would be 
needed to support future biomass energy requirements for a 
high-growth 
scenario. 
However, the additional land 
requirement for agriculture is estimated to reach 1700 million 
hectares during the same period. These land requirements can 
^ A l l estimates, excluding biomass, have been converted into thermal 
equivalents with an average factor of 38.5%. 
be fulfilled if the potential additiofial arable land is taken into 
account (at present this is mostly covered by forest). Hence, 
land-use conflicts could arise, and particularly for Asia which 
is projected to require its entire potential of arable land by 
2100. 
Africa and Latin America may have sufficient land to 
support an expanded biomass program. One estimate (WEC, 
1994) shows that Africa can support the production of biomass 
energy equivalent to 115% of its current energy consumption 
(8.6 EJ). 
Some authors stress that increased demand for bioenergy could 
compete with food production (Azar and Bemdes, 1999). They 
note that the competitiveness between food and bioenergy 
production is not realistic in most energy-economy models; 
rather it is treated in an a d hoc fashion with the assumption that 
enough land is secured for food production. In reality an 
increasing competitiveness of bioenergy plantations may cause 
food prices to jump. Some developing regions, in particular 
Africa, are often assumed in scenarios to become major 
importers of food (Azar and Bemdes, 1999). 
Unlike hydropower, most of the technologies that could 
harness these renewable energy fonns are in their infancy and 
are generally still high cost (although wind power is becoming 
increasingly competitive in some areas). Conversely, the 
potential for improvement in technical performance and costs 
is substantial. Thus, the future resource potential of these 
renewables is lai'gely determined by advances in technologies 
and economics (discussed in Section 3.4.4). 
Advances in renewable energy technologies could materialize 
to a significant extent even in the absence of climate policies, 
a l b e i t conventional wisdom holds that such policies could 
accelerate their dilfusion considerably. According to IPCC 
WGII SAR (Nakicenovic et a l , 1996), in the medium-term (to 
2025) the largest renewable energy potentials lie in the 
development of modem biomass (70 to 140 EJ), solar (16 to 22 
EJ), and wind energy (7 to 10 EJ) as indicated in Table 3-6. In 
the long term the maximum technical energy supply potential 
for renewable energy is evidently solar (>2,600 EJ), followed 
by biomass (>1,300EJ).

Comparatively few scenarios in the literature explicitly consider 
the inteiplay between resource availability and technological 
change, and hence the possibilities of wide-ranging alternative 
futures of fossil and renewable resource use. For fossil fuels, 
altemative resource development scenarios are described in 
Ausubel et a l . (1988), Edmonds and Barns (1992), 
IIASA-WEC (1995), Nakicenovic et a l . (1998a), and 
SchoUenberger (1998). For renewable energy resources, 
scenarios of enhanced resource development are described in 
Goldemberg et a l . (1988), Johansson et a l . (1993), Lazaras et 
a l . (1993). Watson e t a l . (1996), and Nakicenovic e t a l . (1998a). 
A critical issue in the context of this report is how to capture 
altemative future 1п1еф1ау8 between energy technology and 
resource development, in contrast to the more traditional 
approach of assuming fixed resource quantities across all 
scenarios. This is important because the literature reviewed 
above indicates that resource availability can vary widely. For 
instance, generally oil and gas are considered the most 
constrained fossil fuel resources. Yet, a representative range 
from the literature gives cumulative production levels between 
1990 and 2100 of between 21 and 65 ZJ, with typical 
intermediate scenarios of 30-35 ZJ (Nakicenovic et a l . , 1998a; 
SchoUenberger, 1998). The extreme values of cumulative 
resource use are evidently inversely related between different 
energy sources across the range of altemative scenarios. For 
instance, in scenarios with high availability of oil and gas, 
typically the use of coal or renewable resources is more limited, 
whereas in scenarios of rapid development of renewable 
alternatives, the use of fossil resources is more limited. In other 
words, future resource availability of fossil fuels as well as 
renewables is c o n s t r u c t e d in scenarios based on current 
understanding and the available literature. Resource availability 
results from altemative policies and strategies in exploration, 
R&D, investments, and the resultant resource development 
efforts. The long lead-times and enormous investments involved 
result in such strategies yielding a cumulative effect, refeiTcd to 
in the technological literature as "lock-in" (see Section 3.4.4). 
Development of alternatives can be furthered, but it can also be 
blocked when policies and investments favor existing resources 
and technologies. The most important long-term issue is how the 
transition away from easily accessible conventional oil (and to a 
lesser extent conventional gas) reserves will unfold. Will it lead 
to a massive development of coal in the absence of alternatives 
or, conversely, to a massive development of unconventional oil 
and gas? Alternatively, could the development of post-fossil 
alternatives make the recourse to coal and unconventional oil 
and gas (such as methane clathrates) obsolete?

The recent literature on long-term energy and emission 
scenarios increasingly emphasizes that both 
resource 
availability and technology are inteiTelated and inherently 
dynamic (see, e.g., IIASA-WEC, 1995; Watson et a l . 1996; 
Nakicenovic et a l . , 1998a). The state of the art of theories and 
models of technological change is reviewed in Section 3.4.5. 
The 
literature 
suggests that models 
of 
endogenous 
technological change are still in their infancy, and that no 
methodologies are established that reduce the substantial 
uncertainties with respect to direction and rates of change of 
future technology developments. Differences in opinions as to 
the likelihood and dynamics of change in future technologies 
will therefore persist. Such future uncertainries are best 
captured by adopting a scenario approach. The following 
discussion on changes in energy supply and end-use 
technologies therefore reviews the literature with emphasis on 
empirically observed historical and conjectured 
future 
changes. The principal message is that while the future is 
uncertain, the certainty is that future technologies will be 
different from those used today. Hence the most unlikely 
scenario of future development is that of stagnation, or absence 
of change.

T e c h n o l o g i e s 
Fossil-fueled power stations traditionally have been designed 
around steam turbines to convert heat into electricity. 
Conversion efficiencies of new power stations can exceed 40% 
(on a lower heating value basis - when the latent heat of steam 
from water in the fuel or the steam arising from the hydrogen 
content of the fuel has been excluded). New designs, such as 
supercritical designs that involve new materials to allow higher 
steam temperatures and pressures, enable efficiencies of close 
to 50%. In the long ran, further improvements might be 
expected. However, the past decade or so has seen the dramatic 
breakthrough of combined cycle gas turbines (CCGTs). The 
technology involves expanding very hot combustion gases 
through a gas turbine with the waste heat in the exhaust gases 
used to generate steam for a steam turbine. The gas turbine can 
withstand much higher inlet temperatures than a steam turbine, 
which produces considerable increases in overall efficiency. 
The latest designs currently under construction can achieve 
efficiencies of over 60%, a figure that has been rising by over 
1% per year for a decade. The low capital costs and high 
availability of CCGTs also make them highly desirable to 
power station operators. Gregory and Rogner (1998) estimate 
that maximum efficiencies of 71 to 73% are achievable within 
a reasonable period (on a lower heating basis; around 65 to 
68% on a higher heating basis). 
CCGTs can also be used with more difficult fuels, such as coal 
and biomass, by adding a gasifier to the front end to form an 
integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power station. 
The gases need to be hot cleaned prior to combustion to avoid 
energy losses and this is one of the key areas of development. 
The added benefit is that coal flue gas desulfurization (FGD) 
becomes unnecessary as sulfur is removed before the 
combustion stage. In addition to FGD and IGCC, fluidized bed 
combustion (FBC) technology facilitates sulfur abatement 
(adding limestone during combustion to retain sulfur) and 
1 3 8 
S c e n a r i o D r i v i n g F o r c e s 
allows the utilization of low quality fossil fuels because of the 
high sulfur retention capacity. However, FGD reduces overall 
conversion efficiencies (i.e., increases COj emissions). Also, 
both FGD and FBC sulfur abatement technologies use calcium 
carbonate to reduce emissions, which increases CO2 emissions 
because of CaO liberation from CaCOj capture. The use of 
high sulfur coals in FBC requires high limestone consumption, 
which results in increased C O ^ emissions. Only IGCC reduces 
SO2 
and C O T emissions, because of the higher power 
generation efficiency. 
Biomass is particularly suited to gasification. Stoll and Todd 
(1996) and Willerboer (1997) estimate that current designs for 
coal are around 9% less efficient than a standard CCGT 
burning gas. Developments to reduce heat losses through better 
heat recovery and by hot gas cleaning could potentially 
increase efficiency significantly in the next 10 to 15 years, and 
the technology can yield efficiencies of 51% now and perhaps 
65% in the longer run. 
The major potential competitor to CCGT technology is the fuel 
cell, which may be able to offer similar efficiencies at much 
lower plant sizes and so may be an ideal candidate for 
distributed combined heat and power generation. Another 
promising fuel cell application is vehicle propulsion. In 
contrast to other fossil-sourced electricity generation, fuel cells 
(similar to batteries) convert the chemical energy of fuels 
electrochemically (i.e., without combustion) into electricity 
and heat, and thus offer considerably higher conversion 
efficiencies than intemal combustion engines. In the past, high 
costs and durability problems have restricted their use to some 
highly specialized applications, such as electricity generation 
in space. Recent advances in fuel cell technology, however, 
have led to their commercial production and application in 
niche markets for distributed combined heat and power 
production (Penner et a l . , 1995). 
Although operating internally on hydrogen, fuel cells can be 
fueled with a hydrocarbon fuel, such as natural gas, methanol, 
gasoHne, or even coal. Before entering the fuel cells, these 
fuels would be converted on-site or on-board into hydrogen via 
steam reforming, partial oxidation, or gasification and 
hydrogen separation. In the longer ran and to make fuel cells 
truly zero-emission devices, non-fossil derived pure hydrogen, 
supplied and stored as compressed gas, cryogenic fiquid, metal 
hydrate, or other storage foiTn, could replace hydrocarbon 
fuels. Current fuel cell conversion efficiencies (45 to 50%) 
have yet to approach their potentials; some designs report 
efficiencies as high as 60% electrical efficiency in simple 
systems and 74% total efficiency in hybrid fuel cell and gas 
combined cycle systems (FETC, 1997). Hydrogen production 
efficiencies range from 65 to 85% for fossil-based systems, 55 
to 73% for biomass-based systems, and 80% to close to 90% 
for electrolysis (Ouellette e t a l . , 1995; Williams, 1998). 
Nuclear power is a proven technology that provides 17% of 
global electricity supply. There is currentiy no consensus 
concerning the future role of nuclear power. While it stagnates 
in Europe and North America, it continues as a strong option in 
a number of Asian countries and countries undergoing 
economic reform. Economics and security of supply are 
considerations in the choice of nuclear power, along with its 
environmental trade-offs - on a full energy chain basis, from 
mining to waste disposal and decommissioning, nuclear power 
emits littie GHG emissions. 
Public opinion is opposed to the use of nuclear power in many 
countries because of concems regarding operating safety, final 
disposal of high-level radioactive waste, and proliferation of 
weapon-grade fissile materials, as well as uranium mining and 
its environmental implications. These concerns, perceived or 
real, cannot be ignored if nuclear power is to regain the 
position of an accepted technology. In addition, changed 
market conditions call for new reactor technologies - smaller 
in 
scale, reduced construction periods, and improved 
economics with no compromise in safety. The industry is 
striving continuously to develop advanced reactor designs of 
much lower cost and with inherent safety concepts (i.e., 
designs that make safety less dependent on specifically 
activated technology components and human performance). 
The latest reactor technology already prevents the release of 
fission products 
or health-damaging 
radiation to 
the 
environment even under highly unlikely severe accident 
conditions. 
The 1998 update of the OECD cost comparison for power 
plants expected to be commercially available around 2005 
reports nuclear generating cost in the range 2.5 to 9.0 c/kWh 
(US cents per kilowatt-hour), depending on location, type of 
reactor, plant factor, plant life time, discount rate, and 
underlying 
fuel 
price 
escalation 
(OECD, 
1998c). 
Reconciliation of the assumptions of the OECD report with 
those used in the IPCC WGII SAR leads to an almost identical 
cost range of 2.9 to 5.4 c/kWh, at 5% discount rate, and 7.7 
c/kWh, at 10% discount rate (Ishitani and Johansson, 1996).

Since the birth of the modem wind power industry in the mid-
1970s, it has seen a continuous chain of innovations and cost 
reductions. Christiansson (1995) discusses a leaming curve 
that relates cost reductions to installed capacity. She notes that 
the experience curve for die USA indicates a progress ratio of 
0.84 (i.e., for each doubling of installed capacity, costs of new 
installations are reduced to 0.84 of the previous level). In the 
UK, 
developers have the opportunity to bid to supply 
renewable electricity to the grid under the Non-Fossil Fuel 
Obligation. In 1998, the average bid price for large wind power 
schemes was about 5 c/kWh, nearly 20% lower than in 1996 
(ENDS, 1998). The bids are made on a full commercial cost 
basis and they indicate that wind energy is cheaper than most 
of its competitors for new schemes in the U K for modest 
increments of capacity. (The exception is gas-powered CCGT 
generation.) However, wind, by nature, is intermittent and 
back-up capacity will be required as the proportion of 
electricity provided by wind increases, which reduces its 
S c e n a r i o D r i v i n g F o r c e s 
1 3 9 
economic attractiveness. Large integrated electricity systems 
and systems tiiat contain significant amounts of hydropower 
(especially with storage) are able to cope with the fluctuations 
in wind power best (Grubb and Meyer, 1993; Johansson et a l . , 
1993). 
Solar voltaic power is on a similar learning curve to wind, with 
progress ratios of 0.82 in the USA and 0.81 in Japan 
(Christiansson, 1995; Watanabe, 1997). Various altemative 
technologies are being developed and solar voltaics can be 
envisaged as providing electricity through large arrays of cells 
in central power generation, through arrays built into cladding 
or roofing on buildings, or through single arrays to meet 
specific puфoses. In this last form, solar cells have already 
established themselves as economic and reliable power sources 
in the provision of light, clean water, and improved health 
services to isolated rural communities (WEC, 
1994). Based on 
the principle of a leaming curve, solar cell costs are expected 
to fall as capacity builds. For example, the US Department of 
Energy projects costs to fall from 38-55 c/kWh in 1995 to 
3.5-5 c/kWh in 2030 (US DOE, 1994). For another system, 
WEC estimates costs to fall from 13-23 c/kWh in 1990 to 5-10 
c/kWh in 2020 (WEC, 
1994). 
Biomass, particularly wood, has been the main initial source of 
energy as countries develop and remains a substantial energy 
source in many developing countries (WEC, 
1994). In addition 
to this, byproducts of agriculture and forestry can be useful 
sources of energy. The extent to which biomass can contribute 
beyond this to provide energy crops for use in, say, power 
stations or for conversion into liquid fuels depends firstly on 
the competition for land with agriculture for food production. 
This, in tum, depends on improved productivity in food 
production, the amount and type of meat and other animal 
(e.g., dairy) products in the diet, and the growth in human 
population. The future contribution of biomass will also 
depend on increased productivity in biomass production 
coupled with limitations in energy input to grow, harvest, and 
use energy crops (Ishitani and Johansson, 1996; Leemans, 
1996). Current costs of biomass (for a eucalyptus plantation in 
Uruguay) are typically put at US$1.8/GJ with projected costs 
of US$1.4/GJ and productivity at 360GJAiectare per year 
(Shell Intemational Ltd.. 1996). Agricuhural productivity is 
also growing at 2% per year with the prospects of a similar 
productivity gain for energy crops (Shell Intemational Ltd., 
1996). WEC (1994) notes that Brazil has had a program to 
grow sugar cane to produce transport fuel since the mid 1970s 
and that production has reached 62% of the country's needs; 
this may be one option for wider use as the availability of 
conventional oil starts to fall. 
Finally, other forms of renewable energy, such as geothemial 
energy, tidal energy, wave energy, ocean thermal energy 
conversion, and solar thermal power plants, could make 
significant contributions at some stage in the future, as 
geothermal energy already does in specific markets. Also, 
technologies and processes that lead to carbon sequestration as 
a by-product include enhanced oil recovery using CO2 to 
improve the viscosity of crude oil or reforestation for reasons 
of soil preservation (Ishitani and Johansson, 1996).

The fuel effectiveness of all energy conversion processes that 
involve combustion, but also of fuel cells, can be raised 
substantially by combined heat and power generation. Utilities 
located in the vicinity of urban areas may divert the waste heat 
from combustion for residential or commercial heating puфoses. 
Industrial producers of high-temperature process heat may 
consider the generation of electricity when process temperature 
requirements are lower than the temperatures supplied. Combined 
heat and power production can accomplish fuel utilization rates of 
90% or more (Ishitani and Johansson, 1996). 
3.4.5. 
Understanding 
and M o d e l i n g 
Technological 
Change 
The future direction and rates of technological change are 
uncertain and therefore need to be explored when developing a 
r a n g e of altemative futures (i.e., scenarios). However, it would 
be misleading to resort to simplistic parametric variations of 
scenario assumptions without considering some basic elements 
of the nature of technological change, briefly reviewed here. 
Technological change has often been pictured in linear terms 
that involve several sequential steps: 
• 
Scientific discovery - an addition to biowledge. 
• 
Invention - a tested combination of already existing 
knowledge to a useful end. 
• 
Innovation - an initial and significant application of an 
invention. 
• 
Improvement 
of technology characteristics 
and 
reduction of costs. 
• 
Spread of an innovation, usually accompanied by 
improvement. 
However, this model places undue emphasis on the role of 
basic R & D and scientific knowledge as precursors and 
determinants of innovation. It also understates the role of 
interactions among different actors and between the five 
functions listed above. The emphasis in recent innovation 
literature is placed more on a "chain-link" model of innovation, 
exploiting interactions between firms' R&D departments, and 
various stages of production and marketing (Dosi, 1988; 
Freeman, 1994). Lane and Maxfield (1995) emphasize the role 
of "generative" relationships in creativity. 
Technological change is linked to the economic and cultural 
environment beyond the innovating firm in many ways, as 
described by Landes (1969), Mokyr (1990), Rosenberg (1982, 
1994, 1997), Rostow (1990), and Grübler (1998a). Innovations 
are highly context-specific; they emerge from local capabilities 
and needs, evolve from existing designs, and conform to 
1 4 0 
Scénario D r i v i n g F o r c e s 
standards imposed by complementary technologies and 
infrastructure. 
Successful 
innovations 
may 
spread 
geographically and also fulfill much broader functions. The 
classic example is the steam engine, developed as a means of 
pumping water out of deep mines in Cornwall, England, but to 
become the main source of industrial motive power and the key 
technology in the rail revolution worldwide. 
Numerous examples can be used to demonstrate the mossiness, 
or complexity, of innovation processes (e.g., Griibler, 1998a; 
Rosenberg, 1994). But even if the innovation process is messy, 
at least some general features or "stylized facts" can be 
identified (Dosi, 1988; Grübler, 1998a): 
• 
The process is fundamentally uncertain: outcomes 
cannot be predicted. 
• 
Innovation draws on underlying scientific or other 
knowledge. 
• 
Some kind of search or experimentation process is 
usually involved. 
• 
Many innovations depend on the exploitation of "tacit 
knowledge" obtained through "leaming by doing" or 
experience.

Technological change is a cumulative process and 
depends on the history of the individual or organization 
involved. 
These five features render some individuals, firms, or countries 
better at innovation than others. Innovators must be willing and 
able to take risks; have some level of underlying knowledge; 
have the means and resources to undertake a search process; 
may need relevant experience; and may need access to an 
existing body of technology. Many of these features introduce 
positive feedback into the innovation process, so that countries 
or firms that take the technological lead in a market or field can 
often retain that lead for a considerable tiine. 
Technological change may be supply driven, demand driven, or 
both (Griibler, 1998a). Some of the most radical innovations 
are designed to respond to the most pressing perceived needs. 
Many technologies have been developed during wartime to 
address 
resource 
constraints 
or 
military 
objectives. 
Alternatively, some innovation (e.g., television) is generated 
largely through curiosity or the desire of the innovator to meet 
a technical and intellectual challenge. Market forces (including 
those anticipated in the future) can act as a strong stimulus for 
innovation by firms and entrepreneurs aiming either to reduce 
costs or to gain market share. For example, Michaelis (1997a) 
shows the strong relationship between fuel prices and the rate 
of energy efficiency improvement in the aviation industry; 
Michaelis (1997b) also discusses the effects of the introduction 
of competition on the organizational efficiency of the British 
nuclear industry. 
All innovations requhe some social or behavioral change 
(OECD, 1998a). At a minimum, changes in production 
processes require some change in working practices. Product 
innovations, if they are noticeable by the user, demand a 
change in consumer behavior and sometimes in consumer 
preferences. Some product innovations - such as those that 
result in faster computers or more powerful cars - provide 
consumers with more of what they already want. Nevertheless, 
successful marketing may depend on consumer acceptance of 
the new technology. Other innovations - such as altemative 
fuel vehicles or compact fluorescent lights - depend on 
consumers accepting different performance characteristics or 
even redefining their preferences. An important perspective on 
technical change is that of the end-user or consumer of 
products and services. Technology can be seen as a means of 
satisfying human needs. Several conceptual models have been 
developed to describe needs and motivation, although their 
empirical foundations are weak (Douglas et a l . , 1998; Maslow, 
1954; Allardt, 1993). In many cases, a given technology helps 
to satisfy several different types of need, particularly evident in 
two of the most significant areas of energy use: cars and 
houses. This tendency of successful technologies to serve 
multiple needs contributes to lock-in by making it harder for 
competing innovations to replace them fully. Hence, many 
attempts to introduce new energy efficient or alternative fuel 
technologies, especially in the case of the car, have failed 
because of a failure to meet a l l the needs satisfied by the 
incumbent technology. Different individuals may interpret the 
same fundamental needs in different ways, in tenns of the 
technology attributes they desire (OECD, 1996). Deep-seated 
cultural values or "metarules" for behavior can be considered 
to be filtered through a variety of influences at the societal, 
community, household, and individual level (Douglas et al., 
1998; Strang, 1997). Commercial marketing of products 
usually aims to adjust the filters, and encourages people to 
associate their deep-seated values with specific product 
attributes (Wilhite, 1997). These associations are likely to be 
more flexible than the values themselves, and provide a 
potential source of future changes in technology choice. 
Technology diffusion is an integral part of technical change. 
Uptake of a technology that is locally "new" can be viewed as 
an innovation. Often, when technology is adopted it is also 
adapted in some way, or used in an original way. Just as 
technology development is much more complicated than the 
simple exploitation of scientific knowledge. Landes (1969), 
Wallace (1995), Rosenberg (1997), and others emphasize that 
technology diffusion is highly complex. Wallace emphasizes 
the importance of an active and creative absorption process in 
the country that takes up the new technology. The implication 
of this complexity is that no general rules define "what works." 
The process of technology adoption is as context dependent as 
that of the original innovation. Rosenberg (1997) also 
emphasizes the role of movements of skilled people in the 
diffusion of technology. Transnational firms often play a strong 
role in such movements. Other factors that influence the 
technology transfer process include differences in economic 
developmental, social and cultural processes, and national 
policies, such as protectionist measures. 
Grossman and Helpman (1991), Dosi et a l . (1990), and others 
have attempted to capture some of the complexities in "new 
S c e n a r i o D r i v i n g F o r c e s 
1 4 1 
growth" and "evolutionary" economic models. They have been 
able to demonstrate the flaws in some of the simpler solutions 
to technology diffusion often advocated - for example, they 
show how free trade might sometimes exacerbate existing gaps 
in institutions, skills, and technology. 
The complex interactions that underpin technology diffusion 
may give rise to regularities at an aggregate level. The 
geographical 
and 
spaflal 
distribution 
of 
successive 
technologies displays patterns similar to those found in the 
succession of biological species in ecosystems, and also in the 
succession of social institutions, cultures, myths, and 
languages. These processes have been analyzed, for example, 
in 
CampbeU (1959), 
Marchetfl 
(1980), 
Grübler 
and 
Nakicenovic (1991), and Grübler (1998a). An extensive review 
of the process of international technology diffusion is available 
in 
the IPCC Special Report on 
M e t h o d o l o g i c a l a n d 
T e c h n o l o g i c a l Issues 
i n T e c h n o l o g y 
Transfer 
(IPCC, 2000). 
That report provides a synthesis of the available knowledge and 
experience of the economic, social and institutional processes 
involved. 
Many attempts to endogenize technical change in economic 
models rely on a linear approach in which technical change is 
linked to the level of investment in R&D (e.g., Grossman and 
Helpman, 1991, 1993). More importantly, this linear model has 
been the basis of many governments' 
strategies for 
technological innovation. As mentioned above, important 
additional 
features 
of 
technological change 
include 
uncertainty, the reliance on sources of knowledge other than 
R&D, "leaming by doing" and other phenomena of "increasing 
returns" that often lead to technological "lock in" and hence 
great difficulties in introducing new alternatives. 
These features can be captured to some degree in models and a 
great deal of experimentation has taken place with different 
model specifications. However, the first feature, uncertainty, 
means that models cannot be used to predict the process of 
technical change. This uncertainty stems partly from lack of 
knowledge - the outcomes of cutting-edge empirical research 
simply cannot be predicted. It also stems from the complexity 
of the influences on technological change, and in particular the 
social and cultural influences that are extremely difficuh to 
describe in fomal models. Recent attempts to endogenize 
technical change in energy and economic models are reviewed 
by Azar (1996). Opfimizafion models usually treat technology 
development 
as exogenous, but technology d e p l o y m e n t 
as 
endogenous and driven by relative technology life-cycle costs. 
A few GHG emission projection models (e.g., Messner, 1997) 
were developed to incorporate "leaming by doing" - the 
reduction in technology costs and improvement in performance 
that can result from experience (Arrow, 1962). Models have 
also been developed that explicifly include technological 
uncertainty to analyze robust technology policy options (e.g., 
Grübler and Messner, 1996; Messner et a l , 1996). Other 
models developed more recently 1псофога1е the effects of 
investment in knowledge and R & D (Goulder and Mathai, 
1998). Economists and others who study technological change 
have developed models that take a variety of dynamics into 
account 
(Silverberg, 1988). Some 
models 
focus 
on 
technologies themselves, for example examining the various 
sources of "increasing returns to scale" and "lock-in" (Arthur, 
1989, 
1994). Other models focus on firms and other decision­
makers, and their processes of information assimilation, 
imitation, and leaming (Nelson and Winter, 1982; Silverberg, 
1988; 
Andersen, 1994). Few of these dynamics, apart from 
"increasing returns to scale," have been applied to the 
projection of GHG emissions from the energy sector. 
3.5. 
Agriculture and Land-Use Emissions 
3 . 5 . 1 . 
I n t r o d u c t i o n 
The most important categories of land-use emissions are C O ^ 
from net deforestation, CH^ from rice cultivation, CH^ from 
enteric fermentation of cattle, and N^0 from fertilizer 
application. These sources account for nearly all the land-use 
emissions of COj (Schimel et a l . , 1995), about 53% of the 
land-use emissions of CH4 (Prather, et a l , 1995), and about 
80% 
of land-use emissions of N p (Prather, et a i . 1995). 
These 
estimates, 
however, have 
a high 
uncertainty. 
Measurements and analyses of other sources of CH^ and N^O 
(notably biomass burning, landfills, animal waste, and sewage) 
ai-e relatively rare, but increasing (Bogner et a l . , 1997, in the 
literature. Of the scenarios reviewed for this report (see Table 
3.7), about 20 address emissions from agriculture and land-use 
change (Lashof and Tirpak, 1990; Houghton, 1991; Leggett et 
a l . , 1992; Matsuoka and Morita, 1994; Alcamo et a i , 1998; 
Alcamo and Kreileman, 1996; Leemans et a l , 1996). 
Current assessments of GHG emissions indicate that land use or 
land cover activities make an important contribution to the 
concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere;-' these are referreà to 
as "land-use emissions" in this report."* Of the tl-nee most 
important GHGs, the contribution of land-use emissions to total 
global COj is relatively small (23%), but it is very large for CH^ 
(74%) and N^0. Furthermore, although land-use emissions 
make up only a small percentage of global COj emissions, they 
comprise a large part (45%) of CO^ emissions from developing 
countries, and an even larger percentage of their total CH^ 
(78%) 
and 
N p 
(76%) 
emissions 
(Pepper 
et 
a l . , 1 9 9 2 ) . 
Hence, from a variety of perspectives, the 
contribution of land-use emissions to total emissions of GHGs 
is important, and consequently their future trends are relevant to 
the estimation of climate change and its mitigation. 
^ These activities include deforestation, afforestation, changes in 
agricultural management, and other anthropogenic land-use changes 
that result in a net flow of GHGs to or from the atmosphere. They 
exclude natural biogenic emissions and emissions that are not 
related to anthropogenic activity such as CO2 from volcanoes or 
volatile organic compounds from forests. 
We include deforestation in this category of emissions even though 
this is a process of land-cover change rather than a land-use activity.

Anthropogenic 
Land-Use 
Change 
A variety of changes in land use can result in anthropogenic 
COj emission or absorption. These changes most obviously 
include pemanent deforestation or afforestation. However, 
many changes in land-management practices also contribute to 
COj fluxes because of changes in standing biomass densities or 
in soil carbon. Empirical studies of such C O ^ fluxes are rare, so 
that information on current emissions is very poor. Whereas 
comprehensive information exists for forests globally, only a 
few 
countries have detailed information on forest and 
agricultural land-management 
practices. Hence, global 
estimates of COj emissions from anthropogenic land-use 
change, including those in the SRES, tend to be based entirely 
on net deforestation-afforestation and on average figures for 
carbon storage per hectare in forests. 
Emissions of COj from deforestation arise mostly from the 
burning of trees and other vegetafion in tropical forests cleared 
for 
agricultural use. These emissions also stem from the 
decomposifion of trees harvested for lumber, the buming of 
wood for fuel, and soil respiration. If harvested wood is 
replaced by new seedlings, it is normally assumed that the 
amount of CO-, released by decomposifion or buming is 
compensated by the COj taken up during growth of the 
seedlings and, therefore, that the net emissions of harvested 
trees is zero. Where net afforestation occurs, net emissions are 
taken to be negative (i.e. afforestation acts as a sink). 
As a consequence of inconsistencies in base-year estimates for 
net changes in forest biomass, emission estimates are 
normalized relative to their 1990 value before comparison with 
each other (Figure 3-14). Figure 3-14 also clearly depicts the 
relative change of emissions with time (Alcamo, et a i , 1995; 
Nakicenovic et a l . , 1998b). 
The scenarios of CO, emissions from land-use change have quite 
different temporal paths, and show their widest range before the 
middle of the 2P' century (Figure 3-14). Nearly all the scenarios 
then converge to very low emissions by the end of the century. At 
their widest point, the scenarios span about a factor of 14. 
The different sets of scenarios can be grouped into roughly two 
typical paths: One set declines smoothly after 1990, while the 
other sharply increases for a few decades after 1990. After the 
middle of the 2V- century most scenarios stabilize or continue 
to decline because either the driving forces of deforestation 
equilibrate or because forests are depleted. These processes are 
discussed further below. By 2100, COj scenarios of

deforestation range from zero to 30% of their base-year 
estimates. 
As emissions from deforestation are more significant in 
developing regions than industrial regions, few scenarios of 
COj from deforestation are available for industrial regions, so 
the focus here is on developing regions only. For Asia, 
emissions in all but one scenario (EPA-SCW, 7-1 in Table 3-7) 
steadily decline after the base year, and reach 25% or less of 
their 1990 value in 2100 (Figuie 3-14b). For Africa, emissions 
first increase before eventually decreasing in 2100 to a small 
fraction of their 1990 value (Figure 3-14c). In this scenario, 
deforestation rates decline in Asia and Africa because of the 
depletion of their forests. For Latin America, the wide range of 
scenarios reflects the wide range of views about its future rates 
of deforestation (Figure 3-14d). 
One of the main factors that affects estimates of COj from 
deforestation is the assumed deforestation rate, which is 
estimated by a wide variety of methods. For example, the 
IS92a-IS92f scenarios assume that deforested area is 
proportional to population, with a time lag of 25 years, and that 
deforestation continues until 25 years after the population 
stabilizes or until forests ai-e exhausted (Leggett et a l . , 1992). 
The 
IMAGE 2.1 emission estimates are based on computed 
changes in global land cover, which take into account changing 
demand for agricultural commodities. Trexler and Haugen 
(1995) compute the rate of tropical deforestation on a country-
by-country basis, and include information from questionnaires. 
Jepma (1995) uses a combination of three models (a socio-
economic model, a wood demand-supply model, and a land-
use model), while Palo et a l . (1997) correlate deforestation 
rates with income levels. To further confound this situation, the 
factors that affect deforestation vary greatly from place to 
place, and therefore need to be defined as locally as possible. 
Figure 3-15 presents population assumptions of various 
deforestation scenarios, together with the assumed or implied 
deforestation rates on a per capita basis. The shape of the 
emission curves (Fig. 3-14) follows the shape of the 
deforestation rate curves, rather than that of the population 
assumptions. However, the range of emissions is much larger

than the range of deforestation rates. Some conclusions can be 
drawn from these data: 
• 
When given on a per capita basis, the range of 
deforestation rates is perhaps not as great as expected 
(about a factor of eight) considering the wide range of 
assumptions and methods used to estimate these rates. 
• 
The temporal trend of emissions arises from the 
temporal trend of deforestation estimates. 
• 
The range of emissions is strongly, but not only, 
influenced by the deforestation rates, and at its widest 
(a factor 14) can be better explained by the combined 
range of per capita deforestation rates, population, and 
carbon density. 
The role that assumed carbon density of vegetation plays in the 
estimation of 
emissions must be considered. To estimate 
C O T emissions, i t is necessary to estimate the carbon density of 
vegetation that is burned and decayed when forests are cleared. 
However, there is wide disagreement in the titerature as to 
typical values of carbon density because of both the many 
methods used to measure density and the wide variation in the 
mix of tropical forest vegetation.

M e t h a n e Emissions 
f r o m Rice 
Production 
CH4 emissions from rice paddies are an important emission 
category, and are reviewed in more detail in Wassmann et al. 
(1993, 1997, 1998), Houghton et a l . (1995), and Olivier et a l 
(1996). СНд emissions are primarily a function of emission 
factors and assumed rice cropland area. In tum, emission 
factors depend on cultivation method (wet versus dry 
cultivation), water management practices, type of rice variety 
planted, and cropping pattems. Most long-term scenarios 
assume that the emission factor of CH^ per unit area of rice 
cropland remains constant with time, although estimates vary 
greatly from one scenario reference to another. 
The many approaches used to estimate the future extent of rice 
fields result in increases in the global area of rice fields from 
a factor of 0.8 to one of 1.8 by 2100 (see Alcamo and Swart, 
1998, for a brief review). One of the main factors to affect the 
future area of rice cropland is the assumed long-term 
improvement in rice productivity. The typical range of 
estimates for this variable is between 1.0 and 1.6% per year, 
depending on the region, time horizon, and reference. 
3 . 5 . 4 . 
M e t h a n e Emissions 
f r o m E n t e r i c F e r m e n t a t i o n 
Estimated emissions of CH^ from enteric fermentation depend 
on assumptions about emission factors per animal and the 
number of livestock. As summarized by IPCC (1995), emission 
factors vary greatly depending on the type of cow, their feed 
regime, and their productivity. Assumptions for the change in 
meat production from 1990 to 2100 in existing scenarios vary 
greatly, by a factor of 1.2 to 4.2. Despite the wide range of 
assumptions about meat production, emissions of the various 
scenarios do not vary by more than a factor of two, which 
indicates that other assumptions (e.g., animal productivity) 
must compensate for the differences in assumed meat 
production. 
As 
noted above, global estimates can mask significant 
differences in assumptions about industrial and developing 
regions. For industrial regions, neaiiy all scenarios assume a 
decline in beef production per capita, which is consistent with 
the current shift away from the consumption of beef to poultry 
and other protein sources. Meanwhile, the scenarios for 
developing countries assume a continuing increase in beef 
consumption, which grew by 3.1% per year between 1982 and 
1994, leading to an overall growth of 1.1% per year globally 
(Rosegrant et a l , 1997). 
Another factor that influences the future number of livestock is 
the change in animal productivity, that is, the weight of meat or 
dairy product per animal. The rate of increase in beef 
productivity dropped in industrial countries from 1.25% per 
year in 1967-1982 to 0.69% in 1982-1994, but increased from 
0.11 % per year to 0.61 % per year in the developing countries. 
Similar to emissions from rice fields, emissions from livestock 
are influenced not only by number of livestock (equivalent to 
S c e n a r i o D r i v i n g F o r c e s 
145 
the extent of rice ai'ea), but also by changes in the productivity 
of animals as these alter the CH^ emission factor. 
Some authors doubt that assumed increases in meat production 
and animal productivity can be sustained indefinitely. For 
example, Brown and Kane (1995) argue that livestock 
production cannot be increased greatly because nearly all of 
the world's suitable rangelands are intensively exploited 
already. They claim that the rapidly growing demand for meat 
and dairy products can only be met by livestock production in 
feedlots, which would result in a rising demand for feed that 
requires further development of agricultural land and further 
GHG emissions. 
3.5.5. 
N i t r o u s Oxide 
Emissions 
f r o m A g r i c u l t u r e 
budgets are associated with considerable uncertainties. 
Agricultural activities and animal production systems are the 
largest anthropogenic sources of these emissions. Recent 
calculations using IPCC 1996 revised guidelines indicate that 
emission from agriculture is 6.2 MtN as N^O per year 
(IPCC, 1996; Mosier et a l . , 1998). About one-third is related to 
direct emissions from the soil, another third is related to N^O 
emission from animal waste management, and the final third 
originates from indirect 
emissions through ammonia 
(NH3), nitrogen oxides (N0,,), and nitrate losses. This compares 
to earlier estimates of total anthropogenic emissions that range 
between 3.7 and 7.7 MtN (Houghton et a l . , 1995). Industrial 
sources contribute between 0.7 to 1.8 MtN (Houghton et a l . , 
1995; see also Chapter 5, Table 5-3 and Section 3.6.2). 
Total natural emissions amount to 9.0 ± 3.0 MtN as N2O, so 
oceans, tropical, and temperate soils are together the most 
important source of N2O today. Atmospheric concentrations of 
N2O in 1992 were 311 parts per billion ( 10') by volume (ppbv) 
(Houghton et a i , 1995); the 1993 rate of increase was 0.5 ppbv, 
somewhat lower than that in the previous decade of 
approximately 0.8 ppbv per year (Houghton et a l . , 1996). 
Among the anthropogenic sources, cultivated soils are the most 
important, contributing 50 to 70% of the anthropogenic total 
(see Chapter 5, Table 5-3). This source of N2O is particularly 
uncertain as the emission level is a complex function of soil 
type, soil humidity, species grown, amount and type of 
fertilizer applied, etc. The second largest anthropogenic source 
of N2O is industry; two processes account for the bulk of 
industrial emissions - nitric acid (HNO3) and adipic acid 
production. In both cases N2O is released with the off-gases 
from the production facilities. Recently, N2O release from 
animal manure was identified as another significant source of 
N , 0 emissions. 
N^O emissions from agricultural soils occur through the 
nitrification and denitrification of nitrogen in soils, particularly 
that from mineral or organic fertilizers. Emissions are very 
dependent on local management practices, fertilizer types, and 
climatic and soil conditions, and are calculated by multiplying 
an emission factor by the sum of mineral and organic nitrogen 
applied as fertilizer. The emission factor depends on the 
fertilizer type and local environmental circumstances, and 
those used in IPCC (1996) resuh in an assumed loss of 1.25% 
(range 0.25 to 2.25%) of nitrogen as N2O per year. 
To estimate the trend in fertilizer use, difterent references 
employ different approaches. For example, Leggett et a l . 
(1992) directiy estimate the amount of feitilizer used, whereas 
Alcamo et a l . (1996) back-calculate fertilizer use from the 
future amount of agricultural land. Despite these difterent 
approaches, estimates of future fertilizer use are quite 
consistently given as an increase by about a factor 1.4 to 2.8 
between 1990 and 2100. 
Although the different references are consistent in their 
findings about future global fertilizer use, the question arises 
whether these are at all reasonable guesses. Some researchers 
assume that fertilizer use will increase even more. For 
example, Kendall and Pimentel (1994) in their "business-as-
usual" scenario assume a 300% increase in the use of nitrogen 
and other fertilizers by 2050. Moreover, most studies of future 
worid food production assume improvements in crop yield. 
These yield improvements may imply higher overall rates of 
fertilizer use because many high-yielding crop varieties depend 
on large amounts of fertilizer. 
However, some authors question whether global average 
fertilizer use will grow. For example. Brown and Kane (1995) 
note that world fertilizer use has actually fallen in recent years 
and Kroeze (1993) assumes that per capita N2O emissions from 
fertilizer consumption decrease by 50% in 2100 relative to 1990 
tlnough policies that promote the more efficient use of synthetic 
fertilizers. Future fertilizer use may also be lower than in the 
"business-as-usual" scenarios because farmers have other 
incentives to reduce nitrogen fertilizer use, such as to reduce 
farming costs and avoid nitrate contamination of groundwater. 
This brief review of the literature on prognoses of fertilizer use 
indicates that the N ^ O emission scenarios depicted in Figure 3-
16 do not take into account the full range of views about future 
trends in fertilizer use. Additional uncertainty in future 
emissions occurs because changes in the number of livestock, 
as discussed above for CH^ emissions, and animal husbandry 
practices will also affect N2O emissions.

F i n d i n g s Regarding 
D r i v i n g 
Forces 
Herein, some of the many specific factors that affect scenarios 
of land-use emissions have been discussed. From a correlation 
analysis that compared the influence of changing population, 
economic activity, and technological change on land-use 
emission scenarios, Alcamo and Swart (1998) concluded that 
population was the most influential driving force. The reason is 
the relationship between population and increasing food 
demand, which leads to more cows that produce CH^ and more 
extensive fertilized croplands that release N ^ O . Although most 
1 4 6 
Scénario D r i v i n g F o r c e s 
scenarios also assume that improvements in crop and animal 
productivity will partly compensate for increasing food 
demand, some authors do not believe that productivity 
increases can be sustained. For example, Kendall and Pimentel 
(1994) show a decrease, rather than increase, in per capita grain 
production because of less optimistic assumptions about the 
increase in crop productivity (0.7% per year). Brown and Kane 
(1995) point out some developments that may slow down 
productivity: 
• 
The backlog of unused agricultural technology (and 
hence the potential for further agricultural productivity 
increases) is shrinking. 
• 
Demands for water are reducing the ability of the 
hydrologie cycle to supply irrigation water. 
• 
In many countries, the use of additional fertilizer on 
current crop varieties does not significantly increase 
their yields. 
• 
Industrial 
countries 
are 
losing fertile 
land 
to 
urbanization. 
Brown and Kane (1995) argue that in recent years rice yields 
have either stabilized or fallen in many key rice-producing 
countries, and suggest that dramatically boosting rice yields 
above a level of 4 tons per hectare may require new 
technological advances. If the skeptics are right, and the 
assumed productivity increases of the 
"business-as-usual" 
scenarios are not realized, then a greater expanse of cropland 
would be needed to satisfy the same agricultural demand. This 
expansion would lead to still higher emissions of CH^ from 
rice fields and livestock, and more rapid deforestation and 
earlier peaks in the emissions of COj. However, the lower 
increase in productivity probably also implies lower fertilizer 
use per hectare, which may lower emissions of 
from 
fertilized soils. 
3.5.7. 
Conclusions 
Some of the main findings regarding different categories of 
land-use emissions are outiine below.

Global scenaiios of C O 2 emissions 
f r o m d e f o r e s t a t i o n 
have 
their widest range around the middle of the 2P' century and 
converge on zero toward the end of the century. The eventual 
decrease in emissions computed by the scenarios results in part 
from the assumed slowing of agricultural land expansion in 
tropical regions. Another reason is some scenarios assume that 
forests will nearly disappear in Asia and Africa before or 
around the middle of the 2P' century. 
Most global scenarios of CH^ emissions 
f r o m r i c e c u l t i v a t i o n 
show an upward trend until the middle of the 2P' century and 
then stabilize. The global trend is chiefly influenced by 
estimates for Asia, where more than 80% of these emissions 
currently originate. Normalized global emissions range by a 
factor of three in the year 2100. The wide range has mostly to 
do with different estimates of the future rice cropland area, 
which is influenced largely by different assumptions about 
future rice productivity. 
All 
global scenarios 
of CH^ 
emissions 
f r o m 
e n t e r i c 
f e r m e n t a t i o n show an upward trend until the end of the 2P' 
century. The maximum range of normalized emissions is by a 
factor of 2.0 (which occurs in the year 2100), the smallest 
range of the four categories of emissions examined. Also, these 
emissions have the smallest range of current estimates in the 
literature, and the smallest range of base-year estimates in the 
scenarios. Most scenarios of emissions in industrial regions 
show a stabilizing or decreasing trend, because of the 
assumption that the number of livestock will continue to 
decline with decreasing demand for beef and increasing animal 
productivity. Meanwhile, the assumed economic development 
in the developing regions will stimulate demand for beef, 
which leads to an increase in livestock (despite improvements 
in animal productivity) and higher emissions. 
Most global scenarios show tliat N2O emissions from fertilized 
soils continue to increase up to the end of the 2P' century, and 
the range of estimates of normalized emissions in 2100 
exceeds a factor of two. 
Tliree of the four categories of emissions show increasing 
global trends up to the end of the 21st century. The exception 
is CO2 from deforestation (see above). Hence it is likely that 
land-use emissions will continue to contribute significantly to 
the build-up of GHGs in the atmosphere, especially to levels of 
CH4 and N2O. Studies of mitigation of climate change should 
take this into account and scenarios of land-use emissions 
should be included in these studies. 
Regarding regional scenarios, land-use emissions stabilize or 
decrease in industrial regions, and increase substantially in 
Africa, but less so in Asia. Emission trends in Latin America 
are between those of industrial and developing regions. These 
regional trends reflect the stabilizing demand for agricultural 
products and agricultural land in industrial countries, and the 
assumed continuation of agricultural development elsewhere. 
3.6 
Other Gas Emissions 
3 . 6 . 1 . 
Introduction 
Driving forces of emissions other than CO2 or those of 
agriculture or land-use changes are discussed here. The direct 
GHGs N2O and CH^ are discussed first, followed by the 
indirect GHGs, which include sulfur and the ozone precursors 
NO J,, CO, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Finally, the 
many various powerful GHGs, including ozone-depleting 
substances (ODS), are discussed. 
The sources and sinks for these gases continue to be highly 
uncertain. Littie research has been carried out to evaluate the 
influences of socio-economic and technological driving forces 
on long-term emission trends of these gases. As a rule, future 
emissions of these gases are included in long-term emission 
models on the basis of simple relationships to aggregate 
economic or sector-specific activity drivers, not least because 
individual source strengths continue to be highly uncertain. 
Notable exceptions are emissions of sulfur and ODS, which 
have been more intensively studied in connection with non-
climate policy analysis in the domains of regional acidification 
and stratospheric ozone depletion. 
3.6.2. 
Nitrous 
Oxide 
Natural and agricultural soils are the dominant sources of N2O 
emissions, so future emission levels are governed by the land-
use changes and changes in agricultural output and practices 
discussed in Section 3.5.2. Nevertheless, other sources ai'c also 
important and are discussed here. 
The dominant industrial sources are the production of HNO3 
and adipic acid. The key driver for the production of HNO3 is 
the demand for fertilizer. Hence this emission source is closely 
related to the agricultural production driving forces discussed 
in Section 3.5, as well as to improvements in production 
technologies. Adipic acid, (CH2)4(COOH)2, is a feedstock for 
nylon production and one of the largest-volume synthetic 
chemicals produced in the world each year - current annual 
global production is 1.8 million metric tons (Stevens III, 1993). 
Production has an associated by-product of 0.3 kg N,OAg 
adipic acid for unabated emission, which at present results in a 
global emission of about 0.4 MtN as N2O annually. Emissions 
mostly arise in the OECD countries, which accounted for some 
95% 
of global adipic acid production in 1990 (Davis and 
Kemp, 1991). Fenhann (2000) reviews the (spai'se) scenario 
literature and concludes that future emissions will be 
determined mostiy by two variables - demand growth as a 
result of growth in economic activity and progressively 
phased-in emission controls. 
By the early 1990s, it was estimated that about one-third of 
OECD emissions had been abated (Stevens III, 1993). This 
abatement is an accidental result of the treatment of flue-gases 
in a reductive furnace (thermal destruction) to reduce N0^ 
1 4 8 
S c e n a r i o D r i v i n g 
Forces 
emissions, wliicli coincidentally also converts about 99% of the 
into nitrogen gas (N,). In other regions only about 20% of 
emissions had been abated by the early 1990s. 
Major adipic acid producers worldwide have agreed to 
substantially reduce NjO emissions by 1996 to 1998. In July 
1991 they formed an inter-industry group to share information 
on old and new technologies developed for N^O abatement, 
such as improved thermal destruction, conversion into nitric 
oxide for recycling, and the promising low-temperature 
catalytic decomposition into N2 currently being developed by 
DuPont. The introduction of all three technologies could result 
in a 99% reduction of N.,0 emissions from adipic acid 
production (Storey, 1996). They are expected to be introduced 
at plants owned by Asahi (Japan), BASF and Bayer (Germany), 
DuPont (US), and Rhône-Poulenc (France) { C h e m i c a l 
Week, 
1994). After the planned changes, US producers will have 
abated over 90% of the N2O emissions from adipic acid 
production. In recent years nylon-6.6 production dropped in the 
US, Western Europe, and Japan, largely in response to capacity 
and production in other Asian countries. By 2000 production is 
expected to recover in these countries (Storey, 1996). 
Another major source of N2O is the transport sector. Gasoline 
vehicles without catalytic converters have very low, sometimes 
immeasurably small, emissions of N2O. However, vehicles 
equipped with three-way catalytic converters have N2O 
emissions that range from 0.01 to 0.1 g/km in new catalysts, 
and from 0.16 to 0.22 g/km in aging catalysts (IPCC, 1996). 
Emission levels also depend on precise engine running 
conditions. At the upper end of the emission range from aging 
catalysts, N2O emissions contribute around 25% of the in-use 
global warming impact of driving (Michaelis et a l , 1996). 
The introduction of catalytic converters as a pollution control 
measure in the majority of industrialized countries is resulting 
in a substantial increase in N , 0 emissions from gasoline 
vehicles. Several Annex I countries include projections of N^O 
from this source in their national communications to the 
UNFCCC, using a variety of projection methods (for example, 
Environment Canada, 1997; UNFCCC, 1997; VROM, 1997). 
The projections from these counties differ substantially in the 
contribution that transport is expected to make to their national 
N2O emissions in 2020, ranging from about 10% in France to 
over 25% in Canada. They anticipate that mitigation measures 
will be much more effective in reducing industrial and 
agricultural emissions of N2O than mobile source emissions. 
Indeed, little research has been cartied out to identify catalytic 
converter technologies that result in lower NjO emissions. 
However, emissions are likely to be lower in countries that 
require regular emission inspections and replacement of faulty 
pollution control equipment. 
3 . 6 . 3 . 
M e t h a n e 
Agricultural and land-use change emission drivers are 
discussed in Section 3.5.2. The other major sources are from 
the use of fossil fuels and the disposal of waste, for which the 
driving forces are briefly reviewed here. The earlier literature 
is reviewed in В ames and Edmonds (1990). A more detailed 
recent literature review is given in Gregory (1998). 
Emissions from the extraction, processing, and use of fossil 
fuels will be driven by future fossil fuel use. CH^ emissions 
from venting during oil and gas production may decrease 
because of efforts to reduce them (IGU, 1997b). Flaring and 
venting volumes from oil and gas operations peaked in 1976 to 
1978, but a gradual reduction in volumes of gas flared and 
vented has occurred over the past 20 years (Boden et a l . , 1994, 
Marland et a i , 1998; Stem and Kaufmann, 1998). Shell 
Intemational Ltd. (1998) estimated a reduction in its own 
emissions from venting by 1 MtCH^ per year to 0.367 MtCH^ 
in the ñve years to 1997. The l E A Greenhouse Gases R&D 
Programme (1997) notes that emission reductions from the oil 
and gas sector would yield a high economic return. 
Additionally, new natural gas developments generally use the 
latest technology and are almost leak free compared to older 
systems. Taking all these factors into account, it seems plausible 
that CH4 emissions from the oil and gas sector should fall as the 
2U' century progresses. Nonetheless, the primary driver (oil and 
gas production) is likely to expand significantly in the future, 
depending on resource availability and technological change. A 
representative range from the literature, for example the 
scenarios described in Nakicenovic et a l . (1998a), indicates 
substantial uncertainty in which future levels of oil and gas 
production could range between 130 and some 900 EJ. 
Assuming a constant emission factor, future CH^ emissions 
from oil and gas could range from a decline compared to 
current levels to a fourfold increase. With the more likely 
assumption of declining emission factors, future emission levels 
would be somewhat lower than suggested by this range. 
The concentrations of CH^ in coal seams are low close to the 
surface, and hence emissions from surface mining are also low 
(lEA CIAB, 1992). Concentrations at a few hundred meters or 
deeper can be more significant; releases from these depths are 
normally associated with underground mining. Emissions per 
ton of coal mined can vary widely both from country to country 
and at adjacent mines within a country (lEA Greenhouse Gases 
R&D Programme, 1996a). CH^ mixed with air in the right 
proportions is an explosive mixture and a danger to miners. 
Measures to capture and drain the CH4 are common in many 
countries - the captured CH^, if of adequate concentration, can 
be a valuable energy source. The techniques currently used 
reduce total emissions by about 10%. Many older, deeper coal 
mines in Europe are being closed, which will reduce emissions. 
Replacement coal mines tend to be in exporting countries with 
low cost reserves near the surface, so the emissions will be low. 
For the future, emissions will depend principally on the 
proportion of coal production from deep mines and on total 
coal production. 
A representative range of future coal production scenarios 
given in Nakicenovic et a l . (1998a) indicates a very wide range 
of uncertainty. Future coal production levels could range 
Scénario D r i v i n g F o r c e s 
1 4 9 
anywhere from 14 to well over 700 EJ, between a sevenfold 
decrease to an eightfold increase compared to 1990 levels. 
Conversely, CH^ capture, either during mining or prior to 
mining, not only reduces risk to miners but also provides a 
valuable energy source. Thus, rising levels of CH^ capture for 
non-climate reasons are likely to characterize the 2P' century. 
This would in particular apply to high coal production 
scenarios, in which most of the coal will need to come from 
deep mining once the easily accessible surface mine deposits 
have become exhausted. Growth in future emissions from coal 
mining is therefore likely to be substantially lower than growth 
in coal production. 
Domestic and some industrial wastes contain organic matter 
that emits a combination of CO, and CH_j on decomposition 
(TEA Greenhouse Gases R&D Programme, 1996b). If oxygen 
is present, most of the waste degrades by aerobic micro-
organisms and the main product is C O ^ . If no oxygen is 
present, different micro-organisms become active and a 
mixture of CO^ and CH^ is produced. Decay by this 
mechanism can take months or even years (US EPA, 1994). 
Traditionally, waste has been dumped in open pits and this is 
still the main practice in most developing countries. Thus, 
oxygen is present and the main decay product is C O ^ . In recent 
decades, health and local environmental concerns in developed 
countries have resulted in better waste management, with lined 
pits and a cap of clay, for example, added regularly over newer 
dumps. This prevents fresh supplies of oxygen becoming 
available so the subsequent decay process is anaerobic and CH^ 
is produced. Williams (1993) notes that landfill sites are 
complex and highly variable biologic systems and many 
factors can lead to a wide variability in CH^ production. For the 
future, increasing wealth and urbanization in developing 
countries may lead to more managed landfill sites and to more 
CH4 production. However, the CH^ produced can be captured 
and utilized as a valuable energy source, or at least flared for 
pollution and safety reasons; indeed, this is a legal requirement 
in the USA for large landfills. Future emissions are therefore 
unlikely to evolve linearly with population growth and waste 
generation, but the scenario literature is extremely sparse on 
this subject - the major source remains the previous IS92 
scenario series (Pepper et a l . , 1992). 
Different methods are used to treat domestic sewage, some of 
which involve anaerobic decomposition and the production of 
СЩ. Again, capture and use of some of the CH^ produced 
limits emissions. For the future, emissions will depend on the 
extension of sewage treatment in developing countries, the 
extent to which the techniques used enhance or limit CH^ 
production, and the extent to which the CH^ produced is 
captured and used. 
Several authors, including Rudd et a l . (1993) and Fearnside 
(1995) , note that some hydroelectric schemes resuh in 
emissions of CH^ from decaying vegetation trapped by water 
as the dams fill; these emissions climatically exceed those of a 
thennopower plant delivering the same electricity. Rosa et a l . 
(1996) , Rosa and Schaffer (1994), and Gagnon and van de Vate 
(1997) point out that the two schemes discussed by Rudd et a l . 
(1993) and Fearnside (1995) may be exceptional, with very 
large reservoir surface areas, a high density of organic matter, 
and low power output. Gagnon and van de Vate (1997) estimate 
the combined CH^ and NjO emissions from hydroelectric 
schemes at 5.5 gC equivalent per kWh compared to a range of 
80 to 200 gC equivalent per kWh for a modern fossil power 
station (Rogner and Khan, 1998); that is, hydroelectric power 
emits less than 3% and 7%, respectively. While some G H G 
emissions from new hydroelectric schemes are expected in the 
future, especially in tropical settings (Galy-Lacaux et a l . , 
1999), in the absence of more comprehensive field data, such 
schemes are regarded as a lower source of CH^ emissions 
compared to those of other energy sector or agricultural 
activities. Hydroelectric power is therefore not treated as a 
separate emission category in SRES. 
In summary, numerous factors could lead to increases in 
emissions of CH^ in the future, primarily related to the 
expansion of agricultural production and greater fossil fuel use. 
Recent studies also identify a number of processes and trends 
that could reduce CH^ emission factors and hence may lead to 
reduced emissions in the future. These trends are not yet 
sufficiently accounted for in the literature, in which CH^ 
emission factors typically are held constant. The overall 
consequence is to introduce additional uncertainty into 
projections, as the future evolution of such emission factors is 
unclear. However, from the above discussion, the least likely 
future is one of constant emission factors and the range of 
future emissions is likely to be lower than those projected in 
previous scenarios with comparable growth in primary activity 
drivers. 
3 . 6 . 4 . 
Sulfur 
D i o x i d e 
Two major sets of driving forces influence future SOj 
emissions: 
• 
Level and structure of energy supply and end-use, and 
(to a lesser extent) levels of industrial output and 
process mix. 
• 
The degree of SOj-control policy intervention assumed 
(i.e., level of environmental policies implemented to 
limit SO2 emissions). 
Grübler (1998c) reviewed the literature and empirical 
evidence, and showed that both clusters of driving forces are 
linked to the level of economic development. With increasing 
affluence, energy use per capita rises and its structure changes 
away from traditional solid fuels (coal, lignite, peat, fuelwood) 
toward cleaner fuels (gas or electricity) at the point of end-use. 
This structural shift combined with the greater emphasis on 
urban air quality that accompanies rising incomes results in a 
roughly inverted U (lU) pattern of SOj emissions and/or 
concentrations. Emissions rise initially (with growing per 
capita energy use), pass through a maximum, and decline at 
higher income levels due to structural change in the end-use 
1 5 0 
S c e n a r i o D r i v i n g F o r c e s 
fuel mix and also control measures for large point sources. This 
pattern emerges also from the literature on environmental 
Kuznets curves (e.g., World Bank, 1992; IIASA-WEC, 1995) 
and is corroborated by both longitudinal and cross-sectional 
empirical data reviewed in detail in Grübler (1998c). 
Historically, the decline in sulfur pollution levels was achieved 
simply by dispersion of pollutants (tall stacks policy). 
Subsequently, the actual emissions also started to decline, as a 
result of both structural change (substitution of solids by gas 
and electricity as end-use fuels) and sulfur reduction measures 
(oil 
product desulfurization and scrubbing of large point 
sources). 
Emissions for 1990 reported in the scenarios reviewed in 
Chapter 2 and in Grübler (1998c) indicate a range from 55 to 
91 MtS. The upper range is explained largely by a lack of 
complete coverage of SO2 emission sources in long-term 
scenario studies and models. Lower values coirespond to 
studies drat include only the dominant energy sector emissions 
(range of 59.7 to 65.4 MtS), and higher estimates also include 
other sources, most notably metallurgical and from biomass 
burning. None of the long-term scenario studies appears to 
include SO2 emissions from intemational bunker (shipping) 
fuels, estimated at 3 + 1 MtS in 1990 (Olivier et a l . , 1996; 
Corbett et a l , 1999; Smith et a i , 2000). Historical global 
sulfur emissions estimates are given in Dignon and Hameed 
(1989). 
Grübler (1998c) also argues that SO2 control and intervention 
policies in many rapidly industrializing countries (particularly 
those with high population densities) are highly likely to be 
phased in more quickly than the historical experience of 
Europe, North America, Japan, or Korea. This analysis is 
supported by existing policies and trends in Brazil, China, and 
India (Shukla et a l . , 1999; Rosa and Schechtman, 1996; Qian 
and Zhang, 1998). Most recent SO2 emission inventory data 
suggest that since 1990 SO2 emission growth has significantly 
slowed in East Asia compared to earlier forecasts, in response 
to the first SOj control measures implemented in China, South 
Korea and Thailand (Streets and Waldhoff 2000). Dadi et a l . 
(1998) estimate that in 1995 about 11% (1.5 MtS of a total of 
13.5 MtS gross emissions) of China's SO2 emissions were 
removed through various control measures. 
The evaluation of the IS92 scenarios (Alcamo et a l , 1995) 
concluded that the projected SOj emissions in the IS92 
scenarios do not reflect recent changes in sulfur-related 
environmental legislation, in particular the amendments to the 
Clean Air Act in the USA, and the Second European Sulfur 
Protocol. Increasingly, many developing countries are adopting 
sulfur control legislation that ranges from reduction of sulfur 
contents in oil products (e.g. China, Thailand, and India; see 
Streets et a l . , 2000), through a maximum sulfur content in coal 
(e.g. in China; see Streets and Waldhoff, 2000), to SO2 controls 
at coal-fired power plants (e.g. China, South Korea, Thailand; 
for a review see lEA, 1999). For instance, an estimated 3575 
M W 
of coal-fired electricity China is generated by plants 
already equipped with sulfur control devices (lEA, 1999). 
Since publication of the IS92 scenarios a number of important 
new sulfur impact studies have become available, and analyzed 
in particular: 
• 
Implications of acidic deposition levels of high SOj 
emissions scenarios such as IS92a (Amann et a l . , 1995; 
Posch e t a l , 1996). 
• 
Aggregate ecosystems impacts, especially whether 
critical loads for acidification are exceeded given 
deposition levels and different buffering capacities of 
soils (Amann et a l . , 1995; Posch et a l , 1996). 
• 
Direct vegetation damage, particularly on food crops 
(Fischer and Rosenzweig, 1996). 
These studies provide further infomation on the impacts of 
high concentrations and deposition of SO2 emissions, beyond 
the well-documented impacts on human health, ecosystems 
productivity, and material damages (for reviews see Cratzen 
and Graedel, 1986; WHO and UNEP, 1993; WMO, 1997). 
These studies are particularly important because they 
document environmental changes of high-emission scenarios 
by using detailed representations of the numerous non-linear 
dose-response relationships between emissions, atmospheric 
concentrations, deposition, ecosystems sensitivity thresholds, 
and impacts. All recent studies agree that unabated high SOj 
emissions along the Hues of IS92a or even above would yield 
high impacts not only for natural ecosystems and forests, but 
also for economically important food crops and human health, 
especially in Asia where emissions growth is projected to be 
particularly high. 
A representative result (based on Amann et a l , 1995) is shown 
in Figure 3-17, which contrasts 1990 European sulfur 
deposition levels with those of Asia by 2050 in a high SO2 
emission scenario (very close to IS 92a). Typically, in such 
scenarios, SO, emissions in Asia alone could surpass current 
global levels as early as 2020 (Amann et a l , 1995; Posch et a l , 
1996). Sulfur deposition above 5 g/m^ per year occurred in 
Europe in 1990 in the area of the borders of the Czech 
Republic, Poland, and Germany (the former GDR), often 
referred to as the "black triangle." In view of its ecological 
impacts it was officially designated by UNEP as an "ecological 
disaster zone." In a scenario such as IS92a (or even higher 
emissions), similar high sulfur deposition would occur by 
around 2020 over more than half of Eastern China, large parts 
of southern Korea, and some smaller parts of Thailand and 
southern Japan. 
Fischer and Rosenzweig (1996) assessed the combined impacts 
of climate change and acidification of agricultural crops in 
Asia for such a scenario. Their overall conclusion was that the 
projected likely regional climate change would largely benefit 
agricultural output in China, whereas it would lower 
agricultural productivity on the Indian subcontinent (the 
combined effect of projected temperature and precipitation 
changes would have differential impacts across various crops 
and subrogions). However, projected high levels of acidic 
deposition in China would reduce agricultural output to an

extent that would more than offset any possible beneficial 
impacts of regional climate change. This is primarily because 
sulfur (and nitrogen) deposition, while acting as fertilizer for 
plant growth at lower deposition levels, negatively affects plant 
growth at higher deposition levels. Projections in a scenario 
such as IS92a are that the threshold levels will be surpassed 
between 2020 and 2050 for all major Asian food crops. 
The review of recent literature on acidification impact studies 
given in Grubler (1998c) concludes that the impacts on human 
health, on economically important food crops, and on 
ecosystems are so substantial as to lender any scenario with 
SOj emissions as high as, or higher than, IS92a very unlikely. 
Grübler (1998c) canied out a detailed comparison of SOj 
emissions scenarios at the global and regional level. He 
concluded that the range of future SOj emissions spanned by 
the previous high-demand IPCC scenarios (all IS92 scenarios 
except IS92c and IS92d) corresponded well with scenarios 
available in the literature that do not include any direct sulfur-
emissions control or indirect intervention measures and policies 
(Figure 3-18). Typically, in such scenarios, global SOj 
emissions could rise to between 130 and 250 MtS by 2100, and 
in some older scenarios (Matsuoka et a l . , 1994; Morita et a l . . 
199A) 
are projected to rise above that level. Interestingly, all 
long-term sulfur scenarios published since 1995 do not judge 
this to be a likely (not to mention environmentally desirable) 
possibility. Representative 
sulfur-emissions control and 
intervention scenarios (Amann et a l . , 1995; Posch et a l . , 1996; 
Nakicenovic et a h , 1998a) suggest instead an upper range of 
global emissions below 100 MtS by 2050 and below 120 MtS by 
2100, a range covered in the two low variants IS92c and IS92d 
only. These patterns were also confiimed by Pepper et a l . (1998) 
in a recent re-analysis of the previous IS92 scenarios. Using the 
same methodology as deployed in developing the IS92 
scenarios, the revised scenarios have maximum global SO, 
emissions below 142 MtS by 2020, and 56 MtS by 2100 (EPA3 
and EPA5 scenarios, respectively). The median from the more 
recent scenario hterature analyzed in Grübler (1998c) indicates 
near-constant global SO2 emissions - 77 MtS by 2020, 68 MtS 
by 2060, and 57 MtS by 2100. This global stability, however, 
masks decisive regional differences 
(discussed 
above). 
Emissions in the OECD countries will continue their declining 
trends in line with their sulfur reduction policies. Emissions 
outside OECD will rise initially with increasing energy demand, 
but sulfur controls will be progressively phased in to mitigate 
against impacts of high unabated SO, emissions on health, 
agriculture, ecosystems, and tourism. 
The need to abate local air pollution, including SO, emissions, 
is not only environmental, but also economic. For example, 
according to the World Bank (1997c, I997d) the current 
damage by environmental pollution is about 8% of GDP in 
China (and up to 20% of production in urban areas), while 
abatement costs would be between I and 2.5% of GDP. 
According to one World Bank (1997c) report, the costs are '"so 
high under the business-as-usual scenario that it is hardly 
necessary to consider the amenity and ecosystem benefits of 
cleaner air to justify action." Therefore, it is no surprise that in 
several developing regions, policies are already being 
developed and implemented to abate SOj emissions, in China, 
by 1995 coal-cleaning technology had been developed, and 
de-sulfurizing 
technology 
introduced 
and 
applied 
(Government of People's Republic of China, 1996). The SO2 
emissions target set by the Chinese government is 12.3 MtS by 
2000 as compared to 11.9 MtS in 1995. Economic 
instruments, such as pollution charges, pricing policy, 
favorable terms of investment for environmental technology, 
market creation, and ecological compensation fees, are being 
introduced in China now (UNEP, 1999). By June 1997, some 
64,000 enteфrises with heavy pollutant emissions had been 
closed for refurbishment or had ceased production. As a 
consequence, ambient concentrations of sulfur have been 
relatively stable in medium-size and small cities, and they 
have actually decreased in large cities. This change is 
occurring at significantly lower levels of income as compared 
to income levels in the USA and Europe at the time when their 
sulfur abatement started. 
In India, several sulfur policies are being introduced currently, 
including mandatory washing of coal used 500 km away from 
the mine mouth, a policy that is expected to significantly 
152 
S c e n a r i o D r i v i n g F o r c e s 
reduce SO2 emissions from coal use. Some refineries have 
already advertised their investments (and efforts) to meet this 
standard. In a landmark case on the Taj trapezium (a 10,400 
km- area surrounding the Taj Mahal), the Supreme Court of 
India has ordered a limit on the sulfur content of diesel sold in 
this area to within 0.25% (Shukla, personal communication). 
The Indian govemment has spent US$1.34 billion to reduce the 
sulfur content in diesel from 1% to 0.25% by weight (Mr. K.P. 
Shahi, Advisor to the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, 
as quoted in D o w n t o E a r t h , February 15, 1999, page 15). 
These policies already have had an effect on emissions. Streets 
et a l . (2000) analyzed the impact since 1990 of these policies 
and new energy and emissions factor data on emissions in 
Asia.^ They found that emissions may have increased in Asia 
from 16.9 MtS in 1990 to only 19.3 MtS in 1995, rather than 
to the 26.7 MtS projected in the earlier studies with the 
RAINS-ASIA model. The authors conclude that SOj emissions 
in Asia have not grown nearly as fast as was thought likely in 
the early 1990s, with major implications for projections 
beyond the year 2000. It is probable that the emissions 
trajectory will be even lower as a result of increasing 
environmental awareness in many countries of Southeast Asia 
and East Asia, the implementation of China's "two-control-
zone" policy, and the downtum of Southeast Asia economies in 
the late 1990s (Streets et a l , 2000). 
In Latin America, the contribution of coal-fired power plants to 
total power generation is relatively low and consequently SO2 
emissions are lower than those in other regions. This 
contribution is not expected to increase significantly in the 
^ East Asia including China, Southeast Asia, and the Indian 
subcontinent 
future. It is expected that the rate of increase of SOj emissions 
in Latin America will be reduced because environmental 
agencies in several Latin American countries are already 
enforcing strict SOj emissions standards. Also, increases in 
power generation are expected to be mainly from combined 
cycle natural gas plants (La Rovere and Americano, 1998). 
Different methodologies have been developed to assess the 
sulfur control scenarios in integrated assessment models. 
Griibler (1998c) has summarized the literature, and classifies 
three main modeling approaches: 
• 
Ecological targets, and analysis of events when critical 
acidification loads are exceeded (e.g., Amann et a l . , 
1995; Foell et a l , 1995; Hettelingh et a l , 1995; Posch 
et a l , 1996; Nakicenovic et a l , 1997). 
• 
The pollutant burden approach (e.g., Alcamo et a l , 
m i ) . 
• 
Income driven approaches (e.g.. Smith et a l , 2000). 
Although models differ in their analytical representation of the 
driving forces of sulfur reduction policies and also provide a 
range of possible futures, invariably all scenarios yield 
comparatively low future SOj emissions. Alcamo et a l . (1997) 
estimates a 95% probability that global SOj emissions will be 
below 120 MtS by 2050 and decline thereafter. Their 50% 
probability level suggests emissions of 90 MtS by 2050 and 57 
MtS by 2100, the latter being identical to the median from the 
scenario literature analyzed in Chapter 2. 
Increasingly, energy sector and integrated assessment models 
are able to link regional acidification models with simplified 
climate models, which enables joint analysis of sulfur and 
climate policies and impacts. Examples include the IMAGE 
model (Posch et a l , 1996) and the IIASA model (Rogner and 
Figure 3-18: Range of future sulfur dioxide emission scenarios, in MtS. Note in particular the much lower emission range of 
post-1995 sulfur dioxide emissions control and intervention scenarios compared with the earlier high-growth IS92a, b, e, and f 
scenarios. Source: Griibler, 1998c.

Nakicenovic, 1996; McDonald, 1999; Riahi and RoeM, 2000), 
which are linked with the acidification model RAINS for 
Europe and Asia, or the AIM (Morita et a l . , 1994) model for 
Asia. These models extend earlier energy sector models that 
dealt with a comparative costs assessment of isolated sulfur 
and carbon reductions and joint mitigation, such as the OECD 
GREEN model (Complainville and Martins, 1994) or the 
IIASA MESSAGE model (Grübler, 1998b; Nakicenovic et a l , 
1998a). The state of knowledge and availability of models to 
study the joint benefits of sulfur and carbon emission 
reductions was reviewed in the 1995 IPCC SAR WGIII Report 
(Bruce et a i , 1996) and is expanding rapidly (CIRED et a l , 
1997; Nakicenovic et a l , 1997; Grübler, 1998c). 
3.6.5. 
Ozone 
Precursors 
IPCC Working Group I (WGI) SAR (Houghton et a l , 1996) 
confirmed the importance of tropospheric ozone as a 
greenhouse gas. Ozone is produced in the troposphere in a 
complex chain of reactions that involve the ozone precursors 
nitrogen oxides (NO^,), non-CH^ hydrocarbons or volatile 
organic compounds (NMVOCs), and CO. Therefore, it is 
important to explore possible future developments of emissions 
of these substances to analyze the evolution of tropospheric 
ozone levels. 
3 . 6 . 5 . 1 . N i t r o g e n O x i d e s 
N0^ are released through fossil fuel combustion (24 MtN per 
year around 1990), natural and anthropogenic soil release (12 
MtN per year), biomass burning (8 MtN per year), lightning (5 
MtN per year), NH3 oxidation (3 MtN per year), aircraft (0.4 
MtN/year), and transport from the stratosphere (0.1 MtN per 
year). These figures are mean estimates within a range; for fossil 
fuel combustion, aircraft emissions, and stratospheric input the 
ranges may be as narrow as 30%, but for natural sources the 
ranges may be up to a factor of 2 (Prather et a i , 1995). The 
uncertainties in the estimates are illustrated by comparison of 
the detailed emissions inventory of Olivier et a l . (1996) with the 
1994 IPCC estimates - while global total emissions estimates by 
source are very similar, at the regional level emissions estimates 
show pronounced differences, particularly in Asia. 
Fossil fuel combustion in the 
electric power and transport 
sectors is the largest source. Emissions from fossil fuel use in 
North America and Europe have barely increased since 1979 
because fossil fuel consumption leveled off and air quality 
abatement was enacted, but in Asia emissions are believed to 
increase by 4% annually (Prather et a i , 1995). As a result of the 
first NOjj Protocol in Europe, N0^^ emissions in Europe had 
decreased from 1987 levels by 13% in 1994, but the European 
Union is unlikely to meet its target of the 5* European Action 
Plan of a 30% reduction (EEA, 
1999). An important reason is 
that it is difficult to abate N0^ emissions in the growing 
transport sector. Perhaps critically, there are significant 
differences between the characteristics of abatement of SOj and 
NOj^ 
emissions. While both substances have regional 
acidification effects, a priority for SO2 abatement is induced by 
its important local health effects. Also, whereas SO^ emissions 
relate closely to the type of fuel, NO^^ emissions are more 
dependent on the combustion technology and condifions. 
Few scenarios for N0^, emissions exist beyond the studies for 
Europe, North America, and Japan (IS92 scenarios are a notable 
exception). New scenarios, such as those by Bouwman and van 
Vuuren (1999) and Collins et a l . (1999) often still use IS92a as 
a "loose" baseline, with new abatement policies added as they 
were introduced in the OECD countries after 1992, according to 
current reduction plans (CRP). Collins et a l . (1999) also explore 
a maximum feasible reduction scenaiio, in which European N0^, 
emissions decrease by 60% by 2015 and North American 
emissions by 5%. In the related CRP scenaiio of Bouwman and 
van Vuuren (1999), N0^, emissions in the developing countries 
are assumed to decrease also (by more than 10%) by 2015. 
These studies, however, should be used with care as the authors 
developed their somewhat arbitrary scenarios primarily for 
atmospheric chemistry analysis; they are not based on an in-
depth analysis of the characteristics of the emissions sources and 
potential policies in the various regions outside the OECD.

Prather et a l . (1995) estimates the total global emissions of CO 
at 1800 to 2700 MtC per year in the decade before 1994. The 
most important of the approximately 1000 TgC anthropogenic 
sources are technological (300 to 550 MtC per year) and 
biomass burning (300 to 700 MtC per year). Technological 
sources dominate in the northern hemisphere, and include 
transport, combustion, industrial processes, and refuse 
incineration. Biomass burning dominates in the southern 
hemisphere, and includes burning of agricultural waste, 
savanna 
burning, 
and 
deforestation. 
The 
detailed, 
geographically explicit EDGAR database (Olivier et a l . , 1996) 
has similar emissions estimates for CO. Other sources are 
biogenics (60 to 160 MtC per year), oceans (20 to 200 MtC per 
year), and oxidation of CH^ (400 to 1000 MtC per year) and of 
NMVOCs (200 to 600 MtC per year). To a large extent, this 
oxidation nray be considered anthropogenic in origin because 
many emissions sources of CH4 and NMVOCs are of an 
anthropogenic nature. 
Global emissions estimates of NMVOCs are also very 
uncertain. Prather et a l . (1995) indicate a global total for 
anthropogenic NMVOCs of about 140 MtC per year, from road 
transport (25%), solvent use (14%), fuel production and 
distribution (13%), fuel consumption (34%), and the rest from 
uncontrolled burning and other sources. The 
EDGAR 
inventory by Olivier et a l . (1996) suggests that global 
emissions may be higher (178 MtC per year) because of higher 
estimates of emissions from energy production and use. As 
with CO, emissions in the northern hemisphere are dominated 
by transport and industry, while in the southern hemisphere 
biomass and biofue! burning is often the dominant source. In 
Europe, emissions of NMVOCs are controlled under the 5* 
Environmental Action Programme of the European Union and 
1 5 4 
S c e n a r i o D r i v i n g 
Forces 
the VOC Protocol of the U N Convention on Long-Range 
Transboundary Air Pollution. However, for reasons similar to 
those for NOj^, the cun'ent reduction of 11% with respect to 
1990 levels and 15% with respect to 1987 levels suggests that 
the plaimed reduction to 30% in 1999 may not be reached 
(EEA, 1999). As a consequence, threshold values for ozone 
continue to be exceeded in Europe. 
No long-term global scenarios for emissions of NMVOCs and 
CO were identified beyond IS92, which assumes increasing 
emissions. The important role of biomass combustion in these 
emissions means that a scenario with low carbon emissions 
because of an increased used of biomass energy does not 
automatically lead to low emissions of NMVOCs and CO. 
Also, emissions trends are influenced significantly by 
assumptions as to the type of combustion or other conversion 
technology (e.g. gasification) deployed in the future. If 
biomass fuel is used in modem large power plants or boilers, or 
is to be converted into modem energy carriers, CO emissions 
will be almost negligible compared to those of traditional uses. 
As with sulfur, however, it seems plausible that with rising 
incomes, abatement of the ozone precursors may be initiated in 
non-OECD regions to address local and particularly regional 
air pollution (photochemical smog). Since control of these 
substances is more difficult than that of sulfur, it may not be 
implemented until later.

Halocarbons 
and Other 
I n d u s t r i a l 
Gases 
This category of GHG emissions comprises a wide basket of 
different gas species that originate from a multitude of 
processes. Generally, their common characteristic is that they 
are released into the atmosphere in comparatively small 
amounts, but on a molecular basis most of the gases are long-
lived, with atmospheric lifetimes up to 50,000 years. Generally 
they have a strong greenhouse forcing per molecule (see 
Chapter 5, Table 5-7). 
Anthropogenic emissions of gases that cause stratospheric 
ozone depletion (chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochloro-
fluorocarbons (HCFCs), halons, methylchloroform, carbon 
tetrachloride, 
and 
methylbromide) 
are 
controlled by 
consumption restrictions (production plus imports minus 
exports) in the Montreal Protocol. No special SRES scenarios 
were developed for these gases because their future emission 
levels (phase out) are primarily policy driven and hence 
unrelated to scenario variations of important driving-force 
variables such as population, economic growth, or industrial 
output. Instead, the Montreal Protocol scenario (A3, maximum 
allowed production scenario) from the 1998 WMO/UNEP 
S c i e n t i f i c 
Assessment 
of 
Ozone 
D e p l e t i o n 
is 
used 
(WMO/UNEP, 1998). 
The procedures for constructing scenarios for hydro-
fluorocarbon 
(HFC), polyfluorocarbon (PEC), and sulfur 
hexafluoride (SFg) emissions - for which there is an extreme 
paucity of scenario literature - are based on Fenhann (2000) 
and are described in greater detail in Chapter 5, Section 5.3.3. 
In this approach, future total demand for CFCs, HFCs, and 
other CFC substitutes is estimated on the basis of historical 
trends. HFC emissions are calculated using an assumed future 
replacement of CFCs by HFCs and other substitutes. The main 
drivers for the emissions are population and GDP growth. The 
sparse literature available (reviewed in Fenhann, 2000) 
indicates that emissions are related non-linearly to these 
driving forces, with important possibilities for saturation 
effects and long-term decoupling between growth in driving 
force variables and emissions. The emissions have been tuned 
to agree with emissions scenarios presented at the joint 
IPCC-TEAP expert meeting (WMO/UNER 1999). Material 
from the March Consulting Group (1999) has also been used. 
For PFCs (CF4 and C,Fg) the emissions driver is primary 
aluminum production, which is generally modeled using GDP 
and a consumption elasticity. Recycling rates are increasingly 
important, as reflected in the SRES scenarios (see Chapter 5). 
Aluminum production by the Soederberg process resulted, on 
average, in the emission of 0.45 kgCF^ per tAl and 0.02 kgC2Fg 
per tAl in 1998 in Norway. The effect of future technological 
change on the emissions factor can be assumed to be large, 
since the costs of modifications in process technology can be 
offset by the costs of saved energy. A considerable reduction in 
the emission factors has already taken place and the present 
emission factor of 0.5 kgCF^ per tAl is expected to fall to 0.15 
kgCF^ per tAl at various rates (see Chapter 5). An emission 
factor for C^Fg, 10 times lower than that of CF^ was used in the 
calculations. The present trend of not replacing CFCs and 
HCFCs with high global warming compounds like PFCs (or 
SF^) is also assumed to continue, which might underestimate 
the effect of future emissions. The only other source included 
for PEC emissions is semiconductor manufacturing, for which 
the industry has globally adopted a voluntary agreement to 
reduce its PEG emissions by 10% in 2010 relative to 1995 
levels. 
SFg emissions originate from two main activities - the use of 
SFg as a gas insulator in high-vohage electricity equipment, 
and its use in magnesium foundries, in which SFg prevents the 
oxidation of molten magnesium. The driver for the former is 
electricity demand and for the latter it is future magnesium 
production, which will depend on GDP and a consumption 
elasticity. Emission factor reductions over time that result from 
more careful handling, recovery, recycling, and substitution of 
SFg are assumed for both sources. Fenhann (2000) assumes 
that in low future scenarios SFg emissions factors decline to 
one-tenth their present values between 2020 and 2090. In high 
future scenarios, Fenhann (2000) assumes reduction levels are 
somewhat lower, ranging from 55% to 90% depending on the 
region. In the absence of scenario literature, these assumptions 
are retained here (see Chapter 5). Other applications of SFg 
include as a tracer gas in medical surgery and the production of 
semiconductors, and as an insulator in some windows. 
However, these sources are assumed to be cause less than 1% 
of the global emissions.

Policies 
3.7.1. 
I n t r o d u c t i o n 
"Policies" in this report are government policies. They are 
formulated against the larger background of national and 
intemational events and trends, and result from millions of 
decisions within the existing and only slowly changing 
cultural, 
economic, 
and 
military 
balances, 
Their 
implementation often poses considerable problems if they 
represent longer-term interests and insights. 
Government policies are among the dynamics that influence 
population growth, economic and social 
development, 
technological change, resource exploitation, and pollution 
management. While the role of policy has been touched upon 
occasionally 
in 
earlier 
sections, 
government 
policy 
development can be thought of as a process in itself. The role 
of policies in SRES needs to be considered, partly because 
governments are one of the primary audiences for the scenarios 
and partly because the scenarios are intended to form a 
reference against which mitigation strategies can be assessed 
(although, as stated earlier, the SRES terms of reference 
require the SRES scenarios to n o t consider any explicit climate 
policies). 
GHG emissions are affected by policies designed for a wide 
variety of purposes. Perhaps the most obvious are energy 
policies, but other important policy areas are those of economic 
development, technology development, education, health, 
social welfare, transport, industry, agriculture, and forestry. 
Policies in each of these areas also affect other areas. In each 
policy area various instruments are used. The choice of 
instrument may influence both the policy's success in 
achieving its primary objective and its effect on G H G 
emissions. Taxes, subsidies, regulations, information-based 
instruments, and R&D all bring different mechanisms into play 
and so have different affects. 
The remainder of this section is organized around speciflc 
policy areas or objectives. It considei's major policy issues in 
each area, and discusses the possible implications for GHG 
emissions in reference (non-mitigation) scenarios. 
3.7.2. 
Policy 
Areas 
3.7.2.1. P o p u l a t i o n a n d S o c i a l Welfare 
P o l i c i e s 
Given the interactions between demographics and social and 
economic development discussed in Sections 3.2 and 3.3, 
population and social welfare policies that currently exist or are 
options for various countries can also be viewed as "non-
climate" policies (in the sense that they are not motivated by 
climate concems, but will affect future G H G emissions). 
Studies support the notion that reduced population growth 
significantly abates GHG emissions. Indeed, some integrated 
assessment models suggest that emissions scenarios may be 
more sensitive to population changes, with respect to 
nonnalized uncertainty analysis, than to other factors that 
affect emissions (Nordhaus, 1993). Therefore, social policies 
that affect fertility rates (and mortality and migration rates) 
also could have a significant impact on future emissions. By 
the same token, demographic policies for health and education 
may also affect productivity growth in a positive manner. Thus, 
the desirable objective to further development may result in 
higher economic growth, consumption, and emissions per 
capita. The overall effects are likely to vary from country to 
country. 
For 
instance, efforts can be made to help women avoid 
unwanted 
pregnancies 
or to reduce 
infant mortality. 
Demographic health surveys suggest that more than 100 
million women in less developed countries do not want to 
become pregnant, but they do not practice contraception 
(Bongaarts, 1994). The Cairo Program of Action (UN, 1995) 
estimates that US$17 billion annually would successfully 
deliver family planning and reproductive health services to the 
majority of people in developing countries who desire them. 
Family planning assistance today contributes to the observed 
recent declines in fertility rates in many developing countries. 
In one study, it was estimated that such programs over the past 
two decades reduced the present population by about 40 
million persons, which in itself may reduce future population 
levels by some 400 million people in the year 2100 (Bongaarts 
et a l , 1990). 
Other policy measures are less direct, but also exert important 
influences on fertility rates. These include improvements in 
health care and female education, especially primary school 
education, which is a factor that correlates highly with fertility 
rates in young women (Bongaarts, 1994). Similarly, measures 
that improve gender equality reduce fertility rates as they 
encourage non-maternal roles and increase employment and 
empowerment opportunities for women. Their implementation 
is currentiy unrelated to concems about global warming, yet 
their effect on this environmental issue may be significant.

T e c h n o l o g i c a l I n n o v a t i o n 
A wide range of policies and circumstances may contribute 
toward the desirable objective of furthering development and 
economic growth (see Section 3.3). In the short tenn, fiscal, 
monetary, and interest rate management policies ai-e among the 
main instmments used by governments. In the longer term, 
economic growth may be affected more by measures that 
influence fundamental capabilities, such as policies in 
education, and in the development of physical infrastructure, 
social and economic institutions, and national systems for 
innovation. 
As emphasized in Sections 3,3 and 3.4, the effects of economic 
growth on GHG emissions depend on economic stracture and 
technology. Govemments generally aim to encourage the 
development of particular sectors that are perceived to 
1 5 6 
S c e n a r i o D r i v i n g 
Forces 
contribute to national goals for security, food and energy 
supply, high employment, and long-term economic growth 
(Maddison, 1995). The encouragement may take many forms, 
such as direct subsidies and protection from foreign 
competition, public investment in infrastructure, training, or 
R&D, 
and support for collaborative development programs 
and information networks (OECD, 1997a). If governments 
support sectors that are fossil-fuel intensive, the tendency to 
increase G H G emissions is clear. However, protectionist 
policies may also reduce national economic efficiency, which 
dampens income growth and tends to restrict growth in 
GHG 
emissions. 
Conversely, if governments 
support 
the 
development of rapid-growth sectors, the tendency may be to 
promote long-term economic growth, increase household 
income and consumpfion, and hence 
increase G H G 
emissions. 
Over a period of 100 years the policies that most influence the 
development of G H G emissions are probably those that 
contribute to the processes of technical and social innovation, 
which themselves contribute to economic development. 
Innovation policies mostly emphasize the development of 
technologies that improve intemational competitiveness with 
new products and improved performance or reduced costs of 
existing products. The policies are not usually designed to 
achieve these and other (e.g., environmental and social) 
objectives in an integrated way (OECD, 1998b). Hence, their 
impact on GHG emissions is hard to predict, but as cunently 
constituted many national systems for innovation could tend to 
increase emissions by sfimulating economic growth.

Government policies on energy and agriculture have, on the 
whole, paralleled global trends during the 20* century. Early in 
the century there was a move toward protectionism, which 
aimed to secure national self-sufficiency, especially in food and 
energy. Govemments established import quotas and tariffs, 
subsidies for domestic production, and research and investment 
programs to improve agricultural productivity and develop new 
energy sources. During the 1980s policy emphasis shifted in 
many countries, and has continued into the 1990s, toward open 
borders and reduced subsidies and R & D . Nonetheless, 
numerous energy and agricultural policies persist that 
influence production and trade pattems and hence also G H G 
emissions. 
3 . 7 . 2 . 3 . 1 . E n e r g y p o l i c i e s 
Various policies exist to promote energy efficiency and the 
adoption of energy-efficient technologies and practices. 
Govemment standards, such as appliance efficiency standards, 
motors standards, and the automobile fuel economy standards 
in the US, prescribe the energy consumption levels of 
particular commodities. Residential and commercial building 
standards require the use of energy-efficient construction 
practices 
and 
components. 
Information 
dissemination 
programs, such as the Green Lights program in the USA or 
similar programs in other countries, provide consumers with 
the information required to make purchase decisions as well as 
to install and operate energy-efficient equipment. Subsidy or 
investment credit programs are often used to promote the 
adoption of a particular technology; combined heat and power 
was promoted in The Netherlands through such a program in 
the 1980s (Parla and Blok, 1995). Other energy efficiency 
policies or programs include audits and assessments, rebate 
programs, govemment procurement programs, benchmarking 
programs, labeling programs, and technology demonstration 
programs (Worrell e t a l . , 1997). 
Many reports point to govemment subsidies as a major 
impediment to cleaner production of energy (Bumiaux et a l , 
1992; 
Larsen and Shah, 1992; de Moor and Calamai, 1996; 
Roodman, 1996; Greenpeace, 1997). In addition to direct 
subsidies, govemments use a wide variety of measures to 
support domestic or regional industries, or to protect legal 
monopolies. These policies inhibit innovation and can lead to 
higher levels of pollution or resource intensity than would 
occur in a less constrained market. A recent OECD study found 
that reform of supports to coal, electricity, and transport could 
substantially reduce COj and acid rain emissions in some 
countries (OECD, 1997a). In other countries, subsidy reform 
would have minimal direct environmental benefits, but would 
increase the effectiveness or reduce the cost of environmental 
policies such as eco-taxes and emission limits. Where subsidies 
support nuclear power or other non-fossil energy sources, their 
reform could conversely lead to increased GHG emissions. 
Energy taxes also have an important influence on energy 
demand and hence G H G emissions. The majority of energy 
taxes are intended as a pure fiscal instrument or, in the case of 
road fuel taxes in some countries, to raise funds for road 
provision and maintenance. Many countries are raising these 
taxes, or considering doing so. 
3 . 7 . 2 . 3 . 2 . A g r i c u l t u r e p o l i c i e s 
Agricultural policy reform has received more attention than 
energy policy reform in recent years. Most OECD countries 
support domestic agriculture, whether through direct subsidies, 
import tariffs, or price controls. The general trend is toward a 
reduction in these supports, in part as a result of tiade 
negotiations, but also as part of the broader trend toward 
policies that reduce budget deficits and improve market 
efficiency. Supports are also being reformed to reduce their 
linkage to production volumes. Where subsidies are linked to 
the volume of production, they provide an incentive to increase 
output beyond the level of demand, which leads to surpluses. 
This incentive may tend to increase GHG emissions as a result 
of soil carbon depletion and oxidation, excessive use of 
nitrogen fertilizer leading to N2O emissions, and over-intensive 
animal farming that results in excess CH^ emissions from 
manure and from the animals themselves (OECD, 1997b; 
Storey, 1997). The overall impact of agriculture subsidy 
reforms on GHG emissions will depend on associated fiscal 
changes in other parts of the economy. 
Scenario 
D r i v i n g F o r c e s 
1 5 7 
Overproduction in one country may be compensated to some 
extent by lower production elsewhere. However, in general, 
incentives for higher agricultural output are likely to lead to 
more production globally, with a shift from consumption of 
plant products to animal products, which are land-, resource-, 
and GHG-intensive. In a few industrialized countries a small 
trend has developed to support organic farming and regional 
marketing of foods. Future policies may thus lead to 
agricultural subsidies that are linked more to ecological and 
social factors than to the volume of production. 
3.7.2.3.3. D e m a t e r i a l i z a t i o n p o l i c i e s 
GHG emissions are likely to be reduced by other policies for 
the sustainable use of resources, such as land, forest 
ecosystems, mineral resources, water, and soil. Insti'uments 
may include direct planning, regulations, establishing property 
rights and obligations, information, education, and persuasion, 
and a broad range of policies to support or influence the 
innovation process to encourage dematerialization (OECD, 
1998b). 
3.7.2.4. E n v i r o n m e n t a l P o l i c i e s 
While environmental objectives often form part of the rationale 
for agriculture and energy policy reforms, many instruments 
are focused entirely on environmental objectives. The most 
obvious of these are pollution regulations and standards, eco-
taxes, and voluntary and other measures. 
In the context of non-mitigation G H G emission scenarios, 
probably the most important environmental policies are those 
related to sulfur emissions (see Section 3.4.3). Sulfur 
emissions are controlled for local and regional environmental 
reasons, but sulfur oxides do have a radiative impact, and sulfur 
controls can lead to the switching of fuel away from coal and 
oil. Thus, almost paradoxically, environmental policies to 
combat urban air pollution and acid rain may (via reduced 
sulfate aerosol "cooling") exacerbate climate change. Most 
sulfur control policies to date have involved either regulations 
that limit the concentration of sulfur oxides in flue gas from 
large combustion plants, or give standards for the sulfur 
content of fuel. Recently, sulfur control poUcies have become 
more sophisticated, and aim to limit aggregate emissions on a 
national or regional basis to minimize acidic deposition in a 
trans-national context. New policy instruments have also been 
introduced. The USA has pioneered a "cap and trade" system 
with tradable emission permits (for a review see Joskow et a l . , 
1998). 
Other envnonmental poUcies with a greenhouse impact include 
controls on ODSs; urban air pollution precursor compounds 
(CO, 
N0^, CH4, and NMVOCs), especially from transport and 
domestic solid fuels; and controls on agricultural practice to 
reduce water pollution and soil erosion. Policies in all of these 
areas are likely to contribute to GHG mitigation. However, 
some options, such as an accelerated shift to electric vehicles 
to reduce local air pollution, could resuh in higher GHG 
emissions in the short term in certain circumstances (Michaelis 
e t a l , 1996). 
3.7.2.5. 
T r a n s p o r t a t i o n a n d I n f r a s t r u c t u r e P o U c i e s 
Policies on infrastructure may have a very long-term influence 
on 
GHG emissions, although in many cases the causal 
relationships are complex and not understood well enough to 
justify quantitative analyses of the policy options. These 
include urban planning guidance, construction regulations, 
policies on ownership and financing of infrastructure, and user 
pricing for roads and parking. The most significant impacts on 
GHG emissions are likely to derive from policies that influence 
demand for travel by car and for freight transport by track 
(Newman and Kenworthy, 1990; MichaeUs et a l . , 1996; 
Watson et a l , 1996), those that influence energy use in 
buildings (Levine et a l , 1996; Watson et a l , 1996), and those 
that influence the conversion of forest for agriculture, or 
agricultural land for urban development. 
3 . 7 . 3 . 
Q u a n t i f i c a t i o n of Impacts 
and I m p l e m e n t a t i o n of 
Policies 
i n S R E S 
Few of the poficies and instruments identified above can be 
represented directiy in the models typically used to produce 
GHG emission scenarios. In general, the impacts of policies 
are highly uncertain (Houghton et a l . , 1996). Price-based 
instruments have been analyzed in greater detail than other 
types of measure, and many empirical studies have been 
carried out to determine the response to price changes of 
demand for various commodities, especially energy. However, 
such research and analysis usually yields very large ranges of 
uncertainty in the magnitude of the price response, and often 
reveals a strong dependence on specific circumstances. Even 
for 
price-based policies, national and global effects over 
20-100 years are very uncertain. For the SRES, it is not 
possible to make a precise link between 
governments' 
application of specific policies and the outcome in the various 
scenarios. 
Instead, the qualitative SRES scenario storylines give a broad 
characterization of the areas of policy emphasis thought to be 
associated with particular economic, technological, and 
environmental outcomes, as reflected in altemative scenario 
assumptions in the models used to generate long-term G H G 
emission scenarios. In some selected areas, such as sulfur 
control policies, a wide body of literature can be drawn upon to 
derive specific pollution control levels or maximum emission 
trajectories consistent with a particular interpretation of a 
scenario storyline. In other areas, such as G H G gases 
controlled by the Montreal Protocol, existing scenarios that 
reflect the most up-to-date information are used as direct input 
to SRES.

Introduction 
In Chapter 4 the main characteristics of the scenarios 
developed for the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios 
(SRES scenarios) are presented. These scenarios cover a wide 
range of driving forces from demographic to social and 
economic developments, and they encompass a wide range of 
future greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (see Chapter 5). 
Chapters 2 and 3 provide an overview and assessment of the 
scenario literature, the main driving forces of future GHG 
emissions, and their relationships. How the driving forces are 
combined to produce a set of scenarios that cover the ranges of 
GHG emissions from the literature is described in this chapter. 
Chapters 2 and 3 demonstrate the large uncertainty in the 
literature that surrounds both future emissions and the possible 
developments of their underlying driving forces. The 
uncertainties range from inadequate scientiñc understanding of 
the problems, through data gaps or lack of data, to the inherent 
unceitainties of future events in general. Hence altemative 
scenarios are used to describe the range of possible future 
emissions. 
The SRES approach involved the development of a set of four 
ahemative scenario "families" (see Chapter 1, Section 1.7.2). 
Each family of SRES scenarios includes a descriptive part 
(called a "storyline") and a number of altemative interpretations 
and quantifications of each storyline developed by six different 
modeling approaches (see also Box 1-1 on terminology). Each 
storyline describes 
a demographic, 
social, economic, 
technological, and policy future for each of the scenario 
families. Within each family different s c e n a r i o s explore 
variations of global and regional developments and their 
implications for GHG, ozone precursors, and sulfur emissions. 
Each of these scenarios is consistent with the broad framework 
specified by the storyline of the scenario family. 
Each storyline is basically a short "history" of a possible future 
development expressed as a combination of key scenario 
characteristics. These descriptions are styHzed and designed to 
facilitate specification and further interpretation of scenario 
quantifications. The storylines identify particular dynamics, 
visible in the world today, that might have important influences 
on future GHG emissions. They deliberately explore what 
might happen if social, economic, technical, and policy 
developments take a particular direction at the global level; 
they also pay attention to regional differences and interactions, 
especially between developing and industiialized countries. 
The broad consensus among the SRES writing team is that the 
current literature analysis suggests the future is inherently 
unpredictable and so views will differ as to which of the 
storylines and representative scenarios could be more or less 
likely. Therefore, the development of a single "best guess" or 
"business-as-usual" scenario is neither desirable nor possible. 
Nor should the storylines and scenarios be taken as policy 
recommendations. The storylines represent the playing out of 
certain social, economic, technological, and environmental 
paradigms, which will be viewed positively by some people 
and negatively by others. The SRES writing team decided on 
four storylines - an even number helps to avoid the impression 
of a "central" or "most likely" case. The team wanted more 
than two storylines to help illustrate that the future depends on 
many different underlying dynamics; the team wanted no more 
than four to avoid complicating the process with too many 
alternatives. The scenarios cover a wide range of, but not all 
possible, futures. In particular, it was decided that possible 
"suфrises" would not be considered and that there would be no 
"disaster" scenarios. The team decided to carry out sensitivity 
tests within some of the storylines by considering altemative 
scenarios with different fossil-fuel reserves, rates of economic 
growth, or rates of technical change. These sensitivity analyses 
resulted in groups of scenarios within a given scenario family 
and alternative scenario interpretations within a scenario group 
or family (see Section 4.2 below for a description of scenario 
terminology and taxonomy). 
The tities of the storylines are deliberately simple - A l , A2, 
B l , and B2. There is no particular order among the storytines 
(they are listed alphabetically). Figure 4-1 shows that the SRES 
scenarios build on the main driving forces of GHG emissions. 
Each scenario family is based on a common specification of the 
main driving forces. 
All four storylines and scenario families describe future worlds 
that are generally more affluent compared to the current 
situation. They range from very rapid economic growth and 
technologic change to high levels of environmental protection, 
from low-to-high global populations, and from high-to-low 
GHG emissions. Perhaps more importantiy, all the storylines 
describe dynamic changes and transitions in generally different 
directions. The storylines do not include specific climate-
change policies, but they do include numerous other socio­
economic developments and non-climate environmental 
policies. As time progresses, the storylines diverge from each 
other in many of their characteristic features. In this way they 
span the relevant range of GHG emissions and different 
combinations of their main sources. 
After the basic features and driving forces for each of the four 
storylines had been determined, the team quantified the 
storylines into individual scenarios with the help of formal 
(computer) models. While the writing team and the modeling 
groups included experts from around the world, all six 
modeling groups are based in Europe, North America, and 
Japan. As indicated above, each model quantification of a 
storyline constitutes a scenario, and all scenarios of one 
storyline constitute a "scenario family." The six models are 
representative of different approaches to emissions-scenario 
modeling and different integrated assessment frameworks in 
the literature, and include so-called top-down and bottom-up 
models. The use of different models reflects the SRES Terms 
of Reference call for méthodologie pluralism and for an open 
process (see Appendix I). The number and type of models 
chosen in the open process was on a voluntary basis. In January 
1997 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Working

SRES Scenarios 
Figure 4-1: The four SRES scenario famihes that share 
common storyhnes are illustrated as branches of a two-
dimensional tree. The two dimensions indicate the relative 
orientation of the different scenario storylines toward 
economic or environmental concerns and global and 
regional scenario development pattems, respectively. There 
is no implication that these two are mutually exclusive or 
incompatible. In reality, the four scenarios share a space of 
a much higher dimensionality given the numerous driving 
forces and other assumptions needed to define any given 
scenario in a particular modeling approach. The A l 
storyline branches out into different groups of scenarios to 
illustrate that altemarive development paths are possible 
within one scenario family. 
Group II Technical Support Unit (IPCC WGII TSU) sent letters 
to Governments asking for nominations of modeling teams to 
contribute to SRES and advertised in a number of scientific 
journals for modelers to participate in SRES. Six different 
modeling groups from Europe, North America, and Japan 
volunteered to participate in the fonnulation and development 
of the scenarios in response to the call. It is fortunate that they 
are from three different continents and also include different 
methodological approaches used in the literature to develop 
quantitative emissions scenarios. 
The 
six models have different regional aggregations. The 
writing team decided to group the various global regions into 
four "macro-regions" common to all the regional aggregations 
across the six models (Box 4-1). 
In response to a number of requests from potential user groups 
within IPCC and in accordance with a decision of the IPCC 
Bureau in 1998 to release draft scenarios to climate modellers 
for their input in the Third Assessment Report, the writing team 
chose one model run to characterize each scenaiio family. 
Scenarios resulting from these runs are called "marker" 
scenarios or simply "markers." There are four marker 
scenarios, each considered characteristic for one of the four 
scenario families. The rationale and process for designating 
marker scenarios is discussed in more detail in Section 4.4.1. 
The SRES scenario quantifications of the main indicators (such 
as population and economic growth, characteristics of the 
energy system, and the associated G H G emissions) all fall 
within the range of studies published in the Hterature and 
scenarios documented in the SRES database (see Chapter 2). 
Quantitative indicators form an important part of each scenario 
description. These indicators include gross world product, 
population, supply and demand for principal energy forms, 
energy resource characteristics, the breakdown of land use, and 
emissions of various GHGs. The scenarios are designed so that 
the evolution of their indicators over the 2P' centviry falls well 
within the range represented by scenarios from the literature 
and included in the SRES database (see Chapter 2 and Morita 
and Lee, 1998; Nakicenovic, et a l , 1998). More importantly, 
they correspond to the qualitative characteristics of the 
respective storylines. Also, they were revised iteratively within 
the six modeling approaches to achieve internal consistency on 
the basis of inputs from the entire SRES writing team and the 
SRES open process. 
Each storyline was characterized initially by two quantitative 
"targets," namely global population (15, 10, and 7 billion by 
2100 in scenarios A2, B2, and both A l and B l , respectively) 
and global gross domestic product (GDP) 
by 2100 (in 1990 US 
dollars, US$550 trillion for A l , US$250 trillion for A2, 
US$350 trifiion for B l , and US$250 trillion for B2). These 
quantitative targets guided the subsequent quantification of the 
SRES scenarios with different model approaches. Generally, 
the orders of magnitude of these original quantitative scenario 
"guideposts" are reflected in the final SRES scenarios (see 
Table 4-2) and have been adopted in a majority of SRES 
scenarios. Evidently, the quantitative characteristics of the four 
SRES scenario families comprise many more dimensions than 
this, in particular regional pattems, differences in resource and 
technology availability, land-use changes, non-carbon dioxide 
(COj) 
GHGs, etc. These are discussed in the subsequent 
Sections.

Storylines 
The primary purpose of developing multiple scenario families 
was to explore the uncertainties behind potential trends in 
global developments and GHG emissions, as well as the key 
drivers that influence these (see also Chapter 1, Section 1.7.2). 
The writing team decided that narrative storylines, based on the 
futures and scenario literature, would be the most coherent way 
to describe their scenarios, for the following reasons. 
• 
To help the team to think more coherently about the 
complex interplay between scenario driving forces 
A n O v e r v i e w of 
Scenaiios

within and across altemative scenarios and to enhance 
the consistency in assumptions for different parameters. 
• 
To make it easier to explain the scenarios to the various 
user communities by providing a narrative description 
of altemative futures that goes beyond quantitative 
scenario features. 
• 
To make the scenarios more useful, in particular, to 
analysts contributing to IPCC WGs II and III. The 
demographic, social, political, and technological contexts 
described in the scenario storylines are all-important in 
the analysis of the effects of policies to either adapt to 
climate change or to reduce GHG emissions. 
Box 4-1: Four SRES World Regions 
• 
To provide a guide for additional assumptions to be 
made in detailed climate-impact and mitigation 
analyses, because at present no model or scenario can 
possibly respond to the wide variety of infomiational 
and data needs of the different user communities of 
long-term emissions scenarios. 
The 
four scenario families presented in this report are 
representative of a broad range of scenarios found in the 
literature, but they are not directly based on any particular 
published scenario taxonomy or set of scenarios. Rather, the 
storylines of each scenario family were developed on the basis 
The six modeling frameworks used to develop the SRES scenarios have different regional aggregations. The writing team 
decided to group the various global regions into four "macro-regions" common to all the diiferent regional aggregations across 
the six models (Figure 4.2; see Appendix IV, Table IV-1). The individual scenarios were formulated with the respective regional 
aggregation of each model. Afterward, the input assumptions and results were summed to correspond to the four macro-regions: 
• 
OECD90 region groups together all member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 
as of 1990, the base year of the participating models, and corresponds to the Annex II countries originally defmed in 
UNFCCC (1992). 
• 
REF region consists of countries undergoing economic reform and groups together the East and Central European 
countries and the Newly bidependent States of the former Soviet Union; it roughly corresponds to Annex I outside the 
Annex II countries as defined in UNFCCC (1992). 
• 
ASIA region stands for all developing (non-Annex I) countries in Asia (excluding the Middle East). 
• 
ALM region stands for the rest of the world and corresponds to developing (non-Annex I) countries in Africa, Latm 
America, and Middle East. 
In other words, the OECD90 and REF regions together roughly correspond to Annex I or industrialized (developed) countries 
(IND), while the ASIA and A L M regions together roughly correspond to the non-Annex I, or developing countries (DEV). 
Developing, or non-Annex I countries (i.e., ASIA and ALM), are sometimes referred to hi the text as the "South" to distinguish 
them from the mdustriahzed, or Annex I countries, of the "North" (i.e., OECD90 and REF). A detailed description of each 
region is provided in Appendix Ш.

A n O v e r v i e w of S c e n a r i o s 
of the general knowledge of this literature, and on the personal 
experience and creativity within the writing team. The writing 
team spent the better part of the first year (1997) formulating 
the storylines, which during the following two years were 
revised iteratively with the scenario development until the 
completion of the repoit. 
Four brief "future histories" captured by the SRES storylines 
differ in how global regions interrelate, how new technologies 
diffuse, how regional economic activities evolve, how 
protection of local and regional environments is implemented, 
and how demographic structure changes. The "qualitative" 
storyline characteristics include various political, social, 
cultural, and educational conditions (e.g., type of governance, 
social structure, and educational level) that often cannot be 
defined in strictiy quantitative tenns and do not directiy "drive" 
GHG 
emissions. These qualitative variables, however, 
participate in complex "cause-effect" relationships with 
quantitative emission drivers (e.g., economic activities, 
population levels, energy consumption). Their expficit 
inclusion in the scenario development process not only makes 
scenarios more "plausible" and "believable," but also ensures 
they do not become an arbitrary numeric combination of 
quantitative parameters. 
The 
SRES storylines do n o t include explicit policies to limit 
GHG 
emissions or to adapt to the expected global cHmate 
change, reflecting the SRES Teitns of Reference (see Appendix 
I). However, the storyline demographic, social, economic and 
technological profiles can be used in other studies to develop 
and evaluate climate-change mitigation and adaptation measures 
and policies. Such evaluation would require additional 
(prescriptive) assumptions about policies and measures to affect 
future climates and human responses to climate change now 
absent from the storylines. 
All four SRES "futures" represented by the distinct storylines 
are treated as equally possible and there are no "central," 
"business-as-usual," "surprise," or "disaster" futures (examples 
of which are given in Box 4.2). A l l of the storylines have 
features that can be inteipreted as "positive" or "negative" and 
Box 4-2: "Neutrality" of the SRES Scenarios 
they play out different tendencies and changes in part visible in 
the world today. To avoid the tendency to overemphasize 
"positive" or "negative" features of individual storylines, their 
titles were kept simple. Many attempts were made to capture 
the spirit of each storyline with a short and snappy title, but no 
single title was found to reflect adequately the complex mix of 
characteristics of any storyline. 
By 2100 the world will have changed in ways that are difficult 
to imagine, as difficult as it was at the end of the 19"^ century 
to imagine the changes of the 20"' century. However, each 
storyline takes a different direction of future developments so 
that they differ in an increasingly irreversible way. They 
describe divergent futures that reflect a significant portion of 
the underlying uncertainties in the main driving forces. The 
differences among the storylines cover a wide range of the key 
"future" characteristics, such as technology, governance, and 
behavioral patterns. Hence the plausibility or feasibility of the 
storyline assumptions should be viewed with an "open mind," 
not from a narrow interpretation of current situations and 
trends in economic conditions, technology developments, and 
social and governing structures. 
The 
main characteristics of future developments that take 
distinct development paths in the four storylines include (see 
also Table 4-2 for an overview): 
• 
Nature of the global and regional demographic develop­
ments in relation to other characteristics of the storyline. 
• 
Extent to which economic globalization and increased 
social and cultural interactions continue over the 2P' 
century. 
• 
Rates of global and regional economic developments 
and trade pattems in relation to the other characteristics 
of the storyline. 
• 
Rates 
and 
direction 
of 
global 
and regional 
technological change, especially in relation to the 
economic development prospects. 
• 
Extent to which local and regional environmental 
concems shape the direction of future development and 
environmental controls. 
The SRES scenarios are mtended to exclude catastrophic fumres. Such catastiophic futures feature prominently in the Uterature. 
They typically involve large-scale envnotunental or economic collapses, and extrapolate current unfavorable conditions and 
trends in many regions. Promment examples of such scenarios include "Retrenchment" (Kinsman, 1990), "Dark Side of the 
Market World" or "Change witiiout Progress" (Schwartz, 1991), "Black and Grey" (Godet et a l , 1994), "Global Incoherence 
Scenario" (Peterson, 1994), "New World Disorder" (Schwartz, 1996), "A Visit to Befindia" (Pohl, 1994), the future evoked by 
the description of the current situation in parts of West-Africa and Central Asia (Kaplan, 1996), "Barbarization" (Gallopin et a l , 
1997), "Dark Space" (Glenn and Gordon, 1999), "Global Fragmentation" (Lawrence et a l , 1997), and "A Passive Mean World" 
(Glenn and Gordon, 1997, 1999). In this last scenario the world is carved up into three rigid and distinct trading blocs, with 
fragmented political boundaries and out-of-control ethnic conflicts. In "Global Crisis" (de Jong and Zalm, 1991; СРВ, 1992) 
protectionism leads to a vicious circle of slowing economic growth and eventually breakdown. Many of these scenarios suggest 
that catastrophic developments may draw the world into a state of chaos within one or two decades. In such scenarios 
GHG 
emissions might be low because of low or negative economic growth, but it seems unlikely they would receive much attention 
in the light of more immediate problems. Hence, this report does not analyze such futures. 
A n O v e r v i e w of S c e n a r i o s

• 
Degree to which human and natural resources are 
mobilized globally and regionally to achieve multiple 
development objectives of each storyline. 
• 
Balance of economic, social, technological, or 
environmental objectives in the choices made by 
consumers, governments, 
enterprises, and other 
stakeholders. 
Thus, the storyliires describe developments in many different 
economic, technical, environmental, and social dimensions. 
Consequently, they occupy a multidimensional space and no 
simple metric can be used to classify them. Even though they 
occupy such a multidimensional space along many driving 
forces relevant for GHG emissions, it is useful here to highlight 
just two dimensions. The fnst refers to the extent of economic 
convergence and social and cultural interactions across the 
regions and the second to the balance between economic 
objectives and environmental and equity objectives. Possible 
names for these two dimensions could be "globalization" (Box 
4-3) and "sustainability," respectively (Box 4-4). As these two 
expressions are not necessarily viewed by everyone as being 
value-free, the two dimensions could alternatively be 
designated simply as a more g l o b a l or more 
r e g i o n a l 
orientation and as a more e c o n o m i c or a more e n v i r o n m e n t a l 
orientation (see Figure 4-1). These dimensions are important in 
the SRES scenarios. Nevertheless, there was considerable 
resistance in the SRES writing team against such a simplistic 
classification of storylines, so it is presented here for 
illustrative purposes only. These distinctions are, in a sense, 
artificial. For example, both economic and environmental 
objectives are pursued in all scenarios, albeit with different 
levels of relative emphasis. 
The extent to which the currently observed global and regional 
orientations will prevail in the 2P' century is pertinent to the 
distinction between the A l and B l scenario families on one 
side and A2 and B2 families on the other side. While the A l 
and B l storylines, to different degrees, emphasize successful 
Box 4-3: Globalization Issues 
With Ihe convergence ш governments' economic policies m the 
1990s, combined with the rapid development of communication 
networks, it is perhaps not surprising that an extensive poll of 
scenarios by the Millennium Institute suggested "globalization" 
as the main driving force that will shape the future (Gleim and 
Gordon, 1997,1999). However, some scenarios in the hterature 
explore the possibiUty that unfettered markets, usually seen as 
an mtegral element of "globalization," might destabilize society 
in ways that endanger the process (Mohan Rao, 1998). In 
UNESCO's 1998 Worid Culture Report, it is noted that 
communities are increasingly emphasizing their cultural 
individuality; meanwhile, communication and travel are 
resultmg in interactions between communities that result m the 
evolution of new "local" cultures 
(UNESCO, 
1998). 
Huntington (1996) asserts that continental regional cultures 
may determine the shape of future geopolitical developments 
rather than globahzation. 
Box 4-4: Sustainability Issues 
Recent decades have seen considerable growth in discourse 
of environmental and social issues, represented at the global 
level by several high-level United Nations (UN) meetings on 
social and economic development and environmental 
sustainability (UNCED, 1992; UN, 1994,1995; Leach, 1998; 
Mnnasinghe and Swart,2000). The range of participants has 
expanded from the most closely involved govertmient 
ministries, businesses, and envirormiental NGOs to include a 
broad range of representation by different ministries, local 
government, businesses, professions, and community groups. 
Increased interest in sustainability issues can lead to all kinds 
of socio-economic and technological changes that may not be 
aimed explicitly at reducing GHG emissions, but which may 
in effect contribute significantly to such reductions. 
economic global convergence and social and cultural 
interactions, A2 and B2 focus on a blossoming of diverse 
regional development pathways (see Box 4-3). 
The extent to which the currentiy observed economic and 
environmental orientations will prevail in the 2P' century is 
pertinent to the distinction between A l and A2 scenario 
families on one side and B l and B2 scenario families on the 
other side. In the B l and B2 storylines this transition is 
pursued, to different degrees, through a successful translation 
of global concerns into local actions to promote environmental 
sustainability. Altematively, in the A l and A2 storyhnes the 
emphasis remains, again to different degrees, on sustained 
economic development and achievement of high levels of 
affluence throughout the world, where environmental priorities 
are perceived as less important than those of economic 
development (see Box 4-4). 
In short, each of the storylines can be summarized as follows: 
• 
The A I storyline and scenario family describes a future 
world of very rapid economic growth, low population 
growth, and the rapid inttoduction of new and more 
efficient technologies. Major underlying themes are 
convergence among regions, capacity building, and 
increased cultural and social interactions, with a 
substantial reduction in regional differences in per 
capita income. The A I scenario family develops into 
four groups that describe altemative directions of 
technological change in the energy system.' 
' During the approval process of the Summary for Policymakers at 
the 5th Session of WGIII of the IPCC from 8-11 March 2000 in 
Katmandu, Nepal, it was decided to combine two of thiese groups ( 
A l C and AIG) into one "fossil intensive" group A l F I , in contrast to 
the non-fossil group AIT, and to select two illustrative scenarios 
from these two A l groups to facilitate use by modelers and policy 
makers. This leads to six scenario groups that constitute the four 
scenario families, three of which are in the A l family. A l l scenarios 
are equally sound. 
174 
A n O v e r v i e w of 
Scenarios 
• 
The A2 storyhne and scenario family describes a very 
heterogeneous world. The underlying theme is self-
reliance and preservation of local identities. Fertility 
patterns across regions converge very slowly, which 
results 
in high population 
growth. 
Economic 
development is primarily regionally oriented and per 
capita economic growth and technological change are 
more fragmented and slower than in other storylines. 
• 
The B l storyline and scenario family describes a 
convergent world with the same low population growth 
as in the A l storyline, but with rapid changes in 
economic structures toward a service and information 
economy, with reductions in material intensity, and the 
introduction 
of 
clean 
and 
resource-efficient 
technologies. The emphasis is on global solutions to 
economic, social, and environmental sustainability, 
including improved equity, but without additional 
climate initiatives. 
• 
The B2 storyline and scenario family describes a world 
in which the emphasis is on local solutions to 
economic, social, and environmental sustainability. It is 
a world with moderate population growdi, intennediate 
levels of economic development, and less rapid and 
more diverse technological change than in the В1 and 
AI 
storylines. While the scenario is also oriented 
toward environmental protection and social equity, it 
focuses on local and regional levels. 
These storylines are presented in more detail in Section 4.3, 
which includes their original quantitative indicators that served 
as input to the scenario quantification process. 
42.2. 
Scenarios 
A l l 
SRES 
scenarios 
were 
designed 
as 
quantitative 
"interpretations" (quantifications) of the SRES qualitative 
storylines. Each scenario is a particular quantification of one of 
the four storylines. The quantitative inputs for each scenario 
involved, for instance, regionalized measures of population, 
economic development, and energy efficiency, the availability 
of various forms of energy, agricultural productivity, and local 
pollution controls. Each participating modeling group (see 
above) used computer models and their experience in the 
assessment of long-range 
development 
of economic, 
technological, and environmental systems to generate 
quantifications of the storylines. The models used to develop 
the scenarios are: 
• 
Asian Pacific Integrated Model (AIM) from the 
National Institute of Environmental Studies (NIES) in 
Japan (Morita et a l , 1994). 
• 
Atmospheric Stabilization Framework Model (ASF) 
from ICF Consulting in the US (Lashof and Tirpak, 
1990; Pepper et a l , 1998; Sankovski et a l . , 2000). 
• 
Integrated Model to Assess the Greenhouse Effect 
(IMAGE) from the National Institute for Public Health 
and Hygiene (RIVM) in the Netherlands (Alcamo et 
a l , 1998; de Vries et a l . , 1994, 1999, 2000), used in 
connection with the Central Plarming Bureau (СРВ) 
WortdScan model (de Jong and Zalm, 1991), the 
Netherlands. 
• 
Multiregional Approach for Resource and Industry 
Allocation (MARIA) from the Science University of 
Tokyo in Japan (Mori and Takahashi, 1999; Mori, 
2000). 
• 
Model for Energy Supply Strategy Alternatives and 
their General Environmental Impact (MESSAGE) from 
the International Institute of AppHed Systems Analysis 
(IIASA) in Austria (Messner and Strubegger, 1995; 
Riahi and Roehrl, 2000). 
• 
The Mini Cfimate Assessment Model (MiniCAM) from 
the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in 
the USA (Edmonds e t a l , 1994, 1996a, 1996b). 
A more detailed description of the modeling approaches is 
given in Appendix IV. Some modeling teams developed 
scenarios that reflected all four storylines, while some 
presented scenarios for fewer storylines. Some scenarios share 
hannonized^ input assumptions of main scenario drivers, such 
as population, economic growth, and final energy use, with 
their respective designated marker scenarios of the four 
scenario families and underlying storyhnes (see Section 4.4.1). 
Others explore scenario sensitivities in titese driving forces 
through alternative interpretations 
of the four scenario 
storylines. Table 4-1 lists all SRES scenarios, by modeling 
group and by scenario family, and indicates which scenarios 
share harmonized input assumptions of important driving 
forces of emissions at the global level and at the level of the 
four SRES regions. Altogether, the six modeling teams 
formulated 40 alternative SRES scenarios 
All the qualitative and quantitative features of scenarios that 
belong to the same family were set to conform to the 
corresponding 
features 
of 
the 
underlying 
storyline. 
Quantitative storyline targets recommended for use in all 
scenarios within a given family included, in particular, 
population and GDP growth assumptions. Most scenarios 
developed within a given family follow these storyline 
recommendations, 
but some scenarios offer 
alternative 
interpretations. Scenarios within each family vary quite 
substantially in such characteristics as the assumptions about 
availability of fossil-fuel resources, the rate of energy-
efficiency improvements, the extent of renewable-energy 
development, and, hence, resultant G H G emissions. This 
variation reflects the modeling teams' altemative views on the 
plausible global and regional developments and also stems 
from differences in the underlying modeling approaches. After 
the modeling teams had quantified the key driving forces and 
made an effort to harmonize them with the storylines by 
' The harmonization criteria agreed by the writing team are indicated 
in Table 4-1. The classification of scenarios is quite robust against 
varying the percentage deviation harmonization criteria (see Section 
4.4.1).

" The A I T scenarios explored cases of increased energy end-use efficiency and therefore share similar levels of energy services, but not final 
energy, with the A l marker scenario. As this was an agreed upon (different) feature of this particular scenario group compared to that of the 
A l marker, the final energy harmonization criteria does not apply by design. If final energy use is excluded as harmonization criteria for the 
scenarios of the A I T scenario group the number of harmonized scenarios increases to 13 (four SRES regions and worid level) and 17 (worid 
level only), respectively. 
I' A l v l - M i n i C A M , Alv2-MiniCAM, and A 2 - A l - M i n i C A M became available only late in the process (after the 15 July 1999 deadline). 
Intentionally, they describe futures that ai'e quite different in character from the other scenaiios in their respective families and are therefore 
only to a limited degree comparable to other scenarios of the A l and A2 scenario families. 
The IMAGE-resuhs for the A2 and B2 scenarios are based on preliminary model experiments done in March 1998. Due to limited resources 
it has not been possible to redo these experiments. Hence, the IMAGE-team is not able to provide background data and details for these 
scenario calculations and the population and economic growth assumptions are not fully harmonized, as is the case for the IMAGE A l and 
B l scenarios. 
•* Deviations from harmonization criteria in one time period are not considered in this classification. 
adjusting control parameters, possible diversity still remained 
(see Section 4.4.1). 
In addition, the A l scenario family developed into different 
distinct scenario groups, each based on the A l storyline that 
describes alternative developments in future energy systems, 
from carbon-intensive development to decarbonization (see 
footnote 1). (Similar storyline variations were considered for 
other scenario families, but were pursued only to a limited 
degree in scenario sensitivity analysis in order to limit the 
number of scenarios.) This further increased the richness in 
different GHG emissions paths, because this variation in the 
structure of the future energy system in itself resulted in a 
range of emissions almost as large as that generated through 
the variation of other main driving forces, such as population 
and economic development. The differentiation into various 
scenario groups was introduced into the A l storyline because 
of its "high growth with high technology" nature, in which 
differences in alternative technology developments translate 
into large differences in future GHG emission levels. 
As for the storylines, no single scenario was treated as more or 
less "probable" than others belonging to the same family. 
However, after requests from various user communities to 
reduce the number of scenarios to a manageable size, a single 
scenario within a family was selected as a representative case 
to illusfrate a particular storyline on the basis of the modeling 
teams' consensus. These scenarios were named "marker 
scenarios" or simply "markers" and were put on the SRES 
open process webpage for review. The marker scenario for the 
AI scenario storyline was developed using the A I M model; for 
the A2 storyhne using the ASF model; for the B l storyline 
using the IMAGE model; and finally for the B2 storyline using 
the MESSAGE model (see Table 4-1). 
The choice of the markers was based on extensive discussion 
within the SRES team: 
• 
Which of the initial quantifications (by the models) 
reflected the story best. 
• 
Preference of some of the modeling teams and features 
of specific models. 
• 
Range of emissions across all the markers. 
• 
Use of different models for the four markers. 
In 1998, the preliminary descriptions and quantifications of the 
marker scenarios were posted on the SRES website for the 
open process and, in accordance with a decision of the IPCC 
Bureau, were in this way made available to climate modelers 
for their input in the Third Assessment Report. As a result of 
the inputs and comments received through the open process 
and by the entire writing team, the marker scenarios have been 
successively refined and improved without changmg their 
fundamental characteristics in terms of impoitant scenario 
A n O v e r v i e w of S c e n a r i o s 
drivmg forces (population, GDP) and order of magnitude of 
GHG emissions. Subsequently, additional scenarios within 
each scenario family were developed to explore the sensitivity 
of adoptmg alternative quantitative scenario input assumptions 
on future G H G emissions. As a result the markers are not 
necessarily the median or mean of a scenario family (nor 
would it be possible to construct such a median or mean 
scenario by taking all salient scenario characteristics and 
regional results into account). The markers are simply those 
scenarios considered by the SRES writing team as illustrative 
of a particular storyline. They are not singled out as more 
likely than alternative quantitative interpretations of a 
particular scenario family and its underlying storyline. 
Perhaps they may be best described as "first among equals." 
However, as a result of time and resource limitations the 
marker scenarios have received the closest scrutiny from the 
entire writing team and through the SRES open process 
compared to other scenario quantifications. The marker 
scenarios are also the SRES scenarios most intensively tested 
m terms of leproducibility. As a rule, at least four different 
models were used in attempts to replicate the model 
quantification of a particular marker scenario. Available time 
and resources did not allow a similar exercise to be conducted 
for all SRES scenarios, albeit a more limited effort was 
devoted to reproduce the A l scenario groups (next to the A l 
marker) with different models. 
To enable a comparison of the resultant GHG emissions, the 
writing team decided to define a subset of harmonized 
scenarios within each family that share common main scenario 
driving-force assumptions, such as population or GDP growth. 
Two harmonization criteria were developed (see also Section 
4.4.1). This procedure and the harmonization criteria were 
adopted in a joint agreement among the six SRES modeling 
teams. 
"Fully harmonized" scenarios are those that share important 
driving force variables, including population, GDP, and final 
energy use for each of the four SRES regions and the world 
(according to the quantitative criteria listed in Table 4-1). Fully 
harmonized scenaiios by definition include the respective 
marker scenario. From 40 scenarios 11 are classified as 
scenarios with "full harmonization." For each scenario family 
at least two scenarios are harmonized using the most restiictive 
criteria. This also applies to the scenario groups within the A l 
scenario family, which correspondingly has the highest number 
of fully harmonized scenarios. This subset of 
"fully 
harmonized" 
scenarios 
serves 
to 
provide 
a 
better 
correspondence between the development of the tliree main 
driving forces and the resultant G H G emissions. The "fully 
harmonized" scenarios thus demonstrate the degree by which a 
particular marker scenario is reproducible by alternative 
modeling approaches. Therefore, "fully harmonized" scenaiios 
are not independent from each other within a particular 
scenario family (or scenario group in case of Al). 
"Globally hannonized" scenarios are those that share global 
population and GDP profiles within the agreed upon bounds of 
5% and 10%, respectively, over the period 1990-2100^ (see 
Table 4-1). Altogether 26'^ scenarios are categorized into this 
category and can be considered to capture the main global 
development characteristics over time for each respective 
scenario family and storyline. Again these 26 scenarios are not 
independent from each other, constituting seven distinct 
scenario groups (see also footnote 1). 
Thus, there are three different types of scenarios within each 
family; 
• 
One marker and a set of "fully harmonized" scenarios 
that attempt to replicate the marker 
scenario 
quantification. 
• 
A set of "globally harmonized" scenaiios. 
• 
A set of non-harmonized scenarios. 
In addition, two illustrative scenarios have been selected in the 
Summary for Policymakers (SPM) from the additional A l 
scenario groups (see also footnote 1). 
For the sake of simplicity, the teirn "harmonized" is used 
herein to describe global harmonization of population and 
GDP growth. "Fully harmonized" scenarios, for which the 
main objective is to assess the reproducibility of particular 
marker scenario quantifications and any remaining uncertainty 
in GHG emissions from internal model parametrizations, are 
referred to in the text where appropriate. Figure 4-3 shows the 
SRES scenarios as a set consisting of subsets that correspond 
to the four families. The A l family is in addition divided into 
different groups of scenarios. The detailed descriptions of 
inputs and outputs (other than GHG emissions) of the SRES 
markei scenarios, other harmonized scenarios, and other 
scenarios are presented in Section 4.4 (see Appendix VII for 
further numeric detail). The emissions of GHGs and other 
radiatively important species of gases are described ш Chapter 
5 (more detail is again presented in Appendix VII). 
Table 4-2 summarizes the main characteristics of the four 
SRES scenario families and their scenario groups, and gives an 
overview about the numbet of scenarios that were developed 
for each scenario group (see also Table 4-1 and Section 4.4.1). 
4.3. 
Scenario Storylines 
Although each of the four SRES storylines can unfold only if 
certain values are emphasized more than others, no explicit 
Deviauons withm each 10-year time period are not considered. 
"* AdditionaUy, three scenarios (A2-AIM. A 2 - M i n i C A M , and B 2 -
MuuCAM) deviate only slighdy from the global 
hannomzaUon 
criteria for between two to three time steps. Hence these scenarios can 
be considered as 'almost' harmonized and comparable with the olhei 
harmonized scenarios.

Figure 4-3: Schematic illustration of the multidimensional classification space of SRES scenarios. The set of scenarios 
consists of four scenario families (Al, A2, B l , and B2), each of which consists of a number of scenarios. Some of these have 
"hannonized" inputs - they share similar pre-specified global population and GDP trajectories. They are marked as "HS" for 
(globally) harmonized scenarios. All other scenarios of the same family based on the quantification of the storyline chosen by 
the modeling team are marked as "OS." The A l family is divided into four scenario groups that explore altemative 
developments in the future energy sector. These were merged into three groups in the SPM (see also footnote 1). Finally, one 
of the harmonized scenarios is designated as the characteristic representative of each family and is the marker scenario. 
judgments have been made by the SRES team as to their 
desirability or probability. Storylines in the literature, however, 
are often explicitly intended by their authors to have a positive 
or negative connotation, and sometimes explicitly include 
assumed dominant or preferred types of governance. Thus, the 
four SRES storylines are fundamentally different in this 
respect compared to many narrative scenarios in the underlying 
literature. 
Two 
arguments are pertinent to the linkage between the 
scenario storylines and the underlying literature. First, a 
future regarded as negative by some people may be perceived 
as positive by others. Second, the storylines represent families 
of scenarios that can include both success and failure, 
depending on the perspective of the beholder. To quote 
Wilkerson (1995): "Like the real life from which they are 
drawn, the scenarios are mixed bags, at once wonderfully 
dreadful and dreadfully wonderful." Importantly, the 
"neutral" or "agnostic" character of SRES scenarios is an 
explicit departure from most of the underlying literature about 
storylines and narrative scenarios. 
Another important departure and an innovation unique to the 
SRES approach is the use of the storylines in conjunction with 
multiple (six) modeling approaches to develop and formulate a 
set of quantifications or scenarios that are overall consistent 
with the underlying storylines. This approach provides a 
rigorous modeling test of the underlying logic and structure of 
the storyline, while the naffative aspect of the storyline 
provides a broader, descriptive context for better understanding 
and interpretation of the scenarios. 
4 . 3 . 1 . 
A l Storyline 
and Scenario 
F a m i l y 
The A l storyline is a case of rapid and successful economic 
development, in which regional average income per capita 
converge - current distinctions between "poor" and "rich" 
countries eventually dissolve. The primary dynamics are: 
• 
Strong commitment to market-based solutions. 
• 
High savings and commitment to education at the 
household level. 
• 
High rates of investment and innovation in education, 
technology, and institutions at the national and 
intemational levels. 
• 
Intemational mobility of people, ideas, and technology. 
1 8 0 
A n O v e r v i e w of S c e n a r i o s 
The transition to economic convergence results from advances 
in transport and communication technology, shifts in national 
policies on immigration and education, and international 
cooperation in the development of national and international 
institutions that enhance productivity growth and technology 
diffusion. 
This may be the type of scenario best represented in recent 
literature (e.g., Shinn, 1985; UN, 1990; Schwartz, 1991; 
Peterson, 1994; Gallopin et a l . , 1997; Glenn and Gordon, 
1997, 
1999; Lawrence e t a l . , 1997; Hammond, 1998; Raskin et 
a l . , 1998). Such scenarios are dominated by an American or 
European entrepreneurial, progress-oriented perspective in 
which technology, especially communication technology, plays 
a central role. Wilkerson (1995) designed various scenarios 
that share features with A l . They emphasize market-oriented 
solutions, high consumption of both tangible and intangible 
commodities, advanced technology, and intensive mobility and 
communication. In some examples of this type of scenario, 
high economic growth leads to shifts of economic power from 
traditional core countries to the current economic "periphery," 
as in the "Global Shift" scenario by СРВ (1992) and de Jong 
and Zalm (1991). The Shell scenario "New Frontiers" (Shell, 
1993) is also representative of this family. The IPCC Scenarios 
lS92a and IS92e are well-known examples of futures with high 
levels of economic growth (Leggett et a i , 1992). IIASA and 
World Energy Council (WEC) jointly developed three High 
Growth 
Scenarios 
that 
share 
assumptions 
on 
rapid 
technological progress, liberalized trade markets, and rising 
income levels (Nakicenovic et a l . , 1998). 
In the A l scenario family, demographic and economic trends 
are closely linked, as affluence is conelated with long life and 
small families (low mortality and low fertility). Global 
population grows to some nine billion by 2050 and declines to 
about seven billion by 2100. Average age increases, with the 
needs of retned people met mainly through their accumulated 
savings in private pension systems. 
The global economy expands at an average amiual rate of about 
3% 
to 2100, reaching around US$550 trillion (all dollar 
amounts herein are expressed in 1990 dollars, unless stated 
otherwise). This is approximately the same as average global 
growth since 1850, although the conditions that lead to this 
global growth in productivity and per capita incomes in the 
scenario are unparalleled in history. Global average income per 
capita reaches about US$21,000 by 2050. While the high 
average level of income per capita contributes to a great 
improvement in the overall health and social conditions of the 
majority of people, this world is not necessarily devoid of 
problems. In particular, many communities could face some of 
the problems of social exclusion encountered in the wealthiest 
countries during the 20''' century, and in many places income 
growth could produce increased pressure on the global 
commons. 
Energy and mineral resources are abundant in this scenario 
family because of rapid technical progress, which both reduces 
the resources needed to produce a given level of output and 
increases the economically recoverable reserves. Final energy 
intensity (energy use per unit of GDP) decreases at an average 
annual rate of 1.3%. Environmental amenities are valued and 
rapid technological progress "frees" natural resources currently 
devoted to provision of human needs for other purposes. The 
concept of environmental quality changes in this storyline from 
the current emphasis on "conservation" of nature to active 
"management" of natural and environmental services, which 
increases écologie resilience. 
With the rapid increase in income, dietary patterns shift 
initially toward increased consumption of meat and dairy 
products, but may decrease subsequenfly with increasing 
emphasis on the health of an aging society. High incomes also 
translate into high car ownership, sprawling suburbia, and 
dense transport networks, nationally and internationally. 
Several scenario groups considered in the A l scenario family 
reflect uncertainty in the development of energy sources and 
conversion technologies in this rapidly changing world. Some 
scenario groups evolve along the carbon-intensive energy path 
consistent with the current development strategy of countries 
with abundant domestic coal resources. Other scenario groups 
intensify the dependence on (unconventional) oil and (in the 
longer-run) natural-gas resources^. A third group envisages a 
stronger 
shift 
toward renewable 
energy 
sources 
and 
conceivably also toward nuclear energy. A fourth group (which 
includes the AIB marker scenario) assumes a balanced mix of 
technologies 
and 
supply 
sources, 
with 
technology 
improvements and resource assumptions such that no single 
source of energy is overly dominant. The implications of these 
alternative development paths for future G H G emissions are 
challenging; the emissions vary from the carbon-intensive to 
decarbonization paths by at least as much as the variation of all 
the other driving forces across the other SRES scenarios. 
4.3.2. 
A 2 Storyline 
and Scenario 
F a m i l y 
The A2 scenario family represents a differentiated world. 
Compared to the A l storyline it is characterized by lower trade 
flows, relatively slow capital stock turnover, and slower 
technological change. The A2 world "consolidates" into a 
series of economic regions. Self-reliance in terms of resources 
and less emphasis on economic, social, and cultural 
interactions between regions are characteristic for this future. 
Economic growth is uneven and the income gap between now-
industrialized and developing parts of the world does not 
narrow, unlike in the A l and B l scenario families. 
'The coal and gas/oil intensive groups were merged into one fossil-
intensive group in the Summary for Policymakers. M o r e detailed 
information on these two groups is presented here, in Chapter 5 and 
in Appendix VII. 
A n O v e r v i e w of 
S c e n a r i o s 
1 8 1 
The A2 world has less intemational cooperation than the A l or 
B l worlds. People, ideas, and capital are less mobile so that 
technology diffuses more slowly than in the other scenario 
families. Intemational disparities in productivity, and hence 
income per capita, are largely maintained or increased in 
absolute terms. With the emphasis on family and community 
life, fertility rates decline relatively slowly, which makes the 
A2 population the largest among the storylines (15 billion by 
2100). Global average per capita income in A2 is low relative 
to other storylines (especially A l and B l ) , reaching about 
US$7200 per capita by 2050 and US$16,000 in 2100. By 2100 
the global GDP reaches about US$250 trillion. Technological 
change in the A2 scenario world is also more heterogeneous 
than that in A l . It is more rapid than average in some regions 
and slower in others, as industry adjusts to local resource 
endowments, culture, and education levels. Regions with 
abundant energy and mineral resources evolve more resource-
intensive economies, while those poor in resources place a very 
high priority on minimizing import dependence through 
technological innovation to improve resource efficiency and 
make use of substitute inputs. The fuel mix in different regions 
is determined primarily by resource availability. High-income 
but resource-poor regions shift toward advanced post-fossil 
technologies (renewables or nuclear), while low-income 
resource-rich 
regions 
generally rely on older 
fossil 
technologies. Final energy intensities in A2 decline with a pace 
of 0.5 to 0.7% per year. 
In the A2 world, social and political structures diversify; some 
regions move toward stronger welfare systems and reduced 
income inequality, while others move toward "leaner" 
government and more heterogeneous income distributions. 
With substantial food requirements, agricultural productivity in 
the A2 world is one of the main focus areas for innovation and 
research, development, and deployment (RD&D) efforts, and 
environmental concems. Initial high levels of soil erosion and 
water pollution are eventually eased through the local 
development of more sustainable high-yield agriculture. 
Although attention is given to potential local and regional 
environmental damage, it is not uniform across regions. Global 
environmental concems are relatively weak, although attempts 
are made to bring regional and local pollution under control 
and to maintain environmental amenities. 
As in other SRES storylines, the intention in this storyline is 
not to imply that the underlying dynamics of A2 are either 
good or bad. The literature suggests that such a world could 
have many positive aspects from the current perspective, such 
as the increasing tendency toward cultural pluralism with 
mutual acceptance of diversity and fundamental differences. 
Various scenarios from the literature may be grouped under 
this scenario family. For example, "New Empires" by Schwartz 
(1991) is an example of a society in which most nations protect 
their threatened cultural identities. Some regions might achieve 
relative stability while others suffer under civil disorders 
(Schwartz, 1996). In "European Renaissance" (de Jong and 
Zalm, 1991; СРВ, 1992), economic growth slows down 
because of a strengthening of protectionist trade blocks. In 
"Imperial Harmonization" (Lawrence et a l . , 1997), major 
economic blocs impose standards and regulations on smaller 
countries. The Shell scenario "Global Mercantilism" (1989, 
see Schwartz, 1991) explores the possibility of regional 
spheres of influence, whereas "Barricades" (Shell, 1993) 
reflects resistance to globalizaflon and liberalization of 
markets. Noting the tensions that arise as societies adopt 
western technology without western culture, Hunrington 
(1996) suggests that conflicts between civilizations rather than 
globalizing economies may determine the geo-political future 
of the world. 
4 . 3 . 3 . 
B l Storyline 
and Scenario 
F a m i l y 
The central elements of the B l future are a high level of 
environmental and social consciousness combined with a 
globally coherent approach to a more sustainable development. 
Heightened environmental consciousness might be brought 
about by clear evidence that impacts of natural resource use, 
such as deforestation, soil depletion, over-fishing, and global 
and regional pollution, pose a serious threat to the continuation 
of human life on Earth. In the B l storyline, govemments. 
businesses, the media, and the public pay increased attention to 
the environmental and social aspects of development. 
Technological change plays an important role. At the same 
time, however, the storyline does not include any climate 
policies, to reflect the SRES terms of reference. Nevertheless, 
such a possible future cannot be ruled out. 
The "Conventional Worlds-Policy Reform" scenario by 
Gallopin et a l . (1997) is a good example of such a future, 
although it includes climate policies. In "Ecotopia," Wilkerson 
(1995) describes a reaction to early decades of crime and 
chaos, in which community values triumph over individualist 
ones arid lead to resource-friendly lifestyles based on clean and 
light technologies. This scenario includes a voluntary embrace 
of cohesion, cooperation, and reduced consumption, backed by 
legislation and even corporate policies (Wilkerson, 1995). In 
the nonnative "Human Development Success" (Glenn and 
Gordon, 1997), the world achieves an environmentally 
sustainable economy by 2050, primarily through education to 
develop human potential. In "Balanced Future" (de Jong and 
Zalm, 1991; СРВ, 1992), economic equilibrium and innovation 
lead to sustainable development. The "Ecologically Driven" 
scenarios by WEC (1993) and IIASA-WEC (Nakicenovic et 
a i , 1998) - with accelerated efficiency improvements in 
resource use - share several of the characteristics of the B l 
type of future, as does the egalitarian utopia scenario in the 
TARGETS approach (Rotmans and de Vries, 1997). 
Many additional scenarios in the literature could be seen as 
examples of this family, but may describe the changes as more 
fundamental than those of В1. The "Transformed World" of 
Hammond (1998), based on the "Great Transitions" scenario of 
Gallopin et a l . (1997), stresses the role of global technological 
innovation in addition to enlightened corporate actions, 
govemment policies, and empowerment of local groups. In 
182 
A n O v e r v i e w of 
S c e n a r i o s 
"Shared Space" by the Millennium Institute (Glenn and 
Gordon, 1997), resources are shared more equitably to the 
benefit of all and the greater safety of humanity. The Shell 
scenario "Sustainable World" (1989, see Schwartz, 1991) and 
the World Business Council for Sustainable Development 
scenarios (WBCSD, 1998), "Geopolity" and "Jazz," examine 
sustainable futures. 
Economic development in B l is balanced, and efforts to 
achieve equitable income distribution are effective. As in A l , 
the B l storyline describes a fast-changing and convergent 
world, but the priorities differ. Whereas the A l world invests its 
gains from increased productivity and know-how primarily in 
further economic growth, the B l world invests a large part of 
its 
gains 
in 
improved 
efficiency 
of 
resource 
use 
("dematerialization"), 
equity, 
social 
institutions, 
and 
environmental protection. 
A strong welfare net prevents social exclusion on the basis of 
poverty. However, counter-currents may develop and in some 
places people may not conform to the main social and 
environmental intentions of the mainstream in this scenario 
family. Massive income redistribution and presumably high 
taxation levels may adversely affect the economic efficiency 
and functioning of world markets. 
Particular effort is devoted to increases in resource efficiency to 
achieve the goals stated above. Incentive systems, combined 
with advances in intemational institutions, permit the rapid 
diffusion of cleaner technology. To this end, R & D is also 
enhanced, together with education and the capacity building 
for clean and equitable development. Organizational measures 
are adopted to reduce material wastage by maximizing reuse 
and recycling. The combination of technical and organizational 
change yields high levels of material and energy saving, as well 
as reductions in pollution. Labor productivity also improves as 
a by-product of these efforts. Altemative scenarios considered 
within the ВI family include different rates of GDP growth and 
dematerialization (e.g., decline in energy and material 
intensities). 
The demographic transition to low mortality and fertility 
occurs at the same rate as in A l , but for different reasons as it 
is motivated partly by social and environmental concems. 
Global population reaches nine bilUon by 2050 and declines to 
about seven bilUon by 2100. This is a world with high levels of 
economic activity (a global GDP of around US$350 trillion by 
2100) and significant and deliberate progress toward 
intemational and national income equality. Global income per 
capita in 2050 averages US$13,000, one-third lower than in 
AI. A higher proportion of this income is spent on services 
rather than on material goods, and on quality rather than 
quantity, because the emphasis on material goods is less and 
also resource prices are increased by environmental taxation. 
The ВI storyline sees a relatively smooth transition to 
alternative energy systems as conventional oil and gas 
resources decline. There is extensive use of conventional and 
unconventional gas as the cleanest fossil resource during the 
transition, but the major push is toward post-fossil 
technologies, driven in large part by environmental concems. 
Given the high environmental consciousness and institutional 
effectiveness in the ВI storyline, environmental quality is high, 
as most potentially negative environmental aspects of rapid 
development are anticipated and effectively dealt with locally, 
nationally, and internationally. For example, transboundary air 
pollution (acid rain) is basically eliminated in the long term. 
Land use is managed carefully to counteract the impacts of 
activities potentially damaging to the environment. Cities are 
compact and designed for public and non-motorized transport, 
with suburban developments tightly controlled. Strong 
incentives for low-input, low-impact agriculture, along with 
maintenance of large areas of wilderness, contribute to high 
food prices with much lower levels çf meat consumption than 
those in AI. These proactive local and regional environmental 
measures and policies also lead to relatively low G H G 
emissions, even in the absence of explicit interventions to 
mitigate cHmate change. 
4 . 3 . 4 . 
B 2 Storyline 
and Scenario 
F a m i l y 
The B2 world is one of increased concem for environmental 
and social sustainability compared to the A2 storyline. 
Increasingly, government policies and business strategies at the 
national and local levels are influenced by environmentally 
aware citizens, with a trend toward local self-reliance and 
stronger communities. Intemational institutions decline in 
importance, with a shift toward local and regional decision-
making stractures and institutions. Human welfare, equality, 
and environmental protection all have high priority, and they 
are addressed through community-based social solutions in 
addition to technical solutions, although implementation rates 
vary across regions. 
Like the other scenario families, the B2 scenario family 
includes futures that can be seen as positive or negative. While 
the B2 storyline is basically neutral. Kinsman (1990) in his 
"Caring Autonomy" scenario clearly paints a positive world 
with emphasis on decentralized govemments and strong 
inteфersonal relationships. In the "New Civics" scenario by 
Wilkerson (1995), values are only shared within small 
competing groups, which resuhs in a decentraHzed world of 
tribes, clans, families, networks, and gangs. The IIASA-WEC 
"Middle Course" scenario (Nakicenovic et a l . , 1998), with 
slow removal of trade barriers, may also be grouped in this 
family. On the positive side, this storyline appears to be 
consistent with current institutional frameworks in the world 
and with the current technology dynamics. On the negative side 
is the relatively slow rate of development in general, but 
particularly in the currentiy developing parts of the world. 
Education and welfare programs are pursued widely, which 
reduces mortality and, to a lesser extent, fertility. The 
population reaches about 10 bilHon people by 2100, consistent 
with both the U N and IIASA median projections. Income per 
A n O v e r v i e w of S c e n a r i o s 
183 
capita grows at an intermediate rate to reach about US$12,000 
by 2050. By 2100 the global economy might expand to reach 
some US$250 trillion. International income differences 
decrease, although not as rapidly as in storylines of higher 
global convergence. Local inequity is reduced considerably 
through the development of stronger community-support 
networks. 
Generally, high educational levels promote both development 
and 
environmental protection. 
Indeed, 
environmental 
protection is one of the few truly intemational common 
priorities that remain iit B2. However, strategies to address 
global environmental challenges are not of a central priority 
and are thus less successful compared to local and regional 
environmental response strategies. The govemments have 
difficulty designing and implementing agreements that 
combine global environmental protection, even when this 
could be associated with mutual economic benefits. 
The B2 storyline presents a particularly favorable climate for 
community initiative and social innovation, especially in view 
of the high educational levels. Technological frontiers are 
pushed less than they are in A l and B l , and innovations are 
also regionally more heterogeneous. Globally, investment in 
energy R&D continues its curtent declining trend (EIA, 1997, 
1999), and mechanisms for international diffusion of 
technology and know-how remain weaker than in scenarios A l 
and B l (but higher than in A2). Some regions with rapid 
economic development and limited natural resources place 
particular emphasis on technology development and bilateral 
cooperation. Technical change is therefore uneven. The energy 
intensity of GDP declines at about 1% per year, in line with the 
average historical experience since 1800. 
Land-use management becomes better integrated at the local 
level in the B2 world. Urban and transport infrastmcture is a 
particular focus of community innovation, and contributes to a 
low 
level of car dependence and less urban sprawl. An 
emphasis on food self-reliance contributes to a shift in dietary 
pattems toward local products, with relatively low meat 
consumption in countries with high population densities. 
Energy systems differ from region to region, depending on the 
availability of natural resources. The need to use energy and 
other resources more efficiently spurs the development of less 
carbon-intensive technology in some regions. Environment 
policy cooperation at the regional level leads to success in the 
management of some transboundary environmental problems, 
such as acidification caused by sulfur dioxide (SOj), especially 
to sustain regional self-reliance in agricultural production. 
Regional cooperation also results in lower emissions of 
nitrogen oxides (N0^^) and volatile organic compounds 
(VOCs), which reduce the incidence of elevated tropospheric 
ozone levels. Although globally the energy system remains 
predominantly hydrocarbon-based to 2100, a gradual transition 
occurs away from the current share of fossil resources in world 
energy supply, with a corresponding reduction in carbon 
uitensity.

4 . 4 . 1 . 
Scenario 
Terminology 
In this section representative quantifications of the four 
scenario storylines described in Section 4.3 are summarized, 
and the evolution of the main scenario driving forces and 
associated quantitative scenario characteristics are described. 
Their resultant GHG and other emissions are discussed in more 
detail in Chapter 5. 
To elucidate differences in uncertainties that stem both from 
adopting alternative (exogenous) scenario driving-force 
assumptions and from the uncertainties that arise from 
different 
model 
representations, 
alternative 
scenario 
quantifications are differentiated into harmonized and 
unharmonized scenarios (see Section 4.2, Tables 4-1 and 4-2, 
and Box 1-1 for terminology description). 
To achieve harmonization across six different modeling 
approaches is not a tiivial task. For example, most of the 
models have different regional disaggregations, so that 
harmonization at the level of the four SRES regions required 
some "inverse" solutions, often achieved through iterative 
model mns and adjustments of input assumptions. Also, in 
some 
modeling frameworks 
the 
harmonized "input" 
parameters are actually outputs of components of the modeling 
framework (e.g., GDP as an output of economic general 
equilibrium models, or final energy as an output variable after 
considering endogenous energy prices and exogenously pre-
specified energy-intensity improvement rates). Therefore, 
harmonization of important scenario driving-force inputs was 
neither possible for all scenarios and for all participating 
modeling teams, and nor was it judged desirable, as the 
adoption of any harmonization criterion somewhat artificially 
compresses 
uncertainty. 
This 
is 
also 
why 
simpler 
harmonization criteria were adopted (see Section 4.2. above) 
that focused on global population and GDP growth profiles. 
These are referred to as "globally harmonized" scenarios in 
the subsequent Subsections. 
From the 40 SRES scenarios, 26 are classified as "globally 
harmonized" scenarios and 14 are classified as "other" 
scenarios. (The latter category includes three scenarios that 
only deviate slightly from the harmonization criteria.) 
Harmonized scenarios are thus comparable in that they 
describe similar global development pattems with respect to 
demographics and economic growth. In the subsequent 
discussion of scenario driving forces a three-tiered structure is 
adopted. First, for each scenario family (and where applicable 
for 
each scenario group in the A l scenario family), the 
discussion starts with a presentation of the respective marker 
and "fully harmonized" scenarios. Subsequentiy, "globally 
harmonized" scenarios and "other" scenarios are discussed. 
"Globally harmonized" scenarios shed additional light into 
uncertainties that stem from adopting different regional 
assumptions (see above). Finally, "other" scenarios are 
presented that offer a different quantitative interpretation of a 
1 8 4 
A n O v e r v i e w of S c e n a r i o s 
particular scenario storyline compared to the previous scenario 
categories. In some cases, differences in interpretation relate to 
uncertainties in rates of change - "other" scenarios yield 
similar global demographic and economic outcomes by 2100 
(e.g. the B2-ASF scenario compared to the B2 marker), but 
illustrate different dynamics of how these could unfold. In 
other cases, the "other" scenario category comprises scenario 
quantifications 
that 
deliberately 
explore 
alternative 
interpretations of a scenario storyline in terms of global 
population and GDP growth altogether (e.g. in the A2-A1-
MiniCAM scenario). The reason is to indicate that quantitative 
scenario descriptions entail a high degree of uncertainty (and 
subjectivity from different modeling teams) when it comes to 
interpret the four different qualitative SRES scenario storylines 
and to translate them into the quantitative assumptions that 
drive emission models. When comparing G H G emissions 
results for the four SRES marker scenarios (see Chapter 5) 
with those of the other SRES scenarios, it is illustrative to 
distinguish the effects of different model methodologies and 
parametrizations from variations of important scenario drivers 
that often serve as exogenous input to models. 
Of the total of 40 SRES scenarios, 29 (including the marker 
scenarios) satisfy the harmonization criteria for population on 
the world level a n d for all four SRES regions, 12 scenarios are 
harmonized for population and GDP, and U (13 including the 
AIT scenario group) scenarios are harmonized for population, 
GDP 
a n d final energy (see Table 4-1). Also, 35 scenarios are 
harmonized for population on the world level and 26 scenarios 
are harmonized for global population and GDP (see Table 4-1). 
The status of harmonization is also relatively stable to changes 
in the harmonization criteria. For example, if the above 
harmonization criteria were increased by 50% (i.e. GDP for the 
four SRES regions may differ by up to ±38% from the 
respective GDP of the marker scenario), the sample of 11 
h a r m o n i z e d scenarios does not change; however, the number of 
scenarios harmonized on the g l o b a l level increases from 15 to 
20. 
Thus, as mentioned above not all scenario quantifications 
comply with the adopted harmonization criteria differences in 
regional coverage and definition among models. In some 
instances modeling teams also deliberately chose not to follow 
harmonized input assumptions, but instead explored scenario 
sensitivities by emphasizing alternative developments than 
suggested in the marker scenario quantification. The writing 
team recognizes that this increases the number of scenarios as 
well as complexity in the interpretation of resuhs. These 
additional scenarios are the result of the SRES terms of 
reference of proceeding via an open process soliciting as wide 
participation and viewpoints as possible and also serve the 
purpose of highlighting important uncertainties of the future 
that are necessarily compressed by limiting scenario 
quantification to four illustrative marker scenarios. Thus, while 
unharmonized scenarios illustrate the impact on G H G 
emissions of expanding the uncertainty range of main scenario 
drivers within any particular scenario family, the "globally 
harmonized" scenarios indicate the range of GHG emissions 
uncertainty that remains after 
most important global driving 
force 
assumptions 
(population and GDP) have 
been 
harmonized. (Finally, the range of GHG emissions resulting 
from comparing "fully harmonized" scenarios is indicative of 
the uncertainty of internal model parametrizations such as 
energy technology change, dietary patterns, and agricultural 
productivity changes that influence structural changes in energy 
supply and end-use and land-use changes, see Table 4-1.) 
Harmonization 
of 
input 
assumptions 
increases 
the 
comparability across scenarios and can serve as an additional 
guide for choosing a particular SRES scenaiio subset, and to 
illustrate different degrees of scenario uncertainty. The latter is 
an 
important 
aspect, considering the 
different 
user 
communities of SRES scenarios. Given the comparatively 
naiTow variation as defined by the harmonization criteria, 
differences in population, GDP, and final energy use between 
harmonized scenarios of the same scenario family need not to 
be considered in subsequent analyses and are also not 
discussed separately below. 
In the A I scenario family, the scenarios within one group were 
also harmonized. In one A l scenario group the transition away 
from conventional oil and gas either leads to a massive 
development of unconventional oil and gas resources (AIG) or 
to a large-scale synfuel economy based on coal (AlC). Please 
note that A l C and A I G were combined into one fossil 
intensive group A l F I in the Summary for Policymakers during 
its approval process (see also footnote I). GHG emissions in 
these scenarios approach emissions characteristic of the A2 
scenario family (i.e. are much higher than in the case of the A l 
marker scenario). In another A l scenario group, dwindling 
conventional oil and gas resources lead to fast development of 
post-fossil alternatives and enhanced energy conservation. In 
this technology-intensive scenario group (AIT), energy 
demands are lower than in the other A l scenario groups and, 
because of radical technological change in energy systems, 
GHG emissions are much lower than in the other A l scenario 
groups (including the A I B marker scenario), approaching 
those of the В1 scenario family. 
The six modeling teams also produced other scenarios as part 
of the SRES open process. These modeling runs were generally 
not harmonized and are presented as appropriate later in the 
report. 
Table 4-3 gives an overview of the 40 SRES scenario 
quantifications as they were developed to describe the four 
scenario famities and the seven different scenario groups.

scenario drivers, sucii as population and economic growtti, 
technological change, resource availability, land-use changes, 
and local and regional environmental policies, are summarized 
in this Section (GHG emissions are reported in detail in 
Chapter 5). The assumptions are based on the range of driving 
forces identified in Chapter 2 and their relationships as 
summarized in Chapter 3. For simplicity these drivers are 
presented separately, but it is important to keep in mind that the 
evolution of these scenario drivers is to a large extent 
interrelated, as reflected in the SRES scenarios. 
As discussed above, the SRES scenarios were designed to 
reflect inherent uncertainties of future developments by 
adopting a range of salient input assumptions, but without 
attempting to cover the extremes from the scenario literature. 
Given the nature of the SRES open process and its multi-model 
approach, as well as the need for documented input 
assumptions, pubHshed scenario extremes are difficult to 
reproduce using altemative model approaches or insufficiently 
documented input data. (For instance, many long-term 
emission scenarios do not report their underlying population 
assumptions (see Chapters 2 and 3), which is especially true for 
extreme scenarios that are usually performed within the 
context of model sensitivity analysis.) 
Compared to the previous IS92 scenario series there are 
important similarities, but also important differences. For 
instance, three different future population scenarios were 
adopted, albeit that the future population levels are somewhat 
lower and the range more compressed than those in IS92 this 
reflects advances in demographic modeling and population 
projections. Conversely, the range of assumptions that concern 
resource availability and future technological change is much 
wider compared to earlier scenarios, reflecting in particular the 
results of the IPCC WGII Second Assessment Report (SAR; 
Watson et a l . , 1996). Another distinguishing characteristic of 
the SRES scenarios is an attempt to reflect the most recent 
understanding on the r e l a t i o n s h i p s between important scenario 
driving-force variables. For instance, no scenario combines 
low fertility with high mortality assumptions, which reflects 
the consensus view from demographers (see Chapter 3). 
Equally, all SRES scenarios assume a qualitative relationship 
between demographics and social and economic development 
trends, which reflects both the literature (see Chapter 3) and the 
results of the evaluation of the IS92 scenario series (Alcamo et 
al., 1995). All else being equal, fertility and mortafity trends 
are thus lower in scenarios with high-income growth 
assumptions, but the multidimensionality of the causal 
linkages must be recognized and so no particular cause-effect 
model is postulated here. Finally, the scenarios also attempt to 
reflect recent advances (as reviewed in Chapter 3) in 
understanding of the evolution of macro-economic and 
material productivity (e.g., their coupling via capital turnover 
rates), uncertainties in future levels of "dematerialization" 
(reflected in the difference between the B l and A l scenarios), 
and the likely evolution of local and regional environmental 
policies (e.g., all scenarios assume various degrees of sulfur-
control policies). 
The main aspects of translating the storylines into scenario 
drivers are summarized below. For each scenario family an 
overview of all scenario quantifications is given. Scenarios that 
share harmonized input assumptions with the respective 
scenario marker in terms of global population and GDP 
profiles (see Tables 4-1 and 4-3) are indicated in i t a l i c s in the 
subsequent discussion. Altogether, 26 scenarios in the four 
scenario families share similar assumptions about population 
and GDP at the global level. The other 14 scenarios either do 
not fully comply with the agreed common input assumptions 
concerning global population and GDP or explore important 
sensitivities of future demographic and economic developments 
beyond that described in the 24 scenarios. These sensitivities 
include resource availability, technology development, or land-
use changes and describe similar demographic and economic 
development pattems as other scenarios within a family, even 
if they do not fall within the range suggested by the 
harmonization criteria (see Table 4-1). Combined, the SRES 
scenario set comprises 40 scenarios grouped into four scenario 
families and different scenario groups (see Table 4-3). 
Each scenario family is illustrated by a designated marker 
scenario. A marker is not necessarily the mean or mode of 
comparable scenario quantifications, nor would it be possible 
to construct an internally consistent scenario reflecting 
medians/modes of all salient scenario characteristics (both in 
terms of scenario input assumptions as well as scenario 
outcomes, i.e. emissions). Marker scenarios should also not be 
inteфreted as being the more likely altemative scenario 
quantifications. However, only the four marker scenarios were 
subjected to the SRES open process through the SRES website 
and they have also received closest scrutiny by the entire 
writing team. 
4 . 4 . 2 . 1 . A l S c e n a r i o s 
The 
A l marker scenario (Jiang et a l , 2000) was created with 
the AIM model, an integrated assessment model developed by 
NIES, Japan (see Appendix IV). The A l scenario family is 
characterized by; 
• 
An affluent world, with a rapid demographic transition 
(declining mortality and fertility rates) and an 
increasing degree of intemational development equity. 
• 
Very high productivity and economic growth in all 
regions, with a considerable catch-up of developing 
countries. 
• 
Comparatively high energy and materials demands, 
moderated however by continuous structural change 
and the diffusion of more efficient technologies, 
consistent with the high productivity growth and capital 
tumover rates of the scenario. 
The first group of A l scenarios, which includes the A l B 
marker, assumes "balanced"^ progress across all resources and 
technologies from energy supply to end use, as well as 
"balanced" land-use changes. Three other groups of A l 
scenarios were identified which describe three altemative 
1 8 8 
A n O v e r v i e w of S c e n a r i o s 
pathways according to different resource and technology 
development assumptions: 
• 
A l C : "clean coal" technologies that are generally 
environmentally friendly with the exception of GHG 
emissions. 
• 
A I G : an "oil- and gas-rich" future, with a swift 
transition from conventional resources to abundant 
unconventional resources including methane clathrates. 
• 
AIT: a "non-fossil" future, with rapid development of 
solar and nuclear technologies on the supply side and 
mini-turbines and fuel cells used in energy end-use 
applications. 
The divergence between the various scenario groups (in terms 
of resource availability and the direction of technological 
change) results in a wide range of GHG emissions. The two 
fossil-fuel dominated alternatives, A l C and A I G (combined 
into the fossil-intensive A l F I scenario group in the SPM, see 
Footnote 1), have higher, and the AIT altematives have lower, 
GHG emissions than the A l marker scenario (see Chapter 5). 
"Balanced" A l scenarios quantifications were also calculated 
by the models^ A l B - A S F , A l B - l M A G E , 
A I B - M A R I A , A l B -
MESSAGE, 
and 
A l B - M i n i C A M . 
Additional 
scenarios 
representing A l scenario groups were developed using the 
A I M 
i A l C - A l M , 
A I G - A I M , 
A l T - A l M ^ ) , 
M A R I A (AIT-
MARIA), MESSAGE { A l C - M E S S A G E , A I G - M E S S A G E , A I T -
M E S S A G E ) , and M i n i C A M (AlC-MiniCAM, 
A l G - M i n i C A M ) 
models. The M i n i C A M modeling team also evaluated 
alternative interpretations of the A l scenario storyline with 
different demographic, economic, and energy development 
patterns ( A l v l - M i n i C A M and Alv2-MiniCAM) on top of tlie 
altemative technology-resource developments examined in the 
other A1 scenarios. 
* Different modeling teams provided different interprétations of what 
such a "balanced" resource-technology portfolio could be in the 21" 
century. The assumed rapid techtiology dynamics that underlie the A l 
scenario storyline necessitate that technologies and resource 
exploitation profiles change significantly. Hence, the concept of 
"balanced" development does not necessarily apply to atiy particular 
future date, but rather to the entirety of the scenario's development 
path throughout the 2P' century. As a consequence of the slow 
turnover rates in the capital stock of the energy sector, all scenarios 
necessarily rely more heavily on currently dominant resources and 
technologies in the near-term and project more radical departures only 
in the long-term. 
'' Scenarios denoted by italics 
indicate scenario quantifications that 
share harmonized global population and GDP trajectories with the 
respective marker scenario (i.e. "globally harmonized" scenarios). 
* By design, the A I T scenario group explores the possibility of 
technological change in energy end-use technologies and hence lower 
eitergy demand compared to the A l marker scenario. Considering that 
these scenarios provide similar levels of energy service, albeit at lower 
levels of final energy use, they are classified as "hannonized" based 
on population and GDP profiles only. 
4 . 4 . 2 . 2 . A2 S c e n a r i o s 
The A2 marker scenario (A2-ASF) was developed using ASF 
(see Appendix IV), an integrated set of modeling tools that was 
also used to generate the first and the second sets of IPCC 
emission scenarios (SA90 and IS92). Overall, the A2-ASF 
quantification is based on the following 
assumptions 
(Sankovski et a l , 2000): 
• 
Relatively slow demographic transition and relatively 
slow convergence in regional fertility pattems. 
• 
Relatively slow convergence in inter-regional GDP per 
capita differences. 
• 
Relatively slow end-use and supply-side energy 
efficiency 
improvements 
(compared 
to 
other 
storylines). 
• 
Delayed development of renewable energy. 
• 
No baixiers to the use of nuclear energy. 
Additional scenario quantifications of A2 were developed 
using 
the A I M (A2-AIM)9, 
IMAGE 
(A2-IMAGE),io 
MESSAGE { A 2 - M E S S A G E ) , and MiniCAM (A2-MiniCAM)ii 
models. An alternative inteipretation of the A2 scenario 
storyline in the form of a "delayed development" or 
"transitional" scenario between the A2 and A l scenario 
families was developed by the M i n i C A M modeling team (A2-
Al-MiniCAM). 
4 . 4 . 2 . 3 . B l S c e n a r i o s 
The B l marker scenario (de Vries et a l . , 2000) was developed 
using the IMAGE 2.1 model (see Appendix IV). Earlier 
versions of the model were used in the first IPCC scenario 
development effort (SA90). B l illustrates the possible 
emissions implications of a scenario in which the world 
chooses consistentiy and effectively a development path diat 
favors efficiency of resource use and "dematerialization" of 
economic activities. The scenario entails in particular: 
• 
Rapid demographic transition driven by rapid social 
development, including education. 
The scenario deviates only slightly from the global population and 
GDP assumptions of other "harmonized" scenarios within this 
scenario family. 
The IMAGE resuhs for the A2 and B2 scenarios are based on 
preliminary model experiments carried out in Maj-ch 1998. As a result 
of limited resources it has not been possible to redo these experiments. 
Hence, the IMAGE team is not able to provide background data and 
details for these scenario calculations and the population and 
economic growth assumptions are not fully harmonized, as is the case 
for the IMAGE A l and В1 scenarios. 
" The scenario deviates only slightly from the global population and 
GDP assumptions of other "harmonized" scenarios within this 
scenario family.

Scenarios

• 
High economic growth in all regions, with significant 
catch-up in tlie presently less-developed regions that 
leads to a substantial reduction in present income 
disparities. 
• 
Comparatively small increase in energy demand 
because of dematerialization of economic activities, 
saturation of material- and energy-intensive activities 
(e.g., car ownership), and effective innovation and 
implementation of measures to improve energy 
efficiency. 
• 
Timely and effective development of non-fossil energy 
supply options in response to the desire for a clean local 
and regional environment and to the gradual depletion 
of conventional oil and gas supplies. 
Additional scenaiios of В1 were developed using the AIM 
( B l -
A I M ) , ASF ( B l - A S F ) , MARIA (Bl-MARIA), MESSAGE (57-
M E S S A G E ) , and MiniCAM ( B I - M i n i C A M ) models. Some of 
these scenarios explore altemative technological developments 
(akin to the A l scenario, e.g. B I T - M E S S A G E ) 
or alternative 
interpretations 
on 
rates 
and 
potentials 
of 
future 
dematerialization and energy-intensity improvements (e.g., 
B l H i g h - M E S S A G E and BlHigh-MiniCAM explore scenario 
sensitivities of higher energy demand compared to the B l 
marker). 
4.4.2.4. 
B2 
Scenarios 
The 
B2 marker scenario (Riahi and Roehrl, 2000) was 
developed using the MESSAGE model (see Appendix IV), an 
integrated set of energy-sector simulation and optimization 
models used to generate the IIASA-WEC long-term energy 
and emission scenarios (IIASA-WEC, 1995; Nakicenovic et 
a l . , 1998). Compared to the other storylines ( A l and Bl), the 
B2 future unfolds with more gradual changes and less extreme 
developments 
in 
all respects, 
including 
geopolitics, 
demographics, productivity growth, technological dynamics, 
and other salient scenario characteristics. A more fragmented 
pattem of future development (not that different from present 
trends) precludes any particularly strong 
convergence 
tendencies in the scenario quantification: 
• 
Model parameter values for projections to 2100 were 
derived typically from long-term historical data series 
where applicable (Marchetti and Nakicenovic, 1979; 
Nakicenovic, 1987; Grübler, 1990; Nakicenovic et a l . , 
1996; 
Grübler, 1998a; Nakicenovic et a l . , 1998), or 
adopted from the medians of the analysis of the 
scenario literature (see Chapter 2). 
• 
The scenario quantification assumes effective policies 
in solving local and regional problems such as traffic 
congestion, local air pollution, and acid rain impacts. 
Additional B2 scenarios were developed using the AIM 
( B 2 -
A I M ) , ASF (B2-ASF)^^ IMAGE (B2-IMAGE),'0 ¡yjARlA 
(B2-
M A R I A ; 
Mori, 2000), and M i n i C A M 
(B2-MiniCAM)i3 
models. Again, more than one B2 scenario inteipretation was 
generated. Some models (e.g., B 2 - M A R 1 A 
or B2High-
MiniCAM) offered additional perspectives of both inter- and 
intra-model variability in the interpretation of the B2 storyline, 
particularly with respect to resource 
availability and 
technology development assumptions (see Section 4.4.7) and 
their resultant impact on GHG emissions (see Chapter 5). 
Figure 4-4 summarizes the main global scenario indicators of 
the four SRES marker scenarios by 2100, including population 
and global GDP levels, final energy intensities, final energy 
use, corresponding carbon intensities, land-use changes,and 
energy-related CO2 emissions. It illustrates that the range of the 
most important scenario characteristics spanned by the four 
SRES marker scenarios and the entire SRES scenario set 
covers the uncertainty range well, as reflected in the scenario 
literature. The scenario space defined by the lines "SRES-max" 
and "SRES-min" lies well within the range spanned by the 
scenario literature contained in the SRES scenario database 
and analyzed in Chapter 2. The two exceptions are: 
• 
The low range of future CO2 emissions from the 
literature is not reflected in the SRES scenarios, 
consistent with the SRES Terms of Reference to 
consider only scenarios that assume no "additional 
climate policy initiatives" (see Appendix I). 
• 
The low end of the range of global GDP and energy use 
from the literature is equally not reflected in the SRES 
scenarios. Very low global GDP values arise from a 
combination of rapid demographic transition with low 
per capita productivity growth, a combination for 
which there is littie theoretic or empii'ic support in the 
available literature on demographic and economic 
growth reviewed in Chapter 3. Low GDP scenarios can 
also reflect a combination of average population growth 
and low economic growth; this type of future usually 
depicts low-income, inequitable, and possibly unstable 
worlds that are not analyzed in this report (see Box 
4-2). 
Equally, while the SRES scenarios cover the range from the 
literature, the four marker scenarios cannot and do not replicate 
the frequency distributions of individual scenario variables as 
discussed in Chapter 
2. Nor can their 
quantitative 
characteristics 
segment 
the 
relevant 
distributions

'2 The B2-ASF shares global population and GDP assumptions with 
the B2 marker by 2100, but explores different dynamics of growth in 
the intervening time period. 
'3 The scenario deviates only slightiy frotn the global population and 
GDP 
assumptions of other "harmonized" scenarios within this 
scenario family. 
The 
dynamic profiles of land-use changes mean that scenario 
comparisons for any given year, such as 2100, are somewhat 
misleading. Hence, cumulative carbon emissions that result from 
land-use changes over the 1990 to 2100 period are used as a proxy 
indicator in Figure 4-4 (see Chapter 5 for a more detailed discussion).

approximately equal intervals. Two distinguishing features 
characterize the SRES scenarios. First, probabilities or 
likelihood are not assigned to any quantitative scenario 
characteristics (inputs or outputs). Thus, that two of the SRES 
marker scenarios deploy the same (low) demographic 
projection does not imply that such a scenario is considered 
more likely. It only indicates that such a demographic scenario 
was judged by the SRES writing team to be consistent with two 
of the four SRES storylines, as opposed to arbitrarily assigning 
different population projections to other "high" or "low" 
scenario characteristics. Second, the 
SRES 
scenarios 
incorporate current understanding of important interrelations 
between various scenario-driving forces (see Chapter 3). Thus, 
a "free," or "modeler's choice," numeric combination of 
scenario indicators is simply not possible. For instance, 
intermediary levels of global GDP or energy use could result 
both from a medium population projection combined with 
intermediate per capita GDP or energy use growth, or 
alternatively from low or high population projections 
combined with high or low GDP and energy per capita values, 
respectively. The fact that for some quantitative scenario 
characteristics a number of SRES marker scenarios cluster 
more toward the upper or lower range spanned by the scenario 
literature merely indicates the existence of important 
relationships between scenario characteristics. It also indicates 
that a limited number of scenarios (four markers) cannot 
replicate the distribution of individual scenario values arising 
out of an analysis of more than 400 scenarios published in the 
literature^^. Hence, it is important to consider always the entire 
range across all 40 SRES scenarios when analyzing 
uncertainties in all driving-force variables and the resultant 
emission categories. 
4 . 4 . 3 . 
Population 
Prospects 
For the SRES scenario quantification three different population 
trajectories were chosen to reflect future demographic 
unceitainties based on published population projections (Lutz, 
1996; UN, 1998; see Chapter 3). Global population ranges 
between 7 and 15 billion people by 2100 (Figure 4-5) 
depending on the speed and extent of the demographic 
transition. Fertility rates were assumed to converge to 
replacement levels (UN, 1998 medium scenario) in the B2 
scenario or to below replacement levels in the A l and B l 
scenario families that adopt a variant of the low population 
scenario of Lutz (1996). The A2 scenario family is based on the 
high population projection described in Lutz (1996), which is 
characterized by heterogeneous fertility patterns that remain 
above replacement levels in many regions but nonetheless 
decline compared to cuiTcnt levels. 
To address this issue, during the approval process of the Summary 
for Policymakers at the 5th Session of WGIII of the IPCC from 8-11 
March 2000 in Katmandu, Nepal, it was decided to select two 
illustrative scenarios in the SPM from two additional A l groups, in 
addition to the marker scenarios. 
Across all scenarios, the concentration of future population 
growth and its uncertainty lies primarily in the developing 
countries. An equally pervasive trend across all scenarios is 
urbanization (see Chapter 3). Since the population trajectories 
are exogenous input to all the models used for this report, and 
are subject to a stringent harmonization criterion across 
different models, no further demographic variants to these are 
reported here, with exception of the A2 scenario family. 
4 . 4 . 3 . 1 . A l a n d В1 S c e n a r i o s 
The population trajectory assumed for the A l and B l scenario 
families is based on a variant of the low population projection 
reported in Lutz (1996), which combines low fertility with low 
mortality and central migration rate assumptions. As is the case 
for other population scenarios used in this report, it is well 
within the uncertainty ranges as discussed in the demographic 
literature 
and the U N (1998)" long-range population 
projections. After peaking at 8.7 billion in the middle of the 
2P' century, world population declines to 7.1 billion in the year 
2100 (for comparison, the lowest U N Long Range projection 
indicates 5.6 billion by 2100; UN, 1998). As discussed in 
Chapter 3, the scenario population is somewhat higher than the 
previous low population scenario used in the IS92 scenario 
series, as only a combination of low fertility with 
h i g l i 
mortality rates could result in a global population as low as six 
billion people by 2100. Such a development is judged to be 
inconsistent with demographic theory (see Chapter 3) and to be 
inconsistent with the scenario storylines (see Section 4.2). 
The pace of demographic transition in developing countries is 
fastest among all the SRES scenarios, reflecting the emphasis 
on social and educational development (scenario B l ) and 
economic development (Al). The use of the same population 
projection for two SRES scenario families thus reflects 
different views of the driving forces of the demographic 
transition (with causality links in both directions), but it does 
not imply that such a demographic scenario is considered more 
likely compared to that of other projections. Better education 
and unproved social development, in particular concerning the 
role of women in society, lead the demographic transition (and 
consequentiy also economic development) in scenario B l . 
Accelerated rates of economic development and its required 
favorable social environment (education, reduction of income 
disparities, etc.) in tum lead the demographic transition in 
scenario A l . In both scenarios, low (infant) mortality rates are 
a necessary precondition to lower fertility rates (consistent 
with the Cairo targets of the U N Conference on Population and 
Development, discussed in Chapter 2). A distinguishing feature 
of the IIASA low population projection is the assumption of 
below replacement fertility levels, on the basis of the actual 
experience of industrial countries.The implications of this 
trend are visible in both the absolute decline of global 
population (from its peak at 8.7 billion people in the middle of 
The different population projection that underlies the "delayed 
development" scenario A2-A1-MiniCAM is described in Box 4-6.

For the A2 scenario family, future population levels are based 
on the high scenario (15 billion) reported in Lutz (1996),^^ 
which is somewhat lower than the high population projection 
used in the previous IS92 scenarios (17.6 billion by 2100) for 
the reasons outiined in Chapter 3. The A2 population trajectory 
is the highest among the SRES scenarios, but well within the 
range of the U N long-range population projections^'' and 
2050, it IS necessary to consider the coiTesponding U N 
long-range 
population projections that extend to 2150 ( U N , 1998). In these, the 
corresponding high/medium scenario is projected to have 10.8 billion 
people by 2050, which increases to 14.6 billion by 2100. The U N piesents 
two additional scenarios that result in yet higher population levels: the U N 
high scenario piojects 11.2 billion people by 2050 and 17.5 bilUon by 
2100, and the U N constant fertility scenario projects 14.9 and 57.2 billion 
people by 2050 and 2100, lespectively. For companson, the A2 population 
scenario adopted from Lutz c t a l ( 1996) indicates population levels of 
11.3 billion by 2050 and 15.1 billion by 2100. Thus, A 2 population levels 
by 2050 aie comparable to those of the U N high scenario but lemain 
significantly below the U N constant fertility scenario. By 2100, A2's 
population assumption is comparable to that of the U N high/medium 
scenario (14,6 billion) and significantiy below that of the other two U N 
scenarios 
(high and constant 
fertility, with 17.5 
and 57.2 
billion, 
respectively). Hence, the adopted values for the A 2 scenario are well 
within the range of the U N long-range populaUon projections. 
A s 
discussed in Chapter 3, the reason for the comparatively higher 2050 
population in the Lutz et a l (1996) scenario is lower assumed mortality 
rates compared to the U N projections in the medium/high scenario. The 
lower mortality rates characteristic of A2's demographic scenario are 
judged to be more consistent with the A 2 scenatio storyline than 
alternative U N projections, such as the U N high/medium variant, that 
results in lower population by 2050, albeit at the expense of higher 
mortality. Yet by 2100 the differences in global population between the 
two scenarios is rather small (15.1 veisus 14.6 billion, or 3%).

corresponding uncertainties estimated by demographers (see 
Chapter 3). For instance, Lutz et a l . (1997) attach a probability 
of about 90% that actual world population will be lower (and 
10% that it will be higher) than the value adopted for the A2 
scenario family. Thus, the scenario represents well an upper 
bound of population growth scenarios found in the current 
scenario literature, although higher population scenarios exist 
in the demographic literature (see Chapter 3). As mentioned 
above, the SRES writing team is n o t m a p o s i t i o n t o a t t a c h any 
judgment concerning probability or likelihood to this or to any 
other demographic scenario. Population growth in the A2 
world remains uninterrupted across all the SRES regions 
(Figure 4-5). The average global population growth rate over 
the 2P' century is 0.96% per year, half that observed during the 
period between 1950 and 1990 (1.86%; UN, 1998). In the A2 
marker, fertility rates vary considerably from one region to 
another; this reflects the regional orientation toward specific 
values, lifestyles, etc. described in the A2 scenario storyline 
(see Secfion 4.3). In the A2 world, in the year 2100 less than 
one-tenth of the world population lives in OECD90 countries, 
and toward the end of the 2P' century a pronounced shift 
occurs in the population distribution, from ASIA to the A L M 
region (specificaUy Africa). 
4 . 4 . 3 . 3 . H a r m o n i z e d a n d O t h e r A2 S c e n a r i o s 
The A2 scenarios share, with one exception, the same global 
population trajectory, but some of them show variation in 
population across the four SRES regions because of differences 
in the regional breakdown of the underlying models. For 
example, the A2-IMAGE scenario has a smaller population in 
the REF region as compared with the marker, 405 milUon 
versus 706 million in the marker. An altemative demographic 
interpretation at the global level was attempted in the 
"transitional" A 2 - A l - M i n i C A M scenario, in which the 
implications of delayed development pattems are explored. In 
this scenario global population is assumed to reach 10 billion 
by 2050, and 12 billion by 2100 (see Box 4-6). 
4 . 4 . 3 . 4 . B2 S c e n a r i o s 
The B2 marker scenario adopted the U N median 1998 
population projection (UN, 1998), wherein global population 
increases to about 9.4 billion people by 2050 and to about 10.4 
billion by 2100^^. The scenario is characteristic of recent 
median global population projections (see discussion in 
Chapter 3), and describes a continuation of historical trends 
toward a completion of the demographic transition in the 2P' 
century. The projection is consistent with recent demographic 
data and scenarios; it reflects faster declines in world fertiUty 
together with declining mortality rates. Hence, the scenario is 
somewhat lower than previous U N median projections, as used 
^' The SRES writing team gratefully acknowledges the assistance of 
Thomas Büttner of the U N Population Division, New York, in 
developing more detailed regional population projections based on

in the previous IS92 scenario series. A distinguishing feature of 
the U N population projections is the assumption that, in the 
long-term, fertility levels converge toward replacement levels 
globally (see Chapter 3). Future population growth is assumed 
to be slow in today's industiialized countries. In Asia, 
population size stabilizes in the second half of the 2U' century, 
and in the rest of the world population growth slows down 
toward the end of that century. 
The U N median population projection is shared across all B2 
scenaiio quantifications, although differences remain at the 
regional level. The different regional aggregations used across 
various models did not coincide with the regional aggregation 
of the original U N projection, which suggests that a more 
detailed regional breakdown of demographic projections is 
highly desirable for long-term global scenario studies. 
4 . 4 . 4 . 
Economic 
Development 
The SRES scenarios span a wide range of future economic 
growth rates (Table 4-5) and resultant levels of economic 
output. The A l scenario family, with a global GDP of US$520 
to 550 trillion in 2100, defineates the SRES upper bound, 
whereas the A2 and B2 scenarios, with a range of US$230 to 
250 trillion in 2100, represent its lower bound. The ВI scenario 
family is intermediary. Although the SRES scenarios span a 
wide range, both lower and higher global GDP levels can be 
found in the literature (see Chapter 2). 
Uncertainties in future GDP levels are governed by the rates of 
future productivity growth and population growth, especially 
those in developing countries. Different assumptions on 
conditions and possibilities for development "catch-up" and 
for naiTower per capita income gaps in particular explain the 
wide range in projected future economic growth rates. Given 
the weak inverse relationship between population growth and 
per capita income growth discussed in Chapter 2, uncertainties 
in future population growth rates tend to restrict the range of 
associated GDP projections. High population growth, all else 
being equal, lowers per capita income growth, whereas low 
population growth tends to increase this growth. This 
relationship is evident in empiric data - high per capita income 
countries are generally also those that have completed their 
demographic transition. The affluent live long and generally 
have few children. Notable exceptions are countries with small 
populations and significant income from commodity exports. 
Yet even assuming this relationship holds for an extended time 
into the future, its quantification is subject to considerable 
theoretic and empiric uncertainties (Alcamo et a l . , 1 9 9 5 ) . 
As outUned above, two of the SRES scenarios explicitly 
explore alternative pathways of the gradually closure of 
existing income gaps. As a reflection of uncertainty, the 
development "catch-up" diverges in terms of geographically 
distinct economic growth pattems across the four SRES 
scenario families, as summarized in Tables 4-5, 4-6, and 4-7. 
The scenarios of rapid development and "catch-up" remain in

dispute within the SRES writing team because they imply high 
productivity growth (see Box 4-5 and, for a contrasting 
viewpoint and scenario 1п1ефге1а11оп, Box 4-6). However, it is 
agreed that such scenarios of high productivity growth and 
smaller income-per-capita disparities cannot be ruled out, even 
if they certainly are very challenging from the perspective of 
recent growth experiences in a number of regions, most notably 
Africa. There is also agreement that the assumptions deployed 
for the SRES scenarios are within the range suggested by the 
literature (see Chapter 2). In this the highest GDP growth is up 
to US$700 trillion by 2100 compared to US$550 trillion in the 
highest SRES scenario. For scenarios developed within the 
context of sustainability analyses, reductions in per capita 
income gaps also occur faster than for any of the scenarios 
presented here. 
Important differences remain between models in terms of 1990 
base-year data on economic activity levels. Even after 
differences in regional definitions are accounted for, 1990 
regional GDP differences between models range up to ±32% in 
a few cases. Such differences are particularly pronounced for 
developing countries, where in many cases national currencies 
are not freely convertible and thus important uncertainties on 
the applicable conversion rates remain (World Bank, 1999). 
Differences for OECD countries are much smaller (+3% across 
the models) and because of their current dominance in global 
economic activity (and counterbalancing effects), 1990 global 
GDP numbers agree well across the models (±5%). Scenario 
comparisons, especially at the regional level, ai'e therefore best 
based on a comparison of growth rates (see Chapter 2), and the 
SRES scenarios are no exception. 
Historical data indicate that, even though the process of 
economic growth is heterogeneous across countries and over 
time, the patterns of growth show certain similarities. 
Economic "catch-up" follows a general dynamic pattern, 
characterized by initially accelerating economic growth rates 
that pass through a maximum, and decline once the industrial 
base of an economy becomes established. This overall feature 
of growth dynamics is reflected in all the SRES scenarios, 
albeit timing and magnitude vary across the four scenario 
families. This variation reflects the scenario-specific storylines, 
as well as particular relationships to other driving-force 
variables, such as demographics, described in the scenario. 
4 . 4 . 4 . 1 . A l S c e n a r i o s 
By design (see Section 4.3) the "High Growth" scenario family 
A l explores a world in which future economic development 
follows the pattems of the most successful historical examples 
of economic development catch-up. Free trade, continued 
innovation, and a stable political and social climate enable 
developing regions to access knowledge, technology, and 
capital. Combined with a rapid demographic transition, this is 
assumed to lead to acceleration in time and space of economic 
growth compared to the historical OECD experience since the 
19* century. The global economy is projected to expand at an 
average annual rate of 2.9% to 2100 (see Table 4-5), roughly in 
line with historical experience over the past 100 years (of 2.7% 
per year, see Chapter 3). Such growth rates are considered high 
by the current scenario literature (see Chapter 2). Compared to 
historical experience, however, the broad-based nature of 
economic development catch-up (i.e., no region "is left 
behind") is without precedent. The 2.9% per year economic

growth rate translates into a 25-fold expansion of global GDP 
that would reach US$529 trillion by 2100. 
As a byproduct of rapid economic development and fast 
demographic transition, income inequities between industrial 
and developing countries are virtually eradicated. Per capita 
income ratios are 1:1.6 in 2100, compared to a ratio of 1:16 in 
1990 in terms of the GDP/capita difference between cunent 
developed (IND) and developing (DEV) regions across the four 
SRES regions. However, even if relative income differences are 
reduced drastically, absolute differences remain large, not least 
because of the high incomes characteristic of the A l scenario 
family (per capita income differences are also larger when 
considered at a more disaggregated level). When measured 
across the four SRES regions in 1990, income per capita 
differences are nearly 1:40 (between ASIA and OECD90). Per 
capita income differences are yet higher for differences across 
countries or between different social strata. The poorest 20% of 
Bangladesh's population, for instance, earn per capita incomes 
that are a factor of 700 lower than that of the 20% richest Swiss 
population (UNDP, 1993). A distinguishing feature of the A l 
scenarios is to explore pathways of reductions in present 
disparities. In A I , per capita income in industrial countries 
(IND) increases to about US$107,300 and in now developing 
countries (DEV) to US$66,500. Non-OECD GDP growth rates 
rise to a peak of about 8% between 2010 to 2030 in scenario 
A l , and decline once the industrial and infrastructural bases of 
their economies are established. By and lai'ge, the A l scenario 
implies a rephcation across all developing regions of the post-
World War II experience of Japan and Korea or the recent 
economic development of China. 
4 . 4 . 4 . 2 . H a r m o n i z e d a n d O t h e r A l S c e n a r i o s 
The high economic growth characteristics of the AIB marker 
scenario reproduce well in the scenarios calculated with 
different models. The AIB-MESSAGE scenario tracks the AIB 
marker scenario closely at the global and regional levels ("fully 
harmonized" input assumptions). At the global GDP level, most 
growth trajectories agree within a range up to 15%, except the 
Alv2-MiniCAM scenario (see Box 4-5).^^ Differences at the 
regional level are larger. All models with comparable regional 
aggregation levels agree well for ASIA (except A l v 2 -
MiniCAM). Differences in economic growth prospects also 
agree well for OECD90 (except Alv2-MimCAM). For REF 
the A I B scenarios group into two clusters - one group 
reproduces the GDP growth scenario of the AIB marker, while 
the other group suggests a GDP level by 2100 about one-third 
lower than that of the A I B marker. Mostly this reflects 
different assumptions used in the models on future labor 
productivity growth that have not been harmonized with the 
values adopted for the A I B marker scenario. For A L M , again 
one group of scenarios tracks closely the A I B marker, whereas 
other groups indicate either higher (AlB-ASF, A l B -
" The A l v 2 - M i n C A M scenario reaches only about 64% of the A I B 
marker global GDP in 2100. 
MiniCAM) or lower (Alv2-MiniCAM, AIT-MARIA) GDP 
growth. The reasons are similar to those discussed above. For 
the SRES region REF, the different regional aggregations 
across the models required complicated "inverse" calculations 
on regional growth rates for harmonization with the respective 
marker scenario at the level of the aggregated SRES region. For 
A L M , such calculations were neither possible for all models 
nor considered desirable by various modeling teams, which 
prefeired to emphasize the inherent uncertainties in regional 
economic growth perspectives even for an otherwise shared 
vision of rapid global economic growth and development 
catch-up. 
4 . 4 . 4 . 3 . A2 S c e n a r i o s 
As compared to the other SRES scenario families, the A2 
world is characterized by relatively slower productivity growth 
rates and resultant lower per capita incomes (see Table 4-6). 
Yet, the global average (1990-2100) growth rate in per capita 
income of 1.3% is still somewhat higher than that observed 
from 
1970 to 1995 (1.2%; World Bank, 1998). The 
comparatively conservative assumptions on per-capita-income 
growth reflect both the more fragmented economic outlook of 
the A2 storyline (see Section 4.3) and the slow pace of the 
demographic transition that underlies A2's high population 
growth trajectory. The fastest growth in per capita incomes (on 
average over 2.3% per year) occurs in the ASIA region, while 
the slowest growth is observed in the OECD90 region (on 
average 1.0% per year). In a reversal of current short-term 
trends, the REF and A L M regions experience a stable increase 
of their per capita income levels over the 2P' century at a rate 
that is almost twice as high as in the OECD90 region (see Table 
4-7). The A2 world is also characterized by a slow convergence 
of incomes among regions. Nonetheless, present income 
disparities become nairower, from a factor of 40 difference in 
1990 per capita income levels between the richest and the 
poorest of the four SRES regions, to a factor of seven or eight 
by 2100. The increase of global population from 6 to 15 billion 
by 2100 translates into an increase of global GDP by a factor 
of 12 over a century. The average (1990 to 2100) annual growth 
rate of total GDP is 2.2%, which is lower than the 2.9% 
average annual growth rate observed between 1970 and 1995 
(World Bank, 1998) and the 4% rate observed from 1950 to 
1990 (see Table 4-5). 
4 . 4 . 4 . 4 . H a r m o n i z e d a n d O t h e r A2 S c e n a r i o s 
Four non-marker A2 scenarios (A2-AIM, A2-IMAGE with the 
exception of 2050, A2-MiniCAM, and A2-MESSAGE) have 
global GDPs within 5% of the A2 marker. The A2-A1-
M i n i C A M scenario has much lower global GDP than the A2 
marker, reflecting a different viewpoint on future labor 
productivity growth (see Box 4-5) and a different interpretation 
of the A2 scenario storyline altogether (see Box 4-6). While 
this particular scenario illustrates important uncertainties with 
respect to economic growth and development catch-up for 
developing countries, it remains controversial within the 
writing team, especially as to whether it reflects the overall

Box 4-5: Labor Productivity Growtli Rates in the SRES Scenarios 
The high income growths assumed in the scenarios, especially in the A l and Bl scenario families, imply large labor productivity 
increases. Accordmg to one member of the writmg team such increases might not be plausible, but the other members find the 
assumpfions plausible, especially in view of historical precedents. In line with IPCC practice, the dissenting view is elaborated 
here. Its corresponding impUcations on scenario quantifications are discussed with one example in Box 4-6. 
Long-term economic growth rates can be expressed as the sum of the labor force growth rate and the growth rate of labor 
productivity. This framework can be used to understand more clearly the kind of technological and demographic assumptions 
present in the SRES scenarios. A simplified measure of labor productivity, the average economic output per member of the labor 
force, is used to examine the SRES scenarios. 
Productivity assumptions are not comparable across the different models used to quantify the SRES emissions scenarios, so 
these issues were examined by mnning quantifications of the SRES scenarios with the MiniCAM model. Population projections 
were taken as exogenous inputs and regional GDP growth paths were taken to be similar to those in the SRES marker scenarios. 
From these, the implied labor force productivity growth rates are determined using assumptions about labor force participation 
rates. In these calculations, total labor force participation rates were assumed to be asymptotic to a participation rate of 80% for 
a working age population of all persons aged 15 to 65. 
The resuh of this exercise is that increases in labor force productivity range between 0.79% and 5.85% per year (calculated for 
the periods 1990 to 2020, 2020 to 2050, and 2050 to 2100) for the four scenario families and four SRES macro-regions 
considered separately. This compares with historical experience between 1970 and 1995 of growth in regional labor force 
productivity of 0.69 to 4.13% per year and the longer-term productivity growth rates of between 1.1 and 7.7% per year. The 
impUed future growth i n global 
labor productivity for the MmiCAM scenario calculations ranges between 1.12% and 3.49% 
per year for the four scenarios (agam from 1990 to 2020,2020 to 2050, and 2050 to 2100). The historical growth in global labor 
force productivity between 1970 and 1995 was 1.04% per year. Historical rates of GDP per capita growth (a macro-economic 
proxy for labor productivity; see Table 3-2 and Table 4-7) were 1.1% per year between 1980 and 1992 and 2.5% per year 
between 1950 and 1980. 
At the upper end of the these ranges, the SRES scenarios exhibit a growth in global labor force productivity that is higher than 
recent historical global experience, particularly for the SRES regions REF and ALM. This indicates that none of the four SRES 
scenario families envisions a recurrence of the current economic crisis in Eastem Europe and Russia or a recurrence of the "lost 
decade" of negative GDP per capita growth in Africa or Latin America. In addition, the period over which some developing 
regions exhibit high growth rates in these scenarios is longer than any historical record of high growth rates. However, there is 
limited analogous historical experience, as Japan is the ordy country that can be said to have completed such an economic 
"catch-up." 
The assumptions on labor force participation used in the calculations reported in this box result in a decline in the growth of 
the labor force through the 2P' century. The total labor force actually declines m all regions for the last simulation period. This 
reflects the demographic pattern of an overall decline in the population and the assumed stability in labor force participation 
rates. However, the scenarios describe generally affluent worlds in which people live longer. Thus, the labor participation 
pattems are likely to change with respect to current practices. People may work much longer over their lifetime, but this trend 
is countered by the probable need for an mercase in education levels, which act to delay entry into the labor force. Pushing the 
asymptotic labor participation rates upward from the value assumed here results ui only a small increase in total productivity, 
on the order of 0.2% per year. 
The high economic growth branches (Al and B l families) of the SRES scenarios may represent upper bounds for future 
Ulereases in labor productivity. Different assumptions about futttre rates of labor force participation do not appear to change this 
conclusion substantially. These scenarios essentially assume that, within the next few decades, most developmg regions will 
experience an extended period of successful economic development analogous to the historical experience of Japan and the 
"Asian Tigers." An altemative view on future labor productivity growth is provided m a number of scenarios developed with the 
MiniCAM model, most notably Alv2-MiniCAM and the "transitional" scenario A2-Al-MiniCAM (see Box 4-6). In these 
scenarios global economic output is between 20% (A2-A1-MiniCAM) and 36% (Alv2-MiniCAM) lower than m the other 
scenarios of their respective scenario families.

Box 4-6: Possible IVansitions between Scenario Families: The A2-Al-MiniCAM Scenario 
The four scenario storyhnes have been stylized as global socio-economic developments that evolve in different directions, but 
globally and continuously. In reality, different regions may follow the developments pictured in the scenarios in different time 
periods. For example, the world may in reality develop according to one of the storylines and after some time move toward 
another. As an illustration of this, one scenario (A2-A1-MiniCAM) was elaborated by a member of the writing team. This 
scenario is described here even though some members of the writing team considered its inclusion undesirable and possibly 
confusing as it was submitted too late to have the team thoroughly discuss its consistency-^'* and to clarify its relationship to the 
four storylines. However, the point that in reality transitions between scenarios are possible is a valid one and the contrasting 
viewpoint is presented here for consideration of the reader, following IPCC practice. 
The A2-A1-MiniCAM transition scenario explores a world m which the prerequisites for development, such as education, 
effective institutions, and high saving rates, take some time to develop, so that rapid development does not begin to occur until 
between 2020 and 2050 depending on the region. In this scenario, total GDP by 2100 is below the median of the historical 
scenario data base and, with the population 20% higher than the current median U N forecast, average per capita income is at 
the lower end of the historical data base range. In such a relatively poor world the economic structure is more sensitive to 
environmental change than in the marker scenario, and the institutional stmcture is less capable. Thus, the impacts of climate 
change are larger and the ability to adapt less than those in the A l world. The primary driving forces for the A 2 - A l - M i n i C A M 
transition scenario follow the logic of this story line, as detailed below. 
Population is lower in the A2-A1-MiniCAM scenario variant than in the A2 marker, since its total completed fertility early in 
the 2P' century is lower. This reflects the continued rapid historical declines and leads to slower population growth rates than 
in the population scenario adopted for the A2 scenario family. Total completed fertility declines slowly in the forecast period 
with a long-term asymptotic level of 2.25 for all regions, which results in a global population that is still growing by over 100 
million per year m 2100. The values for migration and death rates used to generate the population trajectory follow those of the 
UN median forecast. The population scenario of A2-AI-MiniCAM is quite close to the U N medium population projection (see 
the discussion of the B2 scenario family below) until about 2060. Thereafter, however, A2-Al-MiniCAM's population scenario 
continues to grow luiearly to about 12 billion, whereas the U N median projection stabilizes at about 10 biUion by 2080 and 
slightly declines thereafter. 
The regionally heterogeneous ("delayed") pattem of development of the precursors to rapid economic growth (e.g. education) 
means that some developing regions experience stagnant or very slowly growth in per capita incomes well into the 2U' century. 
As regions begin rapid development they approach and follow the average OECD labor productivity pattem, so GDP growth 
rates accelerate post-2050 and average nearly 2.5% per year over the second half of the 21" century. GDP thus rises more slowly 
eariy m the 21st cenmry in this scenario, reaching just over US$50 trillion by 2050. After 2050, GDP rises more rapidly to reach 
just under US$200 trillion in 2100. 
Per capita final energy demands are lünited by per capita income, and rise only as economic growth occurs. After growmg 
slowly until 2050, per capita energy demands grow by more than 1.5% annually to reach 120 GJ per capita by 2100. With 
increases in the efficiency with which services are provided, this results in a global average level of energy services similar to 
that currently seen in Western Europe. Global per capita income and energy use by 2100 approach that of Westem Europe in 
1990. Therefore global energy intensities m 2100 approach those of Westem Europe in 1990, a value lower than in other 
scenarios but in line with current observations. 
Natural gas and oil dominate the primary energy system, and contribute slightly more than half of the primary energy. Non-fossil 
sources contribute about 30% of total primary energy, with coal providing the remainder. Total fossil energy carbon emissions reach 
22 GtC by 2100. Sulfur controls are delayed in this implementation until economic growth takes off after 2050. With high levels of 
fossil fuel use, and relatively low rates of control, sulfur emissions are about ten million tons higher m 2100 than they are today. 
The relatively slow growth m output and productivity i n the economy in general is mirrored in the agricultural sector, with lower 
growth in agricultural productivity until post 2050. The large population complicates this problem, leadmg to large-scale 
expansion of agricultural lands and a resultant decrease in forested and unmanaged lands, especially in developing regions. 
Land-use changes do not offset any of these emissions, since the relatively high population, the rapid growth in income, and the 
growth in modem biomass result in essentially zero carbon emissions from land use and agriculture, rather than the substantial 
uptake seen in many other scenarios. 
In particular, the consistency of a continued fast demographic 
income growth for as much as five decades is questioned by a number 
transition to 2050 combined with a scenario of stagnating per capita 
of members from the writing team.

Nonetheless, in view of the spirit of the SRES open process 
this contrasting scenario is presented in Box 4-6. Regional 
GDP growth differs more than global values across the 
different model interpretations of the A2 scenario storyline. 
A2-MESSAGE and A2-A1M scenarios are harmonized, based 
on the marker scenario, at the regional level also, while the A2-
IMAGE and A2-MiniCAM scenarios have significant regional 
deviations from the A2 (ASF) marker. In particular, these 
scenarios assume stronger GDP/capita growth in the ASIA 
region and slower growth in the ALM and REF regions. 
4.4.4.5. 
B l 
Scenarios 
The B l scenario storyline assumes high levels of social 
consciousness and successful governance that resuh in strong 
reductions in income inequalities and social inequity. Growth 
in GDP, while being substantial, is qualitatively different 
compared to that of other scenarios, as social activities and 
environmental conservation are emphasized. Concepts of 
"green" GDP. including socially desirable activities such as 
childcare, apply in particular in the Bl scenario and qualify its 
similarity to other scenarios in terms of monetary value of 
GDP In contrast to the worid of scenario A l , the reduction of 
income inequalities is not a byproduct, but rather the result of 
constant domestic and international efforts. Global GDP 
reaches US$328 trillion, which corresponds to an average 
annual growth rate of 2.5%, shghtly less than the long-term 
historical average. Per capita income differences between the 
IND and DEV regions are reduced from 1:16 in 1990 to 1:1.8 
by 2100; income disparities within particular regions are 
assumed to be even further reduced, consistent with the thread 
of the B l storyline described in Section 4.3. For the IMAGE 
model simulation, convergence assumptions were applied in 
the foiiowiiig domúns: 
• 
Technology convergence was toward the level of the 
productivity frontier region (either Japan or the US). 
• 
Economic structure convergence was toward long-term 
sectoral shares of OECD economies (e.g., the US), 
which over the long-term implies a decline of the share 
of manufacturing sectors, and hence convergence to a 
service-oriented econotny. 
• 
Education convergence was to the OECD ratio of 
highly skilled workers within the total workforce. 
4.4.4.6. 
Harmonized 
and Other B l 
Scenarios 
The global GDP trajectories are all within the proposed 
hannonization intervals, except for the Б1 High-MiniCAM (see 
Box 4-5) and the Bl-MARIA scenarios in the middle period of 
the 21*' century. On the regional level, differences in GDP 
trajectories from different models are larger because of the 
differences in regional aggregations outiined above in the 
discussion of the A l scenario family. 
4.4.4.7. 
B2 Scenarios 
Global GDP in B2 is assumed to increase by more than a factor 
of 10 during the 2P' century, or at an average annual growth 
rate of 2.2%. This growth rate of GDP is similar to the median 
GDP growth in the scenario database reviewed in Chapter 2. 
Stabilization of global population at less than double cun'ent 
levels, as projected in the UN median scenario adopted for B2, 
combined with a sustained pace of development implies that a 
B2 world generally achieves high levels of affluence. Average 
per capita income reaches about US$18,000 by 2100 in the 
developing countries, which exceeds the current 
OECD 
averages. In comparison, average per capita GDP reaches 
US$54,400 by 2100 in the developed regions, which 
corresponds to an income ratio of about 3:1 between industrial 
(IND) and now developing (DEV) regions, a considerable 
improvement in interregional equity by 2100 (Riahi and 
Roehrl, 2000). Noitetheless, given thé nature of the B2 scenario 
storyline (Section 4.3), per capita income differences among 
the world regions are higher than those in the A l and B l 
scenarios, but much smaller than those in A2. 
4.4.4.8. H a r m o n i z e d a n d O t h e r B2 S c e n a r i o s 
The economic growth paths described by the B2-MESSAGE 
marker scenario are closely tracked by the B2 quantifications 
derived from alternative models at the global level, with the 
exception of the B2-IMAGE scenario, which is sfightly 
below.^"* Differences at the regional level are larger. For B2-
ASF and B2-MiniCAM, GDP is higher in the A L M and lower 
in the ASIA regions, respectively, compared to the B2 marker 
scenario and its "fully harmonized" companion B2-AIM. The 
latter - like all AIM scenarios - was developed by an 
interdisciplinary group of researchers from different countries 
in the ASIA region and therefore helps to guide readers as to 
which scenario better reflects regional perspectives.

Energy

Energy 
Demand, 
and 
Structure 
of Energy 
Use 
Population and GDP assumptions, along with structural change 
and technological change that affect energy efficiency and 
energy costs (and prices), drive the demand for energy 
services. Given the different model representations of energy 
service demands, in this section final energy use is discussed as 
a common measurement point across all SRES models and 
scenarios. Final energy use per unit economic activity, that is, 
energy intensity, is a frequentiy used measure of comparative 
efficiency of resource use, and reflects a whole range of 
structural, technological, and lifestyle factors (Schipper and 
Meyers, 1992). 
2^ In B2-IMAGE, economic output is higher in OECD90 and lower in 
the other regions compared to the В 2 marker. 
A n O v e r v i e w of S c e n a r i o s 
2 0 1 
Figure 4-6 illustrates the evolution of final energy intensities 
for the four SRES marker scenarios. Instead of time, per capita 
income is shown on the horizontal axis, to illustrate a 
conditional convergence of regional final energy intensities. 
Invariably, intensities are projected to decline with increasing 
income levels. As discussed in Chapter 3, the main reason for 
this trettd stems from the common source of economic growth 
and energy intensity improvements - technological change. 
All else being equal, the faster intensity improvements are, the 
faster aggregate productivity (per capita income) grows. An 
important méthodologie improvement over previous studies is 
the explicit inclusion of non-commercial energy forms in 
some SRES models, drawing on estimates as reported in IPCC 
WGII SAR (Watson et a l . , 1996) and in Nakicenovic et a l . 
(1998). 
In the A l and ВI scenarios, per capita income differences are 
substantially narrowed and convergent because of increased 
economic integration and rapid technological change. 
Therefore, differences in energy intensities are also narrowed 
significantly and are convergent, as shown in Figure 4.6. The 
B l storyline describes a development path to a less material-
intensive economy. Hence, the final energy intensities in the В1 
marker are lowest among the four SRES marker scenarios for 
a given per capita income level. The A2 storyline reflects a 
world with less rapid technological change, as shown by the 
smallest rate of energy intensity improvement among the four 
marker scenarios.Different interpretations of the four 
scenario storylines, as well as alternative rates of energy 
intensity improvement to the four marker scenarios, are 
discussed below. 
Owing to méthodologie differences across the six models (see 
Box 4-7) it is not possible to disaggregate energy intensity 
improvements into various components, such as structural 
change, price effects, technological change, etc., in a consistent 
way. 
In some models (macro-economic) price effects are 
differentiated from "everything else" (frequently labeled AEEI, 
or autonomous energy intensity improvements). As a rule, the 
importance of non-price factors is an inverse function of the 
time horizon considered. Over the short-term, the impacts of 
economic structural change and technology diffusion are 
necessarily low. Hence, prices assume a paramount importance 
2 ' Note that this statement only indicates the relative position of the 
A2 scenario compared to other SRES scenario families. In absolute 
tenus the scenario's decline in energy intensity is very substantial - on 
average, energy use per unit of GDP declines by a factor of more than 
two as a result of the compounding effect of an improvement rate of 
final energy intensity of 0.8% per year. Comparison of this 
improvement rate with the SRES scenario range calculated by the 
ASF model indicates that A2's energy intensity improvement rates are 
one-third lower compared to the B2 scenaiio and less than half 
compared to the B l scenario. By 2100, A2's final energy intensity is 
calculated by the ASF model at 5.9 MJ/$, which compai-e.s to the 
literature range of up to 7 MJ/$, and a value of 7.3 MJ/$ in the Л2-А1-
MiniCAM scenario, which contains the highest energy-intensity 
in driving altemative energy demand patterns in short-term (to 
2010-2020) scenario studies (e.g., lEA, 1998; EIA, 1997, 
1999). Over the longer term (i.e., the time horizon considered 
by the SRES scenarios), economic stmctural and technological 
changes become more pronounced, as does their influence on 
energy intensity improvements and energy demand. This does 
not imply that prices do not matter over the long term, but 
simply that "everything else" (e.g., AEEI) is likely to outweigh 
the impacts of prices, as indeed suggested by quantitative 
scenario analyses performed within the Energy Modeling 
Forum EMF-14 (Weyant, 1995). 
Important feedback mechanisms between technological 
change and costs (and thus also prices) exist over the long term. 
These are as a rule treated endogenously in the models, for 
instance when modeling long-mn resource extraction costs or 
structural changes in energy supply options (see Sections 4.4.6 
and 4.4.7). Energy prices are also strongly affected by policies 
(e.g., taxation), but to project these far into the future is both 
outside the capability of currently available methodologies and 
outside the general "policy neutral" stance of the SRES 
scenarios. Therefore, most models treat dynamic changes in 
(average and marginal) costs 
as the driving force for energy 
intensity improvements and for technology choice (see 
Sections 4.4.6 and 4.4.7). 
4 . 4 . 5 . 1 . A l S c e n a r i o s 
Improvements in energy efficiency on the demand side are 
assumed to be relatively low in the AIB marker scenario, 
because of low energy prices caused by rapid technological 
progress in resource availability and energy supply technologies 
(see Sections 4.4.6 and 4.4.7). These low energy prices provide 
littie incentive to improve end-use-energy efficiencies and high 
income levels encourage comfortable and convenient(and often 
energy intensive) lifestyles (especially in the household, service, 
and transport sectors). Efficient technologies are not fully 
introduced into the end-use side, dematerialization processes in 
the industrial sector are not well promoted, lifestyles become 
energy intensive, and private motor vehicles are used more in 
developing countries as per capita GDP increases. Conversely, 
fast rates of economic growth and capital turnover and rising 
incomes also enable the diffusion of more efficient technologies 
trajectory within the 40 SRES scenarios. Thus, the A2 scenario's 
energy-intensity improvement rates are well within the uncertainty 
range as indicated by the scenario literature and are not considered 
overly pessimistic by the writing team. During the government review 
process, comment was made on the fact that energy intensities in A2 
are one-third higher than those in B2. This figure is classified as 
"reasonable" for an inter-family scenario variation by the writing team 
because it is consistent both with the underlying differences in per 
capita GDP (i.e. productivity) growth between the two scenario 
families and with the relationship between energy intensity 
improvements and шасго-economic producUvity giowth identified in 
the literature assessment in Chapters 2 and 3.

A n O v e r v i e w of S c e n a r i o s 
Box 4-7: The Role of Prices in SRES Scenarios 
The price of energy comprises many components: 
• 
Costs to establish and maintain the production, conversion, transport, and distribution infrastructure of energy supply. 
• 
Profit margins. 
• 
A whole host of levies such as royalties and taxes raised at the points of energy production or use. 
• 
Consumers' willingness to pay for quality and convenience of energy services. 
Fiuthermore, given the importance of energy and the vast volumes traded, prices are influenced by a whole range of additional 
factors, from inevitable elements of speculation to geopolitical considerations, all of which can decouple energy price trends 
from any underlying physical balance between supply and demand. Taxes are especially significant. In a number of OECD 
countries, up to 80% of the consumer price of gasoline is taxes (OECD, 1998), and the differences between countries are 
enormous. In 1997, 27% of the price of gasofine ui the USA was taxes, compared with 78% in France. Taxes vary substantially 
even between large oil producers (and exporters). In Mexico taxes are 13% of gasoline prices, but in Norway they are 75% 
(OECD, 1998). 
Currently, no methodologies exist to project future energy prices taking all of above mentioned facti)rs into account, nor were 
the SRES scenarios intended to make explicit assumptions on such factors such as future energy taxation. Price information 
enters long-term emission models either in the form of exogenous scenario assumptions, or it is derived internally m models 
based on simplified representations of price formation mechanisms usually based on (marginal) cost information. 
The six models used for SRES range from detailed "bottom-up" models (e.g., AIM, IMAGE), through macro-economic (partial 
equiübrium) models (e.g., MARIA, MiniCAM), to hybrid approaches (successive iteration between the engineering model 
MESSAGE with a macro-economic model, or using the Worldscan model with IMAGE). Each has different representations of 
price formation mechanisms and their relationship to macro-economic or sectoral energy demand. These are summarized in 
Appendix IV. As a rule, "bottom-up" (optimization) models calculate only (average and marginal) costs 
endogenously. As a 
result of their sectoral perspective (energy, agriculture, etc.), these models cannot determine macro-economic feedbacks on other 
sectors or the entire economy and thus are unable to represent a consistent picture of p r i c e formation. Conversely, price 
formation is endogenized in "top-down" models; however, these rely on the stringent assumption that demand and supply must 
be in equilibrium and in addition provide little sectoral detail. Over recent years this simplified modeling dichotomy has 
progressively weakened because of further advances in methodology and the development of "hybrid" modeling approaches. To 
illusti-ate the methodologies deployed in the six SRES models, two (MARIA and MESSAGE) are discussed here, but (for space 
limitations) only in terms of one scenario (B2). (Table 4-9 gives additional details of an mter-scenario comparison of energy 
prices for the MiitiCAM and ASF models. Owing to méthodologie differences, a comparison of prices across scenarios is only 
possible within a consistent approach (i.e. be comparing scenarios quantified with the same model).) 
The energy prices represented in MARIA (see also Mori, 2000) consist of energy production and energy utiUzation costs. Market 
prices are determined endogenously by model-calculated shadow prices (for further model details see Appendix IV and Mori 
and Takahashi, 1999). Among various parameters, the extraction costs of fossil fuel resources and the coefficients of utilization 
costs and their evolution over time are the most important determinants. For the M A R I A runs, the resource estimates of Rogner 
(1997) were used as input. For the sake of simplicity, all fossil resource categories of Rogner (1997) were aggregated mto two 
classes and a quadratic production function was used to interpolate the extiaction costs of reserves and all other occurrences. 
For coal, long-term extraction costs range up to US$6.3 per GJ in I990US$ prices, for gas up to US$25 per GJ, and for oil up 
to US$28 per GJ (see Appendix IV for further details). The energy cost coefficients (representing 16 different energy conversion 
technologies) are based on Manne and Richels (1992). For the B2 scenario quantification, the Manne and Richels (1992) 
estimates were largely retained. For instance, electricity generation costs range between 14 mills^^/kWh for gas to 51 mills/kWh 
for coal. (For the other scenario quantifications these cost values were modified to conform lo the different interpretations of a 
particular scenario storyline.) Together these assumptions determined long-ran costs and shadow prices that were set equal to 
energy prices in the macro-economic production function of MARIA. The energy prices were combined with assumed (low) 
AEEI values and potential GDP growth rates (the latter from the B2 marker) to calculate the resultant aggregate energy demand 
in the model. The resultant primary energy demand was (with exception of the REF region) within 15% of the respective B2 
marker quantification at the regional level and within 5% of global energy demand. As a result of different model structures, 
comparable price data for the MESSAGE model are only available for internationally traded primary energy forms (these are 
given in Table 4-8). 
26 1 mill is 0.1 USCents (US$0.001). 
A n O v e i - v i e w of 
Scenarios 
203 
The bottom-up, systems engineering (optimization) model MESSAGE does not compute energy prices. Instead, the model is 
entirely based on cost information, but such costs are treated as dynamic. Their overall treatment follows the lines outlined 
above for the MARIA model, except that greater technology-specific detail is contained m the model. Altogether 19 different 
fossil resource grades are differentiated, based on the estimates of Rogner (1997). The resultant (levelized) extraction costs for 
the B2 marker are in the range US$1.1 to US$5.4 per GJ for coal, US$1.2 to US$5.3 per GJ for oil, and US$1.2 to US$5.7 per 
GJ for gas (range indicates costs variations between lowest and highest costs of the four SRES regions for 2020,2050, and 2100 
respectively, see Appendix IV). Technology-specific cost assumptions cannot be summarized here as MESSAGE contains 
literally hundreds of energy supply and end-use technologies. Examples of cost assumptions are given in Section 4.4.7 and more 
detail is reported in Riahi and Roehrl (2000). However, as in MARIA, MESSAGE also calculates shadow prices for 
mtemationally traded primary energy forms and therefore these two indicators can be compared (Table 4-8).

Range between methanol, ethanol, and liquid hydrogen. 
To achieve consistency between model-calculated energy cost dynamics and energy demand assumptions an iterative modeling 
procedure between MESSAGE and MACRO (a macro-economic production function model based on Manne and Richels, 
1992) was used, on the basis of model-calculated shadow prices as indicators of fuhjre price dynamics. The methodology is 
described in more detail in Wene (1996). This approach requires time-intensive model iterations, but has the advantage that the 
impact of price increases can be separated from efficiency improvements through fuel substitution (e.g., a gas-fired cook stove 
energy end-use efficiency is up to 10 times higher than a traditional cook stove fired with fuelwood) as well as from "everything 
else," i.e., the AEEI in the traditional sense). Aggregated, the impact of (shadow) price increases in MESSAGE'S B2 scenario 
accounts for 8% of global primary energy demand by 2020, 23% by 2050, and 30% by 2100. This impact is calculated as a 
reduction in energy demand compared to a hypothetical scenario with constant 1990 prices (and correspondingly higher energy 
demand). The impact of price increases on future energy demand in the B2 scenario is thus relatively small compared to that of 
other factors, although far from negligible. This also explains why the two B2 scenario quantifications by MARIA and 
MESSAGE have quite similar energy demand figures, even if intemational trade prices may differ. First, trade prices are only 
one compœient of the cost-price mechanism treated in the models (which also includes domestic energy production, 
conversion, and end-use costs). Second, models differ in their parametrizations of the "everything else" (AEEI) model 
parameters, for which a wide range of views on applicable ranges exists. Therefore it is one of the model calibration parameters 
frequently used to replicate existing scenarios or to standardize inter-model comparison projects such as EMF-14 (Weyant, 
1995).

intensity improvement in Annex I countries is around 1.16% per 
year, and in non-Annex I countries 1.44% over the 100 years to 
2100. Thus, final energy use for A l is much higher than those in 
the A2, B l , and B2 scénarios, with a substantial long-term

The various A l scenarios indicate a wide range in energy 
intensity improvements and resultant energy demand. A l B -
MESSAGE tracks closely the global and regional energy 
demand patterns of the A l B marker and so satisfies the 
criteria of a "fully harmonized" scenario, albeit that ASIA 
deviafions from the A l B marker amount to about 20% during 
the period 2030 to 2060. Other scenaiios indicate, for 
example, higher energy demand in 2050 (e.g., Al-ASF) 
and/or lower energy demand in 2100 (e.g., A l B - I M A G E , 
AIB-ASF, and AIB-MARIA). Differences are regionally 
heterogeneous and result from: 
• 
Higher GDP growth rates assumptions compared to those 
of the A l B marker (e.g., Al-MiniCAM for OECD90).

• 
Combination of all three above factors. 
The differences in model representation of these factors along 
with the available time and resources have not allowed a 
detailed analysis of the numerous underlying differences in 
energy intensities across the scenarios. For instance, final 
energy use in the A l v l - M i n i C A M and A l v 2 - M i n i C A M 
scenarios reaches about 60% only of the final energy use 
described in the A l marker. However, both scenarios describe 
very different worlds with respect to economic growth but 
share the assumption of saturating per capita energy use at 
levels of 150 GJ/capita. A l l else being equal, scenarios of lower 
GDP per capita growth (e.g. Alv2-MiniCAM) generally also 
assume lower improvement rates in energy intensity, consistent 
with the literature (as discussed in Chapter 3). Generally, the 
range between energy intensity across scenarios is larger in the 
1990 base year than toward the end of the simulation horizon. 
This 
results 
from 
alternative 
estimates 
and 
model 
specifications of non-commercial energy use (excluded in 
some models), which yield large differences in 1990 energy 
intensities. Over time - and consistent with the high-income 
characteristics of an A l world - the use of non-commercial 
energy declines and is ultimately phased out altogether. Thus, 
by 2100 differences in energy intensities across models 
become much smaller. An interesting set of scenarios was 
explored in the A I T group. In these the diffusion of a whole 
host of new energy end-use technologies (e.g., microturbines, 
fuel cells) results in substantial additional gains in efficiency 
and hence higher energy intensity improvements and lower 
final energy demand at equal or lower energy costs compared 
to the other A1 scenarios. 
4 . 4 . 5 . 3 . A2 S c e n a r i o s 
Final energy intensities in the A2 (ASF) marker scenario 
improve steadily, with the exception of the ALM-region 
between 1990 and 2020 because of material and energy 
intensive infrastructure build-up. The fastest reduction occurs 
in the REF region as its energy-intensive 
economy 
progressively restructures. The slowest improvements are 
projected for the OECD90 region, because of slow capital 
2 0 6 
A n O v e r v i e w of 
S c e n a r i o s 
turnover rates (GDP growth of 1.6% per year between 1990 
and 2100). The final energy demand across regions is 
determined by the product of regional GDP growth and energy 
intensity improvements. For example, the higher energy 
intenshies in ASIA compared to the A L M region lead to a 
higher absolute final energy demand in the former in spite of a 
lower GDP. This is explained by differences in initial 
conditions and by delayed diffusion of more efficient energy 
end-use technologies, because of lower GDP per capita growth. 
4 . 4 . 5 . 4 . H a r m o n i z e d a n d O t h e r A2 S c e n a r i o s 
The global primary energy use and final energy use in the A2 
scenarios created with the AIM, MESSAGE, and MiniCAM 
models are quite close to those of the marker scenario, while 
A2-IMAGE scenario projects lower primary and final energy 
use compared to the A2 marker. As mentioned above, the A2-
Al-MiniCAM scenario explores a very different unfolding of 
driving forces in terms of population and GDP growth, 
combined with an assumption about saturating energy demand 
at current Western European levels. Combined, these 
assumptions translate into the lowest energy intensity 
improvement rates across the SRES scenario set. Global 
primary energy use per unit of GDP (intensities) improves 
from 14.7 MJ/US$90 in 1990 to 8.9 MJ/US$90 in 2100. This 
reflects mainly the low per capita GDP (productivity) growth 
of this scenario which (other factors being equal) translates 
into low rates of energy intensity improvement. Nonetheless, 
the resultant energy intensities are comparable to current 
Westem European levels, as are income and energy use per 
capita. In other words, the scenario describes a global picture 
by 2100 quite similar to that of Westem Europe of today, 100 
years earlier. 
4.4.5.5. 
B l S c e n a r i o s 
Energy intensity improvements in the В1 marker result from 
energy efficiency investments brought about by increases in 
fuel and electricity prices and technological innovations 
(including assumptions on taxes and perceived premium values 
for clean fuels). The rather high rates in energy intensity 
reduction in В1 stem also from the explicit assumption that less 
industrialized regions catch-up. Another factor is the 
assumption that monetary economic growth in less developed 
regions initially largely replaces activities in the informal 
economy, which leads to a replacement of traditional non­
commercial energy 
forms by high-efficiency modern 
applications and fuels - and hence substantial energy intensity 
improvements. In the developed regions the high economic 
growth in the В1 scenario may, for instance, be in the form of 
increasing monetization of human activities previously not 
included in GDP accounts (e.g., childcare, household work). 
Such monetary GDP growth does not result in additional 
demands for energy services, and hence again results in 
significant energy intensity improvements. The demand for 
electricity is assumed to rise faster than that for non-electricity 
energy, and may pose one of the capital availability constraints 
in this scenario. 
4.4.5.6. 
H a r m o n i z e d a n d O t h e r B l S c e n a r i o s 
Various altemative scenario quantifications were developed for 
В1 by the modeling teams. For the fhst four to five decades 
most model runs show a global final energy use within the 
proposed bounds of the B l marker, except B l - A S F which is 
higher. By 2100 most scenarios assume higher final energy use 
than the marker run, except ВI-MESSAGE which reproduces 
closely the final energy use of the B l marker (and is 
correspondingly classified as a "fully harmonized" scenario). 
In parficular, B I - M A R l A , BlHigh-MiniCAM, and BlHigh-
MESSAGE show a global final energy use in 2100 nearly twice 
that of the marker. These scenarios explored the implications 
for energy demand of less rapid "dematerialization" tendencies 
of the economy, especially for developing countries, with 
trends in line with historical energy intensity experiences in the 
OECD countries. Regional trends differ most dramatically for 
the M i n i C A M and MARIA runs for ASIA and A L M , with the 
MiniCAM simulations assuming a saturating (converging) 
energy use on a per capita basis at 125 GJ/capita. However, 
current knowledge about rates and direction of demateriali­
zation of economic activities is limited. Therefore, both 
historical OECD trends and their applicability to the future 
economies of currently developing countries may not 
necessarily reflect future developments. The use of altemative 
modeling approaches in the quantification of the B l scenario 
storyline has helped to shed light on this important area of 
uncertainty of the future. 
4.4.5.7. 
B2 S c e n a r i o s 
Final energy demand for the B2 marker was derived by 
applying efficiencies of end-use technologies to the demand of 
electric and non-electric energy services. These in tum depend 
on the economic development rates, income levels, and 
sectoral economic stmcture of each region. The evolution of 
the final energy demand levels and structure in the developing 
regions follows patterns that are similar to the historical 
development in the now-industriafized regions of the world. 
This again is consistent with the "dynamics-as-usual" 
interpretation of the B2 storyline. By successive iterations with 
a macro-economic model, marginal cost increases are taken 
into account in the energy demand projections of the 
MESSAGE model for the B2 marker (see Appendix IV). The 
resuh is an aggregate energy-intensity improvement rate at the 
global level of about 1% per year until 2100, about the same as 
has prevailed over the past 100 years in countries for which 
such long-term time series data are available (see Chapter 3). 
This aggregate global improvement rate masks important 
differences in the temporal and spatial evolution of energy 
intensities. Improvements are generally higher in regions far 
away from the energy-intensity frontier and also faster in those 
for which the capital turnover rate (i.e., GDP growth) is higher. 
Consistent with the more imperfect realization of future trends 
characteristic 
of 
the 
B2 
scenario, 
energy 
intensity 
improvements are slower than in the A l or ВI scenario 
families, but higher than in the A2 scenario family.

The energy intensity and resultant global growth in final 
energy demand of the В 2 marker is matched reasonably well 
by other scenario quantifications until about 2050; the B2-AIM 
scenario shares "fully harmonized" input assumptions at the 
global and regional levels alike over the entire time horizon. By 
2100, however, differences become larger, and in particular the 
two MiniCAM scenarios show lower final energy intensity 
improvements compared to the B2 marker and other B2 
scenarios. The MiniCAM scenarios were developed to explore 
high-end sensitivities for GHG emissions in the B2 scenario 
family by assuming higher energy demand, combined with a 
high reliance on coal in the B2High-MiniCAM scenario. 
Different scenarios at the regional level illustrate altemative 
interpretations, with particularly large variations in the REF 
and A L M regions. Altemative scenarios indicate up to 50% 
lower energy use in REF (e.g., B2-IMAGE) and up to 50% 
higher energy use in A L M (B2-MiniCAM, 
B2High-
MiniCAM) compared to the В 2 marker. The alternative 
scenarios illustrate that uncertainties in future 
energy 
intensities and resultant final energy demand are generally 
larger for developing and transition economies compared to the 
OECD90 region. Among other reasons, this is a function of the 
much higher uncertainties with respect to future economic 
growth rates in these regions. 
An interesting observation (considering the SRES multi-model 
approach) is that the changes in stmcture of final energy are 
similar in the four markers of the SRES scenario families, even 
though these are derived from four different modeling 
approaches and describe very different futures in terms of 
demographic, socio-economic, and energy development 
(Figure 4-7).^** The trend is toward energy reaching the 
consumer in more flexible, more convenient, and cleaner 
forms. This reflects that people with higher income are willing 
to pay more for more convenient energy forms (e.g., even if 
coal were cheaper than gas, everybody would rather heat with 
gas than coal). Therefore, the final energy mix is characterized 
by growing importance and dominance of grid-dependent 
fuels, such as electricity, district heat, and gas. Consistent with 
the storylines and the higher income levels of A l and B l , this 
change in final energy structure is faster in these scenario 
families than in the other two scenario families. The structural 
shift is slowest in scenario A2, with scenario B2 taking an 
intermediate position. These scenario differences mainly 
reflect differences in per capita income levels.

Resource 
Availability 
Section 3.4 in Chapter 3 reviews energy resources and 
technologies. Here existing reserves 
(identified quantities 
recoverable at today's prices and with today's technologies), 
r e s o t i r c e s that have yet to be discovered or that need 
foreseeable techno-economic progress to become available in 
the future, and other o c c u r r e n c e s of hydrocarbons in the 
Earth's crust are considered. Oil, gas, and uranium occur in 
deposits that need to be located, and the exploration for new 
resources is related to the needs for production over the next 
few 
decades rather than to a need to define what might 
ultimately be available for exploitation. Thus the ultimate 
resource base is uncertain. Coal, on the other hand, occurs in 
seams over wide areas and very little exploration is needed to 
give an estimate of potentially available resources. Wbether or 
not they could be mined with given technologies and 
economics remains the most important uncertainty. Finally, 
2^ Correspondmg data were not available foi all scenarios developed 
with other models, and hence a detailed comparison across the entire 
SRES scenario set was not possible.

A n O v e r v i e w of S c e n a r i o s 
new renewable sources of energy are dependent on ongoing 
technological development and cost reductions. 
The conventional oil industry is relatively mature and the 
question is at what point in the 2P' century will the current 
reserves start to run out. However, unconventional resources 
are also available - shale oil, bitumen, and heavy oil. These are 
starting to be exploited and they will extend current 
conventional oil i-eserves. The gas industry is less mature and 
much more remains to be discovered, particularly in areas that 
do not currently have the infrastructure to utilize gas and 
consequently exploration has been unattractive. Additionally, 
large amounts of unconventional gas have been identified, 
some of which are already in commercial production (e.g., in 
the US). Also, huge quantities of natural gas are believed to 
exist as methane hydrates on the ocean floor (see Chapter 3) 
and it is possible that technology to exploit these will be 
developed at some stage. For uranium and thorium, the 
amount of exploration to date has been very limited, and hence 
the possibilities of discovering new deposits are enormous. It 
is likely that even a major expansion of the nuclear industry 
will not be limited by the amount of available uranium or 
thorium. With coal, the question is not one of discovery but 
one 
of economics, accessibility, 
and environmental 
acceptability. 
To consider future resource availability as a dynamic process, 
however, does not resolve the inherent uncertainties in terms of 
future success rates of hydrocarbon exploration, technology 
development for either non-conventional fossil resources or 
non-fossil alternatives, or future energy prices. Therefore, these 
uncertainties are explored by adopting different scenario 
assumptions that range from low to (very) high resource 
availability (see Table 4-4), consistent with the interpretation of 
the various scenario storylines presented in Section 4.3. This 
scenario approach is especially important given that 
hydrocarbon occurrences are the largest storage of carbon. 
IPCC WGII SAR (Watson et a l . , 1996) estimates the size of the 
total carbon "pool" in the form of hydrocarbon occurrences to 
be up to 25,000 GtC. How much of this eventually could 
become atmospheric emissions is at present unknown, and 
depends on the future evolution of technology, prices, and 
other incentives for future hydrocarbon use and their 
alternatives. 
Given that long-term emission scenarios invariably rely on 
quantification by formal models, an important distinction 
needs to be made between assumptions concerning the ultimate 
resource base and projected actual resource use. Typically, 
assumptions on the ultimate resource base enter models as 
exogenously specified 
c o n s t r a i n t s - cumulative future 
production simply cannot exceed values specified as the 
resource base. Actual resource use, or what is frequently 
termed the "call on resources" conversely depends on 
numerous other factors represented in models, such as: 
• 
Future price levels (either assumed as exogenous inputs 
or determined endogenously in the model). 
• 
Assumptions on future technology improvements that 
either enable unconventional hydrocarbons to be 
"mined" economically or, conversely, that draw on non-
fossil alternatives and/or non-climate environmental 
and social constraints (e.g., limits on particulates and 
sulfur emissions or on land degradation and mining 
accidents). 
Their complex interplay results in scenarios of future 
cumulative resource use being the most appropriate indicator, 
as opposed to exogenously pre-specified resource-base 
constraints, especially in view of the multi-model approach 
adopted to develop the SRES scenarios. Table 4-10 and Figures 
4-8 to 4-10 summarize the results for the four SRES marker 
scenarios and of the ensemble of SRES scenarios for their 
respective scenario families and scenario groups (in the case of 
the A l scenario family). It is evident that, in the absence of 
climate policies, none of the SRES scenarios depicts a 
premature end to the fossil-fuel age. Invariably, cumulative 
fossil-fuel use to 2050 (not to mention 2100) exceeds the 
quantities of fossil fuels extiacted since the onset of the 
Industrial Revolution, even though the "call on" fossil 
resources differs significantiy across the four marker scenarios. 
This increase is higher in the scenarios that explore a wider 
domain of uncertainty on future fossil-resource availability. 
For n o n - f o s s i l r e s o u r c e s , like uranium and renewable energies, 
future resource potentials are primarily a function of the 
assumed rates of technological change, energy prices, and 
other factors such as safety and risk considerations for nuclear 
power generation. Generally, absolute resource constraints do 
not become binding in the marker scenarios or other scenarios. 
The contribution of these resources is substantially below the 
physical flows identified in Section 3.4, and therefore resuhs 
mainly from scenario-specific assumptions concerning 
technology availability, performance, and costs. These are 
summarized in Section 4.4.7. 
4 . 4 . 6 . 1 . A l S c e n a r i o s 
Energy resources are taken to be plentiful by assuming a large 
future availability of coal, unconventional oil, and gas as well 
as high levels of improvement in the efficiency of energy 
exploitation technologies, energy conversion technologies, and 
transport technologies. The grades of energy resources used in 
the model differ on the basis of extraction costs. When 
combined witl; the level of improvement in efficiency of 
exploitation technology (expressed as the rate of improvement 
in marginal production costs), the graded costs of energy-
resource exploitation determine the energy production costs 
(prices) and hence the ultimate resource extraction quantities. 
For A I , large amounts of unconventional oil and natural gas 
availability were assumed. Cumulative (1990 to 2100) 
extraction of oil ranges between 15 and 30 ZJ in the A l 
scenarios (AIB marker, 17 ZJ); for gas the range is between 23 
and 48 ZJ (AIB marker, 36 ZJ) and for coal the range is 
between 8 and 50 ZJ (AIB marker, 12 ZJ). Resource 
availability and reliance uncertainties are also explored through

additional scenario groups. Three of these (AlC, 
AIG, 
and 
AIT) explore more extreme pattems of reliance on particular 
resources and technologies compared to the more "balanced" 
tendencies described in the AIB scenarios, including the A I B 
marker. As discussed in Chapter 3 and Section 4.3.1, this 
characteristic of the A l scenario family stems from the 
interpretation of technological change and resource availability 
as being cumulative and path dependent. 
4 . 4 . 6 . 2 . A l S c e n a r i o G r o u p s 
Besides the AIB marker scenario group, altemative pathways 
unfold within the A l family, according to diverging technology 
and resource assumptions (Figures 4-8 to 4-10). Two of these 
groups (AlC and AIG) were merged into one fossil-intensive 
group (AlFI) in the SPM. The more detailed information on 
these two groups is presented here, in Chapter 5 and Appendix 
V l l (see also footnote 1). 
The coal-intensive scenario group A l C is restricted mainly to 
conventional oil and gas, which results in the lowest 
cumulative oil and gas use (15 to 19 ZJ) of all scenarios; it is 
even slightly lower than in the B2 scenario, which has much 
lower energy demand. As such, the scenario illustrates the 
long-term GHG emission implications of quickly "running out 
of conventional oil and gas" combined with rapid technological 
progress in developing coal resources and clean coal winning 
and conversion technologies. As a result, cumulative coal use is 
very high - between 48 and 62 ZJ (median, 60 ZJ) between 
1990 and 2100. 
Conversely, oil and gas resources are assumed to be plentiful in 
the world of scenario group A I G because of the assumed 
development 
of 
economic 
extraction 
methods 
for 
unconventional oil and gas, including methane clathrates. 
Cumulative oil and gas extraction amounts to 76 to 88 ZJ, 
about twice as high as in the A l C scenario group. Mainly this 
reflects current perceptions that radical technological change 
needs to оссш' to translate a more significant portion of the 
resource base of unconventional oil and gas into potentially 
recoverable reserves, a development evidentiy also cross­
checked by possible developments in non-fossil alternatives. 
Cumulative coal extraction in A I G is relatively low at 15 to 38 
ZJ (median, 19 ZJ) across the scenarios of this scenario group. 
As a result of fast technological progress in post-fossil 
altematives in the technology-dynamic AIT scenario group, the 
call on oil and gas resources is comparatively modest -
cumulative extraction to 2100 ranges between 36 and 46 ZJ, 
quite similar to the A l C scenario group. The main difference is 
that because of the improvements in non-fossil alternatives the 
call on coal resources remains modest - cumulative coal use of 4 
to 12 ZJ (median: 10 ZJ) in AIT is the lowest of all the scenarios. 
4 . 4 . 6 . 3 . A2 S c e n a r i o s 
Resource availability assumptions for the A2-ASF world are 
generally rather 
conservative, essentially that current 
conventional estimates of petroleum resource availability are 
not expanded.^^ Unconventional hydrocarbons, such as 
methane clathrates and heavy oils, do not come into large-scale 
use. As a result, coal resource use is the highest among the 
SRES 
marker 
scenarios. The A S F marker 
scenario 
quantification of oil, natural gas, and coal resource availability 
reflects the Rogner (1997) estimates for conventional oil and 
coal resource availability and the recent IGU (1997) estimates 
for conventional gas reserves (optimistic scenario, see Chapter 
3). Resource extraction costs in the ASF depend on the 
resource "grade" and vary from US$2.6 to 5.2 per GJ for oil (in 
1990 dollars), from US$1.2 to 4.6 per GJ for gas, and US$0.7 
to 6.0 per GJ for coal. 
4 . 4 . 6 . 4 . 
H a r m o n i z e d a n d O t h e r A2 S c e n a r i o s 
The primary energy structure of the A2 family scenaiios is also 
reflected in the cumulative fossil 
fuel resource 
use, 
characterized by an increasing reliance on coal resources (see 
Figures 4-8 to 4-10). The cumulative oil use varies by a factor 
of two across the A2-family, between 11 and 24 ZJ (median, 18 
ZJ; A2 marker, 17 ZJ). Cumulative gas use ranges between 20 
and ZJ 36 (median, 23 ZJ; A2 marker, 25 ZJ). The higher end 
of the range of gas resource use occurs in the A2G-1MAGE 
scenarios, which explored the scenario sensitivity to assuming 
that a significant fraction of methane hydrate occurrences 
become technically and economically recoverable in an A2 
world. Given the regional orientation of the A2 scenario 
storyline and the resultant quest for energy independence, the 
possibihty of tapping even currently "exotic" fossil resources 
certainly merits such a scenario sensitivity analysis. The 
opposite end of the resource availability spectmm is explored 
in the MiniCAM scenarios of the A2 scenario family. First, 
methane clathrates are assumed not to become available. As a 
result, the call on resources focuses on coal (A2-MiniCAM) or, 
in a scenario sensitivity analysis, more on unconventional oil 
and gas (A2-A1-MiniCAM). The range of reliance on coal 
resources is thus an inverse image of the range of oil and gas 
resource availability. Cumulative coal extraction varies 
between 22 and 53 ZJ (median, 35 ZJ; A2 marker, 47 ZJ) 
across the scenarios of the A2 scenario family. This picture 
mainly represents what used to be termed "conventional 
wisdom" in much of the scenario literature (including the 
previous IS92 scenario series). Importantly, while the 
probabilities of alternative developments of fossil and non-
fossil resource availability cannot be assessed at present, the 
multi-model, 
multi-scenario approach 
described here 
demonstrates 
that the uncertainties in fossil resource 
Even with this "conservative" assumption cumulative oil extraction 
in the A2 marker scenario totals 16 ZJ, or 2.7 times currently 
identified, recoverable oil reserves (6 ZJ or 143.3 billion tons; BP, 
1999). Thus, the A2 scenario also assumes that in future it will be 
possible to continue the historical trend in which large quantities of 
(undiscovered or presently uneconomic) oil r e s o u r c e s are transferred 
into recoverable r e s e r v e s . Some analysts consider such a future trend 
as definitely optimistic (see the literature review in Chapter 3).

availability might be much larger than assumed a decade ago. 
This finding also reflects the results of IPCC WGII SAR 
(Watson e t a l . , 1996). 
4.4.6.5. 
B l S c e n a r i o s 
Assumpfions on the fossil fuel resource-base used in the B l 
marker scenario quantification are based on the estimates of 
ultimately recoverable conventional and unconventional fossil 
resources described in Rogner (1997). The capital output ratio 
of resource exploitation is assumed to rise with progressive 
resource depletion, but this is counteracted by learning curve 
effects in the marker scenario quantification provided by the 
IMAGE model. Regional estimates of the exploitation costs of 
conventional and unconventional resources of Rogner (1997) 
were used to construct long-term supply cost curves as of 1971. 
These values, rather than absolute upper bounds on resource 
base availability, define future resource availability in the 
IMAGE model. The supposed availability of huge non-
conventional occurrences of oil and natural gas, with a 
geographic distribution markedly different from the distribution 
of conventional oil and gas, has significant implications for fuel 
supply and trade patterns in the long term. For coal resources, 
Rogner's (1997) estimates were also adopted; of the total of 262 
ZJ, 58 ZJ belong to the categories of proved recoverable, 
additional recoverable, and additional identified coal resources. 
The 
production costs of coal were assumed to rise with 
increasing depth and rising labor wages, but these costs are 
largely offset by mechanization (in underground mining) and 
economies of scale (in surface mining). 
4.4.6.6. 
H a r m o n i z e d a n d O t h e r B l 
S c e n a r i o s 
The call on oil resources in the scenarios that comprise the В1 
scenario family ranges between 11 and 20 ZJ, with a median of 
17 ZJ (Bl marker, 20 ZJ). For gas the range is 15 to 33 ZJ 
(median, 20 ZJ; B l marker, 15 ZJ), and for coal the 
corresponding range is between 3 and 27 ZJ (median, 11 ZJ; 
Bl marker, 13 ZJ). An overview is given in Figures 4-8 to 4-
10. 
4.4.6.7. 
B2 S c e n a r i o s 
The availability of fossil energy resources in the B2 marker 
scenario is assumed to be conservative, in line with the gradual, 
incremental change philosophy of the B2 scenario storyline. 
Consequentiy, oil and gas availability expands only gradually 
while coal continues to be abundant. Assumed oil and gas 
resource availability does not extend much beyond current 
conventional and unconventional reserves. 
Through gradual 
improvements in technology, a larger share of unconventional 
resei-ves and some additional resource categories are assumed 
to become available at improved costs over the 21" century. 
The availability of oil and gas, in particular, is Umited 
compared to the estimated magnitude of global fossil resources 
and occurrences (Watson et a i , 1996). This translates into 
relatively limited energy options in general and extends also to 
non-fossil energy options. 
4 . 4 . 6 . 8 . H a r m o n i z e d a n d O t h e r B2 S c e n a r i o s 
Altemative B2 scenario implementations assumed similar order 
of magnitudes of resource availability as the B2-marker scenario, 
except for B2High-MiniCAM. The resultant cumulative resource 
use (1990-2100) ranged between 9 and 23 ZJ (median, 17 ZJ; B2 
marker, 19 ZJ) for oil, between 18 and 27 ZJ (median, 21 ZJ; B2 
marker, 27 ZJ) for gas, and between 12 and 55 ZJ (median, 21 
ZJ; B2 marker, 13 ZJ) for coal (see Figures 4-8 to 4-10). The 
largest uncertainties relate to different inteipretations of the more 
gradual changes under a "dynamics-as-usual" philosophy that 
characterizes the B2 scenario storyline. One group of scenarios 
(including the B2 marker) assumed a gradual expansion in the 
availability of conventional and unconventional oil and gas, 
whereas another group of scenarios adopted more conservative 
assumptions (akin to the A2 and В1 scenario families).^'' All else 
being equal, lower resource-availability assumptions for oil and 
natural gas lead to a higher reliance on coal and non-fossil 
altematives and explain, together with technology assumptions, 
the differences in emissions between altemative В 2 scenario 
quantifications discussed in Chapter 5. 
4.4.7. 
Technological 
Change 
Chapter 3 highlights the importance of technological change in 
long-run productivity growth, but also for the historical 
transformations of energy end-use and supply systems. The 
importance of technological change in explaining wide-ranging 
outcomes in future emissions has been highlighted by Alcamo 
et a l . , (1995) and Grübler and Nakicenovic (1996), among 
others. The latter reference also provides a critical assessment 
of the previous IS92 scenario series and its comparison to the 
literature. Prominent scenario studies of possible technological 
change in future energy systems in the absence of climate 
policies include Ausubel et a l . (1988), Edmonds et a l . (1994, 
1996a), IIASA-WEC (1995), and Nakicenovic et a l . (1998). 
Future technology characteristics must therefore be treated as 
dynamic, with future improvement rates subject to considerable 
uncertainty. This is reflected in the SRES scenarios that adopt a 
wide range of improvement rates for energy extraction, 
conversion, and end-use technologies (Table 4-11). The actual 
representation of technological change in the six SRES models 
ranges from exogenously prescribed availability, through cost 
and performance profiles (which in some cases also include 
consumer or end-use costs for technology use), to stylized 
representation of leaming processes.^' Yet, as summarized in 
Chapter 3, model representations of technological change are 
poorly developed, although evolving rapidly. 
^" Resource availability assumptions also appear to be rather model 
specific in this scenario family. For instance, in many scenarios 
pattems of resource availability resemble the hypotheses retained by 
a particular model used for quantification of a marker scenario in one 
of the other three scenario families. 
'^ Roehrl and Riahi (2000) provide a description of the methodology 
of representing technological change in MESSAGE as used here in 
the SRES scenarios.

" Technology improvement rates in the A2 scenario are heterogeneous among the world regions. 
B l : The assumed time-dependent leaming coefficients range from 0.9 (i.e. a 10% reduction in the capitahoutput ratío on a doubling of 
cumulated production) for oil, 0.9-0.95 for gas, and 0.9-0.95 for surface coal mining to about 0.94-0.96 for non-fossil electric power 
generation options and 0.9-0.95 for commercial biofuels. 
In the specific model implementations, "inconvenience costs" of energy-end use, including social externalities costs, are expected to be 
particularly important for tradhional coal technologies (e.g., underground mining, cooking with coal stoves). 
4 . 4 . 7 . 1 . A l S c e n a r i o s 
The 
A I B marker scenario represents the "balanced" 
technology development group of A l scenarios; it assumes 
significant innovations in energy technologies, which improve 
energy efficiency and reduce the cost of energy supply. 
Consistent with the A1 scenario storyline, such improvements 
occur across the board and neither favor nor penalize particular 
groups of technologies. A l assumes, in particular, drastic 
reductions in power-generation costs, through the use of solar, 
wind, and other modem renewable energies, and significant 
progress in gas exploration, production, and transport. For a 
different view, altemative scenario groups embedded within 
the overall A l scenario family explore pathways of cumulative 
technological change; that is, path-dependent scenarios in 
which technologies evolve on mutually largely exclusive 
development paths. In general this has been the historical 
experience, in which the success of particular energy 
technologies (the steam engine in the 19"' century, or intemal 
combustion in the 20'*') have "locked out" other technological 
altematives. These scenario groups explore altemative spectra 
of technology dynamics in the domains of unconventional oil 
and gas, coal, as well as post-fossil technologies. Salient 
technology assumptions are described below. 
Keeping in mind the very different degrees of technological 
detail and the mechanisms for technology improvements 
represented in the different models, a consistent inter-scenario 
comparison of technology assumptions is best achieved within 
the framework of one particular model. An overview of 
different technology developments for the scenario groups of 
the A l scenario is given in Box 4-8 for the AIM model, which 
was also used to develop the A I B marker scenario. (A 
comparison with die MARIA model indicated that technology 
cost assumptions and their dynamics are quite congruent.) To 
illustrate differences in technology chai-acteristics that drive the 
four different SRES scenario families, conesponding scenario-
specific data based on MESSAGE data are presented at the end 
of this Section. 
4 . 4 . 7 . 2 . A l S c e n a r i o G r o u p s 
As outlined above, besides the marker, three different groups 
of A l scenarios were developed by the different modeling 
groups (combined into two in the SPM, see also footnote 1). hi 
total, nine altemative runs are clustered in thi'ee scenario 
groups based on the A I M , M A R I A , 
MESSAGE, and 
MiniCAM models. 
In the A I G scenario group, technological change enables a 
larger fraction of the large occurrences of unconventional oil 
and gas, including oil shales, tar sands, and especially methane 
hydrates (clathrates) to be tapped. High technological leaming 
and cost reduction effects could lower unconventional oil and 
gas extraction costs by approximately 1% per year and 
conversion technology costs by about factor of two (AIG-
MESSAGE, see Roehrl and Riahi, 2000). As mentioned in 
Section 4.4.6, ahhough these assumptions yield higher 
extractions of unconventional oil and gas resources, they are 
not sufficient to tap significant fractions of unconventional 
resources such as gas clathrates. Future scenario studies might 
reassess the current state of knowledge on possible technology 
development of these "exotic" fossil-fuel occurrences and the 
conditions under which they could become a major future 
source of unconventional hydrocarbon supply (and a massive 
source of carbon emissions). For the A I G scenario group,

pipeline grids and entirely new natural gas pipelines systems

Box 4-8: Technological Change in the AIM-based Quantifications for the A l Scenario Family 
The A l storyline describes a world with rapid economic development. High economic growth results in pressures on resource 
availability, counterbalanced by technological progress, which is assumed to be highest among the four scenario families. In the 
A I M quantifications of the A l storyline, rates of technological change are high both with respect to "supply push" factors (most 
notably RD&D) as well as with respect to "demand pull" factors (most notably high capital tumover rates). Since large resource 
availability and high incomes stimulate demand growth, technological change in energy supply receives a higher emphasis 
compared to changes in energy end-use technologies. Common technology assumptions in the A l scenarios can be summarized 
as follows. 
The supply of oil, gas, and biomass in the A l scenario family is assumed to be very high and results from high rates of 
technological progress for fossil fuel and biomass exploitation technologies. Unconventional oil and gas, such as deep-sea 
methane hydrates, oil shale, etc., become available at relatively low cost. Also, large amounts of biomass are utilized through 
well-developed biomass farm plantations and harvest technologies, and biomass utilization technologies, such as biomass power 
generation and biofuel conversion technologies, become available at low costs through R D & D and other mechanisms of 
technology improvements (leammg by doing and leaming by using). High levels in the use of other renewable energy are 
reached when technologies for solar photovohaics and thermal utilization, wind farms, geothermal energy utilization, and ocean 
energy are introduced at low cost. Energy end-use technologies are assumed to progress at medium rates compared with the fast 
rates of technological change in energy supply technologies. 
The A l B marker and A I T scenarios assume drastic reductions in cost for solar, wind, and other renewable energies. A l C 
assumes lower coal costs and emphasizes coal exploitation technology progress and the introduction of advanced coal-fired 
power generation technology, such as integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC). A I G assumes lower oil and gas costs than 
other A l scenarios. The cost of nuclear power is assumed to be the lowest in A I G and AIT, and highest in A l C . The different 
cost assumptions that drive and result from technological change in the A l scenario family are summarized in Table 4-12.

As mentioned above, improvements in energy efficiency on the demand side are assumed to be comparatively lower in the A l 
scenario family, except for the AIT scenario, because the low energy prices give very little incentive to improve end-use energy 
efficiencies. Efficient technologies are not fully introduced into the end-use side, dematerialization processes in the industiial

sector are not promoted, lifestyles become energy intensive, and private motor vehicles are used more in developing countries 
as per capita incomes increase. As a result, energy efficiency improvement m the industrialized countries (IND) is around 0.8% 
per year, and in developing countries (DEV) it is 1.0% per year over the next 100 years to 2100. Only AIT assumes greater 
efficiency improvements (1.1% per year for IND and 1.5% per year for DEV), as a result of the diffusion of new highly efficient 
energy end-use devices such as fiiel cell vehicles. 
Technology progress is also assumed for land-use changes and suffur emissions. Higher productivity increases in biomass and 
crop land (1.5% per year) in comparison to 0.5-1.0%) are assumed for the A l world in the AIM quantification compared to 
those in the A2 and B2 scenario families. Desulfurization technologies could be introduced because of concems of economic 
damage caused by acid rain and there would be strong financial support to install these technologies with the rapid income 
growth associated with the A l world. 
from Siberia and the Caspian to South East Asia, China, Korea, 
and Japan after 2010/2020 would be needed. Since 
unconventional oil and gas resources are distributed unevenly 
geographically, the scenario implies both capital-intensive 
infrastructure investments and unprecedented large-scale gas 
and oil trade flows. There is also little pressure to develop non-
fossil altematives in such scenarios, so costs of non-fossil 
altematives remain comparatively high, even after significant 
technological improvements. For instance, solar electricity 
costs could drop to US$0.05 per kWh (AIG-AIM). 
The high-growth coal-intensive scenario group A l C assumes 
relatively large cost improvements in new and clean coal 
technologies, such as coal high-temperature fuel ceils, IGCC 
power plants, and coal liquefaction. More modest assumptions 
are made for all the other technologies, except for nuclear 
technologies in AlC-MESSAGE, as this requires zero-carbon 
options to ease resource and environmental constraints. The 
relative costs between coal and oil- or gas-related technologies 
also shift in A l C - A I M . Progress in renewables is also assumed 
to be substantial. For instance, solar photovoltaic costs would 
decline to USCents3/kWh (AlC-AIM). 
In the dynamic technology scenario group AIT, technological 
change, driven by market mechanisms and policies to promote 
innovation, favors non-fossil technologies and synfuels, 
especially hydrogen from non-fossil sources. Liquid fuels from 
coal, unconventional oil and gas sources, and renewables 
become available at less than US$30 per barrel, with costs that 
fall further, by about 1% per year, through exploitation of 
learning-curve effects (AIT-MESSAGE). AIT-MARIA also 
projects declining costs for biofuels, from about US$30 to 
US$20, after the 2020 period (and in comparison to the A l -
M A R I A scenario biofuels substitute coal-derived synfuels). 
Non-fossil electricity (e.g., photovoltaics) begin massive 
market penetration at costs of about USCents 1 to 3 per kWh 
(AIT-MARIA, AIT-MESSAGE, AIT-AIM), and could 
continue 
to 
improve 
further 
(perhaps 
as 
low 
as 
USCentsO.l/kWh in AIT-MESSAGE) as a resuh of learning-
curve effects. A n important difference between the marker 
scenario A l B and the AIT group is that in AIT additional end-
use efficiency improvements are assumed to take place with the 
diffusion of new end-use devices for decentralized production 
of electricity (fuel cells, microturbines). As a result, final 
energy demand in the A I T scenario group is between 30% 
(AIT-AIM, AIT-MESSAGE) and 40% (AIT-MARIA) lower 
compared to the A l B marker scenario. 
4 . 4 . 7 . 3 . A2 S c e n a r i o s 
The A2 scenario family includes slow improvements in the 
energy supply efficiency and a relatively slow convergence of 
end-use energy efficiency in the industrial, commercial, 
residential, and transportation sectors between regions. A 
combination of slow technological progress, more limited 
environmental concems, and low land availability because of 
high population growth means that the energy needs of the A2 
world are satisfied primarily by fossil (mostly coal) and nuclear 
energy. However, in some cases regional energy shortages 
force investments into renewable alternatives, such as solar and 
biomass. For instance, intermittent renewable electricity 
supply options, such as solar and wind, are assumed to decline 
in costs to about USCents4/kWh and (because of storage 
requirements) to about twice that value when these intermittent 
sources are used for medium load applications (50% of 
electricity supply). 
4 . 4 . 7 . 4 . B l S c e n a r i o s 
Consistent with the general environmentally conscious and 
resource-conservation thrust of the B l scenario storyline, 
technological change is largely directed at improving 
conversion efficiency rather than costs for fossil technologies. 
Within the SRES Teims of Reference, no additional climate 
initiatives are assumed that could bar the application of certain 
technologies or yield forced diffusion of others. The theimal 
efficiency of centrally generated electricity is assumed to rise 
to 45% (conventional coal) or to 65% (gas combined cycles) by 
2100, while specific investment costs decline sfightly from 
1990 levels. It is assumed that subsidies on coal for electricity 
generation are removed entirely. A specific feature of the 
IMAGE model used to generate the В1 marker scenario is that 
it treats non-fossil electricity generation technologies as highly 
generic; for instance, it does not distinguish between nuclear, 
solar, or wind-power generation technologies. The specific 
investment costs of generation options for non-fossil electricity 
and of the production and conversion of commercial biofuels 
are assumed to fall by 5-10% for every doubling of cumulated 
A n O v e r v i e w of 
S c e n a r i o s 
215 
production. Cost decreases down to USCents2.5^Wh are 
anticipated once non-fossil options penetrate on a large scale. 
The costs of gaseous biofuels in the major producing regions 
(Latin America, Africa, NIS) are assumed to be in the order of 
US$3 to 5 per GJ from 2020 to 2030 onward. Liquid biofuels 
are produced in small amounts in almost all regions at costs in 
the order of US$3 to 6 per GJ. In all regions a gradual transition 
occurs from fossil fuels to non-fossil options in electric-power 
generation, because of rising fuel prices and declining specific 
investment costs for fossil alternatives. Learning rates were 
assumed, conservatively, to yield 2 to 6% cost reductions for 
every doubling of cumulative production. The shift would start 
in resource-poor industrialized regions such as Japan and 
Western Europe, but is somewhat tempered by rising 
conversion efficiencies of fossil-fueled power plants. One of 
the factors that constrains the use of natural gas in the scenario 
is the assumption that only a limited part of the transport 
market is open to competition from non-liquid fuels (between 
50% around 2050 to 80% around 2100). Also, the market share 
of coal in industry is fixed exogenously at 10 to 15% in some 
regions, to reflect the decreasing environmental and social 
attractiveness of the more "dirty" coal. 
4.4.7.5. 
B2 S c e n a r i o s 
The approach that underlies the B2 scenario storyline translates 
into important future improvements of technologies, albeit at 
more conservative rates than in scenarios A l or B l , but with 
higher rates than in scenario A2. Compared to A I and В1, cost 
improvements are more modest, because of the regionally 
fragmented technology policies assumed to characterize a B2 
world. Hence, technology-spillover effects and benefits from 
shared development expenditures are more limited in the 
scenario. The high emphasis of environmental protection at the 
local and regional levels is reflected in faster development and 
diffusion of energy technologies with lower emissions, 
including advanced coal technologies, nuclear, and renewables. 
For instance, solar and wind electricity-generating costs are 
assumed to decline to USCents3/kWh, that is, a similar level as 
assumed for the long-term costs of advanced, clean coal 
technologies (such as IGCCs). As conventional oil supplies 
dwindle, initially high-cost synfuels from coal and also 
biofuels are introduced as substitutes. With increasing 
production volume, costs are assumed to decline from initial 
levels of some US$7/GJ to US$2.6/GJ. Conventional coal 
technologies undergo 
the 
lowest aggregate rates of 
improvement in the scenario and are also subject to increasing 
controls of social and envnonmental extemalities (mining 
safety, particulates, and sulfur emissions). Increasingly, 
therefore, only advanced coal technologies are deployed. 
Nonetheless, extraction and conversion costs increase, 
especially in regions with a large share of deep-mined coal and 
in high population density agglomerations. In regions with 
abundant surface minable coal reserves (e.g.. North America 
and Australia), coal extraction costs remain relatively low. 
4.4.7.6. 
H a r m o n i z e d a n d O t h e r S c e n a r i o s 
As a consequence of the "multi-model approach" used in 
SRES, detailed improvement assumptions and scenario 
implementations for individual technologies vary greatiy from 
one model to another, 
although the same storyline 
characteristics were used as guiding principles and many 
scenarios share similar assumptions on improvement potentials 
for different technologies. Detailed quantitative comparisons 
are difficult because of different time profiles of technology 
improvements assumed in the different models, different 
representations of regional technology, and the modeling of the 
intemational diffusion of technology. For instance, many 
models assume aggregate regional rates of technological 
change (e.g., MARIA, M i n i C A M , ASF), whereas others 
attempt to represent spatial and temporal diffusion pattems 
more explicitly (e.g., MESSAGE, 
AIM). 
It is difficult to quantify the influence of varying technology-
specific scenario assumptions on scenario outcomes, because 
in most model simulations the technology assumptions were 
varied 
in 
conjunction 
with 
other 
salient 
scenario 
characteristics, such as economic growth and resource 
availability (e.g. in the MiniCAM simulations). Therefore, the 
impact of ahemative assumptions with respect to technological 
change can be best quantified within a particular scenario 
family and with "fully harmonized" scenario quantifications 
(i.e. with comparable energy demand), as discussed for the A l 
scenario groups above. In some scenarios within other scenario 
families, technology-specific sensitivity analyses 
were 
performed, such as in the B2C-MARIA scenario vaiiant of the 
B2-MARIA quantification. The main differences between the 
two 
scenarios are the respective costs of coal and nuclear 
power. In B2C-MARIA, the price of coal was assumed to be 
US$1.4/GJ, while that in B2-MARIA is US$1.8/GJ. In 
contrast, the capital costs of nuclear power stations are 
US$1400/kW in B2-MARIA, while those in B2C-MARIA are 
assumed to remain at US$1800/kW. Thus, even comparatively 
small variations in relative technology characteristics such as 
costs and efficiencies can lead to wide differences in scenario 
outcomes. As discussed in Chapter 5, for instance, changing 
the relative economics between coal and nuclear in the two 
MARIA scenarios results in a difference of more than 200 GtC 
cumulative emissions^^ over the 2P' century 
An illustration of inter-scenario variability in technology costs 
and diffusion is given in Box 4-9 for the MESSAGE model 
simulations for one representative scenario of each scenario 
family and scenario group. As stated above, differences in 
technology diffusion across scenarios are influenced by many 
more factors than just altemative technology characteristics 
and cost assumptions. Growth of energy demand, resource 
availability and costs, and local circumstances (local air-
quality regulations that require desulfurization of fuels or stack 
Cumulative carbon emissions (all sources) are 1359 GtC for B2-
M A R I A and 1573 GtC for B2C-MARIA (see Chapter 5).

gases, or land availability and prices that influence biomass 
costs) are also important determinants of speed and potentials 
for the diffusion of new energy technologies.

Prospects 
for F u t u r e Energy 
Systems 
In the energy systems models used to generate the scenarios 
reported here, the entire energy systems structure is 
represented 
from primary energy 
extraction, 
through 
conversion, transport, and distribution, all the way to the 
provision of energy services. Primary energy harnessed from 
nature (e.g., coal from a mine, hydropower, biomass, solar 
radiation, produced crude oil, or natural gas) is converted in 
refineries, power plants, and other conversion facilities to give 
secondary energy in the form of fuels and electricity. This 
secondary energy is transported and distributed (including 
trade between regions) to the point of final energy use. Final 
energy is transformed into useful energy (i.e., work or heat) in 
appliances, machines, and vehicles. Finally, application of 
useful energy results in delivered energy services (e.g., the 
light from a light bulb, mobility). 
Important differences exist in accounting conventions on how 
to calculate the primary energy equivalent of particularly 
renewable and nuclear energy (see Watson et a l . , 1996). To 
assure comparability of model results, the SRES writing team 
agreed to adopt as a common accounting methodology the 
Box 4-9: Dynamics of Teclinological Change in the MESSAGE-Based Quantifications for the Four SRES Marker 
Scenarios. 
Technological change in energy supply and end-use technologies has historically been a main driver of structural changes in 
energy systems, efficiency improvements, and improved environmental compatibility. Yet, despite its crucial role, the 
mechanisms that underlie technological innovation and diffusion of new technologies remain poorly understood, so modeling 
technological change as an endogenous process to the economy and society is still in its infancy. Historically, the track record 
of technology forecasts has at best been mixed, with a number of notable failures particularly in the energy sector. In the 1960s, 
for mstance, R&D in the US attempted to develop nuclear-propelled aircraft, and nuclear electricity was anticipated to become 
"too cheap to meter." Conversely, the dynamic technological changes in microprocessors, information technologies, and 
aeroderivative turbines (and their combination with the steam cycle in the form of combined cycle gas turbines) were largely 
underestimated. This is similar to the pessimistic market outlook for gasoline-powered cars at the end of the 19"' and start of the 
20* centuries. 
In recognition of the considerable uncertainty in describing future technological tiends, a scenario approach was adopted to vary 
technology-.specific assumptions in the MESSAGE model runs of the SRES scenarios. Depending on the specific interpretation 
of the four SRES scenario storylines, altemative technologies and altemative ranges of their future characteristics were assumed 
as model inputs. 
Two guiding principles determined the choice of particular technology assumptions in MESSAGE. 
First, technologies not yet demonstrated to function on a prototype scale were excluded. Therefore, for instance, nuclear fusion 
is excluded from the technology portfolio of all SRES scenarios calculated with the MESSAGE model. However, production of 
hydrogen- or biomass-based synfuels (e.g. ethanol) or advanced nuclear and solar electricity generation technologies are 
included, as they have demonstrated their physical feasibility at least on a laboratory or prototype scale, or m some specific niche 
markets (even if they are uneconomic at currently prevailing energy prices). Second, the range of technology-specific 
assumptions is empnically derived. Statistical distributions of technology characteristics based on a large technology mventory 
(consisting of 1600 technologies) and developed at IIASA (Messner and Strubegger, 1991; Strubegger and Reitgmber, 1995) 
were used. Means, maxima, and nunima from these distributions (e.g. of estimated future technology costs) guided which 
particular values to adopt across scenarios on the basis of the scenario taxonomy suggested by the scenario storylines (ranging 
from conservative to optimistic). 
Tables 4-13a to 4-13e summarize the technology characteristics and resultant dilfusion rates across the four SRES scenario 
families and their scenario groups. Table 4-13a presents a brief overview of a selection of major energy technologies represented 
in the MESSAGE model. (Being a detailed "bottom-up" model, MESSAGE Hterally contams hundreds of individual 
technologies, too many to summarize here; mstead, only the most hnportant technology groups, aggregated across many 
individual technologies, are presented.) Table 4-13b summarizes salient technology characteristics hi terms of levelized costs 
(investment and operating costs levelized per unit energy output, excluding fuel costs) and Table 4-13c summarizes the resultant 
marker deployment (diffusion) of these technologies by 2050 and 2100 for the B2-MESSAGE marker scenario. This scenario 
is characterized by intermediate levels of growth in energy demand and conservative assumptions as to future technological 
change. The latter were adopted based on a literature survey (Strubegger and Reitgruber, 1995) as well as an expert opinion poll. 
A n O v e r v i e w of 
S c e n a r i o s 
2 1 7 
In particular, the B2-MESSAGE scenario adopted technology characteiistics of the equally conservative IIASA-WEC Scenario 
В (Nakicenovic et a l . , 1998), which was based on the Strubegger and Reitgruber (1995) analysis, complemented by a review 
of some 100 energy experts assembled by WEC. Table 4-13d indicates how technology costs in the other MESSAGE scenarios 
differ from those of the B2 scenario. (The prevalence of negative values in Table 4-13d indicates that most scenarios are more 
optimistic concerning cost improvements of future technology than the MESSAGE B2 scenario.) Finally, Table 4-13e indicates 
the difference in market deployment (diffusion) of the other MESSAGE SRES scenarios compared to that of the B2 scenario. 
Positive values indicate higher market deployment, and negative ones show lower diffusion. However, differences across 
scenarios in terms of technology diffusion are not governed by technology costs alone. Other technology characteristics (such 
as efficiency and infrastructure availability) and market (demand) growth are also important in determining market deployment 
rates and diffusion potentials of energy technologies. 
Simplifymg the complex dynamic patterns of technological change across the scenario groups, one conclusion is that perhaps 
the single most important dichotomy of energy technologies of relevance for future GHG emissions is between advancements 
in "clean coal" and other fossil (e.g. methane hydrate) technologies (delivermg electricity, gas, or syrüiquids) and those of 
decentralized hydrogen-powered fuel cells, combined with nuclear and renewable energy (for hydrogen production). The first, 
GHG-intensive technology cluster largely follows traditional centralized technological configurations of the energy sector The 
latter represents both radical organizational and technological changes. The revolutionary change may well be less the 
hydrogen-powered fuel cell car itself, but rather that it could generate electricity when parked, dispensing entirely the need for 
centralized power plants and utilities.

direct equivalent method for all non-thermal uses of 
renewables and nuclear. The primary energy equivalence of 
these energy forms is accounted for at the level of secondary 
energy, that is, the first usable energy form or "currency" 
available to the energy system. For instance, the primary 
energy equivalence of electricity generated from solar photo-
voltaics or nuclear power plants is set equal to their respective 
gross electricity output, not to the heat equivalent of radiation 
energy from fissile reaction, the solar radiance that falls onto a 
photo-voltaic panel and is converted into electricity with 
efficiencies that range from 10% to 15%, or the heat that would 
have to be generated by buming fossil fuels to produce the 
same amount of electricity as generated in a photo-voltaic cell 
or a nuclear reactor (as used in the so-called "substitution" 
accounting method). This common^^ SRES accounting 
convention must be bome in mind when comparing the 
primary energy-use figures of this report with those of other 
studies, which invariably use different accounting methods 
depending on the organization that produces the scenario. An 
illustration of the sensitivity of different accounting methods 
on estimates of primary energy use in long-term energy 
scenarios is given in Nakicenovic et a l . (1998). (See also the 
discussion in Chapter 2, in which scenario comparisons are 
based on index numbers rather than absolute figures to account 
for these definitional differences.) 
Adopting 
a 
common 
accounting 
convention 
avoids 
misrepresentation of the contribution of renewable and other new 
energy forms, which can be both under- or over-represented by 
inconsistent accounting conventions, as continues to be the case in 
energy statistics and scenario studies. 
Table 4-14 gives an overview of primary energy use in the four 
SRES marker scenarios and the range of all SRES scenarios. 
Figure 4-11 illustrates both the historical change of world 
primary energy structure over time and future changes as given 
in the SRES scenarios. Each comer of the triangle coiTesponds 
to a hypothetical situation in which all primary energy is 
supplied by a single source - oil and gas at the top, coal at the 
left, and non-fossil sources, renewables (including wood), and 
nuclear at the right. The historical change reflects major 
technology shifts from the traditional use of renewable energy 
flows to the coal and steam age of the 19* century, and 
subsequently to the dominance of oil and internal combustion 
engines in the 20* century. In around 1850 (lower right of 
Figure 4-11), only about 20% of world primary energy was 
provided by coal; the other 80% was provided by traditional 
renewable energies (biomass, hydropower, and animal energy). 
With the rise of industrialization, coal substituted for 
traditional renewable energy forms, and by 1910 (lower left of 
Figure 4-11) around three-quarters of world primary energy 
use relied on coal. The second major transition was the 
replacement of coal by oil and later by gas. By the early 1970s 
(see 1970 point labeled on Figure 4-11), 56% of global primary 
energy use was based on oil and gas. From the early 1970s to 
1990, 
the global primary energy structure has changed little, 
although efforts to substitute for oil imports have led to an 
increase in the absolute amount of coal used and to the 
introduction of non-fossil altematives in the OECD countries 
(e.g., nuclear energy in France). Rapid growths in energy 
demand and coal use, particularly in Asia, have outweighed 
structural changes in the OECD countries.

Figure 4-11 also gives an overview of the evolution of the 
global energy system between 1990 and 2100 as reflected in 
the SRES scenarios. The four marker scenarios are shown as 
thick lines. In addition, for each scenario family the area 
sparmed by all the SRES scenarios in that family is marked in 
the same color as the trajectory for the respective marker. The 
SRES scenarios cover a wider range of energy structures than 
the previous IS92 scenario series, reflecting advances in 
knowledge on the uncertainty ranges of future fossil resource 
availability and technological change. Scenarios B l , B2, AIT, 
and to some extent A I B follow a trend toward increasing 
shares of zero-carbon options in the long term. A I G more or 
less follows an oil-gas isoshare line that perpetuates the current 
dominance of oil and gas in the global energy balance far into 
the 2V^ century. Scenarios in group A l C indicate a near 
doubling of coal's share in primary energy use. Also of interest 
is the trajectory of the A2 marker scenario, which returns in its 
energy stracture by 2100 (over 50% coal share) to the situation 
that prevailed almost 200 years before (i.e., around 1900). 
However, even with similar fuel shares, the technologies, end-
use fuels, and applications projected in the A2 scenario are 
radically different from those of the past. 
4 . 4 . 8 . 1 . A l S c e n a r i o s 
The most significant change in the long-term primary energy 
mix in the A l B - A I M marker scenario is the fast market 
penetration of (new) renewable energy. Its share increases from 
Renewables/Nuclear 
Figure 4-11: Global primary energy structure, shares (%) of oil and gas, coal, and non-fossil (zero-carbon) energy sources -
historical development from 1850 to 1990 and in SRES scenarios. Each comer of the triangle corresponds to a hypothetical 
situation in which all primary energy is supplied by a single source - oil and gas, coal at the left, and non-fossil sources 
(renewables and nuclear) to the right. Constant market shares of these energies are denoted by their respective isoshare lines. 
Historical data from 1850 to 1990 are based on Nakicenovic et a l . (1998). For 1990 to 2100, altemative trajectories show the 
changes in the energy systems structures across SRES scenarios. They are grouped by shaded areas for the scenaiio families 
A l , A2, B l , and B2 with respective markers shown as lines. In addition, the four scenario groups within the A l family (AI, 
A i e , A I G , and AIT) that explore different technological developments in the energy systems are shaded individually. The 
A l C and A I G scenario groups have been merged into one fossil-intensive A l F I scenario group in the SPM (see footnote 1). 
For comparison the IS92 scenario series are also shown, clustering along two trajectories (lS92c,d and IS92a,b,e,f). For model 
results that do not include non-commercial energies, the corresponding estimates from the emulations of the various marker 
scenarios by the MESSAGE model were added to the original model outputs.

a current 3% (excluding traditional non-commercial biomass 
use) to some 66% by 2100. Given the assumption of rapid 
technology progress, the costs of modem renewable energy 
technologies (solar, wind, commercial biomass, etc.) decline 
significantly in the long-term (see Section 4.4.7). Such low 
costs could make solar energy the largest primary energy 
source by 2100. Commercial, "high-tech" biomass also 
increases substantially, and contributes 18% of primary energy 
supply by 2100 globally. In the meantime, the shares of coal 
and oil decrease from 25% and 36% in 1990 to 12% and 15%, 
respectively, by 2050, and decline thereafter either because of 
depletion of conventional oil resources or because of fast 
market penetration of post-fossil technologies (in the case of 
coal). Gas increases its market share initially (from 20% in 
1990 to 33% by 2050) and declines thereafter, but still 
maintains an important market share (24%) by the end of the 
2P' 
century. Nuclear is mainly a transient "backstop" 
technology - its share increases from 2% in 1990 to some 10% 
by 2050, and declines to 4% by 2100 because its economics 
increasingly fall behind those of new renewables. Overall, 
consistent with the high-income characteristics of the A l 
scenario family, the share of traditional, non-commercial 
biomass use declines. By 2100 its use has virtually 
disappeared. 
4 . 4 . 8 . 2 . A l S c e n a r i o G r o u p s 
Embedded in the overall storyline of the A l scenario famiiy arc 
the possible widely ranging technological bifurcations, each of 
which spans a "coiridor" of the future evolution of primary 
energy shares (see Figure 4-11). The A l C scenario group spans 
a range of structural change in future energy supply between 
the extremes of the A2 marker scenario and of the previous 
coal-intensive IS92 scenarios (IS92a,b,e,f). Conversely, the 
AIT scenario group spans a range of structural change in 
future energy systems delineated by the A l B and B l marker 
scenarios, respectively. In all of these the global energy system 
completes a structural shift initiated with the onset of the 
Industrial Revolution. This could draw to a close more than 
100 years from now, around 2100, with an energy system that 
predominantly relies on non-fossil energy sources, but 
evidently with a radically different technology portfolio of 
"high-tech" non-fossil energy compared to the "low-tech" non-
fossil energy of 1800. The second major difference is that even 
with somewhat similar primary energy structures, a b s o l u t e 
levels of demand would have increased by a factor 200 - 2000 
EJ by 2100 in the A I T scenario, compared to a mere 10 EJ in 
1800. Compared to all other scenarios, the A I G scenario group 
represents a distinct cluster in which the cuirent dominance of 
oil and gas is peфetuated throughout much of the 2P' century. 
This scenario cluster is somewhat difñcult to discern in Figure 
4-11, because of the absence of structural change as a result of 
which the scenario cluster in terms of primary energy shaies 
moves horizontally along the top part of the energy triangle. 
The only long-term fuel substitution that takes place is between 
coal and non-fossil altematives. 
4 . 4 . 8 . 3 . A2 S c e n a r i o s 
Major global trends in the A2 (ASF) 
marker scenario include 
an increase in the coal share (from 29% in 1990, through 30% 
by 2050, to 53% in 2100) and a reduction in the share of 
conventional oil (from 43% in 1990 to 23% by 2050, from 
where it declines asymptotically toward zero at the end of the 
2P' century). The progressive depletion of oil resources in the 
scenario reflects the prevailing view as to the finiteness of 
conventional oil resources,^* a picture also confirmed by other 
quantifications of the storyline (see discussion below). 
Nonetheless, the decline in oil market share should not be 
interpreted as a physical "running out," but rather as a gradual 
replacement process via price competition with synfuels and 
other altematives as oil prices rise, along with the need to 
access ever more remote and expensive petroleum deposits. 
Once oil becomes increasingly expensive (starting from 2030) 
a substantial proportion of coal is converted into synthetic 
liquid fuels. Nuclear and renewable energy sources gradually 
increase in importance from 1990 to 2100, while the share of 
natural gas remains almost constant. Substantial changes in the 
primary energy mix also occur at the regional level. Coal shifts 
from a currently dominant primai-y energy source only in ASIA 
and becomes the most important fuel in all the SRES regions. 
Natural gas remains the second or the third major fuel. Nuclear 
energy becomes important in OECD90 and ASIA regions, and 
biomass and other renewables in the A L M region. 
4 . 4 . 8 . 4 . H a r m o n i z e d a n d O t h e r A2 S c e n a r i o s 
The shares of different fuel types in all the A2 scenarios, except 
A2-IMAGE, are close to that of the marker scenario. As in the 
A2 marker, and with the exception of A2-IMAGE, coal 
becomes a major fuel by 2100 (45 to 50% of primary energy) 
in all the scenarios, followed by renewables (19 to 31%) and 
natural gas (9 to 18%). A higher share of renewables (biomass 
plus other) and a lower share of nuclear is the major difference 
between the scenarios (e.g., A2-MESSAGE shows the lowest 
nuclear share in primary energy of 7% in 2100). The 
A2G-
IMAGE scenaiio has a quite different energy supply structure 
in which natural gas is the most important source, followed by 
renewables and coal, as it was designed to explore the 
implications of larger gas availability in an A2 world. Table 4-
15 presents the primary energy structure of different A2 
scenarios. 
4.4.8.5. 
B l S c e n a r i o s 
The B l marker scenario in the IMAGE model describes a 
structural transition in energy systems toward increasing shares 
of non-fossil energy. This long-term transition features an 
interim reliance on fossil fuels, in paiticular with natural gas as 
the preferred transitional fuel. Structural changes in energy 
^* Nonetheless, cumulative oil extraction to 2100 equals 2.7 times the 
currently identified reserves of conventional oil in the scenario.

" A 2 - I M A G E "Other renewables" category includes nuclear and renewable sources except for biomass. 
supply are comparatively fast because of both the dynamic 
outlook on energy-efficiency improvements and structural 
change and the "dematerialization" of economic activities, 
characteristic of the B l world. With lower energy demand 
than in the other scenarios, technological innovation and 
diffusion initially translate into slower rates of structural 
change in primary energy supply (lower demand growth leads 
to lower investment in capacity expansion and hence fewer 
opportunities for technological learning). However, once 
underway, structural change translates into radical systems 
restructuring in the long term (i.e. post-2050). A persistent 
long-term trend of В1 is also the continuously declining share 
of coal in the global primary energy mix, caused by local and 
regional environmental considerations (airborne emissions, 
social and environmental impacts from large-scale mining 
activities, etc.). Until 2050, the global energy system remains 
fossil-fuel dominated (with an important shift away from coal 
to gas use within fossil fuels). By 2020, fossils still account 
for some 79% of global primary energy (23% coal, and 56% 
oil and gas combined). By 2050, fossils account for 69% 
(20% coal and 49% oil and gas). By 2100, however, the 
transition away from fossil fuels is well underway; they only 
account for some 47% of primary energy use, mostly natural 
gas. The non-fossil share mirrors in its growth the declining 
trajectory of fossil fuels. Generally, even this scenario of 
significant structural change illustrates the long lead times 
needed for an "orderly" transition away from the current 
dominance 
of 
fossil 
fuels. 
Energy 
efficiency 
and 
"dematerialization" of the economy are integral parts of this 
transition in the B l scenario. 
A distinguishing feature of the IMAGE model used to develop 
the B l marker scenario is the generic treatment of non-fossil 
fuel alternatives, which recognizes that the technology 
portfolio 
is particularly diverse 
and that 
numerous 
combinations are possible because of regional resource 
endowments, economics, technology policies, etc. A second 
important characteristic of the IMAGE modeling approach is 
the link between energy sector investments with future 
improvements in the form of a learning-curve approach. The 
model structure and methodology is described in more detail in 
Alcamo et a l . (1998) and de Vries et a l . (1994, 1999, 2000), 
(see also Appendix IV). 
4.4.8.6. 
H a r m o n i z e d a n d O t h e r B l S c e n a r i o s 
Other models have (in most instances-^^ with harmonized input 
assumptions) examined the uncertainties associated with the 
structural shift patterns described by the B l scenario family. 
Whereas long-term trends all point in similar directions, 
considerable scenario variability remains, a function of 
differences in energy demand, resource availability, and 
technology assumpfions (Table 4-16 and see Sections 4.4.6 and 
4.4.7). Relatively robust pattems across all B l scenarios 
include the continued importance of oil until about 2050 (15 to 
28%) and a subsequent decline thereafter. Three scenarios (Bl-
ASF, ВI-AIM, and В1-MESS AGE) indicate a more rapid 
decline to less than 10% market share by 2100, and three 
scenarios (the B l - I M A G E marker, B l - M A R I A , and B l -
MiniCAM) depict higher oil shares between 16% and 20% by 
2100, largely as a function of higher oil resource availability 
assumptions (see Section 4.4.6). For gas, all scenarios suggest 
a relatively robust market share range of between 21% and 
39% by 2050 and between 17% and 39% by 2100. Coal, 
biomass, and other non-fossil sources are largely substitutes for 
each other, depending on the specific cost assumptions used m 
the models. Whenever nuclear, renewable, and biomass costs 
are low, the share of coal declines (e.g., B l - A I M , Bl-MARIA, 
Bl-MESSAGE) and that of other sources increases, the degree 
of interfuel substitution being scenario (i.e. model) specific. 
Drastic shifts, however, are not anticipated before 2050. In 
most scenarios (except B l - M A R I A and Bl-MESSAGE) coal's 
share is around 20% by 2050, and declines to below 10% by 
2100 as biomass and other non-fossil sources gain respective 
market shares. Their diffusion is described more conservatively 
in the B l - A S F scenario, in which coal maintains a market 
share of about 22% until 2100.

B2 S c e n a r i o s 
The B2 (MESSAGE) marker scenario first follows a trend 
toward increasing shares of gas, followed by renewables, and 
finally - as oil and gas start to become scarce - increasingly 
returns to coal. By 2100, the B2 scenario ends up somewhere 
in the middle of the triangle in Figure 4-11 (i.e., it relies on a 
broad, diversified mixture of different primaiy energy sources). 
This global diversification results from heterogeneous trends at 
the regional level and is largely a function of the more modest 
assumpfions concerning technology improvements and oil and 
gas resource availability (compared to other scenario families, 
in particular A l and B l ) that are characteristic of the B2 
scenario family. By 2100, the main primary energy carriers are 
biomass (23%), coal (22%), oil and gas (29%), and other 
renewables and nuclear (26%). Countries with low income and 
high resource availability continue to rely on fossil fuels up to 
the end of the 2P* century, such as China (mainly coal), Fonner 
Soviet Union (mainly gas), and Middle East (first oil and later 
gas). Regions with low resource availability, such as Africa and 
South America, rely on renewables and nuclear. The decreasing 
share of coal and oil in the primary energy structure of OECD 
countries is substituted by the growing share of renewables, 
gas, and nuclear. A major characteristic of the B2 scenario is 
the increasing importance of synthetic liquid fuels in the 
second half of the 2P' century, because of a continuous phase 
out of conventional oil in all regions. 
4.4.8.8. H a r m o n i z e d a n d O t h e r B2 S c e n a r i o s 
Altemative B2 scenarios show a great diversity in changes in 
energy systems structures compared to the B2 marker. 
Common to all scenarios is their gradual transition away from 
conventional oil and gas, which are assumed to be 
comparatively scarce in the B2 scenario storyline. However 
alternative scenarios depict very different trends for this 
structural change, ranging from increased reliance on coal and 
coal-derived synfuels (B2-ASF, B2High-MiniCAM) to more 
biomass- and nuclear-intensive scenarios (B2-AIM, B2-
MARIA, and B2-IMAGE). Generally, this reflects the 
considerable uncertainty as to direction and pace of 
technological change in the technologically more fragmented 
worid described in the B2 scenario storyline. B2-MiniCAM 
anticipates a strong reliance on oil and natural gas as 
transitional fuels, with a share in primary energy of about 50% 
over the next 100 years to 2100 (i.e., gas shares in B2-
MiniCAM are as high as in the A I G scenario group). In tum, 
B2-ASF suggests an increasing reliance on coal and coal-
derived synfuels. A third group of scenarios tends to follow 
similar directions of structural change as those of the B2-
marker - a gradual introduction of post-fossil alternatives (with 
different weights for nuclear and renewables as a function of 
technological progress), along with gas (or in some scenarios 
coal-derived synfuels) as transitional technology options. 
Structural changes in energy systems of the various B2 
scenarios largely follow the main directions of the marker 
scenario developed with a particular model. That is, differences 
in alternative B2 scenarios appear to relate strongly to 
differences in model parametrizations derived from the 
respective marker scenario rans, most notably in the domains 
of resource availability and technology (see Sections 4.4.6 and 
4.4.7). Thus, B2-ASF depicts structural changes in energy 
technologies and systems akin to the trends of the A2 marker 
scenario, whereas B2-AIM and B2-IMAGE largely follow the 
pattems of change of their marker scenarios (Al and B l , 
respectively). Altemative pattems of change are illustrated by 
the B2-MiniCAM and B2-MARIA scenarios, which have also 
explored scenario sensitivities by developing altemative B2 
scenario quantifications (B2C-MARIA, B2High-MiniCAM) 
that show a higher reliance on coal (and hence higher G H G 
emissions).

Land-Use 
Changes 
The main driving forces for land-use changes are related to 
increasing demands for food because of a growing population 
and changing diets. In addition, numerous other social, 
economic, and institutional factors govern land-use changes, 
such as deforestation, expansion of cropland areas, or their re-
conversion back to forest cover (see Chapter 3). Global food 
production can be increased, either thi-ough intensification 
(e.g., using multi-cropping, raising cropping intensity, 
applying fertilizers, new seeds, improved farming technology) 
or through land expansion (e.g., cultivating land, converting 
forests). Especially in less developed countries, many 
examples show the potentials for intensification of food 
production in a more or less ecological way that may not lead 
to higher GHG emissions (e.g., multi-cropping; agro-forestry). 
Different assumptions on these processes translate into 
altemative scenarios of future land-use changes and GHG 
emissions, most notably C O ^ , methane (CH^), and nitrous 
oxide (N2O). A distinguishing characteristic of several models 
(e.g., AIM, IMAGE, MARIA, and MiniCAM) used in SRES is 
the explicit modeling of land-use changes from expanding 
biomass uses, and hence exploration of possible land-use 
conflicts between the energy and agricultural sectors. The 
con"e.sponding scenarios of land-use changes are summarized 
in Table 4-17 and Figure 4-12 for the four SRES marker 
scenarios and all SRES scenarios. The distinction in scenario 
groups is related to the energy system and is thus not relevant 
in this section. 
As discussed further in Chapter 5, model treatment of land-use 
change and base-year parameterization differ substantially. 
Therefore, comparisons between different models can yield 
substantial differences. Land-use change assumptions for each 
of the marker scenarios are described below. More detailed 
inter-model comparisons of land-use change and emissions 
models, as well as a deeper analysis of potentials and rates of 
change of main driving force variables, such as agricultural 
productivity growth and dietary changes, remain an important 
area for future research.

Figure 4-12: Global land-use patterns, shares (%) of croplands and energy biomass, forests, and other categories including 
grasslands - historical development from 1970 to 1990 (based on Bl-IMAGE) and in SRES scenarios. As for the energy 
triangle in Figure 6-3, each comer corresponds to a hypothetical situation in which land use is dedicated to a much greater 
extent than today to one category - 60% to cropland and energy biomass at the top, 80% to forests to the left, and 80% to 
other categories (including grasslands) to the right. Constant shares in total land area of cropland and energy biomass, forests, 
and other categories are denoted by their respective isoshare lines. For 1990 to 2100, altemative trajectories are shown for the 
SRES scenarios. The three marker scenarios A l B , B l , and B2 are shown as thick colored lines, and other SRES scenarios as 
thin colored lines. The ASF model used to develop the A2 marker scenario projects only land-use change related 
GHG 
emissions. Comparable data on land cover changes are therefore not available.The trajectories appear to be largely model 
specific and illustrate the different views and inteфretations of future land-use pattems across the scenarios (e.g. the scenario 
trajectories on the right that illustrate larger increases in grasslands and decreases in cropland are MiniCAM results). 
4.4.9.1. A l 
S c e n a r i o s 
In the AIM model, land-use changes at the beginning of the 2P' 
century follow largely historical trends. Over longer time 
horizons, the assumption is that land-use changes are driven 
primarily by economic forces, consistent with the A l scenario 
storyline. Expected land rents and agricultural prices determine 
long-run land-use changes, based on an equilibrium approach 
of intemational agricultural markets. The AIM land-use model 
IS linked to the A I M energy module via biomass energy 
demand. In the A l scenario, the rapid increase in the demand 
for biomass energy raises the expected rent of biomass 
farmland. Reduction in forest area occurs until 2020 because of 
population growth and rapid increases of meat demand in the 
developing countries. Rising meat demands also result in a 
substantial expansion of grasslands and pasture. However, high 
incomes in scenario A l also increase the demand for 
environmental amenities. Hence, "demand" for forests also 
increases with economic growth, and the expected rent of 
forestiand is assumed to increase after 2020. These rising rents 
reduce the rate of deforestation and increase the area of 
managed tree-covered land in the latter half of the 2P' century. 
Rising food productivity also counterbalances the pressure on 
cropland and pastureland in the latter half of the 2P' century. 
For instance, crop productivity is assumed to grow on average 
by about 1.5% per year in the A l scenario family.^^ However, 
despite these counterbalances the demand for pastureland 
continues to increase throughout the 2P' century because of the 
high income growth and associated changes in diets. The 
resultant land-use changes for the A l marker scenario between 
1990 and 2100 are:

• 
Largely stationary trend of global cropland areas (-39

cropland areas). 
• 
Decline in global forest cover by some 92 million ha. 
• 
Increase of grasslands and biomass land-use of 188 and 
552 million ha, respectively. 
Land-use change patterns are more dynamic in the 
intermediate time periods, and also display a wide variation 
across different regions. 
4 . 4 . 9 . 2 . H a r m o n i z e d a n d O t h e r A l 
S c e n a r i o s 
By and large, land-use changes in other A l scenarios show a 
very wide range, being mostly model specific. As a rule, the A l 
land-use change scenarios take an intermediate position 
between the more extreme tendencies described by the 
respective storylines of the A2 and В1 scenario families (see 
Figure 4-12), which both result in large land-use changes 
(albeit 
of 
an 
entirely 
different 
qualitative 
nature). 
Corresponding scenario (model) differences are thus discussed 
below for these two scenario families where they are largest. 
4 . 4 . 9 . 3 . A2 S c e n a r i o s 
The ASF model used to produce the A2 marker scenario does 
not generate estimates of the area covered by different 
ecosystem types (e.g., forests, grasslands, etc.). However, the 
ASF 
deforestation module estimates the area of different 
tropical-forest types cleared annually for agricultural and other 
puфoses (Lashof and Tiipak, 1990). This information is 
subsequently 
used to estimate 
G H G emissions 
from 
deforestation. The A2-ASF scenario also includes estimates of 
natural carbon sinks and additional sinks attributable to re­
forestation and afforestation activities. These estimates are 
based on an extensive survey of available literature (Pepper et. 
a l . , 1998). 
By and large the land-use changes in the A2 marker scenario 
reflect conventional wisdom - in a high-population and low-
income world, natural land cover becomes progressively 
depleted, which is only partially counterbalanced by re- and 
afforestation activities. The size of the natural terrestrial carbon 
For comparison, the corresponding productivity growth rates in the 
other scenarios range from 1 % per year (B2-AIM) to 2% per year (B1 -
AIM), 
consistent with their respective storylines. This emphasizes 
productivity and efficiency (Bl) and more fragmented technology and 
productivity growth (B2). 
For A2-AIM, crop productivity growth rates 
range between 1% and 1.5 % per year in the DEV and IND regions, 
respectively; the difference is explained by only slowly closing 
productivity gaps (approximated by GDP/capita), characteristic of this 
scenario storyline. Similar differences also characterize other salient 
scenario assumptions of importance to land-use changes (like biomass 
yields, animal productivity, or the distribution of grain- versus range-
fed cattle). For instance, feed and protein yields from pasture land are 
assumed to grow at 1.5 % per year and biomass yields at 0.5 % per 
year in the A l scenario. 
sink (including forests, grasslands, wetlands, and other 
ecosystem types) in 1990 is estimated in ASF-A2 to amount to 
1.8 GtC (1800 IVItC). By 2050 this sink reduces to 0.8 GtC and 
by the end of the 2P' century terrestrial ecosystems become a 
net source of carbon. On the other side of the natural carbon 
balance is carbon sequestered by re- and afforestation. In A2-
ASF the respective (negative) carbon fluxes are estimated to

Out of the five A2 non-marker scenarios, A2-AIM and A2-
MiniCAM (and A2-A1-MINICAM) include explicit land-use 
patterns. Table 4-18 illustrates that the major difference 
between these quantifications is a higher energy biomass area 
assumption in A2-AIM. Among other differences is a higher 
percentage of cropland and grasslands in A2-MiniCAM and of 
forestiand in A2-AIM. 
4.4.9.5. 
B l S c e n a r i o s 
The most important indicators and assumptions made in the 
IMAGE land-use model relate to agricultural yields and diets 
that influence meat production, cattle population, and, in tum, 
grasslands land cover. Cereal yields (to 2100) for REF, ASIA, 
A L M , and the world average are assumed to increase by about 
a factor of four, while cereal yields for OECD90 start from a 
higher initial value and increase by only a factor of two. The 
total cattle population in the IMAGE model includes dairy and 
non-dairy cattle. Dairy cattle populations change as a result of 
milk production per animal and the demand for milk. Non-
dairy cattle populations change as a result of meat demand, 
slaughter weight, and off-take rate. The number of slaughtered 
animals (beef) increases in the period 1995 to 2060, the net 
result of increasing animal productivity and increasing human 
consumption of meat. The total number of cattie (dairy and 
beef) shows a decreasing trend beyond the year 2000, with the 
near-term increase in beef cattle more than offset by a decrease 
in the number of dairy cattle. The forest area reflects the result 
of 
increasing agricultural production and increasing 
productivity. The major increase in demand for food in the 
initial period 1995 to 2030 is nearly compensated by increasing 
productivity, with a resultant slow decline in forest area, while 
beyond 2030 forest areas start expand over abandoned 
agricultural land. Overall, the net balance of land-use changes 
in scenario B l between 1990 and 2100 suggests a considerable 
"greening" of the planet - a net increase in forest cover by 
some 1260 million ha, a decrease in cropland of 390 million 
ha, and an increase of about 200 million ha devoted to biomass 
production. Grasslands decline by 1540 million ha, partly 
because of the afforested areas mentioned above, but also 
because they are converted to other land uses. Thus, while the 
В1 scenario family is characterized by "high" rates of land-use 
changes, the quality of these changes ("greening") is entirely 
different compared to those of other scenario families (e.g. 
A2).

B2 S c e n a r i o s 
Since the MESSAGE model does not include a land-use-
change module, an external scenario for land-use change 
consistent with the underlying socio-economic assumptions of 
the B2 scenario was adopted. This scenario was developed by 
the A I M model in an iterative process between the two 
respective modeling teams to ensure consistency and 
harmonization in assumptions of driving-force variables (see 
AIM land-use model description above). In B2, population 
growth adds pressure on cropland expansion. Changing diets 
(higher meat demand) with rising incomes cause an expansion 
of pastureland. Land productivity increases were assumed to be 
more modest (e.g. compared to the A l scenarios), consistent 
with the more cautious expectations of the B2 scenario 
storyline and the intermediate values adopted for productivity 
increases of energy use. As a result, land-use changes are 
substantial. Stabilization of population growth combined with 
continued gradual increases in agricultural productivity 
relieves some of the land-use-change pressure, particularly for 
forests. As a result, post-2050 forest cover expands through 
reforestation and afforestation activities, consistent with the 
local environmental orientation of the B2 scenario storyline. 
Emission patterns related to land-use change closely follow 
these trends in land-cover changes. By 2100, global forest 
cover in B2 shows a net increase of 230 million ha, croplands 
by 330 million ha, and grasslands and biomass plantations by 
300 million ha each. This "greening" of long-term land-use 
patterns is at the expense of "other" land uses, and primarily 
involve reclamation of degraded lands, consistent with the 
emphasis on improving local and regional environmental 
quality and food and energy security outlined in the B2 
scenario storyline. 
4.4.9.7. 
H a r m o n i z e d a n d O t h e r B2 S c e n a r i o s 
Compared to the B2 marker scenario, alternative scenarios 
project a very wide range of possible future pattems of land-
use change. In fact, the range of resultant emissions for the B2 
scenarios is as large as the entire range spanned by the four 
SRES marker scenarios altogether. Similarly, as observed 
above for structural changes in energy systems, different B2 
scenarios are rather model specific and follow the general 
trends indicated by the respective marker scenario developed 
with a particular model. Overall, land-use related emissions 
decline, reflecting changes in driving forces such as increases 
in agricultural productivity. B2-MARIA and, of course, B2-
AIM are structurally similar to the B2 marker - declining 
deforestation and long-term shifts to maintain (B2-MARIA) or 
increase forest cover (B2-AIM) - whereas 
B2-MiniCAM 
projects a stabilization of deforestation only after 2050. 
Generally, B2-MiniCAM shows a substantial decrease in 
cropland area and an increase of grassland area.

E n v i r o n m e n t a l 
Policies 
The SRES scenarios quantified emissions of COj, 
CH^, NjO, 
NOj,, 
carbon monoxide, VOCs, SO^^, chlorofluorocarbons 
(CFCs), 
hydrofluorochlorocarbons, 
hydrofluorocarbons, 
perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride. A detailed 
discussion of the trajectories and the most relevant driving 
forces is presented in Chapter 5. In all cases herein, future 
emissions of these gases are affected by environmental policies 
not related to climate-change concems, as in the SRES Terms 
of Reference (see Appendix I). Efforts to protect the ozone 
layer will result in a significant decline in CFCs and some of 
their substitutes. Urban air quality concerns will have a 
significant influence on future emissions of indirect GHGs and 
of sulfate aerosols. As discussed in Chapter 3, for sulfur 
emissions the SRES scenarios reflect the evaluation of the IS92 
scenario series (Alcamo et a l . , 1995), the recent sulfur scenario 
literature (for a review see Grübler, 1998b), and sulfur control 
policies in the OECD countries and the beginning of similar 
developments in many developing countries (see Chapter 3). 
Thus, a range of environmental measures is assumed in all four 
SRES scenario families, although the magnitude and timing 
differ as a function of the four different scenario storylines. 
4 . 4 . 1 0 . 1 . A l S c e n a r i o s 
I n the A l scenario family, environmental policies are 
implemented as incomes rise and societies choose to protect 
environmental amenities. This first of all would concern water 
and air quality (health concems), but also traffic congestion 
and noise, as well as land-use policies (preservation of 
recreational spaces). Economic instruments are assumed to be 
the preferred policy instrument in an A1 world. In some of the 
2 3 0 
A n O v e r v i e w of 
S c e n a r i o s 
more "technology intensive" A l scenario groups, cleaner 
energy systems and lower G H G emissions are achieved as a 
by-product of high economic growth coupled with rapid 
technological change. 
4 . 4 . 1 0 . 2 . A2 S c e n a r i o s 
Environmental concems in their own right are perhaps the least 
important in the A2 world and they are mostly local in nature. 
For instance, no environmentally related barriers to nuclear 
energy development or environmental costs of fossil energy 
use are assumed. However, A2 scenarios include indirect 
control options for several GHGs that adversely effect local air 
quality. They also require vigorous environmental controls on 
pollutants that affect the availability of water, quality of soils, 
and productivity of agricultural crops to ensure food security is 
not jeopardized in a 15 billion person world. Hence, in terms of 
a number of traditional pollutants, A2 is far from an 
environmental "worst case" scenario, even if it generally has 
the highest GHG emissions. 
4 . 4 . 1 0 . 3 . B l S c e n a r i o s 
The B l scenario family assumes the most comprehensive 
environmental measures (see Section 4.3). Sulfur and nitrogen 
oxide 
emissions 
decline 
with 
vigorous 
efficiency 
improvements and "dematerialization" of the economy. 
Economic structural change (towai-d services) and cleaner 
energy systems (electricity, gas, district heat) to improve urban 
air quality also result in lower emissions levels compared to 
other scenarios. Finally, additional "add-on" technologies, 
such 
as 
flue-gas 
desulfurization 
and de-nitrification 
equipment, catalytic converters, etc., bridge the transition gap 
before inherentiy clean energy systems (e.g. IGCC based on 
coal or biomass, hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles) come 
into use on a global scale. Environmental consciousness would 
also lead less-developed regions to take such measures earlier 
and at lower income levels than occurred in the history of 
presentiy industrialized regions (as indeed already actually 
occurs; see Chapter 5) . 
4 . 4 . 1 0 . 4 . B2 S c e n a r i o s 
In B2 scenarios, environmental concems are prominent, but in 
contrast to the ВI world it is assumed that measures are 
implemented effectively only at local and regional scales. For 
instance, it is assumed that sulfur emissions would be 
progressively controlled and other local and regional problems 
conceming, for example, air quality, human health, and food 
supply would also be the focus of policies. 
4.5. 
Regional Scenario Patterns 
The scenarios imply different regional patterns of socio­
economic driving forces and resultant emissions. These are 
summarized in Table 4-19. 
Following the définition of the four world regions adopted in 
this report, the industrial region (IND) corresponds to the 
SRES regions OECD90 and REF, and the developing region 
(DEV) 
corresponds to the SRES regions ASIA and A L M . In 
1990, 
the base year of the SRES scenarios, driving-force 
variables as well as emissions are distributed unevenly. 
According to the statistics reported in Nakicenovic et a l . 
(1998), DEV countries account for 76% of global population. 
However, they only account for 16% to 36% of global 
economic activity (considering GDP at market exchange rates 
and purchasing power parities, respectively), 34% of primary 
energy use, and 42% of global CO2 emissions (including all 
sources, from energy plus land-use changes). 
Over time, the regional distribution of socio-economic activities 
and emission shifts in the scenarios, albeit because of different 
driving forces. These shifts range from rapid population growth 
(scenario family A2) and rapid economic development and 
catch-up (scenaiio family Al) in developing countries, to rapid 
"dematerialization" of economic activities in industrial 
countries (scenario family Bl). Generally, scenario family B2 
depicts the most gradual changes, and hence also the slowest 
rates of change in the global distribution of activities and 
emissions. Of all the SRES scenarios, A 2 - A l - M i n i C A M 
exhibits the slowest dynamics of development catch-up. 
Table 4-19 summarizes the main scenario 
indicators 
differentiated between industrial and developing countries. 
Two measures are given (following La Rovere, 1998): 
• 
Date when activities and/or emissions in developing 
countries reach those that prevailed in industrial 
countries in 1990. 
• 
Date when developing country values equalize those of 
industrial countries. 
In this comparison, developing countries in 1990 already 
accounted for 76% of world population and, because of the 
inevitable demographic momentum, their share is likely to 
increase further over the next few decades before altemative 
demographic projections branch out into different regional 
distributions. However, the basic pattern of dominance of 
developing countries in global population remains unchanged 
across all demographic projections. The share of developing 
countries in global population ranges between 80% ( A l , Bl) 
and 86% (A2, B2) by 2100 for demographic projections 
between 7 and 15 billion people. From the distribution of 
global population, the scenarios indicate an increasing 
importance of developing countries in the future, albeit at 
different rates. 
In consequence, as shown in Table 4-19, total GDP expressed 
at purchasing power parities in developing countries could 
reach 1990 levels in industrial regions between 2000 and 2010 
and equalize future industrial country levels between 2010 and 
2030. For GDP expressed at market exchange rates, the 1990 
"parity date" is reached between 2015 and 2030 and 
equalization in absolute terms even later, between 2030 and

2060. Total primary energy use in developing countries could 
reach 1990 industrial levels between 2005 and 2010, and parity 
in absolute terms between 2005 and 2020. Possible spatial 
distributions of economic activities based on satellite night 
imagery data that coiTelate highly with, for example, GDP and 
electricity use are discussed in Box 4-10. 
Conversely, scenario per capita indicators 
converge only 
slowly, sometimes well after 2100. Per capita GDP (expressed 
at market exchange rates) of developing countries reaches the 
1990 level of industrial countries at the earliest around 2050 
(scenario family A l ) and well after 2100 in scenario family A2. 
None of the four marker scenarios projects a situation in which 
per capita income in developing countries surpasses future 
levels of per capita incomes of Annex I countries. Energy use 
per capita shows a similar pattern. Only scenario family A l 
depicts a development in which per capita energy use in 
developing countries could approach that prevailing in 
industrial countries in 1990 (by 2070) and in which it could 
reach parity with industrial countries in the very long-term 
(after 2100). In all other scenarios energy use per capita 
remains below 1990 or future per capita energy use levels of 
industrial countries. By and large, these scenario features 
reflect the very large differences in present per capita levels of 
economic activity and energy use, which require many 
decades, even a century, to narrow. The scenarios thus portray 
a feature Jmown as '"slow conditional convergence only" in the 
development literature (see, e.g.. Shin, 1996). 
Conceming G H G emissions, discussed in more detail in 
Chapter 5, trends reflect the evolution of scenario-driving 
forces discussed above. CO2 emissions of developing countries 
reach levels in industrial countries around or shortiy after the 
year 2000. This reflects the continued growth in energy use 
(and emissions), slow recovery of economies in transition (and 
thus modest growth in aggregate emission from industrial 
countries), and a continuation of current trends in land-use 
changes (deforestation); these only diverge in the medium- to 
long-tenn across the SRES scenarios. 
Yet, 
even with equalizing total emission levels, regional 
differences in cumulative and per capita emissions remain 
pronounced. Based on the estimates of cumulative CO^ (all 
sources) emissions since 1800 given in Grübler and 
Nakicenovic (1994), developing countries reach 1990 levels of 
industrial countries only between 2015 and 2030. They reach 
parity (historical data from 1800 to 1990, and scenario values 
from 1990 onward) at earliest by 2040 (scenario family 
Al), 
and between 2050 (A2 and B l ) and post-2100 (scenario family 
B2) in the other scenarios. None of the SRES scenarios reaches 
the 1990 per capita CO2 emissions levels of industrial countries 
in the developing countries. 
In scenarios with vigorous climate policies (not in the SRES 
terms of reference) per capita emissions levels in industrial 
countries may approach levels as projected for developing 
countries. However, no scenario without climate policies could 
232 
A n O v e r v i e w of S c e n a r i o s 
be found in the literature in which per capita emissions in 
industrialized and developing countries reached similar levels. 
Thus the absence of such convergence in the SRES scenarios 
reflects the current literature, and resuhs from the nature of the 
SRES scenarios as "no climate policy" scenarios. 
SRES scenarios do follow the recommendation to explore 
possible pathways of closing the income gap between the 
industrial and now developing regions (Alcamo et a!., 1995). 
For reasons of plausibility and foundation in the reviewed no-
climate-policy literature, the SRES scenarios do not achieve 
full income convergence in the scenario period analyzed. 
However, income levels in developing countries do reach the 
1990 levels of the industrial countries in the second half of the 
next century in three out of four scenario families. 
4.6. 
A Roadmap to the SRES Scenarios 
In the preceding sections the characteristics of the SRES 
scenarios are summaiized in terms of scenario driving forces 
such as population, economic development, 
resources, 
technology, land-use changes, and other factors. The scenarios 
were designed in such a way as to deliberately span a wide 
range, reflecting uncertainties of the future, but not cover the 
very extremes from the scenario literature conceming driving 
forces. A distinguishing feature of the SRES scenarios is that 
various driving-force variables are not combined numerically 
(or arbitrarily), but instead try to reflect current understanding 
of the i n t e r r e l a t i o n s h i p s between important scenario driving 
forces. For instance, according to the literature review of 
Chapter 3 it would be rather inconsistent to develop scenarios 
of rapid technological change in a macro-economic and social 
context of low labor productivity and stagnant income per 
capita. Scenario s t o r y l i n e s were the method developed within 
SRES to help guide the scenario quantifications and to assure 
scenario consistency in terms of the main relationships 
between scenario driving forces. 
The different quantifications discussed in the previous sections 
demonstrate that even if scenarios share important main input 
assumptions in terms of population and GDP growth. 
Box 4-10: Spatial Distributions of Economic Activities Based on Nighttime Satellite Imagery Data. 
Spatially explicit data on socio-economic activity is sparse. The reason aiises mainly in that Systems of National Accounts and 
similar socio-economic statistics are available only at high levels of spatial aggregations defined by administrative boundaries 
(countries, provinces, or regions). As a result, gridded emission inventories largely rely on estimations of current population 
density distributions (e.g. Olivier et a l . , 1996) and modeling approaches to date have also relied exclusively on rescaling/wíMre 
socio-economic activities (economic output, energy use, etc.) based on current or future population density distribution pattems 
(see e.g., S0rensen and Meibom, 1998; S0rensen et a l . , 1999). Population density is, however, not necessarily a good indicator 
for spatial pattems of socio-economic activities (Sutton et a i , 1997). At higher levels of spatial aggregation, it is estimated that 
about two billion people remain outside the formal economy, most of them in rural areas of developing countries (UNDP, 1997). 
At lower levels of spatial aggregations, locations such as airports, industrial zones, and commercial centers have low resident 
population densities, but high levels of economic activity. Also, with increasing urbanization future population distribution will 
be markedly different from present ones (HABITAT, 1996). 
Night satelUte hnagery from the US Air Force Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Operational Lmescan System 
(OLS) 
offers an interesting altemative based on direct observations. Early nighttune lights data were analyzed from analog film 
strips (Croft, 1978, 1979; Foster, 1983; Sullivan, 1989). Digital DMSP-OLS data have recentiy become available with global 
coverage (Elvidge e t a l . , 1997a, 1997b, 1999). Nocturnal lighting can be regarded as one of the defining features of concentrated 
human activity, such as flaring of nahiral gas m ou fields (Croft, 1973), fishing fleets, or urban settiements (Tobler, 1969; Lo 
and Welch, 1977; Foster, 1983; Gallo et a l . , 1995; Elvidge et a l , 1997c). Consequentiy, extent and brightness of nocturnal 
lighting correlate highly with mdicators of city size and socio-economic activities such as GDP, and energy and electricity use 
(Welch, 1980; Gallo et a i ; 1995; Elvidge et a l . , 1997a). 
Figure 4-13 (bottom panel) shows a 1995/1996 night-luminosity map of the world developed by National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administi-ation's National Geophysical Data Center. The map was derived from composites of cloud-free visible 
band observations made by the DMSP-OLS (see Elvidge et a l . , 1997b; Imhoff et a l . , 1997). The DMSP-OLS is an oscillating 
scan radiometer that generates images with a swath width of 3000 km. The DMSP-OLS is uiüque in its capability to perform 
low-light imaging of the entire earth on a nighfly basis. With 14 orbits per day, the polar orbiting DMSP-OLS is able to generate 
global daytime and nighttime coverage of the Earth every 24 hours. The "visible" bandpass straddles the visible and near-
infrared (VNIR) portion of the spectram. The thermal infrared channel has a bandpass that covers lO^i^ 
jj^g spectrum. 
SateUite altitude is stabilized using four gyroscopes (three-axis stabilization), a starmapper, Earth limb sensor, and a solar 
detector. Image time series analysis is used to distinguish lights produced by cities, towns, and industrial facifities from sensor 
noise and ephemeral lights that arise from frres and lightning. The time series approach is required to ensure that each land area 
is covered with sufficient cloud-free observations to determine the presence or absence of VNIR emission sources.

Dietz et a l . (2000) performed illustrative simulations of possible future light pattems. Considering the high correlation between 
observed radiance-calibrated night satelhte imagery data and economic activity variables like GDP, these simulations mdicate 
future spatial pattems of economic activity. As a basis of the simulation, Dietz et a l . (2000) rescaled present night luminosity 
pattems using global and regional GDP growth pattems of the preliminary A I B marker scenario reported in the SRES open-
process web site combined with a simple stochastic model of spatial evolution and interaction. An illustrative simulation for the 
year 2070 is given in Figure 4-13 (top panel). The resultant changes in spatial light pattems indicate socio-economic activities 
and provide useful information for infrastmcmre planning, such as expansion of gas and electricity networks. When combined 
with topographical information, like latitude, the data can also be used as mput to climate impact and vulnerability assessments 
(e.g., extent of socio-economic activities that may be affected by sea-level rise).

considerable uncertainty and scenario variability remains. For 
instance, features of technological and land-use changes can be 
interpreted quite differently within the framework of different 
models, even if they conform to the overall conceptual 
description and "scenario logic" described in a particular 
scenario family. In some instances the broad outlines of 
scenario driving forces were not followed entirely in particular 
scenario 
quantifications, 
but 
alternative 
scenario 
interpretations were submitted. These highlight important 
scenario uncertainties or express scientific disagreements 
within the writing team, as for future labor productivity growth 
and economic "catch-up" possibilities of currently developing 
countries. These alternative scenario interpretations and 
different model quantifications are presented here to reflect the 
SRES Terms of Reference for an open process and the use of 
multiple modeling approaches, even if this necessarily 
increases complexity and reduces simplicity and transparency 
in discussion of a large number of scenario quantifications. 
To 
guide readers through the different driving-force 
assumptions that characterize the various scenarios. Tables 4-2 
and 4-3 give an overview of the SRES scenario set. They 
classify scenarios that share important input assumptions 
(hannonized scenarios share global population and GDP 
assumptions) 
from 
scenarios 
that 
offer 
alternative 
quantifications. Table 4-4 summarizes the main quantitative 
scenario descriptors for each of the four SRES scenario 
families of the "harmonized" scenario category. Here an 
attempt is made to link this information with the resultant 
scenario outcomes (emissions) that are discussed in more detail 
in Chapter 5. 
In 
Chapter 5, an additional, complementary scenario 
classification scheme to that used in this chapter is presented 
and focuses on driving forces. Scenarios are classified 
according to their cumulative carbon emissions (1990 to 2100, 
all sources), the best single quantitative indicator available to 
compare emission scenarios that portray widely different 
dynamics and different combinations and magnitude of a 
variety of emission categories. Four categories of cumulative 
emissions, Low (<I000 GtC), Medium-Low (1100 to 1450 
GtC), 
Medium-High (1450 to 1800 GtC), and High (>1800 
GtC) 
are presented. Table 4-20 links the scenario overview 
from Tables 4-2 and 4-3 with this information to guide readers 
through the differences in scenarios. 
Table 4-20 indicates that in most cases there is an easily 
discernable direct connection between main scenario 
characteristics of a paiticular scenario family or scenario group 
and the resultant outcomes in terms of cumulative emissions. 
For instance, in the high GDP, high energy demand scenario 
family AI, all scenarios within the two scenaiio groups that are 
fossil fuel and technologies intensive (AIC and A I G combined 
into AlFI in the SPM) result in high cumulative carbon 
emissions. Conversely, cumulative emissions of the "efficiency 
and dematerialization" (without additional climate initiatives) 
scenario family B l are generally in the "low" emissions 
category, but two model quantifications indicate medium-low 
emissions. For the scenario family B2, outcomes in tenns of 
cumulative carbon emissions can also be related clearly to 
scenario characteristics. One group of scenarios (which 
includes the B2 marker) adopts an incrementalist perspective 
of technological change ("dynamics as usual") applied to 
medium levels of population and GDP (and resultant energy 
demand) and results in medium-low cumulative carbon 
emissions. Another group of scenarios explored the sensitivity 
of a gradual retum to coal-based technologies (B2C-MARIA, 
B2-ASF), in one case combined with higher energy demand 
than in the other scenarios (B2High-MiniCAM); and results in 
higher cumulative emissions (Medium-High category in Table 
4-20). 
Equally discernable in Table 4-20 is the wide range in 
cumulative carbon emissions that characterize the various 
scenario groups within the A l scenario family. By design, the 
different scenario groups within this family explored the 
implications of different directions of technological change, 
ranging from carbon-intensive developments (AIC and 
AIG, 
combined into A l F I in the SPM) to decarbonization (AIT), 
with the "balanced" technology development scenario group 
taking an intermediary position. Different developments 
concerning fossil or non-fossil resource and technology 
availability in a less populated but affluent and thus high 
energy demand world (such as A l ) can lead to widely different 
outcomes in terms of cumulative emissions, with a range as 
wide as that spanned by all four scenario families together. 
Technology can thus be as important a driving force as 
population and GDP growth combined. In other words, very 
different emissions outcomes are possible for future worlds 
that otherwise share similar developments of main driving 
forces such as population and economic growth and high rates 
of technological change. 
However, areas of overlap and uncertainties of scenario 
outcomes (cumulative emissions) occur even for scenario 
quantifications that share otherwise similar assumptions for the 
main scenario drivers. Not surprisingly, differences in 
quantifications are largest 
within the A l "balanced" 
technological progress scenario group, which includes the AIB 
marker scenario. Most model interpretaflons result in 
cumulative carbon emissions within the Medium-High 
category (1450-1800 GtC). 
However, there are also scenario 
quantifications in which technological change tilts more in the 
direction of the A I C (AI-ASF) or AIT (Al-MARIA) scenario 
groups that favor fossil (coal) or post-fossil (nuclear, 
renewables, and biomass) technologies, respectively. This 
leads to very wide differences in cumulative emissions, from 
the Medium-Low through to the High categories. A similar 
range of scenario outcomes between Medium-High to High 
categories also characterizes the A2 scenario family that 
otherwise describes an entirely different world (high 
population and comparatively low per capita income compared 
to low population with high per capita income for the A l 
scenario family; see Table 4-4). Departing from the main 
scenario characteristics of the A2 scenario family in terms of 
population and income in direction of lower values (such as in 
2 3 6 
A n O v e r v i e w of S c e n a r i o s 
the A2-A1-MiniCAM scenario) could even yield emissions in 
the Medium-Low category. Thus, the A2 scenario family also 
indicates that a wide range of emissions outcomes is possible 
for 
any given development path of main scenario driving 
forces, such as population and income per capita. 
Finally, the categorization of scenarios in terms of their 
(cumulative carbon) emission outcomes illustrates that similar 
emission 
outcomes 
could 
arise 
from 
very 
different 
developments of main scenario drivers. For instance. High 
category cumulative emissions could arise from scenarios of 
low 
population growth, combined with high incomes (and 
energy use) and globalized technological developments that 
favor accessibility and economics of fossil fuels (coal, 
unconventional oil and gas; e.g., A l C and A I G scenario 
groups). Alternatively, similar High category cumulative 
emissions could also arise from scenarios of high population 
growth combined with slower per capita income growth and 
more regionally oriented technology development trends 
(scenario family A2). A comparison of the B l and A I T 
scenario groups (see Table 4-20) also confirms this conclusion. 
Both scenarios explore pathways that reduce current income 
disparities between regions. They indicate that such a tendency 
does not necessarily lead to high emissions, but could be 
achieved with Low to Medium-Low category cumulative 
emissions (as scenario groups A l C and AIG also indicate that 
High category emission pathways are possible). 
Perhaps the most important conclusion from the S R E S multi-
model, open process, and the large number of scenarios it has 
generated is the recognition that there is no simple, linear 
relationship between scenario driving forces and outcomes or 
between emission outcomes and scenario driving forces. High 
or low population scenarios need not automatically lead to high 
or low emissions; similar statements also hold for economic 
growth and for closing regional income gaps.

Introduction 
In this chapter emission estimates for radiatively important 
gases generated in 40 Special Report on Emission Scenarios 
(SRES) scenarios are present. These gases are carbon dioxide 
(COj), methane (CH^), nitrous oxide (N2O), nitrogen oxides 
(NOj,), carbon monoxide (CO), non-methane volatile organic 
compounds (NMVOCs), sulfur dioxide (SO,), chlorofluoro-
carbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs),^ 
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and 
sulfur hexafluoride (SFg) (see Table 5-1). Emission estimates 
presented here span the interval from 1990 to 2100 at the 
global level and at the level of four SRES macro-regions 
(OECD90, REF, ASIA, and A L M ; see Appendix IV). In 
addition, sulfur emission estimates are presented in the 
regional gridded format to assist in quantifying the effects at 
the local level. Links between emissions and the underlying 
driving forces presented in Chapter 4 are illustrated also. 
As a result of differences in modeling and estimation 
approaches, base-year (1990) emission values in SRES 
scenarios developed using different models show substantial 
variation. To facilitate both use of the scenarios and 
comparisons across scenarios and families, 
base-year 
emissions in all 40 SRES scenarios were standardized using 
one common set of values (see Box 5-1). With a few clearly 
indicated exceptions, only standardized emission values are 
discussed in this chapter. A complete set of standardized 
emissions, along with other quantitative scenario information, 
is provided in Appendix VII. 
The first section in this chapter presents a "roadmap" that 
serves as an orientation to the 40 SRES scenarios. The 
roadmap gives a simple taxonomy that compares input 
parameters, as represented by the four scenario families, and 
emission outputs, as represented by the 1990 to 2100 
cumulative CO^ emissions. The subsequent sections discuss in 
detail emissions of each gas over the next 100 years to 2100.

A classification scheme is presented here to assist the reader in 
understanding the links between driving forces and scenario 
outputs. This scheme can also be used to help select 
appropriate scenarios for further analysis (see Chapter 6). 
The SRES 
scenarios were developed as 
quantitative 
interpretations of the four alternative storylines that represent 
possible futures with different combinations of driving forces. 
These broad scenario families are broken down further into 
seven scenario groups,- used here to classify the input driving 
forces (see also Table 4-20 in Chapter 4). 
' Emission trajectories of these ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) 
are not developed by the SRES team, but adopted from WMO/UNEP 
(1998). 
The scenario outputs of most interest are emissions of GHGs, 
SOj, and other radiatively important gases. However, the 
categorization of scenarios based on emissions of multiple 
gases is quite difficult. All gases that contribute to radiative 
forcing should be considered, but methods of combining gases 
such as the use of global warming potentials (GWP) are 
appropriate only for near-term GHG inventories.-' In addition, 
emission trajectories may display different dynamics, from 
monotonie increases to non-Unear trajectories in which a 
subsequent decline from a maximum occurs. This particularly 
diminishes the significance of a focus on any given year, such 
as 2100. In light of these difficulties, the classification 
approach presented here uses cumulative COj emissions 
between 1990 and 2100. COj is the dominant GHG and 
cumulative CO2 emissions are expected to be roughly 
proportional to CO2 radiative forcing over the time scale 
considered (Houghton et a l . 1996). 
Total cumulative COj emissions from the 40 SRES scenarios 
fall into the range from 773 to 2538 gigatonnes of carbon (GtC) 
with a median of 1509 GtC. To represent this range, the 
scenario classification uses four intervals: 
• 
Less than 1100 GtC (low). 
• 
Between 1100 and 1450 GtC (medium-low). 
• 
Between 1450 and 1800 GtC (medium-high). 
• 
Greater than 1800 GtC (high). 
Each CO2 interval contains multiple scenarios and scenarios 
from more than one family. Each category also includes one of 
the four marker scenarios. Figure 5-1 shows how cumulative 
CO2 emissions from the 40 SRES scenarios fit within the 
selected emission intervals. 
Table 5-2 provides an overview of this scenario classification 
and links the scenario outcomes with factors that drive them, 
organized by family and scenario group (see also Table 4-20). 
The rows in Table 5-2 represent the emission categories, while 
the columns represent the scenario families. The analysis of 
Table 5-2 reveals two key resuhs: 
^ During the approval process of the Summary for Policymakers at the 
5th Session of Working Group III (WGIII) of the IPCC from 8 to 11 
March 2000 in Katmandu, Nepal, h was decided to combine the A l C 
and A I G groups into one "fossil intensive" group A l F I in contrast to 
the non-fossil group AIT, and to select two illustrative scenarios from 
these two A l groups to facilitate use by modelers and policy makers. 
This leads to six scenario gi-oups that constitute the four scenario 
families, three of which are in the A l family. All scenarios are equally 
sound. 
In particular, the IPCC Working Group 1 (WGI) Second Assessment 
Report (SAR) GWPs are calculated for constant concentrations. In 
long-tei-m scenarios, concentrations may change significantly, as do 
GWP values. It is unclear how to apply GWPs to long-tetm scenarios 
in a meaningful manner. In addition, the GWP approach is not 
applicable to gases such as SO^ and ozone precursors.

Box 5-1: Scenario Standardization 
One of the primary reasons for developing emissions scenarios is to enable coordinated studies of climate change, climate 
impacts, and mitigation options and strategies. With the multi-model approach used in the SRES process, 1990 and 2000 
emissions do not agree in scenarios developed usmg different models. In addition, even with agreed reference values, it is time 
consuming and often impractical to fine-tune most mtegrated assessment models to reproduce a particular desned result. 
Nevertheless, differences in the base year and 2000 emissions may lead to confusion among the scenario users. Therefore, the 
1990 and 2000 emission estimates were standardized in all the SRES scenarios, with emissions diverging after the year 2000. 
The procedure for selectmg 1990 and 2000 emission values and the subsequent adjustments to scenario emissions are described 
in this box. 
The standardized scenarios share the same values for emissions in both 1990 and 2000. Emissions for the year 2000 are, of 
course, not yet known and 1990 emissions are also uncertain. The 1990 and 2000 emission estimates for all gases, except SOj, 
were set to be equal to the averages of initial values in the unadjusted four marker scenarios. This was carried out at the four-
region level, and summed to obtahi the standardized global totals. The resultant estimates are within relevant uncertainty ranges 
for each substance, but should not be interpreted as "endorsed" by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to 
represent values for either global or regional emissions. Rather, they are the standardized base-year estimates used for the 
emissions scenarios. 
From 2000 to 2100, emissions in all the scenarios (except CO2 emissions from land-use and SO2 emissions) were adjusted by 
applying a constant offset equal to the difference between the standardized 2000 value and the scenario-speciñc 2000 value. 
The puфose was to smooth scenario trajectories between 2000 and 2010. 
This procedure results in small distortions for those emissions that rise with time, or at least that do not ultimately decrease by 
a large amount as compared to the base year. However, for emissions that fall significantly over time, such as those from 
deforestation or of SOj, this procedure can cause more significant distortions and can even change the sign of the emission 
estimates at later times (i.e., change positive emission estimates into negative ones and vice versa). To avoid these distortions, 
for the aforementioned emissions, the year 2000 offset was reduced by 10% per decade, cumulatively, to make the offset zero 
by the year 2100. This allows preservation of the shape of emission trajectories and still ensures the 2000 standardization. 
The non-standardized scenario values are available from the modeling teams upon request, although the standardized values 
should be used for most purposes. 
• 
Similar future cumulative COj emissions may emerge 
from different sets of driving forces; 
• 
Conversely, similar future states of the world with 
respect to socio-economic development may yield 
different outcomes in terms of cumulative CO^ 
emissions. 
Similar cumulative CO2 emissions can be attained in very 
different social, economic, and technological circumstances. 
H i g h emission levels of the A2 marker scenario (A2-ASF) are 
also attained in all the A l family scenarios with high fossil-fuel 
use (AIC and A I G groups), for example in AIG-MiniCAM. 
M e d i u m - h i g h emissions are attained in most of the A l group 
scenarios (including the A I B marker, AlB-AIM), but also in 
scenarios from the B2 scenario family with high fossil-fuel use 
(e.g., 
B2-ASF). 
M e d i u m - l o w 
emissions, 
which 
are 
characteristic of the B2 family, including the B2 marker (B2-
MESSAGE), are also attained in the A2-A1-MiniCAM 
scenario, which illustrates the transition between the A2 and 
A l families. Finally, l o w emission levels resuh from almost all 
the B l family scenarios (including the ВI marker, Bl-IMAGE) 
as well as from scenarios that belong to the A I T high-
technology scenario group (e.g., AIT-MARIA). In Table 5-2, 
italics are used for examples of scenarios within each emission 
category that illustrate altemative ways to achieve cumulative 
COj emissions similar to those of the marker scenarios. 
5.3. 
Carbon Dioxide 
C O T is the largest contributor to anthropogenic radiative 
forcing of the atmosphere. As described in more detail in 
Chapter 3, the main sources of anthropogenic COj emissions 
are fossil fuel combustion and the net release of carbon from 
changes in teirestrial ecosystems, commonly refen-ed to as 
land-use changes. To a lesser extent, CO^ is emitted by 
industrial activities, in particular by cement production (Table 
5-3).

Figure 5-1: Global cumulative CO, emissions in the 40 SRES scenarios, classified into four scenario families (each denoted by 
a different color code: A l , red; A2, brown; B l , green; B2, blue). Marker scenarios are shown with thick lines without ticks, 
globally harmonized scenarios with thin lines, and non-harmonized scenarios with thin, dotted lines. Black lines show 
percentiles, means, and medians for the 40 SRES scenarios. For numbers on the two additional illustrative scenarios A l F I and 
A I T see Appendix VII. 
energy consumption is driven by population size, level of 
affluence, technological development, environmental concerns, 
and other factors. The composition of energy supply is 
determined by estimated reserves of fossil fuel and the 
availability, relative efficiency, and cost of supply technologies. 
Emissions from gas flaring and industrial emissions are much 
lower in comparison with energy-related emissions; for 
simplification, in this discussion they are added to the latter In 
1990, the global emissions from cement made up about 2.5% 
of the total global COj emissions (Houghton et a l . , 1995). 
Figure 5-2 shows standardized carbon emissions from fossil 
energy and industry for the 40 SRES scenarios. Sample statistics 
(in terms of percentiles, means, and medians) are indicated 
against the background of 40 individual scenarios that make up 
the SRES scenario set. The figure also presents emissions ranges 
spanned by each of the four scenario famiUes in 2100. 
SRES scenarios cover a wide range of annual emissions, and 
the uncertainties in future emission levels increase with time. 
Up to about the 2040s and the 2050s, emissions tend to rise in 
all scenarios, albeit at different rates. Across scenarios this 
reflects changes in the underlying driving forces, such as 
population, economic output, energy demand, and the share of 
fossil fuels in energy supply. By 2050, the emissions range 
covered by the 40 SRES scenarios is from about 9 to 27 GtC,
with the mean and median values equal to about 15 GtC. The 
range between the 25* and 75* percentiles of emissions (the 
"central tendencies") extends from 12 to 18 GtC (i.e. from 
twice to thrice that in 1990). Within this interval lie three of the 
four marker scenarios. However, a fair number of scenarios 
(eight out of 40) also indicate the possibility of much higher 
emissions (in the 18 to 27 GtC range) that reflect an increase 
by a factor of up to 4.5 over 60 years (1990 to 2050). Another 
eight SRES scenarios have 2050 emissions below the 25*
percentile (Figure 5-2). 
Beyond 2050, the uncertainties in energy and industrial COj 
emissions continue to increase. By 2100, the range of 
emissions across the 40 SRES scenarios is between 3 and 37 
GtC, which reflects either a decrease to half the 1990 levels or 
an increase by a factor of six. Emissions between the 25* and 
75* percentiles range from 9 to 24 GtC, while the range of the 
four marker scenarios is even wider, 5 to 29 GtC. The 2100 
median and mean of all 40 scenarios are 15.5 and 17 GtC,
respectively. 
As time passes in the scenarios, uncertainties not only increase 
with respect to absolute levels of COj emissions, but also with

respect to their trajectories. Scenarios portray different 
emission pattems that range from continuous increases up to 
2100, 
through emissions that gradually level off by 2100, to 
trend reversals in which emissions begin to decline in the 
second half of the 2P' century. These dynamic emission 
pattems diminish the significance of emission levels in any 
particular year, such as 2100. 
Over a long time horizon, it also becomes increasingly difficult 
to perceive the future in terms of "central tendencies." For 
instance, between 2050 to 2100, up to eight different scenarios 
from all four SRES scenario families have COj emission levels 
within 10% of the median of all 40 SRES scenarios. Thus, 
there is no single scenario family or individual scenario that 
has "median" emissions with respect to the entire uncertainty 
space described by the 40 SRES scenarios. Similar emission 
levels can arise from very different combinations of driving-
force variables that are embedded in the SRES scenario 
families and groups. 
The wide ranges of energy and industry-related C O ^ emissions 
in the SRES scenarios reflect the fact that the "best" or the 
"most likely" quantifications are nearly impossible to identify. 
The following discussion suggests that even scenarios with 
very similar input parameters (e.g., population and GDP) 
may 
produce a large variation in resultant COj emissions.

Figure 5-2: Standardized global energy-related and industrial COj emissions for 40 SRES scenarios, classified into four 
scenario families (each denoted by a different color code: A l , red; A2, brown; B l , green; B2, blue). Marker scenarios are

dotted lines (see Table 4-3). Black lines show percentiles, means, and medians for the 40 SRES scenarios. For numbers on the 
two additional illustrative scenarios A l F I and A I T see Appendix VII. 
5 3 . 1 . 1 . A l S c e n a r i o F a m i l y 
Rapid economic growth in the A l family scenario leads to high 
energy demand and hence to a steep increase in COj emissions 
in the first decades of the 2P' century. Structural changes in the 
energy supply become effective only in the longer term 
because of the inertia caused by long periods of capital 
turnover. 
With 
respect 
to alternative 
energy 
supply 
technologies, the A l B scenario group assumes a "balanced" 
approach, in which none of these technologies gain an 
overwhelming advantage. This scenario group includes the 
AlB marker scenario developed using the A I M model (Jiang et 
o l ; 2000). In addition to the A I scenario group, variations that 
assumed fast advancements in specific energy supply sectors 
were explored (renewables, AIT; oil and gas, AIG; coal, A l C ) 
(see Chapter 4). 
In the A l B - A I M marker scenario, the global average per capita 
final energy demand grows from 54 GJ in 1990 to 115 GJ in 
2050 and to 247 GJ in 2100. Meanwhile, the final energy 
carbon intensity decUnes relatively slowly until 2050 (from the 
current 21 tC per TJ of final energy to 16 tC per TJ), which 
results in a steep increase in COj emissions in the first decades 
of the 2P' centuiy. After 2050, when structural changes in the 
^"crgy sector take effect, carbon intensity declines rapidly to 
reach 7.5 tC per TJ. This more than offsets growing energy 
demand from a contracting but increasingly prosperous 
population, so that carbon emissions decline between the years 
2050 and 2100. Emissions peak around 2050 at a level 2.7 
times (16 GtC) that of 1990 and fall to around 13 GtC by 2100, 
which is about twice the current level (Figure 5-3a). The total, 
cumulative 1990 to 2100 carbon emissions'* in the A l B - A I M 
scenario equal 1499 GtC (cumulative emissions from energy 
and industry only amount to 1437 GtC). 
Energy-related carbon emissions vary widely across altemative 
A l group scenarios. The smallest differences with respect to 
the A l B marker scenario (AlB-AIM) are in the A l B -
MESSAGE (Roehrl and Riahi, 2000) scenario, which used 
harmonized input assumptions for population, GDP, and final 
energy use at the level of the four regions (see Chapter 4). 
Resultant energy-related carbon emissions in A l B - M E S S A G E 
closely match those of the A l B - A I M scenario, reaching 13.8 
GtC by 2100, which indicates that energy supply technologies 
agree well between the A I M and MESSAGE models. 
Note that unless stated otherwise cumulative emissions reported in 
this chapter always refer to total carbon, while annual emissions in 
this section refer to energy and industry emissions only.

Figure 5-3a: Global 
emissions from fossil fuels and industry in the SRES A l scenario family (standardized). The marker 
scenario is shown with a thick line without ticks, the globally harmonized scenarios with thin lines, and the non-harmonized 
scenaiios with thin, dotted lines (see Table 4-3). In the SPM, A l C and A I G scenarios are merged into one fossil-intensive AlFI 
scenario group (see also footnote 2). 
While still adhering to the "balanced" supply-mix assumption 
(see Section 4.3.1), other scenarios within the A l balanced 
group span a larger range of future emissions around the A l B -
A I M scenario. In part this results from different assumptions 
on global and regional GDP growth and energy-intensity 
improvements, but also from altemative 1п1ефге1а11оп5 of how 
to translate the concept of a "balanced" pathway of 
technological change (as described in the A l scenario 
storyline) into model-specific technology assumpfions. 
The A l B - A S F and AlB-IMAGE scenarios depict futures with a 
stronger reliance on fossil fuels (especially coal) than that m 
A l B - A I M . In 2050 this results in higher emissions (19 to 26 
GtC versus 16 GtC for the A l B - A I M ; see statisfical tables in 
Appendix VII for more details). The emission pattem in the 
AIB-MARIA scenario (Mori, 2000) is quite different. This 
scenario does not reproduce an initial rapid growth in emissions, 
which reach a maximum around 2050 and subsequently decline. 
Instead, emissions grow more slowly and then level off. By 
2050, the emissions in AIB-MARIA are well below those in 
A l B - A I M (13 versus 16 GtC). Two out of three A l scenarios 
developed using the MiniCAM model ( A l V l - M i n i C A M and 
AlV2-MiniCAM) 
were 
based on somewhat 
different 
assumptions with respect to key scenario driving forces, which 
included lower energy intensity, less rapid decline in population 
after 2050, and lower incomes per capita (see Chapter 4 for more 
details). Emissions in these scenarios increase continuously 
during the 2P' century to reach about 18 MtC by 2100 (see 
statistical tables in Appendix VII for more details). 
The emissions range spanned by all the A l balanced scenario 
group in 2100 is from 13 to 18 GtC. Total, cumulative carbon 
emissions range from 1301 to 2073 GtC by 2100. This 
illustrates the importance of different assumptions on rates and 
direction of technological change in the energy sector for long-
term emissions scenarios, which is further explored in the three 
additional scenario groups discussed below. 
Two altemative A l scenario groups, A I G (oil and gas) and 
A l C (coal), explore high-fossil futures and one group, AIT, 
explores advanced technology futures. A I G and A l C have 
been combined into one fossil intensive scenaiio group AlFI m 
the S P M (see also footnote 2). Energy-related carbon 
emissions vary widely across these scenario groups in 
conjunction with the scenario assumptions as to roles of 
different energy sources (Figure 5-3a). The high fossd 
scenarios explore worlds that consume vast amounts of coal, or 
oil and gas, while with the advanced technology assumptions 
the role of fossil fuel declines strongly as nuclear and/or 
renewable sources are favored to supply the reduced fmal 
energy demand. 
The A l fossil scenarios have essentially the same population, 
GDP, and final energy demand as the A l B marker, but have a 
primary eneigy system that relies mainly on fossil fuels. Based 
on cumulative CO2 emissions, scenarios from the A l fossil 
groups (AIG and A l C ) fall within the high emissions category, 
with A l G - M i n i C A M falling roughly in the middle of the range 
spanned by the six A l fossil scenarios (Table 5-2). The primary 
energy system in the A l G - M i n i C A M scenario emerges as a 
result of rapid increases in the efficiency with which fossil 
resources can be recovered, especially in the most expensive 
grades of these resources; unconventional resources play an 
increasingly important role toward the end of the 2P' century.

Figure 5-3b: Global CO^ emissions from fossil fuels and industry in the A2 scenario family (standardized). The marker 
scenario is shown with a thick line without ticks, the globally harmonized scenarios with thin lines, and the non-harmonized 
scenarios with thin, dotted lines (see Table 4-3). 
These rapid teclinical changes, as well as relatively low rates of 
growth in the productivity of biomass and other non-fossil 
sources, imply a world that is heavily reliant on oil and gas. 
The three coal-based scenarios in this group (AIC-MESSAGE, 
AlC-MiniCAM, and AIC-AIM) assume rapid increases in the 
efficiency of synthetic fuel production, as well as relatively 
limited oil and gas resources. 
Three advanced technology or A I T scenarios fall in either the 
"low" or the "medium-low" cumulative emissions categories 
(Table 5-2). The AIT-MARIA scenario (Mori, 2000) achieves 
very low carbon emissions tln'ough the combination of a low 
final energy use (54% of that in A IB-AIM) and a rapid 
increase in the importance of non-fossil energy technologies in 
the primary energy system (81% by 2100). 
The resultant CO2 emissions range of all the A I family 
scenarios is so wide that most of the remaining SRES scenarios 
fall within its bandwidth, h o r n 4.3 to 37 GtC in 2100. The total 
cumulative carbon emissions of the A I family scenarios also 
span a very wide range, from around 1000 GtC to more than 
2500 GtC (Figure 5-1, Table 5-2). 
5 3 . 1 . 2 . A2 S c e n a r i o F a m i l y 
In the A2 scenario family, altemative energy technologies 
develop relatively slowly and fossil fuels maintain their 
dominant position in the energy supply mix. As oil and gas 
resources become scarcer and non-fossil alternatives remain 
underdeveloped, coal gains the leading role. Its share in the 
energy mix ranges from 45% to 52% in the harmonized 
scenarios (A2-ASF, A2-MESSAGE) and in other scenarios 
with similar input assumptions (A2-MiniCAM and A2-AIM). 
Global CO2 emissions in the A2 marker scenario implemented 
using the ASF model (Sankovski et a l , 2000) increase by more 
than fourfold over their 1990 level, to reach 29 GtC by 2100 
(Figure 5.3b). Total cumulative carbon emissions from the A2-
ASF scenario amount to 1860 GtC by 2100. 
In other A2 scenarios, CO2 emissions range from 17 GtC 
(A2G-IMAGE5) 
to 33 GtC (A2-AIM) by 2100. The 
harmonized A2-MESSAGE scenario and the A2-MiniCAM 
scenario have very similar global COj emissions as compared 
to the marker. Slightly higher emissions, primarily caused by 
higher primary energy use, are generated in the A2-AIM 
scenario. Unlike the rest of the A2 family scenarios, the A2G-
IMAGE scenario yields constant emissions after 2050. This 
emission trajectory is explained by the combination of a lower 
energy demand and a larger share of natural gas in the energy 
supply mix (see Chapter 4 for more details). Total cumulative 
carbon emissions in the A2 scenario group range between I7I0 
and 1860 GtC by 2100. 
A variant of the A2 storyline, developed with the MiniCAM 
model (A2-A1-MiniCAM), explores a world in which 
economic growth and population follow a "hybrid" trajectory, 
which have traits of both the A2 and A l storylines. As 
' The IMAGE results for the A2 and B2 scenarios are based on 
preliminary model experiments camed out in March 1998. As a result 
of limited resources it has not been possible to re-run these 
experiments. Hence, unlike for the IMAGE A l and B l scenarios, the 
IMAGE team has not been able to provide background data and 
details for these scenario calculations and the population and 
economic growth assumptions are not harmonized fully.

Figure 5-3c: Global COj emissions from fossil fuels and industry in the B l scenario family (standardized). The marker 
scenario is shown with a thick line without ticks, the globally harmonized scenarios with thin lines, and the non-harmonized 
scenarios with thin, dotted lines (see Table 4-3). 
described in Box 4-6, A2-A1-MiniCAM has a lower 
population than other scenarios of the A2 family, and a slower 
rate of economic growth in the first half of the 2V^ century. 
These in turn limit the growth in final energy demand until 
after the onset of rapid economic growth around 2050. 
Emissions also rise rapidly during the post-2050 period, as the 
large growth in energy consumpfion results mostly from coal, 
oil, and gas. 
Two out of the six A2-family scenarios, A2-ASF and A2-AIM, 
fall into the "high" cumulative CO2 emissions category. Three 
scenarios, A2-MESSAGE, A2-IMAGE, and A2-MiniCAM, 
belong to the "medium-high" category, and only the A2-A1-
MiniCAM scenario with its drastically different assumptions 
about key driving forces falls in the "medium-low" category. 
5 . 3 . 1 . 3 . В1 S c e n a r i o F a m i l y 
The strong trend toward ecologically more compatible 
consumption and production patterns in the B l family is 
reflected by structural changes toward less energy- and 
material-intensive activities, which lead to a partial de­
coupling of welfare and energy demands. In the B l marker 
scenario (Bl-IMAGE; de Vries et a l . , 2000) the rapid 
technological change toward resource saving and ecologically 
sound solutions is assumed to spread very quickly, facilitated 
by high capital stock turnover rates in currentiy less developed 
regions. As a result, energy requirements in B l - I M A G E 
increase slowly and a shift away from fossil fuels eventually 
breaks the already slow upward trend in carbon emissions 
(Figure 5-3c). Emissions peak around 2040 at 12 GtC, twice 
the 1990 level, and by 2100 the emissions fall below the base-
year level to 5 GtC. Total cumulative carbon emissions in the 
B l - I M A G E scenario amount to 983 GtC by 2100. As for A l , 
the population projection adopted for this scenario family 
declines after 2050. 
Rates of energy-intensity improvement in the first half of the 
2P' century range quite widely in ВI family scenarios, and 
lead to emission levels from 8.5 (BIT-MESSAGE) to 17.5 (Bl-
ASF) GtC in 2050. By 2100 the gap in annual emissions 
naiTOws again, with final emissions between 3 and 8 GtC in all 
the B l scenarios (except В1-High-MiniCAM). 
The B l family also includes one scenario in which energy-
related emissions continue to increase throughout the modeling 
period, В1-High-MiniCAM. In this scenario the final energy 
demand is assumed to rise more rapidly witli increasing 
income than in the rest of the B l scenarios. (The total carbon 
emissions in BlHigh-MiniCAM decline slightly later in the 
modeling period because of reduced land under management 
and associated carbon sequestration.) 
Total cumulative carbon emissions in the B l scenario group 
ranges between 770 and 1390 GtC by 2100. A l l but two B l 
scenarios fall in the low cumulative emissions category (Table 
5-2).

In the B2 world, dynamics of technological change continue 
along historical trends ("dynamics as usual"). The exploitation 
of comparative regional advantages in energy resources and 
technologies leads to regionally different mixes of clean fossil 
and non-fossil supply. With the continued growth of population 
and of income per capita, a steady increase of CO^ emissions

Figure 5-3d: Global CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and industry in the B2 scenario family (standardized). The marker 
scenario is shown with a thick line without ticks, the globally harmonized scenarios with thin lines, and the non-harmonized 
scenarios with thin, dotted lines (see Table 4-3). 
emerges in the B2 marker (Riahi and Roehrl, 2000), developed 
using the MESSAGE model (B2-MESSAGE). By 2050 
emissions reach 11 GtC and by 2100 they reach 14 GtC (Figure 
5-3d). Total cumulative COj emissions in the B2 marker 
scenario amount to 1160 GtC by 2100. 
Emissions in the B2 scenarios with harmonized global input 
assumptions (population, GDP, final energy; B2-MESSAGE, 
Б2-А1М, B2-MARIA) are very close in 2100. Differences in 
emissions are largest around 2050, which reflects the different 
patterns of structural change in the energy systems in 
anticipation of depletion of conventional oil and gas. The 
emissions range for non-harmonized scenarios in the B2 
scenario group is larger - between 11.2 (B2-IMAGE'') and 15.4 
(B2-ASF) GtC by 2050. Relatively high emissions in the B2-
ASF scenario are explained by a large share of coal in the fuel 
mix, because of high oil and gas prices. In this scenario, coal is 
also widely used for synthetic liquid and gaseous fuel 
production. In 2100, B2-IMAGE emissions (9 GtC) drop 
below the B2 marker level, while in B2-ASF emissions 
continue to grow and reach 19 GtC by 2100. The B2 high 
scenario variant developed using MiniCAM assumes far less 
efficiency gains, smaller available resources of oil and gas, and 
less favorable development of solar power costs than in the В 2

marker. As in B2-ASF, the near exhaustion of oil supplies in 
B2High-MiniCAM leads to a heavy reliance on synthetic fuels 
to supply the needs of the transportation sector. Emissions in 
this scenario increase to 23 GtC by 2100. An additional 
altemative with more coal use (B2C-MARIA) was explored 
using the M A R I A model. Emissions in this scenario are 
considerably higher than in the original B2-MARIA case, but 
are very close to those of B2-ASF (19 GtC). 
Total cumulative carbon emissions across the B2 scenario 
group range between 1164 and 1686 GtC by 2100. Three of the 
eight B2 family scenarios fall into the "medium-high" 
cumulative emissions category, and the five others fall into the 
"medium-low" category (Table 5-2). 
5.3.1.5. 
I n t e r - f a m i l y 
C o m p a r i s o n 
Table 5-2 suggests fairly strong contrasts in the level of 
cumulative emissions across the four scenario families (note 
that estimates in Table 5-2 also include emissions from land 
use). A variety of available energy supply and demand options 
means that cumulative emissions in the A l family span the 
entire set of emission categories. The A2 family scenarios, 
characterized by a large population and a relatively carbon-
intensive energy system, fall into either the "high" scenario 
category or in the upper part of the "medium-high" category. 
Only the A2-A1-MiniCAM scenario falls in the "medium-low" 
category, because of low cumulative emissions prior to 2050. 
As a consequence of the low energy consumption and non-
fossil energy systems associated 
with its sustainable 
development theme, the В1 family scenarios are concentrated in 
the "low" 
emissions category. Finally, representatives of the B2 
family are present in the two middle categories. 
252 
E m i s s i o n S c e n a r i o s 
In addition to their cumulative emissions, the scenario families 
are characterized by very different emissions trajectories. The 
AI 
fossil fuel scenarios have continuously increasing 
emissions, with rapid growth before 2050 and slower growth 
thereafter. The A I scenarios with the "balanced" energy mix 
(e.g. the marker AlB-AIM) typically have emissions that 
decline after 2050, while the A I T technology scenarios have 
slower growth prior to 2050, and a steeper decline after 2050. 
As for the A l fossil fuel scenarios, A2 family scenarios are 
characterized by high rates of growth in emissions prior to 2050 
and subsequently continued growth but at lower rates. Unlike 
the rest of the A2 scenarios, the A2-AI-MiniCAM has more 
rapid growth in emissions after 2050 than before 2050, because 
per capita incomes in a number of developing regions do not 
reach a level at which per capita energy demands rise rapidly 
until the middle of the 2 Г ' century. The B l family is 
characterized by lower growth in emissions prior to 2050, 
mostly because of lower rates of growth in energy demand, 
followed by declining emissions after 2050. Finally, the B2 
family is characterized by relatively stable emissions post-2050, 
after roughly doubling emissions between 1990 and 2050. 
5.3.2. 
Land-Use 
C a r b o n D i o x i d e 
Emissions 
Most changes in land use are induced by the demand for 
cropland and grassland, which is driven by the demand for 
food products, the extent of biomass energy use, and policies 
and practices associated with forest management. The 1990 
land-use COj emissions remain fairly uncertain, estimated at 
1.6 ± 1.0 GtC (Watson et a!., 1996a); a similar level of 
uncertainty is attached to current land-use emissions. This 
uncertainty is reflected by the quantification of the SRES 
storylines - the 1990 emission estimates from different models 
range between 1.0 and 1.6 GtC, while the spread of estimates 
at the four-region level is even larger. For the sake of 
comparabifity, common, standardized (see Box 5-1 on 
standardization) emissions are established at 1.1 GtC in 1990 
and 1.0 GtC in 2000, to reflect the net carbon flux from 
contemporary changes in forest cover. 
Generally, the SRES models use different approaches to 
estimate land-use change emissions - in some cases the only 
source of emissions is tropical deforestation, while in other 
cases more sources and sinks (including natural) are included.'' 
Moreover, méthodologie differences and uncertainties in 
carbon content, carbon cycling, and land classification result in 
seemingly inconsistent results between models that cover the 
same land-use 
sources. These features complicate a 
straightforward comparison between land-use emissions in 
scenarios generated by different SRES models. 
' The most comprehensive treatment is embedded in the IMAGE 
model. For the sake of comparison the IMAGE team has made a 
tentative estimate of those (net) emissions that are reasonably 
consistent with what other models reported. These derived values are 
used in this report. 
Future trajectories of land-use COj emissions are shown in 
Figure 5-4. Emissions in the 40 SRES scenarios range widely 
in the same year and change significantly over time. In 
scenarios with continued deforestation, emissions rise initially, 
then reach a maximum, and finally decline with depletion of 
forestland that can be cleared. At the other end of the scenario 
spectrum, emissions turn negative and land-use changes 
become an increasing CO2 sink through afforestation. By 2020, 
the resultant uncertainty ranges between 0 and 3 GtC across all 
40 SRES scenarios with a median of I.l GtC. By 2050, the 
s c e n a r i o r a n g e shifts to between -0.7 and 1.2 GtC (median, 0.5 
GtC). By 2100 the scenario range lies between -2.8 and 2.2 
GtC, with a median of 0.0 GtC. Interestingly, in specific years 
(e.g., in 2050) scenarios from аИ four SRES families fall within 
a relatively narrow emissions corridor (i.e. at least one scenario 
from each of the four SRES scenario families falls within the 
25"' and 75* percentiles of the emission range). This indicates 
that similar levels of carbon fluxes related to land use could 
arise from widely different socio-economic driving forces, 
depending on future trends in food demand and dietary 
pattems, agricultural productivity growth, forest practices, etc. 
In general, the SRES COj land-use emissions follow the same 
pattern as found in the literature (see Chapter 3) - initially 
emissions increase because of continuing deforestation in 
developing regions and subsequentiy they decrease following a 
drop in population growth and increases in agricultural 
productivity. The main difference between the SRES scenarios 
and the literature reviewed in Chapter 3 lies in the maximum 
emission values, which are significantly lower in the SRES 
scenarios. Possibly this arises because the SRES models 
explicitly simulate land-use change as a function of pressure on 
the land (itself a function of agricultural productivity), while in 
the literature land-use СО, emission scenarios are often based 
on trend extrapolation or statistical relationships (e.g. with 
population growth). The rapid economic development and 
technological advances assumed in the SRES storylines thus 
tend to mitigate CO, emissions from deforestation, and in 
some cases lead to their reversal (e.g., tuming deforested lands 
into carbon sinks). 
As suggested by Figure 5-4, no simple relation exists between 
the scenario families and land-use emissions. As in the case of 
energy-related emissions, the A I family scenarios cover the 
widest range of emissions and trajectories. In most cases, 
emissions in these scenarios decline after 2030 to zero or 
negative (carbon sinks) values. However, in two scenarios 
(AIB-IMAGE and A l B - M A R l A ) , emissions increase later in 
the 2P' century, reflecting assumptions on additional land 
pressures. As a rale, scenarios of the A2 family follow the same 
convex trajectory as A I scenarios, also with two exceptions 
(A2-IMAGE 
and 
A2-AIM). 
In accordance 
with 
the 
sustainability emphasis of the ВI family storyline, scenarios 
from this family have the lowest initial emissions, which by 
2080 or earlier drop to zero or negative levels. The В1 family 
marker scenario (BI-IMAGE) has negative land-use emissions 
for most of the modeling period, a property directiy related to 
Bl's "envhonmental conservation" emphasis.

As a result of different model specifications and detail, it is not 
possible to draw up consistent comparisons between sectoral 
emissions across different models. An overview of sectoral

Box 5-2 on the basis of the results of the MESSAGE (for 
energy and industrial sources) and A I M (for land-use change 
sources) models. 
5.4. 
Other Greenhouse Gases 
Non-CO^ GHGs (CH^, N2O, and halocarbons) account for 
about 40% of the total induced additional radiative forcing 
compared to pre-industrial times (Houghton et a l . , 1996). 
Whereas COj emissions are largely attributable to two major 
sources (energy and land use), other gases arise from many 
different sectors and applications as shown in Table 5-3. 
Consequently, their emission levels are more uncertain. Also 
Box 5-2: CO2 Emissions by Sector and Source for MESSAGE Scenarios 
Table 5-4 gives an overview of COj emissions by sector and source category according to the IPCC reporting format given in 
Watson et al. (1996b). The dilïerences m sectoral detail across models mean a consistent comparison and sectoral COj emission 
balances are only possible withm one particular modeUng framework. Table 5-4 presents the scenario results as calculated with 
the MESSAGE model for 1990, 2050, and 2100 and for the four scenario famiUes and their scenario groups. Emissions related 
to land-use change were derived from consistent model runs with the A I M model. 
As in Watson et al. (1996b), emissions are presented by sector, and emission categories adopt both supply and demand 
perspectives for energy-related COj emissions. The supply side COj balance accounts emissions at the pomt of energy 
combustion, that is at a coal-fu:ed power plant (electric generation) or by buming coal in industrial boilers (direct fuel use by 
industry). Conversely, the demand side COj balance accounts emissions per end-use category, irrespective of whether emissions 
originate directiy at the pomt of end-use or upstream in the energy conversion sector. For example, for residential and 
commercial energy uses, COj emissions mclude those from direct fuel combustion as well as those emissions that originate from 
the generation of electiicity consumed by the residential and commercial sectors. Finally, an emissions balance by source 
category is given, m which emissions are accounted for at the level of prunary energy (solids, liquids, and gases), again after 
Watson et al. (1996b). Non-energy emissions are included in a separate "others" category. Combined, these different emission 
balances can serve as data input for subsequent mitigation analyses at the sectoral level or at that of the entire economy.

the base-year emissions of ПОП-СО2 GHGs are subject to 
considerable uncertainty, in particular when it comes to 
regional and sectoral breakdowns. 
Emissions of ПОП-СО2 radiatively important gases are subject 
to considerable and unresolved uncertainties and are driven by 
a more complex set of forces than CO, emissions. Therefore, 
the types of models employed for the SRES analyses are not 
expected to produce unambiguous and widely approved 
estimates of emissions of these gases for a period of over a 
century. Despite the limited knowledge, at some point in time 
causal relationships between driving forces and non-COj 
emissions need to be crafted mto the models for the sake of 
completeness. Even if new insights are generated by specialist 
researchers m certain fields of environmental science, and 
these become accepted as the mainstream view, their adoption 
in the models is often far from straightforward, as appropriate 
links to drivers may not be readily available in the underlying 
structure. Limited manpower and resources imply that 
priorities must be assigned when deciding on further model 
development, and as a consequence the models lag behind 
"common wisdom" in certain areas. Of course, this does not 
necessarily limit their abilities to capture major trends at a 
more aggregate level, the mam purpose of these models. 
In the following sections emission trajectories generated in the 
SRES scenarios are presented and discussed. However, model 
structures and properties, and exogenous assumptions made by 
the modelers involved, may give rise to systematic deviations 
within scenario families that may prove very significant 
compared to average inter-family differences. 
Further 
investigation and analysis is required to understand these issues 
more fully.

In the IPCC WGI SAR, anthropogenic CH^ emissions in the 
year 1990 were estimated at 375 ± 75 MtCH^ (Houghton et a l . , 
1996) and are shown in Table 5-3. These emissions arise from 
a variety of activities, dominated by biogenic processes that are 
often subject to considerable uncertainties (see Chapter 3). 
CH4 emissions across the six models used to generate the 
SRES scenarios for 1990 range between 298 and 337 MtCH^. 
After standardization (see Box 5-1), the base-year emissions in 
the SRES scenarios were set to 310 MtCH4, within the range 
mentioned above. About one-quarter of the total emissions are 
related to fossil fuel extraction (CH^ emissions from coal 
mines, CH4 venting from oil extracrion), transport and 
distribution (e.g., leakage from pipelines), and consumption 
(incomplete combustion). The biogenic sources include 
agricuUure (enteric fermentation, rice paddies, and animal 
waste), biomass buming, and waste management (landfills, 
sewage). Based on this source list, future CH^ emission 
trajectories depend upon such variables as volumes of fossil 
fuels used in the scenarios, regional demographic and affluence 
developments, and assumptions on preferred diets and 
agricultural practices. 
Results from the 40 SRES scenarios indicate that uncertainties 
surrounding future CH^ emission levels are likely to increase 
over time (Figure 5-5). By 2050 the range across all scenarios

is between 359 and 671 MtCH^, and the range increases further 
to levels between 236 and 1069 MtCH^ by 2100. This wide 
range in the SRES emissions reflects new information and 
additional uncertainties conceming certain source categories 
such as sewage systems. As for COj emissions related to land 
use (see Section 5.3.2), at least one scenario from all four 
SRES scenario families falls within the 25* and 75* 
percentiles of the emission range. Thus, very different future 
developments in energy and agricultural systems could lead to 
similar outcomes in terms of global CH^ emissions, even if the 
source categories and regional pattems of these emissions are 
very different. At the same time, the uncertainty range for any 
given scenario family is also substantial, as indicated by the 
range of 2100 emissions for the A l , A2, and B l scenario 
families in Figure 5-5. 
The subsequent sections discuss CH^ emission trajectories for 
individual scenario families, with sectoral and regional patterns 
described on the basis of the output of marker scenarios.

MiniCam scenario shows them after 2050 (Figure 5-6a). In 
three A l fossil scenarios (AlG-MiniCAM, A l C - M i n i C A M , 
and AlC-MESSAGE) and in both alternative M i n i C A M 
scenarios ( A l V l - M i n i C A M and AIV2-MiniCAM) emissions 
increase continuously through the 2U' century, while in the rest 
of the A l scenarios emissions peak between 2030 and 2050 
and decline thereafter. 
In the A l B marker scenario (AlB-AIM) emissions increase 
through 2030 and subsequently decline to levels similar to 
those in 1990 (Figure 5-6a). Almost all of the emissions 
dynamics in A l B - A I M are explained by a rise in emissions 
from landfills, sewage, and fossil fuel production. At the same 
time emissions from agriculture are relatively flat because 
better management of animal wastes and high productivity are 
assumed to offset the effect of increased food requirements 
(Table 5-5). Growing population and per capita income 
combined with increased use of landfills generates increasing 
emissions from landfills and sewage in developing countries 
through 2030. After 2030, declining population levels, the 
introduction of modem management techniques, and increased 
recycling reduces waste sent to landfills and thus emissions 
from these wastes. Emissions from biomass buming in A l B -
AIM are assumed to decline steadily through the adoption of 
bio-recycling and other "no-waste" agricultural practices. 
Similarly, CH^ emissions from fossil fuel production and use 
grow thi'ough 2030 and subsequently decline as fossil fuel 
production falls. 
5.4.1.2. 
A2 S c e n a r i o F a m i l y 
The A2 family of scenarios contributes the upper half of the 
full range of CH^ emissions in the SRES scenarios (Figure 5-
5). The global CH^ emissions in the A2 family scenarios grow 
continuously thioughout the 2P' century and range from 550 to 
1070 MtCH4 in 2100 (Figure 5-6b). The rate of growth 
depends on the scenario-specific dynamics of major CH^ 
emission drivers. Emissions in the A2-ASF scenario, which are 
close to the upper end of the range, are driven mainly by 
increases in coal production, livestock population, and waste 
management capacity to satisfy the needs of an expanding 
population (Table 5-5). At the lower end of the emission range 
are the two MiniCAM scenarios and A2-AIM. Relatively slow 
emission growth in the MiniCAM scenarios is attributed 
primarily to an increase in rice productivity (which offsets an 
increase in the area of rice fields) and a shift in livestock 
production from cattie to animal groups that have notably 
lower emission factors per animal (e.g. poultry and swine). In 
the A2-AIM scenario low CH^ emissions are caused by 
relatively low CH^ emission factors for coal production and a 
relatively slow increase in livestock production. 
5 . 4 . 1 . 3 . B l S c e n a r i o F a m i l y 
The В1 family of scenarios covers the lower half of the full 
range of CH4 emissions in the SRES scenarios, with the B l -
IMAGE marker scenario positioned at the low end of this range 
(Figure 5-5). Global emissions in B l - I M A G E grow through to 
2030, driven primarily by increased emissions from landfills 
and sewage (Figure 5-6c). This growth is partially offset by 
declines in emissions from biomass burning (Table 5-5). After 
2030, emissions level off and subsequently decline from 2050, 
a reflection of reductions in fossil fuel production and use. 
Emissions from other sources, which include enteric 
femientation and rice production, also decline, primarily from 
the combination of stabilizing and declining populations with 
continued improvements in slaughter weight and off-take rate. 
The В I-AIM scenario lies in the middle of the range for the B l 
family. C H 4 emissions in this scenario increase through to 
2050, with most of the increase associated with landfills and 
sewage systems. After 2050, emissions from landfills decline 
because of a combination of factors that include recycling and 
a declining population. Emissions from sewage decrease after 
2050 through the decline in population. Emissions from rice 
production stay relatively flat because of increases in rice 
productivity. Emissions from fossil fuel production increase 
through to 2030 and subsequentiy decline, which mirrors the 
increase in production of fossil fuels through to 2030 and the 
increased use of renewable energy after 2030. Unlike other В1 
scenarios, both 
M i n i C A M cases have emissions that 
continuously increase (Figure 5-6c). The reason is a slow rise 
in non-energy system emissions for the В1-MiniCAM 
scenario, which offsets the decrease in energy system 
emissions and the nearly constant emissions in the agriculture 
sector. In the BlHigh-MiniCAM scenario, the additional 
energy demand designed into this scenario is met largely by an 
increased use of natural gas, which thus explains the faster rise 
in CH^ emissions in this scenario as compared to the base B l 
MiniCAM scenario.

C H 4 emission trajectories of the В 2 family of scenarios are 
located in the middle of the SRES range and (except for the 
B2-AIM scenario) follow very similar paths (Figure 5-6d). 
Similar emission profiles in B2 scenarios may have different 
explanations. The increase in emissions from 1990 to 2100 in 
the B2-MESSAGE scenario is predominantiy from landfills 
and sewage, with fossil-fuel energy production as the second 
major source. However, in the B2-ASF scenario increasing 
volumes of CH^ are generated mostiy in the energy and 
agricultural sectors. Unlike the rest of the B2 family, the B2-
AIM scenario emissions after 2070 decline because of an 
increase in the CH^ recovery rate from energy and waste 
management systems.

Global CH4 emissions in all the four markers increase at about 
the same rate up to 2020 (Figure 5-5). After the early and rapid 
increase in agricultural productivity and a shift away from 
fossil fuels, emissions in the B l marker (Bl-IMAGE) level off 
and subsequently decline. Emissions in the other three markers 
continue to increase. Emissions in the A l B marker (AlB-AIM) 
grow to 2030 because of an increasing and much more affluent 
population in developing regions. The emissions subsequently 
decline until 2100 as the population growth slows and 
eventually reverses. Increases in efficiency and productivity, 
through rapid technological change, offset increases in 
consumption (AI global GDP is the largest among the SRES 
storylines), so that by 2100 global emissions per person are 
lower than in 1990 even though average incomes grow very 
2 6 0 
E m i s s i o n Scénarios 
significantly (Table 5-5). In the A2 (A2-ASF) and B2 (B2-
MESSAGE) markers, emissions increase throughout the whole 
time horizon to the year 2100. This increase is most 
pronounced in the A2 marker scenario, in which emissions 
reach about 900 MtCH^ by 2100 (about a three-fold increase of 
1990 levels). The emission level by 2100 for the B2 marker, 
600 MtCH^, is about twice as high as in 1990. 
The four SRES marker scenarios illustrate a complexity of 
relative impacts of technology, GDP, and population on CH^ 
emissions. In 2050 and 2100 the A2 and B2 markers have very 
similar per capita emissions, which indicates a certain 
similarity between the cumulative impact of economic, 
technological, and structural changes on emissions in both of 
these scenarios (in spite of significant differences in the global 
average per capita incomes). Hence, differences in the absolute 
emission levels in these scenarios can be explained primarily 
by differences in population trajectories, with the A2 
population in 2100 being 1.5 times larger than the B2 
population. At the same time, differences in the absolute 
emissions between the A l B and B l markers cannot be 
explained by population size (both markers have the same 
population trajectory), but instead result from the greater 
emphasis on "dematerialization" and "sustainability" in the В1 
storyline. The two illustrative scenarios A l G - M i n i C A M and 
AIT-MESSAGE display similar pattems of methane emissions 
as the A2 and B l marker scenarios respectively and are 
therefore not discussed separately here. 
At the sectoral level, CH^ emissions in the A l B marker 
originate primarily from landfills and sewage followed by 
fossil fuel production and agricultural animals (Table 5-5). 
Agricultural animals are the major source of emissions in the 
A2 marker, with fossil fuels being second, and landfills and 
sewage third in importance. In the B l marker, fossil fuels 
produce the largest volumes of CH^, followed by agricultural 
sources (Table 5-5). Finally, the B2 marker emissions originate 
primarily from landfills and sewage, followed by fossil fuels 
5.4.2. 
N i t r o u s 
Oxide 
Uncertainties in the estimates of current N , 0 emissions (Table 
5-3) are also reflected in base-year 1990 differences, between 
4.8 and 6.9 MtN across the six models used to develop the 
SRES scenarios. The range across the four markers (Table 5-3) 
is not as wide, between 6.0 and 6.9 MtN, and leans more toward 
the higher end of the uncertainty range reported in Houghton et 
a l . (1995). After standardization, 1990 N^O emissions in the 
SRES scenarios were set to 6.7 MtN, well within the IPCC 
WGI SAR range (Table 5-3). Even more so than for CH^, food 
supply is assumed to be a key determinant of future N2O 
emissions. Size, age structure, and regional spread of the global 
population are likely to affect future emission trajectories, 
together with diets and rates of improvement in agricultural 
productivity. The representation of how these driving forces 
translate into NjO emissions varies across the models because 
of differences in both sectoral coverage and emission factors. 
As a result, differences in emission trajectories are not only 
scenario dependent, but also model dependent, which illustrates 
additional uncertainties in our understanding and representation 
of driving forces and their influence on N2O emissions.

The range of emissions across all 40 SRES scenarios increases 
continuously over the 2P' century (Figure 5-7). By 2100, Щ0 
emissions range between 5 and 20 MtN. Emission ranges also 
tend to be comparable across the four scenario storylines, an 
indication of the decisive impact of uncertainty in the modeling 
(mentioned above). Future N2O emissions in the SRES 
scenarios tend to cluster into two broad groups - those that 
project relatively flat, even slightly declining, emissions and 
those that indicate continuously rising trends toward high 
emission levels. Some other scenarios (e.g. AlB-ASF, Bl-ASF, 
and Bl-IMAGE) indicate the possibility of transitional 
emission pattems in which N2O emissions peak around 2050 
and decline thereafter, more or less in step with the population 
size. As a result of differences in modeling approaches, no 
individual scenario tracks the mean or median across all 40 
scenarios of the SRES set. 
5 . 4 . 2 . 1 . A l S c e n a r i o F a m i l y 
The A l family of scenarios covers close to the full range of 
N , 0 emissions from the SRES scenarios (Figure 5-7). The 
A l G - M i n i C A M scenario is at the high end of the A l range 
(Figure 5-8a). Most of the emissions increase in this scenario 
is associated with the agriculture sector, primarily with animal 
manure management. Emissions are driven by a rapid increase 
in income that induces steep increases in meat and dairy 
consumption. The A l B - A I M marker scenario has emissions 
near the low end of the range. This scenario assumes that 
fertilizer use in developing countries is nearly saturated and 
that increased productivity comes from better management. A 
portion of nitrogen from fertitizers is also assumed to be stored 
indefinitely in underground water. However, the emissions 
from energy use in A l B - A I M increase until the third quarter of 
the 2V century, and reach a level about three times the 1990 
volume. In the middle of the A l family range lie emissions 
from the A l B - A S F and A l B - I M A G E scenarios (Figure 5-8a). 
In these scenarios, emissions growth to the 2050s is driven by 
growth in the agricultural and transportation 
sectors. 
Thereafter, emissions decline, primarily because of declining 
population levels and increases in agricultural productivity 
(lower production factor input per unit of output). 
As suggested by Figure 5-8a, differences in the energy supply 
system reflected by the four A l scenario groups (AIG, A l C , 
AIT, and A l or "balance") are only partially translated into 
differences in N^O emissions. For example, scenarios that rely 
on coal as the primary energy source span the range from 6 
MtN (AlC-MESSAGE) to 16 MtN (AlC-MiniCAM). At the 
same time, trajectories of A I T "technology" scenarios are 
located in the lower end of the emissions range. 
5.4.2.2. 
A2 S c e n a r i o F a m i l y 
N , 0 emission trajectories of the A2 scenario family fall into 
two major groups. The first group includes the A2-AIM and 
A2-MESSAGE scenarios, and the rest of scenarios fomi the 
second group. The A2-AIM NjO emissions increase at a 
relatively low rate and do not exceed 10 MtN in 2100 (Figure 
5-8b), because of a relatively slow increase in nitrogen 
fertilizer input and omission of N , 0 sources associated with 
animal wastes. N2O emissions in the second group of scenarios 
(which includes the family marker A2-ASF) grow steadily 
throughout the 2U' century, driven by an increased demand for 
food and associated increases in the animal waste and nitrogen 
fertilizer use (Table 5-6). In 2100 the emissions from this group 
of scenarios range from 15 to 20 MtN.

Table 4-3).

The spread of 
emissions in the В1 family is quite large. 
The high-end reflects the agricultural assumptions used in the 
MiniCAM model, in which continued growth in meat 
production is driven by increases in per capita consumption 
that more than offset the reduction in population size (Figure 5-
8c). The B l - A I M scenario has emissions near the low end of 
the range, because fertilizer use in developing countries is 
assumed to level off and better management 
increases 
productivity. Emissions from animal waste, mobile sources, 
and other sources in B l - A I M are nearly constant. The B l -
IMAGE scenario (Bl family marker) has slowly increasing 
emissions through to 2050, which predominately originate 
from increases in livestock and the use of synthetic fertilizer 
(Table 5-6). After 2050, these emissions decline as the 
population size and associated demand for animal products 
declines (Figure 5-8c). The B l - A S F 
scenario has an 
intermediate emission trajectory with a maximum of 11.5 MtN 
in 2050 and a subsequent decline to 9.3 MtN by 2100 (Figure 
5-8c). The two illustrative scenarios A l G - M i n i C A M and AIT­
MESSAGE display similar patterns of methane emissions as 
the A2 and В1 marker scenarios, respectively, and are therefore 
not discussed separately here. 
5.4.2.4. B2 S c e n a r i o F a m i l y 
The B2 family of scenarios covers a large range of N2O 
emissions, similar to that found for the A l family (see Figure 
5-7). In the B2-MESSAGE scenario (B2 family marker), which 
has the lowest emissions in the family, improvements in 
agricultural productivity exceed increases in the demand for 
agricultural products and signiñcantly slow emission growth in 
the sector (Table 5-6). Slow growth in agriculture and energy-
related emissions and declines of emissions from other sectors 
result in a relatively flat emissions proñle (Figure 5-8d). 
Emissions in the B2-ASF scenario are between the middle of 
the family range and its high end. The continuous increase in 
emissions in the B2-ASF scenario (which lie between the 
middle and high end of the family range) occurs through 
growth in nitrogen fertilizer use, in animal wastes, and in 
mobile sources. It is driven by increases in population and, to 
a smaller extent, by per capita increases in consumption of 
meat and dairy products. 
5.4.2.5. 
I n t e r - F a m i l y C o m p a r i s o n 
The allocation of N2O emissions into source categories for the 
SRES marker scenarios is shown in Table 5-6. Separate 
emissions estimates for fertilized soils and manure were not 
available for all scenarios. As the emissions in Table 5-6 have 
not been standardized (see Box 5-1), base-year 1990 (and 
2000) emissions are not the same for the different scenarios. In 
general, base-year emissions are likely to have greater 
differences at finer levels of detail. These differences result 
from 
different 
model 
calibrations, 
different 
model 
methodologies, and different classification schemes. 
Emissions from fertilized soils and manure from agricultural 
animals dominate N2O emissions in all the SRES markers. The 
fraction of total emissions from these two sources increases to 
about 80% in the A2, B l , and B2 marker scenarios, while the 
agricultural fraction remains roughly the same over the 2P' 
century in the A l B marker. As discussed in Section 5.4.2, the 
range of future emissions is similar across each scenario family 
when all storyline inteфretations are considered. Therefore,

Figure 5-8d: Standardized global 
emissions in the B2 family scenarios. The marker scenario is shown with a thick line 
without ticks, the globally harmonized scenarios with thin lines, and the non-harmonized scenarios with thin, dotted lines (see 
Table 4-3). 
while it is useful to discuss emissions from the marker 
scenarios individually, clearly differences in modeling 
approaches and model assumptions have a particularly strong 
effect on future 
emissions. 
Agricultural emissions in the A l B - A I M marker scenario 
decrease over the 21'^' century, with increased productivity 
offsetting additional food demand. Agricultural emissions in 
the A2-ASF marker scenario increase substantially because of 
the food demands of a large population, coupled with less 
technological change. Emissions in the B l - I M A G E marker 
scenario increase and subsequently fall. In the B2-MESSAGE 
marker, agricultural emissions of N-,0 increase steadily 
throughout most of the 2P' century, with a decrease between 
2000 and 2010. These patterns differ because of the different 
driving forces (population and demand), model assumptions, 
and modehng approaches. 
Emissions from the categories "Industry/Fossil Fuels" and 
"Other" show a monotonie rise in the A2-ASF marker, while 
emissions in the B l - I M A G E marker rise and subsequently fall. 
Industry and fossil fuel emissions fall and then increase 
slightly in the B2-MESSAGE marker scenario, while "Other" 
emissions, which largely arise from land-use changes, fall. 
Industry and fossil fuel emissions in the A l B - A I M marker 
scenario increase through the 21" century, but are countered by 
a decrease in emissions from the "Other" category. 
The combined dynamics of NjO emissions in the A l , В1, and 
B2 markers leads to nearly stable or declining emissions 
during most of the 2P' century (Figure 5-7). The B2 marker 
shows the lowest emission level (from the year 2010 to 2080), 
despite a larger population than in A I and B l . One possible 
reason is inter-model differences in treatment of land-use 
changes. Unlike the other markers, the A2-ASF scenario 
yields a continuous growth in emissions, which corresponds to 
its assumptions of high population and slow technological 
change. 
5.4.3. 
Halocarbons 
and Other 
Halogenated 
Compounds 
Emissions of halocarbons (CFCs, HCFCs, halons, PFCs, and 
HFCs) and other halogenated compounds (SFg) on a substance-
by-substance basis are described in detail in Fenhann (2000). A 
list of the substances covered, together with their GWPs and 
lifetimes (as in IPCC SAR; Houghton, et a l . 1996), is given in 
Table 5-7. 
Importantly, future emissions of halocarbons and other 
halogenated compounds strongly depend on the technologies 
involved in their production and use. New uses for these 
substances may arise or new products or technologies may 
replace current uses. It is assumed here that the current mix of 
products continues to exist for the next 100 years to 2100, with 
some generic technological improvements as described below. 
This assumption, however, means that emissions projections 
for industrial gases discussed in this section carry a substantial 
uncertainty. 
Halocarbons are carbon compounds that contain fluorine, 
chlorine, bromine, and iodine. Halocarbons that contain 
chlorine (CFCs and HCFCs) and bromine (halons) cause ozone 
depletion, and their emissions are controlled under the 
Montreal Protocol and its Adjustment and Amendments.

amendments, consumption (the balance of production plus 
imports minus exports) of CFCs is largely banned in developed 
countries after January 1996 (and developing countries after 
2010), although some countries have failed to meet the 
deadline. Furthermore, HCFC consumption will be subjected 
to a gradual phase-out, with cuts from the 1986 base-year 
values of 35%, 65%, and 90% in 2004, 2010, and 2015, 
respectively. Final HCFC consumption phase-out will occur in 
2020 (2040 for developing countries). 
The six modeling teams participating in the SRES process did 
not develop their own projections for emissions of ODS and 
their subsritutes. Hence, a different approach for the 
development of long-range estimates for halocarbons and other 
halogenated compounds was adopted. First, for ODSs the 
external Montreal Protocol A3 maximum production scenario 
was used as a direct input to all SRES scenarios (WMO/UNEP, 
1998), since most measures in this A3 scenario have been 
implemented already or are well established and under way 
(and so no large scenario variation is expected). For other gas 
species, a simple methodology to develop different emission 
trajectories consistent with aggregate SRES scenario driving-
force assumptions (population, GDP, etc.) was developed. 
Also, the assumed future control rates have been adopted to 
conform to the SRES storylines presented in Chapter 4. The 
underlying literature, scenario methodology, and data are 
documented in more detail in Fenhann (2000) and are 
summarized in this section. 
The resultant emissions of Montreal gases, HFCs, PFCs, and 
SFg are summarized in Table 5-8. The effect on climate of each 
of the substances listed in Table 5-9 varies greatiy because of 
differences in both the atmospheric lifetime and the radiative 
effect per molecule of each gas, A good measure of the net 
climate effect 
of halocarbons 
and other 
halogenated 
compounds is provided by their radiative forcing. Radiative 
forcing will be addressed in IPCC's Third Assessment Report, 
but is not discussed in this report. 
Emissions of individual groups of halocarbons and other 
halogenated compounds in the four families of SRES scenarios 
are presented below.

HFCs are beginning to be produced as replacements for CFCs 
and HCFCs. Unlike the CFCs and the HCFCs, HFCs do not 
convey chlorine to the stratosphere and thus do not contribute 
to ozone depletion. 
For the development of future HFC emissions, Fenhann (2000) 
used a procedure based on the work by Kroeze (1995) that 
includes two steps: 
• 
"Virtual" future CFC emissions are first calculated 
assuming a situation without the Montreal Protocol. 
• 
CFCs are substituted 
with HFCs according to 
substitution percentages adopted from the literature 
(Table 5-9) and also the various degrees of emission 
reduction 
potentials 
from 
better 
housekeeping 
measures and technological change. 
Conceming the first step of the methodology used in Fenhaim 
(2000), 1990 CFC emissions were taken from the Scientific 
Assessment 
of t h e Ozone 
D e p l e t i o n (WMO/UNEP, 1998). Pre-
Montreal 1986 emissions were obtained from McCulloch et a l . 
(1994). Future "virtual" (assuming no Montreal protocol) 
emissions of CFCs were assumed to be proportional to their 
consumption, for which GDP numbers in the four marker 
scenarios were used as a driver (see Chapter 4). The saturation 
level of per capita demands was assumed to be the same in all 
four SRES scenario families. 
The 
projection of CFC emissions in the absence of the 
Montreal Protocol shows how emissions would change under 
conditions of unrestricted production. However, with the 
Montreal Protocol in place, other chemical compounds will be 
used to replace the Montreal gases. To compute the amount of 
CFCs replaced with these other compounds, future CFC 
emissions with the Montreal Protocol in place (according to the 
WMO/UNEP A3 ODS scenario) were first subtracted from the 
"virtual" CFC emissions. 
Different assumptions about CFC applications as well as 
substitute candidates were developed (Fenhann, 2000). These 
were initially based on Kroeze and Reijnders (1992) and 
Midgley and McCulloch (1999), and subsequentiy updated 
using the latest information from the J o i n t I P C C I T E A P 
Expert 
M e e t i n g o n O p t i o n s f o r the L i m i t a t i o n of E m i s s i o n s of H F C s 
a n d P F C s (WMO/UNEP, 1999). 
An important assumption (based on the latest infonnation from 
the industry) used in the current analysis is that relatively few 
Montreal gases will be replaced completely by HFCs. 
Currentiy, HFC-134a is favored, and it is the only HFC with 
sufficiently large sales to be included in the current production 
and sales statistics (AFEAS, 1998). The global emissions of 
this gas are estimated to be 0.1 kt HFC-134a in 1990 and 42.7 
kt HFC-134a in 1997. Current data indicate that substitution 
rates of CFCs by HFCs will be less than 50%. It was shown 
recentiy that in the European Union the substitution rate of 
CFCs by HCFCs was 26%, and the HFC share was 6% or a 
total of 32% (McCulloch and Midgley, 1998). Time series data 
for the global sales from AFEAS (1998) confirm a 763 kt per 
year reduction in CFC production and use from the peak 
production year of 1987 through 1996. An increase in the total 
HFC and HCFC production and use was 340 kt per year, or a

44% substitution up to 1996. In Fenhann (2000) future 
technological developments are assumed to result in about 25% 
of the CFCs ultimately being substituted by HFCs (Table 5-9). 
This low percentage not only reflects the introduction of non-
HFC substitutes, but also the notion that smaller amounts of 
halocarbons are used in many applications when changing to 
HFCs and that emissions are reduced by increased containment 
and recycling. A general assumption is that the present trend to 
not substitute CFCs with high GWP substances, including PFCs 
and SFg, will continue. The substitution rates shown in Table 5-
9 were used in all four scenarios; the technological options 
adopted are those known at present. Further substitution away 
from HFCs is assumed to require a climate policy. 
Hydrocarbons are expected to be the substitutes used in the 
a e r o s o l s l p r o p e l l a n t sector, except for situations in which the 
flammability of hydrocai-bons would be a problem and also in 
metered dose inhalers (to avoid possible adverse clinical 
effects). HFC-227ea and HFC-134a, and possibly HFC-152a 
are expected to replace hydrocarbons (Table 5-9; WMO/UNEP, 
1999). 
CFC-113 was used extensively as a c l e a n i n g solvent for metal, 
electronics, and textiles. The general trend in this area now is 
toward water-based systems. However, as suggested by Table 
5-9 a small fraction (0.5%) of the CFC in this sector is 
substituted by HFC-43-10 (Kroeze, 1995). 
The WMO/UNEP (1998) report states that no fluorocarbons 
are now used for open 
c e l l foams, 
an assumption also adopted 
in the scenarios. 
It is expected that closed c e l l foams 
and r e f r i g e r a t i o n will be 
the largest demand sectors for HFCs in the future. For c l o s e d 
cell foams, the substitution is expected to be 50%, one-half as 
HFC-134a and the other half as the liquid HFC-245fa 
(expected to be commercially available by 2002; Table 5-9) 
(Ashford, 1999). In some cases, HFC-365mfc will be used 
instead of HFC-245fa. However, all the calculations in Table 5-
9 were caiTied out for HFC245fa, since these two substances 
have almost the same climate effect. 
Prior to 1986, the main refrigerants 
in use were CFCs, HCFCs, 
and ammonia. In response to the Montreal Protocol, HFC and 
hydrocarbon refrigerants have been promoted as the primary 
altematives (WMO/UNEP, 1999). The main HFC assumed to be 
used for s t a t i o n a r y c o o l i n g is HFC-134a, with 5% of the demand 
substituted by HFC-125 and another 5% by HFC-143a (Kroeze, 
1995). This would agree with the reported measurements of 
these two substances in the atmosphere. According to Kroeze 
(1995) about 2% might be substituted by HFC-32. 
Before 1993, all air-conditioned cars were equipped with 
systems using CFC-12 as a refrigerant. Over the lifetime of a 
car, 0.4 kg of this halocarbon was emitted every year. In 1994, 
two years after the new refrigerant HFC-134a had become 
available globally in sufficient quantities, almost all major 
vehicle manufacturers 
began to use HFC-134a. This 
conversion was accompanied by a significant reduction in 
annual losses of refrigerants per car, down to 0.096 kg of 
halocarbon (Preisegger, 1999). Therefore the substitution rate 
in Table 5-9 for m o b i l e c o o l i n g is assumed to be 25%. 
In Xhe f i x e d f i r e e x t i n g u i s h e r s sector, only about 25% of the 
systems that formerly used halons now use HFCs, mainly 
HFC-227ea. The rest use COj, inert gas mixtures, water-based 
systems, foam, dry powder, etc. (WMO/UNEP, 1999). 
Increased environmental awareness in the industry is assumed 
to have resulted in the reduction of HFC emissions by a factor 
of three, compared to fonner practice. 
For p o r t a b l e fire e x t i n g u i s h e r s the substitution rate is assumed to 
be only 1%, even less than the 2% assumed by Kroeze (1995). 
CFCs have also been used for other puiposes, such as 
sterilants, tobacco expansion, and others. Kroeze (1995) 
2 6 8 
E m i s s i o n Scénarios 
assumes a 30% substkution by HFCs. However, in the SRES 
scénarios this value is reduced to 10% to remain consistent 
with the above assumption that HFCs ultimately will substitute 
for about 25% of the CFCs. 
As well as using non-halocarbon substitutes, HFC emissions 
can be avoided by better housekeeping, for instance by reduced 
spilling of cooling agents. Leakage control equipment can also 
serve this purpose. Finally, halocarbons can be recovered for 
recycling or destruction when equipment is discarded. Some of 
this emission reduction potential is likely to be implemented as 
a result of technological changes introduced to control ODSs. 
In the SRES scenarios, reduction rates were varied over time 
and between industrialized and developing countries to reflect 
the definitive features of the underlying storylines (Chapter 4). 
Generally, the reduction rates are assumed highest in scenarios 
that emphasize sustainability and environmental policies (Bl 
family). These reductions, however, were not associated with 
any explicit GHG reduction policies, as required by the SRES 
Terms of Reference (see Appendix I). In one scenario family, 
A2, no reductions were assumed, whereas in the A l and B2 
families reduction rates were set at intermediate levels. 
In addition to consumption-related emissions of HFCs, HFC-
23 is emitted as an undesired by-product from the HCFC-22 
production process. As a result of the Montreal Protocol, the 
direct use of HCFC-22, and hence the related HFC-23 
emissions, will come to a halt in 2050. To calculate the HFC-
23 emissions, information from Oram et a l . (1998) was used 
(estimated emissions of HFC-23 at 6.4 kt in 1990). By relating 
this value to 178.1 kt HCFC-22 emitted in 1990 (WMO/UNEP, 
1999), an emissions factor of 0.036 tons of HFC-23 per ton of 
HCFC-22 was calculated and applied to estimate future 
emissions. Since this estimation procedure does not take into 
account any pollution control regulations (that are not driven 
by climate considerations), it may result in an overestimation 
of HFC-23 during the early decades of the 2P' century, until 
HCFC production is phased out under the Montreal Protocol. 
After the phase-out of HCFC-22 consumption, some HFC-23 
emissions will still occur because of the continued HCFC-22 
feedstock production allowed under the Montreal Protocol. 
The resultant projections are shown by individual HFC in Table 
5-8. 
In general, the SRES scenaiios might underestimate HFC 
emissions if the substitution of CFCs with altematives that 
have no radiative forcing effect and with more efficient HFCs-
based technologies does not penetrate as quickly as is assumed, 
especially in developing countries. However, more effective 
technologies and/or suitable non-HFC altematives may be 
developed, which would lead t o even lower emissions. 
5.4.3.2. 
P e r f l u o r o c a r b o n s 
PFCs, fully fluorinated hydrocarbons, have extremely long 
atmospheric lifetimes (2600 to 50,000 years) and particularly 
high radiative forcing (Table 5-7). The production of aluminum 
is thought to be the largest source of PFCs (CF^, and CoFg ) 
emissions. These emissions are generated, primarily, by the 
anode effect, which occurs during the reduction of alumina 
(aluminum oxide) in the primary smelting process as alumina 
concentrations become too low in the smelter. Under these 
conditions, the electrolysis cell voltage increases sharply to a 
level sufficient for bath electrolysis to replace alumina 
electrolysis. This causes substantial energy loss and the release 
of fluorine, which reacts with carbon to form CF^ and CjFg. 
In 1990, the total annual global primary aluminum production 
was 19.4 Mt. Secondary aluminum production from recycling 
accounted for 21.5% of the total consumption in 1990. The 
production statistics from the World Bureau of Metal Statistics 
(1997) show that the total aluminum production was 27.5 Mt, 
and recycling has increased to 25.6%, or by about 3.5 
percentage points, in 10 years. 
The scenarios developed by Fenhann (2000) adopt a 
methodology of projecting future aluminum demand based on: 
• 
Aluminum consumption elasticity with respect to GDP. 
• 
Use of altemative assumptions conceming recycling 
rates. 
• 
Varying emission factors to reflect future technological 
change. 
These assumptions are altered to be in consistent with the four 
SRES scenario storylines described in Chapter 4. 
For instance, in Fenhann (2000) the aluminum consumption 
elasticity varies between 0.8 and 0.96, and the range of 
increases in aluminum recycling rates varies between 1.5 and 
3.5 percentage points per decade. The RFC emission factor 
varies according to the aluminum production technology used. 
The default emission factor from the Revised IPCC Guidelines 
(IPCC, 1997) is 1.4 k g C F / aluminum. However, Hamisch 
(1999) gives evidence that the average specific emissions of 
CF4 per ton of aluminum has decreased from about 1.0 kg to 
0.5 kg between 1985 and 1995. Accordingly, an emissions 
factor of 0.8 kgCF^/t was used for 1990 and this was assumed 
to decrease to 0.5 kg CFyt in the future. This is also in 
agreement with the value of 0.51 kgCF^/t recommended by the 
IPCC Expert Meeting on Good Practices in Inventory 
Preparation for Industrial Processes and the New Gases 
(January 1999, Washington, DC). The same sources also agree 
on an emission factor for C^Fg that is 10 times lower than that 
for CF4. This assumption was also used in the calculations 
presented here (Table 5-8). 
Aluminum production is being upgraded from highly 
inefficient smelters and practices to reduce the frequency and 
duration of the anode effect. Since aluminum smelters are large 
consumers of energy, the costs of these modifications are offset 
by savings in energy costs and are therefore assumed to occur 
in all scenarios. The ultimate reduction of the anode eiïect 
frequency and duration was assumed to reach the same level in 
all the SRES scenarios. However, scenarios vary with respect 
to the rate of introducing the underlying modifications. It is 
E m i s s i o n 
S c e n a r i o s 
2 6 9 
technically possible to reduce the anode emissions by a factor 
of 10 (EU, 1997). This technically feasible reduction can be 
achieved by changing from the Soderberg cells currently in use 
to more modern pre-bake cells. It is assumed that this will 
happen in the A l and B l family scenarios, in which specific 
emissions of 0.15 kgCF^/t are achieved by 2040 in the 
OECD90 region and by 2090 in the other regions. In the A2 
and B2 family scenarios the same specific emissions are 
achieved later in the century in the OECD90 region and not 
until after 2100 in the other regions. 
PFCs are consumed in small amounts in such sectors as 
electronics (tracers), cosmetics, and medical applications. 
However, the only emissions included in Fenhann (2000) 
beyond aluminum production were PFCs (as CF^) from 
semiconductor production. In all SRES scenarios the emission 
estimates used are those given by Hamisch et a l . (1999) of 0.3 
kt CF4 per year in 1990, 1.1 ktCF^ in 2000, 1.0 ktCF^ in 2010, 
and constant thereafter. The use of these estimates reflects the 
voluntary 
agreement, 
in 
April 
1999, of the 
World 
Semiconductor Council, which represent manufacturers from 
Europe, Japan, Korea, and the US, among others. According to 
this agreement, manufacturers have adopted the emission 
reduction target for PFCs of 10% absolute reduction from 1995 
emission levels by 2010. This target encompasses over 90% of 
the total semiconductor production (WMO/UNEP, 1999). The 
total PEC emissions in the four SRES scenario families cover 
a range from 24 to 97 kt PFC in 2100 (Table 5-8; Fenhann, 
2000). 
5.4.3.3. 
Sulfur 
h e x a f l u o r i d e 
SFg is an extremely stable atmospheric trace gas. All studies 
concur that this gas is entirely anthropogenic. Its unique 
physico-chemical properties make SFg ideally suited for many 
specialized industrial applications. Its 100-year GWP of 
23,900 is the highest of any atmospheric trace gas. In 1994, 
atmospheric concentrations of SFg were reported to rise by 
6.9% per year, which is equivalent to annual emissions of 
5,800 tSFg (Maiss et a l , 1996). 
According to several sources (Kroeze, 1995; Maiss et a l , 
1996; Victor and MacDonald, 1998), about 80% of SFg 
emissions originate from its use as an insulator in high-voltage 
electrical equipment. The remaining 20% of the present global 
SFg emissions (1200 tons per year) are emitted from 
magnesium foundries, in which SFg is used to prevent 
oxidation of molten magnesium. The global annual production 
of magnesium is about 350,000 tons (US Geological Survey, 
1998), and developing countries account for about 15% of the 
total. SFg is also used to de-gas aluminum, but since SFg reacts 
with aluminum, little or no atmospheric emissions result from 
this process. 
Major manufacturers of SFg agreed voluntarily to co-operate 
on the compilation of worldwide SFg sales data by end-use 
markets. Six companies from the US (three), Japan, Italy, and 
Germany participated in the data survey. The companies do not 
expect the total sales for magnesium foundries to increase 
before 2000 (Science & Policy Services Inc., 1997). Based on 
this information, the 1996 statistical production values were 
used for the year 2000 in the fomiulation of the scenarios 
reported in Fenhann (2000). Future production was projected 
assuming the same consumption elasticity to GDP as for 
aluminum (see discussion above). In 1996, about 41% of the 
world magnesium was produced in the US; of this, only 16% 
was processed in foundries for casting that resulted in 
emissions of SFg (Victor and MacDonald, 1998). Since the 
distribution of world foundry capacity appears to be roughly 
similar to that of world magnesium production, Fenhann 
(2000) assumes that, presently, 16% of the produced 
magnesium is processed in foundries across all regions. 
Relating this amount of the processed magnesium to the 
aforementioned emission of 1200 tSFg per year yields an 
emission factor of 21 kgSFg per ton of magnesium processed in 
foundries. The demand for magnesium in automotive 
applications as a strong lightweight replacement for steel is 
growing quickly. Hence, it is expected that the fraction of total 
magnesium production processed in foundries by 2050 will 
grow to between two to three times the present level. 
As mentioned above, no less than 80% of SFg emissions (or 
4600 tons of SFg per year at present) originate from the use of 
SFg as a gaseous insulator in high-voltage electrical equipment. 
The unique ability of SFg to quench electric arcs has enabled 
the development of safe, reliable gas-insulated high-voltage 
breakers, substations, transformers, and transmission lines. The 
demand for such electrical equipment is assumed to grow 
proportionally to electricity demand (Victor and MacDonald, 
1998; Fenhann, 2000) with an emission factor of 132.6 tSFg/EJ 
electricity. Fenhann (2000) used preliminary electricity 
generation projections from the four SRES marker scenarios 
and assumed additional various other potentials for emission 
reductions that result from more careful handling, recovery, 
recycling, and substitution of SFg. Reduction rates vary in the 
different SRES scenario storylines; the detailed assumptions 
are reported in Fenhann (2000). The SFg emissions for the four 
scenarios given in Fenhann (2000) range from 7 to 25 ktSFg in 
2100. The main driver is electricity consumption, since the 
bulk of emissions originate from electric power transmission 
(for transformers). 
SFg is also emitted from other minor sources, but for the 
purposes of this report it is assumed that uncertainty ranges 
factored into the alternative scenario formulations cover the 
emissions from these sources. 
5.5. 
Aerosols and Ozone Precursors 
In addition to the GHGs discussed above, aerosol particles and 
tropospheric ozone also change the radiative balance of the 
atmosphere, albeit in a spatially heterogeneous manner. Sulfate 
aerosol particles, which form as a consequence of SOj 
emissions, act as a cooling agent. Their net effect is quite 
uncertain, but is thought to offset the forcing from all ПОП-СО2 
2 7 0 
E m i s s i o n S c e n a r i o s 
GHGs to date (Houghton et a l . , 1996). As interest in the role of 
sulfur has increased the since the previous IPCC assessment, 
and to encapsulate recent trends and expectations, sulfur 
emissions are discussed here in substantial detail. Nitrates, 
ammonia, organic compounds, and black carbon also 
contribute to the formation of atmospheric 
aerosols. 
Carbonaceous aerosols exert a small positive forcing effect, 
while the effects of other compounds and aerosols are less 
clear. Tropospheric ozone is a GHG also, with a small net 
positive forcing effect. Future tropospheric ozone levels will be 
determined by emissions of CH^, CO, N0^,, and NMVOCs. 
The last three groups are repotted and discussed here in a more 
aggregated and stylized form only, because these gases are 
short lived, their potential to form ozone is highly non-linear; 
NMVOCs are not distinguished by their reactivity, and data 
problems associated with including key sources in aggregated 
long-term models are large.

Emissions of NO^, primarily result from the combustion of 
fossil fuels. The N0^^ concentration in exhaust gases depends 
on combustion conditions (temperature, residence time, air-to-
fuel ratio, mixing) and varies widely across different 
applications. In particular, internal combustion engines used in 
road vehicles and ships have very high emissions, although 
new designs and exhaust-gas treatment offer much lower 
specific emission levels. Recent research (Davidson and 
Kingerlee, 1997; Delmas et a l . , 1997; Mosier et a i , 1998) 
indicates that soil may be a significant source of N0^^ emissions 
also. This source, however, is not included in the models used 
in the current report. 
The 
1990 NOjj emissions in the six SRES models range 
between 26.5 and 34.2 MtN, but not all the models provide a 
comprehensive description of N0^^ emissions. Some models do 
not estimate N0^ emissions at all (MARIA, MiniCAM^), 
whereas 
others 
only 
include 
energy-related 
sources 
(MESSAGE) and have adopted other source categories from 
corresponding model runs derived from other models (i.e. 
AIM). 
Standardized (see Box 5-1 on Standardization) 1990 
N O ^ emissions in the SRES scenarios, measured as nitrogen, 
amount to 31 MtN (Figure 5-9). 
As mentioned in Chapter 4, the volume of fossil fuels used for 
various energy purposes varies widely in the SRES scenario 
families. In addition, the level and timing of emission controls, 
inspired by local air quality concems, is assumed to differ. As 
a result the spread is largest within the A l scenario family, in 
* For the A l G - M i n i C A M scenario emissions from congruent model 
runs derived from other models have been estimated. 
which it is almost as large as the range across all 40 SRES 
scenarios. Up to the 2020s, all scenarios project rising N0^ 
emissions (Figure 5-9). The 25* and 75"^ percentile emissions 
corridor spans between 40 and 60 MtN by the 2020s, which 
can be inteipreted as a "central tendency" among the entire 
spectrum of the 40 SRES scenarios. Beyond 2030, 
uncertainties in emission levels increase significantly. By 2100, 
the SRES range is between 16 and 150 MtN (i.e. emissions 
decrease by a factor of two or increase by a factor of five 
compaied with 1990 levels). The median and mean emissions 
are tracked by a number of scenarios, most notably by B2-
MESSAGE (B2 family marker) and A l B - I M A G E . In these 
scenarios, N0^^ emissions tend to increase up to 2050 and 
stabilize thereafter, the result of a gradual substitution of fossil 
fuels by altematives as well as by the increasing diffusion of 
NOj^ control technologies. Low emission futures are described 
by various B l family scenarios, whereas the upper bound for 
future NOj^ emissions is represented by scenarios of the fossil 
fuel intensive A l scenario groups (e.g. A l C - and A I G -
MESSAGE) and the high population, high fossil energy A2 
scenario family (A2-ASF, A2-MESSAGE, or A2G-IMAGE) 
(Figure 5-9). 
The fossil fuel dominated A2-ASF (A2 family marker) with 
limited environmental concern has a rapidly increasing N0^, 
üajectory (Figure 5-9). Emissions in other A2 scenarios also 
continue to grow, except in A2-AIM for which emissions level 
off by the last decades of the 2Г^ century. In the A l B marker 
(AlB-AIM), the emissions growth is initially about as strong 
as in A2-ASF, but emissions peak in 2030, and decline as the 
fossil fuel share of total primary energy falls and the remaining 
fossil fuel technologies become more advanced (Figure 5-9). 
Scenarios from other A l family groups that assume a much 
larger and continued role of fossil fuels yield much higher N0^, 
emissions, which reach 150 MtN by 2100 in the coal-based 
A l C - M E S S A G E scenario. Emission growth in the B2 family 
scenarios is less steep than in the A l family, but persists 
throughout the entire period, albeit at a declining rate. By 2100, 
emissions in the B2-MESSAGE scenario (B2 family marker) 
are about twice as large as in 1990 (Figure 5-9). B2-ASF has a 
similar trajectory, while the B2-AIM scenario has essentially 
constant NO^ emissions over the entire period. Emissions in 
the В1 marker (B1-IMAGE) are among the lowest of all the 40 
scenarios (Figure 5-9). In this scenario, emissions increase 
stops around 2050 and subsequently declines toward the end of 
the 2U' century to 60% of the current level. Other scenarios 
withm the ВI group coincide well with the В1 marker in 2100, 
although the maximum emission levels in these scenarios are 
much higher than in B l - I M A G E (Figure 5-9).

NMVOCs arise from fossil fuel combustion (as with N0^, 
wide ranges of emission factors are typical for internal 
combustion engines), and also from industrial processes, fuel 
storage (fugitive emissions), use of solvents (e.g., in paint and 
cleaners), and a variety of other activities. As the chemical

NMVOCs category are very different, so are their roles in 
ozone formation and the (potential) health hazards associated 
with NMVOCs. In this report NMVOCs are reported as one 
group. In 1990, the estimated NMVOC emissions range 
between 83 and 178 Mt, which after standardization (see Box 
5-1) translates into 140 Mt (Figure 5-10). As discussed above 
for NOjj emissions, not all models include this emissions 
category or all of its sources; the most detailed treatment of 
NMVOC emissions is given in the ASF model. 
A relatively robust trend across all 40 scenarios (see Figure 5-
10) is a gradual increase in NMVOC emissions up to about 
2050, as indicated by the 25* and 75"' percentile corridor, with 
the range between 190 and 260 Mt by that year. Beyond 2050, 
uncertainties increase with respect to both emission levels and 
hends. As for N0^ emissions discussed above, the upper 
bounds of NMVOC emissions are formed by fossil fuel 
intensive scenarios within the A l scenario family (e.g. A l B -
'^SF), and the lower bounds by the scenarios within the ВI 
family (with an impoitant altemative higher scenario Bl-ASF). 
Characteristic ranges are between 60 and 90 Mt by 2100 in the 
•ow emissions cluster and between 370 and 550 Mt in the high 
emissions cluster. A l l other scenario families and individual 
scenarios fall between these two emissions clusters, with the B2 
marker scenario (B2-MESSAGE) closely tracking the median 
of global NMVOC emissions from all the SRES scenarios. 
In the B l family marker (BI-IMAGE) emissions gradually 
decline to 60% of the 1990 level by 2100 (Figure 5-10). The 
B l - A I M and Bl-MESSAGE trajectories are similai', but differ 
somewhat from the В1 marker. They increase until the 2020s 
(AIM) or even the 2050s (MESSAGE) at modest rates, but 
subsequently decline to around or even below the В1 marker in 
2100. The B l - A S F profile, however, is radically different, 
growing faster and continuously throughout the 2P' century. 
By 2100, the NMVOC emissions in B l - A S F increase to 350 
Mt, or 2.5 times the 1990 level. This indicates the adoption in 
this scenario of fairly different assumptions with respect to 
technological development and emission controls as compared 
to the rest of В1 scenarios. In the A2 family marker (A2-ASF) 
and B2 family marker (B2-MESSAGE), emissions grow 
steadily until 2050, by which time they are around 50% higher 
than today. Thereafter, emissions in B2-MESSAGE decline 
gradually, while in the A2 marker the growth continues to reach

2.5 times the cuirent level by 2100 (similar to Bl-ASF). 
Emissions in A2-MESSAGE are fairly similar to those of the 
A2 marker, while emissions in A2-AIM decline to 170 Mt by 
2100, 
only half of the A2 marker level. The trajectory in the 
AIB marker (AIB-AIM) is very distinct - up to 2060 a fast 
growth is observed to more than twice the 1990 level, after 
which emissions decline to the B2 family marker level (Figure 
5-10). A decrease of N M V O C emissions in A I B - A I M after 
2060 is explained mainly by the substitution of fossil fuels with 
renewables, especially in the transport sector. A very similar 
trajectory emerges in the AIB-MESSAGE scenario, while the 
A l B - A S F scenario emissions grow continuously up to 2100, 
by when they are the highest of the set at 550 Mt, almost four 
times the 1990 level.

C O emissions in 1990 are estimated to range between 752 and 
984 MtCO across the models used to derive the SRES 
scenarios. The same caveats as for N0^^ and N M V O C 
emissions (see above) also apply to CO emissions - the number 
of models that represent all the emission source categories is 
limited and modeling and data uncertainties, such as emission 
factors, are considerable. As a resuh, CO emission estimates 
across the scenarios are highly model specific, as indicated by 
the overlapping ranges of the four scenario families (Figure 5-
11). 
From a standardized (see Box 5-1) 1990 level of 880 
MtCO the range of future emissions is rather wide for both 
medium-term and long-term time horizons. By 2020, 
emissions range from 630 to 1550 MtCO, by 2050 they range 
between 470 and 2300 MtCO, and by 2100 the range is 
between 360 and 3760 MtCO (i.e. one order of magnitude 
difference between the highest and the lowest projections). 
Focusing on the 25* and 75* percentile intervals reduces 
uncertainty ranges somewhat, but nonetheless they remain 
substantial - between 1260 and 2300 MtCO by 2100. The 
median of all 40 scenarios is tracked quite closely by the B2-
ASF scenario at the global level. 
Emissions of CO follow rather different trajectories in the SRES 
markers than emissions of NMVOCs, except the A2 marker 
(A2-ASF). Starting from the standardized (see Box 5-1) level of 
880 MtCO in 1990, emissions in the AIB marker (AlB-AlM) 
grow continuously and almost double between 1990 and 2100 
(Figure 5-11). Emissions in AIB-MESSAGE (Roehrl and Riahi, 
2000) increase at a higher rate than in the marker and reach 
thrice the curtent level by 2100. Emissions in A l B - A S F grow as 
fast as in AIB-MESSAGE until 2040 (1700 MtCO versus 1650 
MtCO for AIB-MESSAGE), when the growth stops and 
emissions more or less stabilize. Emissions in the B 1 - I M A G E

(B1 family marker) gradually decline to 40% of the current level 
by 2100 (Figure 5-11). Again, other B l family scenarios have 
quite different trajectories and the pattems generated by AIM, 
ASF, and MESSAGE models for the B l scenario family are 
similar to those derived by the same models for other storylines. 
The shape of the A2 family marker (A2-ASF) trajectory is very 
similar to that for NMVOCs, which suggests that these two 
substances are governed mainly by the same drivers and that 
similar assumptions with regard to improved emissions factors 
are adopted. The emission trajectory in the B2 marker (B2-
M E S S A G E ) is just below the A2 marker trajectory and is about 
2000 MtCO by 2100, more than twice the 1990 level. An 
increase of biomass energy use after 2050 becomes an important 
factor that affects emissions in this scenario. Otiier B2 family 
scenarios produced using the AIM and ASF models closely track 
the B2 marker, although emissions in these scenarios are 
somewhat lower, with those of B2-ASF at 1700 MtCO by 2100 
and of B2-AIM falling just below 1500 MtCO.

Sulfur 
'aerosols result from complex atmospheric processes in which 
^"ilfur emissions play an important role. Besides sulfur, other 
substances, like NO^, ammonia, and small particles from the 
buming of fossil fuels and biomass, are involved in these 
processes. 
Global anthropogenic sulfur emissions are estimated to range 
between 65 and 90 MtS in 1990 (Houghton et a l . , 1995; 
Benkovitz et a i , 1996; Olivier et a l . , 1996; WMO, 
1997). 
Reviews of most recent inventories, given in Smith et a l . 
(2000) and Grübler (1998), indicate a most likely value of 75 + 
10 MtS. These reviews draw on a large body of literature 
sources and sulfur inventories (in particular the EMEP and 
CORINAIR inventories for Europe, NAPAP for North 
America, and the most recent inventories available for Asia, 
including Akimoto and Narita (1994), Foell et a l . (1995), and 
Kato (1996)). Anthropogenic emissions add to natural sulfur 
flows, which are estimated to range between 4 and 45 MtS 
(Houghton et a l . , 1995). Pepper et a l . (1992) adopted an 
intermediary, constant natural sulfur flux of 22 MtS for the 
IS92 scenario series. 
Even with a comparatively good agreement on global sulfur 
emission levels, important uncertainties remain at the sector 
and regional levels (discussed in more detail in Alcamo et a l . 
(1997) and Grübler (1998)). The main sources of uncertainties 
are a lack of detailed inventory data (especially for developing 
countries outside Asia, but also for the non-European part of

Russia), uncertainties in sulfur contents of fuels (especially 
coal) in many regions, and the use of different base years for 
development of sulfur inventories. For instance, inventories 
and scenario studies for China and Centrally Planned Asia give 
a range of sulfur emissions that differ by more than a factor of 
two (8.4 to 18 MtS) for the year 1990 (Grübler, 1998). 
Base-year differences in the available data sources are 
especially important because regional sulfur emissions trends 
have changed drastically in the past decade. Although they 
decreased strongly in Europe and North America as a result of 
sulfur control policies, they increased rapidly in Asia with 
growing energy demand and coal use. For instance, between 
1980 and 1995 sulfur emissions declined by 59% in Western 
Europe and Russia (albeit for entirely different reasons -
environmental policy limiting sulfur emissions in Westem 
Europe versus a massive economic depression in Russia), by 
37% in Eastern Europe, and by 36% in North America (ECE, 
1997). Conversely, emissions in China rose rapidly, from an 
estimated 6.6 MtS in 1985 to 9.1 MtS in 1994, or by 38% 
(Sinton, 1996; Dadi et a l . , 1998). These diverging emission 
trends and their rapid changes also require a continuous 
updating of available gridded sulfur emission inventories (e.g., 
Dignon and Hameed, 1989; Spiro et a l . , 1992; Benkovitz et a l . , 
1996; Olivier et a l . , 1996) that in, some instances, still rely on 
outdated 1980 emissions data. 
Global base-year (1990) sulfur emission values from the SRES 
models range from 63 to 77 MtS, with the addition of 3 MtS 
from international shipping.^ This difference reflects the 
existing uncertainty in sulfur emission estimates, particularly 
at the regional level. The range is within the range of values 
given by global inventories. 
Model differences at the regional level are even larger, which 
reflects the greater uncertainty of emission inventories at this 
level, particularly outside the OECD countries. To standardize 
sulfur emissions, the number of SRES reporting regions was 
increased to six regions, by splitting Latin America from the 
A L M region and Centrally Planned Asia and China from ASIA. 
Important differences in economic development status and 
resource endowments lead to different patterns of sulfur 
emissions across all SRES scenarios. Regional emissions were 
standardized (see Box 5-1) and then aggregated to the global 
level. Global standardized base-year emissions for 1990 for the 
SRES scenarios are equal to 70.9 MtS, in line with the literature 
range of global emission inventories given above. The regional 
sulfur emission profiles were also used to generate spatially 
gridded emission patterns (see Section 5.6.2 below). 
Concerning future emissions of sulfur, the SRES scenarios 
reflect recent literature and trends of sulfur control scenarios, as 
well as the conclusions from the 1994 evaluation of the IS92 
scenarios (Alcamo et a l . , 1995). Despite considerable scenario 
variability, all scenarios portray similar emission dynamics - at 
various future dates (between 2020-2030 and 2070, depending 
^ FoUowing U N energy statistics and IPCC inventory practices, 
intemational bunker fuels are included in global totals, but not in 
national/regional subtotals (and thek aggregates to global totals). 
Hence, bunker fuels are reported separately here.

The A l family of scenarios covers most of the range of the 40 
SRES scenarios (Figure 5-13a). The A l B - A I M marker is in the 
middle of the range and its trajectory is similar to those of 
many other scenarios - a rapid increase in the near term 
followed by a decline. Increasing fossil fuel use in developing 
countries combined with low levels of SO^ controls produces 
the near-term increase in emissions. After 2025, per capita 
incomes reach levels at which countries place more emphasis 
on the environment, resulting in emission controls on SOj (see 
Section 4.4.10). These controls, combined with a transition 
from fossil fuels to non-fossil energy, result in declining 
emissions. More detailed information as to how SO, emissions 
ше treated in the A l B - A I M scenario is provided in Box 5-3 .

Box 5-3: Sulfur Emissions in Ше AIB-AIM Mariier Scenario 
In the A I B - A I M marker scenario, global SO2 emissions increase rapidly from 70.6 MtS m 1990 to reach a peak around 2020 
at 101 MtS, and subsequently decline to around 30 MtS after 2050. The global SOj emission trajectory follows that of the 
developing countries, for which emissions mercase because of the rapid growth of fossil fuel use driven by rapid economic 
development, combined with a lack of sulfur controls that reflect investment and infrastracture limitations. With an increase m 
personal incomes in developing countries and associated concems about local air pollution, SO2 becomes controlled in a similar 
way to that in developed countries, for which SOj emissions have declined in the past two decades. 
The sources of SOj emissions tracked by the A I M model include energy use, industrial production processes (steel and cement 
production), and biomass buming. 
The major factors of SOj emission reduction are changes in the fuel mix, use of advanced energy technology, and 
implementation of desulfurization technology. In the A I B - A I M scenario, the volume and share in total primary energy of coal 
and crade oil changes drastically over time (Table 5-10).

Before 2050, both advanced energy technology and desulfurization play a key role in the SO2 emissions reduction. In the power 
generation sector, integrated gasiñcation combined cycle (IGCC), fluidized bed combustion (FBC), and flue-gas desulfurization 
(FGD) technologies are adopted. In the industry and commercial sectors, F B C boilers, fuel desulfurization and FGD are 
adopted. SOj emission reductions are also achieved in the transport sector. Table 5-11 summarizes the SO2 abatement effect of 
these technologies.

Income levels determine the time at which these technologies are introduced in the A I B - A I M scenario. According to the 
experience of SO2 emission controls in developed countries, low-income developing countries will start to introduce SOj 
emission control technologies when GDP reaches around US$3500 per capita in 1990 dollars. In A I B - A I M this threshold level 
is reached in a period of about 30 years.

subsequent decline in emissions is less pronounced. The 
MiniCAM model has a higher level of 
controls, but also a 
greater fossil fuel use, resulting in slightly higher SO, 
emissions in 2100. 
The AIT, A I G , and A l C scenario groups assume various roles 
for the development of energy resources and technologies (the 
coal-intensive A I C scenario group, the oil- and gas-intensive 
A I G group, and the AIT scenaiio group with accelerated non-
fossil technology diffusion). Consequently, they span a very 
wide range of future sulfur emissions, ranging from 20 MtS by 
2100 in the AIT-MESSAGE scenario to 83 MtS in the A l C -
AIM scenario. 
5.5.2.2. 
A2 S c e n a r i o F a m i l y 
Sulfur emission trajectories in all the A2 family scenarios, 
except A 2 - A I - M i n i C A M with its much lower energy 
consumption, have the same general convex shape (Figure 5-
13b). However, the rime when maximum emissions are 
attained varies quite widely across the scenarios. Emissions 
peak in the A2-ASF marker scenario in 2030, in A2-
MESSAGE in 2040, in A2G-IMAGE in 2050, in A2-
MiniCAM in 2060, and in A2-AIM not until 2070. These 
differences are explained primarily by different assumptions 
about the mechanisms of SOj reduction adopted in different 
models. For example, the SOj reduction in A2-MESSAGE is 
explained by fundamental structural changes in the electricity 
generation technologies, while the A2-ASF scenario assumes a 
rapid introduction of inexpensive end-of-the-pipe sulfur 
scrubbers and shifts to low-sulfur fuel qualities. 
The A2-A1-MiniCAM scenario yields a nearly flat sulfur 
emission profile, explained by a relatively slow growth in 
population and GDP in the first half of the 2P' century 
(compared to other scenarios of the A2 family) and by 
expedited technological progress in the second half 
Numeric estimates of SOj emissions developed by different 
models ушу substantially, especially in the middle of the 
modeling period (Figure 5-13b). Emissions are largest in the 
A2-AIM scenario, exceeding 160 MiS in 2070. From 2020 to 
2060 the lowest emissions are produced by the A2-A1-
MiniCAM scenario, while after 2070 the lowest emissions are 
achieved in the A2-ASF scenaiio. 
5 . 5 . 2 . 3 . ВI S c e n a r i o F a m i l y 
Sulfur emissions in the ВI family scenarios fall within the 
lower third of the full range of emissions from the SRES 
scenarios (Figure 5-12). The BI-IMAGE trajectory is generally 
posifioned in the middle of the B l family range in the first 
decades of the 2P' century, which corresponds to a 75% 
reducüon of emissions in industrialized countries between 
2000 and 2050. The near-term increase in emissions in B l -
IMAGE occurs predominantly in developing countries and is 
associated with increases in fossil fuel use in those regions, 
combined with relafively low levels of emission controls. After 
2040, increased emission controls and declines in fossil fuel 
use result in decreasing SQ2 emissions. 
Emissions in other В1 family scenarios decline even faster than 
in Bl-IMAGE. In B l - A I M , a decline in emissions is directiy 
related to per capita incomes. As developing countries reach 
levels of US$3500 per capita in 1990 dollars, they start to apply 
more stringent SO, controls that lead to quickly dropping 
emission levels (Figure 5-13c). 
5 . 5 . 2 . 4 . 82 S c e n a r i o F a m i l y 
Emissions in the B2 family scenarios cover close to the full 
range of SO2 emissions (Figure 5-12). The B2-MESSAGE 
scenario yields steadily declining global emissions from 1990. 
This overall trajectory includes a tripling of emissions from 
non-energy sources by 2050, with subsequent stabilization and 
eventual decline after that (Figure 5-13d). The increase in 
emissions from non-energy sources is more than offset by very 
rapid reductions in emissions from energy sources between 
2015 and 2050. Developing countries have rising emissions 
through to 2025, which stabilize by 2050, and decfine 
thereafter. This increase in emissions in developing countries is 
offset by reductions in developed countries. These results are 
explained largely by regional measures and technological 
changes to minimize critical loads of acidic deposition (see 
Box 5-4). The B2-ASF scenario projects very rapid growth in 
emissions from energy use through 2025, primarily from 
increases in fossil fuel use in developing countries. After 2025, 
the growth in fossil fuel declines and developing countries 
become wealthier and are more aggressive on SOj emission 
controls, which in the ASF model are directiy linked to 
GDP/capita levels. Emissions from other industrial sources 
increase steadily throughout the period as economic activity 
increases. 
5.5.2.5. 
I n t e r - F a m i l y C o m p a r i s o n 
The relatively rapid desulfurization in the A l B - A I M marker 
compared to the other SRES markers mainly results from high 
capital turnover rates and, therefore, rapid diffusion of new and 
clean technologies combined with high income levels in the 
developing world by the middle of the 2P' century (Figure 5-
12). The structure and pattems of sulfur emissions for the two 
illustrative scenarios in the two scenario groups A l F I and AIT 
are similar to those of the A I B and B l marker scenarios, 
respectively, and are therefore not discussed separately here. 
As technological progress and income growth are the slowest 
in A2 among all the SRES scenario families, the primary 
energy mix in the A2-ASF marker by 2100 is still dominated 
by fossil fuels, with about 50% of the primary energy supplied 
by coal. Although measures are adopted to limit local and 
regional environmental damages, sulfur-mitigation measures in 
the A2 world are less pronounced than in the other SRES 
scenarios. Therefore, global sulfur emissions in the A2 marker 
are highest as compared to the other markers (Figure 5-12).

Box 5-4: Future Sulfur Dioxide Emissions in tlie B2 Marker Scenario 
Future global emissions of SOj are generally lower across the SRES emissions scenarios compared to most earlier projections, 
because of three factors: 
• 
Switch to cleaner fuels, such as natural gas and renewable sources. 
• 
Transition to cleaner, more efficient coal technologies, such as IGCC generation and pressurized 
FBC. 
• 
Utilization of direct emissions-reduction technologies, such as 
FGD. 
The scope of reductions from fuel switching is illustrated by the following. At present, 60% of anthropogenic SO, emissions in 
developing regions are from the direct use of fossil fuels in buildings and industry (Smith et a l . , 2000). Reductions in these 
emissions will be realized by shifting from an energy stmcture that relies on the direct use of solid fuels to one that increasingly 
relies on distributed energy grids (electricity, natural gas, etc.). This shift, and a resultant decrease in SO^ emissions, has already 
occurred m Europe and North America. Further reductions are expected m the future as more efficient, and inherently low 
emission, fossil fuel technologies (such as IGCC) become commercialized. Explicit policies for sulfur emissions reductions, 
such as the use of FGD devices, will be needed to meet emissions targets in the near term, but are likely to be less necessary in 
the longer term. 
To illustrate these trends and the resultant decrease in SOj emissions over the 2P' century, emissions in the B2-MESSAGE 
scenario (Riahi and Roehil, 2000) are analyzed. Global energy-related SO^ emissions m this B2 scenario decline from 59 MtS 
in 1990 to about 12 MtS in 2100. The primaiy causes for this reduction are the transition to more advanced coal technologies 
and desulfurization. Consistent with the characteristics of gradual change in the B2 storyline, the aggregated emissions 
coefficient'^ for power production from coal declmes from about 5.3 kgS/MWh in 1990 to 0.04 kgS/MWh in the year 2100. 
The latter emissions intensity is similar to that of the most advanced current technologies, for example, the Siemens IGCC98 
power plant featuring 0.032 kgS/MWh (Baumann et a l . , 1998). In the second half of the 2P' century, desulfurization of the 
energy system also takes place because of the production of methanol from coal. Sulfur removal is a process-inherent featare. 
Methanol is mainly used in the transport sector as a substitute for оП products that become scarce after 2050. 
The percentage reductions m energy-related SO2 emissions in the B2 scenaiio are shown in Table 5-12 as a function of time for 
five technologies. These percentages were obtained by re-calculating the B2-MESSAGE emissions scenario with the energy 
structure and emissions coefficients held constant in time at those of 1990. In this hypothetical case, SOj emissions in 2100 
would be 227 MtS. Accordingly, energy-related SO^ emissions in 2100 are reduced by about 215 MtS in the B2 scenario, 68% 
of which results from technological change and 32% from fuel switchmg. By the year 2100 the contribution to these emissions 
reductions by flue-gas scrubbing (FGD) 
is negligible by the year 2100, because more-advanced coal technologies eliminate any 
need for it. Furthermore, a shift m refining technology to lighter oil products, currently underway worldwide, contributes to a 
reduction m SO, emissions, particularly in the early part of the 2P' century.

Following the B l storyline, in the Bl-IMAGE marker the 
emphasis is on global solutions to environmental sustainability 
and improved welfare 
and development 
equity. 
High 
technological development rates in the renewable energy sector 
result in a continued structural shift away from fossil fuels. 
All emissions coefficients were calculated with the MESSAGE 
model. 
Combined with dematerialization of the economy and with the 
most pronounced sulfur mitigation measures assumed among the 
SRES scenarios, this results in emissions that peak around 2020 
and subsequentiy decline continuously to 2100 (Figure 5-12). 
In the B2 scenario family, and thus in the B2-MESSAGE 
marker, strong emphasis is placed on regional environmental 
protection. Dynamics of technological change continue along 
historical trends ("dynamics as usual"), which are slower than 
2 8 0

Scénarios 
in tlie A l or B l familles, but faster than in the A2 family. Sulfur 
emission projections for the 
В 2 marker scenario were 
generated on the basis of minimization of critical loads of 
acidic deposition using the methodology described in Amann 
et a l . (1996). No explicit link between income levels and sulfur 
control regime was made in this scenario. The resultant sulfur 
emissions are 61 IVltS in 2020, 56 MtS in 2050, and 48 MtS in 
2100 (see Figure 5-12). 
All the SRES marker scenarios anticipate increasing levels of 
sulfur control, with rates and timing ranging from rapid 
introduction of stringent controls in B l - I M A G E to more 
gradual, later, and less stringent controls in A2-ASF. To 
illustrate the impacts of sulfur controls in the scenarios, an 
"uncontrolled sulfur" variant of the B2 marker scenario was 
calculated at the Intemational Association for Applied Systems 
Analysis (IIASA; for details see Box 5-4). In this hypothetical 
scenario, sulfur emissions amount to 182 MtS in 2050 and 227 
MtS in 2100 (compared to 57 and 47 MtS, respectively, in the 
B2 marker scenario). These emission levels are much higher 
even than those in the A2 marker scenario (105 MtS in 2050 
and 60 MtS in 2100). 
5.6. 
Regional Distribution and Gridding 
Regional information on emissions serves at least two major 
purposes - to identify the contribution of world regionsto the 
global total and to track shifts in the relative weight of different 
regions. This information is especially relevant for the 
development of mitigation scenarios. For climate modeling, the 
regional distribution of emissions for well-mixed GHGs (COj, 
CH^, 
N^O, and halocarbons) may not be that important. 
However, short-lived gases such as SO2 are radiatively 
important close to the point of origin only; their local and 
regional concentrations may significantly change the future 
climate outlook. The same is true for the group of ozone 
precursors (CO, N0^, and NMVOCs). To be able to estimate 
tropospheric 
ozone 
concentration 
levels, regionalized 
information is indispensable. 
The initial evaluation showed that the 40 SRES scenarios have 
a very substantial regional variability in emissions of all 
radiatively important substances. The detailed and rigorous 
analysis of this variability falls outside the scope of the cuiTent 
report. Therefore, this section merely illustrates possible 
regional pattems based on standardized regional emissions in 
the four SRES marker scenarios (see also Kjam et a l . , 2000). 
Standardized regional outputs from the 40 SRES scenarios are 
provided in Appendix VII. 
Subsection 5.6.1 describes emissions of GHGs and SO2 in the 
four SRES macro-regions, followed by the description of 
"gridded" SOj emissions (distributed over a ГхГ grid) in 5.6.2. 
In this report represented by four macro-regions - OECD90, 
REF, ASIA, and A L M .

D i s t r i b u t i o n 
As Tables 5-13a to 5-13d clearly illustrate, the distribution of 
emissions over the four regions in the base year (1990) is very 
uneven. For example, while in industrialized regions (OECD90 
and REF) fossil and industrial COj emissions are dominant, in 
the developing regions (ASIA and ALM) 
the contribution of 
land-use emissions (deforestation) is also very important. In 
1990, 
developing regions produced much lower volumes of 
CO, and high-GWP gases than the industrialized world, while 
their relative share of NjO, 
CH4, and NO^, emissions was much 
more substantial (see Figures 5-13a to 5-13d).

As suggested by Figure 5-14, in all the SRES scenario famihes 
the share of industriaUzed regions (OECD90 and REF) in global 
total becomes progressively smaller and by 2100 these regions 
emit from 23% to 32% of the total (Table 5-14, Figure 5-14). 
In the OECD90 region, standardized fossil fuel and industrial 
CO2 
emissions in the A l B marker scenario (AlB-AIM) 
increase from 2.8 GtC in 1990 to 3.4 GtC in 2050, and 
subsequently decline to 2.2 GtC in 2100 (Figure 5-14). 
Compared to other scenarios, the growth in primary energy use 
in this region is relatively high, spuixed by rapid economic 
development (see also Chapter 4). However, after 2050 the 
increases in the use of primary energy are accompanied by 
declining emissions through the combination of a lower use of 
fossil fuels and a switch from coal to gas. The share of non-
fossil fuels in the OECD90 region of the A l B marker scenario 
also increases drastically. In 2100, the contribution of non-
fossil energy amounts to 68% of the total primary energy use 
of the OECD90 countries, the largest non-fossil fuel share for 
this region of all the SRES marker scenarios. 
The fossil fuel and industrial COj emission trajectory of the 
REF region is even less linear than in the OECD90 region. 
Initially, emissions decline from the base year level of 1.3 GtC 
to 1.1 GtC in 2020 because of economic restructuring. After 
2020, emissions increase, driven by an increased energy 
demand to support renewed economic growth (Figure 5-14). 
However, after 2050 emissions decline again primarily through 
a decrease in population and improved energy efficiency. By 
2100, 
non-fossil fuels in REF contribute 58% of the total 
primary energy use and the share of natural gas reaches almost 
40%. 
The energy and industry CO, emission growth in the ASIA 
region of the A l B marker scenario is very high, reflecting rapid 
economic growth and high energy demand. By 2100 the total 
primary energy use in this region exceeds the 1990 level more 
than 10 fold. Standardized COj emissions increase from 1.15 
GtC in 1990 to 5.73 GtC in 2050 and then drop to 5.27 GtC in 
2100 (Figure 5-14, Table 5-13c). By 2100 contributions from 
the two major energy sources, non-fossil fuels and natural gas, 
are 69% and 25%, respectively.

In the AIB marker scenario, the increase in energy demand in 
the A L M region is even higher than in the ASIA region. The 
primary energy use of 47 EJ in the base year increases to a level 
of 802 EJ in 2100, with 72% of energy from non-fossil sources. 
The emission path in this region is in line with trends observed 
in ASIA. Emissions grow from 0.72 GtC in 1990 to 5.72 GtC 
in 2050. After this peak they decline to 4.81 GtC in 2100 
(Figure 5-14, Tables 5-I3d). 
In the A2 marker 
scenario 
(A2-ASF), technological 
development is relatively slow and fossil fuels maintain their 
dominant position to supply the rapidly expanding population. 
By 2100, the contributions of coal to the total primary energy 
mix in the OECD90, R E F ASIA, and A L M regions are 52%, 
38%, 61%, and 48%, respectively, the largest shares across all 
the SRES marker scenarios. Relatively slow rates of 
technological improvements in the A2 scenai-io family result in 
the lowest contribution of non-fossil fuels compared to the 
other scenarios. In the A2 marker, COj emissions grow 
continuously in all SRES regions (except REF from 1990 to 
2020; Figure 5-14, Tables 5-13a-d). The fastest growth occurs 
in the ASIA and A L M regions as a result of the fast population 
growth in these regions. The contribution of COj emissions by 
ASIA increases from 19% to 38% of the global total, and that 
by A L M from 12% to 31%. 
The strong trend toward more ecologically compatible 
consumption and production in the В1 storyline is reflected by 
structural changes that lead to fewer energy- and material-
intensive activities and result in a relatively limited growth of 
energy requirements in the B l marker scenario (Bl-IMAGE). 
In all the regions the shift is away from fossil fuels. In 2100, 
non-fossil sources supply more than 50% of the global energy 
requirements, with regional shares ranging from 41% (REF) to 
64% (ASIA). Drastic changes in energy systems lead to an 
eventual decline in OECD90 emissions starting from 2020; this

staits from 2050 in other regions (Figure 5-14, Tables 5-13a-d). 
By 2100 emissions in all regions but A L M are smaller than 
they were in 1990. A decline in emissions is less pronounced in 
the developing regions - ASIA and A L M combine to produce 
around 70% of CO, emissions by in 2100. 
In the B2 world (illustrated by the B2-MESSAGE marker), the 
regions exploit comparative resource and technology 
advantages to structure their energy systems. Combined 
emissions in the OECD90 and REF regions remain more or less 
stable, changing from 4.1 GtC in 1990 to 4.3 GtC in 2100. The 
relative share of these two regions decreases from 69% in the 
base yeai- to 31% in 2100 (Figure 5-14, Tables 5-13a-d). In the 
B2 marker scenario, fossil fuel and industrial CO^ emissions in 
the OECD90 region increase to 3.71 GtC by 2020. Thereafter, 
emissions decline to 3.3 GtC in 2050 and to 3.1 GtC in 2100. 
This dynamic is caused by a decHne in the use of fossil fuels 
and by the replacement of oil with natural gas, as pressure on 
the oil resource base increases considerably after 2050. In the 
REF region, standardized fossil CO2 emissions decline to 0.8 
GtC in 2020, after which they retum to the 1990 level by 2100 
(1.2 GtC). Toward the end of the 2P' century, primary energy 
use in this region decreases while emissions increase because of 
a switch to coal (mainly to produce liquid substitutes for oil). In 
ASIA, both primary energy use and carbon emissions increase 
during the 2P' century. Although the use of non-fossil fuels 
becomes more important, the contribution of fossil fuels to 
emissions remains high. The use of coal, oil, and gas increases 
until 2050, after which tlie use of oil and gas decreases, while 
the use of coal grows rapidly. Population, energy use, and 
emissions in the A L M region constantly increase during the 21'" 
century. Again, the fossil fuels retain a dominant role and 
supply 47% of the energy requirements in 2100. Gas use 
increases until 2100, while the use of coal is rather stable until 
2050 and shows a rapid increase afterward. Oil use drops 
sharply after 2050 as resources become depleted.

L a n d - U s e C a r b o n D i o x i d e 
Emissions 
Changes in land use are influenced primarily by the demand 
for cropland and grassland (to supply plant and animal food to 
the world population) and by the role of biomass energy. The 
uncertainty of emission estimates is reflected in the models 
used to quantify the SRES scenarios - in 1990 they range 
between 1.0 and 1.6 GtC and the spread at the regional level is 
even larger. In all the SRES marker scenarios, most emissions 
related to land use originate from the ASIA and A L M regions 
(Tables 5-13a-d). In the industrialized regions, the land-use 
change emissions in 2100 vary from -0.40 to 4-0.04 GtC. In the 
developing regions emissions from land-use change span a 
larger range (from -0.56 to -1-0.35 GtC). 
5.6.1.3. 
T o t a l C a r b o n D i o x i d e 
Emissions 
Adding land-use C O , emissions to the energy- and industry-
related emissions does not make significant changes to the 
distribution of emissions across regions (Figures 5-14 and 5-
15). Table 5-14 provides an overview of the relative shares of 
the industrialized and developing regions within global COj 
emissions. On average, the SRES marker scenarios project a 
shift in relative contribution in both energy- and industry-
related and total COj emissions from the industrialized to 
developing regions. In general, the relative contribution of 
industrialized regions is the lowest in A l and the highest in 
B2. 
Shifts in the regional emission shares (Table 5-13a-d) result 
from different developments in regional emission trajectories. 
To illustrate this, the trajectories were normalized to the base 
year (1990 = 100 for each region) and are presented in Figure 
5-16. 
Figure 5-16 confirms that CO, emissions in the ASIA and 
A L M regions in all the SRES markers grow much faster than

in the industrialized regions. It also illustrates that the global 
pattern IS strongly influenced by the developing region 
trajectories. Furthermore, reflecting different development 
perspectives in the four SRES families, C O ^ emissions grow 
differently in ASIA and A L M . In the A I B marker, emission 
trajectories in A L M and ASIA are roughly parallel over the 
entire time horizon. In the В1 marker, this is only true in the 
earlier years. As the emission of A L M peaks and then declines 
later than that of ASIA, emission trajectories diverge strongly 
in the second half of the 2P' century. In the A2 marker, 
emissions in A L M start to grow at a lower rate than in ASIA, 
but subsequently catch up and later the two are again fairly 
close. Finally, in the B2 marker, A L M emissions initially grow 
at a modest rate, close to those for the OECD90 region and the 
world average. In later years, the growth in A L M exceeds the 
global rate, but total carbon emissions remain far below those 
in the ASIA region (Figures 5-15, 5-16). 
5.6.1.4. 
M e t h a n e 
The resultant CH^ emission trajectories in the four SRES 
markers are displayed in Figure 5-17. By 2020, regional 
differences between the four markers are minimal. In 2050, the 
largest difference is the relative share of the REF region in the 
A2 marker, attributable primarily to an increased coal and gas 
production in this region. By 2100, the A2 marker has the 
largest CH^ emissions in all the regions as compared to the 
other markers (Tables I3a-d, Figure 5-17). This arises from the 
"heterogeneous" nature of the A2 storyline, in which each 
region has to rely primarily on its own resources and progress 
in the renewable energy sector is quite limited. The second 
highest methane emissions are attained in the B2 marker, 
which also has a "regional" orientation, but with a more 
environmentally sustainable emphasis as compared to the A2 
marker. Starting from 2100, both A I B and B l markers have 
notably lower CH^ emissions in all the regions in comparison 
with the A2 and B2 markers (Figure 5-17). The regional 
emission allocation changes considerably from 1990 to 2100; 
all four markers project much greater percentages of emissions 
in the developing regions (ASIA and ALM).

N i t r o u s O x i d e 
The relative shares of the OECD90, REF, ASIA, and A L M 
regions in the base year NjO emissions are 39%, 9%. 34%, and 
18%, respectively (Figure 5-18). The OECD90 emissions 
remain quite stable over the 2F' century in all the markers, 
except A2 in which emissions increase from 2.6 MtN in 1990 
to almost 4 MtN in 2100. Emissions in the ASIA and REF 
regions increase in the A2 marker, decline in the В1 marker 
(after an initial increase in ASIA), and do not change 
significantly in the A I and B2 markers. Finally, the A L M NjO 
emissions grow quickly in the A2 marker and remain relatively 
flat in the other markers. The relatively small changes in the

NjO emissions across regions and scenarios are explained, in 
part, by a limited capacity of the SRES models to capture 
drastic shifts in technologies and practices (e.g., new catalytic 
converters or new manure management systems) that directly 
impact emission levels. 
in ASIA and A L M are increasing at much higher rates. The
continued growth of the production and use of halocarbons and 
other halogenated compounds in the developing regions after 
2020 makes them primary eminers of these substances in all 
the markers, except the B l marker, in 2100 (Figure 5-19).

The A l B marker has the largest emissions in all the regions in

features (e.g., increased recycling and "dematerialization").

5.6.1.7. 
Sulfur 
As noted in Section 5.5.2.1, even with a comparatively good 
agreement on global sulfur emission levels, important 
uncertainties remain at the sectoral and regional levels. The 
base-year uncertainties are especially important because 
regional sulfur emissions trends have changed drastically 
during the past decade. While declining strongly in the 
industrialized regions as a result of sulfur control policies in 
Europe and North America, and because of economic reforms 
in Russia and Eastem Europe, emissions increase rapidly in 
Asia with an increase in the energy demand and coal use. 
As a general rule, in the SRES scenarios an increasing 
affluence causes energy use per capita to rise and leads to the 
substhution of solid fuels, such as coal and fuelwood, with 
energy forms of higher quality. This relationship determines 
the sulfur emission dynamics across the SRES markers and 
regions (Figure 5-20).

Box 5-5: Gridding of Emission Data 
The cHmate effects of SO^ are intrinsically regional and emissions on a latitude-longitude grid are required as input to climate 
models. Emissions of SOj were first standardized for four world regions as described above. Then, emissions from the marker 
scenarios for six regions (OECD90, REF, Centrally Planned Asia, Rest of Asia, Latin America, and Africa/Middle East, scaled 
to match the standardized emissions) were used for gridding purposes. For the Aimex П countries, a value of 23 MtS was taken 
for 1990 emissions, a figure derived from a compilafion of country-level emissions inventories (Smith et al., 2000). 
These emissions were mapped to a global 1° x 1° emissions grid. For each region, the pattern of total SO^ emissions from the 
EDGAR database (Olivier et ai, 1996) was scaled by the total emissions for that region and a time period. Emissions for 
OECD90 countries were first scaled individually to their country-specific values. The value of 3 MtS was added to reflect 
intemational shipping, with the pattern and magnitude of these emissions held constant. 
Emissions of other short-lived gases (CO, N0^^, 
NMVOCs, and CH^) also needed to be mapped to a global grid for use in 
atmospheric chemistry models. The approach taken was essentially the same, with the EDGAR database used to establish the 
spatial pattern. Standardization and subsequent gridding were carried out at the level of the origmal four world regions, and no 
specific adjustments were made for intemational shipping. 
In "high income regions" (OECD90, REF) sulfur emissions 
have already passed their peaks and are actually declining at 
present. This trend is expected to continue in all the markers, 
except A2 in which an increased use of coal "counters" a 
decline in specific emissions in OECD90 (Figure 5-20). 
Emissions in ASIA grow in all the markers by 2020, and then 
decline by 2050, and further decline by 2100. The most 
dramatic decline is registered in the AIB marker; this is related 
to its aggressive assumptions on the introduction of low-sulfur 
technologies and fuel switching in the ASIA region (see Box 5-
3 for more details). Unlike ASIA, the A L M 
region sees 
increases in emissions in all four markers from 2020 to 2050, 
because of the somewhat "mixed" nature of this region, which 
combines countries with substantially different affluence levels 
and development trends. However, by 2100, when low-sulfur 
technology becomes widely available everywhere, emissions in 
the A L M decline in all markers (Figure 5-20). 
5.6.2. 
Gridded 
Sulfur 
Emissions 
As discussed above, global sulfur emissions eventually decline 
in all SRES 
scenario families and associated groups. In 
addition, the regional distribution of emissions changes 
drastically over time. While in previous decades major sulfur 
emitters were located primarily in industrialized regions of the 
world, presently emissions for these sources are declining 
because of the introduction of cleaner fuels and the conversion 
to low-sulfur technologies to comply with environmental 
regulations. In the majority of SRES scenarios, this trend is 
expected to continue. Meanwhile, less-developed regions are 
anticipated to experience strong economic growth associated 
with an increased demand for energy. Especially in the short 
term, fossil fuels are likely to satisfy the major share of this 
new demand, which may lead to a steep initial growth in sulfur 
emissions. As mentioned eariier (see Section 5.5.2), at some 
point in time sulfur emissions will be controlled in all the 
scenarios and, together with shifts to essentially sulfur-free 
energy resources, they will decrease in the developing regions 
as they are decreasing now in the industrialized world. As a 
consequence of these complex dynamics, different countries 
and regions are bound to experience very different levels of 
sulfur emissions over the 2P' century. To illustrate this. Figure 
5-21 shows gridded sulfur emissions in 1990 and 2050 in the 
AIB marker (see Box 5-5).

Introduction and Baclcground 
The set of 40 emissions scenarios in this Special Report on 
Emissions Scenarios (SRES) is based on an extensive 
assessment of the literature, six alternative modeling 
approaches, and an "open process" that solicited wide 
participation and feedback from many groups and individuals. 
The set of scenarios includes all relevant species of greenhouse 
gases (GHGs)^. This chapter provides a summary of the SRES 
emissions scenarios and compares them with the previous set 
of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) IS92 
scenarios and the underlying literature. 
The first step in the formulation of the scenarios was the review 
and analysis of the published literature and the development of 
the database with more than 400 emissions scenarios 
(accessible on the web site, www-cger.nies.go.jp/ cger-
e/db/ipcc.html). One of the recommendations of the writing 
team is that IPCC or a similar intemational institution should 
maintain such a database to ensure continuity of knowledge 
and scientific progress in any future assessments of GHG 
scenarios. An equivalent database to document narrative and 
other quaUtative scenarios would also be very useful for future 
climate-change assessments. One difficulty encountered in the 
analysis of the emissions scenarios is that the distinction 
between climate policy scenarios, non-climate policy 
scenarios, and other scenarios appeared to be to a degree 
arbitrary and was often impossible to make. Therefore, the 
writing team recommends that an effort should be made in the 
future 
to develop an appropriate 
emissions scenario 
classification scheme. Chapters 2 and 3 give a more detailed 
description of the very wide range of future emissions paths, 
their driving forces, and their relationships as reflected in the 
literature; the wide rage indicates that their possible 
developments are highly uncertain. The sources of inherent 
uncertainties range from data and modeling uncertainties 
through to inadequate 
scientific understanding of the 
underlying problems. 
Scenarios are appropriate tools for dealing with such 
uncertainty. Scenarios are images of the future, or altemative 
futures. As an integration tool in the assessment of climate 
change they allow a role for intuition, analysis, and synthesis; 
thus we tum to scenarios in this report to take advantage of 
these features to aid the assessment of future climate change, 
impacts, vulnerabilities, adoption, and mitigation. Scenarios 
are not predictions. A set of scenarios can assist in the 
understanding of possible future developments, and hence the 
development of a set of altemative scenarios (see Chapters 1 
and 4 for more detail). 
' Included are anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide (CO^), 
methane (CH^), nitrous oxide (NjO), hydrofluorcarbons (HFCs), 
perfluorocarbons 
(PFCs), 
sulfur 
hexafluoride 
(SFg), 
hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), 
sulfur dioxide (80^), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NO,,), 
and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs). 
The SRES approach involved the development of a set of four 
alternative scenario "families" that encompass the 40 
scenarios. Each family of SRES scenarios includes a 
descriptive part called a "storyline," and a number of 
altemative interpretations and quantifications of each storyline 
developed by six different modeling approaches. A l l the 
interpretations and quantifications of one storyline together are 
called a scenario family (see Chapter 1 for terminology). Each 
storyline describes a demographic, 
social, economic, 
technological, and policy future for one of these scenario 
families. Within each family different scenarios explore 
variations of global and regional developments and their 
implications for GHG and sulfur emissions. Each of these 
scenarios is consistent with the broad framework of that 
scenario family as specified by the storyline. Chapters 4 and 5 
give a more detailed description of the storylines, their 
quantifications, and the resultant 40 emissions scenarios. 
The SRES writing team reached a broad consensus that there 
could be no "best guess" scenarios; that the future is inherentiy 
unpredictable and that views will differ as to which storylines 
could be more likely. There is no "business-as-usual" scenario. 
The storylines represent the playing out of certain social, 
economic, technological and environmental paradigms that will 
be viewed positively by some people and negatively by others. 
The writing team decided on four storylines - an even number 
helps to avoid the impression that there is a "central" or "most 
likely" case. The team wanted more than two storylines to help 
illustrate that the future depends on many different underlying 
dynamics, but no more than four, as they wanted to avoid 
compficating the process with too many altematives. The 
scenarios cover a wide range, but not all possible futures. In 
particular, it was decided that possible "surprises" would not be 
considered and that there would be no "disaster" scenarios. 
The storylines describe developments in many different social, 
economic, 
technological, 
environmental, 
and 
policy 
dimensions. The tities of the storylines have been kept simple 
- A l , A2, B l , and B2. There is no particular order among the 
storylines, which are listed in Box 6-1 in alphabetic order. The 
team decided to carry out sensitivity tests within some of the 
storylines by considering altemative scenarios with different 
fossil-fuel reserves, rates of economic growth, or rates of 
technological change within a given scenario family. 
All four storylines and scenario families describe future worlds 
that are generally more affluent compared to the current 
situation. They range from very rapid economic growth and 
technological change to high levels of environmental 
protection, from low to high global populations, and from high 
to low GHG emissions. What is perhaps even more important 
is that all the storylines describe dynamic changes and 
transitions in generally different directions. Although they do 
not include additional climate initiatives, none of them are 
policy free. As time progresses, the storylines diverge from 
each other in many of their characteristic features. In this way 
they span the relevant range of GHG emissions and different 
combinations of their main sources.

Box 6-1: The Main Characteristics of the Four SRES Storylines and Scenario Families. 
By 2100 the world will have changed in ways that are hard to imagine - as hard as it would have been at the end of the 19th 
century to imagine the changes of the 100 years since. Each storyline assumes a distinctly different direction for future 
developments, such that the four storylines differ in increasingly irreversible ways. Together they describe divergent futures that 
encompass a significant portion of the underlying uncertamties in the main driving forces. They cover a wide range of key 
"future" characteristics such as population growth, economic development, and technological change. For this reason, their 
plausibility or feasibiUty should not be considered solely on the basis of an extrapolation of c u r r e n t economic, technological, 
and social trends. 
• 
The A l storylme and scenario family describes a future world of very rapid economic growth, low population growth, and 
the rapid introduction of new and more efficient technologies. Major underlymg themes are convergence among regions, 
capacity buildmg and increased cultural and social interactions, with a substantial reduction in regional differences in per 
capita income. The A l scenario family develops into four groups that describe altemative dnections of technological 
change in the energy system. Please note that m the Summary for Policymakers, two of these groups were merged into 
one? 
• 
The A2 storyline and scenario family describes a very heterogeneous world. The underlying theme is self-reliance and 
preservation of local identities. Fertility pattems across regions converge very slowly, which results in high population 
growth. Economic development is primarily regionally oriented and per capita econontic growth and technological change 
are more fragmented and slower than in other storylines. 
• 
The B l storyline and scenario family describes a convergent world with the same low population growth as in the A l 
storylme, but with rapid changes in economic stmcUares toward a service and information economy, with reductions in 
material intensity, and the mtroduction of clean and resource-efficient technologies. The emphasis is on global solutions 
to economic, social, and envkonmental sustainability, including improved equity, but without additional climate 
initiatives. 
• 
The B2 storyline and scenario family describes a world in which the emphasis is on local solutions to economic, social, 
and environmental sustainability. It is a world with moderate population growth, intermediate levels of economic 
development, and less rapid and more diverse technological change than in the В1 and A l storylines. While the scenario 
is also oriented toward environmental protection and social equity, it focuses on local and regional levels. 
After determining the basic features and driving forces for each of the four storylines, the team began modeling and quantifying 
the storyUnes. This resulted in 40 scenarios, each of which constitutes an alteinative hlteфretation and quantification of a 
storyfine. All the hiterpretations and quantifications associated with a single storyline are called a scenario "family" (see Chapter 
1 for terminology and Chapter 4 for further details). 
After detennining the basic features and driving forces for each 
of the four storylines, the team quantified the storylines into 
individual scenarios with the help of formal (computer) 
models. The six modeling groups that quantified the storylines 
are listed in Box 6-2. The six models are representative of 
different approaches to modeling emissions scenarios and 
different integrated assessment (lA) frameworks in the 
literature and include so-called top-down and bottom-up 
models. The writing team recommends that IPCC or a similar 
international institution should ensure participation of

A I G groups into one "fossil intensive" group A l F I in contrast to the 
non-fossil group AIT, and select two illustrative scenarios from these 
two A l groups to facilitate use by modelers and poHcy makers. This 
leads to six scenario groups that constitute the four scenario families, 
three of which are in the A l family. The six groups all have " 
illustrative scenarios", four of which are marker scenarios. All 
scenarios are equally sound. See also Figure SPM-1. 
modeling groups around the world, and especially those from 
developing countries, in future scenario development and 
assessment efforts. Clearly, this would also require resources 
specifically to assist modeling groups from developing 
countries. Indeed, a concerted effort was made to engage 
modeling groups and experts from developing countries in 
SRES as a direct response to recommendations of the IPCC 
scenario evaluation (Alcamo et a l . , 1995). 
The six models have different regional aggregations. The 
writing team decided to group the various global regions into 
four "macro-regions" common to all different regional 
aggregations across the six models. The four macro-regions 
(see Appendix III) are broadly consistent with the allocation of 
countries in the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate 
Change 
(UNFCCC, 
1997) 
although 
the 
correspondence is not exact because of changes in the 
countries fisted in Annex I of UNFCCC. 
All the qualitative and quanthative features of scenarios that 
belong to the same family were set to conform to the 
corresponding features of the underlying storyline. Together,

Box 6-2: SRES Modeling Teams 
In all, six models were used to generate the 40 scenarios: 
• 
Asian Pacific Integrated Model (AIM) from the National Institute of Environmental Studies in Japan (Morita et a l . , 1994); 
• 
Atmospheric Stabilization Framework Model (ASF) from ICF Consulting in the USA (Lashof and Tirpak, 1990; Pepper 
et a i , 1992, 1998; Sankovski et a l . , 2000); 
• 
Integrated Model to Assess the Greenhouse Effect (IMAGE) from the National Institute for Public Health and 
Environmental Hygiene (RIVM) (Alcamo et a i , 1998; de Vries et a l . , 1994, 1999, 2000), used in connection with the 
Dutch Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis (СРВ) 
WorldScan model (de Jong and Zalm, 1991), the Netherlands; 
• 
Multiregional Approach for Resource and Industry Allocation (MARIA) from the Science University of Tokyo in Japan 
(Mori and Takahashi, 1999; Mori, 2000); 
• 
Model for Energy Supply Strategy Alternatives and their General Environmental Impact (MESSAGE) from the 
Intemational Institute of Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in Austria (Messner and Stmbegger, 1995; Riahi and Roehrl, 
2000); and the 
• 
Mini Climate Assessment Model (MiniCAM) from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in the USA 
(Edmonds e t a l . , 1994, 1996a, 1996b). 
For a more detailed description of the modeling approaches see Appendix IV. 
26 scenarios were "harmonized" to share agreed common 
assumptions about population and gross domestic product 
(GDP) 
developments (a few that also share common final 
energy trajectories are called "fully harmonized," see Section 
4.1. in Chapter 4). Thus, the harmonized scenarios are not 
independent of each other within each family, but they are 
independent across the four families. However, scenarios 
within each family vary quite substantially in characteristics 
such as the assumptions about availability of fossil-fuel 
resources, the rate of energy-efficiency improvements, the 
extent of renewable-energy development, and, hence, the 
resultant GHG emissions. Thus, after the modeling teams had 
quantified the key driving forces and made an effort to 
harmonize them with the storylines by adjusting control 
parameters, there still remained diversity in the assumptions 
about the driving forces and in the resultant emissions (see 
Chapter 4). 
The remaining 14 scenarios adopted altemative interpretations 
of the four scenario storylines to explore additional scenario 
uncertainties beyond differences in méthodologie approaches, 
such as different rates of economic growth and variations in 
population projections. These variations reflect the "modeling 
teams' choice" of alternative but plausible global and regional 
developments compared to those of the "harmonized" 
scenarios; they also stem from the differences in the underlying 
modeling approaches. This approach generated a large 
variation and richness in different scenario quantifications, 
often with overlapping ranges of main driving forces and 
GHG 
emissions across the four families. 
In addition, the A l scenario family branched out into different 
distinct scenario groups, based on altemative technological 
developments in future energy systems, from carbon-intensive 
development to decarbonization. Similar- storyline variations 
were considered for other scenario families, but they did not 
result in genuine scenario groupings within the respective 
families. However, if future energy systems variations were 
applied fully to other storylines, they may evolve differently 
from those in A l . They have been introduced into the A l 
storyline because of its "high growth with high technology" 
nature, for which differences in alternative technology 
developments translate into large differences in future G H G 
emission levels. The A1 groups further increased the richness 
in different GHG and SO^ emissions paths. Indeed, this 
variation in the structure of future energy systems in itself 
resulted in a range of emissions almost as large as that 
generated through the variation of other main driving forces, 
such as population and economic development. Altogether the 
40 SRES scenarios fall into seven groups: the three scenario 
families A2, B l , and B2, plus four groups within the A l 
scenario (see footnote 2). 
As in the case of the storylines, no single scenario - whether it 
represents a modeler's choice or harmonized assumptions -
was treated as being more or less "probable" than others 
belonging to the same family. However, one preliminary 
harmonized scenario from each family, referred to as a 
"marker," was used in 1998 to solicit comments during the 
"open process" and as input for climate modelers in 
accordance with a decision of the IPCC Bureau. The four 
marker scenarios were posted on the IPCC web site 
(sres.ciesin.org) in June 1998, and the open scenario review 
process through the IPCC web site lasted until January 1999. 
The choice of markers was based on extensive discussion of: 
• 
Range of emissions across all of marker scenarios. 
• 
Which of the initial quantifications (by the modelers) 
reflected the storyline. 
• 
Preference of some of the modeling teams and features 
of specific models. 
• 
Use of different models for the four markers. 
2 9 8 
S u m m a i j D i s c u s s i o n s a n d R e c o m m e n d a t i o n s 
Markers were not intended to be the median or mean scenarios 
from their respective families. Indeed, in general it proved 
impossible to develop scenarios in which all relevant 
characteristics matched mean or median values. Thus, marker 
scenarios are no more or less likely than any other scenarios, 
but are those scenarios considered by the SRES writing team as 
illustrative of a particular storyline. These scenarios have 
received much closer scrutiny, not only from the entire writing 
team, but also via the SRES open process, than other scenario 
quantifications. The marker scenarios are also the SRES 
scenarios that have been most intensively tested in terms of 
reproducibility. As a rule, different modeling teams have 
attempted to replicate the model quantification of marker 
scenarios. Available time and resources have not allowed a 
similar exercise to be conducted for all SRES scenarios, 
although some effort was devoted to reproduce the scenario 
groups that constitute different interpretations of the A I 
storyline with different models. 
Additional scenarios using the same harmonized assumptions 
as the marker scenarios developed by different modeling teams 
and 
other scenarios that give alternative quantitative 
interpretations of the four storylines constitute the final set of 
40 SRES scenarios. 
However, differences in modeling 
approaches mean that not all the scenarios provide estimates 
for all the direct and indirect GHG emissions for all the sources 
and sectors. The four SRES marker scenarios cover аИ the 
relevant gas species and emission categories comprehensively 
and thus constitute the smallest set of independent and fully 
documented SRES scenarios. 
The scenario groups and cumulative emissions categories were 
developed as the smallest subsets of SRES scenarios that 
capture the range of uncertainties associated with driving 
forces and emissions. Together, the scenario groups constitute 
the set of SRES scenarios that reflects the uncertainty ranges in 
the emissions and their driving forces. Furthermore, the writing 
team recommends that, to the extent possible, these scenarios, 
but at least the four markers, be used to capture the range of 
uncertainties of driving forces and in addition, the two 
additional illustrative scenarios in A l be used to capture the 
range of GHG emissions, and these should always be used 
together, and that no individual scenario s h o u l d be singled out 
for any purpose. Multiple baselines and overlapping emissions 
ranges have important implications for making policy analysis 
(e.g., similar policies might have different impacts in different 
scenarios). Combinations of policies might shape the future 
development in the direction of certain scenarios. Box 6-4 (see 
later) summarizes the recommendations of the writing team for 
consideration by the user communities within and outside the 
IPCC. 
Thus, there are three different types of scenarios within each 
family - one marker (and two illustrative scenarios in the A l 
family), a set of harmonized scenarios, and a set of other (non-
harmonized) scenarios. In addition, the A l family of scenarios 
is 
subdivided into 
groups 
that 
describe 
alternative 
technological developments in the energy system. Together 
with the other three scenario families the SRES scenarios build 
seven distinct scenario groups (see footnote 2). Figure 
6-1 illustrates this scenario terminology schematically. The

Figure 6-1; Schematic illustration of SRES scenarios. The set of scenarios consists of the four scenario families A l , A2, B l , and 
B2. Each family consists of a number of scenarios, some of which have "harmonized" driving forces and share the same 
prespecified population and gross world product (a few that also share common final energy trajectories are called "fully 
harmonized"). These are marked as "HS" for harmonized scenarios. One of the harmonized scenarios, originally posted on the 
open-process web site, is called a "marker scenario." All other scenarios of the same family based on the quantification of the 
storyline chosen by the modeling team are marked as "OS." Six modeling groups developed the set of 40 emissions scenarios. 
The GHG and SO, emissions of the scenarios were standardized to share the same data for 1990 and 2000 on request of the user 
communities. The time-dependent standardized emissions were also translated into geographic distributions. See also footnote 2. 
Summary 
D i s c u s s i o n s a n d 
Recommendations 
2 9 9 
detailed descriptions of inputs and outputs (other than GHG 
emissions) of the SRES marker scenarios, other harmonized 
scenarios, and all other scenarios are presented in Chapter 4 
and the Appendices, while the emissions of GHGs and other 
radiatively important species of gases are described in Chapter 
5 and Appendices. 
The writing team considers that the SRES scenario set (in all 
the richness of scenario families, groups, markers, and 
illustrative and harmonized scenarios) is based on a "neutral" 
choice of scenario drivers; no driver is unduly emphasized as 
being more important than others. The scenarios do not suggest 
that future population growth alone is t h e driver of future 
emissions, nor do they suggest that technological change a l o n e 
in any one sector could drive future emissions in one way or the 
other. While recognizing the importance of any of these driving 
forces per se, this report illustrates the critical role of 
relationships and interdependencies between scenario driving 
forces. To an extent it is the nature of these relationships that 
drives the future more than the possible evolution of any 
individual driving forces by itself. In other words, the 
uncertainty of the future is not simply parametric, but deeply 
functional; uncertainties and incomplete understanding exist 
for both. Qualitative scenario storylines add transparency and 
consistency to the relationships assumed in any particular 
scenario. The storylines also allow for additional interpretation 
of scenario results by different user communities. 
6.2. 
Scenario Driving Forces 
The scenarios cover a wide range of driving forces, from 
demographic to social and economic developments. This 
section summarizes the assumptions on impoitant scenario 
drivers. For simplicity, only three important driving forces are 
presented separately following the exposition in Chapters 2, 3, 
and 4. Nonetheless, it is important to keep in mind that the 
future evolution of these and other main driving forces is 
interrelated in the SRES scenarios (see Table 6.2a for a 
summary of the ranges of the main driving forces across the 
scenario groups in 2020, 2050, and 2100). 
The SRES scenarios span a wide range of assumptions for the 
most salient scenario drivers, and thus reflect the uncertainty of 
the future. Evidently, views of the future are a time-specific 
phenomenon, and this report and its scenarios are no exception. 
However, it is important to emphasize that this is an explicit 
part of the Terms of Reference for the SRES writing team - to 
reflect a range of views, based on current knowledge and the 
most recenfly available literature (see Appendix I). The 
scenario quantification results reflect well the literature range, 
except for extreme scenarios. 
6.2.1. 
Population 
Projections 
Three different population trajectories were chosen for SRES 
scenarios to reflect future demographic uncertainties based on 
published population projections (Lutz, 1996; UN, 1998; see 
Chapter 3). The population projections are exogenous input to 
all the models used to develop the SRES scenarios. The models 
used do not develop population from other assumptions within 
the model. Figure 6-2 shows the three population projections in 
comparison with the three population projections used in the 
IS92 scenarios. Global population ranges between 7 and 15 
billion people by 2100 across the scenarios, depending on the 
rate and extent of the demographic transition. The insert in 
Figure 6.2 shows population development in the industrialized 
(i.e., developed) regions. The range of future populations is 
smaller than in the IS92 scenarios, particularly in the 
industrialized regions, for which the lowest scenario indicates 
a very modest population decline compared to IS92 scenarios. 
The 
greatest uncertainty about future growth lies in the 
developing regions across all scenarios in the literature. An 
equally pervasive trend across all scenarios is urbanization (see 
Chapter 3). Altogether three different population projections 
were used in the 26 harmonized scenarios. Other scenarios 
explored altemative population projections consistent with the 
storylines. 
The lowest population trajectory is assumed for the A l and B l 
scenario families and is based on the low population projection 
in Lutz (1996), which combines low fertility with low 
mortality and central migration rate assumptions. After 
peaking at 8.7 bilHon in the middle of the 2P' century, world 
population declines to 7.1 billion by the year 2100. As 
discussed in Chapters 3 and 4, this population development is 
somewhat higher than the previous low population used in the 
IS92 scenarios. The B2 scenario family is based on the U N 
median 1998 population projection (UN, 1998). The global 
population increases to about 9.4 billion people by 2050 and to 
about 10.4 billion by 2100. This population scenario is 
characteristic of recent median global population projections, 
which describe a continuation of historical trends towards a 
completion of the demographic transition that would lead to a 
level global population, and is consistent with recent faster 
fertility declines in the world together with declining mortality 
rates. Hence, the population is somewhat lower than previous 
U N median projections, as used in the IS92 scenarios. This 
median scenario projects very low population growth in 
today's industrialized countries, with stabilization of growth in 
Asia in the second half of the 2P' century and in the rest of the 
world towards the end of the 2P' century. The A2 scenario 
family is based on the high population growth of 15 billion by 
2100 reported in Lutz (1996), which assumes a significant 
decline in fertility for most regions and a stabilization at above 
replacement levels. It falls below the long-term 1998 UN high 
projection of 18 billion. It is also lower than in the highest IS92 
scenario (17.6 billion by 2100). Nevertheless, this scenario 
represents very high population growth compared with that in 
current demographic literature. Demographers attach a 
probability of more than 90% that actual population will be 
lower than the trajectory adopted in the A2 scenario family 
(Lutz et a l . , 1997). A more detailed discussion of the 
population projections used to quantify the four scenario 
families is given in Chapters 3 and 4.

6.2.2. 
Economie 
Development 
The 
SRES scénarios span a wide range of future levels of 
economic activity (expressed in gross world product). The A l 
scenario family with a ("hannonized") gross world product of 
US$529 trillion (all values in 1990 US dollars unless otherwise 
indicated) in 2100 delineates the SRES upper bound, whereas 
B2 with ("harmonized") US$235 trillion in 2100 represents its 
lower bound. The range of gross world product across all 
scenarios is even higher, from US$197 to US$550 by 2100. 
Although the SRES scenarios span a wide range, still lower 
and higher gross world product levels can be found in the 
literature (see Chapters 2, 3, and 4). Uncertainties in future 
gross world product levels are governed by the pace of future 
productivity growth and population growth, especially in 
developing regions. Different assumptions on conditions and 
possibilities for development "catch-up" and for narrowing per 
capita income gaps in particular explain the wide range in 
projected future gross world product levels. Given a 
qualitatively negative relationship between population growth 
and per capita income growth discussed in Chapters 2 and 3, 
uncertainties in future population growth rates tend to narrow 
the range of associated gross world product projections. High 
population growth would, c e t e r i s p a r i b u s , lower per capita 
income growth, whereas low population growth would tend to 
increase it. This relationship is evident in empiric data - high 
per capita income countries are generally also those that have 
completed then demographic transition. The affluent live long 
and generally have few children. (Exceptions are some 
countries with small populations, high birth rates, and 
significant income from commodity exports.) This relationship 
between affluence and longevity again identities development 
as one of the most important indicators of human well being. 
Yet even assuming this relationship holds for an extended time 
into the future, its quantification is subject to considerable 
theoretic and empiric uncertainties (Alcamo et a l . , 1995). 
Two of the SRES scenario families, A l and B l , explicitly 
explore alternative pathways to gradually close existing 
income gaps. As a reflection of uncertainty, development 
"catch-up" diverges in terms of geographically distinct 
economic growth patterns across the four SRES scenario 
families. Table 6-1 summarizes per capita income for SRES 
and IS92 scenarios for the four SRES world regions. SRES 
scenarios indicate a smaller difference between the now 
industrialized and developing countries compared with the 
IS92 scenarios. This tendency toward a substantially narrower 
income "gap" compared with the IS92 scenarios overcomes 
one of the major shortcomings of the previous IPCC scenarios 
cited in the literature (Parikli, 1992). 
6.2.3. 
S t r u c t u r a l and Technological 
Change 
In this brief summary of the SRES scenarios, structural and 
technological changes are illustrated by using energy and land 
use as examples. These examples are characteristic for the 
driving forces of emissions because the energy system and land 
use are the major sources of GHG and sulfur emission. 
Chapter 4 gives a more detailed treatment of the full range of 
emissions driving forces across the SRES scenarios.

Figure 6-3 illustrates that the change of world primary energy 
stmcture diverges over time. It shows the contributions of 
individual primary energy sources - the percentage supplied by 
coal, that by oil and gas, and that by all non-fossil sources taken 
together (for simplicity of presentation and because not all 
models distinguish between renewables and nuclear energy). 
Each comer of the triangle corresponds to a hypothetical 
situation in which all primary energy is supplied by a single 
source - oil and gas, coal at the left, and non-fossil sources 
(renewables and nuclear) to the right. Historically, the primary 
energy structure has evolved clockwise according to the two 
"grand transitions" (discussed in Chapter 3) that are shown by 
the two segments of the "thick black" curve. From 1850 to 
1920 the first transition can be characterized as the substitution 
of traditional (non-fossil) energy sources by coal. The share of 
coal increased from 20% to about 70%, while the share of non-
fossils declined from 80% to about 20%. The second transition, 
from 1920 to 1990, can be characterized as the replacement of 
coal by oil and gas (while the share of non-fossils remained 
essentially constant). The share of oil and gas increased to 
about 50% and the share of coal declined to about 30%. 
Figure 6-3 gives an overview of the divergent evolution of 
global primary energy structures between 1990 and 2100, 
regrouped into their respective scenario families and four A l 
scenarios 
groups that explore different technological 
developments in the energy systems. 
The SRES scenarios 
cover a wider range of energy stractures than the previous IS92 
scenario series, which reflects advances in knowledge on the 
uncertainty ranges of future fossil resource availability and 
technological change. 
In a clockwise direction, A l and ВI scenario groups map the 
structural transitions toward higher shares of non-fossil energy 
in the future, which almost closes the historical "loop" that 
started in 1850. The B2 scenarios indicate a more "moderate" 
direction of change with about half of the energy coming from 
non-fossil sources and the other half shared by coal on one 
side and oil and gas on the other. Finally, the A2 scenario 
group marks a stark transition back to coal. Shares of oil and 
gas decline while non-fossils increase moderately. What is 
perhaps more significant than the diverging developments in 
these three marker scenarios is that the whole set of 40 
scenarios covers virtually all possible directions of change, 
from high shares of oil and gas to high shares of coal and non-

the same range of structural change as all other scenarios

main structural change occurs between coal on the one hand 
and non-fossils on the other. This divergent nature in the 
structural change of the energy system and in the underlying

to forests and 40% to other categories (including 
grasslands) to the left, and 80% to other categories (including 
grasslands) to the right. 
In most scenarios, the current trend of shrinking forests is 
eventually reversed because of slower population growth and 
increased agricultural productivity. Reversals of deforestation 
trends are strongest in the В1 and A1 families. In the В1 family 
pasture lands decrease significantly because of increased 
productivity in livestock management and dietary shifts away 
from meat, thus illustrating the importance of both 
technological and social developments. 
The main driving forces for land-use changes are related to 
increasing demands for food because of a growing population 
and 
changing diets. In addition, numerous other social, 
economic, and institutional factors govem land-use changes 
such as deforestation, expansion of cropland areas, or their 
reconversion back to forest cover (see Chapter 3). Global food 
production can be increased, either through intensification (by 
multi-cropping, raising cropping intensity, applying fertilizers, 
new 
seeds, improved fanning technology) or through land 
expansion (cultivafing land, converting forests). Especially in 
developing countries, there are many examples of the potential 
to intensify food production in a more or less écologie way 
(e.g. multi-cropping; agroforestry) that may not lead to higher 
GHG emissions. 
Different assumptions on these processes translate into

characteristic of several models (e.g., AIM, IMAGE, MARIA, 
and MiniCAM) used in SRES is the explicit modeling of land-
use changes caused by expanding biomass uses and hence 
exploration of possible land-use conflicts between energy and 
agricultural sectors. The corresponding scenarios of land-use 
changes are illustrated in Figure 6-4 for all SRES scenarios. In 
some contrast to the structural changes in energy systems 
shown in Figure 6-3, different land-use scenarios in Figure 6-4 
appear to be rather model specific, following the general trends 
as indicated by the respective marker scenario developed with 
a particular model.

Greenhouse Gases and Sulfur Emissions 
The SRES scenarios generally cover the full range of GHG and 
sulfur emissions consistent with the storylines and the 
underlying range of driving forces from studies in the 
literature, as documented in the SRES database. This section 
summarizes the emissions of CO,, CH4, and SO,. For 
simplicity, only these three important gases are presented 
separately, following the more detailed exposition in Chapter 5 
(see Table 6.2b for a summary of the ranges of emissions 
across the scenario groups in 2020, 2050, and 2100).

Figure 6-5 illustrates the range of CO, emissions for the 40 
SRES scenarios against the background of all the emissions 
scenarios in the SRES scenario database shown in Figure 1-3. 
For simplicity, only energy-related and industrial sources of 
CO, emissions are shown. 
Figure 6-5 shows that the marker scenarios by themselves 
cover a large portion of the overall scenario distribution. This 
is one reason why the SRES writing team recommends the use 
of at least the four marker scenarios. Together, they cover a 
large range of future emissions, both with respect to the 
scenarios in the literature and the full SRES scenario set. 
The SRES scenarios cover rather evenly the range of future 
emissions found in the literature, from high to low levels over 
the whole time horizon. In contrast, the distribution for 
emissions by 2100 of scenarios in the literature is very 
asymmetric. It has a structure that resembles a tri-inodal 
frequency distribution - those showing emissions of more than 
30 gigatons of carbon (GtC; 20 scenarios), those with 
emissions between 12 and 30 GtC (88 scenarios), and those

the literature.

showing emissions of less than 12 GtC (82 scenarios). As 
discussed in Chapter 2, the lowest cluster appears to include 
many of the intervention scenarios; the second and third 
clusters aie most likely the non-intervention cases. The lowest 
cluster may have been influenced by many analyses of 
stabilizing atmospheric concentrations. The middle cluster 
echoes the many analyses that took IS92a as a reference and is 
testament to the enormous influence of the IS 92 series on 
emissions assessments in general. 
The range of CO, and other G H G emissions for the four 
marker scenarios is generally somewhat lower than that of the 
six 1S92 scenarios.^ However, the IS92 scenarios do not cover 
the "middle" range of emissions where the median and the 
average of all scenarios in the literature are situated. Adding 
the other 36 scenarios to the four SRES markers increases the 
covered emissions range beyond the IS92 series at the high end 
of the distribution but not at the low end. SRES scenarios stop 
short of the lower literature emissions because they are 
scenarios without additional climate initiatives (as per the 
Terms of References, see Appendix I). 
Figure 6-6 illustrates the range of CO2 emissions of the SRES 
scenarios against the background of all the IS92 scenarios and 
other emissions scenarios from the literature documented in the 
SRES scenario database. The shaded areas depict the range of 
the scenarios in the database that exceeds the SRES emissions 
range. The range of future emissions is very large so that the 
highest scenarios envisage more than a sevenfold increase of 
global emissions by 2100, while the lowest have emissions 
lower than today. 
The 
literature includes scenarios with additional climate 
initiatives and policies, which are also referred to as mitigation 
or intervention scenarios. As shown in Chapter 2, many 
ambiguities are associated with the classification of emissions 
scenarios into those that include additional climate initiatives 
and those that do not. Many cannot be classified in this way on 
basis of the information available from the SRES scenario 
database and the published literature. 
Figure 6-6a indicates the ranges of emissions from energy and 
industry in 2100 from scenarios that apparently include 
additional climate inifiatives (designated as intervenfion 
emissions range), those that do not (non-intervention), and 
those that cannot be assigned to either of these two categories 
(non-classified). This classificafion is based on the subjective 
evaluation of the scenarios in the database by the members of 
the writing team and is explained in Chapter 2. The range of the 
whole sample of scenarios has significant overlap with the 
range of those that caimot be classified and they shai-e virtually

range. Also, the range of the scenarios that apparenfly do not 
include climate polices (non-intervention) has considerable 
overlap with the other two ranges (lower bound is slightly 
higher), but with a significantly higher median (of 21.3 GtC in 
2100). 
The median of all energy and industry emissions scenarios 
from the literature is 15.7 GtC by 2100. This is lower than the 
median of the IS92 set and is lower than the IS92a scenario 
often (inappropriately) considered as the "central" scenario. 
Again, the distribution of emissions is asymmetric (see the 
emissions histogram in Figure 6-5) and the thin tail that 
extends above 30 GtC includes only a few scenarios. 
Figure 6-6 shows the range of emissions of the four families 
(verfical bars next to each of the four marker scenarios), which 
illustrate that the scenarios groups by themselves cover a large 
portion of the overall scenario distribution. Together, they 
cover much of the range of future etnissions, both with respect 
to the scenarios in the literature and all SRES scenarios. 
Adding all other scenarios increases the covered range. For 
example, the SRES scenarios span jointly from the 95"' 
percentile to just above the 5"' percentile of the distribution of 
energy and industry emissions scenarios from the literature. 
This illustrates again that they only exclude the most extreme 
emissions scenarios found in the literatme, which are situated 
out in the tails of the distribution. What is perhaps more 
important is that each of the four scenario families covers a 
substantial part of this distribution. This leads to a substantial 
overlap in the emissions ranges of the four scenario families. In 
other words, a similar quantification of driving forces can lead 
to a wide range of future emissions and a given level of future 
emissions can result from different combinations of driving 
forces. This result is of fundamental importance for the 
assessments of cfimate change impacts and possible mitigation 
and adaptation strategies. Thus, it warrants some further 
discussion. 
Another 1пГефге1а11оп is that a given combination of the main 
driving forces, such as population and economic growth, is not 
sufficient to determine the future emissions paths. Different 
modeling approaches and different specifications of other 
scenaiio assumptions overshadow the influence of the main 
driving forces. A particular combination of driving forces, such 
as specified in the A l scenario family, is associated with a 
whole range of possible emission paths for energy and 
industry. The nature of climate change impacts and adaptation 
and mitigation strategies would be fundamentally different 
depending on whether emissions are high or low, given a 
particular combination of scenario driving forces. Thus, the 
implication is that the whole range needs to be considered in 
the assessments of climate change, from high emissions and 
driving forces to low ones. 
The A l scenario family explored variations in energy systems 
most explicitly and hence covers the largest part of the scenario 
distribution shown in Figures 6-5 and 6-6a, from the 95* to just 
above the 10* percentile. The A l scenario family includes

different groups of scenarios tliat explore different structures of 
future energy systems, from carbon-intensive development 
paths to high rates of decarbonization. All groups otherwise 
share the same assumptions about the main driving forces (see 
Section 6.2.3 and, for further detail, Chapters 4 and 5). This 
indicates that different su-uctures of the energy system can lead 
to basically the same variation in future emissions as generated 
by different combinations of the other main driving forces -
population, economic activities, and energy consumption 
levels. The implication is that decarbonization of energy 
systems - the shift from carbon-intensive to less carbon-
intensive and carbon-free sources of energy - is of similar 
importance in determining the future emissions paths as other 
driving forces. Sustained decarbonization requires the 
development and successful diffusion of new technologies. 
Thus investments in new technologies during the coming 
decades might have the same order of influence on future 
emissions as population growth, economic development, and 
levels of energy consumption taken together. 
Figure 6-6b shows that C O ^ emissions from deforestation peak 
in 
many 
SRES 
scenarios 
after 
several decades and 
subsequently gradually decline. This pattem is consistent with 
many scenarios in the literature and can be associated with 
slowing population growth and increasing agricultural 
productivity. These allow a reversal of cuiTcnt deforestation 
trends, leading to eventual C O ^ sequestration. Emissions 
decline fastest in the B l family. Only in the A2 family do net 
anthropogenic CO2 emissions from land use remain positive 
thiough to 2100. As was the case for energy-related emissions, 
CO2 emissions related to land-use in the A l family cover the 
widest range. The range of land-use emissions across the IS92 
scenarios is narrower in comparison.

This comparison of some of the SRES scenario characteristics 
implies that similar future emissions can result from very 
different 
socio-economic 
developments, 
and 
similar 
developments of driving forces can result in different future 
emissions. Uncertainties in the future development of key 
emission driving forces create large uncertainties in future 
emissions, even within the same socio-economic development 
paths. Therefore, emissions from each scenario family overlap 
substantially with emissions from other scenario families. 
Figure 6-6 shows this for CO2 emissions. For example, 
comparison of the A l B and B2 marker scenarios indicates that 
they have similar emissions of about 13.5 and 13.7 GtC by 
2100, 
respectively. The dynamics of the paths, however, are 
different so that they have different cumulative C O ^ emissions 
and different emissions of other GHG gases and SOj. 
To facilitate comparisons of emissions and their driving forces 
across the scenarios, the writing team grouped them into four 
categories of cumulative emissions between 1990 and 2100. 
However, any categorization of scenarios based on emissions 
of multiple gases is quite difficult. Figure 6-7 shows total C O j 
emissions from all sources (from Figures 6-6a and b). Most of 
the scenarios are shown aggregated into seven groups, the four 
A l groups and the other three families. The scenarios that 
remain outside the seven groups 
adopted 
alternative 
inteфretations of the four scenario storylines. The emission 
trajectories ("bands") of the seven groups display different 
dynamics, from monotonie increases to non-linear trajectories 
in which there is a subsequent decline from a maximum. The 
dynamics of the individual scenarios are also different across 
gasses, sectors, or world regions. This particularly diminishes 
the significance of focusing scenario categorization on any 
given year, such as 2100. In addition, all gases that contribute 
to radiative forcing should be considered, but methods of 
combining gases such as the use of global warming potentials 
(GWP) 
are appropriate only for neai-term GHG inventories.* 
In light of these difficulties, the classification approach 
presented here uses cumulative COj emissions between 1990 
and 2100. CO2 is the dominant G H G and cumulative CO2 
emissions are expected to be roughly proportional to CO2 
radiative forcing over the time scale of a century. According to 
the IPCC SAR, "any eventual stabilised concentration is 
governed more by the accumulated anthropogenic C O , 
emissions from now until the time of stabilisation than by the 
way 
emissions change over the period" (Houghton et a i , 
1996). Therefore, the writing team also grouped the scenarios 
according to their cumulative emissions (see Figure 6.8). 
This categorization can guide comparisons using either 
scenarios with different driving forces yet similar emissions, or 
scenarios with similar driving forces but different emissions. 
This characteristic of SRES scenarios also has very important 
implications for the assessment of climate-change impacts, 
mitigation, and adaptation strategies. Two future worlds with 
fundamentally different characteristic features, such as the A I 
and B2 marker scenarios, also have different cumulative CO2 
emissions, but very similar CO2 emissions in 2100. In contrast, 
scenarios that are in the same category of cumulative emissions 
can have fundamentally different driving forces and different 
CO2 emissions in 2100, but very similar cumulative emissions. 
Presumably, adverse impacts and effective adaptation measures 
would vary among the scenarios from different families that 
share similar cumulative emissions, but have different 
demographic, socio-economic, and technological driving 
forces. This is another reason for considering the entire range 
of emissions in future assessments of climate change. 
Figure 6-9 shows the histogram of cumulative COj emissions 
from 1990 to 2100 for the SRES scenarios subdivided into the 
four emissions categories. Relative positions of the four marker 
scenarios, and the ranges of the four families and the six IS92 
scenarios, are marked. The SRES scenarios have a bimodal

significantly, as do GWP values. It is unclear how to apply GWPs to 
long-term scenarios in a meaningful manner. In addition, the GWP 
approach is not applicable to gases such as SO^ and ozone precursors.

structure similar to the distribution of cumulative emissions 
from the scenarios in the literature. The groups of SRES 
scenarios span the whole range of cumulative emissions from 
the scenarios in the literature. The range of the four markers is 
from 1000 to 1900 GtC. In comparison, the IS92 cumulative 
emissions range from 700 GtC for IS92c to 2140 GtC for 
IS92e. 
The SRES emissions scenarios encompass emissions of other 
GHGs and chemically active species such as carbon 
monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and non-methane volatile organic 
compounds. The emissions of other gases follow dynamic 
patterns much like those shown in Figures 6-5 and 6-6 for 
CO2 emissions. Further details of GHG emissions are given in 
Chapter 5. 
6.3.2. 
Other 
Greenhouse 
Gases 
Of the GHGs, CO2 is the main contributor to anthropogenic 
radiative forcing because of changes in concentrations from 
pre-industrial times. According to Houghton et a l . (1996) well-
mixed GHGs (COj, CH4, NjO, and the halocarbons) induced 
additional radiative forcing of around 2.5 W/m^ on a global and 
annually averaged basis. COj accounted for 60% of the total, 
which indicates that the other GHGs are significant as well. 
Whereas COj emissions are by-and-large attributable to two 
major sources, energy consumption and land-use change, other 
emissions arise from many different sources and a large 
number of sectors and applications (e.g. see Table 5-3 in 
Chapter 5). 
The SRES emissions scenarios also have different emissions 
for other GHGs and chemically active species such as carbon 
monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and non-methane volatile organic 
compounds. 
The uncertainties that surround the emissions 
sources of these gases, and the more complex set of driving 
forces behind them aie considerable and unresolved. Hence, 
model projections of these gases are particularly uncertain and 
the scenarios presented here are no exception. Improved 
inventories and studies linking driving forces to changing 
emissions in order to improve the representation of these gases 
in global and regional emission models remain an important 
future research task. Therefore, the models and approaches

Figure 6-8: Global cumulative 
emissions (GtC, standardized). The ranges of cumulative emissions for the SRES 
scenarios are shown. Scenarios are grouped into four categories: low, medium-low, medium-high, and high emissions. Each 
category contains one marker scenario plus alternatives that lead to comparable cumulative emissions, although often through 
different driving forces. The ranges of cumulative emissions of the SRES scenario groups are shown as colored vertical bars 
and the range of the IS92 scenarios as a black vertical bar. (See also footnote 2).

Recommendations 
employed for the SRES analyses cannot produce unambiguous 
and generally approved estimates for different sources and 
world regions over a century. Despite the limited knowledge, at 
some point in time causal relationships between driving forces 
and emissions need to be crafted into the models for the sake 
of completeness. Even if new insights are generated by 
research specialists in certain fields of environmental science, 
and these become accepted as mainstream view, adopting them 
in the models is often far from straightforward as appropriate 
links to drivers may not be readily available in the underlying 
model structures. Limited personnel and resources imply that 
priorities must be assigned when deciding on further model 
development, and as a consequence the models lag behind 
"common wisdom" in certain areas. Of course, this does not 
necessarily limit their capabilities to capture major trends at a 
more aggregate level, which is the main purpose of these 
models. 
Keeping the caveats above in mind. Table 6-2b (see later) 
shows the emissions in 2100 of all relevant direct and indirect 
GHGs for the four marker scenarios and, in brackets, the range 
of the other scenarios in the same family (or scenario groups 
for the A l family). Chapter 5 gives further detail about the full 
range of GHG emissions across the SRES scenarios. Table 6-
2b also compares the SRES scenarios emissions range to that 
of the IS92 scenario series (Pepper et a l . . 1992).

Anthropogenic CH^ emissions in the year 1990 are estimated 
at 375 ± 75 Mt CH^ in the second IPCC assessment (Prather et 
a i , 1995). They arise from a variety of activities, dominated by 
biologic processes, each associated with considerable 
uncertainty. Future CH^ emissions in the scenarios depend in 
part on the consumption of fossil fuels, adjusted for assumed 
changes in technology and operational practices, but more 
strongly on scenario-specific, regional demographic and 
affluence developments, together 
with assumptions on 
prefeiTcd diets and agricultural practices. For example, it is 
noted in Chapter 5 that the observed slowing of the rate of 
increase of CH^ concentrations in recent years might indicate 
that the emission factors that link emissions to changes in their 
drivers could be changing. The writing team recommends 
further research into the sources and modeling approaches to 
capture large uncertainties surrounding future CH^ emissions. 
The resultant CH^ emissions trajectories for the four SRES 
markers and other scenarios in the four families portray 
complex patterns (as displayed in Figure 5-5 in Chapter 5). For 
example, the emissions in A2 and B2 marker scenarios increase 
throughout the whole time horizon to the year 2100. This 
increase is most pronounced in the A2 marker scenario, in 
which emissions reach about 900 Mt CH^ by 2100 (about a 
three-fold increase since 1990). The range for other scenarios 
in the A2 scenario family is between 549 and 1069 Mt CH^ by 
2100. The emissions level by 2100 for the B2 marker (600 Mt 
СЩ) is about twice as high as in 1990 (310 Mt CH^) and 
ranges between 465 and 613 Mt C H , for the other scenarios of 
the B2 family. In the A l B and B l marker scenarios, the CH4 
emissions level off and subsequently decline sooner or later in 
the 2V^ century. This phenomenon is most pronounced in the 
A l B 
marker, in which the fastest growth in the first few 
decades is followed by the steepest decline; the 2100 level ends 
up slightly below the current emission of 310 Mt CH^. The 
range of emissions in Table 6-2b indicate that alternative 
developments in energy technologies and resources could yield 
a higher range in CH^ emissions compared to the "balanced" 
technology A l scenario group. In the two fossil fuel intensive 
scenario groups (AlC and A I G , combined into the non-fossil 
A l F I group in the Summary for Policymakers of this report), 
CH4 emissions could reach some 735 Mt CH^ by 2100, 
whereas in the post-fossil A I T scenario group emissions are 
correspondingly lower (some 300 Mt CH^ by 2100). 
Interestingly, the A l scenarios generally have comparadvely 
low CH4 emissions from non-energy sources because of a 
combination of low population gfowth and rapid advances in 
agricultural productivity. Hence the SRES scenarios extend the 
uncertainty range of the IS92 scenario series somewhat toward 
lower emissions. However, both scenario sets indicate an upper 
bound of emissions of some 1000 Mt CH^ by 2100. 
6.3.2.2. 
N i t r o u s O x i d e E m i s s i o n s 
Even more than for CH^, the assumed future food supply will 
be a key determinant of future N , 0 emissions. Size, age 
structure, and regional spread of the global population will be 
reflected 
in the emissions trajectories, 
together 
with 
assumptions on diets and improvements in agricultural 
practices. Again, as for CH^ in the SRES scenarios (see Section 
5.4.1 in Chapter 5), continued growth of NjO emissions 
emerges only in the A2 scenario, largely because of high 
population growth. In the other three marker scenarios, 
emissions peak and then decline sooner or later in the course of 
the 2P' century. Importantiy, as the largest anthropogenic 
source of NjO (cultivated soils) is already very uncertain in the 
base year, all future emissions trajectories are affected by large 
uncertainties, especially if calculated with different models, as 
is the case in this SRES report. Therefore, the writing team 
recommends further research into the souices and modeling of 
long-term 
N , 0 
emissions. 
Uncertainty 
ranges 
are 
correspondingly large, and are sometimes asymmetric. For 
example, while the range in 2100 reported in all A l scenarios 
is between 5 and 10 MtN (7 MtN in the A l B marker), the A2 
marker reports 17 MtN in 2100. Other A2 scenarios report 
emissions that fall within the range reported for A l (from 8 to 
19 MtN in 2100). Thus, different model representations of 
processes that lead to NjO emissions and uncertainties in 
source strength can outweigh easily any underlying differences 
between individual scenarios in terms of population growth, 
economic development, etc. Different assumptions with 
respect to future crop productivity, agricultural practices, and 
associated emission factors, especially in the very populous 
regions of the world, explain the very different global emission 
levels even for otherwise shared main scenario drivers. Hence, 
the SRES scenarios extend the uncertainty range of future 
emissions significantly toward higher emissions (4.8 to 20,2

6.3.2.3. 
H a l o c a r b o n s a n d H a l o g e n a t e d C o m p o u n d s 
The emissions of halocarbons (chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), 
hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), halons, methylbromide, 
and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)) and other halogenated 
compounds (polyfluorocaitons (PFCs) and sulfur hexafluoride 
(SFg)) across the SRES scenarios are described in detail on a 
substance-by-substance basis in Chapter 5 and Fenhaim (2000). 
However, none of the six SRES models has its own projections 
for emissions of ozone depleting substances (ODSs), their 
detailed driving forces, and their substitutes. Hence, a different 
approach for scenario generation was adopted. 
First, for ODSs, an external scenario, the Montreal Protocol 
scenario 
(A3, maximum 
allowed production) 
from 
WMO/UNEP (1998) is used as direct input to SRES. In this 
scenario corresponding emissions decline to zero by 2100 as a 
result 
of 
international 
environmental 
agreements, 
a 
development not yet anticipated in some of the IS92 scenarios 
(Pepper et a i , 1992). For the other gas species, most notably 
for CFC and HCFC substitutes, a simple methodology of 
developing different emissions trajectories consistent with the 
aggregate 
SRES 
scenario 
driving 
force 
assumptions 
(population, GDP, etc.) was developed. Scenarios are equally 
further differentiated as to assumed future technological 
change and control rates for these gases, varied across the 
scenarios consistently within the interpretation of the SRES 
storylines presented in Chapter 4. The literature, as well as the 
scenario methodology and data, are documented in more detail 
in Fenhann (2000) and are summarized in Chapter 5. 
Second, different assumptions about CFC applications as well 
as substitute candidates were developed. These were initially 
based on Kroeze and Reijnders (1992) and information given 
in Midgley and McCulloch (1999), but updated with the most 
recent information from the Joint IPCC/TEAP Expert Meeting 
on Options for the Limitation of Emissions of HFCs and PFCs 
(WMO/UNEP, 1999) as described below. A n important 
assumption, on the basis of the latest information from the 
industry, is that relatively few Montreal gases will be replaced 
fully by HFCs. Current indications are that substitution rates of 
CFCs by HFCs will be less than 50% (McCulloch and 
Midgley, 1998). In Fenhann (2000) a further technological 
development is assumed that would result in about 25% of the 
CFCs ultimately being substituted by HFCs (see Table 5-9 in 
Chapter 5). This low percentage not only reflects the 
introduction of non-HFC substitutes, but also the notion that 
smaller amounts of halocarbons will be used in many 
applications when changing to HFCs (efficiency gains with 
technological change). A general assumption is that the present 
trend, not to substitute with high GWP substances (including 
PFCs and SFg), will continue. As a result of this assumption, 
the emissions reported here may be underestimates. This 
substitution approach is used in all four scenarios, and the 
technological options adopted are those known at present. 
Further substhution away from HFCs is assumed to require a 
climate policy and is therefore not considered in SRES 
scenarios. Policy measures that may indirectly induce lower 
halocai-bon emissions in the scenarios are adopted for reasons 
other than climate change. For one scenario (A2) no 
reductions were assumed, whereas in the other scenarios 
intermediary reduction rates and levels were assumed. 
Expressed in HFC-134a equivalents (based on SAR 
equivalents), HFCs in the SRES scenarios range between 843 
and 2123 kt HFC-134a equivalent by 2100, compared to 1188 
to 2375 kt HFC-134a equivalent in IS92. The range of 
emissions of HFCs in the SRES scenario is initiaUy generally 
lower than in earlier IPCC scenarios because of new insights 
about the availability of alternatives to HFCs as replacements 
for substances controlled by the Montreal Protocol. In two of 
the four scenarios in the report, HFC emissions increase 
rapidly in the second half of the 2P' century, while in two 
others the growth of emissions is significantly slowed down or 
reversed in that period. 
Aggregating all the different halocarbons (CFCs, HCFCs, 
HFCs) as well as halogenated compounds (PFCs and SFg) into 
MtC-equivalents (using SAR GWPs) indicates a range between 
386 and 1096 MtC-equivalent by 2100 for the SRES scenarios. 
This compares (see Table 6-2b) with a range of 746 to 875 
MtC-equivalent for IS92 (which, however, does not include 
PFCs and SFg). (The comparable SRES range, excluding PFCs 
and SFg, is between 299 and 753 MtC-equivalent by 2100.) 
The scenarios presented here indicate a wider range of 
uncertainty compared to IS92, particularly toward lower 
emissions (because of the technological and substitution 
reasons discussed above). 
The effect on climate of each of the substances aggregated to 
MtC-equivalents given in Table 6-2b varies greatly, because of 
differences in both atmospheric lifetime and the radiative effect 
per molecule of each gas. The net effect on climate of these 
substances is best determined by a calculation of their radiative 
forcing - which is the amount by which these gases enhance 
the anthropogenic greenhouse effect. The net radiative effect of 
all halocarbons, PFCs, and SFg from 1990 to 2100, including a 
current estimate of the radiative effect of stratospheric ozone 
depletion and subsequent recovery, ranges from 6% to 9% of 
the total radiative forcing from all GHGs and SO^. Preliminary 
calculations indicate that the net radiafive effect of PFCs and 
SFg in SRES scenarios will be no greater, relative to total 
anthropogenic forcing, by 2100 than it is at present.

SRES scenarios and the four markers against the emissions 
range of the IS92 scenarios, more than 80 scenarios from the 
literature, and the historical development. 
A detailed review of long-term global and regional sulfur 
emission scenarios is given in Grübler (1998) and summarized 
in Chapter 3. The most important new finding from the 
scenario literature is recognition of the significant adverse 
impacts of sulfur emissions on human health, food production, 
and ecosystems. As a result, scenarios published since 1995 
generally assume various degrees of sulfur controls to be 
implemented in the future, and thus have projections 
substantially lower than previous ones, including the IS92 
scenario series. Of these, only the two low-demand scenarios 
IS92c and IS92d fall within the range of more recent long-
term sulfur emission scenarios. A related reason for lower 
sulfur emission projections is the recent tightening of sulfur-
control policies in the Organization for Economic Cooperation 
and Development (OECD) countries, such as the Amendments 
of the Clean Air Act in the USA and the implementation of the 
Second European Sulfur Protocol. Such legislative changes 
were not reflected in previous long-term emission scenarios, 
as noted in Alcamo et a l . (1995) and Houghton et a l . (1995). 
Similar sulfur control initiatives due to local air quality 
concems are beginning to impact sulfur emissions also in a 
number of developing countries in Asia and Latin America 
(see lEA, 1999; La Rovere and Americano, 1998; Streets and 
Waldhoff, 2000; for a more detailed discussion see Chapter 3). 
As a result, the median from recent sulfur scenarios (see 
Chapter 3) is consequently significantly lower compared to 
IS92, indicating a continual decline in global sulfur emissions 
in the long-term. The median and mean of sulfur control 
scenarios are almost identical. As mentioned above, even the 
highest range of recent sulfur-control scenarios is significantly 
below that of comparable, high-demand IS92 scenarios 
(IS92a, IS92b, IS92e, and IS92f). The scenarios with the 
lowest ranges project stringent sulfur-control levels that lead 
to a substantial decline in long-term emissions and a retum to 
emission levels that prevailed at the beginning of the 20* 
century. 
Reflecting recent developments and the literature (reviewed in 
Chapter 3), it is assumed that sulfur emissions in the SRES 
scenarios will also be controlled increasingly outside the 
OECD. As a result, both long-term trends and regional patterns 
of sulfur emissions evolve differently from carbon emissions m 
the SRES scenarios. As a general pattern, global sulfur 
emissions do not rise substantially, and eventually decline, 
even in absolute terms, during the second half of the 21' 
century (see also Chapters 2 and 3). The spatial distribution of 
emissions changes markedly. Emissions in the OECD 
countries continue their recent declining trend (reflecting the 
Summary

tightening of control measures). Emissions outside the OECD 
rise initially, most notably in Asia, which compensates for the 
declining OECD emissions. Over the long tenn, however, 
sulfur emissions decline throughout the world, but the timing 
and magnitude vary across the scenarios 
The SRES scenario set brackets global anthropogenic sulfur 
emissions between 27 and 169 MtS by 2050 and between 11 
and 93 MtS by 2100 (see Table 6-2b). The range of emissions 
for the four markers is smaller. In contrast, the range of the 
IS92 scenarios (Pepper et a l . , 1992; Alcamo et a l . , 1995) is 
substantially higher, starting at 80 MtS and extending all the 
way to 200 MtS by 2050 and from 55 to 230 MtS by 2100. The 
two lowest scenarios, IS92c and IS92d, approach the higher 
end estimates of the SRES scenarios in 2100, while others are 
above the SRES range. As mentioned, this difference reflects 
the expected future consequences of recent policies that aim to 
achieve a drastic reduction in sulfur emissions in OECD 
countries, as well as an anticipated gradual introduction of 
sulfur controls in developing regions in the long-term, as 
reported in the underlying literature (see Chapter 3). In other 
words, all SRES scenarios assume sulfur control measures, 
although the uncertainty in timing and magnitude of 
implementation is reflected in the variation across difterent 
scenarios. Importantly, SRES scenarios assume sulfur controls 
only 
and do not assume any additional climate policy 
measures. Nevertheless, one important implication of this 
varying pattem of sulfur emissions is that the historically 
important, but uncertain, negative radiative forcing of sulfate 
aerosols may decline in the very long run. This view is also 
confinned by model calculations reported in Subak et a l . 
(1997) and Nakicenovic et a l . (1998), on the basis of recent 
long-term GHG and sulfur emission scenarios.

The 
1990 NOj^ emissions in the six SRES models range 
between 26.5 and 34.2 MtN, but not all the models provide a 
comprehensive description of NO^ emissions. Some models do 
not estimate N0^^ emissions at all (MARIA, MiniCAM), 
whereas 
others 
only 
include 
energy-related 
sources 
(MESSAGE) and have adopted other sources of emissions 
from corresponding scenarios derived from other models (i.e. 
MESSAGE uses conesponding AIM scenarios). Standardized 
(see Box 5-1 on Standardization) 1990 NO^^ emissions in the 
SRES scenarios, measured as nitrogen, amount to 31 MtN 
(Figure 5-9 in Chapter 5). 
As mentioned in Chapter 4, the volume of fossil fuels used for 
various energy purposes varies widely in the SRES scenario 
families. In addition, the level and timing of emission controls, 
insphed by local air quality concems, is assumed to differ. As 
a result the spread of NO^^ emissions is largest within the A l 
scenano family (28-151 MtN by 2100), almost as large as the 
range across all 40 SRES scenarios (see Table 6-2b). Only in 
the highest emission scenarios (the fossil fuel intensive A I C 
and A I G scenario groups within the A l scenario family and the 
high population, coal intensive A2 scenario family) do 
emissions rise continuously throughout the 2P' century. In the 
A l ("balanced") scenario group and in the B2 scenario family, 
NOjj emission levels rise less. NO^, emissions tend to increase 
up to 2050 and stabilize thereafter, the result of a gradual 
substitution of fossil fuels by altematives as well as of the 
increasing diffusion of N0^ control technologies. Low 
emission futures are described by various В1 family scenarios, 
as well as in the A I T scenario group that describe futures in 
which NOjj emissions are controlled because of either local air 
quality concerns or rapid technological change away from 
conventional fossil technologies. Overall, the SRES scenarios 
describe a similar upper range of NO^ emissions as the 
previous IS92 scenarios (151 MtN versus 134 MtN, 
respectively, by 2100), but extend the IS92 uncertainty range 
toward lower emission levels (16 versus 54 MtN by 2100 in the 
SRES and IS92 scenarios, respectively).

Non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) arise 
from fossil fuel combustion (as with N0^, wide ranges of 
emission factors ai^e typical for intemal combustion engines), 
and also from industrial processes, fuel storage (fugitive 
emissions), use of solvents (e.g., in paint and cleaners), and a 
variety of other activities. As chemical reactivities of the 
various substances grouped under the NMVOCs category are 
very different, so are their roles in ozone foimation and the 
(potential) health hazai^ds associated with them. In this report, 
NMVOCs are discussed as one group. In 1990, the estimated 
emissions range was between 83 and 178 Mt NMVOC, which 
after standardization (see Box 5-1) translates into 140 Mt 
NMVOC. As for NOj^ emissions, not all models include this 
emissions category or all of its sources; the most detailed 
treatment of NMVOC emissions is given in the ASF model. 
A relatively robust trend across all 40 scenarios (see Figure 5-
10 in Chapter 5) is a gradual increase in N M V O C emissions 
up to about 2050, with a range of between 190 and 260 Mt. 
Beyond 2050, uncertainties increase with respect to both 
emission levels and trends. By 2100, the range is between 58 
and 552 Mt, which extends the IS92 scenario range of 136 to 
403 Mt by 2100 toward both higher and lower emissions (see 
Table 6-2b). As for NO^^ emissions, the upper bounds of 
N M V O C emissions are formed by fossil fuel intensive 
scenario groups within the A l scenario family (AIC, 
AIG, 
combined into one fossil intensive scenario group A l F I in the 
Summary for Policymakers, see also footnote 2), and the 
lower bounds by the scenarios within the В1 scenario family. 
Characteristic ranges are between 60 and 90 Mt N M V O C by 
2100 in the low emissions cluster and between 370 and 550 Mt 
N M V O C in the high emissions cluster. A l l other scenario 
families and individual scenarios fall between these two 
emissions clusters; the B2 marker scenario (B2-MESSAGE) 
closely tracks the median of global N M V O C emissions from 
all the SRES scenarios (see Figure 5-10 in Chapter 5).

CO emissions in 1990 are estimated to range between 752 and 
984 Mt CO (880 Mt CO after standardization) across the 
models used to derive the SRES scenarios. The same caveats as 
for NOj^ and NMVOC emissions also apply to CO emissions -
the number of models that represent all the emission source 
categories is limited and modeling and data uncertainties, such 
as emission factors, are considerable. As a result, CO emission 
estimates across scenarios are highly model specific and future 
emission levels overlap considerably between the four SRES 
scenario families (see Table 6-2b). By 2100, emissions range 
between 363 and 3766 Mt CO, a considerably larger 
uncertainty range, particulaiiy toward higher emissions, than in 
IS92, for which the 2100 emission range was between 450 and 
929 Mt CO (see Table 6-2b). 
As for the N0^ and N M V O C emissions discussed above, the 
highest CO emission levels are associated with the high-growth 
fossil fuel intensive scenarios (AIC and A I G scenario groups, 
combined into one fossil intensive scenario group A l F I in the 
Summary for Policymakers; see also footnote 2) within the A l 
scenario family, and the lowest emission levels are generally 
associated with the B l and B2 scenario families. However, 
inter-model variability is considerable, which indicates that 
uncertainties are equally large with respect to scenario driving 
forces (such as energy demand and supply growth) and other 
factors that influence CO emissions (such as local air quality 
concems or technological change). 
6.4. 
Summary and Conclusions 
In summary, the SRES scenarios lead to the following findings: 
• 
Alternative combinations of driving forces can lead to 
similar levels and structure of energy and land-use 
pattems, as illustrated by different scenarios and groups. 
Hence, even for a given scenario outcome (e.g. in terms 
of GHG emissions) diere are altemative combinations 
of driving forces and pathways that could lead to that 
outcome. For instance, significant global changes could 
result from a scenario of high population growth, even 
if per capita incomes rise only modestly, as well as from 
a scenario in which a rapid demographic transition (to 
low population levels) coincides with high rates of 
income growth and affluence. 
• 
Important possibilities for further bifurcations in future 
development trends exist within one scenario family, 
even when particular values are adopted for the 
important scenario driving force variables to illustrate a 
particular development path. The four technology 
scenario groups in A l family (combined into three in 
the Summary for Policymakers) illustrate such 
alternative 
development 
paths 
with 
similar 
quanfifications of the main driving forces. 
• 
Emissions profiles are dynamic across the range of 
SRES scenarios. They portray trend reversals and 
indicate possible emissions crossover among different 
scenarios. They do not represent mere extensions of 
confinuous increase of GHGs and SO, emissions into 
the future. This more complex pattern of future 
emissions across the range of SRES scenarios, time 
periods, world regions, and sectors reflects recent 
scenario literature. 
• 
Describing potential future developments involves 
inherent ambiguities and uncertainties. One and only 
one possible development path (as alluded to, for 
instance, in concepts such as "business-as-usual 
scenario") simply does not exist alone. And even for 
each alternative development path described by any 
given scenario, there are numerous combinations of 
driving forces and numeric values that can be consistent 
with a particular scenario description. The numeric 
precision of any model result should not distract from 
the basic fact that uncertainty abounds. However, the 
multi-model approach increases the value of the SRES 
scenaiio set, since uncertainties in the choice of model 
input assumptions can be separated more explicitly 
from the specific model behavior and related modeling 
uncertainties. 
• 
Any scenario has subjective elements and is open to 
various interpretations. While the writing team as a 
whole has no preference for any of the scenarios, and 
has no judgment as to the probability or desirability of 
different scenarios, the open process and initial 
reactions to draft versions of this report show that 
individuals and interest 
groups do have such 
judgments. The writing team hopes that this will 
stimulate an open discussion in the policy making arena 
about potential futures and choices that can be made in 
the context of climate change response. For the 
scientific community, the SRES scenario exercise has 
led to the identification of a number of recom-
mendations for future research that can further increase 
the understanding of potential developments of socio-
economic driving forces and their interactions, and the 
associated G H G emissions. A summary of main 
findings and recommendations for potential users of the 
SRES scenarios is given in Box 6-3 and Box 6-4. The 
writing teams' suggestions for consideration by the 
IPCC are summarized in Box 6-5. 
• 
Finally, the writing team believes that the SRES 
scenarios largely fulfifi all the specifications set out in 
Chapter 1. To support reproducibility, more detailed 
information than can be included in this report will be 
made available by individual modeling groups and 
members of the writing team through other means, such 
as web sites, peer-reviewed literature, or background 
documentation if additional resources can be made 
available. 
In conclusion, Tables 6-2a and 6-2b summarize the main 
characteristics of the seven scenario groups that constitute the 
four families (combined into six groups in the Summary for 
Policymakers). The tables give the global ranges of driving

Box 6-3 Main Findings and Implications of SRES Scenarios 
• 
The four scenario families each have a narrative storyline and consist of 40 scenarios developed by six modeling groups. 
• 
The 40 scenarios cover the full range of GHGs and SO2 emissions consistent with the underlying range of driving forces 
from scenario literature. 
• 
The 40 SRES scenarios fall into different groups - the three scenario families A2, B l , and B2, plus four groups within 
the A l scenario family, two of which (AlC and AIG) have been combined into one fossil-intensive group A l F I m the 
Summary for Policymakers; see also footnote 2. The four A l groups are distinguished by their technological emphasis -
on coal (AlC), oil and gas (AIG), non-fossil energy sources (AIT), or a balance across all sources 
(Al). 
• 
Tire scenarios are grouped into four categories of cumulative CO^ emissions, which indicate that scenarios with different 
driving forces can lead to similar cumulative emissions and those with similar driving forces can branch out into different 
categories of cumulative emissions. 
• 
Four from 40 scenaiios are designated as marker scenarios that are characteristic of the four scenarios families. Together 
with the two additional illustrative scenarios selected from the scenario groups in the A1 family, they capture most of the 
emissions and driving forces spanned by the full set of the scenarios. 
• 
There is no single central or "best guess" scenario, and probabilities or likelihood are not assigned to individual scenarios. 
Instead, the writing team recommends that the smallest set of scenarios used should include the four designated marker 
scenarios and the two additional illustrative scenarios selected from the scenario groups in the A l family. 
• 
Distinction between scenarios that envisage stringent environmental policies and those that include direct climate policies 
was very difficult to make, a difficulty associated with many definitional and other ambiguities. 
• 
All scenarios describe futures that are generally more affluent than today. Many of the scenarios envisage a more rapid 
convergence in per capita income ratios in the world compared to the IS 92 scenarios while, at the same time, they jointly 
cover a wide range of GHG and SO, emissions. 
• 
Emissions profiles are more dynamic than the IS92 scenarios, which reflects changes in future emissions trends for some 
scenarios and GHG species. 
• 
The levels of GHG emissions are generally lower than the IS92 levels, especially toward the end of the 2P' century, while 
emissions of SOj, which have a cooling effect on the atmosphere, are significantly lower than in IS92. 
• 
Altemative combinations of main scenario driving forces can lead to similar levels of GHG emissions by the end of the 
2P' century. Scenarios with different underlying assumptions can result in very similar climate changes. 
• 
Technology is at least as important a driving force of GHG emissions as population and economic development across 
the set of 40 SRES scenarios. 
Box 6-4: Recommendations for Consideration by the User Communities 
The writing team recommends that the SRES scenarios be the mani basis for the assessment of future emissions and their 
driving forces in the Third Assessment Report (TAR). Accordingly, the SRES writing team makes the following 
recommendations regarding the emissions scenarios to be used in the atmosphere/ocean general circulation models (A/O 
GCMs) simulations for Working Group I (WGI), for the models that will be used in the assessment of climate change impacts 
by Working Group II (WGII), and for the mitigation and stabilization assessments by WGIII:

i n any a n a l y s i s . The scenario groups 
- the scenario families A2, B l , and B2, plus the groups within the A l scenario family, and four cumulative emissions 
categories were developed as the smallest subsets of SïŒS scenarios that capture the range of uncertahities associated 
with driving forces and emissions.

range reflected by the cumulative emissions categories. To assess the robustness of options in terms of impacts, 
vulnerability, and adaptation may require scenarios with similar emissions but different socio-economic characteristics, 
as reflected by the scenario groups. For mitigation analysis, variation ui both emissions and socio-economic 
characteristics may be necessary. For analysis at the national or regional scale, the most appropriate scenarios may be 
those that best reflect specific circumstances and perspectives.

scenarios do not represent the likelihood of their occurrence. The writing team cautions against constructing a central, 
"best-estimate" scenario from the SRES scenarios; instead it recommends use of the SRES scenarios as they are.

various changes have been assumed to occur that would require other policy interventions.

Extend the SRES web site and CD-ROM to provide, if appropriate, time-dependent geographic distributions of driving 
forces and emissions, and concentrations of GHGs and sulfate aerosols. 
• 
Development of a classification scheme for classifying scenarios as intervention or non-intervention scenarios. 
• 
Establish a programme for on-going evaluations and comparisons of long-term emissions scenarios, including a regularly 
updated scenario database. 
• 
A n effort should be made m the future to develop an appropriate emissions scenario classification scheme. 
• 
Identify resources for capacity building in the area of emissions scenarios for future IPCC assessments, with a particular 
emphasis to involve strong participation from developmg countries. 
• 
Promote activities within and outside the IPCC to extend the SRES multi-baseline and multi-model approach in future 
assessments of climate change impacts, adaptation, and mitigation. 
• 
Initiate new programs to assess GHG emissions from land use and sources of emissions other than energy-related 
CO2 
emissions, to go beyond the effort of SRES, which was limited by time and resoiffces. 
• 
Initiate new programs to assess future developments of driving forces and GHG emissions for different regions and for 
different sectors (taking the set of SRES scenarios as reference for overall global and regional developments) to provide 
more regional and sectorial detau than time and resources allowed SRES to achieve.

summarizes the ranges of the main scenario driving forces: 
global population, economic development, per capita income 
levels and income ratios, energy intensity, primary energy use, 
and stmcture of energy supply. Table 6-2b summarizes the 
emissions of GHGs, SO2, and ozone precursors emissions for 
the years 2020, 2050, and 2100 as well as cumulative 1990-

New IPCC Emissions Scenarios 
It is proposed that Working Group III coordinate the 
development of new emissions scenarios that assume no 
additional climate policy initiatives. 
I.l. 
Baciiground 
In 1992 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC) released six emissions scenarios (Leggett et a l . , 1992) 
providing alternative emissions trajectories spanning the years 
1990 through 2100 for greenhouse-related gases, Carbon 
dioxide (COj), carbon monoxide (CO), methane (СЩ), nitrous 
oxide (N2O), nitrogen oxyde (NO^), and sulfur dioxide (SOj). 
These scenarios were intended for use by atmospheric and 
climate scientists in the preparation of scenarios of 
atmospheric composition and climate change. The work 
updated and extended earlier work prepared for the IPCC first 
assessment report. These six scenarios are referred to as the 
IS92 scenarios. 
In many ways the IS92 scenarios were pathbreaking. They 
were the first global scenarios to provide estimates of the full 
suite of greenhouse gases. At the time, they were the only 
scenarios to provide emission trajectories for SO2. Alcamo et 
a l . (1995) reviewed the scenarios and found that the fossil fuel 
carbon emissions trajectories spanned more than half of the 
open literature emissions scenarios reviewed. Other emissions 
trajectories had received less scrutiny in the open literature and, 
while the IS92 cases were not dissimilar to those in the open 
Hterature, the open literature was extremely sparse in many 
instances. 
Much has changed in the period following the creation of the 
IS92 scenarios. Sulfur emissions have been recognized as a 
more important radiative forcing factor than other ПОП-СО2 
greenhouse-related gases, and some regional control policies 
have been adopted. Restructuring in the states of Eastem 
Europe and the Former Soviet Union has had far more 
powerful effects on economic activity and emissions than were 
foreseen in the IS92 scenarios. For some regions these 
scenarios are not representative of those found in the literature. 
The advent of integrated assessment (lA) models has made it 
possible to construct self-consistent emissions scenarios that 
jointly consider the interactions between energy, economy, and 
land-use changes. 
Alcamo et a l . (1995) found that for the purposes of driving 
atmospheric climate models, the CO^ emissions trajectories of 
the IS92 scenarios provided a reasonable reflection of 
variations found in the open literature. However, scenarios are 
also required for other purposes, and the IS92 scenarios are not 
suitable for purposes for which they were not developed. It was 
concluded that, if the scenarios were intended to have broader 
uses than simply a set of emissions trajectories to drive climate 
models, new scenarios should be developed. Further, a new 
approach should be adopted. The new approach should open 
the process to the broader research community. 
1.2. 
Approach 
It is proposed that new scenarios should be developed through 
a coordinated effort that draws upon the expertise of all 
researchers in the relevant community. A three-step process is 
envisaged. First, key input assumptions would be reviewed 
and provided to modelers. Second, modelers would be asked 
to construct emissions scenarios based on the input 
assumptions provided. Finally, the model results will be used 
to develop new emissions scenarios in the form of average 
results 
for participating models 
or results 
from 
a 
representative model. 
A writing team would be established to consider key input 
assumptions (such as population projections and technologic 
change) and emissions from speciflc sources (such as SO^ 
emissions and CO2 emissions due to land-use change), 
possibly with the assistance of specialized task groups. The 
writing team will also stipulate a set of geographical reporting 
regions, reporting yeai's, units of measure, etc., designed to 
provide climate modelers, impact assessment analysts, and 
other users with the detail they need for their work. Finally, the 
writing team would ensure that the range of results reflects the 
underlying uncertainty and, to the extent possible, that the 
assumptions for specific scenarios are internally consistent. 
Scenario development will be an open process. There will be 
no "ofticial" model. There will be no "expert teams." Any 
research group with the capability of preparing scenarios for 
any region can participate. This means that, while modeling 
teams which employ global coverage will be able to 
participate, so too will regional modelers. By opening the 
process in this way, developing and developed region 
researchers with local expertise can participate even if they do 
not have global coverage. Modeling teams will be provided 
with information on the input assumptions and other necessary 
information such as, for example, the world oil price, to 
regional modeling teams. 
Once the modeling teams have completed their work, a set of 
scenarios will be chosen. This will likely be the inputs and 
outputs of a "representative" model, but it could also be the 
average 
of the participating models or some other 
representation of the model results. 
1.3. 
Reporting and Distribution of Results 
To maximize the usefulness of the new scenarios, two steps 
should be taken. First, arrangements should be made with an 
organization whose mission it is to disseminate information to 
provide a means by which users can access scenario results. All 
results from research institutions will be included in the 
database along with associated assumptions. In addition, for 
SRES 
Terms 
of Reference: 
New I P C C E m i s s i o n s S c e n a r i o s 
325 
research teams wiUing to participate, the associated models 
will also be made available so that users can not only have 
access to scenario assumptions and outputs, but have the 
capability of independently creating derivative scenarios. 
1.4. 
Timing and Coordination 
It is proposed that the writing team begin work before the end 
of 1996. The team should establish the parameters -
geographic reporting regions, reporting years, time horizon, 
units, etc. - by the end of the first quarter of 1997. Reports of 
the expert groups on the range of values for each of the input 
assumptions should be available by the end of the third quarter 
of 1997. The scenario resuhs con-esponding to these input 
assumptions should be available from participafing modeling 
groups during the first quarter of 1998. Peer and government 
review should be complete by the end of 1998.

Six Modeling Approaches 
The SRES Terms of Reference call for a multi-model approach 
for developing emissions scenarios (see Appendix I). In all, six 
different modeling approaches were used to generate the 40 
SRES scenarios. These six models are representative of the 
approaches to emissions scenario modeling and the different 
integrated assessment frameworks used in the scenario 
literature and include both macro-economic (so-called top-
down) and systems-engineering (so-called bottom-up) models. 
Some modeling teams developed scenarios to reflect all four 
storylines, while some presented scenarios for fewer storylines. 
Chapter 4 lists all the SRES scenarios, by modeling group and 
by scenario family. The six modeling approaches include: 
• 
Asian Pacific Integrated Model (AIM) from the 
National Institute of Environmental Studies in Japan 
(Morita e t a l . , 1994); 
Atmospheric Stabilization Framework Model (ASF) 
from ICF Consulting in the USA (Lashof and Tirpak, 
1990; 
Pepper et a l . , 1992, 1998; Sankovski et a l . , 
2000); 
Integrated Model to Assess the Greenhouse Effect 
(IMAGE) from the National Institute for Pubtic Health 
and Environmental Hygiene (RIVM) (Alcamo et a l , 
1998; 
de Vries et a i , 1994, 1999, 2000), used in 
connection with the Dutch Bureau for Economic Policy 
Analysis (СРВ) WorldScan model (de Jong and Zalm, 
1991), the Netherlands; 
Multiregional Approach for Resource and Industry 
Allocation (MARIA) from the Science University of 
Tokyo in Japan (Mori and Takahashi, 1999; Mori, 2000); 
Model for Energy Supply Strategy Altematives and 
their General Environmental Impact (MESSAGE) from 
the Intemational Institute of Applied Systems Analysis 
(IIASA) in Austria (Messner and Stmbegger, 1995; 
Riahi and Roehrl, 2000); and the 
Mini Climate Assessment Model (MiniCAM) from the 
Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in the 
USA (Edmonds et a l , 1994, 1996a, 1996b). 
IV.l. 
Asian Pacific Integrated Model 
The Asian Pacific Integrated Model (AIM) is a large-scale 
computer 
simulation model for scenario analyses of 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the impacts of global 
warming in the Asian-Pacific region. This model is being 
developed mainly to examine global warming response 
measures in the region, but it is Unked to a world model so that 
it is possible to make global estimates. AIM comprises three 
main models - the GHG emission model (AIM/emission), the 
global cUmate change model (AIM/climate), and the climate 
change impact model (AIM/impact). 
The AIM-based quantification was conducted as an Asian 
collaborative project using a new lirdicd version of the 
AIM/emission model, which covers the world but has a more 
detailed structure for the Asian-Pacific region than for other 
regions. The new linked version couples bottom-up models and 
top-down models (Figure IV-1). 
The bottom-up models were prepared using the original 
AIM 
bottom-up components, 
which can reproduce detailed 
processes of energy consumption, industrial production, land-
use changes, and waste management as well as technology 
development and social demand changes. However, two kinds 
of top-down models were prepared for this quantification: 
An 
energy-economic model based on the revised 
Edmonds-Reilly-Barns (ERB) Model, which can 
estimate interactions between energy sectors and 
economic sectors. 
• 
An original land equilibrium model that can reproduce 
interactions between land-use changes and economic 
sectors. 
The original AIM bottom-up components were integrated with 
these two top-down models through a newly developed linkage 
module. This new stracture maximizes the ability to simulate a 
variety of inputs at a variety of levels, and to calculate future 
GHG emissions in a relatively full-range analysis. 
The A I M model has nine regions for the energy-economic 
model and 17 regions for the bottom-up and land equilibrium 
models (see Table IV-1). Its time horizon is from 1990 to 
2100. 
Before 2030, h uses 5-year time steps, but then jumps 
to 2050, 2075, and 2100. The GHGs and related gases 
include: 
• 
Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH^), nitrous oxide 
(N2O), carbon monoxide (CO), non-methane volatile 
organic compounds (NMVOCs), nitrogen oxides 
(N0,^), and sulfur dioxide (SOj) etnissions from energy 
combustion-production processes. 
CO, from deforestation. 
CH^ and N2O from agricultural production. 
• 
NMVOCs and SOj from biomass combustion. 
• 
CO2, CH4, N2O, N0^, CO, NMVOCs. and SOj 
emissions 
from 
industrial 
processes, 
waste 
management, and land-use changes. 
More detailed information can be obtained by referring to the 
web site: www-cger.nies.go.jp/ipcc/aim/ 
The ASF energy model consists of four end-use sectors 
(residential, commercial, industrial, and transportation). These 
sectors consume liquid fuels, solid fuels, gaseous fuels, and 
electricity. An electricity generation sector converts liquid 
fuels, solid fuels, gaseous fuels, nuclear energy, hydro energy, 
and solar energy into electricity. A synfuels sector converts 
coal and/or biomass into either a liquid or gaseous fuel. There 
is no direct consumption of solar energy or biomass by the end-
use sectors.

IV.2. 
The Atmospheric Stabilization Frameworli (ASF) 
Model 
The current version of ASF includes energy, agricultural, and 
deforestation GHG emissions and atmospheric models and 
provides emission estimates for nine world regions (Tables IV-
1 and IV-2). 
In the ASF model balancing the supply and demand for energy 
is achieved ultimately by adjusting energy prices. Energy 
prices differ by region to reflect regional market conditions, 
and by type of energy to reflect supply constraints, conversion 
costs, and the value of the energy to end users. ASF estimates 
the supply-demand balance by an iterative search technique to 
determine supply prices. These supply prices, which energy 
producers charge for the fuel at the wellhead or at the mine, are 
used to estimate the secondary energy prices in each region. 
These secondary prices are based on the supply price for the 
marginal export region, the inteiregional transportation cost, 
refming and distribution costs, and regional tax policies. For 
electricity, the secondary prices reflect the relative proportions 
of each fuel used to produce the electricity, the secondary 
prices of those fuels, the non-fossil costs of converting the fuels 
into electricity, and the conversion efficiency. 
The agricultural ASF model estimates the production of major 
agricultural products, such as meat, milk, and grain, which is 
driven by population and gross national product (GNP) 
growth. 
This model is linked with the ASF deforestation model, which 
estimates the area of land deforested aimually as a function of 
population growth and demand for agricultural products. 
The ASF GHG emissions model uses outputs of the energy, 
agricultural, and deforestation models to estimate G H G 
emissions in each ASF region. These emissions are estimated 
by mapping G H G emission sources to the corresponding 
emission drivers and changing them according to changes in 
these drivers. For example, CH^ emissions from landfills are 
mapped to population, while CO2 emissions from cement 
production are mapped to 
GNP. 
Finally, the ASF atmospheric model uses G H G emission 
esfimates to calculate GHG concentrations, and corresponding 
radiative forcing and temperature effects. A detailed 
description of the ASF is provided in the ASF 1990 Report to 
Congress (Lashof and Т1фак, 1990), and recent applications of 
the model are reported in Pepper et a l . (1998) and Sankovski et 
a l . (2000). 
IV.3. Integrated Model to Assess the Greenhouse Effect

EIS computes the emissions of GHGs in 13 world regions 
(Tables IV-l and IV-3). The energy-related emissions are based 
on the Targets Image Energy Regional (TIMER) simulation 
model (Figure IV-2). TIMER is a systems dynamics model 
with investment decisions in energy efficiency, electricity 
generation, and energy supply based on anticipated demand, 
relative costs or prices, and institutional and informational 
delays. The model uses five economic sectors. Technological 
change and fuel price dynamics influence energy intensity, fuel 
substitution, and the penetration of non-fossil options such as 
solar electricity and biomass-based fuels. 
The objective of TES is to simulate global land-use and land-
cover changes and then effect on emissions of GHGs and ozone 
precursors, and on carbon fluxes between the biosphere and the 
atmosphere (Figure IV-3). This subsystem can be used to: 
• 
Evaluate the effectiveness of land-use policies to 
control the build-up of GHGs. 
• 
Assess the land consequences of large-scale use of 
biofuels. 
• 
Evaluate the impact of climate change on global 
ecosystems and agriculture. 
Investigate the effects of population, economic, and 
technological trends on changing global land cover.

Model for Energy Supply Strategy Alternatives 
and their General Environmental Impact 
(MESSAGE) 
A set of integrated models was used to formulate the SRES 
scenaiios at IIASA (Nakicenovic, et a l . , 1998). Model for 
Energy Supply Strategy Alternatives and their General 
Environmental Impact (MESSAGE) is one of the six models 
3 4 1 
that constitute lIASA's integrated modeling framework 
(Messner and Strubegger, 1995; Riahi and Roehrl, 2000; 
Roehrl and Riahi, 2000). 
The scenario formulation process starts with exogenous 
assumptions about population and per capita economic growth 
by region. Energy demand (defined at the useful energy level) 
is derived using the Scenario Generator (SG) model, a dynamic 
model of future economic and energy development. It 
combines 
extensive 
historical data 
about 
economic 
development and energy systems with empirically estimated 
equations of trends to determine future stmctural change. For 
each scenario, SG generates future paths of energy use 
consistent with historical dynamics and with the specific 
scenario features (e.g., high or moderate economic growth, 
rapid or more gradual energy intensity improvements). 
The economic and energy development profiles serve as inputs 
for 
the energy systems engineering model MESSAGE 
(Messner and Strubegger, 1995; Riahi and Roehrl, 2000; 
Roehrl and Riahi, 2000) and the macro-economic model 
MACRO (Manne and Richels, 1992). MESSAGE is a dynamic 
linear programming model that calculates cost-minimal supply 
stractures under the constraints of resource availability, the 
menu of given technologies, and the demand for useful energy. 
If estimates detailed energy system structures, including energy 
demand, supply, and emissions pattems, consistent with the 
evolution of the energy demand produced by SG. MACRO is a 
modified version of the Global 2100 model, originafiy 
published in 1992 (Manne and Richels, 
1992) and 
subsequently used widely in many energy studies around the 
world. MACRO maximizes the inter-temporal utility function 
of a single representative producer-consumer in each world 
region and estimates the relationships between macro-
economic development and energy use. MESSAGE and 
MACRO are linked and used in tandem to test scenario 
consistency because they correspond to the two different 
perspectives from which energy modeling is usually carried out 
- top-down (MACRO) and bottom-up (MESSAGE). 
The impacts of energy price changes on energy demand and 
gross domestic product (GDP) 
growth are estimated by iterating 
shadow prices from MESSAGE and energy demands from the 
MACRO model. The iteration is repeated until energy 
intensities and GDP growth rates are consistent with the output 
of the SG model adopted as exogenous input assumptions at the 
beginning of the scenario formulation process. The demand 
reductions caused by increasing energy prices in the B2 marker 
compared to a hypothetical case with constant energy prices 
were calculated with MACRO. Compared to this hypothetical 
case the price-induced energy demand savings in the B2 marker 
are 8% by 2020, 23% by 2050, and 30% by 2100. Table IV-4 
gives the shadow prices for intemational trade for gas, oil, and 
coal in the B2 marker. Table IV-5 summarizes the regional 
ranges for extraction costs of gas, oil, and coal in the B2 marker. 
The atmospheric concentrations of GHGs and the resultant 
warming potentials can be estimated by the Model for the

Assessment of Greenhouse Gas-Induced Climate Change 
(MAGICC), a carbon cycle and climate change model 
developed by Wigley et a l . (1994). 
Figure IV-4 illustrates the IIASA integrated modeling 
framework and shows how the models are linked (Nakicenovic, 
et a l , 1998). Of the six models shown in Figure IV-4, four (SG, 
MESSAGE, MACRO, and MAGICC) were used for the 
fonnulation and analysis of SRES scenarios, including the B2 
marker scenario. In addition the MESSAGE model was used to 
quantify all four scenario groups of the A l storyline and 
scenario family and a number of scenarios of the В1 storyline 
and scenario family. Altogether, the IIASA team formulated 
nine SRES scenarios, including the B2 marker. 
The other two models shown in Figure IV-4, RAINS and BLS, 
were not used to model the SRES scenarios. RAINS (Alcamo 
et a l , 1990) is a simulation model of sulfur and NO^, emissions, 
their 
subsequent 
atmospheric 
transport, 
chemical 
transformations of those emissions, deposition, and ecological 
impacts. BLS (Fischer et a l , 1988, 1994) is a sectorial macro-
economic model that accounts for all major inputs (such as 
land, fertilizer, capital, and labor) required for the production 
of 11 agricultural commodities. 
The IIASA model set covers energy sector and industrial 
emission sources only. Agricultural and land-use related

The Multiregional Approach for Resource and 
Industry Allocation Model (MARIA) 
The 
Multiregional Approach for Resource and Industry 
Allocation Model 
(MARIA) is a compact 
integrated 
assessment model to assess the inteirelationships among the 
economy, energy, resources, land use, and global climate 
change (Mori and Takahashi, 1999; Mori 2000). The origin of 
the model is the Dynamic Integrated Model of Climate and the 
Economy (DICE) model, developed by Nordhaus (1994). 
Involving energy flows and dividing the world into regions, 
MARIA has been developed to assess technology and policy 
options to address global warming. Like Global 2100 
developed by Manne and Richels (1992), MARIA is currenfly 
an intertemporal non-linear optimization model that deals with 
international trading among eight regions - N A M (USA and 
Canada), Japan, Other OECD countries, China, A S E A N 
countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, 
Republic of Korea, Thaüand), SAS (India, Bangladesh, 
Pakistan, Sri-Lanka), EEFSU (Eastern Europe and the Former 
Soviet Union), and A L M (Africa and Latin America). It also 
encompasses energy flows and simplified food production and 
land use changes to show the potential contribution of 
biomass. 
Economic activities are represented by a constant elasticity of 
substitution (CES) production function with caphal stock, 
labor, electricity, and non-electric energy set for the above 
eight world regions. Future GDP growth is projected by 
considering potential GDP growth rates (the product of two 
exogenous assumptions - population and potential per capita 
GDP growth) as well as endogenously determined energy costs 
and prices. The energy module in MARIA involves three fossil 
primary energy resources (i.e., coal, natural gas, and oil), 
biomass, nuclear power, and renewable energy technologies 
(e.g., hydropower. solar, wind, and geothermal). Energy 
demand consists of industry, transportation, and other public 
uses. Nuclear fuel recycling technologies are simply but 
explicitly formulated. Carbon sequestration technologies are 
also taken into account. Typically, MARIA basically generates 
resource extraction profiles in which gas is mainly used in the 
first half of the 2P' century, and subsequently carbon-free 
sources (e.g., solar, nuclear, and biomass) and coal assume the 
main roles in the second half of the 2P* century. 
Energy costs in the model consist of energy production and 
utilization costs. Market prices are determined endogenously 
on the basis of model-calculated shadow prices. Among 
various parameters, the extraction costs of fossil fuel resources 
and 
energy 
conversion 
cost 
coefficients 
contribute 
substantially to detennining the model's energy mix and 
emissions. The latest model version, MARIA-8, applied 
Rogner's estimates on fossil resource availability (Rogner, 
1997). For the sake of simplicity, the fossil resource and 
reserve categories are aggregated into two classes, assuming a 
quadratic production function to inteipolate the relationships 
between 
resource 
occurrences 
and extraction 
costs. 
Corresponding model parameters are summarized in Table IV-
6. The cost coefficients of energy conversion technologies are 
basically extracted from the G L O B A L 2100 model (Manne 
and Richels, 1992). The basic values used in the case of the B2 
scenario are illustrated in Table IV-7, and important model 
parameters deployed for MARIA's other SRES scenario 
quantifications are shown in Table IV-8. Other energy-related 
cost parameters correspond to renewable energy sources, 
methanol and ethanol processes, nuclear fuel recycle, carbon 
sequestration, etc. They are described in more detail in Mori 
and Takahashi (1999). 
Intemational trade prices are generated by the Lagrange 
multipliers of the corresponding constraints as a feature of 
optimization models. The Negishi weight technique was

employed to assess the intemational equilibrium prices of 
tradable goods under the budget constraints (Negishi, 1972). 
Illustrative intemational energy trade prices for scenario B2 are 
summarized in Chapter 4 and are not repeated here. 
The Global Warming Subsystem in MARIA is based on 
Wigley's five-time constant 
model for the emission-
concentration mechanism. A two-level thennal reservoir model 
is also employed following the DICE model (Wigley, 1994; 
Nordhaus, 1994). Only global carbon emissions are cun-ently 
treated in this model component. 
MARIA'S Food and Land Use module serves to assess the 
potential contributions of biomass. A simplified food demand 
and land-use subsystem was included. Nutrition, calorie, and 
protein demand is a function of per capita income. Either directiy 
or via meat, crop and pasture supply these demands. Forests are 
a source of biomass and wood products, but also their function as 
a carbon sink is evaluated. The relationships among the above-
mentioned subsystems are shown in Figure IV-5. 
Since M A R I A is designed for macro-level evaluation of 
various options consistently, detailed information, such as 
gridded SO^ emissions, industrial structure change, and 
urbanization issues, is not generated. However, MARIA can 
provide long-term profiles of fuel mix changes and possible 
trade premiums under various scenarios. 
More detailed information can be obtained by referring to the 
following web site: http://shun-sea.ia.noda.sut.ac.jp/indexj.html. 
IV.6. 
The Mini Climate Assessment Model 
The Mini Climate Assessment Model (MiniCAM) is a small 
rapidly running Integrated Assessment Model that estimates 
global GHG emissions with the ERB model (Edmonds et a l . , 
1994, 1996a) and the agriculture, forestry and land-use model 
(Edmonds et a l . , 1996b). MiniCAM uses the Wigley and Raper 
MAGICC (Wigley and Raper, 1993) model to estimate climate 
changes, the Hulme et a l . (1995) SCENGEN tool to estimate 
regional climate changes, and the Manne et a l . (1995) damage 
functions to examine the impacts of climate change. MiniCAM, 
developed by the Global Change Group at Pacific Northwest 
Laboratory, undergoes regular enhancements. Recent changes 
include the addition of an agriculture land-use module and the 
capability to estimate emissions of all the Kyoto gases. 
At present the model consists of 11 regions (USA, Canada, 
Western Europe, Japan, Australia, Eastern Europe and the 
Former Soviet Union, Centrally Planned Asia, the Mid-East, 
Africa, Latin America, and South and East Asia) that provide 
complete world coverage (see Table IV-1), A 14-region version 
is nearing completion. 
MiniCAM uses a straightforward population times labor 
productivity process to estimate aggregate labor productivity 
levels. The resultant estimate of GNP is corrected for the 
impact of changes in energy prices using GNP/energy 
elasticity. For the scenario exercise, an extended economic 
activity level process was developed to allow a clearer 
understanding of the potential impacts of the new population 
scenarios. First, a detailed age breakdown was included so 
working age populations could be computed. Second, a labor 
force participation rate was added to estimate the labor force, 
and third an external process was created to estimate the long-
term evolution of the rate of labor productivity increase. 
ERB is a partial equilibrium model that uses prices to balance 
energy supply and demand for the seven major primary energy 
categories (coal, oil, gas, nuclear, hydro, solar, and biomass) in 
the eleven regions in the model. 
The energy demand module initially estimates demands for 
three categories of energy services (residential/commercial, 
industrial, and transportation) as a function of price and 
income. Energy services are provided by four secondary fuels 
(solids, liquids, gases, and electricity). Demand for the 
secondary fuels depends upon their relative costs and the

evolution of the end-use technologies, represented by the 
improvement in end-use energy efficiency. Demand for 
primary fuels is determined by the relative costs of 
transfoiming them into the secondary fuels. Nuclear, solar, and 
hydro are directly consumed by the electricity sector, while 
coal and biomass can be transformed into gas and liquids if the 
fossil oil and gas become too expensive or run out. Hydrogen 
has recently been added to the model, and it, like refined gas 
and oil, can be used to generate electricity or as a secondary 
fuel for the three final demand sectors. 
The energy supply sector provides both renewable (hydro, 
solar, and biomass) and non-renewable (coal, oil, gas, and 
nuclear) resources. The cost of the fossil resources relates to 
the resource base by grade, the cost of production (both 
technical and environmental), and to historical production 
capacity. The introduction of a graded resource base for fossil 
fuel allows the model to test explicitly the importance of fossil 
fuel resource constraints as well as to represent unconventional 
fuels such as shale 
oil and methane hydrates. 
For 
unconventional fuels only small amounts are available at low 
costs, but large amounts are potentially available at high cost, 
or after extensive technology development. Fuel-specific rates 
of technical change are available for primary fuel production 
and conversion, as are technical change coefficients for each 
category of electricity production. 
Biomass is supplied by the agriculture sector, and provides the 
link between the agriculture, forestry, and land-use module and 
the energy module. The former module estimates die allocation 
of land to one of five activities (crops, pasture, forestty, modern 
biomass, and other) in each region. This allocation reflects the 
relative profitability of each of these uses. Profitability is 
determined by the prices for crops, livestock, forest products, 
and biomass, which reflect regional demand and supply 
functions for each product. There are separate technical change 
coefficients for crops, livestock/pasture, forestry, and modem 
biomass production. 
Once the model has reached equilibrium for a period, 
emissions of GHGs are computed. For energy, emissions of 
CO,, CH4, and N2O reflect fossil fuel use by type of fuel, while 
agriculture emissions of these gases reflect land-use change, 
the use of fertilizer, and the amount and type of livestock 
produced. The high global warming gases (chlorofluoro-
carbons, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons, and 
perfluorocarbons) are esfimated only for each category and not 
by their individual components. Sulfur emissions are estimated 
as a function of fossil fuel use and reflect sulfur controls, the 
effectiveness of which is determined by a Kuznets curve that 
relates control levels to per capita income. 
The emissions estimates are aggregated to a global level and 
used as inputs to MAGICC to produce estimates of GHG 
concentrations, changes in radiative forcing, and consequent 
changes in global mean temperature. The global mean 
temperature change is used to drive SCENGEN-derived 
changes in climate pattems and to produce estimates of 
regional change in temperature, precipitation, and cloud cover. 
Finally, the regional changes in temperature are used to 
estimate market and non-market based damages. Developing-
region damage functions produce higher damages than those

Database Description 
The SRES Emission Scenario Database (ESD) was developed 
to manage and access a large number of data sets and emissions 
scenarios documented in the literature. The SRES Terms of 
Reference call for the assessment of emissions scenarios in the 
literature (see Appendix I). The database was developed for 
SRES by the National Institute for Environmental Studies 
(NIES) of Japan and can be accessed via the ftp site www-
cger.nies.go.jp/cger-e/db/ipcc.html. This section summarizes 
the database structure and the data collection for the database. 
Chapter 2 gives further detail about the quantitative assessment 
of the scenarios in the database. At the time of writing the 
database included 416 scenarios from 171 sources. 
V.l. 
Database Structure 
The main purpose behind the development of the new database 
is to make it easier to manage and utilize the vast amounts of 
data related to emission scenarios of greenhouse gases 
(GHGs), which include carbon dioxide (CO,), nitrous oxide 
(NjO), methane (CH^), sulfur oxides (SO^^), and related gases, 
(such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (N0^), and 
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). The need for such a database is a 
function of both the increasing number of emission scenarios 
(because of increasing political and research interests in this 
topic) and the necessity to identify the strengths and 
weaknesses of current scenarios (to allow research to be 
focused on the most crucial or under-investigated areas). 
These emission scenarios have been quantified mainly using 
computer simulation models, which in tum utilize many 
assumptions on factors such as population growth, gross 
domestic product (GDP) growth, technology efficiency 
improvements, land-use changes, and the energy resource base. 
The assumptions used in incorporating these factors often 
differ between simulations, as do the actual factors represented 
in the simulations. As a result, the database was designed to 
organize and store the input assumptions behind the scenarios 
as well as GHG emissions and other output. 
Given the diversity of data types that must be accommodated, 
the database was designed with a relational database structure 
(using MS Access '97). The data represent large samples, and 
it is important that they be stored according to a stracture that 
also allows the relationships between different data types to be 
represented and stored. A detailed description of the database 
stracture is given in Morita and Lee (1998). 
Each individual data entry is stored in the DATAMOM. Using 
the relational stracture, it is possible to call data from within 
any of four main fields (Source ID, Scenario ID, Region ID, or 
Variable) using a number of subcategories specific to the 
individual fields. For example, the Source ID data entry field 
has the following subcategories: 
• 
Source ID (an abbreviated model or organization name 
with multiple data sets distinguished by the year of 
publication). 
• 
Authors (individual name or organization name). 
• 
Reference (publication in which the data are found). 
• 
Model (main simulation models). 
Category (of simulation model, such as bottom-up or 
top-down, 
dynamic 
optimization 
of 
general 
equilibrium, etc.). 
Update date (of the most recent publication). 
Notes (if any). 
Table V-1 briefly summarizes the subdivisions in the other key 
fields. 
The database has the primary function of acting as a data 
storage tool, and as an interface that will allow the user easy 
access to the data sets contained therein. Thus, it only provides 
data, and analyses are conducted using other tools such as 
spreadsheets. However, the relational structure of the database 
makes it possible to call up comparable data sets across the key 
fields, giving maximum flexibility in manipulation, extraction, 
and presentation of all the data in the database. Similarly, there 
is great flexibility in importing new data, or making a data set 
from the database using combinations of specific sources, 
specific scenarios (or categories), specific regions, and specific 
variables. The extraction screen in Figure V-1, for example, 
shows the settings used to extract all information on all 
scenarios that are generated with the A I M Japan source model 
and to examine global sea level rise. 
The writing team recommends that this database or a new 
revised one should also be maintained by some institution in 
the future to facilitate comparisons and assessments of 
emissions scenarios. However, this would require additional 
resources. 
V.2. 
Data Collection 
The main sources of data used in ESD were Intemational 
Energy Workshop PoUs (Manne and Schrattenholzer, 1995, 
1996, 1997), Energy Modeling Foram (EMF-14 comparison 
studies) data, the previous database compiled for the IPCC 
Supplement Report, "Climate Change 1994" (Alcamo et a l , 
1995), which examined emission scenarios produced prior to 
1994, and individual emission scenarios collected by the SRES 
writing team. The current database used in this report includes 
the results of a total of 416 scenarios from 171 sources. Most 
of these scenarios date after 1994. 
Most of the total of 416 scenarios focus on energy-related CO2 
emissions (256). Only three models estimated land-use related 
emissions - the ASF model, the IMAGE 2 model, and the AIM 
model. Very few scenarios considered global SO2 emissions.

Process 
Open Process 
The Terms of Reference of this Special Report on Emissions 
Scenarios (SRES) include a so-called "open process" to 
stimulate input from a community of experts much broader 
than the writing team (see Appendices I and П). IPCC 
documents should take into account as many scientific 
perspectives as possible. This is particularly important in the 
area of scenarios, for which views on the plausibility of various 
aspects of the described futures and their interactions can differ 
between regions, between different sectors of society, and 
between 
individual 
experts. 
The 
SRES 
web 
site 
(sres.ciesin.org) was created to facilitate the open process and 
to help gain input from a community of expeits much broader 
than the writing team. 
The web site: 
Includes a description of SRES acdvhies and the 
scenaiio development process. 
Provides detailed information on the four marker 
scenarios and their storylines. 
• 
Offers facilities to view and plot scenario driving forces 
and emissions. 
• 
Offers facilities to receive feedback from the open 
process. 
The open process lasted from June 1998 to January 1999. As a 
result of the interest in SRES scenarios, the web site is 
accessible to acquire updated information about SRES marker 
scenarios. For other reasons and the input received so far, the 
information on the web site has been improved and updated 
considerably. The writing team recommends that the web site 
also be maintained in the future so that it is available to access 
updated infonnation on SRES scenarios. However, this will 
require additional resources. 
The four marker scenarios were posted on the IPCC web site 
(sres.ciesin.org) in June 1998. The submissions invited through 
the open process and web site fell into three categories: 
Additional scenarios published in the reviewed 
literature that had not been included in the scenario 
database (see Appendix V). 
New scenarios based on the SRES marker scenarios. 
General suggestions to improve the work of the SRES 
writing team as posted on the web site (preferably 
based on referenced literature). 
The submissions were used to revise the marker scenarios and 
to develop additional alternatives within each of the four 
scenario families. The result is a more complete, refined set of 
new scenarios that reflects the broad spectrum of modeling 
approaches and regional perspectives. The preliminary 
scenarios posted on the web site were provided to climate 
modelers also, with the approval of the IPCC Bureau.

Most of the submissions received fall into the first two 
categories above. Altogether, more than 34,000 accesses to the 
SRES web site were registered by April 1999 from some 3,000 
unique hosts that were connected. Tables VI-1 and VI-2 and 
Figure VI-1 give more detail about the number of monthly 
accesses between July 1998 and March 1999 and about 
accesses from different countries and temtories during the 
same period. Tables VI-3 and VI-4 give details of the 
preliminary marker scenarios. 
The web site is managed by the Center for International Earth 
Science Information Network (CIESIN) in the US, in 
collaboration with the Energy Research Foundation (ECN) in 
the Netherlands, the Technical Support Unit (TSU) of Working 
Group III on Mitigation of IPCC at the National Institute of 
Public Health and Environment (RIVM) in the Netherlands, 
and the Intemational Institute for Applied Systems Analysis 
(IIASA) in Austria.

' The IMAGE-results for the A2 and B2 scenarios are based on prehtninary model experiments carried out in March 1998. As a consequence 
of limited resources it has not been possible to rerun these experiments. Hence, the IMAGE team is not able to provide background data and 
details for these scenario calculations and the population and economic growth assumptions are not fully harmonized, as they have been for 
the IMAGE A l and B l scenarios.

Afforestation 
The act or process of establishing a forest, especially on land 
not previously forested. 
Alternative Energy 
Energy derived from non-fossil fuel sources. 
Anthropogenic Emissions 
Emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) associated with 
human activities. These include buming of fossil fuels for 
energy, deforestation, and land-use changes. 
Annex I Countries 
Annex I to the Climate Convention (UNFCCC) lists all the 
countries in the Organization of Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD), plus countries with economies in 
transition, Central, and Eastern Europe (excluding the former 
Yugoslavia and Albania). By default the other countries are 
refeixed to as Non-Annex I countries. Under Article 4.2 (a&b) 
of the Convention, Annex I countries commit themselves 
specifically to the aim of returning individually or jointly to 
their 1990 levels of GHG emissions by the year 2000. 
Annex П Countries 
Annex II to the Climate Convention lists all countries in the 
OECD. Under Article 4.2 (g) of the Convention, these 
countries are expected to provide financial resources to assist 
developing countries comply with their obligations such as 
preparing national reports. Annex II countries are also 
expected to promote the transfer of environmentally sound 
technologies to developing countries. 
Annex В Countries 
Annex В in the Kyoto Protocol lists those developed 
countries that have agreed to a target for their GHG 
emissions, including those in the OECD, Central and Eastem 
Europe, and the Russian Federation. Not quite the same but 
similar to Annex I, which also includes Turkey and Belarus, 
while Annex В includes Croatia, Monaco, Liechtenstein, and 
Slovenia. 
Baseline 
A projected level of future emissions against which 
reductions by project activities could be determined. 
Base Year 
A common year for calculating emission inventories or to 
begin model simulations for future scenarios. 
Biofuel 
A fuel produced from dry organic matter or combustible oils 
produced by plants. Examples of biofuel include alcohol (from 
fermented sugar), black liquor from the paper manufacturing 
process, wood, and soybean oil. 
Biomass 
The total dry organic matter or stored energy content of living 
organisms. Biomass can be used for fuel directly by burning 
it (e.g., wood), indirectly by fermentation to an alcohol (e.g., 
sugar), or by extraction of combustible oils (e.g., soybeans). 
Carbon Cycle 
The natural processes that influence the exchange of carbon 
(in the form of carbon dioxide (CO,), carbonates and organic 
compounds, etc.) among the atmosphere, ocean, and 
teirestrial systems. Major components include photosynthesis, 
respiration, and decay between atmospheric and terrestrial 
systems (approximately 100 biUion tons/year (gigatons)); 
thermodynamic invasion and evasion between the ocean and 
atmosphere, operation of the carbon pump and mixing in the 
deep ocean (approx. 90 billion tons/year). Deforestation and 
fossil fuel burning releases approximately 7 Gt into the 
atmosphere annually. The total carbon in the reservoirs is 
approximately 2000 Gt in land biota, soil, and detritus, 750 
Gt in the atmosphere, and 38,000 Gt in the oceans. (Figures 
from IPCC WGI Scientific Assessment 1990.) 
Carbon Dioxide 
A naturally occurring gas, CO^ is also a by-product of 
buming fossil fuels and biomass, as well as land-use changes 
and other industrial processes. It is the principal 
anthropogenic GHG that affects the earth's temperature. It is 
the reference gas against which other GHGs are measured 
and therefore has a "Global Warming Potential" (GWP) of 1. 
Carbon Sequestration 
The long-term storage of carbon or CO2 in the forests, soils, 
ocean, or underground in depleted oil and gas reservoirs, coal 
seams, and saline aquifers. Examples include the separation 
and disposal of COj from flue gases or processing fossil fuels 
to produce Hj- and C02-rich fractions, and the direct removal 
of CO2 from the atmosphere through land use change, 
afforestation, reforestation, ocean fertilization, and 
agricultural practices to enhance soil carbon. 
Carbon Sinks 
Natural or man-made systems that absorb COj from the 
atmosphere and store them. Trees, plants, and the oceans all 
absorb CO2 and, therefore, are carbon sinks. 
CFCs 
See "Chlorofluorocarbons". 
See "Methane". 
G l o s s a r y of 
Terms

Chlorofluorocarbons 
Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are GHGs covered under the 
1987 Montreal Protocol and used for refrigeration, air 
conditioning, packaging, insulation, solvents, or aerosol 
propellants. As they are not desti'oyed in the lower 
atmosphere, CFCs drift into the upper atmosphere where, 
given suitable conditions, they break down ozone. These 
gases are being replaced by other compounds, including 
hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons 
(HFCs), which are GHGs covered under the Kyoto Protocol. 
Climate Change ( U N F C C C 
d e f i n i t i o n )

to human activity that alters the composition of the global 
atmosphere and that is in addition to natural climate 
variability over comparable time periods. 
Climate Convention 
See "UN Framework Convention on Climate Change". 
Climate Models

mathematically simulate global climate. They are based on 
mathematical equations derived from our knowledge of the 
physics that governs the earth-atmosphere system. 
Co-generation

exhaust from gas turbines, for either industrial puiposes or 
district heating. 
Commercialization 
Sequence of actions necessary to achieve market entry and 
general 
market

new 
innovative 
technologies, processes, and products.

The supreme body of the U N Framework Convention on 
Climate Change (UNFCCC), comprises countries that have 
ratified or acceded to the Framework Convention on Climate 
Change. The first session of the Conference of the Parties 
(COP-1) was held in Berlin in 1995, COP-2 in Geneva 1996, 
COP-3 in Kyoto 1997, and COP-4 in Buenos Aires. COP-5 
will be held in Bonn. 
CO2 
See "Carbon Dioxide". 
Cost-effective 
A criterion that specifies that a technology or measure 
delivers a good or service at equal or lower cost than current 
practice, or the lowest cost ahemative for the achievement of 
a given target. 
Decarbonization 
A decrease in the specific carbon content of primary energy 
or of fuels. 
Deforestation 
The removal of forest stands by cutting and burning to provide 
land for agricultural purposes, residential or industrial building 
sites, roads, etc., or by harvesting the trees for building 
materials or fuel. 
Demand-Side Management 
Policies and programs designed to reduce consumer demand 
for electricity and other energy sources while maintaining (or 
even increasing) the services the energy use renders. It helps 
to reduce the need for constructing new power facilities. 
Dematerialization 
A decrease in the material intensity of economic activity in 
general, or of individual production processes and end-use 
applications. 
Economic Potential 
The portion of technical potential for GHG 
emissions

achieved cost-effectively in the absence of market barriers. 
The achievement of market potential requires additional 
poHcies and measures to break down market barriers. 
Emissions 
The release of GHGs and/or their precursors into the 
atmosphere over a specified area and period of time. 
Emissions Category 
The SRES Scenarios are grouped into four categories of 
cumulative CO^ emissions (all sources) between 1990 and 
2100: 
low, medium-low, medium-high, and high emissions. 
Each category contains scenarios with a range of different 
driving forces yet similar cumulative emissions. See also 
"(Scenario) Category." 
Emission Standard 
A level of emission that under law may not be exceeded. 
Energy Intensity 
This is the ratio of energy consumption to economic or 
physical output. At the national level, energy intensity is the 
ratio of total domestic primary energy consumption or final 
energy consumption to gross domestic product or physical 
output. 
FCCC 
See 'UN Framework Convention on Climate Change'. 
Final Energy 
Energy supplied that is available to the consumer to be 
converted into useful energy (e.g. electricity at the wall outlet). 
Fossil Fuels 
Carbon-based fuels, including coal, oil, and natural gas and 
their derived fuels such as gasoline, synthesis gas from coal, 
etc. 
592 
G l o s s a r y of 
Terms 
Fuel Switching 
Policy designed to reduce COj emissions by requiring electric 
utilities or consumers to switch from high-carbon to low-
carbon fuels (e.g. from coal to gas). 
GHGs 
See "Greenhouse Gases". 
GHG Reduction Potential 
Possible reductions in emissions of greenhouse gasses 
(quantified in terms of absolute reductions or in percentages 
of baseline emissions) that could be achieved through the use 
of technologies and measures. 
Global Warming 
The hypothesis that the earth's temperature is being 
increased, in part, because of emissions of GHGs associated 
with human activities, such as buming fossil fuels, biomass 
buming, cement manufacture, cow and sheep rearing, 
deforestation, and other land-use changes. 
Global Warming Potential 
A measurement technique to define the relative contribution 
of each GHG to atmospheric warming. A GWP can only be 
calculated for specified time horizons (e.g. 20 to 500 years) 
and for given GHG concentration levels (e.g. current). Both 
direct and indirect effects are considered. (Indirect effects 
include changes in atmospheric chemistry such as ozone 
formation and changes in stratospheric water vapor.) COj has 
been assigned a GWP of 1, against which all other GHGs are 
compared. For example, methane (CH^) has a GWP that is 
currently estimated to be about 21 times greater than that of 
over a 100 year time horizon, and thus CH^ has a GWP 
of 21. (Note that in the economic literature GWP usually 
denotes gross world product, referrred to as global GDP in 
this report.) 
Greenhouse Effect 
The trapping of heat by an envelope of naturally occurring 
heat-retaining gases (water vapour, CO2, nitrous oxide (NjO), 
CH4, and ozone) that keeps the earth about 30°C (60°F) 
warmer than if these gases did not exist. 
Greenhouse Gases 
Gases in the earth's atmosphere that absorb and re-emit 
infrared radiation. These gases occur through both natural and 
human-influenced processes. The major GHG is water 
vapour. Other GHGs include COj, N2O, CH^, ozone, and 
CFCs. 
Gridding 
The provision of emission or socio-economic activity data in 
spatially highly explicit form. 
GWP 
See "Global Warming Potential". 
HFCs 
See "Hydrofluorocarbons". 
Harmonization 
A procedure to ease comparabifity of model results by 
adopting common (exogenous) input assumptions. Through 
harmonization, differences in emissions outcomes resulting 
from differences in model input assumptions (e.g. exogenous 
population growth) can be separated from differences that 
arise from different intemal model parametrizations (e.g. of 
the dynamics of technological change). The scenarios 
reported here can be classified into three categories: "fully 
harmonized" scenarios share population, GDP, and final 
energy use assumptions at the level of the four SRES regions 
(and hence also at the global level) between 1990 and 2100 
within prespecified bounds. "Globally harmonized" scenarios 
share global population and GDP assumptions at the global 
level for the 1990 to 2100 period within prespecified bounds 
(deviations in one 10-year interval are not considered). "Other 
scenarios" have adopted altemative assumptions for 
population and GDP than the ones suggested for scenario 
harmonization. 
Hydrofluorocarbons 
HFCs are among the six GHGs to be curbed under the Kyoto 
Protocol. They are produced commercially as a substitute for 
CFCs. HFCs are used largely in refrigeration and semi-
conductor manufacturing. Their GWPs range from 1300 to 
11,700 times that of CO2 (over a 100 year time horizon), 
depending on the HFC. 
Illustrative Scenario 
A scenario that is illustrative for each of the six scenario 
groups reflected in the Summary for Poticymakers of this 
report. They include four revised "scenario markers" for the 
scenario groups A I B , A2, B l and B2, and two additional 
scenarios for the A l F I and AIT groups. All scenario groups 
are equally sound. See also "(Scenario) Groups" and 
"(Scenario) Markers".

on entry into force, would require countries listed in its 
Annex В (developed nations) to meet differentiated reduction 
targets for their GHG emissions relative to 1990 levels by 
2008-2012. It was adopted by all Parties to the Climate 
Convention in Kyoto, Japan, in December 1997.

atmo,sphere, can be a constituent of smog and acts as a 
GHG. 
It is created naturally and also by reactions in the atmosphere 
that involve gases resulting from human activities, including 
nitrogen oxides (N0^^), from motor vehicles and power plants. 
The Montreal Protocol seeks to control chemicals that destroy 
ozone in the stratosphere (upper part of the atmosphere), 
where the ozone absorbs ultra-violet radiation. 
PAMs 
See "Policies and Measures". 
Perfluorocarbons 
Among the six GHGs to be abated under the Kyoto Protocol. 
Perñuorocarbons (PFCs) are a by-product of aluminum smelting

CFCs in manufacturing semiconductors. The GWP of PFCs is 
6500-9200 times that of CO2 (100 year time horizon). 
PFCs 
See ' Perñuorocarbons '. 
Policies and Measures 
In UNFCCC parlance, policies are actions that can be taken 
and/or mandated by a govemment - often in conjunction with 
business and industry within its own country, as well as with 
other countries - to accelerate the application and use of 
successful measures to curb GHG emissions. Measures are 
technologies, processes, and practices used to implement 
policies that, if employed, would reduce GHG emissions 
below anticipated future levels. Examples might include 
carbon or other energy taxes, standardized fuel efficiency

conversion or transformation. 
Quantified Emissions Limitations and Reductions 
Objectives 
Abbreviated to QELROs, these are the GHG emissions 
reduction commitments made by developed countries listed in 
Annex В of the Protocol. (See also "Targets and Timetables".) 
Regulatory Measures 
Rules or codes enacted by govemments that mandate product 
specifications or process performance characteristics. 
Renewables 
Energy sources that are, within a short timeframe relative to 
the earth's natural cycles, sustainable, and include non-carbon 
technologies such as solar energy, hydropower, and wind as 
well as carbon-neutral technologies such as biomass. 
Research, Development, and Demonstration 
Scientific/technical research and development of new 
production processes or products, coupled with analysis and 
measures that provide infomration to potential users regarding 
the application of the new product or process; demonstration 
tests, and feasibility of applying these products processes via 
pilot plants and other pre-commercial apphcations. 
Scenario 
A plausible description of how the future may develop, based 
on a coherent and internally consistent set of assumptions 
("scenario logic") about key relationships and driving forces 
(e.g., rate of technology change, prices). Note that scenarios 
are neither predictions nor forecasts. 
(Scenario) Category 
The SRES Scenarios are grouped into four categories of 
cumulative CO^ emissions (all sources) between 1990 and 
2100: 
low, medium-low, medium-high, and high emissions. 
Each category contains scenarios with a range of different 
driving forces yet similar cumulative emissions. See also 
"Emissions Category". 
(Scenario) Family 
Scenarios that have a similar demographic, societal, economic 
and technical-change storyline. Four scenario families 
comprise the SRES scenario set: A l , A2, B l and B2. 
(Scenario) Group 
Scenarios within a family that reflect a consistent variation of 
the storyline. The A l scenaiio family includes four groups 
designated as AIT, AIC, 
A I G and AIB that explore 
alternative structures of future energy systems. In the 
Summary for Policymakers, the AIC and A I G groups have 
been combined into one "Fossil Intensive" A l F I scenario 
group. The other three scenario families consist of one group 
each. The SRES scenario set reflected in the SPM thus 
consists of six distinct scenario groups, all of which are 
equally sound and together capture the range of uncertainties 
associated with driving forces and emissions. 
(Scenario) Marker 
A scenario that was originally posted in draft fomt on the 
SRES website to represent a given scenario family. The 
choice of markers was based on which of the initial 
quantifications best reflected the storyline, and the features of 
specific models. Markers are no more likely than other 
scenarios, but are considered by the SRES writing team as 
illustrative of a particular storyline. They are included in 
revised form in this report. These scenarios have received the 
closest scrutiny of the entire writing team and via the SRES 
open process. Scenarios have also been selected to illustrate 
the other two scenario groups (see also "Scenario Group" and 
"Illustrative Scenario". 
(Scenario) Set 
A set of scenarios developed using a particular méthodologie 
approach. The SRES scenario set comprises 40 scenarios 
grouped into four scenario families, seven (six in the 
SPM) 
scenario groups and four (cumulative CO,) emissions 
categories. 
(Scenario) Storyline 
A narrative description of a scenario (or a family of 
scenarios) highlighting the main scenario characteristics, 
relationships between key driving forces and the dynamics of 
their evolution.

Standardization 
Adopting standardized numerical values to improve model and 
scenario comparability. In this report, emissions are 
standardized for the two reporting years 1990 and 2100 across 
all models and scenarios, and individual scenario differences 
thereafter are corrected for differences between original model 
outputs and standardized values ("offsets"). (Base year 
differences reflect scientific uncertainty in source/sink strengths 
for many GHGs as well as differences in model calibration and 
simulation time horizons, e.g. for some models 1990 is a 
projected year as simulations begin by an earlier base year. 
See "Sulfur Hexafluoride". 
Sinks ( U N F C C C

Structural Change 
Changes, for example, in the relative share of GDP produced 
by the industrial, agricultural, or services sectors of an 
economy; or (more generally) systems transformations 
whereby some components are either replaced or potentially

Sulfur Hexafluoride 
One of the six GHGs to be curbed under the Kyoto Protocol. 
Sulfur hexafluoride (SF^) is largely used in heavy industry to 
insulate high-voltage equipment and to assist in the 
manufacturing of cable-cooling systems. Its GWP 
is 23,900 
times that of C O ^ (100 year time horizon). 
Targets and Timetables (see also QELROs) 
A target is the reduction of a specific percentage of 
GHG 
emissions (e.g., 6%, 7%) from a baseline date (e.g., "below 
1990 levels") to be achieved by a set date, or, timetable (e.g., 
2008-2012). For example, under the Kyoto Protocol's 
formula, the E U has agreed to reduce its GHG emissions by 
8% below 1990 levels by the 2008-2012 commitment period. 
These targets and timetables are, in effect, a cap on the total 
amount of GHG emissions that can be emitted by a country 
or region in a given time period. 
Technical Potential 
The amount by which it is possible to reduce GHG 
emissions 
or improve energy efficiency by using a technology or practice 
in all applications in which it could technically be adopted, 
without consideration of its costs or practical feasibility. 
Technology 
A systems of means towards particular ends that includes both 
hardware and social information, e.g. a piece of equipment or 
a technique for performing a particular activity. 
Trace Gas 
A minor constituent of the atmosphere. The most important 
trace gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect are COj, 
ozone, CH4, NjO, ammonia, nitric acid, ethylene, sulfur 
dioxide (SO2), nitric oxide, CFCs, HFCs HCFCs, SFg, methyl 
chloride, carbon monoxide, and carbon tetrachloride. 
UN Framework Convention on Climate Change 
(UNFCCC) 
A treaty signed at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro 
by more than 150 countries. Its ultimate objective is the 
"stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the 
atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous 
anthropogenic (human-induced) interference with the climate 
system". While no legally binding level of emissions is set, 
the treaty states an aim by Annex I countries to return these 
emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. The treaty took 
effect in March 1994 upon the ratification of more than 50 
countries; a total of some 160 nations have now ratified. In 
March 1995, the UNFCCC held the first session of the 
COP, 
the supreme body of the Convention, in Berlin. Its Secretariat 
is based in Bonn, Germany. In the biennium 2000-01, its 
approved budget and staffing level are approximately US$12 
million annually with approximately 80 personnel. 
Values 
Values are based on individual preferences, and the total 
value of any resource is the sum of the values of the different 
individuals involved in the use of the resource. The values 
that are the foundation of the estimation of costs are 
measured in terms of the willingness to pay (WTP) by 
individuals to receive the resource or by the willingness of 
individuals to accept payment (WTA) 
to part with the 
resource. 
Voluntary Measures 
Measures to reduce GHG 
emissions that are adopted by firms 
or other actors in the absence of govemment mandates. 
Voluntary measures help make climate-friendly products or 
processes more readily available or encourage consumers to 
incorporate environmental values in their market choices.
