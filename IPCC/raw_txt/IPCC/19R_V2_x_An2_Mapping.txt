Updates were made to provide clarification on treatment of biomass. Only main text in Section 2.3.3.4 was 
updated, and equations, tables, figures and boxes were not updated. 
Sections 
• 
Section 2.3.3.4 was updated to provide additional clarification on the treatment of biomass, consistent with 
Volume 1, Chapter 1, and also to provide a bullet noting the location in the AFOLU volume of clarification 
of the reporting of emissions from woody biomass combustion for energy.

FUGITIVE EMISSIONS 
For fugitive emissions from mining, processing, storage and transportation of coal, the 2019 Refinement includes 
guidance on emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from underground and surface mines.  
For fugitive emissions from oil and natural gas systems, the 2019 Refinement includes emission factors 
representative of current practice, including for unconventional oil and gas exploration, and methods and emission 
factors for abandoned wells.  
For fuel transformation, the 2019 Refinement includes a new section on fugitive emissions from fuel transformation, 
including methods for fugitive emissions from charcoal production, coke production, coal to liquids and gas to 
liquids.
