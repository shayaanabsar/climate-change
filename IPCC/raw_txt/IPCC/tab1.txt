HAVE ESTIMATED AND INCLUDED IN
THEIR INVENTORY.
REPORTING INSTRUCTIONS
Countries are urged to report data at least at the level of aggregation of
the Sectoral Tables.  The tables are based on the common source/sink
categories found in Chapter 1 - Understanding the Common Reporting
Framework of Volume 1 of the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines.  In the event
that country inventory methods differ drastically from IPCC methods and
cannot be converted immediately, it is requested that a hard copy of the
more detailed report be included with the submission, explaining the
subsectors that were used and where differences lie.
Please provide completed copies of all
Worksheets used to calculate the inventory.

emission factors) used to make these estimates.
