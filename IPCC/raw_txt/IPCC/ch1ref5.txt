Road Vehicles - Alternative Fuels
Alternative motor vehicle fuels such as natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG),
methanol and ethanol are presently being used in a limited way, and are the subjects of a
great deal of research and development effort aimed at increasing their usage in the
future. This section presents some preliminary estimates of the emissions to be expected
from vehicles using these fuels, based on fuel properties and the limited emissions data
available.20
Natural gas
Because natural gas is mostly methane, natural gas vehicles (NGVs) have lower exhaust
NMVOC emissions than gasoline vehicles, but higher emissions of methane.  There are no
evaporative or running-loss emissions, while refuelling emissions and cold-start emissions
are lower.  These conditions reduce both NMVOC and CO emissions relative to gasoline
vehicles.  CO2 emissions from NGVs will be lower than for gasoline vehicles, since natural
gas has a lower carbon content per unit of energy.  It is possible to attain increased
efficiency by increasing the compression ratio.  Optimised heavy-duty NGV engines can
approach diesel efficiency levels.  NOx emissions from uncontrolled NGVs may be higher
or lower than comparable gasoline vehicles, depending on the engine technology.  NOx
emissions from NGVs are more difficult to control using three-way catalysts.  N2O
emissions from NGVs were not included.
Table 1-43 shows three types of NGVs: passenger cars, gasoline-type heavy-duty vehicles,
and diesel-type heavy-duty vehicles.21  Two sets of emission factors are shown for each:
uncontrolled (typical of a simple natural gas conversion, without catalytic converter or
optimisation for emissions) and advanced control (reflecting an engine and catalytic
converter factory-produced and optimised for natural gas).  The estimates for the
passenger car and gasoline-type heavy-duty vehicle are based on a gasoline-type engine,
converted to use natural gas.  For the uncontrolled vehicles, no changes in the engine are
assumed beyond the fitting of a natural gas mixer and modified spark timing such that the
efficiency would be the same.  For the vehicles with advanced control, a higher
compression ratio is assumed to give 15 per cent better fuel efficiency.
For the diesel-type heavy-duty vehicles, the engine assumed is a diesel-type engine,
converted to lean, Otto-cycle operation using natural gas.  The uncontrolled case reflects
no further optimisation beyond the conversion, while the controlled case includes
extensive combustion optimisation for NOx control and an oxidation catalytic converter.
Liquefied petroleum gas
LPG is primarily propane (or a propane/butane mixture) rather than methane which
affects the composition of exhaust VOC emissions, but otherwise is similar to natural gas.
Evaporative and refuelling emissions are virtually zero, and CO and exhaust NMVOC
emissions are usually lower than gasoline vehicles.  The CO2 emissions should be
somewhat lower than gasoline, due to the lower carbon-energy ratio, and the higher
                                                  
     20 Actual emission levels from these vehicles may be very different, and further testing
is needed to confirm these estimates.
     21 The emissions considered are only those of the vehicle itself – additional emissions
due to, e.g., compression or liquefaction of gas for storage on the vehicle, leakage from
pipelines, etc. are not included, nor are the potential emissions credits due to,
e.g., production of methane from biomass. This is consistent with the treatment of
emissions from vehicles using oil-based fuels.

octane level allows some increase in efficiency, although less than for natural gas.  NOx
emissions from LPG vehicles tend to be higher than for gasoline, but can also be
controlled using three-way catalysts.  N2O emissions were not included.
Table 1-44 shows two types of LPG vehicles.  The engines and technologies considered
are the same as those for natural gas, except that the lean, diesel-derived natural gas
engine with propane is not considered.
Methanol and Ethanol
The two alcohols have similar properties, and are discussed together.  Development
efforts have focused primarily on mixtures of alcohols with gasoline, in flexible fuel
vehicles, capable of running on any combination of gasoline and up to 85 per cent
methanol or ethanol.  Engines and emission control systems are similar to those for
advanced-technology gasoline vehicles, and the overall energy efficiency and emissions
properties are similar.  Table 1-46 shows estimated emissions for a vehicle of this type
using M85 (85% methanol / 15% gasoline) fuel.  Also shown are some rough emissions
estimates for heavy-duty vehicles equipped with methanol or ethanol engines.

Emission factors are provided for major non-road vehicle source categories including
farm and construction equipment, railway locomotives, boats, and ships (all primarily
equipped with diesel engines), jet aircraft, and gasoline-fuelled piston aircraft.
Table 1-47 presents emission factors specific to the United States, but may be applicable
to other regions as well.  The emission factors for diesel engines used in railway
locomotives, farm equipment such as tractors and harvesters, construction equipment
such as bulldozers and cranes, and diesel boats, are from Weaver (1988).  N2O emission
factors for off-road diesels are assumed to be the same as those for heavy-duty on-
highway diesel engines.
Large ocean-going cargo ships are driven primarily by large, slow-speed and medium-
speed diesel engines, and occasionally by steam turbines and gas turbines (the latter in
high power-weight ratio vessels such as fast ferries and warships).  The number of vessels
equipped with steam or gas-turbine propulsion is small, however, since these vessels are
unable to compete with the more efficient diesels in most applications.  The results
shown for NOx and CO are from Hadler (1990)22.  N2O emissions for these engines
were assumed to be the same, on a fuel-specific basis, as those for other heavy-duty
diesels, and VOC emissions from these large diesels are probably negligible.
                                                  
     22 Other sources consulted for comparison are Melhus (1990), Bremnes (1990),
Alexandersson (1990).

A detailed experimental assessment of exhaust emissions from a broad cross section of
ship categories including bulk carriers, container ships, dredgers, ferries, tankers and tugs
has recently been completed by Lloyd’s Register (1995).  The vessels evaluated by Lloyd’s
Register were powered by in-service diesel engines of various vintages and sizes, and
tested without modification.
A total of sixty engines on fifty vessels were tested under steady-state conditions, and a
further eight vessels were tested under transient engine loads by Lloyd’s Register (1995).
Emission factors reported by Lloyd’s Register for medium and slow speed diesel engines
are considered to be the best available to date and have been adopted in this study (see
Table 1-48).
In the absence of data on the relative time spent under steady state versus transient
engine loads, steady state engine emission rates are adopted in this study for ocean-going
ships.  For detailed regional studies, it is recommended that surveys of engine type and
mode of operation be undertaken to establish fleet emission rates for non-CO2 gases.
For slow to medium speed diesel engines, considered to be representative of large ocean-
going cargo ships, Lloyd’s Register (1995) reported NOx emission rates of 57 and 87
kg/tonne of fuel, respectively.  In the absence of data on the fleet composition of slow
versus medium speed diesel engines for ocean going fleets, a NOx emission factor of 72

kg/tonne of fuel is recommended.  The corresponding emission rate documented by IPCC
(1995) was 87 kg/tonne of fuel.  Emission rates for CH4 and NMVOC for ocean-going
ships were not reported by IPCC (1995).  In this study, CH4 and NMVOC emission rates
are estimated from hydrocarbon (HC) data reported by Lloyd’s Register according to
CH4 = 0.12 x HC and NMVOC = HC - CH4.
Lloyd’s Register reported a CO emission rate of 7.4 kg/tonne of fuel for slow to medium
speed diesel engines.  In this study, the value of 7.4 kg CO/tonne of fuel is adopted for
slow to medium speed diesel engines on ocean-going ships.
Emission factors for small engines mainly used in pleasure crafts and small fishing boats
can be found in Table 1-49 under the heading “Inland waterways” for diesel engines as
well as for 2-stroke and 4-stroke gasoline engines.
The difference in emission rates noted above, illustrates the importance of characterising
fleet engine types and fuel use for regional scale emissions from marine and other non-
road sources.

Background information
While the emission factors for aircraft in the Tier 1 approach are fleet average factors for
NOx, CO and NMVOC as derived from global inventories compiled by NASA,
ECAC/ANCAT and others, this section presents a more refined Tier 2 method.  The
methodology includes four sub-activities:

(a) CORINAIR uses a round figure of 1000 metres (for 3000 feet) as the cut-off.
(b) LTO is short for the Landing and Take-Off cycle.
(c) SNAP codes refer to the joint EMEP/CORINAIR Methodology, used in Europe.
(d) Including further climbout from and descent to 914 metres (3000 feet) altitude.
Activities include all civil commercial use of airplanes consisting of scheduled and charter
traffic of passengers and freight.  This also includes taxiing.  Military and private aviation
activities are not included because respectively, it is unlikely that detailed information is
available and fuel usage is proportionately very small.  However, theoretically this method
could also be used for the estimation of the emissions of military aircraft.  In that case,
these emissions should be reported under 1A5 “Other” and not with domestic or
international aviation.
Operations of aircraft are divided into two parts:
• The Landing/Take-Off (LTO) cycle 23 which includes all activities near the airport that
take place under the altitude of 914 metres (3000 feet).  This includes engines running
idle, taxi-in and out, and climbing and descending under this altitude.  In aircraft
industry-related literature (e.g., the ICAO), the cut-off altitude is often 3000 feet
which corresponds to 914 metres.
• Cruise is defined as all activities that take place at altitudes above 914 metres
(3000 feet).  No upper limit is given.  This also includes further climb-out from and
descent to an altitude of 914 metres.
Activities
For the purposes of the emissions inventory a distinction is made between domestic and
international flights24.
                                                  
     23 Some statistics count either a landing or a take-off as one operation.  However it
is both one take-off and one landing, that together define one LTO-operation.
     24 If an aircraft goes from one airport in one country to another in the same country
and then leaves to a third airport in another country, the first flight stage is considered a
domestic trip while the second is considered an international trip.  It is not important
whether the airport is a domestic or an international airport.  In addition, the type of

• Domestic aviation (1 A 3 a ii) includes all civil domestic passenger and freight traffic
inside a country.  All flight stages between two airports in one country are considered
domestic no matter the nationality of the carrier or the subsequent destination of the
aircraft.
• International aviation (1 A 3 a i) includes all civil air traffic coming to or leaving a
country.  It is assumed that the number of out-bound flights equals the number of in-
bound flights.
• LTOs take the classification (domestic or international) of the flight stage to which
they belong.  As most flights are regarded as return flights, fuel used during landing
and take-off will be regarded as equal to a take-off and landing.
Techniques
In general, there exist two types of engines (Olivier, 1991):
• reciprocating piston engines, where energy is extracted from a combustion chamber by
means of a piston and crank mechanism which drives the propellers to give the
aircraft momentum;  and
• gas turbines, where compressed air is heated by combustion in a combustion chamber
and the major part of the released energy is used for propulsion of the aircraft.  Part
of the energy contained in the hot air flow is used to drive the turbine which in turn
drives the compressor.  Turbojet engines use energy only from the expanding exhaust
stream for propulsion, whereas turbofan and turboprop engines use energy to drive
an extra turbine which drives a fan or propeller respectively, for propulsion.
Emissions
Air traffic as a source of combustion emissions varies with respect to the type of fuel
which is being used, the location (altitude) of the exhaust gases, the types and the
efficiency of the engines, and the length of the flight.  Emissions come from jet kerosene
and aviation gasoline which are used as fuel on the aircraft.
This Tier 2 methodology is only applicable for jet fuel used in jet engines.  Aviation
gasoline is only used in small aircraft (often referred to as “general aviation”) and
generally represents less than 1 per cent of fuel consumption for aviation.  As a result, no
attempt has been made to estimate emission factors for private aviation as this represents
such a small proportion of global consumption.
Use of energy, and therefore emissions, is dependent on the aircraft operations and the
time spent at each stage25.  A substantial part of the fuel consumption takes place outside
                                                                                                                                
activity (LTO, cruise, domestic, international) is independent of the nationality of the
carrier. This treatment of domestic and international differs from that recommended to
states by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO,1994).  ICAO defines as
domestic all flight stages flown between domestic points by an airline registered in that
state and therefore excludes flights between domestic points by foreign airlines.
     25 Note:  The reference LTO cycle that was used to estimate the emission factors has
a cycle time of 32.9 minutes made up of the four individual Times in Mode (TIM)
according to ICAO recommendations.  Depending on whether there is more or less
congestion at the airport this time may be shorter or longer.  In particular, taxi times may
differ substantially between large metropolitan airports and small airports.  This can be

the LTO-cycle.  Studies indicate that in national airspace 60-80 per cent of NOx and
80-90 per cent of SO2 and CO2 is emitted at altitudes above 914 metres (3000 feet).  For
CO it is about 50 per cent and for VOC it is about 20-40 per cent (Olivier, 1991).
Globally, however, 80 to 90 per cent of these emissions are emitted above an altitude of
914 metres (3000 feet) (Olivier, 1995).
Besides the combustion of fuel in the LTO and cruise activities, fuelling and fuel handling
in general, maintenance of aircraft engines and fuel jettisoning to avoid accidents are
emission sources.  In the wintertime, anti-ice and de-ice treatment of wings and aircraft is
a source of emissions at airport complexes.  Many of the substances used flow off the
wings when planes are idling, taxiing, and taking off, and then evaporate.  These emissions
are, however, not included in the methodology.
Emission factors
For LTO cycles, Table 1-50 gives relevant examples from the ICAO Engine Exhaust
Emissions Databank (ICAO, 1995).  This provides emission factors for LTO cycles for  a
large number of engines treated under standard conditions.  Another useful source of
aircraft emission factors is the FAA Aircraft Emission database, US Office of Environment
and Energy (1991), derived from an early draft version of the ICAO database.
For cruise activities, average NOx emission factors related to fuel consumption have been
estimated and are displayed in Table 1-51.  The cruise emission factors take into account
the number of engines fitted to each specific aircraft.
Where aircraft types used in a country are not displayed in Tables 1-50 or 1-51, data for
the nearest equivalent type in either of those tables can be used or alternatively the
average emission factors displayed in Table 1-52 can be used.
Please note that when using the emission factors, the assumptions on sulphur content in
the fuel should be taken into account.  The factors have been calculated assuming a
weight percentage of 0.05 per cent26.  Actual values of sulphur content in jet kerosene
vary between 0.0001 and 0.3 per cent.
                                                                                                                                
calculated for  individual airports and individual aircraft as a Tier 3 methodology (see last
paragraph of Section 1.3).
     26 For example, if the sulphur content of fuel used is 0.01 per cent, the emission
factor for SO2 should be divided by 5 to show the corresponding factor.
