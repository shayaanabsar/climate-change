2. INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES
2.1 
Introduction
Greenhouse gas emissions are produced from a variety of industrial activities
which are not related to energy.  The main emission sources are industrial
production processes which chemically or physically transform materials.
During these processes, many different greenhouse gases, including CO2,
CH4, N2O, and PFCs, can be released.
In some instances, industrial process emissions are produced in combination
with fuel combustion emissions and it may be difficult to decide whether a
particular emission should be reported within the energy or industrial
emission sector. The criterion used to make this decision is discussed in the
Section 2.1 of the Reference Manual.
All emissions, including evaporative emissions, which occur in energy
transformation activities are discussed in the Energy Chapter.  Emissions
from petrochemical processes are, however, covered in this chapter.
Emissions of NMVOC from use of solvents are discussed in the chapter
“Solvents and other product use” even if they originate from an industrial
process.
CO2 from the use of biological carbon as feedstock and fermentation
processes should not be reported under “Industrial Processes”, or any other
sector of the IPCC Guidelines if they originate from sources of carbon that
are from a closed cycle.
Non-combustion industrial processes resulting in N2O emissions are
recognised as important anthropogenic contributors to global N2O
emissions.  It is estimated that this source category represents 10 to 50 per
cent of anthropogenic N2O emissions and 3 to 20 per cent of all global
emissions of N2O (IPCC, 1992).
HFCs, PFCs and SF6 are also emitted from industrial processes, such as
production of aluminium, magnesium and halocarbons (e.g., HCFC-22).  In
some countries PFC emissions from industrial processes could be an
important contributor to national GHG emissions due to their high GWPs.
Current and expected applications of these compounds include refrigeration
and air-conditioning, fire extinguishing, aerosols, solvents, and foam
production.  Consumption of HFCs, and to some extent PFCs and SF6, is
expected to grow substantially in the next decades due to their importance
as substitutes for ozone-depleting substances.
It is essential for a full understanding of the methodologies presented in this
workbook that inventory compilers read the related sections in Chapter 2
of the Reference Manual.
DOUBLE COUNTING
In situations where a country has
difficulty in distinguishing whether an
emission is energy, or industrial
based, to avoid double counting of
emissions, developers of emission
inventories should take care not to
include the same data in both
categories.

2.2 
General Methodology
The general methodology employed to estimate emissions associated with
each industrial process involves the product of activity level data, e.g.,
amount of material produced or consumed, and an associated emission
factor per unit of consumption/production according to:
TOTALij   =   Aj x EFij
where:
TOTALij
=
the process emission (tonnes) of gas i from
industrial sector j
Aj
=
the amount of activity or production of process
material in industrial sector j (tonnes/yr)
EFij
=
the emission factor associated with gas i per unit
of activity in industrial sector j (tonne/tonne)
A number of mathematical steps may be involved in reducing more complex
mathematical formulae to the simplified form of the equation above.  In
cases where mathematical transformations are involved, justifications are
presented in the reference manual.
For certain industrial processes, more than one estimation methodology is
presented here. The simplified approach is referred to as Tier 1, and the
more detailed methodology as Tier 2. Recognising that data availability is
often the main factor in estimating GHG emissions, several options are
provided for certain industrial processes under Tier 1, as Tier 1a, 1b, 1c.
More detailed discussion is given later.
D a t a  S o u r c e s
Often process emissions from certain industrial sectors are caused by
emissions from a few plants in each country for which measurement data
exist or may be collected. In these cases, emission estimates should be based
on such data instead of the more generalised methodology. Even if
measurements are not available, it is preferable to base calculation on plant-
specific data.
Many of the production data needed for emission estimation methods given
in this workbook are available from the United Nations (1988) and from the
US Bureau of Mines (1988) data sets. There is substantial overlap between
US Bureau of Mines and the UN data sets, but the former is more complete.
In some countries, national data may be available from appropriate
government ministries.  In Canada, for example, a national data base is
maintained by Statistics Canada.  Similar sources of standard production
statistics may be available from national statistical publications.

Cement Production
I n t r o d u c t i o n
Carbon dioxide is produced during the production of clinker, an
intermediate product from which cement is made.  High temperatures in
cement kilns chemically change raw materials into cement clinker.  In a
process called calcination or calcining, calcium carbonate is heated, forming
lime and carbon dioxide.
SO2 emissions will originate from sulphur in the fuel and in the clay raw
material. The fuel emissions are counted as energy emissions while the SO2
from the clay should be counted as non-combustion emissions.
D a t a  S o u r c e s
International cement production data are available from the United Nations
(1988) and from the US Bureau of Mines (1988).  A trade association,
European Cement Associations (CEMBUREAU) also publishes information
(see CEMBUREAU, 1990, World Cement Market in Figures and World
Statistical Review).  The Standard Nomenclature for Air Pollution (SNAP)
numbers for cement are 30311 and 40612 (EMEP/CORINAIR,1996).

Because CO2 is emitted during clinker production (rather than cement
production itself), emission estimates should be based on the lime content
and production of clinker. Clinker statistics, however, may not be readily
available in some countries.  If this is the case, cement production statistics
can be used.
Estimation of CO2 emissions from clinker production is accomplished by
applying an emission factor, in tonnes of CO2 released per tonne of clinker
produced, to the annual clinker output.

Estimation of SO2 emissions from cement production is accomplished by

of 0.3 kg SO2/tonne cement has been calculated (see the Revised 1996 IPCC
Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Reference Manual for
sources).

Lime Production
I n t r o d u c t i o n
The production of lime involves a series of steps comparable to those used
in the production of Portland cement clinker.  These include quarrying the
raw materials, crushing and sizing, calcining (i.e., high temperature heat
processing ~ 1100° C) the raw materials to produce lime, hydrating the lime
to calcium hydroxide followed by miscellaneous transfer, storage and
handling operations.
D a t a  S o u r c e s
International lime production data are available from the United Nations
(1988) and from the US Bureau of Mines (1988). The Standard

D a t a  S o u r c e s
International Limestone and Dolomite production data are available from the

Estimation of CO2 emissions from limestone use is accomplished by applying
an emission factor, in kilograms of CO2 released per tonne of limestone, to
the annual limestone use.
Consumption of limestone or dolomite in tonnes per year is assumed to
equal material mined (or dredged) plus material imported minus material
exported.  Limestone or dolomite used for producing cement, lime and
magnesium, agricultural activities and processes where CO2 is not generated
should be excluded from this calculation.

Soda Ash Produc t ion and Use
I n t r o d u c t i o n
Carbon dioxide is emitted from the use of soda ash, and may be emitted
during production, depending on the industrial process used to manufacture
it.
Emissions of CO2 from the production of soda ash vary substantially with
the manufacturing process.  Four different processes may be used
commercially to produce soda ash.  Three of these processes, monohydrate,
sesquicarbonate and direct carbonation, are referred to as natural processes.
The fourth, the Solvay process, is classified as a synthetic process.
During the production process, trona (the principal ore from which natural
soda ash is made) is calcined in a rotary kiln and chemically transformed into
a crude soda ash.  Carbon dioxide and water are generated as by-products
of this process.
D a t a  S o u r c e s
International soda ash production and use data are available from the United
Nations (1988) and from the US Bureau of Mines (1988).  Soda ash
production and use is not included in the Standard Nomenclature for Air
Pollution (SNAP) (EMEP/CORINAIR, 1996).
DOUBLE COUNTING
In order to avoid double counting,
CO2 emissions associated with the
use of coke in soda ash production
should be accounted for separately
and those emissions associated with
the 
non-energy 
use 
of 
coke
subtracted from the totals in the

Ammonia Production
I n t r o d u c t i o n
In most instances, anhydrous ammonia is produced by catalytic steam
reforming of natural gas (mostly CH4) or other fossil fuels.  Natural gas is
used as the feedstock in most plants, while other fuels (e.g., heavy oils) may
be used with the partial oxidation process.  Hydrogen is chemically
separated from the fuel and combined with nitrogen to produce ammonia
(NH3).  The remaining carbon is eventually emitted as CO2.
Emissions of NOx, NMVOC, CO and SO2 may also occur during ammonia
production.

D a t a  S o u r c e s
There will usually be only a few ammonia plants in a country, and it is
recommended that emissions be estimated based on plant specific data
and/or point source methods.  International production data are available
from the United Nations (1988) and from the US Bureau of Mines (1988).
The Standard Nomenclature for Air Pollution (SNAP) number for ammonia
production is 40403 (EMEP/CORINAIR, 1996).

f o r  
E s t i m a t i n g
E m i s s i o n s  o f  C O 2
Emissions of CO2 will depend on the amount and composition of gas (or oil)
used in the process.  It is assumed that all carbon will be emitted to the
atmosphere.
The most accurate method of estimation will be based on the consumption
of gas.  The carbon content of natural gas may vary, and it is recommended
that this be determined for each plant.  For example, data from Canada (see
the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories
Reference Manual for sources) provide the values 812 m3 gas/tonne NH3 and
0.525 kg carbon/m3 gas.
If the gas consumption is not available, an alternative is to calculate the
emissions from the ammonia production.  The recommended emission
factor is 1.5 tonnes CO2 per tonne NH3 produced which excludes gas used
as a fuel (see the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas
Inventories Reference Manual for sources).  Gas used as a fuel must be
excluded if other data are going to be used for emission factors. This figure
depends on the carbon content in the feedstock.
The CO2 from ammonia production may also be used for producing urea or
dry ice.  This carbon will only be stored for a short time.  Therefore, no
account should consequently be taken for intermediate binding of CO2 in
downstream manufacturing processes and products.

Nitric Acid Production
I n t r o d u c t i o n
The production of nitric acid (HNO3) generates nitrous oxide (N2O) as a
by-product of the high temperature catalytic oxidation of ammonia (NH3).
D a t a  S o u r c e s
There are usually only a few plants in each country producing nitric acid, so
measured data on emissions are often available.  These data also take into
account the effect of any abatement technology installed at the specific
plants. The Standard Nomenclature for Air Pollution (SNAP) number for
nitric acid production is 40402 (EMEP/CORINAIR, 1996).

Nitric acid is produced from the catalytic oxidation of ammonia. In addition
to the N2O emissions described previously, there may be non-combustion
emissions of NOx.
Emissions are estimated from the amount of nitric acid produced. The
emission factor is multiplied by the production of nitric acid.  Table 2-6
provides estimates of emission factors for NOx.  A value of 12.0 kg
NOx/tonne nitric acid should be used where the process and technology
details are not known.

from 
a
cyclohexanone/cyclohexanol mixture oxidised by nitric acid.  N2O is
generated as a by-product of the oxidation stage.
Adipic acid production also results in emissions of NOx, NMVOC and CO.
Process emissions from the production of adipic acid vary substantially with
the level of emission control employed.
D a t a  S o u r c e s
International production data are available from the United Nations (1988)
and from the US Bureau of Mines (1988). The Standard Nomenclature for
Air Pollution (SNAP) number for adipic acid production is 40521

In the production of silicon carbide, CO2 is released as a by-product from a
reaction between quartz and carbon.  Petrol coke is used as a carbon
source.  A typical emission factor based on Norwegian plants, is 2.3 tonnes
CO2/tonne coke.

The petrol coke used in this process may contain volatile compounds which
will form CH4.  Some of this CH4 will escape to the atmosphere, particularly
during start up.  Measurements at Norwegian plants suggest emission factors
of 10.2 kg CH4/tonne petrol coke or 11.6 kg CH4/tonne carbide product.

Calcium carbide is made by heating calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and
subsequently reducing lime (CaO) with carbon (e.g., petrol coke).  Both
steps lead to emissions of CO2.
The emission factors in Table 2-8 are suggested for estimating emissions.
Emissions may be calculated from the use of raw materials (limestone and
coke).  Limestone contains about 98 per cent CaCO3.  1750 kg limestone
(or 950 kg CaO) and 640 kg reducing agent (including 20 kg carbon
electrodes) are required to produce 1 tonne of carbide.
