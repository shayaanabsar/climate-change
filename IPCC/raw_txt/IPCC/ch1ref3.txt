In addition, wood stoves (where there is a great variation in technology by geographic
region) may have particularly high emissions rates of NMVOC due to their largely
inefficient combustion of fuel.
The NMVOC emissions from mobile sources are a function of the amount of
hydrocarbons passing unburnt through the engine.  This depends on engine type, fuel
used, use of post-combustion emission controls (e.g., catalytic converters) and driving
regime. The emissions are generally highest at low speeds and when the engine is idle.
Poorly tuned engines may have a particularly high output of hydrocarbon compounds.
NMVOC evaporative emissions from gasoline mobile sources should be accounted for
here.
The general method for estimating  NMVOC can be described as:
Emissions =  ∑ (EFab x Activityab)
where:
EF
= Emission Factor (kg/TJ);
Activity
= Energy Input (TJ);
a
= Fuel type;  and
b
= Sector-activity.
Due to large differences in emission factors for various sectors, fuel consumption must be
allocated to the IPCC main activity groups.
Extensive NMVOC emission factor data are available for most of the fuel combustion
sources.  The following default emission factors have been developed by the IPCC based
on the CORINAIR90 database, Radian (1990), US EPA (1995), the EDGAR Version 2.0
database, and National Communications to the FCCC.  The aggregated emission factors
in this table allow a rough estimation of NMVOC emissions.

Sulphur dioxide is not a “greenhouse gas” but its presence in the atmosphere may
influence climate.  SO2 can react with a variety of photochemically produced oxidants to
form sulphate aerosols.  The concentration of these particles is increasing due to the
burning of fossil fuels which contain sulphur.  Over limited regions of the northern
hemisphere, the effect of these particles is comparable in size, although opposite in effect,
to that of human generated greenhouse gases up to the present time.  Any effect of
sulphur dioxide emissions on climate change can be expected to be strongly regional in
character - but studies of this with climate models need to be carried out (Houghton,
1994).  Although SO2 is not a direct greenhouse gas, it is an aerosol precursor and as
such, has a cooling effect on climate.
Anthropogenic SO2 emissions world-wide amount to 70-80 million tonnes per year
(Mt/y) (Vernon and Jones, 1993).  This compares with natural emissions of 18-70 Mt/y
(IPCC, 1992).  There is, however, a paucity of information on the relative contribution of
sulphur emissions arising from combustion, due to lack of detailed information on the
sulphur level of the fuel consumed.  More than 80 per cent of anthropogenic SO2 arises
from fuel combustion, with three-quarters of this arising from coal (Vernon, 1990).  At
present an estimated 10 Mt/y of coal-related SO2 emissions are removed by flue-gas
desulphurisation technology world-wide (Ando, 1992).

where:

The emissions of sulphur oxides (SOx) are directly related to the sulphur content of the
fuel, which for coal can vary from below 0.5 to over 10 per cent by weight.  The majority
of coals currently in use are in the range 0.5 to 3 per cent.  Generally the “southern
hemisphere” coals contain less sulphur than “northern hemisphere” coals.
For fuel oil (including heavy fuel oil) sulphur content varies from 0.3 to over 5 per cent.
Lighter products may contain minimal sulphur (<0.3 per cent), whilst heavy fuel oil can
contain from up to 3-5 per cent sulphur.  Currently the world average sulphur content of
crude oil is around 1.3 per cent, although there are considerable variations between
different sources (Vernon and Jones, 1993).
The sulphur content of gas is usually negligible.

Sulphur appears in coal as pyritic sulphur (FeS2), organic sulphur, sulphur salts and
elemental sulphur.  Pyritic and organic sulphur account for the vast majority of sulphur in
coal and both types are responsible for SOx formation.  The sulphur is released when the
coal is burnt, mainly oxidised to SO2.  Usually less than 1-2 per cent of the total sulphur is
released as SO3.

If abatement technologies for SOx emissions reduction are used, the estimated emission

Detailed Methods (Tiers 2 and 3) for Fuel
Combustion
1 . 5 . 1 O v e r v i e w
Identification and quantification of greenhouse gas emissions by source category and
economic sector, together with a sound understanding of plant combustion conditions,
are essential for the study of abatement procedures and the formulation of abatement
policy options.  Equally, assessment of the effects of emissions on the atmosphere and
climate requires detailed data on the magnitude and spatial distribution of pollutant
emissions.  Both sets of requirements are served by the estimation of emissions from
combustion activities categorised by plant types at a level of detail for which an emission
factor can be reasonably narrowly specified.  Studies of the products of combustion from
many types of plant under different operating conditions have resulted in a growing
database of emission factors linking the emission rate to the activity.  Estimation
methodologies using these emission factors are described and discussed in this section.
In what follows, the emission sources are grouped into stationary and mobile sources and
representative emission factors for them are assembled for use in a simple formula
common to the majority of cases.  The distinction between Tier 1 methods and those of
Tiers 2 and 3 rests mainly on the reliance of the first on widely available fuel supply data
which, by its nature, takes no account of the combustion technology to which the fuel is
delivered.  Distinguishing between Tiers 2 and 3 is less easily done as there is a steadily
increasing degree of refinement and detail in the emissions estimation process as the
methods are developed from one tier to another.  However, Tier 2 methods may be
regarded as those dividing fuel consumption on the basis of sample or engineering
knowledge between technology types which are sufficiently homogenous to permit the
use of representative emission factors.  Tier 3 methods generally estimate emissions from
activity figures (kilometre travelled or tonne-kilometre carried, not fuel consumption) and
specific fuel efficiency or fuel rates or, alternatively, using an emission factor or factors
expressed directly in terms of a unit of activity.
A new methodology, developed from that used by CORINAIR, has been introduced for
the estimation of emissions from aircraft.  Revised emission factors are also given for
emissions from many types of stationary combustion and road transport in the United
States and Europe.
Estimating CO2
It follows from the arguments given above for the construction of detailed emission
estimates that a country will also benefit from the estimation of CO2 emissions in parallel
with the calculation of non-CO2 inventories despite the existence of Tier 1 methods for
CO2 estimation.  The Overview to this Chapter also emphasises this point.  Most of the
tables of emission factors for mobile sources, but few of the tables for stationary sources,
have figures for CO2.  In cases where CO2 emission factors are not given the carbon
emission factors provided for the fuel types listed for the Tier 1 methods will suffice.  If
different fuel qualities are used in different applications national experts may wish to vary
the emission factors accordingly.
Where CO2 emission factors are given in this Chapter they include all carbon based
molecule emissions from the process.  This ensures that CO2 totals constructed by
summing the results of the detailed estimation of emissions (the “bottom-up” approach)

will be comparable with the IPCC Reference Approach described under Tier 1 methods
above.  The Reference Approach provides a simple transparent and verifiable means of
accounting for all of the carbon in fuels which could be emitted to the atmosphere.
Because of the complexity of covering all sources of fuel combustion and obtaining the
related data it does not automatically follow that summing emissions from the many
detailed sources will result in a figure close to that obtained from the Reference
Approach.  Consequently, verification of CO2 totals against the Reference Approach is an
obligation of the IPCC reporting system.
Use of carbon emission factors based on the fuel’s carbon content also implies that
adjustments may be needed (depending on the combustion process under consideration)
for any carbon unoxidised.  Carbon remaining unoxidised after combustion is discussed in
Section 1.4.1.1.  Where emission estimates are prepared by plant type the general
information given in the section cited may be used when more specific carbon unoxidised
factors are not available.  At the level of process detail implicit in Tiers 2 and 3, quantities
of fuel combusted should be known or fairly well estimated and quantities delivered for
the manufacture of non-energy products identified and excluded.  Where this is not the
case estimates of carbon stored in manufactured products will need to be made in
collaboration with national experts preparing estimates of emissions from Industrial
Processes to ensure that there is no double counting of emissions.
D A T A  S O U R C E S
National experts working on detailed emission of non-CO2 GHGs (particularly the
indirect gases) and SO2 should consult the extensive literature on emission factors and
other estimation procedures which has been developed by other inventory programmes
outside of the framework of the IPCC/OECD/IEA programme.  These data generally
contain more technology detail, and are further broken down by size of the various
technologies.  For mobile sources, data generally contain more vehicle and control
technology detail, and are further broken down by operating conditions (e.g., catalyst
vintages, driving cycles).  The nature of these control assumptions should be known and
carefully matched with actual conditions in the country when selecting the specific factors
to be used.

This section considers emissions of NOx, N2O, CO, CH4, SO2 and NMVOCs from
stationary combustion plant.  Estimation of CO2 emissions at the level of detail of Tiers 2
and 3 is described in Section 1.5.1.
The section focuses on emissions from the combustion of commercial fuels, which include
virtually all fossil fuels and biomass fuels traded commercially and used in large combustion
plants.  Non-CO2 emissions from combustion of biomass are estimated in exactly the
same manner as fossil fuel combustion emissions.14.
Emissions of non-CO2 greenhouse gases across activities (sectors and subsectors) will depend
upon fuel, technology type and pollution control policies.  Emissions will also vary with the
size and vintage of the combustion technology, its maintenance, and its operation.  Most of a
country’s NOx emissions arise from stationary fuel combustion.  As defined here (i.e.,
excluding "traditional" small scale use of biomass), this category generally contributes a smaller
but still significant share of national emissions of CO and NMVOC, and, to a lesser extent, of
N2O and CH4.  These two gases are nonetheless discussed in some detail because of their
priority status within the IPCC/OECD/IEA programme.

General Method
Estimation of emissions from stationary sources can be described using the following basic
formula:
Emissions =  ∑ (EFabc x Activityabc)
where:
EF = Emission Factor (kg/TJ);
Activity = Energy Input (TJ);
a = Fuel type;
b = Sector-activity; and
c = Technology type.
Total emission for a particular country is the sum across activities, technologies and fuels
of the individual estimates.
Emission estimation is based on at least three distinct sets of assumptions or data:
1) emission factors; 2) energy activities; and 3) relative share of technologies in each of
the main energy activities.  Sources of the emission factors and energy activity data that
are relevant internationally are described briefly below and suggestions on appropriate
use of such data are made.
Technology share or technology splits for each of the various energy activities are needed
at least on a national level for non-CO2 greenhouse gas estimation since emission levels
are affected by the technology type.  Unfortunately, there is no complete international
source of data on technology splits and, as a result, each country will need to develop its
own technology splits for each energy activity.
The main steps in the inventory method can be summarised as follows:
1
Determine the source and form of the best available, internationally verifiable,
national (or sub-national) energy activity data.
2
Based on a survey of national energy activities, determine the main categories of
emission factors.
3
Compile best available emission factor data for the country, preferably from national
sources.  If no national sources are available, select from the options described here.
Selection among the options should be based on the similarity of the country to the
source of original measurements for types of technology and operating conditions
across main energy activities.  The selection should also consider the extent to
which control technologies may be in place and requires the ability to clearly
separate and understand control policy assumptions that may be embedded in the
emission factor data.

Based on the form of the selected emission factors, identify the technology
categories to be used in the national inventory.15
5
Using these assumptions on technology categories, develop estimates for each of the
greenhouse gases for each main activity.
6
Sum the individual activity estimates to arrive at the national inventory total for each
of the greenhouse gases.
Technology Splits for Energy Data
National data or assumptions on the technology shares of each of the main source sector
categories which have been identified as important in each country are necessary to
create the linkage between national energy balances and the emission factors.  Again, this
may be based on "bottom-up" data collection at as detailed a level as individual sources,
or it may be more of a “top-down” allocation based on statistical sampling, or engineering
judgement.  The objective is to match up fuel use, by fuel type, with specific technologies
or classes of technologies, for which credible emission factors for non-CO2 gases can be
provided.
Emission Factor Data
Emission factors for all non-CO2 greenhouse gases from combustion activities vary to
lesser or greater degrees with:
•
fuel type
•
technology
•
operating conditions
•
maintenance and vintage of technology
and so represent the average emission performance of similar technologies.
They are therefore technology specific, but may still represent a wide distribution of
possible values because of the influence of the other three factors above.  When available,
the standard deviation of the emission factor should be used to show the range of
possible emission factors, and hence emissions, for each particular energy activity.16

E M I S S I O N  F A C T O R S
Some tables of representative emission factors for NOx,17 CO, CH4, N2O and NMVOCs
by main technology and fuel types (based on Radian, 1990) were presented in the
preliminary methodology manual (OECD, 1991) distributed by the IPCC.  This information is
still useful in showing the range and variation of sources and emission rates, and it is
                                                  
     15 This may also require assumptions about the control technologies in place.
     16 Unfortunately, the standard deviation of emission factors is rarely reported with
emission factor data. One study shows that when considered, variation of emission
factors within an energy activity vary widely, from 20 to more than 50 per cent (Eggleston
and McInnes, 1987).
     17 The convention in this document is that NOx emissions from fossil fuel combustion
are expressed on a full molecular basis assuming that all NOx emissions are emitted as
NO2.

reproduced in Tables 1-15 to 1-19 for the major categories.18  All factors are expressed
on a kilograms per terajoule of energy input basis (unless stated otherwise) and are
stated on a full molecular weight basis.  These data are taken from Radian (1990) and
show uncontrolled emission factors for each of the technologies indicated.  These
emission factor data therefore do not include the level of control technology that might
be in place in some countries.  For instance, for use in countries where control policies
have significantly influenced the emission profile, either the individual factors or the final
estimate will need to be adjusted.
It may be necessary to make adjustments to "raw" emission estimates to account for
control technologies in place.  Alternative control technologies, with representative
percentage reductions, are shown in Tables 1-20 to 1-23 (Radian, 1990) for the main
control technologies applicable to each sector.  These tables reflect technologies in use
for large stationary sources in OECD countries.  Preliminary indications are that, in the
rest of the world, control technologies are not typically used (see OECD/IEA, 1991).
These data should be used in combination with the uncontrolled emission factors to
develop a "net" representative emission factor for each of the technologies to be
characterised in the national emission profile; alternatively, the emission estimate for each
technology could be adjusted downward according to the indicated percentage reduction
and the estimated penetration of the control technology.
Table 1-24 provides the fuel property assumptions upon which the Radian data are based.
The emission factor data in these tables are provided primarily for illustrative purposes.
These factors could be used as a starting point or for comparison by national experts
working on detailed "bottom-up" inventories.  More detail on current emission factors
and references is presented in the section on Data Sources.
No emission factors for SO2 are presented in Tables 1-15 to 1-19.  These emission
factors should be estimated based on the sulphur content of the fuels (see Section 1.4.2.6,
Sulphur Dioxide Emissions from Fuel Combustion).
In many countries, biomass is used in traditional, small-scale facilities and open stoves.
Emission factors presented in Tables I-16, 1-18 and 1-19 are for industrial combustion
and large-scale facilities.
                                                  
     18 Note: several printing errors occurred in the 1995 Guidelines.  These have been
corrected here.

(a) Values were originally based on gross calorific value; they were converted to net calorific value by assuming that net calorific
values were 5 per cent lower than gross calorific values for coal and oil, and 10 per cent lower for natural gas. These
percentage adjustments are the OECD/IEA assumption on how to convert from gross to net calorific values.
