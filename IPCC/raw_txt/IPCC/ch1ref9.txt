QGas-other

The minimum emission is the amount of gas not otherwise accounted for.  If no gas is used
as fuel, flared, injected, or otherwise handled, then the minimum emission factor is 1; (i.e.,
all the gas withdrawn from the ground in conjunction with the oil is emitted).  If some
amount of gas is accounted for, then the minimum emission factor is 1 minus the portion
accounted for.
Emissions also occur due to leaks.  The leak emissions are the amount of gas leaked during
various types of handling.  If no gas is used as fuel, flared, injected, or otherwise handled,
then the leaks are zero.  If some amount of gas is managed in these ways, then the leak
emission is the amount of gas handled times the leak rate, which is expressed as a fraction.
The following is the equation for the leak emission factor:

If none of the gas is controlled or utilised (i.e., Lx = 1 for all x), then the emission factor
(KOil-P) is equal to one.  This situation occurs when it is not economical to conserve or
reinject the gas (e.g., there is no local market for the gas and the volumes are relatively
small) and when venting of the gas is preferable to disposal by flaring.  It is not then
necessary to evaluate the different paths by which CH4 emissions may occur (e.g., fugitive
equipment leaks, process venting, system upsets, etc.) in these cases since the end effect is
the same: essentially all the CH4 produced is emitted to the atmosphere.
Crude Oil Transportation and Refining: The crude oil from production facilities will
initially contain a certain amount of gas in solution.  This gas, particularly the CH4 fraction,
evaporates quickly as this oil progresses through the storage and transportation systems
en route to the refinery.  When the oil reaches the refinery, it is usually fully weathered
and essentially free of any CH4 .
Accordingly, the basic mass balance relation for oil transportation and refining activities
may be expressed as follows:
EOil-T = QOil-T x F x YF-CH4 x KOil-T x DF x 10-12
where,
EOil-T
=
methane emissions from crude oil transportation and refining (Tg/year)
QOil-T
=
oil transported and refined (m3/year)
F
=
factor defining the amount of gas in solution with the crude oil (per unit
of oil by volume) (Dimensionless)
YF CH
−
4
=
methane fraction; the fraction of the gas in solution in the oil that is
methane, on a volume basis, for example, 0.1m3 of methane per 1.0 m3 of
gas.  (Dimensionless)
KOil-T
=
emission factor for oil transportation and refining, see below.
(Dimensionless).
DF
=
density of methane at the temperature and pressure at which F is
estimated (g/m3).  The relevant temperature and pressure may vary,
depending on the values used to calculate F.   For example, at 0°C and at
a pressure of 1 atmosphere, the density of methane is 715.4 g/m3, and at
20°C and 1 atmosphere, the density of methane is 666.6 g/m3.
The first two terms (QOil-T and F) estimate the total amount of gas that is in solution with
the crude oil.  The term YF-CH4 converts the total gas quantity into the quantity of
methane (still on a volume basis).  The emission factor (KOil-T) is the fraction of the total
gas in solution that is emitted (at most, KOil-T = 1).  To put the emissions estimate on a
mass basis, DF is used to estimate grams, and the conversion to teragrams follows.
The value of the solution gas factor and the corresponding mole fraction of methane is
determined by the type of crude oil (light, medium, heavy, or crude bitumen), the
composition of the associated gas, and the initial vapour pressure of the crude oil when it
is placed in the storage tanks or compartments at the production site.  Typically, the initial
vapour pressure will be equal to the operating pressure of the first vessel upstream of the
storage facilities.
Table 1-59 presents some estimated values for these two parameters at onshore and
offshore facilities.  Better estimates may be determined by performing site specific process
simulations.

QCollected CH4    =
the amount of methane collected, and not emitted, during
transportation and refining.
Often this amount is zero
Other terms defined above.
In the absence of any data regarding the volume of CH4  collected, the value of system
adjustment factor should be set to a default value of one.
Exploration and Drilling Losses
Total CH4 emissions from the exploration and drilling sector will usually be small
compared to the amount emitted by other sectors of the oil and gas industry.
Consequently, a simple Tier 1 approach is perhaps most appropriate for use here.
The basic relation is shown below:
ED  =  Nwells . FD
where,
ED
=
total CH4 emissions (Tg) from drilling and testing of oil and gas wells,
Nwells
=
number of wells drilled and tested, and
FD
=
average amount of CH4 emitted per well (Tg/well).
Tier 3 - Rigorous Source-Specific Evaluations Approach
Rigorous source-specific evaluations will generally involve compiling the following types of
information and may require significant interaction with industry and associated regulatory
agencies:
•
detailed inventories of the amount and types of process infrastructure (e.g., wells,
minor field installations, and major production and processing facilities),
