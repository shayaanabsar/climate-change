The Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (Revised Guidelines)
were accepted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) at its Twelfth
Session (Mexico City, 11-13 September 1996). Earlier, Working Group 1 of the IPCC at
its Sixth Session (Mexico City, 10 September 1996) had accepted and then forwarded the
Revised Guidelines to the IPCC. The IPCC-XII recommended that the Revised Guidelines
“are ready for use by Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC) in the preparation of their National Communications with regard to
inventories, at a time to be agreed by the Parties of the Convention.” It is, therefore,
extremely gratifying that the consensus effort of nearly one hundred and forty scientists
and national experts from more than thirty countries has resulted in the publication of
the Revised Guidelines.
At the Fourth Session of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice
(SBSTA-4, Geneva, 16-18 December 1996), Parties to the Convention decided how, and
when, the Revised Guidelines are to be applied. To assist Parties in meeting their
commitments and targets, and to monitor progress, it is essential that national GHG
emission inventories contain the best possible information for all major GHG sources and
sinks. As such, inventories must be consistent, comparable, complete, and transparent.
The Revised Guidelines provide such a methodology for the estimation and periodic update
of national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories, and thus comply with the requirements of
Articles 4 and 12 of the UNFCCC.
The Revised Guidelines were developed over a two-year period and draw extensively upon
the previous Guidelines. Where possible, the Revised Guidelines improved upon the early
1995 Guidelines by the synthesis and assessment of relevant new data. These improved
data are critical for regions of the world where baseline information is still sparse. In
areas of scientific advancement, existing methodologies were revised, and additional
methodologies were developed and assessed. A Summary of the Revised 1996 IPCC
Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories can be found in Annex 3 of the Reporting
Instructions.
We are indebted to the Co-chairs of the IPCC Expert Groups and the Experts who
generously supported this work. Their dedication to quality and timeliness was truly
remarkable. Core funding for the IPCC Unit for GHG Inventories is provided through
the IPCC Trust Fund. Other contributions, financial and otherwise, have been received
from numerous governments (Canada, European Union, Netherlands, Norway, United
Kingdom, United States) and several institutions, organisations and programmes
(European Environment Agency, Institute of Environmental Studies, United Nations
Environment Programme Country Studies, United States Country Studies Programme).
We are most grateful to the governments of Brazil, Switzerland, Thailand and the United

Kingdom for kindly hosting the meetings of the IPCC Expert Groups and the Greenhouse
Gas Liaison Group (GILG). We warmly thank the Co-chairmen and the members of the
Technical Support Unit of Working Group I, and the staff of the IPCC/OECD/IEA GHG
inventory programme. In this context, we particularly express our gratitude to Bo Lim
and Karen Tréanton in their capacity as Co-editors of the Revised Guidelines, and
Audrey Glynn-Garnier and Sharon Michel for formatting the Guidelines. Finally, we
express our sincere appreciation to our Visiting Scientists, Yamil Bonduki,
