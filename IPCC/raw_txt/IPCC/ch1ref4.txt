Emissions of greenhouse gases from mobile sources, including carbon dioxide (CO2),
carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O)
and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) are most easily estimated by
major transport activity, i.e., road, air, rail, and ships.  However, as road transport and
aviation account for the majority of mobile-source fuel consumption (e.g., 82 per cent in
1988 for the OECD), followed by air transport (about 13 per cent), greater priority has
been attached to the development of emission models and inventories for road vehicles
and aircraft.
The diversity of the types of mobile source and the range of characteristics which affect
emission factors are amply demonstrated by the tables included in this section for both
road and air transport.  Recent work has both updated and strengthened the data given
and a fuller methodology for estimating aircraft emissions has been introduced based
upon the EMEP/CORINAIR work in this field.  Despite these advances more work is
needed to fill in many gaps in knowledge of emissions from certain vehicle types and on

the effects of ageing on catalytic control of road vehicle emissions.  Equally, there is very
little information on the appropriate emission factors for road transport in developing
countries where age of fleet, maintenance and patterns of use are different from those in
industrialised countries.
It should be recalled that transport is a significant source of CO2 emissions and emission
factors for CO2 emissions are provided in the following tables to permit the estimation of
CO2 at this detailed level.

Estimation of mobile source emissions is a very complex undertaking that requires
consideration of many parameters, including:
•
transport class
•
fuel consumed
•
operating characteristics
•
emission controls
•
maintenance procedures
•
fleet age
The need for data on several parameters and the wide variety of conditions that can
affect the performance of each category of mobile source makes it very difficult to
generalise their emission characteristics.  Also, within the transport sector, the primary
measure of activity is less likely than in other sectors to be fuel consumption.
The underlying general emissions model may be expressed as:
Emissions =  ∑ (EFabc x Activityabc)
where:
EF
=
emission factor
Activity
=
amount of energy consumed or distance travelled for a given
mobile source activity
a
=
fuel type (diesel, gasoline, LPG, bunker, etc.)
b
=
vehicle type (e.g., passenger, light-duty or heavy-duty for road
vehicles)
c
=
emission control
which implies the following steps:
•
Determine the amount of energy consumed by fuel type for the major transport
modes using national data or, as an alternative, IEA or UN international data sources
(all values should be reported in terajoules).
•
For each fuel type, determine the amount of energy that is consumed by each
vehicle type, e.g., light-duty gasoline vehicles, etc. (all units are in terajoules).  If
distance travelled is the activity measure, determine the total distance travelled by
each vehicle type.  In this case, the energy consumption associated with these
distance travelled figures should be calculated and aggregated by fuel for comparison

with national energy balance figures.  If necessary, further subdivide each vehicle type
into uncontrolled and key classes of emission control technology.
•
Multiply the amount of energy consumed, or the distance travelled by each category
of vehicle or vehicle/control technology, by the appropriate emission factor for that
category.  Data presented in the next section (Emission Factors) can be used as a
starting point.  However, national experts are encouraged to consult other data
sources referenced in this chapter or locally available data before determining
appropriate factors for a particular country.
•
Emissions of each pollutant can be summed across all categories of fuel and
technology type, including for all levels of emission control, to determine total
emissions from mobile source-related activities.
Emission Factors
The tables given for road transport summarise results of a detailed analysis of mobile-
source emission factors covering North American and European vehicles and conditions.
Recently published work has permitted the updating of figures appearing in the 1995
edition of the Guidelines.  The US emission factors for mobile sources, published in the
1995 edition, were developed using the MOBILE4 model.  This was one of a series of
emissions models developed and periodically updated by the US Environmental Protection
Agency for use in its analysis of motor vehicle regulatory and policy issues.  The MOBILE4
model is now out of date.  Since the analysis done in 1991, several improvements have
been based on new information and vehicle testing results.  Emission factors developed
using the latest version of the MOBILE model (MOBILE5a) are higher for most pollutants.
The US tables included here contain this latest information.
CO2 factors are derived from the carbon content of the fuels and therefore include the
carbon present in other carbon molecule based emissions.
The European data are drawn from the CORINAIR COPERT model.  However, for
actual calculations of national emissions, users are encouraged to also consult a range of
recent and more detailed information sources (see Data Sources in Section 1.5.1).
Particularly for indirect GHGs, more comprehensive sources are available based on
programmes outside the GHG emissions area.
Emission factor estimates are presented for CO2, CO, NOx, N2O, CH4 and NMVOCs
for several classes of non-road vehicles - railway locomotives, ships and boats, farm and
construction equipment.
This section on mobile sources also contains a more comprehensive explanation of a
methodology for the estimation of emissions from aircraft and greater specificity of
aircraft/engine emission factors for NOx.
All emission factor data are stated on the basis of full molecular weight of the respective
pollutant; NOx factors are stated as NO2.
Emission Factors for Mobile Sources in Developing Countries
In highly populated developing countries the estimated emissions per kilometre travelled
should be altered.  First, there are virtually no catalytic converters on the vehicles.
Second, the number of accelerations and decelerations that the vehicle will undergo is
much larger than for corresponding travel in countries that are less populated and have
well arranged highway systems.  The measured pollutant value of NOx in an engine at
constant rpm conditions is about 1.0 g/MJ for the United States and for Europe.
However, for highly populated developing countries 1.8 g/MJ should be used.

United States Emission Estimates
Technical Approach
The US emissions estimates for NOx, CO, CH4 and NMVOC from highway vehicles were
developed directly from the US EPA’s MOBILE5a model.  The model calculates exhaust
emission factors for gasoline and diesel fuelled US vehicles, based on the year in which
they were manufactured.  For gasoline vehicles, it also calculates VOC emissions due to
evaporative, running and refuelling losses (VOC emissions from diesel vehicles due to
these causes are negligible).
Assumptions
To develop emission estimates for different control technology types, calculations were
carried out for specific model years during which US vehicles were equipped with the
technology in question.  Table 1-25 shows the correspondence between the technology
types and the US model years used to represent them in the model.  Average lifetime
emissions were calculated for each vehicle type based on their assumed lifetimes.  The
model uses a two-step linear function to estimate deterioration rates from vehicle
mileage.  Linear equations are fitted to vehicle emission estimates at 0 and 50 000 miles
and 50 000 and 100 000 miles and from the results lifetime average factors were
calculated.
The emission factors calculated by MOBILE5a are affected by assumptions regarding
average speeds, ambient temperature, diurnal temperature range, altitude and fuel
volatility that are provided to the model.  They are also affected by the assumed presence
or absence of inspection/maintenance (I/M) programmes and anti-tampering programmes
as well as the type of I/M programme used.  The model calculates emission factors using
three seasonal conditions: Spring/Fall, Winter and Summer.  The model was also run with
three different I/M scenarios; no I/M programme, basic I/M and enhanced I/M.  Where I/M
influences emissions, the emission factors given in the tables included here are shown as
range estimates with the lower value representing the enhanced I/M and the upper value
reflecting no I/M.  Since there is no I/M programme for diesel vehicles in the United
States the diesel vehicle emission factors generated by the model for different I/M
programmes were the same.  The average speed assumed by the model is 31.4 km/h -
typical of uncongested urban driving (see Table 1-26).

The estimated vehicle fuel economies were also used to calculate fuel specific and energy
specific emission factors for all of the pollutants.  Energy specific emission factors were
based on the net calorific value of the fuel in each case.  Since emission and fuel
consumption tend to vary in parallel (vehicles and operating modes causing high emission
rates also tend to result in high fuel consumption, and vice-versa) these energy specific
emission factors are expected to be more generally applicable than the factors in grams
per kilometre and their use is to be preferred.

LIMITATIONS OF MOBILE5A RESULTS
Emission factors for many greenhouse gases from road vehicles have been
developed using the MOBILE5a Model(a) as presented in Tables 1-27 to
1-33.  This model is one of a series of emissions models developed and
periodically updated by the US Environmental Protection Agency for use in
its analysis of motor vehicle regulatory and policy issues.  The model has
been used to derive average emission factors for NOx, CO, and NMVOC
by class of vehicle and for gasoline and diesel fuel.  Calculations for other
gases and for alternative fuels were done separately.
All “global” average emission factors like these should be considered
illustrative and should not be directly used in national emissions calculations.
Such values are by necessity based on “global” average assumptions in
several key areas.  Average emission factors by class of vehicle are sensitive
to very specific assumptions including those about
• 
vehicle models, average age and accumulated mileage
• 
per cent driving in cold start, hot start and stabilised conditions
• 
average driving speed
• 
ambient temperature
• 
fuel comparison
• 
rates of tampering with control systems
• 
proper maintenance
Obviously, many of these assumed conditions will vary significantly from
country to country and even by region within countries.  For example, the
light-duty gasoline vehicle class does not include two-stroke engines, which
are not used in the United States, but are important in Central and Eastern
Europe.  Therefore, “global” illustrative factors should not be used to
calculate actual emissions in a specific country.
For the above reasons, illustrative emission factors should not be
directly used for national calculations.  National inventory experts should
consult the more detailed references on mobile source emission factors and
use these sources to develop or adapt emission factors which are
appropriate for their specific conditions.  The expert group on GHG
emissions from fuel combustion has identified the need for more detailed
guidance and assistance to national experts on the development of locally
applicable emission factors as a priority for future work.

N2O emission from internal combustion engines is not well understood and data on
emissions are scarce.  The 1995 edition of the Guidelines contained supplementary
information used by the Canadian Government, based on a review of data available in
1994 (Ballantyne et al., 1994).  The Canadian estimates show that N2O emissions from
vehicles with three-way catalysts increased markedly during the first 15 to 20 000 km, so
that earlier estimates based on tests of low mileage vehicles are too low.  These results
are summarised in Box 5.  The US tables, included in this section, use the Canadian data
to estimate N2O emissions from gasoline passenger cars.  For light-duty gasoline trucks
and motorcycles, fuel specific N2O emissions were assumed to be the same as for the
corresponding passenger car technology.  N2O emissions per kilometre were then

calculated from the fuel specific emissions and the fuel consumption characteristics for
each class.
In the absence of direct data, N2O emissions from heavy-duty gasoline trucks were
estimated by assuming that their fuel specific emissions were similar to those for
passenger cars with similar technology.  N2O emission factors for heavy-duty diesel trucks
were derived from emissions for these vehicles reported by Dietzmann, Parness and
Bradow (1980).  The corresponding fuel specific emission rates were used to estimate
N2O emissions from light-duty diesel vehicles in the absence of information on this class.

RECENT INFORMATION ON N2O MEASUREMENTS
Since the initial illustrative emission factors were estimated in 1991, a number of
measurement studies have been carried out to improve understanding of vehicle N2O
emissions.  A paper by Ballantyne, et al., (1994) summarised measurements in Canada,

Results of this analysis are presented by categories defined by the US EPA as listed below:
Table 1-27: Light-duty gasoline passenger cars - vehicles with rated gross weight less
than 8 500 lb (3 855 kg) designed primarily to carry 12 or fewer passengers.  Six levels of
gasoline-vehicle control technology are shown:
1
Uncontrolled (still typical of most vehicles around the world).
2
Non-catalyst emission controls - including modifications to ignition timing and air-
fuel ratio to reduce emissions, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), and air injection into
the exhaust manifold.
3
Oxidation catalyst systems normally including many of the same techniques, plus a
two-way catalytic converter to oxidise hydrocarbons and CO.
4
"Early" three-way catalyst results representative of vehicles sold in the United States
in the early to mid-1980s, which were mostly equipped with carburettors having
electronic "trim".
5
"Advanced" three-way catalyst values based on current US technology vehicles, using
electronic fuel injection under computer control.
6
Low Emission Vehicles (LEV) are expected to include sequential multi-port fuel
injection with adaptive learning, more sophisticated computer diagnostics and heated
catalysts with secondary air injection.

more than 11 passengers at a time, or which are equipped with special features for off-
road operation. They include most pickup trucks, passenger and cargo vans, four-wheel
drive vehicles, and derivatives of these.  The technology classifications used are the same
as those for gasoline passenger vehicles.
Table 1-29: Heavy-duty gasoline vehicles -  manufacturer's gross vehicle weight rating
exceeding 8 500 lb (3 855 kg).  This includes large pickups, vans and specialised trucks
using pickup and van chassis, as well as the larger "true" heavy-duty trucks, which have
gross vehicle weights of eight short tons or more.  In the United States, the large pickups
and vans in this category greatly outnumber the heavier trucks, so that the emission
factors calculated by MOBILE5a, and fuel economy estimates, are more representative of
these vehicles.  Three levels of emission control technology are shown:
1
Uncontrolled.
2
Non-catalyst emission controls, including control of ignition timing and air-fuel ratio
to minimise emissions, EGR, and air injection into the exhaust manifold to reduce
hydrocarbons and CO emissions.
3
Three-way catalyst technology presently used in the United States includes
electronically-controlled fuel injection, EGR, air injection, and electronic control of
ignition timing, as well as the catalyst itself.
Table 1-30: Light-duty diesel passenger cars - a diesel passenger car designed primarily
to carry fewer than 12 passengers, with gross vehicle weight less than 8 500 lb (3 855 kg).
Three levels of emission control technology are shown:
1
Uncontrolled.
2
Moderate emissions control (achieved by changes in injection timing and combustion
system design).
3
Advanced emissions control utilising modern electronic control of the fuel injection
system, and exhaust gas recirculation.
Table 1-31: Light-duty diesel trucks - light-duty diesel trucks defined like their gasoline
counterparts, including weight, utility, and off-road operation features.  The technology
classifications are the same as those for diesel passenger cars.
Table 1-32: Heavy-duty diesel vehicles - the classification for heavy-duty diesel vehicles
is the same as for gasoline vehicles, but the characteristics of US vehicle fleets are
different.  Heavy-duty diesel vehicles are primarily large trucks, with gross vehicle weight
ratings of 10 to 40 tons.  Therefore, the MOBILE5a emission factors are more
representative of large trucks (and buses) than the smaller pickup and van-type vehicles,
and this is reflected in the fuel economy estimates.  Three levels of control are presented:
1
Uncontrolled.
2
Moderate control (typical of 1983 US engines).
3
Advanced control (for engines meeting US 1991 emissions standards).
Table 1-33: Motorcycles - The MOBILE5a emission factors for these vehicles are based
on the US motorcycle population, which probably reflects higher average power ratings
and fuel consumption than for many developing countries.  The factors for uncontrolled
motorcycles include a mixture of two-stroke and four-stroke engines, with the VOC
emissions due primarily to the two-strokes, and the NOx to the four-stroke engines.  The
factors for motorcycles with non-catalyst emission controls reflect four-stroke engines
only, as US emission control regulations have essentially eliminated two-stroke engines
from the market.

(a) Recent measurement results (De Soete, 1993, Ballantyne, et al., 1994) have shown that N2O emissions from aged
catalysts, e.g., tested after driving 15 000 - 25 000 km, are substantially higher than from new catalyst-equipped cars.
Tests on comparable models show aged catalysts emitting from roughly 30% more to almost 5 times the rate of new
equipment.  As indicated in Box 5, Environment Canada has used a value almost 5 times as high for aged catalysts in
its national inventory calculations.

European Emission Estimates
The European emission estimates for NOx, CH4, NMVOC (total VOC minus CH4), CO,
N2O and CO2 are based on the COPERT90 model, developed for the Commission of the
European Communities.19  The calculation is based on five main types of input
parameters:
• 
total fuel consumption
• 
vehicle park
• 
driving condition
• 
emission factors
• 
other parameters
For these main types of input parameters, additional information (e.g., on vehicle classes,
production years etc.) is needed in order to carry out the calculations.
The methodology is defined in such a way that it uses the firm technical data and that
national variations among European countries can be incorporated.  The variations may
include such things as composition of vehicle park, vehicle age, driving patterns, some fuel
parameters and a few climatic parameters.  Other variations which may exist, for
example, variations in vehicle maintenance, mountain driving etc., are not accounted for
because there is not enough data available to do so.
Vehicle categories
The vehicle categories chosen by CORINAIR 1990 do not meet all the requirements for
modelling vehicle emissions considered important by the working group.  In particular the
age of vehicle (year of production) and the engine technology are not sufficiently
reflected.  Thus, for the purpose of the COPERT work only, a more detailed vehicle
category split has been developed.
Hot Emissions
These emissions depend on a variety of factors including the distance that each vehicle
travels, its speed (or road type), its age and engine size.
The basic formula for estimating hot emissions using an experimentally obtained emission
factor is:
Emissions [g] = emission factor [g/km] . vehicle kilometres per year [km]
The emission factors and vehicle kilometres are in most cases split into certain classes of
road types and vehicle categories.
However, for many countries the only data known with any certainty are the total fuel
consumption of gasoline, diesel and LPG, not vehicle kilometres.  It is therefore suggested
that fuel consumption data are used to check vehicle mileage where they are known and
to make a final fuel balance.
Cold Start Emissions
Cold starts result in additional emissions.  They take place under all three (urban, rural
and highway) driving conditions, but seem to be most significant for urban driving.  In
                                                  
     19 As is the convention throughout these Guidelines, CO2 emissions are calculated to
include the carbon emitted as CO and as VOC.

principle they occur for all vehicle categories.  However, emission factors are available or
can be reasonably estimated only for gasoline, diesel and LPG passenger cars and -
assuming that these vehicles behave like passenger cars - light-duty vehicles.
Consequently, only these categories are covered by the methodology.  Moreover, cold
start emissions are considered not to be a function of vehicle age.
Cold start emissions are calculated as emissions additional to emissions that would be
expected if all vehicles had only hot engines.  A factor, the ratio of cold to hot emissions,
is used and applied to the fraction of kilometres driven with cold engines.  These factors
may vary from country to country.  Different driving behaviour, road conditions and
climate as well as trip length affect the warm up time and the fraction of distance
travelled with cold engines.  These factors can be taken into account, but again
information may not be available to do this thoroughly in all countries, so that estimates
have to close identified gaps.
Evaporative VOC Emissions
There are three primary sources of evaporative emissions from vehicles:
i)
diurnal (daily) emissions;
ii)
hot soak emissions;  and
iii)
running losses.
These are estimated separately.  Again they are affected by factors that vary from country
to country.
All three types of evaporative emissions are significantly affected by the volatility of the
gasoline being used, the absolute ambient temperature and temperature changes, and
vehicle design characteristics.  For hot soak emissions and running losses the driving
pattern is also of importance.
In general, the estimation of evaporative emissions from gasoline vehicles involves a large
number of uncertainties which can not be resolved without carrying out further
measurements.
Application of the baseline methodology to the different vehicle categories and pollutants
Due to gaps in knowledge, the baseline methodology can not be applied in full and in the
same way to all vehicle categories.  Moreover, there are variations depending on the
pollutant considered.  In general, one can distinguish between four methods:

Method A
Hot emissions are calculated based on:
-
the total annual kilometres driven per vehicle;
-
the share of kilometres driven under the driving modes “urban”,
“rural” and “highway”;
-
the average speed of the vehicles under the driving modes “urban”,
“rural” and “highway”;
-
speed-dependent hot emission factors.
Cold start emissions are calculated based on:
-
the average trip length per vehicle trip;
-
the average monthly temperature;
-
temperature and trip length dependent cold start correction factor.
Evaporative emissions are calculated based on:
-
the fuel volatility (RVP);
-
the average monthly temperature and the average monthly
temperature variation;
-
fuel volatility and temperature dependent emission factors.
Method B
The total annual emissions per vehicle are calculated based on:
-
the total annual kilometres driven per vehicle;
-
the share of kilometres driven under the driving modes “urban”,
“rural” and “highway”;
-
the average speed of the vehicles under the driving modes “urban”,
“rural” and “highway”;
-
speed-dependent emission factors.
Note:  for diesel passenger cars, cold start extra emissions for CO, NOx
and NMVOC, as well as extra fuel consumption, are added using the
method described under A.  For LPG passenger cars a simplified method is
used.
Method C
The total annual emissions per vehicle are calculated based on:
-
the total annual kilometres driven per vehicle;
-
the share of kilometres driven under the driving modes “urban”,
“rural” and “highway”;
-
driving mode dependent emissions factors.
Note:  for gasoline and diesel light-duty vehicle, cold start extra emissions
for CO, NOX and NMVOC, as well as fuel consumption, are added using
the method described under A.  For gasoline light-duty vehicles, NMVOC
evaporative emissions are added using the method described under A.

In developing the following tables, a net calorific value of 43.5 TJ/kt was assumed for
