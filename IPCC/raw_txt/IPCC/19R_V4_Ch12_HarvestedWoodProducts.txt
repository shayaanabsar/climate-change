HARVESTED WOOD PRODUCTS (HWP) 
12.1 
INTRODUCTION 
This Chapter updates Chapter 12 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, including updated technical parameters for 
estimating carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and removals arising from HWP. Using the term “CO2 emissions and 
removals arising from HWP” (and sometimes just “CO2 emissions”) in Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
(AFOLU) guidance is not common practice but has been adopted in this chapter on HWP and the reasons are 
discussed as part of terms and definitions in Section 12.2. 
The guidance in this chapter maintains the existing approaches covered in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. The refined 
guidelines provided here take account of new relevant scientific information, including relevant methodological 
information and parameters contained in IPCC KP Supplement (e.g. carbon conversion factors). Some cross 
references are made to the earlier guidance where needed, for example in cases where it may be helpful to show 
consistency with the earlier 2006 IPCC Guidelines. It should also be noted that the HWP Worksheet accompanying 
the 2006 IPCC Guidelines (HWP calculator) cannot be used in conjunction with this updated guidance. 
The structure of this chapter aims to clarify the relationships between new information and the 2006 IPCC 
Guidelines and to allow for inclusion and updating of new parameters where appropriate. 
The description of the application of methodologies in the light of the inclusion of updated parameters has been 
clarified. In particular Section 12.2 clarifies some existing terms, definitions and concepts.  
Section 12.3 provides guidance on available HWP approaches, describing and clarifying the options for defining 
a conceptual framework and system boundary for estimating emissions and removals arising from HWP.  
The subsequent guidance in this chapter is structured to consider three distinct subject areas relevant to harvested 
wood biomass: i) wood products in use (i.e. wood utilised as a material); ii) wood biomass used for energy purposes 
and iii) wood biomass in solid waste disposal sites (SWDS). Section 12.4 gives detailed guidance on wood products 
in use, specifically providing good practice guidance on the choice of method for wood products in use. This 
includes improved methodological guidance for estimating CO2 emissions and removals arising from HWP 
following different approaches. This section also includes refined guidance for calculating the initial carbon stock 
in the HWP pool in use as well as parameters such as HWP carbon conversion factors. Section 12.5 addresses 
wood biomass used for energy purposes. Section 12.6 provides clarification of the treatment of “wood biomass in 
SWDS”.  
12.2 
TERMS AND DEFINITIONS 
This section provides terms and definitions with specific meaning in the context of estimating CO2 emissions and 
removals arising from HWP. 
CO2 emissions and removals arising from HWP: In Volume 4, Chapter 1, Section 1.2.1 of the 2006 IPCC 
Guidelines, it is explained that GHG fluxes in the AFOLU Sector can be estimated in two ways: 1) as net changes 
in carbon stocks over time (used for most CO2 fluxes) and 2) directly as gas flux rates to and from the atmosphere 
(used for estimating non-CO2 emissions and some CO2 emissions and removals). Hence, when giving guidance on 
estimating CO2 emissions and removals for the AFOLU Sector, usually the focus is on estimating annual carbon 
stock changes in all relevant pools (e.g. carbon pools in forest land and cropland). The carbon stock changes in the 
various pools can then be combined and converted to CO2 emissions and removals of CO2 (see Volume 4, Chapter 
2, Section 2.2 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines). Generally, guidance for the AFOLU Sector reflects this by discussing 
how to estimate annual carbon stock changes in the various relevant pools. The term “CO2 emissions and removals 
arising from HWP” is frequently referred to in this chapter on HWP because it is not always possible to refer to 
“carbon stocks” or “carbon stock changes”, for two principal reasons: 
Firstly, as explained in this section and discussed in detail in Section 12.3 and Annex 12.A, different “approaches” 
can be taken to estimating the CO2 emissions and removals arising from HWP. Guidance on these approaches was 
given originally in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. Amongst these approaches are examples that, conceptually, involves 
tracking carbon or CO2 fluxes, rather than tracking changes in annual carbon stocks in the HWP pool. Therefore, 
sometimes it is necessary to describe how to estimate carbon and CO2 fluxes, particularly when giving guidance 
for this approach, otherwise it would not be possible to maintain the approach as provided in the 2006 IPCC 
Guidelines. 
Secondly, some important elements of carbon in harvested wood (e.g. harvested wood biomass used directly as an 
energy feedstock) strictly do not enter the HWP carbon pool but are produced and then consumed almost 
immediately, involving oxidation and release of CO2 to the atmosphere. Hence, if there is interest in estimating 
 
Chapter 12: Harvested Wood Products 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
12.7 
the contributions of these elements of harvested wood towards CO2 emissions, it is necessary to refer to CO2 
emissions, because the guidance cannot be provided by describing annual carbon stock changes in HWP pools (i.e. 
because no such pool exists for these products from year to year). 
The terms “CO2 emissions and removals arising from HWP”, “CO2 emissions”, “carbon stocks” and “carbon stock 
changes” are used in this chapter, where these terms are appropriate for describing approaches and methods 
relevant to HWP. 
Removals: The general term “removals” is defined in the Glossary of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. In the context 
of HWP, when referring to CO2 removals, it may be noted that HWP do not directly sequester carbon from the 
atmosphere. However, carbon retained in HWP constitutes a pool of carbon that was sequestered originally by the 
above ground biomass carbon pool of forests and other wood producing land categories. In this respect, the carbon 
from CO2 originally sequestered by vegetation is transferred to the HWP pool, similarly to when it is transferred 
from the above ground biomass carbon pool to the litter and soil carbon pools in the AFOLU sector. The only 
difference is that transfers of carbon from vegetation to HWP are always the result of anthropogenic activity. 
The term removals, as defined here, should not be confused with the use of the term in a different context, i.e. 
when referring to “wood-removals”, as defined in Section 12.4.1.1. 
Approach: The term “approach” has a particular meaning in the context of CO2 emissions and removals arising 
from HWP. An “approach” includes a conceptual framework for the estimation of CO2 emissions and removals 
(see inter alia Brown et al. 1998; UNFCCC 2003; Cowie et al. 2006). An approach also defines the particular 
system boundary referred to when calculating quantities of carbon entering, retained in and lost from the HWP 
pool. The system boundary defines which CO2 emissions and removals are to be included in estimates and finally 
reported (see Cowie et al. 2006). Approaches need to be defined for the estimation and reporting of emissions and 
removals arising from HWP in order to ensure transparency, completeness and consistency in calculations and 
reported estimates, in particular to avoid double-counting or non-counting of emissions and removals.  
Further guidance on available approaches is provided in Section 12.3 and in Annex 12.A. 
Method: The term “method” refers to the set of calculations needed to implement a particular approach for 
estimating CO2 emissions and removals arising from HWP (see UNFCCC 2003; Cowie et al. 2006). Thus: 
 An approach defines WHAT is to be estimated and reported in an inventory to encompass CO2 emissions and 
removals arising from HWP (as determined by a system boundary); whereas 
 A method defines HOW to calculate the emissions and removals to be reported, that is, the calculation 
techniques used in estimation (see Cowie et al. 2006). 
It follows that different methods could be applied to implement a particular approach and that more than one 
method may be involved in the implementation of an approach.  
When considering methods to estimate CO2 emissions and removals arising from HWP, it is possible to apply 
methods that are ‘direct inventory-based’, ‘flux data-based’ or a combination of both methods.  
Direct inventory-based methods involve direct assessment of the HWP carbon pool at two or more points in time, 
then estimating carbon pool changes from the difference between sequential assessments.  
Flux data-based methods, on the other hand, involve either:  
 Measuring fluxes of CO2 between the atmosphere and the reservoir of carbon contained in harvested biomass; 
or 
 Tracking fluxes of carbon contained in wood biomass that is harvested from forests and other wood producing 
land categories throughout the stages of the wood processing chain for the purpose of estimating the magnitude 
of the HWP carbon pool and its change over time. 
In practice, most of the flux data-based methods described in the scientific literature involve modelling rather 
than direct measurement, to estimate carbon stocks and stock changes and/or CO2 fluxes from and to the HWP 
pool. 
The distinction between direct inventory-based and flux data-based methods, with particular reference to Tier 3 
methods, is further explained in Section 12.4.4.

EMISSIONS AND REMOVALS ARISING FROM 
HWP 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
12.8 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Different approaches can be taken to estimating and presenting CO2 emissions and removals arising from HWP. 
Each individual approach is potentially useful, depending upon the application, i.e. the specific question being 
addressed, or type of estimate required. This guidance does not judge whether one particular approach should be 
preferred. The choice of approach is important for determining the details of calculation methods for estimating 
CO2 emissions and removals arising from HWP. Hence, before considering calculation methods as presented in 
Section 12.4, this section provides an introduction to the essential features of the different approaches that have 
been identified for this purpose. Information is also provided on the implications of choosing between the 
approaches, i.e. on the calculation and reporting of emissions and removals across the AFOLU sector and the 
reporting of CO2 emissions due to wood biomass burnt in the Energy sector (see Section 12.5).  
The 2006 IPCC Guidelines considered four approaches known as the ‘stock-change’, ‘production’, ‘atmospheric-
flow’ and ‘simple-decay’ approaches. As explained below, these approaches have differences in terms of their 
conceptual frameworks and the system boundaries employed for calculations (Section 12.2). Further discussion 
about the approaches is provided in Annex 12.A whilst an essential introduction is given in this section. 
The discussion of approaches presented here focusses on estimating CO2 emissions and removals arising from 
HWP in use, according to the defined approaches. Harvested biomass used for energy purposes and wood biomass 
disposed of in SWDS are discussed separately in Sections 12.5 and 12.6. 
12.3.1 Conceptual frameworks of HWP approaches 
The design of HWP approaches involves two conceptual frameworks. 
The first conceptual framework focusses on the estimation of CO2 emissions and removals arising from HWP on 
the basis of changes in carbon stocks within defined HWP pools. In effect, this type of approach aims to track 
changes in carbon stocks in the HWP pool that take place from one year to the next, and then infer net emissions 
and removals of CO2 from HWP from these stock changes. 
The second conceptual framework focusses on identifying and quantifying actual CO2 fluxes from and to the 
atmosphere from HWP. 
The ‘stock-change’ and ‘production’ approaches are based on the first conceptual framework and the ‘atmospheric-
flow’ and ‘simple-decay’ approaches are based on the second conceptual framework. Further details are given in 
Annex 12.A. 
In practice, physically measuring either actual carbon stocks in the HWP pool or actual fluxes between HWP and 
the atmosphere can be technically challenging. As a consequence, the implementation of the different approaches 
using Tier 1 and Tier 2 methods tends to employ modelling and calculations that are similar regardless of the 
conceptual framework of the particular approach and generally involves referring to similar sources of activity 
data. 
Results for CO2 emissions and removals are defined in the same way as for other land use categories and carbon 
pools. Specifically, when carbon stocks in the HWP pool increase over time, this corresponds to net CO2 removals 
into HWP; when carbon stocks in the HWP pool decrease over time, this corresponds to net CO2 emissions arising 
from HWP.  
12.3.2 System boundaries employed by approaches  
The essential differences between the HWP approaches are related to the system boundaries applied when making 
calculations. Illustrations of the system boundaries of the four approaches are included in Annex 12.A. The system 
boundary of an approach is not necessarily the same as the national boundary of a country. 
In the AFOLU sector, excluding HWP, changes in carbon stocks or carbon fluxes in forests and other wood 
producing lands are estimated consistently with national boundaries. For HWP, estimation depends on the selected 
approach. 
The ‘stock-change’ approach for HWP involves estimating changes in carbon stocks in the HWP pool within the 
national boundaries. Hence, carbon stock changes in the HWP pool are reported by the country where the wood 
products are used (i.e. reported by the “consuming country”). 
The ‘production’ approach involves estimating changes in carbon stocks in the HWP pool consisting of products 
made from wood harvested in a country. The HWP pool thus consists of all products made from wood that is 
harvested domestically, i.e. those products that are consumed domestically and also those products that are 
exported and used in other countries. In other words, when applying the ‘production’ approach the “producing 
country” reports carbon stock changes from HWP produced by that country, regardless of where the HWP are 
consumed and used. 
 
Chapter 12: Harvested Wood Products 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
12.9 
The ‘atmospheric-flow’ approach involves estimating fluxes of CO2 from and to the atmosphere from HWP, taking 
place within national boundaries. When applying the ‘atmospheric-flow’ approach, the CO2 emissions and 
removals arising from HWP are thus reported by a country where the wood products are used (i.e. by the 
“consuming country”). 
The ‘simple-decay’ approach involves estimating fluxes of CO2 from and to the atmosphere from HWP, associated 
with woody biomass harvested from the forests and other wood-producing lands within a country. When applying 
the ‘simple-decay’ approach, the CO2 emissions and removals arising from HWP are thus reported by a country 
where the wood products are produced (i.e. by the “producing country”), regardless of where the HWP are 
consumed and used. 
As explained above and in Annex 12.A, although there are theoretical differences between the ‘production’ 
approach and the ‘simple-decay’ approach, when applying the ‘simple-decay’ approach with Tier 1 default 
methods, the guidance provided in this chapter for the ‘production’ approach also applies for the ‘simple-decay’ 
approach. 
There are complementary similarities and distinctions between the four HWP approaches in terms of their 
reference to conceptual frameworks and system boundaries: 
 The ‘stock-change’ and ‘production’ approaches work with carbon stock changes in HWP pools, whereas the 
‘atmospheric-flow’ and ‘simple-decay’ approaches work with CO2 fluxes. 
 The ‘stock-change’ and ‘atmospheric-flow’ approaches cover stock changes or CO2 fluxes associated within a 
consuming country, whereas the ‘production’ and ‘simple-decay’ approaches cover those associated with a 
producing country. 
When calculating results for GHG inventories, estimates of CO2 emissions and removals arising from HWP need 
to be compatible with results for carbon stock changes in forests and other wood producing land categories. 
Specifically, it is important that CO2 emissions and removals are not omitted and/or double-counted in results, e.g. 
for forests and for HWP. The calculations defined in this guidance for the HWP approaches are designed to ensure 
such compatibility. 
The system boundaries of the approaches are also defined so that no double-counting or omissions occur when 
estimates of CO2 emissions and removals arising from HWP reported by different countries are combined to 
provide global or regional estimates. However, this is only the case if all countries use the same approach. Double 
counting and/or non-counting of CO2 emissions and removals associated with forests, other wood producing land 
categories and HWP can occur if countries apply different HWP approaches. 
In some situations, CO2 emissions and removals arising from the HWP pool are not estimated explicitly. The 
circumstances in which this may occur are discussed in Section 12.4.1.2. In these circumstances, the assumption 
of a “steady-state HWP pool” is made.1 When this assumption is made, the CO2 emissions associated with 
harvested biomass are nevertheless included implicitly as part of the CO2 emissions and removals from the above 
ground biomass carbon pool of forests and other wood producing land categories. When CO2 emissions and 
removals arising from HWP are not estimated explicitly, the possible approaches to reporting CO2 emissions and 
removals arising from HWP are not relevant and are not applied. 
12.4 
CHOICE OF METHOD FOR WOOD PRODUCTS 
IN USE 
This section provides guidance on the choice of method to apply in conjunction with the available approaches 
described in Section 12.3 and Annex 12.A. Note that guidance on Tier 1 default methods provided in this section 
is also applicable for the ‘simple-decay’ approach (see Section 12.3 and Annex 12.A). The choice of calculation 
method and the data used for estimating the CO2 emissions and removals arising from HWP have an implicit 
impact on the calculated system boundaries. Therefore, it is necessary to cross-check that any method to be applied 
corresponds and relates to the selected approach. 
                                                           
1  Previous IPCC guidance on HWP has referred to the possibility of making the assumption of “instantaneous oxidation” of 
HWP (see IPCC 1997, IPCC 2006, IPCC 2014). Furthermore, reference is sometimes made to the term, “instantaneous 
oxidation” in the context of accounting rather than reporting. For these reasons, this term is generally avoided in this refined 
guidance.

12.4.1 Initial steps to estimate CO2 emissions and removals 
arising from HWP  
To estimate CO2 emissions and removals arising from HWP, it is good practice to follow the decision tree (Figure 
12.1) and the steps described below. 
STEP 1: Check the availability of activity data on HWP  
In order to apply the guidance provided for estimating CO2 emissions and removals arising from HWP, information 
on the utilization of wood as a material needs to be available. In the case that no such information is available, 
countries might need to make the assumption of a ‘steady-state HWP pool’ (see Section 12.4.1.2). 
When making decisions about whether to estimate contributions towards GHG emissions and CO2 removals, 
generally the key question is: how big is a particular contribution?  More specifically, is the magnitude of the 
contribution sufficiently large, or too small, to be worth estimating? In the case of HWP, one way of answering 
this question is to carry out the calculations described in this guidance for Tier 1 methods. This is because: (i) the 
magnitude of the contribution made by HWP will depend on the selected approach to estimation (see Section 12.3), 
so any calculation methods need to be appropriate for the selected approach, i.e. such as Tier 1 methods; and (ii) 
the Tier 1 methods are amongst the simplest methods that can be defined for estimating CO2 emissions and 
removals arising from HWP. It follows that the more relevant key question in the case of HWP is: are activity data 
available for implementing at least Tier 1 methods? In this context, the availability of relevant statistics in publicly 
available databases such as FAOSTAT (see Section 12.4.1.1) indicates that data suitable for Tier 1 (and possibly 
Tier 2) methods are available. The above points lead naturally to STEP 1.1 below. 
STEP 1.1: Check the availability of data for the three default HWP commodity classes of sawnwood, wood-based 
panels and paper and paperboard. Detailed guidance is provided in Section 12.4.1.1. If such information is 
available, skip the next step and go to STEP 2. 
STEP 1.2: Follow the guidance provided in Section 12.4.1.2. 
STEP 2: Check the availability of country-specific methods and apply Tier 3 
STEP 2.1: Check whether country-specific methods are available that could be used to estimate emissions and 
removals of CO2 arising from HWP. For this purpose, follow the guidance provided in Section 12.4.4. If this is 
the case go to the next step, otherwise go to STEP 3. 
STEP 2.2: Check that the methodologies used are at least as detailed and accurate as under the Tier 1 method. If 
this is the case go to the next step, otherwise go to STEP 3. 
STEP 2.3: Clarify which approach is to be chosen by the country (see Section 12.3) and follow the guidance 
provided in Section 12.4.4 to apply Tier 3 for estimating CO2 emissions and removals arising from HWP. 
STEP 3: Check the availability of country-specific data and apply Tier 2 
STEP 3.1: Check whether country-specific activity data and/or emission factors are available that could be used

12.4.1.1 AVAILABILITY OF ACTIVITY DATA 
This section provides definitions for the different available HWP commodity classes representing the use of wood 
as a material as well as for other uses where relevant to estimating CO2 emissions and removals from HWP. As 
explained below, for Tier 1 and Tier 2 methods principally this involves three commodity classes of semi-finished 
wood products (sawnwood, wood-based panels and paper and paperboard), whilst certain other commodity classes 
may also be relevant, depending on the chosen HWP approach. 
The term “harvested wood products” is based on a concept consisting of the two separate elements of “forest 
harvesting” and “wood products” (Brown et al. 1998; UNFCCC 2003). Harvested wood biomass carbon captured 
and stored in solid chemicals or gases is excluded from HWP. The commodity classes of sawnwood, wood-based 
panels and paper and paperboard refer to the specific definitions of semi-finished wood products given in the 
international classification system of forest products, which are also referred to in Food and Agriculture 
Organization (FAO) statistics2. These definitions are given below, as well as for other terms commonly used, 
where these are relevant to the discussion in this section.

As shown in Figure 12.2, the forest-wood chain starts with “forest harvesting” (or “fellings”). Forest harvesting is 
then partitioned into “roundwood” (or “wood-removals”) and “slash” (generally left in the forest). Roundwood is 
then further subdivided into “industrial roundwood” and types of fuelwood and charcoal. Following the forest 
products definitions of the FAO, Figure 12.2 also shows the relationship between the aggregate commodity 
“industrial roundwood” and the three semi-finished wood product commodity classes identified above, in 
providing the feedstock for the subsequent processing of these semi-finished HWP commodities along the value 
chain (FAO 2017). The international classification system for forest products can be related to the Harmonized 
Commodity Description and Coding System (HS) of tariff nomenclature provided by the World Customs 
Organization (WCO)3.

Definitions of wood product commodities, which are relevant for the application of the guidance on estimating 
CO2 emissions and removals arising from HWP, as described in Section 12.4.2 (Tier 1), are listed below. These 
definitions are drawn from the Joint Forest Sector Questionnaire (JFSQ) as established by the Intersecretariat 
Working Group on Forest Sector Statistics4, which form the basis for the forest products statistics provided by 
FAO, for example. The JFSQ also includes conversion factors to be used for converting, for example, from nominal 
to solid volume in the compilation of statistics if required4.  
Datasets for these aggregate product commodity classes are freely and easily accessible, are updated on at least an 
annual basis with a six-month or one-year reporting lag, and time series are available for most countries worldwide5.  
DEFINITIONS FOR SEMI-FINISHED WOOD PRODUCT COMMODITIES 
The following three aggregate commodities of semi-finished wood products, by definition, represent data on wood 
being processed with the intention of using the wood as a material to make products. The definitions given are 
those referred to in FAO statistics6. 
It should be noted that there are certain specific wood product commodity classes that are explicitly excluded in 
the following definitions of the three commodity classes of semi-finished wood products. The reasons for these 
exclusions are explained in the discussion following the presentation of the definitions below. 
SAWNWOOD: “Wood that has been produced from both domestic and imported roundwood, either by sawing 
lengthways or by a profile-chipping process and that exceeds 6 mm in thickness. It includes planks, beams, joists, 
boards, rafters, scantlings, laths, boxboards and "lumber", etc., in the following forms: unplaned, planed, end-
jointed, etc. It excludes sleepers, wooden flooring, mouldings (sawnwood continuously shaped along any of its

edges or faces, like tongued, grooved, rebated, V-jointed, beaded, moulded, rounded or the like) and sawnwood 
produced by re-sawing previously sawn pieces. It is reported in cubic metres solid volume” (see Figure 12.2). 
WOOD-BASED PANELS: “This product category is an aggregate comprising veneer sheets, plywood, particle board, 
and fibreboard. It is reported in cubic metres solid volume” (see Figure 12.2). See FAO statistics7 for further 
definitions of the individual commodity classes.  
PAPER AND PAPERBOARD: “The paper and paperboard category is an aggregate category. In the production and 
trade statistics, it represents the sum of graphic papers; sanitary and household papers; packaging materials and 
other paper and paperboard. It excludes manufactured paper products such as boxes, cartons, books and magazines, 
etc. It is reported in metric tonnes” (see Figure 12.2). 
The availability of data for the above three aggregate HWP commodities in publicly available databases of 
international organizations, such as FAOSTAT, qualifies for estimating CO2 emissions and removals from HWP 
on the basis of the ‘production’ or the ‘stock-change’ approaches. For example, the presence of relevant statistics 
in the FAOSTAT database indicates that data suitable for implementation of Tier 1 or Tier 2 methods for these 
approaches are available. Further guidance for these methods is provided in Sections 12.4.2.1 and 12.4.3. All 
datasets are reported in cubic metres solid volume or metric tonnes, which is information that enables countries to 
convert the HWP data into units of carbon. 
Certain commodity classes are excluded from the above definitions for semi-finished wood products to avoid 
double-counting of wood products. For example, sleepers, V-jointed sawnwood and laminated veneer lumber 
(LVL) are excluded from the definition of sawnwood. This is because these commodities may be the result of 
subsequent processing of sawnwood and therefore are examples of finished wood products, as illustrated for V-
jointed sawnwood in Figure 12.3. This also applies (for example) to wooden flooring that is produced from 
sawnwood and/or hardboard which belongs to the commodity class of wood-based panels. Wooden flooring is 
therefore implicitly covered by the semi-finished HWP commodity classes of sawnwood and/or wood-based 
panels and included in this way in the estimates for CO2 emissions and removals arising from HWP. Thus, using 
statistical data for both sawnwood and for wooden flooring could result in double counting. There is a fourth 
aggregate commodity class of wood products within industrial roundwood, i.e. “other industrial roundwood”, as 
also shown in Figure 12.2. This commodity class is not covered by Tier 1 and Tier 2 methods because the 
constituent wood products in the commodity class have much less uniform characteristics than is the case for the 
three commodity classes defined below, including some examples of wood used for finished products (e.g. 
transmission poles and roundwood used directly in the construction of buildings). By excluding products within 
the commodity class of other industrial roundwood from Tier 1 and Tier 2 methods, in effect, the assumption is 
made of a “steady-state HWP pool” for these products (see Section 12.4.1.2). Tier 3 methods would need to be 
developed for a more sophisticated representation of this commodity class. 
Countries with available data on finished wood products produced from the default semi-finished wood product 
commodity classes may consider using these data to develop country-specific methods, following the guidance 
given in Section 12.4.3.1. Production data on finished wood products processed from the three aggregate semi-
finished product commodity classes sawnwood, wood-based panels and paper and paperboard (see Figure 12.3) 
are not included in international databases. However, the WCO HS tariff nomenclature (see earlier) does include 
some commodities for finished wood products (e.g. furniture, builders' joinery and carpentry of wood). 
Accordingly, information on such commodities could be available in national production and trade statistics. When 
using these datasets in calculations, it is good practice to consider the associated uncertainties as part of the 
uncertainty analysis (see Section 12.7).

To avoid potential non-counting and/or double counting, countries are encouraged to consult e.g. FAO 2010 for 
further clarification on the mass flows along the forest wood processing chain depending on the classification and 
definition of the relevant commodities8. The inclusion of the commodity wood pulp under the HWP commodity 
class of “paper” would for example result in double counting, as wood pulp by definition constitutes the feedstock 
for the production of paper and paperboard (see definition below and Figure 12.3). However, data on wood pulp 
are used in the default Tier 1 methods when calculating the share of HWP coming from domestic forests, when 
the ‘production’ approach is applied (see Equation 12.7). Wood pulp data may also be used in higher tier methods 
provided that double counting is avoided. 
DEFINITIONS FOR OTHER RELEVANT WOOD PRODUCT COMMODITIES 
Data on certain other wood product commodities are needed for the implementation of the ‘production’ approach 
and the ‘atmospheric-flow’ approach as discussed and defined below. The definitions are those referred to in FAO 
statistics6. 
In order to implement the ‘production’ approach, further information is needed on commodities representing the 
raw materials eventually used as feedstock for the production of the semi-finished HWP commodity classes 
defined and discussed earlier (see Figures 12.2 and 12.3 and Annex 12.A.1.2). Some possible feedstock 
commodities are not included in the default method for allocating HWP to domestic forest sources as described in 
Section 12.4.2.1, because of difficulties in determining sources and multiple uses. For example, some wood chips 
used in wood-based panel and wood pulp production come from industry co-products, whilst others could be 
recycled products and others are used for energy purposes (see Figure 12.3). Definitions of some key feedstocks 
relevant to this aspect of implementing the ‘production’ approach are provided below. 
REMOVALS/WOOD-REMOVALS: “The volume of all trees, living or dead, that are felled and removed from the 
forest, other wooded land or other felling sites. It includes natural losses that are recovered (i.e. harvested), 
removals during the year of wood felled during an earlier period, removals of non-stem wood such as stumps and 
branches (where these are harvested) and removal of trees killed or damaged by natural causes (i.e. natural losses), 
e.g. fire, windblown, insects and diseases. Please note that this includes removals from all sources within the 
country including public, private, and informal sources. It excludes bark and other non-woody biomass and any 
wood that is not removed, e.g. stumps, branches and tree tops (where these are not harvested) and felling residues 
(harvesting waste). It is reported in cubic metres solid volume underbark (i.e. excluding bark). Where it is measured 
overbark (i.e. including bark), the volume has to be adjusted downwards to convert to an underbark estimate” (see 
Figure 12.2). 
ROUNDWOOD: “All roundwood felled or otherwise harvested and removed. It comprises all wood obtained from 
removals, i.e. the quantities removed from forests and from trees outside the forest, including wood recovered 
from natural, felling and logging losses during the period, calendar year or forest year. It includes all wood removed 
with or without bark, including wood removed in its round form, or split, roughly squared or in other form (e.g. 
branches, roots, stumps and burls (where these are harvested) and wood that is roughly shaped or pointed. It is an

aggregate comprising wood fuel, including wood for charcoal and industrial roundwood (wood in the rough). It is 
reported in cubic metres solid volume underbark (i.e. excluding bark)” (see Figure 12.2). 
INDUSTRIAL ROUNDWOOD (WOOD IN THE ROUGH): “All roundwood except wood fuel. In production, it is an 
aggregate comprising sawlogs and veneer logs; pulpwood, round and split; and other industrial roundwood. It is 
reported in cubic metres solid volume underbark (i.e. excluding bark). The customs classification systems used by 
most countries do not allow the division of Industrial Roundwood trade statistics into the different end-use 
categories that have long been recognized in production statistics (i.e. sawlogs and veneer logs, pulpwood and 
other industrial roundwood). Thus, these components do not appear in trade. It excludes: telephone poles” (see 
Figure 12.2). 
OTHER INDUSTRIAL ROUNDWOOD: “Industrial roundwood (wood in the rough) other than sawlogs, veneer logs 
and/or pulpwood. It includes roundwood that will be used for poles, piling, posts, fencing, pitprops, shingles and 
shakes, wood wool, tanning, distillation and match blocks, etc. It is reported in cubic metres solid volume 
underbark (i.e. excluding bark)” (see Figure 12.2). 
WOOD PULP: “Fibrous material prepared from pulpwood, wood chips, particles or residues by mechanical and/or 
chemical process for further manufacture into paper, paperboard, fibreboard or other cellulose products. It is an 
aggregate comprising mechanical wood pulp; semi-chemical wood pulp; chemical wood pulp; and dissolving 
wood pulp” (see Figure 12.2). 
RECOVERED PAPER: “Waste and scraps of paper or paperboard that have been collected for re-use or trade. It 
includes paper and paperboard that has been used for its original purpose and residues from paper and paperboard 
production. It is reported in metric tonnes”. 
In order to implement the ‘atmospheric-flow’ approach, besides data on the trade of the commodities described 
above, further activity data are required, covering both feedstocks for processing wood for its use as a material and 
wood biomass burnt for energy purposes. These data are needed for estimating actual fluxes of carbon from woody 
biomass from and to the atmosphere within the country in a reporting year (see Sections 12.3.2 and 12.4.2.1). This 
includes several commodities as defined below. The definitions are those referred to in FAO statistics9. 
WOOD FUEL: “Roundwood that will be used as fuel for purposes such as cooking, heating or power production. It 
includes wood harvested from main stems, branches and other parts of trees (where these are harvested for fuel) 
and wood that will be used for the production of charcoal (e.g. in pit kilns and portable ovens), wood pellets and 
other agglomerates. The volume of roundwood used in charcoal production is estimated by using a factor of 6.0 to 
convert from the weight of charcoal produced to the solid volume (m3) of roundwood used in production. It also 
includes wood chips to be used for fuel that are made directly (i.e. in the forest) from roundwood. It excludes wood 
charcoal, pellets and other agglomerates. It is reported in cubic metres solid volume underbark (i.e. excluding 
bark)” (see Figure 12.2). 
WOOD CHARCOAL: “Wood carbonised by partial combustion or the application of heat from external sources. It 
includes charcoal used as a fuel or for other uses, e.g. as a reduction agent in metallurgy or as an absorption or 
filtration medium. It is reported in metric tonnes”. 
WOOD CHIPS AND PARTICLES: “Wood that has been reduced to small pieces and is suitable for pulping, for particle 
board and/or fibreboard production, for use as a fuel, or for other purposes. It excludes wood chips made directly 
in the forest from roundwood (i.e. already counted as pulpwood or wood fuel). It is reported in cubic metres solid 
volume excluding bark”. 
WOOD RESIDUES: “Other wood processing co-products. It includes wood waste and scrap not useable as timber 
such as sawmill rejects, slabs, edgings and trimmings, veneer log cores, veneer rejects, sawdust, residues from 
carpentry and joinery production, and wood residues that will be used for production of pellets and other 
agglomerated products. It excludes wood chips, made either directly in the forest from roundwood or made in the 
wood processing industry (i.e. already counted as pulpwood or wood chips and particles), and agglomerated 
products such as logs, briquettes, pellets or similar forms as well as post-consumer wood. It is reported in cubic 
metres solid volume excluding bark”. 
12.4.1.2 APPLYING THE ASSUMPTION OF A “STEADY-STATE HWP 
POOL” 
This section provides guidance on when it is in line with good practice to make the assumption that the HWP pool 
is in a steady state and explains the implications of making such an assumption.

Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
12.16 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
When the assumption is made that the pool of carbon in HWP is in a steady state, this does not imply an assumption 
that the carbon stock in HWP is zero. Rather, it implies an assumption that the carbon stock in HWP is not changing 
over time. Implicitly, it is also assumed that the annual carbon inflows into HWP in use are exactly the same in 
magnitude as the annual losses of carbon from HWP in use (otherwise the carbon stock would be changing). Hence, 
in practice, making an assumption of a “steady-state HWP pool” leads to results for the CO2 emissions arising 
from HWP that are numerically the same as when it is assumed that all the carbon in HWP is oxidised in the year 
of harvest. In previous IPCC guidance on HWP (IPCC 1997, IPCC 2006, IPCC 2014), reference has sometimes 
been made to making the assumption of “instantaneous oxidation” or to “reporting zero” for HWP, when the actual 
assumption being made is that of a “steady-state HWP pool”. However, strictly, making either of these assumptions 
is not the same as making the assumption of a “steady-state HWP pool”, hence the use of these other terms in this 
context is generally avoided in this refined guidance. 
When an assumption of a “steady-state HWP pool” is made, this does not result in carbon losses due to biomass 
harvested and utilised for HWP being ignored. Rather, these carbon losses are included implicitly as part of the 
carbon stock changes estimated for the living or dead biomass pools of forests and other wood producing land 
categories. The CO2 emissions and removals arising from the HWP pool should be estimated explicitly if possible, 
but activity data are needed to do this, e.g. as required for the Tier 1 methods as a minimum (see Sections 12.4.1.1 
or 12.4.2.1). If relevant activity data (e.g. from FAOSTAT or other sources) are not available, then it may be 
necessary to assume a “steady-state HWP pool”. 
12.4.2 Tier 1: “first order decay” method 
Provided that activity data are available for the three HWP commodity classes of semi-finished wood product 
commodities of sawnwood, wood-based panels and paper and paperboard, as defined in Section 12.4.1.1, and no 
country-specific activity data required to apply Tier 2 are available (see Section 12.4.3), estimates of CO2 
emissions and removals arising from HWP should be obtained by application of the Tier 1 method as outlined in 
this section.

The general method to estimate the magnitude of the defined carbon stock in the HWP pool in use and its net 
changes (i.e. by means of approaches as described in Section 12.4) is the first-order decay (FOD) function as 
presented in Equation 12.2. It represents a flux data method that corresponds to Equation 12.1, Chapter 12, Volume 
4 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines and Equation 2.8.5, Chapter 2 in IPCC 2014:

Further guidance on the statistical elements for calculating the relevant carbon flux into the HWP pool in use 
according to the different approaches (Inflowl (i)), including the associated Equations, is provided in Section 
12.4.2.1.  
In order to produce an estimate of the existing carbon stock in HWP in use for the application in Equation 12.2 
and based on the subsequent changes of this HWP stock, the historical wood use (i.e. the accumulation of the 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
12.18 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
historic Inflow to the HWP pool) has to be included. This procedure is needed as this also includes the historic and 
current disposals from the HWP pool, termed “inherited emissions” (IPCC 2006).  
However, the availability of activity data series, which are described in Section 12.4.2.1, varies. For most countries, 
the FAO statistics provide data on the HWP commodity classes since 1961.10 But for some countries activity data 
are available only from a later year (often 1991). This has implications for the estimated steady state of the initial 
carbon stock in HWP in use and in consequence on the uncertainties associated with the estimated CO2 emissions 
and removals arising from HWP.  As a proxy in the Tier 1 method it is thus assumed that the HWP pool is in a 
steady state at the initial time t0 from which the activity data start. This means that as a proxy ∆C(t0) is assumed to 
be equal to 0. This steady state carbon stock C(t0) for each HWP commodity class l is approximated by means of 
Equation 12.4 based on the average of Inflowl (i) during the first 5 years for which statistical data are available. 
The coverage of data on wood product commodities has changed over time. This has occurred for a number of 
reasons, but not least because the contribution of data by wood industries towards production statistics depends on 
their size. More specifically, wood processing mills and industries generally contribute data towards statistics if 
they exceed a certain threshold size. The thresholds referred to in the compilation of statistics on harvested wood 
have changed relatively little over time. However, the capacities of individual wood processing mills have 
increased, and also there have been structural developments in the wood industries, leading to greater numbers of 
larger-capacity mills, and larger industry groupings. The combination of a fairly unchanging threshold size for 
reporting statistics, and these developments in the wood industries, is very likely to mean that statistics on wood 
commodity production have become more comprehensive over time. As a result, long time series data on wood 
commodities (e.g. since 1961) might suggest that production volumes have increased over time, when this may 
simply reflect to some degree the progressive improvements in the statistics on wood commodities (Palma et al. 
2017).  
Using Equation 12.4 with the average value of Inflowl (i) over the first 5 years since 1961 (i.e. for the years 1961 
to 1965) might thus lead to biased estimates of initial carbon stocks and it is likely to result in the overestimation 
of subsequent carbon stock increases in the HWP pool. When using historical data (such as for the first 5 years 
since 1961) to provide values for calculating Inflowl (i) in Equation 12.4, it is thus good practice to verify that any 
historical trends in the relevant statistics for wood commodities reflect actual changes, rather than changes in the 
coverage of these statistics. This can help to reduce the uncertainties associated with the estimate of the existing 
carbon stock in the HWP pool in use. Otherwise, it is good practice for Equation 12.4 to be used in conjunction 
with the average value of Inflowl (i) over the first 5 years since 1990 (e.g. for the years 1990 to 1994) or later.  
By substituting Cl(t0) in Equation 12.2, the Cl (i) and ∆Cl (i) in the sequential time points can be calculated. In the 
Tier 1 method, it is good practice to use Equation 12.4 for estimating the carbon stock at t = t0.

BOX 12.1 
EXAMPLE FOR IMPLEMENTING EQUATIONS 12.2 AND 12.4 IN A SPREADSHEET (E.G. MS EXCEL) 
 
The initial carbon stock for the year 1990 is calculated by means of Equation 12.4 in cell C7. The FOD function as shown in 
Equation 12.2 is implemented in cells C8:C13. Based on the development of the carbon stock of the particular HWP commodity 
class, the stock-changes (i.e. carbon pool changes) are calculated in the cells of column D12. 
It is furthermore good practice to apply Equations 12.2 and 12.4 with activity data for the semi-finished wood 
product commodity classes of sawnwood, wood-based panels and paper and paperboard, either as aggregates or 
for each of their sub-classes as listed in Table 12.1 in Section 12.4.2.1. Further guidance on how to compile those 
relevant activity data in accordance with the respective approaches is also provided in Section 12.4.2.1. 
In combination with those semi-finished wood product commodities to be used under the Tier 1 method (see 
Section 12.4.2.1), the FOD function implicitly includes finished HWP in the carbon stock estimates. It is assumed 
that “immediate losses of the HWP pool due to final processing of wood along the processing chain (see Figure 
12.A.1, Annex 12.A.2) are described realistically by the exponential decay pattern” (Pingoud and Wagner 2006). 
The timing of emissions from wood processing residues used for energy purposes along the process chain of HWP 
are also well described by the FOD function (see Rüter and Diederichs 2012). 
ESTIMATING CO 2 FLUXES ASSOCIATED WITH HARVESTED WOOD 
PRODUCTS (‘ATMOSPHERIC-FLOW’ APPROACH) 
In the case that the ‘atmospheric-flow’ approach is applied for estimating CO2 emissions and removals arising 
from HWP, it is good practice to estimate the annual carbon fluxes into the atmosphere along the timber processing 
and wood utilization chain within the country by applying Equation 12.5. The equation reflects two components 
that enable a consistent implementation of this approach: 
The first term within the brackets in the equation represents the changes in the carbon stock in HWP in use 
within a country, obtained from the calculated domestic consumption of HWP. 
The last two terms within the brackets in the equation represent the net trade (balance of exports and imports) in 
wood feedstocks serving as wood fuel and/or as raw material for the manufacture of semi-finished HWP, to 
estimate the quantities of feedstock consumed for these purposes within a country.  
For implementing Equation 12.5, this means that firstly, it is assumed that the calculated annual gains of carbon 
in the HWP pool in use (i.e. 
InflowCl  
i ) following the ‘stock-change’ approach, see Equations 12.2 and 12.3) are 
not available for oxidation into the atmosphere in the year in which they are added to the pool. It is also assumed 
that the annual carbon losses from this HWP pool in use, calculated by means of Equation 12.2, which: 
 do not enter the carbon stock in HWP in use again due to material recycling (and which would implicitly be 
included in the annual production data, e.g. of particle board); and  
                                                           
12 Note that the calculation of the carbon stock change for a given year (for example for the year 1995, cell D12) appears to 
depend on knowledge of the magnitude of the carbon stock at the beginning of the following year (in this case 1996, cell C13). 
This is calculated by means of Equation 12.2 in cell C13, which only depends on knowledge of the magnitude of the carbon 
stock at the beginning of the year 1995 in cell C12 and on the value of Inflow during the year 1995 in cell B12 (in this example).

are available for oxidation into the atmosphere in the reporting year (e.g. through combustion) (see IPCC 2006). 
As explained above, this is represented by the first term within the brackets of Equation 12.5. 
Secondly, an estimation of CO2 emissions and removals arising from HWP following the ‘atmospheric-flow’ 
approach consistent with estimates of emissions and removals from the forest carbon pools (see Chapter 4) is based 
on the assumption that only carbon in woody biomass which: 
 becomes and/or remains available within the reporting country; and  
 is not fixed in a carbon pool.  
could eventually also oxidize into the atmosphere in the reporting year. Consequently, all carbon in harvested 
woody biomass from domestic forests (i.e. “roundwood production”, implicitly included in the forest carbon 
estimates of emissions and removals as forest carbon pool losses) that is exported in the reporting year is to be 
subtracted from the country’s remaining carbon amounts in woody biomass available for oxidation. On the other 
hand, all imported carbon in woody biomass that becomes available within the country (for example as wood fuel 
or feedstock for further processing and wood utilization along the value chain) becomes available for oxidation 
(see Figure 12.A.5 in Annex 12.A.3). As explained above, the availability of carbon in traded HWP feedstock 
commodity classes within the country is represented by the last two terms within the brackets of Equation 12.5. 
As compared to the estimates of the impact of the carbon stock in the HWP pool in use (see Equations 12.1 to 
12.4), these estimates of carbon in annual imports and exports of woody biomass to be used as wood fuel or 
feedstock (RC(i)) are needed for the reporting year or period only (see Equation 12.11).

the countries as listed in Appendix of the Annex of Decision 2/CMP.7, including information derived from Fengel and Wegener (1984), 
Paulapuro (2000), Gronfors (2010) and industry information. 
To estimate the carbon stock in the HWP pool, Tier 1 uses forest products data for semi-finished HWP 
commodities from FAO as set out in Section 12.4.1.1. As a default, the annual Inflowl (i) to the HWP pool is 
composed of the three default HWP commodity classes, i.e. sawnwood, wood-based panels, and paper and 
paperboard).  
In order to estimate carbon amounts in the semi-finished HWP commodity classes representing the material use 
of wood biomass, default conversion factors are provided in Table 12.1. The conversion factors for the HWP 
default commodities (i.e. aggregates) are largely dependent on the composition of countries’ production quantities 
of the particular sub-classes (e.g. particle board). If countries have disaggregated data on sub-classes of semi-
finished HWP as listed in Table 12.1, it is thus good practice to apply Equations 12.2 and 12.4 to the disaggregated 
sub-classes. 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
12.22 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
In order to reduce uncertainties associated with assumptions on the conversion factors applied to activity data (i.e. 
data on semi-finished wood products derived from statistics) (see Section 12.4.1.1), countries may consider using 
country-specific activity data comprising further items of the HWP sub-classes as listed in Table 12.1. More 
information can be obtained in Section 12.4.3.1. 
Depending on which approach is to be applied by the country, different elements of the annual statistics on the 
HWP commodity classes listed above are to be used for calculating the HWP activity data. These data represent 
the use of wood as material and are used in Equations 12.2 and 12.4 (see Section 12.3.2). Depending on the chosen 
approach (see Equation 12.3), these data either represent:  
(i) 
the calculated consumption of HWP within the country (‘stock-change’ approach), or  
(ii) 
the production of HWP originating from the forests within the country (‘production’ approach). 
For the ’production’ approach, the HWP activity data could be partitioned between the domestically produced and 
consumed HWP and those HWP which are exported. Furthermore, they could also be assigned to the particular 
land use category from which their carbon originates within the country (see guidance below within this section). 
If the ‘atmospheric-flow’ approach is applied, in addition to data on semi-finished HWP for estimating CO2 
emissions and removals arising from the HWP pool in use following the ‘stock-change’ approach, data on carbon 
in the imports and exports of woody biomass serving as wood fuel and/or raw material (RC) for the subsequent 
manufacturing of semi-finished HWP, are required (see Equation 12.5 and Annex 12.A.3). Table 12.2 includes 
those relevant wood product commodities including their carbon conversion factors (cf) to be applied in Equations 
12.6, 12.7, 12.9, 12.10 and/or 12.11. It is good practice to consider the relevant definitions provided in Section 
12.4.1.1 as well as the classification of wood products (see Figures 12.2 and 12.3) in order to avoid double counting.

COMPILATION OF ACTIVITY DATA FOR DOMESTICALLY CONSUMED 
HWP UNDER THE ‘PRODUCTION’ APPROACH 
If the ‘production’ approach is to be applied, it is good practice to present CO2 emissions and removals arising 
from the change in the carbon stock in domestically consumed HWP and the change in the carbon stock in exported 
HWP separately in order to increase transparency. For this purpose, the annual carbon inflow to the HWP pool of 
the particular HWP commodity class that is domestically consumed (InflowPADC(i)) is to be calculated by means 
of Equation 12.9. This is particularly relevant in those cases where country-specific emission factors are being 
applied (see Section 12.4.3.2).

OPTION TO ALLOCATE HWP TO RELEVANT LAND-USE CATEGORIES 
UNDER THE ‘PRODUCTION’ APPROACH 
In principle, the carbon in HWP could furthermore be allocated to particular land use categories (e.g. Forest Land 
remaining Forest Land, or any other land use category converted to Forest Land). 
If country-specific methods are not available to allocate domestic harvest and subsequently produced HWP to 
different land use categories (e.g. by track and trace systems), it is possible to apply Equation 12.10 to calculate 
the carbon inflow to the HWP pool of the particular semi-finished HWP commodity class for the ‘production’ 
approach (i.e. 
InflowPAl  
i ), by considering also the annual fraction of HWP derived from the specific land use 
category (𝑓𝑗(𝑖)).

Where countries already collect harvest data discriminating between different land use categories, and between 
material and energy use of harvested roundwood (i.e. industrial roundwood and fuelwood, see Figure 12.2), this 
information can be used. This is usually the case where countries apply the gain-loss (i.e. flux data) method13.  
Most countries only report statistics on production of industrial roundwood from forests, and the uncertainties 
associated with feedstock for HWP production (see Figure 12.2) originating from land use categories other than 
forest-related are generally expected to be insignificant. Nevertheless, there is also industrial roundwood provided 
to the markets from land uses other than forests, such as cropland (e.g. short-rotation coppice).

2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Countries that apply the stock-difference method to estimate carbon stock changes in the living biomass pool need 
to collect additional data for estimating harvest fractions associated with the particular land use category j. When 
countries cannot track the harvested wood by the land of origin and by different uses of wood (i.e. industrial 
roundwood, fuelwood), the following guidance could be applied. 
For Forest Land converted to other land use categories, the starting information is the standing volume of trees 
before the land use conversion, which corresponds to the total harvest (i.e. fellings). The following steps apply: 
STEP 1: Disaggregate the harvest into roundwood and slash by one of the following methods.  
 Either multiply the standing volume by the ratio of roundwood to total harvested removals that has been 
calculated for other activities or at national level; 
 Or divide the standing volume by the biomass expansion factors (BEF2)14, thereby deriving the amount of 
roundwood. 
STEP 2: Disaggregate the roundwood into industrial roundwood and fuelwood (see Figure 12.2) by one of the 
following methods.  
 Either multiply the roundwood by the ratio of industrial roundwood to roundwood that has been calculated for 
other activities or at national level; 
 Or multiply the industrial roundwood data (IRW) derived from Equation 12.8 by the factor 0.8715 in order to 
exclude harvest losses, bark (see FAO roundwood definition, Section 12.4.1.1) and fuelwood not covered by 
the statistics and subsequently disaggregate the result by using the proportion derived from FAOSTAT 
production data of the commodities industrial roundwood and wood fuel.  
For land use categories converted to Forest Land, the starting information is the standing volume of trees from 
which fellings is derived according to the age-class structure and/or yield tables and/or information on the timing 
of harvesting and thinning operations for each management system. Then, STEPS 1 and 2 as described above for 
Forest Lands converted to other land use categories apply in order to divide harvest into roundwood and slash and 
disaggregate roundwood into industrial roundwood and fuelwood. 
For land use categories that are not covered under any forest-related land use category (see Volume 4, chapters 5 
to 9), and that produce identifiable amounts of harvest (i.e. lands from which timber is extracted), then the country 
may estimate the amount of industrial roundwood annually produced from those land use categories in order to 
exclude it from the HWP estimation. 
Industrial roundwood from the above land use categories could be estimated by one of two methods: 
 For each tree species, subtracting the amount of harvest originating from land use categories subject to land-
use change from total amount of harvest. The remaining amount is apportioned between Forest Land remaining 
Forest Land and other land use categories from which significant amounts of timber are extracted, based on 
the proportion of the total area covered by each species under Forest Land remaining Forest Land and under 
those other land use categories.  
 By subtracting the amount of fellings originating from land use categories subject to land-use change, as 
quantified by available data or as estimated according to above-listed guidance, from the total harvest. The 
remaining quantity can be apportioned on the basis of the proportion of the area under Forest Land remaining 
Forest Land and under the other land use categories. 
Once the quantity of fellings has been apportioned to land use categories other than forest-related land from which 
identifiable amounts of timber are extracted, the industrial roundwood is estimated by applying the same steps as 
those described for land use categories subject to land use change. 
Finally, the amount of industrial roundwood produced from Forest Land remaining Forest Land is estimated by 
subtracting the quantity of fellings originating from land use categories subject to land-use change and those land 
use categories other than Forest Land remaining Forest Land, from the total harvest. The amount of industrial 
roundwood from Forest Land remaining Forest Land can be calculated in line with the guidance given above.  
If a ratio of industrial roundwood originated from the identified land use category cannot be estimated for the 
whole time series, it is suggested to derive missing values from the ratios that have been calculated according to 
methods of gap-filling as provided in Volume 1, Chapter 5 of this Refinement.

Countries that use the stock-difference method to estimate forest carbon stock changes as outlined in Volume 4, 
Chapters 2 and 4 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, and that apply the above method for estimating the fellings for the 
forest-related land use categories subject to land-use change and/or for Forest Land remaining Forest Land, are 
encouraged to ensure the quality of estimated values of harvesting by checking their consistency with the estimated 
net changes in above-ground biomass. 
COMPILATION OF ADDITIONAL ACTIVITY DATA REQUIRED FOR THE 
‘ATMOSPHERIC-FLOW’ APPROACH 
In order to implement the ‘atmospheric-flow’ approach, in addition to the activity data calculated by means of 
Equation 12.6, the sum of all exported and all imported carbon in woody biomass serving as wood fuel and/or 
feedstock for the manufacturing of semi-finished HWP, is to be calculated. Equation 12.11 enables the calculation 
of carbon in imports and exports as elements of trade in those feedstock commodities for further use in Equation 
12.5.

If the ‘atmospheric-flow’ approach is chosen, it is good practice to apply Equation 12.10 to all HWP feedstock 
commodities listed in Table 12.2, in order to cover all relevant carbon fluxes in traded woody biomass. This ensures 
that all imported HWP feedstock commodities and all exported HWP feedstock commodities are included, as is 
consistent with the system boundary of the ‘atmospheric-flow’ approach. 
12.4.2.2 EMISSION FACTORS 
The rate at which carbon in the Tier 1 default HWP commodity classes is removed from the HWP pool in service 
in a given year is specified by a constant decay rate (k) expressed as a half-life in years (see Equation 12.2 and 
Box 12.1). The 2006 IPCC Guidelines define the half-life as “the number of years it takes to lose one half of the 
material currently in the pool’’. As the half-life in this context refers to HWP in use (i.e. Section 12.3), the half-
life to be applied is a function of the adjusted estimated service life (ESL) of the particular HWP commodities 
(with HL = Adjusted ESL * ln (2), see Section 12.4.3.2).  
The Tier 1 method involves applying the default half-lives of the three semi-finished HWP commodity classes 
based on information provided in IPCC 2003, IPCC 2006 and IPCC 2014, as given in Table 12.3. The same half-
lives apply for the particular sub-classes of these aggregate commodity classes of semi-finished HWP as specified 
in Table 12.1 (Section 12.4.2.1).

12.4.3 Tier 2 method using country-specific data 
Under Tier 2, estimates of the annual CO2 emissions and removals arising from HWP are derived using the same 
Equations as provided for Tier 1 in Section 12.4.2. In following a Tier 2 method, either country-specific activity 
data and/or country-specific emission factors are to be applied.  
This section provides good practice guidance on the use of:  
(i) 
Country-specific activity data that are consistent with the Tier 2 method (Section 12.4.3.1) as 
appropriate for each approach, as described in Section 12.4.2.1, and 
(ii) 
Country-specific emission factors following the concept of service life and half-life information to 
estimate CO2 emissions and removals arising from HWP by means of the FOD function (Equation 12.2) 
as provided for Tier 1 (Section 12.4.3.2). 
12.4.3.1 COUNTRY-SPECIFIC ACTIVITY DATA 
This section provides guidance on how to derive country-specific activity data that is consistent with the 
application of the first order decay function.  
For this purpose, it is good practice for activity data (i.e. based on national surveys) to follow the international 
classification system for forest products consistent with the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding 
System (HS) of tariff nomenclature, presenting data in more detail than implemented in FAOSTAT (see Section 
12.4.1.1). It is highly desirable for these data sources to be publically available for the sake of transparency and 
verifiability. However, the use of such country-specific information in some cases might also involve aspects 
related to country-specific institutional arrangements, for example, with respect to the use on occasion of 
confidential industry data. For this reason, data sources subject to confidentiality constraints, no matter how 
potentially useful, may be unsuitable for use in calculations, unless it is possible for the information to be shared 
for the purposes of transparency and verification. 
In order to calculate the annual carbon inflow (Inflowl (i)) required for Equation 12.2 and subsequent Equations in 
Section 12.4.1.2, carbon conversion factors that reflect the commodity definitions should be applied (e.g. density, 
woody biomass content, and tree species). 
12.4.3.2 COUNTRY-SPECIFIC EMISSION FACTORS 
In order to reduce uncertainties associated with the assumptions behind the default Tier 1 half-lives of the HWP 
commodities (see Section 12.7), countries may consider using Tier 2, country-specific half-lives, both for the 
domestic use of HWP commodity classes, and also for the importing country in the case of exported HWP 
commodity classes (where relevant).  
This section gives guidance on how to derive country-specific service and half-life information to estimate CO2 
emissions and removals arising from HWP on the basis of the FOD function as included in Equation 12.2 (see 
Section 12.4.2).  
In the following, guidance is provided on how to derive country-specific half-life values that can be used for that 
purpose, following the ISO 15686 standard series approach, since this is an already established system for service 
                                                           
16 Half-lives are based on Table 3a.1.3 of the GPG-LULUCF. 
17 HWP commodity classes refer to the commodities sawnwood, wood-based panels, paper and paperboard, according to the 
international classification system for forest products (see guidance in Section 12.4.1.1) 
 
Chapter 12: Harvested Wood Products 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
12.29 
life estimation on a national (not case specific) level, in combination with obsolescence on a national level (see 
Box 12.2).  
It contains an example on how to improve service life estimates and subsequent HWP half-life calculation for the 
HWP commodity classes based on the ISO 15686 series in combination with an obsolescence factor and 
information on market share. 
In order to adequately implement Equation 12.2, in conjunction with information on country-specific HWP service 
life (i.e. the time carbon is held in the HWP pool in use before the products are disposed of or recycled), in addition 
to the product half-life (see Section 12.4.2.2), the following terms and concepts are to be distinguished: 
 ISO 15686-1:2011 defines the reference service life (RSL) as the service life of a product, component, assembly 
or system which is known to be expected under a particular (reference) set of in-use conditions; 
 The ESL on the other hand is the service life that a wooden or wood based component would be expected to 
have in a set of specific in-use conditions. It is determined from RSL data after taking into account any 
differences from the reference in-use conditions (ISO 15686-1:2011); 
 The factor method is used to calculate the ESL. It is a modification of RSL by seven factors (see Box 12.2) to 
take account of the specific in-use conditions (ISO 15686-8:2008); 
 Obsolescence arises (according to ISO 15686-1:2011) when a facility can no longer be adapted to satisfy 
changing requirements. Obsolescence tends to result from unexpected changes, often unrelated to the 
construction, and includes: 
(i) 
Functional obsolescence: function no longer required. 
(ii) 
Technological obsolescence: new alternatives can offer better performance, or there is a change in the 
pattern of use. 
(iii) 
Economic obsolescence: Fully functional but less efficient, or more expensive than alternatives. This 
includes replacement owing to changing fashion or taste. 
ISO (2011) states that estimates of obsolescence should be based on the designer’s and client’s experience, and, if 
possible, documented feedback from practice. In order to estimate the carbon storage of HWP in use and its impact 
on emissions/removals by means of flux data methods using country-specific service life information, it is thus 
good practice to take into account obsolescence and to distinguish replacement of HWP in use due to e.g. defective 
performance from obsolescence (see ISO 2011).  
For example: 
In northern Europe, wooden decking can last for 50 years or more given proper construction and choice of material. 
But the same decking is likely to be replaced within 20 years for aesthetic or other reasons. Hence, for calculating 
country-specific ESL or half-life values an obsolescence factor is needed in Tier 3 estimates of CO2 emissions and 
removals arising from HWP to reflect the time actually spent in the HWP carbon pool, not the potential full-service 
life of a wooden component given by ESL. 
In this guidance document, the ESL is applied for estimates on a national level and not for a specific case as 
suggested in the ISO 15686 standard series. To include the effect of obsolescence:  
 Either an additional obsolescence factor (O) is included: with  
(i) 
Obsolescence = 1 when there is considered to be no significant effect of obsolescence compared to RSL; 
(ii) 
Obsolescence is given a value < 1 based on the intensity of obsolescence; 
(iii) 
Obsolescence can never be larger than 1; 
 Or a decay function to be assigned that uses the service life data to estimate the decay profile (based on products 
leaving the pool, rather than a biological decay profile) or the actual time that products take to go out-of-use.18 
An example of how to derive national service life estimates by means of the factor method is given in the box 12.2 
below.

BOX 12.2 
EXAMPLE ON THE CALCULATION OF NATIONAL ESL BY MEANS OF FACTOR METHOD 
A theoretical example with wooden claddings in Norway is given based on ISO 15686-8:2008 but 
elevated from the case specific level given in the standard to a national level. Details about RSL and 
service life estimation are in ISO 15686-8:2008.  
A factor of “1” is used when the factor does not deviate from the RSL conditions. A higher value 
(x>1) is given if the national performance is better than RSL conditions; a lower value (x<1) is given 
if the national performance is lower than the RSL conditions. Non-relevant factors are excluded 
from the equation.  
The RSL is based on accelerated field trials and the threshold for failure was defined when the mean 
decay rating reached 2 (on a scale from 0–4 where 0 is no decay and 4 is failure). 
National ESL = 55(RSL)*1(A)*1(B)*1(C)*1.2(E)*1(F)*0.9(G) = 59.4 years  
Factor D ‘indoor environment’ is excluded because it is not relevant. It is good practice to include 
factors that do not deviate from the RSL even if they do not contribute in changing the RSL since 
they are given the value 1. 
A = Inherent performance level represents the grade of the component as supplied.  
- Here equals the RSL. 
B = Design level reflects the component’s installation in the building/constructed asset and is 
typically based on the level of shelter and protection from agents provided by the design of the 
building/constructed asset.  
- Here equals the RSL. 
C = Work execution level considers the level of skill and control in site-work. 
- Here equals the RSL. 
D = Indoor environment considers the exposure of the object to indoor agents of degradation and 
their severity.  
- Not relevant in this example. 
E = Outdoor environment considers exposure to outdoor agents of degradation and their severity.    
- In this example, the climate on a national level is less harsh than at the test sites included in RSL. 
F = Usage conditions reflects the effect of the use of the building/constructed asset. 
- Here equals the RSL. 
G = Maintenance level reflects the level of maintenance assumed. For certain components that are 
inaccessible or require special equipment for access, a particularly low maintenance level should be 
considered. 
- Here slightly lower than RSL intervals. 
Another example in Table 12.4 shows how to derive country-specific half-life values for the three default HWP 
commodity classes (see Section 12.4.2.1), as a function of information on market share of the use of wood (see 
above), ESL and obsolescence. The use of composite HWP categories (i.e. categories of wood products made up 
from more than one semi-finished wood product commodity class) in different markets, such as in the construction 
sector, can be divided further into different segments (e.g. wall systems, flooring, and roof construction). These 
different segments normally have different service lives and obsolescence factors. Hence, countries are encouraged 
to allocate the contribution of the different HWP commodity classes or sub-classes (e.g. coniferous sawnwood) to 
markets and their segments in order to obtain improved service life estimates for the particular HWP commodity 
classes. Therefore, it is important to note that the assumed service life is driven by the technical properties of 
products and, depending on this, its particular application area (e.g. load-bearing beam or wood panelling, both 
made of sawnwood). Thus, in order to calculate a country-specific emission factor (i.e. service- or half-life), 
different sources of information, e.g. on the market use of different HWP commodity classes, could be combined 
as illustrated in Table 12.4. 
The definition of half-life and also guidance on how to calculate half-life is provided in Section 12.4.2.2.

* As the use of the HWP commodity classes in different markets, such as the construction sector, consists of different end uses (e.g. wall 
systems, flooring, roof construction), countries are encouraged to allocate the contribution of the different end uses to the relevant HWP 
commodity class or sub-class (e.g. non-coniferous sawnwood used for windows). 
COUNTRY-SPECIFIC HALF-LIFE DATA TO BE USED FOR EXPORTED HWP 
UNDER A ‘PRODUCTION’ APPROACH 
In the case that CO2 emissions and removals arising from HWP are estimated on the basis of the ‘production’ 
approach (Section 12.4.2.1) and country-specific half-life information is to be used also for the exported HWP, it 
is good practice to use the half-life information from the importing country. For this purpose, it is necessary to 
quantify export activity data within the HWP commodity classes and/or sub-classes (see Section 12.4.1.1). 
Furthermore, in order to ensure that the country-specific half-life information from the importing country complies 
with the commodity classes of the activity data for the exported HWP, it is good practice only to apply country-
specific half-life information in the case that the same commodity classes of activity data for the exported HWP 
in both the exporting and importing country are used. Otherwise the default values from Tier 1 are to be used 
(Section 12.4.2.2).  
In order to increase transparency, it is good practice to report CO2 emissions and removals arising from HWP 
from domestically consumed and exported wood separately. 
12.4.4 Tier 3 country-specific methods 
As noted in Annex 12.A, when developing Tier 3 methods for HWP, care is needed to ensure that methods for 
HWP and for carbon stock changes in wood-producing land categories (e.g. forests) are designed to avoid non-
counting or double-counting of CO2 emissions or removals,  
12.4.4.1 FLUX DATA METHODS 
In theory, decay functions other than the one described for Tier 1 could be used to apply a flux data method. 
However, it should be noted that, as stated in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, depending on the selected approach, it is 
“more difficult to develop Tier 3 methods”, especially in the case where the ‘production’ approach is selected 
“which requires data on the lifecycle of exported HWP for countries where most of its products are exported” 
(IPCC 2006).  
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
12.32 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
ACTIVITY DATA USED IN COUNTRY-SPECIFIC FLUX DATA METHODS 
In general, activity data could also be established and combined with suitable service life information differently 
from the HWP commodity classes as suggested in Section 12.4.1.1.  
This could include for example statistics on finished products. However, it should be noted that, in many cases, 
such information is provided only in units per piece, which makes it difficult to convert such data to carbon 
amounts. 
In order to ensure that the country-specific methodology used is at least as accurate as the one described in Section 
12.4.2, it is good practice to ensure that the country-specific HWP commodity classes cover the volumes as 
described by the default HWP commodity classes following the international classification system (see Section 
12.4.1.1), in line with the approach (i.e. system boundary) chosen by the country (see Section 12.3 and Annex 
12.A).  
In the case that the country does provide HWP data in FAOSTAT following the international classification system 
(see Section 12.4.1.1), it is also good practice to explain the relation of the country-specific HWP commodity 
classes to the FAOSTAT data to ensure that the data relates to the approach selected by the country. 
In the case that the country-specific commodity classes representing the carbon flux into the HWP carbon pool do 
not cover all the relevant HWP elements reflecting the material use of HWP in the selected approach (see Section 
12.3 and 12.4.2.1), it is furthermore good practice to combine the country-specific flux data method with other 
suitable methodologies (see Section 12.4.4.3). 
Furthermore, countries are encouraged to make the country-specific HWP commodity classes broad enough to 
capture significant carbon volumes contributing to the HWP pool. As a guide, the volumes of these commodity 
classes may be deemed significant if they represent at least 5percent of the total HWP volumes as described by the 
particular approach selected by the country.  
EMISSION FACTORS USED IN COUNTRY-SPECIFIC FLUX DATA 
METHODS 
In order to derive country-specific service and half-life information to be used in combination with activity data 
used in country-specific flux data methods, it is good practice to ensure that the country-specific parameters are 
applicable for the commodity classes of HWP represented in activity data applied under the selected Tier 3 method. 
It is furthermore important to note that service and half-life values representing the material use of wood can differ 
significantly between and within countries, depending on factors such as construction practices, culture, fashion, 
and climate. Thus, where such country-specific information is used, a national quality control system is encouraged 
in order to provide transparent and verifiable data. 
Potential sources that could be used to derive country-specific service life values e.g. for combination with data 
on finished wood products, include, for example, national surveys on the final market use of wood.  
12.4.4.2 DIRECT INVENTORY METHODS 
The HWP direct inventory methods use HWP carbon pool data for two, or preferably more, separate points in time 
to estimate changes in the pool. In practice, its application is only easy to implement for estimating carbon stocks 
in the HWP pool located in the reporting country alone. It can be used to estimate the annual change in carbon 
stock of some specific elements of the HWP pool such as finished products and uses (e.g. wooden houses) (see 
Figure 12.3). The HWP pool of products in use in building structures is frequently a major part of the total HWP 
pool. The amount of HWP carbon can be estimated, for example by multiplying the average HWP content per 
square metre of floor space by the total floor area for relevant building types that use wood, taking into account 
when the buildings were constructed and changes in wood use per square meter over time. Annual change in 
carbon stock could be estimated by noting the change between inventories estimated at different points in time.  
In direct inventory methods, no procedure for adding up wood use data from historical data is needed to estimate 
the existing HWP stock or annual change in stock, which is an advantage compared to the flux methods (IPCC 
2006).  
Depending on the selected approach by the country, and the availability of activity data other than described in 
Section 12.4.1.1., there might be the need to combine direct inventory information with estimates derived by means 
of flux data methods (see Section 12.4.4.3).  
Where estimates follow the ‘production’ approach (see Sections 12.3 and 12.A.2.2), the application of direct 
inventory methods does not allow the identification of the proportion of the HWP carbon stock originating from 
domestic forests (see Section 12.4.2.1). It is also not possible to estimate the carbon stock in the exported share of 
 
Chapter 12: Harvested Wood Products 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
12.33 
domestically produced HWP by means of inventories themselves (see 12.4.4.3). Following this approach 
furthermore requires excluding imported HWP from the estimated HWP pool, thereby increasing the uncertainties. 
Since in practice inventory data are not available for all finished HWP for domestic and export markets covering 
the default HWP semi-finished commodity classes of sawnwood, wood-based panels, paper and paperboard (e.g. 
wooden houses, furniture, newspaper), it is good practice to apply direct inventory methods only in combination 
with flux data methods.  
In cases where a country applies direct inventory methods for specific HWP end uses (e.g. the housing sector), it 
is good practice to estimate CO2 emissions and removals arising from HWP for the remaining fraction of the three 
HWP default commodities representing the material use of wood in combination with a flux data method (e.g. 
Equation 12.2). 
12.4.4.3 COMBINED HWP DIRECT INVENTORY AND FLUX DATA 
METHODS 
The application of a combined method is specifically relevant in the case where direct inventory information is to 
be used in combination with the ‘production’ approach. For this purpose, the three semi-finished HWP commodity 
classes being used in the housing sector need to be factored out from the flux data calculation to avoid double-
counting (see Section 12.4.1.1). Examples of such combined direct inventory and flux data methods are reported 
in Gjesdal et al. (1996) for Norway, in Pingoud et al., (2001), Statistics Finland (2010) for Finland, and National 
Institute for Environmental Studies (2018) for Japan. 
12.5 
HARVESTED WOOD BIOMASS USED FOR 
ENERGY PURPOSES  
This section clarifies how and where wood biomass that is harvested and extracted from forests and other wood 
producing land categories, and then burnt at some point in time, is covered in GHG inventories. This includes an 
explanation of where this activity is represented in different GHG inventory sectors and where to find relevant 
guidance. 
12.5.1 Treatment of CO2 emissions from wood biomass 
burnt and used for energy purposes 
This section discusses how the calculation and reporting of CO2 emissions from wood biomass used for energy 
purposes depends on the choice of HWP approach, in terms of the conceptual framework and system boundary of 
each approach. The main purpose of this discussion is to clarify where CO2 emissions from wood biomass burnt 
for energy purposes are reported in GHG inventories, in particular, whether they are estimated by a producing 
country (i.e. a country where wood is harvested) or consuming country (i.e. a country where the wood products 
are used). 
The CO2 emissions from wood biomass burnt are reported in the AFOLU sector. However, these CO2 emissions 
may be estimated as an implicit component of carbon stock changes estimated for forests and other wood producing 
land categories, or as part of carbon stock changes in the HWP pool. The details depend on the approach applied 
for calculating CO2 emissions and removals arising from HWP in use. 
The CO2 emissions from wood biomass burnt are not reported in either the Energy sector (burnt for energy 
purposes) or Waste sector (burnt or lost without energy recovery). This is to avoid the possibility of double 
counting these emissions in two or more GHG inventory sectors because they are already included in the AFOLU 
sector. When using inventory estimates to assess the CO2 emissions arising from energy use, including wood for 
energy purposes, it is necessary to consider relevant emissions estimated in the Energy and AFOLU sectors. 
When considering CO2 emissions from harvested wood biomass used for energy purposes, it should be recognised 
that harvested wood biomass may be burnt or otherwise lost at different stages in the utilisation of harvested wood. 
In this context, several elements of wood biomass may be identified: 
 ‘Harvested wood biomass used directly as energy feedstocks’: these consist of harvested wood used directly 
as feedstocks to produce energy. This includes harvested wood biomass burnt directly as fuel wood on a 
residential, commercial or industrial scale, and harvested wood biomass used directly as a feedstock for 
biofuels. Also included here is wood biomass burnt for process energy in the manufacture of energy wood 
products (such as wood chips, briquettes and pellets), and in the manufacture of biofuels. 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
12.34 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
 ‘Industrial residues from manufacturing semi-finished wood products’: these consist of industrial residues 
generated along the process chain in the manufacture of semi-finished wood products. Some of these residues 
may also be burnt or lost without energy recovery. 
 ‘Industrial residues from manufacturing finished wood products in use’: these consist of industrial residues 
generated along the process chain in the manufacture of finished wood products from semi-finished wood 
products. Some of these residues may also be burnt or lost without energy recovery. 
 ‘Wood biomass collected and burnt as post-consumer waste’: these consist of wood biomass collected and 
burnt as post-consumer wood (i.e. recovered wood), including industrial-scale incineration, with or without 
energy recovery. 
For clarity, it is also relevant to consider ‘unutilized wood harvest residues’ in GHG inventories. These consist of 
residual wood biomass generated as part of harvesting but not extracted from the forest or other wood-producing 
land categories, which is left to rot on site, or burnt on site as waste. This is equivalent to the biomass referred to 
as slash in Figure 12.2 (Section 12.4.1.1). 
Table 12.5 gives a summary of the implications for reporting CO2 emissions from wood biomass burnt by 
producing or consuming countries under different HWP approaches, referring to the elements of wood biomass 
described above. For clarity, and to allow comparison, the table also shows the implications of taking the decision 
not to explicitly report CO2 emissions and removals arising from HWP (i.e. to assume “a steady-state HWP pool”, 
see Section 12.4.1.2).

* Discussion of the ‘production’ approach in this section also applies for the ‘simple-decay’ approach (see Section 12.3 and Annex 12.A) 
** In the case of the ‘stock-change’ approach, strictly, CO2 emissions from wood biomass collected and burnt as post-consumer waste are 
only reported by a consuming country if the finished wood products are consumed and used in the country where they are manufactured 
and are not exported to another country. 
The CO2 emissions from burning ‘unutilized wood harvest residues’ without energy recovery, generated as part of 
harvesting, are included as  a component of the CO2 emissions and removals estimated for forests and other wood 
producing land categories, and are reported by the producing country. 
In the case of ‘harvested wood biomass used directly as energy feedstocks’, when applying the ‘stock-change’ or 
‘production’ approaches, CO2 emissions are estimated for the producing country. This is a reflection of the 
conceptual framework behind the ‘stock-change’ and ‘production’ approaches (see Section 12.3.1), which involve 
estimating CO2 emissions and removals arising from HWP by means of changes in defined carbon stocks in the 
HWP pool. Harvested wood biomass used directly as a feedstock for energy purposes is assumed to be burnt in 
the same year as it is harvested. Hence, conceptually, there is no carbon pool associated with this use of wood. As 
a consequence, under the ‘stock-change’ and ‘production’ approaches, the CO2 emissions are included implicitly 
as a component of the net CO2 emissions and removals associated with forests and other wood producing land 
categories (i.e. as part of losses from above ground standing biomass), as estimated for the producing country. 
 
Chapter 12: Harvested Wood Products 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
12.35 
The ‘atmospheric-flow’ approach focusses on identifying and quantifying CO2 fluxes to the atmosphere from HWP, 
taking place within national boundaries. The CO2 emissions from burning ‘harvested wood biomass used directly 
as energy feedstocks’ are thus estimated for the country where the wood biomass is used (i.e. by the consuming 
country). 
In the case of ‘industrial residues from manufacturing semi-finished wood products’, when applying the ‘stock-
change’ or ‘production’ approaches, CO2 emissions are reported by the producing country. This reflects the 
application of approaches following the conceptual framework which focusses on estimating CO2 emissions and 
removals arising from HWP on the basis of changes in defined carbon stocks in the HWP pool. Essentially, this is 
for the same reasons as given for ‘harvested wood biomass used directly as energy feedstocks’. In this case, these 
industrial residues are by-products of the processes involved in the conversion of industrial roundwood into semi-
finished products. A proportion of these residues are not used for energy purposes but instead become feedstocks 
for wood-based panels and paper products. In such cases, these residues are included in the relevant activity data 
for these product commodity classes (see Section 12.4.1.1). The remainder, generally consumed for energy 
purposes, do not form part of the statistics for semi-finished wood products and so are not considered as part of 
the carbon pool changes in HWP under the ‘stock-change’ and ‘production’ approaches. As a consequence, under 
these approaches, the CO2 emissions are included implicitly as a component of the net CO2 emissions and removals 
associated with forests and other wood producing land categories (i.e. as part of losses from above ground standing 
biomass), as estimated for the producing country.  
Under the ‘atmospheric-flow’ approach, a consuming country reports the CO2 emissions from burning biomass 
generated as ‘industrial residues from manufacturing semi-finished wood products’. 
In the case of ‘industrial residues from manufacturing finished wood products in use’, when applying the method 
as set out in Section 12.4.2 for Tier 1 and Section 12.4.3 for Tier 2, CO2 emissions are estimated as an implicit 
component of the losses from the defined HWP pool in use. These estimated emissions are calculated from data 
on semi-finished wood products by applying FOD functions to these products (see Section 12.4.2). As a 
consequence, the representation of CO2 emissions from these industrial residues (either by a producing country or 
consuming country) depends on the selected HWP calculation approach. Under the ‘stock-change’ and the 
‘atmospheric-flow’ approach, CO2 emissions are estimated by the consuming country. Under the ‘production’ 
approach, CO2 emissions are estimated by the producing country. 
Note that, under Tier 1 and 2 methods, CO2 emissions from these industrial residues are estimated, regardless of 
whether the residues are burnt with energy recovery, burnt without energy recovery, or lost (e.g. decay) as waste. 
When applying a Tier 3 method, the calculation methods should be designed to ensure that the estimation of CO2 
emissions from these industrial residues (either by a producing country or consuming country) is consistent with 
the selected HWP approach. 
In the case of ‘wood biomass collected and burnt as post-consumer waste’, CO2 emissions are treated in the same 
way as industrial residues burnt or lost during the manufacture of finished products in use, as described 
immediately above. 
12.5.2 Treatment of non-CO2 emissions from wood biomass 
burnt and used for energy purposes 
Non-CO2 emissions from wood biomass burnt and used for energy purposes are reported in the Energy sector and 
are consistently reported by the country in which the biomass is consumed. As a consequence, the CO2 and non-
CO2 emissions from burning wood biomass for energy purposes may be reported by the same country (i.e. a 
consuming country) or by different countries, depending on the approach applied for calculating CO2 emissions 
and removals arising from HWP in use. When CO2 emissions from burning wood biomass for energy are estimated 
for a country for information purposes in the Energy sector, these emissions are calculated consistently with the 
reporting of related non-CO2 emissions from burning the biomass in the consuming country (see 2006 IPCC 
Guidelines Vol 2, Chapter 2, Section 2.3.3.4). Depending on the selected HWP approach, the estimates of CO2 
emissions in the Energy sector may or may not be consistent with the estimates in the AFOLU sector.

12.6 
CLARIFICATION OF THE TREATMENT OF 
“WOOD IN SWDS” IN THIS GUIDANCE 
This section provides clarification of where the best available guidance may be found for estimating emissions 
from HWP in SWDS.  
Great care is needed when interpreting and using activity data derived from waste statistics on the one hand and 
national and international forest products statistics on HWP production and consumption, which follow the 
international classification system for wood commodities, on the other hand. For example, significant quantities 
of HWP may be burnt for energy or recycled at the end of life, while waste statistics generally include biomass 
from sources other than HWP (e.g. garden waste). Therefore, generally wood production and wood consumption 
statistics cannot be used without modifications to estimate quantities of HWP entering SWDS. It may also be 
difficult to relate estimates of wood disposed of in SWDS derived from waste statistics to estimates of HWP in 
use. Consequently, there may be some inconsistency in estimates of CO2 emissions and removals arising from 
HWP in the AFOLU sector and estimates for wood disposed of in SWDS in the Waste sector. 
12.6.1 Representation of CO2 emissions from wood biomass 
in SWDS 
In the methods provided in this Chapter, losses of HWP in use are assumed to result in CO2 emissions to the 
atmosphere, with no explicit representation of the subsequent retention of disposed wood in SWDS and eventual 
CO2 emissions from SWDS. It may be useful to quantify the CO2 emissions from wood biomass disposed of in 
SWDS to allow checks on consistency in the estimation of emissions in the Waste and AFOLU sectors. 
It should be noted that estimates of CO2 emissions from wood disposed of in SWDS (if estimated to permit checks 
on consistency) will only be consistent with estimates for the Waste sector (including for methane emissions) if 
calculated by applying a consistent approach (which, in this specific context, is the ‘stock-change’ approach). For 
the estimation of these emissions, the guidelines for HWP advise GHG inventory compilers to apply either the 
Tier 1 method with default parameter values as described in guidance for the Waste sector, or a Tier 2 method for 
the Waste sector, with country-specific parameter values. If the ‘stock-change’ approach is applied, the inflow to 
the Tier 1 or Tier 2 calculation consists of the calculated domestic consumption of wood discarded to SWDS, 
whilst the outflow is calculated based on a first order decay function (see 2006 IPCC Guidelines Volume 5, Annex 
3A.1). The Waste Sector guidelines explain how to use Waste Sector default data and parameters to estimate the 
quantity of discarded solid wood and paper carbon that accumulates in SWDS in the estimating country. When 
applying the Waste Sector Tier 1 method, estimates of carbon emitted to the atmosphere from SWDS are calculated 
by identifying the portion of carbon discarded to SWDS in the current year which is judged to have originated as 
harvested wood biomass. It should be noted that Tier 1 FOD model for SWDS provides not only CH4 emission 
from degradable organic matter (DOCm) in SWDS, but also CO2 emissions from DOCm in SWDS, as well as the 
amount of long-stored carbon (non-degradable carbon) in SWDS (See 2006 IPCC Guidelines, Volume 5, Chapter 
3, Section 3.2). When countries explicitly identify the CH4 emissions and long stored carbon originating from 
disposed wood in SWDS, the carbon contained in these elements may be subtracted from the release of CO2 from 
HWP. 
12.6.2 Representation of non-CO2 (methane) emissions from 
wood biomass in SWDS 
According to guidelines for the Waste sector, methane emissions from wood in SWDS are represented in the Waste 
sector in the country where the SWDS are situated, regardless of the national origin of the waste (See 2006 IPCC 
Guidelines, Volume 5, Chapter 3, Section 3.1).

UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT 
This section provides information on potential sources of uncertainty associated with the estimates of CO2 
emissions and removals arising from HWP. The uncertainties can be divided into uncertainties associated with the 
methods, with the activity data, and with emission factors and parameters. 
METHOD UNCERTAINTIES 
When flux data methods are applied, notably as under Tier 1 and Tier 2, the essential sources of uncertainty are 
related to the assumption that losses from the processing and use of semi-finished wood products can be 
represented by a FOD process (see Equation 12.2). The alternative to modelling fluxes in this way would be to 
refer to actual statistics, not only on the rates of wood inflow into classes of semi-finished products, but also on 
rates of loss (or disposal) of wood material from these classes. As explained in Section 12.4.1.1, statistics (activity 
data) on rates of inflow are generally available and reasonably reliable. However, there are no extensive or reliable 
statistics on actual rates of loss/disposal – rather there is only some understanding of the lifespans (or “service 
lives”) of types of wood product. Although the FOD function is assumed to be a good proxy for the carbon losses 
from the HWP pool consisting of semi-finished products, other decay functions or methodologies could also be 
used to describe these processes. However, the real world is even more complex. The service life and decay pattern 
of wood products are not just technical issues but are also related to socio-economic factors (see Section 12.4.3.2). 
For instance, the demand for wood products is likely to grow during periods of economic prosperity, resulting 
simultaneously in increasing replacement of old HWP with new ones. Hence, the inflow of wood to HWP is likely 
to increase during such periods. However, much of this wood consumption may be related to decisions to replace 
existing HWP in use, thus the rate of loss/disposal from HWP may also increase, implying a shortening of the time 
for which HWP remain in use. The converse may be true in periods of economic recession, i.e. with reduced inflow 
but also reduced losses as a result of HWP being retained longer in use. This sort of dynamic interaction between 
rates of inflow and loss is not represented in the basic FOD modelling methods. Rather, the rates of loss are 
assumed to be fixed. As a result, the annual carbon stock change in HWP may be overestimated or underestimated 
during some periods, depending on specific economic circumstances, where these are not well represented by the 
assumptions implicit in the FOD process and fixed decay rates representing average conditions. 
In the Tier 1 method another uncertainty is associated with the initialization of the FOD model. Due to the lack of 
long historical data series on semi-finished HWP (for some countries data series are only available since the early 
1990s) the initial stocks of the HWP commodity classes (Cl(t0)) are approximated by assuming that the stock 
change was zero at the initial time. This proxy might slightly overestimate the inherited emissions from the long-
lived HWP commodity classes of sawnwood (with half-life of 35 years) and wood based panels (with half-life of 
25 years) in cases where the stock was growing when initialization of the time series began, particularly when the 
calculation in Equation 12.4 only starts from the early 1990s. This could thus potentially increase the uncertainties 
of CO2 emissions and removals arising from HWP, especially from products with high half-life values.  
Another model uncertainty is related to the number of HWP commodity classes in the model. In the simplest Tier 
1 method there are three HWP sub-pools for the main commodity classes of semi-finished wood products: 
sawnwood, wood-based panels and paper and paperboard, each of which follows the FOD pattern but with 
different half-lives. The uncertainty could be lowered by introducing disaggregated sub-pools (e.g. for sawnwood) 
with different half-lives depending upon their end-use (see Table 12.2) or based on sub-classes (e.g. wood-based 
panels disaggregated to particle board, fibreboard etc., see Table 12.2).  
In Tier 3, direct inventories of HWP in service (e.g. in the construction sector) could also be used to reduce the 
uncertainties associated with the flux data based method of Tier 2. The advantage of direct inventories is that they 
remove the need for idealized models with uncertain assumptions on decay pattern, and which may require 
verification and validation. The direct inventory method could in principle provide more robust and less uncertain 
estimates of the carbon stock changes in the HWP pool. Sequential direct inventories could also be applied in the 
calibration of the flux data models and their half-life parameters (see Box 12.2), thus reducing their uncertainties. 
However, the limitation of the method is that the statistics, if available, contain only some major pools, such as the 
housing sector, of a country, and there is no information on other pools, e.g. on the use of wood for furniture or 
packaging. In addition, direct inventory methods are unlikely to be implementable by a producing country for 
HWP in its export markets. Thus, they must always be combined with flux data methods, introducing a risk of 
double-counting of semi-finished and final products. Furthermore, direct inventory methods are applicable only in 
countries where relevant and repeated statistics are available. 
UNCERTAINTIES OF ACTIVITY DATA 
Uncertainties related to activity data on HWP from international databases (e.g. FAOSTAT, see Section 12.5), and 
consequent uncertainties in the estimates of the level of CO2 emissions and removals arising from HWP, could 
occur as a result of: 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
12.38 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
 Lack of time series: some countries were founded relatively recently, and thus older activity data might not be 
available (see above). 
 Definitional uncertainties (i.e. data provided do not conform to what has been requested): For instance, data on 
wood removals tend to originate only from commercial forestry operations or planned cuts, data on sawnwood 
production is being provided in nominal (not solid) m3, and pulp production data is only on commercially 
traded (market) pulp. 
 The scope of data collection: small or occasional producers may not be included. This tends to affect especially 
the sawmilling industries, as limits to collected statistical data might be linked to business volume or number 
of employees. 
 Double counting (e.g. final products counted in semi-finished commodities, such as cut paper being added to 
paper in rolls). 
 Reporting errors in providing correct data: for instance, numbers that are assigned to the wrong commodity 
class or incorrectly processed by the reporter or collecting agency. 
 Uncertainties associated with aggregate HWP commodities (e.g. wood-based panels): in general, the sum for 
the sub-classes is consistent with the value for the aggregate commodities, but some commodities may be 
underreported because of missing sub-classes (e.g. missing data on veneer sheets result in an underestimate for 
wood-based panels). 
Concerning data on the feedstock for production of semi-finished HWP commodity classes (i.e. industrial 
roundwood and wood pulp as proposed in Equations 12.7 and 12.8), uncertainty could be caused by unreported 
sources, related to by-product use or just omissions from trade data.  
The semi-finished HWP commodity classes (i.e. sawnwood, wood-based panels and paper and paperboard) are all 
subject to the factors listed above. An overall assessment of the influence of these factors on the estimated 
uncertainty of reported activity data suggests a range from -25percent to +5percent (based on the authors’ expert 
judgement). The implication is that the combined effect of the factors described above is a tendency to under-
reporting in HWP commodity data in international databases, i.e. actual values are generally higher. This is 
particularly the case in the reported amounts of wood-removals (see Figure 12.2, Section 12.4.1.1). This in turn 
implies a potential underestimation of the rates of inflow to HWP in the case that information on feedstock is used 
for calculating in the applied HWP approach.  
Further uncertainties associated with activity data are caused by conversion factors. In particular, the conversion 
factors provided for sawnwood (see Table 12.2) reflect averages which may not be correct for all species and 
specific items.  
In order to reduce uncertainties around conversion factors for carbon, countries may consider using country-
specific activity data under Tier 2 where they can make use of commodity specific conversion factors linked, for 
example, to various wood species for the specific items (see Section 12.4.2.1). 
It is most useful for reducing the uncertainties relating to activity data to cross-check if the amount of domestic 
production of HWP commodity classes balances with the available supply of wood.  It also allows data to be 
reviewed to check if it fits with a general understanding of the forest products supply in a country. Other validation 
methods could include a review of trade unit values and determination of per capita apparent consumption. 
UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH EMISSION FACTORS (SERVICE 
AND HALF-LIFE ESTIMATES) 
The half-life parameters are in general the most uncertain part of the Tier 1 and Tier 2 calculation method. The 
scientific evidence behind the default values given in Table 12.3 is not robust. For reducing uncertainty, countries 
are strongly encouraged to adjust the Tier 1 half-life parameters by calibrating the FOD model either a) with direct 
inventories of HWP in use (see Section 12.4.4), or b) with market information as shown in Table 12.4 (see Section 
12.4.3.2). The application of stock inventory information, however, is not practical for most countries owing to 
the lack of appropriate statistics. Furthermore, it does not cover export markets of an estimating country (i.e. 
relevant where a ‘production’ approach is applied). A study for Germany including a calibration of the default 
half-lives by means of market information (Rüter 2017) confirmed the three values in relation to the country’s 
total product portfolio. In contrast, two specific calibration studies (Statistics Finland 2011) indicated that it is 
likely that the true half-life of sawnwood and wood-based panels in Finland has been shorter in the past than the 
default half-lives (Table 12.3).   
Even though the uncertainty associated with Tier 1 estimates using default data could be high, working through 
such estimates can be the first step in identifying ways to improve them. Initial improvements can be made using 
country-specific data with country-specific half-lives instead of the default half-lives in Tier 2. 
 
Chapter 12: Harvested Wood Products 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
12.39 
To decrease uncertainties, in Tier 3, countries may consider using direct inventories of HWP in use to develop 
more realistic decay patterns for HWP and use more sub-pools where reliable, transparent information is available. 
However, the model calibration procedure for direct inventories of HWP requires in practice a model with very 
few adjustable parameters. 
12.8 
QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL 
(QA/QC) 
It is good practice to include QA/QC procedures during the development of the inventory for HWP. 
QA procedures include external and internal reviews and audits that assess the quality of the inventory and are 
normally done in addition to the QC procedures. QA reviewers are normally independent national or international 
experts that have not been involved in the inventory. The QA is normally organized jointly for the entire inventory 
(see 2006 IPCC Guidelines, Volume 1, Section 6.8). 
The QC procedures should follow the general procedures described in 2006 IPCC Guidelines, Volume 1, Section 
6.6 related to calculations, data processing, completeness and documentation and Section 6.7 related to emission 
factors and activity data. 
Specific steps to improve the calculations of HWP for Tier 2 are described in Section 12.4.3 for the use of country-
specific activity data (Section 12.4.3.1) and half-lives (Section 12.4.3.2). For Tier 3, steps to improve the applied 
methodology are described in Section 12.4.4. 
The following general steps could help the inventory compiler to improve estimates of CO2 emissions and 
removals arising from HWP further, together with checking and revising data for the Tier 1 method and 
improvements for Tier 2 estimates: 
1. 
Check that country data in the FAO database19 agree with best available country sources of data on production 
and trade or use detailed country-specific data in place of FAO data to calculate the Inflow(l) as described in 
equation 12.3. 
2. 
Check for country sources for densities and carbon fractions, especially for sawnwood and HWP feedstock 
commodity classes to adjust the values in Tables 12.1 and 12.2 to country specific circumstances. 
3. 
If country specific half-life values are developed (see section 12.4.3.2) and used, they can be verified by 
checking the values against any other country with similar market distribution of HWP. 
12.9 
COMPLETENESS 
If a country is a significant exporter and/or importer of finished wood products, such as furniture or wooden interior 
works (e.g. windows, doors) (see Figure 12.3), then methods may need to be adapted to adjust the inflow to the 
HWP pool in use to include or exclude carbon in traded amounts of finished products in the light of the approach 
chosen by the country (see Section 12.3). This may affect the contribution from both imported and exported HWP. 
Some wood may be used directly for finished products, not included first in semi-finished product amounts 
reported in the HWP statistics (see Section 12.4.1.1). In such cases, the Tier 1 and 2 methods could underestimate 
the inflow of carbon to the HWP pool in use.  
The methods provided in these guidelines do not include estimates of HWP carbon storage associated with CO2 
that is captured after biomass combustion and held as part of a solid chemical or as a gas.

Annex 12A. 
Detailed description of Approaches to estimating 
CO2 emissions and removals arising from HWP 
12A.1 Introduction 
This section describes in detail the different approaches for estimating CO2 emissions and removals arising from 
HWP. Before proceeding to the detailed description, several points already discussed in the main chapter should 
be recalled, as summarised below. 
12A.1.1 TYPES OF APPROACH 
The 2006 IPCC Guidelines considered four approaches for the calculation of emissions and removals of CO2 
associated with HWP, known as the ‘stock-change’ approach, ‘production’ approach, ‘atmospheric-flow’ 
approach and ‘simple-decay’ approach. These estimation approaches were defined in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines 
and are maintained in this updated guidance, with a detailed supporting description provided in this annex. 
12A.1.2 CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS AND SYSTEM BOUNDARIES OF 
HWP APPROACHES 
The discussion in Section 12.3 of the main chapter has explained how each defined HWP approach is based on a 
conceptual framework: 
 The ‘stock-change’ and ‘production’ approaches are based on a conceptual framework focussing on carbon 
stock changes within defined HWP pools and deriving estimates for CO2 emissions and removals from these. 
 The ‘atmospheric-flow’ and ‘simple-decay’ approaches are based on a conceptual framework that focusses on 
identifying and tracking CO2 fluxes. 
The conceptual framework of an approach has some implications for the carbon stock changes (or CO2 emissions 
and removals) that are included in estimates. Notably, for approaches that involve focussing on carbon stock 
changes within defined HWP pools (i.e. the ‘stock-change’ and ‘production’ approaches), CO2 emissions from 
harvested wood biomass used directly as a feedstock for energy purposes are not included as part of estimates of 
CO2 emissions and removals arising from HWP. This is because these elements of harvested wood do not enter a 
defined HWP carbon pool. This does not mean that CO2 emissions arising from the use of harvested wood biomass 
for energy purposes are not estimated at all under the ‘stock-change’ and ‘production’ approaches. Instead, these 
CO2 emissions are implicitly included as part of emissions and removals for wood-producing land categories, as 
explained in Section 12.5 in the main chapter. In contrast, for approaches that involve focussing on tracking CO2 
fluxes (i.e. the ‘atmospheric-flow’ approach and the ‘simple-decay’ approach), CO2 emissions from harvested 
wood biomass used directly as a feedstock for energy purposes are included explicitly in estimates CO2 emissions 
and removals arising from HWP. 
In addition to an underlying conceptual framework, each defined HWP approach involves applying a system 
boundary for the calculation of estimates of CO2 emissions and removals arising from HWP. The system boundary 
determines the scope of CO2 emissions and removals covered by estimates for HWP. The conceptual frameworks 
and system boundaries of the four individual approaches are discussed further in Sections 12.A.2 and 12.A.3. The 
implementation of HWP approaches is discussed in Section 12.A.4. This subject is discussed in detail below. 
There are complementary similarities and distinctions between the four HWP approaches: 
 The ‘stock-change’ and ‘production’ approaches work with carbon stock changes in HWP pools, whereas the 
‘atmospheric-flow’ and ‘simple-decay’ approaches work with CO2 fluxes; 
 The ‘stock-change’ and ‘atmospheric-flow’ approaches cover stock changes or CO2 fluxes associated within a 
consuming country, whereas the ‘production’ and ‘simple-decay’ approaches cover those associated with a 
producing country. 
It must be stressed that the choice of approach has implications for the calculation and reporting of emissions and 
removals across the AFOLU sector. Specifically, the system boundaries of the approaches are also defined so that 
no double-counting or omissions occur when estimates of CO2 emissions and removals arising from HWP reported 
by different countries are combined to provide global or regional estimates. However, this is only the case if all 
countries use the same approach. Double counting and/or non-counting of CO2 emissions and removals associated 
with forests, other wood producing land categories and HWP can occur if countries apply different HWP

approaches (Cowie et al., 2006). There are also implications for the reporting of CO2 emissions from wood biomass 
burnt in the Energy sector, as discussed in Section 12.5 of the main chapter. 
12A.2 Estimating CO2 emissions and removals arising from 
HWP on the basis of carbon stock changes 
The existing practice to estimate CO2 emissions and removals is to consider carbon stock changes in defined 
biomass pools, to sum these changes and multiply the total change by –44/12. (see 2006 IPCC Guidelines Vol. 4, 
Ch. 2 Section 2.2.3).  
In order to implement one of the two available pool-based approaches using a flux data method as suggested for 
Tier 1 (see Section 12.4.2 in the main chapter), the annual carbon flux into the HWP pool (i.e. Inflow, see Equation 
12.2 in Section 12.4.2) is calculated from the combination of the following statistical elements: 
1. 
‘Stock-change’ approach  Inflow = calculated domestic consumption = domestic production + imports 
– exports  
2. 
‘Production’ approach  Inflow = domestic production  
Section 12.4.2 of the main chapter includes the detailed methodological guidance on how to implement these 
possible pool-based approaches, whereas their conceptual differences are described in the following. The 
possibilities of applying Tier 2 and Tier 3 methods are discussed, respectively, in Sections 12.4.3 and 12.4.4 in the 
main chapter. 
12A.2.1 THE ‘STOCK-CHANGE’ APPROACH  
The ‘stock-change’ approach estimates the net change in carbon stocks in the HWP pool within national boundaries 
(see e.g. Brown et al. 1998, Lim et al. 1999, UNFCCC 2003) and supplements the estimation of emissions and 
removals with changes in the carbon stocks in the above ground biomass pool of forests within the same system 
boundaries. Where this approach is used to estimate the annual change in carbon stock in “products in use” in a 
country, it corresponds to Variable 1A in 2006 IPCC Guidelines. 
A conceptual illustration of the ‘stock-change’ approach is shown in Figure 12.A.1. A ‘box-and-arrow’ diagram, 
indicating the essential relationships between the system boundary and CO2 emissions and removals, is shown in 
Figure 12.A.2. 
Changes in the pool of products are reported by the country where the products are used, referred to as the 
consuming country. Where a flux data method is applied to determine the amount of carbon stored in the HWP 
pool in use within a country, the carbon flux into the pool (i.e. Inflow) is quantified by means of the calculated 
consumption of HWP. The calculated consumption of HWP reflects the annual additions to the carbon pool in 
HWP in use within a country and it is calculated from the data on domestic production, plus imports and minus 
exports of HWP. Exported HWP are outside the system boundary, whilst imported HWP are included in the 
estimate of the HWP carbon pool in a specific year (see Figures 12.A.1 and 12.A.2). Further details on the 
implementation of this approach through a flux data method using statistical data of semi-finished wood product 
commodities is described in Section 12.4.2.1 in the main chapter.

decay of “slash”. Some arrows represent additions or deductions as a result of the transfer of carbon between 
land-based and HWP pools, not involving transfers to the atmosphere, for example deductions to forest carbon 
stocks resulting from “harvest” and additions to HWP carbon as a result of “HWP consumption”. The arrows 
thus show where additions, deductions or transfers of carbon are involved in the approach.

Other data reflecting the utilization of HWP in use within a country could be derived from information on e.g. the 
use of wood within a specific commodity class, for instance the national building stock (see Section 12.4.3.1). In

the case of the use of such inventory information, the amount of carbon stored in HWP within a country would 
need to be quantified at least at two points in time, in a similar way to repeated forest inventories referring to the 
stock-difference method (see IPCC 2006, p. 2.10).  
12A.2.2 THE ‘PRODUCTION’ APPROACH20 
Similar to the ‘stock-change’ approach, the ‘production’ approach determines emissions and removals from wood 
coming from domestic harvest in a country. Where the annual change in carbon stock in ‘products in use’ is 
estimated, this corresponds to Variable 2A in 2006 IPCC Guidelines. 
A conceptual illustration of the ‘production’ approach is shown in Figure 12.A.3a ‘box-and-arrow’ diagram, 
indicating the essential relationships between the system boundary and CO2 emissions and removals, is shown in 
Figure 12.A.4. 
In contrast to the ‘stock-change’ approach described above, which estimates the carbon flux into the carbon pool 
of HWP in use based on the calculated domestic consumption of HWP, the ‘production’ approach considers the 
domestic production of wood commodities manufactured from domestic harvest. Thus, the carbon in exported 
wood products is implicitly included in the HWP estimates of a country and their associated stock changes occur 
in other countries (where exports are held). The system boundary therefore does not correspond to the national 
boundaries in which the CO2 emissions and removals arising from HWP take place (Figures 12.A.3 and 12.A.4).

NOTE: The vertical -/+ arrows above the diagram indicate where additions or deductions are made to carbon

land-based and HWP pools, not involving transfers to the atmosphere, for example deductions to forest carbon 
stocks resulting from “harvest” and additions to HWP carbon as a result of “HWP production”. The arrows thus 
show where additions, deductions or transfers of carbon are involved in the approach. 
                                                           
20 It should be noted that the original proposal for the ‘simple-decay’ concept included a combination of an HWP “approach” 
as defined in this guidance and essentially a partially-defined Tier 3 estimation method. In this guidance, the discussion is 
concerned strictly with the ‘simple-decay’ concept in terms of a possible HWP approach

and HWP in use, as shown. For the estimation of CO2 emissions and removals arising from HWP, only those 
fluxes crossing the HWP system boundary are covered under the ‘production’ approach. 
Methodological guidance on how the ‘production’ approach is implemented through a flux data method using 
statistical data of semi-finished wood product commodities is described in Section 12.4.2.1 in the main chapter. 
12A.3 Estimating CO2 fluxes from wood biomass 
The ‘atmospheric-flow’ and ‘simple-decay’ approaches deal with actual fluxes of carbon associated with HWP to 
the atmosphere. In the case of the ‘atmospheric-flow’ approach, fluxes occurring from within national boundaries 
are considered. In the case of the ‘simple-decay’ approach, in theory, fluxes arising from wood harvested by a 
producing country are considered. 
In addition to relevant estimates of the carbon stock changes within the HWP pool in use (i.e. those treated as 
residing in lasting HWP pools), all relevant additional cross-border carbon fluxes in woody biomass used for 
energy purposes need to be allowed for (see Section 12.A.1.2 above, also Cowie et al. 2006). 
12A.3.1 THE ‘ATMOSPHERIC-FLOW’ APPROACH  
The ‘atmospheric-flow’ approach deals with actual fluxes of carbon associated with HWP to the atmosphere, from 
within national boundaries, so that CO2 emissions from HWP and woody biomass used for energy purposes are 
reported by a consuming country. 
A conceptual illustration of the ‘atmospheric-flow’ approach is shown in Figure 12.A.5.a ‘box-and-arrow’ diagram, 
indicating the essential relationships between the system boundary and CO2 emissions and removals, is shown in 
Figure 12.A.6. The HWP pools are the same as in the ‘stock-change’ approach. Further information on the 
implementation of the ‘atmospheric-flow’ approach on the basis of available statistical data is included in Section 
12.4.2.1.

Some arrows represent additions or deductions as a result of the transfer of carbon between land-based and HWP 
pools, not involving transfers to the atmosphere, for example deductions to forest carbon stocks resulting from 
“harvest” and additions to HWP carbon as a result of “HWP consumption”. The arrows thus show where additions, 
deductions or transfers of carbon are involved in the approach.

12A.3.2 THE ‘SIMPLE-DECAY’ APPROACH 
Similarly to the ‘atmospheric-flow’ approach, the ‘simple-decay approach deals with actual fluxes of carbon 
associated with HWP to the atmosphere. However, the ‘simple-decay’ approach covers CO2 emissions arising 
from wood harvested by a producing country, so that emissions from HWP and woody biomass used for energy 
purposes are reported by a producing country.

12A.4 Implementation of HWP approaches 
Section 12.4.2 in the main chapter describes the Tier 1 default methods relevant for implementing the four HWP 
approaches defined in this annex. Table 12.A.1 provides a summary of the equations described in Section 12.4.2 
that may be applied when using Tier 1 methods for estimating CO2 emissions and removals arising from HWP. 
The Tier 1 methods and equations defined in Section 12.4.2 are designed to ensure compatibility with the generic 
methodologies for land use given in 2006 IPCC Guidelines Vol. 4 Ch. 2 and methodologies for specific land 
categories (where relevant for wood production) presented in other 2006 IPCC Guidelines Vol. 4 chapters. Note 
that the Tier 1 default methods relevant for the ‘simple-decay’ approach in Table 12.A.1 are the same as for the 
‘production’ approach, hence the Tier 1 methods for the ‘production’ approach given in Section 12.4.2 may also 
be referred to when applying Tier 1 methods for the ‘simple-decay’ approach. 
General guidance on Tier 2 method is given in Section 12.4.3 of the main chapter, whilst guidance on Tier 3 
methods is given in Section 12.4.4.
