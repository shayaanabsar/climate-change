1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 
INTRODUCTION 
This volume, Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU), covers greenhouse gas emissions occurring from 
industrial processes, from the use of greenhouse gases in products, and from non-energy uses of fossil fuel 
carbon. The former section 'Solvent and Other Product Use' in the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National 
Greenhouse Gas Inventories has been incorporated in this volume. 
Greenhouse gas emissions are produced from a wide variety of industrial activities. The main emission sources 
are releases from industrial processes that chemically or physically transform materials (for example, the blast 
furnace in the iron and steel industry, ammonia and other chemical products manufactured from fossil fuels used 
as chemical feedstock and the cement industry are notable examples of industrial processes that release a 
significant amount of CO2). During these processes, many different greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide 
(CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs), can be 
produced. 
In addition, greenhouse gases often are used in products such as refrigerators, foams or aerosol cans. For 
example, HFCs are used as alternatives to ozone depleting substances (ODS) in various types of product 
applications. Similarly, sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and N2O are used in a number of products used in industry 
(e.g., SF6 used in electrical equipment, N2O used as a propellant in aerosol products primarily in food industry) 
or by end-consumers (e.g., SF6 used in running-shoes, N2O used during anaesthesia). A notable feature of these 
product uses is that, in almost all cases, significant time can elapse between the manufacture of the product and 
the release of the greenhouse gas. The delay can vary from a few weeks (e.g., for aerosol cans) to several 
decades as in the case of rigid foams. In some applications (e.g., refrigeration) a fraction of the greenhouse gases 
used in the products can be recovered at the end of product’s life and either recycled or destroyed. In addition, 
several other fluorinated greenhouse gases may be used in special processes, for example in semiconductor 
manufacture: 
• 
nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) 
• 
trifluoromethyl sulphur pentafluoride (SF5CF3) 
• 
halogenated ethers (e.g., C4F9OC2H5, CHF2OCF2OC2F4OCHF2, CHF2OCF2OCHF2) 
and other halocarbons not covered by the Montreal Protocol including CF3I, CH2Br2, CHCl3, CH3Cl, CH2Cl2.  
This volume of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (2006 IPCC Guidelines) 
also provides estimation methods for halogenated greenhouse gases which are not covered by the Montreal 
Protocol and for which GWP values are not available from the IPCC Third Assessment Report (TAR), inter alia: 
• 
C3F7C(O)C2F51 
• 
C7F16 
• 
C4F6  
• 
C5F8  
• 
c-C4F8O. 
Some of the methods can be used for other halocarbons not controlled by the Montreal Protocol (inlcuding 
several fluids and blends e.g., traded under the commercial lables of the Fluorinert™ and Galden® product 
families)2  
Product use is combined with the industrial process guidance because in many cases production and 
import/export data are needed to estimate emissions in products and because product use may also occur as part 
of industrial activities, apart from the non-industrial sectors (retail, services, households.) It is therefore desirable 
to link estimation of emissions associated with production and product use. The non-energy uses of fossil fuels 
                                                           
1   This gas is traded as Novec™612 which is a fluorinated ketone produced by 3M (Milbrath, 2002). 
2   The Fluorinert™ materials are selected from fully fluorinated alkanes, ethers, tertiary amines and aminoethers and mixtures 
thereof to obtain the desired properties. The Galden® fluids span a range of fully fluorinated polyethers, called 
perfluoropolyethers (PFPEs).

encompass their uses as feedstock, reductants and as non-energy products in which their physical properties are 
used directly rather than combusted for energy purposes.

Chapter 1: Introduction 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
1.7 
This chapter presents: 
• 
the definition and structure of the treatment of industrial processes and product use (1.1); 
• 
a number of general or cross-cutting issues (1.2), among which are the definition of industrial process and 
fuel combustion emissions (1.2.1) and sources of international data (1.2.5); 
• 
the nature of non-energy uses of fossil fuels (1.3); 
• 
the completeness and allocation of CO2 from non-energy use of fuels (1.4); and 
• 
the choice between the mass-balance and emission-factor approaches (1.5) with specific relevance to the 
fluorinated gases covered in Chapters 7 and 8 of this volume. 
SECTOR CLASSIFICATION AND STRUCTURE 
Figure 1.1 sets out the structure and classification codes for each category and subcategory for the IPPU Sector.  
 
1.2 
GENERAL AND CROSS-CUTTING ISSUES 
1.2.1 
Definition of industrial process and fuel combustion 
emissions 
Allocating emissions from the use of fossil fuel between the Energy and IPPU Sectors can be complex. The 
feedstock and reductant uses of fuels frequently produce gases that may be combusted to provide energy for the 
process. Equally part of the feedstock may be combusted directly for heat. This can lead to uncertainty and 
ambiguity in reporting. To help to overcome this problem, these Guidelines introduce practical guidance on 
when to allocate CO2 emissions released from combustion of fuel to the subcategory fuel combustion within the 
energy source category or to the industrial process source category. The rule is given in Box 1.1. 
The problems encountered when allocating CO2 emissions to fuel combustion or industrial processes are 
particularly prominent when by-product fuels or waste gases are transferred from the manufacturing site and 
combusted elsewhere in quite different activities. This fact has formed the principle for the guidance given in 
Box 1.1, which provides a definition for fuel combustion and a criterion for deciding whether emissions from by-
product fuels should be reported in the IPPU Sector or in an Energy Sector source category. Section 1.3 provides 
background information on the nature of non-energy uses of fossil fuels, accounting for feedstock and reductant 
uses of fossil fuels and on the links with the fossil fuel use in the Energy Sector. 
1.2.2 
Capture and abatement 
In certain IPPU categories, particularly large point sources of emissions, there could be capture of emissions for 
recovery and use, or destruction. It is good practice to account for capture of emissions using detailed country-
specific or more suitably plant-level data. Consequently, Tier 1 methods provided in this volume are not 
appropriate for tracking this type of abatement. Capture should be incorporated into equations by means of an 
additional term that represents either a measured quantity of capture, or the efficiency of an abatement system in 
combination with that system’s utilisation throughout the year. It is recommended not to account for capture by 
using a modified emission factor, as this reduces transparency and risks inconsistency in time series.3 
Should CO2 capture technology be installed and used at a plant, it is good practice to deduct the CO2 captured in 
a higher tier emissions calculation. Quantities of CO2 for later use and short-term storage should not be deducted 
from CO2 emissions except when the CO2 emissions are accounted for elsewhere in the inventory4. The default 
                                                           
3  In industries such as nitric acid and adipic acid production, it is standard engineering practice to design modern plants with 
built-in destruction technology, often in response to the need to address NOx emissions. In these special cases, it is possible 
to use emission factors that reflect this destruction technology, provided that the inventory compiler can document that the 
technology is in place and has been utilised.  
4   Examples include urea production (Section 3.2) and the use of CO2 in methanol production (Section 3.9) where CO2 due to 
the final products is accounted for. 
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
1.8 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
assumption is that there is no carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) taking place.5 Any methodology taking 
into account CO2 capture should consider that CO2 emissions captured in the process may be both combustion 
and process-related. In cases where combustion and process emissions are to be reported separately inventory 
compilers should ensure that the same quantities of CO2 are not double counted. In these cases the total amount 
of CO2 captured should preferably be reported in the corresponding fuel combustion and IPPU source categories 
in proportion to the amounts of CO2 generated in these source categories. For additional information on CO2 
capture and storage refer to Volume 2, Section 2.3.4. 
For gases other than CO2, it is good practice to ensure that later emissions of the captured gases are accounted 
for where they occur. An example of this is for HFC-23 produced as by-product from HCFC-22 production. 
Here the substance is extracted from the off gas and used in products or processes. Methods to appropriately 
address these capture efficiencies can be found within this volume where sufficient information currently exist.  
Often a partly or full abatement of greenhouse gas emissions from a process will occur by means of off-gas 
treatment e.g., the destruction of greenhouse gases by post-combustion. This approach is often applied for 
substances with high global warming potentials such as PFCs in the semiconductor industry or HFC-23 in the 
chemical industry. Destruction efficiencies depend equally on operating practices and technologies applied. 
 
BOX 1.1 
ALLOCATION OF CO2 EMISSIONS TO FUEL COMBUSTION OR INDUSTRIAL PROCESS EMISSIONS 
Fuel combustion is defined in a functional way as: 
the intentional oxidation of materials within an apparatus that is designed to provide heat or 
mechanical work to a process, or for use away from the apparatus. 
The aim of this definition is to separate the combustion of fuels for distinct and productive energy 
use from the heat released from the use of hydrocarbons in chemical reactions defining an 
industrial process. 
Process fuels may be obtained directly from the feedstock as in the case of ammonia manufacture 
where natural gas provides both feedstock and fuel. Alternatively, process fuels may be obtained 
indirectly through the use of by-products of feedstock processing or reductant use. Examples are 
the off gases obtained from the steam cracking of naphtha feedstock for ethylene manufacture and 
blast furnace gas from blast furnaces. 
During these activities emissions may occur from both the fuel combustion and industrial process 
stages. However, it is often impractical or impossible to report separately the two types of 
emissions. (See Section 1.3.2 below.) Accordingly the following rule has been formulated to 
simplify reporting: 
Combustion emissions from fuels obtained directly or indirectly from the feedstock for an IPPU 
process will normally be allocated to the part of the source category in which the process occurs. 
These source categories are normally 2B and 2C. However, if the derived fuels are transferred for 
combustion in another source category, the emissions should be reported in the appropriate part 
of Energy Sector source categories (normally 1A1 or 1A2). 
Two examples may help illustrate the definition. 
1. If blast furnace gas is combusted entirely within the Iron and Steel industry (whether for 
heating blast air, site power needs or for metal finishing operations) the associated emissions are 
reported in the IPPU source subcategory 2C1. If part of the gas is delivered to a nearby brick 
works for heat production or a main electricity producer then the emissions are reported in source 
subcategories (1A2f or 1A1a). 
2. If surplus methane or hydrogen from the steam cracking of naphtha is combusted within the 
petrochemical site for another process then the emissions are reported as emissions in IPPU, 2B8. 
On the other hand, if the gases are passed to a nearby refinery for fuel use then the associated 
emissions would be reported under 1A1b, Petroleum Refining. 
                                                           
5   If a country reports capture of CO2, it is good practice to ensure that CO2 is stored in long-term geological storage sites that 
are monitored according to the guidance in Chapter 5, CO2 Transport, Injection and Geological Storage, of Volume 2: 
Energy. 
Chapter 1: Introduction 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
1.9 
1.2.3 
Precursors  
Methodologies for the estimation of emissions of precursors (NOx, NMVOC, CO, SO2 and NH3) are not given in 
these Guidelines. Emissions of these gases can be estimated using the other well-established guidance. One 
example is the EMEP/CORINAIR Emission Inventory Guidebook (EEA, 2005)6. This guidebook has been 
developed for emission inventories of substances regulated under the UNECE Convention on Long-Range 
Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP) (see Box 7.1, Chapter 7, Precursors and Indirect Emissions, of Volume 
1: General Guidance and Reporting) and covers all source sectors and should therefore be considered as the 
primary source of information for estimation of these emissions. 
Volume 1, Table 7.1 provides a link between the IPCC source categories and the corresponding methodology 
chapters in the EMEP/CORINAIR Emission Inventory Guidebook. This table provides information on the 
specific EMEP/CORINAIR chapter in which methodological guidance can be found on NOx, CO, NMVOC, SO2 
and NH3. It also includes information on the availability of methods and the significance of precursor emissions 
from particular source categories. 
Some of the methodologies and emission factors in the EMEP/CORINAIR Emission Inventory Guidebook are 
relevant to conditions and source categories in both developed and developing countries. However, for some 
sectors, such as solvents, differences between the developed and developing countries may be larger and the 
EMEP/CORINAIR Emission Inventory Guidebook should be used with great care. 
1.2.4 
Indirect N2O  
Deposition of nitrogen containing compounds onto soils gives rise to emissions of N2O. This occurs through 
both nitrification and denitrification processes (see Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use). These 
are called ‘indirect N2O’ emissions. To ensure consistency across the inventory it is important to estimate 
indirect N2O emissions from deposition of nitrogen containing compounds emitted in the IPPU Sector. The 
methodology is simple and attributes all indirect emissions of N2O to the original source of the nitrogen.  
The nitrogen sources are NOx (NO and NO2) and NH3. NOx is primarily emitted form fuel combustion while 
NH3 is mainly emitted from agriculture, though there can be significant industrial process emissions of both 
these gases. Information for estimating emissions of NOx and NH3 can be found elsewhere. One example is the 
EMEP/CORINAIR Emission Inventory Guidebook. (EEA, 2005) 
Comprehensive guidance is provided in Chapter 7, Precursors and Indirect Emissions, of Volume 1: General 
Guidance and Reporting, on estimating indirect N2O emissions resulting from NOx and/or NH3 emissions. 
Where countries have an existing NOx and/or NH3 inventory it is good practice to estimate indirect N2O. 
1.2.5 
International data sources 
Good national data are to be preferred and used wherever available. In cases where data availability is a problem 
inventory compilers may consult international data sources for proxy data for IPPU estimates. Sources include: 
• 
United Nations (UN) industrial production statistics which are available in hard copy in the ‘Industrial 
Commodity Statistics Yearbook’ (UN, 2004) from 1991 onwards and as CD-ROM with statistics from 1950 
onwards; data (in physical units) are given by commodity and country for all years and almost all 
commodities relevant for emission inventories.  
• 
OECD publishes production data in monetary units (value of production) for the OECD countries 
(http://www.oecd.org/statsportal/0,2639,en_2825_293564_1_1_1_1_1,00.html) but data for the most recent 
years are not available. OECD also sells a publication with additional data (http://www.oecd.org/ 
document/63/0,2340,en_2825_499554_1935935_1_1_1_1,00.html), but according to the web site the most 
recent data are for 2001. National account data can be also accessed, for a charge, for the years up to 2002. 
Most useful is perhaps the STAN (Industry Structural Analysis) database of the OECD (again only available 
via 
subscription 
at 
http://hermia.sourceoecd.org/vl=4126925/cl=58/nw=1/rpsv/cw/vhosts/oecdstats/ 
16081307/v265n1/contp1-1.htm), this contains monetary production data, for years up to 2002, for major 
industries. Note, however, that the monetary value reflects not only the production quantity but also the 
price of the product - which may fluctuate from one year to another - so the data should be used with care.  
                                                           
6  The EMEP/CORINAIR Nomenclature for Reporting (NFR) source categories have been developed to be compatible to the 
IPCC reporting categories (EEA, 2005).

NATURE OF NON-ENERGY USES OF FOSSIL 
FUELS 
As explained in Section 1.1 some CO2 emissions from fossil fuels arise from uses that are not primarily for 
energy purposes and, in this section, the principles are described which have guided their estimation and 
reporting. The methods used to estimate emissions are described in the specific IPPU source category chapters 
(Chapters 3, 4 and 5). This section provides important and additional background information for the use of data 
relating to non-energy use and the links between these data and the fossil fuel use. 
Non-energy use is widespread, diverse and the correct reporting of its emissions is conceptually difficult. It is 
good practice to ensure that all fossil fuels supplied for non-energy purposes can be linked to uses covered by 
the inventory and the reported emissions are consistent with the carbon supplied. Accordingly, Section 1.4 
provides guidance for assessing consistency and completeness of carbon emissions from feedstock use of fuels 
by (a) checking that feedstock requirements of processes included in the inventory are in balance with the 
feedstock supply as recorded in national energy statistics, (b) checking that total reported bottom-up calculated 
CO2 emissions from feedstock sources at different subcategory levels are complete and consistent, (c) 
documenting and reporting how these emissions are allocated in the inventory. 
1.3.1 
Types of uses 
Some primary fuels (coal, natural gas) and secondary fuels derived from coal and crude oil may be used for non-
fuel purposes. These are commonly referred to as non-energy use of fuels although their use may involve 
combustion of part of the hydrocarbon content for heat-raising. 
Three categories of non-energy use can be distinguished depending on its use: 
1. Feedstock: Feedstocks are fossil fuels that are used as raw materials in chemical conversion processes in 
order to produce primarily organic chemicals and, to a lesser extent, inorganic chemicals (especially 
ammonia) and their derivatives (OECD/IEA/Eurostat, 2004). In most cases, part of the carbon remains 
embodied in the product manufactured. The use of hydrocarbon feedstocks in chemical conversion 
processes is almost entirely confined to the chemical and petrochemical industries. 
2. Reductant: Carbon is used as reducing agent for the production of various metals (Chapter 4) and inorganic 
products (Sections 3.6 – 3.8). It is either used directly as reducing agent or indirectly via the intermediate 
production of electrodes used for electrolysis. In most cases, only very small amounts of carbon are 
embodied in the product manufactured, while the major part is oxidised during the reduction process.  
3. Non-energy product: Apart from fuels, refineries and also coke ovens produce some non-energy products 
which are used directly (i.e., without chemical conversion) for their physical or diluent properties or which 
are sold to the chemical industry as chemical intermediate. Lubricants and greases are used in engines for 
their lubricating properties; paraffin waxes are used as candles, for paper coating etc.; bitumen on roofs and 
roads for its waterproofing and wear qualities. Refineries also produce white spirits, which are used for their 
solvent properties. 
This chapter discusses emissions that result from the first use of the hydrocarbons belonging to these three 
categories. Table 1.2 shows the types of hydrocarbons used in the three categories and the main applications. 
The list of fuel types and processes is illustrative and not exhaustive as some lesser uses of refinery or coke oven 
products are omitted. For example, refinery olefins are not shown because only a minor portion of the olefins 
used for the manufacture of intermediate products is produced in refineries.  
This section focuses on the issues surrounding the reporting of industrial process and fuel combustion emissions 
from the use of fossil fuels as feedstocks and reductants (the first and second categories in Table 1.2). The 
relatively simpler issues affecting estimation of emissions from the first uses of non-energy products (the third 
category in Table 1.2) are presented with the methods in Chapter 5. 
In addition to the emissions from the first use of hydrocarbons, products made from feedstocks (methanol, 
ethylene, carbon black) and their derivatives may lead to additional emissions after manufacture and sale. For 
example, the conversion of ethylene to ethylene oxide leads to substantial industrial process CO2 emissions 
(Section 3.9).  
Emissions from subsequent uses of ‘used’ non-energy products (post-consumer waste) are not included in this 
volume on IPPU Sector but are covered under the Energy and Waste Sectors depending on whether the treatment 
occurs with or without energy recovery or in the form of wastewater treatment.

1.3.2 
Accounting for feedstock and reductant uses of fossil 
fuels and their CO2 emissions 
Ideally the estimation of emissions from the uses of fuels as feedstocks and reductants would proceed from 
knowledge of the specific plant data relevant for the processes considered. However, it is rare that all necessary 
data are available and for some, at least, of the estimations national data on the non-energy use of fuels may be 
needed. To identify the appropriate data for the estimation of CO2 emissions from processes using fuel 
hydrocarbons as feedstock or as reductant, it is necessary to understand the relationships between the 
hydrocarbon flows and national energy data. 
The use of the term non-energy use differs between countries and sources of energy statistics (Patel, 1999). For 
example, the three categories given above are often not grouped together as non-energy use in energy statistics. 
In most energy statistics, fuel inputs of reductants to blast furnaces are not included but accounted for as inputs 
to a fuel conversion activity transforming coke and other inputs to blast furnace gas (see below). The 
International Energy Agency (IEA) follows this approach. It also reports the feedstock category as a memo item 
under energy use within the chemicals branch of industry whereas supplies of non-energy products as defined 
above are reported under ‘non-energy use’. In contrast, in many national energy statistics, the total of the three 
categories (usually without blast furnaces) is reported as one single category called non-energy use. 
The accounting practice for the feedstock and reductant use of fuels differs significantly between countries and 
between processes. A general hydrocarbon balance for processes where hydrocarbon inputs are used for 
feedstock /reductant purposes is illustrated in Figure 1.2 and can help to understand the differences in system 
boundaries for non-energy use in energy statistics across countries.  
In some processes using hydrocarbons as raw materials, fuel by-products are produced next to the main products. 
The by-products are combusted to supply energy to either the same process (Flow 5), to other processes in the 
same industrial sector (Flow 6) or elsewhere in other industrial sectors (Flow 7). 
In primary iron production in blast furnaces, coke is used together with coal and other supplemental inputs to 
reduce iron ore. Coke is made from coal in coke ovens, which also yields coal tar and coke oven gas. In the blast 
furnace, blast furnace gas is produced. The pig iron formed in the blast furnace is mostly transformed into steel 
in the basic oxygen furnace, thereby producing oxygen furnace gas containing most of the carbon embodied in 
the pig iron. Some pig iron may also be supplied to iron foundries and other applications. In national and 
international energy statistics, in order to maintain an energy balance, inputs to coke ovens and blast furnaces are 
normally not reported as non-energy use (reductant) but identified as energy flows in the energy conversion

sector. All products of these processes (coke, coke oven gas, coal tars, blast furnace gas and oxygen furnace gas) 
are reported as output from the conversion sector unless parts are consumed in the process itself or in other 
processes of the conversion sector. The output of the conversion sector is reported as final energy use (in the 
sector where the fuel is used) or as final non-energy use (coal tars).

In the steam cracking process to produce ethylene and other basic chemicals, besides the main products (Flow 8), 
fuel by-products are produced. The fuel by-products are partly used to sustain the endothermic steam cracking 
reaction (Flow 5) partly used as fuel for other chemical purposes (Flow 6) and partly they are used in other 
sectors (Flow 7, e.g., backflows to the refineries for incorporation in refinery production). In contrast to the 
primary iron and steel industry, the conversion of the input hydrocarbons to the fuel by-products is often not 
covered as an energy conversion process in national energy statistics, usually because the data on production of 
fuel by-products are not available. Instead, the total hydrocarbon input (including the hydrocarbons that will 
appear in the fuel by-products) is allocated to feedstock use. In countries, where the production of by-products is 
known, the combustion of fuel by-products may be included as final energy consumption in the national energy 
statistics and may be excluded from non-energy use. 
In the production of synthesis gas to produce ammonia, methanol and other chemicals, the hydrocarbon input is 
used to produce synthesis gas via the steam reforming or partial oxidation processes. Since steam reforming is an 
endothermic process, part of hydrocarbon input is burned in a furnace to sustain the reaction. Therefore, part of 
the hydrocarbon input results in CO2 emissions from fuel combustion, whereas another part results in industrial 
process emissions. In conventional steam reforming, combustion and reforming take place in separate reactors 
and separate data for the hydrocarbon requirements of each may exist. In more advanced process concepts and in 
partial oxidation, it is much more difficult to distinguish clearly between combustion and process emissions. 
According to the allocation principle given in Box 1.1, all emissions from the production of synthesis gas should 
be reported in the IPPU Sector. 
Uses of other hydrocarbon inputs in processes other than those discussed here may also be reported as non-
energy use in national energy statistics. The model figure above and the processes already described should 
therefore be seen as examples. 
In national energy statistics a gross definition of non-energy use for these processes may be applied in which the 
total hydrocarbon input is allocated to non-energy use. Statisticians may also apply a net definition by 
subtracting from the total input the part allocated to final energy use in the process. In the case of a ‘gross’ 
definition, Flow 1 equals Flow 3 in Figure 1.2 and Flow 2 and 4 are absent. In the case of a ‘net’ definition, the 
Chapter 1: Introduction 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
1.15 
input (Flow 1) is divided between non-energy use (Flow 3) and final energy use (Flow 2). Apart from pure gross 
and pure net definitions mixed approaches are sometimes applied, depending on the data availability for certain 
processes and certain fuels. It is necessary to understand well the definition of non-energy use when preparing 
the inventory in the given country in order to prevent double counting and ensure that CO2 emissions are not 
overlooked (see Section 1.4). Ideally, available data would cover all flows identified in Figure 1.2. Alternatively 
the consumption of fuels in the process (Flow 5) will permit an estimate of IPPU Sector emissions. However, it 
is unusual that either data set is available so the above description of processes and data should provide sufficient 
understanding to guide the search for the key data elements required for reporting IPPU Sector emissions. These 
are the fuel carbon supplied to the process (Flow 1), the carbon contained in products (Flow 8) and by-product 
fuels used in another source category (Flow 7; also see Box 1.1). An estimate of emissions may be made by 
subtracting the last two items from the first. 
1.3.3 
Emissions from refinery processes 
Refineries manufacture petroleum products for fuel and for non-energy uses, and in doing so produce hydrogen 
and other gases, intermediate products and basic chemicals. The CO2 emissions from fuel consumed by the 
refinery for this activity are reported as Energy Sector emissions. This principle is maintained in the Guidelines 
even when some fuel use in the refinery is to support manufacture of chemicals for sale (for example, propylene 
or aromatics). The manufacture of basic chemicals in refineries is a normal occurrence usually through the 
treatment of by-products of mainstream manufacture and they may be used in other refinery processes or 
transferred to adjoining petrochemical works. However, in some circumstances the demand for basic chemicals 
may cause the refinery to adjust production processes to increase supply of the chemical and sell directly into the 
market. Despite this activity the fuel use to support all processes is still considered as refinery fuel and the 
emissions as Energy Sector emissions. It is important to recognise that the production for sale of basic chemicals 
in refineries is considered a secondary activity distinct from the manufacture of chemicals in adjoining or co-
located petrochemical works. This is consistent with the separate statistical classification of the two economic 
activities. 
1.4 
QC OF COMPLETENESS AND ALLOCATION 
OF CO2 FROM NON-ENERGY USES 
1.4.1 
Introduction 
The inventory compiler has the task of minimizing omissions and avoiding double counting of emissions from 
fossil carbon bearing products. It is also important to ensure that all sources have been identified and correctly 
allocated to a source category. 
Two Quality Control (QC) approaches are described below to facilitate the organisation and completion of this 
task. Inventory compilers are not expected to obtain data for non-energy use which are not normally available 
except where the balance checks below reveal a significant shortfall requiring explanation. 
Before using the QC checks it is necessary to understand the definition of non-energy use (including use as 
feedstock and as reductant) and the principles of its categorisation as described in Section 1.3. Emissions from 
the uses of the carbon in the materials in each of the categories may occur at first or subsequent uses as 
derivative products as well as in their final destruction. In order to avoid double counting it is essential to be 
aware that some of the carbon emissions from the products derived from fossil fuels will be reported in the 
Waste or Energy Sectors. 
In summary, it is good practice to check the completeness of all fuels and sources discussed here and to 
document where and how they are reported in the inventory. The inventory compiler should ensure that all fossil 
fuels used for non-energy purposes can be linked to uses covered by the inventory and check that reported 
emissions are consistent with the carbon used. The two QC methods proposed for checking completeness are: 
(a) Check that total reported bottom-up calculated CO2 emissions from the non-energy uses of fossil fuels 
at different subcategory levels are complete and consistent. (Section 1.4.3.1) 
(b) Check that feedstock requirements of processes included in the inventory are in balance with the 
feedstock supply as recorded in national energy statistics. (Section 1.4.3.2) 
In practice, QC activities are only part of the inventory development process and inventory compilers need to 
balance quality control requirements, improved accuracy and reduced uncertainty against requirements for 
timeliness and cost effectiveness. A good practice system seeks to achieve that balance and to enable continuous 
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
1.16 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
improvement of inventory estimates. Section 6.2 of Volume 1 provides more information on practical 
considerations on the prioritization of QA/QC and verification efforts. Taking this into account, it is considered 
good practice to perform at least the first completeness check on CO2 emissions, in particular if the total reported 
CO2 emissions from non-energy use of fuels are larger than the smallest level key category. In addition, the 
inventory compiler is encouraged to check on the balance of feedstock supply and requirements if he/she has 
sufficient capacity to do so. 
In addition to these QC methods, this section also provides guidance on documenting and reporting how these 
emissions are allocated in the inventory and how the completeness was checked (Section 1.4.4). CO2 emissions 
from non-energy use are included together with emissions from the Energy Sector (1A) where waste gases from 
IPPU processes have been used and reported in the Energy Sector. Irrespective of any QC on completeness, for 
reasons of transparency and comparability between countries it is good practice to report where these sources are 
allocated in the inventory. (See example format in Section 1.4.4.) 
1.4.2 
Scope of methods 
QC of completeness (covered in Section 1.4.3) can be distinguished from the QC of documenting allocation, 
which is covered in Section 1.4.4. Checking the completeness of accounting uses two top-down methods, each of 
which is limited in its scope to emissions from first uses of fuels for non-energy purposes. QC of allocation 
checks where all emissions arising from non-energy uses of fuels, the destruction of non-energy products and 
fugitive emissions from fuels manufacture are reported.  
In addition to the CO2 completeness check the inventory compiler is encouraged to check on the balance of 
feedstock supply and requirements if he/she has sufficient capacity to do so. It uses the same data for feedstock 
and other non-energy uses from energy statistics and carbon contents as in the calculation of excluded carbon in 
the Reference Approach for CO2 from fuel combustion in the Energy Sector (see Chapter 6, Volume 2). 
1.4.3 
Quality control of completeness 
The CO2 completeness check (Section 1.4.3.1) starts from energy balance data and is designed to check that all 
significant emissions of CO2 from the first non-energy uses of fossil fuels are reported somewhere in the 
inventory, without double counting. The emissions are the sum of CO2 emissions from (a) fuels used as 
feedstock in the chemical industry, (b) fuels used as reductant in the metal industry, (c) fuel products oxidised 
during use (partly or fully; direct emissions or emissions of carbon containing non-CO2 gases (NMVOC, CO and 
CH4) oxidised in the atmosphere). 
Subsequent CO2 emissions may occur in the waste phase if the waste oils or waste products are incinerated. 
However, the amount of fossil-carbon containing products disposed of annually as waste is not equal to the 
amount used annually for first uses because fossil-carbon containing products may be imported or exported or 
they may be used for several years before they are discarded. The complications which arise from external trade 
hold equally for emissions resulting from the use of products made from feedstocks and their derivatives. Since 
derivative products may also be imported or exported the emissions from their use (e.g., from ethylene oxide or 
acrylonitrile production) cannot be linked directly to the first non-energy use of fossil fuels. For these reasons the 
CO2 completeness check is limited to the first non-energy uses of fossil carbon which lead to emissions and does 
not include CO2 emissions from waste incineration. Other non-energy sources of fossil CO2 are flaring, venting 
and other fugitive emissions in the Category 1B and are also excluded from this completeness checking method. 
The feedstock balance check (Section 1.4.3.2) is simpler in concept and starts from non-energy statistics for 
feedstock/reductant supplies and compares them with the reported (or implied) requirements for feedstock by the 
various IPPU processes. This check identifies discrepancies between the two sets of data that may indicate 
omitted processes or feedstock use classified as fuel combustion.

The principle of this method is based on comparisons of reported CO2 emissions with potential CO2 emissions 
from the fuel for non-energy uses and consists of three steps: 
1. CO2-equivalent carbon contents are calculated for the non-energy use of fossil fuels as reported in national 
energy statistics (including the coke and other solid fuel inputs into blast furnaces).  
2. Total CO2 emissions reported per IPPU subcategory are related to (main) fuels used for non-energy 
purposes. This should include emissions from by-product fuels transferred from the IPPU Sector and 
reported elsewhere in the Energy Sector. 
Chapter 1: Introduction 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
1.17 
3. Total reported fossil IPPU CO2 emissions are compared with a top-down estimate of potential CO2 of the 
carbon content of the feedstocks used. The comparison is made by calculating the actual CO2 released as a 
fraction of the total potential CO2 in the input fuels. The fractions may then be compared with values 
observed for different industries (see below, ‘Step 3: Actions arising from the comparison’). In case of 
significant discrepancies, likely causes of differences should be listed, taking into account the accuracy of 
the allocation of sources to individual fuels. 
Step 1: Feedstock amount and CO2-equivalent carbon content 
The amount of feedstock and non-energy use entered in Table 1.3 is the final consumption of each fuel for ‘non-
energy’ purposes as reported in the national energy statistics. The quantities should be expressed in, or converted 
to, Terajoules (TJ) using the net calorific (lower heating) values (see Chapter 1 of Volume 2 for IPCC default 
values). Next the potential CO2-eq. emissions associated with the carbon contents can be calculated using 
country-specific or IPCC default carbon content values (see Chapter 1 of Volume 2 for IPCC default values). 
If a country accounts separately for the production of by-product gases from chemical production processes in 
their energy statistics, these should also be added in the top row of fuel amounts associated with feedstock 
emissions of CO2 and the corresponding amount of CO2-eq. calculated using country-specific carbon content 
values. 
Step 2: Allocating source category CO2 emissions to one or more feedstock fuels 
The CO2 emissions reported in the IPPU Sector that arise mainly from the metal and chemical industries, should 
be allocated to the corresponding fuel types used as input for the process. Emissions resulting from the non-
energy use of fossil fuels reported elsewhere should be included here too. Guidance for this allocation is 
provided in Table 1.3, where for each subcategory the most common feedstock fuel is marked as a bolded box. 
Other fuels that are known to be used as feedstock for these sources are indicated with a regular box. In most 
cases these boxes are the only allocations to be checked for the country-specific application. If no specific 
information is available, all CO2 emissions may be assigned to the bold box. Where country-specific information 
shows that several fuels are used as feedstock, either the specific fractions for each fuel can be used or each may 
be given an equal share of the source total. 
Step 3: Actions arising from the comparison  
The fraction of potential CO2 actually released may be calculated per fuel type or per group of fuels, and can be 
assessed for their level, trend and interannual variation. The values of the fractions may be compared with values 
inferred from the information provided for the methodological tiers for the source categories or from literature 
(e.g., Neelis et al., 2005). 
Small differences or changes may be expected due to process-specific technological or operational differences. 
Major differences can arise from large differences in technologies or, when comparing with other countries’ data 
or literature, from the use of a different definition of feedstocks (for details see Section 1.3). A third explanation 
of discrepancies may be due to errors in the presumed allocation of source category emissions to specific fuel 
types used as feedstock in the process.

FEEDSTOCK BALANCE CHECK 
The principle of the feedstock balance check method is to compare the supply of feedstock/reductants as reported 
in national fuel statistics with the requirements for the feedstocks by each of the processes using them. A 
significant difference between the supply and the requirements of a feedstock leads to several suggested actions 
intended to identify omission of feedstock uses from the inventory or uses of fuel as feedstock that have been 
reported as fuel consumption or conversion. 
Unlike the CO2 completeness check the feedstock balance check is conducted at the level of fuel quantities and 
not CO2 emissions. The method seeks confirmation that all feedstock carbon has been satisfactorily attributed to 
source categories identified in the inventory. 
The workings of the method are explained below and readily set out in a worksheet (Table 1.5a). A list of 
feedstock fuels to be considered is presented in Table 1.4.

Step 1: Feedstock supply 
Figures for supply of each feedstock/reductant are taken from national fuel statistics presented in commodity or 
energy balances. They will be shown as non-energy use or feedstock use according to the country’s particular 
conventions and reductants as inputs to a transformation process. The quantities should be expressed in, or 
converted to, Terajoules (TJ) using net calorific (lower heating) values (see Chapter 1 of Volume 2 for IPCC 
default values). 
The definitional basis for feedstock reporting differs between countries and this consideration is fully discussed 
in Sections 1.2.1 and 1.3.2. Some care is therefore needed to identify and use the correct hydrocarbon input 
figures that will correspond with a process’s gross hydrocarbon requirements for the feedstock or reductant 
(including inputs not or only partly labelled as non-energy use in energy statistics). The total hydrocarbon 
process input attributed to feedstock/reductant use is required for the feedstock balance check described here, 
because the Specific Feedstock Consumption (SFC) figures of each process, as given in the table, include the 
fuel requirement. The SFC is the amount (expressed in TJ/Gg) of feedstock/reductant required per tonne of 
product produced. 
Step 2: Feedstock requirements 
The feedstock requirements of each process will include fuels taken directly or indirectly from the feedstock. 
Where the necessary data are available from industry sources they can then be entered into the ‘requirements’ 
part of the worksheet. Where the data are not available the requirements should be calculated from the 
production figures for the processes and where necessary, using expert judgement based on the emissions 
estimation used for the process(es). The figure for the process requirement is likely to be identical to the quantity 
supplied (taken from energy statistics) only when the latter has been obtained from industry sources. 
When requirements are calculated from production using the spreadsheet the production figures are those 
relevant to the process for the given feedstock. If two or more feedstocks supply a single process then the 
corresponding production figures should be used for each feedstock. 
Table 1.5b provides SFC factors linking production figures to feedstock requirements. The factors are the 
specific feedstock requirements of the process and include fuel use of the feedstock. The factors provided in 
Table 1.5b have been derived from the methods described in this volume of these Guidelines and may be 
considered as default values. It is good practice to use national factors if they are demonstrably more relevant 
than the default factors given here. 
If Rij represents the feedstock requirements of process i for feedstock j, then the total requirement for feedstock j 
(Rj), can be expressed as:

Where: 
Rj = total requirement for feedstock j, TJ 
Rij = feedstock requirements of process i for feedstock j, TJ 
SFCij = Specific Feedstock Consumption of feedstock j in process i, TJ/Gg 
Pij  = production from process i using feedstock j, Gg 
The Rj is then compared with the figure for the supply of feedstock j. The difference appears in the Table 1.5a. 
The implementation procedure for this check is set out in the flowchart in Figure 1.3. 
Step 3: Actions arising from the comparison 
It is suggested that if the difference observed exceeds 10 percent of the feedstock supply action should be taken 
to check the data and, if the difference is confirmed, it should be investigated. The 10 percent threshold is 
necessarily arbitrary and chosen to reflect the likely overall inherent uncertainties in the data. 
It is considered good practice to focus the investigation on differences in which feedstock supply significantly 
exceeds the apparent requirements because this suggests that: 
• 
Processes and therefore sources of emissions may have been omitted; or 
• 
The specific energy requirements used in the method are too low. The specific energy requirements should 
then be adjusted to reflect the national situation. 
When the calculated requirements exceed the apparent feedstock supply it suggests that: 
• 
Uses of feedstock fuels are reported elsewhere as fuel combustion or fuel conversion uses. 
• 
A ‘net’ definition of feedstock supply may have been used in the energy statistics instead of a ‘gross’ 
definition (see the reference to ethylene and other chemicals in Section 1.3.2).  
• 
Feedstock requirements, obtained directly from industry sources, are overstated through the inclusion of 
fuels entering the plant (or more generally, the source category) which are not used in the process and 
therefore not for feedstock use. The inclusion of non-feedstock fuels should not occur when the feedstock 
requirements are derived from production data. 
Where significant discrepancies remain the likely causes of differences should be listed, taking into account the 
accuracy of the calculation with default Specific Feedstock Consumption values per source category/feedstock 
combination.

NOTES
(a) Methanol: From Section 3.9.2.2; Table 3.13 Consult table for precise value according to process used.
(c) Zinc: From Section 4.7.1 (pyrometallurgical process only) taken from Sjardin(2003) Coke consumption is 0.74 tonnes coke/tonne zinc. That is: 0.74 x 28.2 GJ/tonne (cv coke) = 21 GJ/tonne zinc.
(d) Lead: Taken from Sjardin(2003) Coke consumption is 0.26 tonnes coke/tonne lead. That is: 0.26 x 28.2 GJ/tonne (cv coke) = 7 GJ/tonne lead.
(e) Silicon carbide: From Section 3.6.2.2: "This implies a typical emission factor of 2.3 tonnes CO2/tonne petroleum coke used (IPCC, 1996), or 2.62 tonnes CO2/tonne carbide produced."
     So coke requirement is 2.62/2.3 = 1.14 tonne pet coke/tonne carbide. That is; 1.14 x 32.5 GJ/tonne (cv pet coke) = 37 GJ/tonne SiC.
(f) Calcium carbide: From: Section 3.6.2.2 "1 750 kg limestone (or 950 kg CaO), 640 kg of petroleum coke and 20 kg carbon electrodes are required to produce 1 tonne of carbide."
     So coke requirement is 0.64 x 32.5 GJ/tonne (cv pet coke) = 21 GJ/tonne CaC2.
(g) Aluminium: From Section 4.4.2.2; Table 4.11 average of two processes 1.65 tonnes CO2/tonne Al = 0.45 tonnes C/tonne Al. Assume anodes contain 84% coke and 16% pitch. (Sjardin 2003).
     Assume coke is 92% C and pitch is 93% C. Assume NCV for calcined coke is 30 MJ/kg and NCV for pitch 35.6 MJ/kg.
     Then coke requirement is 12 GJ/tonne Al and pitch requirement 3 GJ/tonne Al.
(h) Carbon black: Assumed identical to fuel oil. See note (n) below.
(i) Aluminium: See note (g) above.
(j) Ethylene: From Section 3.9.2.3; Table 3.25 Ethane requirement is: NCV for ethane x 1/yield matrix value. That is: 46.4 x 1/0.803 = 58 GJ/tonne.
(k) Ethylene: Feedstock requirement can be derived as is derived for ethane. See note (j) above.
(l) Ammonia: From Section 3.2.2.2; Table 3.1;Partial oxidation assumed.
(m) Methanol: From Section 3.9.2.2; Table 3.13. Consult table for precise value according to process used.
(n) Carbon Black: Based on Voll et al . (1997) and EU Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (2004), Table 4.13.
(o) Ammonia: From Section 3.2.2.2; Table 3.1.
(p) Methanol: From Section 3.9.2.2; Table 3.13;Consult table for precise value according to process used.
(q) Carbon Black: Based on Voll et al . (1997) and EU Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (2004), Table 4.13.
(b) Iron and Steel: From Section 4.2.2.3: "The conversion factors provided in Table 6.2 of the IPPC Document are 940 kg pig iron per tonne liquid steel and 358 kg coke per tonne pig iron." so coke requirement is
     0.358 x 28.2 GJ/tonne (cv coke) = 10 GJ/tonne iron.

1.4.4 
Reporting and documentation of allocation and QC 
of completeness 
It is good practice to review, summarise and document the completeness checks, if performed, for non-energy 
uses of fuels and fugitive emissions from fuel manufacture. This involves identifying the uses within the IPPU 
Sector and Fuel Combustion Activities (Category 1A) in the Energy Sectors, as discussed in this section. 
Different national methods exist for accounting for feedstock use of fuels in energy statistics and there is a 
possibility, in exceptional cases, of reporting part of the CO2 in the Energy Sector (see Sections 1.2.1 and 1.3.2). 
Consequently, it is good practice to show in the inventory report: 
• 
Where and how non-energy use of fuels has been accounted for in the inventory (whether in the Energy 
Sector or the Industrial Processes and Product Use Sector.) (Section 1.4.4.1). 
• 
Where and how carbon emissions, other than CO2, have been accounted for in the inventory. These arise 
from non-combustion and non-biogenic processes involving fossil carbon such as solvent use. 
• 
Results of completeness checks performed, when applicable. Details on the QC activities on completeness 
should be kept as internal documentation (Section 1.4.4.2), in accordance with the guidance on QA/QC (see 
Chapter 6 of Volume 1). 
The first bullet point refers to the allocation of corresponding emissions, in the IPPU Sector or, possibly, also in 
the Fuel Combustion Activities (Category 1A) in the Energy Sector, and to the definition of ‘non-energy’ or 
‘feedstock’ used in the national energy statistics. Depending on the definition of the source categories, the 
contribution of feedstock and non-energy use CO2 emissions varies from less than a percent up to about 5 
percent of national total fossil fuel related CO2 emissions.  
The description of the completeness check should explain any allocation of a particular source to several sectors. 
In particular, how adjustments have been made to industrial process emissions should be explained in cases 
where fuel by-products (off-gases or process vent gas) are transferred to another source category in the IPPU 
Sector or in the Energy Sector. 
1.4.4.1 
ALLOCATION OF CO2 FROM NON-ENERGY USE 
Table 1.6 can be used to document and report the following information, summarising the subcategories in 
which the sectoral CO2 emissions (other than those from fuel combustion) from the fossil fuels used are reported.  
The amounts of each fuel type consumed for non-combustion purposes (which correspond to excluded carbon in 
the CO2 Reference Approach) should be recorded as internal documentation.  This relates to: 
• 
The division between manufacturing process emissions reported in the IPPU Sector and fuel combustion 
emissions reported in the Energy Sector. 
• 
The allocation of CO2 emissions from the direct use of ‘fuels’ for their physical properties and from the use 
of chemical products in the IPPU Sector. The emissions from the waste disposal of these products (e.g., 
incineration) are dealt with in the Waste Sector. 
In the allocation reporting table (Table1.6) the ‘Primary NEU fuel type’ and ‘Other NEU fuel types’ should be 
entered for each category. The same CO2 emissions reported in the IPPU sectoral background table are entered 
into the IPPU emissions column (or the notation keys NE, NO, IE, where applicable). Then CO2 emissions 
related to the use of fossil fuels for non-energy purposes reported in source categories other than IPPU are added 
to the appropriate 1A subcategories. These are labelled in the IPPU source categories as (partly) included 
elsewhere in the IPPU reporting with a reference to where they are reported. Thus the table includes all 
emissions from the IPPU Sector wherever they are reported and so documents the complete reporting of these 
emissions in the IPPU and Energy Sectors. 
The inclusion of the Energy Sector improves transparency of complete CO2 emissions reporting as regards the 
emissions from waste gases and other gases such as blast furnace gas produced from industrial processes but 
used for fuel combustion in other economic sectors and thus reported in the Energy Sector.

1.25 
1.4.4.2 
COMPLETENESS OF CO2 FROM NON-ENERGY USE 
In addition to the summary of the review of the allocation and completeness of emissions from non-energy uses 
of fossil fuels it is good practice to document: 
• 
A description of the emission calculation methods used, in the respective source category sections of the 
report. This should include the reason for any departure of allocations compared to the suggested IPCC 
source classification, if applicable. 
• 
The results of the CO2 completeness check if used, for at least the base year (where data permit) and the last 
reported year, presented in a table such as Table 1.3, as internal documentation. 
• 
If the feedstock balance check for completeness was also used, a table showing the difference between the 
inferred estimate of feedstock consumption and the reported feedstock deliveries; at minimum for the base 
year (where data permit) and the two most recent years (i.e., as in Table 1.5a) as internal documentation. 
• 
An explanation of significant unexpected discrepancies, if any, in level or trend. This should include the 
main cause of these differences. 
• 
Conclusions from the comparison in terms of whether significant CO2 emissions seem to be missing, and if 
so, in which part of the inventory they occur, and an estimate of the sizes of the omissions.

CHOOSING BETWEEN THE MASS-BALANCE 
AND EMISSION-FACTOR APPROACHES  
1.5.1 
Introduction 
Chapters 7 and 8 describe several different methods for estimating HFC, PFC, and SF6 emissions from long-
lived, pressurized equipment, including air-conditioning and refrigeration equipment, electrical equipment, and 
fire-protection equipment. These methods generally fall into two categories: (1) approaches based on a mass-
balance of chemical consumption and changes in equipment stocks, and (2) approaches based on chemical banks 
and emission factors. Both the mass-balance and the emission-factor approaches can be applied at several levels 
of aggregation, including, from most to least aggregated, global, regional and national. Further levels of 
disaggregation vary depending on the type of emissions. For emissions described in Chapter 8 (e.g., SF6 from 
electrical equipment), it is possible to apply methods at the facility level or the lifecycle stage of the equipment 
at the facility. For Chapter 7 (e.g., HFCs and PFCs from air-conditioning, refrigeration and fire-protection 
equipment), methods can be applied at the application (Tier 1) or sub-application (Tier 2) level. Both types of 
approaches can also be highly accurate, but depending on the circumstances and data availability, one may be 
more accurate than the other. This section describes the mass-balance and emission-factor approaches and good 
practice for choosing between them based on national circumstances.   
1.5.2 
Strengths and weaknesses of the mass-balance 
approach 
The mass-balance approach tracks the amount of new chemical introduced into the country, facility, or stock of 
equipment (at the application or sub-application level) each year. This approach then accounts for the share of 
this new chemical that is used to fill new equipment capacity or to replace destroyed gas. The consumption that 
cannot be accounted for is assumed either to replace emitted gas or to be emitted itself. 
The mass-balance approach has the important advantage of reflecting actual emissions at the place where they 
occurred, capturing differences not only among types of facilities and equipment, but among individual facilities 
and pieces of equipment. Thus, the mass-balance approach is likely to be more accurate where emission rates 
vary across equipment and facilities, and to some extent, where emission rates vary over time. Because emission 
rates frequently do vary, often unpredictably, it is good practice to use the mass-balance approach rather than the 
emission-factor approach as long as (1) accurate activity data for the mass-balance approach are available, and (2) 
neither of the drawbacks described below applies to the process or equipment whose emissions are being 
estimated. 
The mass-balance approach has two drawbacks. First, the accuracy of the approach is limited by the precision of 
mass-, density-, and pressure-measuring devices, which tends to fall around ±1 or 2 percent. If the emission rate 
from a process (such as equipment installation) is in this range (i.e., 3 percent of nameplate capacity per year or 
less), then the mass-balance approach will be inaccurate for that process.   
Second, the mass-balance approach detects some emissions after they occur, sometimes several years later. This 
is because equipment that leaks slowly can operate for years or even decades with less than a full charge. This 
time lag can sharply reduce accuracy where servicing is infrequent and/or stocks are growing quickly. This is 
likely to be the case for (1) types of equipment that are almost never refilled during their lifetimes (e.g., sealed-
pressure electrical equipment and hermetically sealed air-conditioning and refrigeration equipment, such as 
household refrigerators), and (2) countries that have only recently begun using electrical equipment containing 
SF6 and/or air conditioning and refrigeration equipment containing HFCs. In the latter case, the mass-balance 
approach will significantly underestimate emissions during the first few years of equipment use, because 
chemical consumption for refilling equipment will be close to zero until the first set of equipment is refilled for 
the first time. For electrical equipment, this may not occur until 10 to 20 years after the introduction of the 
equipment into the country, depending on the leak rate of the equipment. For air-conditioning and refrigeration 
equipment, this may not occur until 5 to 20 years after the introduction of the equipment, again depending on the 
leak rate of the equipment.   
Figures 1.4 and 1.5 illustrate the ‘lag error’ associated with the mass-balance approach for these two situations. 
Figure 1.4 focuses on the error that can occur when countries have only recently begun using electrical 
equipment containing SF6 or air-conditioning equipment containing HFCs. In this example, equipment is 
serviced (refilled) every 10 years and has a lifetime of 30 years. Annual equipment sales are assumed to remain 
constant, but the total stock of equipment grows until the lifetime of the equipment is reached. For illustrative

purposes, leaks are assumed to make up 100 percent of emissions (e.g., emissions at equipment installation, 
servicing and disposal are assumed to be zero).7

In Figure 1.4, after the chemical is first introduced into the equipment, emissions (‘Actual Leaks’) grow rapidly 
as the bank of chemical in the equipment stock doubles in the second year, triples in the third, and quadruples in 
the fourth. However, sales of the chemical for refilling (‘Apparent Leaks’) remain close to zero until year 11, 
when the equipment installed in year 1 is recharged for the first time. In year 21, sales jump again, as, for the 
first time, two sets of equipment are serviced. When equipment begins to retire, apparent leaks rise to equal 
actual leaks (resulting in a ratio of 1.0), and the lag error disappears.   
Figure 1.5 describes the same situation as Figure 1.4, except in this case, annual equipment sales are assumed to 
grow by 5 percent per year. The relationship between apparent and actual leaks is very similar to that shown in 
Figure 1.4 until the equipment begins to retire. At that point, apparent leaks rise, but they never quite equal 
actual leaks. Instead, the relationship between apparent leaks and actual leaks stabilizes at a constant, 
equilibrium value, 0.78 for this scenario.   
                                                           
7  In this example, the nameplate capacity of the equipment sold each year is assumed to equal 1 000 tonnes, and the leak rate 
is assumed to equal one percent per year. Note, however, that the relationship between apparent and actual leaks is actually 
independent of the sizes of the annual sales and the leak rate.

In general, if the average time between refilling events is R, then the mass balance approach will yield a very 
poor estimate of emissions until R+1 years have passed since the chemical was introduced into the country. The 
accuracy of the estimate will fluctuate in following years, reaching a maximum once the equipment begins to 
retire.8 
1.5.3 
Strengths and weaknesses of the emission-factor 
approach 
The emission-factor approach equates emissions to the product of an emission factor and either (1) the 
nameplate capacity of the equipment that uses or holds a chemical, or (2) the bank of a chemical. (These 
quantities are similar but not necessarily identical.) Fortunately, where the mass-balance approach is likely to be 
inaccurate, the emission-factor approach can be used. However, the robustness and reliability of an emission-
                                                           
8   The maximum, long-term accuracy of the mass-balance approach depends on the frequency with which equipment is 
refilled, the growth rate of new equipment sales, and the fraction of emissions represented by leaks. The accuracy can be 
estimated using the following expressions (for exponentially growing equipment stock):

 where R = number of years between recharges and g = the annual growth rate of equipment sales. (Note that this is the 
same as the growth rate of the stock once equilibrium has been reached.)

 If inventory compilers can obtain data on the variables in these equations, they can use them both to quantify and to 
compensate for the long-term lag error associated with the mass-balance approach (Schaefer, 2002).

factor model depend heavily on the continuing accuracy of its emission factors. In addition, emission factors for 
these categories (i.e., ODS substitutes and SF6 from electrical equipment) do not exist for all regions of the world.  
Emission rates can vary widely among facilities and types of equipment and over time, depending on the design 
of the equipment (which varies depending on when and where the equipment was manufactured), chemical 
handling practices, availability of state-of-the-art handling equipment, chemical prices, legislation (e.g., chemical 
recovery requirements), and other factors. It is therefore good practice to develop emission factors using a 
representative sample of facilities and types of equipment, and to check these factors at least every five years. 
The Tier 3 emission-factor methods in Chapters 8 as well as the Tier 2 emission-factor methods (Tier 2a 
methods) in Chapter 7 require that the country and/or its facilities keep detailed records of the chosen methods 
for verifying and validating the emission factors. If necessary, emission factors will have to be adjusted to ensure 
that emission estimates are ultimately linked to measurements of actual gas loss (e.g., as determined by chemical 
sales and/or equipment recharging). 
Table 1.7 summarises the principles, strengths, and weaknesses of the mass-balance and emission-factor 
approaches. 
TABLE 1.7 
CHOOSING BETWEEN THE MASS-BALANCE AND EMISSION-FACTOR APPROACHES 
Mass-Balance Approach 
Emission-Factor Approach 
How it works: Tracks the amount of new chemical 
introduced into the country or facility each year, 
accounting for gas that is used to fill new equipment 
capacity or to replace destroyed gas. The consumption 
that cannot be accounted for is assumed to be emitted or 
to replace emitted gas.   
How it works: Equates emissions to the product of an 
emission factor and either (1) the nameplate capacity of 
the equipment that uses or holds a chemical, or (2) the 
bank of a chemical. (These quantities are similar but not 
necessarily identical.) 
Level of aggregation: Both the mass-balance and the emission-factor-based approaches can be applied at several 
levels of aggregation. For electrical equipment, these include the country, the facility, and the lifecycle stage of the 
equipment at the facility. For refrigeration, air-conditioning and fire-protection equipment, they include the 
application, sub-application or further-disaggregated equipment types.. 
More accurate where: 
• 
Emission rates vary across facilities and/or 
equipment, and to some extent, over time 
• 
Process emission rates are above 3%/year 
• 
Equipment is refilled frequently  
• 
Equipment stock is growing slowly 
• 
Equipment containing HFCs, PFCs, or SF6 has 
been in use in the country for at least as long 
as the typical time between refills for that 
equipment. 
o 
10-20 years for electrical equipment 
o 
5-20 years for air-conditioning and 
refrigeration equipment 
More accurate where: 
• 
Emission rates are fairly constant within 
defined types of equipment and/or facilities 
• 
Process emission rates are below 3%/year 
• 
Equipment is rarely or never refilled  
• 
Equipment stock is growing quickly 
• 
Equipment containing HFCs, PFCs, or SF6 has 
been in use in the country for less than the 
typical time between refills for that 
equipment. 
o 
10-20 years for electrical equipment 
o 
5-20 years for air-conditioning and 
refrigeration equipment 
Other considerations: In the long run, this approach 
will reflect actual emissions, but there may be a 
significant time lag (in some cases, 20 years or more) 
between emissions and their detection. 
Other considerations: Emission factors should be 
periodically checked to ensure that they remain 
consistent with reality.
