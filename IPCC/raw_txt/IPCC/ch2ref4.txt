Emission of sulphur hexafluoride from fire extinguishing equipment
Some of the new substitutes for halon in fire extinguishing equipment contain sulphur
hexafluoride, SF6, probably in blends with HFC.  If the products contain SF6, it is emitted
to the atmosphere in the same manner as HFC or PFC.  The equations for the estimation
of HFC and PFC emissions from fire extinguishing equipment are therefore also valid for
SF6, since they have to be adjusted for the proportion of the SF6 in the original blend.
Emissions of SF6 are to be calculated according to the proportion of this chemical in the
blend.

HFCs may be used as replacements for CFCs and HCFCs in aerosol propellants in
industrial and technical applications, and household, medical and personal care products.
The HFCs that may be used include HFC-125, HFC-134a, 152a, and HFC-227ea (Kroeze,
1995; U.S. EPA, 1992b).
Gases from aerosols are usually released shortly after production, on average six months
after sale in the United States and Europe.  During use of aerosols, 100 per cent of the
chemical is emitted (Gamlen et al., 1986; U.S. EPA, 1992a).  For this methodology, aerosol
emissions are estimated to be one half of the current year sales of the aerosol plus one
half of the previous year sales (Gamlen et al., 1986).  In other words, aerosol emissions in
year t can be calculated as follows:
Emissions of HFCs in year t
=
50% of the quantity of HFCs contained in aerosols sold in year t
+
50% of the quantity of HFC contained in aerosols sold in year t-1
This calculation accounts for the six month lag from purchase to use.  Total aerosol use
each year can be calculated as the number of aerosol cans sold in a given year times the
charge of HFC or PFC in each can.  Finally, Kroeze (1995) points out that technologies
do not exist to reduce emissions from aerosol cans.

HFCs and PFCs may be used as replacements for CFC-113 in metal cleaning, electronics,
and precision cleaning applications and as replacements for aerosol cleaning.  The
compounds that may be used include HFC-43-10, PFC-614, PFC-512, PFC-612, PFC-716,
and PFC-819 (Kroeze, 1995; U.S. EPA, 1992b).
Chemicals used as cleaning agents are emitted during, or shortly after, use and are
typically 100 per cent of total use (Fisher and Midgley, 1993; U.S. EPA, 1992a).  This
methodology assumes that solvents, on average, are used six months after they are sold.
Total HFC or PFC emissions in year t can therefore be calculated as follows:

It has been estimated that solvent emissions can be reduced by up to 80 per cent through
the use of improved housekeeping and recycling practices.

Other Applications
Other applications in which HFCs and PFCs may replace CFCs and HCFCs include
sterilisation equipment, tobacco expansion applications, and use as solvents in the
manufacture of adhesives, coatings, and inks.  The specific compounds include HFC-125,
HFC-134a, and HFC-227ea (Kroeze, 1995; U.S. EPA, 1992b).
For other applications, it is assumed that all HFCs and PFC are released within 6 months
after production.  Emissions in the year t can be calculated as follows:
Emissions of HFCs or PFCs in year t
=
50% of the quantity of HFCs/PFCs sold for other applications in year t
+
 50% of the quantity of HFCs/PFCs sold in year t-1

Primary uses of SF6
Primary uses of SF6 include the following:
Gas-Insulated Switchgear and Circuit Breakers
SF6 is used as an insulation medium in high tension electrical equipment including gas
insulated switchgear (GIS) and circuit breakers.
Fire suppression and explosion protection
Some of the new gases placed on the market as substitutes for halons in fire extinguishing
equipment, may contain up to 20 per cent sulphur hexafluoride, SF6.  These applications
are described in Section 2.17.4.4.
Globally, it is estimated that about 80 per cent of SF6 is used in gas-insulated switchgear
and circuit breakers, 5 to 10 per cent in the magnesium and aluminium industries, and 5
to 10 per cent in a number of smaller applications (Ko et al., 1993).

Other applications
SF6 is used in a variety of additional applications including as an insulating medium in
sound proof windows, in leak detectors, gas-air tracers, and various electronic
applications.  The use of SF6 in production of aluminium and magnesium is covered under
Section 2.13.8.
Recommended methodology for estimating SF6 emissions
Total emissions of SF6 used in GIS application and circuit breakers can be assumed to be
approximately 1 per cent of the total quantity of SF6 contained in such equipment each
year (NILU, 1993).  In addition, if it is assumed that GIS equipment has a lifetime of 30
years, then approximately 70 per cent of the SF6 will remain in the equipment upon
retirement and will then be released upon disposal of the equipment (NILU, 1993).  Total
emissions from GIS applications can therefore be estimated as:
Emissions of SF6 in year t
=
1% of the total charge of SF6 contained in the existing stock of equipment in
year t
+
 70% of the quantity of equipment manufactured in year t-30.
The total charge of SF6 contained in equipment can be estimated as the product of the
total quantity of equipment in operation and the typical charge size of equipment.  Charge
sizes for GIS equipment rated to 50 kV or more can range from hundreds to thousands
of kilos per installation, and for low-voltage switches contain 1-2 kg per installation
(Kroeze, 1995).
If data on the total stock of GIS are unavailable, then it should be assumed that emissions
equal consumption.
