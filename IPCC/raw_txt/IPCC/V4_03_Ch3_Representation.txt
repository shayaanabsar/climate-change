3 CONSISTENT REPRESENTATION OF LANDS 
3.1 
INTRODUCTION 
Information, in terms of classification, area data, and sampling that represents various land-use categories, is 
needed to estimate the carbon stocks, and the emission and removal of greenhouse gases associated with 
Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) activities. This chapter provides guidance on using different 
types of data to represent land-use categories, and conversions between land-use categories, so that they are 
applied as appropriately and consistently as possible in inventory calculations.  
Countries use various methods to obtain data, including annual census, periodic surveys and remote sensing. 
Each of these methods of data collection will yield different types of information (e.g., maps or tabulations), at 
different reporting frequencies, and with different attributes. Guidance is provided on the use of three generic 
approaches.   
Approach 1 identifies the total area for each individual land-use category within a country, but does not provide 
detailed information on the nature of conversions between land uses. Approach 2 introduces tracking of 
conversions between land-use categories. Approach 3 extends the information available in Approach 2 by 
allowing land-use conversions to be tracked on a spatially explicit basis. Countries may use a mix of Approaches 
for different regions over time. 
The guidance presented here is intended to assist countries in making the best use of available data and reducing, 
as far as practicable, possible overlaps and omissions in reporting. The guidance allows informed decisions on 
the appropriate use of data of different types by those preparing greenhouse gas inventories, but is not intended 
to be prescriptive on how data may be collected.  Generally, all data should be:  
• 
adequate, i.e., capable of representing land-use categories, and conversions between land-use categories, as 
needed to estimate carbon stock changes and greenhouse gas emissions and removals;  
• 
consistent, i.e., capable of representing land-use categories consistently over time, without being unduly 
affected by artificial discontinuities in time-series data; 
• 
complete, which means that all land within a country should be included, with increases in some areas 
balanced by decreases in others, recognizing the bio-physical stratification of land if needed (and as can be 
supported by data) for estimating and reporting emissions and removals of greenhouse gases; and 
• 
transparent, i.e., data sources, definitions, methodologies and assumptions should be clearly described. 
The descriptions of land use follow the framework of:  
• 
land-use category - is the broad land use (one of the six land-use categories described below) reported as 
either land remaining in a land-use category (i.e., remaining in the same use throughout the inventory time-
series) or land converted to a new land-use category (representing a change in land use).  
• 
sub-category - refers to special circumstances (e.g., areas of grazing within Forest Land) that are estimated 
and reported separately but do not duplicate land in the broad land-use category.  
• 
Land-use categories and sub-categories may be further stratified on the basis of land-use practices and bio-
physical characteristics in order to create more homogeneous spatial units as may be used for emissions 
estimation (see Table 3.1 for examples). 
3.2 
LAND-USE CATEGORIES 
The six broad land-use categories described below form the basis of estimating and reporting greenhouse gas 
emissions and removals from land use and land-use conversions. The land uses may be considered as top-level 
categories for representing all land-use areas, with sub-categories describing special circumstances significant to 
emissions estimation, and where data are available. The categories are broad enough to classify all land areas in 
most countries and to accommodate differences in national land-use classification systems, and may be readily 
stratified (e.g., by climate or ecological zones). The categories (and sub-categories) are intended to be identified 
through use of Approaches for representing land-use area data described in subsequent sections.  
The definitions of land-use categories may incorporate land cover type, land use based, or a combination of the 
two. Care needs to be taken in inferring land use from the land cover characteristics and vice versa. For example, 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
3.6 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
in some countries, significant areas of the Forest Land category may be grazed, and firewood may be collected 
from scattered trees in the Grassland category. These areas with different use may be significant enough for 
countries to consider them separately as additional sub-categories. Countries should ensure that land is not 
accounted for in more than one category or sub-category, in order to avoid double-counting of land areas.  
For convenience, the categories are referred to as land-use categories. These particular categories have been 
selected because they are: 
• 
robust as a basis for emissions and removals estimation; 
• 
implementable; and  
• 
complete, in that all land areas in a country  may be classified by these categories without duplication. 
Countries will use their own definitions of these categories, which may or may not refer to internationally 
accepted definitions, such as those by FAO, Ramsar 1, etc. Only broad and non-prescriptive definitions are 
provided for the land-use categories and of managed and unmanaged lands. Countries should describe and apply 
definitions consistently for the national land area over time.  
Countries should describe the methods and definitions used to determine areas of managed and unmanaged lands. 
Managed land is land where human interventions and practices have been applied to perform production, 
ecological or social functions. All land definitions and classifications should be specified at the national level, 
described in a transparent manner, and be applied consistently over time. Emissions/removals of greenhouse 
gases do not need to be reported for unmanaged land. However, it is good practice for countries to quantify, and 
track over time, the area of unmanaged land so that consistency in area accounting is maintained as land-use 
change occurs. 
As the resolution of the national land use, mapping may be more coarse than the definitions used to describe the 
land-use categories (e.g., if the forest definition applied by a country includes a minimum area, of say one 
hectare for example, yet the available land-use mapping minimum unit size is five hectares) it is possible that 
there will be small (unidentified) areas of one land-use category reported under another.  These small areas may 
be reported under the mapped land use when they remain in the same category. If they are converted to another 
land-use category (e.g., a small area of Forest Land converted to another use is identified within an area 
previously mapped as Cropland) and this is identified (e.g., by a permit application for the activity) then they 
should be reported under the appropriate land-use conversion (i.e., Forest Land converted to another specified 
land use) and subtracted from the original (previously misclassified) land-use (remaining) area.  
The land-use categories for greenhouse gas inventory reporting are:  
(i) Forest Land 
This category includes all land with woody vegetation consistent with thresholds used to define Forest Land in 
the national greenhouse gas inventory. It also includes systems with a vegetation structure that currently fall 
below, but in situ could potentially reach the threshold values used by a country to define the Forest Land 
category. 
(ii) Cropland  
This category includes cropped land, including rice fields, and agro-forestry systems where the vegetation 
structure falls below the thresholds used for the Forest Land category.  
(iii) Grassland  
This category includes rangelands and pasture land that are not considered Cropland. It also includes systems 
with woody vegetation and other non-grass vegetation such as herbs and brushes that fall below the threshold 
values used in the Forest Land category. The category also includes all grassland from wild lands to recreational 
areas as well as agricultural and silvi-pastural systems, consistent with national definitions.  
(iv) Wetlands  
This category includes areas of peat extraction and land that is covered or saturated by water for all or part of the 
year (e.g., peatlands) and that does not fall into the Forest Land, Cropland, Grassland or Settlements categories. 
It includes reservoirs as a managed sub-division and natural rivers and lakes as unmanaged sub-divisions.  
                                                           
1 Refers to Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. The Convention on Wetlands, signed in Ramsar, Iran, in 1971, is an 
intergovernmental treaty which provides the framework for national action and international cooperation for the 
conservation and wise use of wetlands and their resources. 
Chapter 3: Consistent Representation of Lands 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.7 
(v) Settlements  
This category includes all developed land, including transportation infrastructure and human settlements of any 
size, unless they are already included under other categories. This should be consistent with national definitions. 
(vi) Other Land 
This category includes bare soil, rock, ice, and all land areas that do not fall into any of the other five categories. 
It allows the total of identified land areas to match the national area, where data are available.  If data are 
available, countries are encouraged to classify unmanaged lands by the above land-use categories (e.g., into 
Unmanaged Forest Land, Unmanaged Grassland, and Unmanaged Wetlands).  This will improve transparency 
and enhance the ability to track land-use conversions from specific types of unmanaged lands into the categories 
above. 
LAND-USE CONVERSIONS 
Full application of the guidance requires estimation of land-use conversions that take place between data 
collection intervals, particularly when different carbon stock estimates and different emission and removal 
factors are associated with lands before and after a transition. Applicable land uses and land-use conversions are 
shown below:   
FF  
=  
Forest Land Remaining Forest Land 
 
LF  
=  
Land Converted to Forest Land 
GG  
=  
Grassland Remaining Grassland 
 
LG  
=  
Land Converted to Grassland 
CC  
=  
Cropland Remaining Cropland 
 
LC  
=  
Land Converted to Cropland 
WW  
=  
Wetlands Remaining Wetlands 
 
LW

Land Converted to Wetlands 
SS

Settlements Remaining Settlements 
 
LS  
=  
Land Converted to Settlements 
OO  
=  
Other Land Remaining Other Land 
 
LO  
=  
Land Converted to Other Land 
 
Where detailed data about the origin of land converted to a category are available (which will depend on the 
Approach available to a country to represent land-use areas), countries can specify the land-use conversion. For 
example, LC can be sub-divided into Forest Land Converted to Cropland (FC) and Grassland Converted to 
Cropland (GC). While both land areas end up in the Cropland category, the differences in their emissions and 
removals of greenhouse gases due to their origin should be represented and reported wherever possible. When 
applying these land-use category conversions, countries should classify land under only one (end land use) 
category to prevent double counting. The reporting category is therefore the end-use category, not the category 
of origin prior to the land-use conversion.  
If a country's national land-use classification system does not match categories (i) to (vi) as described above, the 
land-use classifications should be combined or disaggregated in order to represent the categories presented here. 
Countries should report on the procedure adopted for the reallocation. The national definitions for all categories 
used in the inventory and any threshold or parameter values used in the definitions should be specified. Where 
national land classification systems are being changed or developed for the first time, compatibility with land-
use classes (i) to (vi) above should be sought. 
The broad land-use categories listed above may be further stratified (as described in Section 3.3.2) by climate or 
ecological zone, soil and vegetation type, etc., as necessary, to match land areas with the methods for assessing 
carbon stock changes and greenhouse gas emissions and removals described in Chapters 2 and 4 to 9 of this 
Volume. Default climate and soil classification schemes are provided in Annex 3A.5. Examples of stratifications 
that are used for Tier 1 emissions and removals estimation are summarized in Table 3.1. Specific stratification 
systems vary by land use and carbon pools and are used in the estimation methods later in this Volume.  
Guidance on stratifying land-use areas to match data needs for estimating emissions and removals is provided in 
Section 3.3.2 of this chapter.

REPRESENTING LAND-USE AREAS 
This section describes three Approaches that may be used to represent areas of land use using the categories 
defined in the previous section. They are presented below in order of increasing information content. Approach 1 
identifies the total change in area for each individual land-use category within a country, but does not provide 
information on the nature and area of conversions between land uses. Approach 2 introduces tracking of land-use 
conversions between categories (but is not spatially explicit). Approach 3 extends Approach 2 by allowing land-
use conversions to be tracked on a spatially explicit basis. 
The Approaches are not presented as hierarchical tiers and do not imply any increase or decrease in accuracy but 
reflect collection methods and attributes and, therefore, appropriate ways to use the data.  Accuracy is affected as 
much or more by the quality of application of the Approach as by the Approach itself. The Approaches are not 
mutually exclusive, and the mix of Approaches selected by a country should reflect emissions estimation needs 
and national circumstances. One Approach may be applied uniformly to all areas and land-use categories within 
a country, or different Approaches may be applied to different regions or categories or in different time intervals. 
Chapter 3: Consistent Representation of Lands 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.9 
In all cases, countries should characterize and account for all relevant land areas in a country consistently and as 
transparently as possible.  
All data should reflect the historical trends in land-use area, as needed for the inventory methods described in 
Chapters 2 and 4 to 9 of this Volume. The commencement time for the historical data required is based on the 
amount of time needed for dead organic matter and soil carbon stocks to reach equilibrium following land-use 
conversion (20 years is recommended as a default, but can be longer, e.g., for temperate and boreal systems). 
After the period to reach equilibrium has passed, land that was added to a land-use conversion category needs to 
be transferred to “land remaining in a land-use category”. The time-series data on land-use conversion is 
therefore also used to determine the annual transfer of area from the category “land converted to category” to 
“land remaining in a land-use category”.  
TIME-SERIES 
Inventory requires data on land-use area for at least two points in time relevant to the inventory year.  For 
Approach 1 (identifying only the net national change in area of each land-use category, but not the transfers 
between them), the historical land use may still not be known.  In such circumstances countries should either 
infer the previous land use (see Section 3.3.2.2 below) or assume that the land has remained in the land-use 
category for all time prior to the land-use conversion. This assumption may underestimate removals where 
conversions to land uses with higher carbon contents predominate, or underestimate emissions in the opposite 
case.    
It is important that there is a consistent time-series in the preparation of land-use category and conversion data so 
that artifact from method change is not included as an actual land-use conversion. Care should also be taken to 
ensure that the areas of managed and unmanaged land are both defined and estimated consistently. The following 
section details how to deal with changes in managed land areas (and consequent changes in carbon stock) when 
using stock change methods for emissions estimation.    
CONSISTENT USE OF LAND AREA IN CARBON STOCK ESTIMATES 
Over the time-series of a national inventory, it is likely that the total area of managed lands will increase as 
unmanaged lands are converted to managed land. In this case, where the land area is used to estimate the carbon 
stock (when using a stock-difference method of emissions estimation), it is possible that the entry of additional 
land into the inventory (by changing from an unmanaged to managed status) will incorrectly appear as a carbon 
stock increase. This could wrongly be inferred as a removal from the atmosphere, whereas in reality it is only an 
increase due to the expanded land-use area over the inventory time-series. To separate carbon stock increases 
arising from changes in area from true carbon stock changes, carbon stock estimates should be recalculated for 
the complete inventory time-series area whenever the total area of managed land changes in an annual inventory.  
The maximum area of land (and associated carbon stock) at any point in the time-series should be used as the 
basis for emissions and removals estimation throughout the inventory time-series.  Carbon stocks on unmanaged 
lands can be assumed to remain constant (thus, carbon stock changes would be zero) until the year in which land 
is classified as a managed use.   The recalculation will therefore change the initial carbon stock estimate in the 
year the land entered the inventory, but will not affect the estimation of carbon stock change over the inventory 
time-series until the relevant land becomes managed.  
DATA AVAILABILITY 
For many countries, implementing these inventory guidelines may require new data collection. Annex 3A.3 
provides general guidance on sampling techniques and Annex 3A.4 on spatially explicit (Approach 3) datasets. 
Where the data needed to apply these inventory guidelines on land use are not available nationally, data on land 
categories may be derived from global datasets (examples are provided in Annex 3A.1, but generally report on 
the basis of land cover only, and not land use). It is preferable that data used should be capable of producing 
input to uncertainty calculations. 
When using land-use data, inventory compilers should: 
• 
Harmonize definitions between the existing independent databases and also with the land-use categories to 
minimize gaps and overlaps. For example, overlaps might occur if woodland on farms were included both in 
forestry and agricultural datasets. In order to harmonize data, the woodland should be counted only once for 
greenhouse gas inventory purposes, taking into account the forest definition adopted nationally. Information 
on possible overlaps for the purposes of harmonization should be available from agencies responsible for 
surveys. Harmonization of definitions does not mean that agencies should abandon definitions that are of 
use to them but should establish the relationship between definitions in use with the aim of eliminating 
double counting and omissions. This should be done throughout the dataset to maintain time-series 
consistency. 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
3.10 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
• 
Ensure that the land-use categories used can identify all relevant activities. For example, if a country needs 
to track a managed land-use category such as Forest Land, then the classification system must distinguish 
managed from unmanaged Forest Land. 
• 
Ensure that data acquisition methods are reliable, well documented methodologically, timely, at an 
appropriate scale, and from reliable sources.  
• 
Ensure the consistent application of category definitions between time periods. For example, countries 
should check whether the definition of forest has changed over time in terms of tree crown cover and other 
parameters. If changes are identified, use the corrected data for recalculation consistently throughout the 
time-series, and report on actions taken. Guidance on recalculation can be found in Volume 1 Chapter 5. 
• 
Prepare uncertainty estimates for those land-use areas and conversions in area that will be used in the 
estimation of carbon stock changes, greenhouse gas emissions and removals. 
• 
Ensure that the national land area is consistent across the inventory time-series; otherwise stock changes will 
reflect false C increases or decreases due to a change in total land area accounted for when using a stock 
change emissions estimation method.  
• 
Assess whether the sum of the areas in the land classification databases is consistent with the total national 
area, given the level of data uncertainty. If coverage is complete, then the net sum of all the changes in land 
area between two time periods should be zero to within the uncertainties involved. In cases where coverage 
is incomplete, the difference between the area covered and the national area should, in general, be stable or 
vary slowly with time, again to within the uncertainties expected in the data. If the balancing term varies 
rapidly, or (in the case of complete coverage) sums are not equal, inventory compilers should investigate, 
explain, and make any corrections necessary. These checks on the total area should take into account the 
uncertainties in the annual or periodic surveys or censuses involved. Information on uncertainties should be 
obtained from the agencies responsible for the surveys. Remaining differences between the sum of areas 
accounted for by the available data and the national area should be within the expected uncertainty for area 
estimation. 
For some activities reported, such as the application of nitrogen fertilizer, liming and harvested wood products, 
only national aggregate data may be available. Where emissions and removals estimation methods are applied at 
a national level, it is appropriate to use such data without categorization by land use.  
3.3.1 
Three Approaches 
APPROACH 1: 
TOTAL LAND-USE AREA, NO DATA ON CONVERSIONS 
BETWEEN LAND USES 
Approach 1 represents land-use area totals within a defined spatial unit, which is often defined by political 
boundaries, such as a country, province or municipality.  Another characteristic of Approach 1 data is that only 
the net changes in land-use area can be tracked through time. Consequently, the exact location or pattern of the 
land uses is not known within the spatial unit, and moreover the exact changes in land-use categories cannot be 
ascertained. Datasets are likely to have been prepared for other purposes, such as forestry or agricultural 
statistics. Frequently, several datasets will be combined to cover all national land classifications and regions of a 
country. In this case the absence of a unified data system can potentially lead to double counting or omission, 
since the agencies involved may use different definitions of specific land use for assembling their databases. 
Ways to deal with this are suggested below.  
Tables 3.2 and 3.3 show summary land-use area data for a hypothetical country (with a national land area of 140 
million ha) using locally relevant land classifications. Table 3.2 is prepared at the level of the broad land-use 
categories. Table 3.3 depicts the same information with example stratifications to estimate the effect of various 
activities using the emissions estimation methods described elsewhere in this Volume.  
Determination of the area of land-use conversion in each category is based on the difference in area at two points 
in time, either with partial or full land area coverage. No specification of inter-category conversions (i.e., ‘land 
remaining in a land-use category’ and ‘land converted to a  new land-use category’) is possible under Approach 
1 unless supplementary data are available (which would then introduce a mix with Approach 2).  
The land-use area data may come originally from periodic sample survey data, maps or censuses (such as 
landowner surveys), but will probably not be spatially explicit. The sum of all land-use category areas may or 
may not equal the total area of the country or region under consideration, and the net result of land-use 
Chapter 3: Consistent Representation of Lands 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.11 
conversions may or may not equal zero, depending on the consistency in data collection and application in the 
inventories for each land-use category. The final result of this Approach is a table of land use at given points in 
time.  Because the total land base that is reported each year for all land-use categories should remain constant, a 
table similar to Table 3.3 should be generated as a QA/QC measure.  If inconsistencies are found, it is good 
practice to identify and correct the problem(s) for future inventories. This may require closer coordination 
among inventory teams for separate land-use categories (if analyzed separately) or possibly new surveys or other 
types of data collection. 
Other parts of this Volume require information on land area in each land-use category presented in Table 3.3 to 
be broken down into the categories “land remaining in the same land-use category” and “land converted to a new 
land-use category”. This is dependent on methodological requirements in other chapters of this Volume. If land-
use data are not sufficient to support Approach 2 (see below), where the total (gross) land conversion areas can 
be quantified, the emissions and removals may be reported in the “land remaining in the same land-use category” 
(as specified in Table 3.2). This is because the data may only be sufficient to identify the net change in area of 
each land-use category, and not the total effect of all land conversions. However, in general the methods for both 
soils and biomass related emissions estimation require land area data categorized by “lands remaining” and 
“converted to” categories and thus it is desirable to do this if possible, even if this is done using expert judgment.   
Note that by reporting only in the “land remaining” category, emissions and removals will include, but not 
explicitly reflect a changing land base within a land-use category (different areas, e.g., by the net transition in 
areas to and from the Forest Land category) over time. This may overestimate or underestimate emissions for 
that particular “land remaining” category.  However, a complete inventory will tend to counter-balance this with 
emissions and removals from another “land remaining” category in the inventory.  
It is acceptable to report non-CO2 emission by source category without attribution to land uses if emissions are 
estimated based on national statistics, without reference to individual land uses (e.g., N2O emissions from soils).  
Methods outlined in this Volume frequently estimate emissions using national statistics in this manner.

category. 
  
APPROACH 2: 
TOTAL LAND-USE AREA, INCLUDING CHANGES 
BETWEEN CATEGORIES 
The essential feature of Approach 2 is that it provides an assessment of both the net losses or gains in the area of 
specific land-use categories and what these conversions represent (i.e., changes both from and to a category). 
Thus, Approach 2 differs from Approach 1 in that it includes information on conversions between categories, but 
is still only tracking those changes without spatially-explicit location data, often based on political boundaries 
(i.e., locations of specific land use and land-use conversions are not known). Tracking land-use conversions in 
this manner will normally require estimation of initial and final land-use categories for all conversion types, as 
well as of total area of unchanged land by category. The final result of this Approach can be presented as a non-
spatially-explicit land-use conversion matrix. The matrix form is a compact format for representing the areas that 
Chapter 3: Consistent Representation of Lands 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.13 
have come under different conversions between all possible land-use categories. Existing land-use databases 
may have sufficient detail for this Approach, or it may be necessary to obtain data through sampling or other 
methods. The input data may or may not have originally been spatially-explicit (i.e., mapped or otherwise 
geographically referenced).   
For Approach 2, emission and removal factors can be chosen to reflect differences in the rate of changes in 
carbon according to the conversions between any two categories, and differences in initial carbon stocks 
associated with different land uses can be taken into account. For example, the rate of soil organic carbon loss 
will commonly be much higher from cropping than from pasture. 
Approach 2 is illustrated in Table 3.4 using the data from the Approach 1 example (Table 3.3) by adding 
information on all the conversions taking place. Such data can be written in the more compact form of a matrix 
and this is presented in Table 3.5. To illustrate the added value of Approach 2 and this land-use conversion 
matrix format, the data of Table 3.5 is given in Table 3.6 without the stratification of the land-use categories. 
This can be compared with the more limited information from Approach 1 in Table 3.2. In Table 3.6, the 
conversions into and out of land categories can be tracked, whereas in Table 3.2 only the net changes in a broad 
land-use category are detectable.    
In Tables 3.5 and 3.6, the area in the diagonal cells represents the area in each land-use category that was not 
affected by land-use conversion in this inventory year. In preparation for the greenhouse gas emission and 
removal estimations described elsewhere in this Volume, this area should be further sub-divided into the area 
that has remained in the land-use category and area that has been affected by a land-use conversion (i.e., the land 
converted to a different land-use category) in the previous Y years (where Y is the time period during which C 
pools are expected to reach equilibrium (the IPCC default is 20 years, based on soil C pools typical time to 
equilibrium after land-use conversion).  
Therefore, under the default assumption in every inventory year, the area converted to a land-use category 
should be added to the category “land converted to” and the same area removed from the land remaining in the 
land-use category. The area of land that entered that “land converted to” category, 21 years ago (if using the 
default 20 year period), should be removed and added to the category “land remaining land”. For example, in 
Table 3.5, if data indicated that four of the 56 Mha in the Grassland category had been converted from Forest 
Land 21 years ago, then four Mha of land should be moved from the category Land Converted to Grassland to 
the category Grassland Remaining Grassland in this annual inventory.  
APPROACH 3: 
SPATIALLY-EXPLICIT LAND-USE CONVERSION DATA  
Approach 3 is characterized by spatially-explicit observations of land-use categories and land-use conversions, 
often tracking patterns at specific point locations and/or using gridded map products, such as derived from 
remote sensing imagery. The data may be obtained by various sampling, wall-to-wall mapping techniques, or 
combination of the two methods. An overview of potential methods for developing Approach 3 datasets is 
provided in Annex 3A.4.  
Approach 3 data can be summarized in tables similar to Tables 3.5 and 3.6. The main advantage of spatially-
explicit data is that analysis tools such as Geographic Information Systems can be used to link multiple spatially-
explicit data sets (such as those used for stratification) and describe in detail the conditions on a particular piece 
of land prior to and after a land-use conversion. This analytical capacity can improve emissions estimates by 
better aligning land-use categories (and conversions) with strata mapped for classification of carbon stocks and 
emission factors by soil type, vegetation type. This may be particularly applicable for Tier 3 emission estimation 
methodologies. However, issues of compatible and comparable spatial resolutions need to be taken into account.  
3.3.2 
Using the data 
Figure 3.1 is a decision tree to assist in describing and/or obtaining the data on land-use areas. All three 
Approaches can, if implemented appropriately and consistently, be used to produce robust greenhouse gas 
emission and removal estimates. However, it should be noted that Approach 1 will probably not detect changes 
in biomass, such as those due to the full extent of deforestation and reforestation on separate areas of land, but 
only those due to the net conversion of land-use area from a forest to a non-forest use. In general, only Approach 
3 will allow for the spatial representation required as an input to spatially-based carbon models.  
Different Approaches may be more effective over different time periods, or may be required for different 
reporting purposes. Methods to carry out matching of the time-series between the different periods or uses 
should be applied.

3.3.2.1 
STRATIFICATION OF LAND-USE DATA 
Once land use and land-use conversion areas have been established, it is necessary to consider the capacity and 
need for further stratification. This may be needed to locate relevant data from subsequent chapters for emissions 
factors, carbon stocks, etc.  Table 3.1 shows the typical stratifications for which data are available for the 
application of Tier 1 emissions and removals estimation. Throughout the default tables used to populate 
equations to calculate a Tier 1 inventory, specific data cells are highlighted that represented the pre-defined 
stratifications applied to Tier 1 inventories. That is, Tier 1 default data (tables) conform to a consistent 
stratification so that there is no further calculation or ambiguity in the appropriate selection of default data to 
populate equations. Where countries are preparing Tiers 2 and 3 inventories, it is likely that stratification 
schemes may differ based on country-specific information and selection, manipulation or supplementation of 
default data may be required. 
Unless all land-use area and stratification data are spatially-explicit (Approach 3), the development of rules for 
allocations to strata may be required. For example, Approach 1 land-use data are stratified by climate and soil 
type to estimate soil C stock changes.  Optimally, the land-use data can be down-scaled to capture the proportion 
of land uses in each climate or soil type, with ancillary information and expert knowledge.  If re-scaling is not 
possible, inventory estimation can still proceed, but the emissions and removals estimates should reflect 
uncertainties in the assignment of emission/stock change factors (and associated parameters) that vary by climate 
and/or soil.  
Management data may only be available in an Approach 1 format (e.g., expert knowledge or periodic surveys of 
different sets of land owners) even if Approach 2 or 3 data are available for land-use categories. In this case, 
management can be summarized as a proportion of the management practice (e.g., % no till, intensive tillage and 
reduced tillage) in each “lands remaining” and “lands converted” land-use category.  This will be a limiting 
assumption if the management classes are not evenly distributed as the impact of management on the emission or 
removal depends on land-use category.  
Tiers 2 and 3 methods may also evaluate interactions between management practices that affect emission/stock 
change factors. Determining the appropriate combinations of management is another issue that needs careful 
consideration.  Tier 1 methods typically do not address the temporal trends in emissions/stock change factors 
(assuming a linear change) or capture interactions among management practices on a specific land use, but rather 
represent an average effect.  Consequently, assignment of emission/stock change factors may become more 
complicated with higher Tier methods and require careful explanation of the scaling processes that were used to 
delineate the appropriate combinations of the climate, soil, ecological zones, and/or management systems.

PREPARING AREA DATA FOR EMISSIONS AND REMOVALS 
ESTIMATION 
Preparing a greenhouse gas inventory for AFOLU requires the integration of land-use area with data of land 
management and biomass, dead organic matter and soil carbon stock pools, in order to estimate carbon stock 
changes and CO2 and non-CO2 emissions and removals associated with land use. Depending on the type of data 
available (Approach 1, 2 or 3), there are implications for the subsequent use of the data in the preparation of 
estimates of emissions and removals according to the land-use conversion framework represented in the 
reporting tables. 
Countries that only have access to Approach 1 data have two options for reporting land-use category conversions. 
Total areas for categories of “land remaining in a land use” may include some portion of land that was converted 
to that land use since the last inventory. Countries should wherever possible apportion change in land-use areas 
over time to inferred land-use conversion categories for the purposes of determining appropriate carbon stock 
and emission factor estimates. For example, a country with 1 Mha of forest, 1,000 ha deforestation and 1,000 ha 
afforestation has a zero net change in Forest Land area (presuming these changes occurred on managed land), 
but will have a reduction in forest biomass C stocks, at least until sufficient regrowth occurs. Subsequent 
decisions will be needed to relate these inferred area conversions between land-use categories to appropriate land 
management, biomass and soil C stocks and emission factors. Where this is done, countries should report the 
basis for these decisions, and any methods of verification or cross-checking of estimates that have been applied, 
and the effects on inventory uncertainty. If this apportioning is not done, then countries should state this, and 
report the effect on uncertainties associated with doing so.  
For countries with Approach 2 data, where information on the areas of each land-use conversion is known but is 
not spatially-explicit, these area estimates still need to be linked to appropriate initial carbon stocks, emissions 
factors, etc.  In some cases, this may require the assignment of the land-use conversion data to climate, and/or 
vegetation type, soil and management strata. Again, this can be done by some form of sampling, scaling or 
expert judgement. Countries should report the basis for these decisions, and any methods of verification or cross-
checking of estimates that have been applied. 
For countries using Approach 3 data, it is possible to apportion areas of land-use conversion by spatially 
intersecting the data with other spatial datasets, such as those on climate, and/or vegetation type, soil and 
management strata. However, it is likely that inference, for example, based on survey data and expert judgement, 
will be needed to apportion the land-use conversion and biophysical data by management practices as data on 
management practices are rarely available in spatially explicit formats. 
3.4 
MATCHING LAND AREAS WITH FACTORS 
FOR ESTIMATING GREENHOUSE GAS 
EMISSIONS AND REMOVALS  
This section provides brief guidance on matching the land-use area data with carbon stocks, emissions factors 
and other relevant data (e.g., forest biomass stocks, average annual net increment) to estimate greenhouse gas 
emissions and removals.  An initial step in preparing national inventory estimates is to assemble the required 
activity data (i.e., land-use areas) and match them with appropriate carbon stock, emissions and removal factors 
and other relevant data.   
This Volume provides default data (specifically marked) needed to make Tier 1 estimates for all AFOLU 
categories according to specified climate and ecological zone stratifications.  In addition, countries may develop 
country-specific carbon stock, emission and removal factors and other relevant data (Tiers 2 and 3 inventory 
methods). The following summarizes the principles to be followed when matching activity data with carbon 
stock, emission and removal factors and other relevant data: 
• 
match national land-use area classifications to as many land-use categories as possible;  
• 
when national land-use classifications do not conform to the land-use categories of these guidelines, 
document the relationship between classification systems; 
• 
use classifications consistently through time and, when necessary, document any modifications made to 
classification system; 
• 
document definitions of land categories, land-use area estimates, and how they correspond to emission and 
removal factors; and,  
Chapter 3: Consistent Representation of Lands 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.19 
• 
match each land-use category or sub-category to the most suitable carbon stock estimates, emission and 
removal factors and other relevant data. 
Following are the recommended steps for matching land areas with emission and removal factors: 
1. Start with the most disaggregated land-use area stratification as well as the most detailed available emission 
and removal factors needed to make an estimate.  For example, the Forest Land methodologies, described in 
Chapter 4 of this Volume, provide a default factor for above-ground biomass stocks in forest plantations that 
is disaggregated at the most detailed stratification, relative to other factors (i.e., forest type, region, species 
group, age class, and climate).  These strata would be used as an initial base stratification.   
2. Include only those strata applicable in your country and use this as a base stratification.   
3. Match land-use area estimates to the base stratification at the most disaggregated level possible.  Countries 
may need to use expert judgment to align the best available land-use area estimates with the base 
stratification.  
4. Map emission and removal factors onto the base stratification by matching them as closely as possible to the 
stratification categories.  Note that many of the default stock change and emissions factors and other 
parameters in Tier 1 (default) equations were statistically derived for specifically defined strata (e.g., climate 
type, soil type) so that countries wishing to use Tier 1 methods for these emissions and removals should 
stratify land-use categories using the definitions as specified for Tier 1 change factors and parameters. 
If a national land-use classification is fitted to the land-use categories (and sub-categories) this facilitates 
matching of emission and removal factors that follow the same classification.  For example, default soil carbon 
factors for Forest Land, Cropland, and Grassland are disaggregated by the same climate regions (see Annex 
3A.5).  Therefore, the same land area classification can be used to estimate soil carbon changes in each of the 
land-use categories, enabling consistent tracking of lands and carbon fluxes on lands resulting from land-use 
category conversions.    
Countries may find that national land classifications change over time as national circumstances change and 
more detailed activity data and emission/removal factors become available.  In some cases, the stratification will 
be elaborated with the addition of more detailed emission and removal factors.  In other cases, new stratifications 
systems will be established when countries implement new forest inventories or remote sensing sampling 
designs.  When changes to the stratification system occur, countries should recalculate the entire time-series of 
estimates using the new stratification if possible.   
3.5 
UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
APPROACHES 
Uncertainties should be quantified and reduced as far as practicable. Land-use area uncertainty estimates are 
required as an input to overall uncertainty analysis. Although the uncertainty associated with the Approaches (1 
to 3) obviously depends on how well they are implemented, it is possible to give an indication of what can be 
achieved in practice. Table 3.7 sets out the sources of uncertainty (not the significance) for different Approaches. 
This provides a guide to sources of uncertainties, indicative levels of uncertainty under certain conditions that 
might be encountered, and a basis for reducing uncertainties. 
The number of potential sources of uncertainty in area estimates will tend to increase from Approach 1 to 
Approach 3, because successively more data are brought into the assessment. This does not imply that 
uncertainty increases, however, because of the additional cross-checks that are made possible by the new data, 
and because of the general reduction in uncertainties due to cancellation of errors. The main difference between 
Approach 1, and Approaches 2 and 3 is that percentage uncertainties on conversion between land uses are likely 
to be greater in Approach 1 (if known at all). This is because in Approach 1 land-use conversions are derived 
from differences (net change) in total areas. The effect of this Approach 1 uncertainty on emissions and removals 
from conversions will depend on the relative amount of land conversion in the country as a fraction of total land 
area. Approach 3 produces detailed spatially-explicit information; which may be required e.g., for some spatial 
modelling approaches to emissions estimation.

Sources of uncertainty 
Ways to reduce uncertainty 
Indicative uncertainty 
following checks 
Approach 1 
Sources of uncertainty may 
include some or all of the 
following, depending on the 
nature of the source of data: 
• 
Error in census returns 
• 
Differences 
in 
definition 
between agencies 
• 
Sampling design 
• 
Sampling error 
• 
Interpretation of samples 
• 
Only net change in area is 
known 
In addition: 
Cross-checks on area changes 
between categories cannot be 
conducted under Approach 1 and 
this will tend to increase 
uncertainties. 
• 
Check for consistent 
relationship with national 
area  
• 
Correct for differences in 
definitions 
• 
Consult statistical 
agencies on likely 
uncertainties involved 
• 
Compare with 
international datasets 
Order of a few % to order of 
10% for total land area in 
each category.  
 
Greater % uncertainty for 
changes in area derived from 
successive surveys. 
 
Systematic errors may be 
significant when data 
prepared for other purposes is 
used. 
Approach 2 
As Approach 1, but gross 
changes in area are known, and 
with ability to carry out cross-
checks  
As above, plus consistency 
checks between inter-
category changes within the 
matrix 
Order of a few % to order of 
10% for total land area in 
each category, and greater for 
changes in area, since these 
are derived directly 
Approach 3 
As Approach 2 plus uncertainties 
linked to interpretation of remote 
sensing data where used, and 
minus any sampling uncertainty 
As Approach 2 plus formal 
analysis of uncertainties using 
principles set out in Volume 1 
Chapter 3 
 
As Approach 2, but areas 
involved can be identified 
geographically. However, for 
Approach 3, the amount of 
uncertainty can be estimated 
more accurately than for 
Approach 2 because errors are 
mapped and can be tested 
against independent data/field 
checked.

3.25 
Annex 3A.2 
Development of land-use databases  
There are three broad sources of data for the land-use databases needed for greenhouse gas inventories:  
• 
databases prepared for other purposes;  
• 
collection by sampling; and 
• 
complete land inventory.  
 The following subsections provide general advice on the use of these types of data. Greenhouse gas inventory 
preparers might not be involved in the detailed collection of remote sensing data or ground survey data, but can 
use the guidance provided here to help plan inventory improvements and communicate with experts in these 
areas. 
3A.2.1 
USE OF DATA PREPARED FOR OTHER PURPOSES  
Two types of available databases may be used to classify land. In many countries, national datasets of the type 
discussed below will be available. Otherwise, inventory compilers may use international datasets. Both types of 
databases are described below. 
NATIONAL DATABASES 
These will usually be based on existing data, updated annually or periodically. Typical sources of data include 
forest inventories, agricultural census and other surveys, censuses for urban and natural land, land registry data 
and maps.  
INTERNATIONAL DATABASES  
Several projects have been undertaken to develop international land-use and land cover datasets at regional to 
global scales (Annex 3A.1 lists some of these datasets). Almost all of these datasets are stored as raster data 
generated using different kinds of satellite remote sensing imagery, complemented by ground reference data 
obtained by field survey or comparison with existing statistics/maps. These datasets can be used for: 
• 
Estimating spatial distribution of land-use categories. Conventional inventories usually provide only the 
total sum of land-use area by classes. Spatial distribution can be reconstructed using international land-use 
and land cover data as auxiliary data where national data are not available. 
• 
Reliability assessment of the existing land-use datasets. Comparison between independent national and 
international datasets can indicate apparent discrepancies, and understanding these may increase confidence 
in national data and/or improve the usability of the international data, if required for purposes such as 
extrapolation. 
• 
When using an international dataset, inventory compilers should consider the following:  
(i) The classification scheme (e.g., definition of land-use classes and their relations) may differ from that in 
the national system. The equivalence between the classification systems used by the country and the 
systems described in Section 3.2 (Land-use categories) therefore needs to be established by contacting 
the international agency and comparing their definitions with those used nationally. 
(ii) Spatial resolution (typically 1km nominally but sometimes an order of magnitude more in practice) may 
be coarse, so national data may need aggregating to improve comparability. 
(iii) Classification accuracy and errors in geo-referencing may exist, though several accuracy tests are 
usually conducted at sample sites. The agencies responsible should have details on classification 
issues and tests undertaken. 
(iv) As with national data, interpolation or extrapolation will probably be needed to develop estimates for 
the time periods to match the dates required for reporting. 
 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
3.26 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3A.2.2 
COLLECTION OF NEW DATA BY SAMPLING METHODS 
Sampling techniques for estimating areas and area changes are applied in situations where total tallies by direct 
measurements in the field or assessments by remote sensing techniques are not feasible or would provide 
inaccurate results. Sampling concepts that allow for estimation procedures that are consistent and unbiased, and 
result in estimates that are precise, should be used.  
Sampling usually involves a set of sampling units that are located on a regular grid within the inventory area. A 
land-use class is then assigned to each sampling unit. Sampling units can be used to derive the proportions of 
land-use categories within the inventory area. Multiplying the proportions by the total area provides estimates of 
the area of each land-use category. Where the total area is not known it is assumed that each sampling unit 
represents a specific area. The area of the land-use category can then be estimated via the number of sampling 
units that fall into this category. 
Where sampling for areas is repeated at successive occasions, area changes over time can be derived to construct 
land-use conversion matrices. 
Applying a sample-based type for area assessment enables the calculation of sampling errors and confidence 
intervals that quantify the reliability of the area estimates in each category. Confidence intervals can be used to 
verify if observed category area changes are statistically significant and reflect meaningful changes. 
Annex 3A.3 provides more information on sampling. 
3A.2.3 
COLLECTION OF NEW DATA IN COMPLETE INVENTORIES 
A complete inventory of land use of all areas in a country will entail obtaining maps of land use throughout the 
country at regular intervals. This can be achieved by using remote sensing techniques. As outlined under 
Approach 3, the data will be most easily used in a GIS based on a set of grid cells or polygons supported by 
ground truth data needed to achieve unbiased interpretation. Coarser scale data can be used to build data for the 
whole country or appropriate regions. 
A complete inventory can also be achieved by surveying all landowners and each would need to provide suitable 
data where they own many different blocks of land. Inherent problems in the method include obtaining data at 
scales smaller than the size of the owner’s land as well as difficulties with ensuring complete coverage with no 
overlaps. 
3A.2.4 
TOOLS FOR DATA COLLECTION 
REMOTE SENSING (RS) TECHNIQUES  
Remotely sensed data, as discussed here, are those acquired by sensors (optical, radar or lidar) onboard satellites, 
or by cameras equipped with optical or infrared films, installed in aircraft. These data are usually classified to 
provide estimates of the land cover and its corresponding area, and usually require ground survey data to provide 
an estimate of the classification accuracy. Classification can be done either by visual analysis of the imagery or 
photographs, or by digital (computer-based) methods. The strengths of remote sensing come from its ability to 
provide spatially-explicit information and repeated coverage, including the possibility of covering large and/or 
remote areas that are difficult to access otherwise. Archives of past remote sensing data also span several 
decades and can therefore be used to reconstruct past time-series of land cover and land use. The challenge of 
remote sensing is related to the problem of interpretation: the images need to be translated into meaningful 
information on land cover and land use. Depending on the satellite sensor, the acquisition of data may be 
impaired by the presence of atmospheric clouds and haze. Another concern, particularly when comparing data 
over long time periods, is that remote sensing systems may change. Remote sensing is particularly useful for 
obtaining area estimates of land cover and land-use categories and for assisting in the identification of relatively 
homogeneous areas that can guide the selection of sampling schemes and the number of samples to be collected.  
Types of remote sensing (RS) data 
The most commonly used types of RS data are: 1) aerial photographs, 2) satellite imagery using visible and/or 
near-infrared bands, 3) satellite or airborne radar imagery and, 4) lidar. Combinations of different types of 
remote sensing data (e.g., visible/infrared and radar; different spatial or spectral resolutions) might very well be 
used for assessing different land-use categories or regions. A complete remote sensing system for tracking land-
use conversions can include many sensor and data type combinations at a variety of resolutions. 
Chapter 3: Consistent Representation of Lands 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.27 
Important criteria for selecting remote sensing data and products are: 
• 
Adequate land-use categorisation scheme; 
• 
Appropriate spatial resolution;  
• 
Appropriate temporal resolution for estimating of land-use conversion; 
• 
Availability of accuracy assessment; 
• 
Transparent methods applied in data acquisition and processing; and 
• 
Consistency and availability over time. 
1. Aerial photographs 
Analysis of aerial photographs can reveal forest tree species and forest structure from which relative age 
distribution and tree health (e.g., needle loss in coniferous forests, leaf loss and stress in deciduous forests) may 
be inferred. In agriculture, analysis can show crop species, crop stress, and tree cover in agro-forestry systems. 
The smallest spatial unit possible to assess depends on the type of aerial photos used, but for standard products it 
is often as small as 1 square metre.  
2. Satellite images in visible and near infrared wavelengths 
Complete land use or land cover of large areas (national or regional) may be facilitated by the use of satellite 
images. The possibility exists of obtaining long time-series of data from the desired area since the satellite 
continuously and regularly passes over it. The images usually generate a detailed mosaic of distinct categories, 
but the labelling into proper land cover and land-use categories commonly requires ground reference data from 
maps or field surveys. The smallest unit to be identified depends on the spatial resolution of the sensor and the 
scale of work. The most common sensor systems have a spatial resolution of 20 – 30 metres. At a spatial 
resolution of 30 metres, for example, units as small as 1ha can be identified. Data from higher resolution 
satellites are also available. 
3. Radar imagery 
The most common type of radar data are from the so-called Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems that 
operate at microwave frequencies. A major advantage of such systems is that they can penetrate clouds and haze, 
and acquire data during night-time. They may therefore be the only reliable source of remote sensing data in 
many areas of the world with quasi-permanent cloud cover. By using different wavelengths and different 
polarisations, SAR systems may be able to distinguish land cover categories (e.g., forest/non-forest), or the 
biomass content of vegetation, although there are at present some limitations at high biomass due to signal 
saturation. 
4. Lidar 
Light detection and ranging (lidar) uses the same principles as radar. The lidar instrument transmits light out to a 
target. The transmitted light interacts with and is changed by the target. Some of this light is reflected/scattered 
back to the instrument where it is analysed. The change in the properties of the light enables some property of 
the target to be determined. The time for the light to travel out to the target and back to the lidar is used to 
determine the range to the target. There are three basic types of lidar: range finders, differential absorption lidar, 
and doppler. 
Ground reference data 
In order to make use of remote sensing data for inventories, and in particular to relate land cover to land use it is 
good practice to complement the remotely sensed data with ground reference data (often called ground truth 
data). Ground reference data can either be collected independently, or be obtained from forest or agricultural 
inventories. Land uses that are rapidly changing over the estimation period or that have vegetation cover known 
to be easily misclassified should be more intensively ground-truthed than other areas. This can only be done by 
using ground reference data, preferably from actual ground surveys collected independently. High-resolution 
photographs may also be useful. 
Integration of remote sensing and GIS 
Visual interpretation of images is often used for identifying sampling sites for forestry inventories. The method 
is simple, and reliable. However, it is labour intensive and therefore restricted to limited areas, and may be 
affected by subjective interpretations by different operators.  
Full use of remote sensing generally requires integration of the extensive coverage that remote sensing can 
provide with ground-based point measurements or map data to represent areas associated with particular land 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
3.28 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
uses in space and time. This is generally achieved most cost effectively using a geographical information system 
(GIS).  
Land cover classification using remotely sensed data 
Classification of land cover using remotely sensed data may be done by visual or digital (computer based) 
analysis. Each one presents advantages and disadvantages. Visual analysis of imagery allows for human 
inference through the evaluation of overall characteristics of the scene (analysis of the contextual aspects in the 
image). Digital classification, on the other hand, allows several manipulations to be performed with the data, 
such as merging of different spectral data, which can help to improve modelling of the biophysical ground data 
(such as tree diameter, height, basal area, biomass) using the remotely sensed data. In addition, digital analysis 
allows for the immediate computation of areas associated with the different land categories. It has developed 
rapidly over the past decade, along with the associated technical computer development, making hardware, 
software and also the satellite data readily available at low cost in most countries, although capacity to use these 
data and facilities may have to be outsourced, particularly in mapping at national level.  
Detection of land-use conversion using RS 
Remote sensing can be used to detect locations of change. Methods for change detection can be divided into two 
categories (Singh, 1989): 
Post-classification change detection: This refers to techniques where two or more predefined land cover/use 
classifications exist from different points in time, and where the changes are detected, usually by subtraction of 
the datasets. The techniques are straightforward but are also sensitive to inconsistencies in interpretation and 
classification of the land-use categories.  
Pre-classification change detection: This refers to more sophisticated and biophysical approaches to change 
detection. Differences between spectral response data from two or more points in time are compared by 
statistical methods and these differences are used to provide information on land cover/use changes. This type is 
less sensitive to interpretation inconsistencies and can detect much more subtle changes than the post-
classification approaches, but is less straightforward and requires access to the original remotely sensed data. 
There are also other viable methods.  For example, one can use change enhancements and visual interpretation.  
Areas of change are highlighted through display of different band combinations, band differences or derived 
indices (e.g., vegetation indices).  This focuses attention on potential land-use conversions sites that can then be 
delineated and attributed through manual or automated techniques.  These methods are subject to human 
interpreter inconsistencies, but are capable of detecting subtle changes and better detecting and mapping land-use 
conversion where land cover, context and ancillary information is needed to determine land-use conversion. 
Evaluation of mapping accuracy 
Whenever a map of land cover or land use is being used, inventory compilers should acquire information about 
the reliability of the map. When such maps are generated from classification of remote sensing data, it should be 
recognised that the reliability of the map is likely to vary between the different land categories. Some categories 
may be uniquely distinguished while others may be confounded with others. For example, coniferous forest is 
often more accurately classified than deciduous forest because its reflectance characteristics are more distinct, 
while deciduous forest may easily be confounded with, for example, Grassland or Cropland. Similarly, it is often 
difficult to ascertain changes in land management practices through remote sensing. For example, it may be 
difficult to detect a change from intensive to reduced tillage on a specific land area. 
Inventory compilers should estimate the accuracy of land-use/land cover maps on a category-by-category basis. 
A number of sample points on the map and their corresponding real world categories are used to create a 
confusion matrix (see footnote 5 in Annex 3A.4) with the diagonal showing the proportion of correct 
identification and the off-diagonal elements showing the relative proportion of misclassification of a land 
category into one of the other possible categories. The confusion matrix expresses not only the accuracy of the 
map but it is also possible to assess which categories are easily confounded with each other. Based on the 
confusion matrix, a number of accuracy indices can be derived (Congalton, 1991). Multi-temporal analysis 
(analysis of images taken at different times to determine the stability of land-use classification) can also be used 
to improve classification accuracy, particularly in cases where ground truth data are limited.   
GROUND-BASED SURVEYS 
Ground-based surveys may be used to gather and record information on land use, and for use as independent 
ground-truth data for remote sensing classification. Prior to the advent of remote sensing techniques such as 
aerial photography and satellite imagery, ground-based surveys were the only means of generating maps. The 
process is essentially one of visiting the area under study and recording visible and/or other physical attributes of 
Chapter 3: Consistent Representation of Lands 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.29 
the landscape for mapping purposes. Digitisation of boundaries and symbolising attributes are used to make hard 
copy field notes and historical maps useful in Geographical Information Systems (GIS). This is done via 
protocols on minimum land area delineation and attribute categorization that are linked to the scale of the 
resultant map and its intended use. 
Very precise measurements of area and location can be made using a combination of survey equipment such as 
theodolites, tape measures, distance wheels and electronic distance measuring devices. Development of Global 
Positioning Systems (GPS) means that location information can be recorded in the field directly into electronic 
format using portable computer devices. Data are downloaded to an office computer for registration and 
coordination with other layers of information for spatial analysis. 
Landowner interviews and questionnaires are used to collect socio-economic and land management information, 
but may also provide data on land use and land-use conversion. With this census type, the data collection agency 
depends on the knowledge and records of landowners (or users) to provide reliable data. Typically, the resident 
is visited and interviewed by a representative of the collection agency and data are recorded in a predetermined 
format, or a questionnaire is issued to the land user for completion. The respondent is usually encouraged to use 
any relevant records or maps they may have, but questions may also be used to elicit information directly 
(Swanson et al., 1997). 
Census surveys are probably the oldest form of data collection methods (Darby, 1970). Land user surveys can be 
conducted on the entire population or a sample of suitable size. Modern applications employ a full range of 
validation and accuracy assessment techniques. The survey may be undertaken through personal visits, telephone 
interviews (often with computer-assisted prompts) or mail-out questionnaires. Land user surveys start with the 
formulation of data and information needs into a series of simple and clear questions soliciting concise and 
unequivocal responses. The questions are tested on a sample of the population in order to ensure that they are 
understandable and to identify any local technical terminology variations. For sample applications, the entire 
study area is spatially stratified by appropriate ecological and/or administrative land units, and by significant 
categorical differences within the population (e.g., private versus corporate, large versus small, pulp versus 
lumber, etc.). For responses dealing with land areas and management practices, some geographic location, 
whether precise coordinates, cadastral description or at least ecological or administrative units should be required 
of the respondent. Post-survey validation of results is conducted by searching for statistical anomalies, 
comparing with independent data sources, conducting a sample of follow-up verification questionnaires or 
conducting a sample of on-site verification surveys. Finally, presentation of results must follow the initial 
stratification parameters.

Sampling 
3A.3.1 
INTRODUCTION  
Data on land use are often obtained from sample surveys and typically are used for estimating changes in land 
use or in carbon stocks. National forest inventories are important examples of the type of surveys used. This 
section provides guidance for the use of data from sample surveys for the reporting of emissions and removals of 
greenhouse gases, and for the planning of sample surveys in order to acquire data for this purpose.  
3A.3.2 
OVERVIEW ON SAMPLING PRINCIPLES 
Sampling infers information about an entire population by observing a fraction of it: the sample (see Figure 
3A.3.1). For example, changes of carbon in tree biomass at regional or national levels can be estimated from the 
growth, mortality and cuttings of trees on a limited number of sample plots. Sampling theory then provides the 
means for scaling up the information from the sample plots to the selected geographical level. Properly designed 
sampling can greatly increase efficiency in the use of inventory resources. Furthermore, field sampling is generally 
needed in developing inventories because, even if remote sensing data provide complete territorial coverage, there 
will be a need for ground-based data from sample sites for interpretation and verification. 
Figure 3A.3.1 
Principle of sampling 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Standard sampling theory relies on random selection of a sample from the population; each unit in the population 
has a specific probability of being included in the sample. This is the case when sample plots have been 
distributed entirely at random within an area, or when plots have been distributed in a systematic grid system as 
long as the positioning of the grid is random. Random sampling reduces the risk of bias and allows for an 
objective assessment of the uncertainty of the estimates. Therefore, randomly sampled data generally should be 
used where available, or when setting up new surveys. 
Samples may also be taken at subjectively chosen locations, which are assumed to be representative for the 
population. This is called subjective (or purposive) sampling and data from such surveys are often used in 
greenhouse gas inventories (i.e., when observations from survey sites that were not selected randomly are used to 
represent an entire land category or strata). Under these conditions, observations about, for example, forest type 
might be extrapolated to areas for which they are not representative. However, due to limited resources 
greenhouse gas inventories may need to make use of data also from subjectively selected sites or research plots. 
In this case, it is good practice to identify, in consultation with the agencies responsible for the sites or plots, the 
land areas for which the subjective samples can be regarded as representative.

SAMPLING DESIGN 
Sampling design determines how the sampling units (the sites or plots) are selected from the population and thus 
what statistical estimation procedures should be applied to make inferences from the sample. Random sampling 
designs can be divided into two main groups, depending on whether or not the population is stratified (i.e., sub-
divided before sampling) using auxiliary information. Stratified surveys will generally be more efficient in terms 
of what accuracy can be achieved at a certain cost. On the other hand, they tend to be slightly more complex, 
which increases the risk of non-sampling errors due to incorrect use of the collected data. Sampling designs 
should aim for a good compromise between simplicity and efficiency, and this can be promoted by following 
three aspects as set out below:  
• 
Use of auxiliary data and stratification; 
• 
Systematic sampling; 
• 
Permanent sample plots and time-series data. 
Use of auxiliary data and stratification 
One of the most important sampling designs which incorporate auxiliary information is stratification, whereby 
the population is divided into subpopulations on the basis of auxiliary data. These data may consist of 
knowledge of legal, administrative boundaries or boundaries of forest administrations which will be efficient to 
sample separately, or maps or remote sensing data distinguishing between upland and lowland areas or between 
different ecosystem types. Since stratification is intended to increase efficiency, it is good practice to use 
auxiliary data when such data are available or can be made available at low additional cost.   
Stratification increases efficiency in two main ways: (i) by improving the accuracy of the estimate for the entire 
population; and (ii) by ensuring that adequate results are obtained for certain subpopulations, e.g., for certain 
administrative regions. 
On the first issue, stratification increases sampling efficiency if a sub-division of the population is made so that 
the variability between units within a stratum is reduced as compared to the variability within the entire 
population. For example, a country may be divided into a lowland region (with certain features of the land-use 
categories of interest) and an upland region (with different features of the corresponding categories). If each 
stratum is homogeneous a precise overall estimate can be obtained using only a limited sample from each 
stratum. The second issue is important for purposes of providing results at a specific degree of accuracy for all 
administrative regions of interest, but also in case sampled data are to be used together with other existing 
datasets, which have been collected using different protocols with the same administrative or legal boundaries. 
Use of remote sensing or map data for identifying the boundaries of the strata (the land-use class sub-divisions to 
be included in a sample survey) can introduce errors where some areas may be incorrectly classified as 
belonging to the stratum whilst other areas that do belong to the specific class are missed. Errors of this kind can 
lead to substantial bias in the final estimates, since the area identified for sampling will then not correspond to 
the target population. Whenever there is an obvious risk that errors of this kind may occur, it is good practice to 
make an assessment of the potential impact of such errors using ground truth data.  
When data for the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions or removals are taken from existing large-scale 
inventories, such as national forest inventories, it is convenient to apply the standard estimation procedures of 
that inventory, as long as they are based on sound statistical principles. In addition, post-stratification (i.e., 
defining strata based on remote sensing or map auxiliary data after the field survey has been conducted) means 
that it may be possible to use new auxiliary data to increase efficiency without changing the basic field design 
(Dees et al., 1998). Using this estimation principle, the risk for bias pointed out in the previous paragraph also 
can be reduced.  
Systematic sampling 
Sample based forest or land-use surveys generally make use of sample points or plots on which the 
characteristics of interest are recorded. One important issue here regards the layout of these points or plots. It is 
often appropriate to allocate the plots in small clusters in order to minimise travel costs when covering large 
areas with a sample based survey. With cluster sampling, the distance between plots should be large enough to 
avoid major between-plot correlation, taking (for forest sampling) stand size into account. An important issue is 
whether plots (or clusters of plots) should be laid out entirely at random or systematically using a regular grid, 
which is randomly located over the area of interest (see Figure 3A.3.2). In general, it is efficient to use 
systematic sampling, since in most cases this will increase the precision of the estimates. Systematic sampling 
also simplifies the fieldwork.

2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Figure 3A.3.2

Somewhat simplified, the reason why systematic random sampling generally is superior to simple random 
sampling is that sample plots will be distributed evenly to all parts of the target area.3 With simple random 
sampling, some parts of an area may have many plots while other parts will not have any plots at all. 
Permanent sample plots and time-series data 
Greenhouse gas inventories must assess both current state and changes over time (e.g., in areas of land-use 
categories and carbon stocks). Assessment of changes is most important and it involves repeated sampling over 
time. The time interval between measurements should be determined based on the frequency of the events that 
cause changes, and also on the reporting requirements. Generally, sampling intervals of 5-10 years are adequate, 
and in many countries data from well designed surveys are already available for many decades, especially in the 
forest sector. Nevertheless, since estimates for the reporting are required on an annual basis, interpolation and 
extrapolation methods will need to be applied. Where sufficiently long time-series are not available, it may be 
necessary to extrapolate backwards in time to capture the dynamics of carbon stock changes. 
When undertaking repeated sampling, the required data regarding the current state of areas or carbon stocks are 
assessed on each occasion. Changes are then estimated by calculating the difference between the state at time (t + 1) 
from the state at time t. Three common sampling designs can be used for change estimation: 
• 
The same sampling units are used on both occasions (permanent sampling units); 
• 
Different, independent sets of sampling units are used on both occasions (temporary sampling units); 
• 
Some sampling units can be replaced between occasions while others remain the same (sampling with 
partial replacement). 
Figure 3A.3.3 shows these three Approaches.

3 In unusual cases when there is a regular pattern in the terrain that may coincide with the systematic grid system, systematic 
sampling may lead to less precise estimates than simple random sampling. However, such potential problems generally can 
be handled by orienting the grid system in another direction. 
Chapter 3: Consistent Representation of Lands 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.33 
Permanent sample plots generally are more efficient in estimating changes than temporary plots because it is 
easier to distinguish actual trends from differences that are only due to changed plot selection. However, there 
are also some risks in the use of permanent sample plots. If the locations of permanent sample plots become 
known to land managers (e.g., by visibly marking the plots), there is a risk that management of the permanent 
plots will differ from the management of other areas. If this occurs, the plots will no longer be representative and 
there is an obvious risk that the results will be biased. If it is perceived that there might be a risk of the above 
kind, it is good practice to assess some temporary plots as a control sample in order to determine if the 
conditions on these plots deviate from the conditions on the permanent plots. 
The use of sampling with partial replacement can address some of the potential problems with relying on 
permanent plots, because it is possible to replace sites that are believed to have been treated differently. 
Sampling with partial replacement may be used, although the estimation procedures are complicated (Scott and 
Köhl, 1994; Köhl et al., 1995).  
When only temporary plots are used, overall changes still can be estimated but it will no longer be possible to 
study land-use conversions between different categories unless a time dimension can be introduced into the 
sample.  This can be done by drawing on auxiliary data, for example maps, remote sensing or administrative 
records about the state of land in the past. This will introduce additional uncertainty into the assessment which it 
may be difficult to quantify other than by expert judgement. 
3A.3.4 
SAMPLING METHODS FOR AREA ESTIMATION 
Many approaches for assessing land-use areas or conversions in areas of land use rely on sampling. Areas and 
changes in areas can be estimated in two different ways using sampling: 
• 
Estimation via proportions;  
• 
Direct estimation of area.  
The first approach requires that the total area of the survey region is known, and that the sample survey provides 
only the proportions of different land-use category. The second approach does not require the total area to be 
known. 
Both approaches require assessment of a given number of sampling units located in the inventory area. Selection 
of sampling units may be performed using simple random sampling or systematic sampling (see Figure 3A.3.2). 
Systematic sampling generally improves the precision of the area estimates, especially when the different land-
use classes occur in large patches. Stratification also may be applied to improve the efficiency of the area 
estimates; in this case it is good practice to perform the procedures described below independently in each 
stratum. 
In estimating proportions it is assumed that the sampling units are dimensionless points, although a small area 
around each point must be considered when the land-use category is determined. Sample plots may also be used 
for area estimation, although this principle is not further elaborated here. 
3A.3.5 
ESTIMATION OF AREAS VIA PROPORTIONS 
The total area of an inventory region is generally known. In this case the estimation of the areas of different land-
use categories can be based on assessments of area proportions. When applying this approach, the inventory area 
is covered by a certain number of sample points, and land use is determined for each point. The proportion of 
each land-use category then is calculated by dividing the number of points located in the specific category by the 
total number of points. Area estimates for each land-use category are obtained by multiplying the proportion of 
each category by the total area. 
Table 3A.3.1 provides an example of this procedure. The standard error of an area estimate is obtained 
as

, where pi is the proportion of points in the particular land-use category i; A the known 
total area, and n the total number of sample points.4  The 95% confidence interval for Ai, the estimated area of 
land-use category i, will be given approximately by ±2 times the standard error.

Estimates of land-use conversion areas can be made by introducing categories of the type Aij where land use is 
converted from category i to category j between successive surveys. 
3A.3.6 
DIRECT ESTIMATION OF AREA 
Whenever the total inventory area is known, it is efficient to estimate areas, and area changes, via assessment of 
proportions, since that procedure will result in the highest accuracy. In cases where the total inventory area is not 
known or is subject to unacceptable uncertainty, an alternative procedure that involves a direct assessment of 
areas under different land-use classes can be applied. This approach can only be used when systematic sampling 
is applied; each sample point will represent an area corresponding to the size of the grid cell of the sample layout. 
For example, when sample points are selected from a square systematic grid with 1000 metres distance between 
the points, each sample point will represent an area of 1 km ● 1 km = 100 ha. Thus, if 15 plots fall within a 
specific land-use class of interest the area estimate will be 15  ●  100 ha = 1500 ha.

Overview of Approach 3: Direct and repeated assessments of land use from 
full spatial coverage 
Description 
Under Approach 3 the country is sub-divided into spatial units such as grid cells or small polygons. In this 
example grid cells are used for sub-division of the area. The grid cells may be sampled by remote sensing 
and/or ground survey, in order to establish the areas of the land use whose estimated extent is shown by the 
grey lines below the grid. Remote sensing can also enable complete coverage of all grid cells (Figure 
3A.4.1A) in the interpretation of land use. Ground surveys can be carried out in a sample of grid cells and 
can be used to establish land use directly, as well as to help interpret remotely sensed data. The sample of 
grid cells can be distributed regularly (Figure 3A.4.1B) or irregularly (Figure 3A.4.1C), for example, to 
give greater coverage where land-use conversion is more likely. Generalised maps can be prepared using 
the grid cells, which can also be aggregated into polygons (Figure 3A.4.1D). The final result of the 
Approach can result in either a tabular or spatially-explicit land-use conversion matrix.

When using Approach 3, inventory compilers should: 
• 
Use a sampling strategy consistent with the advice provided in this chapter. This strategy should ensure that 
the data are unbiased and can be scaled up where necessary.  The number and location of the sampling units 
may need to change over time in order to remain representative.  
• 
Where remote sensing data are used, develop a method for its interpretation into land categories using 
ground reference data as set out in this chapter (Remote sensing techniques). Care should be taken to 
correctly assign land cover information obtained through imagery, into land-use category. Conventional 
forest inventories or other survey data can be used for this. It is necessary to avoid possible misclassification 
of land types and map accuracy established by means of ground reference or very high resolution remotely 
sensed data. The conventional technique is to establish a matrix5 showing, for any given classification of 
land, the proportion of misclassification as one of the other candidate classifications.  
• 
Construct confidence intervals for those land category areas and changes in area that will be used in the 
estimation of carbon stock changes, emissions and removals. 
• 
Derive summary tables of the national areas under different land-use conversion.

Annex 3A.5 
Default climate and soil classifications 
Climate regions are classified in order to apply emission and stock change factors for estimating biomass, dead 
organic matter and soil C stock changes.  The default climate classification is provided in Figure 3A.5.1 and can 
be derived using the classification scheme in Figure 3A.5.2.  This classification should be used for Tier 1 
methods because the default emission and stock change factors were derived using this scheme.  Note that 
climate regions are further subdivided into ecological zones to apply the Tier 1 method for estimating biomass C 
stock changes (see Table 4.1, Chapter 4).  Inventory compilers have the option of developing a country-specific 
climate classification if using Tier 2 and 3 methods, along with country-specific emission and stock change 
factors.   It is good practice to apply the same classification, either default or country-specific, across all land-use 
types.  Thus, stock change and emission factors are assigned to each pool in a national inventory using a uniform 
classification of climate.   
Soils are classified in order to apply reference C stocks and stock change factors for estimation of soil C stock 
changes, as well as the soil N2O emissions (i.e., organic soils must be classified to estimate N2O emissions 
following drainage).  Organic soils are found in wetlands or have been drained and converted to other land-use 
types (e.g., Forest Land, Cropland, Grassland, Settlements).  Organic soils are identified on the basis of criteria 1 
and 2, or 1 and 3 listed below (FAO 1998): 
1. Thickness of organic horizon greater than or equal to 10 cm.  A horizon of less than 20 cm must have 12 
percent or more organic carbon when mixed to a depth of 20 cm. 
2. Soils that are never saturated with water for more than a few days must contain more than 20 percent 
organic carbon by weight (i.e., about 35 percent organic matter). 
3. Soils are subject to water saturation episodes and has either: 
a. 
At least 12 percent organic carbon by weight (i.e., about 20 percent organic matter) if the soil has no 
clay; or  
b. At least 18 percent organic carbon by weight (i.e., about 30 percent organic matter) if the soil has 
60% or more clay; or 
c. 
An intermediate, proportional amount of organic carbon for intermediate amounts of clay. 
All other types of soils are classified as mineral.  A default mineral soil classification is provided in Figure 
3A.5.3 for categorizing soil types based on the USDA taxonomy (USDA, 1999) and Figure 3A.5.4 for the World 
Reference Base for Soil Resources Classification (FAO, 1998) (Note: Both classifications produce the same 
default IPCC soil types).  The default mineral soil classification should be used with Tier 1 methods because 
default reference C stock and stock change factors were derived according to these soil types.  Inventory 
compilers have the option of developing a country-specific classification for mineral and/or organic if applying 
Tiers 2 and 3 methods, in combination with developing country-specific reference C stocks and stock change 
factors (or emission factors in the case of organic soils).  It is good practice to use the same classification of soils 
across all land-use types.
